5|$|Hot Jupiters, due {{to their}} extreme proximities to their host stars, have been shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>losing</b> their atmospheres into space due to stellar radiation, much like the tails of comets. These planets may have vast {{differences}} in temperature between their day and night sides that produce supersonic winds, although {{the day and night}} sides of HD 189733 b appear to have very similar temperatures, indicating that that planet's atmosphere effectively redistributes the star's energy around the planet.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s, {{even before}} the {{increase}} of abuse of the Case Stated procedure, the United Kingdom was estimated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>losing</b> £500 million a year through the movement of arbitration business to other countries. In response, the Lord Chancellor convened a Commercial Court Users Conference in 1960, and tasked them with reviewing the system; the conclusion was that the status quo should remain. With {{the increased use of}} the Case Stated procedure, more calls for reform came. In June 1977 the London Arbitration Group (LAG) was formed, taking it upon itself to make the government aware of the damage current law was causing. In 1978, in reaction to the continued pressure, the Lord Chancellor established a Commercial Court Committee to again look at the issue; their report, in June 1978, recommended changing the system so that appeal was only allowed when either the High Court permitted it, or both parties to the arbitration agreed it was necessary. This was intended to ensure that any new Act of Parliament fulfilled two roles – firstly, decreasing the use of the Case Stated procedure, and secondly, encouraging arbitrators to give reasons for their decisions.|$|E
25|$|The line {{began to}} suffer {{competition}} with buses, notably the 403 route which ran from Croydon via Sanderstead, Chelsham and Westerham to Sevenoaks, and as train fares rose dramatically from 1938, passenger numbers fell. By 1960 {{the line was}} reported <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>losing</b> £26,000 per year and a proposal was made to close it in April 1960. However, the Central Transport Users' Consultative Committee argued against this move, claiming that 200 passengers per day used the line.|$|E

25|$|The diesel railcars were {{an attempt}} to carry light {{passenger}} traffic at lower cost, but since 1918 competition from road transport had severely reduced the line's income; motor lorries abstracted goods traffic and omnibuses reduced passenger carryings. The process continued relentlessly, affecting passenger and goods business. After nationalisation of the railways in 1948, the line was said <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>losing</b> £20,000 on its passenger operation, and the decision was taken to stop running passenger trains. The last such train ran on 4 January 1959.|$|E
25|$|Nationally, President Grant {{was blamed}} for the depression; the Republican Party lost 96 seats {{in all parts of}} the country in the 1874 elections. The Bourbon Democrats took control of the House and were {{confident}} of electing Samuel J. Tilden president in 1876. President Grant was not running for re-election and seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>losing</b> interest in the South. States fell to the Redeemers, with only four in Republican hands in 1873, Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina; Arkansas then fell after the violent Brooks–Baxter War in 1874 ripped apart the Republican party there.|$|E
25|$|The first {{observed}} extrasolar {{planetary atmosphere}} {{was made in}} 2001. Sodium in {{the atmosphere of the}} planet HD 209458 b was detected during a set of four transits of the planet across its star. Later observations with the Hubble Space Telescope showed an enormous ellipsoidal envelope of hydrogen, carbon and oxygen around the planet. This envelope reaches temperatures of 10,000 K. The planet is estimated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>losing</b> (1-5)108 kg of hydrogen per second. This type of atmosphere loss may be common to all planets orbiting Sun-like stars closer than around 0.1 AU. In addition to hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen, HD 209458 b is thought to have water vapor in its atmosphere. Sodium and water vapour has also been observed in the atmosphere of HD 189733 b, another hot gas giant planet.|$|E

25|$|On 13 October 1993, the 328 {{formally}} entered commercial service. The 328 {{was launched}} onto the market {{during a period}} in which it was crowded with large numbers of competing turboprop aircraft, as well as facing increasing competition from newly launched regional jets, which were becoming increasingly popular during the early 1990s. The 328 had the advantages of being both quieter and faster than many of its rivals, however this did not ensure its commercial success. The latter half of the 328 program was performed during a recession, curtailing demand for new aircraft from operators. Both the 328 and the wider Dornier division of Deutsche Aerospace proved <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>losing</b> money; accordingly Deutsche Aerospace wavered in committing more resources to the regional aircraft market, repeatedly delaying a decision to proceed with a 48-seat stretched model of the 328, which had originally been unveiled in 1991.|$|E
500|$|Blyton's health {{began to}} {{deteriorate}} in 1957, when during {{a round of}} golf she started to complain of feeling faint and breathless, and by 1960 she was displaying signs of dementia. Her agent George Greenfield recalled that it was [...] "unthinkable" [...] for the [...] "most famous and successful of children's authors with her enormous energy and computer-like memory" [...] <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>losing</b> her mind and suffering from what is now known as Alzheimer's disease in her mid-sixties. Blyton's situation was worsened by her husband's declining health throughout the 1960s; he suffered from severe arthritis in his neck and hips, deafness, and became increasingly ill-tempered and erratic until his death on 15 September 1967.|$|E
500|$|In 2003–4, astronomers {{used the}} Hubble Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph to {{discover}} an enormous ellipsoidal envelope of hydrogen, carbon and oxygen {{around the planet}} that reaches 10,000 K. The hydrogen exosphere extends to a distance RH=3.1 RJ, {{much larger than the}} planetary radius of 1.32 RJ. At this temperature and distance, the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution of particle velocities gives rise to a significant 'tail' of atoms moving at speeds greater than the escape velocity. The planet is estimated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>losing</b> about 100–500 million (1–5×108) kg of hydrogen per second. Analysis of the starlight passing through the envelope shows that the heavier carbon and oxygen atoms are being blown from the planet by the extreme [...] "hydrodynamic drag" [...] created by its evaporating hydrogen atmosphere. The hydrogen tail streaming from the planet is approximately 200,000 kilometres long, which is roughly equivalent to its diameter.|$|E

500|$|After {{moving away}} from Reunion, Connie {{accelerated}} towards the south around a subtropical ridge situated near Amsterdam Island. On January31, Connie turned southeast, steered about a trough to the southeast. Contrary to forecasts which predicted continued weakening, MFR kept the intensity at [...] for most of January31. Based on satellite derived intensity estimates, the JTWC briefly re-upgraded Connie to a Category1 hurricane equivalent on the SSHWS at 1800UTC. However, the re-strengthening trend was short lived due to increased northwesterly wind shear. Satellite imagery early on February1 revealed an exposed circulation and a rapid decreased of thunderstorm activity in bothy coverage and intensity. Based on this {{and the fact that}} the storm appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>losing</b> tropical characteristics, MFR issued its final advisory on Connie. However, the JTWC continued to track Connie until February2, when it merged with an extratropical low. At the time of dissipation, the JTWC assessed the intensity of Connie at [...]|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after his}} return to Russia, three British {{newspapers}} announced on 24 September 1906 that Michael was to marry Princess Patricia of Connaught, but neither he nor Patricia knew anything about it. Buckingham Palace issued a denial. Nevertheless, two years later, in October 1908, Michael visited London, and he and Patricia were [...] "paired" [...] at social engagements. It seems likely that Michael's mother was plotting to get him married to a more suitable bride and the originator of the false report, Reuters correspondent Guy Beringer, read too much into the plans. Michael and Dina were planning to elope, but their plans were stymied as Dina was under surveillance by the Okhrana, Nicholas's secret police, and she was prevented from travelling. Under family pressure and unable to see Dina, by August 1907 Michael appeared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>losing</b> interest. Dina went to live abroad. She never married and believed herself to be Michael's rightful fiancée, but their romance was over.|$|E

2500|$|Grandmaster Andrew Soltis {{considers}} St. Amant's swindle in St. Amant–Staunton, 9th match game, 1843 {{the greatest}} ever perpetrated in match history. In the position diagrammed at far left, White appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>losing</b> a piece. His queen is under attack, and if 32.Qe4 (to save his bishop on d3), Black plays 32...Ng5 33.Qg2 (for example) Rxd3 and wins. St. Amant produced 32.b5!!, which Staunton called, [...] "A desperate but masterly resource." [...] G.H. Diggle referred to it, equally accurately, as [...] "a move looking so irrelevant that everyone {{must have thought}} for a moment that it was merely a petulant way of resigning". Although it should not have saved the game, the move in fact has three points: (1) it attacks Black's bishop; (2) after 32...Rxd4 33.exd4 (threatening a back-rank mate and discovering an attack on Black's queen), it prevents the bishop from guarding the e8 square; and (3) after 32...Rxd4 33.exd4, it prevents the queen from defending e8 with 33...Qc6. Black nonetheless could have won with either (a) 32...Bd1! (threatening 33...Bxe2+) 33.Rxd1 Rxd4 34.exd4 Qh5 35.Be3 Qf3+ 36.Ke1 Re8 37.Kd2 Nf2 (Ossip Bernstein) or (b) 32...Rxd4 33.exd4 g5! 34.fxg6 Qh5!, when Black avoids being mated and himself threatens 35...Qf3+ and mate next move. Instead, Staunton played 32...Qh5? immediately. After St. Amant's 33.g4!, he should have played 33...Qh4 34.Qxa4 Rxd3. But shattered by the realization that he had thrown away a win, Staunton blundered again with 33...Rxd4?? 34.exd4! f6 35.gxh5 and Black resigned. The two winning lines for Black are sufficiently difficult that Staunton, annotating the game 16 years later in his Chess Player's Companion, gave neither of them, instead recommending a line leading to a probable draw by perpetual check.|$|E
