60|$|Half an {{hour later}} Brown and Jones were still playing trains on <b>the</b> <b>dining-room</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
60|$|Uncle Roger {{had gone}} to the station to meet the travellers, and <b>the</b> <b>dining-room</b> <b>table</b> was spread with a feast of fat things.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{found it}} lying on <b>the</b> <b>dining-room</b> <b>table</b> last evening, when I came from my room. You see, I {{had been lying}} down with a headache." ...|$|E
60|$|He welcomed Walstein with warmth. Mr. Revel led Madame to <b>the</b> <b>dining-room.</b> <b>The</b> <b>table</b> was round, and Walstein seated {{himself at}} her side.|$|R
60|$|In <b>the</b> <b>dining-room,</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> {{had only}} dirty plates and empty dishes on it. However the party--with the {{addition}} of a gentleman, as good-natured, and as rosy, as the children--seated themselves at it very contentedly.|$|R
6000|$|... "There will {{be about}} sixty guests, all told," [...] she said, {{as if she were}} {{thinking}} of nothing else. [...] "We must move the furniture out of this room and set the supper-table here. <b>The</b> <b>dining-room</b> is too small. We must borrow Mrs. Bell's forks and spoons. She offered to lend them. I'd never have been willing to ask her. The damask table cloths with the ribbon pattern must be bleached to-morrow. Nobody else in Avonlea has such tablecloths. And we'll put <b>the</b> little <b>dining-room</b> <b>table</b> on <b>the</b> hall landing, upstairs, for the presents." ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Lookaloft {{soon found}} herself on a sofa, and the Miss Lookalofts on two chairs, while Mr. Augustus {{stood near the}} door; and here they {{remained}} till in due time they were seated, all four together, {{at the bottom of}} <b>the</b> <b>dining-room</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
60|$|The Story Girl {{chose the}} latter alternative. She was highly indignant. I verily {{believe that to}} sit at <b>the</b> <b>dining-room</b> <b>table,</b> in that shabby, outgrown dress, {{conscious}} of looking her ugliest, and eating only bread and water before the critical Millwards would have been positive bliss to her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very good, {{you come}} look, miss," [...] and Jeekie propped {{up the case}} upon the end of <b>the</b> <b>dining-room</b> <b>table.</b> As from its height and {{position}} {{she could not see}} its contents very well whilst standing above it, Barbara knelt down {{to get a better view}} of it.|$|E
6000|$|I {{wondered}} {{what they were}} going to do the first evening a change of entertainment was proposed: they spoke of [...] "playing charades," [...] but in my ignorance I did not understand the term. The servants were called in, <b>the</b> <b>dining-room</b> <b>tables</b> wheeled away, <b>the</b> lights otherwise disposed, the chairs placed in a semicircle opposite the arch. While Mr. Rochester and the other gentlemen directed these alterations, the ladies were running up and down stairs ringing for their maids. Mrs. Fairfax was summoned to give information respecting the resources of the house in shawls, dresses, draperies of any kind; and certain wardrobes of the third storey were ransacked, and their contents, in the shape of brocaded and hooped petticoats, satin sacques, black modes, lace lappets, &c., were brought down in armfuls by the abigails; then a selection was made, and such things as were chosen were carried to the boudoir within the drawing-room.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a word!" [...] {{commanded}} Norcross; and {{the girl}} with a smile submitted to his guidance, and thereafter his efficiency, his self-possession, his tact delighted her. He persuaded the sullen landlady to get them supper. He secured the best rooms in the house, and arranged {{for the care of}} the team, and when they were all seated around the dim, fly-specked oil-lamp at the end of <b>the</b> crumby <b>dining-room</b> <b>table</b> he discovered such a gay and confident mien that the women looked at each other in surprise.|$|R
6000|$|... "AÃ¶h! That's her name. It's {{a pretty}} name." [...] He {{looked through the}} open door into <b>the</b> <b>dining-room,</b> where <b>the</b> <b>table</b> was set for breakfast, with the usual water-goblet at each plate. [...] "I see you have beer for breakfast. There's nothing so nice, you know. Would you--would you mind giving me a glahs?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Did Aunt Jane repent of her {{decision}} on the Thursday half-holiday granted to Mrs. Edgar's pupils, when, {{in the midst of}} the working party round <b>the</b> <b>dining-room</b> <b>table,</b> in a pause of the reading, some one said, 'What's that!'---and a humming, accompanied by a drip, drop, drip, drop, became audible? ...|$|E
60|$|The pain of {{the fumes}} was bad enough, but the real {{hardship}} was the dizziness I suffered. I blundered into the steward's pantry, and out of it, missed the cross-hall, stumbled through the next starboard opening in the long hall, and found myself bent double by violent collision with <b>the</b> <b>dining-room</b> <b>table.</b>|$|E
60|$|What Dick {{said was}} almost wholly true. The rascals had stolen {{everything}} of value {{that they could}} possibly carry, leaving behind little outside of the things already mentioned. Not only was the piano mutilated, but also the chairs, <b>the</b> <b>dining-room</b> <b>table,</b> and the berths in the stateroom. All of the lanterns but one were missing, and the small rowboat resting on the rear deck of the houseboat had its side stove in from an ax-blow.|$|E
60|$|As Stephen {{reached his}} place beside the Judge, Mr. James's effects were being cried. And, if glances could have killed, many a bidder would have dropped dead. <b>The</b> heavy <b>dining-room</b> <b>table</b> which {{meant so much}} to the family went for a song to a young man {{recently}} come from Yankeeland, whose open boast it was--like Eliphalet's secret one--that he would one day grow rich enough to snap his fingers {{in the face of the}} Southern aristocrats. Mr. James was not there. But Mr. Catherwood, his face haggard and drawn, watched the sideboard he had given his wife on her silver wedding being sold to a pawnbroker.|$|R
60|$|It is now {{the last}} day, and the desolation is {{thickening}} upon our hotel. This morning the door-posts {{up and down my}} corridor showed not a single pair of trousers; not a pair of boots flattered the lonely doormats. In the lower hall I found the <b>tables</b> of <b>the</b> great <b>dining-room</b> assembled, and <b>the</b> chairs inverted on them with their legs in the air; but decently, decorously, not with the reckless abandon displayed by the chairs in our Long Island hotel for weeks before it closed. In <b>the</b> smaller <b>dining-room</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> was set for lunch as if we were to go on dining there forever; in the breakfast-room the service and the provision were as perfect as ever. The coffee was good, the bread delicious, the butter of an unfaltering sweetness; and the glaze of wear on the polished dress-coats of the waiters as respectable as it could have been {{on the first day of}} the season. All was correct, and if of a funereal correctness to me, I am sure this effect was purely subjective.|$|R
6000|$|They {{began with}} the office and the parlor, where they flung up the windows, and opened the doors, and then they opened <b>the</b> <b>dining-room,</b> where <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> stood in long rows, with the chairs piled on them legs upward. Cynthia went about with many sighs for the dust on everything, though to Westover's eyes it all seemed frigidly clean. [...] "If it goes on {{as it has for}} the past two years," [...] she said, [...] "we shall have to add on a new dining-room. I don't know as I like to have it get so large!" ...|$|R
60|$|An evening {{newspaper}} was on <b>the</b> <b>dining-room</b> <b>table.</b> The candles were lit. He sat down, {{and tried to}} read. No! There {{was nothing in the}} newspaper that he cared about. The time for hearing from the lawyer was drawing nearer and nearer. Reading was of no use. Sitting still was of no use. He got up, and went out {{in the front of the}} cottage--strolled to the gate--opened it--and looked idly up and down the road.|$|E
6000|$|... "I went in {{and there}} was my father fallen forward on <b>the</b> <b>dining-room</b> <b>table,</b> with blood coming from his lips, though I believe this {{was caused by a}} crushed wineglass. His pocket-book was open beneath him, in which he had been writing figures of his estate, and, I think, {{headings}} for the will he meant to make, but these I could not read since the faint pencilling was blotted out with blood. He was quite dead from some kind of a stroke followed by heart failure, as the doctors said." ...|$|E
6000|$|It was {{cruel to}} see the {{enjoyment}} {{he got out of}} teasing this woman by an ironical jargon which mystified her into madness. This time he went too far. With an inarticulate snarl of passion she lifted a knife that lay on <b>the</b> <b>dining-room</b> <b>table</b> and made for him. But this time, being prepared, he was not alarmed; nay, he seemed to take leasure in the success of his plan of tormenting. The heavy escritoire at which he sat was a breastwork between him and the angry woman. He coolly opened a drawer; produced a revolver, and remarked: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then without it." [...] With a quick {{movement}} Holmes {{pushed the}} fellow {{to one side}} and passed into the hall. A door half opened stood immediately before us. We entered. It was <b>the</b> <b>dining-room.</b> On <b>the</b> <b>table,</b> under a half-lit chandelier, the coffin was lying. Holmes turned up the gas and raised the lid. Deep down in the recesses of the coffin lay an emaciated figure. The glare from the lights above beat down upon an aged and withered face. By no possible process of cruelty, starvation, or disease could this worn-out wreck be the still beautiful Lady Frances. Holmes's face showed his amazement, and also his relief.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{historical}} {{evidence from the}} Byzantine and Medieval periods also show that Khirbet Kana was regarded as the true site of New Testament Cana from a very early period. A guidebook written by a certain Theodosius between 517-527 CE titled The Layout of The Holy Land identifies Khirbet Kana, and indicates {{that two of the}} vessels were still at the location. A pilgrim account written by Saewulf in 1101-1103 CE also identifies the site, as do Belard of Ascoli (c. 1155 CE) and Dominican friar Burchard of Mount Sion (1283 CE), and a map by noted cartographer Petrus Vesconte in 1321 CE. Burchard of Mount Sion also describes a cave complex located there which was used as a veneration site where [...] "the place is shown at this day where the six water pots stood, and <b>the</b> <b>dining-room</b> where <b>the</b> <b>tables</b> were placed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{brings me}} to the romantic part of my letter, and I will say at [...] once that we found your friend Mr. Durgin in Florence, in the very [...] hotel we went to. We all met in <b>the</b> <b>dining-room,</b> at <b>the</b> <b>table</b> [...] d'hote one evening, and Genevieve and he took to each other at once. [...] He spent the evening with us in our private drawing-room, and she [...] said to me, after he went, {{that for the first time}} in years she felt [...] rested. It seems that she had always {{secretly}} fancied him, and that [...] she gave up to me in the matter of marrying poor Gigi, because she [...] knew I had my heart set upon it, and she was not very certain of her [...] own feelings when Mr. D. offered himself in Boston; but the [...] conviction that she had made a mistake grew upon, her more and more [...] after she had married Gigi.|$|R
60|$|In the {{assistant}} engineer's bungalow Spurstow and Hummil smoked the pipe of silence together, each narrowly watching the other. The {{capacity of a}} bachelor's establishment is as elastic as its arrangements are simple. A servant cleared away <b>the</b> <b>dining-room</b> <b>table,</b> brought {{in a couple of}} rude native bedsteads made of tape strung on a light wood frame, flung a square of cool Calcutta matting over each, set them side by side, pinned two towels to the punkah so that their fringes should just sweep clear of the sleepers' nose and mouth, and announced that the couches were ready.|$|E
60|$|The {{architect}} who was brother of Pierce's friend {{appeared as a}} small, alert individual with a black bag and a cylindrical silk hat, and he sat at <b>the</b> <b>dining-room</b> <b>table,</b> with his hat and his bag exactly equidistant right and left of him, and maintained a demeanour of impressive woodenness, while Kipps on the hearthrug, with a quaking sense of gigantic enterprise, vacillated answers to his enquiries. Ann held a watching brief for herself, in a position she had chosen as suitable to the occasion beside {{the corner of the}} carved oak sideboard. They felt, in a sense, at bay.|$|E
60|$|After {{which we}} brooded for a bit. Uncle Willoughby pottered about the room, {{registering}} baffledness, while I sat sucking at a cigarette, feeling {{rather like a}} chappie I'd once read about in a book, who murdered another cove and hid the body under <b>the</b> <b>dining-room</b> <b>table,</b> {{and then had to}} be the life and soul of a dinner party, with it there all the time. My guilty secret oppressed me {{to such an extent that}} after a while I couldn't stick it any longer. I lit another cigarette and started for a stroll in the grounds, by way of cooling off.|$|E
60|$|There {{were other}} drawings, {{if not all}} by the same hand, at least by the same school; one, sketched in bold strokes, of a dinner party in a stately neo-classic <b>dining-room,</b> <b>the</b> <b>table</b> laden with flowers and silver, the bare-throated women with jewels. A more {{critical}} eye than Lise's, gazing upon this portrayal of the Valhalla of success, might have detected in the young men, immaculate in evening dress, a certain effort to feel at home, to converse naturally, which their square jaws and square shoulders belied. This was no doubt {{the fault of the}} artist's models, who had {{failed to live up to}} the part. At any rate, the sight of these young gods of leisure, the contemplation of the stolid butler and plush footmen in the background never failed to make Lise's heart beat faster.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to all these duties, he also single-handedly plotted out league schedules each season on his <b>dining-room</b> <b>table</b> by using a giant checkerboard. He created the revenue-sharing system that enables the small-market teams to make larger profits and remain competitive.|$|R
50|$|Charles and his wife, Teresa, founded The Michigan Citizen {{newspaper}} on their <b>dining-room</b> <b>table</b> in Benton Harbor, Michigan, in November 1978. He grew the paper from a 12-page tabloid with an original circulation of 3000 {{distributed in the}} Benton Harbor area to a 16-page broadsheet with a statewide circulation of 56,000.|$|R
60|$|We kindled the fires, {{weighed the}} turkey, {{put it in}} the oven and {{prepared}} the vegetables. Then we set <b>the</b> <b>dining-room</b> <b>table</b> and decorated it with Aunt Susanna's potted ferns and dishes of lovely red apples. Everything went so smoothly that we soon forgot to be nervous. When the turkey was done, we took it out, set it {{on the back of the}} range to keep warm and put the mince pies in. The potatoes, cabbage and turnips were bubbling away cheerfully, and everything was going as merrily as a marriage bell. Then, all at once, things happened.|$|E
60|$|Well {{they had}} an amazing time then, of course. They laughed and {{questioned}} and explained until the dinner was in imminent danger of getting stone-cold on <b>the</b> <b>dining-room</b> <b>table.</b> Luckily, Alma and Frances remembered it just {{in the nick of}} time, and they all got out, somehow, and into their places. It was a splendid dinner, but I believe that Maxwell and Bertha Seeley didn't know what they were eating, any more than if it had been sawdust. However, the rest of the guests made up for that, and did full justice to the girls' cookery.|$|E
60|$|Where {{should the}} middle-aged Jones be? At his time of life, {{he ought to}} be the father of a family. At such an hour--say, at nine o'clock at night--the nursery-bell should have just rung the {{children}} to bed. He and Mrs. J. ought to be, by rights, seated {{on each side of the}} fire by <b>the</b> <b>dining-room</b> <b>table,</b> a bottle of port-wine between them, not so full as it was an hour since. Mrs. J. has had two glasses; Mrs. Grumble (Jones's mother-in-law) has had three; Jones himself has finished the rest, and dozes comfortably until bed-time.|$|E
50|$|The {{center was}} founded in 1965 by Clyde S. Kilby. In 2001 a new {{building}} was completed {{at the edge of}} the Wheaton College campus to house the Wade Center, with an expanded reading room, classroom space, and an enlarged exhibits area. C. S. Lewis's <b>dining-room</b> <b>table,</b> which used to serve as desk space for visiting researchers, has been moved into the exhibits area near the Wade's own Lewis wardrobe.|$|R
5000|$|The tenth Earl of Huntingdon was the Countess of Moira's brother; when he died, a {{year after}} her husband, seated at her son's <b>dining-room</b> <b>table,</b> she was <b>the</b> only {{surviving}} sister, and her sisters had had no children; so she inherited the baronies (but continued {{to be known as}} Countess of Moira). Since the Earldom had been created with descent to heirs male, it went to their cousin, Theophilus Henry Hastings, 11th Earl of Huntingdon.|$|R
60|$|He escaped and, {{between the}} main room and <b>the</b> <b>dining-room,</b> {{penetrated}} a small den filled with witty young men, old stories, cigarette-smoke, and siphons. Then he charged into <b>the</b> <b>dining-room,</b> where there were candles and plate much like silver--and Ruth and Olive at the farther end.|$|R
