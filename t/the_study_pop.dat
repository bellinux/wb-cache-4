40|$|Background and Objectives: Alternative {{medicine}} (AM) encompasses {{all forms}} of therapies that fall outside the mainstream of medical practice. Its popularity is on the increase. Because previous surveys were limited and not generalizable, we estimated the prevalence, pattern and factors associated with use of AM in the community. Subjects and Methods: A multistage cluster cross-sectional household survey was conducted among Saudi residents of the Riyadh region. Data were collected in 2003 by trained interviewers from primary health care centers using a specially designed questionnaire. Results: Of 1408 individuals participating in the study, 39 &#x 0025; were men. The mean (&#x 00 B 1;SD) age for <b>the</b> <b>study</b> <b>pop</b> [...] ulation was 35. 5 (&#x 00 B 1; 13. 9) years. Sixty-eight {{percent of the respondents}} had used AM during the last 12 months. The Holy Quran as a therapy was the most frequently used AM (50. 3 &#x 0025;), followed by honey (40. 1 &#x 0025;), black seed (39. 2 &#x 0025;) and myrrh (35. 4 &#x 0025;). The health belief model was found {{to be the most important}} determinant of AM use. Factors independently associated with AM use included perceived failure of medical treatment, the perceived success of AM, a preference for natural materials, and long appointment intervals to see physicians. Conclusions and Recommendations: There is a high prevalence of AM use in the Riyadh region and the most important determinant of AM use was the perceived failure of medical treatment. The study results call for intensive health education campaigns in the media addressing wrong beliefs regarding AM and modern medicine. The popularity of AM in this community should alert decision makers to look at the difficult accessibility to the health system...|$|E

Environ Heabh Perspect 105 : 424429 (1997) Large regions of North America, including the Northern California coastal mountains, are rich in inorganic mercury ores, particularly cinnabar (HgS) (1). Elevated environmental concentrations of mercury occur in these regions (2). Inorganic mercury vapor (Hg 0) is readily absorbed and neurotoxic (3). Human uptake of cinnabar, however, has not been studied. Environmental mechanisms transform inorganic mercury to organic mercury. Organic mercury accumulates in the food chain, is efficiently absorbed, crosses the blood-brain and placenta barriers, and is neurotoxic and teratogenic (3). These effects were recognized in the 1960 s when consumption of contaminated fish in Minamata, Japan, resulted in neurological effects, including cerebral palsy and death (4, 5).

40|$|Fall {{spawning}} {{pacific salmon}} provision {{large amounts of}} yolk to their eggs to allow survival of larvae during under the ice winter conditions. This yolk provisioning leads to maternal offloading of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) to eggs and larvae. Previous {{research has shown that}} Chinook salmon larvae exhibit limited capacity to eliminate POPs during the cold water period resulting in bioamplification of <b>POP</b> residues. This <b>study</b> compared <b>POPs</b> bioamplification in Chinook salmon larvae under a high food provisioning treatment and a non-fed treatment to test whether or not food availability attenuates POPs bioamplification via growth dilution. Results demonstrate that larvae in the food provisioning treatment did not gain weight until after day 129. Between hatching and day 129, fed and non-fed treatments exhibited similar decreases in whole body lipid content, negligible POPs elimination and POPs bioamplification factors approaching 1. 6. By day 184 of <b>the</b> <b>study,</b> <b>POPs</b> bioamplification factors in the non-fed treatment were as high as 5. 3 across chemicals but ranged from non-detectable to approaching 1 in the fed group. This <b>study</b> demonstrates that <b>POPs</b> bioamplification occurs in Chinook salmon larvae even under ideal rearing conditions but peaks after day 129, following which growth dilution can attenuate bioamplification relative to starved individuals.

40|$|Polyurethane foam (PUF) disk passive air {{samplers}} {{were deployed}} concurrently at five sites across Kolkata megacity and the rural mangrove wetland of Sundarban (UNESCO World Heritage Site) between January–March in 2014. Samples were analyzed for hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), dichlorodiphenyltricholoroethanes (DDTs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Derived air concentrations (pg/m 3) for Kolkata ranged: for ∑α- and γ-HCH between 70 and 207 (114 ± 62), ∑ 6 DDTs: 127 – 216 (161 ± 36), ∑ 7 PCBs: 53 – 213 (141 ± 64), and ∑ 10 PBDEs: 0. 30 – 23 (11 ± 9). Low values for all <b>the</b> <b>studied</b> <b>POPs</b> {{were recorded in}} the remote area of the Sundarban site (with the exception of DDTs: o,p’-DDT and p,p’-DDT), where ∑ 4 DDTs was 161 ± 36. In particular, the site of Ballygunge, located {{in the southern part}} of Kolkata, showed the highest level of all the metabolites/congeners of POPs, suggesting a potential hot spot of usage and emissions. From HCHs, α-/γ-HCH isomers ratio was low (0. 67 – 1. 96) indicating a possible sporadic source of lindane. γ-HCH dominated the HCH signal (at 3 sites) reflecting wide spread use of lindane both in Kolkata and the Sundarban region; however, isomeric composition in Kolkata also suggests potential technical HCHs use. Among DDT metabolites, both o,p’-DDT and p,p’-DDT shared the dominant percentages accounting for ∼ 26 – 46 % of total DDTs followed by p,p’-DDE (∼ 12 – 19 %). The PCB congener profile was dominated by tri- and tetra-Cl at the southern and eastern part of Kolkata. These results are one of the few contributions that reports air concentrations of POPs, concurrently, at urban and remote villages in India. These data are useful to assess atmospheric pollution levels and to motivate local and regional authorities to better understand the potential human exposure risk associated to urban areas in India...|$|R

40|$|The {{impact of}} {{pollution}} caused by severe anthropogenic {{pressure in the}} Mediterranean Sea, an important biodiversity hotspot, requires continuous research efforts. Sources of highly toxic chemicals such as Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) are misunderstood in representative Mediterranean species, which limits our capability to establish proper conservation strategies. In <b>the</b> present <b>study,</b> eggs of Audouin's and yellow-legged gulls (Larus audouinii and L. michahellis) were used to investigate the trophic sources, as measured by δ 13 C, δ 15 N, and δ 34 S, of legacy POPs, in particular, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans (PCDD/Fs) and non-ortho polychlorinated biphenyls (no-PCBs), as well as recently-regulated POPs, e. g., polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Special {{attention was paid to}} the usefulness of rarely-explored δ 34 S ratios in explaining POP exposure in wildlife, and δ 34 S was the isotopic ratio that best explained POP variations among gulls in most cases, thus demonstrating its usefulness for understanding POP exposure in wildlife. Significant relationships between stable isotope signatures and POP concentrations revealed increasing levels of no-PCBs and low halogenated PCDD/Fs and PBDEs in Mediterranean gulls as the consumption of marine resources increases. In contrast, highly chlorinated and brominated congeners appeared to preferentially accumulate in gulls feeding primarily on refuse from dump sites and terrestrial food webs. The use of suitable dietary tracers in <b>the</b> <b>study</b> of <b>POPs</b> in yellow-legged gulls revealed the importance of dump sites as a source of POPs in Mediterranean seabirds, which has not previously been reported. In contrast, the preferential accumulation through marine food webs of low chlorinated PCCD/Fs and no-PCBs, which show the highest toxic equivalents factors (TEFs), led to a significantly greater toxicological concern in Audouin's as compared to yellow-legged gulls.
