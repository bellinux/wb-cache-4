5000|$|The use {{of persuasion}} to achieve {{compliance}} has numerous applications in interpersonal interactions. One party can utilize persuasion techniques to elicit a preferred response from other individuals. Compliance strategies exploit psychological processes {{in order to}} prompt a desired outcome; however, they do not necessarily lead to private acceptance by the targeted individual. [...] Meaning, an individual may comply with a request without truly believing the action(s) they {{are being asked to}} complete is acceptable. Because of this, persuasion techniques are often used one-sidedly in immediate situations where one individual wishes to provoke a specific response from another individual. For example, car salesmen frequently use the lowball technique to manipulate customers' psychological functioning by convincing them to comply with a request. By initially estimating a car's price to be lower than actuality, car salesmen recognize that the customer is more likely to accept a higher price at a later <b>time.</b> <b>Compliance</b> strategies (i.e., lowball, foot-in-the-door, etc.) are relevant to numerous person-to-person interactions when persuasion is involved.

5000|$|The company paid a {{total of}} about $1.6 billion, around $800 million in each of the US and Germany. This was the largest bribery fine in history, at the time. The money paid to Germany {{included}} a $270 million fine paid the year before (related to bribes in Nigeria). The US payment included $450 million in fines and penalties and a forfeiture of $350 million in profits. [...] The company was also obligated to spend $1 billion on setting up and funding new internal compliance regimens. [...] Siemens pleaded guilty to violating accounting provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act; the parent company did plead guilty to paying bribes (although its Bangladesh and Venezuela subsidiaries did); such a guilty plea would have barred Siemens from contracting for the US government. [...] As the scandal had started breaking, Siemens had fired its chairman and CEO Heinrich von Pierer, and had hired its first non-German CEO. Peter Löscher; it also had appointed a US lawyer, Peter Solmssen as an independent director to its board, in charge of compliance, and had accepted oversight of Theo Waigel, a former German finance minister, as a [...] "compliance monitor". [...] The compliance overhaul eventually entailed hiring around 500 full <b>time</b> <b>compliance</b> personnel worldwide. Siemens also enacted a series of new anti-corruption compliance policies, including a new anti-corruption handbook, web-based tools for due diligence and compliance, a confidential communications channel for employees to report irregular business practices, and a corporate disciplinary committee to impose appropriate disciplinary measures for substantiated misconduct.|$|E

40|$|A {{business}} process is {{above all else}} a social interaction among multiple participants. Business process modeling languages support the description of {{business process}}es in operational terms as collections of interleaved activities conducted by human and software agents. However, such descriptions do not capture adequately the richness of social interaction among participants. To address this deficiency, we propose Azzurra, a specification language for modeling and executing business processes. Azzurra is founded on social concepts, such as roles, agents and commitments among them, and Azzurra specifications are social models consisting of sets of commitments. As such, Azzurra specifications support flexible executions of business processes, and provide a semantic notion of actor accountability and business process compliance. In this paper, we present syntax and semantics of Azzurra, and we propose algorithms to determine run- <b>time</b> <b>compliance</b> with an Azzurra social specification...|$|E

40|$|Compliance of {{business}} processes {{is becoming increasingly}} important in the domain {{of business}} process design. Despite that, human process designers must be able to concentrate on the business goals which a business process needs to fulfil. Compliance aspects of the business process should not be in the main focus of the human process designer during the development phase. Therefore, tools must support human process designers in developing compliant business processes. In this paper we introduce the concept of compliance scopes. Compliance scopes are areas in a business process where certain compliance conditions must hold. These conditions are attached to the compliance scopes. Compliance scopes can be applied to existing business process models as well as to process templates. In this way compliance rules are applied to certain areas of a business process. During design <b>time,</b> <b>compliance</b> scopes can be used in graphical workbenches to evaluate modifications to business processes...|$|E

40|$|Key {{to the use}} {{of process}} {{management}} systems (PrMS) in practice is their ability to facilitate the implementation, execution, and adaptation of business processes while still being able to ensure error-free process executions. Mechanisms have been developed to prevent errors at the syntactic level such as deadlocks. In many application domains, processes often have to comply with business level rules and policies (i. e., semantic constraints). Hence, in order to ensure error-free executions at the semantic level, PrMS need certain control mechanisms for validating and ensuring the compliance with semantic constraints throughout the process lifecycle. In this paper, we discuss fundamental requirements for a comprehensive support of semantic constraints in PrMS. Moreover, we provide a survey on existing approaches and discuss to what extent they meet the requirements and which challenges still have to be tackled.

We experimentally manipulated institutional complexity and gauged the <b>time</b> to <b>compliance</b> of 100 childcare managers in the Netherlands, and then asked them to describe and explain their anticipated responses to multiple pressures. We found that institutional complexity leads decision makers to delay compliance, but usually not passively: decision makers used the <b>time</b> before <b>compliance</b> to attempt to reduce institutional complexity by neutralizing opposing pressures, challenging the coercive pressure, adapting the practice to suit opponents and their own personal beliefs, and/or waiting {{to see how the}} situation would unfold as multiple parties influenced one another.
