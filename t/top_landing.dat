25|$|Originally {{access to}} the deep-tube {{platforms}} was by a lift. Each lift was staffed, and at some quiet stations in the 1920s the ticket office was moved into the lift, or it was arranged that the lift could be controlled from the ticket office. The first escalator on the London Underground was installed in 1911 between the District and Piccadilly platforms at Earl's Court and from the following year new deep-level stations were provided with escalators instead of lifts. The escalators had a diagonal shunt at the <b>top</b> <b>landing.</b> In 1921 a recorded voice instructed passengers {{to stand on the}} right and signs followed in World War II. Travellers were asked to stand on the right so that anyone wishing to overtake them would have a clear passage {{on the left side of}} the escalator. The first 'comb' type escalator was installed in 1924 at Clapham Common. In the 1920s and 1930s many lifts were replaced by escalators. After the fatal 1987 King's Cross fire, all wooden escalators were replaced with metal ones and the mechanisms are regularly degreased to lower the potential for fires. The only wooden escalator not to be replaced was at Greenford station, which remained until October 2015 when TfL replaced it with the first incline lift on the UK transport network.|$|E

40|$|The {{formation}} of carbonaceous engine deposits {{is a long}} standing and well documented phenomenon limiting the lifetime of diesel engines. Carbon remnants coat the surfaces of the combustion chamber, piston, and valves. As piston deposits thicken, they {{increase the risk of}} a power cylinder seizure. More restrictive emission standards require careful power cylinder design to control piston deposits, specifically in the <b>top</b> <b>land</b> and <b>top</b> ring groove. Experimental studies on heavy duty diesel engines show a non-uniform pattern of carbon deposits on the <b>top</b> <b>land.</b> The degradation of engine lubricant is typically understood to be source of deposits. A theoretical study was begun to understand the effects of harsh operating environment that leads to degradation. A thin-film, transient, mass and heat transfer simulation of the <b>top</b> <b>land</b> was formulated, which utilizes the results of a combustion chamber CFD simulation as input data. by Thomas Patrick Grimley.

The subsurface crack(s) was found to have initiated {{at the bottom of the}} dedendum and propagated progressively upward. The spalled region encompassed the <b>top</b> <b>land</b> of the tooth as well. Evidences suggest that excessive contact stresses and gear tip biting were responsible for the early initiation of spalling.

40|$|Carbonaceous {{deposits}} {{have long}} plagued the internal combustion engine, yet a fundamental comprehension of their underlying causes {{remains to be}} developed. In particular, piston land deposits can bring about an array of problems; for example, once a thickness threshold is crossed, the engine's reliability is threatened by an elevated possibility of seizure. As tightening emissions regulations continue to place more stringent constraints on power cylinder design, control of piston deposits, specifically in the <b>top</b> <b>land</b> and <b>top</b> ring groove, is becoming ever more difficult. Tests run on a heavy duty diesel engine revealed the piston land carbon deposit distribution to be circumferentially nonuniform, and a theoretical inquiry was invoked to investigate the cause. Since these deposits are typically lubricant derived, a three-dimensional, unsteady model of the oil film attached to a piston land was formulated. Focus {{was placed on the}} <b>top</b> <b>land,</b> in order to explore the effects of both reciprocating inertia and combustion-driven gas flows on the film's motion and thickness distribution. The numerical simulation created uses results from a realistic CFD simulation of the combustion process as input data. It was found that the gas velocities can have a profound effect. The gases create interesting wav...|$|R

6000|$|... 'What a finger!' says Mrs. Ponto; {{and indeed}} it WAS a finger, as knotted as a turkey's drumstick, and {{splaying}} {{all over the}} piano. When she had banged out the tune slowly, she began a different manner of 'Gettin' up Stairs,' and did so with a fury and swiftness quite incredible. She spun up stairs; she whirled up stairs: she galloped up stairs; she rattled up stairs; and then having got the tune to the <b>top</b> <b>landing,</b> as it were, she hurled it down again shrieking to the bottom floor, where it sank in a crash as if exhausted by the breathless rapidity of the descent. Then Miss Wirt played the 'Gettin' up Stairs' with the most pathetic and ravishing solemnity: plaintive moans and sobs issued from the keys--you wept and trembled as you were gettin' up stairs. Miss Wirt's hands seemed to faint and wail and die in variations: again, and she went up with a savage clang and rush of trumpets, as if Miss Wirt was storming a breach; and although I knew nothing of music, as I sat and listened with my mouth open to this wonderful display, my CAFFY grew cold, and I wondered the windows did not crack and the chandelier start out of the beam {{at the sound of}} this earthquake of a piece of music.|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanism}} of oil loss past pistons {{was investigated in}} a laboratory test rig in which a piston was both reciprocated and subjected to gas pressures. The investigation brought to light the following facts and {{it is believed that}} this is the first time that they have been demonstrated: (1) Oil control is a two-way and not a one-way problem. The only reason why the rate of oil consumption is reasonably small in most engines is that, although a large amount of oil flows towards the combustion chamber past the rings during part of the engine cycle, nearly all of it returns to the sump during the remainder of the cycle. (2) The various routes permit surprisingly large rates of oil flow in both directions past rings. This applies even with good rings. (3) If oil is added to the combustion chamber, a good ring arrangement will pass it to the sump at a rate up to many thousand times larger than the normal rate of oil consump-tion with the same arrangement. (4) The piston <b>lands,</b> and the <b>top</b> <b>land</b> in particular, play an important role in deciding the rate of oil consumption. If some oil has passed the rings it may be thrown into the com-bustion chamber and be lost; alternatively, an effective <b>top</b> <b>land</b> may retain this oil until by one method or another it is returned to the sump...|$|R
