5|$|In {{analyzing}} {{the creation of}} the Polish Legions, many historians have argued that Napoleon used the Poles as a source of recruits and had little desire <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> re-creation of the Polish state. Among the most notable of Napoleon's contemporary Polish detractors was Kościuszko, who refused to join the Legions, arguing that Napoleon would not restore Poland in any durable form. In this regard, Kościuszko also stated that the Duchy of Warsaw was created in 1807 only because it was expedient, rather than because Napoleon supported Polish sovereignty. Nevertheless, the memory of Napoleon's Polish Legions is strong in Poland, and Napoleon himself is often regarded as a hero and liberator there. About the Polish Legion, Napoleon himself is reputed to have said that 800 Poles would equal 8,000 enemy soldiers.|$|E

In revenge, Jake illegally manipulates the market by spreading rumors about the nationalization of a foreign oil field which Church has invested in. The company loses $120 million, but Bretton gives Jake a job, impressed by his initiative.

5|$|The {{college is}} {{actively}} involved in the development and use of assistive technology to aid visually impaired people in their everyday lives. For example, working with a United States-based software engineer, RNC produced the T3 (Talking Tactile Tablet), a touch sensitive device for interpreting tactile images such as diagrams, charts and maps. The device is connected to a computer and run with a programme CD, and has a tactile surface which produces touchable icons that provide audio feedback when they are pressed. The device was originally developed for educational purposes but can be adapted for other uses. In 2005 Hereford Museum and Art Gallery became the first in the United Kingdom <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> technology.

5|$|In 2002 LeMond {{joined with}} his parents-in-law David and Sacia Morris, friend Michael Snow and J.P. Morgan & Co. fund manager Jorge Jasson <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{exclusive}} Yellowstone Club, a Big Sky, Montana private ski and golf community founded by timber baron Tim Blixseth {{and his wife}} Edra. Each of the five partners paid Blixseth $750,000 for one percent shares in the exclusive resort. LeMond also purchased several building lots and maintained a property at the resort. Four years later LeMond and partners sued Blixseth in 2006 following reports of a Credit Suisse loan to the resort of $375million from which Blixseth reportedly took $209million in a disputed partial payout for his ownership stake. The Credit Suisse loan {{was based on a}} $1.16billion Cushman & Wakefield valuation of the resort, for which LeMond and partners each sought $11.6million for their one-percent shares. In 2007, LeMond settled his suit with the Blixseths for $39million; however, he and his partners remained creditors as the Blixseths defaulted on a $20million payment (after having already paid the group $18 million), followed by their divorce and the bankruptcy of the Club in 2009.|$|E

5|$|Richard Arkwright junior was {{uninterested in}} the cotton business, and {{after the death of}} his father the Arkwright family ceased <b>to</b> <b>invest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> industry. The Strutt family {{continued}} to invest, fuelled by the profits of their mills in Milford and Belper. They continued building mills into the 1810s, and by 1833 their business employed 2,000people and had dominated the cotton industry in the Derwent Valley. As Arkwright had done at Cromford, the Strutts provided housing for their employees. Belper was already an established village with its own market before Jedediah Strutt began building mills, so he was not required to have as active a role in developing the community into a self-sustaining entity as Richard Arkwright did at Cromford. The Strutts provided education, and in 1817 650 and 300children attended Sunday Schools in Belper and Milford respectively. Compared with Cromford, whose population had plateaued at around 1,200 in the early 19th century, the population of Belper rose from 4,500 in 1801 to 7,890 in 1831 due to the prosperity of the business. Darley Abbey also expanded as a worker's settlement although it had no market place, so providing food for the inhabitants was problematic. The settlement doubled in size between 1788 and 1801, and between 1801 and 1831 the population increased from 615 to 1,170 with the addition of much worker's housing. A Sunday School for 80children was established in one of the mills and a church and school were built in 1819 and 1826 respectively.|$|E
