5|$|A new {{station was}} built in 1897, {{slightly}} to the southeast, behind the Lovell Block. In 1927, the Fitchburg Cutoff became freight-only between the Alewife area and Somerville Junction. Passenger trains from the Lexington Branch and the Central Massachusetts Railroad were diverted to the Fitchburg mainline and began <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> Cambridge station. In 1937, the Boston and Maine Railroad built a two-story brick depot by the bridge, with the ticket office at street level and the waiting room and platforms below.|$|E
5|$|Ibrahim, {{furious with}} the response, ordered {{an attack on}} northwestern Mani from Kalamata on June 23, 1826. Under his command was a force of 7,000 men, a mixture of {{infantry}} and cavalry. The invaders were forced <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> the fortifications of the Maniots at Vergas near Almiro. Defending the walls were 2,000 Maniot soldiers and 500 Greek refugees.|$|E
5|$|On the homeward voyage from China, a storm damaged Taunton Castle {{and forced}} the ship <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> Ambonya on 16 September 1797.

50|$|The daytime {{services}} (Intercity IC), {{while not}} freuquent and {{limited to one}} or two trains per route, are essential in providing access to cities and towns off the railway's mainline network. The main routes are Trieste <b>to</b> Rome (<b>stopping</b> <b>at</b> Venice, Bologna, Prato, Florence and Arezzo), Milan <b>to</b> Rome (<b>stopping</b> <b>at</b> Genoa, La Spezia, Pisa and Livorno / <b>stopping</b> <b>at</b> Parma, Modena, Bologna, Prato, Florence and Arezzo), Bologna <b>to</b> Lecce (<b>stopping</b> <b>at</b> Rimini, Ancona, Pescara, Bari and Brindisi) and Rome to Reggio di Calabria (<b>stopping</b> <b>at</b> Latina and Naples). In addition, the Intercity trains provide a more economical means of long-distance rail travel within Italy.|$|R

5|$|The safety car was {{deployed}} {{an unprecedented}} four {{times during the}} course of the race. One of these periods was due to Robert Kubica's crash, which resulted in him suffering a sprained ankle and concussion. During the race Felipe Massa and Giancarlo Fisichella were disqualified for failing <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> the end of the pit lane when the exit was closed.|$|E
5|$|An Admiralty {{memorandum}} set out {{the detailed}} instructions. The first requirement was to resolve disagreements in the earlier surveys about the longitude of Rio de Janeiro, which was essential as the base point for meridian distances. The accurate marine chronometers needed to determine longitude had only become affordable since 1800; the Beagle carried 22 chronometers to allow corrections. The ship was <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> specified points for four-day rating of the chronometers and to check them by astronomical observations: it was essential to take observations at Porto Praya and Fernando de Noronha to calibrate against the previous surveys of Owen and Foster. It was important to survey {{the extent of the}} Abrolhos Archipelago reefs, shown incorrectly in Roussin's survey, then proceed to Rio de Janeiro to decide the exact longitude of Villegagnon Island.|$|E
5|$|During the Blizzard of 1996, on January 6, a Metro {{operator}} {{was killed}} when a train failed <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> the Shady Grove station. The four-car train overran the station platform and struck an unoccupied train that was awaiting assignment. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) investigation found that the crash {{was a result of}} a failure in the train's computer-controlled braking system. The NTSB recommended that Metro grant train operators the ability to manually control the braking system, even in inclement weather, and recommended that Metro prohibit parked rail cars on tracks used by incoming outbound trains.|$|E

5|$|Ibrahim {{tried to}} enter Mani from the {{north-east}} near Almiro on June 21, 1826, {{but he was}} forced <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> the fortifications at Vergas. His army of 7,000 men was held off by an army of 2,000 Maniots and 500 refugees {{from other parts of}} Greece. Despite Egyptian and Ottoman artillery, the outnumbered Maniots managed to hold off the Ottomans. Ibrahim sent 1,500 men to attempt a landing near Areopolis and go north to threaten the Maniot rear. This force was initially successful; however they were repelled with heavy losses. When the Egyptians at Vergas heard that Theodoros Kolokotronis was advancing on their rear they retreated.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, the Sognsvann Line {{was closed}} {{during the summer}} {{vacations}} due to improvements of the track and third rail. In 2008, the line was closed for approximately one week, due to leaves that had covered the tracks. The operation of the line was replaced by buses that served temporary stops in Nordbergveien and Sognsveien. In 2010, a truck was stuck under the train bridge between Holstein and Kringsjå over Carl Kjeldsens vei. The bridge was damaged, and allowed for only one-way-traffic for two weeks. Half the trains had <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> Berg in the meantime.|$|E
5|$|The Port of Calais was {{the first}} cable ship port in Europe and is the fourth largest port in France and the largest for {{passenger}} traffic. The port {{accounts for more than}} a third of economic activity of the town of Calais. Cargo traffic has tripled over the past two decades. In 2007 more than 41.5 million tonnes of traffic passed through Calais with some 11.52 million passengers, 1.4 million trucks and trailers, 2.249 million cars and 4,700 crossings a year. On average, ships sail from the port every 30 minutes. A new 400 million euro project is underway at the port to create a breakwater protecting a pool of 700 meters long, thus allowing virtually all types of ships <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> Calais.|$|E

5|$|The {{wealth of}} Allosaurus fossils, from nearly all ages of individuals, allows {{scientists}} {{to study how}} the animal grew and how long its lifespan may have been. Remains may reach as far back in the lifespan as eggs—crushed eggs from Colorado have been suggested as those of Allosaurus. Based on histological analysis of limb bones, bone deposition appears <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> around 22 to 28years, which is {{comparable to that of}} other large theropods like Tyrannosaurus. From the same analysis, its maximum growth appears to have been at age15, with an estimated growth rate of about 150kilograms (330lb) per year.|$|E
5|$|There are two diamond {{switches}} {{near the}} western end of this station, located between the local and express tracks in each direction. This switch is used in revenue service. E and F trains use it to switch from the Queens Boulevard express tracks to the local tracks, allowing them <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> 75th Avenue. The F uses these switches at all times, while the E only uses them on weekends and during weekday evenings. The stretch of local track between 71st Avenue and 75th Avenue is only used in revenue service during late nights, when the E runs local.|$|E
5|$|Bradstreet set {{out from}} Fort Schlosser in early August 1764 with about 1,200 {{soldiers}} and a large contingent of Native allies enlisted by Sir William Johnson. Bradstreet felt {{that he did not}} have enough troops to subdue enemy Native Americans by force, and so when strong winds on Lake Erie forced him <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> Presque Isle on August 12, he decided to negotiate a treaty with a delegation of Ohio Native Americans led by Guyasuta. Bradstreet exceeded his authority by conducting a peace treaty rather than a simple truce, and by agreeing to halt Bouquet's expedition, which had not yet left Fort Pitt. Gage, Johnson, and Bouquet were outraged when they learned what Bradstreet had done. Gage rejected the treaty, believing that Bradstreet had been duped into abandoning his offensive in the Ohio Country. Gage may have been correct: the Ohio Native Americans did not return prisoners as promised in a second meeting with Bradstreet in September, and some Shawnees were trying to enlist French aid in order to continue the war.|$|E

5|$|Hiroshi tells Hsing {{that he and}} {{a handful}} of allies, who believe that the people on the ship should stop at Hsin Ti Chiu, have been keeping news of the {{acceleration}} secret. They believe that hiding the knowledge of the schedule provides them a weapon against the angels, who do not wish the ship <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> all. Hsing becomes a reluctant party to the conspiracy, but is distressed by its secrecy and what she considers to be dishonesty, and persuades Hiroshi and his allies to go public with the information. Meanwhile, Luis thoroughly investigates the education program for the sixth generation aboard the ship (the generation supposed to land on Hsin Ti Chiu) and finds that large parts of it have been erased or replaced with propaganda by the angels. Luis succeeds in making the ruling council of the ship launch an investigation into religious manipulation of the education program. Persuaded by Hsing, Hiroshi makes a public statement about the ship's new schedule, while concealing {{the fact that he had}} known about it for a while.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, the New York Racing Association {{chose to}} upgrade Aqueduct Racetrack in South Ozone Park {{in part because}} of its {{proximity}} to the Rockaway Beach Branch. As part of the modernization of the racetrack, the Racing Association built a station with ramps leading directly to the track and facilities that could handle racetrack crowds. Once the work was finished, it was handed over to the city. The new station was for northbound trains to Brooklyn and Manhattan, and it was built north of the existing Aqueduct station. In order to allow for the switching maneuvers required for southbound trains <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> the station, major signal changes were made on the line. The single-platform station was built by Aqueduct Racetrack owners at the cost of $1 million. The Aqueduct Racetrack station opened on September 14, 1959, on the same date as the renovated Aqueduct Racetrack.|$|E
5|$|In February 1892, Sperber {{left for}} another {{overhaul}} in Sydney. While en route, she had <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>at</b> Tabiteuea in the Gilbert Islands {{and send a}} landing party ashore to punish locals who had attacked German businessmen there. The overhaul lasted from 3 March to 3 May, after which Sperber went on another tour of the islands, including the Marshalls, Butaritari, and Matupit Island. At Matupit the Deputy Chancellor, Georg Schmiele, came aboard the ship. Sperber was back in Apia by 17 May, and she remained there until 1 November, when she left for another tour, which included stops at Nukufetau, Herbertshöhethe capital of German New Guineaand Friedrich Wilhelmshafen. Another period of dockyard work at Sydney followed from 6 February 1893 to 18 April. In the meanwhile, unrest in Samoa broke out, {{under the leadership of}} King Mata'afa Iosefo. He was arrested, however, which caused the movement to disperse; after she returned from Sydney, Sperber was tasked with taking Mata'afa into exile on Jaluit Atoll.|$|E
