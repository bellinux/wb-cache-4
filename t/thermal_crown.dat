40|$|A {{methodology}} {{has been}} developed for the design and construction of simple foil thrust bearings intended for parametric performance testing and low marginal costs, supporting continued development of oil-free turbomachinery. A bearing backing plate is first machined and surface-ground to produce flat and parallel faces. Partial-arc slots needed to retain the foil components are then machined into the plate by wire electrical discharge machining. Slot thicknesses achievable by a single wire pass are appropriate to accommodate the practical range of foil thicknesses, leaving a small clearance in this hinged joint to permit limited motion. The backing plate is constructed from a nickel-based superalloy (Inconel 718) to allow heat treatment of the entire assembled bearing, {{as well as to}} permit hightemperature operation. However, other dimensionally stable materials, such as precipitation-hardened stainless steel, can also be used for this component depending on application. The top and bump foil blanks are cut from stacks of annealed Inconel X- 750 foil by the same EDM process. The bump foil has several azimuthal slits separating it into five individual bump strips. This configuration allows for variable bump spacing, which helps to accommodate the effects of the varying surface velocity, <b>thermal</b> <b>crowning,</b> centrifugal dishing, and misalignment. Rectangular tabs on the foil blanks fit into the backing plate slots. For this application, a rather traditional set of conventionally machined dies is selected, and bump foil blanks are pressed into the dies for forming. This arrangement produces a set of bump foil dies for foil thrust bearings that provide for relatively inexpensive fabrication of various bump configurations, and employing methods and features from the public domain...|$|R
40|$|There is {{a growing}} trend in the {{replacement}} of the babbit facing in thrust pad bearings with a composite polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) surface layer. The PTFE-faced bearings have been shown to allow a greater specific pressure, reduce <b>thermal</b> <b>crowning,</b> and, in some cases, negate the need for an oil-lift (jacking) system. These designs of bearing require new methods for the measurement of oil film thickness both to assist in their development and for plant condition monitoring. In this work, an ultrasonic method of oil film measurement is evaluated for this purpose. An ultrasonic transducer is mounted on the back face of the thrust pad. Pulses are generated and transmitted through the pad material, bonding interlayer, and PTFE surface layer. The proportion of the wave that reflects back from the oil film layer is determined. This is then related to the oil film thickness using a series of calibration experiments and a spring stiffness model. In practice, the reflected signal is difficult to distinguish, in the time domain, from other internal reflections from the pad. Signals are compared with reflections when no oil film is present and processing is carried out in the frequency domain. Experiments have been performed on a full size PTFE-faced thrust pad destined for a hydroelectric power station turbine. The instrumented pad was installed in a test facility and subjected to a range of loading conditions both with and without oil lift. Although there were some problems with the robustness of the experimental procedure, oil films were successfully measured and used to study the effect of the oil-lift system on film formation.

40|$|Tutorialpg. 223 - 242 The {{hydrodynamic}} {{thrust bearing}} load capacity-speed envelope {{is divided into}} three major regions by speed. Each region has its own set of limiting physical phenomenon that must be included in the analysis and presents a design challenge. For instance, the high speed region has high lubricant shear rates possibly including turbulence that change pad <b>thermal</b> <b>crowning</b> and local babbitt temperature and pressure, thus limiting the bearing performance in terms of load and speed. Various design tools are used to set the bearing geometry such that the phenomenon limits are not exceeded, and an appropriate design safety factor is present. Several applications are presented that illustrate how the various design modifications such as pivot type, pivot radial and circumferential offset, pad spacing, and pad thickness may be varied to design a thrust bearing for a specific region. Three dimensional finite element models for the fluid film generate film thickness, pressure and temperature distributions, which when coupled with a pad finite element model for thermal conduction, convection, thermal deflection, and elastic deflection show thrust bearing pad performance. Turbulence is included along with hot oil carryover from the previous pad. Methods are shown that reduce vibratory motion by using the squeeze film damping attributes of double thrust bearings. The benefits of offset pivot, chrome copper pads, and controlled lubrication in a load-speed region are reviewed so that the user has an appreciation of how each feature is affecting his thrust bearing's performance. Of primary interest {{is an example of a}} high speed application where controlled lubrication increased machine efficiency by minimizing parasitic losses. Three dimensional maps of velocity, fluid mixing, temperature, and viscous heating in the pocket result in two dimensional temperature fields at the pad entrance. Accurate determination of the pad entrance temperature distribution allows for calculation of the pad maximum temperatures or bearing capacity. The examples and results presented will be of use to rotating equipment manufacturers and machinery users in applying thrust bearings to their machines...|$|R

Improving the uniformity of slab heating temperature, decreasing the bending force, and increasing the deformation of the last pass were also used to control the strip convex rib [73]. Lu, et al.

40|$|Work roll thermal contour {{is one of}} the {{important}} factors for roll contour design and configuration in hot strip rolling, for which the temperature field calculation is a critical factor. To realize the work roll thermal behavior for 1450 mm hot strip mill, the temperature field and thermal contour calculation model was built with finite different methods, and the genetic algorithm was introduced to the model parameter optimization in order to improve the simulation precision. It was proved that the model can match the engineering precision requirement by the comparison between several calculated values and measured values of the work roll temperature. With the model, the work roll thermal contour variations in a rolling process, as well as the effect of rolling rhythm and shifting strategy on the work roll thermal contour were calculated.

This study evaluated the existence of correlation between in vitro margin fit and a new microleakage technique for complete crowns cemented with 3 different luting agents. Thirty human premolars were prepared for full-coverage crowns with a convergence angle of 6 degrees, chamfer margin of 1. 2 mm circumferentially, and occlusal reduction of 1. 5 mm. Ni-Cr cast crowns were cemented with either zinc phosphate (ZP) (S. S. White), resin-modified glass-ionomer (RMGI) (Rely X Luting Cement) or a resin-based luting agent (RC) (Enforce). Margin fit (seating discrepancy and margin gap) was evaluated according to criteria in the literature under microscope with 0. 001 mm accuracy. After <b>thermal</b> cycling, <b>crowns</b> were longitudinally sectioned and microleakage scores at tooth-cement interface were obtained and recorded at × 100 magnification. Margin fit parameters were compared with the one-way ANOVA test and microleakage scores with Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn's tests (alpha= 0. 05). Correlation between margin fit and microleakage was analyzed with the Spearman's test (alpha= 0. 05). Seating discrepancy and marginal gap values ranged from 81. 82 µm to 137. 22 µm (p= 0. 117), and from 75. 42 µm to 78. 49 µm (p= 0. 940), respectively.

40|$|A {{system for}} {{controlling}} axial shifting of working rolls on a rolling mill is provided, and more particularly, a control system method which includes monitoring sensors for the rolling mill, processing information and calculating the non-all statical friction {{condition for the}} contact surfaces of the rolls on a central processing unit, and implementing the axial shifting of the working rolls on a hydraulic system. The purposes of roll shifting are primarily to control the strip shape and crown by improving the bending roll effect, to reduce the edge drop of the strip, and to maintain the uniform wear and <b>thermal</b> <b>crown</b> of the working rolls. In order to minimize or eliminate the scarring and scotch marks caused by axial shifting of the rolls, the contact zone must be kept in a non-all statical friction state. The non-all statical friction condition may be met by controlling the shifting velocity. In the control system of the present invention, the shifting distance of the roll and the shifting velocity of the cylinder are controlled in a closed loop system. Because the setting accuracy when shifting rolls directly influences the strip shape quality, the closed loop of roll position is taken as the outer loop {{of the system and}} shifting velocity is established as the inner loop. Displacement transducers and velocity transducers are used to generate control signals base on the actual shifting distance and actual shifting velocity...|$|E

The latter, combined with the imposed strip tension force, result in a net post-bite stress field which may be sufficiently compressive locally to promote buckling. A variety of non-developable shapes may result, generally occurring as waviness (centre waves, wavy edges, quarter-buckles, etc.). This problem is most of the time addressed in a decoupled way, i. e. as a post-processing of the residual stresses computed by a strip rolling model; the present paper on the contrary describes a fully coupled approach of in-bite plastic deformation and post-bite buckling. For this purpose, a simple buckling criterion has been introduced in a FEM model of strip and roll deformation, Lam 3 /Tec 3; its implementation is documented in details. The capabilities and limits of the present approach are described and discussed. Characterised by its coupled approach, it is primarily devoted to cases where on-line (under tension) manifested defects occur. It is shown that the impact of the post-bite, post-buckled stress field on the in-bite stress and strain fields is quite small in the cases investigated; however, subtle changes appear in the velocity field at bite exit, and this is sufficient to transform completely the post-bite stress field, which is found in much better agreement with measurements if such a coupled treatment is use...|$|E
40|$|Hydropower, the {{utilisation}} {{of water}} {{as a means of}} driving machinery, has been used for many centuries. Today, the great power of water is being harnessed to generate as much as 20 % of worldwide electricity. The requirement for reliable and efficient electricity generation needs to be matched by environmental awareness {{on the part of the}} industry. Work carried out during the course of my doctoral studies at Luleå University of Technology has been aimed at addressing these demands by investigating means of improving sliding bearing performance through the use of environmentally adapted lubricants and the employment of novel materials and surface texturing to reduce friction. The term "sliding bearing" refers to a type of bearing where two surfaces (usually the stationary bearing and a moving shaft) slide relative to one another with load distributed directly across the interface. In hydrodynamic bearings, a lubricant layer is built up in the contact region such that the two surfaces are completely separated. Examples of these are hydrodynamic journal and thrust bearings. These types of bearing are major components in many large machines, including hydroelectric turbines. Their safe operation relies on the maintaining of sufficient oil film thickness. As long as this condition is met, the bearing could continue to do its job indefinitely. This is particularly important during transient operating conditions (i. e. rapid changes in load or speed) when oil films can momentarily become extremely thin. Such conditions have been examined for a tilting-pad thrust bearing to assess impact on operation. More and more onerous demands are being placed on such bearings and their associated methods of lubrication, e. g. increased frequency of start/stop of hydroelectric turbines. This means that new solutions are required to maximise their operational performance. One such solution attracting current attention is the employment of surface texturing. The impact of surface texturing on the performance of a tilting-pad thrust bearing has been studied in a series of tests in comparison with a plain Babbitt surface. These show a reduction in friction with the textured bearing. Film thickness is seen to be greater suggesting improved load-carrying capacity. Another possible option for improving operational performance is the use of new lubricants. Environmentally Adapted Lubricants (EALs) are produced from simple hydrocarbons meaning that the final product tends to consist of only a few different types of molecule. This also means that an EAL can be carefully tailored to a specific function. In several experimental investigations using such fluids in both thrust and journal bearings, it has been shown that minimum film thicknesses can be maintained using an EAL with lower viscosity grade than that of the mineral oil currently used. This has the added impact of reducing bearing power (friction) losses and lowering temperatures, all beneficial to bearing operation. Thicker film has been found for an EAL of identical viscosity grade to the mineral oil. Unlike mineral oils, which have been employed as lubricants for decades, little data is available for the long-term performance of EALs. This is of interest as their use has only recently begun to catch on in the power generation industry. A study of aged EALs in a tin bronze-steel contact, typical of what may be found in hydroelectric turbines, has shown continued satisfactory performance even at high acid number (high oxidation level), beyond the point where an oil would normally be changed out. The introduction of new materials provides a means of solving certain problems associated with machine operation and reliability. The use of PTFE as a bearing facing material is well established but little has been published about its performance in this application. A series of experiments have been performed to investigate the impact of employing such a facing on a tilting-pad thrust bearing. A thicker minimum film is found at the outlet edge of the pads in comparison with a babbit (white metal) faced bearing. Temperatures within the pad bulk material are seen to be lower as a result of the insulating effects of the polymer, thereby reducing the impact of <b>thermal</b> <b>crowning.</b> An investigation has also been performed with a range of PTFE composite materials to assess their suitability as a replacement for babbitt facing material in hydrodynamic journal bearings. The polymer composites have been shown to introduce clear benefits in comparison with pure PTFE and babbitt in terms of reduced wear and break-away friction at start-up.

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{for the assessment}} of fruit quality in crops subjected to different irrigation regimes is presented. High spatial resolution multispectral and thermal airborne imagery were used to monitor crown temperature and the Photochemical Reflectance Index (PRI) over three commercial orchards comprising peach, nectarine and orange fruit trees during 2008. Irrigation regimes included sustained and regulated deficit irrigation strategies, leading to high variability of fruit quality at harvest. Stem water potential was used to monitor individual tree water status on each study site. Leaf samples were collected for destructive sampling of xanthophyll pigments to assess the relationship between the xanthophyll epoxidation state (EPS) and PRI at leaf and airborne-canopy level. At harvest, fruit size, Total Soluble Solids (TSS) and Tritatable Acidity (TA) were measured to characterize fruit quality. A statistically significant relationship between EPS and PRI was found at the leaf (r 2 = 0. 81) and canopy level (r 2 = 0. 41). Airborne-derived crown PRI calculated from the imagery acquired during the fruit growth was related to the ratio of the total soluble solids normalized by the tritatable acidity (TSS/TA), an indicator of fruit quality measured on the same trees, yielding a coefficient of determination of r 2 = 0. 50. The relationship between the integral of PRI time-series and TSS/TA yielded a coefficient of determination of r 2 = 0. 72 (peach) and r 2 = 0. 61 (nectarines). On the contrary, the relation between TSS/TA and the time-series of <b>crown</b> <b>thermal</b> imagery was very weak (r 2 = 0. 21 and 0. 25 respectively). These results suggest that a physiological remote sensing indicator related to photosynthesis, such as PRI, is more appropriate for fruit quality assessment than crown temperature, the established method of water stress detection, which is more related to crown transpiration. A radiative transfer modelling study was conducted to assess the potential validity of this {{methodology for}} fruit quality assessment when using medium spatial resolution imagery. The analysis shows important effects of soil and shadows on the PRI vs EPS relationship used for fruit quality assessment if non-pure crown reflectance was extracted from the imagery...|$|R
40|$|STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: AuTi alloys with 1. 6 % to 1. 7 % (wt%) Ti provide {{sufficient}} bond strength to veneering ceramics, but {{the strength of}} entire metal-ceramic restorations fabricated from these alloys is not known. However, this information is important to assess the clinical performance of such materials. PURPOSE: This in vitro study evaluated the fracture strength and thermal shock resistance of metal-ceramic crowns with AuTi frameworks produced by milling or casting. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Frameworks of the alloy Au- 1. 7 Ti- 0. 1 Ir (wt%) (Esteticor Vision) were produced by milling or casting (test groups). A high-gold alloy (Esteticor Special) {{was used as the}} control. The frameworks were veneered with ceramic (VMK 95). Specimens (n= 7) were loaded until fracture. Loads at failure (N) were recorded and the mean values statistically evaluated using 1 -way analysis of variance and a post hoc Dunnett test (alpha=. 05). To assess the crazing resistance of the veneering ceramic, 6 additional crowns of each group were subjected to a thermal shock test. Fractured surfaces were documented by scanning electron microscopy. Coefficients of thermal expansion of the materials used were measured (n= 2) to assess the thermal compatibility between alloys and ceramic. RESULTS: The mean fracture strength of the crowns with machined AuTi frameworks (1294 +/- 236 N) was significantly lower (P=. 012) than that of the cast AuTi frameworks (1680 +/- 150 N), but statistically not different than the high-gold alloy (1449 +/- 159 N). Bonding failure to the AuTi alloy predominantly occurred at the alloy-oxide interface. For the high-gold alloy, more ceramic residues were observed. In the <b>thermal</b> shock test, <b>crowns</b> with milled AuTi frameworks showed significantly higher thermal shock resistance compared to the other groups. The coefficients of thermal expansion (Esteticor Vision cast: 14. 5 microm/m. K; Esteticor Vision milled: 14. 3 microm/m. K; Esteticor Special cast: 13. 7 microm/m. K) did not correlate with the results of the thermal shock test. CONCLUSION: The in vitro fracture strength of crowns with milled AuTi frameworks is lower than that obtained with cast AuTi frameworks, but comparable to those crowns produced with a high-gold alloy...|$|R

An airborne campaign was conducted with the Airborne Hyperspectral Scanner (AHS) acquiring imagery in 38 spectral bands in the 0. 43 – 12. 5 mm spectral range at 2. 5 m spatial resolution. The AHS sensor was flown at 7 : 30, 9 : 30 and 12 : 30 GMT in 25 July 2004 over an olive orchard with three different water-deficit irrigation treatments to study the spatial and diurnal variability of temperature {{as a function of}} water stress. A total of 10 AHS bands located within the thermal-infrared region were assessed for the retrieval of the land surface temperature using the split-window algorithm, separating pure crowns from shadows and sunlit soil pixels using the reflectance bands. Ground truth validation was conducted with infrared thermal sensors placed on top of the trees for continuous <b>thermal</b> data acquisition. <b>Crown</b> temperature (Tc), crown minus air temperature (Tc Ta), and relative temperature difference to well-irrigated trees (Tc TR, where TR is the mean temperature of the well-irrigated trees) were calculated from the ground sensors and from the AHS imagery at the crown spatial resolution. Correlation coefficients for Tc TR between ground IRT sensors and airborne image-based AHS estimations were R 2 = 0. 50 (7 : 30 GMT), R 2 = 0. 45 (9 : 30 GMT) and R 2 = 0. 57 (12 : 30 GMT). Relationships between leaf water potential and crown Tc Ta measured with the airborne sensor obtained determination coefficients of R 2 = 0. 62 (7 : 30 GMT), R 2 = 0. 35 (9 : 30 GMT) and R 2 = 0. 25 (12 : 30 GMT).
