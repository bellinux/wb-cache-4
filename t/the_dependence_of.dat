40|$|The {{effect of}} {{electron}} correlation on <b>the</b> angle <b>dependence</b> <b>of</b> magnetoconductivity is studied in quasi-one-dimensional organic conductors. We investigated {{the effect on}} the basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> momentum <b>dependence</b> <b>of</b> both quasi-particle's lifetime and velocity near the spin-density-wave (SDW). We found that <b>the</b> momentum <b>dependence</b> <b>of</b> quasi-particle's lifetime mainly governs <b>the</b> angle <b>dependence</b> <b>of</b> one-dimensional axis magnetoconductivity. On the other hand, the change in velocity originating from the electron correlation gives the dominant effects on <b>the</b> angle <b>dependence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interchain axis magnetoconductivity. The effect of electron correlation is clarified from the association <b>of</b> <b>the</b> momentum <b>dependences</b> <b>of</b> lifetime and velocity with <b>the</b> momentum <b>dependences</b> <b>of</b> commensurate orbitals on a Fermi surface in magnetic fields.
