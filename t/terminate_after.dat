500|$|The {{date for}} which a prime {{minister}} begins his or her term has been determined by the date {{that he or she}} is sworn into his or her portfolio, as an oath of office as prime minister is not required. However, since 1957, the incoming prime minister has sworn an oath as prime minister. Before 1920, prime ministers' resignations were accepted immediately by the governor general and the last day of the ministries were the date he died or the date of resignation. Since 1920, the outgoing prime minister has only formally resigned when the new government is ready to be formed. The Interpretation Act of 1967 states that [...] "where an appointment is made effective or terminates on a specified day, that appointment is considered to be effective or to <b>terminate</b> <b>after</b> the end of the previous day." [...] Thus, although the outgoing prime minister formally resigns only hours before the incoming ministry swears their oaths, both during the day, the ministries are effectively changed at midnight the night before. Some sources, including the Parliament of Canada, apply this convention as far back as 1917.|$|E

2500|$|If {{the values}} of all basic {{variables}} are strictly positive, then a pivot must result in an improvement in the objective value. When this is always the case no set of basic variables occurs twice and the simplex algorithm must <b>terminate</b> <b>after</b> {{a finite number of}} steps. Basic feasible solutions where {{at least one of the}} basic variables is zero are called degenerate and may result in pivots for which there is no improvement in the objective value. In this case there is no actual change in the solution but only a change in the set of basic variables. When several such pivots occur in succession, there is no improvement; in large industrial applications, degeneracy is common and such [...] "stalling" [...] is notable.|$|E
