2500|$|Skiffs have fixed {{rather than}} sliding seats, and the blades {{are held in}} <b>thole</b> <b>pins</b> {{at the side of}} the boat rather than outriggers. The blades are made of wood with leather collars and {{traditional}} spoons. Pressure is applied by the feet against an adjustable wooden plate known as a [...] "stretcher board". Skiffs are usually [...] "Singles" [...] with one sculler, or [...] "Doubles" [...] with two scullers (one behind the other) and a cox. However skiffs with more scullers or incorporating a sail are also used. Skiffing takes place in the Netherlands and Argentina, using the design of traditional Thames skiff although Argentinian skiffs usually have outriggers instead of tholes.|$|E
6000|$|... "They are too big," [...] Larry said. [...] "I {{should want}} {{half a dozen}} men to launch them, and then {{you would want to}} go with me, and the bare sight of you would be enough to frighten away all the fish in the Shannon. But I will {{have a look at the}} boats. The captain might want a party to cross the river, and it's as well to see that they are in good order, and have got the oars and <b>thole</b> <b>pins</b> handy. I will see to them myself, for there are not half a dozen of ye know one end of the boat from the other." ...|$|E
60|$|The consternation of {{the watch}} at Ronald's escape was extreme. The shot which {{the man on}} guard had fired was their first intimation of the event, and seizing their muskets they had hastily {{discharged}} them {{in the direction of}} the fugitive, and had then shouted for a boat to be lowered. But never was a boat longer getting into the water than was that of the Glasgow Lass upon this occasion. The captain gave his orders in a leisurely way, and the crew were even slower in executing them. Then somehow the fall stuck and the boat wouldn't lower. When at last she was in the water it was found that the <b>thole</b> <b>pins</b> were missing; these being found she was rowed across the river, the five constables undergoing a running fire of jokes and hilarity from the sailors of the ships they passed near. In answer to their inquiries where the fugitives landed, some of the sailors shouted that she had pulled up the river behind the tier of vessels, others insisted that she had sunk with all hands close by.|$|E
25|$|By the 5th century BC, {{the first}} triremes were in use by various {{powers in the}} eastern Mediterranean. It had now become a fully developed, highly {{specialized}} vessel of war that was capable of high speeds and complex maneuvers. At nearly 40m in length, displacing almost 50 tonnes, {{it was more than}} three times as expensive as a two-level penteconter. A trireme also had an additional mast with a smaller square sail placed near the bow. Up to 170 oarsmen sat on three levels with one oar each that varied slightly in length. To accommodate three levels of oars, rowers sat staggered on three levels. Arrangements of the three levels are believed to have varied, but the most well-documented design made use of a projecting structure, or outrigger, where the oarlock {{in the form of a}} <b>thole</b> <b>pin</b> was placed. This allowed the outermost row of oarsmen enough leverage for full strokes that made efficient use of their oars.|$|R
2500|$|The {{arrangement}} {{and number of}} oarsmen is the first deciding factor {{in the size of}} the ship. [...] For a ship to travel at high speeds would require a high oar-gearing, which is the ratio between the outboard length of an oar and the inboard length; it is this arrangement of the oars which is unique and highly effective for the trireme. [...] The ports would house the oarsmen with a minimal waste of space. [...] There would be three files of oarsmen on each side tightly but workably packed by placing each man outboard of, and in height overlapping, the one below, provided that thalamian tholes were set inboard and their ports enlarged to allow oar movement. Thalamian is the English term for the Greek word, thalamios, which was the name of the oarsmen in the lowest file of the triereis; zygian is the English term for the Greek word, zygios, which were the oarsmen in the middle file of the triereis, and thranite is the English term for the Greek word, thranites, which were the oarsmen in the uppermost file of the triereis. [...] <b>Tholes</b> were <b>pins</b> that acted as fulcrums to the oars that allowed them to move. [...] The center of gravity of the ship is low because of the overlapping formation of the files that allow the ports to remain closer to the ships walls. [...] A lower center of gravity would provide adequate stability.|$|R

5000|$|Originally, {{rowlocks}} {{were two}} wooden posts or <b>thole</b> <b>pins</b> that {{the shaft of}} the oar nestled between. Single <b>THOLE</b> <b>PINS</b> may be used when the oars have holes cut into the loom which then sits over/around the THOLE PIN. (Captain Dennis Robinson FNI, Master Mariner) ...|$|E
50|$|A double {{sculling}} skiff has {{a similar}} layout to a double scull and is rowed {{in a similar way}} but usually has a cox as well as two rowers. It is clinker built with fixed seats and <b>thole</b> <b>pins</b> and can be skiffed for leisure purposes or for the sport of skiff racing.|$|E
50|$|The oars {{did not use}} {{rowlocks}} or <b>thole</b> <b>pins</b> but square holes cut {{below the}} gunwale line. The holes were also used for belaying mooring lines and sail sheets. At the bow the forward upper futtock protruded about 400 mm above the sheerline and was carved to retain anchor or mooring lines.|$|E
5000|$|The Thames skiff {{owes its}} origins to the viking boat {{building}} method of over-lapping timber planking known as clinker construction. Many {{of the terms}} used for parts of the skiff are of Scandinavian origin - “tholes”, “thwarts”, and “sax”. Planks {{on either side of}} a wooden keel are laid down following the outline of a sham (temporary pattern) placed across the keel. The planks are nailed in place and then a strengthening framework of ribs is added. Oars (or blades) are held in place by wooden <b>thole</b> <b>pins</b> {{at the side of the}} boat rather than rowlocks or outriggers. The <b>thole</b> <b>pins</b> are designed to give way if too much pressure is put on them, thus protecting the boat itself from damage. The thwart, or seat, is fixed rather than sliding as in modern boats. The sax runs round the top of the boat to strengthen and protect it. [...] Blades are made of wood with leather collars.|$|E
50|$|Currachs {{in general}} {{adhere to a}} plan {{designed}} to produce a sturdy, light and versatile vessel. The framework consists of latticework formed of rib-frames ("hoops") and stringers (longitudinal slats), surmounted by a gunwale. There are stem and stern posts, but no keel. Thwarts are fitted, with knees supplied as required. Cleats or <b>thole</b> <b>pins</b> are fitted for the oars, {{and there may be}} a mast and sail, though with a minimum of rigging. The outside of the hull is covered by tarred canvas or calico, a substitute for animal hide.|$|E
50|$|Rowlock - Pronounced Rolick. A 'U' shaped metal {{device that}} secures an oar and {{acts as a}} fulcrum during the motion of rowing. Sometimes called an oarlock in the USA. The Rowlock is {{attached}} with a swivelling pin to the gunwale in a row boat. Commonly made from galvanized steel, bronze or plastic. Before the availability of metal the oar was normally levered against 2 wooden pins called <b>Thole</b> <b>pins</b> inserted in the gunwale. Tholepins are still used in some third world nations. In a narrow row boat the rowlocks are held well outboard in a lightweight outrigger (rigger) which is often equipped with a locking pin to hold the oar securely.|$|E

5000|$|Rearward-facing systems:This is {{probably}} the oldest system used in Europe and North America. A seated rower pulls {{on one or two}} oars, which lever the boat through the water. The pivot point of the oars (attached solidly to the boat) is the fulcrum. The motive force is applied through the rower's feet.In traditional rowing craft, the pivot point of the oars is generally located on the boat's gunwale. The actual fitting that holds the oar may be as simple as one or two pegs (or <b>thole</b> <b>pins)</b> or a metal oarlock (also called rowlock - [...] "rollock"). In performance rowing craft, the rowlock is usually extended outboard on a [...] "rigger" [...] to allow the use of a longer oar for increased power.|$|E
