5|$|In 1936, US 322 was {{extended}} into New Jersey, running from a ferry dock on the Delaware River in Bridgeport and continuing east from <b>there</b> <b>through</b> Mullica Hill and Glassboro to Williamstown, where it followed Route 42 to McKee City and U.S. Route 40/Route 48 to Atlantic City. In 1939, {{the portion of}} US 322 between the ferry dock and Route 44 (now U.S. Route 130) was legislated as Route S44, a spur of Route 44, while the route between there and Route 42 in Williamstown was legislated as Route 51. It is also this section between Bridgeport and Williamstown that was not in state highway jurisdiction at the time.|$|E

Occupancy at 100 McAllister was low, though the United States Army Corps of Engineers moved their San Francisco District offices there in the 1960s, and local draftees were still required to appear <b>there</b> <b>through</b> the late 1960s.

She departed Yokohama early in the autumn of 1897 and made port at Mare Island on 18 November 1897.

5|$|The second batch, {{known as}} RTL, {{were of a}} similar design but {{manufactured}} by Rohr Industries, an American company. These entered service on the Empire Corridor {{in the state of}} New York in 1976. The RTLs remained in service <b>there</b> <b>through</b> the 1990s, supplemented by several rebuilt RTGs. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, New York and Amtrak partnered to rebuild the RTLs for high-speed service; this project failed, and the last RTL trainsets left revenue service in 2003. After the settlement of legal issues, New York sold the remaining trainsets for scrap in 2012.|$|E

5|$|Affeldt {{returned}} to Kansas City's starting rotation in 2006 {{when he was}} named the fourth starter during Spring training. However, he was moved up to the third spot before the season began when Runelvys Hernández was demoted to the fifth spot. Affeldt struggled as a starter, going 25 with a 7.80 ERA in nine starts. His final major league start came on May 27 against the New York Yankees. He gave up ten runs on eleven hits in a 154 loss. After the start, {{he was sent to}} the bullpen, and Bobby Keppel filled his place in the starting rotation.

His parents separated after Audrey discovered Bill had had an affair that started while he was stationed in the army during World War II. He began attending Hounslow College and stayed <b>there</b> <b>through</b> his early teenage years. He was influenced by Elvis Presley by hearing his records at home and at the local youth club. He switched to go to Acton County Grammar School (now Acton High School) to take his O Levels, where he was in the same class as Pete Townshend, but became distracted from studies after leaving the local cinema having watched a Presley film, deciding {{that he wanted to be}} a rock'n'roll singer. He subsequently took a job manufacturing ice machines in Hounslow.|$|E
5|$|In his {{capacity}} {{as a career}} officer, Taylor had never publicly revealed his political beliefs before 1848 nor voted before that time. He {{thought of himself as}} an independent, believing in a strong and sound banking system for the country, and thought that President Andrew Jackson, a Democrat, should not have allowed the Second Bank of the United States to collapse in 1836. He believed it was impractical to talk about expanding slavery into the western areas of the U.S., as he concluded that neither cotton nor sugar (both were produced in great quantities as a result of slavery) could be easily grown <b>there</b> <b>through</b> a plantation economy. He was also a firm nationalist, and due to his experience of seeing many people die as a result of warfare, he believed that secession was not a good way to resolve national problems. Taylor, although he did not agree with their stand in favor of protective tariffs and expensive internal improvements, aligned himself with Whig Party governing policies: the President should not be able to veto a law, unless that law was against the Constitution; that the office should not interfere with Congress; and that the power of collective decision-making, as well as the Cabinet, should be strong.|$|E

5|$|On 14 October, New York {{collided}} with a U-boat and sank it. The collision nevertheless damaged her screws, which forced Rodman to transfer his flag from New York to Wyoming while the former was in dock for repair. On 21 November, after the Armistice with Germany ended the war, Wyoming and an Allied fleet of some 370 warships met the High Seas Fleet in the North Sea and escorted it into internment in Scapa Flow. On 12 December, Wyoming, now the flagship of Rear Admiral William Sims, the new BatDiv 9 commander, left Britain for France. There, she rendezvoused off Brest, France with , which was carrying President Woodrow Wilson to the peace negotiations in Paris. Wyoming then returned to Britain two days later before departing for the US, arriving in New York on 25 December. She remained <b>there</b> <b>through</b> the new year, and on 18 January 1919, she became the flagship of BatDiv 7, flying the flag of Rear Admiral Robert Coontz.|$|E
5|$|Pain is {{the presumed}} builder of Pain's Castle in the Welsh county of Radnor. He also {{controlled}} Caus Castle in Shropshire, and through his wife Ludlow Castle {{in the same}} county. Although he held the title to Weobley Castle, he {{does not appear to}} have exercised any control over it, which eventually went to Gilbert de Lacy. Pain was not the only recipient of Hugh de Lacy's lands; some went to Jocelin de Dinan and some to Miles of Gloucester. Pain's share included property in Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, and Worcestershire, and he succeeded in acquiring additional lands near Ludlow, adding to the manors he held <b>there</b> <b>through</b> his wife; his holdings of land were considered to be worth 17 knights fees. By 1130 he had evidently acquired additional properties in Oxfordshire, where he is recorded as being excused payment of danegeld that year.|$|E
5|$|The Angels {{have played}} in three home ball parks.

In 1962, they moved to Dodger Stadium, but only stayed <b>there</b> <b>through</b> 1965. They played two Opening Day games at Dodger Stadium, winning once and losing once. The Angels finally moved to Angel Stadium of Anaheim in 1966, which was first called Anaheim Stadium, then subsequently renamed Edison International Field of Anaheim later. They have played 29 Opening Day games there, and their starting pitchers have 15wins and 12losses with 2no decisions. This makes their record at home in Opening Day games 15wins and 13losses with 2no decisions. In Opening Day games on the road, their starting pitchers have a record of 10wins and 5losses with 5no decisions.|$|E
