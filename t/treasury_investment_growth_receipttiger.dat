40|$|We {{examine the}} {{empirical}} relations among firm-level <b>investment</b> <b>growth,</b> {{market value of}} equity, bookto-market ratio (B/M), and stock returns. Under the widely used Fama and French (FF) methods, firms classified as big and low-B/M (B/L) significantly accelerate investment prior to the classification year. Their market values of equity rise and their leverage levels diminish. Firms classified as small and high-B/M (S/H) reduce investment and increase leverage. In other words, FF classification methods implicitly assign firms to portfolios conditional on past <b>investment</b> <b>growth.</b> Berk, Green, and Naik (BGN, 1999) offer a model and simulations consistent with such patterns in firm-level fundamentals. BGN’s model also predicts that systematic risk and expected equity returns evolve dynamically with firm-level investment, and that firm fundamentals such as B/M and firm size proxy for investment-related changes in risk. Consistent with BGN, we find that average raw returns vary across portfolios of stocks formed {{on the basis of}} past <b>investment</b> <b>growth.</b> We find weakened evidence of a value premium after categorizing stocks by <b>investment</b> <b>growth.</b> <b>Investment</b> <b>growth</b> also has explanatory power in cross-sectional and timeseries regressions of stock returns and appears to provide information similar to that of B/M...|$|R
40|$|The {{financial}} accelerator hypothesis (FAH) {{states that}} following aggregate shocks, financially constrained firms find {{it harder to}} access external finance and therefore have to reduce invest-ment.

Second, we find that both <b>investment</b> <b>growth</b> and aggregate market returns respond more strongly to ’s shocks during economic downturns. Third, the <b>investment</b> <b>growth</b> of firms with poorer access to external finance is more sensitive to ’s shocks. Moreover, we show that ’s predictive ability is robust and not due to information contained in tradi-tional variables, such as SMB and net payout. In summary, the FAH motivates a forecasting variable () that delivers the strongest link between expected aggregated market returns and a macroeconomic variable (<b>investment</b> <b>growth)</b> among traditional predictors...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, I {{explore the}} asset pricing {{implications}} of a general equilibrium model with production, in which investment projects need time-to-build. This investment friction allows me to explain the observed negative correlation of <b>investment</b> <b>growth</b> and stock returns at the aggregate level – an observation that has been interpreted as evidence for irrational markets since it cannot be reconciled with the Q theory of investment. When I further enhance the time-to-build model with adjustment costs, the model is able to explain three empirical facts of aggregate data: (i) the negative comovement of stock returns and <b>investment</b> <b>growth,</b> (ii) the prolonged positive cor-relation between stock returns and future <b>investment</b> <b>growth,</b> and (iii) the negative correlation between <b>investment</b> <b>growth</b> and future stock returns.

40|$|This article {{examines}} whether financial sector development has ‘caused’ economic <b>growth</b> and <b>investment</b> in Ghana between 1970 and 2007. As {{a proxy for}} financial sector development we use credit to private sector as per cent of GDP, bank liquid reserve – asset ratio and liquid liability as a per cent of GDP. We use GDP growth {{as a proxy for}} economic growth and real domestic <b>investment</b> for <b>investment</b> <b>growth.</b> The dynamic interactions between the growth of real Per capita Gross Domestic Product, real domestic investment and indicators of financial sector development are investigated using the concept of Granger Causality after testing for cointegration using Johansen techniques. The empirical results obtained by the Johansen method suggest the existence of a stable long-run relationship between growth rate and financial sector development indicators identified in the study. The same is true for <b>investment</b> <b>growth.</b> However, with the exception of credit to private sector where the causality runs from economic growth only, we find bidirectional causality between economic growth and financial sector development indicators. For <b>investment</b> <b>growth,</b> the causality runs from <b>investment</b> <b>growth</b> to financial sector indicators except between <b>investment</b> <b>growth</b> and Liquid liability where bidirectional causality recorded.

Third, by slowing capital accumulation and technological progress embedded in investment, weak post-crisis <b>investment</b> <b>growth</b> has contributed to sluggish growth of potential output in recent years.
