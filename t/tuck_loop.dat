40|$|Derivatives {{of single}} jersey can be {{produced}} by combining the tuck and miss loops in both wale and course direction. But wale wise increment of tuck and miss loops are mostly practiced. This paper focused on spirality which is a common fault of knit fabrics. The wale wise increment of tuck and miss loops, individually have effects on spirality. Total nine single jersey derivatives were knitted to observe the changes. From total study it was perceived with the increment of tuck and miss loops spirality increases and higher spirality was found for miss loop fabrics (10 %, 12. 8 %, 4. 8 % and 6. 3 %) than <b>tuck</b> <b>loop</b> fabrics (2 %, 4 %, 0. 9 % and 2 %). It was also found that an all knit course insertion on pique and cross miss designs reduce the spirality almost to half for lacoste and locknit designs. It means that higher presence of knit loops can reduce the spirality...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the research undertaken at the University of Minho aiming {{to study the}} behaviour of 3 D weft-knitted structures using Shape Memory Alloy (SMA) wires and elastomeric yarns, {{in order to produce}} dynamic structures as a support to answer specific situations and applications. Several samples were produced using Nitinol® wires in different diameters and loop types. The Tensile tests were carried out being based to NP EN ISO 2062 : 1993 standards, using a H 100 KS Hounsfield Universal Testing Instrument. The results showed that The 50 μm wire showed to be too thin to this propose; moreover, The 210 μm NiTi wire showed to be hard to process on the knitting machine due to its high stiffness; The 127 μm NiTi wire showed to be the best among them, due to the process and energy absorption ratio. Finally, for both NiTi wires in different diameters studied, <b>tuck</b> <b>loop</b> showed to have the highest energy absorption capacity...|$|E
40|$|Strength {{is a very}} {{important}} criterion for any material especially for fabric. To increase the durability and dimensional stability-strength plays a vital role. Of all types of weft knit fabrics single jersey fabric is very popular. This paper focused on the bursting strength of various derivatives of single jersey knit fabric in both grey and finished state. Derivatives of single jersey knit fabrics are found by using tuck and miss loops in corporate with knit loops in wales direction. Higher presence of tuck and miss loops in wales direction affect the bursting strength. From the total analysis it was observed that bursting strength decreases with the increasing of tuck (single pique, double pique, single lacoste, double lacoste) and miss loops (Single cross miss, double cross miss) than all knit loop containing fabric (plain single jersey). It is also observed that the bursting strength decrement of <b>tuck</b> <b>loop</b> containing fabric is higher than miss loop containing fabric as well as the lacoste & locknit fabrics have higher bursting strength than the pique & cross miss fabric...|$|E
40|$|Strength is an {{important}} term any kinds of material and especially for knitted fabric should have its own dimensional stability. We all know {{it is very difficult}} to maintain the entire quality parameters in quality test like- Bursting strength test. When we change the design of the fabric by changing cam and needle, then it becomes more difficult to maintain all those parameters. This paper focused on the bursting strength of various derivatives of single jersey knit fabric. Derivatives of single jersey knit fabrics are found by using <b>tuck</b> <b>loops</b> in corporate with knit loops in Wales and course direction. Higher presence of tuck in Wales and course direction affect the bursting strength. From the total analysis it was observed that bursting strength decreases with the increasing of <b>tuck</b> <b>loops</b> in same Wales or course than all knit loop containing fabric (plain single jersey). Bursting strength don’t depend on increase or decrease percentage of <b>tuck</b> <b>loops,</b> it depend on how many loops are in same Wales or course. Bursting strength increase and decrease also depend on how many Wales or course used in any design repeat...|$|R

60|$|We {{took a step}} or two further on, and by way of {{restoring}} the naturally cheerful tone of our thoughts, began fitting visionary feet and legs into a cellar-board full of boots and shoes, with a speed and accuracy that would have astonished the most expert artist in leather, living. There was one pair of boots in particular—a jolly, good-tempered, hearty-looking pair of tops, that excited our warmest regard; and we had got a fine, red-faced, jovial fellow of a market-gardener into them, before we had made their acquaintance half a minute. They were just the very thing for him. There was his huge fat legs bulging over the tops, and fitting them too tight to admit of his <b>tucking</b> in the <b>loops</b> he had pulled them on by; and his knee-cords with an interval of stocking; and his blue apron tucked up round his waist; and his red neckerchief and blue coat, and a white hat stuck on one side of his head; and there he stood with a broad grin on his great red face, whistling away, as if any other idea but that of being happy and comfortable had never entered his brain.|$|R
40|$|The {{representation}} weft {{knitted fabrics}} covers {{a wide range}} of methods, which may vary from country to country or may be similar, being used identical or slightly modified. In Romania, currently, for the weft knitted fabrics are used four methods of representing the knitted structures, namely: structural or analytical representation, representation using knitting notations, symbolic representation of the section of stitch courses and representation of drawing design. Generalization of knitted fabrics design using CAD systems determined the development of software design, including 2 D representation {{that can be used for}} any type of machine. 2 D representation of stitches solves the modeling problems and is possible to be executed using different computer graphics programs (CorelDRAW, AUTOCAD, etc). With the help of the graphic editor CORELDRAW it is possible to make the graphical representation of the structure of any kind of weft knitted fabric regardless of its complexity, strating from the simplest ones such as knits with basic weaves (single jersey, rib fabric, links, links and links patterns) to the most complex structures such as knitted fabrics with different evolutionary changes of normal stitches (<b>tuck</b> <b>loop</b> knits, missed stitches knits, racked stitches knits, etc.) or those with combined designs (knitted jacquard, intarsia knits etc.). This paper presents the possibility of using the CorelDRAW application for representing knitted structures...|$|E
30|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{research}} is evaluating the impact resistance of weft knitted fabrics which are knitted in basic patterns from the high tenacity Nylon 66. The woven fabrics have been applied for manufacturing technical and ballistic textiles so far. Although woven fabrics have been demonstrated satisfactory tensile properties, {{but they have not}} been resisted against impact, because of their poor strain against tensile forces. This research is important because knitted fabrics are applied in wide range of applications including technical textiles such as, package belts, safety belts, ballistic belts, and can be used to remove ice from airplane wings. Various knitted fabrics with different knitting elements such as knit, <b>tuck</b> and miss <b>loops</b> were produced. Mechanical properties including strength, work of the rupture and impact resistance of knitted samples were tested. The artificial neural network was used to predict mechanical properties of fabrics produced from the knitted structure as fitness function in genetic algorithm. After that, genetic algorithm was applied to find the optimum structure of knitted fabric with maximum impact resistance. The results of the genetic algorithm show that optimum structure of the fabric is cross-miss and rib structure with high stitch density.|$|R
