5|$|In 2012 the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) in the UK banned some of Proactiv's {{advertising}} as misleading. A viewer {{complained that}} <b>the</b> <b>celebrities</b> {{were likely to}} have used the US version of Proactiv, which differs from the UK version. According to the ASA, <b>the</b> <b>celebrities</b> had signed statements saying they had used the UK version {{for a few weeks}} one to three years earlier, but the advertisements gave the appearance that they had continued to benefit from it, so the viewer's complaint was upheld.|$|E
5|$|The {{people of}} South Park decide to turn Muhammad {{over to the}} Gingers, fearing the {{violence}} that will befall their town if they do not. <b>The</b> <b>celebrities</b> are angered by this change in events, but refuse to resort to violence for fear of ruining their careers. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>celebrities</b> decide to awaken the rebuilt Mecha-Streisand, a giant mechanical monster form of Barbra Streisand, who previously terrorized the town of South Park before being destroyed. <b>The</b> <b>celebrities</b> hope to use Mecha-Streisand to force South Park to accept their demands. Meanwhile, due to the chain of events, Cartman decides Connor's scheme has become too complicated and tries to quit, but Connor convinces him to stay involved by revealing that the townspeople of South Park have lied to Cartman about his true father. Although they previously claimed his hermaphroditic mother was also his father, Connor insists this is a lie. Cartman confronts his school teacher Mr. Garrison and Garrison's old hand puppet Mr. Hat, who admits to Cartman there was indeed a cover-up. Mecha-Streisand roars threateningly and continues her reign of destruction as the episode ends.|$|E

40|$|This paper applies Gestalt {{psychology}} and associative network theory {{to examine the}} effect of eclipsing in celebrity endorsement on consumer attitude towards the endorsed brand. Eclipsing occurs when <b>the</b> <b>celebrity</b> overshadows <b>the</b> endorsed brand by dominating in an advertisement and diminishing the associative link between <b>the</b> <b>celebrity</b> and endorsed brand. Three studies take into account match-up, celebrity attachment, brand familiarity, and the moderating role of eclipsing, through manipulating two levels of eclipsing in advertising: (1) high eclipsing, when <b>the</b> <b>celebrity</b> is <b>the</b> focus, and (2) low eclipsing, when both <b>the</b> <b>celebrity</b> and brand are emphasized. Consumers who have a weak attachment to <b>the</b> <b>celebrity</b> endorser report a more positive brand attitude when they see <b>the</b> <b>celebrity</b> and endorsed brand both emphasized in an advertisement (low eclipsing) than when <b>the</b> <b>celebrity</b> overshadows and dominates the brand (high eclipsing), irrespective of whether consumers perceive <b>the</b> <b>celebrity</b> and brand to match or mismatch. For consumers with strong celebrity attachment, high eclipsing enhances brand attitude, regardless of whether they perceive <b>the</b> <b>celebrity</b> and brand to either match or mismatch. The findings of these studies have significant implications for advertisers and brand managers in the execution of their advertisements featuring endorsements. 11 page(s...|$|R

5|$|Aside from {{professional}} wrestling performances, celebrity involvement {{has been a}} major key in the production of WrestleMania events. WWE involves celebrities in the WrestleMania events to gain more hype and media attention for the event, in this way receiving more attraction to the event, pay-per-view buys, and ticket sales. <b>The</b> <b>celebrities</b> involved with WrestleMania events have come from a range of occupations, including singing, acting, professional boxing, and modeling, and usually appear in non-wrestling roles, such as singing, promoting a subject, or managing wrestlers at ringside. There have been exceptions, however, in which celebrities have had a professional wrestling role.|$|E
5|$|By the {{beginning}} of the 1980s, there were popular hip hop songs, and <b>the</b> <b>celebrities</b> of the scene, like LL Cool J, gained mainstream renown. Other performers experimented with politicized lyrics and social awareness, or fused hip hop with jazz, heavy metal, techno, funk and soul. New styles appeared {{in the latter part of}} the 1980s, like alternative hip hop and the closely related jazz rap fusion, pioneered by rappers like De La Soul.|$|E

5|$|In the UK in 2005, Lawson {{started to}} host a daytime {{television}} chat show on ITV1 called Nigella, on which celebrity guests joined her in a studio kitchen. The first episode debuted with a disappointing 800,000 viewers.

She later commented to Radio Times that on her first show, she was almost too frightened {{to come out of}} her dressing room. Lawson added that having to pretend to be interested in the lives of <b>the</b> <b>celebrities</b> on her show became too much of an effort.|$|E

King, and Eric Clapton, among others. Dozens of artists were packed into an all-star band called The Louisiana Gator Boys. Even with many returning cast members, the film was considered a box-office failure, only generating a little over $14 million in sales, and critics' reactions were very poor.|$|E
5|$|The gunge game The Leakiest Sink {{continued}} until May 2001 {{and the last}} edition saw host Cawood gunged {{under the guise of}} her character Anne Rim Basin. It was replaced the following week by a new feature Stop The Snot. The rules of the new game involved a celebrity speaking {{for as long as possible}} without saying 'yes' or 'no'. The player then won a prize for every 10 seconds passed. If the celebrity did say 'yes' or 'no', the player would be gunged. In later weeks, <b>the</b> <b>celebrities</b> took the place of the player in the gunge tank. For the last episode, host Suttie found herself in the gunge tank and was subsequently gunged after she said 'yes' two seconds into the game.|$|E

Here, authenticity and nostalgia dimensions are also influential factors.

5|$|Although the two clubs {{claimed to}} have sold most of the 42,000 tickets {{allocated}} to them, only about 25,000 fans {{were said to have}} travelled to Moscow from the United Kingdom, with about 110 charter flights arriving ahead of the game. According {{to the head of the}} Russian national tourist office, Mikhail Ignatiev, many fans were put off by the cost of travel and accommodation. Additionally, most of Moscow's hotels were full on the night of the game. As some fans looked to offload tickets to the match, The Moscow Times reported that the black-market price dropped from a high of €2,000 (£1,600) to around €500 (£400), while Russian TV channel Sport-1 was reporting prices as low as £300 for tickets belonging to fans who had failed to make the trip to Moscow. Among <b>the</b> <b>celebrities</b> who did not travel were Chelsea supporter and chairman of the London Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (LOCOG) Sebastian Coe, who had to attend meetings ahead of the 2012 Summer Olympics, and Manchester United fan and Simply Red lead singer Mick Hucknall, who was due to perform at the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth.|$|E

The show ran for eleven days in Washington, D.C. {{with a wide variety of}} celebratory festivities, such as hourly featured guests and entertainers, chorus performances, and military unit exhibitions. The second stop of the tour coincided with the 75th anniversary of Strawbridge and Clothier in Philadelphia. Bob Hope, Bing Crosby, and Durant were among <b>the</b> <b>celebrities</b> on hand.
