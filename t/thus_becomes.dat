5|$|Indirect mutualisms occur {{where the}} organisms live apart. For example, trees {{living in the}} {{equatorial}} regions of the planet supply oxygen into the atmosphere that sustains species living in distant polar regions of the planet. This relationship is called commensalism; because, many others receive the benefits of clean air at no cost or harm to trees supplying the oxygen. If the associate benefits while the host suffers, the relationship is called parasitism. Although parasites impose a cost to their host (e.g., via damage to their reproductive organs or propagules, denying {{the services of a}} beneficial partner), their net effect on host fitness is not necessarily negative and, <b>thus,</b> <b>becomes</b> difficult to forecast. Co-evolution is also driven by competition among species or among members of the same species under the banner of reciprocal antagonism, such as grasses competing for growth space. The Red Queen Hypothesis, for example, posits that parasites track down and specialize on the locally common genetic defense systems of its host that drives the evolution of sexual reproduction to diversify the genetic constituency of populations responding to the antagonistic pressure.|$|E
5|$|Unmarried princess Kunti is {{blessed by}} the Sun god {{with a baby}} boy, which she {{abandons}} in the Ganges to avoid embarrassment. The boy is rescued and adopted by charioteer Athirathan and is named Karnan. Years later, the now-grown up Karnan realises that Athirathan is only his adoptive father and feels heartbroken. He {{does not want to}} become a charioteer like Athirathan, and instead chooses to become a warrior. He masters archery and challenges the Pandava prince Arjuna in a contest. Karnan is insulted on account of his lowly birth, but the Kaurava prince and cousin of the Pandavas, Duryodhana, saves his pride, and gives him the kingdom of Anga. Karnan <b>thus</b> <b>becomes</b> the close friend of Duryodhana and his wife Bhanumati.|$|E
5|$|The {{route of}} the new subway... {{comprises}} a main trunk north and south through Manhattan Borough on Lexington Avenue and Irving Place from the Harlem River to Tenth St. and on Broadway, Vesey and Church Sts. from Tenth St. to the Battery; two branches in Bronx Borough, one northeast via 138th St. Southern Boulevard and Westchester Ave. to Pelham Bay Park. the other northerly via River Ave. and Jerome Ave.. to Woodlawn Road, connecting with the Manhattan trunk by a tunnel under the Harlem River; a Manhattan-Brooklyn line extending from the North River via Canal Street across the East River on the Manhattan Bridge {{to connect with the}} Fourth Avenue subway in Brooklyn now being built, which <b>thus</b> <b>becomes</b> {{an integral part of the}} larger system; two branches southerly from the Fourth Ave. line extending south to Fort Hamilton and southeast to Coney Island; and a loop feeder line in Brooklyn through Lafayette Ave. and Broadway, connecting with the Fourth Ave. line at one end. and at the other crossing the Williamsburg Bridge and entering the Centre Street Loop subway in Manhattan which is thus also incorporated in the system.|$|E

25|$|A {{pathological}} {{reliance on}} fantasizing and preoccupation with inner experience is often {{part of the}} schizoid withdrawal from the world. Fantasy <b>thus</b> <b>becomes</b> a core component of the self in exile, though fantasizing in schizoid individuals is far more complicated than a means of facilitating withdrawal.|$|E
25|$|While {{initially}} {{used only}} {{to refer to}} radical homosexuals, opinions on the range of what queer includes can vary. For some people, the non-specificity of the term is liberating. Queerness <b>thus</b> <b>becomes</b> a path of political resistance against heteronormativity as well as homonormativity while simultaneously refusing to engage in traditional essentialist identity politics.|$|E

25|$|Amplified {{instruments}} {{simplify the}} design of the series and shunt resistor networks. The internal resistance of the coil is decoupled from the selection of the series and shunt range resistors; the series network <b>thus</b> <b>becomes</b> a voltage divider. Where AC measurements are required, the rectifier can be placed after the amplifier stage, improving precision at low range.|$|E
25|$|These are {{the first}} Tibetan {{catalogues}} in three versions that were compiled and published {{in the beginning of}} the ninth century by the great sgra-sgyur gyi lo-tsa-wa Bande sKa-ba dpal-brtsegs and his team. Tibet, <b>thus,</b> <b>becomes</b> the earliest to accomplish catalogue as inventory in the history of evolution of catalogue. Bande sKa-ba dpal-brtsegs is thus, honored as the pioneer of the Tibetan system. All the later compilers of the Tibetan Canon based their works extensively on sKa-ba dpal-brtsegs creation.|$|E
25|$|Grain {{boundaries}} are in general {{only a few}} nanometers wide. In common materials, crystallites are large enough that grain boundaries account for {{a small fraction of}} the material. However, very small grain sizes are achievable. In nanocrystalline solids, grain boundaries become a significant volume fraction of the material, with profound effects on such properties as diffusion and plasticity. In the limit of small crystallites, as the volume fraction of grain boundaries approaches 100%, the material ceases to have any crystalline character, and <b>thus</b> <b>becomes</b> an amorphous solid.|$|E

25|$|Lioness Club Membership is {{generally}} for service-minded women, with exceptions of men also becoming Lioness members nowadays. They are formed under a parent Lions Club. The Lions Club <b>thus</b> <b>becomes</b> the Parent Club for the Lioness Club. Naming of the Club is also {{like that of}} the Lions Club—e.g.,Lions Club of Satara United Dist 323D-1 forming and sponsoring a Lioness Club Satara United District 323D-1. In many areas, particularly the United States, Lioness clubs have disbanded and merged into their parent clubs to make a more effective club as a whole.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to real-time, play {{has a lot}} of links with the historical background of Gundulić's time. The strongest and most famous link with historical events is the motive of the Dalmatian fishermen who comes from the land occupied by the Venetians, in a free and independent Dubrava, allegorical Dubrovnik, the symbol of Croatian circumstances at the time due to many attacks by the Ottomans, Venetians, Hungarians, Austrians, French and others. Dubrovnik <b>thus</b> <b>becomes</b> allegorical port of salvation for the Croatian people, but also a role model and an inspiration in the fight against the greedy enemies.|$|E
25|$|In {{the third}} series, S.Baldrick has lost almost all {{intelligence}} and apparently has {{no desire to}} rise in social standing and claims in the first episode that his goal in life is the acquisition of turnips. Ironically, in the same episode, Baldrick is appointed to the House of Lords by Prince George and <b>thus</b> <b>becomes</b> upper class, {{one of the greatest}} achievements of the Baldrick family. He also haggles for a priceless turnip (£400,000). Baldrick's turnip is crushed by Blackadder later and presumably his titles were erased as in the following episodes, he is once more lower class.|$|E

25|$|Traditional Indian scriptures see Ṛta, a Hindu {{theological}} term {{similar to}} dharma, {{as a natural}} law that governs both the cosmos and human society. Performance of one's duties to uphold social institutions, such as marriage and family, <b>thus</b> <b>becomes</b> imperative, and duty overrides individual freedom. Dnyaneshwar is in agreement with tradition; he believes that divine order and moral order {{are one and the}} same and are inherent in the universe itself. He, therefore, recommends that all social institutions be protected and preserved in their totality. However, when it comes to the institution of caste, his approach becomes more humanitarian and he advocates spiritual egalitarianism.|$|E
25|$|The second pathway <b>thus</b> <b>becomes</b> {{involved}} {{and is able}} to utilize both FEN1 and Dna2 nucleases to process the long flaps. Dna2 can cleave the RPA bound flap as it is able to displace to RPA, while creating a flap to which RPA cannot bind. Then, FEN1 will complete the cleavage of the flap. Dna2 is a key part of this process. Without the Dna2, the RPA bound flaps could not be processed which would ultimately lead to cell instability. The Pif1 helicase is also involved in this pathway as it aids creation of long flaps. Without the Pif1 helicase, the flaps would not become long enough to need cleavage by Dna2.|$|E
25|$|Evidence {{of absence}} is {{evidence}} of any kind {{that can be used}} to infer or deduce the non-existence or non-presence of something. For instance, if a doctor does not find any malignant cells in a patient this null result (finding nothing) {{is evidence of}} absence of cancer, even though the doctor has not actually detected anything per se. Such inductive reasoning is important to empiricism and science, but has well established limitations. The challenge <b>thus</b> <b>becomes</b> to try to identify when a researcher has received a null result (found nothing) because the thing does not exist (evidence of absence—objectively negative result), and when one simply lacks proper means of detection (absence of evidence—false negative).|$|E

25|$|Charles Halloway is the {{character}} who learns {{the most about}} this; he initially views death as unpleasant and it <b>thus</b> <b>becomes</b> a sinister force {{to him that the}} Mirror Maze magnifies. However, Will's words of love help him to see that age does not matter if one focuses instead on the knowledge and affections gained with it, and as his fear vanishes, so does the Mirror Maze. He also is able to defeat the Dust Witch once he realizes that she does not have ultimate control over him. With his belief in her powers gone, he turns the tables on the Witch by instilling the same fear in her of his smile that he used to have of her magic.|$|E
25|$|In Santa Claus is Coming to Town (1970), she is {{introduced}} {{as a teacher}} named Jessica, who first meets Santa Claus (then known as Kris Kringle) as a young man, when he's trying to illegally deliver toys to a town run by a despotic ruler. She assists him, and <b>thus</b> <b>becomes</b> a wanted fugitive herself with Kringle and his confederates. In light of this sacrifice, Jessica and Santa soon {{fall in love with}} each other, and marry in the nearby forest. In 1974's The Year Without a Santa Claus and the 2006 live action remake, Mrs. Claus played a large role, as she attempts to show Santa (who wishes to stay home that year for Christmas when he feels no one appreciates or believes in him anymore) that there's still some Christmas spirit left in the world. Mrs. Claus also made appearances in several other Rankin/Bass specials.|$|E
25|$|The {{analysis}} of different Indo-European tales {{indicates that the}} Proto-Indo-Europeans believed there were two progenitors of mankind: * ("Man") and * ("Twin"), his twin brother. A reconstructed creation myth involving the two is given by David W. Anthony, attributed in part to Bruce Lincoln: Manu and Yemo traverse the cosmos, accompanied by the primordial cow, and finally decide to create the world. To do so, Manu sacrifices either Yemo or the cow, and {{with help from the}} sky father, the storm god and the divine twins, forges the earth from the remains. Manu <b>thus</b> <b>becomes</b> the first priest and establishes the practice of sacrifice. The sky gods then present cattle to the third man, *, who loses it to the three-headed serpent *, but eventually overcomes this monster either alone or aided by the sky father. Trito is now the first warrior and ensures that the cycle of mutual giving between gods and humans may continue. Reflexes of *Manu include Indic Manu, Germanic Mannus; of Yemo, Indic Yama, Avestan Yima, Norse Ymir, possibly Roman Remus (< earlier Old Latin *Yemos).|$|E
