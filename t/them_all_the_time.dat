500|$|Sportswriters {{and fans}} have {{frequently}} called for Henderson to be {{inducted into the}} Hockey Hall of Fame on the strength of his performance. [...] Commentator and former NHL coach Don Cherry argued that Henderson's status as hero of the [...] "greatest series in hockey history" [...] was enough to qualify him. [...] Henderson himself does not believe he belongs: [...] "So many Canadians get upset that I’m not in the Hall of Fame, and I tell <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> if I was on the committee, I wouldn’t vote for me. Quite frankly, I didn’t have a Hall of Fame career." [...] Henderson has been honoured by Canada's Sports Hall of Fame on two occasions: he was first inducted as an individual in 1995, and again ten years later along with his 1972 teammates. The Summit Series team has also been honoured with a star on Canada's Walk of Fame. Henderson has been inducted into the Ontario Sports Hall of Fame (1997), the IIHF Hall of Fame (2013) and has been honoured by Hockey Canada with the Order of Hockey in Canada as part of its 2013 class. He was named a Member of the Order of Canada in December 2012 in recognition of [...] "his engagement in support of a range of social and charitable causes" [...] along with his achievements on the ice. In 2014, he was named to the Order of Ontario.|$|E

These people carry around all of their possessions with <b>them</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> {{because they have no}} place to store them. If they had no access to or capability to get to a shelter and possible bathing, or access to toilets and laundry facilities, their hygiene was lacking.

5000|$|... "I'm Goin' Down" [...] {{features}} an energetic rhythm, propelled by a heavy drumbeat by Weinberg, and contains a saxophone solo by Clemons. The music has a basic chord progression of A-E-F#m-D. In concerts in 1984, Springsteen introduced the song by describing the diminishing intimacy and sexual activity {{that can occur}} {{over the course of}} a romantic relationship: [...] "First you're making love to <b>'em</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>time,</b> three or four times a day. Then you come back a little bit later, and, uh-oh ... it's like 'Are you gonna make love to me tonight, or are we gonna wait for the full moon again', y'know?" [...] The song's lyrics include lines such as [...] "I'm sick and tired of you setting me up / Setting me up just to knock-a knock-a knock-a me down" [...] and [...] "You used to love to drive me wild / But lately girl you get your kicks from just driving me down". The lyrics later turn into a stream of gibberish syllables.|$|R
