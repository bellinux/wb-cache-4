5|$|By 1915 when Tolkien {{was writing}} his first elven poems, the words elf, fairy and gnome had many {{divergent}} and contradictory associations. Tolkien had been gently warned against {{using the term}} 'fairy', which John Garth supposes {{may have been due}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> becoming increasingly used to indicate homosexuality, although despite this warning Tolkien continued to use it.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the name}} fisher, {{the animal is}} not known to eat fish. The name is instead related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> fitch, meaning a European polecat (Mustela putorius) or pelt thereof, due to the {{resemblance}} to that animal. The name comes from colonial Dutch equivalent fisse or visse. In the French language, the pelt of a polecat is also called fiche or fichet.|$|E

5|$|The word herbal {{is derived}} from the mediaeval Latin liber herbalis ("book of herbs"): it is {{sometimes}} used in contrast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> florilegium, which is a treatise on flowers with emphasis on their beauty and enjoyment rather than the herbal emphasis on their utility. Much of the information found in printed herbals arose out of traditional medicine and herbal knowledge that predated the invention of writing.|$|E

5|$|In the 19th {{century the}} French word kilo, a {{shortening}} of kilogramme, was imported into the English language {{where it has}} been used to mean both kilogram and kilometre. While kilo is acceptable in many generalist texts, for example The Economist, its use is typically considered inappropriate in certain applications including scientific, technical and legal writing, where authors should adhere strictly to SI nomenclature. When the United States Congress gave the metric system legal status in 1866, it permitted {{the use of the word}} kilo as an alternative <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> kilogram, but in 1990 revoked the status of the word kilo.|$|E

5|$|In Baptism, Rebaptism, and Infant Baptism, Zwingli {{outlined}} his {{disagreements with}} both the Catholic and the Anabaptist positions. He accused the Anabaptists of adding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> of God and noted {{that there is no}} law forbidding infant baptism. He challenged Catholics by denying that the water of baptism can have the power to wash away sin. Zwingli understood baptism to be a pledge or a promise, but he disputed the Anabaptist position that it is a pledge to live without sin, noting that such a pledge brings back the hypocrisy of legalism. He argued against their view that those that received the Spirit and were able to live without sin were the only persons qualified to partake in baptism. At the same time he asserted that rebaptism had no support in scripture. The Anabaptists raised the objection that Christ did not baptise children, and so Christians, likewise, should not baptise their children. Zwingli responded by noting that kind of argument would imply women should not participate in communion because there were no women at the last supper. Although there was no commandment to baptise children specifically, the need for baptism was clearly stated in scripture. In a separate discussion on original sin, Zwingli denies original guilt. He refers to I Corinthians 7:12–14 which states that the children of one Christian parent are holy and thus they are counted among the sons of God. Infants should be baptised because there is only one church and one baptism, not a partial church and partial baptism.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{differences}} in lifestyle promoted by church doctrine and history, {{members of the church}} have developed a distinct culture.

As new members have joined around the world, many of the church's more distinctive practices have become part of new congregations, such as adhering <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Word</b> of Wisdom, a health law or code prohibiting the consumption of tobacco, alcohol, coffee, tea, and illegal drugs. As a result of members adhering <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Word</b> of Wisdom, areas of the world with a high concentration of LDS members practice these restrictions.
