It was at that time believed that a great river entered the Indian Ocean from the north-west of Australia, and that the country it drained might be suitable for colonisation. Grey, in conjunction with Lieutenant Franklin Lushington, of the 9th (East Norfolk) Regiment of Foot, offered to explore <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>and</b> on 5 July 1837 he sailed from Plymouth in command of a party of five, the others being Lushington; Dr William Walker, a surgeon and naturalist; and Corporals Coles and Auger of the Royal Sappers and Miners.|$|E

25|$|Immigrant {{children}}—defined {{as those}} {{children under age}} eighteen who are either foreign-born or U.S.-born to immigrant parents—now account for one-fourth of the nation’s 75 million children. By 2050 they are projected to make up one-third of more than 100 million U.S. children. This highlights that children of immigrants in mixed status families are growing in the United States. Therefore, it is of high importance to understand their experiences in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>and</b> the impact that a mixed status has on the children growing up in these families facing unique needs and challenges. Mixed immigrant families’ rights are being violated. When there is family separation through immigration practices, children in mixed status household are {{denied the right to}} grow up with their families. They are dehumanized, based on status of their parents.|$|E
25|$|The {{white race}} deems {{itself to be}} the {{dominant}} race in <b>this</b> <b>country.</b> <b>And</b> so it is in prestige, in achievements, in education, in wealth and in power. So, I doubt not, {{it will continue to}} be for all time if it remains true to its great heritage and holds fast to the principles of constitutional liberty. But in view of the constitution, {{in the eye of the}} law, there is in this country no superior, dominant, ruling class of citizens. There is no caste here. Our constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens. In respect of civil rights, all citizens are equal before the law. The humblest is the peer of the most powerful. The law regards man as man, and takes no account of his surroundings or of his color when his civil rights as guaranteed by the supreme law of the land are involved....|$|E
25|$|In 1984, in {{recognition}} of her charitable works, Kuroyanagi was appointed to be a Goodwill Ambassador for UNICEF, being the first person from Asia to hold this position. During the late 1980s and the 1990s, she visited many developing countries in Asia and Africa for charitable works and goodwill missions, helping children who had suffered from disasters and war as well as raising international awareness of the situations of children in poor countries. Her visit to Angola in 1989 was the first recorded VIP visit from Japan to <b>this</b> <b>country,</b> <b>and</b> marked a milestone for the diplomatic relation between Japan and Angola. Kuroyanagi {{has raised more than}} $20 million for the UNICEF programmes that she has been involved in, through television fund-raising campaigns.

25|$|While some whites {{responded with}} {{violence}} or exploitation of Mexicans, another recurring effort was Americanization. Since many Mexicans were now {{a part of}} the United States, it was expected that they would act like Americans. The national language in the U.S. is English, so it was thought that the Mexican Americans should be speaking English like the rest of Americans. In 1907, United States’ President Theodore Roosevelt wrote, “We have room for but one language in <b>this</b> <b>country,</b> <b>and</b> that is the English language, for we intend to see that the crucible turns our people out as Americans, of American nationality, and not as dwellers in a polyglot boarding house”. It was clear that a lot of Americans were hostile towards Spanish speaking Mexicans. The English Only movement is a political movement for establishing English as the only official language in the U.S., and using only English in official government operations. Learning a new language as an adult is a very difficult thing to do, so this effect of imperialism was challenging for a lot of new Americans.|$|E
25|$|An {{asylum seeker}} is a {{displaced}} person or immigrant who has formally sought {{the protection of}} the state they fled to as well as the right to remain in <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>and</b> who is waiting for a decision on this formal application. An asylum seeker may have applied for Convention refugee status or for complementary forms of protection. Asylum is thus a category that includes different forms of protection. Which form of protection is offered depends on the legal definition that best describes the asylum seeker's reasons to flee. Once the decision was made the asylum seeker will either be given Convention refugee status or a complementary form of protection and can stay in the country, or will be refused asylum and then often has to leave. Only after the state, territory or the UNHCR, wherever the application was made, has recognised the protection needs, the asylum seeker will be officially referred to as a refugee in the more specific context and enjoys refugee status. This carries certain rights and obligations according to the legislation of the receiving country.|$|E
