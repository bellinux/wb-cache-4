5|$|About 20 large (40–150m across) ejecta blocks {{have been}} identified, {{embedded}} in Ida's regolith. Ejecta blocks constitute the largest {{pieces of the}} regolith. Because ejecta blocks are expected to break down quickly by impact events, those present on the surface must have been either formed recently or uncovered by an impact event. Most of them are located within the craters Lascaux and Mammoth, {{but they may not}} have been produced <b>there.</b> <b>This</b> area attracts debris due to Ida's irregular gravitational field. Some blocks may have been ejected from the young crater Azzurra {{on the opposite side of}} the asteroid.|$|E
5|$|Activity in {{the central}} Pacific was also above average. Two {{tropical}} storms formed, as did several tropical depressions. A number of storms moved in from the east. With a total of nine tropical cyclones entering or forming <b>there,</b> <b>this</b> was the fourth highest number since satellite observations began. The first storm formed on June 1. The last storm dissipated December 21, which gives this season the latest known end. However, if December 6, the date the last storm crossed the dateline is taken to be the end, this season has the second latest end, behind the 1983 season and tied with the 1957 season.|$|E
5|$|Although {{social order}} was {{maintained}} throughout the plague years, {{the economy of}} the region was devastated. However, the surviving merchant community were very influential in the city and, {{in the wake of the}} catastrophe, set about increasing the council's influence around the market, buying many of the surrounding shops. The council also bought a set of wharves along King Street near Dragon Hall in 1397 and decreed that all goods entering Norwich by water be unloaded <b>there.</b> <b>This</b> ensured almost complete control of Norwich trade by the merchants who now dominated the council.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding the album's {{thematic}} content, Daniel Rossen noted, [...] "There's {{a lot of}} {{talk about}} negotiating distance from people in your life. We were dealing with that in various forms, learning what it means to be alone, learning what it means to be close to somebody, certain things coming to a head. It just feels like a major difficulty in life." [...] Droste elaborated, [...] "There's a desire to be autonomous, but <b>there's</b> also <b>this</b> great fear of being alone, and <b>there's</b> <b>this</b> constant feeling of, 'How do you reconcile this?' <b>There's</b> <b>this</b> need for space, but <b>there's</b> also <b>this,</b> 'Come closer come closer.'" ...|$|R
5|$|Following a {{fuel stop}} at Nicosia International Airport, the pilots {{were forced to}} fly towards Munich-Riem Airport, where the hijackers {{initially}} had intended the exchange to take place. When the aircraft had arrived in Austrian airspace at around noon and it became evident that their demands could not be fulfilled in time, this plan was changed, and the Lufthansa crew had to divert instead to Zagreb {{in what was then}} the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, circling over Zagreb Airport until the Black September members had been brought <b>there.</b> <b>This</b> put the Germans under a pressure of time, as the aircraft would eventually run out of fuel.|$|E
5|$|I'll {{say that}} the Ukrainian people treated me well.

But far be it from me to inflate my significance. The entire Ukrainian people was exerting great efforts... I attribute Ukraine's successes to the Ukrainian people as a whole. I won't elaborate further on this theme, but in principle it's very easy to demonstrate. I'm Russian myself, and I don't want to offend the Russians.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the Navy {{withdrew from the}} project. Stormfury began to refocus its efforts on understanding, rather than modifying, {{tropical}} cyclones. At the same time, the Project's aircraft were {{nearing the end of}} their operational lifetimes. At the cost of $30million (year unknown) two Lockheed P-3's were acquired. Due to the rarity of Atlantic hurricanes meeting the safety requirements, plans were made to move Stormfury to the Pacific and experiment on the large number of typhoons <b>there.</b> <b>This</b> action required many of the same safety requirements as in the Atlantic, but had the advantage of a much higher number of potential subjects.|$|E

5|$|Parthian art, {{with its}} {{distinct}} use of frontality in portraiture, was lost and abandoned with the profound {{cultural and political}} changes brought by the Sassanid Empire. However, even after the Roman occupation of Dura-Europos in 165 AD, the use of Parthian frontality in portraiture continued to flourish <b>there.</b> <b>This</b> is exemplified by the early 3rd-century AD wall murals of the Dura-Europos synagogue, a temple {{in the same city}} dedicated to Palmyrene gods, and the local Mithraeum.|$|E

5|$|As hats {{go out of}} fashion, the {{anthropomorphic}} bear Popol the Hatter {{heads into}} the American West with his wife Virginia and blue donkey, Bluebell. Setting up camp {{in the land of}} the Bunnokee, a tribe of anthropomorphic rabbit Native Americans, he does good business <b>there.</b> <b>This</b> infuriates the Bunnokee medicine man, whose feather headdress business has declined as a result. He and the Chief of the Bunnokees conspire to eradicate the economic threat, launching war against Popol. Using technology that is more advanced than the Bunnokee's bow and arrows, Popol defeats the rabbits' initial attacks, but they retaliate by abducting Virginia and threatening to torture her. Popol then rescues her, and together they escape, coming upon a river in which they discover gold.|$|E

5|$|By 1169 Coutances held a canonry in Rouen Cathedral. During the 1170s a {{group of}} royal clerks rose to prominence, among them Coutances, Walter Map, Ralph Diceto, John of Oxford, Richard of Ilchester, and Geoffrey Ridel. Coutances was the {{chaplain}} to Henry the Young King, eldest living son of King Henry, but when the younger Henry rebelled against his father in 1173, Coutances returned to King Henry's service. He became Archdeacon of Oxford, perhaps by 1173, certainly by 14 March 1176. He was named vice-chancellor when Ralph de Warneville became Chancellor of England, which occurred in 1173. In 1176 and 1177, King Henry sent Coutances on diplomatic missions to Flanders and the French royal court. Arnulf, the Bishop of Lisieux, alleged that Henry allowed Coutances to use all the administrative machinery of Normandy to drive Arnulf from his diocese, so that Coutances might become bishop <b>there.</b> <b>This</b> happened in early 1178, but the only real evidence for this effort on Coutances' part comes from Arnulf's correspondence, and as Coutances was back in England by July 1178, {{it does not appear}} that the attempt was a sustained one.|$|E
5|$|Cofresí's sudden {{success was}} an oddity, {{nearly a century}} {{after the end of}} the Golden Age of Piracy. By this time, joint {{governmental}} efforts had eradicated rampant buccaneering by Anglo-French seamen (primarily based on Jamaica and Tortuga), which had turned the Caribbean into a haven for pirates attacking shipments from the region's Spanish colonies; this made his capture a priority. By late 1823, the pursuit on land probably forced Cofresí to move his main base of operations to Mona; the following year, he was often <b>there.</b> <b>This</b> base, initially a temporary haven with Barrio Pedernales his stable outpost, became more heavily used. Easily accessible from Cabo Rojo, Mona had been associated with pirates for more than a century; it was visited by William Kidd, who landed in 1699 after fleeing with a load of gold, silver and iron. A second pirate base was found at Saona, an island south of Hispaniola.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{attempts}} {{to take the}} crippled Szent István into tow by Tegetthoff, the ship continued to sink and the attempt was abandoned. A few minutes after 6:00am Szent István sank.

A month prior to the meeting, Franklin published his Join, or Die political cartoon, an infamous graphical representation of the Plan of Union.|$|E
