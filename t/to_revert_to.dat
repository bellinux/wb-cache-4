5|$|In the subplot, Moe {{decides to}} expand his {{customer}} base by turning his tavern into a family restaurant. The stress of running the business by himself ultimately unnerves him and he soon snaps at a little girl. The restaurant is a failure, forcing Moe <b>to</b> <b>revert</b> <b>to</b> a run-down tavern.|$|E
5|$|Although the Act of 1975 had {{specified}} that {{a portion of}} the profits from land sales be used to maintain the remaining cemetery, little restoration work was done and the cemetery continued <b>to</b> <b>revert</b> <b>to</b> wilderness. With the new owners of the land interested only in redeveloping those parts of the cemetery not currently in use, the cemetery itself sank further into neglect.|$|E

5|$|Breeding {{of animals}} and plants showed related {{varieties}} varying in similar ways, or tending <b>to</b> <b>revert</b> <b>to</b> an ancestral form, and similar patterns of variation in distinct species were explained by Darwin as demonstrating common descent. He recounted how Lord Morton's mare apparently demonstrated telegony, offspring inheriting characteristics of a previous mate of the female parent, and accepted this process as increasing the variation available for natural selection.|$|E
5|$|Kauri gum is a fossilised resin detracted from kauri trees (Agathis australis), {{which is}} made into crafts such as jewellery. Kauri forests once covered much of the North Island of New Zealand, before Māori and European {{settlers}} caused deforestation, causing several areas <b>to</b> <b>revert</b> <b>to</b> sand dunes, scrubs, and swamps. Even afterward, ancient kauri fields continued to provide a source for the gum and the remaining forests.|$|E
5|$|The {{most urgent}} problem facing the new Emperor was the {{scarcity}} of resources left in the imperial treasury. Basiliscus was forced to raise heavy taxes, and <b>to</b> <b>revert</b> <b>to</b> the practice of auctioning the offices, obviously causing a diffuse discontent in the population. He also extorted money from the church, {{with the help of}} the Prefect Epinicus, Verina's long-time favourite.|$|E
50|$|Some market {{commentators}} {{predicted that}} this would lead <b>to</b> originators <b>reverting</b> <b>to</b> traditional limited recourse language, particularly as the tax advantages related to PECOs no longer subsisted.|$|R

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} each season, fans vote {{directly}} for the Player of the Season. Historically this has been conducted by post, but in recent years it has taken place on the Watford Observer's website. This system was earmarked for change to a match-by-match rating system in 2009, but in March 2010, the Observer decided <b>to</b> <b>revert</b> <b>to</b> the traditional method of voting.|$|E
5|$|Win32 console windows {{can now be}} resized {{without any}} restrictions, {{can be made to}} cover the full screen by {{pressing}} , and can use standard keyboard shortcuts, such as those for cut, copy, and paste. Other features such as word wrap and transparency were also added. These functions can be disabled <b>to</b> <b>revert</b> <b>to</b> the legacy console, if needed.|$|E
5|$|A {{city can}} be created from a town by Saskatchewan's Minister of Municipal Relations by ministerial order via section 39 of The Cities Act {{if it has a}} {{population}} of 5,000 or more and the change in status is requested by the town council. A city does not automatically revert to town status if the population drops below 5,000; this only occurs if the city council requests it, the majority of electors vote <b>to</b> <b>revert</b> <b>to</b> town status, or the minister is of the opinion that the reversion to town status is in the public interest. Melville retains its city status despite dropping below the 5,000 population threshold in the 1990s.|$|E

50|$|The Bourses du Travail survived, {{often as}} a single {{organisation}} union hall, while the history of splits in the French labour movement saw the buildings pass from one hand <b>to</b> another, <b>revert</b> <b>to</b> municipalities, or disappear entirely.|$|R
5|$|Gloucester's {{precarious}} {{health was}} {{a constant source of}} worry to his mother. His death, in 1700 at the age of eleven, precipitated a succession crisis as his mother was the only individual remaining in the Protestant line of succession established by the Bill of Rights 1689. The English Parliament did not want the throne <b>to</b> <b>revert</b> <b>to</b> a Catholic, and so passed the Act of Settlement 1701, which settled the throne of England on Electress Sophia of Hanover, a cousin of King James II, and her Protestant heirs.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, Biman {{went through}} a {{rebranding}} exercise and unveiled a new logo and livery, designed by Teague, which was applied to its leased Boeing 777 and 737 aircraft. However, following change of government, Biman was forced <b>to</b> <b>revert</b> <b>to</b> the original branding as the new brand image was not endorsed by the incoming government. The carrier has adopted a new, more modern revised version of its livery, that {{was applied to the}} new Boeing 777-300ERs delivered in late 2011.|$|E
5|$|Opposing the {{decentralisation}} stance {{taken in}} the treaty, Pavlov {{was one of the}} key players in the establishment of the State Committee for the State of Emergency in August 1991. Pavlov's inclusion in the committee has been used to demonstrate its unwillingness <b>to</b> <b>revert</b> <b>to</b> pre-Gorbachev policies. The Committee's main goal was to ensure that the Soviet Union continued as a highly centralised union state. The Emergency Committee was led by Gennady Yanayev, Vice President of the Soviet Union, Interior Minister Boris Pugo, Defence Minister Dmitry Yazov and other hardliners who were determined to take action to oust Gorbachev.|$|E
50|$|The curious plot of {{allotment}} gardens at {{the main}} entrance date from 1940 when many school grounds were used for such purposes but {{here is one of}} the few examples not <b>to</b> have <b>reverted</b> <b>to</b> school grounds.|$|R

50|$|At the 2005 general election, Thomas was {{narrowly}} {{defeated by}} the Conservative Party candidate David Jones. Before 1997, Clwyd West had been regarded as a safe Conservative seat and now appears <b>to</b> be <b>reverting</b> <b>to</b> its traditional character.|$|R
5|$|The Chalk River reactor {{was shut}} down for {{maintenance}} in August 2009, and reopened in August 2010. The Petten reactor had a 6-month scheduled maintenance shutdown on Friday, February 19, 2010, and reopened September 2010. With millions of procedures relying on technetium-99m every year, the low supply has left a gap, leaving some practitioners <b>to</b> <b>revert</b> <b>to</b> techniques not used for 20 years. Somewhat allaying this issue is an announcement from the Polish Maria research reactor that they have developed a technique to isolate technetium.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} and {{opening of the}} Erie Canal in 1825 along the same alignment as the Albany to Buffalo route began to eat away at the revenues of these turnpike companies. In time, the turnpike business had become unprofitable and the companies were dissolved by 1852, causing the roads <b>to</b> <b>revert</b> <b>to</b> public control. The Seneca Road Company dissolved in 1852. The old, southern path of the Seneca Turnpike is now Franklin Street and Old Seneca Turnpike from Auburn to Marcellus, NY175 between Marcellus and Onondaga Hill, and NY173 from there east to Chittenango.|$|E
5|$|With {{the area}} around Woking by this time heavily populated, the LNC's land {{holdings}} had become an extremely valuable asset, and from 1955 onwards the LNC became a target for repeated hostile takeover bids from property speculators. In January 1959 the Alliance Property Company announced the successful takeover of the London Necropolis Company, bringing over a century of independence to an end. Alliance Property was a property company with {{little interest in the}} funeral business, and the income from burials was insufficient to maintain the cemetery grounds. Brookwood Cemetery went into decline and the cemetery began <b>to</b> <b>revert</b> <b>to</b> wilderness. This trend continued under a succession of further owners.|$|E

5|$|Before {{establishing}} the party, Mike Nattrass {{had long been}} involved with Britain's Eurosceptic movement. In 1994, Nattrass joined the New Britain Party and unsuccessfully stood for the group in the Dudley West by-election of the same year. Alike most New Britain candidates, Nattrass was absorbed into and stood in Solihull for the single-issue Referendum Party at the 1997 general election. Led by James Goldsmith, this party's policy was for a referendum to be held on the UK's relationship with the European Union (EU), specifically {{as to whether the}} British population {{wanted to be part of}} a federal European state or whether they wanted the EU <b>to</b> <b>revert</b> <b>to</b> being a free-trade bloc without wider political functions. Nattrass subsequently joined the UK Independence Party (UKIP) and eventually rose to the positions of Party Chairman and Deputy Leader. As the UKIP candidate, he was elected as a representative for the West Midlands constituency in the 2004 European Parliament election, and was re-elected in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Darlington {{moved to}} the all-seater, 25,000-capacity Darlington Arena in 2003. The cost of the stadium was {{a major factor in}} driving the club into {{administration}}. In May 2012, the club was bought out of a period of administration without entering into a Creditors Voluntary Agreement (CVA). The Football Association ruled that it should be treated as a new club, which required a change of playing name. The name chosen was Darlington 1883, and that team was placed in the Northern League Division One, the ninth tier of English football, for the 2012–13 season. They won three promotions in four seasons before the FA approved their request <b>to</b> <b>revert</b> <b>to</b> their traditional name.|$|E
5|$|Gloucester's death destabilised the succession, as {{his mother}} {{was the only person}} {{remaining}} in the Protestant line to the throne established by the Bill of Rights 1689. Although Anne had ten other pregnancies after the birth of Gloucester, none of them resulted in a child who survived more than briefly after birth. The English parliament did not want the throne <b>to</b> <b>revert</b> <b>to</b> a Catholic, so it passed the Act of Settlement 1701, which settled the throne of England on a cousin of King James, Sophia, Electress of Hanover, and her Protestant heirs. Anne succeeded King William in 1702, and reigned until her death on 1 August 1714. Sophia predeceased her by a few weeks, and so Sophia's son George ascended the throne as the first British monarch of the House of Hanover.|$|E

5000|$|When Korvac returns, Reptil and {{his fellow}} studies are placed into future {{versions}} of their bodies to fight him by Korvac's estranged lover, Carina. After Korvac is defeated, Reptil finds himself trapped in his older body. On a day trip to New York, the students run afoul of Arcade, during which Reptil meets Spider-Girl, and they quickly become friends. Spider-Girl attends Academy's [...] "prom night". When she tells him that she liked him the way he was, Reptil then decides <b>to</b> <b>reverts</b> <b>to</b> his teenage body.|$|R
