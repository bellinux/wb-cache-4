40|$|An {{experimental}} and numerical investigation {{was performed in}} order to firstly establish the aerodynamics and aeroacoustics of a landing gear <b>torque</b> <b>link</b> configuration, and secondly to assess the effectiveness of both passive and active flow control as noise attenuation methods. Experimental and numerical data showed that afixing a <b>torque</b> <b>link</b> on to a half cylinder strut resulted in the suppression of vortex shedding in between the torque arms. This resulted in a narrower wake with reduced drag. PIV wake profiles showed the suppression of shedding to result in reduced velocity fluctuations, as shown by reductions in shear and normal Reynolds stresses. Simulation showed attaching the <b>torque</b> <b>link</b> to the strut {{to result in a}} reduction of farfield noise levels by up to 7. 5 dB. Altering the <b>torque</b> <b>link</b> angle ttheta was shown to affect the aerodynamic field, with a decrease in drag and wake strength, as shown by a reduction in mean and fluctuating velocities. However, altering the <b>torque</b> <b>link</b> angle was shown to have little affect on near field acoustics. Altering the yaw angle φ from φ = 0 º to 180 º was shown to affect periodic vortex shedding from the strut, with shedding occurring at lower frequencies for φ = 90 º and 135 º. Phased microphone array data showed interaction between the strut's wake and the downstream <b>torque</b> <b>link</b> to be the major source of noise for yaw angles with the <b>torque</b> <b>link</b> almost or entirely aligned with the strut. This interaction noise decreased when the <b>torque</b> <b>link</b> was out of alignment with the strut. The major source of noise for these yaw angles became edge noise due to the <b>torque</b> <b>link</b> extending into the freestream. Both {{experimental and}} numerical acoustics showed φ = 0 º and 180 º to exhibit the loudest OASPL. A conformal fairing applied over the <b>torque</b> <b>link</b> 'gap region' was found to be effective in attenuating interaction noise. The most effective application of the fairing was found for the standard yaw angle of φ = 0 º, with noise reductions of up to 4. 5 dB. Active flow control applied in the form of blowing from the landing gear strut was also found to be effective at reducing interaction noise when applied from blowing angles of 30 º and 90 º. Blowing was found to reduce the strength of the wake and to deflect the wake away from the downstream <b>torque</b> <b>link,</b> resulting in a decrease in tonal noise by up to 10. 3 dB and a reduction in broadband noise of up to 6 dB over 0. 01 ≤ St ≤ 1. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Plasma {{actuators}} {{were used}} in this work to control flow-induced broadband noise radiated from a bluff body. The model consists of a cylinder and a component (<b>torque</b> <b>link)</b> that is installed on the lee side of the cylinder. The objective {{is to reduce the}} broadband noise mainly generated through the impingement of the cylinder wake on the <b>torque</b> <b>link.</b> The flow–structure interactions between the cylinder wake and the <b>torque</b> <b>link</b> are reduced by manipulating the cylinder wake with the externally imposed body force from the plasma actuators, which lead to the attenuation of the broadband noise. The control performance with the plasma actuators is studied in an anechoic chamber facility by examining far-field sound level and near-field acoustic source changes. At a free stream speed of 30 m/s, corresponding to the Reynolds number of 2. 1 × 105, far-field measurements suggested that a reduction of up to 3. 2 dB in overall sound pressure level.

40|$|Landing gear noise {{prediction}} method is developed using Building-Cube Method (BCM). The BCM is a multiblock-structured Cartesian mesh flow solver, {{which aims to}} enable practical large-scale computation. The computational domain is composed of assemblage of various sizes of building blocks where small blocks are used to capture flow features in detail. Because of Cartesian-based mesh, easy and fast mesh generation for complicated geometries is achieved. The airframe noise is predicted through the coupling of incompressible Navier-Stokes flow solver and the aeroacoustic analogy-based Curle’s equation. In this paper, Curle’s equation in noncompact form is introduced to predict the acoustic sound from an object in flow.

40|$|Structural design {{concepts}} for load bearing mechanical systems vary due to individual usage requirements. Particularly strut-configurations for landing gears in airplanes {{push the envelope}} according to tight requirements in shock absorption, normal, lateral and torsional load capacity, rolling stability, storage dimensions, low drag, low weight, and maintenance as well as reliability, safety and availability. Since the first controlled and powered flight of the Wright-Brothers in 1903, design evolution generated different structural {{design concepts}}. Today's structures may have, seemingly, reached mature conformity with distinct load path architectures that have been prevailed. In the proposed contribution, the authors evaluate and compare distinctive performance requirements like stroke ability and ride quality, elastic force retention, structure strength, and weight of mechanisms resulting from significant structural design concepts for main and nose landing gears. Loads in landing gears have always been distributed in struts with high and low amounts of strut members such as rods, beams, <b>torque</b> <b>links,</b> and joints as well as different types of absorbers. This paper's goal is to clarify {{pros and cons of}} the four different concepts with respect to their vulnerability due to uncertainty. Here, uncertainty mainly occurs due to variations in elastic force retention and their effect on the performance requirements.

40|$|This paper investigates numerically {{the flow}} and {{unsteady}} aerodynamics {{of a complex}} landing gear using Delayed Detached Eddy Simulation (DDES). The case studied is a six-wheel main landing gear with some medium and small components included, which has been measured previously in wind tunnel. The {{aim of this study}} is to extend landing gear modelling to more complicated geometry and to understand the unsteady aerodynamic loads and flow features around landing gears with complex configuration. A meshing strategy based on unstructured mesh is used to cope with the geometrical complexity. Carefully chosen refinement zones and structured boundary layer meshes are employed to improve the mesh quality, which helped to ensure the accuracy for the DDES simulation. A hex-dominated mesh with 37 million cells was generated with resolved boundary mesh using 10 - 21 layers on all landing gear components. It is found that flow around the bogie is more complex due to stronger interactions between wheels in close proximity for the six-wheel bogie. Other components, such as wheel axles, bogie pitch trimmer, forward dressing <b>link</b> and after <b>torque</b> <b>link</b> introduces flow unsteadiness in the bogie region. Statistics of mean and RMS forces for all components of the main landing gear are obtained. The drag on the front pair of wheels was found to be lower than the middle and the back wheels. The presence of forward and after side stays (or diagonal struts) on the landing gear possibly creates asymmetry in the flow field. This asymmetric flow features further changes the separation on and around the wheels and influence its wake region. The presence of the components like side stays, forward dressing link and the after <b>torque</b> <b>link</b> changes the wake pattern behind the cylindrical strut. This increases the mean drag coefficient of the main strut compared to that of a simple cylinder with similar geometrical dimensions. This suggests that smaller components may play a significant role in changing flow features around a bigger component. The RMS side force coefficient of the main strut is higher than the RMS lift and drag coefficients, indicating a possibility of strong interaction between the main strut and wheels. Also, efforts are made to understand the unsteadiness in the landing gear wake. This study contributes to the limited literature available for aircraft main landing gear configurations with more geometrical details...|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} {{a brief overview}} on the results obtained during the scale model landing gear test in the Acoustic Wind Tunnel Braunschweig 1. Noise tests were conducted on different 4 -wheel landing gear configurations with (i) deceleration plates and (ii) splitter plates. The results presented in this report indicate that deceleration plates when attached between the rear wheels downstream of the axle tend to reduce the farfield radiated landing gear noise by up to 4 dB. In {{the course of this}} test best results were obtained by means of an inner wheel deceleration plate in combination with a short lower leg deceleration plate. The installation of an upper leg deceleration plate was not effective in terms of noise reduction. For splitter plates when applied to several gear components different results were obtained. While the wheel splitter plates tend to increase noise levels nearly no effect was measured for splitter plates located at the main strut and the side stay. A slight noise reduction of about 1 dB was documented for both the <b>torque</b> <b>link</b> and the drag stay splitter plate configuration. The noise test on a 2 -wheel landing gear again proved the beneficial effect of an inner wheel deceleration plate on farfield radiated noise. ...|$|R
