25|$|A {{large number}} of notable people have been born, raised or lived in Bartow and the city's Chamber of Commerce {{suggests}} that few cities since Jamestown have produced as many prominent citizens per capita as Bartow. Many government officials and politicians {{have been associated with}} the city of Bartow since its founding. Perhaps the most notable is Spessard Holland, former Florida governor and U.S. Senator, who governed the state during World War Two and authored the 24th Amendment to the Constitution of the United States. An elementary school north of Bartow named in his honor, Spessard L. Holland Elementary opened in 2009. His predecessor in the U.S. Senate, Charles O. Andrews also attended school in Bartow. Others who were raised and schooled in Bartow include former Florida Supreme Court Chief Justice Stephen Grimes, former Florida Secretary of State Katherine Harris who had a key role during the 2000 U.S. Presidential election, and former U.S. congressman Adam Putnam. The most notable military officer from Bartow is four-star general James Van Fleet who was the commanding officer of the United Nations forces during the Korean War.

The record of a grant to Christ Church Cathedral, in which Domnall is styled [...] "King of Ireland", appears to suggest that he attempted to assert a claim to the kingship as well. In fact, the fifteenth-century Mac Carthaigh's Book specifically states that Domnall was installed in the kingship of Dublin by his father in 1114. Although Muirchertach Ua Briain's problems were lessened with the death Domnall mac Taidc in 1115, within the year the co-kings of LeinsterDonnchad mac Murchada (died 1115) and Conchobar Ua Conchobair Failge, King of Uí Failge (died 1115)took advantage of his own decline, and attempted to gain control of Dublin by way of a major assault upon the town. In fact, Domnall's father and grandfather had excluded the Kingdom of Leinster from overlordship of Dublin for <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>forty</b> <b>years.</b> Furthermore, not only was Conchobar was an unremitting opponent of Domnall's father, but Donnchad possessed several links to the kingship of Dublin as he was married to Domnall mac Taidc's sister, and further had a claim of his own, as both his father and grandfatherMurchad and Diarmait mac Maíl na mBóheld the kingship during their own careers.|$|E
