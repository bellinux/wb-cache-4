25|$|As {{the above}} {{summation}} argument shows, the Cantor set is uncountable but has Lebesgue measure 0. Since the Cantor set is the complement {{of a union}} of open sets, it itself is a closed subset of the reals, and therefore a complete metric space.

Unlike resin-bonded surfacing, where {{a thin layer of}} resin is applied to the surface and then the aggregate scattered on top (which can then become loose over time and is impermeable), resin and aggregates are thoroughly mixed together prior to laying, ensuring that the aggregate is completely coated and so providing a <b>totally</b> <b>bound</b> surface. As a result, a resin-bound surface is more durable and requires less maintenance - it needs to be swept or power washed at least twice a year, to avoid the buildup of detritus and prevent the growth of moss or algae.|$|R

60|$|The {{drawing of}} Coventry may be particularized as a farther {{example of this}} fine {{suggestion}} of irregularity and fitfulness, through very constant parallelism of direction, both in rain and clouds. The great mass of cloud, which traverses the whole picture, is characterized throughout by severe right lines, nearly parallel with each other, into which every one of its wreaths {{has a tendency to}} range itself; but no one of these right lines is actually and entirely parallel to any other, though all have a certain tendency, more or less defined in each, which impresses the mind with the most distinct idea of parallelism. Neither are any of the lines actually straight and unbroken; on the contrary, they are all made up of the most exquisite and varied curves, and it is the imagined line which joins the apices of these--a tangent to them all, which is in reality straight.[40] They are suggested, not represented, right lines; but the whole volume of cloud is visibly and <b>totally</b> <b>bounded</b> by them; and, in consequence, its whole body is felt to be dragged out and elongated by the force of the tempest which it carries with it, and every one of its wreaths to be (as was before explained) not so much something borne before or by the wind, as the visible form and presence of the wind itself. We could not possibly point out a more magnificent piece of drawing as a contrast to such works of Salvator as that before alluded to (159 Dulwich Gallery). Both are rolling masses of connected cloud; but in Turner's, there is not one curve that repeats another, nor one curve in itself monotonous, nor without character, and yet every part and portion of the cloud is rigidly subjected to the same forward, fierce, inevitable influence of storm. In Salvator's, every curve repeats its neighbor, every curve is monotonous in itself, and yet the whole cloud is curling about hither and thither, evidently without the slightest notion where it is going to, and unregulated by any general influence whatsoever. I could not bring together two finer or more instructive examples, the one of everything that is perfect, the other of everything that is childish or abominable, in the representation of the same facts.|$|E

In lake water, the positive samples numbered 13 of 54 (24 %) by culture and 32 of 54 (59 %) when PCR was applied. In seawater, they numbered 0 of 51 by culture and 18 of 51 (35 %) by PCR. Enterococci were found either <b>totally</b> <b>bound</b> to plankton or totally in water, depending on {{the presence or absence of}} plankton, respectively.

40|$|To {{construct}} a new tourist harbour in Marina di Ragusa (Sicily), the dredging of 300, 000 m 3 of marine sediment is required. To evaluate potential disposal options, a detailed physicochemical characterization {{of this material}} is needed. A very cost-effective solution {{is represented by the}} re-use of the dredged material for beach nourishment. To this aim, compliance with environmental standards and a strong homogeneity between the receiving beach and the source sediments must be proved. Analytical determinations for the main parameters show an arsenic content exceeding the Italian quality standard (12 mg·kg− 1). In order to evaluate arsenic mobility and availability, and therefore the actual release into the environment, a three-step sequential extraction procedure was applied to a limited number of samples. The results obtained seem to exclude the risk, showing that arsenic is almost <b>totally</b> <b>bound</b> to the resistant fraction and thus does not represent an impediment to the beneficial re-use of sediment. © 2011 Taylor & Francis...|$|R
