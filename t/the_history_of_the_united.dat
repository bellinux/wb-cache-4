5|$|August 24, 1992 - Hurricane Andrew makes {{landfall}} on Homestead, {{just south}} of Miami, as a Category Five hurricane with winds of 165mph (265km/h). The winds destroy 25,524homes and damage 101,241 others in southern Florida, leaving up to one-quarter million people temporarily homeless. In Homestead, more than 99% of all mobile homes are completely destroyed. Hurricane Andrew causes $25.5billion in damage (1992USD, $39.2billion 2008USD) in south Florida and 15 direct deaths. At the time, Andrew is the costliest North Atlantic hurricane in <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, though has since dropped to fifth after Hurricanes Katrina, Ike, Sandy, and Harvey.|$|E

5|$|Because Tropical Depression Ten never {{approached}} land as {{a tropical}} cyclone, no tropical cyclone watches and warnings were issued for any land masses. No effects, damages, or fatalities were reported, and no ships reported tropical storm-force winds {{in association with}} the depression. The system did not attain tropical storm status; as such, it was not given a name by the National Hurricane Center. The storm partially contributed to the formation of Hurricane Katrina, which became a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale and made landfall in Louisiana, causing catastrophic damage. Katrina was the costliest hurricane, and one of the five deadliest, in <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States.|$|E
5|$|The 1928 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season featured the Okeechobee hurricane, which was second deadliest tropical cyclone in <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States. Only eight tropical cyclones {{developed during the}} season. Of these eight tropical systems, seven of them intensified into a tropical storm and four further strengthened into hurricanes. One hurricane deepened into a major hurricane, which is Category3 or higher on the modern-day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. The first system, the Fort Pierce hurricane, developed near the Lesser Antilles on August3. The storm crossed the Bahamas and made landfall in Florida. Two fatalities and approximately $235,000 in damage was reported. A {{few days after the}} first storm developed, the Haiti hurricane, formed near the southern Windward Islands on August7. The storm went on to strike Haiti, Cuba, and Florida. This storm left about $2million in damage and at least 210deaths. Impacts from the third system are unknown.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} the 1928 Okeechobee {{hurricane}} in Florida included at least 2,500fatalities {{in the state of}} Florida, making this the second deadliest tropical cyclone in <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, behind only the 1900 Galveston hurricane. The hurricane originated from a tropical depression that formed near Dakar, Senegal, on September6. Traversing the Atlantic Ocean, the cyclone struck the Lesser Antilles, Puerto Rico, and the Bahamas as a powerful hurricane. Early on September17, the storm made landfall near West Palm Beach, Florida, as a Category4 hurricane on the modern day Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. Thereafter, it moved further inland across the Southeastern United States and became extratropical over North Carolina on September20, before the remnants lost their identity over Ontario on September21.|$|E

5|$|The {{historian}} Bartolomé Mitre {{stated that}} Manuel Belgrano held a deep admiration for George Washington, {{leader of the}} American Revolution and first President of the United States. Because of this, he worked on a translation of George Washington's Farewell Address into the Spanish language. He started working on it during the Paraguay Campaign, but before the battle of Tacuarí he destroyed all his papers, including the unfinished translation, {{to prevent them from}} falling into enemy hands. Belgrano resumed work on it afterwards and finished it before the Battle of Salta. He sent it to Buenos Aires for publication. George Washington's Farewell Address is considered, along with Gettysburg Address, {{one of the most important}} texts in <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States. It talks about the importance of keeping national unity as the key to maintain independence, prosperity, and freedom—ideas that were shared by Belgrano regarding the population of Hispanic America.|$|E
5|$|The {{most intense}} {{tropical}} cyclone {{of the season}} was Hurricane David. It moved across the Lesser Antilles in late August, with the worst hit islands being Dominica and Martinique. The storm then strengthened further and struck Dominican Republic as a Category5 hurricane. David was the strongest and deadliest tropical cyclone to make landfall in that country since 1930. In Dominican Republic alone, the system caused approximately 1,000deaths and $1billion in damage. Later, David brought wind damage, tornadoes, and flooding to portions of the East Coast of the United States. Overall, the storm resulted in 2,068deaths and $1.54billion in damage. Hurricane Frederic brought destruction to the Gulf Coast of the United States, especially in Alabama and Mississippi. With $2.3billion in damage, Frederic was the costliest hurricane in <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, until Hurricane Hugo ten years later.|$|E

5|$|Four {{passenger}} airliners {{operated by}} two major U.S. passenger air carriers (United Airlines and American Airlines) — {{all of which}} departed from airports in the northeastern United States bound for California — were hijacked by 19 al-Qaeda terrorists. Two of the planes, American Airlines Flight 11 and United Airlines Flight 175, were crashed into the North and South towers, respectively, of the World Trade Center complex in New York City. Within an hour and 42 minutes, both 110-story towers collapsed, with debris and the resulting fires causing partial or complete collapse of all other buildings in the World Trade Center complex, including the 47-story 7 World Trade Center tower, as well as significant damage to ten other large surrounding structures. A third plane, American Airlines Flight 77, was crashed into the Pentagon (the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense) in Arlington County, Virginia, leading to a partial collapse of the building's western side. The fourth plane, United Airlines Flight 93, was initially steered toward Washington, D.C., but crashed into a field in Stonycreek Township near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, after its passengers tried to overcome the hijackers. 9/11 was the single deadliest incident for firefighters and law enforcement officers in <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, with 343 and 72 killed respectively.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Betsy was {{the strongest}} and most devastating storm of the season. Extensive damage from Betsy was {{reported}} in the Bahamas, Florida, and Louisiana, particularly the New Orleans area. It was the first hurricane in <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States to result in at least $1billion (1965USD) in losses. Hurricane Carol meandered in the eastern Atlantic for over two weeks from mid-September to very early October. Impact on land from Carol was minimal. In late September, Tropical Storm Debbie developed in the northwestern Caribbean Sea and moved slowly across the region, before later reaching the Gulf of Mexico. The storm dissipated just offshore of Louisiana, which resulted in only minor impact along the Gulf Coast of the United States. The final tropical cyclone, Hurricane Elena, formed on October12. Elena remained at sea for nearly a week and caused no damage on land. Collectively, the storms of the 1965Atlantic hurricane season caused 76fatalities and $1.45billion in damage, almost entirely due to Hurricane Betsy.|$|E
5|$|In New York, {{strong winds}} on Long Island damaged about 1,000 houses, left 275,000people without electricity, downed many trees, and {{resulted}} in heavy crop losses. Storm surge flooded LaGuardia Airport and inundated the Montauk Highway, which left the eastern portion of Long Island isolated. Carol also brought strong winds and rough seas to coastal Connecticut, Rhode Island, and southeastern Massachusetts. Throughout the region, about 150,000people were left without electricity and telephone service. 1,545houses were destroyed and another 9,720were damaged. Approximately 3,500cars and 3,000boats were destroyed. There were 65deaths and 1,000injuries in New England. The storm caused an additional $1million in damage in Canada {{as well as two}} deaths. Overall, Carol caused 72fatalities and damage totaled $462million (1954USD), making it the costliest hurricane in <b>the</b> <b>history</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States, at the time.
