5|$|The James F. Byrnes Bridge {{was built}} in 1956.

40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{the use of}} the laser tracker to aid the {{alignment}} of a Swing Arm Profilometer (SAP) and measure the length of <b>the</b> <b>swinging</b> arm, thus calibrating the operating radius of the SAP. The measurement uncertainty analysis is given. A laser tracker is used to align the SAP to ensure the path of the probe head passes through the rotary axis of the rotary table. By building the coordinate system by laser tracker measurement on the rotary table and measuring <b>the</b> <b>swinging</b> arc of <b>the</b> arm, we can determine whether <b>the</b> <b>swinging</b> path of <b>the</b> probe head passes through the rotary axis of the rotary table and perform the corresponding adjustment if necessary. A laser tracker is also used to measure the arm length, i. e. the length between the probe's ball centre and the rotation axis of <b>the</b> <b>swinging</b> arm. By placing a retroreflector or the tracker ball on <b>the</b> <b>swinging</b> arm and scanning <b>the</b> <b>swinging</b> path of <b>the</b> arm using the laser tracker, we can acquire the data of an arc and fit to determine the length of the probe head center to rotation axis of swinging arm, thus giving accurate SAP calibration data...|$|R

5|$|A {{sequence}} of movements {{in which a}} horse takes a step with all four legs is called a stride. During each step, with each leg, a horse completes four movements: <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> phase, the grounding or impact, the support period and the thrust. While the horse uses muscles throughout its body to move, the legs perform the functions of absorbing impact, bearing weight, and providing thrust. Good movement is sound, symmetrical, straight, free and coordinated, all of which depend on many factors, including conformation, soundness, care and training of the horse, and terrain and footing. The proportions and length of the bones and muscles in the legs can significantly impact the way an individual horse moves. The angles of certain bones, especially in the hind leg, shoulders, and pasterns, also affect movement.|$|E
5|$|As the {{convention}} opened, some delegates favored Bayard, a conservative senator, while others supported Hancock, a career soldier and Civil War hero. Still others flocked to men {{they saw as}} surrogates for Tilden, including Henry B. Payne from Ohio, an attorney and former congressman, and Samuel J. Randall from Pennsylvania, the Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. The first round of balloting was inconclusive, with Hancock and Bayard leading the count. Before the second round, Tilden's withdrawal from the campaign became known for certain; delegates then shifted to Hancock, who was nominated. William Hayden English, a conservative politician and businessman from <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> state of Indiana, was nominated for vice president.|$|E
40|$|Objective. There {{is little}} {{descriptive}} {{research on the}} motion the body displays during <b>the</b> golf <b>swing.</b> <b>The</b> purpose {{of this research is}} to review <b>the</b> modern golf <b>swing</b> and compare its motion to <b>the</b> classic golf <b>swing.</b> Discussion. <b>The</b> comparison revealed subtle but significant differences in the backswing and the follow-through positions. The potential implications for power and injury, particularly of the lower back, are discussed. The discussion describes a third <b>swing,</b> <b>the</b> hybrid <b>swing,</b> which is a combination of the classic and modern <b>swing.</b> <b>The</b> hybrid <b>swing</b> may potentially reduce the chances of sustaining a low back injury while still retaining the power of <b>the</b> modern <b>swing.</b> Conclusion. <b>The</b> golf <b>swing</b> has evolved over time {{as a result of a}} combination of advanced equipment, course design and human experimentation. <b>The</b> hybrid <b>swing</b> is being taught by some golf professionals as a balance between the power-potential of <b>the</b> modern <b>swing</b> and <b>the</b> ‘back-friendly’ nature of <b>the</b> classic <b>swing,</b> though no studies have so far been conducted on its efficacy. Further investigation into <b>the</b> three golf <b>swings,</b> classic, modern and hybrid, is required to determine which <b>swing</b> is <b>the</b> most effective while also being friendly to the body. Such research will make possible the development programmes aimed at reducing golf injury rates, particularly to the lower back. 13 page(s...|$|R

5|$|Because the {{fireball}} {{was recorded}} by two cameras of the European Fireball Network, {{it was possible}} to calculate the trajectory of its flight through the atmosphere, and afterward also the characteristics of both its pre- and post-encounter orbit in the Solar System. The calculations were published by Czech astronomers Pavel Spurný, Zdeněk Ceplecha, and Jiří Borovička of the Ondřejov Observatory, who specialize in meteor observations. They demonstrated that <b>the</b> <b>swing</b> by the earth significantly altered the meteoroid's orbit. Its aphelion (the farthest it travels from the Sun) and orbital period were lowered to almost half of their original values. The object was initially in a highly inclined orbit (71°) and ended in an orbit with a slightly higher inclination (74°).|$|E

Later, Roode re-entered the ring with Hardy remaining at ringside, allowing Jeff Jarrett to attack Hardy from behind with a hockey stick. Jarrett then pushed Hardy into the ring with Roode covering for the pinfall victory at 9 minutes and 7 seconds.|$|E
5|$|By the 1830s the British Agricultural Revolution had {{disturbed}} traditional {{society and}} created a class of labourers who struggled to support their families in rural areas. This led to an unrest known as <b>the</b> <b>Swing</b> riots which swept across southern England, consequently reaching Selborne and Liphook in September 1830. The Parliamentary Enclosure Acts of 1856 established a new land pattern for nearby Steep Marsh and Stroud, which still exists today. There was also extensive land drainage between 1860 and 1880; conduits and sluices were constructed to take water from Ashford Stream for the artificial flooding of hay meadows. In Steep, hops were grown for use in local breweries, watercress produced for commercial use, and a condensed milk factory was in operation in Steep Marsh.|$|E
