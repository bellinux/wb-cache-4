5|$|The {{assembly}} {{voted on}} 17 February 2008 {{to use a}} variant of the first proposal. The modified version has an additional star, makes <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> equal in size, switches the colours of <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> and map, makes the map bigger, and arranges <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> in a curve above the map.|$|E
5|$|After {{they are}} formed, <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> in the {{globular}} cluster begin to interact gravitationally with each other. As a result, the velocity vectors of <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> are steadily modified, and <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> lose any {{history of their}} original velocity. The characteristic interval for this to occur is the relaxation time. This {{is related to the}} characteristic length of time a star needs to cross the cluster as well as the number of stellar masses in the system. The value of the relaxation time varies by cluster, but the mean value is on the order of 109 years.|$|E
5|$|Before {{tools such}} as the {{telescope}} were invented, early study of <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> was conducted using the naked eye. As civilizations developed, most notably in Mesopotamia, Greece, Persia, India, China, Egypt, and Central America, astronomical observatories were assembled, and ideas {{on the nature of}} the Universe began to be explored. Most of early astronomy actually consisted of mapping the positions of <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> and planets, a science now referred to as astrometry. From these observations, early ideas about the motions of the planets were formed, and the nature of the Sun, Moon and the Earth in the Universe were explored philosophically. The Earth was believed to be the center of the Universe with the Sun, the Moon and <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> rotating around it. This is known as the geocentric model of the Universe, or the Ptolemaic system, named after Ptolemy.|$|E
5000|$|To {{apply this}} method, one must measure the {{apparent}} magnitude of <b>the</b> <b>star</b> and know <b>the</b> spectral type of <b>the</b> <b>star.</b> <b>The</b> spectral type {{can be determined}} by observing <b>the</b> <b>star's</b> spectrum. If <b>the</b> <b>star</b> lies on <b>the</b> main sequence, as determined by its luminosity class, the spectral type of <b>the</b> <b>star</b> provides a good estimate of <b>the</b> <b>star's</b> absolute magnitude. Knowing the apparent magnitude (m) and absolute magnitude (M) of <b>the</b> <b>star,</b> one can calculate the distance (d, in parsecs) of <b>the</b> <b>star</b> using [...] (see distance modulus). The true distance to <b>the</b> <b>star</b> may be different than the one calculated due to interstellar extinction.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>star</b> is {{surrounded}} by a nebula of ejected material at 0.4-1.2pc from <b>the</b> <b>star.</b> <b>The</b> nebula contains around , all lost from <b>the</b> <b>star</b> around 10,000 years ago. There is an 8.8pc wide empty cavity in the interstellar medium around <b>the</b> <b>star,</b> presumably cleared by fast winds earlier in <b>the</b> <b>star's</b> life.|$|R

At {{the end of the}} season, Lyashenko had played 60 games with <b>the</b> <b>Stars</b> and {{recorded}} nine points. At the IHL level, he played in six games and had one assist. Lyashenko was popular with his teammates in Dallas, at one point his teammates lobbied Hitchcock to get him more playing time.|$|E
5|$|Early 4X {{games were}} {{influenced}} by board games and text-based computer games from the 1970s. Cosmic Balance II, Andromeda Conquest and Reach for <b>the</b> <b>Stars</b> were published in 1983, and are now seen retrospectively as 4X games. Although Andromeda Conquest was only a simple game of empire expansion, Reach for <b>the</b> <b>Stars</b> introduced the relationship between economic growth, technological progress, and conquest.|$|E
5|$|Early European astronomers such as Tycho Brahe {{identified}} {{new stars}} {{in the night sky}} (later termed novae), suggesting that the heavens were not immutable. In 1584 Giordano Bruno suggested that <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> were like the Sun, and may have other planets, possibly even Earth-like, in orbit around them, an idea that had been suggested earlier by the ancient Greek philosophers, Democritus and Epicurus, and by medieval Islamic cosmologists such as Fakhr al-Din al-Razi. By the following century, the idea of <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> being the same as the Sun was reaching a consensus among astronomers. To explain why these stars exerted no net gravitational pull on the Solar System, Isaac Newton suggested that <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> were equally distributed in every direction, an idea prompted by the theologian Richard Bentley.|$|E
50|$|The {{adoption}} of <b>the</b> <b>star</b> configuration {{goes back to}} <b>the</b> <b>star</b> used by <b>the</b> Mapuches. According to O'Higgins, <b>the</b> <b>star</b> of <b>the</b> flag was <b>the</b> <b>Star</b> of Arauco. In Mapuche iconography, <b>the</b> morning <b>star</b> or Venus, (Mapudungun: Wünelfe or the Hispanicized Guñelve) was represented through the figure of an octagram star or a foliated cross. Although, <b>the</b> <b>star</b> which was finally adopted bore a star having five points with {{the design of the}} guñelve remaining reflected in an asterisk inserted in the center of <b>the</b> <b>star,</b> representing <b>the</b> combination of European and indigenous traditions.|$|R

This evidence bolstered the hypothesis that heavier elements are the product of nucleosynthesis in stars. More recently, such observations provided evidence that elements are formed by neutron capture in the s-process.|$|E

50|$|When <b>the</b> <b>star</b> contracts, <b>the</b> {{density and}} {{temperature}} of the He II layer increases. He II starts to transform into He III (second ionization). This causes the opacity of <b>the</b> <b>star</b> to increase and the energy flux from the interior of <b>the</b> <b>star</b> is effectively absorbed. The temperature of <b>the</b> <b>star</b> rises and it begins to expand. After expansion, He III begins to recombine into He II and the opacity of <b>the</b> <b>star</b> drops. This lowers the surface temperature of <b>the</b> <b>star.</b> <b>The</b> outer layers contract and the cycle starts from the beginning.|$|R

5|$|In {{seventeenth century}} Spain, Lope de Vega, with a {{detailed}} knowledge of astronomy, wrote plays that ridicule astrology. In his pastoral romance La Arcadia (1598), {{it leads to}} absurdity; in his novela Guzman el Bravo (1624), he concludes that <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> were made for man, not man for <b>the</b> <b>stars.</b> Calderón de la Barca wrote the 1641 comedy Astrologo Fingido (The Pretended Astrologer); the plot was borrowed by the French playwright Thomas Corneille for his 1651 comedy Feint Astrologue.|$|E
5|$|In {{the seventh}} century, Isidore of Seville argued in his Etymologiae that {{astronomy}} described {{the movements of}} the heavens, while astrology had two parts: one was scientific, describing {{the movements of the}} sun, the moon and <b>the</b> <b>stars,</b> while the other, making predictions, was theologically erroneous. In contrast, John Gower in the fourteenth century defined astrology as essentially limited to the making of predictions. The influence of <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> was in turn divided into natural astrology, with for example effects on tides and the growth of plants, and judicial astrology, with supposedly predictable effects on people. The fourteenth century sceptic Nicole Oresme however included astronomy as a part of astrology in his Livre de divinacions. Oresme argued that current approaches to prediction of events such as plagues, wars, and weather were inappropriate, but that such prediction was a valid field of inquiry. However, he attacked the use of astrology to choose the timing of actions (so-called interrogation and election) as wholly false, and rejected the determination of human action by <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> on grounds of free will. The friar Laurens Pignon (c. 1368–1449) similarly rejected all forms of divination and determinism, including by <b>the</b> <b>stars,</b> in his 1411 Contre les Devineurs. This was in opposition to the tradition carried by the Arab astronomer Albumasar (787-886) whose Introductorium in Astronomiam and De Magnis Coniunctionibus argued the view that both individual actions and larger scale history are determined by <b>the</b> <b>stars.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Combined {{with a set}} of {{boundary}} conditions, {{a solution}} of these equations completely describes the behavior of <b>the</b> <b>star.</b> Typical boundary conditions set the values of the observable parameters appropriately at the surface (...) and center (...) of the star: , meaning the pressure at the surface of <b>the</b> <b>star</b> is zero; , there is no mass inside the center of <b>the</b> <b>star,</b> as required if the mass density remains , the total mass of <b>the</b> <b>star</b> is <b>the</b> <b>star's</b> mass; and , <b>the</b> temperature at the surface is the effective temperature of <b>the</b> <b>star.</b>|$|R
5000|$|For extrasolar planets the {{temperature}} of <b>the</b> <b>star</b> can be calculated from the color of <b>the</b> <b>star</b> using Planck's law. The calculated temperature of <b>the</b> <b>star</b> {{can be used with}} the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram to determine the absolute magnitude of <b>the</b> <b>star,</b> which can then be used with observational data to determine the distance to <b>the</b> <b>star</b> and finally <b>the</b> size of <b>the</b> <b>star.</b> Orbital simulations are used to determine what orbital parameters (including orbital distance) produce the observations seen by astronomers. Astronomers use a hypothesized albedo [...] and can then estimate the equilibrium temperature.|$|R
50|$|Atkinson {{became the}} {{controlling}} shareholder of <b>the</b> <b>Star.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Star</b> was frequently criticized for practising the yellow journalism of its era.

5|$|Opposition to heliocentrism and Galileo's {{writings}} combined {{religious and}} scientific objections and were fueled by political events. Scientific opposition came from Tycho Brahe and others and {{arose from the}} fact that, if heliocentrism were true, an annual stellar parallax should be observed, though none was. Copernicus had correctly postulated that parallax was negligible because <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> were so distant. However, Brahe had countered that, since stars appeared to have measurable size, if <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> were that distant, they would be gigantic, and in fact far larger than the Sun or any other celestial body. In Brahe's system, by contrast, <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> were a little more distant than Saturn, and the Sun and stars were comparable in size.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{valuable}} use of an accurate orbit for a binary star system is to directly calculate the masses of <b>the</b> <b>stars.</b> This requires the dimensions and inclination of the orbit to be accurately known. The dimensions of Eta Carinae's orbit are only known approximately as <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> cannot be directly and separately observed. The inclination has been modelled at 130–145 degrees, but the orbit is still not known accurately enough to provide the masses of the two components.|$|E

50|$|Another {{failure was}} {{the loss of}} <b>the</b> <b>star</b> tracker. <b>The</b> <b>star</b> tracker determines {{spacecraft}} orientation by comparing <b>the</b> <b>star</b> field to its internal charts.
