60|$|Theodora {{had spent}} the winter in <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of her brother.|$|E
6000|$|Carrie {{lifted her}} hand {{and laid it on}} his shoulder. [...] "Charley, I can't stop you now, but I want you to promise you will not go back again. Do you know that I sit still, shivering, when {{darkness}} comes while you are away, <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of what you may be doing? I daren't think. Can't you understand, Charley, that I have only you?" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{watched him}} as one would watch a vision out of a nightmare, then he {{continued}} on his way, <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think.</b> On his landing the landlady seemed {{to be waiting for}} him. She was a short, thick, shapeless woman with a large yellow face wrapped up everlastingly in a black woollen shawl. When she saw him come up the last flight of stairs she flung both her arms up excitedly, then clasped her hands before her face.|$|E
6000|$|She {{softened}} towards tears. [...] "I <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of it, {{and night}} and day he's haunting me. I <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of it. I've been for easy-going all my life. But I'm that worried and afraid, with death and ruin threatened and evil all about me! I don't know what to do! My own sister's son, and me a widow woman and 'elpless against his doin's!" ...|$|R
60|$|On this, Dickory's heart fell further. He {{had been}} troubled about the Scotchman, but had <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of him.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You must <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of it. I'm sure {{everything}} {{will turn out}} quite well. In another hour you'll have him with you again.' ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Strickland shuddered, for she {{had been}} <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of the {{separation}} that follows motherhood in India, and makes life there, for all that is written to the contrary, not quite the most desirable thing in the world. Adam trotted out to hear about more miracles, and his nurse must have worried him beyond bounds, for she came back weeping, saying that Adam Baba {{was in danger of}} being eaten alive by wild horses.|$|E
60|$|He groaned aloud, so {{that the}} Italians noticed it, and doubtless spoke of it among themselves. He could not {{understand}} their dialect, but he feigned them saying respectfully compassionate things. Then he gnashed his teeth again, and cursed his folly. When the bell rang for supper he found himself very hungry, and ate heavily. After that he went {{out in front of}} the cabin, and walked up and down, thinking, and <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think.</b> The turmoil in his mind tired him like a prodigious physical exertion.|$|E
60|$|What else in {{the world}} could she say? He would not get it till he woke about eleven. With the {{instinct}} to take all the respite she could, and knowing no more than before how she would receive his return, she went out in the forenoon and wandered about all day shopping and <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think.</b> Returning at tea-time, she went straight up to her baby, and there heard from Betty that he had come, and gone out with his violin to the music-room.|$|E
60|$|One morning, {{some two}} weeks after that evening of which she <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think,</b> Elizabeth, opening the door, found {{immediately}} outside it a folded scrap of paper. She unfolded it.|$|R
50|$|Reflecting back on {{his career}} and its three knee surgeries, Sampson {{admitted}} that he had attempted to come back too quickly from them, and said that he <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about what could have been.|$|R
60|$|As Kirk had endeavoured {{temporarily}} {{to forget}} Ruth, so had he <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of Mamie. It {{was the only}} thing he was ashamed of in the whole affair, the shock he must have given her.|$|R
6000|$|Meanwhile he had {{a curious}} little private {{conflict}} of his own. He was <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think,</b> day and night he was <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think,</b> that Lady Harman was now a very rich woman. Yet some portions of his brain, {{and he had never}} suspected himself of such lawless regions, persisted in the most vulgar and outrageous suggestions, suggestions that made his soul blush; schemes, for example, of splendid foreign travel, of hotel staffs bowing, of a yacht in the Mediterranean, of motor cars, of a palatial flat in London, of a box at the opera, of artists patronized, of--most horrible!--a baronetcy.... The more authentic parts of Mr. Brumley cowered from and sought to escape these squalid dreams of magnificences. It shocked and terrified him to find such things could come out in him. He was like some pest-stricken patient, amazedly contemplating his first symptom. His better part denied, repudiated. Of course he would never touch, never even propose--or hint.... It was an aspect he had never once contemplated before Sir Isaac died. He could on his honour, and after searching his heart, say that. Yet in Pall Mall one afternoon, suddenly, he caught himself with a thought in his head so gross, so smug, that he uttered a faint cry and quickened his steps.... Benevolent stepfather! ...|$|E
6000|$|She {{found herself}} {{alone in the}} train asking herself what she must do next, and <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of herself as cut off from home or any refuge {{whatever}} from the world she had resolved to face. She felt smaller and more adventurous even than she had expected to feel. [...] "Let me see," [...] she said to herself, trying to control a slight sinking of the heart, [...] "I am {{going to take a}} room in a lodging-house because that is cheaper.... But perhaps I had better get a room in an hotel to-night and look round....|$|E
60|$|He anxiously {{descended the}} ladder, and started homewards at a run, <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of giants, Herne the Hunter, Apollyon {{lying in wait}} for Christian, or of the captain with the {{bleeding}} hole in his forehead and the corpses round him that remutinied every night on board the bewitched ship. He {{knew that he had}} grown out of belief in these horrors, yet he was glad when he saw the church tower and the lights in the cottage windows, even though this was not the home of his birth, and his great-aunt did not care much about him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I will be {{as quiet}} as a mouse. You see if I ain't," [...] the {{midshipman}} said confidently; [...] "and I will <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think,</b> even once, of the water below there, so as <b>not</b> <b>to</b> hurry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My Romola, {{promise me}} to resist such thoughts; they are fit for sickly nuns, not for my golden-tressed Aurora, who looks made to scatter all such {{twilight}} fantasies. <b>Try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of them now; {{we shall not}} long be alone together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'She {{never made}} {{one in her}} life and I never saw one,' says Uncle Emsley, soothing. 'Calm down now, Jud--calm down. You've got excited, and that wound in your head is contaminating your sense of intelligence. <b>Try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about pancakes.' ...|$|R
60|$|Just at {{the moment}} I {{came out of the}} butcher-shop, a man emerged from the corner grocery that stood alongside. A queer sense {{familiarity}} made me look again. But the man had turned and was walking rapidly away. There was something about the slope of the shoulders and the fringe of silver hair between coat collar and slouch hat that aroused vague memories. Instead of crossing the street, I hurried after the man. I quickened my pace, <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> the thoughts that formed unbidden in my brain. No, it was impossible. It could not be--not in those faded overalls, too long in the legs and frayed at the bottoms.|$|E
6000|$|For {{a week or}} {{more the}} {{stricken}} financier confined himself mostly to his rooms, where he sat smoking cigarettes, gazing at Japanese prints, and <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about [...] "props" [...] and [...] "rehl." [...] Then, gradually, the almost maternal yearning to see his brain-child once more, which can never be wholly crushed out of a young dramatist, returned to him--faintly at first, then getting stronger by degrees till it could no longer be resisted. Otis Pilkington, having instructed his Japanese valet to pack a few simple necessaries in a suit-case, took a cab to the Grand Central Station and caught an afternoon train for Rochester, where his recollection of the route planned for the tour told him [...] "The Rose of America" [...] would now be playing.|$|E
60|$|What had Thalia {{been about}} to allow the message of that morning to creep into her comedy? a message announcing the coming of an {{intruder}} not in the play, {{in the person of}} a husband bearing gifts. What right had he, in the eternal essence of things, to return? He was out of all time and place. Such had been her feeling when she had first read the hastily written letter, but even when she had burned it it had risen again from the ashes. Anything but that! In <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of it, she had picked up the newspaper, learned of a railroad accident,--and shuddered. Anything but his return! Her marriage was a sin,--there could be no sacrament in it. She would flee first, and abandon all rather than submit to it.|$|E
60|$|The weary hours roll on. Too {{tired to}} stand longer, {{he sits down}} on the shafts of a cart, and <b>tries</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think.</b> It is <b>not</b> difficult. Body and mind are alike worn out, and his brain seems filled with uniform dull mist.|$|R
6000|$|He had awaited {{this event}} for so long, {{thought of it}} so often in such {{a great variety of}} relationships, dreamt of it, hoped for it, prayed for it, and <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of it, that now it came to him in reality it seemed to have no {{substance}} or significance whatever. He had exhausted the fact before it happened. Since first he had thought of it there had passed four long years, and in that time he had seen it from every aspect, exhausted every possibility. It had become a theoretical possibility, the basis of continually less confident, continually more unsubstantial day dreams. Constantly he had <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of it, <b>tried</b> to assure himself of Sir Isaac's invalid immortality. And here it was! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I said that," [...] he {{answered}} slowly; [...] "I was feelin' a bit low. You can't help it sometimes; it's the thing comin' on you, {{and no way}} out of it--that's what gets over you. We <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about it, as a rule." ...|$|R
60|$|Ralph {{had said}} to Isabel that he hoped she would remain at Gardencourt, and she made no {{immediate}} motion to leave the place. She said to herself that it was but common charity to stay a little with her aunt. It was fortunate she had so good a formula; otherwise {{she might have been}} greatly in want of one. Her errand was over; she had done what she had left her husband to do. She had a husband in a foreign city, counting the hours of her absence; in such a case one needed an excellent motive. He was not one of the best husbands, but that didn't alter the case. Certain obligations were involved in the very fact of marriage, and were quite independent of the quantity of enjoyment extracted from it. Isabel thought of her husband as little as might be; but now that she was at a distance, beyond its spell, she thought with a kind of spiritual shudder of Rome. There was a penetrating chill in the image, and she drew back into the deepest shade of Gardencourt. She lived from day to day, postponing, closing her eyes, <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think.</b> She knew she must decide, but she decided nothing; her coming itself had not been a decision. On that occasion she had simply started. Osmond gave no sound and now evidently would give none; he would leave it all to her. From Pansy she heard nothing, but that was very simple: her father had told her not to write.|$|E
60|$|When one is {{as young}} as Ashurst, pity is not a violent emotion. And, back in the Hallidays' sitting-room, eating a ravenous tea, he felt much like a man {{recovered}} from fever. Everything seemed new and clear; the tea, the buttered toast and jam tasted absurdly good; tobacco had never smelt so nice. And {{walking up and down}} the empty room, he stopped here and there to touch or look. He took up Stella's work-basket, fingered the cotton reels and a gaily-coloured plait of sewing silks, smelt at the little bag filled with woodroffe she kept among them. He sat down at the piano, playing tunes with one finger, thinking: 'To-night she'll play; I shall watch her while she's playing; it does me good to watch her.' He took up the book, which still lay where she had placed it beside him, and tried to read. But Megan's little, sad figure began to come back at once, and he got up and leaned in the window, listening to the thrushes in the Crescent gardens, gazing at the sea, dreamy and blue below the trees. A servant came in and cleared the tea away, and he still stood, inhaling the evening air, <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think.</b> Then he saw the Hallidays coming through the gate of the Crescent, Stella a little in front of Phil and the children, with their baskets, and instinctively he drew back. His heart, too sore and discomfited, shrank from this encounter, yet wanted its friendly solace--bore a grudge against this influence, yet craved its cool innocence, and the pleasure of watching Stella's face. From against the wall behind the piano he saw her come in and stand looking a little blank as though disappointed; then she saw him and smiled, a swift, brilliant smile which warmed yet irritated Ashurst.|$|E
5000|$|Ironic process {{theory is}} also {{the basis for the}} mind game known as [...] "The Game", which {{constitutes}} <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about the Game.|$|E
6000|$|... "Madam," [...] he said hoarsely, {{though it}} was Maud Barrington he glanced at, [...] "the comedy is over. Well, I promised you an explanation, {{and now you have}} it you will <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> too bitterly of me. I cannot ask you to forgive me." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{people were}} astir already, moving rapidly, in one direction, through the streets. Adam <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> {{where they were}} going, as they hurried past him in that short space between his lodging and the prison gates. He was thankful when the gates shut him in from seeing those eager people.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, no!" [...] protested Mrs Fyne. [...] "It is {{your former}} governess who is horrid and odious. She is a vile woman. I cannot {{tell you that}} she was mad but I think {{she must have been}} beside herself with rage and full of evil thoughts. You must <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of these abominations, my dear child." ...|$|R
5000|$|Similar ideas appear {{throughout}} {{popular culture}} and sayings, often with variations on animal and color, such as [...] "It's as hard as <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of a pink rhinoceros." ...|$|E
50|$|Emotion {{regulation}} {{refers to}} the cognitive and behavioral strategies people use to influence their own emotional experience. For example, a behavioral strategy in which one avoids a situation to avoid unwanted emotions (<b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about the situation, doing distracting activities, etc.). Depending on the particular school's general emphasis on either cognitive components of emotion, physical energy discharging, or on symbolic movement and facial expression components of emotion, different schools of psychotherapy approach the regulation of emotion differently. Cognitively oriented schools approach them via their cognitive components, such as rational emotive behavior therapy. Yet others approach emotions via symbolic movement and facial expression components (like in contemporary Gestalt therapy).|$|E
5000|$|Emelianenko {{has stated}} his driving force for winning fights was: [...] "Years ago we hardly had {{anything}} to eat. Now I earn more money and I see every opponent as a man that tries to put me back to that poorer period. That man has to be eliminated." [...] and about {{his state of mind}} before a fight: [...] "When I walk into a fight, I'm <b>trying</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about anything; collect myself and concentrate. And going into a fight, I don't feel any emotions, neither anger nor compassion. I don't emotionalize. I'm going into a fight with a clear mind... During the fight, my senses dim and basically I don't feel any pain." ...|$|E
6000|$|He <b>tried</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of that {{whizzing}} Triangle, {{that seemed}} {{now to be}} nailed like a Catherine wheel to the very centre of his forehead, {{and yet at the}} same time to be at the apex of the universe. Against that--for protection against that--he was praying. It was by a great effort that at last he pronounced the words: ...|$|R
5000|$|On June 18, Songbird {{returned}} to the track in the Summertime Oaks at Santa Anita as the 1-20 favorite. For the first time, she tracked the early pace set by Bellamentary, then moved alongside down the backstretch and gradually pulled away, winning by [...] lengths. “It scares me <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of how good she is," [...] said Smith. [...] "I <b>try</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of it." ...|$|R
5|$|His tent {{is portrayed}} as a less dark place than the {{emptiness}} outside, and becomes a place of safety and sanctuary. Conversely, the swamp is described in themes that convey it as shrouded in mist at night, and a place Nick deliberately <b>tries</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about. When he wakes in the morning, regenerated by sleep, he feels stronger and the swamp seems less threatening.|$|R
