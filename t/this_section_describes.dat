25|$|PID tuning is a {{difficult}} problem, {{even though there are}} only three parameters and in principle is simple to describe, because it must satisfy complex criteria within the limitations of PID control. There are accordingly various methods for loop tuning, and more sophisticated techniques are the subject of patents; <b>this</b> <b>section</b> <b>describes</b> some traditional manual methods for loop tuning.|$|E
25|$|Because the substituents {{attached}} to the imine nitrogen exert a profound influence on reactivity, few general catalyst systems exist for the enantioselective hydrogenation of imines and imine derivatives. However, catalyst systems have been developed that catalyze hydrogenation of particular classes of imines with high enantioselectivity and yield. <b>This</b> <b>section</b> <b>describes</b> some of these systems and is organized by the substitution pattern of the imine.|$|E

25|$|Oxidations using oxoammonium salts may {{be carried}} out either in the {{stoichiometric}} or catalytic mode under acidic or basic conditions. <b>This</b> <b>section</b> <b>describes</b> {{the most commonly used}} conditions for the stoichiometric and catalytic oxidation of alcohols to carbonyl compounds with oxoammonium salts. Although a wide variety of alcohols may be oxidized using TEMPO, competitive oxidation of more electron-rich functionality sometimes takes place.

25|$|One topic {{covered in}} <b>this</b> <b>section</b> <b>describes</b> the {{responsibility}} art therapist have to their patients (ATCB 2005). According to the ATCB, art therapists must strive {{to advance the}} wellness of their clients, respect {{the rights of the}} client, and make sure they are providing a useful service (2005). They cannot discriminate against patient whatsoever, and may never desert or neglect patients receiving therapy. Art therapist must fully explain to their patients what their expectations of the patients will be {{at the outset of the}} professional relationship between the two. Art therapists should continue therapy with a patient only if the client is benefiting from the therapy. It's against the principles established by the ATCB for art therapist to have patients only for financial reasons.|$|E
