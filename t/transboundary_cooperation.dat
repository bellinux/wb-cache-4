The National Water Resources Plan (NWRP) was completed in 2003 with a time horizon until 2017. The plan, which is not publicly available, is based on four principles: to develop additional resources, make better use of existing resources, protect {{public health and the}} environment, and improve institutional arrangements. According to the FAO the plan includes both [...] "vertical expansion" [...] through more efficient water use and increased agricultural productivity and [...] "horizontal expansion" [...] by increasing the existing agricultural area of 7.8 million feddan (about 3.12 million ha) by an additional 1.4 million feddan (about 560 000 ha). In June 2005 the Ministry presented an Integrated Water Resources Management Plan, which was prepared with technical assistance from the World Bank, as a [...] "transitional strategy including further reform interventions" [...] building on the NWRP. The Plan, which reads more like a World Bank report than a report by the Egyptian government, includes 39 actions in the fields of institutional reform and strengthening, policies and legislation, physical interventions, capacity building, technological and information systems, water quality, economic and financial framework, research, raising awareness, monitoring and evaluation and <b>transboundary</b> <b>cooperation.</b> The physical interventions mentioned include irrigation improvement and rural sanitation without mentioning the government's mega-projects that {{are at the heart of}} Egypt's actual water policy.|$|E

50|$|The {{long range}} plans for American {{development}} of the Columbia for hydroelectricity came together in the late 1930s. In 1937, the US Congress passed the Bonneville Power Act, creating the Bonneville Power Administration. This was a new federal institution meant to build transmission lines and sell the power generated by Bonneville, Grand Coulee and future Columbia Dams. While these projects substantially increased {{the ability to control}} floods and generate power, the system was unable to provide full protection or maximize the amount of power generated. American planners realized that the full potential of the river could only be harnessed through <b>transboundary</b> <b>cooperation</b> to create additional storage capacity above the existing lower Columbia complex. With the storage provided in Canada, water releases could be timed to meet power demand, rather than relying on the snowmelt-determined natural flow rates of the river.|$|E
50|$|Solutions to the {{challenges}} of water for energy and food security are hindered by shortcomings in water infrastructure, development, and management capacity {{to meet the demands of}} a rapidly growing population. This is compounded by the fact the Africa has the fastest urbanization rates in the world. Water development and management are much more complex due to the multiplicity of trans-boundary water resources (rivers, lakes and aquifers). Around 75% of sub-Saharan Africa falls within 53 international river basin catchments that traverse multiple borders. This particular constraint can also be converted into an opportunity if the potential for trans-boundary cooperation is harnessed in the development of the area’s water resources. A multi-sectoral analysis of the Zambezi River, for example, shows that riparian cooperation could lead to a 23% increase in firm energy production without any additional investments. A number of institutional and legal frameworks for <b>transboundary</b> <b>cooperation</b> exist, such as the Zambezi River Authority, the Southern African Development Community (SADC) Protocol, Volta River Authority and the Nile Basin Commission. However, additional efforts are required to further develop political will, as well as the financial capacities and institutional frameworks needed for win-win multilateral cooperative actions and optimal solutions for all riparians.|$|E
30|$|The main transboundary rivers between Northwest China and Central Asian {{countries}} are Ili River, Irtysh River, Emin River, and Aksu River. Similar to the neighboring Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, Northwest China belongs to an arid inland area of Central Asia and faces prominent conflicts between socioeconomic development and water supply–demand. Although China possesses relative geographical advantages in water resources development, transboundary rivers in Northwest China {{have been developed}} and utilized slightly in the past (Hao 2012). Therefore, no evident transboundary water problem between Northwest China and the neighboring countries has taken place. Recently, China cooperated with Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan in transboundary river utilization and protection to differing extents. Under the comprehensive development of strategic partnership between China and Kazakhstan, cooperation {{in the development of}} transboundary rivers has achieved important progress through the China-Kazakhstan Joint Commission in the field of use and protection of transboundary rivers (Joint Commission), which was established in 2003. In the past two decades, China and Kazakhstan contributed by collaborating on technical issues, negotiating the creation of and process for effective comprehensive mechanism in the use and protection of transboundary water resources. Under the joint efforts of China and Kazakhstan, ecosystems in the Ili River and the Irtysh River are healthy. These rivers are the transboundary rivers that have been protected most effectively in Central Asia. During 2003 – 2015, 12 meetings of the Joint Commission were held, following the results of which important agreements and outcomes were reached. Work has been launched on the draft Agreement on water apportioning in transboundary rivers between China and Kazakhstan, which is being developed by a special working group established in 2014.1 China and Kazakhstan have signed a series of agreements or minutes on joint use and protection of transboundary rivers {{at the level of the}} President, Minister, or expert. 2 The completion of the China-Kazakhstan Khorgos River Fellowship Diversion Pivotal Project (2013) is an important sign of comprehensive China-Kazakhstan <b>transboundary</b> river <b>cooperation.</b> China-Kazakhstan cooperation has become the model of <b>transboundary</b> river <b>cooperation</b> in Central Asia. As to China and Kyrgyzstan, with the aim of further enhancing the scale and level of economic cooperation, both sides are accelerating the negotiations on the inter-governmental <b>cooperation</b> agreement of <b>transboundary</b> river (Aksu River) utilization and protection. All of these friendly <b>transboundary</b> river <b>cooperation</b> practices have laid the foundation for further expanding water-energy cooperation in Central Asia.|$|R

40|$|Rival use {{of limited}} water {{resources}} among riparian states is often problematic and politically contentious. The hydro-politics for transboundary rivers links its riparians in complex multidimensional networks of environmental, political, economic, and security interdependencies.

Given the number of agreements, basin organizations, and joint and permanent commissions/ committees, <b>transboundary</b> water <b>cooperation</b> amongst southern Africa basin riparians is considered high. Still, a riparian state’s competing claims for limited water resources is often problematic and politically contentious because: (a) water agreements are often not about water, (b) cooperation does not equal a lack of no conflict, and (c) understanding the strategic interaction among riparian states as signatories to transboundary river agreements requires a contextual framework.

Effective transboundary water-energy resource management and cooperation are closely related with socioeconomic development and stability in the entire Central Asia. Similar to Central Asia, Northwest China has an arid climate and is experiencing a water shortage. It is now facing imbalanced supply—demand relations of water and energy resources. These issues in Northwest China and Central Asia pose severe challenges in the implementation of the Silk Road Economic Belt strategy. Based on the analysis of water and energy distribution characteristics in Central Asia as well as demand characteristics of different countries, the complexity of local transboundary water problems was explored by reviewing corresponding historical problems of involved countries, correlated energy issues, and the evolution of inter-country water-energy cooperation. With references to experiences and lessons of five countries, contradictions, opportunities, challenges and strategies for <b>transboundary</b> water-energy <b>cooperation</b> between China and Central Asia were discussed under the promotion of the Silk Road Economic Belt construction based on current cooperation conditions.|$|R

The theoretical reasoning and conceptual ambiguities of the concept of “benefit sharing ” is outlined since it is perceived advan-tageous over water sharing (i. e. negotiations of riparian states should focus on benefits from water cooperation and win-win option instead of the potentially conflicting water allocations). We present five studies from the African continent to illustrate key drivers for and constraints to the formation of transboundary water regimes: the Zambesi river where common interests pre-vailed in the first development phase; the Lesotho Highlands Water Project which established positive externalities; the Senegal river where development created a complementary interest constellation; the package deal on the Incomati river basin, and the Okavango river where coop-eration procedes despite existing asymmetric interests.

Yet, {{in more than a decade}} of existence, neither SAWI nor other international initiatives, have been able to improve transboundary water interactions between India, Nepal, Bhutan and Bangladesh. In part this is because of the sheer complexity of transboundary water governance, and in part because of contextual factors. Addressing transboundary water issues is not a priority for the riparian states; there is significant distrust between them and resentment about India’s hydro-hegemony; and bilateral, rather than multilateral, arrangements prevail. These factors make collective action both more urgent and more difficult.

40|$|Whether the {{inter-state}} and sub-national tensions over {{transboundary waters}} {{will lead to}} greater conflict or increased cooperation remains a hotly debated issue. Most work on the subject situates transboundary water conflict and <b>transboundary</b> water <b>cooperation</b> at opposing ends of a continuum. The examination of either conflict or cooperation, we argue, refutes {{the reality of the}} vast majority of contexts where cooperation and conflict actually co-exist, and perpetuates the paradigm that any conflict is ‘bad’, and that all forms of cooperation are ‘good’. The efforts of the international water academic and practitioner communities may be better served through a combined reading of conflict and <b>cooperation</b> as <b>transboundary</b> water interaction. Mirumachi’s transboundary Waters Interaction NexuS is offered as a robust method demonstrating that simultaneous consideration of conflict and cooperation is both insightful and possible. Transboundary water interaction is shown to be an inherently political process determined by the broader political context. We examine evidence suggesting that uncritical acceptance of traditional forms of ‘cooperative’ arrangements may in fact sustain the conflict it was intended to transform. Several other less well-known faces of ‘cooperation’ are discussed in detail, with examples of narrow, token and coercive cooperation derived from inter-state relations on the Jordan, Nile and Ganges rivers. With a view to paving the way for improved transboundary water sharing and governance, subjectively negative, neutral and positive forms of interaction are defined, and linked with a first approximation of their potential driving forces...|$|R

Against this background, enhanced climate variability and climate change are expected to increase the frequency and intensity of floods.

Unfortunately, numerous challenges hamper effective <b>Transboundary</b> <b>cooperation</b> in general and cooperation on Transboundary flood management in particular, thereby increasing vulnerability to floods. Flood Risk Management Strategies (FRMSs) are designed to make vulnerable urban regions more resilient to flooding. This likely requires changes in their institutional embedding.

In this paper we argue that such insights can be created by drawing upon and combining public administration and legal expertise.

40|$|Abstract — There {{are over}} 263 {{international}} river basins {{in the world}} covering {{almost half of the}} Earth’s land surface. Over 145 nations are riparians to {{one or more of these}} basins, some sharing with up to 17 countries. Challenges facing the Mekong River Basin are prompting increased focus on water conflict prevention and management and regional collaboration. Discarding the water wars myth, research and case studies have shown that greater institutional capacity can prevent water conflicts, leading to enhanced cooperation in international basins. Strategic partnerships and conflict prevention activities such as training and “hotspot ” mapping are current examples of collaborative cooperation in the Mekong Basin. Regional cooperation is driving most collaborative efforts including the emergence of civil society and stakeholder participatory processes at the basin level. Examples from the Nile and Columbia River Basins provide evidence from outside the Mekong region supporting claims that cooperative management institutions and collaborative processes are effective policies for promoting peace and <b>cooperation</b> <b>transboundary</b> and international water basins...|$|R

This paper applies game theoretic analyses to nitrate emissions in the Rhine river basin. It assumes that the 50 % emission reduction policy agreed upon by the International Rhine Committee is individually rational for each source. This enables the estimation of a revealed preference of the benefits involved. These are described by environmental damage functions. Emission reduction thus results in abatement costs, but also reduces environmental damage. The objective function is to minimise total costs, i. e. abatement costs and environmental damage. A number of different specifications for the environmental damage function are analysed {{to answer the question}} whether cooperation is individually rational for the negotiating partners in the International Rhine Committee. The analyses show that depending on the way the environmental damage function is derived, free riding is often, but not always, an interesting option. game theory; nutrients; river basin management. ...|$|R

In the El Paso del Norte region, {{the development of the}} bi-national land market has been contingent on the presence of land investors with local roots and on the concentration of urban land in a few investors. In this region, local groups become dominant and influential by accumulating land properties. On the Mexican Paso del Norte, {{there are two types of}} partisan public-private coalitions influencing the process of land development. On the US Paso del Norte, the limited vacant land to promote large urban projects in Texas has consolidated the emergence of a dominant public-private coalition in Sundland Park, New Mexico. Evidences in this dissertation show that bi-national cooperation is not attainable by the majority of local public and private actors. However, the San Geronimo - Santa Teresa case study shows that public-private cooperation among the most powerful local landholders has transcended national political boundaries to promote industrial development. Bi-national urban regimes exhibit the informal integration of various scales of governments and local urban regimes to produce simultaneous outcomes from policies implemented in two different and contiguous land markets. In the El Paso del Norte region, the economic and political inter-dependency of the Mexican and American urban contexts has created the conditions to move urban regime theory into a more global scope in explaining the processes of <b>transboundary</b> public-private <b>cooperation</b> and policy elaboration...|$|R
