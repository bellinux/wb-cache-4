25|$|The {{calculus}} for {{peak oil}} has {{changed with the}} introduction of unconventional production methods. In particular, the combination of horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing has resulted in a significant increase in production from previously uneconomic plays. Analysts expect that $150 billion will be spent on further developing North American <b>tight</b> <b>oil</b> fields in 2015. The large increase in <b>tight</b> <b>oil</b> production {{is one of the reasons}} behind the price drop in late 2014. Certain rock strata contain hydrocarbons but have low permeability and are not thick from a vertical perspective. Conventional vertical wells would be unable to economically retrieve these hydrocarbons. Horizontal drilling, extending horizontally through the strata, permits the well to access a much greater volume of the strata. Hydraulic fracturing creates greater permeability and increases hydrocarbon flow to the wellbore.|$|E

25|$|With {{the main}} {{constraint}} on Canadian oil sands development becoming {{the availability of}} export pipeline capacity, pipeline companies have proposed {{a number of major}} new transmission pipelines.

25|$|In 2012, the Canadian export {{pipeline}} system began to become overloaded with new oil production. As a result, Enbridge implemented pipeline apportionment on its southbound lines, and Kinder Morgan on its westbound line. This rationed pipeline space {{by reducing the}} monthly allocation of each shipper to {{a certain percentage of}} its requirements. The Chevron Corporation Burnaby Refinery, the last remaining oil refinery on Canada's west coast, applied to the NEB for preferential access to Canadian oil since American refineries in Washington and California were outbidding it for pipeline space, but was denied because it would violate NAFTA equal access to energy rules. Similarly, new North Dakota <b>tight</b> <b>oil</b> production began to block new Canadian production from using the Enbridge, Kinder Morgan, and TransCanada southbound systems.|$|E

It is estimated that 37.7Mt/yr of hydrogen would be sufficient to convert enough domestic coal to liquid fuels to end U.S. dependence on foreign oil importation, and less than half this figure to end dependence on Middle East oil.

Unconventional hydrocarbons in tight reservoirs show characteristics distinct {{from those of}} conventional hydrocarbon sources hosted in structural and stratigraphic traps.
