25|$|The {{process of}} cooling {{involves}} removing internal energy from a system. When no more energy can be removed, the system is at absolute zero, though this cannot be achieved experimentally. Absolute zero is the null point of the <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>scale,</b> also called absolute temperature. If it were possible to cool a system to absolute zero, all classical motion of its particles would cease {{and they would be}} at complete rest in this classical sense. Microscopically in the description of quantum mechanics, however, matter still has zero-point energy even at absolute zero, because of the uncertainty principle.|$|E
25|$|The {{temperature}} range in which creep deformation may occur differs in various materials. For example, tungsten requires a {{temperature in the}} thousands of degrees before creep deformation can occur, while ice will creep at temperatures near 0°C (32°F). As a general guideline, the effects of creep deformation generally become noticeable at approximately 35% of the melting point (as measured on a <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>scale</b> such as Kelvin or Rankine) for metals, and at 45% of melting point for ceramics. Virtually any material will creep upon approaching its melting temperature. Since the creep minimum temperature {{is related to the}} melting point, creep can be seen at relatively low temperatures for some materials. Plastics and low-melting-temperature metals, including many solders, can begin to creep at room temperature, as can be seen markedly in old lead hot-water pipes. Glacier flow is an example of creep processes in ice.|$|E

Many different thermometer designs are required to cover the entire range. These include helium vapor pressure thermometers, helium gas thermometers, standard platinum resistance thermometers (known as SPRTs, PRTs or Platinum RTDs) and monochromatic radiation thermometers.|$|R

(Measurement of temperature) [...] "Degrees Kelvin" [...] (K) is {{a former}} name for the SI unit of <b>temperature</b> on the <b>thermodynamic</b> ({{absolute}}) <b>temperature</b> <b>scale.</b> Since 1967 it has been known simply as the kelvin, with symbol K (without a degree symbol). Degree absolute (°A) is obsolete terminology, often referring specifically to the kelvin but sometimes the degree Rankine as well.|$|R
40|$|Spectral {{irradiance}} {{and radiation}} temperature measurements {{are needed in}} various applications, from environmental studies to different fields of industry. Scale realizations are needed to serve the calibration needs of these applications. In this thesis, I present various improvements to the scales of spectral irradiance and radiation temperature. A physical model was developed for tungsten halogen lamps utilized as spectral irradiance sources. The model consists of Planck's radiation law, emissivity of tungsten in polynomial form, and a correction function. The model can interpolate the spectral irradiance values of lamps with an agreement better than 1 % with previous calibrations by MIKES/TKK and NPL (UK) throughout the spectral region 340 nm - 850 nm. Spectral irradiance scales of MIKES/TKK and NMC (Singapore) were compared using an automated multi-wavelength filter radiometer. The wavelength range of the comparison was 290 nm - 900 nm. The agreement was compared {{with the results of}} the previous key comparison. The results indicated that the long-term reproducibility of the spectral irradiance scale of MIKES is excellent in the wavelength range above 400 nm. In the range 290 nm - 400 nm, the reproducibility is within 2. 8 %, which is still within the expanded uncertainties of the comparison. The spectral irradiance scale of NIMT (Thailand) was linked to the CIPM key comparison reference value using MIKES as a link in a bilateral key comparison. I present a method for uncertainty estimation in linking key comparisons. A detector-based radiation <b>temperature</b> <b>scale</b> was developed at MIKES. Filter radiometers were first compared with a Ag fixed point cell, and then with a linear pyrometer in the temperature range of 1370 K - 1770 K. With help of the filter radiometers, the extrapolation of the pyrometer readings could be studied. The radiation <b>temperature</b> <b>scales</b> of MIKES and PTB (Germany) were compared in the range 1570 K - 2770 K. Both the International <b>Temperature</b> <b>Scale</b> of 1990 (ITS- 90) and <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>scales</b> were compared. The ITS- 90 based scales were in agreement. The agreement of the <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>scales</b> was partial: The results for two out of four filter radiometers of MIKES agreed {{with each other and with}} those of PTB, whereas the results from the two others showed deviations. Possible reasons for this deviation, such as differences in measurement geometries and possible diffuse transmittance in the interference filters, are postulated and discussed...|$|R

2500|$|The Kelvin {{scale is}} an {{absolute}} <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>scale</b> using as its null point absolute zero, the temperature at which all thermal motion ceases in the classical description of thermodynamics. [...] The kelvin (symbol: K) is the base unit of temperature in the International System of Units (SI). [...] The kelvin {{is defined as the}} fraction [...] of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water (exactly 0.01°C or 32.018°F). In other words, it is defined such that the triple point of water is exactly 273.16K.|$|E
2500|$|In 1848, William Thomson, {{who later}} was made Lord Kelvin, {{wrote in his}} paper, On an Absolute Thermometric Scale, {{of the need for}} a scale whereby [...] "infinite cold" [...] (absolute zero) was the scale's null point, and which used the degree Celsius for its unit increment. Kelvin {{calculated}} that absolute zero was equivalent to −273°C on the air thermometers of the time. This absolute scale is known today as the Kelvin <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>scale.</b> Kelvin's value of [...] "−273" [...] was the negative reciprocal of 0.00366—the accepted expansion coefficient of gas per degree Celsius relative to the ice point, giving a remarkable consistency to the currently accepted value.|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} of radiation scales is critically examined. There are two radiation scales which are of fundamental validity {{and there are}} several calibration standards and radiation scales which have been set up for practical convenience. The interrelation between these scales is investigated. It is shown that within the limits of accuracy of irradiance measurements in general and solar irradiance measurements in particular, the proposed standard values of the solar constant and solar spectrum should be considered to be on radiation scales of fundamental validity; those based on absolute electrical units and on the <b>thermodynamic</b> Kelvin <b>temperature</b> <b>scale...</b>|$|R
2500|$|Many {{scientific}} measurements use the Kelvin <b>temperature</b> <b>scale</b> (unit symbol: K), {{named in}} honor of the Scottish physicist who first defined it. It is a <b>thermodynamic</b> or absolute <b>temperature</b> <b>scale.</b> Its zero point, , is defined to coincide with the coldest physically-possible temperature (called absolute zero). Its degrees are defined through thermodynamics. [...] The temperature of absolute zero occurs at [...] = [...] (or [...] ), and the freezing point of water at sea-level atmospheric pressure occurs at [...] = [...]|$|R
50|$|Thermometers may be {{described}} as empirical or absolute. Absolute thermometers are calibrated numerically by the <b>thermodynamic</b> absolute <b>temperature</b> <b>scale.</b> Empirical thermometers are not in general necessarily in exact agreement with absolute thermometers as to their numerical scale readings, but to qualify as thermometers at all they must agree with absolute thermometers and {{with each other in}} the following way: given any two bodies isolated in their separate respective thermodynamic equilibrium states, all thermometers agree as to which of the two has the higher temperature, or that the two have equal temperatures. For any two empirical thermometers, this does not require that the relation between their numerical scale readings be linear, but it does require that relation to be strictly monotonic. This is a fundamental character of temperature and thermometers.|$|R
2500|$|Absolute zero is {{the lower}} {{limit of the}} <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>scale,</b> a state at which the {{enthalpy}} and entropy of a cooled ideal gas reaches its minimum value, taken as 0. Absolute zero is {{the point at which}} the fundamental particles of nature have minimal vibrational motion, retaining only quantum mechanical, zero-point energy-induced particle motion. [...] The theoretical temperature is determined by extrapolating the ideal gas law; by international agreement, absolute zero is taken as −273.15° on the Celsius scale (International System of Units), which equates to −459.67° on the Fahrenheit scale (United States customary units or Imperial units). The corresponding Kelvin and Rankine temperature scales set their zero points at absolute zero by definition.|$|E
2500|$|One {{effect of}} {{defining}} the Celsius scale at the triple point of Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water (VSMOW, 273.16K and 0.01°C), and at absolute zero (0K and −273.15°C), {{is that neither}} the melting nor boiling point of water under one standard atmosphere (101.325kPa) remains a defining point for the Celsius scale. In 1948 when the 9th General Conference on Weights and Measures (CGPM) in Resolution 3 first considered using the triple point of water as a defining point, the triple point {{was so close to}} being 0.01°C greater than water's known melting point, it was simply defined as precisely 0.01°C. However, current measurements show that the difference between the triple and melting points of VSMOW is actually very slightly (<0.001nbsp&°C) greater than 0.01nbsp&°C. Thus, the actual melting point of ice is very slightly (less than a thousandth of a degree) below 0nbsp&°C. Also, defining water's triple point at 273.16nbsp&K precisely defined the magnitude of each 1nbsp&°C increment in terms of the absolute <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>temperature</b> <b>scale</b> (referencing absolute zero). Now decoupled from the actual boiling point of water, the value [...] "100nbsp&°C" [...] is hotter than 0nbsp&°C – in absolute terms – by a factor of precisely [...] (approximately 36.61% thermodynamically hotter). When adhering strictly to the two-point definition for calibration, the boiling point of VSMOW under one standard atmosphere of pressure is actually 373.1339nbsp&K (99.9839nbsp&°C). When calibrated to ITS-90 (a calibration standard comprising many definition points and commonly used for high-precision instrumentation), the boiling point of VSMOW is slightly less, about 99.974nbsp&°C.|$|E

50|$|Before the {{discovery}} of the true <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>temperature,</b> the thermometer defined the temperature; thermometers made with different materials would define different <b>temperature</b> <b>scales</b> (a coloured alcohol thermometer would give a slightly different reading than a mercury thermometer at, say half-scale).
