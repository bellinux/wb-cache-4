[...] Subsequently, De Fratus penned a retort to Baer via Facebook, in which he commented, [...] "I sincerely hope that you will take <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to me personally next time before you decide to hide behind your computer screen and criticize me, my upbringing and my character based on 140 characters.

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of her career, Blackwell played mostly soubrette roles and has since moved more into the lyric coloratura soprano repertoire. Blackwell has commented that she felt opera houses were initially uncertain as to how to cast her because of her musical theater background. She said, [...] "They saw me in the lighter repertoire and my voice teacher and I saw me in the lyric repertoire." [...] In addition, her small frame and 5'1" [...] stature in combination with girlish looks made her a perfect physical casting choice for soubrette roles. It wasn't until Blackwell studied in Busseto with Carlo Bergonzi, Renata Tebaldi, and Sylvia Barrachi in the late 1980s that she finally was given direction into the lyric coloratura repertoire. Blackwell recalls, [...] "At {{the end of the program}} Mrs. Barrachi and Renata Tebaldi sat down with me and told me what roles I should sing if I wanted to have a major career. Having those two women take <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to me made a big difference. I have always been the type of individual that takes all the information and then makes the decision that's appropriate for me. I can be very stubborn. I really do have to credit those two women for saving me." ...|$|E

He gave his hands over to a manicure, and did his best to talk nonsense to her. Then he came up-stairs again, changed his clothes with great care, and went into his little sitting room.|$|E

He could have groaned aloud at this miscarriage of all his fine plans. Where now would be <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> of love, to press and carry his suit with Valentina and render himself her husband? There would be war in the air, and bloody work that made his skin creep and turn cold to ponder on. And the irony of it all was keenly cruel. It was the very contingency that he had prophesied, assured that neither Guidobaldo nor Gian Maria would be so mad as to court ridicule by engaging upon it.|$|E

Peter glanced up in the tree from which Sammy had flown and there he saw a nest in a crotch halfway up. [...] "I wonder," [...] thought Peter, [...] "if Sammy was stealing eggs there, or if that is his own nest." [...] Then he started after Sammy {{as fast as he could}} go, lipperty-lipperty-lip. As he ran he happened to look back and was just in time to see Mrs. Jay slip on to the nest. Then Peter knew that he had discovered Sammy's home. He chuckled as he ran.|$|E

5000|$|The President of the Council, Nebojsa Jovic, {{said that}} 50,000 Serbs living in North Kosovo want the {{territory}} {{to become part}} of Serbia and are ready to die for the cause. He stressed that Serbs would never accept the independence proclamation by Republic of Kosovo: [...] "They cannot force us {{to be part of the}} independent Kosovo. This will never happen, There are two options. The first is that we are allowed to live inside Serbia, separated from independent Kosovo. The second is that someone expells us from here, which believe me, is hard to achieve. Deporting 50,000 people looks like a big risk,". Commenting on EU Enlargement Commissioner Stefan Fule's urging of Belgrade to improve its relation with Pristina in order to begin EU accession talk, Jovic said that Fule [...] "means absolutely nothing compared with Resolution 1244. This resolution is stronger than Stefan Fule, and it is more powerful than the German Chancellor Merkel and other statesmen." [...] He also said [...] "What's happening in the north is a private war of Prime Minister Hashim Thaci," [...] and [...] "It’s not a war between the Albanian and Serbian nation ... No one can force us love each other, The Albanians don't love us and I don’t like them, but don’t hate them either" [...] stressing that multi-ethnic institutions could not function in Kosovo. He added: [...] "It’s a fact that in the past we Serbs tried through violence and war to achieve our goals, but we failed. That was the case pre-1999 and afterwards. Now is <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> to each other. Dialogue and an agreement should be based upon reality the ground and on the readiness of both sides to compromise".|$|E
