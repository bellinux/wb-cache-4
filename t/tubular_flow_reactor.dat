40|$|A new, {{fast and}} easy method for {{analysing}} {{the potential for}} improving reactor performance by replacing steady state by forced periodic operation is presented. The method is based on Volterra series, generalized Fourier transform {{and the concept of}} higher-order frequency response functions (FRFs). The second order frequency response function, which corresponds to the dominant term of the non-periodic (DC) component, G 2 (ω, −ω), is mainly responsible for the average performance of the periodically operated processes. Based on that, in order to evaluate the potential of periodic reactor operation, it is enough to derive and analyze G 2 (ω, −ω).

Bio-ethanol, pyroligneous acid and the water-soluble pyrolysis oil (often called ‘bio crude oil’) fraction are starting materials from renewable primary products. Bio-ethanol is generated by fermentation, pyroligneous acid and bio crude oil by thermo-chemical treatment of biomass. Pyroligneous acid is a by-product from the production of charcoal and consists of about 75 % water, in which 12 % acetic acid and homologues, 2 % methanol, 1 % acetone and methyl acetate and about 10 % wood tar are dissolved.

40|$|The Chemical Reactor Design Tool (CRDT) {{is a set}} of {{computer}} programs that solves the equations describing common chemical reactor models. The types of reactors that can be modeled include batch reactors, continuous stirred tank <b>reactors,</b> plug <b>flow</b> <b>reactors,</b> plug <b>flow</b> <b>reactors</b> with axial dispersion, and <b>tubular</b> <b>flow</b> <b>reactors</b> with radial dispersion. The models used are similar to those in the common reactor design textbooks. The most general equations describing the particular reactor are used for the base model so that any complexities can be included. CRDT is composed of three main components. The first is the window driven program that prompts the user for input. This input is required by the second component, the FORTRAN code that solves the mathematical models. The third componet: It is the set of programs that use the output from the FORTRAN programs to generate graphical output. CRDT {{can be used as a}} teaching tool. At the undergraduate level, complicated reactor models often cannot be solved by the student due to the complexity of the mathematics. CRDT allows the student to study such complex models without learning all of the required numerical techniques. Also, CRDT allows the student to compare many different models in a short amount of time. The effectiveness of using CRDT as a teaching tool is demonstrated with two examples from common reactor design textbooks. CRDT is also an effective design tool. It can be used to investigate many different phenomenon. The effects of axial and radial dispersion can be easily studied by comparing results of the PFR model with the results of the PFR with axial diffusion model and the two-dimensional model. Heterogeneous effects of catalyst packing can be analyzed by choosing external resistance under the mass transfer resistance menu and providing the appropriate parameters. Heat transfer at the wall can be included for all reactor types. Pressure drop for packed or empty tubes can be modeled. Corresponding changes in velocity and density are automatically taken into account for the gas-phase. Investigating all these effects allows the user to choose an appropriate model for their reaction system. A priori criterion can be used to estimate the importance of certain effects, but the predictions are not always accurate. The use of CRDT as a design tool is demonstrated by analyzing three industrial packed-bed reactors. The results are compared to the developed criteria. ...|$|R

The initial part of the project involves the development and optimization of a small chemical production platform system capable of producing alkoxysilanes from metallurgical-grade silicon as green precursors to solar-grade silicon production. Specifically, the main aim {{of the study was to}} synthesize trialkoxysilanes in continuous flow mode, although the synthesis on monosilane was also done in batch mode. The alkoxylation reaction was carried out in a traditional slurry phase batch <b>reactor,</b> packed bed <b>flow</b> <b>tubular</b> <b>reactor</b> and also attempted in a continuous <b>flow</b> falling film <b>tubular</b> <b>reactor.</b> The effect of key parameters which affect the silicon conversion and selectivity for the desired trialkoxysilane were investigated and optimized using ethanol as a reagent model. The synthesis was then extended to the other alcohols namely methanol, n-propanol and n-butanol. Copper catalysts which were tested in the alkoxylation reaction included: CuCl, Cu(OH) 2, CuO and CuSO 4. CuCl and Cu(OH) 2 showed comparable activity in the batch mode but the former was more efficient in the packed bed <b>flow</b> <b>tubular</b> <b>reactor.</b> Cu(OH) 2 could be used as a non-halide catalyst but its activity is limited to short reaction cycles (500 oC) resulted in a lower rate of reaction and selectivity than when slightly lower temperatures are used (95 % in batch and > 97 % in flow) and conversion (about 88 % in batch and about 64 % in flow) as compared to all other alcohols studied showing that it could be the most efficient alkoxylation alcohol for this reaction. Overally, the packed bed <b>flow</b> <b>tubular</b> <b>reactor</b> resulted in higher selectivity to trialkoxysilanes than the batch system. Performing the reaction under pressure resulted in increased conversion but selectivity to the desire trialkoxysilane diminished. Synthesis in a continuous <b>flow</b> falling film <b>tubular</b> <b>reactor</b> was not successful as it resulted in very poor conversion and selectivity. Monosilane was successfully synthesized from the disproportionation of triethoxysilane using homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysts in batch mode. The results obtained from homogeneous catalysis showed that the reaction can be conducted at room temperature. The heterogeneous catalysis method resulted in slow conversion at room temperature but mild heating up to 55 oC greatly improved the reaction. Conducting the reaction under neat conditions produced comparable results to reactions which were carried out using solvents. The disproportionation reaction was best described by the first order kinetic model.
