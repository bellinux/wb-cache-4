5|$|In {{the early}} mid-2000s, Greece's economy {{was one of}} the fastest growing in the eurozone and was {{associated}} with a large structural deficit. As the world economy was hit by the financial crisis of 2007–08, Greece was hit especially hard because its main industries—shipping and tourism—were especially sensitive <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> business cycle. The government spent heavily to keep the economy functioning and the country's debt increased accordingly.|$|E

5|$|The P. rebeli {{developmental}} rate shows great {{phenotypic plasticity}} (changing its developmental rate in response <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> environment), as it develops very {{quickly in the}} lab and in the Pyrenees and Southern Alps.

5|$|The air sacs, which hold air, do not {{contribute}} much to gas exchange, despite being thin-walled, {{as they are}} poorly vascularised.

5|$|A charred {{hazelnut}} shell, {{recovered in}} 2007 during excavations in Tankerness on the Mainland has been dated to 6820–6660 BC indicating {{the presence of}} Mesolithic nomadic tribes. The earliest known permanent settlement is at Knap of Howar, a Neolithic farmstead {{on the island of}} Papa Westray, which dates from 3500 BC. The village of Skara Brae, Europe's best-preserved Neolithic settlement, {{is believed to have been}} inhabited from around 3100 BC. Other remains from that era include the Standing Stones of Stenness, the Maeshowe passage grave, the Ring of Brodgar and other standing stones. Many of the Neolithic settlements were abandoned around 2500 BC, possibly due <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> climate.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Leon–Eline in February 2000 was the third-longest tracked {{tropical}} cyclone in the South-West Indian Ocean. On February1, a tropical low originated within the monsoon trough {{to the south}} of Indonesia, and would eventually become Tropical Cyclone Leon in the Australian basin. Moving westward, the storm fluctuated in strength due <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere, mostly increasing and decreasing wind shear. After crossing 90°E, the Météo-France office in Réunion (MFR) began tracking the system as Tropical Storm Eline on February8. The storm continued across the Indian Ocean and intensified greatly as it approached the east coast of Madagascar. Late on February17, Eline made landfall near Mahanoro, with 10‑minute winds of 165km/h (105mph). The storm rapidly weakened over land, but restrengthened in the Mozambique Channel to reach peak 10‑minute winds of 185km/h (115mph). On February22, Eline made landfall about 80km (50mi) south of Beira, Mozambique near peak intensity and quickly weakened over land. The well-defined circulation moved across southern Africa, finally dissipating over eastern Namibia on February29.|$|E
5|$|During the {{courtroom}} sections, the player defends their client and cross-examines the witnesses. They can {{move back and}} forth between the statements in each testimony; if they find a contradiction between a statement and the evidence, they can point out the contradiction by presenting a relevant piece of evidence or character profile. The player can also choose to question a statement, which sometimes leads <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> testimony. A life bar, representing the judge's patience, is shown in the upper right corner of the screen. If the player presents incorrect evidence or profiles, the bar will decrease; if it reaches zero, the player loses and their client is declared guilty. The bar will also decrease if the player makes mistakes while trying to break psyche-locks; however, the player can not lose while trying to break psyche-locks. 50% of the life bar gets restored when the player manages to break a psyche-lock, and it gets fully restored when the player completes an episode.|$|E

5|$|Enzyme {{production}} (transcription and {{translation of}} enzyme genes) {{can be enhanced}} or diminished by a cell in response <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cell's environment. This form of gene regulation is called enzyme induction. For example, bacteria may become resistant to antibiotics such as penicillin because enzymes called beta-lactamases are induced that hydrolyse the crucial beta-lactam ring within the penicillin molecule. Another example comes from enzymes in the liver called cytochrome P450 oxidases, which are important in drug metabolism. Induction or inhibition of these enzymes can cause drug interactions. Enzyme levels can also be regulated by changing the rate of enzyme degradation.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} is a metric {{theory of}} gravitation. At its core are Einstein's equations, which describe {{the relation between}} the geometry of a four-dimensional, pseudo-Riemannian manifold representing spacetime, and the energy–momentum contained in that spacetime. Phenomena that in classical mechanics are ascribed to the action of the force of gravity (such as free-fall, orbital motion, and spacecraft trajectories), correspond to inertial motion within a curved geometry of spacetime in general relativity; there is no gravitational force deflecting objects from their natural, straight paths. Instead, gravity corresponds <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> properties of space and time, which in turn changes the straightest-possible paths that objects will naturally follow. The curvature is, in turn, caused by the energy–momentum of matter. Paraphrasing the relativist John Archibald Wheeler, spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.|$|E
5|$|In 1996 an {{exoplanet}} (47 UMa b) {{was announced}} in orbit around 47 Ursae Majoris by Geoffrey Marcy and R. Paul Butler. The discovery was made by observing the Doppler shift of the star's spectrum corresponding <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> star's radial velocity as the planet's gravity pulled it around. The planet was the first long-period extrasolar planet discovered. Unlike the majority of known such planets, it has a low-eccentricity orbit. The planet is at least 2.53 times the mass of Jupiter and takes 1,078 days or 2.95 years to orbit its star. If it were to {{be located in the}} Solar System, it would lie between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter.|$|E

5|$|It is {{difficult}} {{to determine the extent to}} which the events of this war contributed <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> use and legal rights of Roman slaves.

The Third Servile War was the last of the Servile Wars, and Rome did not see another slave uprising of this magnitude again.|$|E
5|$|Physiologically, the {{function}} of the brain is to exert centralized control over the other organs of the body.

This centralized control allows rapid and coordinated responses <b>to</b> <b>changes</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> environment. Some basic types of responsiveness such as reflexes can be mediated by the spinal cord or peripheral ganglia, but sophisticated purposeful control of behavior based on complex sensory input requires the information integrating capabilities of a centralized brain.|$|E
