25|$|Despite {{the popular}} {{perception}} that conservatism {{is limited to}} Republicans, during the era of segregation before 1965 many Southern Democrats were also conservative, especially about social and racial issues. Southern Democrats were {{a key part of}} a Conservative Coalition that largely blocked liberal labor legislation in Congress from 1937 to 1963, though they tended to be liberal and vote {{with the rest of the}} Democratic Party on other economic issues. Southern Democrats fended off the more conservative Republican Party (GOP) by arguing that only they could defend segregation because the Republican Party nationally was committed to integration. That argument collapsed when Congress banned segregation in 1964. This provided an opportunity for Republicans to appeal to conservative Southerners on the basis <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> was the more conservative party on a wide range of social and economic issues, as well as being hawkish on foreign policy when the antiwar forces gained strength in the Democratic party. Southern white conservatives moved from the Democratic Party to the GOP at the presidential level in the 1960s, and at the state and local level after 1990.|$|E
500|$|In {{a speech}} at the GOP Freedom Summit in April 2014, Paul insisted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> has to broaden its appeal in order to grow as a party. To do so, he said it cannot be the party of [...] "fat cats, rich people and Wall Street" [...] and that the {{conservative}} movement has never been about rich people or privilege, [...] "we are the middle class", he said. Paul also said that conservatives must present a message of justice and concern for the unemployed and be against government surveillance to attract new people to the movement, including the young, Hispanics, and blacks. During the 2014 election, Paul launched a social media campaign titled [...] "Hillary's Losers" [...] which was meant to highlight many of the Democratic candidates that lost their bids for the U.S. Senate despite endorsements from Hillary Clinton. Clinton was also a candidate for President and eventually won the Democratic Party's nomination, going on to lose to Donald Trump in the general election.|$|E

Rothenberg later would change his prediction as the economy worsened and polls reflected increasing support for Republicans through the Tea Party protests.

40|$|While the Republican Party {{is largely}} united against President Obama’s {{domestic}} policies, recent moves in Washington to intervene militarily in Syria have exposed {{the lack of}} consensus in the party on foreign policy issues. Sam Hazelgrove argues <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP’s</b> past opposition to Obama has masked {{the division of the}} party on foreign policy into hawkish hardliners and neo-isolationists. Given Republicans’ historic tendency to support interventions of this sort, {{it remains to be seen}} if this isolationist view will endure...|$|R

2500|$|From 1973 to 1974, Senator Caldwell {{was also}} the Arkansas Republican {{chairman}} during a particularly bleak period for his party. [...] In March 1973, a month after Rockefeller’s death, Caldwell was elected as chairman to succeed Charles T. Bernard of Earle in Crittenden County in eastern Arkansas. Bernard had lost the 1968 race for the U.S. Senate to incumbent Democrat J. William Fulbright in {{what turned out to}} have been Fulbright's last successful election. In this role, Caldwell opposed fielding “sacrificial lambs” Griffith was a placeholder on the ballot. Caldwell expressed doubt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> could win the governorship again for at least six years.|$|E
2500|$|The overall {{response}} to the controversies was negative, and some commentators blamed them for Republican losses during the election. Republican political consultant and policy advisor Karl Rove wrote in an opinion piece for the Wall Street Journal, [...] "Offensive comments about rape by [...] Senate candidates in Missouri and Indiana gave the media an excuse to put social issues at the election's center {{in a way that}} badly hurt the entire party, as well as costing Republicans two Senate seats." [...] The comments from otherwise low-profile candidates may have cost Mitt Romney the election and reinforced some voters' concerns <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> is out of touch with women. They also were credited with helping President Obama win the women's vote at the 2012 presidential election.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to the election, Rove voiced {{impatience with}} the notion that his own {{reputation}} is on the ballot. He told the Washington Post, [...] "I understand some will see the election as a judgment on me, {{but the fact of the}} matter is that, look what has been set in motion: a broader, deeper, strengthened Republican Party, and with an emphasis on grass-roots neighbor-to-neighbor politics, is going to continue." [...] After the election, Rove continued to express optimism, telling the Post, [...] "The Republican philosophy is alive and well and likely to reemerge in the majority in 2008." [...] Rove also told the Post <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> election strategy was working until the Mark Foley scandal put the Republican campaign [...] "back on its heels". Rove added [...] "We were on a roll, and [...] stopped it.... It revived all the stuff about Jack Abramoff and added to it." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{presidential campaigns}} were {{hampered}} by Dewey's habit of making overly vague statements, defining his strategy {{as not being}} [...] "prematurely specific" [...] on controversial issues. In 1948, President Truman poked fun at Dewey's vague campaign by joking <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> (Republican Party) actually stood for [...] "grand old platitudes." [...] Dewey's frequent refusal to discuss specific issues and proposals in his campaigns was based partly on his belief in public opinion polls; one biographer claimed that he [...] "had an almost religious belief in the revolutionary science of public-opinion sampling." [...] He was the first presidential candidate to employ his own team of pollsters, and when a worried businessman told Dewey in the 1948 presidential campaign that he was losing ground to Truman and urged him to [...] "talk specifics in his closing speeches", Dewey and his aide Paul Lockwood displayed polling data that showed Dewey still well ahead of Truman, and Dewey told the businessman [...] "when you're leading, don't talk." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{defender of}} the embattled President Nixon, Caldwell {{questioned}} whether the Watergate disclosures would have much impact on the Arkansas GOP {{because of the lack}} of political opportunities then available within the state. Caldwell called upon Republicans to continue to recruit African-American voters and Independents, something Rockefeller had pursued with considerable success in the short term. Caldwell said that many in his party were not [...] "thinking in practical terms. We’re busy debating issues that don’t elect anybody." [...] The Arkansas GOP, he said at the time, was in [...] "a serious adjustment period” since Rockefeller’s death in February 1973. In 1974, the GOP had organizations in just seventeen of the seventy-five Arkansas counties. The party supported its staff with occasional fundraising in the amount of $143,000 in 1973. The Republicans lost their best issue with the demise of the [...] "Old Guard" [...] Democrats, epitomized by former Governor Orval Faubus.

40|$|This week’s midterm {{elections}} saw the Republican Party retake the Senate and gain its largest {{majority in the}} House in over 60 years. Lori Cox Han writes <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP’s</b> success is down to President Obama’s poor approval ratings, anti-incumbency sentiment, low voter turnout, and a poor electoral map for the Democrats. She argues that despite their victory, the Republican Party will still {{have to work with}} President Obama, and moderate its Tea Party members who are likely to call for sweeping reforms. Failure to get anything done {{over the next two years}} could have ramifications for the Republican Party’s chances of holding on to the Senate in 2016, and for the party’s eventual presidential nominee...|$|R
2500|$|The Republican {{candidate}} for President in 2012, Mitt Romney, lost to incumbent President Barack Obama, {{the fifth time}} in six elections the Republican candidate received fewer votes than his Democratic counterpart. In {{the aftermath of the}} loss, some prominent Republicans spoke out against their own party; for example, 1996 Republican Presidential candidate and longtime former Senator Bob Dole said, [...] "today's GOP members are too conservative and overly partisan. They ought to put a sign on the National Committee doors that says closed for repairs". Former Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine stated as well that she was in agreement with Dole. Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs (under George H.W. Bush) and former Secretary of State (under George W. Bush) Colin Powell remarked <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> has [...] "a dark vein of intolerance {{in some parts of the}} party", commenting about the birther movement [...] "hy do senior Republican leaders tolerate this kind of discussion within the party?" [...] and [...] "I think the party has to take a look at itself." [...] The CRNC released a report in June 2013 that was highly critical of the party, being titled [...] "Grand Old Party for a Brand New Generation".|$|E
2500|$|Some critics, {{most notably}} Dan Carter, have {{alleged that the}} rapid growth in Republican {{strength}} in the South came from a secretly coded message to Wallacites and segregationists <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> was a racist anti-black party seeking their votes. Political scientists and historians {{point out that the}} timing does not fit the [...] "Southern strategy" [...] model. Nixon carried 49 states in 1972, so he operated a successful national rather than regional strategy, but the Republican Party remained quite weak at the local and state level across the entire South for decades. Matthew Lassiter argues that Nixon's appeal was not to the Wallacites or segregationists, but rather to the rapidly emerging suburban middle-class. Many had Northern antecedents and they wanted rapid economic growth and saw the need to put backlash politics to rest. Lassiter says the Southern strategy was a [...] "failure" [...] for the GOP and that the Southern base of the Republican Party [...] "always depended more on the middle-class corporate economy and on the top-down politics of racial backlash". Furthermore, [...] "realignment in the South quote came primarily from the suburban ethos of New South metropolises such as Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina, not to the exportation of the working-class racial politics of the Black Belt".|$|E
2500|$|... 1992 {{was arguably}} a [...] "realigning" [...] election. It made the Democratic Party {{dominant}} in presidential {{elections in the}} Northeast, the Great Lakes region (until 2016) and the West Coast, where many states had previously either been swing states or Republican-leaning. Clinton picked up several states that went Republican in 1988, and which have remained in the Democratic column ever since: California, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, all of Maine, Maryland, New Jersey, and Vermont. Vermont, carried by Clinton, had been heavily Republican for generations prior to the election, voting for a Democrat only once (in 1964). The state has been won by the Democratic nominee in every presidential election since. Bill Clinton narrowly defeated Bush in New Jersey (by two points), which had voted for the Republican nominee all but twice since 1948. Clinton would later win the state in 1996 by eighteen points; like Vermont, Republicans have not won the state since. California, which had previously been a Republican stronghold from 1952 to 1988, was now solidly Democratic. Clinton, a lifelong Southerner, was able to carry several states in the South <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> had been winning for decades, but ultimately won only four of eleven former Confederate states. This reflected the final shift of the South to the Republican Party. This was also the last election where Colorado voted Democratic until 2008. The election {{was the last time}} that a Democrat won the presidency without winning Florida.|$|E

5000|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, both major U.S. {{political}} parties included {{liberal and conservative}} factions. The Democratic Party had two wings: on the one hand, Northern and Western liberals, on the other generally conservative Southern whites. Difficult to classify were the northern urban Democratic [...] "political machines". The urban machines had supported New Deal economic policies, but would slowly come apart over racial issues. Some historians have divided the Republican Party into liberal Wall Street and conservative Main Street factions; others have noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP's</b> conservatives came from landlocked states (Robert Taft of Ohio and Barry Goldwater of Arizona) and the liberals tended to come from California (Earl Warren and Paul N.

Setting <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> size to 128 reduces the border effects while setting <b>the</b> <b>GOP</b> size to 64 reduces the memory requirements.

McGann, Charles Anthony Smith, Michael Latner and Alex Keena argue <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>GOP’s</b> continued control of the House is down to the gerrymandering of Congressional districts by Republican-controlled state legislatures.
