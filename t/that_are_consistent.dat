From this point there are the first finds of iron {{artifacts}} in hoards <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>consistent</b> containing other items <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>consistent</b> with Bronze Age practice. {{there is also evidence}} of smithing and smelting on some settlement sites. Iron Age society in Scotland shared many traits with Southern Britain, Ireland and in some cases continental Europe. These included roundhouses and enclosed and fortified settlements, but it also contained elements of independent development.|$|E
5|$|Since {{forces are}} {{perceived}} as pushes or pulls, this can provide an intuitive understanding for describing forces. As with other physical concepts (e.g. temperature), the intuitive understanding of forces is quantified using precise operational definitions <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>consistent</b> with direct observations and compared to a standard measurement scale. Through experimentation, it is determined that laboratory measurements of forces are fully consistent with the conceptual definition of force offered by Newtonian mechanics.|$|E

5|$|Giant impacts {{are thought}} to have been common in the early Solar System. Computer {{simulations}} of a giant impact have produced results <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>consistent</b> with the mass of the lunar core and the present angular momentum of the Earth–Moon system. These simulations also show that most of the Moon derived from the impactor, rather than the proto-Earth. More recent simulations suggest a larger fraction of the Moon derived from the original Earth mass. Studies of meteorites originating from inner Solar System bodies such as Mars and Vesta show that they have very different oxygen and tungsten isotopic compositions as compared to Earth, whereas Earth and the Moon have nearly identical isotopic compositions. The isotopic equalization of the Earth-Moon system might be explained by the post-impact mixing of the vaporized material that formed the two, although this is debated.|$|E

25|$|The Paleoindians were {{followed}} by peoples of the Archaic period from 5500 BC to 200 AD. These people were more sedentary than their the Paleoindians as evidenced by remnants of plant processing. The Archaics hunted animals and gathered plants for food. They {{were followed}} during the Formative period 200 - 1400 by the Jornada Mogollon peoples. The Jornada Mogollons were farmers that lived in villages and practiced a combination of dry-land and flood-land agriculture.

25|$|Ultimately, {{what is seen}} is not {{the black}} hole itself, but {{observations}} <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>consistent</b> only {{if there is a}} black hole present near Sgr A*. In the case of such a black hole, the observed radio and infrared energy emanates from gas and dust heated to millions of degrees while falling into the black hole. Although other possibilities exist for how these gases emanate energy, such as radiation pressure and interaction with other gas streams, interaction with a massive source of gravity is the simplest explanation. The black hole itself is thought to emit only Hawking radiation at a negligible temperature, on the order of 10−14 kelvin.|$|E

25|$|In the {{clinical}} setting, {{the function of}} the internode can only be explored by excitability studies (see Measurement). Experimental observations utilizing threshold measurements to assess excitability of myelinated nerve fibers have indicated that the function of regenerated internodes indeed remains persistently abnormal, with regenerated motor axons displaying increased rheobase and decreased chronaxie—changes <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>consistent</b> with abnormal active membrane properties. These studies have furthermore determined that activity-dependent conduction block in myelination was due to hyperpolarization, as well as abnormally increased Na+ currents and increased availability of fast K+ rectifiers. Listed below are findings on the changes in nerve excitability, and therefore the strength-duration time constant, that have been observed within several of the most pervasive nerve disorders.|$|E
25|$|The planing {{hull form}} is {{configured}} to develop positive dynamic pressure {{so that its}} draft decreases with increasing speed. The dynamic lift reduces the wetted surface and therefore also the drag. They are sometimes flat-bottomed, sometimes V-bottomed and more rarely, round-bilged. The most common form is {{to have at least}} one chine, which makes for more efficient planing and can throw spray down. Planing hulls are more efficient at higher speeds, although they still require more energy to achieve these speeds. An effective planing hull must be as light as possible with flat surfaces <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>consistent</b> with good sea keeping. Sail boats that plane must also sail efficiently in displacement mode in light winds.|$|E
25|$|A {{qualitative}} {{review of}} previous literature looking at self-report data suggests {{that men and}} women use impression management tactics in the corporate world <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>consistent</b> with stereotypical gender roles when presenting themselves to others. This research proposes that women are put in a double bind where those who portray themselves as more communal and submissive are overlooked for leadership positions and women who try to utilize male tactics (such as being more aggressive) receive negative consequences for violating normative gender roles. To change this dynamic the authors suggest that managerial positions should be re-advertised to highlight the feminine qualities needed for a position and staff training should involve a segment accentuating gender issues in the office to make everyone aware of possible discrimination.|$|E

25|$|Generally, the disseisor's openly hostile {{possession}} must be continual (although not necessarily constant) without challenge or {{permission from the}} lawful owner, but breaks in use <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>consistent</b> with how an owner would use the property will not prevent an adverse possession claim. Occasional activity on the land with long gaps in activity fail the test of continuous possession; courts have ruled that merely cutting timber at intervals, when not accompanied by other actions that demonstrate actual and continuous possession, fails to demonstrate continuous possession. If {{at any time during}} the statute of limitations period, the true owner ejects the disseisor from the land either verbally or through legal action, and the disseisor then returns and dispossesses him again, then the statute of limitations period begins anew.|$|E
25|$|In all these, {{a process}} is defined for loading the indenter, {{measuring}} the resulting indentation and calculating a hardness number. Each {{of these three}} sequences of measurement operations produces numbers <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>consistent</b> with our subjective idea of hardness. The harder the material to our informal perception, the greater the number it will achieve on our respective hardness scales. Furthermore, experimental results obtained using these measurement methods {{has shown that the}} hardness number can be used to predict the stress required to permanently deform steel, a characteristic that fits in well with our idea of resistance to permanent deformation. However, there is not always a simple relationship between the various hardness scales. Vickers and Rockwell hardness numbers exhibit qualitatively different behaviour when used to describe some materials and phenomena.|$|E
25|$|Further critiques {{have emerged}} from feminist, constructionist and discursive sources. Key to these {{is the issue of}} power. In this regard there is a concern that clients are persuaded—both inside and outside the {{consulting}} room—to understand themselves and their difficulties in ways <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>consistent</b> with therapeutic ideas. This means that alternative ideas (e.g., feminist, economic, spiritual) are sometimes implicitly undermined. Critics suggest that we idealize the situation when we think of therapy only as a helping relationship—arguing instead that it is fundamentally a political practice, in that some cultural ideas and practices are supported while others are undermined or disqualified, and that while it is seldom intended, the therapist–client relationship always participates in society's power relations and political dynamics. A noted academic who espoused this criticism was Michel Foucault.|$|E
