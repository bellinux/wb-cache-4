The velocity field, gas and floating particles holdup distributions in the vessel were first obtained, and then, the effects of operating conditions on gas dispersion and solid suspension were investigated. The simulation results show that velocity field of solid phase and gas phase are quite different in the agitated vessel. Floating particles are easy to accumulate {{in the center of the}} surface region and the increasing of superficial gas velocity is in favor of <b>floating</b> particles off-surface <b>suspension.</b> With increasing solids loading, the gas dispersion becomes worse, while relative solid holdup distribution changes little.

40|$|The Norwegian Public Roads Administration is {{currently}} investigating {{the possibility of}} crossing the 500 m deep and 5 km wide fjord, Bjørnafjorden, located in Norway. Several concepts have been developed {{on behalf of the}} Norwegian Public Roads Administration. A multi-span <b>floating</b> <b>suspension</b> bridge, with pylons resting on tension leg platforms, is considered in this thesis. A parametrized FE-model, which includes the hydrodynamic properties of the bridge, has been developed and used to obtain the standard deviations from a coupled buffeting and wave analysis, performed in modal coordinates in the frequency domain. From the modal buffeting analyses, it is discovered that the wind loading is the dominating loading with respect to the STD compared to the wave loading. It is discovered that second order wave forces could be important for high-frequency response. Load combinations with a 100 year return period are estimated by the contour surface method. The extreme short-term response and the extreme long-term response, based on the probability density function of the environmental loading, have been estimated and compared for lateral displacement at the middle of the central span. From the extreme value assessment, it is found that wind loading is the dominant contributor to the lateral displacement. Swell waves increase the extreme response by 15 %, while the contribution from wind waves are of little importance. The motion induced instability, with empirical derived aerodynamic derivatives, is found to be a combination of the second vertical mode and the first torsional mode. The corresponding critical velocity is 85. 09 m/s. In a parameter study of damage to different components of the bridge, it has been found that unsymmetrical top cable damage severely alters the vertical modes of the bridge. For the further research and development of this bridge project, it is, in particular, recommended to develop a realistic probability distribution of the environmental conditions in the Bjørnafjorden area...|$|R

For the 5 km wide Bjørnafjorden a <b>floating</b> three span <b>suspension</b> bridge with two pylons standing on tension leg platforms (TLP), is considered. A parametrized model of a <b>floating</b> multi-span TLP <b>suspension</b> bridge has been created, where the parameters have been given the planned geometry of the Bjørnafjorden bridge concept. A hydrodynamic analysis conducted on a FE-model of a pontoon where added mass, damping, restoring forces and the wave transfer function were obtained. Buffeting theory and aerodynamic derivatives were used to obtain the buffeting forces, stiffness and damping terms. A generalized method was developed to couple system matrices and forces from wind and waves in modal coordinates. Modal-, response- and motion induced instability analyses, all accounting for hydrodynamic added mass, damping and restoring forces and aerodynamic damping and stiffness, have been conducted in the frequency domain. The environmental effects resulted in significantly lower eigenfrequencies. A response analysis was carried out for combinations of different stationary parameters for wind and waves. It was evident that wind governed the response in transversal- and waves for the vertical and rotational directions for modes with higher corresponding eigenfrequenciees. The most participating modes was the first mode in transversal direction and the first mode in vertical direction, obtained from the modal analysis, frequency response spectra and standard deviations.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to study the global response of a tether anchored <b>floating</b> <b>suspension</b> bridge over Bjørnafjorden when it is subjected to ship impacts and extreme environmental loads. Bjørnafjorden south of Bergen {{is one of the}} fjords, where the ferry crossing is proposed {{to be replaced by a}} bridge. The proposed crossing has a length of over 4 000 metres and depths of over 450 metres. Due to the length and depth of this fjord it is not possible to use a conventional bridge. Instead the proposed design is to build a three span suspension bridge supported by two TLP floaters. Each of the main spans has a length of 1 380 metres, and the sailing height is 45 metres. One of the features of this design is a circular tube at the sea surface. This is connected to the floater through tethers and is thought to give stability in the installation phase and act as a barrier against ship impacts. The bridge has eigenperiods spanning from 100 to 4 seconds, making it behave dynamically for many types of loads. The geometry of the barrier was established based on simplified methods in order to find a combination minimising motions and strain energy. One of the key questions in this thesis is how this barrier influences the response of the bridge due to ship impacts. In order to establish this, several collision analyses were conducted with energies spanning from 50 to 1 200 [MJ]. With the vessels both colliding against the barrier and directly against the floater. In the analyses the ship was modelled as a nodal mass given an initial velocity. It was connected to the bridge through springs. One of these where one was given the force deformation characteristic of the vessel, while the other spring was used to ensure that the system did not have any tensile stiffness. One of the key results from these analyses was that the barrier increased the global motions, making it disadvantageous for the global response. Another key question in this thesis was to investigate the response of the bridge when subjected to extreme environmental loads. The load components used were the 100 year wind speed, and the second order drift force in the 100 year sea state. A stochastic wind model was used to account for the time and spatial variability of the wind speeds. Since both the wind and wave loads are of a stochastic nature, 30 one hour simulations were conducted. This made it possible to use extreme value statistics to find the 100 year response to environmental loads. The 90 % percentile was used to account for short term variability. These analyses showed that environmental loading yields a larger global response than ship collisions, making it governing for design against global response...|$|R

The research was focused on <b>floating</b> the kaolin <b>suspension</b> and the subsequent processes related to increasing the whiteness index. Increasing the whiteness of the kaolin raw material took place on the basis of acid leaching. The eluents were based on sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, oxalic acid and sodium bisulfite. The leaching process was influenced by the temperature and concentration of the leaching agent. Floated and leached kaolin samples were characterized by several methods. The XRD method investigated the mineralogical composition and the kaolinite structure order. The distribution of chromogenic components was monitored by SEM-EDS. Residues of organic matter was determined by COD test and the concentration of chromogenic components in the extract was monitored by the ICP-OES method.

40|$|Franco Albini, a little-theorised architect, {{is usually}} {{included}} unproblematically {{in the mainstream}} of modernist architecture. This thesis examines scarcely noticed elements in his work, endeavouring to show how they deviate from, but are also integral with, modernist principles. Albini 2 ̆ 7 s work is examined in relation to his precursor Edoardo Persico and his contemporary Alberto Sartoris. Emphasis is placed on Albini 2 ̆ 7 s prewar works. ^ The theme of lightness is developed for the period from Futurism to the 1950 s, following motifs of transparency, ascension, displacement, <b>floating,</b> and <b>suspension.</b> Albini 2 ̆ 7 s genealogies are traced through themes of lightness in earlier buildings; the impact of flight on construction and vision; in Abstraction, Metaphysical art, and Magic Realism—each drawn out from and typified by readings of a particular work. The metaphor of suspension is employed as a heuristic device to elaborate configurations as yet little considered. ^ Whereas Sartoris 2 ̆ 7 hovering axonometric images were caught between a rationalism of functionalism but also of ratio (a transcendent surpassing of material and earth), suspension in Persico and Albini was a freedom within, rather than from, materiality. ^ Suspension is as much a withholding as it is freedom and release. Both architects explored suspension literally—but also, embracing paradox and irony, metaphorically. Marginalised and suspended politically, they were confined to the ephemera of exhibition and installation design. ^ Their work, consciously or unconsciously, became an image of their condition. Temporal suspension, anticipation, surprise, suspense, and the un-actualised—connoting potentiality—materialised as frames, grids, white surfaces, and figures drawn from aeronautics. Empty space, just as real as solid bodies, became a medium of the irreducibility of potentiality to actuality. ^ Though holding to the principles of functionalism, Albini 2 ̆ 7 s ‘unreal levity’ extended to paradox as suspension of logic, irony as suspension of self, and grace as suspension of the weight of necessity in play and the oneiric. ^ Not considered major architects, Persico and Albini, nevertheless, provide through their play with suspension and potentiality rich material for a re-examination of current accounts of modernist grids, white walls, and ‘immateriality’. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{extensive}} {{literature survey}} revealed that rafting on objects floating {{at the sea}} surface is a common dispersal mechanism in marine crustaceans. A great variety of objects including detached macroalgae, plastic items and wood {{have been found to}} serve as substrata for rafting organisms. A total of 365 crustacean species from all major taxonomic groups have been reported from floating objects. Amphipods (104 species) represent the most diverse group followed by brachyuran decapods (60 species). 296 species are facultative rafters. These animals usually have a benthic or pelagic life-style and inhabit floating items as a secondary habitat. However, 23 species, mainly represented by barnacles, have been identified as obligate rafters living exclusively on floating substrata. Most rafting crustaceans reproduce sexually, primarily featuring a gonochoric sexual system with few hermaphroditic species. Fertilization mode is internal in all species. Direct development of juveniles without pelagic larvae is the major developmental mode, facilitating the retention of juveniles close to the parental animals. Mobile species able to walk or crawl dominate on natural substrata that are exposed to biological degradation. Persistent substrata, however, are often colonized by sessile animals. Feeding mode of the animals also appears to depend on substratum characteristics. Many grazing species are found on <b>floating</b> macroalgae while <b>suspension</b> feeders and predators dominate on abiotic objects and wood. The high degree of functional and morphological diversity within the Crustacea allows these animals to colonize a great variety of floating substrata making rafting an efficient dispersal mechanism for this group...|$|R

We used fatty acids as biomarkers to follow the fate of Phaeocystis-derived biomass of a Phaeocystis dominated spring bloom. The Phaeocystis bloom showed a fatty acid composition with a characteristic dominance of polyunsaturated C 18 -fatty acids, which increased in concentration with number of double bonds up to 18 : 5 (n- 3), and high concentrations of 20 : 5 (n- 3) and 22 : 6 (n- 3). In contrast to most previous studies, fatty acid analysis of the mesozooplankton community (mainly calanoid copepods) and meroplankton (Carcinus maenas megalope) demonstrated that Phaeocystis was a major component in the diet of these organisms. Massive accumulations of amorphous grey aggregates, in which Phaeocystis colonies were major components, were dominated by saturated fatty acids and only few of the polyunsaturated C 18 -fatty acids. A hydrophobic surface slick that covered the water surface during the bloom showed very similar patterns. Foam patches contained few Phaeocystis-typical fatty acids, but increased amounts of diatom-typical compounds such as 16 : 1 (n- 7) and 20 : 5 (n- 3), and 38 % fatty alcohols, indicating that wax esters dominated the lipid fraction in the foam with ca. 76 % (w/w). The fatty acid compositions of surface sediment showed that no sedimentation of fresh Phaeocystis occurred during the study.

40|$|Dynamic {{follow up}} and {{analysis}} of isolated single cells that display non-adhering behaviour is hindered {{by the fact that}} they <b>float</b> in the <b>suspension</b> medium and thus requires the implementation of systems that physically entrap the cells for successful analysis. We describe the potential of digital microfluidic (DMF) chip technology for conducting analysis of cells in suspension at the single cell resolution. More specifically, we demonstrate the use of DMF technology for the analysis of a group of single individual protoplasts from Arabidopsis thaliana plants that are labelled with magnetic particles and are immobilized on the DMF chip by magnetic forces. By transporting droplets with different osmotic conditions to the site where the cells are trapped, we challenge the cells and monitor their responses dynamically with a camera. The use of DMF technology for performing osmotic potential measurements has the following advantages: (i) solid particles such as cells and magnetic beads are manipulated on the chip without the risk of clogging channels, (ii) the static fluid conditions and low shear stress that characterize DMF are particularly suited for analysis of delicate cells types that lack cell walls such as protoplasts, (iii) the throughput of the analysis is strongly increased as multiple protoplasts are analysed simultaneously, which is much higher compared to traditional methods that can handle and challenge only one cell at a time. We show that the DMF analysis platform is effective in creating the steep osmotic gradients required for calculation of water permeability coefficients (Pos) as the values found are comparable with previously reported ones thus validating the suitability of the technology for such studies. This method illustrates DMF as an unparalleled and promising system for implementing single cells studies on non-adhering cells in an automated way. status: publishe...|$|R
