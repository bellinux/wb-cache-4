Christopher Nolan discovered Jackman {{was interested in the}} script, and after meeting him saw that Jackman possessed the qualities of stage showmanship that Nolan was looking for in the role of Angier. Nolan explained that Angier had a [...] "wonderful understanding of the interaction between a performer and a live audience", a quality he believed that Jackman had. Nolan said that Jackman [...] "has the great depth as an actor that hasn't really been explored. People haven't had the chance <b>to</b> <b>really</b> <b>see</b> what he can do as an actor, and this is a character that would let him do that." [...] Jackman based his portrayal of Angier on 1950s-era American magician Channing Pollock. Jackman also portrays Gerald Root, an alcoholic double used for Angier's New Transported Man.|$|E

In his review for IGN, contributor Colin Moriarty {{stated that the}} episode was [...] "as strong as we've come to expect in recent weeks" [...] and called it [...] "undeniably fun to watch and {{has the ability to}} get a laugh out of you even if you're in the worst of moods". Moriarty praised the chemistry that was developing between the actors, and hoped that [...] "all of the characters will get more involved <b>to</b> <b>really</b> <b>see</b> where they are all going". He hoped that the show [...] "ends on the high note it's been reaching towards rather than heading towards a decrescendo that hurts many a promising show" [...] and added that [...] "in the meantime, check out this episode for a good laugh, and wait patiently for the culmination of the first season". Overall, the installment was given a rating of 8, or [...] "great", tying it for the best rated episode of the show {{at the time of the}} review; it was rated as being equal to the preceding episode, [...] "Weekend Warriors".|$|E

50|$|One {{reason for}} the paucity of {{research}} on circannual cycles is the duration of required efforts. The ratio of the period length of a circannual cycle {{to the length of}} the productive life of a scientist makes this branch of chronobiology very difficult. It takes an entire year to get one data point which makes it difficult <b>to</b> <b>really</b> <b>see</b> how these cycles adjust in time. To put this into perspective, a two-week experiment for a circadian biologist would take fourteen years for a circannual researcher, in order to achieve the same level of data robustness for the conclusions.|$|E

The works collapse past and present, showing how the artist's memories of fraught personal experiences linger as residue in her current psychological landscape.|$|E

40|$|The {{world is}} full of color, from the blue ocean and the yellow daffodils and {{sunflowers}} in green carpeted meadows to the majestic purple mountains in the distance and brightly hued coral reefs off the edges of tropical coasts. But what is color, exactly? Why do we see things in different colors? Do we all see the same colors? Like the surface of our planet, the sky above us offers us an endless palette of color, a visual feast for the eyes. Besides atmospheric phenomena such as sunsets and rainbows, there are the many varied worlds of the Solar System, which we can spy through our telescopes, with their subtle colorings of beige and blue and green. Faraway star systems have suns that come in shades ranging from red and yellow to blue and white. Scientists even often use "false colors" to enhance the features of images they take of structures, such as the rings of Saturn and Jupiter’s clouds. This book, with its clear explanations of what makes the sky such a colorful place and in its great wealth of pictures, dazzles and delights while informing. Learn what makes the sky blue and our Sun yellow. Learn about all the quirky atmospheric events that color our world. And finally, learn how <b>to</b> <b>see,</b> <b>really</b> <b>see,</b> what’s around you and appreciate and enjoy it...|$|R

5000|$|During {{the early}} {{development}} {{and evolution of}} the style. {{one of the important}} factors that gave the dance its aesthetic was its distinct music. Created by Michael Angelo Harris, Harris would often take music of the time ranging from soul, disco, acid jazz, and more and refashion them by speeding up the RPM of the instrumental breaks of the song to create the dance own soundtrack. This distinct way of DJ ing was a covert way, of ensuring that some of the famous choreographers at the time who came to the clubs to see what they were developing were not able <b>to</b> <b>really</b> <b>see</b> what the dancers were doing. This sped up music also gave the dance its distinct jump cut rhythm, but challenged the dancers to conquer or dominate the sound, instead of the sound dominating the dancer which gave the dance its distinctive edge. Harris was noted for using his platform to not only protect the collective group of men and what they were creating purely underground and primarily gay, but also becoming one of the most innovative DJ's to emerge from Hollywoods community. After Ginos, and Ginos II, Harris would go on to host the midnight show at Peanuts [...] which included many notable performers from Hollywoods gay scene including Viktor Manoel , who was known as the androgynous [...] "Manoel" [...] , who would lip-sync and perform at the midnight show. Peanuts become one of the hottest clubs in LA throughout the 80's especially among famous performers and singers.|$|E

However, Diddy not agree with contractual obligations for the musical aspect of the series. Hakeem has the [...] "swagger of a rising superstar" [...] and is favored by Lucious to run the company. Gray found out about the audition from his manager, Charlie Mack and did a video audition for Lee Daniels. Gray then flew to Los Angeles where screen tested with Howard and Henson. Gray said it was Howard who instructed him to dig deeper during the screen test that helped him land the role. The audition was Gray's very first acting experience opposite. He later sought formal training to prepare for the role. Gray revealed that he was close to being evicted when he finally booked the role of Hakeem.
