5|$|Casares failed <b>to</b> <b>heed</b> Prieto's {{warnings}} {{of a military}} conspiracy involving several generals who disliked professional politicians and wanted to replace the government to prevent the dissolution of Spain.

Considering her son's position to be insecure, Constance fled to Austria, taking Ladislaus with her.|$|E

5|$|During {{his reign}} as emperor, Caracalla raised the annual pay {{of an average}} legionary from 2000 sesterces (500 denarii) to 2700–3000 sesterces (675–750 denarii). He lavished many {{benefits}} on the army, which he both feared and admired, {{in accordance with the}} advice given by his father on his deathbed always <b>to</b> <b>heed</b> the welfare of the soldiers and ignore everyone else. Caracalla needed to gain and keep the trust of the military, and he did so with generous pay raises and popular gestures. He spent much of his time with the soldiers, so much so that he began to imitate their dress and adopt their manners.|$|E
5|$|Taylor apprised President McKinley of the {{situation}} in Kentucky. He stopped short of asking for intervention by federal troops, and McKinley assured a delegation of Kentucky's federal legislators that such intervention would occur only as a last resort. Republican legislators made preparations <b>to</b> <b>heed</b> Taylor's call to convene in London on February 5. Meanwhile, in order to resolve any doubts about the legitimacy of their earlier meeting, Democratic legislators met at the state house—no longer being denied entrance by the state militia—and again voted to adopt the majority report declaring Goebel and Beckham the winners of the election. Both men again took the oath of office.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the late}} 1930s {{electricity}} was supplied by municipal undertakings. These were small power companies that built power stations {{dedicated to a}} single industry or group of factories, and sold any excess electricity to the public. These companies used widely differing standards of voltage and frequency. In 1925 Parliament decided that the power grid should be a single system with uniform standards and under public ownership. Several of the private power companies reacted to the proposal by forming the London Power Company. They planned <b>to</b> <b>heed</b> parliament's recommendations and build {{a small number of}} very large stations.|$|E

5|$|Although Bax won a Macfarren Scholarship for {{composition}} {{and other important}} prizes, and {{was known for his}} exceptional ability to read complex modern scores on sight, he attracted less recognition than his contemporaries Benjamin Dale and York Bowen. His keyboard technique was formidable, but he had no desire for a career as a soloist. Unlike most of his contemporaries, he had private means that made him free to pursue his musical career as he chose, without the necessity of earning an income. The Times considered that Bax's independence and disinclination <b>to</b> <b>heed</b> his teachers ultimately damaged his art, because he did not develop the discipline to express his imagination to the greatest effect.|$|E
5|$|In the {{meantime}} Leo Phokas, heavily outnumbered by the Arab army, decided to rely once more on his proven ambuscade tactics, and occupied {{a position in}} the Arabs' rear, awaiting their return. Leo had been joined by the remaining forces of the adjoining provinces, including the theme of Cappadocia under its strategos, Constantine Maleinos, and occupied the narrow pass of Kylindros on the eastern Taurus Mountains. The Byzantine troops occupied the local fort, and hid themselves along the steep sides of the pass. According to the Arab chronicler Abu'l-Fida, this was the same pass that Sayf al-Dawla had crossed to begin his expedition, and many of his commanders advised against using it for the return as well; nevertheless, the Hamdanid prince, confident of his ability and judgment, had grown haughty, and refused <b>to</b> <b>heed</b> any advice, seeking to reap the glory for this expedition alone.|$|E
5|$|Kasim becomes jealous when {{he hears}} about his brother's fortune, and wants to know the secret behind this. Under Salima's guidance, he invites Alibaba and his {{household}} for a feast. After cunningly obtaining {{the secret of the}} dacoits' cave, Kasim sentences Alibaba to death, falsely accusing him of attempted murder. Marziana pretends <b>to</b> <b>heed</b> Kasim's order. She declares that Alibaba has been unfaithful to her and he deserves this retribution. Taking a knife, Marziana acts as though she means to kill Alibaba, but instead cuts the ropes that bind his hands. A fight ensues between Alibaba and Kasim's thugs (during which Salima is accidentally killed), but Alibaba subdues them and escapes with his allies.|$|E

5|$|On 24 August, the Kennedy {{administration}} sent Cable 243 to Lodge at {{the embassy}} in Saigon, marking a change in American policy. The message advised Lodge to seek {{the removal of the}} Nhus from power, and to look for alternative leadership options if Diệm refused <b>to</b> <b>heed</b> American pressure for reform. As the probability of Diệm sidelining the Nhus was seen as virtually nil, the message effectively meant the fomenting of a coup. The Voice of America broadcast a statement blaming Nhu for the raids and absolving the army of responsibility. Aware that the Americans would neither oppose a coup nor respond with aid cuts or sanctions, the generals deposed the Ngô brothers, who were arrested and assassinated the next day, 2 November 1963.|$|E
5|$|Throughout 28 January, the Coalition {{received}} {{a number of}} warnings suggesting an impending Iraqi offensive. The Coalition was flying two brand-new E-8A Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (Joint STARS) aircraft, which picked up the deployment and movement of Iraqi forces to the area opposite of Khafji. Observation posts 2, 7 and 8 also detected heavy Iraqi reconnoitering along the border, and their small teams of air-naval gunfire liaison Marines called in air and artillery strikes throughout the day. Lieutenant Colonel Richard Barry, commander of the forward headquarters of the 1st Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Intelligence Group, sent warnings about an impending attack to Central Command. CentCom leaders were too preoccupied with the air campaign <b>to</b> <b>heed</b> them however, and so the Iraqi operation came as a surprise.|$|E
5|$|A {{little over}} {{an hour after the}} committee's meeting, Governor Taylor {{declared}} a state of insurrection and called out the state militia. He called the legislature into special session, not in Frankfort, but in heavily Republican London, which he insisted was a safer location. Defiant Democratic legislators refused <b>to</b> <b>heed</b> the call to London, but when they attempted to convene first in the state capitol and later in other public locations in Frankfort, they found the doors barred by armed citizens. On January 31, 1900, they convened secretly in a Frankfort hotel, with no Republicans present, and voted to certify the findings of the contest committee, invalidating enough votes to make Goebel governor. Goebel was sworn in, and immediately ordered the state militia to stand down. He also ordered the General Assembly to reconvene in Frankfort. The Republican militia refused to disband, and a rival Democratic militia formed across the lawn of the state capitol. Civil war seemed possible.|$|E

5|$|As {{the women}} {{go back to}} the factory, Micaëla returns and gives José a letter and a kiss from his mother ("Parle-moi de ma mère!"). He reads that his mother wants him to return home and marry Micaëla, who retreats in shy embarrassment on {{learning}} this. Just as José declares that he is ready <b>to</b> <b>heed</b> his mother's wishes, the women stream from the factory in great agitation. Zuniga, the officer of the guard, learns that Carmen has attacked a woman with a knife. When challenged, Carmen answers with mocking defiance ("Tra la la... Coupe-moi, brûle-moi"); Zuniga orders José to tie her hands while he prepares the prison warrant. Left alone with José, Carmen beguiles him with a seguidilla, in which she sings of a night of dancing and passion with her lover—whoever that may be—in Lillas Pastia's tavern. Confused yet mesmerised, José agrees to free her hands; as she is led away she pushes her escort to the ground and runs off laughing. José is arrested for dereliction of duty.|$|E
5|$|By October28, Isabela, {{southern}} Cagayan, Quirino, {{and northern}} Aurora provinces were placed under Public Storm Warning Signal (PSWS) #3, the second-highest level. More than 20provinces overall were placed under varying PSWS levels. Residents living {{along the coast}} were urged to evacuate. Early on October29, several provinces along Luzon's east coast were placed under PSWS #4, {{the highest level of}} alert. During a national radio broadcast President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo urged residents <b>to</b> <b>heed</b> warnings and not to venture out during the storm. Throughout Luzon, schools and government offices were closed on October29 while residents in mountainous areas were urged to evacuate due to threat of mudslides. The National Transmission Corporation deployed power restoration crews across the region to allow for quick post-storm response. Hospitals in Cimaron's projected path requested employees to be present in anticipation of an influx of patients. Quick response teams from the Department of Social Welfare and Development were placed on standby for possible deployment. Within evacuation areas, the Philippine National Police was dispatched to prevent people from returning to these areas. Bus companies suspended all services north of Tarlac City and San Jose.|$|E

The imperial commander-in-chief, the eunuch praipositos Constantine, a militarily inexperienced court favourite of Emperor Constantine IX (r. 1042–55), listened to his advice on fortifying the army's encampment, but when the Pechenegs appeared before Adrianople, he refused <b>to</b> <b>heed</b> the opinion of the magistros Constantine Arianites to wait and attack the Pechenegs on their return journey, and instead marched to meet them in the open field of Basilike Libas, resulting in a devastating defeat: Arianites fell, while Dokeianos was taken prisoner. As he was brought before the Pecheneg leader, however, Dokeianos seized a sword from one of his guards and slashed at the leader, cutting off one of his arms, whereupon the enraged Pechenegs killed him and, according to Michael Attaleiates, opened his belly, cut off his arms and legs and placed them in it.|$|E

5|$|No {{attempt to}} arrest Blackburn was made, and he {{returned}} to Kentucky {{with his family in}} early 1873. The family lived in Louisville's Galt House hotel, and Blackburn resumed his medical practice in that city. During a cholera epidemic in 1873, Blackburn rightly theorized that the disease was spread by the consumption of contaminated water, but most citizens accepted the competing theory that cholera was a miasmatic disease. This theory was espoused by Thomas S. Bell, a better-known physician in Louisville. Thousands {{died as a result of}} failing <b>to</b> <b>heed</b> Blackburn's advice to boil potentially contaminated water before drinking it. Blackburn's philanthropic work included treating victims of yellow fever outbreaks in Memphis, Tennessee, in 1873 and Fernandina, Florida, in 1877. He refused to accept compensation for his services in either city, but was presented with gifts from appreciative residents in both cases. Several southern newspapers also carried glowing accounts of Blackburn's service.|$|E

With no plutonium, Doc explains that the only power source capable of generating the necessary 1.21 gigawatts of electricity for the time machine is a bolt of lightning. Marty shows Doc a flyer from the future that recounts a lightning strike at the town's courthouse the coming Saturday night. Doc instructs Marty to not leave his house or interact with anyone, as he could inadvertently {{change the course of}} history and alter the future; because of this, Doc refuses <b>to</b> <b>heed</b> warnings from Marty about his death in 1985. Marty realizes that he has prevented his parents from meeting and Doc warns Marty that he will be erased from existence if he does not find a way to introduce George to Lorraine. Doc formulates a plan to harness the power of the lightning while Marty sets about introducing his parents, but he antagonizes Biff and his gang in the process.|$|E
