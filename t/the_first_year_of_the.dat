5|$|The {{governor}} has a four-year term, commencing {{on the first}} Monday of the January after an election. The Constitution of Utah originally stated that, should the office of governor be vacant, the power be devolved upon the Secretary of State, but the office of Lieutenant Governor was created in 1976, and a 1980 constitutional amendment added it to the constitution. If the office of governor becomes vacant during <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> term, the lieutenant governor becomes governor until the next general election; if it becomes vacant after <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>year</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> term, the lieutenant governor becomes governor {{for the remainder of}} the term. The offices of governor and lieutenant governor are elected on the same ticket. The Governor of Utah was formerly limited to serving three terms, but all term limit laws were repealed by the Utah Legislature in 2003; Utah is one of the few states where gubernatorial term limits are not determined by the constitution.|$|E
