40|$|Three {{case studies}} of {{successful}} use of educational <b>technology</b> <b>are</b> presented. In each, students' usage of the <b>technology</b> <b>was</b> not what had been expected by the course designers. Theoretical ideas from the sociology of <b>technology</b> <b>are</b> used to illuminate the disparity between expectation and reality. The paper concludes that students' use of educational <b>technology</b> <b>is</b> not wholly predictable from the technology itself; and {{that the notion of}} an 'affordance' in relation to educational <b>technology</b> <b>is</b> not straightforward...|$|R

5|$|First-generation <b>technologies</b> <b>are</b> {{widely used}} in {{locations}} with abundant resources.

5|$|The {{two main}} <b>technologies</b> <b>are</b> stamped or rammed earth, clay or loam, called pise de terre in French, and adobe, {{typically}} using sun-dried bricks {{made of a}} mud and straw mixture.|$|E
5|$|By {{complexity}} of technology: In situ <b>technologies</b> <b>are</b> usually classified either as true in situ processes or modified in situ processes. True in situ processes {{do not involve}} mining or crushing the oil shale. Modified in situ processes involve drilling and fracturing the target oil shale deposit to create voids in the deposit. The voids enable a better flow of gases and fluids through the deposit, thereby increasing the volume {{and quality of the}} shale oil produced.|$|E
30|$|The {{simplicity}} {{dimension of}} the <b>technologies</b> <b>is</b> referred as {{the degree to which}} a <b>technology</b> <b>is</b> easy to understand, operate and use, whereas, complexity refers to {{the degree to which a}} <b>technology</b> <b>is</b> difficult to use and understand.|$|R

50|$|The {{origins of}} {{wearable}} <b>technology</b> <b>are</b> influenced by {{both of these}} responses to the vision of ubiquitous computing.

5|$|It is an {{important}} source of renewable energy and its <b>technologies</b> <b>are</b> broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on how they capture and distribute solar energy or convert it into solar power. Active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic systems, concentrated solar power and solar water heating to harness the energy. Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable thermal mass or light-dispersing properties, and designing spaces that naturally circulate air.|$|E
5|$|Solar <b>technologies</b> <b>are</b> {{characterized}} as either passive or active {{depending on the}} way they capture, convert and distribute sunlight and enable solar energy to be harnessed at different levels around the world, mostly depending on distance from the equator. Although solar energy refers primarily {{to the use of}} solar radiation for practical ends, all renewable energies, other than Geothermal power and Tidal power, derive their energy either directly or indirectly from the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Technology is {{researched}} {{at specific}} buildings, {{to which they}} are generally related; for example, religious research is done in temples and improved armor is researched in the storage pit. Technological advances come in many categories, such as military upgrades (better arms and armor for units), economic upgrades (increasing the efficiency of resource gathering), religious upgrades (faster conversion rates and more abilities for priests) and infrastructure upgrades (stronger fortifications and more resilient buildings). As basic technology research is completed, more advanced technologies may become available. Some <b>technologies</b> <b>are</b> not available to certain civilizations.|$|E

5|$|The Clean Tech Revolution: The Next Big Growth and Investment Opportunity is a 2007 book by Ron Pernick and Clint Wilder, who {{say that}} commercializing clean {{technologies}} is a profitable enterprise that is moving steadily into mainstream business. As the world economy faces challenges from energy price spikes, resource shortages, global environmental problems, and security threats, clean <b>technologies</b> <b>are</b> seen {{to be the next}} engine of economic growth.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} economic building is the Town Center, where villagers are created, {{all types of}} resources can be stored, some <b>technologies</b> <b>are</b> researched, and the player can advance to the next Age. The Town Center can fire arrows at enemy units within range if villagers or archers are garrisoned while under attack. Other economic buildings available include storage buildings for resources, farms, docks (the dock may also produce several military ships), and houses to support a higher population.|$|E
5|$|Thermal {{power plants}} which use oil shale as a fuel mostly employ {{two types of}} {{combustion}} methods. The traditional method is Pulverized combustion (PC) which {{is used in the}} older units of oil shale-fired power plants in Estonia, while the more advanced method is Fluidized bed combustion (FBC), which is used in the Holcim cement factory in Dotternhausen, Germany, and was used in the Mishor Rotem power plant in Israel. The main FBC <b>technologies</b> <b>are</b> Bubbling fluidized bed combustion (BFBC) and Circulating fluidized bed combustion (CFBC).|$|E
50|$|According to Green, <b>technology</b> <b>is</b> always {{developed}} {{with a particular}} purpose or objective in mind.

5|$|Imaging is {{indicated}} {{when there are}} red flags, ongoing neurological symptoms that do not resolve, or ongoing or worsening pain. In particular, early use of imaging (either MRI or CT) is recommended for suspected cancer, infection, or cauda equina syndrome. MRI is slightly better than CT for identifying disc disease; the two <b>technologies</b> <b>are</b> equally useful for diagnosing spinal stenosis. Only a few physical diagnostic tests are helpful. The straight leg raise test is almost always positive in those with disc herniation. Lumbar provocative discography {{may be useful to}} identify a specific disc causing pain in those with chronic high levels of low back pain. Similarly, therapeutic procedures such as nerve blocks can be used to determine a specific source of pain. Some evidence supports the use of facet joint injections, transforminal epidural injections and sacroilliac injections as diagnostic tests. Most other physical tests, such as evaluating for scoliosis, muscle weakness or wasting, and impaired reflexes, are of little use.|$|E
25|$|Other {{renewable}} energy <b>technologies</b> <b>are</b> still under development, and include cellulosic ethanol, hot-dry-rock geothermal power, and marine energy. These <b>technologies</b> <b>are</b> not yet widely demonstrated or have limited commercialization.

25|$|Small-diameter coil <b>technologies</b> <b>are</b> {{becoming}} more popular in modern {{air conditioning and}} refrigeration systems because they have better rates of heat transfer than conventional sized condenser and evaporator coils with round copper tubes and aluminum or copper fin {{that have been the}} standard in the HVAC industry.

Two small diameter coil <b>technologies</b> <b>are</b> currently available for air conditioning and refrigeration products: copper microgroove and brazed aluminum microchannel.|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} problem concerning <b>technology</b> assessment <b>is</b> {{the so-called}} Collingridge dilemma: {{on the one}} hand, impacts of new <b>technologies</b> cannot <b>be</b> easily predicted until the <b>technology</b> <b>is</b> extensively developed and widely used; on the other hand, control or change of a <b>technology</b> <b>is</b> difficult {{as soon as it}} is widely used.|$|R
