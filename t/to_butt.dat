25|$|England {{announced}} an unchanged team but, {{in the run-up}} to the match, the two Lancashire players Pullar and Statham were injured and had to withdraw. Their replacements were opening batsman Micky Stewart and fast-medium bowler Len Coldwell, who both earned their first Test cap. Pakistan brought Farooq into the team this time, replacing Intikhab, and preferred the veteran batsman Alim-ud-Din as opener <b>to</b> <b>Butt.</b> As in the first Test, Dexter and Burki were the team captains.|$|E
50|$|Excluding the {{approach}} <b>to</b> <b>Butts</b> Junction, {{the line was}} entirely single track. Only Herriard station was provided with two platforms. As a light railway, the line had an overall speed limit of 25 miles per hour, and the journey from Basingstoke <b>to</b> <b>Butts</b> Junction took typically 45 minutes. When it opened, there were three return trips to Alton daily, which rose to six {{by the summer of}} 1909, with an extra couple of goods trains.|$|R

25|$|The bending curve isn't easily {{described}} by terms. However, some rod & blank manufacturers try to simplify things towards their customers by describing the bending curve by associating {{them with their}} action. The term fast action is used for rods where only the tip is bending, and slow action for rods bending from tip <b>to</b> <b>butt.</b> In practice, this is misleading, as top-quality rods are very often fast-action rods, bending from tip <b>to</b> <b>butt.</b> While the so-called 'fast-action' rods are stiff rods (with absence of any action) which end in a soft or slow tip section. The construction of a progressive bending, fast action rod is more difficult and more expensive to achieve. Common terms to describe the bending curve or properties which influence the bending curve are: progressive taper/loading/curve/bending/..., fast taper, heavy progressive (notes a bending curve close to progressive, tending to become fast-tapered), tip action (also referred to as 'umbrella'-action), broom-action (which refers to the previously mentioned stiff 'fast action'-rods with soft tip). A parabolic action {{is often used to}} note a progressive bending curve, in fact this term comes from a series of splitcane fly rods built by Pezon & Michel in France since the late 1930s, which had a progressive bending curve. Sometimes the term parabolic is more specific used to note the specific type of progressive bending curve as was found in the Parabolic series.|$|E
25|$|Some rods {{are joined}} through a metal bus. These add mass to the rod which helps {{in setting the}} hook and help {{activating}} the rod from tip <b>to</b> <b>butt</b> when casting, resulting in a better casting experience. Some anglers experience this kind of fitting as superior to a one piece rod. They are found on specialised hand-built rods. Apart from adding the correct mass, depending {{on the kind of}} rod, this fitting also is the strongest known fitting, but also the most expensive one. For that reason they are almost never to be found on commercial fishing rods.|$|E
25|$|Pachycephalosaurs, {{with their}} {{dome-shaped}} heads, are commonly {{thought to have}} used their thick skulls for butting into each other. Their brains and vertebrae are positioned in ways to protect from the impact of head-butting. Also, the columnar structure found in bone remains is consistent with models used to recreate the practice of head-butting. However, some pachycephalosaurs such at Stygimoloch have vascularization in the skull cap {{that would not have}} supported head-butting behavior. Thus, the heads could have been used as ornamentation or <b>to</b> <b>butt</b> into the softer flank of other pachycephalosaurs for intraspecific communication or as a form of agonistic behavior.|$|E

25|$|Plans for {{erecting}} {{a memorial}} <b>to</b> <b>Butt</b> and Millet began {{shortly after the}} introduction of the Senate resolution. Taft agreed to chair the memorial committee. Taft's personal secretary, Charles D. Hilles, and his military aide, Colonel Spencer Cosby, led the fund-raising on behalf of the committee. Charles J. Bell of the American Security and Trust Company was the treasurer. Members of the foreign diplomatic corps and several high government officials had already donated several thousand dollars to the memorial fund by mid-May. Taft himself had made the first contribution. At this point in time, The Ellipse (the southern part of President's Park) was chosen for the site of the memorial. However, the memorial committee was thinking only of erecting a bronze tablet.|$|E
25|$|A rod can bend in {{different}} curves. Traditionally the bending curve is mainly determined by its tapering. In simplified terms, a fast taper will bend {{a lot more}} in the tip area and not much in the butt part, and a slow taper will tend to bend too much at the butt and delivers a weak rod. A progressive tapering which loads smooth from top <b>to</b> <b>butt,</b> adding in power the deeper the rod is bent. In practice, the tapers of quality rods often are curved or in steps to achieve the right action and bending curve for the type of fishing a rod is built. In today's practice, different fibres with different properties {{can be used in a}} single rod. In this practice, there is no straight relationship anymore between the actual tapering and the bending curve.|$|E

500|$|Revolution Software's {{point and}} click {{adventure}} game [...] was first released in 1996. While investigating a murder, protagonist and player character George Stobbart finds himself uncovering a dark mystery regarding the Knights Templar. A medieval manuscript which he obtained {{during the investigation}} leads him to a castle located in Lochmarne, Ireland. As he cannot enter the castle through the main entrance door, he climbs a haystack, which stops short {{of the top of}} the wall. He puts a sewer key which he obtained {{at the beginning of the}} game in a crack in the wall, which forms a step, allowing him to climb over the wall. Inside the castle, an entrance to an underground dig is located. A tied-up goat is sitting near the entrance; however, the rope to which it is tied is long enough to allow it to prevent George from reaching the entrance by butting him. An old piece of farming machinery is located at the left side of the screen, but George is unable to interact with it, as the goat continues <b>to</b> <b>butt</b> him. George must allow the goat <b>to</b> <b>butt</b> him when trying to reach the entrance, but while the goat is returning to its original position, the player must click on the farming machinery, which causes George to quickly jump up and run to the machinery and slightly reposition it. When returned to its original position, the goat again charges and butts George, but while doing so, gets its rope entangled with the machinery, due to its repositioning. This allows George to move freely and enter the dig.|$|E
500|$|Apart from Lana, Clark had {{a growing}} {{relationship}} with Lois. Season five saw the melting {{of the ice}} between the two characters, who continued <b>to</b> <b>butt</b> heads. Executive producer Darren Swimmer believed that the audience could finally start to see a growing attraction between the two, {{and the fact that}} both would be there for the other in a time of need. Erica Durance believed that Lois in season five, because of her self-imposed walls, laughed off any notion that she had a romantic interest in Clark, even if that notion was true. In season six, Durance described the relationship between Lois and Clark as something neither character wanted to put an official label on. Instead, Durance believed that, by that point in the series, Clark and Lois were satisfied with identifying with a [...] "brother and sister friendship" [...] label, rather than trying to discover how each truly feels. By season eight, Durance noted that Lois was starting to accept the idea that she may be in love with Clark more than she had been with anyone else in her life. His relationship with Lois was included in TV Guides list of the best TV couples of all time.|$|E
500|$|Philip thus {{brought an}} army into Thessaly, {{probably}} {{with the intention}} of attacking Pherae. Under the terms of their alliance, Lycophron of Pherae requested aid from the Phocians, and Onomarchus dispatched his brother, Phayllos with 7000 men; however, Philip repulsed this force before it could join up with the Pheraeans. Onomarchus then abandoned the siege he was currently prosecuting, and brought his whole force into Thessaly to attack Philip. It is possible that Onomarchus hoped to conquer Thessaly in the process, which would both leave the Thebans isolated (Locris and Doris having already fallen to the Phocians), and give the Phocians a majority in the Amphictyonic council, thus enabling them to have the war declared over. Onomarchus probably brought with him 20,000 infantry, 500 cavalry, and a large number of catapults, and outnumbered Philip's army. The exact details of the campaign that followed are unclear, but Onomarchus seems to have inflicted two defeats on Philip, with many Macedonians killed in the process. Polyaenus suggests that the first of Onomarchus' victories was aided by the use of the catapults to throw stones into the Macedonian phalanx, as they climbed a slope to attack the Phocians. After these defeats, Philip retreated to Macedon for the winter. He is said to have commented that he [...] "did not run away but, like a ram, I pulled back <b>to</b> <b>butt</b> again harder".|$|E

Due <b>to</b> <b>Butt's</b> alleged involvement with drugs and affairs, Tara thinks the motive behind faking death is either the drugs or another woman.

500|$|Series writer Brian Peterson {{discusses}} how {{the writing}} staff chose {{to develop the}} character: [...] "In the Smallville pilot, Al and Miles established Lex and Clark as best friends, which is, to me, {{one of the best}} aspects of the show. So when you're introducing his future love interest, why not introduce her, not as an enemy, but as the one who is constantly going <b>to</b> <b>butt</b> heads with him, where they're not gonna like each other at all at first? I think that because we chose such a different take on her, it wasn't that intimidating. She could grow into the person that everybody sees on-screen later." [...] For season six, the writers chose to start Lois down the path of investigative journalism, only in this version of the character she gets her start working for a tabloid newspaper. Writer Kelly Souders felt that if tabloid beginnings were good enough for Perry White—an additional character established in season three's [...] "Perry"—then they are good enough for Lois Lane. It adds depth to the character by showing how she struggled before becoming [...] "the reporter we all know and love". As Lois steps closer to her ultimate destiny at the Daily Planet, the writers have continued to evolve the character by having her grow out of the [...] "black and white" [...] mindset and have her begin seeing shades of gray. The writers wanted the character to realize that there is sometimes a middle road that has to be taken. In season eight, Durance sees Clark taking a job at the Daily Planet as a chance for her character to [...] "step it up and be more involved". In this case, Lois is acting more mature, taking charge in being a mentor to Clark as he transitions into his new job. Durance describes the eighth season as a lesson in duality, with Clark realizing that he has to be two different people if he wants to have a life and save the day; Durance believes that the same applies to Lois. As Durance explains, [...] " [...] got her confidence as a journalist and on the inside, she's going oh my god I'm truly in love with , more in love than I've ever been with anyone." ...|$|E
