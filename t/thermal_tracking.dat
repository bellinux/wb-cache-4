40|$|Due to {{increasing}} integration density and operating frequency of today's high performance processors, {{the temperature of}} a typical chip can easily exceed 100 degrees Celsius. However, the runtime thermal state of a chip {{is very hard to}} predict and manage due to the random nature in computing workloads, as well as the process, voltage and ambient temperature variability (together called PVT variability). The uneven nature (both in time and space) of the heat dissipation of the chip could lead to severe reliability issues and error-prone chip behavior (e. g. timing errors). Many dynamic power/thermal management techniques have been proposed to address this issue such as dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS), clock gating and etc. However, most of such techniques require accurate knowledge of the runtime thermal state of the chip to make efficient and effective control decisions. In this work we address the problem of tracking and managing the temperature of microprocessors which include the following sub-problems: (1) how to design an efficient sensor-based <b>thermal</b> <b>tracking</b> system on a given design that could provide accurate real-time temperature feedback; (2) what statistical techniques could be used to estimate the full-chip thermal profile based on very limited (and possibly noise-corrupted) sensor observations; (3) how do we adapt to changes in the underlying system's behavior, since such changes could impact the accuracy of our thermal estimation. The <b>thermal</b> <b>tracking</b> methodology proposed in this work is enabled by on-chip sensors which are already implemented in many modern processors. We first investigate the underlying relationship between heat distribution and power consumption, then we introduce an accurate thermal model for the chip system. Based on this model, we characterize the temperature correlation that exists among different chip modules and explore statistical approaches (such as those based on Kalman filter) that could utilize such correlation to estimate the accurate chip-level thermal profiles in real time. Such estimation is performed based on limited sensor information because sensors are usually resource constrained and noise-corrupted. We also took a further step to extend the standard Kalman filter approach to account for (1) nonlinear effects such as leakage-temperature interdependency and (2) varying statistical characteristics in the underlying system model. The proposed <b>thermal</b> <b>tracking</b> infrastructure and estimation algorithms could consistently generate accurate thermal estimates even when the system is switching among workloads that have very distinct characteristics. Through experiments, our approaches have demonstrated promising results with much higher accuracy compared to existing approaches. Such results can be used to ensure thermal reliability and improve the effectiveness of dynamic thermal management techniques...|$|E

40|$|Quality {{of product}} is an {{important}} aspect in many commercial organizations where storage and shipment practices are required. Temperature {{is one of the}} main parameters that influence quality and temperature treatments of agricultural products therefore require special attention. The temperature variation in a meat chiller has a significant effect on tenderness, color and microbial status of the meat, therefore thermal mapping during the chilling process and during chilled shipment to overseas markets is vital. The literature indicates that deviations of only a few degrees can lead to significant product deterioration. There are several existing methods for thermal mapping: these includes Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD), Finite Element Methods (FEM) for examination of the environmental variables in the chiller. These methodologies can work effectively in non real-time. However these methods are quite complex and need high computational overhead when it comes to hard real-time analysis within the context of the process dynamics. The focus of this research work is to develop a method and system towards building an object-centric environment monitoring using collaborative efforts of both wireless sensor networks and artificial neural networks for spatial thermal mapping. <b>Thermal</b> <b>tracking</b> of an object placed anywhere within a predefined space {{is one of the main}} objectives here. Sensing data is gathered from restricted sensing points and used for training the Neural Network on the spatial distribution of the temperature at a given time. The solution is based on the development of a generic module that could be used as a basic building block for larger spaces. The Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) perform dynamic learning using the data it collects from the various sensing points within the specific subspace module. The ANN could then be used to facilitate mapping of any other point in the related sub-space. The distribution of the sensors (nodes placement strategy for better coverage) is used as a parameter for evaluating the ability to predict the temperature at any point within the space. This research work exploits the neuro Wireless Sensor Network (nWSN) architecture in steady-state and transient environments. A conceptual model has been designed and built in a simulation environment and also experiments conducted using a test-bed. A Shepard’s algorithm with modified Euclidian distance is used for comparison with an adaptive neural network solution. An algorithm is developed to divide the overall space into subspaces covered by clusters of neighbouring sensing nodes to identify the thermal profiles. Using this approach, a buffering and Query based nWSN Data Processing (QnDP) algorithm is proposed to fulfil the data synchronization. A case study on the meat plants cool storage has been undertaken to demonstrate the best layout and location identification of the sensing nodes that can be attached to the carcasses to record thermal behavior. This research work assessed the viability of using nWSN architecture. It found that the Mean Absolute Error (MAE) at the infrastructural nodes has a variation of less than 0. 5 C. The resulting MAE is effective when nWSN can be capable of generating similar applications of predictions...|$|E

40|$|Because thermal {{expansions}} are constrained within continuous {{welded rail}} track, the track can buckle, and does so mainly in the horizontal plane. In this paper, a parametric finite element model of railway track is presented, and its sensitivity to the variations of the main parameters that characterise the scenario has been investigated and discussed. Comparison with existing literature shows good agreement. It is found that curved <b>tracks</b> suffer from <b>thermal</b> buckling more than tangent tracks do. To simulate a track misalignment defect, a new methodology has been utilised that does not introduce, as is usual, geometrical discontinuities near the same defect, because it takes into account – in a natural way – the bending stiffness of the whole railway track in the horizontal plane. To contribute {{to a better understanding}} of the safe utilisation of raw experimental data obtained from in situ tests, a deep analysis of the effects on the <b>thermal</b> <b>track</b> buckling response produced by each parameter characterising the sleeper–ballast lateral resistance curve is presented and discussed. It is found that for current ballasted railway tracks, the minimum buckling temperature depends only on the limit lateral resistance, whereas a high value of the initial stiffness can lead to overestimation of the maximum buckling temperature, also taking into account the ‘natural’ decrease in the maximum buckling temperature due to an increase in the railway-traffic-induced defect amplitude...|$|R

40|$|In 1983 Frito-Lay {{embarked}} on {{building a new}} 160, 000 sq. ft. manufacturing facility in Kern County California. Based upon an estimated steam load between 5, 000 and 50, 000 lb/hr and an electrical load of approximately 1500 KW, the Engineering Department examined several energy optimization systems for this site. It was determined that a modified gas turbine cogeneration system was the best overall option. This system is unique in that it injects superheated steam from the waste heat boiler back into the gas turbine. When steam is injected into the turbine combustor, electrical output increases due to the increased mass flow and specific heat of the steam/air mixture. Electrical output ranges from 3. 5 KW without injection to a theoretical 6. 0 KW at maximum injection. Despite the volatility of nuclear power in California, project risk was low because the implementation of nuclear power would increase retail rates whereas the avoidance of nuclear power would increase avoided costs (buyback rates). When Frito-Lay decided, in 1983, {{to build a new}} snack food plant in Kern County, Calif., its main concern was to minimize the plant's total energy costs. The company therefore evaluated the various cogeneration options available and, for each option, conducted an energy-cost analysis. However, plant performance was not to be sacrificed {{in order to reduce the}} overall energy costs. After technical and economic analysis had been completed, Frito-Lay chose a cogeneration system using the Cheng Cycle [...] -a gas-turbine system using steam injection that allows for efficient <b>thermal</b> <b>tracking</b> and simultaneous electrical generation. The company began construction of the Kern County plant to produce corn, tortilla, and potato chips in October 1984. Preliminary operation began in April 1986. The plant encompasses 160, 000 ft, and is located just outside the city of Bakersfield. Steam is used for space heating as well as process applications. Total steam demand is expected to vary between 5000 and 55, 000 lb/hr, depending on production and seasonal variations. The electrical usage of the plant is anticipated to fall between 1000 and 2500 kW, again depending on plant operations. Current utility energy costs are on the order of 50 ?/therm for natural gas and 9 ?/kWh for electricity. Cogeneration technology involves the simultaneous production of thermal and electrical energy. In Frito-Lay's case, the cogeneration system supplies steam for plant process needs and generates electricity for plant consumption and sale to the local utility. The modified gas turbine used in the plant is a Cheng Cycle Series Seven, Figure 1. It is a product of International Power Technology (IPT) of Palo Alto, Calif., which has patented the steam injection and control systems. The system is unique in that it injects superheated steam from the waste heat boiler back into the gas turbine.
