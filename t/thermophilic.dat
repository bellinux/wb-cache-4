5|$|Suillus collinitus {{is often}} found in the same habitat with other <b>thermophilic</b> species, {{including}} S.mediterraneensis and S.bellinii, especially in the Mediterranean basin. Some common species which occur throughout much of Europe and also associate with two-needled pines include S.luteus and S.granulatus.|$|E
5|$|Though {{typically}} {{associated with}} heat-induced protein expression, RNA thermometers can also regulate cold-shock proteins. For example, the expression of two 7kDa proteins are regulated by an RNA thermometer in the <b>thermophilic</b> bacterium Thermus thermophilus and a similar mechanism has been identified in Enterobacteriales.|$|E
5|$|Thermal {{disruption}} at {{elevated temperature}} increases {{the rate of}} depurination (loss of purine bases from the DNA backbone) and single-strand breaks. For example, hydrolytic depurination {{is seen in the}} <b>thermophilic</b> bacteria, which grow in hot springs at 40–80°C. The rate of depurination (300 purine residues per genome per generation) is too high in these species to be repaired by normal repair machinery, hence a possibility of an adaptive response cannot be ruled out.|$|E
5|$|Biogas, or {{landfill}} gas, is a biofuel produced {{through the}} intermediary stage of anaerobic digestion consisting mainly of 45–90% biologically produced methane and carbon dioxide. In early 2007 a <b>thermophilic</b> anaerobic digestion facility was commissioned in Stornoway in the Western Isles. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) and the Renewable Energy Association are also {{leading the way}} towards {{the establishment of a}} digestate standard to facilitate the use of solid outputs from digesters on land. Anaerobic digestion and mechanical biological treatment facilities have been planned at a number of other locations in Scotland, such as Westray.|$|E
5|$|Some viruses {{replicate}} within archaea: {{these are}} double-stranded DNA viruses with unusual and sometimes unique shapes. These viruses {{have been studied}} in most detail in the <b>thermophilic</b> archaea, particularly the orders Sulfolobales and Thermoproteales. Defences against these viruses involve RNA interference from repetitive DNA sequences within archaean genomes {{that are related to}} the genes of the viruses. Most archaea have CRISPR–Cas systems as an adaptive defence against viruses. These enable archaea to retain sections of viral DNA, which are then used to target and eliminate subsequent infections by the virus using a process similar to RNA interference.|$|E
5|$|The {{classification}} of archaea, and of prokaryotes in general, is a rapidly moving and contentious field. Current classification systems aim to organize archaea into groups of organisms that share structural features and common ancestors. These classifications {{rely heavily on}} the use of the sequence of ribosomal RNA genes to reveal relationships between organisms (molecular phylogenetics). Most of the culturable and well-investigated species of archaea are members of two main phyla, the Euryarchaeota and Crenarchaeota. Other groups have been tentatively created. For example, the peculiar species Nanoarchaeum equitans, which was discovered in 2003, has been given its own phylum, the Nanoarchaeota. A new phylum Korarchaeota has also been proposed. It contains a small group of unusual <b>thermophilic</b> species that shares features of both of the main phyla, but is most closely related to the Crenarchaeota. Other recently detected species of archaea are only distantly related to any of these groups, such as the Archaeal Richmond Mine acidophilic nanoorganisms (ARMAN, comprising Micrarchaeota and Parvarchaeota), which were discovered in 2006 and are some of the smallest organisms known.|$|E
5|$|Within the abyssal and hadal zones, {{the areas}} around {{submarine}} hydrothermal vents and cold seeps have {{by far the}} greatest biomass and biodiversity per unit area. Fueled by the chemicals dissolved in the vent fluids, these areas are often home to large and diverse communities of <b>thermophilic,</b> halophilic and other extremophilic prokaryotic microorganisms (such {{as those of the}} sulfide-oxidizing Beggiatoa genus), often arranged in large bacterial mats near cold seeps. In these locations, chemosynthetic archaea and bacteria typically form the base of the food chain. Although the process of chemosynthesis is entirely microbial, these chemosynthetic microorganisms often support vast ecosystems consisting of complex multicellular organisms through symbiosis. These communities are characterized by species such as vesicomyid clams, mytilid mussels, limpets, isopods, giant tube worms, soft corals, eelpouts, galatheid crabs, and alvinocarid shrimp. The deepest seep community discovered thus far is in the Japan Trench, at a depth of 7700meters.|$|E
5|$|Recently, {{several studies}} have shown that archaea exist not only in {{mesophilic}} and <b>thermophilic</b> environments but are also present, sometimes in high numbers, at low temperatures as well. For example, archaea are common in cold oceanic environments such as polar seas. Even more significant are the large numbers of archaea found throughout the world's oceans in non-extreme habitats among the plankton community (as part of the picoplankton). Although these archaea can be present in extremely high numbers (up to 40% of the microbial biomass), almost none of these species have been isolated and studied in pure culture. Consequently, our understanding of the role of archaea in ocean ecology is rudimentary, so their full influence on global biogeochemical cycles remains largely unexplored. Some marine Crenarchaeota are capable of nitrification, suggesting these organisms may affect the oceanic nitrogen cycle, although these oceanic Crenarchaeota may also use other sources of energy. Vast numbers of archaea are also found in the sediments that cover the sea floor, with these organisms making up the majority of living cells at depths over 1 meter below the ocean bottom. It has been demonstrated that in all oceanic surface sediments (from 1000- to 10,000-m water depth), the impact of viral infection is higher on archaea than on bacteria and virus-induced lysis of archaea accounts for up to one-third of the total microbial biomass killed, resulting in the release of ~0.3 to 0.5 gigatons of carbon per year globally.|$|E
25|$|<b>Thermophilic</b> {{digestion}} {{takes place}} optimally around 49 to 57°C, or at elevated temperatures up to 70°C, where thermophiles {{are the primary}} microorganisms present.|$|E
25|$|Composting toilets {{greatly reduce}} human waste volumes through psychrophilic, <b>thermophilic</b> or {{mesophilic}} composting. Keeping the composting chamber insulated and warm protects {{the composting process}} from slowing due to low temperatures.|$|E
25|$|The <b>thermophilic</b> {{bacterium}} Brevibacillus borstelensis (strain 707) {{was isolated}} from a soil sample {{and found to}} use low-density polyethylene as a sole carbon source when incubated together at 50nbsp&°C. Biodegradation increased with time exposed to ultraviolet radiation.|$|E
25|$|Other organisms require {{additional}} metals as enzyme cofactors, such as vanadium in the nitrogenase of the nitrogen-fixing bacteria {{of the genus}} Azotobacter, tungsten in the aldehyde ferredoxin oxidoreductase of the <b>thermophilic</b> archaean Pyrococcus furiosus, and even cadmium in the carbonic anhydrase from the marine diatom Thalassiosira weissflogii.|$|E
25|$|Studies of this extreme <b>thermophilic</b> {{bacterium}} {{that could}} be grown in cell culture was initially centered on attempts to understand how protein enzymes (which normally inactivate at high temperature) can function at high temperature in thermophiles. In 1970, Freeze and Brock published an article describing a thermostable aldolase enzyme from T. aquaticus.|$|E
25|$|Almost all PCR {{applications}} {{employ a}} heat-stable DNA polymerase, such as Taq polymerase, an enzyme originally {{isolated from the}} <b>thermophilic</b> bacterium Thermus aquaticus. This DNA polymerase enzymatically assembles a new DNA strand from free nucleotides, {{the building blocks of}} DNA, by using single-stranded DNA as a template and DNA oligonucleotides (the primers mentioned above) to initiate DNA synthesis.|$|E
25|$|Anaerobic digesters can be {{designed}} and engineered to operate using {{a number of different}} configurations and can be categorized into batch vs. continuous process mode, mesophilic vs. <b>thermophilic</b> temperature conditions, high vs. low portion of solids, and single stage vs. multistage processes. More initial build money and a larger volume of the batch digester is needed to handle the same amount of waste as a continuous process digester. Higher heat energy is demanded in a <b>thermophilic</b> system compared to a mesophilic system and has a larger gas output capacity and higher methane gas content. For solids content, low will handle up to 15% solid content. Above this level is considered high solids content and can also be known as dry digestion. In a single stage process, one reactor houses the four anaerobic digestion steps. A multistage process utilizes two or more reactors for digestion to separate the methanogenesis and hydrolysis phases.|$|E
25|$|The Yellowstone {{hot springs}} are {{important}} for their diversity of <b>thermophilic</b> bacteria. These bacteria have been useful in studies {{of the evolution of}} photosynthesis and as sources of thermostable enzymes for molecular biology. Although the smell of sulfur is common and there are some sulfur fixing cyanobacteria, it has been found that hydrogen is being used as an energy source by extremophile microbes.|$|E
25|$|Deinococcus is one genus {{of three}} in the order Deinococcales. D. radiodurans is the type species of this genus, and the best studied member. All known members of the genus are radioresistant: D. proteolyticus, D. radiopugnans, D. radiophilus, D. grandis, D. indicus, D. frigens, D. saxicola, D. marmoris, D. deserti, D. geothermalis and D. murrayi; the latter two are also <b>thermophilic.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{autocorrelation}} {{analysis of}} some of these numerical sequences show characteristic periodicities in complete genomes. In fact, after detecting archaea-like regions in the <b>thermophilic</b> bacteria Thermotoga maritima, periodicity spectra of these regions were compared to the periodicity spectra of the homologous regions in the archaea Pyrococcus horikoshii. The revealed similarities in the periodicity were strong supporting evidence for a case of massive HGT between the bacteria and the archaea kingdoms.|$|E
25|$|Secondary {{treatment}} {{can be performed}} at the community or household level and can include <b>thermophilic</b> composting where fecal material is composted at over 50°C, prolonged storage with the duration of 1.5 to two years, chemical treatment with ammonia from urine to inactivate the pathogens, solar sanitation for further drying or heat treatment to eliminate pathogens. The most difficult pathogens to eliminate from the drying feces in the feces vaults are the helminth eggs which can cause helminth infections.|$|E
25|$|Acinetobacter {{has been}} found to {{partially}} degrade low molecular weight polyethylene oligomers. When used in combination, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Sphingomonas can degrade over 40% of the weight of plastic bags in less than three months. The <b>thermophilic</b> bacterium Brevibacillus borstelensis (strain 707) was isolated from a soil sample and found capable of using low-density polyethylene as a sole carbon source when incubated at 50 degrees Celsius. Pre-exposure of the plastic to ultraviolet radiation broke chemical bonds and aided biodegradation; the longer the period of UV exposure, the greater the promotion of the degradation.|$|E
25|$|The {{residence}} {{time in a}} digester varies with the amount and type of feed material, and with {{the configuration of the}} digestion system. In a typical two-stage mesophilic digestion, {{residence time}} varies between 15 and 40days, while for a single-stage <b>thermophilic</b> digestion, residence times is normally faster and takes around 14days. The plug-flow nature of some of these systems will mean the full degradation of the material may not have been realised in this timescale. In this event, digestate exiting the system will be darker in colour and will typically have more odour.|$|E
25|$|Thermal {{pollution}} is the rise or {{fall in the}} temperature of a natural body of water caused by human influence. Thermal pollution, unlike chemical pollution, results in {{a change in the}} physical properties of water. A common cause of thermal {{pollution is}} the use of water as a coolant by power plants and industrial manufacturers. Elevated water temperatures decrease oxygen levels, which can kill fish and alter food chain composition, reduce species biodiversity, and foster invasion by new <b>thermophilic</b> species.

25|$|Setosphaeria rostrata is a <b>thermophilic</b> fungus with an asexual {{reproductive}} form {{treated in}} the genus Exserohilum (as Exserohilum rostratum). This fungus is a common plant pathogen, causing leaf spots as well as crown rot and root rot in grasses. It {{is also found in}} soils and on textiles in subtropical and tropical regions. Exserohilum rostratum is one of the 35 Exserohilum species implicated uncommonly as opportunistic pathogens of humans where it is an etiologic agent of sinusitis, keratitis and CNS vasculitis as well as cutaneous and subcutaneous mycoses. Infections caused by Exserohilum are most often seen in regions with hot climates particularly Israel, India and Southern USA.|$|E
25|$|Exophiala dermatitidis is a <b>thermophilic</b> black yeast, and {{a member}} of the Herpotrichiellaceae. While the species is only found at low {{abundance}} in nature, metabolically active strains are commonly isolated in saunas, steam baths, and dish washers. Exophiala dermatitidis only rarely causes infection in humans, however cases have been reported around the world. In East Asia, the species has caused lethal brain infections in young and otherwise healthy individuals. The fungus has been known to cause cutaneous and subcutaneous phaeohyphomycosis, and as a lung colonist in people with cystic fibrosis in Europe. In 2002, an outbreak of systemic E. dermatitidis infection occurred in women who had received contaminated steroid injections at North Carolina hospitals.|$|E
25|$|Under typical circumstances, hydrolysis, acetogenesis, and {{acidogenesis}} {{occur within}} the first reaction vessel. The organic material is then heated to the required operational temperature (either mesophilic or <b>thermophilic)</b> prior to being pumped into a methanogenic reactor. The initial hydrolysis or acidogenesis tanks prior to the methanogenic reactor can provide a buffer to {{the rate at which}} feedstock is added. Some European countries require a degree of elevated heat treatment to kill harmful bacteria in the input waste. In this instance, there may be a pasteurisation or sterilisation stage prior to digestion or between the two digestion tanks. Notably, {{it is not possible to}} completely isolate the different reaction phases, and often some biogas is produced in the hydrolysis or acidogenesis tanks.|$|E
25|$|The Iberian Peninsula, {{located on}} an {{important}} route between Africa and Europe, was enriched by the arrival, following the climate change, of wetland plants, <b>thermophilic</b> plants (those {{that require a}} great deal of heat), xerophilic plants (those that require a dry climate), orophilic (sub-alpine) plants, Boreo-alpine plants, and so on, many of which managed to remain, thanks to the diversity of environments that exist in the mountain ranges, and which allowed them to rise in altitude if the climate was too warm, or descend if it became too cold. The geological complexity of the majority of Iberian mountains, especially of the Cordillera Bética, Sistema Ibérico, and Pyrenees, also greatly increased the number of new environments to which it was possible to adapt, resulting in today's wide variety of flora.|$|E
500|$|The {{specific}} colours of geysers {{derive from}} the fact that despite the apparently harsh conditions, life is often found in them (and also in other hot habitats) in the form of <b>thermophilic</b> prokaryotes. No known eukaryote can survive over [...]|$|E
500|$|In the 1960s, {{when the}} {{research}} of biology of geysers first appeared, scientists were generally convinced that no life can survive above around —the upper limit {{for the survival of}} cyanobacteria, as the structure of key cellular proteins and deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) would be destroyed.

500|$|Extremophile archaea, {{particularly}} those resistant either to heat or to extremes of acidity and alkalinity, {{are a source}} of enzymes that function under these harsh conditions. These enzymes have found many uses. For example, thermostable DNA polymerases, such as the Pfu DNA polymerase from Pyrococcus furiosus, revolutionized molecular biology by allowing the polymerase chain reaction to be used in research as a simple and rapid technique for cloning DNA. In industry, amylases, galactosidases and pullulanases in other species of Pyrococcus that function at over [...] allow food processing at high temperatures, such as the production of low lactose milk and whey. Enzymes from these <b>thermophilic</b> archaea also tend to be very stable in organic solvents, allowing their use in environmentally friendly processes in green chemistry that synthesize organic compounds. This stability makes them easier to use in structural biology. Consequently, the counterparts of bacterial or eukaryotic enzymes from extremophile archaea are often used in structural studies.|$|E
500|$|Scientists first {{reported}} evidence of microbes in the accretion ice in 1999. Since then, a different {{team led by}} Scott O. Rogers has been identifying a variety of bacteria and fungi from accretion ice (not from the subglacial water layer) collected during U.S. drilling projects in the 1990s. According to him, this indicates that the lake below the ice is not sterile but contains a unique ecosystem. [...] Then Scott Rogers published in July 2013 that his team performed nucleic acid (DNA and RNA) sequencing and the results allowed deduction of the metabolic pathways represented in the accretion ice and, by extension, in the lake. The team found 3,507 unique gene sequences, and approximately 94% of the sequences were from bacteria and 6% were from Eukarya. Taxonomic classifications (to genus and/or species) or identification were possible for 1,623 of the sequences. In general, the taxa were similar to organisms previously described from lakes, brackish water, marine environments, soil, glaciers, ice, lake sediments, deep-sea sediments, deep-sea thermal vents, animals and plants. Sequences from aerobic, anaerobic, psychrophilic, <b>thermophilic,</b> halophilic, alkaliphilic, acidophilic, desiccation-resistant, autotrophic, and heterotrophic organisms were present, including a number from multicellular eukaryotes.|$|E
2500|$|In <b>thermophilic</b> {{composting}} {{bacteria that}} thrive at temperatures [...] of [...] oxidize (break down) waste into its components, {{some of which}} are consumed in the process, reducing volume and eliminating potential pathogens. To destroy pathogens, <b>thermophilic</b> composting must heat the compost pile sufficiently, or enough time (1–2 years) must elapse since fresh material was added that biological activity has had the same pathogen removal effect.|$|E
2500|$|When {{studies of}} {{biological}} organisms in hot springs {{began in the}} 1960s, scientists thought that the life of <b>thermophilic</b> bacteria could not be sustained in temperatures above about [...] Soon, however, {{it was discovered that}} many bacteria in different springs not only survived, but also thrived in higher temperatures. In 1969, Thomas D. Brock and Hudson Freeze of Indiana University reported a new species of [...] <b>thermophilic</b> bacteria which they named Thermus aquaticus. The bacterium was first discovered in the Lower Geyser Basin of Yellowstone National Park, near the major [...] Great Fountain Geyser and White Dome Geyser, and has since been found in similar thermal habitats around the world.|$|E
2500|$|A limit {{case has}} been reached in Bolivia, with {{anaerobic}} digestion in temperature working conditions of less than 10°C. The anaerobic process is very slow, taking {{more than three times}} the normal mesophilic time process. In experimental work at University of Alaska Fairbanks, a 1,000 litre digester using psychrophiles harvested from [...] "mud from a frozen lake in Alaska" [...] has produced 200–300litres of methane per day, about 20 to 30% of the output from digesters in warmer climates. Mesophilic species outnumber thermophiles, and they are also more tolerant to changes in environmental conditions than thermophiles. Mesophilic systems are, therefore, considered to be more stable than <b>thermophilic</b> digestion systems. In contrast, while <b>thermophilic</b> digestion systems are considered less stable, their energy input is higher, with more biogas being removed from the organic matter in an equal amount of time. The increased temperatures facilitate faster reaction rates, and thus faster gas yields. Operation at higher temperatures facilitates greater pathogen reduction of the digestate. In countries where legislation, such as the Animal By-Products Regulations in the European Union, requires digestate to meet certain levels of pathogen reduction there may be a benefit to using <b>thermophilic</b> temperatures instead of mesophilic.|$|E
2500|$|Thermus aquaticus is {{a species}} of {{bacteria}} that can tolerate high temperatures, one of several <b>thermophilic</b> bacteria that belong to the Deinococcus–Thermus group. [...] It {{is the source of}} the heat-resistant enzyme Taq DNA polymerase, one of the most important enzymes in molecular biology because of its use in the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) DNA amplification technique.|$|E
2500|$|One {{guideline}} {{claims that}} pathogen levels {{are reduced to}} a safe level by <b>thermophilic</b> composting at temperatures of 55°C {{for at least two}} weeks or at 60°C for one week. An alternative guideline claims that complete pathogen destruction may be achieved already if the entire compost heap reaches a temperature of [...] for one hour, [...] for one day, [...] for one week or [...] for one month, although others regard this as overly optimistic.|$|E
