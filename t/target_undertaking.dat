Thus, addressing these fundamental climate questions ultimately has much broader implications from decision-making, policy and adaptation perspectives. Incorporating the knowledge gained from the climate research into these realms of course requires a larger, integrative process, as discussed elsewhere in this issue (Goddard et al. 2014).|$|R

40|$|Abstract – Ground {{targets are}} {{constrained}} on the Earth with their velocity vector direction aligned mostly along the body longitudinal axis. The pose angle therefore carries kinematic information useful for tracking maneuvering targets. For target identification (ID), range profiles obtained {{by a high}} range resolution (HRR) radar are compared with reference templates in pose angle per target class, thus producing pose angle estimates. In this paper, we present a method for measuring the pose angle of a maneuvering target by first converting the matching scores of a classifier into a “likelihood ” function and then updating the likelihood function probabilistically. By accumulating the likelihoods of possible poses over time, it enables the pose angular tracking as the <b>target</b> is <b>undertaking</b> turn maneuvers. Simulation results for pose angular tracking are presented wherein range profiles are generated from RF signatures of moving targets...|$|R
40|$|Previous reports {{indicating}} that forest properties owned by women were less extensively managed than those owned by men were partly attributed to women not having been fully socialized into family forestry.

The data were obtained from the Data Base for Forest Owner Analysis and concerned almost 9000 forest management units.

40|$|International audienceIn {{mine warfare}} context, {{performances}} of automatic target recognition (ATR) processes {{are known to}} highly depend on the underwater environment. In this study, {{we focus on the}} detection of mine-like-objects (MLO) in sand ripple seafloors. This particular seafloor type degrades detector performance by decreasing the detection probability and increasing the number of false alarms. To tackle this issue, we propose a method based on the monogenic signal and the concept of intrinsic dimensionality to characterize ripple seafloors, and then identifying geometrical anomalies caused by the presence of a MLO. This environmental information about the ripple field is taken into consideration to automatically create a map in which the potential armful object is set clearly visible to facilitate its detection. To validate and assess the performance of the proposed detection algorithm, a study of real synthetic aperture sonar (SAS) images containing various mine-like <b>targets</b> is <b>undertaken...</b>|$|R

We develop a dynamic threshold model of leverage that {{enables us to}} estimate the speed of adjustment in two separate regimes, {{each of which is}} associated with a differential adjustment cost. We examine several variables that proxy for adjustment costs, financial flexibility and financial constraints that affect capital structure adjustments. The results suggest that that firms deviating considerably far away from the <b>target</b> leverage <b>undertake</b> slower adjustment. Low-growth firms adjust leverage significantly more quickly than high-growth firms. Financial constraints, as measured by dividend ratios and investment, have a significantly negative effect on the speed of adjustment. Overall, the paper documents strong evidence for heterogeneous (but relatively fast) speeds of adjustment and asymmetric adjustment paths, which are consistent with the dynamic trade-off theory of capital structure.

Among the many instances of <b>targeted</b> sanctions <b>undertaken</b> by the Security Council in the last decade, a primary objective is to cut the flow of material and economic resources that are deemed to be feeding an internal conflict.
