25|$|Self-propelled {{particles}} (SPP) is {{a concept}} introduced in 1995 by Vicsek et al. as a special case of the boids model introduced in 1986 by Reynolds. A swarm is modelled in SPP by a collection of particles that move with a constant speed but respond to a random perturbation by adopting at each <b>time</b> <b>increment</b> the average direction of motion of the other particles in their local neighbourhood.|$|E
25|$|The Kalman {{filters are}} based on linear {{dynamical}} systems discretized in the time domain. They are modelled on a Markov chain built on linear operators perturbed by errors that may include Gaussian noise. The state {{of the system is}} represented as a vector of real numbers. At each discrete <b>time</b> <b>increment,</b> a linear operator is applied to the state to generate the new state, with some noise mixed in, and optionally some information from the controls on the system if they are known. Then, another linear operator mixed with more noise generates the observed outputs from the true ("hidden") state. The Kalman filter may be regarded as analogous to the hidden Markov model, with the key difference that the hidden state variables take values in a continuous space (as opposed to a discrete state space as in the hidden Markov model). There is a strong duality between the equations of the Kalman Filter and those of the hidden Markov model. A review of this and other models is given in Roweis and Ghahramani (1999), and Hamilton (1994), Chapter 13.|$|E
50|$|Time {{controls}} for each {{player in a}} game of rapid chess are, according to FIDE, more than 10 minutes, but less than 60 minutes. Rapid chess can be played with or without <b>time</b> <b>increments</b> for each move. In a game where <b>time</b> <b>increments</b> are used, a player can automatically gain, for instance, ten more seconds on the clock after each move. In a case where <b>time</b> <b>increments</b> are used, the total time per player for a 60 move game must be more than 10 minutes, but less than 60 minutes.|$|R
40|$|The {{accuracy}} of finite element {{solutions for the}} consolidation of porous media {{is influenced by the}} number and size of the <b>time</b> <b>increments</b> used in the analysis. A solution algorithm for adaptively selecting <b>time</b> <b>increments</b> for the solution of elastic and elastoplastic coupled consolidation problems in finite element analysis has been developed by Sloan and Abbo (1999). By treating the governing consolidation relations as a system of 1 st-order differential equations their algorithm utilized subincrementation to automatically adjust the size of <b>time</b> <b>increments</b> used in the analysis. Unlike other time stepping schemes, the procedure adjusts the <b>time</b> <b>increments</b> in order to control the error due to time stepping to lie near a specified tolerance. The algorithm was shown to be robust and to provide an efficient method for the solution of consolidation problems. In this paper the efficiency of the algorithm is further demonstrated through the analysis of the construction of an embankment on a deep layer of soft soil. The <b>time</b> <b>increments</b> required for the efficient and accurate analysis of the consolidation of porous media are shown to differ by orders of magnitude...|$|R

The criterion of minimum time step used in most existing methods can be eliminated at least for linear situations by using the simple formulation proposed by the authors.

40|$|In this paper, we {{introduce}} a time-stampless adaptive nonuniform sampling (TANS) framework, in which <b>time</b> <b>increments</b> between samples {{are determined by}} {{a function of the}} $m$ most recent increments and sample values. Since only past samples are used in computing <b>time</b> <b>increments,</b> {{it is not necessary to}} save sampling times (time stamps) for use in the reconstruction process. We focus on two TANS schemes for discrete-time stochastic signals: a greedy method, and a method based on dynamic programming. We analyze the performances of these schemes by computing (or bounding) their trade-offs between sampling rate and expected reconstruction distortion for autoregressive and Markovian signals. Simulation results support the analysis of the sampling schemes. We show that, by opportunistically adapting to local signal characteristics, TANS may lead to improved power efficiency in some applications.
