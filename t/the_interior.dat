5|$|As {{investigation}} and planning work continued, the Corps of Engineers {{reached an agreement}} with the Department of <b>the</b> <b>Interior,</b> the parent agency of the Bureau of Reclamation, in March 1962. The agreement stated the Corps would have responsibility for design and construction of the project, while <b>the</b> <b>Interior</b> Department would be responsible for running and maintaining the dam after completion. In the planning stages, <b>the</b> <b>Interior</b> Department also would be responsible for examining the economic feasibility of the project and its effect upon natural resources. This agreement negated much of the work of the REAB to that point, as <b>the</b> <b>Interior</b> Department promptly began its own three-year study of the dam's economic feasibility and environmental impact. The DRC report, though trumped by <b>the</b> <b>Interior</b> Department's new precedence in such matters, nevertheless released a report in April 1962, stating that the project was economically feasible and would attract new industries to Alaska. Meanwhile, the Corps of Engineers continued engineering studies.|$|E

40|$|Deductive Inference for <b>the</b> <b>Interiors</b> and Exteriors of Horn TheoriesIn this paper, we {{investigate}} the deductive inference for <b>the</b> <b>interiors</b> and exteriors of Horn knowledge bases, where <b>the</b> <b>interiors</b> and exteriors were introduced by Makino and Ibaraki [11] to study stability properties of knowledge bases. We present a linear time algorithm for the deduction for <b>the</b> <b>interiors</b> {{and show that}} it is co-NP-complete for the deduction for the exteriors. Under model-based representation, we show that the deduction problem for interiors is NP-complete while the one for exteriors is co-NP-complete. As for Horn envelopes of the exteriors, we show that it is linearly solvable under model-based representation, while it is co-NP-complete under formula-based representation. We also discuss the polynomially solvable cases for all the intractable problems...|$|R

At 05:52 UTC on July 4, 2005, the impactor successfully collided with the comet's nucleus. The impact excavated debris from <b>the</b> <b>interior</b> of the nucleus, forming an impact crater. Photographs taken by the spacecraft showed the comet to be more dusty and less icy than had been expected.
