50|$|In 1915, the Drama League of America {{recommended}} {{the construction of}} Shakespeare <b>gardens</b> to commemorate <b>the</b> 300th anniversary of the playwright's death. Noted Chicago landscape architect and Drama League member Jens Jensen designed such a garden, and fellow member Alice Houston suggested that <b>the</b> <b>Garden</b> Club of Evanston adopt the design. Northwestern University agreed to host <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> on its campus in late 1915, and construction and planting began the following spring. To raise funds for <b>the</b> <b>garden,</b> <b>the</b> <b>Garden</b> Club hosted its first garden fair in May 1916; the fair became an annual event and is still held to this day. Planting in <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> was finished in 1920, and in the following decade <b>the</b> <b>Garden</b> Club added <b>the</b> garden's other features. <b>The</b> completed <b>garden</b> was <b>the</b> first Shakespeare <b>garden</b> in <b>the</b> United States. In 1930, <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> was officially given to Northwestern; however, it is still maintained by <b>the</b> <b>Garden</b> Club. <b>The</b> <b>garden</b> {{was added to the}} National Register of Historic Places on November 16, 1988.

5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>gardens</b> {{thrived in}} their early years, by 1842 Jennison was in {{financial}} difficulties, and on 13December bankruptcy proceedings were initiated. Jennison's problems were caused by his failure to sell the Strawberry Gardens property, competition from the recently opened Manchester Zoological Gardens, and the Manchester and Birmingham Railway track cutting through the land Jennison had leased in December 1836, restricting access to <b>the</b> <b>gardens.</b> Jennison twice tried unsuccessfully to sell Belle Vue, after which his creditors allowed him {{time to make a}} success of the gardens; {{by the end of the}} 1843 season Jennison was able to repay his debts. The railway that had been a thorn in his side eventually proved to be an asset when Longsight railway station was re-sited closer to Belle Vue in 1842, making it easier for visitors to reach <b>the</b> <b>gardens.</b>|$|E

This is the {{so-called}} 'Lion Garden' in Suzhou [...]" [...] <b>The</b> Lion Grove <b>Garden</b> was built in 1342 during the Yuan Dynasty by a Zen Buddhist monk, Wen Tianru, in memory of his teacher Abbot Zhongfeng.

At that time, <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> was 6,670 m2 and was covered in rock and bamboo.
