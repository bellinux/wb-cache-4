The band was then asked to play in the North Pole for roughly 100 contest winners of a concert set up by Molson, a Canadian beer company. While the show was mildly motivating to the band, they returned home after two days.|$|E

For instance, Patient 1 may report that they had experienced [...] "a very bad headache that felt like their head was being hit by a hammer" [...] 1 when <b>taking</b> <b>Drug</b> X. Or, Patient 2 may report that they had experienced a [...] "slight, throbbing headache that occurred daily at about two in the afternoon" [...] 2 while <b>taking</b> <b>Drug</b> Y.
