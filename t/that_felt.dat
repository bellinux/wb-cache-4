Cotto left immediately after hearing the scorecards, with his team and family.|$|E
5|$|Val Guest, who had {{directed}} The Quatermass Xperiment, returned for Quatermass 2. Guest once again sought {{to create a}} film <b>that</b> <b>felt</b> as real as possible, using many cinema vérité techniques such as hand-held cameras. He was assisted in this respect by the moody, overcast cinematography of director of photography Gerald Gibbs, who also made extensive use of day for night photography for the film's climactic scenes. Guest planned each day’s shooting carefully, creating meticulous storyboards detailing all the shots {{he wanted to make}} that day.|$|E
5|$|Evolves environments {{are based}} on Earth's as the design team {{wanted to create a}} world <b>that</b> <b>felt</b> {{believable}} for players and had regions that made geological sense after an early concept design was found to be too extreme. As a result, the design team drew inspiration from real-world landscapes. The design team wanted Evolve to be set in lush forests so that Hunters and Monsters could hide from each other. The design team tried using the Source game engine to create a forest landscape but they ultimately failed. The design team then researched Crytek's CryEngine, which powers games like Far Cry and Crysis. As the design team felt that Far Cry and Crysis set new standards for in-game environments, they decided to utilize CryEngine for Evolve. Evolves maps were designed to be dark and mysterious, so that the various characters can hide from each other, as well as presenting a sense of surprise when players are ambushed.|$|E

5|$|The {{music for}} the 2011 neo-noir detective video game L.A. Noire, {{developed}} by Team Bondi and published by Rockstar Games, was composed by musicians Andrew Hale and Simon Hale. Recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London, the score also features contributions from Woody Jackson, who had collaborated with Rockstar on previous projects. Andrew Hale felt that composing the game's score was about setting a mood, attempting to compose music <b>that</b> <b>felt</b> accessible to players. The score was inspired by films from the 1940s, though the team avoided specifically composing for this time period, instead opting {{to focus on that}} after the music had been produced. Three supplementary vocal recordings were composed by The Real Tuesday Weld and performed by Claudia Brücken; they also sought to fit with the game's setting.|$|E
5|$|While {{the entire}} script {{was still in}} the draft phase, Maeda revised lines <b>that</b> <b>felt</b> unnatural after asking others for their {{opinions}} on it, including Na-Ga. When writing the script, Maeda made a conscious effort to write Charlotte in the framework of an anime series, as opposed to when he wrote the script for Angel Beats!, which he admits he wrote more akin to the framework of a video game. In this way, Toba felt that Charlotte was Maeda's effort to write a story in its purest form that could not be made into a video game, unlike Angel Beats!. Toba also noted that the characters in Charlotte are not written for a video game scenario, especially the protagonist, and went on to echo Horikawa's sentiment that Charlotte is akin to an I novel for Maeda. Toba explained that this is a result of Maeda's effort to remove the restrictions that come from writing the scenario for a video game.|$|E
5|$|In {{his sophomore}} year, Fernández {{was moved to}} {{shooting}} guard in the Temple starting lineup, a change <b>that</b> <b>felt</b> strange for {{him as he was}} used to playing point guard. He was still in frequent playmaking positions, and led the team in assists with 3.6 per game. He increased his scoring average to 12.6 points per game, second on the team, and led the Atlantic 10 in three-point percentage (45.3%). Fernández scored in double figures in 23 games. On December 13, he netted a career best 33 points to upset local rival and third-ranked Villanova 75–65; he shot 7-for-10 from beyond the arc. This earned him Philadelphia Big Five Player of the Week honors for the week of December 7–14. As a result of his performance against Villanova and his 21 points versus Seton Hall, Fernández was named Atlantic 10 Player of the Week on December 20. In the Fordham game on January 23, 2010, he took a blow to the head and was forced to leave in the second half. He missed the February 2 game against Richmond with post-concussive symptoms.|$|E

5|$|Sega also {{experienced}} success with arcade games. In 1992 and 1993, the company's new Sega Model 1 arcade system board showcased Sega AM2's Virtua Racing and Virtua Fighter (the first 3D fighting game), which {{played a crucial}} role in popularizing 3D polygonal graphics. In particular, Virtua Fighter garnered praise for its simple three-button control scheme, with the game's strategy coming from the intuitively observed differences between characters <b>that</b> <b>felt</b> and acted differently rather than the more ornate combos of two-dimensional competitors. Despite its crude visuals—with characters composed of fewer than 1,200 polygons—Virtua Fighters fluid animation and relatively realistic depiction of distinct fighting styles gave its combatants a lifelike presence considered impossible to replicate with sprites. The Model 1 was an expensive system board, and bringing home releases of its games to the Genesis required more than its hardware could handle. Several alternatives helped to bring Sega's newest arcade games to the console, such as the Sega Virtua Processor chip used for Virtua Racing, and eventually the Sega 32X add-on.|$|E
25|$|The Nixon White House tapes {{reveal that}} Bob Haldeman told Nixon <b>that</b> <b>Felt</b> {{was the source}} of leaks of {{confidential}} information contained in the FBI’s investigation to various members of the press, including Bob Woodward of The Washington Post. Gray claimed that he resisted five separate demands from the White House to fire Felt, stating that he believed Felt's assurances that he was not the source. Eventually, Gray demanded to know who was claiming Felt to be leaking. Attorney general Richard Kleindienst told Gray that Roswell Gilpatric, former deputy secretary of defense under John F. Kennedy and now outside general counsel to Time, had told John Mitchell <b>that</b> <b>Felt</b> was leaking to Sandy Smith of Time magazine.|$|E

Gray was forced to resign on April 27, after it was revealed Gray had destroyed a file that {{had been in}} the White House safe of E. Howard Hunt. Gray told his superiors <b>that</b> <b>Felt</b> should be named as his successor.|$|E

Leigh Hunt was particularly critical of the book, but {{some have suggested that}} his critical tone may have been because of his portrayal in the book. Edward John Trelawny, however, spoke very positively of the book. Thomas Love Peacock also enjoyed the book, but thought it should have been described as Hogg's autobiography. Some other commentators have noted that the book does portray Shelley as a very likeable person.|$|E
25|$|In 1717 Major Jean Daniel Abraham Davel was {{appointed}} {{the commander of}} the Lavaux region, which is in modern-day Canton Vaud. He identified with the French-speaking population <b>that</b> <b>felt</b> oppressed by the German-speaking city of Bern that occupied Vaud. Davel believed that he had been called by God to free the inhabitants of Vaud from Bern. On 31 March 1723 he mobilised 600 men and marched on Lausanne to ask the city leaders to revolt with him. However, they reported him to Bern and arrested him on the next morning. He was judged guilty of treason and beheaded.|$|E
25|$|Ibrahim Nasir {{was sworn}} in as the second President of the Republic of Maldives on 11 November 1968.

His foremost achievements included that of bringing the Maldives to the United Nations even with the opposition of some nations <b>that</b> <b>felt</b> awkward at including a nation of such a small size. He laid the foundations of the nation by modernising the fisheries industry with mechanized vessels and starting the tourism industry. Even today the nation is dependent on these two industries as a primary source of income and the main driver of the economy.|$|E

25|$|Yamaguchi saw Close Range Love as a classic-style love film, {{and wrote}} the song while {{considering}} the film's younger audience, who had no previous listening experience of the band. The first draft of the song followed the film's themes closely, which Yamaguchi found too simplistic, and made him unsure how to properly write a song for a romance film. The band decided to create a song without thinking of its use in the film, instead making a composition <b>that</b> <b>felt</b> natural {{in terms of their}} own musical style, and hoped the result would naturally match the film. Yamaguchi found that this technique worked well for the melody, however he found that writing lyrics entirely independent of the song was too difficult. Over time, he grew to be bored of the song's melody, and decided to change it during the late stages of creating the song. After doing this, he found the song's lyrics came easily to him.|$|E
25|$|The {{farmers of}} the Lackawanna Valley {{organized}} a fair in 1898. This fair, named the Maitland Fair and Driving Park Association, {{was held for}} at least twelve years. A horse racing course {{was built on the}} fairgrounds on what is currently the park campgrounds. Ownership of the land next fell {{into the hands of the}} a small railroad <b>that</b> <b>felt</b> it was being overcharged for water by the Scranton Gas and Water Company. The railroad had intended to build a reservoir to meet its needs for water. The plans for the building of the reservoir were dropped when the railroad and water company reached an agreement over the price of water. Next the land was rented to farmers by the railroad and later by Robert Moffat, a prominent Scranton coal baron. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania purchased the land in 1968. The state built constructed Lake Lackawanna and opened the park to the public on June 10, 1972.|$|E
25|$|She was {{familiar}} with the Lichfield Botanical Society's translation of Linnaeus' System of Vegetables (1785), for which she intended her Botanical Lectures as an introduction, but in a society that disapproved of female education, and in particular the new sexual classification of plants, she trod warily between the Linnaeans and contemporary propriety. She completed three books on Linnaean botany and plant physiology and a fourth on horticulture. Her Florist's Manual went into several editions. In her writing she faced two important obstacles, the backlash against educated women as typified by Richard Polwhele and his hostile satirical poem The Unsex'd Females (1798) and the moral concerns of a society <b>that</b> <b>felt</b> that such a delicate matter as the sexual reproduction of plants was inappropriate matter for 'female modesty' to be exposed to. Her sexual politics is evident in her resistance to Linnaeus' primacy of male sexual features in his classification system, emphasising that the female pistil is of equal importance to the male stamen.|$|E
