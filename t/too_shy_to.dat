5|$|T. E. Lawrence, perhaps {{better known}} as Lawrence of Arabia, was {{stationed}} at nearby RAF Cranwell just after the war, in 1926, where he wrote a revised version of his Seven Pillars Of Wisdom. He mentioned Navenby {{in a letter to}} a friend at the time, saying: I'm <b>too</b> <b>shy</b> <b>to</b> go looking for dirt. That's why I can't go off stewing into the Lincoln or Navenby brothels with the fellows. They think it's because I'm superior: proud, or peculiar or 'posh', as they say: and its because I wouldn't know what to do, how to carry myself, where to stop. Fear again: fear everywhere.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, deHavilland {{appeared}} in William Wyler's period drama The Heiress (1949), the fourth {{in a string}} of critically acclaimed performances. After seeing the play on Broadway, deHavilland called Wyler and urged him to fly to New York to see what she felt would be a perfect role for her. Wyler obliged, loved the play, and with deHavilland's help arranged for Paramount to secure the film rights. Adapted for the screen by Ruth and Augustus Goetz and based on the 1880 novel Washington Square by Henry James, the film is about a young naïve woman who {{falls in love with a}} young man, over the objections of her cruel and emotionally abusive father, who suspects the young man of being a fortune seeker. As she had done in Hold Back the Dawn, deHavilland portrayed her character's transformation from a shy, trusting innocent to a guarded, mature woman over a period of years. Her delineation of Catherine Sloper is developed through carefully crafted movements, gestures, and facial expressions that convey a submissive and inhibited young woman. Her timid voice, nervous hands, downcast eyes, and careful movements all communicate what the character is <b>too</b> <b>shy</b> <b>to</b> verbalize. Throughout the production, Wyler pressed deHavilland hard to elicit the requisite visual points of the character. When Catherine returns home after being jilted, the director had the actress carry a suitcase filled with heavy books up the stairs to convey the weight of Catherine's trauma physically instead of using a planned speech in the original script. The Heiress was released in October 1949 and was well received by critics. For her performance, she received the New York Film Critics Award, the Golden Globe Award, and the Academy Award for Best Actressher second Oscar.|$|E

Initially, she {{worried that she}} might be <b>too</b> <b>shy</b> <b>to</b> play before big crowds, but she eventually triumphed over her fear and realized her tremendous talent as a live performer when she played to rapt audiences at coffee houses and rallies around the sprawling Rutgers campus. She worked as a flight attendant before starting her music career.|$|E

25|$|After {{converting}} to Christianity, Chick wanted to evangelize others, {{but he was}} <b>too</b> <b>shy</b> <b>to</b> talk to people directly about religion. Chick heard from missionary Bob Hammond, who had broadcast in Asia on the Voice of America, that the Communist Party of China had gained significant influence among ordinary Chinese in the 1950s through the distribution of small comic books. Chick also began working with a prison ministry and created a flip chart of illustrations to use with his presentation. He hit upon {{the idea of creating}} witnessing tracts, which could be given to people directly or indirectly.|$|E
25|$|After {{finishing}} {{high school}} which ended at Grade 11, Muriel attended the Ontario Ladies College, a Methodist girls' school in Whitby, Ontario. Her aunt, Abbie Ball, taught there {{and offered to}} pay Muriel's fees. The College provided instruction in languages, history, mathematics and piano but little science. The 15-year-old Muriel was <b>too</b> <b>shy</b> <b>to</b> participate in drama even though her aunt was the school's drama coach. She also suffered from homesickness. Once a month, guest speakers, usually from the United Church of Canada addressed the student assembly. Muriel especially remembered James Endicott, then a missionary in China, {{who went on to}} become a prominent church leader and a lifelong acquaintance.|$|E
25|$|During {{basketball}} practice, Troy {{has trouble}} focusing because his thoughts are on Gabriella {{and the idea}} that he might enjoy singing more than basketball ("Get'cha Head in the Game"). Gabriella and Troy go to the musical auditions where Sharpay and her twin brother Ryan Evans (Lucas Grabeel) perform ("What I've Been Looking For"), but Troy and Gabriella are both <b>too</b> <b>shy</b> <b>to</b> audition. When Gabriella finally gains the confidence to step forward, Troy offers to sing with her, but drama teacher Ms. Darbus (Alyson Reed) tells them that they are too late. After Ms. Darbus attempts to leave, Kelsi Nielsen (Olesya Rulin), the musical's composer, trips and drops her music sheets. Troy and Gabriella rush to help her, and they sing together as Kelsi plays piano ("What I've Been Looking For (Reprise)"). Ms. Darbus overhears them and gives them a callback audition.|$|E

25|$|Reverend William Thorne (Brandon Firla) — Rev. Magee's replacement, {{feels it}} is his {{religious}} duty to compete with Amaar for {{the souls of the}} residents of Mercy. At first, he uses Amaar's forgiving nature to build his congregation and eventually kicks the mosque out, but brings them back because the Archdeacon likes having a mosque in the church to show cultural diversity. It is revealed he feels a great shame over being adopted and dislikes his older brother. Thorne eventually takes Amaar's help in becoming a better person and begins trying to convince Amaar to be his friend. He is jealous of Rev. Magee when he returns to be Amaar's best man because Amaar clearly prefers the old reverend. Thorne shows some weakness when it is revealed that he has a crush on Rose, the town librarian, but is <b>too</b> <b>shy</b> <b>to</b> ask her out. With the help of Rayyan and Amaar, the two begin dating.|$|E
25|$|Around {{the time}} that Phillips was eleven, she heard a sermon given {{by a member of}} the London Missionary Society. After hearing the sermon, Phillips began to ponder the idea of {{becoming}} a missionary in the future. After she decided that she was <b>too</b> <b>shy</b> <b>to</b> preach, though, Phillips abandoned the idea. As a young woman, Phillips also developed many different medical conditions, including haemorrhages and fibroids, eventually needing a hysterectomy. Due to her frequent visits to the hospital, Phillips then developed the ambition to become a doctor. Both of Phillips aspirations came together when Phillips was short on money. A friend of Phillips advised her to apply to receive a scholarship from the Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge to help to pay for her school tuition. To qualify for the scholarship, Phillips needed to go abroad as a missionary doctor and apply to a specific mission. Phillips decided to take the offer and applied to the Society for the Propagation of Gospel (SPG). Originally wishing to go to India, Phillips instead got assigned to do her mission trip in China and arrived in China on 23 October 1905.|$|E
25|$|Earlier in the story, Piro {{had seen}} Nanasawa Kimiko at an Anna Miller's restaurant, {{where she is}} a waitress, after Tsubasa brought him and Largo there. Later on, Piro {{encounters}} Kimiko outside a train station, where she is worrying aloud that she will miss an audition because she has forgotten her money and railcard. Piro hands her his own railcard and walks off before she can refuse his offer. This event causes Kimiko to develop an idealized vision of her benefactor, an image which is shattered {{the next time they}} meet. Despite this, she gradually develops feelings for Piro, though she is <b>too</b> <b>shy</b> <b>to</b> admit them. Later on in the story, Kimiko's outburst on a radio talk show causes her to suddenly rise to idol status. Angered by the hosts' derisive comments about fanboys, she comes to the defense of her audience, immediately and unintentionally securing their obsessive adoration. Later, her new horde of fanboys find out where she works and flock to the restaurant, obsessively trying to get pictures up her skirt. Piro works undercover as a busboy {{to get rid of all}} cameras. The scene eventually builds to a climax, in which Kimiko shouts at the fanboys and lifts her skirt in defiance, and they take photographs. Piro, provoked by her outburst into actively defending her, threatens the fanboy crowd, and collects all of their memory cards with the photos. On the way back from the restaurant, Kimiko is suffering from the aftermath of the scene and lashes out at Piro on the subway, which causes him to walk off.|$|E

There were some elk, but {{extremely}} wild; two only were killed. Antelopes were likewise seen, but <b>too</b> <b>shy</b> and fleet <b>to</b> be approached. A few beavers were taken every night, and salmon trout of a small size, so that the camp had principally to subsist upon dried buffalo meat.|$|R
500|$|Goodrem's manager, Glenn Wheatley, {{suggested}} making Nina into {{an aspiring}} singer. He said: [...] "We didn't want that soap star-turned-singer vibe but how cool {{would it be}} if she already was a singer? Neighbours developed a character to suit her {{rather than the other}} way around." [...] Goodrem worked with the writers to incorporate her music into the show, and Wheatley used the exposure that Neighbours gave Goodrem to relaunch her singing career. Nina had a powerful voice and wrote her own songs, but she was <b>too</b> <b>shy</b> <b>to</b> sing them in public. Harold Bishop (Ian Smith) discovered Nina's singing talent one day, and Connor entered one of her songs, [...] "Born To Try", in a talent contest at UniFM, where it won. As Nina was <b>too</b> <b>shy</b> <b>to</b> go and receive the prize, Tahnee Coppin (Anna Jennings-Edquist) tried to take credit for the song instead. Connor stopped her and Nina overcame her shyness to sing her song. Within weeks of it being performed, [...] "Born to Try" [...] became the number one single in Australia.|$|E
500|$|Brian Hyland's novelty-song hit [...] "Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini" [...] {{became a}} Billboard No. 1 hit {{during the summer}} of 1960: the song tells a story about a young girl who is <b>too</b> <b>shy</b> <b>to</b> wear her new bikini on the beach, {{thinking}} it too risqué.

500|$|Meanwhile, Sydney Chaplin {{had joined}} Fred Karno's prestigious comedy company in 1906 and, by 1908, {{he was one}} of their key performers. In February, he managed to secure a two-week trial for his younger brother. Karno was {{initially}} wary, and considered Chaplin a [...] "pale, puny, sullen-looking youngster" [...] who [...] "looked much <b>too</b> <b>shy</b> <b>to</b> do any good in the theatre." [...] However, the teenager made an impact on his first night at the London Coliseum and he was quickly signed to a contract. Chaplin began by playing a series of minor parts, eventually progressing to starring roles in 1909. In April 1910, he was given the lead in a new sketch, Jimmy the Fearless. It was a big success, and Chaplin received considerable press attention.|$|E

The show's producers said that Douglas was willing to go with any story line the writers could come up with. Executive producer and co-creator of the show, David Kohan said: [...] "There's something great about playing on a person's iconic status.

500|$|Among {{the comic}} themes during the Chicago years {{was that of}} {{courtship}} and marriage, with much humor made from the supposed aversion of many Irish males to the altar. The local plumber, Dacey, does not fall to matrimony until he enters the wrong city building and comes out with a marriage license rather than one for a dog. The fireman Hannigan's courting of Dolan's daughter is broken off after fifteen years when he is embarrassed by her giving him a wig as a Christmas present to cover his bald head; but for {{that she would be}} courted still. With Danny Duggan <b>too</b> <b>shy</b> <b>to</b> propose, Father Kelly acts on his behalf, resulting in [...] "the dear little colleen trembling and crying, but holding on to him like a pair of ice tongs".|$|E

40|$|The {{students}} often find some problems in practising English speaking. The problem frequently {{found is that}} their native language causes them difficult to use the foreign language.

60|$|By {{the end of}} {{the first}} year in the neighbourhood, Ramsden, as I say, had become {{practically}} a hermit. He lived all by himself in a house near the fifteenth green, seeing nobody, going nowhere. His only solace was golf. His late father had given him an excellent education, and, even as early as his seventeenth year, I believe, he was going round difficult courses in par. Yet even this admirable gift, which might have done him social service, was rendered negligible by the fact that he was <b>too</b> <b>shy</b> and shrinking <b>to</b> play often with other men. As a rule, he confined himself to golfing by himself in the mornings and late evenings when the links were more or less deserted.

60|$|An incident, {{related by}} Miss Ethel Williams, of Winchester, in her natural history notes {{contributed to a}} journal in that city, bears on this point. She had among the bird {{pensioners}} {{in the garden of}} her house adjoining the Cathedral green, a female thrush that grew tame enough to fly into the house and feed on the dining-room table. Her thrush paired and bred for several seasons in the garden, and the young, too, were tame and would follow their mother into the house to be fed. The male was wild and <b>too</b> <b>shy</b> ever <b>to</b> venture in. She noticed the first year that it had a wing-feather which stuck out, owing probably to a malformation of the socket. Each year after the breeding season the male vanished, the female remaining alone through the winter months, but in spring the male came back--the same bird with the unmistakable projecting wing-feather. Yet it was certain that this bird had gone quite away, otherwise he would have returned to the garden, where there was food in abundance during the spells of frosty weather. As he did not appear it is probable that he migrated each autumn to some warmer climate beyond the sea.|$|R
