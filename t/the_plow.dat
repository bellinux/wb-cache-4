5|$|In 1836, native Vermonter John Deere set {{out from}} Rutland, Vermont to Grand Detour, Illinois, founded by his friend and fellow Vermont native Leonard Andrus. The town lacked a local blacksmith, Deere's trade, and within two days Deere had a forge and new {{business}} established. In Vermont, Deere produced plows made from cast-iron and when he first arrived in Illinois he produced the same plows. Soil conditions in Illinois differ from those in Vermont. In Vermont the soil is sandy and falls easily away from <b>the</b> <b>plow</b> blade but in Illinois the soil is thicker and wetter; it stuck to <b>the</b> <b>plow</b> {{and had to be}} scraped off by the farmer as he plowed.|$|E

5|$|In {{the event}} that {{specially}} designed winter service vehicles are not available for plowing, other service or construction vehicles can be used instead: among those used by various authorities are graders, bulldozers, skid loaders, pickup trucks and rubbish trucks. Front-end loaders {{can also be used}} to plow snow. Either a snowplow attachment can be mounted on the loader's arm in place of the bucket, or the bucket or snowbasket can be used to load snow into the rear compartment of a snowplow or dump truck, which then hauls it away. Snowplows are dangerous to overtake; often, the oncoming lane may not be completely free of snow. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>plow</b> blade causes considerable spray of snow on both sides, which can obscure the vision of other road users.|$|E

It captures the decisive moment as farmer is caught mid-transition, with his left hand still on <b>the</b> <b>plow</b> handle, and taking the sword with his right hand from Liberty. The details of the farmer includes realistic work clothes, a yoked shirt with rolled sleeves and work trousers tucked into his boots. Liberty, identified by her Phrygian cap, stands just above the farmer in classical robes with a breastplate, sandals and cloak. Her face is impassive as she bestows the sword upon the farmer with her left hand while her right hand holds her pike.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologists {{have studied}} the {{prehistory}} of Iowa since the mid-19th century, when large American Indian mounds were first observed along the Mississippi. Early archaeologists such as S.V. Proudfit and Theodore Lewis documented large sites such as earthworks, mounds, and earthlodges. Truly systematic recording of Iowa sites began with Charles R. Keyes and Ellison Orr’s surveys and excavations beginning in the 1920s. Documenting hundreds of sites, often just before they disappeared under <b>the</b> <b>plow,</b> Keyes’ and Orr’s work {{led to the formation}} of the Iowa Archaeological Survey, the Iowa Archeological Society, and the designation of Effigy Mounds National Monument. After their deaths in 1951, the Survey was disbanded, and their efforts were continued by the University of Iowa’s Department of Sociology and Anthropology, which formed the Office of the State Archaeologist (OSA) in 1959. The OSA maintains an extensive list of more than 23,000 recorded archaeological sites in Iowa, and conducts survey and excavation across the state. Other institutions conducting archaeological research in Iowa include the State Historical Society of Iowa, the Iowa Archeological Society, the University of Iowa, Iowa State University, Grinnell College, Luther College, and private archaeological firms. Professional archaeologists in Iowa are represented by the Association of Iowa Archaeologists. Iowa archaeology grew dramatically beginning in the 1960s with the introduction of Cultural Resources Management legislation that required archaeological survey and excavation at many federal projects in Iowa.|$|E

The study was located in Mangunan, Giriredjo, Bantul, {{during the period of}} August to December 1995. Randomized Completely Block Design was employed with three replications and treatments. The treatments are : no plowing (A), soil <b>plowing</b> at <b>the</b> depth of 10 cm (B) and soil <b>plowing</b> at <b>the</b> depth of 50 cm (C).

40|$|Abstract <b>The</b> <b>plowing</b> {{charges of}} farm tractor-hire service {{enterprises}} sometimes influence <b>the</b> acreage <b>plowed.</b> This {{study was to}} explore the relationship between farm acreage <b>plowed</b> and <b>the</b> <b>plowing</b> service charges of farm tractor-hire service enterprises and also assess the effect of changes in plowing charges of farm tractor-hire service providers on <b>the</b> acreage <b>plowed</b> for smallholder farmers in four agro-ecological zones the coastal savannah deciduous forest transitional and guinea savannah of Ghana using a locally weighted regression LOESS. A total of 120 tractor-hire service providers who plowed for smallholder farmers over the period of 2008 and 2011 were randomly sampled across the four agro-ecological zones and interviewed. The results showed that the relation between <b>the</b> farm acreage <b>plowed</b> and <b>the</b> <b>plowing</b> service charges varied from one agro-ecological zone to the other and the average maximum acreage plowed per service provider was found to be in the neighborhood of 270 acres at average rate of GH 29 per acre in the Coastal Savannah Zone 850 acres at average rate of GH 28 per acre in the Deciduous Forest Zone 650 acres at average rate of GH 25 per acre in the Transitional Zone and 450 acres at average rate of GH 24 per acre in the Guinea Savannah Zone. The overall outcome of this study would assist the tractor-hire service providers policy makers and agricultural extension agents to know <b>the</b> suitable average <b>plowing</b> charges {{that a lot of the}} smallholder farmers could afford at the various agro-ecological zones to promote <b>the</b> <b>plowing</b> of more farm lands...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the feeding efficiency of the cattle egret (Bubulcus ibis) and the intermediateegret (Ardea intermedia) in relation to the stage of rice culture during two breeding seasons, 2006 and 2007, in Asan city,Chungcheongnam-do, South Korea. Cattle egrets caught mainly small invertebrate prey (insects and spiders, 98. 4 %) during all stages of rice cultivation, and had a higher prey capture rate in <b>the</b> <b>plowing</b> stage (14. 98 prey/min) than inother stages (2. 82 - 3. 51 prey/min). Therefore, the biomass intake rate of cattle egrets was highest in <b>the</b> <b>plowing</b> stage. <b>The</b> intermediate egret captured both loaches (43. 4 %) and small invertebrates (50. 6 %). The prey capture rates of intermediateegrets increased gradually from the flooding stage (0. 38 prey/min) to the planting stage (1. 09 prey/min), anddecreased in the growing stage (1. 04 prey/min). However, intermediate egrets had the highest biomass intake rates in theplowing stage because more loaches were caught in <b>the</b> <b>plowing</b> stage (0. 54 loaches/min) than other stages (0. 23 - 0. 36 loaches/min). Consequently, both intermediate egrets and cattle egrets had high energy intakes in <b>the</b> <b>plowing</b> stage andrice fields provided an important feeding habitat for both species...|$|R

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>plow</b> {{is a tool}} used {{in farming}} for initial {{cultivation}} of soil in preparation for sowing seed or planting. It has been a basic instrument for most of recorded history, and {{represents one of the}} major advances in agriculture. In modern use, a plowed field is typically left to dry out, and is harrowed before planting. An American agricultural pioneer named John Deere modernized <b>the</b> <b>plow</b> by shaping steel from an old sawmill blade and joining it to a wrought iron moldboard. Deere polished both parts smooth so the damp soil would no longer stick. After patenting the device in 1837, it became an instant success and a necessity on American farms.|$|E

25|$|The {{share is}} {{the cutting edge}} of the {{moldboard}} plow. The share makes the horizontal cut that separates the furrow slice from the soil below and when it is worn it is important to fit a new one. Conventional shares have points that are shaped. This shape, which was developed through years of field experience, penetrates ordinary soil efficiently and stands rough use. The share is shaped so that it pulls itself into the ground. As the share wears away, it becomes blunt and the plough will require more power to pull it through the soil. A plough body with a worn share will not have enough 'suck' to ensure that it penetrates the ground to its full working depth. The tip of the share is pointed downward, causing <b>the</b> <b>plow</b> to run into the ground. This is called “suction or down suck”; it literally sucks <b>the</b> <b>plow</b> into the ground, to a regulated depth. The clearance, also usually referred to as “suction or down suck”, varies with different makes and types of plows (the related clearance at the side is called “land suck”). Its configuration is related to soil type, particularly in the down suction, or concavity, of its lower surface. Generally, three degrees of clearance or down suction are recognized: regular for light soil, deep for ordinary dry soil, and double-deep for clay and gravelly soils. In addition, the share has horizontal suction, which is related to the amount its point is bent out of line with the landside. Down suction causes <b>the</b> <b>plow</b> to penetrate to proper depth when pulled forward, while horizontal suction causes <b>the</b> <b>plow</b> to create the desired width of furrow. The share is a plane part with trapezoidal shape. It cuts the soil horizontally and lifts it. Common types are regular, winged-plane, bar-point, and share with mounted or welded point. The regular share conserves a good cut but is recommended on stone-free soils. The winged-plane share is used on heavy soil with a moderate amount of stones. The bar-point share can be used in extreme conditions (hard and stony soils). The use of the share with mounted point is somewhere between the last two types. Manufacturers have designed shares of various shapes (trapezium, diamond, etc.) with bolted point and wings, often separately renewable. Sometimes the share cutting edge is placed well in advance of the moldboard to reduce the pulverizing action of the soil.|$|E
