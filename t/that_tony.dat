5|$|Tony {{was first}} {{mentioned}} in EastEnders in April 2008, when Palmer returned as Bianca Jackson following a nine-year {{absence from the}} show. It was established that although Tony was currently in prison, he and Bianca were in a relationship, and that he acted as a father-figure to her children Whitney Dean, Liam Butcher (James Forde) and Tiffany Dean (Maisie Smith). It was originally stated <b>that</b> <b>Tony</b> was the biological father of Bianca's youngest son, mixed-race Morgan Jackson-King (Devon Higgs), which raised confusion with viewers when it was later announced that Coghill, who is white, had been cast in the role. The show's producers explained <b>that</b> <b>Tony</b> was not really Morgan's father, and that the reason behind this deception would be revealed soon after his arrival.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{opens with}} Tony Sawicki rushing his friend Sammy, {{who has just}} been shot, to an empty warehouse. Before dying, Sammy implores Tony to find Beth Childs and pass on a message to her. Not knowing that Beth is dead, Tony's call to Beth's phone is {{answered}} by her former partner, suspended detective Art Bell, who brings Tony to Felix. Realising <b>that</b> <b>Tony</b> is a transgender clone of his foster sister Sarah Manning, Felix ascertains <b>that</b> <b>Tony</b> is unaware of his origins, but refuses to impart any information until Sarah arrives. After Sarah arrives at Felix's apartment and explains to Tony that they are clones, he is unflustered. He passes on Sammy's message for Beth, although neither Sarah or Felix understand what it means. Felix gives Tony his, Sarah and Art's phone numbers and shares a kiss with Tony before he leaves again.|$|E
5|$|Tony wanders in {{delirium}} {{until he}} is rescued by Mr. Todd, who rules over a small native tribe in a remote clearing in the jungle. Todd nurses Tony back to health. Although illiterate, Todd owns copies of the complete works of Charles Dickens, and asks Tony to read to him. However, when Tony's health recovers and he asks to be helped on his way, the old man repeatedly demurs. The readings continue, but the atmosphere becomes increasingly menacing as Tony realises he is being held against his will. When a search party finally reaches the settlement, Todd arranges <b>that</b> <b>Tony</b> be drugged and kept hidden; he tells the party <b>that</b> <b>Tony</b> has died, and gives them his watch to take home. When Tony awakes he learns that his hopes of rescue are gone, {{and that he is}} condemned to read Dickens to his captor indefinitely. Back in England, Tony's death is accepted; Hetton passes to his cousins, who erect a memorial to his memory, while Brenda marries Tony's friend Jock Grant-Menzies.|$|E

6000|$|It must be {{understood}} <b>that</b> <b>Tony's</b> language was figurative, for {{at the time he}} was speaking his [...] "white" [...] face was changed so much by paint and smoke that it quite equalled that of his adopted father in dirty brownness.|$|R
5|$|In {{the fifth}} and {{deciding}} game of the 1984 World Series against the San Diego Padres, Kuntz pinch-hit for designated hitter Johnny Grubb {{with the bases loaded}} and the score tied at three. Kuntz hit a pop-up to short right field <b>that</b> <b>Tony</b> Gwynn was unable to see.

5|$|Tony {{considers}} killing {{several of}} his associates for relatively minor infractions.

Dr. Melfi is convinced by friends <b>that</b> <b>Tony</b> is making no progress and may even be using talking therapy for his own sociopathic benefit. She drops him as a patient.|$|E
50|$|It {{is worth}} noting <b>that</b> <b>Tony's</b> {{reference}} to Angels with Dirty Faces is incorrect. He attributes the Priest's (Pat O'Brien) role to Humphrey Bogart, who portrayed the crooked lawyer in that film. This {{may have been a}} deliberate error due to Tony's mental state in the episode.|$|R
5000|$|On February 6, 2007 a {{court ruling}} in Amsterdam officially {{acknowledged}} <b>that</b> <b>Tony's</b> Chocolonely chocolate {{was produced in}} a slave-free manner.

When Whitney's brother Ryan Malloy (Neil McDermott) tries to attack Tony in court, Whitney says she will refuse to testify, claiming her witness statement was a lie and she was forced to say it. Bianca explains to Whitney <b>that</b> <b>Tony</b> will be set free and that he will target other children. Tony's barrister, Mrs Taylor (Jacqueline Defferary), cross-examines Whitney, trying to imply that she pursued him for several years, saying she refused to take 'no' for an answer and lied about the accusations. Tony shouts out that he is innocent but Whitney says she trusted him and he abused her, revealing the truth about the relationship. After leaving the courtroom, Whitney gives her barrister, Vivien Easley QC (Geraldine Alexander), a mobile phone with messages from Tony on it. A week later Tony is found guilty of all charges and sentenced to 13 years in custody. He smirks as the verdict is being read out but is taken away with his head in his hands.|$|E

She sends him into the shower to sober up, and summons Jim. He is unsure whether he knows the lines well enough to go onstage in Tony's place, but Laura encourages {{him to take the}} chance. As she hands him a prop dagger, he sees blood all over the dagger and her hands. Tony comes out of the shower and wants to finish the performance, so Jim allows him to go.

25|$|The game is not {{a direct}} {{adaptation}} of the 1983 film directed by Brian De Palma, but is instead an unofficial pseudo-sequel which changes {{the end of the}} film so <b>that</b> <b>Tony</b> Montana (originally played by Al Pacino) survives, and sets about exacting revenge on those who ousted him from power by re-establishing his drug empire in Miami.
