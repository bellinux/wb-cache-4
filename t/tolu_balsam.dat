5000|$|<b>Balsam</b> of <b>Tolu</b> and <b>Balsam</b> of Peru (Myroxylon balsamum) are {{sometimes}} called opobalsamum and {{are sometimes}} substituted for it, however {{they are not}} the true C. opobalsamum. The balsams have a sweet, aromatic, resinous scent with an odour resembling vanilla or benzoin. Both <b>Balsam</b> of <b>Tolu</b> and <b>Balsam</b> of Peru come from the same tree, Myroxylon, but each differs in production. The word Myroxylon is literally [...] "fragrant wood" [...] in Greek, or Quina/Balsamo. The balsams substitute for opobalsamum which some believe to be Stacte.|$|R

The principle balsams used in modern perfumery are Balsam of Peru, Balsam of <b>Tolu,</b> <b>Balsam</b> of Copaiba, Storax and Balm of Gilead opobalsamum. They {{have in common}} a vanilla like odor. The words Balsam and Balm are often used synonymously.” ...|$|E
50|$|The genus Myroxylon was {{originally}} described in 1753 by Linnaeus, such description was made using a specimen {{collected in the}} province of Cartagena (at the time Tolú was located {{in the province of}} Cartagena), and named it Toluifera balsamum. The genus Myroxylon was first established by Linnaeus filius in 1781, when he described Myroxylon peruiferum based on a specimen collected by Mutis in South America. Latex from Myroxylon trees is the source of Balsam of Peru and <b>Tolu</b> <b>balsam</b> (which differ in production) and composition.|$|E
5000|$|The {{portion of}} the Cordillera del Bálsamo (Balsam Mountain Range) that sits in the Municipality has an average {{elevation}} of 1030 m above sea level. The Cordillera del Bálsamo is named after the Myroxylon balsamum tree, one of two species of Central American and South American trees in the Fabaceae family (Leguminosae). The tree, often called Quina or Bálsamo, {{is well known in}} the western world as the source of Balsam of Peru and <b>Tolu</b> <b>balsam.</b> El Salvador is the main exporter of these resins, which are still extracted manually.|$|E
50|$|In 1841, Henri Étienne Sainte-Claire Deville {{isolated}} toluene by the dry distillation of <b>tolu</b> <b>balsam.</b> The resin, {{as well as}} {{the leaves}} and fruit, have been traditionally used by the people of Central America and South America to relieve coughs and asthma, and to treat wounds. Its name comes from Tolú (singular); Tolúes (plural), the name of the native precolumbian people that used to be the inhabitants at the same place where now is located Tolú, a small town and municipality in Sucre Department, northern Colombia (South America) by the Caribbean sea. Tolúes were the first reported to be using this resin in early Spanish chronicles.|$|E
5000|$|... "Balsam of Peru" [...] is a misnomer. [...] In {{the early}} period of Spanish {{dominion}} in Central and South America, the balsam was collected in Central America {{and shipped to}} Callao and Lima in Peru, then shipped onward to Europe. [...] It acquired the name of [...] "Peru" [...] because it was shipped from there. [...] Its export to Europe was first documented {{in the seventeenth century}} in the German Pharmacopedia. Today it is extracted under a handicraft process, and is mainly exported from El Salvador.There are two balsams obtained from Myroxylon sp. trees, Balsam of Peru and <b>Tolu</b> <b>Balsam</b> (not [...] "Balsam of tolú"). [...] "Balsam of Peru" [...] and [...] "Balsam of Tolu" [...] are produced in different way, see Myroxylon. [...] "Tolu Balsam" [...] is Not misnomer, it is rather a toponymy since the balsam was actually obtained from the latex of a tree originally described by Linnaeus as Toluifera balsamum later known as Myroxilon balsamum. In 1753 Linnaeus described the type specimen of Toluifera balsamum using a specimen collected in the province of Cartagena, probably a town called Tolú, which at the time was located in the province of Cartagena, and named it Toluifera balsamum in relation to the place of collection. In ecological terms, Tolu region can be described, according to Holddrige classification as Tropical Dry Forest, which is home to Myroxylon sp. trees.|$|E
5000|$|In 1841, {{he began}} his {{experiments}} with investigations of oil of turpentine and <b>tolu</b> <b>balsam,</b> {{in the course of}} which he discovered toluene. But his most important work was in inorganic and thermal chemistry. In 1849 he discovered anhydrous nitric acid (nitrogen pentoxide), a substance interesting as the first obtained of the so-called [...] "anhydrides" [...] of the monobasic acids. In 1855, ignorant of what Friedrich Wöhler had done ten years previously, he succeeded in obtaining metallic aluminium, and ultimately he devised a method by which the metal could be prepared on a large scale by the aid of sodium, the manufacture of which he also developed. Together with Friedrich Wöhler, he discovered silicon nitride in 1857. With Jules Henri Debray (1827-1888) he worked at the platinum metals, his object being on the one hand to prepare them pure, and on the other to find a suitable metal for the standard metre for the International Metric Commission then sitting at Paris. With Louis Joseph Troost (b. 1825) he devised a method for determining vapour densities at temperatures up to 1400˚C, and, partly with F. Wöhler, he investigated the allotropic forms of silicon and boron. The artificial preparation of minerals, especially of apatite and isorhor-phous minerals and of crystalline oxides, was another subject in which he made many experiments. But his best known contribution to general chemistry is his work on the phenomena of reversible reactions, which he comprehended under a general theory of [...] "dissociation." [...] He first took up the subject about 1857, and it was {{in the course of his}} investigations on it that he devised the apparatus known as the [...] "Deville hot and cold tube." ...|$|E
40|$|In {{alcoholic}} solution, {{the normal}} tissue lipoids used as "antigen " in the serum-diagnosis of syphilis are probably molecularly dispersed. Upon dilution with water, however, {{there is a}} marked aggregation of the lipoid molecules. The originally transparent solution becomes opalescent, gives a Tyndall phenomenon, and by darkfield examination, innumerable highly refractile lipoid particles in active Brownian motion can be seen. Their average size, the number visible, and therefore the degree of opalescence, depend upon the method of admixture of the two liquids (Sachs and Rondoni, 1909). If, to a diluted antigen in which all these microscopically visible particles are discrete, one adds syphilitic serum, there is, as Jacobsthal (19 tl) observed, a rapid clumping of the apparently unchanged lipoid micellae into coherent aggregates. Depending upon the concentration of the reagents, the temperature, time of incubation, etc., these aggregates {{may or may not}} exceed the limits of colloidal stability to form the optically visible "precipitate " first noted by Michaelis (1907). As he predicted, this precipitation phenomenon has found wide-spread diagnostic application. The Sachs-Georgi and Kahn precipitation tests, the Vernes flocculation reaction, the Murata test, the Sigma reaction, the Meinicke-Triibungs, Meinicke-Kl~trungs, and Miiller-Ballungs reactions, and the Hinton agglutination reaction are all basically the same. The lipoid antigen, modified by the addition of <b>tolu</b> <b>balsam,</b> cholesterol, glycerol, NaC 1, etc., forms a more or less stable "solution " (suspension) in normal serum; but in syphilitic serum there is a visible aggregation. * Aided {{by a grant from the}} Committee on Research in Syphilis, Inc...|$|E
