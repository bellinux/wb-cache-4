50|$|In 451 {{those who}} {{accepted}} the Council of Chalcedon similarly classified those who rejected it as Monophysite heretics. The Churches {{that refused to}} accept the Council considered instead <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> <b>they</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> orthodox; <b>they</b> reject the description Monophysite preferring instead Miaphysite. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> often called, in English, Oriental Orthodox Churches, to distinguish them from the Eastern Orthodox Churches.|$|R
50|$|While imprisoned, {{a mysterious}} {{stranger}} appeared {{and gave him}} an Atomic Axe to help him fulfill his need for vengeance. He escaped prison and fought Superman, but {{in the midst of}} battle a miscalculation with the Axe opened an interdimensional portal, through which the Persuader was cast. The Mxyzptlk Twins decide to rewrite history so <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> <b>they</b> <b>who</b> supplied the axe.|$|R
5000|$|Critics {{of the law}} charge <b>that</b> it <b>is</b> unconstitutional. <b>They</b> {{also say}} that it will bar {{legitimate}} voters from voting and discourage citizens. Examples of problems {{under the new law}} involved public figures: Texas judge, Sandra Watts, was unable to vote because the name on her photo ID did not match the name on the voter rolls. Also, State Senator Wendy Davis and Attorney General Greg Abbott were delayed in voting under the new law. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> all able to vote after signing affidavits attesting <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> claimed to <b>be.</b>|$|R
50|$|Source {{tracking}} {{pertains to}} the ability of some hypertext systems to rigorously track the exact source of every document or partial document included in the system; <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>they</b> remember <b>who</b> entered the information, when it was entered, when it was updated and by whom, and so on. This allows determining the exact history of every document (and even small parts of documents).|$|R
50|$|All {{the words}} listed are toponyms and {{describe}} common feelings and objects {{for which there}} is no current English word.

50|$|Critics of the {{legislation}} claim that state Fish and Wildlife agencies allocate funds primarily towards {{the creation of new}} hunting opportunities. There is a feeling amongst hunters, in general, that their tax money collected from firearms purchases should benefit them, given <b>that</b> it <b>is</b> <b>they</b> <b>who</b> pay the tax and establish the funding. The result <b>is</b> <b>that</b> little money <b>is</b> spent directly on initiatives other than those increasing hunting opportunities.|$|R
50|$|The article got {{many letters}} in favour and against, but two men, Tadhg Ó Sganaill and Colm Ó Murchadha, {{came to him}} asking him to organise a meeting towards setting up a council.

They symbolize Québec’s national heritage, {{and we should not}} simply brush them aside.|$|R
5000|$|The artistic {{heritage}} of A Pastoriza is {{noted for its}} many stone crosses, chapels and churches {{that make up the}} rural municipality. The Temple of Breton is considered the cradle of the diocese of Mondoñedo-Ferrol because it was the ancient Britoniensis episcopal until the eighth century. Several authors defend the existence of a British Christian society in this area. It <b>is</b> believed <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> <b>they</b> <b>who</b> founded a Breton bishopric.|$|R
25|$|Newar {{artists were}} the most sought after among the foreign artists living in Tibet. French missionary {{traveller}} Évariste Régis Huc has written <b>that</b> it <b>is</b> <b>they</b> <b>who</b> construct for the Buddhist temples those fine roofs of gilt plates, which resist all the inclemencies of the seasons and always retain a marvellous freshness and glitter. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> so skilful at this class of work <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> sent to the very interior of Tartary to decorate the Lamaseries.|$|R

[...] Sviridov {{and his friends were}} by a bus stand, waiting for a taxi to arrive. The Russian men were laughing and joking amongst themselves when the Caucasian group, passing by, confronted them and accused them of laughing at them.|$|R

Why, you ain't had them curtains washed yet!" [...] Invariably, whenever she was touched by the realization <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> <b>they</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> lonely, <b>they</b> wrecked her pitying affection by comments--questions--comments--advice.|$|R
5000|$|<b>That</b> <b>is,</b> {{conditions}} of inequality create ideologies which confuse people about their true aspirations, loyalties, and purposes. [...] Thus, for example, {{the working class}} has often been, for Marx, beguiled by nationalism, organized religion, and other distractions. These ideological devices help {{to keep people from}} realizing <b>that</b> it <b>is</b> <b>they</b> <b>who</b> produce wealth, <b>they</b> <b>who</b> deserve the fruits of the land, all who can prosper: instead of literally thinking for themselves, they think the thoughts given to them by the ruling class.|$|R
50|$|In eastern Colombia, {{near the}} cities of Vélez, Cúcuta, Socorro, and Tunja, Africans {{manufactured}} textiles in commercial mills. Emerald mines, outside Bogotá, were wholly dependent upon African laborers. Also, other sectors of the Colombian economy like tobacco, cotton, artisanry and domestic work {{would have been impossible}} without African labor. In pre-abolition Colombian society, many Afro-Colombian slaves fought for their freedom as soon as they arrived in Colombia. It <b>is</b> clear <b>that</b> there <b>were</b> strong free Black African towns called palenques, where Africans could live as cimarrones, <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>they</b> <b>who</b> escaped from their oppressors. Afro Panamanians are also related to Afro-Colombians, some historians consider <b>that</b> Chocó <b>was</b> a very big palenque, with a large population of cimarrones, especially in the areas of the Baudó River. Very popular cimarrón leaders like Benkos Biojó and Barule fought for freedom. African people played key roles in the independence struggle against Spain. Historians note that three of every five soldiers in Simon Bolívar's army were African. Not only that, Afro-Colombians also participated at all levels of military and political life.|$|R
50|$|Another belief about soul eaters <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> men <b>who</b> were cursed by witches {{and have}} to eat the souls of humans to live their lives. After the soul eater devours a victim's soul, the victim disappears as dust.|$|R

6000|$|On the way, {{and after}} {{entering}} the house which was appropriated to their use, Mark {{learned from the}} Prince that their approach to the capital had been discovered and announced by spies long before their arrival; <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> <b>they</b> <b>who</b> had discovered and revealed to the Queen Hockins's wonderful powers with the [...] "little tube."

50|$|The act of renouncing autocephaly and {{entering}} the omophorion of the Ecumenical Patriarchate, which left the UOC-USA with no direct tie {{to any of}} the Orthodox churches in Ukraine, led to several parishes leaving the UOC-USA to enter under the omophorion of the Kyiv Patriarchate in Ukraine, although some supporters of these parishes argue <b>that</b> it <b>is</b> <b>they</b> <b>who</b> remain in the same church and <b>that</b> it <b>is</b> the hierarchy of the UOC-USA which is now in a different church.|$|R

5000|$|The {{use of the}} Internet in {{elections}} is a fairly recent concept and as with any new technology it will undergo {{a certain amount of}} scrutiny until people can fully trust it and implement it into worldwide elections. Critics of online voting argued that online voting isn’t secure enough and thus creates a large amount of skeptics who oppose the use of online voting, which in turn will result in a challenge to implement online voting as the primary method of casting votes. Another area <b>that</b> people <b>are</b> worried about is the process of authentication of votes. In other words, what process will voters have to go through to ensure <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>who</b> <b>they</b> say <b>they</b> <b>are?</b> ...|$|R
