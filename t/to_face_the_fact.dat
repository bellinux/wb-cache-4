The old wooden {{structure of the}} school still stands today four blocks away from the Romualdez house. At school, Imelda had <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> of her family's humiliating poverty. She was frequently among the students who had to apologize for late payments.|$|E
25|$|During {{the buildup}} to the 2010 World Cup, Van Nistelrooy again made himself available, but was left {{out by the}} Netherlands' new coach Bert van Marwijk.

25|$|Moved into Norma's mansion at her insistence, Joe {{initially}} resents {{but gradually}} accepts his dependent situation. He sees that Norma refuses <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that her fame has evaporated and learns the fan letters she still receives are secretly written by Max. Max tells him Norma {{is subject to}} depression and has made suicide attempts.|$|E
60|$|He {{was unwilling}} <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts.</b> All his life--till that day--had been a wrestle with {{events in the}} {{daylight}} of this world, but now he could not bring his mind to the consideration of his position. It was Mrs. Travers who, after waiting awhile, forced on him the pain of thought by wanting to know what bearing Hassim's news had upon the situation.|$|R

I {{want you to}} realize that, in showing Mr. Hubbard's wife this little attention, you're not doing it because you scorn to drop an old friend, and want to do him the highest honor; but because you think you can palm off your second-class {{acquaintance}} on them for first-class, and try to make up in that way for telling her she had a hooked nose!" ...|$|R
25|$|So, {{while the}} name Packer appears {{many times in}} the book, the only serious comment that the writer makes about the whole affair (and he is right in his comment) is ”In one respect, and in only one I think, he (Packer) has done a service to the game by forcing us all <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> cricketers have been abysmally ill-paid.” So, as a whole “The Best Loved Game” is not about any {{controversial}} issue, it is simply about cricket being part of the English summer.|$|E
2500|$|A {{challenge}} for the modern archaeologist is to consider whether [...] in-situ preservation, or recovery and conservation on land is the preferable option; or <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that preservation in any form, other than as an archaeological record is not feasible. A site that has been discovered has typically been subjected to disturbance of the very factors that caused its survival in the first place, for example, when a covering of sediment has been removed by storms or the action of man. Active monitoring and deliberate protection may mitigate [...] further rapid destruction making in situ preservation an option, but long-term survival can never be guaranteed. For very many sites, the costs are too great for either active measures to ensure in situ preservation or to provide for satisfactory conservation on recovery. Even the cost of proper and complete archaeological investigation may be too great to enable this to occur within a timescale that ensures that an archaeological record is made before data is inevitably lost.|$|E
2500|$|Peter {{claims that}} the reason {{why he was so}} {{successful}} on the badminton court was because of his studies of Bushido, an ancient Japanese philosophy and his mentor, Miyamoto Musashi, a great samurai. Miyamoto Musashi began his “warrior’s pilgrimage” at age 13 when he began to train as a swordsmen and as a practicing Bushido Warrior. Legend claims that he killed his first opponent at age 14 in one of the 60 duels he fought over his lifetime. It is said that he was never defeated, both in single combat and during the 6 wars, in which he took part. At age 35, Musashi sheathed his sword to become a mentor, an artist and finally a writer, who penned one of Japan’s most influential pieces of literature – “The Book of the Five Rings.” Rasmussen had <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> of losing before he can entertain the thought of winning. Peter proved that his philosophy of playing badminton was very successful. [...] After finding Bushido and practicing it, Peter went on a 6-month winning streak that culminated tournaments such as the Japan Open, the Nordic Championship, the Danish Championship and finally the World Championships.|$|E

60|$|In {{the talk}} which followed, Bradley was brought <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> with <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> {{that these men}} were more earnest in {{maintaining}} the hold of their parties upon the offices than principles of legislation. They were not legislators in any instances; they were gamesters.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, Davide and Nina {{have made}} it to Amsterdam and started to try to find him. One evening, {{completely}} by chance, Davide sees his brother streak by on a bicycle. He races after him, and in the end manages to block him near the port. They have a massive argument. Marco has no intention of giving up on his quest, but Davide manages to persuade him that his suicide mission is impracticable. The doctors he has spoken to have told him in no uncertain terms that Marco's condition is not eligible for euthanasia. And even if his condition was eligible, as a foreign citizen he would still not qualify for assisted suicide. Marco has <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> and give up.|$|R
2500|$|He {{continued}} {{being an}} outspoken observer of Serbian politics and Serb society in general. In a May 2008 interview, following the Serbian parliamentary election, {{he used the}} fact that the Serbian Radical Party (SRS) of Vojislav Šešelj, Tomislav Nikolić, and Aleksandar Vučić received 1.2 million votes {{as a starting point for}} a wider comment on Serbian society: [...] "Political parties aren't the problem in Serbia. The problem here is the society that votes for those parties. I can't even begin to image what those million people that voted for SRS are like. We need <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> we live in a country where 50% of the population is semiliterate, uninformed, and poisoned by the media outlets with nontransparent ownership structure so that we don't know who's financing them. When a person like that gets out to vote, I'm convinced they don't have the slightest clue who it is they're really voting for. Democracy makes sense only when you've got an economically independent and well informed voter, someone who has the information and is capable of thinking. Simply counting up the votes without really knowing what's behind them is stupidity. I'm sorry, but in Serbs we have the same people that elected Slobodan Milošević on multiple occasions. Big electoral numbers do not impress me at all".|$|E
6000|$|Stevenson was by {{this time}} {{beginning}} to realise that work at [...] play-writing in collaboration with Mr. Henley was doing much more to [...] exhaust his strength than to replenish either of their purses, and [...] Mr. Henley, who had built hopes of fame and fortune on their [...] collaboration, was very unwilling <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact.</b>|$|E
60|$|Ormsgill said nothing, {{probably}} {{because he was}} more than a trifle stirred. He knew that it requires self-restraint and courage <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that one's efforts have been thrown away, but there are men like him who now and then shrink from expressing their sympathy. Leaning forward a little with the rifle across his knees he set himself to listen.|$|E
50|$|This was {{the third}} strike for the Mark 14 torpedo. It started with the USS Sargo missing 13 of 13 easy shots in December 1941. Finally on 20 June 1942, Admiral Lockwood, the Commander of Submarines South West Pacific (COMSUBSOWESPAC), {{arranged}} to have torpedoes - with special non-exploding warheads (but unlike the exercise heads of that time and later they were filled to make them just as heavy as the actually explosive-filled warheads) - shot at fishnets. They were set to run at 10 ft. 850 yd away {{they went through the}} nets at 25 ft depth. The Bureau of Ordnance (BUORD) wouldnt accept this until they were forced <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> and conduct their own experiment. They confirmed Lockwoods experiments on 1 August.|$|R
5000|$|The First Symphony forced Tchaikovsky <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> in {{one very}} {{important}} way. Before beginning it, {{he had been}} content to mould his music {{as best he could}} to the practice of previous composers. Winter Dreams forced him to realize he would have to work [...] "around the rules" [...] for him to grow and develop as a composer. This meant adapting sonata form and symphonic structure to accommodate the music he was gifted to write. He would often show tremendous resourcefulness in doing this, even in this symphony. As musicologist David Brown wrote, [...] "The opening stretch of the first movement is enough to scotch the hoary old legend that Tchaikovsky was devoid of any real symphonic aptitude." ...|$|R

60|$|Peter took {{himself into}} quite places and trained himself <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that another {{would be more}} to her {{than he had ever}} been, and Clodd went about his work like a bear with a sore head; but they neither of them need have troubled {{themselves}} so much. The marriage did not take place till nearly fifteen years had passed away, and much water had to flow beneath old London Bridge before that day.|$|E
60|$|Just the same, {{she wished}} she had not made that swift glance at Dick. She was {{conscious}} of a feeling of guilt, and the thought of it hurt her as she watched the two big men, of a size and blondness, go down the room side by side. Of what had she been guilty? she asked herself. Why should she have anything to hide? Yet she was honest enough <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> and accept, without quibble, that she had something to hide. And her cheeks burned at the thought that she was being drifted into deception.|$|E
60|$|Kitty, who longed chiefly {{to get the}} {{situation}} more distinctly before herself, gave no heed to this confession, but went on to rehearse the whole affair.

60|$|I {{suppose the}} life of celibacy which the active, well-fed, well-exercised and imaginatively stirred young man of the educated classes is {{supposed}} to lead {{from the age of}} nineteen or twenty, when Nature certainly meant him to marry, to thirty or more, when civilisation permits him to do so, is the most impossible thing in the world. We deal here with facts that are kept secret and obscure, but I doubt for my own part if more than one man out of five in our class satisfies that ideal demand. The rest are even as I was, and Hatherleigh and Esmeer and all the men I knew. I draw no lessons and offer no panacea; I have to tell the quality of life, and this is how it is. This is how it will remain until men and women have <b>the</b> courage <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> of life.|$|R
60|$|So it {{was with}} that Inductive Physical Science, which helped more than all {{to break up the}} superstitions of the Ancien Regime, and <b>to</b> set man <b>face</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> with <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> of <b>the</b> universe. From England, {{towards the end of the}} seventeenth century, it was promulgated by such men as Newton, Boyle, Sydenham, Ray, and the first founders of our Royal Society.|$|R
60|$|They had {{now been}} six months married, {{and if he}} had allowed himself <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> he must have owned that, though they loved each other so truly, and he had known moments of exquisite, of {{incredible}} rapture, he had been as little happy as in any half-year he had lived. He never formulated his wife's character, or defined the precise relation she bore to his life; if he could have been challenged to do so, he would have said that she was the whole of life to him, and that she was the most delightful woman in the world.|$|E
60|$|I {{eyed him}} sourly, as he droned on about 'reactionable endowment', 'surrender-value', and 'interest accumulating on the tontine policy', and tried, as I did so, to analyse the loathing I felt for him. I {{came to the}} {{conclusion}} that it was partly due to his pose of doing the whole thing from purely altruistic motives, entirely for my good, and partly because he forced me <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that I was not always going to be young. In an abstract fashion I had already realized that I should in time cease to be thirty, but the way in which Glossop spoke of my sixty-fifth birthday made me feel as if it was due tomorrow. He was a man with a manner suggestive of a funeral mute suffering from suppressed jaundice, and I had never before been so weighed down with a sense of the inevitability of decay and the remorseless passage of time. I could feel my hair whitening.|$|E
60|$|By and by, with {{a little}} shiver and a {{suppressed}} sigh, she {{glanced up at the}} highest part of the climbing wood. It was there she had had her last memorable interview with Geoffrey, almost a year ago. Though she had not cared <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact,</b> she was troubled by a suspicion that she had made an unwise choice then. Leslie had changed since their marriage. He was harsh at times, and though he had, even in their more humble quarters, surrounded her {{with a certain amount of}} luxury, there was a laxity in his manners and conversation that jarred upon her. Geoffrey, she remembered, had not been addicted to mincing words, but, at least, he had lived in accordance with a Spartan moral code. Millicent was not a scrupulous woman, and her ideas of ethical justice were rudimentary, but she possessed in place of a conscience a delicate sense of refinement which her husband frequently offended.|$|E

50|$|The Earth players start anticipating their opponents' {{tricks and}} {{countering}} them {{without breaking the}} rules; the spectators are thrilled by this unexpected turn of events, and the Home Team actually enjoys having a genuine challenge <b>to</b> <b>face</b> despite <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that <b>the</b> Earthlings are now winning.

6000|$|Closely {{connected}} with the recommendations of constitutional reform was the question by whom the necessary communications with the assembly were to be conducted. Sir John Young was obviously impossible, though he was not at once brought <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact.</b> Mr. Gladstone upon this made to the colonial secretary (December 27) an offer {{that if he had}} already determined on Young's recall, and if he thought reform would stand a better chance if introduced by Mr. Gladstone himself, he was willing to serve as lord high commissioner for the very limited time that might be necessary. We may be sure that the government lost not an hour in making up their minds on a plan that went still further both in the way of bringing Mr. Gladstone into still closer connection with them, and towards relieving themselves of a responsibility which they never from the first had any business to devolve upon Mr. Gladstone or anybody else. The answer came by telegraph (January 11), 'The Queen accepts. Your commission is being made out.' ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{a relief}} when {{somebody}} took his plate away, and he went out with a cigar he did not remember lighting into the cool night air and flung himself down in {{a seat on the}} terrace. There was no moon in the sky, but the stars were clear, and—for the night was still—a chilly dampness settled on everything. He felt it pleasantly cold upon his skin, and lay still huddled limply in the garden chair, trying to realize the position, but found the attempt almost useless, for his thoughts had no cohesion. It was, however, evident that the love of the woman he desired could never be his. She had given him her promise, and he fancied that if he insisted she would redeem it, for he vaguely understood her sense of responsibility; but it was evident that he could not insist, and with the courage of desperation he nerved himself <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that he must let her go. He could think of nothing else, for he was still bewildered by the blow, and could only realize what had been taken from him.|$|E
6000|$|Then it {{came over}} {{me that she had}} made a great effort for me--made it with a kind of nobleness--and that I owed her a compensation. Each time I saw her after this I {{wondered}} what the compensation could be. I couldn't go on doing the wrong thing to oblige them. Oh it WAS the wrong thing, the stamp of the work for which they sat--Hawley was not the only person to say it now. I sent in a large number of the drawings I had made for [...] "Rutland Ramsay," [...] and I received a warning that was more to the point than Hawley's. The artistic adviser of the house for which I was working was of opinion that many of my illustrations were not what had been looked for. Most of these illustrations were the subjects in which the Monarchs had figured. Without going into the question of what HAD been looked for, I had <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> that at this rate I shouldn't get the other books to do. I hurled myself in despair on Miss Churm--I put her through all her paces. I not only adopted Oronte publicly as my hero, but one morning when the Major looked in to see if I didn't require him to finish a CHEAPSIDE figure for which he had begun to sit the week before, I told him I had changed my mind--I'd do the drawing from my man. At this my visitor turned pale and stood looking at me. [...] "Is HE your idea of an English gentleman?" [...] he asked.|$|E
50|$|The episode's title, {{which refers}} to April's braveness <b>to</b> <b>face</b> Corakinus and <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> they share <b>the</b> same heart, is also a {{reference}} to Mel Gibson's 1995 film Braveheart. The episode was positively received by critics, who praised its acting and character development.|$|R

50|$|The climax {{came when}} Harold told Vita that Violet had been unfaithful to her (with Denys). Violet {{tried to explain}} and assured Vita of her innocence (which was in all {{likelihood}} true). Vita was much too angry and upset to listen, and fled saying she couldn't bear to see Violet {{for at least two}} months. Six weeks later Vita returned to France to meet Violet. Mrs Keppel desperately tried to keep the scandal away from London, where Violet's sister, Sonia, was about to be married (to Roland Cubitt). Violet spent much of 1920 abroad, clinging desperately to Vita via continuous letters. In January 1921, Vita and Violet made a final journey to France, where they spent six weeks together. At this time, Harold threatened to break off the marriage if Vita continued her escapades. When Vita returned to England in March, it was practically the end of the affair. Violet was sent to Italy; and, from there she wrote her last desperate letters to their mutual friend Pat Dansey, having been forbidden from writing directly to Vita. At the end of the year, Violet had <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> and start <b>to</b> build her life from scratch.|$|R
