5|$|Bonaparte {{sought to}} invade Egypt as <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{campaign}} against British India, {{part of a}} greater effort to drive Britain out of the French Revolutionary Wars. As Bonaparte's fleet crossed the Mediterranean, it was pursued by a British force under Nelson who had been sent from the British fleet in the Tagus to learn {{the purpose of the}} French expedition and to defeat it. He chased the French for more than two months, on several occasions only missing them by a matter of hours. Bonaparte was aware of Nelson's pursuit and enforced absolute secrecy about his destination. He was able to capture Malta and then land in Egypt without interception by the British naval forces.|$|E
5|$|In {{preparation}} for the restoration work, the structural and architectural engineering firm Wiss, Janney, Elstner Associates completed {{an evaluation of the}} building's eastern and southern facades, focusing on its terra cotta portions. By using ultrasonic testing, engineers were able to evaluate the state of the terra cotta without further damaging the pieces. Severely cracked or damaged pieces were partially removed and a report was written from these findings. This report provided recommendations for the masonry facade and terra cotta repair work. Restoration work began in spring 2009 and is scheduled for completion in early 2010. All of the damaged terra cotta elements have been replaced on the south tower and parapet, and scaffolding has been erected on building's eastern facade in {{preparation for}} further restoration work. Fully restoring the building's exterior terra cotta pieces and clay roof tiles is <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> long-range $2million repair plan.|$|E

5|$|Several months previously, Texians {{had driven}} all Mexican {{troops out of}} Mexican Texas. About 100Texians were then garrisoned at the Alamo. The Texian force grew {{slightly}} {{with the arrival of}} reinforcements led by eventual Alamo co-commanders James Bowie and William B. Travis. On February 23, approximately 1,500 Mexicans marched into San Antonio de Béxar as <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> campaign to retake Texas. For the next 10 days, the two armies engaged in several skirmishes with minimal casualties. Aware that his garrison could not withstand an attack by such a large force, Travis wrote multiple letters pleading for more men and supplies, but the Texians were reinforced by fewer than 100 men.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of the physical representation of heredity came along with evolutionary principles and population genetics. In the 1940s and early 1950s, experiments pointed to DNA as the component of chromosomes that held the trait-carrying units that had become known as genes. A focus on new kinds of model organisms such as viruses and bacteria, along with the {{discovery of}} the double helical structure of DNA in 1953, marked the transition to the era of molecular genetics. From the 1950s to present times, biology has been vastly extended in the molecular domain. The genetic code was cracked by Har Gobind Khorana, Robert W. Holley and Marshall Warren Nirenberg after DNA was understood to contain codons. Finally, the Human Genome Project was launched in 1990 with the goal of mapping the general human genome. This project was essentially completed in 2003, with further analysis still being published. The Human Genome Project was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> globalized effort to incorporate accumulated knowledge of biology into a functional, molecular definition of the human body and the bodies of other organisms.|$|E
5|$|When Harith {{arrived at}} Marw in early July 745, however, the {{situation}} had changed: Yazid was dead, a full-blown civil war had erupted in Syria, and Nasr ibn Sayyar, although still occupying the position of governor, lacked authority. Although he recognized Marwan II (r. 744–750), most of his own followers did not accept Marwan as Caliph. Harith was quick {{to distance himself from}} Nasr: he refused the offer of a district governorship, and distributed the gifts he received among his supporters. Harith vocally denounced Marwan II, and was soon joined by 3,000 of his fellow Tamimis, while his secretary, Jahm ibn Safwan, drummed up further support. Within a short time, he had become a graver threat to Nasr than al-Kirmani. After attempts to negotiate an agreement proved fruitless, Nasr attacked Harith's forces in March 746, and scored a first victory over them, in which Jahm ibn Safwan fell. At this point, al-Kirmani joined forces with Harith, and together they forced Nasr to abandon Marw and withdraw to Naysabur. The two allies entered the capital of Khurasan, but within days fell out and began fighting each other. In these clashes, Harith was killed, leaving al-Kirmani the master of the city. The conflict between Nasr and al-Kirmani continued, but was soon overtaken by events: exploiting the conditions of civil war, the Abbasids under Abu Muslim launched their own anti-Umayyad revolt in Khurasan. Nasr ibn Sayyar tried to conclude an alliance with al-Kirmani, but failed when the latter was murdered by one of Harith's sons in revenge. Abu Muslim managed to exploit the situation to his advantage, and in early 748, his men entered Marw, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> war that would lead to the fall of the Umayyad dynasty and its replacement with the Abbasids two years later.|$|E

25|$|In mid-December 1979, the Fort Wayne Journal Gazette quoted an {{internal}} International Harvester memorandum (written in January 1979) {{in which the}} company appeared to advocate manufacturing plant decentralization {{as part of a}} plan to break the union. The memo specifically mentioned a new IH plant to be built in Wagoner, Oklahoma (a right-to-work state) which would eliminate unionized jobs at the company's Fort Wayne plant. The memo said the Wagoner plant was only <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> scheme to slowly dismantle the Fort Wayne plant. The memo outraged the union, which felt the company had intended to bargain in bad faith over its contract extension proposal.|$|E
25|$|After {{graduation}} from Princeton, Madison {{became interested in}} the relationship between the American colonies and Great Britain, which deteriorated over the issue of British taxation.

This was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> life of public service that his family's wealth facilitated. In October 1775, {{at the start of the}} American Revolutionary War, he was commissioned as the colonel of the Orange County militia, serving as his father's second-in-command until his election as a delegate to the Fifth Virginia Convention, which produced Virginia's first constitution.|$|E

25|$|Militants {{published}} a newspaper, The Waterfront Worker, {{which focused on}} longshoremen's most pressing demands: more men on each gang, lighter loads and an independent union. While {{a number of the}} individuals in this group were Communist Party members, the group as a whole was independent of the party: although it criticized the International Seamen's Union (ISU) as weak and the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA), which had its base on the East Coast, as corrupt, it did not embrace the MWIU, but called instead for creation of small knots of activists at each port to serve as <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> slow, careful movement to unionize the industry.|$|E

After the war, the College grew, albeit constrained {{by the rest of}} the People's Palace to the west and a burial ground immediately to the east. In 1920 it obtained both the Palace's Rotunda (now the Octagon) and rooms under the winter gardens at the west of the palace, which became chemical laboratories. The College's status was also unique, being the only School of the University of London that was subject to both the Charity Commissioners and the Board of Education.|$|E
25|$|The Normans invaded Ireland in two stages. Dermot McMurrough {{invited a}} small number of Norman knights led by Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke in 1169 to help in a local war, and they were rewarded with grants of land. Fearing that they might create an {{autonomous}} power, Henry II landed with a much larger force in 1171. In November 1171 Henry accepted the fealty of the Dublin Vikings, the Gaelic kings and the Norman knights. Henry's action was approved by Pope Alexander III and the Synod of Cashel met in 1172.

25|$|During the Imperial era, priesthood of the Imperial cult offered provincial elites full Roman {{citizenship}} and public prominence beyond their single year in religious office; in effect, it was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> provincial cursus honorum. In Rome, the same Imperial cult role {{was performed by}} the Arval Brethren, once an obscure Republican priesthood dedicated to several deities, then co-opted by Augustus {{as part of his}} religious reforms. The Arvals offered prayer and sacrifice to Roman state gods at various temples for the continued welfare of the Imperial family on their birthdays, accession anniversaries and to mark extraordinary events such as the quashing of conspiracy or revolt. Every January 3 they consecrated the annual vows and rendered any sacrifice promised in the previous year, provided the gods had kept the Imperial family safe for the contracted time.|$|E
25|$|Despite its efforts, the Chester Police Department {{still has}} a {{strained}} relationship with its citizens {{which led to a}} probe in May 2016 and the hope was that it would change the relationship between the department and the community. The probe follows a March 2016 shootout that saw the department claiming the suspects fired first, but the residents of the area where the incident took place believed the police fired first. In June, the United States Department of Justice came to Chester to hear the concerns of the citizens and it heavily criticized the department, pointing out deficiencies within the department. The community gathered in the Widener University auditorium where incidents of illegal stop and frisk encounters, the lack of Spanish speaking members of the department, and police brutality were discussed. This was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> 6-month program organized by the Department of Justice's Office of Community Policing.

25|$|In the 1860 presidential election, Republicans, led by Abraham Lincoln, {{supported}} banning {{slavery in}} all the U.S. territories. The Southern states viewed this {{as a violation of}} their constitutional rights and as <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> grander Republican plan to eventually abolish slavery. The three pro-Union candidates together received an overwhelming 82% majority of the votes cast nationally: Republican Lincoln's votes centered in the north, Democrat Stephen A. Douglas' votes were distributed nationally and Constitutional Unionist John Bell's votes centered in Tennessee, Kentucky, and Virginia. The Republican Party, dominant in the North, secured a plurality of the popular votes and a majority of the electoral votes nationally, so Lincoln was constitutionally elected president. He was the first Republican Party candidate to win the presidency. However, before his inauguration, seven slave states with cotton-based economies declared secession and formed the Confederacy. The first six to declare secession had the highest proportions of slaves in their populations, a total of 49 percent. The first seven with state legislatures to resolve for secession included split majorities for unionists Douglas and Bell in Georgia with 51% and Louisiana with 55%. Alabama had voted 46% for those unionists, Mississippi with 40%, Florida with 38%, Texas with 25%, and South Carolina cast Electoral College votes without a popular vote for president. Of these, only Texas held a referendum on secession.|$|E
500|$|Despite these limitations, {{the vehicle}} {{was seen as}} only <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>step</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> series of {{increasingly}} ambitious electrical cars. Sinclair intended it to prove the viability of electric personal transport; the hope was that, just as Sinclair had found with home computers like the hugely successful ZX81 and ZX Spectrum, an affordable electric vehicle could unleash pent-up demand for a market that did not previously exist. However, Sinclair performed no market research to ascertain whether there was actually a market for his electric vehicle; {{as the director of}} the Primary Contact advertising agency commented in January 1985, the project continued all the way to the prototype stage [...] "purely on the convictions of Sir Clive".|$|E

While the couple discuss their relationship, Saddam interrupts and takes them hostage, with Celine having planned to sing at a Canadian football game. Scott has also become worried about the presence of the Iraqi soldiers in Canada, but becomes infuriated when he finds that Terrance and Phillip have returned to Canada safely.
