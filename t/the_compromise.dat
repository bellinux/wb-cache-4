5|$|Vice-President Millard Fillmore {{ascended to}} the {{presidency}} upon Taylor's death and offered Crittenden the post of Attorney General. Believing the rift in the Whig Party was now much improved, he accepted the offer and resigned the governorship in 1850. Fillmore, an opponent of slavery, requested an opinion from Crittenden on {{the constitutionality of the}} fugitive slave law, one of the bills involved in <b>the</b> <b>Compromise</b> of 1850. Specifically, he asked if the law suspended the writ of habeas corpus. Crittenden said that it did not, opining that it discharged a duty placed on Congress by the Constitution to return runaway slaves. Crittenden's opinion was probably motivated by a desire to see <b>the</b> <b>Compromise</b> pass and avert further sectional tension. Fillmore, his misgivings assuaged, signed the bill, keeping <b>the</b> <b>Compromise</b> intact.|$|E
5|$|What was {{ultimately}} {{included in the}} constitution was a modified form of this plan. In the Grand Committee, Benjamin Franklin successfully proposed the requirement that revenue bills originate in the house. But the final July 16 vote on <b>the</b> <b>compromise</b> still left the Senate looking like the Confederation Congress. In the preceding weeks of debate, Madison, King, and Gouverneur Morris each vigorously opposed <b>the</b> <b>compromise</b> for this reason. Then on July 23, just before most of the convention's work was referred to the Committee of Detail, Morris and King moved that state representatives in the Senate be given individual votes, rather than voting en bloc, as {{they had in the}} Confederation Congress. Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut, a leading proponent of <b>the</b> <b>compromise,</b> supported their motion, and the Convention adopted it. As the personally powerful senators were to receive terms much longer than the state legislators who appointed them, they became substantially independent. <b>The</b> <b>compromise</b> nonetheless continued to serve the self-interest of small-state political leaders, who were assured of access to more seats in the Senate than they might otherwise have obtained.|$|E
30|$|This {{approach}} will not secure {{the rest of}} our cloud environment, but it avoids forwarding new requests to <b>the</b> <b>compromised</b> node. However, this drawback can be seen as an opportunity. We can apply this approach and also move <b>the</b> <b>compromised</b> node to a HoneyCloud. In the HoneyCloud we don’t restrict <b>the</b> <b>compromised</b> node, but instead analyze the attack and the attacker’s behavior. But even by moving <b>the</b> <b>compromised</b> node to a HoneyCloud, hosted instances on that node are still in danger. It is possible that consumers’ instances are all interconnected. Thus, those running instances on <b>the</b> <b>compromised</b> node in <b>the</b> HoneyCloud could threaten the rest of the consumers’ instances. The rest of the instances may even be hosted on a secure worker node. The next proposed approach is a solution for this issue.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a practical means of measuring information assurance for mobile agent systems operating on wireless, ad hoc networks based on meta-reasoning [Dix et al., 2000; Xuan et al., 2001] {{to improve the}} security of communication. Figure 1 shows an agent system and its two distinct layers of communication: host-to-host and agent-toagent. Given {{the plethora of new}} techniques for identifying network intruders, we study <b>the</b> <b>compromised</b> host problem: determining the appropriate response to an identified intruder. In the context of a mobile, multi-agent system operating on an ad hoc network [Forman & Zahorjan, 1994], it is not merely a simple matter of removing <b>the</b> <b>compromised</b> hosts and its agents. While keeping <b>the</b> <b>compromised</b> host can result in information disclosure, removal of the host can degrade or even sever the network. We develop a state description for an agent system and introduce a measure of information assurance for the system in terms of the integrity of the messages delivered to the agents in a given network state. Agents have three responses to a <b>compromised</b> host: ignore <b>the</b> <b>compromised</b> host; reroute around <b>the</b> <b>compromised</b> host using network route redundancies; or remove <b>the</b> <b>compromised</b> host, by having the agents instruct their hosts to eliminate it from the network. These responses are shown in Figure...|$|R

5|$|Despite treatment, Taylor died at 10:35p.m. on July 9, 1850. He was 65 years old. After his death, Vice President Fillmore {{assumed the}} {{presidency}} and completed Taylor's term, which ended on March 4, 1853. Soon after taking office, Fillmore signed into law <b>the</b> <b>Compromise</b> of 1850, which settled {{many of the issues}} faced by the Taylor administration.|$|E
5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1836, Congress {{proposed}} a compromise whereby Michigan gave up its claim to the strip in exchange for its statehood and approximately three-quarters of the Upper Peninsula. <b>The</b> <b>compromise</b> was considered a poor outcome for Michigan.

Confirming the fears of pro-slavery Alexandrians, <b>the</b> <b>Compromise</b> of 1850 outlawed the slave trade in the District, although not slavery itself.|$|E
5|$|A {{longtime}} {{supporter of}} national infrastructure development, Fillmore signed bills {{to subsidize the}} Illinois Central railroad from Chicago to Mobile, and for a canal at Sault Ste. Marie. The 1851 completion of the Erie Railroad in New York prompted Fillmore and his cabinet to ride the first train from New York City to the shores of Lake Erie, in company with many other politicians and dignitaries. Fillmore made many speeches along {{the way from the}} train's rear platform, urging acceptance of <b>the</b> <b>Compromise,</b> and afterwards went on a tour of New England with his Southern cabinet members. Although Fillmore urged Congress to authorize a transcontinental railroad, it did not do so until a decade later.|$|E

5|$|A related {{theme is}} the moral compromises {{individuals}} make in order to succeed in immoral political systems. In an interview about Taking Sides, Szabó said, “I don't think that life is possible without making compromises. The question {{is only one of}} limits: how far to go. When one crosses the line, then <b>the</b> <b>compromise</b> starts to be a bad, even deadly, one.” This theme is dominant in the Brandauer trilogy and, as Istvan Deak points out, may be related to Szabó’s own collaboration with the Communist secret police.|$|E
5|$|After {{almost six}} months of wrangling, the {{question}} of apportionment was brought up for a vote. <b>The</b> <b>compromise</b> was to apportion the House of Delegates on the white population basis, giving the western counties a majority, but for the Senate to be apportioned on a modified mixed basis of population and property including slaves, giving the eastern counties a majority. In the remaining two months of the Convention, it was agreed to allow direct popular election of the governor, but each office holder {{would be limited to}} one term. Constitutional provision for public education was voted down. Voting by secret ballot was rejected, perpetuating viva voce voting.|$|E
5|$|After {{losing the}} {{election}} to Abraham Lincoln, Breckinridge worked for adoption of the Crittenden Compromise—authored by fellow Kentuckian John J. Crittenden—as a means of preserving the Union. Breckinridge believed the Crittenden proposal—restoring the Missouri Compromise line as the separator between slave and free territory in exchange for stricter enforcement of the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 and federal non-interference with slavery in the territories and Washington, D.C.—was the most extreme proposal to which the South would agree. Ultimately, <b>the</b> <b>compromise</b> was rejected and the Civil War soon followed.|$|E

5|$|Around {{the same}} time, Sherman {{began to take}} {{a larger role in}} politics. In 1844, he {{addressed}} a political rally on behalf of the Whig candidate for president that year, Henry Clay. Four years later, Sherman was a delegate to the Whig National Convention where the eventual winner Zachary Taylor was nominated. As with most conservative Whigs, Sherman supported <b>the</b> <b>Compromise</b> of 1850 as the best solution to the growing sectional divide. In 1852, Sherman was again a delegate to the Whig National Convention, where he supported the eventual nominee, Winfield Scott, against rivals Daniel Webster and incumbent Millard Fillmore, who had become president following Taylor's death.|$|E
5|$|As President, Taylor {{kept his}} {{distance}} from Congress and his cabinet, even as partisan tensions threatened {{to divide the}} Union. Debate over the status of slavery in the Mexican Cession dominated the political agenda and led to threats of secession from Southerners. Despite being a Southerner and a slaveholder himself, Taylor did not push {{for the expansion of}} slavery, and he sought sectional harmony above all other concerns. To avoid the issue of slavery, he urged settlers in New Mexico and California to bypass the territorial stage and draft constitutions for statehood, setting the stage for <b>the</b> <b>Compromise</b> of 1850.|$|E
5|$|Congressional {{delegations}} {{from the}} Southern states, which had lower or no debts, and whose citizens would effectively pay {{a portion of}} the debt of other states if the federal government assumed it, were disinclined to accept the proposal. Additionally, many in Congress argued that the plan was beyond the constitutional power of the new government. James Madison led the effort to block the provision and prevent the plan from gaining approval. Jefferson approved payment of the domestic and foreign debt at par, but not the assumption of state debts. After Hamilton and Jefferson reached <b>the</b> <b>Compromise</b> of 1790, Hamilton's assumption plan was adopted as the Funding Act of 1790.|$|E
