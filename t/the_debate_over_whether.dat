The current version of the Act is known as Chapter 143 of the 1985 Revised Edition. In September 2011, <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> the ISA should be retained was re-opened after Malaysia {{announced that it was}} considering repealing the ISA.

5|$|Henry B. Payne (November 30, 1810September 9, 1896) was an American {{politician}} from Ohio. Moving to Ohio {{from his}} native New York in 1833, he quickly established himself in law and business while becoming a local leader in Democratic politics. After serving in the Ohio Senate, Payne was elected to a single term in the United States House of Representatives in 1874. In the House, he worked unsuccessfully for a compromise in <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> all of the nation's currency should be backed by gold. He was defeated for reelection, but served on the Electoral Commission that convened in early 1877 to resolve the dispute over {{the results of the}} 1876 presidential election. He ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1880, but lost to Winfield Scott Hancock, who would go on to lose the general election to James A. Garfield. He was elected to the United States Senate in 1884. His election by the Ohio legislature was tainted with charges of bribery, but after investigation by the Senate, Payne was permitted to keep his seat. In the Senate, he voted for moderate tariff reforms and against the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887, but was otherwise a reliable Democratic vote. He did not run for reelection, and died in 1896.|$|E

25|$|By the mid-1970s, most governments had {{committed}} to de-institutionalization, and had started {{preparing for the}} wholesale movement of people into the general community, {{in line with the}} principles of normalization.

25|$|Unlike {{any other}} SF story {{up to that}} point it is {{essentially}} plotless, being in the main a speculative take on the work of the physicist Paul Dirac. Blish also pointed out that the presence of communications from the future, implicit in Dirac's treatment of positrons as electrons travelling backwards in time, has philosophical implications for <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> we have free will or the future is already determined. To Blish's surprise the story proved popular and even started a new subgenre of SF.|$|E

40|$|The {{trade-off}} {{between the}} short- and {{long-term effects of}} the deregulation of shopping hours {{must be taken into}} account by policy-makers when introducing new legislation. In this paper, we argue that while long-term efficiency gains can be expected from relaxed shopping hours in Canada, deregulation also involves short-term social costs and a potential short-term redistribution of social welfare among Canadians. These issues seem to have been neglected in <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> <b>the</b> provinces should permit Sunday shopping. This paper also presents empirical evidence on the immediate aftermath of deregulation in Quebec (July 8, 1990) in order to give policy-makers in the other provinces a better understanding of the risk of consumer disenchantment following deregulation. ...|$|R

He served in this capacity until 1905, when the new province of Alberta was created out of part of the Northwest Territories. Though in keeping with territorial custom Woolf had served as an independent in the territorial legislature, federally he was a Liberal, and in <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> Alberta's politics should be conducted on an independent basis or along party lines, he was a strong advocate of the latter option.|$|E
25|$|Gallatin's brief {{stint in}} the Senate was not without consequence. Gallatin had proven to be an {{effective}} opponent of Alexander Hamilton's financial policies, and the election controversy added to his fame. The dispute itself had important ramifications. At the time, the Senate held closed sessions. However, with the American Revolution only a decade ended, the senators were leery of anything which might hint that they intended to establish an aristocracy, so they opened up their chamber for the first time for <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> to unseat Gallatin. Soon after, open sessions became standard procedure for the Senate.|$|E
25|$|The GPRF {{laid the}} groundwork for a new {{constitutional}} order that resulted in the Fourth Republic, which saw spectacular economic growth (les Trente Glorieuses). France was one of the founding members of NATO (1949). France attempted to regain control of French Indochina but was defeated by the Viet Minh in 1954 at the climactic Battle of Dien Bien Phu. Only months later, France faced another anti-colonialist conflict in Algeria. Torture and illegal executions were perpetrated by both sides and <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> or not to keep control of Algeria, then home to over one million European settlers, wracked the country and nearly led to a coup and civil war.|$|E

25|$|Liberal Christians place less {{emphasis}} on miraculous events associated with the life of Jesus than on his teachings. The effort to remove superstitious elements from Christian faith dates to intellectual reformist Christians such as Erasmus and the Deists in the 15th–17th centuries. In the 19th century, self-identified liberal Christians sought to elevate Jesus' humane teachings as a standard for a world civilization freed from cultic traditions and traces of pagan belief in the supernatural. <b>The</b> <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> a belief in miracles was mere superstition or essential to accepting the divinity of Christ constituted a crisis within the 19th-century church, for which theological compromises were sought.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> {{to move to}} annual {{sessions}} is {{a long-standing}} battle in Oregon politics, but the voters have resisted the move from citizen legislators to professional lawmakers. Because Oregon's state budget is written in two-year increments and, there being no sales tax, state revenue is based largely on income taxes, it is often significantly over- or under-budget. Recent legislatures {{have had to be}} called into special session repeatedly to address revenue shortfalls resulting from economic downturns, bringing to a head the need for more frequent legislative sessions. Oregon Initiative 71, passed in 2010, mandates the legislature to begin meeting every year, for 160 days in odd-numbered years, and 35 days in even-numbered years.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, the Stone Store {{suffered}} the cumulative effects of adjacent traffic movements and {{the ravages of}} normal wear and tear. Costly remedial work was required and {{in the 21st century}} a bypass was constructed and opened on 23 June 2008, to divert traffic and protect the building for posterity. The old stone store bridge was completely removed {{in the second half of}} 2008. The reasons for removal of the original bridge are controversial, and there was a groundswell of protest from a number of local residents. The bridge was removed regardless and <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> this was the correct course of action has yet to be resolved in the minds of many residents. The building has been restored to its original state, but does not include the tower on the roof containing the clock removed from the chapel further up the hill, which was removed as a safety measure a long time ago.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>debates</b> <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> to {{have such}} a {{memorial}} and what form it should take extend back in the late 1980s, when a small group of private German citizens, led by a television journalist, Lea Rosh, and a historian, Eberhard Jäckel, neither of whom is Jewish, first began pressing for Germany to honor the six million Jews murdered in the Holocaust. Rosh soon emerged {{the driving force behind the}} memorial. In 1989, she founded a group to support its construction and to collect donations. With growing support, the Bundestag passed a resolution in favour of the project. On 25 June 1999, the German Federal Parliament decided to build the memorial designed by Peter Eisenman. A federal foundation (Foundation Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe) was consequently founded to run it.|$|R

500|$|The CBC {{carried the}} first {{national}} telecasts exclusively, but the CTV Television Network purchased rights to the 1962 game.

40|$|Few {{diseases}} {{have raised}} as many ethical questions as AIDS and HIV infection. In clinical medical care, AIDS has chal lenged physicians and nurses to re-examine {{the foundations of}} their commitments to their professions, to their patients and to society.

In health-care policy, it is commonly conjectured that AIDS may be the proverbial straw that breaks the back of the Amer ican health-care system. Both rationing of care and access to expensive therapies such as AZT are central issues.

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>debate</b> <b>over</b> <b>whether</b> {{concussion}} is {{a functional}} or structural phenomenon is ongoing. Structural {{damage has been}} found in the mildly traumatically injured brains of animals, {{but it is not clear}} whether these findings would apply to humans. Such changes in brain structure could be responsible for certain symptoms such as visual disturbances, but other sets of symptoms, especially those of a psychological nature, are more likely to be caused by reversible pathophysiological changes in cellular function that occur after concussion, such as alterations in neurons' biochemistry. These reversible changes could also explain why dysfunction is frequently temporary. A task force of head injury experts called the Concussion In Sport Group met in 2001 and decided that [...] "concussion may result in neuropathological changes but the acute clinical symptoms largely reflect a functional disturbance rather than structural injury." ...|$|E
