Over {{the next three}} to four years, milligram quantities of americium and microgram amounts of curium were accumulated that allowed production of isotopes of berkelium (Thomson, 1949) and californium (Thomson, 1950). Sizeable amounts of these elements were produced only in 1958 (Burris B. Cunningham and Stanley G. Thomson), and the first californium compound (0.3µg of CfOCl) was obtained only in 1960 by B. B.

40|$|Identification of single-particle {{states in}} the {{heaviest}} known nuclei is important because their energies {{can be used to}} test the single-particle potential in these high-Z elements. These states can be identified by studying the decay schemes of very heavy odd-mass nuclides. For neutrons, the heaviest odd-mass nuclide available in milliCurie quantities is the 20 -h {sup 255 }Fm and for protons the heaviest nuclide available is the 20 -d {sup 253 }Es. These two isotopes were obtained from the <b>Transplutonium</b> <b>Element</b> Production Program at Oak Ridge and their spectra were measured with high-resolution germanium spectrometers.

40|$|Berkelium (Bk) {{has been}} {{predicted}} {{to be the}} only <b>transplutonium</b> <b>element</b> able to exhibit both +III and +IV oxidation states in solution, but evidence of a stable oxidized Bk chelate has so far remained elusive. Here we describe the stabilization of the heaviest 4 + ion of the periodic table, under mild aqueous conditions, using a siderophore derivative. The resulting Bk(IV) complex exhibits luminescence via sensitization through an intramolecular antenna effect. This neutral Bk(IV) coordination compound is not sequestered by the protein siderocalin - a mammalian metal transporter - in contrast to the negatively charged species obtained with neighbouring trivalent actinides americium, curium and californium (Cf). The corresponding Cf(III) -ligand-protein ternary adduct was characterized by X-ray diffraction analysis. Combined with theoretical predictions, these data add significant insight to the field of transplutonium chemistry, and may lead to innovative Bk separation and purification processes...|$|E

Analysis of Doppler-broadened lineshapes corresponding to transitions from excited rotational states in neutron-rich Sr, Zr, Mo, Ru, and Pd fission fragments has enabled measurements of state lifetimes in these nuclei at nuclear spins of I∼ 10. Extracted transition quadrupole moments are compared with various recent theoretical approaches, as well as with measurements at lower spin, and an interpretation of the data is made within the context of prolate-oblate shape competition in this region. © 2012 American Physical Society.

5|$|Like the lanthanides, the {{actinides}} form {{a family}} of elements with similar properties. Within the actinides, there are two overlapping groups: transuranium elements, which follow uranium in the periodic table—and <b>transplutonium</b> <b>elements,</b> which follow plutonium. Compared to the lanthanides, which (except for promethium) are found in nature in appreciable quantities, most actinides are rare. The majority {{of them do not}} even occur in nature, and of those that do, only thorium and uranium do so in more than trace quantities. The most abundant, or easily synthesized actinides are uranium and thorium, followed by plutonium, americium, actinium, protactinium, neptunium, and curium.|$|R
40|$|In nuclear {{reactors}} plutonium and transplutonium isotopes {{are produced by}} multiple neutron capture of uranium and plutonium and are important for the energy production and their composition reflects the core burnout. Under normal operation these elements are not released to the environment in significant amounts. There are accordingly very few areas or source terms where exotic <b>transplutonium</b> <b>elements,</b> such as curium isotopes, can be studied in the environment. The Chernobyl accident provided a complex spectrum of fission and activation products in fallout while the relative amounts, compared to the core inventory, of refractory elements such as transuranium and <b>transplutonium</b> <b>elements</b> were small. The major alpha-activity consisted of Cm- 242 (T- 1 / 2 = 163 d) that would have decayed after a few years. In this study we have demonstrated the presence of so called "supported Cm- 242 " from the long-lived Am- 242 (m) (T- 1 / 2 = 141 a) in environmental samples, following fallout from the Chernobyl accident. It has also been possible to assess the core bum up by using the data obtained for the Cm isotopes. The curium isotopes Cm- 243 (T- 1 / 2 = 29. 1 a) and Cm- 244 (T- 1 / 2 = 18. 1 a) cannot be resolved by conventional alpha-spectrometry. The assessment of these isotopes in environmental samples contaminated from the Chernobyl accident has been made by studying the effective half-life {{of the mixture of}} the isotopes.

40|$|The crystal {{chemistry}} {{of a number}} of transuranic chalcogenides and pnictides has been investigated using 243 Am, 248 Cm, 249 Bk and 249 Cf. These compounds were prepared from the corresponding metals by direct reaction with the chalcogen or pnictogen element at elevated temperatures. Higher chalcogenides were thermally dissociated to yield ones of lower stoichiometry, terminating with the sesquichalcogenides; only monopnictides of these <b>transplutonium</b> <b>elements</b> were found. All products were examined by X-ray powder diffraction. In this paper the methods for preparing the actinide chalcogenides and pnictides on a gram scale are reviewed, and the microtechniques used for submilligram quantities of the transamericium elements are presented. The results obtained during this study are compared to data previously reported for the lighter actinide compounds, and the trends observed across the series are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Alpha {{spectrometry}} using {{liquid scintillation}} methods has matured into a technology showing great potential. The nonpenetrating properties shared by beta and alpha radiation make them both candidates for liquid scintillation counting/spectrometry. However, applying liquid scintilla-tion to alpha spectrometry has been difficult, because inefficient light production by alpha particles led to poor alpha energy resolution and alpha-produced scintillation interference of beta- and gamma-produced scintillations. Recent developments in alpha liquid scintillation spectrometers and pulse-shape discrimination have removed the beta-gamma interference problem and greatly improved alpha energy resolution. In addition, selective solvent (liquid-liquid) extraction methods (phase-transfers), setting the nuclide of interest into the scintillator, simplifies sample preparation and provides important additional information for nuclide identifi-cation. Such rapid, selective procedures {{have been developed}} for radium, uranium, thorium, plutonium, polonium, and the trivalent <b>transplutonium</b> <b>elements.</b> Presently, available energy resolution (230 keV FWHM) allows identification of many of the isotopes of these nuclides. Chemical separations methods and typical alpha-spectral results are presented in this chapter. Promising methods of improving both energy resolution and chemical separations are suggested...|$|R
40|$|The {{existing}} {{practice of}} management of high level waste (HLW) generated by NPPs, {{call for a}} task of selective separation {{of the most dangerous}} long-lived radionuclides with the purpose of their subsequent immobilization and disposal. HLW partitioning allows to reduce substantially the cost of vitrified product storage owing to isolation of the most dangerous radionuclides, such as <b>transplutonium</b> <b>elements</b> (TPE) into separate fractions of small volumes, intended for ultimate storage. By now numerous investigations on partitioning of HLW of various composition have been carried out in many countries and a lot of processes permitting to recover cesium, strontium, TPE and rare earth elements (REE) have been already tested. Apart from enumerated radionuclides, a fair quantity of palladium and rhodium presents in spent fuel, but the problem of these elements recovery has not yet been decided at the operating radiochemical plants. A negative effect of platinum group metals (PGM) occurrence is determined by the formation of separate metal phase, which not only worsens the conditions of glass-melting but also shortens considerably the service life of the equipment. At the same time, the exhaustion of PGMs natural resources may finally lead to such a growth of their costs that the spent nuclear fuel would became a substituting source of these elements industrial production. Allowing above mentioned, it is of interest to develop the technique for ''reactor'' palladium and rhodium recovery process which would be compatible with HLW partitioning and could be realized using the same facilities. In the report the data on platinum metals distribution in spent fuel reprocessing products and the several flowsheets for palladium separation from HLW are presented...|$|R
40|$|The High Flax lsotope Reactor (HFIR) {{is being}} planned for {{construction}} at Oak Ridge National Laboratory as a supporting {{facility in the}} program of investigation of {{the properties of the}} <b>transplutonium</b> <b>elements.</b> The reactor will be a flux-trap reactor consisting of a berylliumrefiected, light-water-cooled annular fuel region surroundin g a light-water island. An irradiation sample of 200 to 300 g of Pu/sup 242 / will be placed in the island where a thermalneutron flux of approximately 3 x 10 /sup 15 / n/cm/sup 2 //sec can be achieved on the average during an irradiation period of about 1 year. It is estimated that more than 100 mg of Cf/sup 252 / will be produced by such an irradiation. In addition to the central irradiation facility for heavy-element production, the HIKIR will have eight hydraulic rabbit tubes located in the beryllium refiector and four beam holes for basic research. Preliminary design of the reactor was {{based on the results of}} a parametric study of the dimensions of the island and fuel region, heat-removal rates, and fuel loading on the achievable thermal-neutron fluxes in the island and reflector. A research and development program ding critical experiments, heat transfer, corrosion, a clufuel element studies has been in progress to verify the important parameters used in the design. The present design results in an average power density of 2. 2 Mw/l in the active core and requires a maximum heat-transfer rate from fuel-plate surfaces of 1. 5 x 10 / sup 6 / Btu/ft/sup 2 //hr. This heattransfer rate is achieved by flowing H/sub 2 / O, at an inlet temperature of 120 F, and a pressure of 600 to 900 psig, through the 0. 05 -in. coolant channels at a velocity of 40 fps. A preliminary analysis of the hazards brought on by a reactor core meltdown shows that a controlled-leakage, filter-scrubber, stack release system of the ORR type will limit the consequences of such an accident to an acceptable degree. Construction is scheduled to start in early 1961 with operation at power scheduled for Jan. 1964. The estimated cost of the facility including engineering i...|$|R
40|$|Concerning {{condensed}} matter {{physics in}} uranium and transuranium compounds, {{the last decade has}} been full of surprises compared to the last half century. Indeed, these last 10 years have led to the discovery of a multitude of systems based of 5 f electrons with astonishing properties, especially {{from the point of view}} of interplay between magnetism and superconductivity. Ferromagnetic superconducting systems, predicted long time ago, have been observed experimentally, first under pressure, for UGe 2 and then at ambient pressure for URhGe and UCoGe, which are simultaneously superconducting (Tc = 0. 80, 0. 25 and 0. 22 K respectively) and ferromagnetic (TC= 52, 9. 5 and 2. 9 K, respectively). In the Transuranium systems, the first big shock came with the observation of superconductivity in PuCoGa 5 with a surprising Tc = 18. 6 K, one scale above all other heavy fermion superconductors based on 5 f electrons. This is still a record in all the f-electrons systems. Other systems based on Pu (PuRhGa 5, PuCoIn 5 and PuRhIn 5) or Np (NpPd 5 Al 2 (the only neptunium based superconductor) have been reported which can be related to other "known" classes of intermetallics systems such as heavy fermions superconductors with magnetic ground state. Up to now, only PuCoGa 5 remains definitely difficult to associate to one class. Numerous systems have been examined at ITU in the last decades also, based on the analogy of structure or properties of existing Rare Earths superconductor's counterparts. The last family explored being the " 1 - 1 - 1 - 1 " family, but as in the simple substitution cases such as NpRhGe or PuRhGe (for URhGe), none of these attempts have led to the discovery of new superconductors. From this point of view, only the " 1 - 1 - 5 " family with in particular PuCoGa 5 and recently, PuCoIn 5 (CeCoIn 5) and the " 1 - 5 - 2 " family with NpPd 5 Al 2 (CePd 5 Al 2) have shown superconductivity in both the rare-earth and Transuranium analogues. Future studies should be addressed to examine the basic properties of <b>transplutonium</b> <b>elements</b> such as Cm, Bk, and Cf as elements or as a part of compounds (alloys or oxides). These studies should be considered as a benefit to our basic knowledge and to the support to nuclear applications as these materials are present in irradiated fuels and constitute to the main problematic of nuclear wastes management.

40|$|Disposal of {{radioactive}} waste {{is a central}} problem and {{among the most important}} concerns of the nuclear fuel cycle. The Russian concept of nuclear fuel-cycle management is aimed at reprocessing spent fuel with the maximum, economically justified extraction of useful components for their recycling. The technology currently used in Russia for reprocessing spent nuclear fuel gives rise to liquid high- level waste (HLW) with minor concentrations of valuable components such as uranium (U) and plutonium (Pu) [1]. The liquid radioactive wastes formed in the course of reprocessing are converted into the solid forms suitable for the transportation, storage, and burial. Of special importance is management of high-level waste (HLW). Although various technological approaches underlying the processes for the solidification or immobilization of liquid HLW are used at the research institutes of the MINATOM RF [1 - 5], all these approaches have in common the idea of a strong bonding of radionuclides in the resulting solid matrices. Therefore, development of solidification technologies must include the mandatory stages of investigating the behavior of HLW components during the immobilization process and in the prepared solidified compositions and characterizing their properties under conditions for subsequent transportation, storage, and burial. An important technological area of exploration is study of the behavior of long-lived alpha radionuclides {{during the course of the}} vitrification process and the ultimate long-range influence of these radionuclides on the properties of the immobilized forms. For the most part, immobilization of alpha radionuclides, particularly plutonium, in vitreous compositions involves investigations on the properties of final materials and the effect of alpha-decay radiation on the synthesized solid compositions. Another direction of investigation is study on the behavior of plutonium and <b>transplutonium</b> <b>elements</b> upon vitrification of liquid HLW, as applied to the one-stage process for immobilizing HLW by using different types of melters. Such studies were carried out to forecast the behavior of the above radionuclides during long-term operation of the ceramic melter at the vitrification facility of PU `Mayak. ` The results of many investigations on the behavior of plutonium upon immobilization into phosphate and borosilicate vitreous compositions developed in Russia are generalized and summarized in the present work. In the conducted investigations of plutonium immobilization into both phosphate and borosilicate vitreous compositions used for the solidification of high-level liquid wastes upon vitrification in ceramic melters, 0272 plutonium exhibited a limited solubility in the studied glass matrices. The solubility of plutonium, using plutonium dioxide powders, in phosphate and borosilicate glasses of specifically studied compositions was limited to 0. 2 - 0. 4 wt %. The degree of incorporation (i. e., solubility) of plutonium, using plutonium in the form of nitrate solutions, in borosilicate glasses was also equal to 0. 2 - 0. 4 wt %. The degree of incorporation (i. e., solubility) of plutonium, using plutonium in the form of nitrate solutions, in phosphate glasses depended considerably on the chemical compositions of the solution to be solidified and on the specific glass matrix (i. e., on the composition of final solidified product) and was equal to 0. 4 - 1. 0 wt %. Available experimental data also allow one to assume that the use of the cold-crucible- induction melter (CCIM) method for immobilizing plutonium-containing wastes [6 - 8] provides a means of synthesizing the high-quality final solid-glass products with a plutonium content...|$|R
