He employed ten workers to maintain the [...] garden. Harrison commented on gardening {{as a form of}} escapism: [...] "Sometimes I feel like I'm actually on the wrong planet, and it's great when I'm in my garden, but the minute I go out the gate I think: 'What <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>am</b> I doing here?'" [...] His autobiography, I, Me, Mine, is dedicated [...] "to gardeners everywhere". The former Beatles publicist Derek Taylor helped Harrison write the book, which said little about the Beatles, focusing instead on Harrison's hobbies, music and lyrics. Taylor commented: [...] "George is not disowning the Beatles... but {{it was a long time}} ago and actually a short part of his life." ...|$|E
500|$|Lamb {{described}} the incident for Dolan in far more detail. He {{said that on}} 25 June he had finished his woodworking job at 15:00, refused to work overtime (having put in 62 hours that week), then drunk six beers at home during the afternoon and gone to sleep at 21:00. He woke up soon after, he said, and loaded his uncle's shotgun, intending to kill himself. [...] "Next thing I knew," [...] he continued, [...] "I was on the street." [...] He told Dolan {{that he had seen}} people [...] "as if they were on television". He heard the sound of a gun being fired as if it were coming from far away, and remembered a voice that was not his own saying [...] "Put up your hands". He then remembered hearing the dim, far-off gun again, a vision of a terrified man standing before him, then yet another shot. He told Dolan he remembered crossing the street, seeing a girl's outline in a doorway and [...] "somehow" [...] shooting at her. Lamb then said he had fired at a passing car, and that [...] "everything seemed unreal." [...] He said that the next thing he had memory of was confronting an elderly lady at a house nearby, suddenly thinking [...] "what <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>am</b> I in here for" [...] and leaving. He concluded his account by saying that he had hailed a cab from the corner of Pillette and Tecumseh Road and gone back to his uncle's house.|$|E
500|$|Leonard Nimoy as Spock Prime: Nimoy reprises {{the role}} of the older Spock from the {{original}} Star Trek timeline, credited as [...] "Spock Prime". He was a longtime friend of Abrams' parents, but became better acquainted with Abrams during filming. Although Quinto watched some episodes of the show during breaks in filming, Nimoy was his main resource in playing Spock. Abrams and the writers met Nimoy at his house; writer Roberto Orci recalled that the actor gave a Who are you guys and what are you up to?' vibe" [...] before being told how important he was to them. He was silent, and Nimoy's wife Susan Bay told the creative team he had remained in his chair after their conversation, emotionally overwhelmed by his decision after turning down many opportunities to revisit the role. Had Nimoy disliked the script, production would have been delayed for it to be rewritten. Nimoy later said, [...] "This is the first and only time I ever had a filmmaker say, 'We cannot make this film without you and we won't make it without you'". He was [...] "genuinely excited" [...] by the script's scope and its detailing of the characters' backstories, saying, [...] "We have dealt with , but never with quite the overview that this script has of the entire history of the character, the growth of the character, the beginnings of the character and the arrival of the character into the Enterprise crew." [...] Abrams commented, [...] "It was surreal to direct him as Spock, because what <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>am</b> I doing there? This guy has been doing it for forty years.

500|$|... "If U Seek Amy" [...] {{integrates}} [...] "glam-rave" [...] elements {{with traditional}} pop styles; it gained controversy for its double entendre, where the title sounds phonetically like [...] "F-U-C-K me". The electropop track [...] "Unusual You" [...] {{deals with a}} woman finding unexpected love. It {{has been compared to}} musical themes from the 1980s and 1990s, and has been noted as a [...] "pulsating ballad", with the song also drawing comparisons to the [...] "shimmering waterfall mood first popularized by Janet Jackson". [...] "Blur" [...] sees the inclusion of urban influences, and lyrically recalls the morning after a party with lyrics [...] "Can't remember what I did last night/I gotta get my head right, where <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>am</b> I? Who are you? What'd we do last night?"; it drew similarities to Spears's prior song [...] "Early Mornin". [...] "Mmm Papi" [...] draws elements from a 1960s go-go rock guitar and Latin-pop dance hall themes. Despite its [...] "fun" [...] nature, it was criticized for appearing to [...] "revisit the Lolita persona of [...] "…Baby One More Time". It has been suggested that its lyrics deal with either Spears's father Jamie or paparazzi Adnan Ghalib. [...] "Mannequin" [...] is a dance-pop song with a trip hop influence; while being noted for its [...] "risky" [...] and [...] "futuristic" [...] nature, it has also been suggested that Spears's vocals sounded [...] "lifeless". [...] "Lace and Leather" [...] gained comparisons to [...] "Control era Janet Jackson", Prince, and Vanity 6's works from the 1980s and featured a then-unknown Kesha as a backing vocalist. [...] "My Baby", described as having a [...] "faux-Janet Jackson vocal", was written by Spears about her two sons Sean Preston and Jayden James Federline, and closes the album.|$|E

A little way down the road he stopped to light a cigarette; and, leaning against a gate, drew the smoke of it deep into his lungs, trying to assuage the ache in his heart. So it was hopeless! She had taken the first, the very first chance, to get away from him! She knew that he loved her, could not help knowing, for he {{had never been able to}} keep it out of his eyes and voice. If she had felt ever so little for him, she would not have avoided him this first evening. 'I'll go back to that desert,' he thought; 'I'm not going to whine and crawl. I'll go back, and bite on it; one must have some pride. Oh, why <b>the</b> <b>hell</b> <b>am</b> I crocked-up like this? If only I could get out to France again!' And then Noel's figure bent over the falling corn formed before him. 'I'll have one more try,' he thought; 'one more--tomorrow somewhere, I'll get to know for certain. And if I get what Leila's got I shall deserve it, I suppose. Poor Leila! Where is she? Back at High Constantia?' What was that? A cry--of terror--in that wood! Crossing to the edge, he called [...] "Coo-ee!" [...] and stood peering into its darkness. He heard the sound of bushes being brushed aside, and whistled. A figure came {{bursting}} out, almost into his arms.|$|E
