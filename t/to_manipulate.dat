40|$|A {{study of}} 80 couples (mean age 24) {{examined}} {{the impact of}} attachment patterns on reactions <b>to</b> <b>manipulated</b> positive or negative feedback, ostensibly from partners. As expected, individuals high in attachment anxiety reported more negative mood and the least indifference to partner feedback. In addition, those high in attachment anxiety reported more negative reactions to negative feedback compared to those low in anxiety. Those high in attachment anxiety reported lower self-competence after receiving negative feedback than those low in anxiety. Further, reactions <b>to</b> <b>manipulated</b> feedback mediated the relationship between attachment anxiety and self-competence. Attachment models {{play a role in}} determining reactions to partner feedback and moderate how feedback is used to maintain self-views...|$|R

40|$|This study {{extended}} {{investigation of}} the nature of emotional manipulation by examining {{for the first time the}} predictors of ability <b>to</b> emotionally <b>manipulate</b> and predictors of willingness <b>to</b> emotionally <b>manipulate</b> romantic partners. Participants (N = 324; 200 females, 124 males) completed an online survey assessing emotional manipulation ability and willingness; Dark Triad traits; Machiavellianism, primary and secondary psychopathy, grandiose and vulnerable narcissism; sadism; and relationship satisfaction. Hypotheses received partial support. For females, higher levels of only grandiose narcissism significantly predicted self-reported emotional manipulation ability, while higher levels of primary psychopathy, grandiose and vulnerable narcissism, and lower relationship satisfaction significantly predicted willingness <b>to</b> emotionally <b>manipulate</b> romantic partner. For males, higher levels of only grandiose narcissism significantly predicted emotional manipulation ability, while higher levels of primary and secondary psychopathy, grandiose narcissism, and sadism positively predicted willingness <b>to</b> emotionally <b>manipulate</b> romantic partner. These findings confirm the distinction between ability <b>to</b> emotionally <b>manipulate</b> and willingness <b>to</b> emotionally <b>manipulate,</b> and inform understanding of the malicious and manipulative use of emotional manipulation within intimate relationships. Future research could utilise behavioural rather than self-report measure of emotional manipulation frequency and different types of romantic relationships (e. g., married) to further clarify the nature of emotional manipulation. It is hoped that findings from this study may help to inform practice in couples therapy...|$|R

5|$|Artificial {{selection}} is the intentional selection of traits {{in a population}} of organisms. This {{has been used for}} thousands of years in the domestication of plants and animals.
