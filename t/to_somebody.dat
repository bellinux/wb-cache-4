5|$|In early , Koufax asked Dodgers GM Buzzie Bavasi {{to trade}} {{him because he}} wasn't getting enough playing time. By the end of 1960, after going 8–13, Koufax was {{thinking}} about quitting baseball to devote himself to an electronics business that he'd invested in. After the last game of the season, he threw his gloves and spikes into the trash. Nobe Kawano, the clubhouse supervisor, retrieved the equipment to return to Koufax the following year (or <b>to</b> <b>somebody</b> else if Koufax {{did not return to}} play).|$|E
5|$|At 09:30 on 2 May, Oan {{appeared}} at the first-floor window of the embassy to demand access to the telex system, which the police had disabled along with the telephone lines, and threatened to kill Abdul Fazi Ezzati, the cultural attaché. The police refused and Oan pushed Ezzati, who he had been holding at gunpoint at the window, across the room, before demanding to speak <b>to</b> <b>somebody</b> from the BBC who knew Sim Harris. The police, relieved to have a demand to which they could easily agree, produced Tony Crabb, managing director of BBC Television News and Harris's boss. Oan shouted his demands—for safe passage out of the UK, to be negotiated by three ambassadors from Arab countries—to Crabb from the first-floor window, and instructed {{that they should be}} broadcast along with a statement of the hostage-takers' aims by the BBC. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office informally approached the embassies of Algeria, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Syria and Qatar to ask if their ambassadors would be willing to talk to the hostage-takers. The Jordanian ambassador immediately refused and the other five said they would consult their governments. The BBC broadcast the statement that evening, but in a form unsatisfactory to Oan, who considered it to be truncated and incorrect.|$|E

60|$|But Rollo, {{like all}} other boys who have not learned to work, was more {{inclined}} <b>to</b> get <b>somebody</b> <b>to</b> help him do what was beyond his own strength, than to go quietly on alone in doing what he himself was able to do.

5|$|In December 1483, Richard instituted what {{later became}} known as the Court of Requests, a court to which poor people who could not afford legal {{representation}} could apply for their grievances to be heard. He also improved bail in January 1484, to protect suspected felons from imprisonment before trial and to protect their property from seizure during that time. He founded the College of Arms in 1484, he banned restrictions on the printing and sale of books, and he ordered the translation of the written Laws and Statutes from the traditional French into English. He ended the arbitrary benevolences (a device by which Edward IV raised funds), made it punishable to conceal from a buyer of land that a part of the property had already been disposed of <b>to</b> <b>somebody</b> else, required that land sales be published, laid down property qualifications for jurors, restricted the abusive Courts of Piepowders, regulated cloth sales, instituted certain forms of trade protectionism, prohibited the sale of wine and oil in fraudulent measure, and prohibited fraudulent collection of clergy dues, among others. Churchill implies he improved the law of trusts.|$|E

25|$|Argentines in Israel are {{the largest}} {{immigrant}} group from Latin America {{and one of the}} fastest growing groups. The vast majority of Argentines in Israel are Jewish Argentines who make Aliyah but there is also an important group of non-Jewish Argentines, having, or being married <b>to</b> <b>somebody</b> who has, at least one Jewish grandparent, who choose Israel as their new home. There are about 50,000 Argentines residing in Israel although some estimates put the figure at 70,000.|$|E

One morning, somebody took the keys from Matt's car that the unknown female character got him, and stole the car. Matt has to follow the person and had to follow the driver. As it turns out, the driver that took the keys, was the unknown female character in his perspective. She later gives a case <b>to</b> <b>somebody</b> that knows her, and Matt is forced to leave the area without her.|$|E
25|$|At first Genie {{usually did}} {{not listen to}} anyone unless someone {{directly}} addressed her or if Curtiss played classical music on the piano, and if someone spoke to her she almost never acknowledged the other person and usually walked away after a while. In {{an effort to get}} Genie to listen to other people Curtiss began reading children's stories to her, and at first she did not seem to engage, but one day in mid-October 1971 Curtiss saw that Genie was clearly listening and responding to her. After that she paid attention to people even when they were not speaking directly to or about her. She became somewhat more sociable in her interactions with people and became somewhat more responsive, although she still frequently showed no obvious signs that she heard someone. Her reactions to most stimuli became more rapid, but even by the end of her stay she sometimes took several minutes before giving a response <b>to</b> <b>somebody.</b>|$|E

25|$|Early in {{the morning}} {{somebody}} wakens me, I open my eyes and that's when my roommate from the Mexico Olympic Games says, 'Get up, Monie was killed by Arab terrorists'. I knew him as a joker but that sounded too serious, so without thinking much, in my pyjamas, I went to the entrance door of the apartment, opened it and looked around. I have seen guards from the village and they were speaking <b>to</b> <b>somebody</b> that {{was standing in the}} entrance to apartment number one. I have noticed his dark skin and the hat and I listened, still without being afraid or thinking that something is very dangerous for me, and the guards are asking the permission to let the Red Cross enter apartment one and provide some aid to a wounded person and the man, he refuse. They said, 'Why should you be inhumane ?', and the man replied something like either, the Jews or the Israelis 'are not humane either.' At that point I understood that something is going on and I closed the door.|$|E
25|$|By November 1972 Genie {{could use}} the word on, {{although}} it was uncertain whether she distinguished between on and in and Curtiss wrote that all of Genie's earliest utterances containing on and in were answers <b>to</b> <b>somebody</b> asking her a question, and could correctly use the suffix -ing to describe events in the present progressive. These were the first grammatical markers in her speech, and both are normally two of the first grammatical markers young children can use. Her use of -ing on exclusively dynamic verbs also indicated to linguists that she categorized dynamic versus stative verbs, although she did not use it with the verb to be until the fall of 1973 and then only when speaking in first or third-person. Even after learning the present progressive she inconsistently gave correct responses to it on tests, {{and use of the}} suffix -ing was the only way Genie modified a sentence without changing any of the base words. Although Genie had gained some understanding of number words during her initial stay at Children's Hospital she only began to count in sequential order in late 1972, always in very deliberate and laborious manner, and her progress was extremely slow.|$|E

In other words, a Bernoulli process is a sequence of iid Bernoulli random variables, where each coin flip is a Bernoulli trial.|$|E
500|$|The term is {{frequently}} used in tabloid newspapers and {{people continue to}} use [...] "Hooray Henry" [...] to refer <b>to</b> <b>somebody</b> of the upper class even outside the UK, although it is most commonly used in British English slang. British tabloids and American newspapers such as The Huffington Post of New York City often use the term [...] "Toff" [...] or [...] "Hooray Henry" [...] to describe the elite of the British Conservative Party; a 2012 article for instance referred to British Prime Minister David Cameron and the Tories as [...] "Cameron and the Hooray Henry brigade".|$|E
500|$|Joshua Safran had {{initially}} envisioned Alex {{as the one}} of the protagonists of Quantico. When he was writing the character, his personal struggle with not knowing whether one of his family members was a pathological liar or involved with a government agency helped Safran build Alex's perception of her own family. Safran wrote his own experience into Alex's struggle to learn the truth about her father. He said [...] "I've always struggled with knowing that I would never know the truth, because there is no real such thing as the truth with regard <b>to</b> <b>somebody</b> {{who may or may not}} be telling the truth.
