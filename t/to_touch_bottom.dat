Mr. Robert Edwards, of Santa Cruz, recounted another native tradition--that before the eruption of A.D. 1705 there was a run of water but no cave. Mr. Addison was let down into it, and found three branches or lanes, the longest measuring 60-70 feet. What the neveros call el hombre de nieve (the snow-man) proved to be a honeycombed mass of lava revetted with ice-drippings. He judged the cave to be a crater of emission; and did not see the smoke or steam issuing from it as reported by the ice-collectors.|$|E

40|$|From {{what has}} been said {{concerning}} the neuromuscular organization of the Asterias ray, {{it is possible to}} arrive at certain definite conclusions regarding the nature of the stereotropism of that organ. The righting movements from the start are not haphazard; i. e., they cannot be explained on any hypothesis of "trial and error. " The excitation of the sensory cells of the dorsal sheath initiates dorsal flexure of the ray. This movement makes it possible for the tube feet of the tip <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>bottom</b> and start the vigorous action which follows and completes the righting If the "feelers" by chance touch bottom they initiate the reaction de novo. As to the remaining phases, the stereotropic reaction of the ray is referable to the high degree of surface sensitivity of the tube feet disks and the propagation of excitatory and inhibitory impulses, resulting from stimulation, along appropriate paths to the muscles of the ray. In this respect the tube feet may be regarded as playing a role similar to that of tropistic receptors in general. That is, unequal stimulation of the receptors causes a corresponding inequality of tone or of contraction in the musculature which ultimately results in an equilibrium of orientation to the factor involved. It is evident that as a mechanism for righting stereotropism differs in one important respect from other tropisms. The latter depend for their operation upon unilateral effects in organisms which are dynamically bilaterally symmetrical. In stereotropism the sensitivity of the organism is not distributed in bilaterally symmetrical fashion. As a rule only the ventral side is stereosensitive; i. e., the sensitivity is unilaterally distributed. There is a tropistic action in such cases {{because of the fact that}} when the sensitive surface is only partially stimulated an unequal contraction of the musculature follows and this as a result brings the sensitive surface into such a position that it is all equally stimulated. Equal muscle tone follows and the organism is in equilibrium with its environment...|$|E
40|$|O mergulho recreativo marinho é um dos serviços mais rentáveis dentre os explorados na zona costeira do município do Rio de Janeiro.  O estudo caracterizou e avaliou a percepção {{ambiental}} de mergulhadores recreativos e os possíveis impactos negativos que essa prática pode causar na zona costeira do município  e adjacências para subsidiar a otimização dessa atividade. Foram elaborados questionários específicos para a coleta de dados primários junto a mergulhadores recreativos e gestores de operadoras e escolas de mergulho. A amostragem consistiu em 35 questionários respondidos por mergulhadores recreativos e sete por gestores de escolas e operadoras do mesmo município. Os dados foram digitalizados em planilhas eletrônicas para sua analise estatística pelo Programa Statistica. Os mergulhadores recreativos analisados são na maioria adultos de 20 - 40 anos, com escolaridade de nível superior e distribuída de forma equilibrada entre homens e mulheres, com variados padrões de renda familiar. Os gastos com saídas e equipamentos variaram significativamente (Qui-quadrado, p < 0, 1 %) de acordo com a renda familiar e faixa etária. Os mergulhadores com menos qualificações em cursos de mergulho são os que mais tocam e revolvem o fundo. Os impactos ambientais negativos da atividade do mergulho são: a) interação com a biota; b) presença de lixo.  A maioria dos mergulhadores apontou que a disposição adequada de lixo, evitar o óleo na água e ancoragem adequada são soluções para minimizar o impacto negativo dos mergulhos recreativos. Todos foram unânimes de que não se deve tocar o fundo.   Os subsídios técnicos propostos são: 1) a necessidade urgente da inclusão de conteúdos sobre os ecossistemas aquáticos nos cursos do nível básico à dive-master, na forma de materiais impressos e preleções; 2) Especial atenção dos guias e instrutores aos iniciantes e mergulhadores com qualificação básica; 3)  devem-se evitar ecossistemas sensíveis para instrução de novos alunos, batismos subaquáticos e visitação por mergulhadores básicos; 4) o uso correto do colete hidrostático deve ser obrigatório; 5) treinamentos para o correto deslocamento submerso devem ser inseridos nos cursos; 6) preleções abrangentes devem ser feitas previamente à qualquer mergulho realizado por um grupo de alunos ou turistas; 7) as certificadoras devem realizar o acompanhamento e avaliação constante do trabalho dos guias e instrutores. A adoção dessas simples medidas pelos profissionais do setor do mergulho recreativo trará inúmeros benefícios para o setor e a integridade dos ecossistemas visitados, possibilitando um ecoturismo marinho sustentável. &# 13; &# 13; &# 13; ABSTRACT&# 13; Marine recreational diving {{stands out}} among {{one of the}} most profitable services in the coastal area of Rio de Janeiro. The paper describes and evaluates the environmental perception of recreational divers and the possible impacts that may be caused by this activity in Rio de Janeiro coastal zone and surroundings, in order to generate subsidies for this activity optimization. Specific questionnaires were elaborated for primary data collection from recreational divers and managers of diving shops and schools. The whole sample comprised by 35 questionnaires filled by recreational divers resident in Rio de Janeiro city and 7 by managers of diving shops and schools situated at the same city. All collected data was statistically analyzed in electronic spreadsheets by Statistica Program. The majority of divers surveyed were adults between 20 to 40 years old, with graduated degree and evenly distributed among men and woman. They presented different patterns of income and their expenditures with diving trips and equipments varied significantly (Chi-square, p < 0, 1 %) according to their incomes and age. The divers with less qualification (diving courses) were the ones who touch the substrate and also revolve the sediment more frequently. The negative environmental impacts due the diving activity are the following: a) the interaction with marine life; b) littering. Most of the divers point out that adequate litter disposal, avoidance of oil pollution and correct anchoring are solutions for minimizing the negative impact due the recreational diving. All divers are unanimous that it was not allowed <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> <b>bottom.</b> This research brought some important technical subsides, listed as following: 1) it’s urgent that some knowledge related to the aquatic environment were added to the contends of diving courses from basic to dive-master levels as printed materials or teachings; 2) especial attention must be given by diving guides and instructors to beginners and basic qualification divers; 3) sensitive ecosystems must be avoided for field classes, diving baptism and visitation by basic level divers, 4) the correct use of buoyancy equilibrator must be obligatory; 5) training for correct underwater movements and swimming must be included among diving courses teachings; 6) comprehensive teachings must be performed previously and along each dive by a group of tourists or at field classes; 7) recreational diving associations must perform comprehensive follow ups and evaluation of the personal employed at their affiliated diving shops and schools. It’s believed that the throughout adoption of these simple procedures by the professionals involved in the recreational diving, will be possible to obtain innumerous benefits to that activity as well as the integrity of these visited ecosystems. &# 13; &# 13; KEYWORDS: Coastal Zone; Marine Diving Tourism; Environmental Sustainability...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- This paper {{describes}} a hand-arm system equipped with optical three-axis tactile sensors and a binocular vision sensor. The vision compensates for {{the limitations of}} tactile information and tactile sensing, and vice versa. The tactile sensor can obtain geometrical data as real scale, while image data requires calibration to obtain length as a metric unit. Even if stereovision is used, we cannot obtain sufficient precision. In the evaluation test, the robotic hand equipped with tactile sensors traces an object including convex and concave portions to evaluate edge trace precision. Error of distance obtained by the binocular vision is around 10 mm when distance between the camera and object is around 600 mm. When the hand-arm robot touches the convex portion of the object, size data obtained by the vision is modified within 0. 5 mm accuracy. Since the robotic finger is too thick <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> the <b>bottom</b> of the concave, size data of the concave portion obtained by tactile sensing includes relatively large error of around 4 mm. However, the robot finger can follow the contour with 0. 5 mm accurac...|$|R
5000|$|It is also {{possible}} to print objects [...] "bottom up" [...] by using a vat with a transparent bottom, and focusing the UV or deep-blue polymerization laser upward through {{the bottom of the}} vat. For example, the Form 1 stereolithography machine starts a print by lowering the build platform <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> the <b>bottom</b> of the resin-filled vat, then moving upward the height of one layer. The UV laser then writes the bottom-most layer of the desired part upward through the transparent vat bottom, and the photopolymer hardens selectively where the laser strikes. Then the vat is [...] "rocked", flexing and peeling the bottom of the vat away from the hardened photopolymer; the hardened material detaches {{from the bottom of the}} vat and stays attached to the rising build platform, and new liquid photopolymer flows in from the edges of the partially built part. The UV laser then writes the second-from-bottom layer and repeats the process. An advantage of this bottom-up mode is that the build volume can be much bigger than the vat itself, and only enough photopolymer is needed to keep the bottom of the build vat continuously full of photopolymer.|$|R

40|$|Evidence from {{experimental}} philosophy {{indicates that}} people think that their choices are not determined. What remains unclear is why people think this. Denying determinism is rather presumptuous given people’s general ignorance {{about the nature of}} the universe. In this paper, I’ll argue that the belief in indeterminism depends on a default presumption that we know the factors that influence our decision making. That presumption was reasonable at earlier points in intellectual history. But in light of work in cognitive science, we are no longer justified in sustaining the presupposition that we know what influences our choices. As a result, I’ll suggest, our belief in indeterminist choice is unjustified. 1 I. THE INDETERMINIST INTUITION A diverse body of evidence indicates that people have the intuition that choice isn’t determined. The evidence comes from interviews with children, vignette tasks, and phenomenological studies. Let’s start with the children. Young children are fluent with the idea that a person often could have done otherwise than she did.
