Nevertheless, some observers suggested that the agreement would have little practical effect, arguing that Olympio was largely distant from his party's operations.|$|E

It is also revealed that Kent, who had only been mentioned briefly in previous Saint adventures, harboured an unrequited love for Patricia Holm, possibly originating from a Mediterranean cruise on which Templar had assigned Kent to take Holm to keep her out of trouble (as indicated in Enter the Saint).|$|E

25|$|Cargas {{generally}} {{last for}} one year and start small, such as being in charge of cleaning the neighborhood church, collecting alms and acting as a go-between for the priest and parishioners. However, most involve the sponsorship of the many religious festivals {{that take place in}} the city. This system {{is one of the more}} complex of its type in the world. Receiving a carga gives the person, called a mayordomo, prestige from the community since he is considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> the common good. Mayordomos can be men, women and even children. The most prestigious carga is to be the mayordomo of the neighborhood's patron saint. This mayordomo receives a certain amount of authority and even a silver scepter along with physical possession of the image. The wives of these mayordomos, carry silver baskets. Even more prestigious than this is to be a mayordomo of a citywide festival which is organized among the neighborhoods. These include the festival of the Virgin of the Remedies, the Fiesta del Pueblo, and events related to Holy Week.|$|E

500|$|The {{counterfeit}} money was transported from Sachsenhausen to Schloss Labers, an SS-run {{facility in the}} South Tyrol. It was put through a money laundering operation run by Friedrich Schwend, who had been running an illegal currency and smuggling business since the 1930s. He negotiated a deal {{in which he would}} be paid 33.3% of the money he laundered; 25% was given to his agents undertaking the work—as payment to them and their sub-agents, and for expenses—leaving him with 8.3%. He recruited what he called [...] "salesmen" [...] in various territories, and built a network of 50 agents and sub agents; some of these were Jewish, deliberately selected because there was less chance that the authorities would consider them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> the Nazis. He informed his agents that the money had been seized from the banks of occupied countries.|$|E
500|$|The {{second season}} begins eight {{hours after the}} escape, {{focusing}} mainly on the eight escapees. Series creator Paul Scheuring describes the second season as [...] "The Fugitive times eight" [...] and likens it to the [...] "second half of The Great Escape." [...] The fugitives split up and journey to locations across {{the country with the}} authorities close behind them as they each pursue their individual goals. Brad Bellick gets fired from the prison where he worked as the main guard and chases after the inmates himself for the reward money. Several of the escapees reunite in search of a large cache of money buried long ago by another Fox River inmate, Charles Westmoreland. Federal agent Alexander Mahone is assigned to track down and capture the eight fugitives, but is revealed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> The Company, which wants all eight men dead. When Sara discovers her father, Governor Frank Tancredi, has been killed, she meets with Michael, remaining with him as the brothers try to bring down now-President Reynolds, a Company member. To ensure the brothers' safety, Sara allows herself to be arrested and faces trial. During the trial, the testimony of former Secret Service agent Paul Kellerman, who used to work for The Company-controlled President, exonerates Lincoln and Sara. Half of the escapees are killed or recaptured, but the brothers make it to Panama. Michael, T-Bag, Mahone, and Bellick are arrested by the Panamanian authorities and imprisoned at the Penitenciaría Federal de Sona.|$|E
500|$|In his 2002 book Strange TV, M. Keith Booker {{describes}} [...] "Humbug" [...] as {{an important}} episode in the show's [...] "ironization" [...] of its exploration of [...] "Otherness"; from the start it challenges the characters'—and viewers'—assumptions about difference. In the teaser, {{what appears to be}} a monster is in fact a suburban father and eventual murder victim. When Mulder and Scully are quick to suspect the freak show performers of murder, Dr. Blockhead, a self-made freak and [...] "postmodern celebration of difference", confronts their prejudice and bemoans a future with no genetic anomalies. The agents, with their conventional appearance are considered outsiders, and are quickly (and correctly) judged <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> the FBI. According to Booker, the freak show characters from the episode exemplify the concept of the Other. He contrasts the perspective of [...] "Humbug", which celebrates Otherness, with that of The X-Files overall in which [...] "Other" [...] is generally synonymous with danger and evil, much like Leonard. Despite this association between difference and malevolence generally found in The X-Files, the show meets the audience's need for difference and diversity, in its sheer number of strange and different characters. This need for something beyond everyday existence is mirrored by the main characters in Mulder's [...] "wanting to believe" [...] in the paranormal and Scully's Catholic faith. In [...] "Humbug", this is highlighted by Dr. Blockhead's argument that the freaks add a richness to life that will be eliminated by genetic advancements.|$|E

500|$|Cyrus' first live {{performance}} of [...] "Party in the U.S.A." [...] at the Teen Choice Awards held on August 10, 2009. Clothed by {{a tank top}} that revealed a portion of her bra, black hot pants, and leather boots, Cyrus and backup dancers appeared from a trailer. Midway through the performance, Cyrus danced atop an ice cream pushcart with a pole (which was suggested to be a dance pole by numerous critics) for approximately forty seconds. Cyrus described the performance to be about her heritage: [...] " [...] performance tonight is funny, but I {{wanted it to be}} about [...] I'm like, 'This is to represent where I am from. I'm so proud of it.' All the girls trying to be Hollywood and stuff with their big glasses, me shooing them away." [...] The performance was met with a media uproar in regards to her dancing being too suggestive and sexual for a teen-oriented event, which caused The Walt Disney Company to issue a statement distancing themselves from the performance. Ian Drew, senior editor of Us Weekly said, [...] "She already has this risque image, so it really wasn't much of a stretch. That's how Britney [...] took off. She was the good girl gone bad, and it looks <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>working</b> <b>for</b> Miley as well." [...] Other contemporary critics used negative comparisons to Spears, but Cyrus welcomed the comparisons via a post on her official Twitter account. Child psychologist Wendi Fischer told Newsday: Cyrus was communicating to her fans that it is acceptable to pole dance, which, according to Fischer, was unacceptable. [...] "Miley's only 16. Why is she rushing it?", she concluded. Other critics defended Cyrus. Apryl Duncan of About.com said viewers should have fixated on her accomplishments that night, winning six awards, rather than the sexuality of the performance. Following the backlash of the performance, Cyrus replaced the ice cream pushcart with a luggage cart while touring.|$|E
