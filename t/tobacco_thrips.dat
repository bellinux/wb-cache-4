40|$|Abstract: The {{transmission}} {{ability of}} Thrips tabaci, {{one of the}} first recognized vectors of Tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), is a matter of much discussion. Although originally considered as an important vector, it failed to transmit TSWV in several laboratory tests. However, destructive outbreaks of TSWV in the tobacco crops of East Europe and the Balkan Peninsula have for long been attributed to T. tabaci. Recent results have shown that a large diversity exists in the competence to transmit TSWV or other tospoviruses between the parthenogenetic and sexual populations of this haplodiploid species. Arrhenotokous, sexual, populations, are either poor or very efficient vectors of TSWV. Several populations on leeks were poor vectors of TSWV and did not transmit Tomato chlorotic spot virus (TCSV), Groundnut ring spot virus (GRSV) or Impatiens necrotic spot virus (INSV), while others proved to be very efficient vectors of Iris yellow spot virus (IYSV). Arrhenotokous populations from tobacco were highly effective in transmitting TSWV in laboratory tests {{as well as in the}} field. TSWV was acquired by both first and second larval stages of a T. tabaci population from <b>tobacco,</b> and most <b>thrips</b> started to transmit after becoming adults. The dynamics of TSWV spread by arrhenotokous T. tabaci studied in tobacco fields, showed that primary infections play a major role in the development of epidemics.

Molecular breeding also offers the opportunity to pyramid different sources of resistance that could not be effectively selected through conventional breeding due to identical phenotypes and thereby accumulate levels of resistance and/or create potentially more durable resistant cultivars. Considerable has been made in developing genetic linkage maps of chickpea, cowpea, and soybean, while much remains to be done in pigeonpea, beans, lentil, and fieldpea. Preliminary identification of molecular markers resistance to insects in soybean, chickpea, mungbean, fieldpea, and cowpea has been reported. However, no distinct advantage has been observed by using assisted selection resistance to insect pests over the conventional approach, and in most cases, the epistatic are also quite high. Thus, a new paradigm approach may be required to combine conventional approaches and marker-assisted selection in such way as to create systems better than either approach. This paper reviews current state-of-the-art concerning conventional and molecular breeding for pest resistance, and highlight the opportunities and con traints for use of molecular markers for accelerating the pace of development of insectresistant culrivars in grain legumes...|$|R
40|$|Soybean growers {{are facing}} a {{potential}} new threat to production due to an emerging viral disease, Soybean Vein Necrosis Virus (SVNV). Since its initial discovery in soybean fields in Tennessee in 2008, the disease has rapidly spread to 16 states in the U. S. including Indiana. Although it is widely-accepted that thrips are vectors of SVNV, {{it is not known}} which of the many species found in soybean fields such as soybean thrips, flower thrips and <b>tobacco</b> <b>thrips</b> transmits the virus. Because SVNV is newly described, there is no information about the economic impact of the disease and management options. To develop sustainable management practices for SVNV, a sound understanding of the basic aspects {{of the relationship between the}} plant, virus, and the insect vector is essential. The objectives of our study were to 1) Determine the time required for acquisition of SVNV molecules also called Acquisition Access Period (AAP) by soybean thrips and <b>tobacco</b> <b>thrips,</b> and 2) Determine the time required for successful transmission of SVNV to a healthy plant also termed Inoculation Access Period (IAP). First instar nymphs of soybean thrips and <b>tobacco</b> <b>thrips</b> were exposed to SVNV-infected leaves for 6, 12 and 24 hours for acquisition of virus (AAP). Once the nymphs developed to adults they were allowed 24, 48, and 72 hours of inoculation of virus to healthy leaves (IAP). Our results suggest that soybean thrips and <b>tobacco</b> <b>thrips</b> differed in their ability to acquire virus. Soybean thrips were more efficient in transmitting the virus to healthy leaves. Gene expression analysis confirmed different levels of virus in soybean and <b>tobacco</b> <b>thrips.</b> These data provide new information about the factors affecting competencies in vector and non-vector species.

40|$|Soybean vein {{necrosis}} virus (SVNV) is {{an emerging}} viral disease affecting soybean, first discovered in Tennessee in 2008. SVNV {{has been identified}} as being a new virus in the genus Tospovirus, which are typically vectored by thrips. So far, only soybean thrips have been confirmed to transmit SVNV. However, other thrips species are found in soybean fields, including eastern flower thrips and <b>tobacco</b> <b>thrips.</b> The objectives of this study were to 1) Determine vector competence in three thrips species including soybean, eastern flower and <b>tobacco</b> <b>thrips,</b> and 2) Determine the effect of SVNV on host plant preference and life history of the thrips vector. Vector competence assays showed that eastern flower thrips and <b>tobacco</b> <b>thrips</b> were able to acquire the virus after being exposed to SVNV-infected leaf tissues for 48 hours. Both species were also able to successfully transmit SVNV to healthy plants, but at a lower efficiency (less than 10 % of the plants were infected by eastern flower thrips and 36 % by <b>tobacco</b> <b>thrips)</b> than soybean thrips (71 % infection). SVNV infection did not influence host preference of soybean thrips that is both SVNV-infected and SVNV-uninfected soybean thrips aggregated on healthy plants compared to SVNV-infected plants. SVNV-infected soybean thrips had significantly higher fecundity compared to uninfected thrips. Taken together, these results contribute {{to a better understanding of}} virus-vector interaction, which is crucial for control of SVNV, as well as control of soybean thrips. [URL]...|$|E

40|$|Acylsugars are {{secondary}} metabolites exuded from type IV glandular trichomes {{that provide}} broad-spectrum insect suppression for Solanum pennellii Correll, a wild relative of cultivated tomato. Acylsugars produced by different S. pennellii accessions vary by sugar moieties (glucose or sucrose) and fatty acid side chains (lengths and branching patterns). Our {{objective was to}} determine which acylsugar compositions more effectively suppressed oviposition of the whitefly Bemisia tabaci (Gennadius) (Middle East [...] Asia Minor 1 Group), <b>tobacco</b> <b>thrips,</b> Frankliniella fusca (Hinds), and western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis (Pergande). We extracted and characterized acylsugars from four S. pennellii accessions with different compositions, {{as well as from}} an acylsugar-producing tomato breeding line. We also fractionated the acylsugars of one S. pennellii accession {{to examine the effects of}} its components. Effects of acylsugars on oviposition were evaluated by administering a range of doses to oviposition sites of adult whiteflies and thrips in non-choice and choice bioassays, respectively. The acylsugars from S. pennellii accessions and the tomato breeding line demonstrated differential functionality in their ability to alter the distribution of whitefly oviposition and suppress oviposition on acylsugar treated substrates. <b>Tobacco</b> <b>thrips</b> were sensitive to all compositions while western flower thrips and whiteflies were more sensitive to acylsugars from a subset of S. pennellii accessions. It follows that acylsugars could thus mediate plant-enemy interactions in such a way as to affect evolution of host specialization, resistance specificity, and potentially host differentiation or local adaptation. The acylsugars from S. pennellii LA 1376 were separated by polarity into two fractions that differed sharply for their sugar moieties and fatty acid side chains. These fractions had different efficacies, with neither having activity approaching that of the original exudate. When these two fractions were recombined, the effect on both whiteflies and thrips exceeded the sum of the two fractions' effects, and was similar to that of the original exudate. These results suggest that increasing diversity of components within a mixture may increase suppression through synergistic interactions. This study demonstrates the potential for composition-specific deployment of acylsugars for herbivore oviposition suppression, either through in planta production by tomato lines, or as biocides applied by a foliar spray...|$|E
40|$|Soybean vein {{necrosis}} virus (SVNV) {{is a new}} {{viral disease}} infecting soybean crops in the United States. Since its discovery in 2008, it has since spread to infect many states in the US and has also been detected in Ontario, Canada. SVNV {{has been identified as}} being a new virus in the genus Tospovirus, which are typically transmitted or vectored by thrips. Thrips species make up a large proportion of arthropods found in soybean fields, sometimes accounting for up to half of the arthropods collected. So far, only soybean thrips have been confirmed to transmit SVNV. However, eight other species of thrips are found in soybean fields, including eastern flower thrips and <b>tobacco</b> <b>thrips.</b> The goal of my thesis project is to improve our understanding of the plant pathogen, SVNV, and the thrips vectors of SVNV. There were two main objectives of the project. The first objective was to determine SVNV incidence and seasonal patterns of thrips abundance in soybean fields, and {{to determine the effects of}} weather on these two factors. SVNV was quite widespread during the 2013 and 2014 growing seasons in Indiana. Virus incidence as well as thrips abundance showed seasonal patterns, with SVNV symptoms being detected in August, coinciding with the highest incidence of thrips. Weather parameters, such as degree day and rainfall index varied in their ability to predict the abundance of different species in the field. Cumulative degree day was the most useful parameter in predicting soybean, eastern flower, and <b>tobacco</b> <b>thrips</b> abundance using short term weather data. However, the rainfall index became more important in determining thrips abundance over the long term for soybean thrips. The second objective was to determine the life history traits of infected and uninfected soybean thrips as well as the life history traits of different species of thrips on soybean. Total fecundity was the only life history trait studied that showed a significant difference between SVNV-infected and –uninfected soybean thrips. However, this is the first report that shows that SVNV infection has a direct negative impact on soybean thrips vectors. Soybean thrips also showed the highest fecundity on soybean out of the three species studied. Outcomes of this study will increase the known information and understanding of population dynamics of SVNV and thrips vectors in the field, as well as the life history traits of known and potential vectors of SVNV, all of which will be beneficial in implementing management strategies to control the spread of SVNV. ...|$|E
40|$|Effects of {{temperature}} and precipitation on the temporal patterns of dispersing <b>tobacco</b> <b>thrips,</b> Frankliniella fusca, and onion thrips, Thrips tabaci, caught on yellow sticky traps were estimated {{in central and}} eastern North Carolina and eastern Virginia from 1997 through 2001. The impact that these environmental factors had on numbers of F. fusca and T. tabaci caught on sticky traps during April and May was determined using stepwise regression analysis of 43 and 38 site-years of aerial trapping data from 21 and 18 different field locations, respectively. The independent variables used in the regression models included degree-days, total precipitation, and the number of days in which precipitation occurred during January through May. Each variable was significant in explaining variation for both thrips species and, in all models, degree-days was the single best explanatory variable. Precipitation had a comparatively greater effect on T. tabaci than F. fusca. The numbers of F. fusca and T. tabaci captured in flight were positively related to degree-days and the number of days with precipitation but negatively related to total precipitation. Combined in a single model, degree-days, total precipitation, and the number of days with precipitation explained 70 and 55 % of the total variation in the number of F. fusca captured from 1 April through 10 May and from 1 April through 31 May, respectively. Regarding T. tabaci flights, degree-days, total precipitation, and the number of days with precipitation collectively explained 57 and 63 % of the total variation in the number captured from 1 April through 10 May and from 1 April through 31 May, respectivel...|$|E
40|$|From its {{original}} discovery in 2008, the Soybean vein necrosis virus (SVNV), first prevalent in Tennessee, has since spread to fifteen {{states in the}} Northern region. Typically vectored by thrips, the Tospovirus genus virus’ effects are gaining attention even as SVNV’s agricultural importance {{has yet to be}} fully assessed. Currently, soybean thrips is considered the primary vector or most efficient transmitter of the virus, whereas <b>tobacco</b> <b>thrips</b> and eastern flower thrips are secondary vectors. The {{purpose of this study was}} the following: Investigate the mechanism by which thrips spread the virus from plant to plant by conducting choice tests. Choice tests were conducted in enclosed structures to isolate an individual leaf connected to two distinct living plants. Six SVNV-infected thrips were released inside the enclosure. This allowed for random choice of the thrips. The choice-test can explain whether infected thrips (1) prefer to feed on uninfected plants rather than infected plants or (2) thrips show no feeding preference at all. A series of twenty non-choice tests were completed using two uninfected plants to reveal thrips preference in a control setting. The results showed an approximately 1 : 1 preference for the two leaves, which laid the groundwork to support the non-random preference of virus transmittance. A second set of twenty choice tests were completed using one infected and one non-infected plant to reveal thrips preference. The choice-test showed all of the infected thrips preferred to feed on the uninfected plant. This suggests that as SVNV-infected thrips feed and infect a healthy plant their offspring will become infected which could lead to increased virus transmission as a result of increased population of viruliferous thrips.

Our objectives of this study include 1) to compare life history traits of a confirmed vector species, soybean thrips, to a potential vector species, eastern flower thrips and 2) to compare life history traits of viruliferous and non-viruliferous soybean thrips to determine the effect of the pathogen on its insect vector. Our results show that there is a neutral effect of SVNV infection on soybean thrips, since there is no significant difference between viruliferous and non-viruliferous soybean thrips life history traits. Life history traits studied include hatching time, number of first instars, fecundity on day 14, total offspring, development time, and juvenile survival. The differences between life history traits of vector species and non-vector or potential species may explain why soybean thrips are the only confirmed vectors of SVNV. Other species may not have the ability to transmit SVNV, or may be more negatively or positively affected by SVNV infection. Results of our research will help in developing specific management strategies for SVNV based on insect vector biology. [URL]...|$|E
