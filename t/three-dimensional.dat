5|$|An {{ordinary}} sphere in <b>three-dimensional</b> space — the surface, not {{the solid}} ball — {{is just one}} example of what a sphere means in topology. Geometry defines a sphere rigidly, as a shape. Here are some alternatives.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} work of J. D. Brown and Marc Henneaux in 1986, {{physicists}} have noticed that quantum gravity in a <b>three-dimensional</b> spacetime is closely related to two-dimensional conformal field theory. In 1995, Henneaux and his coworkers explored this relationship in more detail, suggesting that <b>three-dimensional</b> gravity in anti-de Sitter space is equivalent to the conformal field theory known as Liouville field theory. Another conjecture formulated by Edward Witten states that <b>three-dimensional</b> gravity in anti-de Sitter space is equivalent to a conformal field theory with monster group symmetry. These conjectures provide examples of the AdS/CFT correspondence that do not require the full apparatus of string or M-theory.|$|E
5|$|Burial 1 is a tomb in the Lost World complex. A fine ceramic bowl was {{recovered}} from the tomb, with the handle formed from <b>three-dimensional</b> head and neck of a bird emerging from the two-dimensional body painted on the lid.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes {{are known}} to {{catalyze}} more than 5,000 biochemical reaction types. Most enzymes are proteins, although a few are catalytic RNA molecules. The latter are called ribozymes. Enzymes' specificity comes from their unique <b>three-dimensional</b> structures.|$|E

5|$|Local style sculptures are {{generally}} boulders carved into zoomorphic shapes, including <b>three-dimensional</b> representations of frogs, toads and crocodilians.|$|E
5|$|Other uses of interferometers {{have been}} to study {{dispersion}} of materials, measurement of complex indices of refraction, and thermal properties. They are also used for <b>three-dimensional</b> motion mapping including mapping vibrational patterns of structures.|$|E
5|$|Salvador Dalí's Corpus Hypercubus depicts an {{unfolded}} <b>three-dimensional</b> net for a hypercube, a four-dimensional regular polyhedron.|$|E
5|$|Structural DNA nanotechnology, {{sometimes}} abbreviated as SDN, {{focuses on}} synthesizing and characterizing nucleic acid complexes and materials where the assembly has a static, equilibrium endpoint. The nucleic acid double helix has a robust, defined <b>three-dimensional</b> geometry {{that makes it}} possible to predict and design the structures of more complicated nucleic acid complexes. Many such structures have been created, including two- and <b>three-dimensional</b> structures, and periodic, aperiodic, and discrete structures.|$|E
5|$|The Great George, {{which is}} worn {{suspended}} from the collar, is a colourfully enamelled (sometimes jewelled) <b>three-dimensional</b> figure of St. George the Martyr on horseback slaying a dragon.|$|E
5|$|The Pythagorean tiling may be {{generalized}} to a <b>three-dimensional</b> tiling of Euclidean space by cubes of two different sizes, which also is unilateral and equitransitive. Attila Bölcskei calls this <b>three-dimensional</b> tiling the Rogers filling. He conjectures that, in any dimension greater than three, there is again a unique unilateral and equitransitive way of tiling space by hypercubes of two different sizes.|$|E
5|$|The {{objects to}} be {{transformed}} may be something else than ordinary physical objects extending in three spatial dimensions (and time, unless the frame is the rest frame). It is for these objects that representation theory is needed for the mathematical description of transformations induced by ordinary Lorentz transformations of spacetime. For instance, the electromagnetic field is often (naively) envisaged by the assignment to each point in spacetime of a <b>three-dimensional</b> vector representing the electric field and another <b>three-dimensional</b> vector representing the magnetic field.|$|E
5|$|The studio's new {{multiplane}} camera gave a <b>three-dimensional</b> {{feeling in}} many sequences {{and was also}} used to give a rotating effect in the scene where the Queen transforms into a witch.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} feature of anti-de Sitter space is its boundary (which looks like a cylinder {{in the case of}} <b>three-dimensional</b> anti-de Sitter space). One property of this boundary is that, locally around any point, it looks just like Minkowski space, the model of spacetime used in nongravitational physics.|$|E
5|$|Forming <b>three-dimensional</b> lattices of DNA was the {{earliest}} goal of DNA nanotechnology, but this {{proved to be}} one of the most difficult to realize. Success using a motif based on the concept of tensegrity, a balance between tension and compression forces, was finally reported in 2009.|$|E
25|$|This may be {{generalized}} to a <b>three-dimensional</b> lattice. The wavenumber k {{is replaced by a}} <b>three-dimensional</b> wavevector k. Furthermore, each k is now associated with three normal coordinates.|$|E
25|$|The set of all lines {{through the}} origin in <b>three-dimensional</b> space forms a space called the real {{projective}} plane. This space {{is difficult to}} visualize, because it cannot be embedded in <b>three-dimensional</b> space.|$|E
25|$|<b>Three-dimensional</b> {{graphics}} {{are currently}} mostly used in computer games, art, and computer-aided design (CAD). A <b>three-dimensional</b> computing environment {{can also be}} useful in other uses, like molecular graphics and aircraft design.|$|E
25|$|Stationary {{displays}} {{can vary}} from a conventional desktop display to 360-degree wrap around screens to stereo <b>three-dimensional</b> screens. Conventional desktop displays can vary in size from 15 to 60+ inches. Wrap around screens are typically utilized in {{what is known as}} a cave automatic virtual environment (CAVE). Stereo <b>three-dimensional</b> screens produce <b>three-dimensional</b> images either with or without special glasses—depending on the design.|$|E
25|$|Each protein {{exists as}} an {{unfolded}} polypeptide or random coil when translated from {{a sequence of}} mRNA into a linear chain of amino acids. This polypeptide lacks any developed <b>three-dimensional</b> structure (the left hand side of the neighboring figure). Amino acids {{interact with each other}} to produce a well-defined <b>three-dimensional</b> structure, the folded protein (the right hand side of the figure) known as the native state. The resulting <b>three-dimensional</b> structure is determined by the amino acid sequence (Anfinsen's dogma).|$|E
25|$|Another {{branch in}} the <b>three-dimensional</b> desktop {{environment}} is the <b>three-dimensional</b> GUIs {{that take the}} desktop metaphor a step further, like the BumpTop, where users can manipulate documents and windows {{as if they were}} physical documents, with realistic movement and physics.|$|E
25|$|Some {{projects}} {{have attempted to}} implement a <b>three-dimensional</b> method of displaying files and directory structures. <b>Three-dimensional</b> file browsing has not yet become popular; the exact implementation tends to differ between projects, {{and there are no}} common standards to follow.|$|E
25|$|Completing the proof, Perelman takes any compact, simply connected, <b>three-dimensional</b> {{manifold}} without boundary {{and starts}} to run the Ricci flow. This deforms the manifold into round pieces with strands running between them. He cuts the strands and continues deforming the manifold until eventually he is left {{with a collection of}} round <b>three-dimensional</b> spheres. Then he rebuilds the original manifold by connecting the spheres together with <b>three-dimensional</b> cylinders, morphs them into a round shape and sees that, despite all the initial confusion, the manifold was in fact homeomorphic to a sphere.|$|E
25|$|If special {{relativity}} is true, then each observer {{will have their}} own plane of simultaneity, which contains {{a unique set of}} events that constitutes the observer's present moment. Observers moving at different relative velocities have different planes of simultaneity hence different sets of events that are present. Each observer considers their set of present events to be a <b>three-dimensional</b> universe, but even the slightest movement of the head or offset in distance between observers can cause the <b>three-dimensional</b> universes to have differing content. If each <b>three-dimensional</b> universe exists, then the existence of multiple <b>three-dimensional</b> universes suggests that the universe is four-dimensional. The argument is named after the discussions by Rietdijk (1966) and Putnam (1967). It is sometimes called the RietdijkPutnamPenrose argument.|$|E
25|$|A {{tabletop}} {{version of}} Sudoku {{can be played}} with a standard 81-card Set deck (see Set game). A <b>three-dimensional</b> Sudoku puzzle was published in The Daily Telegraph in May 2005. The Times also publishes a <b>three-dimensional</b> version under the name Tredoku. Also, a Sudoku version of the Rubik's Cube is named Sudoku Cube.|$|E

25|$|<b>Three-dimensional</b> GUIs {{appeared}} in science fiction literature and films {{before they were}} technically feasible or in common use. For example; the 1993 American film Jurassic Park features Silicon Graphics' <b>three-dimensional</b> file manager File System Navigator, a real-life file manager for Unix operating systems. The film Minority Report has scenes of police officers using specialized 3d data systems. In prose fiction, <b>three-dimensional</b> user interfaces have been portrayed as immersible environments like William Gibson's Cyberspace or Neal Stephenson's Metaverse. Many futuristic imaginings of user interfaces rely heavily on object-oriented user interface (OOUI) style and especially object-oriented graphical user interface (OOGUI) style.|$|E
25|$|<b>Three-dimensional</b> {{echocardiography}} (also {{known as}} four-dimensional echocardiography when {{the picture is}} moving) is now possible, using a matrix array ultrasound probe and an appropriate processing system. This enables detailed anatomical assessment of cardiac pathology, particularly valvular defects, and cardiomyopathies. The ability to slice the virtual heart in infinite planes in an anatomically appropriate manner and to reconstruct <b>three-dimensional</b> images of anatomic structures make it unique for {{the understanding of the}} congenitally malformed heart. Real-time <b>three-dimensional</b> echocardiography can be used to guide the location of bioptomes during right ventricular endomyocardial biopsies, placement of catheter-delivered valvular devices, and in many other intraoperative assessments.|$|E

25|$|In this method, {{the initial}} <b>three-dimensional</b> system is {{replaced}} with a contact of a body with a linear elastic or viscoelastic foundation (see Fig). The properties of one-dimensional systems coincide exactly {{with those of the}} original <b>three-dimensional</b> system, if the form of the bodies is modified and the elements of the foundation are defined according to the rules of the MDR.|$|E
