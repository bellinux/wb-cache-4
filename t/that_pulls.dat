5|$|A solar chimney (or thermal chimney, in this context) is {{a passive}} solar {{ventilation}} system {{composed of a}} vertical shaft connecting the interior and exterior of a building. As the chimney warms, the air inside is heated causing an updraft <b>that</b> <b>pulls</b> air through the building. Performance can be improved by using glazing and thermal mass materials {{in a way that}} mimics greenhouses.|$|E
5|$|One {{application}} of this principle arises in a film projector. In this application, {{it is necessary to}} advance the film in a jerky, stepwise motion, in which each frame of film stops for {{a fraction of a second}} in front of the projector lens, and then much more quickly the film is moved to the next frame. This can be done using a mechanism in which the rotation of a Reuleaux triangle within a square is used to create a motion pattern for an actuator <b>that</b> <b>pulls</b> the film quickly to each new frame and then pauses the film's motion while the frame is projected.|$|E
5|$|The {{increased}} pressure leads to compression and traction of the cranial nerves, {{a group of}} nerves that arise from the brain stem and supply the face and neck. Most commonly, the abducens nerve (sixth nerve) is involved. This nerve supplies the muscle <b>that</b> <b>pulls</b> the eye outward. Those with sixth nerve palsy therefore experience horizontal double vision which is worse when looking towards the affected side. More rarely, the oculomotor nerve and trochlear nerve (third and fourth nerve palsy, respectively) are affected; both {{play a role in}} eye movements. The facial nerve (seventh cranial nerve) is affected occasionally –- the result is total or partial weakness of the muscles of facial expression on one or both sides of the face.|$|E

25|$|Shoulder pain or {{tenderness}} and, occasionally, a bump in {{the middle}} of the top of the shoulder (over the AC joint) are signs that a separation may have occurred.

25|$|A solar chimney (or thermal chimney) is {{a passive}} solar {{ventilation}} system {{composed of a}} hollow thermal mass connecting the interior and exterior of a building. As the chimney warms, the air inside is heated causing an updraft <b>that</b> <b>pulls</b> air through the building.

25|$|Modern unloaders use rotary dump devices, which {{eliminate}} {{problems with}} coal freezing in bottom dump cars. The unloader includes a train positioner arm <b>that</b> <b>pulls</b> the entire train to position each car over a coal hopper. The dumper clamps an individual car against a platform that swivels the car upside down {{to dump the}} coal. Swiveling couplers enable the entire operation to occur while the cars are still coupled together. Unloading a unit train takes about three hours.|$|E

25|$|On 15 July 2006, 21 {{people were}} injured at Liseberg when two roller coaster trains, on the rollercoaster Lisebergbanan, collided. The crash {{happened}} when the chain <b>that</b> <b>pulls</b> trains up the initial climb malfunctioned, causing a fully loaded train to roll backward into the loading platform, hitting another train that was unloading riders. Since {{only part of the}} train was on the lift, the anti-rollback mechanism had not fully engaged and broke. The steel roller coaster was built in 1987 and is one of Sweden's largest, reaching speeds up to 80km/h. Since the accident the roller coaster has opened again, after a technical adjustment.|$|E
25|$|The {{shoulder}} joint {{is the most}} frequently dislocated major joint of the body. In a typical case of a dislocated shoulder, a strong force <b>that</b> <b>pulls</b> the shoulder outward (abduction) or extreme rotation of the joint pops the ball of the humerus out of the shoulder socket. Dislocation commonly occurs {{when there is a}} backward pull on the arm that either catches the muscles unprepared to resist or overwhelms the muscles. When a shoulder dislocates frequently, the condition is referred to as shoulder instability. A partial dislocation where the upper arm bone is partially in and partially out of the socket is called a subluxation. In the medical community, dislocation is commonly referred to as luxation.|$|E
25|$|In simple terms, {{electrophoresis}} is {{a process}} which enables the sorting of molecules based on size. Using an electric field, molecules (such as DNA) {{can be made to}} move through a gel made of agar or polyacrylamide. The electric field consists of a negative charge at one end which pushes the molecules through the gel, and a positive charge at the other end <b>that</b> <b>pulls</b> the molecules through the gel. The molecules being sorted are dispensed into a well in the gel material. The gel is placed in an electrophoresis chamber, which is then connected to a power source. When the electric current is applied, the larger molecules move more slowly through the gel while the smaller molecules move faster. The different sized molecules form distinct bands on the gel.|$|E

500|$|Matthew Millheiser of DVD Talk agreed. Of the series, Millheiser {{called it}} a [...] "great show," [...] with [...] "plotlines that are fast-paced and {{gripping}} throughout", adding, [...] "It lacks the slick, candy-coated escapism and romanticism of Alias, or the white-knuckled, thrill-a-minute intensity of 24. [...] is its own beast altogether: a smart, thrilling series <b>that</b> <b>pulls</b> no punches and maintains a consistent level of quality and intelligence throughout its running time." [...] Bryan Byun of DVD Verdict had an issue with the storylines, stating, [...] "At times it takes {{the entire length of}} an episode to figure out precisely what's going on. While that frenetic pace makes for challenging viewing, it might prevent the show from reaching a broader audience." [...] However, Byun thought the first series was a [...] "solid, gripping entertainment <b>that</b> <b>pulls</b> few punches. While it's a little talkier and more reliant on suspense and mystery than trigger-happy American action shows, [...] should please any fan of cloak-and-dagger antics." [...] Michael Mackenzie of The Digital Fix rated the series eight out of ten, stating that although Spooks [...] "may not be perfect", [...] "it is an imaginative and intriguing series." ...|$|E
500|$|... {{refers to}} a motion <b>that</b> <b>pulls</b> a {{structure}} or part away from the midline of the body. In the case of fingers and toes, it refers to spreading the digits apart, away from the centerline of the hand or foot. Abduction of the wrist is also called radial deviation. For example, raising the arms up, such as when tightrope-walking, {{is an example of}} abduction at the shoulder. When the legs are splayed at the hip, such as when doing a star jump or doing a split, the legs are abducted at the hip.|$|E

[...] The orphaned MCV will sometimes then become the seed of the next thunderstorm outbreak. [...] An MCV that moves into tropical waters, such as the Gulf of Mexico, can serve as the nucleus for a tropical storm or hurricane.|$|E
