5|$|In 1914, for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> years, Robey {{appeared}} in a Christmas pantomime as a male when he was engaged to play the title role in Sinbad the Sailor; Fred Emney Sr played the dame role. Although the critics were surprised by the casting, it appealed to audiences, and the scenes featuring Robey and Emney together proved the most memorable. During the war the demand for light entertainment in the English provinces guaranteed Robey frequent bookings and a regular income. His appearances in Manchester, Liverpool, Newcastle and Glasgow were as popular as his annual performances in Birmingham. His wife Ethel accompanied him on these tours and frequently starred alongside him.|$|E
5|$|The single's {{music video}} was co-directed by Carey and Daniel Pearl. It was {{inspired}} by the Tennessee Williams play Baby Doll and a dream Carey had one night. The video begins with scenes of a man leaving his home one early morning; only his feet are shown. Carey is first seen residing in the derelict house, {{in the middle of a}} large meadow. She awakes, sad and depressed, wearing battered and disheveled clothing. As she walks down the stairs, Carey sits on the staircase, lamenting in agony at her loneliness. As the video climaxes, Carey is seen finally leaving the foyer, apparently for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> years, escaping from the misery she once called home. As she reaches the outskirts of the property, Carey mounts a horse, which assists her in jumping over the barbed fence. After leaving, Carey is seen smiling for the first time in the video, while waiving her arms in the air.|$|E
5000|$|Oberkassel {{was first}} {{mentioned}} as Cassele in 722/723 and as Cassela in 1144. The name Oberkassel {{refers to a}} Roman fortification; {{in the course of}} time [...] "Romerkastell" [...] (Roman castle) became [...] "Oberkassel". Oberkassel absorbed the previously separate settlements of Berghoven (mentioned for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> 873), Büchel (mentioned for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> 1202), Broich (mentioned for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> 1306) and Meerhausen (mentioned for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> 1442).|$|R

25|$|After {{winning a}} {{democratic}} mandate in the 2004 election, {{it was thought}} that Karzai would pursue a more aggressively reformist path in 2005. However, Karzai has proved to be more cautious than was expected. After his new administration took over in 2004, the economy of Afghanistan began growing rapidly for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> years. Government revenue began increasing every year, although it is still heavily dependent on foreign aid.|$|E
25|$|Maravarman Sundara Pandyan {{exposed the}} {{hollowness}} of the Chola power when he invaded the Chola kingdom under Kulothunga Chola III. Cholas finally lost all pretence {{of control in}} the Pandya territories. For <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> generations, the Chola capitals were sacked by the enemy and the Chola king reduced {{to the state of}} a wandering refugee.

50|$|The 1961 Hawthorn Football Club {{season was}} the clubs 37th {{season in the}} Victorian Football League.

25|$|Following {{the signing}} of the ceasefire agreement, {{commercial}} air flights to Jaffna began and the LTTE opened the key A9 highway, which linked government controlled area in the south with Jaffna and ran through LTTE territory, allowing civilian traffic through the Vanni region for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> years. Many foreign countries also offered substantial financial support if peace was achieved and optimism grew that an end to the decades long conflict was in sight.|$|E
25|$|The Brownwood Lions {{had long}} been on the losing side of the {{football}} field, only winning one district championship between 1920 and 1959. 1960 was Coach Wood's first year in Brownwood and he brought the team a 13-1 season. Temple was the only loss the Lions received that year and Brownwood easily claimed the district title for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> years. The Lions went undefeated in the playoffs and won their first state championship, beating Port Lavaca Calhoun 26 to 6 for the state crown.|$|E
25|$|At {{various times}} {{there have been}} {{concerns}} about concentration of newspaper ownership, notably in 1970 and 1980 with two commissions, the Davey Committee on combines and the Kent Royal Commission on Newspapers respectively, and most recently when Conrad Black's Hollinger acquired the Southam newspapers in the late 1990s. When Hollinger sold its Canadian properties, however, many of their smaller-market newspapers were in fact purchased {{by a variety of}} new ownership groups such as Osprey Media, increasing the diversity of newspaper ownership for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> years.|$|E
50|$|The Boston Celtics and the Los Angeles Lakers {{failed to}} qualify for the playoffs. This marked <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> 20 seasons that both teams missed the playoffs.

With the New York Knicks also missing the playoffs, this marked <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> NBA history that none of the three teams {{qualified}} for the playoffs.|$|R
50|$|The Canadian Amateur {{stayed in}} Ontario and Quebec until 1921, {{when it went}} to Manitoba.

Since then, it has rotated around the country's top courses, with the current format {{allowing}} {{each of the six}} major golf regions (Atlantic Canada, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba and Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia) to have its turn on approximately a six-year cycle. Among Canada's ten provinces, only Newfoundland and Labrador has yet to host it.|$|R
25|$|For <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> its history, <b>the</b> tournament {{opened with}} a Friday night fixture. For <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> a decade, all of the teams had the same head coach as in the {{previous}} year's tournament.|$|R
25|$|In December 1996, {{the fifteenth}} {{congress}} was held, {{this time in}} Porto, with more than 1600 delegates participating. The congress criticized the right-wing policies of the socialist government of António Guterres and debated {{the future of the}} PCP following the debacle of the Socialist Bloc. In the subsequent local elections, the party continued to decline, but in the legislative election of 1999, the party increased its voting percentage for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> years. The sixteenth congress was held in December 2000, and Carlos Carvalhas was reelected secretary-general. In the legislative election of 2002, the PCP achieved its lowest voting result ever, with only 7.0% of the vote.|$|E
25|$|The {{passenger}} service {{along the}} branch is operated by Pre Metro Operations {{on behalf of}} London Midland; the service is currently branded as the London Midland Stourbridge Shuttle. Service is provided using two Class 139 Parry People Movers. Replacement buses ran from December 2008 until March 2009 due to the previous Class 153 being reallocated from December 2008, this being the date the Parry People Mover was originally intended to start working the service. However, due to customer feedback, the Class 153 was re-introduced from 15 March until mid June, when the Parry People Mover finally entered full service. For <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> years, a Sunday service is operated.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the next}} two seasons, Collingwood would start the years with win-loss records of 8–3, but {{finished}} those seasons poorly and missed the finals. 2014 was the first season since 2005 where they did not make finals. In both 2016 and 2017, Collingwood missed the finals again, though elected to extend the contract of senior men's coach Nathan Buckley an additional two years. In 2017, the club made significant on-field and administrative changes, creating a senior women's football team and senior women's netball team in the AFL Women's and National Netball League respectively, as well as revealing a new club logo for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> years.|$|E

25|$|For <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> years, Hopkins was {{an underdog}} in the betting, which led the {{confident}} Hopkins {{to place a}} $100,000 bet on himself to win the bout. (The $100K came from a sponsorship deal Hopkins had with online casino site Golden Palace; Hopkins even had the GoldenPalace.com website displayed on his back for the fight.) During promotion for the bout, Hopkins caused huge controversy by throwing the Puerto Rico flag {{on the floor in}} press conferences in both New York City and Puerto Rico, the latter conference leading to a riot in which Hopkins had to be run to safety from the angry mob.|$|E
25|$|The {{limited number}} of copies {{available}} at first were targeted at a select fashionable readership. The late Autumn literary season was just getting under way as the first reviews appeared, and by early January the book {{was the subject of}} conversations at elite literary gatherings. At venues such as Buckingham Palace and Lady Byron's parties, cosmic evolution became a topic of discussion for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> years. Reforming medical journals including The Lancet for 23 November 1844 carried favourable reviews, while criticising specific points. In January the Unitarian quarterly Prospective gave powerful support, but the influential prestige quarterlies which could determine the long term success of books were still looking for reviewers.|$|E
25|$|After {{several years}} of debate over the {{disturbances}} on the coast, the Ming court under Senior Grand Secretary Xia Yan decided to appoint a new grand coordinator to manage coastal defense in the two provinces most affected by the turbulence, Zhejiang and Fujian. In 1547, the veteran general Zhu Wan was made the Grand Coordinator of Zhejiang and Concurrent Superintendent of Military Affairs for Zhejiang and Fujian Coastal Defense (巡撫浙江兼提督浙閩海防軍務), a new position specifically created {{to deal with the}} resurgent wokou problem. It was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> decades that Zhejiang had a single administrative head instead of having three provincial heads each in charge of the military, provincial, and surveillance hierarchies.|$|E
50|$|At the Shanghai Masters, Sock {{defeated}} Milos Raonic for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> {{their last}} nine matches {{to reach his}} first career Masters quarterfinal.

25|$|In 1947, Maria Pavlovna's son, Prince Lennart, {{came from}} Germany on a {{business}} visit that lasted several months. For {{the first time they}} genuinely got to know each other. Maria told Lennart, that she had felt lonely all of her life because of her rootless childhood. She spent much of her adulthood looking for love, having affairs, and finding it hard to fill the empty places inside of her. Two years later, Maria Pavlovna returned to Europe where, at the home of her son on the island of Mainau, in Germany, she re encountered her first husband, Prince Wilhelm of Sweden, for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> years.

25|$|Amidst {{the devastation}} of the Stunde Null year of 1945 cinema {{attendance}} was unsurprisingly down to a fraction of its wartime heights, but already {{by the end of}} the decade it had reached levels that exceeded the pre-war period. For <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> years, German audiences had free access to cinema from around the world and in this period the films of Charlie Chaplin remained popular, as were melodramas from the United States. Nonetheless, the share of the film market for German films in this period and into the 1950s remained relatively large, taking up some 40 percent of the total market. American films took up around 30 percent of the market despite having around twice as many films in distribution as the German industry in the same time frame.|$|E
25|$|The {{first issue}} saw more than 100,000 pre-orders {{prior to its}} release, {{making it one of}} the best-selling comics of both the month and the year, {{requiring}} IDW to issue a second printing; it was only one of two non-DC or non-Marvel comics to be in the top100 comics sold in 2012. Subsequent issues were monthly best sellers and represented IDW's highest-selling property. Journalists in the comic industry noted that with the older fans likely buying comics for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>many</b> years, along with child fans purchasing comic books for the first time, the success of the My Little Pony comic could aid the ailing industry. The first issue was highly praised for capturing the spirit of the characters and presentation of the show while providing a good introduction to its mythos for those who were unfamiliar with it.|$|E
50|$|In 1994, {{the issue}} was digitized, and since then the {{transmission}} quality can not be matched with analog equipment.
