5|$|At {{the start}} of the Middle Ages, England was a part of Britannia, a former {{province}} of the Roman Empire. The local economy had once been dominated by imperial Roman spending on a large military establishment, which in turn helped to support a complex network of towns, roads, and villas. At the end of the 4th century, however, Roman forces had been largely withdrawn, and <b>this</b> <b>economy</b> collapsed. Germanic immigrants began to arrive in increasing numbers during the 5th century, establishing small farms and settlements, and their language, Old English, swiftly spread as people switched from British Celtic and British Latin to the language of this new elite. New political and social identities emerged, including an Anglian culture in the east of England and a Saxon culture in the south, with local groups establishing regiones, small polities ruled over by powerful families and individuals. By the 7th century, some rulers, including those of Wessex, East Anglia, Essex, and Kent, had begun to term themselves kings, living in villae regales, royal centres, and collecting tribute from the surrounding regiones; these kingdoms are {{often referred to as the}} Heptarchy.|$|E

Of primary {{importance for the}} long-run growth of <b>this</b> <b>economy</b> was the commitment to education, beginning with universal elementary education, expanded to upper level schooling as basic levels of literacy were attained. The New Taiwan dollars were issued to replace the Old Taiwan dollars. Successful land reform also took place, enabled by the KMT's interesting role as recent immigrants, and not vested landowners. In addition, the United States aid also helped the reformation of Taiwan's economy.|$|E

[...] Nicole Powers of URB complimented its [...] "irony-laden lyrics, delivered in a style that owes {{a little something to}} Gwen Stefani," [...] as well as the album's [...] "deluxe ditties".

Alexis Petridis of The Guardian found it [...] "packing an immensely addictive melody or an inescapable hook, virtually everything sounds like another hit single", and predicted that it [...] "certainly sounds like it could be big."

[...] Chinese history professor Jonathan Lipman from Mount Holyoke College expressed the dilemma of accepting CI funding thus: [...] "By peddling a product we want, namely Chinese language study, the Confucius Institutes bring the Chinese government into the American academy in powerful ways.

[...] Professor Terry Russell at the University of Manitoba questioned the Hanban's real motivation, fearing the university {{would not be able}} to organize certain activities judged [...] "sensitive" [...] to the Chinese, such as bringing the Dalai Lama onto campus. He said, [...] "'We have a real conflict of our principles of academic freedom,' with the potential to have a faculty version of Chinese history and a Confucius Institute version being taught on campus." [...] According to Cameron Morrill, president of the University of Manitoba Faculty Association, [...] "It is inappropriate to allow any government, either foreign or domestic, control over a university classroom, regardless of how much money they offer."
