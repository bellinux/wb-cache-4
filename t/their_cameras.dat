The artists put <b>their</b> <b>cameras</b> in places that make Eastern State Penitentiary unique to capture the subtle ways nature plays upon {{the structure of the}} building. The goal was to create photographs which are contemplative. By allowing the public to see the gradual effects of time upon specific places, growth and decay are recognized and explored as components that make Eastern State Penitentiary a more living space.|$|E
25|$|In May, 2010, the new Coalition {{government}} {{said that the}} 'Labour's 13-year war on the motorist is over' and that the new government 'pledged to scrap public funding for speed cameras' In July Mike Penning, the Road safety minister reduced the Road Safety Grant for the current year to Local Authorities from £95 million to £57 million, saying that local authorities had relied too heavily on safety cameras {{for far too long}} and that he was pleased that some councils were now focusing on other road safety measures. It is estimated that as a result the Treasury is now distributing £40 million less in Road Safety Grant than is raised from fines in the year. Dorset and Essex announced plans to review camera provision with a view to possibly ending the scheme in their counties, however Dorset strongly affirmed its support for the scheme, albeit reducing financial contributions in line with the reduction in government grant. Seven counties also announced plans to turn off some or all of <b>their</b> <b>cameras,</b> amidst warnings from the country's most senior traffic policeman that this would result in an increase in deaths and injuries. Gloucestershire cancelled plans to update cameras and has reduced or cancelled maintenance contracts.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the combat}} photographers {{were able to}} shoot images of the trek {{to and from the}} camp, they were unable to use <b>their</b> <b>cameras</b> during the night-time raid, as the flashes would {{indicate}} their positions to the Japanese.

500|$|WikiLeaks {{named the}} Baghdad airstrike video [...] "Collateral Murder", and Assange {{released}} it on April 5, 2010, during {{a press conference}} at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C. The video showed two American helicopters firing {{on a group of}} 10 men in the Amin District of Baghdad. Two were Reuters employees there to photograph an American Humvee under attack by the Mahdi Army. Pilots mistook <b>their</b> <b>cameras</b> for weapons. The helicopters also fired on a van, targeted earlier by one helicopter, that had stopped to help wounded members of the first group. Two children in the van were wounded, and their father was killed. Pilots also engaged a building where retreating insurgents were holed up. The Washington Post wrote that it was this video, viewed by millions, that put WikiLeaks on the map. According to Nicks, Manning emailed a superior officer after the video aired and tried to persuade her that it was the same version as the one stored on SIPRNet. Nicks writes that it seemed as though Manning wanted to be caught.|$|E
500|$|The video commences {{with a short}} {{segment of}} {{dramatic}} music. It then focuses on Cyrus, wearing a white tank top, jeans, boots and a black leather jacket, and her boyfriend leaving a movie theater and discussing the movie they saw. Suddenly, Cyrus' boyfriend begins to cough as a full moon emerges from behind the clouds. Cyrus is confused, then horrified as she watches him transform into a paparazzi, and runs away from him as he shouts [...] "Miley, come here! I just want a couple of shots!" [...] and tries to snap pictures of her. The music of [...] "Fly on the Wall" [...] begins as Cyrus runs into a parking garage and tries to hide behind a pillar and a black Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren. As soon as Cyrus tries {{to move away from}} the car, a mob of paparazzi begins to chase her with <b>their</b> <b>cameras.</b> Throughout much of the video, Cyrus runs and hides from the mob. Clips interspaced throughout the video feature her in a long silver shirt and jeans singing and dancing in front of the Mercedes. Eventually, Cyrus is cornered by the paparazzi. She is scared, but then surprised and perplexed when the mob unexpectedly begins to dance in a synchronized manner. Her boyfriend, appearing normal, then arrives in the Mercedes to rescue her. Inside the car, Cyrus describes her strange encounter with the paparazzi to him. Unknown to Cyrus, her boyfriend has planted a video camera in the car; the music video concludes with a shot of the website he posts the video on beneath the headline, [...] "Miley Cyrus Bugs at Paparazzi!!!" [...] The music video to [...] "Fly on the Wall" [...] was first seen on December 5, 2008 on MTV's FNMTV. The video is inspired by Michael Jackson's iconic music video, [...] "Thriller", but trades zombies for paparazzi. MTV also compared the [...] "Fly on the Wall" [...] video for those for [...] "Circus" [...] by Britney Spears and [...] "Rumors" [...] by Lindsay Lohan.|$|E

The new height is intended to avoid having cameras view over fences in front of homes and into homes. This reduced height is to apply immediately, and all areas previously visited will be rescanned from the reduced height. Scans taken at the original height will remain available until they are replaced with the new images.|$|E
2500|$|For example, the Uniform System (U.S.) of {{apertures}} {{was adopted}} {{as a standard}} by the Photographic Society of Great Britain in the 1880s. Bothamley in 1891 said [...] "The stops of all the best makers are now arranged according to this system." [...] U.S. 16 is the same aperture as 16, but apertures that are larger or smaller by a full stop use doubling or halving of the U.S. number, for example 11 is U.S. 8 and 8 is U.S. 4. The exposure time required is directly proportional to the U.S. number. [...] Eastman Kodak used U.S. stops on many of <b>their</b> <b>cameras</b> {{at least in the}} 1920s.|$|E

2500|$|The {{soldiers}} initially stopped about 10 {{meters from}} the students. The first row of troops took aim with machine guns in the prone position.

The night before, a Fox Sports crew setting up for an upcoming Vikings game noticed water leaking from the roof and kept <b>their</b> <b>cameras</b> on all night; those cameras captured the roof tearing and ice and snow falling into the stadium. No one was injured. Most of the roof sagged and {{came to rest on}} cable stays. The collapse caused no damage inside the stadium aside from a light fixture and some seats. The turf was not damaged; a drainage system designed for cleaning purposes allowed the field to dry out. On December 15, 2010, a fourth panel ripped open, sending more snow and ice into the dome.|$|E
