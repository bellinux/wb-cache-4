5|$|The University seal as it {{is today}} is {{symbolic}} of hundreds of years of history. The seal combines attributes from the Bayley Coat of Arms and the Seton family crest. The Seton crest dates back as early as 1216 and symbolizes Scottish nobility. Renowned crest-maker, William F. J. Ryan designed the current form of the Seton Hall crest, which is notable for its three crescents and three torteau. The motto on the seal Hazard Zet Forward (Hazard Zit Forward on some versions) is a combination of Norman French and archaic English meaning at whatever risk, yet go forward. Part custom and part superstition, students avoid stepping on an engraving of the seal {{in the middle of the}} university green. It is said <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>who</b> step on the seal will not graduate on time.|$|E
25|$|Elsewhere it {{has been}} {{reported}} that students’ confidence and satisfaction increased as did their preparedness for laboratories and their information-retrieval and communication abilities. Three separate studies at universities across the United States found <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>who</b> modeled body systems out of clay were significantly better at identifying the constituent parts of human anatomy than their classmates who performed animal dissection.|$|E

50|$|Present {{situation}} : Generally, Children {{of multicultural}} families are confused about their identity.

25|$|Community {{volunteer}} work {{has proven to}} be a powerful predictor in students' academic lives and college experience as a whole. Studies have shown <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>who</b> participate in community service as a part of their college course of study have a much higher correlation of completing their degree (Astin, 1992; Pascarella and Terenzini, 1991). In addition, college students who participate in community volunteer projects as a part of their college experience report finding a much greater relevance in their academic studies after completing community volunteer projects.|$|E
25|$|Once learned, Interlingua {{can be used}} {{to learn}} other related {{languages}} quickly and easily, and in some studies, even to understand them immediately. Research with Swedish students has shown that, after learning Interlingua, they can translate elementary texts from Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish. In one 1974 study, an Interlingua class translated a Spanish text <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>who</b> had taken 150 hours of Spanish found too difficult to understand. Gopsill has suggested that Interlingua's freedom from irregularities allowed the students to grasp the mechanisms of language quickly.|$|E
25|$|A third {{stimulus}} was {{the changes}} in the criteria for University examinations in the early 1970s. The government decided that they wanted to standardize the university admission criteria, based on the language the entrance exams were taken in. It was noted <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>who</b> took the exams in Tamil scored better than the students who took it in Sinhala. Thus the government decided that Tamil students had to achieve a higher score than the students who took the exam in Sinhala to enter the universities. As a result, the number of Tamil students entering universities fell.|$|E

25|$|One {{unforeseen}} {{result of}} the launch of Sputnik by the Soviet Union was the immediate emphasis on education for bright students in the United States, and this settled the question whether {{the federal government should}} get involved in public education at all. The National Defense Education Act (NDEA) was passed by Congress in 1958 with $1 billion US to bolster science, math, and technology in public education. Educators immediately pushed to identify gifted students and serve them in schools. Students chosen for gifted services were given intelligence tests with a strict cutoff, usually at 130, which meant <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>who</b> scored below the 130 were not identified.|$|E
25|$|The Van Wickle Gates, {{dedicated}} on June 18, 1901, have a pair {{of smaller}} side gates that are open year-round, and a large central gate that is opened two days a year for Convocation and Commencement. At Convocation the gate opens inward to admit the procession of new students. At Commencement the gate opens outward for the procession of graduates. A Brown superstition is <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>who</b> walk through the central gate a second time prematurely will not graduate, although walking backwards is said to cancel the hex. Members of the Brown University Band famously flout the superstition by walking through the gate three times too many, as they annually play {{their role in the}} Commencement parade.|$|E
25|$|Placing {{importance}} on native ecosystems and biodiversity within human landscapes increases human exposure to natural areas, {{which has been}} shown to increase appreciation of nature. Studies have shown <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>who</b> participate in outdoor education programs show a greater understanding of their environment, greater willingness to act in order to save the environment, and even a greater enthusiasm for school and learning. Green spaces have also been shown connect urban dwellers of all ages with nature, even when dominated by invasive species. Reconnecting people with nature is especially important for conservation because there is a tendency for people to use the biodiversity present in the landscape they grew up in as a point of comparison for future trends (see Shifting baseline).|$|E

25|$|In the {{academic}} world, plagiarism by students is usually considered {{a very serious}} offense that can result in punishments such as a failing grade on the particular assignment, the entire course, or even being expelled from the institution. Generally, the punishment increases as a person enters higher institutions of learning. The seriousness with which academic institutions address student plagiarism may be tempered by a recognition that students may not fully understand what plagiarism is. A 2015 study showed <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>who</b> were new to university study {{did not have a}} good understanding of even the basic requirements of how to attribute sources in written academic work, yet students were very confident that they understood what referencing and plagiarism are. The same students also had a lenient view of how plagiarism should be penalised.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{research}} has shown that fusion could also be a strong predictor of group-directed helping behaviors. In some studies, individuals donated money to the group. In others, they provided social and emotional support to fellow group members. Other {{research has}} also suggested that strongly fused individuals are especially willing to {{go out of their way}} to protect the group and maintain its integrity. For instance, strongly fused employees were more likely to report having “blown the whistle” sometime during their employment. Presumably, such whistle-blowing activity was motivated by a conviction that their actions would ultimately benefit the group. Another study found <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>who</b> were strongly fused with their university were willing to whistle-blow against a cheating fellow student despite the cost of time, energy, and the possibility of retaliation from the cheater.|$|E
25|$|Opponents of VSU {{note that}} not all {{economic}} benefits are maximised individually (i.e., there are beneficial externalities). For example, student unions have frequently subsidised food outlets on campus, arguing that people get utility from bars crowded with fun-seeking university students – an environment that might {{not exist in the}} absence of subsidy. Proponents respond <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>who</b> don't make use of the crowded outlet are paying for others' food and drink. Another more serious example relates to advocacy provided by students associations. Many students face difficult personal and financial problems whilst studying. Advocacy services are not used by 100% of students, yet all students pay for the service to be available. Some students argue that they are paying for other students to use the advocacy service even though they have not needed to use it.|$|E

25|$|In its history, Preuss {{has been}} the subject of two controversies. The first arose in March 2005 when a study, {{released}} by UCSD through CREATE, concluded <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>who</b> applied to the charter school but lost out in the subsequent lottery did as well in standardized testing as students who won in the lottery and were accepted. This led to speculation that Preuss was a boutique charter school that attracted highly motivated students while leaving less-motivated students to the mainstream public schools. It also led to the criticism that the school's practices were no more progressive than any other public school. A follow-up report by CREATE found, however, that the number of college preparatory (A–G) courses and advanced placement (AP) classes taken by Preuss students was higher than the number taken by their peers who lost in the lottery.|$|E
25|$|The Native American {{language}} education {{movement has}} been met with adversity, such as by English-only campaigns in some areas in the late 1990s. However, Navajo-immersion programs have cropped up across the Navajo Nation. Statistical evidence shows that Navajo-immersion students generally do better on standardized tests than their counterparts educated only in English. Some educators have remarked <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>who</b> know their native languages {{feel a sense of}} pride and identity validation. Since 1989, Diné College, a Navajo tribal community college, has offered an associate degree in the subject of Navajo. This program includes language, literature, culture, medical terminology, and teaching courses; includes about 600 students per semester; and produces the highest number of Navajo teachers of any institution in the United States. One major university that teaches classes in the Navajo language is Arizona State University. In 1992, Young and Morgan published another major work on Navajo: Analytical Lexicon of Navajo, with the assistance of Sally Midgette (Navajo). This work is organized by root, the basis of Athabaskan languages.|$|E
25|$|King's Ely International {{was started}} {{primarily}} as a link school, so <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>who</b> had little English–speaking ability could accustom themselves to the language before going on to the senior school or another English-speaking public school, normally in the sixth form. The centre offers both two and one-year GCSE programmes. The centre recommends that students attend the summer school preceding their arrival, which includes basic English {{as well as social}} activities to helps adapt to English culture. In the last 3 years, King's Ely has integrated the study centre into the main school, with more shared activities in sports and academia. The study centre uses many of the main schools facilities like the dining hall and sports facilities, despite being, physically at least, relatively isolated {{from the rest of the}} school—opposite the Oliver Cromwell Museum near the Cathedral. The termly fees for the study centre are £8400, or £25,200 per year, plus a refundable deposit of £3000. There were 51 pupils in attendance in the academic year 2012–2013.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, a study {{ordered by}} Congress found that middle school {{students}} {{who took part in}} abstinence-only sex education programs were just as likely to have sex in their teenage years as those who did not. From 1999 to 2006, the study tracked more than 2,000 students from age 11 or 12 to age 16; the study included students who had participated in one of four abstinence education programs, as well as a control group who had not participated in such a program. By age 16, about half of each group students in the abstinence-only program as well as students in the control group were still abstinent. Abstinence program participants who became sexually active during the 7-year study period reported having similar numbers of sexual partners as their peers of the same age; moreover, they had sex {{for the first time at}} about the same age as other students. The study also found <b>that</b> <b>students</b> <b>who</b> took part in the abstinence-only programs were just as likely to use contraception when they did have sex as those who did not participate. Abstinence-only education advocates claim the study was too narrow, began when abstinence-only curricula were in their infancy, and ignored other studies that have shown positive effects.|$|E
