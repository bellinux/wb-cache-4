25|$|On 4 April 2011, the Court of Appeal {{dismissed}} {{an appeal}} filed by Yong against the judgment. It affirmed the High Court's {{view that the}} President did not possess any personal discretion when exercising the clemency power, and was required to act in accordance with Cabinet's advice on the matter. This conclusion was evident from the wording of Article 22P(1) of the Constitution, <b>the</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>history</b> of the clemency power in Singapore, relevant case law, {{and the nature of}} the President's power in the Constitution. The Court also noted that both Yong and the Attorney-General agreed that the power of clemency was vested exclusively in the executive and was not justiciable on the merits, because of the doctrine of separation of powers and established administrative law principles. Nonetheless, the use of the power could be judicially reviewed if it was exercised in bad faith for an extraneous purpose, or in a way that contravened constitutional protections and rights. In addition, the Court was of the opinion that the clemency process could not be regarded as having been tainted by a reasonable suspicion of bias due to the Law Minister's remarks. The Minister had merely been setting out the Government's policy of taking a tough approach towards serious drug trafficking offences by imposing a mandatory death penalty as a deterrent. In any case, the rule against bias should not be applied to ministers making public statements on government policy in the same way as it applies to judicial or quasi-judicial officers, otherwise no minister would be able to speak on any policy in public or in Parliament without the statement being regarded as a predetermination of any decision relating to the policy that might have to be made subsequently. Even if the Law Minister's statements indicated that he intended not to grant clemency to Yong, this predetermination could not be attributed to other Cabinet ministers. The alternative view was untenable, as it would mean that once any minister spoke about the Government's policy on the death penalty in a way that showed predetermination of the issue, the entire Cabinet would be disentitled from advising the President on how he should exercise the clemency power.|$|E

500|$|Geoffrey Marshall has characterised section 3 as a [...] "deeply mysterious provision" [...] {{in several}} respects, {{including}} judging how strong a provision it is [...] an issue since {{dealt with by}} the courts [...] but has also noted a disparity between what the Act {{might be expected to}} do and what it does. He argues that a litigant would hope that courts would strive to uphold his rights under the Convention, accepting a derivation from them only rarely; instead section 3 requires courts to find compatibility with the Convention where possible [...] in other words, to strive to find that the Convention does not impact the claimant. Alison L. Young has examined the upper boundaries to courts' powers of interpretation. She puts forward three possible limits: firstly, where the text of a statute is not ambiguous; secondly, where reading in words is inappropriate; and, thirdly, where any interpretation is restricted to cases where it does not involve implied repeal. Young dismisses the first two as incompatible with <b>the</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>history</b> (and, in at least the first case, judicial history) and believes the third to present no rigid limit on courts' powers at all. The decision of Pepper v Hart provides a method for <b>the</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>history</b> of a bill {{to play a role in}} its interpretation.|$|E
40|$|Statutory {{interpretation}} is of crucial importance for both lawyers and judges. A notably fertile source of debate is <b>the</b> use of <b>legislative</b> <b>history</b> {{for purposes of}} statutory interpretation, which gained particular momentum in the past century.

On the other hand, opponents such as Justice Scalia have argued that the only law that should govern is that which has been passed by a majority of the House and the Senate. The debate among American judges and scholars has largely centered around whether or not the courts should be allowed recourse to <b>the</b> <b>legislative</b> record at all, though {{it has been suggested that}} we develop a more nuanced approach to the issue.

500|$|Brennan {{noted that}} the Minnesota Supreme Court had found that the statute did grant the right to tax {{personal}} property as an inherent power, even though the law did not specifically mention the power to tax.

500|$|As to the Nonintercourse Act, the Court {{held that}} it did not preempt the cause of action because [...] "he Nonintercourse Act of 1793 does not speak {{directly}} to the question of remedies for unlawful conveyances of Indian land." [...] The court noted that the Act [...] "did not establish a comprehensive remedial plan for dealing with violations of Indian property rights" [...] and that there was [...] "no indication in <b>the</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>history</b> that Congress intended to pre-empt common-law remedies." [...] Because the Act contained no remedial provisions, and because subsequent Congressional enactments contemplated possessory land suits by Indians, the Court found that preemption was not indicated. The court reviewed its recent aboriginal title decisions, and reiterated its statement in Oneida I that the Act merely [...] "put in statutory form what was or came to be the accepted rule." ...|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>history</b> of the Judiciary Act of 1789 reveals little {{consideration}} of criminal appeals.

[...] Senator (and future Supreme Court justice) William Paterson noticed the lack of provision for criminal appeals in preliminary notes and a draft outline of a speech he gave on June 23, 1789.

40|$|A {{large part}} of the California Supreme Court’s job is to {{interpret}} the statutes that the California Legislature has enacted. The Court has developed clear rules for this task.

In Part II, we summarize <b>the</b> use of <b>legislative</b> <b>history</b> in statutory interpretation, focusing on the rise of the New Textualism and its critique of <b>the</b> use of <b>legislative</b> <b>history</b> in statutory interpretation.

We identify differences that actually strengthen the argument for extrinsic aids as a means of limiting the effects of judicial bias in statutory interpretation, and differences that do not affect the strong analogy between contract and statutory interpretation; we then conclude with a response to formalist objections to <b>the</b> use of <b>legislative</b> <b>history...</b>|$|R
500|$|The Court of Claims had to {{determine}} whether the Menominee Termination Act had taken away that right. If it had, the tribe would have a valid claim for compensation; but if not, then there would be no compensation. On April 14, 1967, the Court of Claims denied the claim, stating that the hunting and fishing rights had not been abrogated by the Termination Act. In arriving at this decision, it said that <b>the</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>history</b> included two witnesses who stated that the Act would not affect hunting and fishing rights acquired by treaty, but would abrogate any such rights acquired by statute.

This decision was reached following an analysis of <b>the</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>history</b> of the Seventeenth Amendment and electoral processes; based on this analysis, the court concluded that the Pennsylvanian use of a nomination process before a special election implied a right to vote, which was violated by the lack of a primary and necessitated a strict scrutinising of the legislation.

500|$|Solicitor General Ted Olson {{argued that}} Congress, in {{response}} to the Duro decision, acted to [...] "recognize and affirm" [...] the Indian tribe's inherent power to enforce its criminal laws against Indians of other tribes. Olson noted that the United States v. Wheeler decision clearly stated that a tribe could prosecute a tribal member for a crime and that the Federal government could subsequently prosecute for the same criminal acts without invoking double jeopardy if the actions of the accused violated Federal law. Olson noted that <b>the</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>history</b> of the Duro fix bill clearly indicated that Congress intended to restore, not delegate, authority to prosecute non-member Indians by a tribe. The government argued that the limitation in Duro was a statutory limitation of the tribe's sovereignty, not a constitutional limit, and that Congress had the authority to remove that limitation. He noted that a tribe's sovereignty has allowed prosecution of non-member Indians for centuries, until it was limited by Congress. The United States was supported by amicus briefs filed by the State of Washington and seven other states, the State of Idaho and five other states, the National Congress of American Indians, and eighteen Indian tribes.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} the appeal was prepared, Seck had left Legal Services but was still the {{attorney}} of record. [...] The tribe paid to fly him to Washington, D.C. to prepare the brief with Dan Israel of NARF and Bernie Becker, the tribe's attorney who would argue the case before the Supreme Court. At oral arguments on April 20, 1976, Becker pointed out that Public Law 280 gave the state jurisdiction over criminal matters and civil [...] "causes of actions" [...] – a legal term for lawsuits. Since Congress had also passed other Indian laws at the same time, such as the various Indian Termination Acts, which specifically authorized states to collect taxes from Indians, its silence in this area meant Congress {{did not intend to}} do so with Public Law 280. Becker brought up the leading article on Public Law 280, by UCLA law professor Carole Goldberg, that argued that the law was established {{to address the problem of}} crime on reservations. He also noted that tribes which had adequate law-and-order processes, such as the Red Lake Band of Chippewa, were excluded from state jurisdiction in Minnesota. Arguing for the State of Minnesota was C. H. Luther of the State Attorney General's office. Luther argued four points for the tax being valid: a) the language of the statute; b) <b>the</b> <b>legislative</b> <b>history</b> of Public Law 280; c) prior judicial opinions; and d) public policy. Luther conceded that if the trailer was a fixed house or real property, it would be exempt from taxation.
