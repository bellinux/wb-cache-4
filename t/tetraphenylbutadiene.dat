40|$|The {{behaviour}} of xenon and argon-xenon gas proportional scintillation counters is con sidered. For X-rays, {{ranges of}} window area are defined showing competition with semiconductor detectors. Data for primary scintillation of X-rays and alpha particles are included. Relative efficiencies of <b>tetraphenylbutadiene,</b> p-terphenyl, diphenyl-stilbene, sodium salicylate and p-quaterphenyl were measure...|$|E
40|$|The {{preparation}} and characterization of three new vanadium-containing metallocycles are reported viz. 2, 2 ´-(di-π-cyclopentadienylvanadium) octafluorobiphenyl, 2, 2 ´-(di-π-cyclopentadienylvanadium) biphenyl and 1, 4 -(di-π-cyclopentadienylvanadium) <b>tetraphenylbutadiene.</b> The thermal stabilities of the complexes, which {{are about the}} same as those of the titanium analogues, are discussed in the light of previous failures to prepare complexes of the type Cp 2 VR 2 (R = aryl) ...|$|E
40|$|Since {{the first}} {{observation}} of an efficient energy transfer between polysilanes, {{we have been}} studying the energy transfer process from polysilanes to their energy-matched counterparts. The resonant energy transfer to dye molecules was utilized for realizing blue(B), green(G) and red(R) electroluminescence (EL) from polysilane-based thin films. A combination of polymethylphenylsilane (energy-donor), <b>tetraphenylbutadiene</b> (B-emitter) and Eu(TTA) 3 -Phen (R-emitter) was tried this time to improve chromatic controllability. The combination enhanced the B-emission intensity without affecting that of the R-emission, suitable for wider colour-tuning region simply by intermixing dye molecules in the wet process. Tailoring emission and/or absorption energy, including the technique of molecular orientation, leads us to light-weight, flexible and intelligent devices for optical applications...|$|E
40|$|Substantial {{improvements}} {{have been}} made in the radiation hardness of plastic scintillators. Cylinders of scintillating materials 2. 2 cm in diameter and 1 cm thick have been exposed to 10 Mrads of gamma rays at a dose rate of 1 Mrad/h in a nitrogen atmosphere. One of the formulations tested showed an immediate decrease in pulse height of only 4 % and has remained stable for 12 days while annealing in air. By comparison a commercial PVT scintillator showed an immediate decrease of 58 % and after 43 days of annealing in air it improved to a 14 % loss. The formulated sample consisted of 70 parts by weight of Dow polystyrene, 30 pbw of pentaphenyltrimethyltrisiloxane (Dow Corning DC 705 oil), 2 pbw of p-terphenyl, 0. 2 pbw of <b>tetraphenylbutadiene,</b> and 0. 5 pbw of UVASIL 299 LM from Ferro...|$|E
