40|$|Aim of this Thesis is {{to assess}} the {{existing}} manufacturing method and to propose and make out an optimum manufacturing method for the part „seat belt buckle“. Components made of the steel plate 14 220. 3. With respect to requested accuracy, quality and expected production run of 1 000 000 pcs per year, the Thesis includes the proposal of manufacture of the part by a method of accurate cutting <b>with</b> <b>push-on</b> edge. Is designed the cutting tool and selected the suitable machine type for this technology Feintool HFA 3200 Plus. The work contains necessary calculations, economical evaluation and design documentation of the processual tools for the components production. The last part contains the technical and economic evaluation, from which results that, technically and economically, the new production technology is preferable to the existing technology...|$|R
40|$|We {{present the}} first {{analytic}} study of stream tapping protocols, {{a family of}} protocols that provide {{the most efficient way}} to distribute videos on demand at low to medium request arrival rates, say, less than ten requests per hour for a two-hour video. The main results of this study are analytical solutions for the optimal operational points of stream <b>tapping,</b> stream <b>tapping</b> <b>with</b> small client buffers, stream <b>tapping</b> <b>with</b> partial preloading and stream <b>tapping</b> <b>with</b> proactive streams. In addition we introduce a new stream <b>tapping</b> protocol <b>with</b> batching that caps the bandwidth requirements of stream tapping at high to very high arrival rates. 1...|$|R
