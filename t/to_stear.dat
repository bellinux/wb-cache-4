Despite the advances in the field of optical OAM, relatively little research has been conducted in the field of acoustical OAM. Presented in this thesis is evidence of the equivalence of optical and acoustical OAM in several experiments that have already been proven and widely accepted for the optical case. Demonstrated in chapter 3 is what has been dubbed an acoustic spanner, which provides a preamble to the main body of the research. In this chapter, an experiment that demonstrates how sound waves can carry a component of OAM using simple off-the-shelf equipment is discussed. An anular array of loudspeakers was constructed and a set of analogue electronics was assembled in such a way that, when driven by a signal from a laboratory signal generator, eight individual signals were produced, identical to the driving signal, but separated by a relative phase difference of π/ 4. The net result is that, considered as a set, there is a difference of 2 π between the first and eighth signals. These signals were sent to the eight speakers which resulted in an approximation to a l = 1 beam. A demonstration is also made of how the OAM carried by a sound beam may be transmitted to matter by observing the rotation of a styrofoam disk, and measure the total displacement from it’s equilibrium position. These reults were confirmed when the direction of the beam was reversed by reversion the direction of the phase increase. A further experiment detailed in chapter 4 was conducted where four signals of varying frequency were superimposed upon one another before being phase shifted and sent to the speakers. This meant that instead of a beam with a single tone, as was generated in the acoustic spanner experiment, a polyphonic acoustic vortex was generated using four frequencies. Using a microphone mounted atop a translation stage, an amplitude cross-section of the vortex confirmed that there were indeed four constituent vortices in the beam. It was also confirmed that these constituent beams were not coupled to one another, and thus it was possible <b>to</b> <b>stear</b> each component of the vortex without affecting the others. This was achieved by modulating the amplitude of the signal at one speaker, and applying an equal and opposite modulation at the corresponding speaker on the opposite side of the array. The final experiment was an investigation into the phase structure of acoustical vortices. While only first order beams were used in the acoustic spanner and polyphonic vortex experiments, high order beams were produced this time. Beams of l = ± 1 ± 2 ± 4 were produced, and the same microphone and translation stage that was used before was used totrace a 2 -dimensional cross-section through the beams and measure their phase profiles. The results for l = ± 1 and ± 2 were as expected, and the phase profiles for these can be seen in the figures in chapter 5. Beams for l = ± 4 were expected to fail since the number of speakers used in the array did not provide enough sources for the beam to fully form into a vortex, and this was also as expected. The phase profiles are incliuded in chapter 5 to demonstrate the limitations of the experiment, and to show that in this case that it’s impossible to differentiate between a l = 4 and a l = − 4 beam in the say that can be done for the others. Similarly, l = ± 3 beams are not measured due to the limitations of the apparatus...|$|E

He then added cabinet T-track to the handles, securely attaching them with cyanoacrylate glue. Adding a few [...] "greebles" [...] (surface details), Christian managed to hand-make the first prototype of a lightsaber prop for Luke before production began. George Lucas {{decided he wanted}} to add a clip to the handle, so that Luke could hang it on his belt. Once Lucas felt the handle was up to his standards, it went <b>to</b> John <b>Stears</b> <b>to</b> create the wooden dowel rod with front-projection paint so that the animators would have a glow of light to enhance later on in post production. Due to lack of preparation time, Christian's prototype and a second spare were used for the shooting in Tunisia, where Star Wars filming began. It was discovered, however, that the glowing effect was greatly dependent on the rod's orientation to the camera, and during the Obi-Wan Kenobi/Darth Vader duel, they could clearly be seen as rods. Because of this, the glow would be added in post-production through rotoscoping, which also allowed for diffusion to be employed to enhance the glow.|$|R

500|$|In 1961 {{producers}} Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman {{joined forces}} to purchase the filming rights to Fleming's novels. They founded the production company Eon Productions and, with financial backing by United Artists, began working on Dr. No, which was directed by Terence Young and featured Connery as Bond. Following Dr. Nos release in 1962, Broccoli and Saltzman created the holding company Danjaq to ensure future productions in the James Bond film series. The series currently encompasses twenty-four films, with the most recent, Spectre, released in October 2015. With a combined gross of nearly $7 billion to date, the films produced by Eon constitute the Fourth-highest-grossing film series, behind Star Wars, Harry Potter and the Marvel Cinematic Universe films. Accounting {{for the effects of}} inflation the Bond films have amassed over $14 billion at current prices. The films have won five Academy Awards: for Sound Effects (now Sound Editing) in Goldfinger (at the 37th Awards), <b>to</b> John <b>Stears</b> for Visual Effects in Thunderball (at the 38th Awards), to Per Hallberg and Karen Baker Landers for Sound Editing, and to Adele and Paul Epworth for Original Song in Skyfall (at the 85th Awards), and to Sam Smith and Jimmy Napes for Original Song in Spectre (at the 88th Awards). Additionally, several of the songs produced for the films have been nominated for Academy Awards for Original Song, including Paul McCartney's [...] "Live and Let Die", Carly Simon's [...] "Nobody Does It Better" [...] and Sheena Easton's [...] "For Your Eyes Only". In 1982, Albert R. Broccoli received the Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award.|$|R
5000|$|According <b>to</b> Marc <b>Stears,</b> {{a member}} of the group, Blue Labour endorses one simple principle: [...] "that our lives go well only when they are lived in {{sustainable}} relationship with others"; the idea people should come together to forge a common good; the idea that our common life improves when schools, hospitals and parks are open to all; the view that some on the left have a horror of cosiness in opposition to the more sensible 'politics of relationships'; and that it is the question of what we owe each other that should determine our moral lives. Stears is unclear on exactly who these 'some on the left' might be, and exactly why they would be opposed to a local community getting together to help make a nice park, share in the development of their local school or support their local hospital; it gives no examples of 'hard-Left' sabotage of PTA summer fetes or hospital fundraising drives; nor does it address exactly why anyone would have to do these things under a 'Blue Labour' monicker. This illustrates the difficulty that those involved in abstract ideological movements have with understanding that some of their 'principles' are simply things that many people believe and already do quite independently of political movements, irrespective of their political affiliations or sympathies. Ed Rooksby questions this Blue Labour narrative, most strongly propounded by Maurice Glasman, of destructive forces within Labour that have overwhelmed an older [...] "deeply conservative socialism": [...] "Political ideologies are battlegrounds on which factions struggle for hegemony, seeking to articulate these ideological components in different combinations. This is the kind of struggle in which Glasman is engaged. For this reason I don't think that Glasman really believes for one second in the kind of historical story he's telling - a tale of corruption of [...] "authentic", prelapsarian labour movement values. This is not really an objective description - it's a [...] "performative" [...] endeavour which seeks to reshape the ideological terrain and create its own truth." ...|$|R
