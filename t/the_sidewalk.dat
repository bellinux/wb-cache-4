5|$|In 2013, the MTA filed {{to change}} the {{location}} of Entrance 1, moving it onto from <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk,</b> away from its original proposed location inside 301 East 69th Street. This was because designs for entrances inside the building failed to both satisfy the building's residents as well as meet the MTA's engineering requirements. With the New York City Department of Transportation planning a bike lane along {{the east side of}} Second Avenue after construction is finished, the MTA could widen <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> {{to make room for the}} entrances without ultimately disrupting traffic flow.|$|E

50|$|Car-oriented urban {{planning}} {{became even more}} extreme since the 1980s, pedestrians seeing part of <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> of <b>the</b> city's popular streets being converted into car-parking spots. The rise in car ownership not only caused high traffic, but also led to drivers parking their cars on <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks.</b> <b>The</b> city currently has no car-free squares or streets other than a few narrow ones. There are plans to convert both ends of Taşköprü to squares and widen <b>the</b> <b>sidewalks</b> in <b>the</b> old town where {{it is difficult to}} walk at <b>the</b> peddler-invaded narrow <b>sidewalks.</b> By far <b>the</b> most pedestrian friendly street of the city is Turgut Özal Boulevard; Kenan Evren and other major streets in Çukurova district are also very convenient for walking.|$|R

5|$|Agent Fox Mulder {{arrives at}} the civic center after {{what looks like a}} massacre; bodies lie on <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> and in the foyer. Sheriff Spencer (John Cygan) {{explains}} that the suspect murdered four people from the elevator with his bare hands. His rampage ended when he was shot by a security guard. Spencer notes that seven other individuals have murdered twenty-two people in Franklin in the past six months. Mulder discovers that the LED display in the elevator has been damaged, and that the dead suspect has a green residue on his fingertips.|$|E
5|$|As the {{consultant}} {{talks with the}} residents of the town and investigates its history, the backstory of his injury is gradually revealed. After repeatedly stubbing his toe and covering it up with Apex bandages, {{the consultant}} accidentally stepped into pig feces during a company team retreat. Because of the colored bandage, he never discovered how his toe was badly infected, and fainted on <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> after fleeing from an awards party. This led to the amputation of his toe, his departure from the nomenclature firm, and the beginning of his hermetic lifestyle.|$|E

5|$|The next day, {{peaceful}} protests {{continued in}} front of the Consulate of Sri Lanka on <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> of Spadina Avenue and at Queen's Park simultaneously. York Regional Police, Peel Regional Police, the OPP and the RCMP continued to help Toronto Police Service to prevent civil diobedience as what had happened the previous night. Toronto Mayor David Miller urged that such tactics as blockading the Gardiner Expressway not be used again. Police officials decried the use of children during such dangerous tactics.|$|E

5|$|In 1898, it was {{reported}} that the stone was unearthed during the installation of electrical road (likely for a tram) and restored to its original location by the Woonsocket chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution. Sometime later, the Daughters of the American Revolution placed a bronze plaque on the stone, but it was absent {{at the time of its}} nomination in 1982. The marker is currently mortared into a retaining wall at the edge of <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> on 640 South Main Street at the intersection and has been since prior to 1982. As of 2013, a Daughters of the American Revolution plaque is present.|$|E
5|$|L'Homme-Rivière is {{a statue}} {{representing}} a log driver at work. The logs are heavily stylized, reduced {{to little more}} than cylinders. The driver and his hook, however, are shown as transforming into a wooden plant. Its location, in a tight space between two tall buildings, gives the sculpture the appearance of travelling down a river gorge. L'Homme-Rivière is highly dynamic, and has been described as looking as though it is about to spill onto <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk.</b> The log driver is a symbolic figure in the history and culture of Quebec, thanks notably to Félix-Antoine Savard's famous novel Menaud, maître draveur.|$|E
5|$|Ninjago City (set number 70620), a large 4867 piece set, was {{released}} in late August {{to coincide with the}} release of the Lego Ninjago Movie. Although not advertised as a modular building, it features the same structure as the regular modulars with a 32x32 stud baseplate, building connectors and a river matching the same dimensions as <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk.</b> It is a huge 3-level model with each level themed differently. The bottom level contains an old fashioned fish market, the middle level contains a modern comic store and sushi bar, and the top floor contains a radio station. The set comes with 16 different minifigures.|$|E

5|$|Six partygoers {{simultaneously}} fall to <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> {{outside the}} Rosencrantz {{apartment building in}} Brooklyn, apparently having jumped from a seventh floor balcony along with the balcony's furniture. When the Fringe team investigates, Peter (Joshua Jackson) and Walter (John Noble) determine by {{the location of the}} bodies that they seem to have fallen through the balcony, as if it momentarily ceased to exist. From other stories of strange phenomena occurring throughout the building, Walter concludes that the same cracks in reality that have harmed the parallel universe are starting to appear in the prime one, with the building occupying a weak spot between universes.|$|E
5|$|The {{producers}} {{originally planned}} to film the teaser sequence at a Catholic hospital, but {{the hospital was}} reluctant to affix a faux gargoyle to the building. Thus, the shot was relocated to Heritage Hall, a noted filming location and former post office in Vancouver. Some last minute scrambling was required when city workmen tore up <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> on the very spot where the producers planned to film the scene. The construction crew reassured the show that the construction would be finished in time for filming. Indeed, the work was finished two hours before shooting of the episode started. Additional exterior shots were filmed at an alley near Bonanza Meat Market. The walls were painted to match those of Heritage Hall, although after filming was completed, they were returned to their original state.|$|E
5|$|They {{were met}} by nearly 400 Insane Clown Posse fans {{standing}} outside {{in front of the}} TRL studio window, all with signs supporting the duo. Thirty minutes before the show began, Viacom security guards and New York City police officers were dispatched to remove all the fans from <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk.</b> When some fans, including Robert Bruce, refused to move because it was a public street and no other individuals were asked to move, they were assaulted. All telephone requests for the video to be played were ignored, and Insane Clown Posse was never mentioned during the show. MTV later informed Island Records that the heads of the network must choose the band first before it can become eligible to be featured on TRL.|$|E

5|$|When Milk's friends {{looked in}} his closet for a suit for his casket, they learned how much he had been {{affected}} by the recent decrease in his income as a supervisor. All of his clothes were coming apart; all of his socks had holes. He was cremated and his ashes were split, most of them scattered in San Francisco Bay by his closest friends. Some of them were encapsulated and buried beneath <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> in front of 575 Castro Street, where Castro Camera had been located. There is a memorial to Milk also at Neptune Society Columbarium, ground floor, San Francisco, California. Harry Britt, one of four people Milk listed on his tape as an acceptable replacement should he be assassinated, was chosen to fill that position by the city's acting mayor, Dianne Feinstein.|$|E
5|$|As Minton grew older, he was {{frequently}} {{in trouble with}} the people in his neighborhood. In 1904, he was arrested for disregarding a town ordinance forbidding bicyclists to ride on <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk.</b> He was taken before a justice of the peace and fined three dollars, an incident he later credited with changing his outlook on life and sparking his desire to become a lawyer. To accomplish that goal, and continue supporting his family, he traveled with his older brother Herbert to Fort Worth, Texas, to take a job at the Swift and Company meat packing plant. His father and younger siblings soon joined him in Texas after the two brothers' income was able to cover their expenses. After saving enough money to help establish the family in a new home, Minton returned to Indiana to attend high school, leaving his family in Texas.|$|E
5|$|Nixon, {{somewhat}} dazed by {{the conversation}} with Dewey, dressed for the speech and reviewed his notes.

Nixon later stated that Chotiner's promise broke the tension and gave him a needed lift. Senator and Mrs. Nixon and his staff journeyed to the El Capitan, where they were met by a cheering group of Young Republicans on <b>the</b> <b>sidewalk</b> outside, including future White House Chief of Staff H.R.
