5|$|Ascetic {{practices}} (tapas), {{concentration and}} bodily postures used by Vedic priests to conduct yajna (sacrifice), {{might have been}} precursors to yoga. Vratya, a group of ascetics mentioned in the Atharvaveda, emphasized on bodily postures which may have evolved into yogic asanas. Early Samhitas also contain references to other group ascetics such as munis, the keśin, and vratyas. Techniques for controlling breath and vital energies are mentioned in the Brahmanas (<b>texts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Vedic corpus, c. 1000–800 BCE) and the Atharvaveda.

5|$|Literature {{also served}} {{religious}} purposes. Beginning with the Pyramid <b>Texts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Kingdom, works of funerary literature written on tomb walls, {{and later on}} coffins, and papyri placed within tombs, were designed to protect and nurture souls in their afterlife. This included the use of magical spells, incantations, and lyrical hymns. Copies of non-funerary literary texts found in non-royal tombs suggest that the dead could entertain themselves in the afterlife by reading these teaching texts and narrative tales.

5|$|The {{actions of}} Yarim-Lim I and his {{alliance}} with Babylon proved vital for the kingdom's economy, for they secured the trade between Mesopotamia and northern Syria, {{with the king}} of Mari protecting the caravans crossing from the Persian Gulf to Anatolia.

5|$|There is {{continuing}} critical {{debate about the}} status of the poem as it is now available to us.

5|$|Beginning {{with the}} funerary stelas for {{officials}} of the late Third dynasty, small amounts of biographical detail were added next to the deceased men's titles. However, {{it was not until}} the Sixth dynasty that narratives of the lives and careers of government officials were inscribed. Tomb biographies became more detailed during the Middle Kingdom, and included information about the deceased person's family. The vast majority of autobiographical texts are dedicated to scribal bureaucrats, but during the New Kingdom some were dedicated to military officers and soldiers. Autobiographical <b>texts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Late Period place a greater stress upon seeking help from deities than acting righteously to succeed in life. Whereas earlier autobiographical texts exclusively dealt with celebrating successful lives, Late Period autobiographical texts include laments for premature death, similar to the epitaphs of ancient Greece.|$|E
5|$|Funerary poems {{were thought}} to {{preserve}} a monarch's soul in death. The Pyramid Texts are the earliest surviving religious literature incorporating poetic verse. These texts do not appear in tombs or pyramids originating before the reign of Unas (r. 2375–2345 BC), who had the Pyramid of Unas built at Saqqara. The Pyramid Texts are chiefly concerned with the function of preserving and nurturing {{the soul of the}} sovereign in the afterlife. This aim eventually included safeguarding both the sovereign and his subjects in the afterlife. A variety of textual traditions evolved from the original Pyramid Texts: the Coffin <b>Texts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Middle Kingdom, the so-called Book of the Dead, Litany of Ra, and Amduat written on papyri from the New Kingdom until the end of ancient Egyptian civilization.|$|E

5|$|Madeline Sylvia Royals {{was born}} on 8 January 1910 in Blackpool, Lancashire. Little is known of her early life, which coincided with Britain's {{involvement}} in the First World War, although she appears {{to have had a}} strained relationship with her parents. Her father, Willie Royals, was an insurance agent, while her mother, Marion Neruda Shaw, was a tailor's daughter from Oldham. Willie and Marion had married on 28 June 1909, followed by Madeline's birth seven months later. In early life, Madeline was afflicted with polio, resulting in a lifelong withered leg and limp. Bedridden for the course of the illness, she read literature to entertain herself, enjoying the works of Edward Bulwer-Lytton, H.Rider Haggard and E.T.A. Hoffman. She also read the Bible in her youth, becoming particularly enamored with the <b>texts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Old Testament, and was convinced that they contained secret messages, a theme that became a central tenet of her later Luciferian beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Oral {{tradition}} holds that, {{because of}} the great value of wood, only expert scribes used it, while pupils wrote on banana leaves. German ethnologist Thomas Barthel believed that carving on wood was a secondary development {{in the evolution of}} the script based on an earlier stage of incising banana leaves or the sheaths of the banana trunk with a bone stylus, and that the medium of leaves was retained not only for lessons but to plan and compose the <b>texts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wooden tablets. He found experimentally that the glyphs were quite visible on banana leaves due to the sap that emerged from the cuts and dried on the surface. However, when the leaves themselves dried they became brittle and would not have survived for long.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Actor Rebellion of 1733, Fielding produced a revised version of The Author's Farce, incorporating a new prologue and epilogue. Performed at the Theatre Royal, it was advertised in the Daily Journal, opening with an inferior replacement cast {{for some of the}} important characters. It was joined by The Intriguing Chambermaid and The Harlot's Progress. These were the only performances of the revised version, which was printed together with The Intriguing Chambermade (1734) and included a letter by an unknown writer, possibly Fielding himself. The 1734 edition of the play was printed in 1750, and it was used for all later publications until 1966. Printed <b>texts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> play were included in Arthur Murphy's 1762 Works of Henry Fielding and George Saintsbury's 1893 Works of Henry Fielding. The latter includes The Author's Farce along with only two other plays. The 1903 Works of Henry Fielding, edited by G. H. Maynadier, included only the first two acts. Only three scenes were included in Alfred Howard's The Beauties of Fielding, which collected passages from Fielding's works. George Saintsbury included The Author's Farce and two other plays in a Fielding collected edition of 1893, but ignored the others.|$|E
