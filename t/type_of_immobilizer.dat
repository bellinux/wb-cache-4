40|$|PURPOSE: To {{review the}} ability <b>of</b> various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> {{external}} <b>immobilizers</b> to restrict cervical spine movement. METHODS: With a systematical review of original scientific articles, data on range <b>of</b> motion, <b>type</b> <b>of</b> used external immobilization device {{and risk of}} bias were extracted. The described external immobilization devices were grouped and the mean restriction percentage and standard deviation were calculated. Finally, each device was classified based {{on its ability to}} restrict movement of the cervical spine, according to five levels of immobilization: poor (MIL /= 80 %). RESULTS: The ability to reduce the range of motion by soft collars was poor in all directions. The ability of cervico-high thoracic devices was moderate for flexion/extension but poor for lateral bending and rotation. The ability of cervico-low thoracic devices to restrict flexion/extension and rotation was moderate, while their ability to restrict lateral bending was poor. All cranio-thoracic devices for non-ambulatory patients restricted cervical spine movement substantial in all directions. The ability of vests with non-invasive skull fixation was substantial in all directions. No studies with healthy adults were identified with respect to cranial traction and halo vests with skull pins and their ability to restrict cervical movement. CONCLUSIONS: Soft collars have a poor ability to reduce mobility of the cervical spine. Cervico-high thoracic devices primarily reduce flexion and extension, but they reduce lateral bending and rotation to a lesser degree. Cervico-low thoracic devices restrict lateral bending to the same extent as cervico-high thoracic devices, but are considerably more effective at restricting flexion, extension, and rotation. Finally, cranio-thoracic devices nearly fully restrict movement of the cervical spine...|$|R

The aim was to {{study the effects of}} a plant growth-promoting bacterial strain in combination with immobilizing soil amendments on plant growth, heavy metal uptake and on microbial community structure. Pot experiments were performed whereby two maize cultivars were grown in different contaminated soils and treatments consisted of Burkholderia phytofirmans strain PsJN with and without addition of gravel sludge and siderite bearing material. Inoculation with strain PsJN significantly improved root and shoot biomass of maize independent <b>of</b> <b>immobilizer</b> addition. Analysis <b>of</b> heavy metal content of the rhizosphere and leaves indicated that immobilizing amendments had significant reducing effects on NH 4 NO 3 extractable Zn and Pb in soil and in plants grown in treated soils. Microbiomes were analysed by cultivation-independent pyrosequencing analysis of 16 S rRNA genes. The results showed clear effects on community composition in response to the immobilizer amendments, whereas inoculation with B.  phytofirmans affected microbiome diversity only to a minor extent...|$|R

40|$|For {{hundreds}} of years slings {{have been used as}} a non-surgical treatment after reduction of dislocated shoulders. Traditionally, with the arm being supported in a sling the affected shoulder is always kept in adduction and internal rotation. The outcome of this non-surgical treatment in terms of preventing recurrence of shoulder dislocations has been poor. Studies have found that the recurrence rate in younger patients can be over 90 %. Recent studies challenged the traditional position of immobilization and demonstrated that anterior dislocated shoulders may be better to be immobilized in external rotation. Two independent research groups: one in Japan and one in Australia, have shown that with the arm in internal rotation, the displacement of the labral tear was seen to be more pronounced. On the contrary, the displacement of the labral tear was seen to be reduced when the arm was placed in external rotation. Moreover, a randomized clinical trial has demonstrated that the recurrence rate of shoulder dislocation with the arm immobilized in external rotation is significantly lower than that with the arm immobilized in internal rotation. With emerging data suggesting that dislocated shoulders should be supported in external rotation to promote healing, different designs <b>of</b> shoulder <b>immobilizers</b> keeping the arm in external rotation have been developed in Japan and the United States. Up till now, these kind <b>of</b> shoulder <b>immobilizers</b> were not found in major aids and splinting catalogues. Patients who have had their dislocated shoulder reduced at the A & E Department of Ruttonjee and Tang Shiu Kin Hospital are referred to the Occupational therapy Department for further treatment. Traditionally, an arm sling is fitted for three weeks, followed by a course of rehabilitation. In April of 2005, an External Rotation Shoulder Immobilizer (in short ERSI) was developed in this OT department. Figure A shows the ERSI:...|$|R
