500|$|According to The Independents Holly Rubenstein, Kaleidoscope Dream is [...] "widely {{considered}} a leading example" [...] of alternative R; Miguel himself {{described it as}} [...] "avant soul". In the opinion of NPR's Frannie Kelley, the record combined R, pop, funk, rock and soul genres. Its music features sparse production, eccentric details, thick bass lines, buzzing synthesizers, and hazy, reverbed sounds. Allmusic's Andy Kellman found the album [...] "funkier and weirder" [...] than All I Want Is You and observed an [...] "illusory atmosphere ... intensified by some unexpected touches". Maura Johnston said much of it [...] "sounds, as the title might suggest, fractal." [...] As an R album, The A.V. Clubs Evan Rytlewski said, Kaleidoscope Dream deviated from genre conventions by minimizing the influence of hip hop; Jim DeRogatis believed it drew heavily on psychedelic rock and psychedelic pop. Music writers compared the album's style to Prince, Alex Macpherson of The Guardian perceives a [...] "headier aesthetic" [...] than on All I Want Is You, with [...] "faded psychedelia" [...] and [...] "intimate experiments in Purple Rain-esque rock". Writing about the record for WNYC, Gretta Cohn claimed Miguel was [...] "redefining what contemporary R can be". Miguel said he [...] "definitely think it's an R record, though other people may not ... are so conditioned to expect certain <b>things</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> current R, and it's about following a formula. But R was once live music, it was psychedelic, it was rock, it was funk, and all these genres stem from soul music ... There would be no hip-hop or rock without R It was {{important for me to}} be true to what R is, and that is soulful." ...|$|E
