5|$|Kemper {{then put}} {{both of the}} women's bodies in <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> Ford Galaxie and {{returned}} to his apartment, being stopped on the way by a police officer for a broken taillight but managing not to be detected for his more serious offences. His roommate was not at home, so he took the bodies into his apartment, where he took pornographic photographs of, and had sex with, the naked corpses before dismembering them. He then put the body parts into plastic bags, which he later abandoned near Loma Prieta Mountain. Before disposing of Pesce's and Luchessa's severed heads in a ravine, Kemper engaged in irrumatio with both of them. In August, Pesce's skull was found up on Loma Prieta Mountain. An extensive search failed to turn up the rest of her remains or a trace of her companion.|$|E
5|$|In February 2013 Tuscaloosa Police arrested four {{football}} {{players from the}} 2012 season: Brent Calloway, Tyler Hayes, D. J. Pettway and Eddie Williams. Williams was involved in four separate incidents on February 10 and 11. On February 10 he had a dispute with a gas station clerk about paying for gas {{and said he had}} to get something in <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> car. The clerk called the police, the police arrested Williams with carrying a pistol without a license, but Williams was released later that day on a $500 bond. Later that night around 12:30a.m., Williams attacked an Alabama student with Hayes and Pettway and they stole the student's backpack. In a separate incident almost an hour later, Williams attacked another student while Hayes and Pettway waited in a car. Later Williams used one of the students' credit cards. Calloway was also arrested after he used a victim's student debit card with knowledge it was stolen. Following the arrests, Alabama suspended all four from the football team. Alabama also prohibited Hayes, Pettway and Williams from entering campus. On February 27, Alabama dismissed all four players from the university after completing a judicial review.|$|E

Pierce sang the theme song featured in the film. Once the film was completed, he put the reel into <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> car and drove to Los Angeles seeking post-production services. He met Jamie Mendoza-Nava, who owned a small post-production company and agreed {{to work on the}} film for limited up-front pay and {{a small percentage of the}} film's box-office receipts. Pierce could not find a major studio willing to distribute it, so he rented a local movie theater in Texarkana for one week to screen the film.

6000|$|In {{this one}} matter, Ahab seemed no {{exception}} to most American whale captains, who, as a set, rather incline to {{the opinion that}} by rights the ship's cabin belongs to them; {{and that it is}} by courtesy alone that anybody else is, at any time, permitted there. So that, in real truth, the mates and harpooneers of the Pequod might more properly be said to have lived out of the cabin than in it. For when they did enter it, it was something as a streetdoor enters a house; turning inwards for a moment, only to be turned out the next; and, as a permanent thing, residing in the open air. Nor did they lose much hereby; in the cabin was no companionship; socially, Ahab was inaccessible. Though nominally included in the census of Christendom, he was still an alien to it. He lived in the world, as the last of the Grisly Bears lived in settled Missouri. And as when Spring and Summer had departed, that wild Logan of the woods, burying himself in the hollow of a tree, lived out the winter there, sucking his own paws; so, in his inclement, howling old age, Ahab's soul, shut up in <b>the</b> caved <b>trunk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> body, there fed upon the sullen paws of its gloom! ...|$|R

25|$|After Gaggi's release, Montiglio {{had become}} a drug addict and fled New York for fear of {{punishment}} from the Gambino family. The FBI dismantled DeMeo's auto theft ring and sent two crew members to prison. In 1980, a third crew member, Vito Arena, became a government witness. In 1982, Arena began testifying about crimes committed by Gaggi and the DeMeo crew.

Grady is unable to tell Sara of this incident as she is pressuring him to choose between her and Emily. As a result, Grady is forced to keep the dead dog in <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> car for most of the weekend. He also allows James to follow him around, fearing that he may be depressed or even suicidal.

40|$|Excerpt: 2 ̆ 2 Sugaring 2 ̆ 2 and {{attraction}} to artificial light {{have long been}} favorite methods of collecting adults of the genus Catocala, and both have been very successful. Each of the many collectors who uses the English method of applying bait to <b>the</b> <b>trunks</b> <b>of</b> trees has <b>his</b> own preferred mixture. Usually molasses is the base, and fragrance is the measure. Feed molasses is widely used in this country, augmented by various combinations of beer, rum, aromatic oils and decaying fruits. Temperature, humidity, wind and amount of moonlight are all well-known factors affecting the success of 2 ̆ 2 bait, 2 ̆ 2 whether applied according to the old method or used in the modern variant of bait-traps. The advent of ultra-violet and mercury-vapor light has been a boon to students of this genus.

Experienced. lepidopterists insist that some species are not attracted to one or the other, but the phenomenon has not at all been carefully studied...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND:Although open {{injuries}} {{involving the}} brachial plexus are relatively uncommon, they {{can lead to}} permanent disability and even be life threatening if accompanied by vascular damage. We present a case report of a brachial plexus injury in which {{the urgency of the}} situation precluded the use of any ancillary diagnostic examinations and forced a rapid clinical assessment. CASE PRESENTATION: We report a case of a Portuguese man who had a stabbing injury at the base <b>of</b> <b>his</b> left axilla. On observation in our emergency room an acute venous type of bleeding was present at the wound site and, as a result of refractory hypotension after initial management with fluids administered intravenously, he was immediately carried to our operating room. During the course of transportation, we observed that he presented hypoesthesia of the medial aspect <b>of</b> <b>his</b> arm and forearm, {{as well as of the}} ulnar side <b>of</b> <b>his</b> hand and <b>of</b> the palmar aspect of the last three digits and of the dorsal aspect of the last two digits. Moreover, he was not able to actively flex the joints <b>of</b> <b>his</b> middle, ring, and small fingers or to adduct or abduct all fingers. Exclusively relying on our anatomical knowledge of the axillary region, the site of the stabbing wound, and the physical neurologic examination, we were able to unequivocally pinpoint the place of the injury between the anterior division <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower <b>trunk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> brachial plexus and the proximal portion of the following nerves: ulnar, medial cutaneous <b>of</b> <b>his</b> arm and forearm, and the medial aspect <b>of</b> <b>his</b> median nerve. Surgery revealed a longitudinal laceration of the posterior aspect <b>of</b> <b>his</b> axillary vein, and confirmed a complete section <b>of</b> <b>his</b> ulnar nerve, his medial brachial and antebrachial cutaneous nerves, and an incomplete section of the ulnar aspect <b>of</b> <b>his</b> median nerve. All structures were repaired microsurgically. Three years after the surgery he showed a good functional outcome. CONCLUSIONS: We believe that this case report illustrates the relevance of a sound anatomical knowledge of the brachial plexus in an emergency setting. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
500|$|On {{the evening}} of September 14, 1972, Kemper picked up 15-year-old Korean dance student Aiko Koo, who had decided to {{hitchhike}} to a dance class after missing her bus. He again drove to a remote area, brandishing a gun on Koo before accidentally locking himself out of his car. However, Koo let him back inside (Kemper had previously gained the 15-year-old's trust while holding her at gunpoint) where he proceeded to choke her unconscious, rape her and kill her. He subsequently packed her body into <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> car, had a few drinks at a nearby bar, then exited the bar and opened his trunk, [...] "admiring [...] catch like a fisherman," [...] {{and returned to his}} apartment.

500|$|In 2002, the Salt Lake Tribune {{interviewed the}} mayor of Richfield about the change I-70 brought to the Sevier Valley. Previously these were {{isolated}} farming communities, whose residents felt they were unaccustomed to the crime and other effects that a transcontinental highway can bring. Residents of Richfield soon started to call I-70 [...] "Cocaine Lane". [...] The mayor stated that I-70 is a mixed blessing. He stated the highway is a boon to the hospitality industry and has made Richfield more accessible to other cities. However, the new road brought types of crime previously unknown to the city. The mayor lamented that {{after the completion of}} I-70, many residents started locking their doors for the first time. The interview resulted from an event that served as a [...] "wake-up call", that rural Utah is [...] "not isolated from crime". Panic ensued after the public witnessed Utah Highway Patrol troopers carrying away a suspect in handcuffs, while removing plastic bags and coolers full of body parts from <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> car. The event caused a frenzy of people checking on their neighbors, fearing the murder victims were local residents.

500|$|The {{team working}} on the film {{commuted}} between the project and the series, pushing both to scheduling extremes (changes to Bigger, Longer & Uncut were made as late as two weeks before its release) and fighting constantly with Paramount. [...] "They wanted a Disney kind of trailer. We said no. They put together a totally un-South Park MTV video for the song 'What Would Brian Boitano Do?'. We had to go make our own version."

Parker and Stone told the studio of their dissatisfaction with the trailer, and upon the creation of a second trailer with minimal changes, the two broke the videocassette in half and sent it back in its original envelope. [...] "It was war," [...] said Stone in 2000. [...] "They were saying, 'Are you telling us how to do our job?' And I was going, 'Yes, because you're fucking stupid and you don't know what you're doing.'" [...] In another instance, Paramount took the songs from the film and created a music video to be aired on MTV. In accordance with broadcast standards, the studio cut various [...] "R-rated" [...] parts out and edited it into what Parker described as a [...] "horrible little medley with all humor absent". The studio sent the original tape to Parker and Stone over a weekend, with plans to send it to MTV on Monday to prepare it for airtime beginning Wednesday. Stone instead put the tape in <b>the</b> <b>trunk</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> car and went home. Paramount threatened to sue Parker and Stone in response.
