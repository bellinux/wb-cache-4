5|$|Collectively, {{the group}} wrote around 40 new {{compositions}} in Rishikesh, 26 {{of which would}} be recorded in very rough form at Kinfauns, Harrison's home in Esher, in May 1968. Lennon wrote the bulk of the new material, contributing 14 songs. Lennon and McCartney brought home-recorded demos to the session, and worked on <b>them</b> <b>together.</b> Some home demos and group sessions at Kinfauns were later released on the 1996 compilation Anthology 3.|$|E

5|$|In the episode, Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{attempts}} to avoid running into Wesley Snipes (Sheen) after {{they fail to}} hit it off in their first encounter, but fate seems to want <b>them</b> <b>together.</b> At the same time, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) deals with the impending purchase of NBC. Finally, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) does damage control after his former nanny publishes a tell-all book.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the reason}} people rarely talk about his {{formidable}} attributes as a singer is that he makes so little fuss about them. That celebrated ease of his has been too little understood. Ease in any art {{is the result of}} mastery over the details of the craft. You get <b>them</b> <b>together</b> {{to the point where you}} can forget about how you do things and concentrate on what you are doing. Como got <b>them</b> <b>together</b> so completely that the muscles don't even show. It seems effortless, but a good deal of effort has gone into making it seem so. Como is known to be meticulous about rehearsal of the material for an album. He tries things out in different keys, gives the song thought, makes suggestions, tries it again, and again, until he is satisfied. The hidden work makes him look like Mr. Casual, and too many people are taken in by it â€” but happily so.|$|E
5|$|Samson went out, {{gathered}} 300 foxes, {{and tied}} <b>them</b> <b>together</b> in pairs by their tails. He then attached a burning torch to {{each pair of}} foxes' tails and turned them loose in the grain fields and olive groves of the Philistines. The Philistines learned why Samson burned their crops and burned Samson's wife and father-in-law to death in retribution.|$|E

5|$|Several reviewers {{compared}} Tipping the Velvet to Jeanette Winterson's Oranges Are Not the Only Fruit for {{a similar}} story of a woman's sexual awakening. Waters credits Winterson as an influence in lesbian writing, but states that the books are quite different and her writing is not like Winterson's at all. Waters suggests that reviewers have bracketed <b>them</b> <b>together</b> because Winterson {{was the only other}} lesbian author they could recall.|$|E
5|$|The group {{ran through}} {{two weeks of}} rehearsals using The Rolling Stones' {{basement}} studio in Bermondsey. They had not intended to record a single continuous piece; the band came up with individual song segments, then decided to write short pieces of music to link <b>them</b> <b>together.</b>|$|E
5|$|To combat {{pathogens}} that replicate outside cells, antibodies bind to pathogens to link <b>them</b> <b>together,</b> {{causing them}} to agglutinate. Since an antibody has at least two paratopes, it can bind more than one antigen by binding identical epitopes carried on the surfaces of these antigens. By coating the pathogen, antibodies stimulate effector functions against the pathogen in cells that recognize their Fc region.|$|E

5|$|Weaver ant (Oecophylla spp.) workers build nests {{in trees}} by {{attaching}} leaves together, first pulling <b>them</b> <b>together</b> with bridges {{of workers and}} then inducing their larvae to produce silk as they are moved along the leaf edges. Similar forms of nest construction are seen in some species of Polyrhachis.|$|E
5|$|Working as an {{additional}} producer, Don Was helped keep Weiland's {{and the rest of}} the band's separate recording sessions in sync by bringing <b>them</b> <b>together</b> to perform live. When the band performed together, they would do so acoustically, so each member could hear the nuances of the songs. Weiland credited Was for helping Stone Temple Pilots re-learn how to play together again. Was also worked closely with Weiland during the recording of the vocals.|$|E
5|$|A {{water polo}} tournament {{was held on}} the Seine on 11 and 12 August 1900 {{as part of the}} 1900 Summer Olympics. Eight teams from four countries, all European, entered the event, {{although}} only seven ended up playing. The Osborne Swimming Club of Manchester, England, which has been listed with two rosters that are nearly entirely different, became the first Olympic water polo champions by defeating the Brussels Swimming and Water Polo Club of Belgium. Third place went to the two French-based semi-finalists, Libellule de Paris and Pupilles de Neptune de Lille, the latter of whom entered two teams, but merged <b>them</b> <b>together</b> after the first round.|$|E

5|$|Another common process, {{explosion}} welding, {{involves the}} joining of materials by pushing <b>them</b> <b>together</b> under extremely high pressure. The {{energy from the}} impact plasticizes the materials, forming a weld, even though only {{a limited amount of}} heat is generated. The process is commonly used for welding dissimilar materials, such as the welding of aluminum with steel in ship hulls or compound plates. Other solid-state welding processes include friction welding (including friction stir welding), magnetic pulse welding, co-extrusion welding, cold welding, diffusion bonding, exothermic welding, high frequency welding, hot pressure welding, induction welding, and roll welding.|$|E
5|$|At {{a school}} dance, Sean persuades Dallas {{to make peace}} with Clay while Clay dances with Chelsea. Spencer convinces Ashley to come despite her disdain for school dances, but when Madison sees <b>them</b> <b>together,</b> she alleges that Spencer is gay and kicks Spencer off the cheerleading squad. It is {{revealed}} that Ashley was once pregnant by Aiden and lost the baby in a miscarriage, and when Glen tries to force Spencer to leave, another fight breaks out between him and Aiden. Spencer and Ashley flee the dance with Aiden and end up at a lookout over LA.|$|E
5|$|Azar and {{a healer}} provide {{alternative}} treatment for Waterston, who fully recovers. He announces {{that he still}} wants a relationship with Scully, but she realizes {{she is no longer}} the same person she was those many years ago and rejects him. As she sits outside the hospital on a bench, Scully thinks that she sees the mysterious woman again, but {{it turns out to be}} Mulder. Later, the two agents sit in Mulder's apartment talking about the events of the last few days. Mulder begins to speak more existentially about what transpired, implying that fate has brought <b>them</b> <b>together</b> but, when he turns to look at Scully, he sees that she has fallen asleep.|$|E

5|$|Coastal Command {{had agreed}} to provide three {{squadron}}s of Bristol Beaufort torpedo bombers. The Fleet Air Arm (FAA) contributed one squadron of Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers. RAF Bomber Command had some 300 bombers on standby for any operation. There were problems, however. The Swordfish were very slow, and fighter escort of the aircraft was difficult. The Beaufort squadrons were all spread out and {{it was difficult to}} bring <b>them</b> <b>together.</b> One squadron was based at Leuchers, Scotland, one at Thorney Island, Portsmouth, England, and one near St Eval, Cornwall, England.|$|E
5|$|Dolphin drive hunting, {{also called}} dolphin drive fishing, {{is a method}} of hunting {{dolphins}} and occasionally other small cetaceans by driving <b>them</b> <b>together</b> with boats and then usually into a bay or onto a beach. Their escape is prevented by closing off the route to the open sea or ocean with boats and nets. Dolphins are hunted this way in several places around the world, including the Solomon Islands, the Faroe Islands, Peru, and Japan, the most well-known practitioner of this method. By numbers, dolphins are mostly hunted for their meat; some end up in dolphinariums.|$|E
5|$|Dor makes {{a strong}} feminist {{statement}} without being strident or shouting slogans. And all along, the riveting friendship {{between the two}} polarized women and the events that bring <b>them</b> <b>together,</b> keep tugging at your heart. Shreyas Talpade proves that (his previous film), Iqbal was no accident and Gul Panag gives {{one of the most}} convincing portrayals of her career. But, it is Ayesha Takia who simply blows your breath away. Her journey from joyous subjugation â€” where she is content to dance before her husband and be at the beck and call of her in-laws â€” to silent emancipation is absolutely endearing.|$|E
