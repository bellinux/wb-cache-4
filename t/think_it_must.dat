500|$|The Monster {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from contemporary critics. [...] Before its publication, Crane's friend Joseph Conrad wrote while {{responding to a}} partial draft: [...] "the damned story has been haunting me... I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be fine." [...] William Dean Howells, an early champion of Crane, proclaimed the novella to be [...] "the greatest short story ever written by an American". [...] The Spectator concluded that The Monster alone would have cemented Crane's literary reputation; its reviewer wrote, [...] "If Mr. Crane had never written anything else, he would have earned the right of remembrance by this story alone." ...|$|E
500|$|Constantine {{was awarded}} a life peerage in 1969, {{becoming}} the first black man {{to sit in the}} House of Lords; there were rumours that Trinidad had prevented earlier attempts to ennoble him. He took the title of Baron Constantine of Maraval in Trinidad and Nelson in the County Palatine of Lancaster. His investiture attracted widespread media attention; Constantine stated: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> have been for what I have endeavoured to do {{to make it possible for}} people of different colour to know each other better and live well together." [...] He sat as a crossbencher in the House, but was well enough to make only one speech in his time there.|$|E

5000|$|The author {{begins by}} telling us {{he has made}} this story up, but that even so, he <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> have {{actually}} happened—on Christmas Eve, in a great town, {{at a time of}} terrible frost.|$|R
500|$|... "I am now {{thirty miles}} above Lawrence on the Kansas River {{assisting}} in {{starting a new}} town. We are just about in the central portion of the [...] "settled" [...] Territory and with perhaps the best landing and the most eligible site for a city in the entire country. ... So I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be, {{and in a few}} years when civilization by its magic influence shall have transformed this glorious country from what it is now to the brilliant destiny awaiting it, the Sun in all his course will visit no land more truly lovely and desirable than this. Here, Mary, with God's kind permission, we will make our home; and I have every reason to believe a home it will truly be." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{premise of}} the episode {{originated}} from an idea that executive producer and series creator Chris Carter had about a pyramid scheme involving body parts. Writer Jeff Vlaming combined two additional concepts that he had developed; the first involved a lottery {{in a small town}} and the other concerned corporate beings assembling the destitute in Chinatown. When the initial script for [...] "Hell Money" [...] was submitted, Carter merged the three stories into one. Entertainment Weekly later noted that [...] "the twisted grotesquery of this story makes you <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be based on a true story", but, according to Carter, the story was completely original. Vlaming had originally hoped that the episode {{would be one of the}} rare entries where Scully's version of the events would be vindicated, but in the end Mulder, once again, put everything together.|$|E
2500|$|..... I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> {{have been}} the final and terrible anxiety that tipped the beam with Phillips, for he {{suddenly}} slipped down, sitting in the water, and though we held his head up, he never recovered. I insisted on taking him into the lifeboat with us, hoping there still might be life, {{but it was too}} late." ...|$|E
60|$|With that kiss {{they enter}} {{a new life}} whereinto one may not follow them. One <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> have been a life made strangely {{beautiful}} by self-forgetfulness, strangely sweet by mutual devotion--a life too ideal, perhaps, to have remained for long undimmed by the mists of earth.|$|R

She {{would tell her}} surmise to no one but Johnnie, who had persuaded Mr. Fotheringham to lift him from horseback, where he was never at ease with any one but papa. He looked up smiling: 'Helen <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be Uncle Martindale, because papa is so glad.' ...|$|R

As he slumbers, Eurilla enters with a garland of flowers with a note [...] "From someone who adores you and is waiting for you there" [...] and places it on his body. When he awakes, he <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be from Amarilli.|$|R
2500|$|... "They all {{aspired to}} be Ben. The resourcefulness of his mind, his {{vitality}} were so enormous. His knowledge. His talent and ambition. He could tear through things, and he tore through life. They'd see this prodigious output of Ben's, and they'd think, 'Oh, hell, I'm a bum.' I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> have been devastating. Ben did it to MacArthur, who died in time to save his reputation. And I'd hate to have been Herman , caught between Kaufman and Hecht." ...|$|E
2500|$|British {{menswear}} designer, Kim Jones, remembers {{collaborating with}} Smalley: [...] "I remember shooting {{in an old}} Amish village with Luke during the winter— I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> have been 15 degrees. The model, Ambrose Olsen, was freezing and shaking in the cold— he later {{told me that he}} wouldn’t have done it for anyone else except Luke because he was such a great guy." [...] He continued, [...] "Luke cared so much about everything in his work that everyone involved wanted to make anything happen for him. He was such a great talent who was underestimated by many, but I’m sure future generations will appreciate everything he’s done." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 4 July 1994, Václav Havel {{was awarded}} the Philadelphia Liberty Medal. In his {{acceptance}} speech, he said: [...] "The idea {{of human rights and}} freedoms must {{be an integral part of}} any meaningful world order. Yet I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be anchored in a different place, and in a different way, than has been the case so far. If it is to be more than just a slogan mocked by half the world, it cannot be expressed in the language of departing era, and it must not be mere froth floating on the subsiding waters of faith in a purely scientific relationship to the world." ...|$|E

"How long D 21 {{stood at}} that {{particular}} corner he could not exactly say, but he <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> have been three or four minutes before he noticed a suspicious-looking individual shambling along {{under the shadow of}} the garden walls.

60|$|The {{clouds are}} flying fast overhead: and sharp and {{isolated}} come drops of rain, {{so that one}} <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be spray. But no, it is a handful of rain. The ship swishes and sinks forward, gives a hollow thudding and rears slowly backward, along this pinkish lofty coast of Sicily that is just retreating into a bay. From the open sea comes the rain, come the long waves.|$|R

50|$|Silla regrets the {{necessity}} of leaving Rome without satisfying his desires towards either Celia or Flavia. He attempts to seduce Celia again, but she repulses him and he informs her that her beloved Claudio has been torn alive by wild beasts and leaves her. Celia laments her lover's death and hears an echo of her words - it is Claudio himself, who has been listening. At first she <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be a ghost, but she is then overjoyed to be re-united with the living Claudio.|$|R

50|$|When Lupe's {{symptoms}} worsen and her organs {{begin to}} shut down, Foreman {{and the team}} suspect autoimmune disease to be the culprit. When treatment does not work (symptoms worsen), the team <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> <b>must</b> be cancer. Foreman presses for a full-body radiation treatment. However, severe pain after the radiation leads the team to the final, correct diagnosis: an infection. The radiation treatment has destroyed Lupe's immune system {{and there is nothing}} anybody can do to save her. Foreman tells her the news and helps her cope with it.|$|R
