Discussing the rarity of international governing bodies within Islam, Cleary asked where Sharia fits into that and Yasin replied: [...] "Well the Sharia is the cement that keeps all the bricks together. The Sharia is the legislative element. The Sharia is the judicial element. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> rules, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> juristic decisions, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> the courts, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> law <b>is.</b> And I {{mean if you}} don't have a people that is governed by Sharia, {{then you have a}} lawless people." ...|$|R

25|$|Work on the {{construction}} of the Palazzo del Capitano del Popolo began in the 13th century on an area that had been occupied since 1157 by the papal palace built under the reign of Pope Hadrian IV. The original Palazzo del Capitano was a single ground-floor loggia that was used as a market place or for meetings, from which the magistrate would speak to the citizens. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>where</b> the surrounding lords or representatives of vanquished cities came to pay their allegiance to Orvieto.|$|E
25|$|Both Roman basilicas and Roman bath houses had {{at their}} core a large vaulted {{building}} with a high roof, braced on either side {{by a series of}} lower chambers or a wide arcade passage. An important feature of the Roman basilica was that at either end it had a projecting exedra, or apse, a semicircular space roofed with a half-dome. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>where</b> the magistrates sat to hold court. It passed into the church architecture of the Roman world and was adapted in different ways as a feature of cathedral architecture.|$|E

25|$|Galen {{believed}} {{there to be}} no distinction between the mental and the physical. This was a controversial argument of the time, and Galen fell with the Greeks in believing that the mind and body were not separate faculties. He believed {{that this could be}} scientifically proven. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>where</b> his opposition to the Stoics became most prevalent. Galen proposed organs within the body to be responsible for specific functions, rather than individual parts. According to Galen, the Stoics' lack of scientific justification discredited their claims of the separateness of mind and body, which is why he spoke so strongly against them.|$|E
25|$|Also {{referred}} to as the Panhandle or Inside Passage, this is the region of Alaska closest {{to the rest of the}} United States. As such, <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>where</b> most of the initial non-indigenous settlement occurred in the years following the Alaska Purchase. The region is dominated by the Alexander Archipelago as well as the Tongass National Forest, the largest national forest in the United States. It contains the state capital Juneau, the former capital Sitka, and Ketchikan, at one time Alaska's largest city. The Alaska Marine Highway provides a vital surface transportation link throughout the area, as only three communities (Haines, Hyder and Skagway) enjoy direct connections to the contiguous North American road system. Officially designated in 1963.|$|E

Introducing his work, Piazzolla played her a number of his classically inspired compositions, {{but it was not until}} he played his tango Triunfal that she congratulated him and encouraged him to pursue his career in tango, recognising that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>where</b> his talent lay.

Webb and Russell themselves did not want the rescuers to attempt to reach them through the rubble, because to do so would require them to cut through the wire on the side of the cage, which was under considerable pressure from the rock above. The two men were afraid that cutting the cage would cause it to collapse.|$|E
25|$|In 1915, Ord was a {{military}} aide {{on the staff of}} the governor of Arizona. He was also a liaison with Army unit that included his former regiment. He saw service on the Mexican border due to the rise of tension along the border following the Battle of Agua Prieta. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>where</b> Pancho Villa sustained his greatest defeat and his units were disorganized and wandered around northern Mexico foraging for supplies. Desperate for food and fresh horses, Pancho Villa camped his army of an estimated 500 horsemen outside of Columbus, New Mexico on the Mexican side of the border in March 1916. On March 9, 1916, he invaded the United States for supplies and arms which resulted in the Battle of Columbus. Ord had been given the rank of Major and served Arizona well in organizing and arming militia units. No major raids across the border took place in Arizona.|$|E
