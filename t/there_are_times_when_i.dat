He avoided {{explicitly}} mentioning {{his views on}} The Tonight Show, saying he [...] "hates to be pinned down", as that would [...] "hurt me as an entertainer, which is what I am." [...] As he explained in 1970, [...] "In my living room I would argue for liberalization of abortion laws, divorce laws, and <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> would like to express a view on the air. I {{would love to have}} taken on Billy Graham. But I'm on TV five nights a week; I have nothing to gain by it and everything to lose." [...] He also seldom invited political figures onto the Tonight Show because he [...] "didn't want it to become a political forum" [...] and did not want the show used, by himself or others, to influence the opinions of the viewers.|$|E
2500|$|Nozomi {{continued}} to enjoy sex {{both within and}} outside of the AV setting, and stated that she did not mind having it every day. Nevertheless, the intense pace of her career was beginning to tire her. She had been making up to ten videos a month, and expressed fatigue with the AV work both in interviews and in private conversations. She told an interviewer, [...] "...it {{was a lot of fun}} at first, but I'm really tired nowadays. To tell you the truth, I think I'm over-exerting myself right now. So I want to take a decent vacation rather than get paid." [...] She continued, [...] "Like I said before, I enjoy the shoots a lot. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> think it's hard and tiring, but the fun part is a lot greater!" [...] A friend later reported that Nozomi was planning to get married, quit the AV industry and become a stage actress. Nozomi also formed an idol musical group with some other AV idols and released a musical CD in 2002.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2011, TobyMac {{stated that}} a reunion tour would {{probably}} happen [...] "sooner or later". He mentioned talking with Michael and Kevin about [...] "when it should be" [...] and [...] "what it could look like." [...] Fans {{hoping for a}} reunion tour {{in the near future}} may be disappointed: [...] "Right now, I think we're really just enjoying the mountain we're climbing, each of us individually. It's never been a completely closed door. We've always sort of laughed about it, smiled about it. It's timing, I guess." [...] On May 28 and 29, 2011, at the Big Church Day Out in Wiston, UK, TobyMac joined the Newsboys twice to perform [...] "Jesus Freak", and Michael sang [...] "In the Light" [...] on both days with Toby's band, Diverse City. In June 2011 Toby admitted that he thought about Kevin and Michael for every song that he writes. His song [...] "Wonderin'" [...] is about his past with Kevin and Michael in DC Talk. [...] "It's just a warm look back at DC Talk," [...] says Toby, almost wistfully. [...] "It's reminiscing about Michael and Kevin and what we did together, and recognizing their influence on me. I love what I do today, but <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> wonder, What if we stayed together? I've got these dreams I'm pursuing now, but are they stealing me from you?" [...] On June 7, 2011, Back 2 Back Hits, featuring songs off Jesus Freak and Supernatural, was released.|$|E
