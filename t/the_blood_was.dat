The detectives, suspicious of Frank due to his nervous behavior throughout his interviews, believed that Frank had arranged the plant.|$|E
5|$|The {{blood that}} spurts {{out of the}} Klingon's wounds was created using {{computer}} generated imagery; the animators {{had to make sure}} that the blood floated in a convincing manner while still looking interesting and not too gory. The effects artist looked at NASA footage of floating globules of water to inform the physics of the blood particles. Initially, <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>was</b> to be colored green, but the filmmakers realized that McCoy had referred to Spock as green-blooded.|$|E
5|$|Instead of {{alerting}} the police, {{the family}} took the silencer to Boutflour's sister's home. Boutflour said it felt sticky. They found red paint and blood on it, {{and the surface}} of it had been damaged. When the police collected the silencer from them on 12 August, {{five days after the}} murders, an officer reportedly noticed an inch-long grey hair attached to it, but this had gone by the time the silencer arrived at the Forensic Science Service at Huntingdon. A scientist at the Forensic Science Laboratory, Mr. Hayward, found blood on the inside and outside surface of the silencer, the latter not enough to permit analysis. The blood inside was found to be the same blood group as Sheila's, although {{it could have been a}} mixture of Nevill's and June's. A firearms expert, a Mr. Fletcher, said <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>was</b> backspatter, caused by a close-contact shooting.|$|E
50|$|For example, if {{antibodies}} {{that bind}} <b>the</b> A <b>blood</b> group <b>are</b> added and agglutination occurs, <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>is</b> either type A or type AB. To determine between type A or type AB, antibodies that bind the B group are added and if agglutination {{does not occur}}, <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>is</b> type A. If agglutination does not occur with either antibodies that bind to type A or type B antigens, then neither antigen <b>is</b> present on <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> cells, which means <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>is</b> type O.|$|R

5000|$|The {{calculation}} of the arterial and venous oxygen concentration of <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>is</b> a straightforward process.

Measuring <b>the</b> content of hemoglobin in <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> and <b>the</b> percentage of saturation of hemoglobin (the oxygen saturation of <b>the</b> <b>blood)</b> <b>is</b> a simple process and is readily available to physicians. Using the fact that each gram of hemoglobin can carry 1.34 ml of O2, the oxygen content of <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> (either arterial or venous) can be estimated by the following formula: ...|$|R
5|$|Xenosaga Episode III {{was officially}} {{announced}} in 2005, alongside Xenosaga I & II—a Nintendo DS {{remake of the}} first two Xenosaga episodes—and Baten Kaitos Origins. With its announcement, it was widely confirmed that it would be the last installment in the Xenosaga series. While Episode III was intended as the conclusion of Shion's story arc and potentially the series, the team were willing to continue the series if the game was a commercial success. The game was announced for a western release in April 2006. For its western release, all scenes where blood was visible were censored: <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>was</b> removed, but all other elements remained unchanged, resulting in visual and audio inconsistencies. The game released in Japan on July 6, 2006 by Namco; in North America, the game released on August 29 of that year by Namco Bandai Games. The game was localized for the West by Namco Bandai and 8-4; Xenosaga Episode III was one of 8-4's earliest projects. English dubbing was handled by Cup of Tea Productions, who had previously worked on Episode II. Several original voice actors from Episode I, including KOS-MOS's original English actress Bridget Hoffman, were brought back after the recasting for Episode II. Unlike Episode II, Episode III was not released in Europe.|$|E

40|$|Determination of <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> {{group in}} puterfied corpses and burned bodies is {{important}} for identification of individual body. In these cases determination of <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> group <b>is</b> not always easy by the absorption test or the elution test, because <b>the</b> heart <b>blood</b> <b>is</b> putrefied or altered. We have recognized that in putrefied corpses <b>the</b> aorta <b>blood</b> remains color of oxyhemoglobin, although <b>the</b> heart <b>blood</b> <b>is</b> hemolytic by putrefaction or fire, <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> group <b>is</b> able to be determined from <b>the</b> aorta <b>blood</b> by <b>the</b> direct method. 1. On 5 putrefied cases without intact red cells in the heart or aorta <b>blood</b> <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> group <b>is</b> determined by the absorption test from <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> stain of <b>the</b> heart or aorta blood.
