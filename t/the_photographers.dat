5|$|Within {{the first}} year of its launch photographers like Brett Ratner were {{volunteering}} to shoot for the magazine. As of 2014, Duran, Mark Seliger, Ben Watts, Josh Ryan, and Bob Carlos Clarke are among <b>the</b> <b>photographers</b> who have been featured in the magazine.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} June 1860, Rossier was in Shanghai, and it {{is likely}} that he visited the city in an attempt to gain {{permission}} to accompany the Anglo-French military expedition that had already arrived in northern China and thereby fulfill his commission to document the Second Opium War. If so, he was unsuccessful; both forces had already hired photographers to document the mission. The British forces were accompanied by <b>the</b> <b>photographers</b> Felice Beato and John Papillon, and the French by Antoine Fauchery, Lieutenant-Colonel Du Pin, and possibly also by Louis Legrand. Although Rossier failed even to embark on the mission he had been hired to document, he remained in East Asia for some time longer.|$|E
5|$|Medical {{photography}} {{continued to}} develop, both in France and abroad, after the Nadar images were shot. In Europe, several further cases of intersexuality were documented, {{although there is}} no evidence that <b>the</b> <b>photographers</b> were aware of Nadar's work. In April 1870 a Monsieur Delacroix presented photographs of an intersex individual at the Société Médicale de Reims. In 1930 German physician Magnus Hirschfeld published a portrait of himself with an intersex individual in his five-volume Geschlechtskunde (Sexology), while Louis Ombrédanne published 25 images of cases he had handled in his 1939 book Les hermaphrodites et la chirurgie (Hermaphrodites and Surgery).|$|E
50|$|The film is {{narrated by}} <b>the</b> <b>photographer.</b> Interactions between <b>the</b> <b>photographer,</b> his wife, and their driver were largely improvised.|$|R
50|$|The {{story is}} told almost entirely from only three locations: In Armenia, at <b>the</b> <b>photographer's</b> dining room in Toronto, and by <b>the</b> <b>photographer's</b> {{answering}} machine.|$|R
5|$|In recent years, Gair {{has added}} {{photography}} to her professional skills. In {{addition to being}} <b>the</b> <b>photographer</b> of Paint A 'Licious, she has been <b>the</b> <b>photographer</b> in some years of her Sports Illustrated work. For example, she was <b>the</b> <b>photographer</b> of Heidi Klum in 2006. At the end of 2007, Gair was using a Canon 5D camera.|$|R
5|$|All of the film's {{special effect}} {{sequences}} were filmed in camera, with no use of post production effects. In several scenes of Jacob's Ladder, Lyne used a body horror technique {{in which an}} actor is recorded waving his head around at a low frame rate, resulting in horrifically fast motion when played back. In the Special Edition's commentary track, Lyne said he {{was inspired by the}} art of the painter Francis Bacon when developing the effect. In his screenplay, Rubin used traditional imagery of demons and hell. However, Lyne decided to use images similar to thalidomide deformities to achieve a greater shock effect. After many heated arguments, Lyne managed to convert Rubin to his vision. Lyne and Rubin used the works of the artist H. R. Giger and <b>the</b> <b>photographers</b> Diane Arbus and Joel-Peter Witkin for inspiration; another influence came from the Brothers Quay's 1986 stop motion short film Street of Crocodiles.|$|E
5|$|Although {{women were}} allowed to serve coffee and provide first aid in the late 1960s, in 1974 they were officially banned from both Cut and Stack. The ban was {{partially}} rescinded in 1979, when women were again allowed to participate in Cut, and completely rescinded in 1981. Few women participated in the early years, as female volunteers were subject to verbal abuse from their male counterparts. In 1987, two female photographers from the school yearbook alleged that male workers shouted obscenities and threw dirt on them {{as they tried to}} take pictures of the raising of the center pole. The redpots responded that women were always welcome to participate as long as they did their share of the work, and that <b>the</b> <b>photographers</b> were standing dangerously close to the stack. To find their own place in the Bonfire hierarchy, female students founded the all-female Bonfire Reload Crew to provide refreshments to those working at Cut and Stack.|$|E
5|$|Her second book, Body Painting, {{includes}} seventy-five {{works and}} some of <b>the</b> <b>photographers</b> involved were Annie Leibovitz, Herb Ritts and David LaChapelle. The book includes many works from Gair's Auckland Museum exhibition as well as selected Swimsuit Issue images. Former model and current First Lady of France, Carla Bruni, was a subject of the book. Several Heidi Klum photos are included from various photo shoots, including the 1991 Shape magazine tenth anniversary shoot. Several photos of Demi Moore also appear including alternate photos from the Kauai, Hawaii portion of the 1992 Demi's Birthday Suit week of shooting as well as both photos of her 1994 pregnancy with Tallulah Belle Willis and subsequent 1995 Barbie body paintings. A photo from the Disappearing Model work from Ripley's Believe It or Not? is also included. The book also includes magazine work such as a May 1990 Fame shoot with Goldie Hawn and Matthew Rolston and a November 1998 Interview shoot with Pamela Anderson and David LaChapelle {{as well as some}} Pirelli calendar work with Herb Ritts, Carolyn Murphy and Alek Wek.|$|E
50|$|On the shoot, Ruby is okay; Ajoh impresses, but {{gets the}} one-look {{criticism}} again; Victoria tried too hard; Rhiannon was stiff; <b>the</b> <b>photographer</b> really struggled with Lucy; Christobelle was <b>the</b> <b>photographer’s</b> favorite; Teryl-Leigh didn’t bring enough in her eyes; Laura was effortlessly graceful; Hosanna surprised and Rebecca-Rose did well. Overall, <b>the</b> <b>photographer</b> {{was surprised and}} pleased with everyone.|$|R
50|$|The {{scenes in}} the dining room feature <b>the</b> <b>photographer</b> having dinner with women from the escort agency. Each date follows almost exactly the same pattern: <b>The</b> <b>photographer</b> and his date {{converse}} briefly, <b>the</b> <b>photographer</b> pours <b>the</b> wine, and the date excuses herself to use the telephone in the next room while <b>the</b> <b>photographer</b> listens. It is revealed on the last date that this pattern was set up prior to each date, and that this is his way of finding a woman who sounds like his wife, although his motives for doing so are left ambiguous.|$|R
50|$|Depending {{on local}} laws, the model or <b>the</b> <b>photographer</b> might agree {{to limit the}} use of {{pictures}} from a shoot. The model may agree to only use specifically agreed pictures on online portfolios (to avoid sub-standard pictures that damage <b>the</b> <b>photographer's</b> reputation), or <b>the</b> <b>photographer</b> may agree to only use certain images in printed publications {{and not on the}} internet.|$|R
5|$|The {{music video}} is eight minutes long. Swedish actor Alexander Skarsgård plays Gaga's boyfriend. The video {{features}} a murderous plot line involving a doomed starlet who is constantly followed by photographers. The video {{opens with a}} shot of a seaside mansion, where Gaga and her boyfriend are shown lying on a bed talking in Swedish. They move to the balcony and start making out; however, when hidden photographers start taking pictures of them, Gaga realizes that her boyfriend has set the paparazzi to photograph her and tries to stop him. Her struggles nevertheless remain futile even when she punches him, and in a final frantic attempt at defense, she smashes a nearby bottle of liquor into his face. The enraged boyfriend throws her over the balcony. Gaga lies {{on the ground in}} her own blood as <b>the</b> <b>photographers</b> continue take pictures of her bloody body and tabloid headlines proclaim that her career is over. According to Rolling Stone this scene pays homage to Alfred Hitchcock's film Vertigo.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>photographers</b> in 1999, 2001, 2003 and 2004 were {{respectively}} Antoine Verglas, James Porto, Michael Zeppetello and Steven White for the Swimsuit Issue works. From 2005–2007 Gair {{took the}} photographs of her body paintings herself. Verglas again photographed the bodypainting for the 2008 Swimsuit Issue. No body painting pictures have been chosen as the main image {{on the cover of}} the Swimsuit Issue. However, in the 2005 Swimsuit Issue (pictured left) in which Carolyn Murphy is the cover model, Jessica White was shown as an inset on the cover in a Miami Dolphins jersey body painting by Gair. Thus, as a Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue photographer Gair debuted on the cover in a sense. In 2006 a small cropped portion of her photograph of a bodypainting of Klum appeared in an inset on the cover, but no bodypainting was apparent.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} the younger version of Clarkson sitting at {{the back seat of}} a station wagon. Singing the first verse, she {{witnesses}} a depressing scene of her brother quarreling with her sister who are scolded by their mother. She slowly clasps both her hands before the video shifts to the present day where Clarkson is seen arriving on the red carpet with her publicist for the world premiere of The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement. After posing for <b>the</b> <b>photographers,</b> she enters the cinema and watches the film. The next scene switches back to the younger Clarkson who is sitting and looking around her neighborhood at her house's rooftop as a plane is seen flying across the sky. The video switches back to the older Clarkson who is now watching the aforementioned film in her laptop inside the plane as it goes through a mild turbulence. Clarkson is also seen reminiscing about her past job as a worker in a movie theater, singing with her co-workers. The next scene shows Clarkson singing with her band in a backyard party which is shown alternately with scenes from the film, as well as a montage of her family and co-workers waving away from her. In the final scene, the younger Clarkson is shown praying by her bedside.|$|E
50|$|Having so many AF points {{also helps}} relieve <b>the</b> <b>{{photograph}}er</b> {{from having to}} use the 'lock focus and recompose' method of framing a photograph that can introduce focussing inaccuracy. The camera generally focuses on the closest object or on human faces, {{which may not be}} what <b>the</b> <b>photographer</b> wants, so EOS cameras equipped with a multi-point AF system still allow <b>the</b> <b>photographer</b> to manually select an AF point.|$|R
50|$|To take <b>the</b> photograph, <b>the</b> <b>photographer</b> {{pulls back}} <b>the</b> ground glass and slides the film holder into its place. The shutter is then closed and cocked, the shutter speed and {{aperture}} set. <b>The</b> <b>photographer</b> removes <b>the</b> darkslide {{that covers the}} sheet of film in the film holder, and triggers the shutter to make the exposure. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>photographer</b> replaces <b>the</b> darkslide and removes the film holder with the exposed film.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{commonly}} used alternative focusing techniques are zone focusing and hyperfocal distance, either to free <b>the</b> <b>photographer</b> from manual-focus; or where autofocus is too slow, or <b>the</b> <b>photographer</b> cannot {{be sure the}} focus point will fall where <b>the</b> <b>photographer</b> chooses to place their subject in a quickly changing situation; and which also facilitate shooting [...] "from the hip" [...] i.e. without bringing the camera up to the eye.|$|R
25|$|Astronaut Gordon Cooper {{reported}} {{suppression of}} {{a flying saucer}} movie filmed in high clarity by two Edwards AFB range photographers on May 3, 1957. Cooper said he viewed developed negatives of the object, clearly showing a dish-like object with a dome on top and something like holes or ports in the dome. When later interviewed by James McDonald, <b>the</b> <b>photographers</b> and another witness confirmed the story. Cooper said military authorities then picked up the film and neither he nor <b>the</b> <b>photographers</b> ever heard what happened to it. The incident was also reported in a few newspapers, such as the Los Angeles Times. The official explanation was that <b>the</b> <b>photographers</b> had filmed a weather balloon distorted by hot desert air.|$|E
25|$|Among Austrian Artists {{and architects}} {{one can find}} the {{painters}} Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller, Rudolf von Alt, Hans Makart, Gustav Klimt, Oskar Kokoschka, Egon Schiele, Carl Moll, and Friedensreich Hundertwasser, <b>the</b> <b>photographers</b> Inge Morath and Ernst Haas, and architects like Johann Bernhard Fischer von Erlach, Otto Wagner, Adolf Loos, and Hans Hollein (recipient of the 1985 Pritzker Architecture Prize).

25|$|The lab {{was split}} into two {{sections}} per week, one for design and one for photography. The workshops were immensely popular, {{and it was not}} unusual for more than sixty people to show up to his class on the first night.

5000|$|With {{a special}} adapter, monopods {{can be used}} as a [...] "chestpod", meaning that the foot rests now on the chest of <b>the</b> <b>photographer.</b> <b>The</b> result is that the camera is held more {{steadily}} than by hand alone (though not as steadily as when the foot is planted on the ground), and the camera/monopod is completely mobile, travelling with <b>the</b> <b>photographer's</b> movements. This technique is widely used in videography in which <b>the</b> <b>photographer</b> has to move with the subject e.g first-person scenes, and is also especially useful for disabled photographers.|$|R

25|$|After the Buffalo show Stieglitz began {{showcasing}} {{more and}} more art in Camera Work. In 1911 a double issue was devoted to reproductions of Rodin’s drawings and analyses of his, Cézanne's and Picasso's work. While {{this was a very}} bold move to promote modern art, it did not sit well with <b>the</b> <b>photographers</b> who still made up most of the subscription list. Half of the existing subscribers immediately cancelled their subscriptions.|$|E
25|$|A {{photograph}} taken in 1987 depicting David Cameron and Boris Johnson together amongst {{other members of}} the club, including Jonathan Ford of the Financial Times, is perhaps the most well-known example. In an interview with the BBC's Andrew Marr, David Cameron said that the photograph was an embarrassment. BBC Two's Newsnight commissioned a painting to recreate the photograph because <b>the</b> <b>photographers</b> who own the copyright objected to it being published on commercial grounds.|$|E
25|$|Doyle {{was also}} {{inspired}} by his Spiritualist beliefs to write a novella on the subject, The Land of Mist, featuring the character Professor Challenger. He wrote many other non-fictional Spiritualist works; perhaps his most famous being The Coming of the Fairies (1922) which reveals Conan Doyle's conviction in the veracity of the five Cottingley Fairies photographs. He reproduced them in the book, together with theories {{about the nature and}} existence of fairies and spirits. Initially suspected of being falsified, the photos were decades later determined to be faked (along with admissions from <b>the</b> <b>photographers).</b>|$|E

25|$|There were mass {{funerals}} and cremations. Photographer Pablo Bartholemew, on commission with press agency Rapho, took {{an iconic}} color {{photograph of a}} burial on December 4, Bhopal gas disaster girl. Another photographer present, Raghu Rai, took {{a black and white}} photo. <b>The</b> <b>photographers</b> did not ask for the identity of the father or child as she was buried, and no relative has since confirmed it.

25|$|A {{photograph}} taken in 1988, also depicting British Prime Minister David Cameron, {{this time in}} the centre of the group, later emerged. It was found by the student newspaper, VERSA, amongst over a dozen other photographs of the club dated between 1950 and 2010 hanging {{on the wall of the}} tailor that is believed to have made the members’ suits, and led to a number of other past members being identified. Gillman and Soame, <b>the</b> <b>photographers</b> who own the copyright to the image, withdrew permission for it to be reproduced.

25|$|On 21 August 1911, the {{painting}} was stolen from the Louvre. The theft was not discovered until the next day, when painter Louis Béroud walked into the museum {{and went to the}} Salon Carré where the Mona Lisa had been on display for five years, only to find four iron pegs on the wall. Béroud contacted the head of the guards, who thought {{the painting}} was being photographed for promotional purposes. A few hours later, Béroud checked back with the Section Chief of the Louvre who confirmed that the Mona Lisa was not with <b>the</b> <b>photographers.</b> The Louvre was closed for an entire week during the investigation.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>photographer’s</b> gesture as <b>the</b> {{search for}} a {{viewpoint}} onto a scene takes place within the possibilities offered by <b>the</b> apparatus. <b>The</b> <b>photographer</b> moves within specific categories {{of space and time}} regarding the scene: proximity and distance, bird- and worm’s-eye views, frontal- and side-views, short or long exposures, etc. The Gestalt of space-time surrounding the scene is prefigured for <b>the</b> <b>photographer</b> by <b>the</b> categories of his camera. These categories are an a priori for him. He must ‘decide’ within them: he must press the trigger.|$|R
5000|$|Among Canon <b>photographers,</b> <b>the</b> lens {{is highly}} {{regarded}} for its sharpness, contrast, and color rendition. The lens is also popular {{because it is}} very sharp at its maximum aperture of 2, allowing <b>the</b> <b>photographer</b> to throw <b>the</b> background out of focus while recording a lot of detail on the primary subject. This gives <b>the</b> <b>photographer</b> fine-grained control over depth of field.|$|R
