If letters in a name are also letters that occur with higher frequency, then a preference for one's own letters might arise from the mere-exposure effect.|$|E

25|$|In December 1970 David Rigler {{procured}} a small {{grant from}} the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) to conduct preliminary studies on Genie, and in May 1971 Rigler organized and headed a team of doctors and scientists who sought and obtained a three-year {{grant from the}} NIMH {{to carry out a}} full case study.

UCLA linguistics professor Victoria Fromkin headed linguistic evaluation and organized a group of linguists to design and carry out their study. Shortly afterwards, in late May, Susan Curtiss began her work on Genie's case as a graduate student in linguistics under Fromkin.|$|E

500|$|Mau {{first visited}} Hawaii in 1973, and McCoy {{introduced}} him to Ben Finney. Later, Finney suggested to the Polynesian Voyaging Society that they should try to recruit Mau for their Hōkūle‘a project, since no Hawaiian traditional navigators remained. The project goal was <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>the</b> <b>hypothesis</b> that Polynesians made intentional non-instrument voyages across the Pacific. Tevake, a renowned Polynesian navigator, had died in 1970 and only six others were known. Navigators were reluctant to release their sacred knowledge to [...] "outsiders". At the time, Mau was just 41 years old and the youngest navigator out of the group. Mau feared that traditional navigation would die in his own culture, {{just as it had}} in Hawaii. He had tried to teach the young men of Satawal the skills passed on to him, but he was not optimistic. The members of the younger generation were too busy with school and too attracted to Western culture to undertake the rigorous course of study and apprenticeship. Further, Mau's people did not seem to care that traditional navigation was dying and could be lost forever.|$|E

2500|$|Like the 1970s era Viking spacecraft, Phoenix used rocket motors for {{its final}} descent. Experiments {{conducted}} by Nilton Renno, mission co-investigator from the University of Michigan, {{and his students}} have investigated how much surface dust would be kicked up on landing. Researchers at Tufts University, led by co-investigator Sam Kounaves, conducted additional in-depth experiments to identify {{the extent of the}} ammonia contamination from the hydrazine propellant and its possible effects on the chemistry experiments. In 2007, a report to the American Astronomical Society by Washington State University professor Dirk Schulze-Makuch, suggested that Mars might harbor peroxide-based life forms which the Viking landers failed to detect because of the unexpected chemistry. The hypothesis was proposed long after any modifications to Phoenix could be made. One of the Phoenix mission investigators, NASA astrobiologist Chris McKay, stated that the report [...] "piqued his interest" [...] and that ways <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>the</b> <b>hypothesis</b> with Phoenixs instruments would be sought.|$|E
60|$|From {{almost the}} origin of the discussions about the {{existing}} condition of the animal and vegetable worlds and the causes which have determined that condition, an argument has been put forward as an objection to evolution, which we shall have to consider very seriously. It is an argument which was first clearly stated by Cuvier in his criticism of the doctrines propounded by his great contemporary, Lamarck. The French expedition to Egypt had called the attention of learned men to the wonderful store of antiquities in that country, and there had been brought back to France numerous mummified corpses of the animals which the ancient Egyptians revered and preserved, and which, at a reasonable computation, must have lived not less than three or four thousand years before the time at which they were thus brought to light. Cuvier endeavoured <b>to</b> <b>test</b> <b>the</b> <b>hypothesis</b> that animals have undergone gradual and progressive modifications of structure, by comparing the skeletons and such other parts of the mummies as were in a fitting state of preservation, with the corresponding parts of the representatives of the same species now living in Egypt. He arrived at the conviction that no appreciable change had taken place in these animals {{in the course of this}} considerable lapse of time, and the justice of his conclusion is not disputed.|$|E
