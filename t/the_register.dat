Instead of applying for boundary increases or nominating more individual properties to <b>the</b> <b>Register,</b> the city decided to merge all five into a new, central district. The NPS accepted the application and entered the new district on <b>the</b> <b>Register</b> in 1986.|$|E

5000|$|One unifying {{aspect of}} R2 {{register}} signalling variants {{is that all}} audio tones are combinations of two frequencies. Each pair of two frequencies is called a multi-frequency tone, or MF tone. Each call attempt has an origination end and a termination end, both to the multi-span call {{as well as for}} each span within that multi-span call routing. The origination end is called <b>the</b> outgoing <b>register</b> in R2 parlance. The termination end is called <b>the</b> incoming <b>register</b> in R2 parlance. <b>The</b> outgoing <b>register</b> transmits forward MF tones to <b>the</b> incoming <b>register.</b> <b>The</b> incoming <b>register</b> transmits backward MF tones to <b>the</b> outgoing <b>register.</b> <b>The</b> outgoing <b>register</b> detects backward MF tones arriving from <b>the</b> incoming <b>register.</b> <b>The</b> incoming <b>register</b> detects forward MF tones arriving from <b>the</b> outgoing <b>register.</b> <b>The</b> outgoing <b>register</b> transmits <b>the</b> first signal, but from that point forward <b>the</b> outgoing <b>register</b> merely passively responds to the prompting driven by each signal transmitted by <b>the</b> incoming <b>register.</b> (In apt modern-era proleptic terms, <b>the</b> outgoing <b>register's</b> first push signal to <b>the</b> incoming <b>register</b> is similar to a peer-to-peer message, whereas <b>the</b> incoming <b>register's</b> pull signals, which request information from <b>the</b> outgoing <b>register,</b> are client-server, where the client is <b>the</b> incoming <b>register</b> and <b>the</b> server is <b>the</b> outgoing <b>register.)</b> ...|$|R
