5|$|Homer {{realizes he}} needs to make amends with Lisa, but she is too hurt to even <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> Homer briefly cheers her up, but shows that he still only wants to win a bet. She agrees to tell Homer who she thinks the winner will be, but she fears that she may be so distraught that she subconsciously wants Homer to lose his bet, leading her to a cryptic prediction: if she still loves Homer, Washington will win; if she does not, Buffalo. As a nervous Homer watches the game at Moe's Tavern, Washington scores {{at the last second}} to win the game. Homer becomes happy and Bart tells Lisa that she still loves Homer, in which she agrees. Homer cancels his bowling date with Barney and—on the Sunday after the Super Bowl—makes good on his promise to go hiking with Lisa.|$|E

They {{moved to a new}} house {{on the other side of}} town on Rose Street, which Williams' mother soon turned into a {{boarding}} house. The house had a small garden, on which they grew diverse crops that Williams and his sister Irene sold around Georgiana. At a chance meeting in Georgiana, Hank Williams met U.S. Representative J. Lister Hill while he was campaigning across Alabama. Williams told Hill that his mother was interested to <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> about his problems and her need to collect Elonzo Williams' disability pension. With Hill's help, the family began collecting the money. Despite his medical condition, the family managed fairly well financially throughout the Great Depression.|$|E

25|$|Toole {{tried to}} {{maintain}} a sense of normalcy and enrolled in Tulane {{in the fall of}} 1968 with the hopes of acquiring a Ph.D. He took a course studying Theodore Dreiser, on whom he had lectured while at Hunter, and was particularly interested in Dreiser's close relationship with his mother and his anti-Catholic beliefs. The assassinations of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr. in 1968 added to his feelings of grief and heightened his paranoia. Several of Toole's longtime friends noticed he had an increasing sense of feelings of personal persecution. Toole went to see his friend Bob Byrne at his home in August 1968, where he again expressed sadness and humiliation that his book would not be published. Toole told Byrne that people were passing his home late in the night and honking their car horns at him, that students whispered about him behind his back, and that people were plotting against him. Byrne had a <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> which he felt, for the time being, calmed him down.|$|E

500|$|While {{attending}} university, Iwata {{worked for}} HAL Laboratory {{as a part-time}} programmer in 1980. Among their first creations was a peripheral device that enabled older computers to display graphics for video games. With this device, Iwata and members of HAL created multiple games that were [...] "straight rip-offs of Namco’s Rally-X, Galaxian, and others". Despite this, HAL became the first company to establish a license with Namco for developing games. He joined the company in a full-time capacity after graduating in 1982, becoming its fifth employee and only programmer. Around the same time, Iwata's father was elected mayor of Muroran. Despite his passion, Iwata's family did not approve of his career choice, and his father did not <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> for six months after Iwata joined HAL.|$|E

A sound programmer at the time, Mitsuda {{was unhappy with}} his pay and threatened to leave Square {{if he could not}} compose music. Final Fantasy developer Hironobu Sakaguchi, one of the three designers for the upcoming Chrono Trigger, suggested he score the game, remarking, [...] "maybe your salary will go up." [...] Mitsuda reflected, [...] "I wanted to create music that wouldn't fit into any established genre...music of an imaginary world.

Upon visiting the arcade, Scully talks to Bart [...] "Zero" [...] Liquori, the arcade owner (and a friend of Oswald's) who {{happened}} to be present the night Hammond died. Mulder finds Oswald's high scores on the game's display, realizing that he was playing on the night Hammond died; Oswald {{was the first of the}} victims, and the only one to have survived. Elsewhere, Oswald is at work at an automobile repair shop when his boss's wife, Sharon Kiveat, walks in. He then tries talking to her, but she nervously rebuffs him; it is revealed that he had hit on her the day before, and she turned him down. His boss returns and tells Oswald that Mulder and Scully want to <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> When the agents visit Oswald to question him, he claims to have not witnessed anything. However, Mulder's cell phone mysteriously overheats in Oswald's presence, to which Oswald acts unsurprised.|$|E
500|$|Many {{accounts}} concerning Eystein {{in later}} sagas {{are characterized by}} literary motifs, and have little value as sources on his life. Snorri Sturluson, the Icelandic author of the early 13th century Heimskringla mastered this literary style particularly well, stylistically and psychologically. His stories includes a so-called mannjevning (literally [...] "comparison of men") between Eystein and Sigurd, {{in which the two}} boast about their skills and deeds in an attempt to outdo each other. In a similar fashion, Snorri also tells a story about how Eystein managed to cure the melancholy of a friend, by agreeing to regularly clear time to <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> about what troubled him. On his physical appearance, Snorri wrote that Eystein [...] "was the handsomest man that could be seen. He had blue open eyes; his hair yellow and curling; his stature not tall, but of the middle size." [...] More reliable information, particularly about Eystein's building-projects, is offered in earlier sagas such as the work of Theodoric the Monk, a Norwegian chronicler who wrote in the late 12th century.|$|E

500|$|Frank Sinatra began {{performing}} at Caesars Palace in 1967, after a fallout with Howard Hughes and Carl Cohen at The Sands. He signed a three-year contract. In {{the early morning}} hours of September 6, 1970, Sinatra was playing a high stakes baccarat at the casino, where he was {{performing at}} the time. Normal limits for the game are US$2,000 per hand; Sinatra had been playing for US$8,000 and wanted the stakes to be raised to US$16,000. When Sinatra began shouting after his request was denied, hotel executive Sanford Waterman came to <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> Witnesses to the incident said the two men both made threats, with Waterman producing a gun and pointing it at Sinatra.

500|$|When his {{immediate}} superior, Major General Henry H. [...] "Hap" [...] Arnold, was temporarily {{transferred to the}} Army General Staff in November 1939, Brett acted as Chief of the Air Corps. In May 1941, he formally became Chief of the Air Corps for a four-year term, but the June 1941 reorganisation that made Arnold the Chief of United States Army Air Forces made the post of Chief of the Air Corps somewhat redundant. Brett {{was sent to the}} United Kingdom to determine how the Army Air Forces could better support Royal Air Force Lend-Lease requirements. His recommendation that American labor and facilities be established in the United Kingdom to handle the repair, assembly, and equipping of American aircraft created a stir {{on both sides of the}} Atlantic, and was ultimately disapproved by Arnold on the grounds that the personnel and equipment were not available. Brett next paid a visit to the Middle East where his outspoken criticism of arrangements there antagonised his hosts to the extent that the British Ambassador to Egypt, Sir Miles Lampson, complained about him to the Foreign Secretary, Sir Anthony Eden. Air Marshal Sir Arthur Tedder noted that [...] "the charms of General Brett’s company were beginning to pall. After a <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> on the afternoon of 25 September I wondered in my journal how he and all the American visitors ...|$|E
500|$|Chrono Trigger was scored {{primarily}} by Yasunori Mitsuda, with contributions from veteran Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu, and one track composed by Noriko Matsueda. A sound programmer at the time, Mitsuda {{was unhappy with}} his pay and threatened to leave Square {{if he could not}} compose music. Hironobu Sakaguchi suggested he score Chrono Trigger, remarking, [...] "maybe your salary will go up." [...] Mitsuda composed new music and drew on a personal collection of pieces composed over the previous two years. He reflected, [...] "I wanted to create music that wouldn't fit into any established genre... music of an imaginary world. The game's director, Masato Kato, was my close friend, and so I'd always <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> about the setting and the scene before going into writing." [...] Mitsuda slept in his studio several nights, and attributed certain pieces—such as the game's ending theme, To Far Away Times—to inspiring dreams. He later attributed this song to an idea he was developing before Chrono Trigger, reflecting that the tune was made in dedication to [...] "a certain person with whom [...] wanted to share a generation". He also tried to use leitmotifs of the Chrono Trigger main theme {{to create a sense of}} consistency in the soundtrack. Mitsuda wrote each tune to be around two minutes long before repeating, unusual for Square's games at the time. Mitsuda suffered a hard drive crash that lost around forty in-progress tracks. After Mitsuda contracted stomach ulcers, Uematsu joined the project to compose ten pieces and finish the score. Mitsuda returned to watch the ending with the staff before the game's release, crying upon seeing the finished scene.|$|E

500|$|Xhinovci {{has come}} to believe that he is Hitler reincarnated since he began {{dressing}} as the Nazi leader. He carries numerous pieces of Nazi paraphernalia around with him, including Nazi-era Reichsmarks, swastika-emblazoned buttons, scarves embroidered with swastikas and other Nazi imagery, as well as a copy of Mein Kampf. He has business cards featuring a swastika and the word [...] "Hitler" [...] printed in bold. Locals and peacekeepers alike do not seem to mind Xhinovci's Hitler impersonations, especially as many Kosovars are too preoccupied with the country's crippling poverty and rampant corruption to give his actions much thought. On the contrary, many passersby—including some NATO peacekeepers—stop and greet him with the Nazi salute. One local told Vice News: [...] "I have {{a lot of other things}} to worry about in my life. I might look at him if he walks by, but that's it." [...] Locals apparently believe that his way of earning a living [...] "shows great enterprise". [...] "People respect me," [...] Xhinovci explains. [...] "The young and old [...] men, women and children. Everyone greets me with [...] "Heil Hitler". Xhinovci's five daughters, referred to locally as [...] "Hitler's children", are not bothered by their father's Hitler impersonations. Xhinovci reportedly attends parent-teacher conferences dressed as Hitler and says that teachers and other parents do not mind his appearance. He says that every time he goes to pick his daughters up from school he is surrounded by children who want to <b>talk</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> and take pictures. [...] "Girls like to touch my face.
