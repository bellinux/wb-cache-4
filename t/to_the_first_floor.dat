Departures {{take place on the}} lower deck (similar to the A380 boarding lounges currently in use at Gates 9 and 11), with arrivals streamed on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> to connect with the current first floor arrivals deck. All gates including 18 and 20 are now handling passengers.|$|E
5|$|Bodily {{and spiritual}} needs were {{balanced}} symmetrically within the mansion: the kitchen (16) and the chapel (7) were both large two-storied halls, {{rising from the}} semi-basement <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor.</b> This design not only provided a great and lofty space, but also allowed the servants to worship in the chapel without leaving the service floor, while their employers would worship from a private gallery, complete with fireplace, overlooking the chapel on the first floor.|$|E

5|$|The Hampshire Review {{newspaper}} {{occupied the}} building's second floor with its offices and printing plant from 1884 to 1895. John J. Cornwell, {{who later became}} West Virginia's governor, and his brother William B. Cornwell purchased the newspaper in 1890. The newspaper continued to operate from {{the second floor of}} the Wirgman Building until 1895, when the Cornwell brothers relocated the Hampshire Review office and printing plant <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> of their new brick building on West Main Street. In the newspaper's printing plant on {{the second floor of the}} Wirgman Building, the Hampshire Review was printed by a hand-operated Benjamin Franklin printing press.|$|E
5|$|The wooden stairs leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> {{replaced}} {{an earlier}} stone staircase, {{the remains of}} which can be seen protruding from the walls. The front room on the first floor had previously been partitioned, but the larger space was created when the new front wall was added to the building. Its roof has arched braced wooden trusses. The rear room still has the remains of a large fireplace, however, the chimney was blocked when the downstairs fireplace was installed.|$|E
5|$|In 1872 a major {{programme}} of building works was undertaken to a design by Edward Middleton Barry. This provided {{a roof over}} the central court of the Exchange and a new suite of offices {{on the first floor}} above the colonnades around the court. Other internal alterations appear to {{have been made in the}} late 19th century, possibly also by Barry in 1872. This is uncertain as Barry's plans are yet to be found. Further extensive alterations were made in the 1900s when the City Valuer's Department moved to the Exchange in 1907. These included the provision of a lift from the basement and cellars <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> and major alterations to the cellars under the central part of the Exchange. Since 1945 further alterations have included the replacement of the roof over the central court by a temporary roof at a lower level, the removal of the clock tower at the back of the building and the internal rebuilding of all four floors of the coffeehouse together with the corresponding floors over the main entrance.|$|E

50|$|The Jacob VanZolenburg House is a -story front-gable Queen Anne structure. A single story wing extends <b>to</b> <b>the</b> rear. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> is clad in clapboard, and {{the second}} story is clad with {{decorative}} shingling. A porch wraps around one side, and a bay window projects under the front gable. Smaller side gables, formed to mimic a gambrel shape, intersect the main roof toward the rear.|$|R

5|$|Opposite the entrance, {{and running}} across {{the middle of the}} court, was the great hall of the castle, with a grand porch and steps leading up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor,</b> where prestigious guests would have been entertained amongst carved wall-panels and murals. The design of the hall may have {{emulated}} Gaunt's hall at Kenilworth; at the very least, it was a powerful symbol of Thomas's authority and status. The west side of the inner court included the castle kitchen, bakery, well and other service facilities; on the east side was the lord's great chamber and a range of other accommodation for other guests. Behind the great hall was a smaller courtyard or garden. Thomas appears to have built up his new castle in stages, with the curtain wall being built first, with the corner towers added afterwards.|$|E
5|$|The {{building}} again {{served as}} a library in March 1937, when Romney's community library was relocated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> of Literary Hall from its previous facility {{in the basement of}} the Hampshire County Courthouse. The library had been established on April 11, 1935 as a project by the American Legion Auxiliary, and was housed in a room of the courthouse basement where it was staffed by volunteers and open from 2pm to 4pm on Saturday afternoons. When the library's collection of both purchased and donated books outgrew its space in the courthouse basement, the Clinton Lodge Masons granted permission to the library to house its collection at Literary Hall in 1937. Following its move to Literary Hall, the library expanded its hours, and expanded them again, to five afternoons a week, through the assistance of the National Youth Administration and the Works Progress Administration.|$|E
5|$|Other {{spirits are}} also said {{to remain at}} The Octagon as well. Dolley Madison's spirit has been seen near the {{fireplace}} in the main ballroom as well as heading through a closed door to the garden, and her ghost's presence is accompanied {{by the smell of}} lilacs, her favorite flower. A slave girl in the house was allegedly thrown from the third floor landing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> below and killed by a British soldier during the War of 1812, and eyewitnesses have reported hearing her scream. The specter of a British soldier in War of 1812 dress was seen by caretaker James Cypress in the 1950s, and museum superintendent Alric H. Clay claimed that in the 1960s spirits would often turn on the lights and open The Octagon's doors late at night. A gambler shot to death in the house's third-floor bedroom in the late 19th century has sometimes been seen still in the bed he died in, and ghostly footmen have been seen at the front door waiting to receive guests. He was said to have rung a bell shortly before his death and that the ring of the bell often heard in the house is from him. Various witnesses have also reported hearing assorted moans, screams, and footsteps.|$|E

50|$|Prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{construction}} of the current Palace, the building lot was occupied by an orphanage. It was sold to two railway magnates, Jan Schebek and František Ringhoffer, in 1868. Jan Schebek then commissioned architect Vojtěch Ignác Ullmann <b>to</b> design <b>the</b> current building. Ullmann's designs were inspired by renaissance Rome, and the building was constructed between 1870 and 1872. Originally designed to be three stories tall, additional floors have been added since the original construction. The building has four wings, with a rectangular courtyard in its center. Of special note are its ceiling murals by Viktor Barvitius, sculptures by Josef Wagner, and the building's marble staircase which leads <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor's</b> main reception rooms.|$|R
5000|$|An {{arsonist}} {{set fire}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> building on September 6, 2006 and did significant damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> structure. It had been vacant {{for five years}} at that time. [...] In 2007 it was decided <b>to</b> remove <b>the</b> second <b>floor</b> and <b>to</b> convert <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> into four apartments.|$|R

50|$|Philadelphia Museum Company, {{formerly}} {{the museum of}} Charles Willson Peale, appointed Dunn to {{its board of directors}} in 1836. He invested in the new museum building and as a result for a limited time he was free <b>to</b> use <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> of <b>the</b> building for his own museum.|$|R
50|$|The south parking deck {{is faced}} with {{distinctive}} twisted concrete slabs on the upper four levels, with the twist alternating in direction from <b>floor</b> <b>to</b> <b>floor.</b> <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> is clad in red brick, and two red brick stair towers are located on {{the south and west}} sides.|$|R
25|$|The {{symmetrical}} facade {{lost its}} initial ornaments during the 20th century. However, one can still appreciate the overall disposition, with the slight avant-corps underlining {{the axis of}} the entry gate, flanked by high pilasters continuing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor.</b>|$|E

25|$|Auvinen then reentered the school, {{went back}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor,</b> {{and began walking}} around, {{knocking}} on classroom doors. He then managed to enter an occupied comprehensive-school classroom. Inside, he shouted orders {{at some of the}} students, proclaimed a revolution, and urged the students to destroy school property. Despite firing two shots at a television set and a window, Auvinen left the classroom without shooting anyone.|$|E
25|$|A robot sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>floor</b> of unit 1 records a {{radiation}} level of 2,000 mSv/h. At this level, workers {{would only be}} allowed {{to stay in the}} area for 8 minutes. In addition, the reactor's containment vessel is leaking large amounts of water into the basement. A TEPCO worker is able to peer into the basement and determines that the 11m deep basement is approximately half full of water.|$|E
25|$|Named after Ella Graham Agnew, {{the first}} woman to receive a field {{appointment}} from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agnew Hall was constructed in 1940.
