Indeed, Mennenga {{came up with}} the idea of the Direct transfer System as opposed to the Moto or Olympic system of graduating racers to the finals from the qualifying heats were in part that it was easier to score and therefore the event could be run faster with fewer errors in paperwork. His philosophy is <b>that</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> does not directly pertain to the efficiency of running the race was superfluous and was done away with. This gave the ABA the reputation of efficiency without the delays during racing the NBA was suffering at the time.|$|E

25|$|In 1947, Dayan was {{appointed}} to the Haganah General Staff working on Arab affairs, in particular recruiting agents to gain information about irregular Arab forces in Palestine. On 14 April 1948, his brother, Zorik, was killed in fighting. On 22 April, Dayan was put in charge of abandoned Arab property in newly conquered Haifa. To put a stop to the out-of-control looting, he ordered <b>that</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> could be used by the army be stored in Haganah warehouses and the rest be distributed amongst Jewish agricultural settlements. On 18 May, Dayan was given command of the Jordan Valley sector. In a nine-hour battle, his troops stopped the Syrian advance south of the Sea of Galilee.|$|E

Still, {{one of the things}} that I guess was cool about being a staff engineer is that I wouldn’t have sought out a band like that. I wasn’t philosophically into anything that they were doing, but they were all good musicians – you would have to be to stay together at the speeds they were playing at. So there was that aspect of it, and just the whole pushing the envelope thing. It sounds like it’s just gonna completely break apart going 700 miles through the sky and then all of a sudden everything just comes right together again.|$|E
25|$|The {{owners and}} agents of Ariel and Taeping {{were well aware}} of the {{situation}} that the consignees were in. As soon as their ships had telegraphed from the Downs they became concerned <b>that</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> might be considered a dead heat or a disputed result might lead the consignees to call the race void - there being no outright winner - and so not pay the premium for the first ship to dock. Therefore, they agreed that whichever ship docked first would claim and the other would not dispute the result in any way. In return, the two ships shared the premium between them, and also MacKinnon and Keay shared the £100 prize for the winning ship's captain. This is what happened, Taeping made the claim and shared the money equally with Ariel.|$|E

500|$|Other {{philosophers}} {{of biology}} argue instead that biological teleology is irreducible, and cannot be removed by any simple process of rewording. Francisco Ayala argued that all statements about processes can be trivially translated into teleological statements, and vice versa, but that teleological statements are more explanatory and cannot be disposed of. Karen Neander similarly {{argued that the}} modern concept of biological 'function' depends on natural selection. So, for example, {{it is not possible}} to say <b>that</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> simply winks into existence, without going through a process of selection, actually has functions. We decide whether an appendage has a function by analysing the process of selection that led to it. Therefore, Neander argues, any talk of functions must be posterior to natural selection, function must be defined by reference to the history of a species, and teleology cannot be avoided. The evolutionary biologist Ernst Mayr likewise stated that [...] "adaptedness... is an a posteriori result rather than an a priori goal-seeking." ...|$|E
500|$|Peart {{has often}} been {{categorized}} as an Objectivist and an admirer of Ayn Rand. This is largely based on his work with Rush in the 1970s, particularly the song [...] "Anthem" [...] and the album 2112; the latter specifically credited Rand's work. However, in his 1994 Rush Backstage Club Newsletter, while contending the [...] "individual is paramount in matters of justice and liberty," [...] Peart specifically distanced himself from a strictly Objectivist line. In a June 2012 Rolling Stone interview, when asked if Rand's words still speak to him, Peart replied, [...] "Oh, no. That was forty years ago. But {{it was important to}} me at the time in a transition of finding myself and having faith that what I believed was worthwhile." [...] Peart has also ascribed to a philosophy that he has called [...] "Tryism," [...] which means <b>that</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> one tries to attain will be attained if one tries hard enough.|$|E

[...] However, there was some negative fan feedback concerning the pregnancy storyline. In reaction to this, Jeff Pinkner commented, [...] "Our interpretation of it is that people desperately want to see Olivia and Peter together. And that Fauxlivia having a baby makes Olivia’s life that much harder and people are angry because of <b>that.</b> <b>Anything</b> <b>that</b> makes Olivia’s life harder, people seem to be angry at.

It follows <b>that</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> carries out the same informational processes as a human is also conscious. Thus, if we wrote a computer program that was conscious, we could run that computer program on, say, a system of ping-pong balls and beer cups and the system would be equally conscious, because it was running the same information processes.|$|E

2500|$|While long {{recognised}} as {{the most}} tonally adventurous of Puccini's operas, Turandot has also been considered a flawed masterpiece, and some critics have been hostile. Joseph Kerman states that [...] "Nobody would deny that dramatic potential {{can be found in}} this tale. Puccini, however, did not find it; his music does nothing to rationalize the legend or illuminate the characters." [...] Kerman also wrote that while Turandot is more [...] "suave" [...] musically than Puccini's earlier opera, Tosca, [...] "dramatically it is a good deal more depraved." [...] However, Sir Thomas Beecham once remarked <b>that</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> Joseph Kerman said about Puccini [...] "can safely be ignored".|$|E
2500|$|Operational {{definitions}} are {{at their}} most controversial {{in the fields of}} psychology and psychiatry, where intuitive concepts, such as intelligence need to be operationally defined before they become amenable to scientific investigation, for example, through processes such as IQ tests. Such definitions are used as a follow up to a theoretical definition, in which the specific concept is defined as a measurable occurrence. John Stuart Mill pointed out the dangers of believing <b>that</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> could be given a name must refer to a thing and Stephen Jay Gould and others have criticized psychologists for doing just that [...] A committed operationalist would respond that speculation about the thing in itself, or noumenon, should be resisted as meaningless, and would comment only on phenomena using operationally defined terms and tables of operationally defined measurements [...]|$|E
