40|$|Work with a {{state-of-the-art}} high density PCM <b>tape</b> recorder <b>reproducer</b> system is described. The tape recorder {{is designed for}} 80 Mb/s operation at an overall bit error rate of. 00001 and for 40 Mb/s operation at. 000001. The article describes the process of measuring the error rate. Also detailed is a data rate buffer designed for use in recent radar experiments and generalizable to most potential uses of the recorder system...|$|R

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 13 - 15, 1970 / International Hotel, Los Angeles, CaliforniaNotch {{power ratio}} tests were {{performed}} on a magnetic <b>tape</b> recorder/ <b>reproducer,</b> using direct recording in the baseband. For the equipment tested, it is concluded that the IRIG method of setting the record power level as that which produces 1 % third harmonic on a single tone, does not necessarily result in an optimum record/reproduce cycle. It is concluded that the input and output levels should be set with reference to notch noise test data to optimize baseband tape recording performance for baseband recording of frequency division multiplexed systems. In order to interpret the notch noise data, {{it was necessary to}} assume two non-linear processes, one acting in conjunction with the record process and one in conjunction with the playback process...|$|R
