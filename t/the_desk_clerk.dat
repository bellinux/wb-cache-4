According to Caserta, Joplin was saddened that neither of her friends visited her at the Landmark as they had promised. During the 24 hours Joplin lived after this disappointment, Caserta did not phone her to explain why she had failed to show up. Caserta admitted to waiting until late Saturday night to dial the Landmark switchboard, only to learn that Joplin had instructed <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> <b>clerk</b> not to accept any incoming phone calls for her after midnight. [...] Morgan did speak to Joplin via telephone within 24 hours of her death, {{but it is not}} known whether he admitted to her that he had broken his promise.|$|E

60|$|So, too, when Alf left, {{the use of}} the French language, as such, {{fell off}} tremendously in the caff. Even now they use it to some extent.

6000|$|The {{end of it}} {{was bound}} to come. Even in Mariposa {{some of the people}} must have thought so.

60|$|At {{first the}} Mariposa court quashed all indictments. The {{presiding}} judge, with his spectacles on {{and a pile}} of books in front of him, threatened the informer with the penitentiary. The whole bar of Mariposa was with Mr. Smith. But by sheer iteration the informations had proved successful. Judge Pepperleigh learned that Mr. Smith had subscribed a hundred dollars for the Liberal party and at once fined him for keeping open after hours. That made one conviction. On the top of this had come the untoward incident just mentioned and that made two. Beyond that was the deluge. This then was the exact situation when Billy, <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> <b>clerk,</b> entered the back bar with the telegram in his hand.|$|E

50|$|The petitioner, Joey Stoner, {{had been}} arrested {{following}} a 1960 supermarket robbery in the Los Angeles area.

Two days later, detectives went to the hotel and, with <b>the</b> <b>desk</b> <b>clerk's</b> permission, searched <b>the</b> room and found further evidence linking him to the robbery. Stoner was arrested two days later in Nevada, and extradited. The evidence from the hotel room was used to convict him of the robbery at trial. Stoner unsuccessfully challenged the admissibility of the evidence at trial and on appeal, since police had lacked a warrant and relied on the clerk's permission. The appeals {{court held that the}} search was incident to arrest and thus permissible.|$|R
