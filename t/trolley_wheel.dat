25|$|Trolley is an American word {{derived from}} the {{electric}} current pickup mechanism in early systems. The first successful electric streetcars in the United States used a system devised by Frank J. Sprague, in which a spring-loaded trolley pole pushed a small <b>trolley</b> <b>wheel</b> up against an overhead wire to collect electricity for the motors. Although not the first overhead collection system, it was far more reliable than its predecessors, and eventually became used by almost all streetcars. Some authorities believe that the vehicle became known as a trolley car because it reminded people (particularly on the West Coast) of a boat trolling for fish. Others believe it derived from a dialect word for a wheeled cart.|$|E
25|$|A {{trolley pole}} is a tapered {{cylindrical}} pole of wood or metal placed {{in contact with}} an overhead wire to provide electricity to the trolley car. The trolley pole sits atop a sprung base {{on the roof of}} the trolley vehicle, the springs maintaining the tension to keep the <b>trolley</b> <b>wheel</b> or shoe in contact with the wire. Occasionally, a Canadian named John Joseph Wright is credited with inventing the trolley pole when an experimental tramway in Toronto, Ontario, was built in 1883. While Wright may have assisted in the installation of railways at the Canadian National Exhibition (CNE), and may even have used a pole system, there is no hard evidence to prove it. Likewise, Wright never filed or was issued a patent. Official credit for the invention of the electric trolley pole has gone to an American, Frank J. Sprague, who devised his working system in Richmond, Virginia, in 1888. Known as the Richmond Union Passenger Railway, this 12-mile system was the first large-scale trolley line in the world, opening to great fanfare on February 12, 1888.|$|E

The sliding trolley shoe provided better electrical contact (with a reduction in arcing), and it dramatically reduced overhead wire wear. Many systems began converting to the sliding trolley shoe in the 1920s; Milwaukee, Wisconsin converted its large system in the late 1920s. Curiously, Philadelphia did not convert its trolley wheels on its remaining streetcars until 1978.

5000|$|The troller design {{frequently}} {{fell off}} the wires, and was soon replaced by other more reliable devices, the trolley pole and notably the bow collector. Both were fitted {{to the top of}} the car and were spring-loaded in order to keep, respectively, a small <b>trolley</b> <b>wheel</b> or grooved lubricated [...] "skate" [...] mounted at the top of the pole or a steel rod forming the top of the bow firmly in contact with the underside of the overhead wire. The terms trolley pole and <b>trolley</b> <b>wheel</b> both derive from the troller. Trams using trolley-pole current collection are normally powered through a single pole, with return current earthed through the steel wheels and rails, though some systems (e.g. parts of the London system), used twin overhead wires and poles to avoid the effects of stray currents flowing through the earth. Modern trams often have an overhead pantograph mechanical linkage to connect to power, abandoning the trolley pole altogether.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the pantograph, the ES-2s were equipped with a wooden trolley pole which was spring-tensioned and manually-operated, {{in the same manner}} as on a trolley car, though it was never meant for use while in motion. Its sole purpose was to make stationary contact with the wire to charge an empty air compressor enough to raise the air-operated pantograph, usually when making a black start after dead storage or maintenance. For this reason, the pole was tipped with a metal plate rather than a shoe or <b>trolley</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|E

At terminus points, the conductor must turn the trolley pole around to face the correct direction, pulling it off the wire either with a rope or a pole and walking it around to the other end. In some cases, two trolley poles are provided, one for each direction: in this case it is a matter of raising one and lowering the other. Since the operator could raise the pole at one end whilst the conductor lowered the other, this saved time and was much easier for the conductor. Care must be taken to raise the downed pole first, to eliminate the damage caused by arcing between the pole and wire. In the US, the dual-pole system was the most common arrangement on double-ended vehicles. However, pushing of the pole (called [...] "back-poling" [...] in the US or [...] "spear-poling" [...] in Australia), was quite common where the trams were moving at slow speeds, such as at wye terminals (also known as reversers) and whilst backing into the sheds.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The paper {{sets up the}} Finite Element Model on {{the basis}} of {{crankshaft}} fillet rolling experiment and its mechanism. And then the paper shows the distribution of the residual stress in different depths of rolled crankshaft fillet through numerical simulation. It is found that the fatigue strength can greatly be produced by the method of the engine crankshaft fillet rolling in most of fillet areas; Simultaneously, two strips of tensile stress which is related to reduce the crankshaft fatigue strength will be generated in the peripheries. The tensile stress strips only emerge in the surface layer of the fillet, and then mainly disappear in the depths of 0. 4 mm below the surface layer. The paper concludes that the main reason of strips of tensile stress lies on the transition between the deformed region and the non-deformed reformed region after <b>trolley</b> <b>wheel</b> pressure is imposed on through a further research...|$|E
40|$|The MCO Handling Machine (MHM) trolley {{moves along}} the top of the MHM bridge girders on east-west {{oriented}} rails. To prevent <b>trolley</b> <b>wheel</b> uplift during a seismic event, passive uplift constraints are provided as shown in Figure 1 - 1. North-south <b>trolley</b> <b>wheel</b> movement is prevented by flanges on the trolley wheels. When the MHM is positioned over a Multi-Canister Overpack (MCO) storage tube, east-west seismic restraints are activated to prevent trolley movement during MCO handling. The active seismic constraints consist of a plunger, which is inserted into slots positioned along the tracks as shown in Figure 1 - 1. When the MHM trolley is moving between storage tube positions, the active seismic restraints are not engaged. The MHM has been designed and analyzed in accordance with ASME NOG- 1 - 1995. The ALSTHOM seismic analysis (Reference 3) reported seismic uplift restraint loading and EDERER performed corresponding structural calculations. The ALSTHOM and EDERER calculations were performed with the east-west seismic restraints activated and the uplift restraints experiencing only vertical loading. In support of development of the CSB Safety Analysis Report (SAR), an evaluation of the MHM seismic response was requested for the case where the east-west trolley restraints are not engaged. For this case, the associated trolley movements would result in east-west lateral loads on the uplift constraints due to friction, as shown in Figure 1 - 2. During preliminary evaluations, questions were raised as to whether the EDERER calculations considered the latest ALSTHOM seismic analysis loads (See NCR No. 00 -SNFP- 0008, Reference 5). Further evaluation led to the conclusion that the EDERER calculations used appropriate vertical loading, but the uplift restraints would need to be re-analyzed and modified to account for lateral loading. The disposition of NCR 00 -SNFP- 0008 will track the redesign and modification effort. The purpose of this calculation is to establish bounding seismic loads (vertical and horizontal) for input into the uplift restraint hardware redesign calculations. To minimize iterations on the uplift redesign effort, efforts were made to assure that the final loading input was reasonable but unquestionably on the conservative side...|$|E
40|$|The aims of {{this study}} were to {{evaluate}} the accuracy of centre of pressure (COP) data obtained during transition of load across the boundary between two force plates, and secondly to examine the effect of such COP data on joint kinetics during sprint running performances. COP data were collected from two piezoelectric force plates as a <b>trolley</b> <b>wheel</b> was rolled across the boundary between the plates. Position data for the trolley were collected using an opto-electronic motion analysis system for comparison with COP data. Mean COP errors during transition across the plate boundary were 0. 003 +/- 0. 002 m relative to a control point. Kinematic and kinetic data were also collected from eight athletes during sprint running trials to demonstrate the sensitivity of the inverse dynamics analysis to COP error for the ground contact phase of the dynamic movement trials. Kinetic sensitivity to the COP error was assessed during the entire stance phase for the ankle, knee, and hip joints and was less than 5 % and 3 % for joint moment and power data, respectively. Based on the small COP error during transition across plate boundaries, it is recommended that foot contacts overlapping two force plates may be included in inverse dynamics analyses...|$|E

The guide rail was a simple stringer of yellow pine, 4¼ by 8 inches in section, and the standards on which the wheels are journaled were placed far enough apart to allow a space of 6 inches between the continuous faces of each pair of wheels, thus affording 1¾ inches for lateral play, or sidewise movement toward or from the guard rail, it being designed that the guide rail shall be arranged in the exact line of the true center of gravity of the cars and locomotive. The standards were bolted to six-inch wide strap iron attached to and extending across the top of the car.|$|R

For trolley passageways two areas were defined: central and lateral paths, corresponding to the areas walked upon by the personnel pushing the trolleys and to the paths covered by the <b>trolley</b> <b>wheels,</b> respectively. In order to exclude a simple mechanical effect, a comparison of bacterial loads at defined sites beyond the mats was carried out in the presence {{and in the absence of}} decontaminating mats. Bacterial colony counts in the presence of decontaminating mats were substantially and statistically significantly reduced compared with the absence of mats. The lower mean number of colony-forming units detected at points located beyond the mats parallels this finding; this difference is also statistically significant. We thus conclude that decontaminating mats are potentially useful in decreasing micro-organism carry-over due to personnel or the passage of trolleys into areas at high risk of infection such as operating rooms...|$|R
