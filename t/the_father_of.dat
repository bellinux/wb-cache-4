5|$|Alcmene {{belongs to}} the Pelopid line—her mother Lysidice was a {{daughter}} of Pelops and Hippodameia—, and the passages preceding her Ehoie also concern Pelopids. Three of Pelops' daughters married sons of Perseus: Lysidice married Electryon, Nicippe wed Sthenelus, and Astydameia wed Alcaeus.

40|$|In general {{there is}} very little {{research}} on the coping styles that <b>the</b> <b>fathers</b> <b>of</b> children suffering from Autistic Spectrum Disorder (ASD) use in order to cope with the day-to-day demands and stressors that result from their child‘s unique condition. The research study focuses on <b>the</b> <b>fathers</b> <b>of</b> children on <b>the</b> autistic spectrum and how they cope with the stressors resulting from their children‘s condition on daily basis. The study made use of Bronfenbrenner‘s Ecosystemic Theory of Human Development as the guiding theoretical framework in exploring and describing this specific research domain. This was a qualitative study and it was phenomenological, descriptive and analytical in nature. The reason for this was to hear <b>the</b> voices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fathers</b> and explore in-depth how they deal with the daily stressors resulting from their children‘s condition. Semi-structured interviews were utilised where <b>the</b> <b>fathers</b> {{were asked to respond to}} an open-ended question. The data that was obtained from <b>the</b> <b>fathers</b> was analysed by means of content analysis. The sample size of the study was small (n= 5) and other limitations included a small number of previous studies done on <b>the</b> <b>fathers</b> <b>of</b> children on <b>the</b> autistic spectrum. The literature that is available that focused on <b>the</b> <b>fathers</b> <b>of</b> ASD children are often old and might possibly be out dated. However, this study aimed to hear <b>the</b> voices <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fathers</b> <b>of</b> children on <b>the</b> autistic spectrum and explore how they cope with the daily stressors. Therefore, this study will contribute to the literature on <b>the</b> <b>fathers</b> <b>of</b> ASD children...|$|R
