40|$|In this dissertation, I {{developed}} a grounded {{theory that describes}} and explains the processes by which a sample of highly educated young adults organizes and gives meaning to work careers in the contemporary milieu. Drawing upon in-depth interviews with 24 graduates from Harvard University 2 ̆ 7 s Class of 1996, I identified a sense of <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> as <b>the</b> core conceptual category for understanding how informants construct careers. Through a combination of cultural, relational and individual influences, informants {{developed a}} sense of <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> that was either uncomplicated or complicated. An uncomplicated sense of <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> included awareness of a limited range of <b>possibilities,</b> clarity about <b>the</b> <b>possibilities,</b> a sense of <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> as relatively permanent career solutions and a conception of <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> as fixed. Conversely, a complicated sense of <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> involved awareness of an extensive range of <b>possibilities,</b> ambiguity about <b>the</b> <b>possibilities,</b> a sense of <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> as short-term career solutions, and a conception of <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> as pliable. <b>The</b> more complicated their sense of <b>the</b> <b>possibilities,</b> <b>the</b> more actively individuals engaged in constructing a career. Three subprocesses relate to this core category: becoming aware of <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> explains <b>the</b> conditions under which a sense of <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> develops, confronting <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> explains <b>the</b> strategies of action individuals employ to contend with their sense of <b>the</b> <b>possibilities,</b> and living with possibilities and choices explains how people 2 ̆ 7 s careers and lives are shaped by {{the consequences of their}} actions and choices in the process of constructing their careers. The theory developed in this study suggests that, in constructing their careers, informants use whatever structural resources are available and impose their own structure where it is otherwise lacking and action is required. The convergence of available structural resources, a person 2 ̆ 7 s sense of <b>the</b> <b>possibilities,</b> and <b>the</b> action strategies employed to confront those possibilities leads people to construct either institutional or individual careers. These distinct career orientations have different consequences for the shape of the resulting work career, for the relationships between work careers and other interdependent careers, as well as for people 2 ̆ 7 s overall well-being. ...|$|R

40|$|How {{do people}} imagine <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> {{in which an}} {{assertion}} would be true and <b>the</b> <b>possibilities</b> in which it would be false? We argue that the mental representation of the meanings of connectives, such as “and”, “or”, and “if”, specify how to construct <b>the</b> true <b>possibilities</b> for simple assertions containing just a single connective. It follows that <b>the</b> false <b>possibilities</b> are constructed by inference from <b>the</b> true <b>possibilities.</b> We report converging evidence supporting this account from four experiments in which the participants had to list the true and <b>the</b> false <b>possibilities</b> for various sorts of assertion. Their systematic errors, response times, and think-aloud protocols corroborated the theory’s predictions. Not even true possibilities are immediately available for complex assertions containing two or more different connectives. The task of listing <b>the</b> true <b>possibilities</b> then becomes difficult, and the task of listing <b>the</b> false <b>possibilities</b> almost impossible. A fundamental semantic ability is to imagine {{the circumstances in which}} an assertion is true. If you understand an assertion, then you should be able t...|$|R
