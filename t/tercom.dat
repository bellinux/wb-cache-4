More sophisticated <b>TERCOM</b> systems allow the missile to fly a complex route over a full 3D map, instead of flying directly to the target. <b>TERCOM</b> is the typical system for cruise missile guidance, but is being supplanted by GPS systems and by DSMAC, Digital Scene-Matching Area Correlator, which employs a camera to view an area of land, digitizes the view, and compares it to stored scenes in an onboard computer to guide the missile to its target.|$|E

5000|$|<b>TERCOM</b> {{systems have}} the {{advantage}} of offering accuracy that is not based on the length of the flight; an inertial system slowly drifts after a [...] "fix", and its accuracy is lower for longer distances. <b>TERCOM</b> systems receive constant fixes during the flight, and thus do not have any drift. Their absolute accuracy, however, is based on the accuracy of the radar mapping information, which is typically in the range of meters, and the ability of the processor to compare the altimeter data to the map quickly enough as the resolution increases. This generally limits first generation <b>TERCOM</b> systems to targets on the order of hundreds of meters, limiting them to the use of nuclear warheads. Use of conventional warheads requires further accuracy, which in turn demands additional terminal guidance systems.|$|E
50|$|Terrain Contour Matching, or <b>TERCOM,</b> is a {{navigation}} system used primarily by cruise missiles. It uses a pre-recorded contour {{map of the}} terrain that is compared with measurements made during flight by an on-board radar altimeter. A <b>TERCOM</b> system considerably increases the accuracy of a missile compared with inertial {{navigation system}}s (INS). The increased accuracy allows a TERCOM-equipped missile to fly closer to obstacles and generally lower altitudes, making it harder to detect by ground radar.|$|E

5000|$|<b>TERCOM</b> - Terrain Contour Matching. A digital {{representation}} {{of an area}} of terrain is mapped based on digital terrain elevation data or stereo imagery. This map is then inserted into a TLAM mission which is then loaded onto the missile. When the missile is in flight it compares the stored map data with radar altimeter data collected as the missile overflies the map. Based on comparison results the missile's inertial navigation system is updated and the missile corrects its course. <b>TERCOM</b> was based on, and was a significant improvement on, [...] "Fingerprint," [...] a technology developed in 1964 for the SLAM.|$|E
50|$|Digital {{technology}} allowed missile guidance {{systems to}} shrink in size and to compute and correct their flight path en route. The use of onboard maps, video processing and terrain comparison (<b>TERCOM)</b> software gave cruise missiles unprecedented accuracy.|$|E
50|$|Guidance {{systems can}} vary across {{missiles}}. Some missiles can be fitted {{with any of}} a variety of navigation systems (Inertial navigation, <b>TERCOM,</b> or satellite navigation). Larger cruise missiles can carry either a conventional or a nuclear warhead, while smaller ones carry only conventional warheads.|$|E
50|$|One {{disadvantage}} of early <b>TERCOM</b> systems was that, {{due to the}} limitations of storage and computing systems of the time, the entire route had to be pre-planned, including its launch point. If the missile was launched from an unexpected location or flew too far off-course, it would never fly over the features included in the maps, and become lost. The INS system can help in this regard, allowing it to fly to the general area of the first patch, but gross errors simply cannot be corrected. This made early <b>TERCOM</b> based systems much less flexible than more modern systems like GPS, which can be set to attack any location from any location, and do not require any sort of pre-recorded information which means they can be targeted immediately prior to launch.|$|E
50|$|Another revolutionary {{aspect of}} the SLAM was its {{reliance}} on automation. It would have the mission of a long-range bomber, but would be completely unmanned: accepting radioed commands up to its failsafe point, whereafter it would rely on a terrain contour matching (<b>TERCOM)</b> radar system to navigate to preprogrammed targets.|$|E
5000|$|In June 1986 {{a limited}} number of AGM-86B {{missiles}} were converted to carry a high-explosive blast/fragmentation warhead and an internal GPS. They were redesignated as the AGM-86C CALCM. This modification also replaced the B model's terrain contour-matching guidance system (<b>TERCOM)</b> and integrated a GPS capability with the existing inertial navigation system computer [...]|$|E

Secretary McNamara's recommendation was not acted upon, and the Hound Dog remained in service.|$|E
50|$|The {{availability}} of compact fast computers and high-capacity storage, {{combined with the}} {{availability of}} global digital elevation maps, has mitigated this problem, as <b>TERCOM</b> data is no longer limited to small patches, {{and the availability of}} side-looking radar allows much larger areas of landscape contour data to be acquired for comparison with the stored contour data.|$|E
5000|$|Contrast seekers {{should be}} {{distinguished}} from television guidance systems, in which a live television signal is broadcast to the launch platform, which then uses manual direction to attack the target. Examples of TV guidance include the Martel and AGM-62 Walleye. The term [...] "contrast contour" [...] is sometimes used, but this may be confused with <b>TERCOM</b> systens.|$|E
5000|$|Like {{long-range}} anti-ship missiles, land-attack {{missiles are}} usually turbojet or turbofan powered cruise missiles. To prevent {{early detection and}} counter-measures, they usually fly near the ground at very low altitude, employing terrain-following techniques, either with terrain-following radar or with precise navigation system, like GPS, combined with a stored map of obstacles and ground elevation data (<b>TERCOM).</b>|$|E
50|$|Guidance systems also vary greatly. Low-cost systems use a radar altimeter, {{barometric}} altimeter and clock to navigate a digital strip map. More advanced systems use inertial guidance, satellite guidance and terrain contour matching (<b>TERCOM).</b> Use of an automatic target recognition (ATR) algorithm/device in the guidance system increases {{accuracy of the}} missile. The Standoff Land Attack Missile features an ATR unit from General Electric.|$|E
5000|$|S-200W is a {{turbojet}} powered drone {{developed by}} NRIST with cylindrical fuselage and V-tail.

50|$|The massive {{improvements}} in memory and processing {{power from the}} 1950s when these scene comparison systems were first invented to the 1980s when <b>TERCOM</b> was widely deployed {{changed the nature of}} the problem considerably. Modern systems can store numerous images of a target as seen from different directions, and often the imagery can be calculated using image synthesis techniques. Likewise, the complexity of the live imaging systems has been greatly reduced through the introduction of solid-state technologies like CCDs. The combination of these technologies produced the Digitized Scene-Mapping Area Correlator (DSMAC). DSMAC systems are often combined with <b>TERCOM</b> as a terminal guidance system, allowing point attack with conventional warheads.MGM-31 Pershing II, SS-12 Scaleboard Temp-SM and OTR-23 Oka used an active radar homing version of DSMAC (digitized correlator unit DCU), which compared radar topographic maps taken by satellites or aircraft with information received from the onboard active radar regarding target topography, for terminal guidance.|$|E
50|$|In 1971, Terekhov {{began working}} at Leningrad State University {{as a junior}} {{research}} associate. He was ultimately promoted to head of System-Programming there. In 1984 he was appointed Deputy Director at Zvezda and Krasnaya Zarya. Seven years later he founded and became Director of <b>Tercom</b> and in 1996 founded and led the Software Engineering Chair of St. Petersburg State University. He also founded Lanit-Intercom Inc, becoming its General Director.|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the limited}} amount of memory {{available}} in mass storage devices of the 1960s and 70s, and their slow access times, the amount of terrain data that could be stored in a missile-sized package was far too small to encompass the entire flight. Instead, small patches of terrain information were stored and periodically used to update a conventional inertial platform. These systems, combining <b>TERCOM</b> and inertial navigation, are sometimes known as TAINS, for TERCOM-Aided Inertial Navigation System.|$|E
50|$|After {{achieving}} flight, the missile's {{wings are}} unfolded for lift, the airscoop is exposed and the turbofan engine is employed for cruise flight. Over water, the Tomahawk uses inertial guidance or GPS {{to follow a}} preset course; once over land, the missile's guidance system is aided by terrain contour matching (<b>TERCOM).</b> Terminal guidance {{is provided by the}} Digital Scene Matching Area Correlation (DSMAC) system or GPS, producing a claimed circular error probable of about 10 meters.|$|E
50|$|The United States, Russia, United Kingdom, Israel, South Korea, Turkey, Iran, China, Pakistan and India have {{developed}} several long-range subsonic cruise missiles. These missiles have {{a range of}} over 1000 km and fly at about 800 km/h. They typically have a launch weight of about 1500 kg and can carry either a conventional or a nuclear warhead. Earlier versions of these missiles used inertial navigation; later versions use much more accurate <b>TERCOM</b> and DSMAC systems. Most recent versions can use satellite navigation.|$|E
50|$|The Goodyear Aircraft Corporation ATRAN (Automatic Terrain Recognition And Navigation) {{system for}} the MGM-13 Mace was the {{earliest}} known <b>TERCOM</b> system. In August 1952, Air Materiel Command initiated the mating of the Goodyear ATRAN with the MGM-1 Matador. This mating resulted in a production contract in June 1954. ATRAN was difficult to jam and was not range-limited by line-of sight, but its range was restricted by the availability of radar maps. In time, it became possible to construct radar maps from topographic maps.|$|E
