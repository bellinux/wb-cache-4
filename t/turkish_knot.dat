50|$|The Ghiordes knot (Turkish: Gördes düğümü) or <b>Turkish</b> <b>knot</b> {{is one of}} the two most-used knots {{employed}} in knotted-pile carpets. In the Ghiordes knot, the colored weft yarn passes over the two warp yarns, and is pulled through between them and then cut to form the pile. The <b>Turkish</b> <b>knot</b> has a symmetrical structure. The Ghiordes knot is the knot used in the oldest surviving pile carpets, the fragments found in Pazyryk kurgan burial mounds, in the Altai of Central Asia.|$|E
50|$|To tie a {{symmetric}} knot, the yarn {{is passed}} between two adjacent warps, brought back under one, wrapped around both forming a collar, then pulled {{through the center}} so that both ends emerge between the warps. The <b>Turkish</b> <b>knot</b> uses two warps.|$|E

50|$|Hereke carpets {{typically}} are very large, palace sized carpets, and {{are made with}} wool on cotton, camel hair on cotton, silk on cotton as well as silk on silk, which are knotted in small sizes. The precision of their double <b>knots</b> (<b>Turkish</b> or Ghiordes <b>knots),</b> which allows the clear display of patterns, together with the colour combinations and the harmonious patterns have made them highly collectible. Today, Hereke carpets and rugs are still made with the traditional patterns of the Ottoman sultan, Abdülmecid I, as well as both traditional Anatolian and contemporary figurative patterns.|$|R
50|$|The pile knots {{are usually}} knotted by hand. Most rugs from Anatolia utilize the {{symmetrical}} <b>Turkish</b> double <b>knot.</b> Each knot is made on two warps. With {{this form of}} knotting, {{each end of the}} pile thread is twisted around two warp threads at regular intervals, so that both ends of the knot come up between two strands {{on one side of the}} carpet. The thread is then pulled downwards and cut with a knife.|$|R

50|$|Hereke carpets {{are created}} using a unique {{construction}} method. The initial {{preparation of the}} loom is distinct from most other techniques worldwide. The Hereke method allows {{the possibility of a}} second weft, this difference separates the Hereke carpet-making technique from others. Hereke carpets are double knotted using the <b>Turkish</b> <b>knot,</b> resulting in a more durable product. Double knots cannot be undone or removed, unlike single knots. Hereke silk carpets have 1 million and over knots per square meter.|$|E
5000|$|According to the {{writings}} and documents, the oldest existing carpet {{attributed to the}} city belongs to the reign of Shah Abbas (Abbas I of Persia). Also, there {{is a type of}} carpet, classified as Mashhad turkbâf, which, as its name suggests, is made with <b>Turkish</b> <b>knot</b> by craftsmen who emigrated from Tabriz to Mashhad in the nineteenth century.Among the major industries in the city, there is nutrition industries, clothing, leather, textiles, chemicals, steel and non-metallic mineral industries, construction materials factories, handicraft industry and metal industries.|$|E
5000|$|Rya rugs, for example, are woven with a {{combination}} of techniques that include weaving tapestry, needlework, and carpet knots. Traditionally, Scandinavian Rya rugs were hand-made by artisans who would add symmetric <b>Turkish</b> (or Ghiordes) <b>knots</b> directly to the warp through a specially woven backing. Small holes in the weave allowed the rug-makers to insert evenly spaced knots using a larger tapestry needle.|$|R
50|$|Amongst Oriental rugs, the Turkish carpet is {{distinguished}} by particular characteristics of dyes and colours, designs, textures and techniques. Usually made of wool and cotton, Turkish carpets are tied with the <b>Turkish,</b> or symmetrical <b>knot.</b> The earliest known examples for Turkish carpets {{date from the}} thirteenth century. Distinct types of carpets have been woven ever since in workshops, in more provincial weaving facilities, {{as well as in}} villages, tribal settlements, or by nomads. Carpets were simultaneously produced for these different levels of society, with varying materials like sheep wool, cotton, and silk. Pile woven as well as flat woven carpets (Kilim, Soumak, Cicim, Zili) have attracted collectors' and scientists' interest.Following a decline which began {{in the second half of}} the nineteenth century, initiatives like the DOBAG Carpet Initiative in 1982, or the Turkish Cultural Foundation in 2000, started to revive the traditional art of Turkish carpet weaving by using hand-spun, naturally-dyed wool and traditional designs.|$|R

They are made by tribal people who either live in or pass by Varamin.The principal colours used in Varamin carpets are usually dark brown and dark red on khaki or dark blue backgrounds. The village and workshop weavers mainly use the asymmetrical (Persian) knot, while the nomads, depending on their ethnicity, use either the asymmetrical or the symmetrical (<b>Turkish)</b> <b>knot.</b>|$|E
