The precision of guide rails, screws and nuts used {{in most of the}} machines is not high, and the machine control cannot compensate for the screw pitch error, clearance during the transmission and machining error due to electrode wear. Furthermore, control signal may also be lost in control process. The development of speed line cutter focuses on the quality and machining stability of CNC speed line cutter.

This paper proposes <b>that</b> Pinch <b>analysis</b> method <b>shall</b> be applied to the energy allocation under constraints of carbon emissions. The objective function and constraints of the model are synthesized and put in the same coordinate system to form the synthetic curve of energy demand and supply.

40|$|Analysis of {{antibody}} repertoire {{development and}} specific antibody responses important for e. g. autoimmune conditions, allergy, and protection against disease {{is supported by}} high throughput sequencing and associated bioinformatics pipelines that describe {{the diversity of the}} encoded antibody variable domains. Proper assignment of sequences to germline genes are important for many such processes, for instance in the analysis of somatic hypermutation. Germline gene inference from antibody-encoding transcriptomes, by using tools such as TIgGER or IgDiscover, has a potential to enhance the quality of such analyses. These tools may also be used to identify germline genes not previously known. In this study, we exploited such software for germline gene inference and define aspects of analysis settings and pre-existing knowledge of germline genes that affect the outcome of gene inference. Furthermore, we demonstrate the capacity of IGHJ and IGHD haplotype inference, whenever subjects are heterozygous with respect to such genes, to lend support to IGHV gene inference in general, and to the identification of novel alleles presently not recognized by germline gene reference directories. We propose <b>that</b> such haplotype <b>analysis</b> <b>shall,</b> whenever possible, be used in future best practice to support the outcome of germline gene inference. IGHJ-directed haplotype inference was also used to identify haplotypes not expressing some IGHV germline genes. In particular, we identified a haplotype that did not express several major germline genes such as IGHV 1 - 8, IGHV 3 - 9, IGHV 3 - 15, IGHV 1 - 18, IGHV 3 - 21, and IGHV 3 - 23. We envisage <b>that</b> haplotype <b>analysis</b> will provide an efficient approach to identify subjects for further studies of the link between the available immunoglobulin repertoire and outcomes of immune responses...|$|R
