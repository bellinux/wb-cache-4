5|$|The {{scene where}} Forrest spots Jenny at a peace rally at the Lincoln Memorial and Reflecting Pool in Washington, D.C., {{required}} visual effects {{to create the}} large crowd of people. Over two days of filming, approximately 1,500 extras were used. At each successive take, <b>the</b> <b>extras</b> were rearranged and moved into a different quadrant away from the camera.

5|$|After the Nuremberg rallies trilogy and Olympia, Riefenstahl {{began work}} on the movie she had {{tried and failed to}} direct once before, namely Tiefland. On Hitler's direct order, the German {{government}} paid her seven million Reichsmarks in compensation. From 23 September until 13 November 1940, she filmed in Krün near Mittenwald. <b>The</b> <b>extras</b> playing Spanish women and farmers were drawn from gypsies detained in a camp at Salzburg-Maxglan who were forced to work with her. Filming at the Babelsberg Studios near Berlin began 18 months later in April 1942. This time Sinti and Roma people from the Marzahn detention camp near Berlin were compelled to work as extras. Almost to the end of her life, despite overwhelming evidence that the concentration camp occupants had been forced to work on the movie unpaid, Riefenstahl continued to maintain all the film extras survived and that she had met several of them after the war. Riefenstahl sued filmmaker Nina Gladitz, who said Riefenstahl personally chose <b>the</b> <b>extras</b> at their holding camp; Gladitz had found one of the Gypsy survivors and matched his memory with stills of the movie for a documentary Gladitz was filming. The German court ruled largely in favour of Gladitz, declaring that Riefenstahl had known <b>the</b> <b>extras</b> were from a concentration camp, but they also agreed that Riefenstahl had not been informed the Gypsies would be sent to Auschwitz after filming was completed.|$|E

5|$|Edwards {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the film after seeing fishermen attempt to bring a creature in with a net, and imagining a monster inside. He pitched the idea to Vertigo Films, who suggested he watch In Search of a Midnight Kiss, a low-budget film starring McNairy. Edwards cast McNairy and Able in the lead roles. Principal photography lasted three weeks and had a production crew of six people. Filming took place in five countries, and many locations were used without permission. Most of <b>the</b> <b>extras</b> were people who were at these locations during filming and were persuaded to act in it; all of their dialogue was improvised, and Edwards provided outlines of the primary plot points.|$|E
40|$|Recent cosmological observations, {{including}} {{measurements of}} the CMB anisotropy and the primordial helium abundance, indicate {{the existence of an}} extra radiation component in the Universe beyond the standard three neutrino species. In this paper we explore the possibility that <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> radiation has isocurvatrue fluctu-ations. A general formalism to evaluate isocurvature perturbations in <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> radiation is provided in the mixed inflaton-curvaton system, where <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> radia-tion is produced by the decay of both scalar fields. We also derive constraints on the abundance of <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> radiation and <b>the</b> amount of its isocurvature perturbation. Current observational data favors the existence of an extra radiation component, but does not indicate its having isocurvature perturbation. These constraints are applied to some particle physics motivated models. If future observations detect isocurvature perturbations in <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> radiation, it will give us a hint to the origin of <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> radiation. ar X i...|$|R
30|$|DCA defines three {{parameter}} thresholds to dynamically adjust <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> delay. Depending {{on these}} threshold settings, <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> delay varies significantly. So far, how to optimize these threshold settings {{has never been}} discussed. To solve this problem, we need to answer the fundamental question of DCA: what is <b>the</b> optimal <b>extra</b> delay? Obviously, if <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> delay is too short, only a few packets will be aggregated for one transmission and therefore, {{the advantage of the}} frame aggregation technology is still not fully exploited. On the other hand, if <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> delay is too long, it will cause a negative impact on quality of service for multimedia applications. This paper is devoted to studying the fundamental question of <b>the</b> optimal <b>extra</b> delay.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{theories}} with compact extra dimensions {{have become}} increasingly popular. In some models, the standard model particles are confined to our four-dimensional world, and only gravity can propagate in <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> dimensions. In such models, the size of <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> dimensions can be as large as hundreds of microns. The functional dependence of the gravitational force on distance is well known at {{both large and small}} distances, compared to the size of <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> dimensions; for two extra dimensions, for example, it varies from 1 /r 2 to 1 /r 4 as the distance decreases. However, the dependence for intermediate distances has not been fully calculated. We determine this dependence as a function of both the size of <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> dimensions and <b>the</b> possible angle between <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> dimensional unit vectors, and show that high precision measurements of the gravitational force will allow the determination of the shape of <b>the</b> <b>extra</b> dimensions...|$|R

5|$|The Mumbai slum set in {{the season}} finale was {{constructed}} on {{the parking lot of}} the studio, which took two to three weeks to complete. The finale was filmed during one of the hottest heatwaves to hit British Columbia; Tapping found that the set was hotter than the average temperature of the actual Mumbai. Three main cameras were used, one of which was crane-operated. 60 extras were used, the highest number used in an Sanctuary episode. For <b>the</b> <b>extras</b> to be used in more than one scene, they wore many different costumes. The streeting area was also limited in size, so the streets were recycled frequently with every scene. The practical sets of the Sanctuary offices and corridors were also redesigned to look like the Mumbai Sanctuary.|$|E
5|$|The costumes used in {{the show}} drew {{inspiration}} {{from a number of}} sources, such as Japanese and Persian armour. Dothraki dress resembles that of the Bedouin (one was made out of fish skins to resemble dragon scales), and the Wildlings wear animal skins like the Inuit. Wildling bone armor is made from molds of actual bones, and is assembled with string and latex resembling catgut. Although <b>the</b> <b>extras</b> who play Wildlings and the Night's Watch often wear hats (normal in a cold climate), members of the principal cast usually do not so viewers can distinguish the main characters. Björk's Alexander McQueen high-neckline dresses inspired Margaery Tyrell's funnel-neck outfit, and prostitutes' dresses are designed for easy removal. All clothing used is aged for two weeks so it appears realistic on high-definition television.|$|E

The DVD preserves the film in its original aspect ratio of 1.85:1 widescreen and is non-anamorphic. It additionally features remastered audio and picture, but contains no extras. The same company later released a new special edition DVD of Cagliostro in 2006. The disc is double-sided with the film on side A and <b>the</b> <b>extras</b> on side B. It includes a new digital transfer; Manga's English dub in 2.0 and 5.1 surround plus Japanese, Spanish, and French language tracks in mono; the complete film in storyboard format, accompanied by Japanese audio with English subtitles; an original Japanese trailer; a sketch and still gallery; a 26-minute interview with animation director Yasuo Ōtsuka, and animated menus. The film is presented in 16:9 anamorphic widescreen; however, the opening credits have been heavily re-edited to remove the Japanese credits, instead using selected still-frames of scenes that appear without Japanese writing. The English-translated names are superimposed over these stills. This change was negatively received by fans of the film. Both DVD releases are out-of-print, with Manga no longer owning the U.S. film rights.|$|E
