5000|$|The {{principal}} {{feature of}} the Ferguson System was the three-point linkage. This allowed <b>trailed</b> <b>implements</b> to be supported on a hydraulic system. Two drag links attached under the rear axle with a single compression link connected to the upper rear transmission case automatically regulating the hydraulic suspension's height. This allowed lighter implement to be used, with no attached wheels or separate manual controls. By assisting the tractor to maintain traction from a combined drag and rotary force to the axle, which kept the rear driving wheels on the ground, the front steering wheels had improved contact with the ground. Consequently, the [...] "rearing and bucking" [...] of overloaded tractors was reduced, making tractors much safer for the operator.|$|E
40|$|The {{conventional}} {{draught control}} system, as fitted to modern tractors, {{consists of a}} negative feed back control system that adjusts the working depth of mounted or semi mounted soil engaging implements {{in an attempt to}} regulate the draught requirements of the implement. The system has become important in agricultural production because it increases the efficiency of tractor operations in two ways. Firstly, by controlling the draught requirements of an implement the draught control system allows tractor engine efficiency to be optimised. Secondly, by transferring some of the weight of the implement onto the rear wheels of the tractor, wheel slip is reduced and controlled. This latter function, more than any other, was responsible for the major change in the design concept of tractors, permitting smaller, lighter tractors to do the same work as their heavier predecessors, pulling <b>trailed</b> <b>implements.</b> The control system has lead to the ability of relatively light weight tractors being able to maintain a high work rate (in terms of area cultivated in a given time) with acceptable working depth fluctuations, and without undue energy loss through wheel slip...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the dynamics of}} the tractor-implement combination in traction works, in the specific soil conditions present in Southern Portuguese agriculture. The tillage operations are very power demanding and are therefore responsible for significant energy inputs. The inappropriate operation of the tractor, in regarding to engine and gearbox speeds and poor management of ballast and tire inflation pressure, combined with poor regulation of tillage implements can result in significant energetic efficiency losses with impact on the economic returns that can be provided by agriculture to farmers and the viability of agricultural enterprises. The purpose of this project was to study tractor-implement dynamics in tillage operations. A portable computer- based recording system (data acquisition system) was developed and installed on tractors to monitor engine speed, fuel consumption, actual forward speed, wheel slip and draught force required for <b>trailed</b> <b>implements.</b> The field tests were performed under real working conditions. Field trials carried out under different working conditions allowed, firstly, to establish predictive models for traction effort and fuel consumption per unit of area that can be used by farmers as a reference when working with trailed offset disc harrows, and secondly, to quantify the actual fuel savings that can be obtained by selecting an engine speed of about 80 % of rated speed, using the highest allowed gear ratio, by adjusting the tire inflation pressure and liquid ballast for each work situation (according to the coefficient of traction and traction-wheel slip) and adjusting the gang angle of the trailed disc harrow (and the working width and depth) to the soil conditions (soil type and moisture content) ...|$|E

40|$|Falls {{are one of}} {{the many}} dangers present in {{agriculture}} production. However, few studies have looked specifically at this hazard for youth populations who may have unique exposures and susceptibilities. Fatal agricultural work injuries to youth resulting from falls were examined using data from the U. S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries (CFOI). CFOI collects data on occupational injury deaths throughout the United States. Non-fatal falls, both work- and non-work-related, were examined using data from the Childhood Agricultural Injury Survey (CAIS). The CAIS, conducted by the U. S. Department of Agriculture for NIOSH, collected information on all non-fatal injuries to youth on farms for the calendar year of 1998. For the purposes of this research, the term fall includes injuries resulting from falls from heights, falls on the same level, or a fall from a vehicle or machine. From 1992 - 1999, CFOI identified 36 fatalities resulting from falls occurring to youth less than 20 years of age, the majority among males. Over three-quarters (81 %) of the fatalities resulted from the youth falling from a vehicle or machine. In 64 % of these cases the youth fell from and was struck by the vehicle or its <b>trailing</b> <b>implement.</b> CAIS identified an estimated 10, 733 fall-related injuries to youth less than 20 years of age. The mean age was 9, with over three-quarters of the injuries occurring to males. Approximately 37 % of the injuries were incurred while the youth was performing work or chores on the farm. Eighty-five percent of fall-related injuries occurred to youth living on the farm. Twenty-six percent of the injuries resulted from falling from a vehicle or machine.

40|$|The Vienna Abstract Machine (VAM) is a Prolog machine {{developed}} at the TU Wien. In contrast to the standard implementation technique (Warren Abstract Machine – WAM), an inference in VAM is performed by unifying the goal and head immediately, instead of bypassing arguments through a register interface. We present two implementations for VAM: VAM 2 P and VAM 1 P. VAM 2 P is well suited for an intermediate code emulator (e. g. direct threaded code) which uses two instruction pointers for both goal code and head code. During an inference VAM 2 P fetches one instruction from the goal code, and one instruction from the head code and executes the combined instruction. More optimization is therefore possible, since information about the calling goal {{and the head of}} the clause is available at the same time. VAM performs cheap shallow backtracking, needs less dereferencing and <b>trailing</b> and <b>implements</b> a faster cut. In a Prolog with the occur-check, VAM omits many unnecessary operations.

Univariate, bivariate, and multivariate multinomial logistic regression analyses were utilized to assess relationships between maternal and householdlevel characteristics and maternal health seeking behavior. The outcome of interest was defined into three categories: highest (recommended) : 4 + ANC visits and delivery in health facility and 1 + PNC; lowest: 0 - 3 ANC and delivery outside of health facility and 0 - 1 PNC; middle: all other care patterns. Preliminary findings indicate that 19. 1 % of women achieved the highest level, 67. 9 % achieved the middle level, and 13. 0 % achieved the lowest level. Multivariate analysis revealed parity as a significant predictor of care-seeking with women in their first pregnancy being 5. 73 times (95 % CI: 1. 99 - 15. 96; p < 0. 001) more likely to achieve the recommended level of care and 3. 49 times (95 % CI: 1. 37 - 9. 38; p < 0. 01) more likely to achieve the middle level of care than the lowest level. Wealth Index was also a significant predictor of health seeking behavior with those in the highest wealth index being 4. 11 times (95 % CI: 1. 86 - 9. 11; p < 0. 000) more likely to achieve the recommended level of care and 3. 13 times (95 % CI: 1. 57 - 6. 25; p < 0. 001) more likely to achieve the middle level than the lowest level.

The nanoscalar architecture and percolation characteristics of the hybrid were optimized in order to fulfil the in situ acquisition of dynamic elastic disturbance from low-frequency vibration to high-frequency ultrasonic waves. Dynamic particulate motion induced by elastic disturbance modulates the infrastructure of the CB conductive network in the sensor, {{with the introduction of}} the tunneling effect, leading to dynamic alteration in the piezoresistivity measured by the sensor. Electrical analysis, morphological characterization, and static/dynamic electromechanical response interrogation were implemented to advance our insight into the sensing mechanism of the sensor, and meanwhile facilitate understanding of the optimal percolation threshold. At the optimal threshold (∼ 6. 5 wt%), the sensor exhibits high fidelity, a fast response, and high sensitivity to ultrafast elastic disturbance (in an ultrasonic regime up to 400 kHz), yet with an ultralow magnitude (on the order of micrometers). The performance of the sensor was evaluated against a conventional strain gauge and piezoelectric transducer, showing excellent coincidence, yet a much greater gauge factor and frequency-independent piezoresistive behavior.

40|$|Surface {{spreading}} of slurry {{leads to}} the inevitable emission of ammonia into the environment. Injection of slurry on grassland reduces these emissions. However, injection of slurry by deep working injector tines with goose foot chisels (wings) requires high draught forces. This type of injection has {{the risk of the}} crop dying back under dry soil conditions and is not possible on all soil types. In recent years, new slurry application techniques for grassland have been developed that achieve a large reduction in emissions of ammonia, but require less draught force. These techniques include cutting a shallow slit in the sward, into which slurry is applied, and application of the slurry in bands on the soil surface using a <b>trailing</b> foot <b>implement.</b> In a series of experiments on sandy loam, day and peat soils, the draught force requirement of single elements of five new slurry application techniques was investigated. The application techniques were a trailed sliding foot element and four shallow injection elements: angled-disc coulters (double-disc opener), thick-disc coulter, flat disc coulter followed by a vertical injection coulter and knife coulter followed by a vertical injection coulter. The application technique, working depth and soil conditions had a significant influence on the draught force. For a working depth of 5 cm, the required draught forces per shallow injector element, measured in this experiment, were in the range of 202 - 706 N for a double-disc opener, 284 - 991 N for a thick-disc coulter, 361 - 1260 N for a flat-disc coulter plus injector and 389 - 1358 N for a knife coulter plus injector. The lowest draught forces occurred on peat soil and the highest forces on dry clay. The trailing foot required an average draught force of 39 N. The draught force of the trailing foot did not relate to the soil conditions but an effect of the grass sward condition was suggested. (C) 1998 Silsoe Research Institute...|$|R

Recently, the “Conserving Central” Conservation initiative (Development-Bureau 2010) and Redevelopment Projects of the Urban Renewal Authority (Urban-Renewal-Authority 2012) created a window of opportunity to strengthen the interpretation of the Heritage <b>Trail.</b> In <b>implementing</b> the H 18 Graham Street/Peel Street Redevelopment Project, the Urban Renewal Authority also built the Pak Tsz Lane Park to celebrate the history of the Fu-ren Literary Society (The Chinese Patriotic Mutual Improvement Association), one of the pioneers in advancing the Western learning and calling for the Modernization of China (Urban-Renewal-Authority 2012). These interpretation efforts also invite study of the effectiveness of interpretation. The Police Married Quarters conservation project will unveil the history of the Central College attended by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, {{with the assistance of the}} discovered foundation of the Central College (PMQ 2013). The Headquarters of the Fu-ren Literary Society was situated in Pak Tsz Lane. The built structure which housed the headquarters is non-existent. Prior to the construction of the Pak Tsz Lane Park, the site was under the management of three Government departments (Central-and-Western-District-Council 2009, 2). The site consisted of playground facilities, a plant nursery and a public passageway. Opened in 2011, the Pak Tsz Lane Park consists of a Historic Pavilion, a Historic corridor and educational playground facilities, which serve to inform the visitors of the history of the activities of the Fu-ren Literary Society (Urban-Renewal-Authority 2012). published_or_final_versionConservationMasterMaster of Science in Conservatio...|$|R
