5|$|Amenemhat IV {{may have}} been the son, {{grandson}} or step-son of his predecessor, the powerful Amenemhat III. His reign started with a two-year coregency with Amenemhat III and was seemingly peaceful. He undertook expeditions in <b>the</b> <b>Sinai</b> for turquoise, in Upper Egypt for amethyst and to the Land of Punt. He also maintained trade relations with Byblos as well as the Egyptian presence in Nubia. Amenemhat IV built some parts of the temple of Hathor at Serabit el-Khadim in <b>the</b> <b>Sinai</b> and constructed the well-preserved temple of Renenutet in Medinet Madi.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the First World War, the Egyptian police controlling <b>the</b> <b>Sinai</b> Peninsula had withdrawn, leaving the area largely unprotected. In February 1915, a German and Ottoman force unsuccessfully attacked the Suez Canal. Minor Ottoman and Bedouin forces operating across <b>the</b> <b>Sinai</b> continued to threaten the canal from March through the Gallipoli Campaign until June, when they practically ceased until the autumn. Meanwhile, the German and Ottoman Empires supported an uprising by the Senussi (a political-religious group) on the western frontier of Egypt which began in November 1915.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} Egyptian commanders wanted {{to carry out}} a general war to regain at least a {{significant}} part of <b>the</b> <b>Sinai.</b> This view was notably held by the Minister of War, General Mohammed Ahmed Sadek. However, in January 1972 Sadek acknowledged that Egypt's Armed Forces were not ready for a land reclamation war before some five to ten years. Sadek cited studies in opposition of a limited offensive; Egyptian analyses estimated 17,000 casualties in a canal crossing, while Soviet estimates placed casualty figures at 35,000 troops. Sadek stressed the immense losses that would be sustained would overshadow any military and political gains from a limited offensive, which required following up by liberating all or most of <b>the</b> <b>Sinai.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of the Gallipoli Campaign, both sides had large numbers of troops available for redeployment, and the British decided to move their Suez Canal defences from positions on the canal eastwards into <b>the</b> <b>Sinai</b> desert. Murray aimed to extend the railway and water pipeline to Katia, so that a permanent forward Imperial base of 50,000 men could be established. In February 1916, he requested permission from the War Office in London to extend this infrastructure further across <b>the</b> <b>Sinai</b> to El Arish. He considered that such an advance along the northern route, combined with the destruction of the central route's water sources and regular patrols from a base at El Arish, would permanently secure the Suez Canal. An advance to Katia was agreed by the War Office, but no decision was made regarding an advance to El Arish.|$|E

5|$|After the {{withdrawal}} from Gallipoli the Australians returned to Egypt and the AIF underwent a major expansion. In 1916 the infantry {{began to move}} to France while the cavalry units remained in the Middle East to fight the Turks. Australian troops of the Anzac Mounted Division and the Australian Mounted Division saw action in all the major battles of <b>the</b> <b>Sinai</b> and Palestine Campaign, playing {{a pivotal role in}} fighting the Turkish troops that were threatening British control of Egypt. The Australian's first saw combat during the Senussi uprising in the Libyan Desert and the Nile Valley, during which the combined British forces successfully put down the primitive pro-Turkish Islamic sect with heavy casualties. The Anzac Mounted Division subsequently saw considerable action in the Battle of Romani against the Turkish between 3–5 August 1916, with the Turks eventually pushed back. Following this victory the British forces went on the offensive in <b>the</b> <b>Sinai,</b> although the pace of the advance was governed by the speed by which the railway and water pipeline could be constructed from the Suez Canal. Rafa was captured on 9 January 1917, while the last of the small Turkish garrisons in <b>the</b> <b>Sinai</b> were eliminated in February.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the First World War, the Egyptian police who had controlled <b>the</b> <b>Sinai</b> Desert were withdrawn, leaving the area largely unprotected. In February 1915, a German and Ottoman force unsuccessfully attacked the Suez Canal. After the Gallipoli Campaign, a second joint German and Ottoman force again advanced across the desert to threaten the canal, during July 1916. This force was defeated in August at the Battle of Romani, after which the Anzac Mounted Division, also known as the A. & N. Z. Mounted Division, under the command of the Australian major general Harry Chauvel, pushed the Ottoman Army's Desert Force commanded by the German general Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein out of Bir el Abd and across <b>the</b> <b>Sinai</b> to El Arish.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} March {{or early}} in April 1916, the British {{presence}} in <b>the</b> <b>Sinai</b> was growing; 16 miles (26km) of track, including sidings, had been laid. Between 21 March and 11 April, the water sources at Wady Um Muksheib, Moya Harab and Jifjafa along the central Sinai route from southern Palestine were destroyed. In 1915, they had {{been used by the}} central group of about 6,000 or 7,000 Ottoman soldiers who moved across <b>the</b> <b>Sinai</b> Desert to attack the Suez Canal at Ismailia. Without these wells and cisterns, the central route could no longer be used by large forces.|$|E

5|$|On 29 October 1956, Israeli forces crossed <b>the</b> <b>Sinai</b> Peninsula, {{overwhelmed}} Egyptian army posts, {{and quickly}} advanced to their objectives.

Moreover, he feared that if the armored corps was dispatched to confront the Israeli invading force and the British and French subsequently landed in the canal city of Port Said, Egyptian armor in <b>the</b> <b>Sinai</b> would be {{cut off from the}} canal and destroyed by the combined tripartite forces. Amer strongly disagreed, insisting that Egyptian tanks meet the Israelis in battle. The two had a heated exchange on 3 November, and Amer conceded.
