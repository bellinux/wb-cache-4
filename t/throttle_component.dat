40|$|High {{pressure}} reducing valve (HPRV) is widely used for pressure and temperature control of heated steams in power plant and other related process engineering. The structures of <b>throttling</b> <b>components</b> inside HPRVs have important effects on the control performances. In this paper, a parametric study of <b>throttling</b> <b>components</b> in a multi-stage high {{pressure reducing}} valve (MSHPRV) is carried out, including the relative angle of inner and outer porous shrouded holes, the orifice plate thickness, the number of orifice plates and the diameter of plate holes. A numerical model is established to investigate internal flow and throttling characteristics with RNG k-ε model, and it is validated by the theoretical flux calculation. The results show that, the relative angle set as 180 ° can obtain the largest decompression pressure when steam flows through porous shrouded valve core, while the turbulence degree is the lowest. Setting one orifice plate can decrease the turbulent dissipation rate. The plate thickness has less influence on throttling effects. For ensuring the outlet flux, plate holes with smaller diameters should be chosen with a better flowing property on thermodynamic parameters. The work can be referred by the design work of <b>throttling</b> <b>components</b> in MSHPRV and it can also benefit the further research on similar HPRVs...|$|R

40|$|During some flight programs, {{researchers}} have encountered {{problems in the}} throttle response characteristics of high-performance aircraft. To study and to help solve these problems, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Ames Research Center's Dryden Flight Research Facility (Ames-Dryden) conducted a study using a TF- 104 G airplane modified with a variable-response electronic throttle control system. Ames-Dryden investigated the effects of different variables on engine response and handling qualities. The system provided transport delay, lead and lag filters, second-order lags, command rate and position limits, and variable gain between the pilot's throttle command and the engine fuel controller. These variables could be tested individually or in combination. Ten research flights were flown to gather data on engine response and to obtain pilot ratings of the various system configurations. The results should provide design criteria for engine-response characteristics. The variable-response <b>throttle</b> <b>components</b> {{and how they were}} installed in the TF- 104 G aircraft are described. How the variable-response throttle was used in flight and some of the results of using this system are discussed...|$|R

The major activities of Automation stem from manufacturing industries and include cycle time improvement, productivity improvement, cost reduction, efficiency improvement, materials handling, analyze and improve the work methods, to eliminate waste and proper allocation and utilization of resources. Automation in a manufacturing shop {{is one of the}} most challenging tasks, as it has an impact of many interrelated variables and parameters. A detailed study by large data acquisition and analysis is essential for understanding the trends in productivity improvement.

40|$|Hydrogen {{fuel cell}} {{electric}} vehicle (FCEV) can achieve zero exhaust emission and zero pollution. In {{order to make}} FCEV reach a farther travel distance, greater demands are put on its pressure reducing system. In this paper, a two-step high pressure reducing system for FCEV is proposed. The system {{is made up of}} two parts, a new high multi-stage pressure reducing valve (HMSPRV) and a multi-stage muffler. As a new system, its feasibility has to be verified. Since the valve opening condition has a great effect on hydrogen flow, pressure reduction and energy consumption, different valve opening conditions are taken as the research point. The flow field analysis of the new HMSPRV is conducted on three aspects: pressure field, velocity field and energy consumption. It can be found that both the pressure reducing and velocity increasing gradients mainly reflect at those <b>throttling</b> <b>components</b> for all valve openings. For energy consumption, in the comprehensive study of flow vortexes and turbulent dissipation rate, it can be found that the larger of the valve opening, the larger of energy consumption. Then, a thermo-fluid-solid coupling analysis is conducted on the new HMSPRV, and it is concluded that the new system meets strength requirement. Furthermore, as the second step of the high pressure reducing system, the flow and pressure fields of multi-stage muffler are investigated. The five-stage muffler is exactly designed to complete the whole pressure reducing process. This study can provide technological support for achieving pressure regulation in the hydrogen transport system of FCEV when facing complex conditions, and it can also benefit the further research work on energy saving and multi-stage flow of pressure reducing devices...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen {{refueling}} {{station is}} one of the most important parts for the hydrogen energy utilization. In this paper, a novel high multi-stage pressure reducing valve (HMSPRV) is proposed, which can be used for hydrogen stable decompression in hydrogen refueling station. In HMSPRV, the inner and outer porous shrouded valve core is used to replace piston valve core to achieve the first-stage throttling, and the porous orifice plate is chosen as the second-stage <b>throttling</b> <b>component.</b> Meanwhile, in order to verify the applicability of HMSPRV, the flow characteristics of two fluids are studied. Firstly, the choked flow, flow and temperature characteristics of superheated steam under different valve openings are carried out. Secondly, the flow characteristic of hydrogen is also conducted to validate the application of HMSPRV in hydrogen refueling station. The results show that, for superheated steam flow, with the increasing of valve openings, the maximum gradient of fluid pressure moves from the fitting surface where inner and outer porous shrouded to the orifice plate. The regulation of its amount is decreasing first and then increasing. With the increasing of valve openings, the maximum velocity, turbulent dissipation rate and pressure loss are all increasing gradually, while the temperature does not change significantly. For hydrogen flow, both the pressure changing process and velocity changing process are similar to superheated steam. It can be concluded that HMSPRV has good flow and temperature characteristics in complex conditions, and it does not prone to choked flow. Throttling effect of the multi-stage pressure reducing way is obvious. This work can benefit the further research work on hydrogen stable decompression in hydrogen refueling station...|$|R
40|$|Liquid-Propellant Rocket Engines (LREs) {{are capable}} of on-command {{variable}} thrust or thrust modulation, an operability advantage that has been studied intermittently since the late 1930 s. Throttleable LREs {{can be used for}} planetary entry and descent, space rendezvous, orbital maneuvering including orientation and stabilization in space, and hovering and hazard avoidance during planetary landing. Other applications have included control of aircraft rocket engines, limiting of vehicle acceleration or velocity using retrograde rockets, and ballistic missile defense trajectory control. Throttleable LREs can also continuously follow the most economical thrust curve in a given situation, compared to discrete throttling changes over a few select operating points. The effects of variable thrust on the mechanics and dynamics of an LRE as well as difficulties and issues surrounding the throttling process are important aspects of throttling behavior. This review provides a detailed survey of LRE throttling centered around engines from the United States. Several LRE throttling methods are discussed, including high-pressure-drop systems, dual-injector manifolds, gas injection, multiple chambers, pulse modulation, throat <b>throttling,</b> movable injector <b>components,</b> and hydrodynamically dissipative injectors.

40|$|Physics-of-failure (PoF) is an {{approach}} that utilizes knowledge of a product's life cycle loading and failure mechanisms to perform reliability modeling, design, and assessment. Prognostics {{is the process of}} predicting the future reliability of a system by assessing the extent of deviation or degradation of a product from its expected normal operating states. When prognostics is combined with physics-of-failure models, it is possible to make continuously updated reliability predictions based on the monitoring of the actual environmental and operational conditions of each individual product. A literature review showed that the research on prognostics of solder joint reliability under vibration loading is very limited. However, personal portable electronic products are no longer used exclusively in a benign office environment. For example, any electronic <b>component</b> (<b>throttles,</b> brakes, or steering) in an automobile should be able to survive in a vibration environment. In this thesis, a methodology was developed for monitoring, recording, and analyzing the life-cycle vibration loads for remaining-life prognostics of solder joints. The responses of printed circuit boards (PCB) to vibration loading were monitored using strain gauges and accelerometers, and they were further transferred to solder strain and stress for damage assessment using a failure fatigue model. Damage estimates were accumulated using Miner's rule after every mission and then used to predict the life consumed and the remaining life. The results were verified by experimentally measuring component lives through real-time daisy-chain resistance measurements. This thesis also presents an uncertainty assessment method for remaining life prognostics of solder joints under vibration loading. Basic steps include uncertainty source categorization, sensitivity analysis, uncertainty propagation, and remaining life probability calculation. Five types of uncertainties were categorized, including measurement uncertainty, parameter uncertainty, model uncertainty, failure criteria uncertainty, and future usage uncertainty. Sensitivity analysis was then used to identify the dominant input variables that influence model output. After that, a Monte Carlo simulation was used for uncertainty propagation and to provide a distribution of accumulated damage. From the accumulated damage distributions, the remaining life was then able to be predicted with confidence intervals. The results showed that the experimentally measured failure time was within the bounds of the uncertainty analysis prediction...|$|R
