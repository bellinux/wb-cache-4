5|$|A {{loud and}} active bird, the red wattlebird {{is found in}} pairs, in a small family group, or alone during the {{breeding}} season, and gathers in larger groups of up to several hundred birds over winter.

5|$|A {{photo of}} a dazed Tittle {{in the end zone}} taken by Morris Berman of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on September 20, 1964, is {{regarded}} among the most iconic images in the history of American sports and journalism.

He suffered a concussion and cracked sternum on the play, but went on to play the rest of the season.|$|E
5|$|A revitalised Parthian Empire renewed its {{assault in}} 161 AD, {{defeating}} two Roman armies and invading Armenia and Syria. Emperor Lucius Verus and general Gaius Avidius Cassius were sent in 162 AD {{to counter the}} resurgent Parthia. In this war, the Parthian city of Seleucia on the Tigris was destroyed and the palace at the capital Ctesiphon was burned to <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>by</b> Avidius Cassius in 164 AD.

5|$|By {{the end of}} U.S. {{military}} operations in Iraq in December 2011, several Apache helicopters had been shot down by enemy fire, and others lost in accidents. In 2006, an Apache was downed by a Soviet-made Strela 2 (SA-7) in Iraq, despite the Apache being typically able to avoid such missiles. In 2007, four Apache helicopters were destroyed on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>by</b> insurgent mortar fire using web-published geotagged photographs taken by soldiers. Several AH-64s were lost to accidents in Afghanistan as of 2012. Most Apaches that took heavy damage were able to continue their missions and return safely.|$|E
5|$|Cool air, {{carried to}} <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>by</b> {{thunderstorm}} downdraft, cuts off the inflow of the thunderstorm, destroying its updraft and causing its dissipation. Tornadoes, which form within stronger thunderstorms, grow {{until they reach}} their mature stage. This is when the rear flank downdraft of the thunderstorm, fed by rain-cooled air, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of warm air which previously fed the tornado. When thunderstorms are able to organize into squall lines, a feature known as a rear inflow jet develops {{to the south of}} the mid-level circulation associated with its northern bookend vortex. This leads to an erosion of rain within the broad rain shield behind the squall line, and may lead to acceleration of the squall line itself.|$|E
5|$|During {{its limited}} {{use as a}} {{first-class}} cricket ground, only one century was scored on <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> <b>by</b> Jim Parks. During the 1937 match, he scored 140 runs for Sussex. The most wickets taken by a bowler in a match at West Hendford was achieved in 1938, when Hampshire's Stuart Boyes took twelve wickets, including nine in the first innings. Somerset's only success on the ground was in 1936 against Worcestershire, who they dismissed for 60 runs in the first innings, and 77 in the second.|$|E

5|$|England resumed on {{the second}} day at 231/7 and Australia was unable to break through with the new ball. Bedser stubbornly defied the Australians for 145 minutes, adding 37 and {{featuring}} in a 121-run partnership with Compton before he was run out. Soon after, Pollard pulled a ball from Johnson into the ribs of Barnes, who was standing at short leg. Barnes had to be carried from <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>by</b> four policemen and taken to hospital for an examination. Toshack then bowled Pollard and Young was caught from Johnston's bowling as England were bowled out for 363. Compton was unbeaten on 145 in 324 minutes of batting, having struck 16 fours. Lindwall took 4/99 and Johnston 3/67. Miller did not bowl and the remaining four frontline bowlers sent down at least 38 overs each.|$|E
5|$|Homing pigeons {{were used}} {{extensively}} in the 19th and early 20thcenturies, both for civil pigeon post and as war pigeons. In the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, the famous pigeon post of Paris carried up to 50,000microfilmed telegrams per pigeon flight from Tours into the besieged capital. Altogether 150,000 individual private telegrams and state dispatches were delivered. In an 1889 experiment of the Imperial Russian Technical Society at Saint Petersburg, {{the chief of the}} Russian balloon corps took aerial photographs from a balloon and sent the developed collodion film negatives to <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>by</b> pigeon post.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the SIP-method as a low-vibration, low-noise engineering method. <b>The</b> <b>ground</b> vibrations caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> SIP-method were measured and analyzed in each step. From the analysis results, quantitative ground vibration values and reliable vibration estimation equations were proposed. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> vibrations caused <b>by</b> <b>the</b> SIP-method were compared with <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> vibrations caused <b>by</b> other methods presented by existing studies. Based on the vibration esti-mation equation with 50 % reliability, <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> vibration values <b>by</b> <b>the</b> SIP-method at the distance of 10 ~ 150 m corresponded to 17 ~ 57 % of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> vibration values <b>by</b> <b>the</b> equation proposed by Attewell & Famer, and 14 ~ 96 % of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> vibration values <b>by</b> <b>the</b> equation proposed by Prof. Park in his study using a diesel drop hammer.

5|$|In {{terms of}} rushing offense, {{the two teams}} {{differed}} wildly. Virginia Tech, led by Vick, ran for 278rushing yards. Florida State, meanwhile, ran for just 30yards. The Seminoles were led on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>by</b> Chaney, who carried the ball four times for 43yards, and Minor, who carried the ball nine times for 35yards. Much of these two players' rushing total was negated by Chris Weinke, who lost 41yards on seven carries. Virginia Tech, bolstered by Vick's 97rushing yards, also saw André Kendrick accumulate 69yards and two touchdowns with 12carries and Shyrone Stith pick up 68yards on 11carries.|$|E
5|$|Ixodid ticks require three hosts, {{and their}} life cycle {{takes at least}} one year to complete. Up to 3,000 eggs are laid on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>by</b> an adult female tick. When the larvae emerge, they feed {{primarily}} on small mammals and birds. After feeding, they detach from their host and molt to nymphs on the ground, which then feed on larger hosts and molt to adults. Female adults attach to larger hosts, feed, and lay eggs, while males feed very little and occupy larger hosts primarily for mating.|$|E

While driving through the forest, their truck hits caltrops left in <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>by</b> eco-terrorists, forcing them to walk the rest of the way. Upon arriving at the camp site, Mulder and Scully find the cabins abandoned and the communication equipment destroyed.

5|$|Lizards have skulls {{with only}} one fenestra on each side, the lower bar of bone below the second fenestra having been lost. This results in the jaws being less rigidly {{attached}} which allows the mouth to open wider. Lizards are mostly quadrupeds, with the trunk held off <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>by</b> short, sideways-facing legs, but a few species have no limbs and resemble snakes. Lizards have moveable eyelids, eardrums are present and some species have a central parietal eye.|$|E
5|$|On 22 October 1910, Millwall {{crossed the}} river to South London, moving to Cold Blow Lane in New Cross. The fifth ground was called The Den, built {{at a cost of}} £10,000 by noted {{football}} ground architect Archibald Leitch. The first game played there was against Brighton & Hove Albion, which Brighton won 1–0. Millwall remained there for 83 years, until moving to their sixth and current ground, at first known as The New Den but now called simply The Den, on 4 August 1993. The ground has an all-seated capacity of 20,146. A Sporting Lisbon team, managed by Bobby Robson helped open <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>by</b> playing a friendly, which The Lions lost 2–1.|$|E

This partition on 16th parallel (the so-called Red Line) into Libyan and French zones of influence was informally recognised by France in 1984, following an accord between France and Libya to withdraw their forces from Chad. The accord was not respected by Libya, which maintained at least 3,000 men stationed in northern Chad.|$|E
