5|$|As a {{tropical}} storm, Iris produced heavy rainfall {{across much of}} the Leeward Islands. In the southern Lesser Antilles, high waves caused coastal flooding in Trinidad, while in Martinique further north, significant amounts of precipitation led to flooding and landslides. <b>The</b> <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> the hurricane halted airplane evacuations on Montserrat, which was being threatened by the eruption of the Soufrière Hills volcano. There were five deaths in association with Irisfour in Martinique, and one in Guadeloupe.|$|E
5|$|Brazil {{actively}} pursued ways {{to eliminate}} <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> Rosas. In 1851, it {{allied with the}} Argentine breakaway provinces of Corrientes and Entre Rios (led by Justo José de Urquiza), and the anti-Rosas Colorado party in Uruguay. Brazil next secured the south-western flank by signing defensive alliances with Paraguay and Bolivia. Faced with an offensive alliance against his regime, Rosas declared war on Brazil.|$|E

5|$|In 907 Chester was refortified against <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> the Vikings, {{and shortly}} {{afterwards}} the minster was founded or refounded, and Werburgh's remains were transferred there from Hanbury, probably by Æthelflæd, Lady of the Mercians. The collegiate church, {{as it was}} then, was restored in 1057 by Leofric, Earl of Mercia and Lady Godiva. This church was razed to the ground around 1090, with the secular canons evicted, and no known trace of it remains.|$|E

5|$|Over {{a stretch}} of four days, sixteen {{tropical}} cyclone watches and warnings were issued in association with Iris, affecting the Dominican Republic, the Cuban provinces of Granma and Santiago de Cuba, Jamaica, Cayman Islands, the Yucatán Peninsula, Guatemala, Honduras and Belize. <b>The</b> <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> Iris prompted the Jamaica National Emergency Operations Center to be activated.

Initially it was managed by Robert de Emeldon, a merchant from Newcastle, and protected by a garrison of 40 men at arms and 40 light horsemen. Roger Maduit, a politically rehabilitated former member of Thomas's army, was appointed as constable, followed by Sir John de Lilburn, a Northumberland schavaldour in 1323, who was in turn replaced by Roger Heron.|$|E
5|$|Three {{weeks after}} {{the failure of the}} operation, a second attack was {{launched}} which proved more successful in sinking a blockship {{at the entrance to the}} canal but ultimately did not close off Bruges completely.

5|$|After {{the start}} of World War I in August 1914, Wittelsbach was brought back to active duty in the IV Battle Squadron. The ship saw limited duty in the Baltic Sea, {{including}} during the Battle of the Gulf of Riga in August 1915, but she saw no combat with Russian forces. By late 1915, crew shortages and <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> British submarines forced the Kaiserliche Marine to withdraw older battleships like Wittelsbach. The ship then saw service in auxiliary roles, first as a training ship {{and then as a}} ship's tender. After the war, she was converted into a tender for minesweepers in 1919. In July 1921, the ship was sold and broken up for scrap metal.|$|E

5|$|At {{some point}} {{following}} {{the fall of}} the Western Roman Empire, a retrenchment was built within the city, reducing it to its present size. This was done to make the city's perimeter more easily defensible, and similar reductions in city sizes were common around the Mediterranean region in the early Middle Ages. Although it was traditionally assumed that the retrenchment was built by the Arabs, {{it has been suggested that}} it was actually built by the Byzantine Empire in around the 8th century, when <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> the Arabs increased.|$|E
5|$|By late 1915, crew {{shortages}} and <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> British submarines forced the Kaiserliche Marine to withdraw older battleships like Braunschweig, and {{she spent the}} rest of the war first as a headquarters ship, then as a training ship, and finally as a barracks ship. Under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, she was retained after the end of the war and modernized in 1921–22. Braunschweig served in the reformed Reichsmarine, where she operated as the flagship of naval forces assigned to the North Sea. She made several cruises abroad, including a voyage into the Atlantic in 1924. The ship was decommissioned again in January 1926 and was stricken from the naval register in March 1931, hulked, and subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Governor Rick Perry {{activated}} the National Guard and mobilized emergency personnel {{to the region}} expected {{to be affected by}} the storm. Erin was expected to bring flooding to the region, which had already been declared a disaster area on August 7, 2007 due to widespread flooding on the Nueces River basin; this area remained flooded as of August 15, 2007. On August 15, oil futures rose to $74.01 (USD), due to fears of Erin disrupting oil supplies produced on Texan coasts, combined with low oil inventories. As a result of <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> the storm, Shell Oil Company evacuated 188workers on oil platforms in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Italy {{declared}} neutrality at {{the start}} of World War I, but by July 1915, the Triple Entente had convinced the Italians to enter the war against the Central Powers. Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that Austro-Hungarian submarines could operate too effectively in the narrow waters of the Adriatic, which could also be easily seeded with minefields. <b>The</b> <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> these underwater weapons was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way. Instead, Revel decided to implement blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the main fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS boats, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations.|$|E

5|$|Members of the Republican Army who {{had come}} from Indonesian Hizbullah felt betrayed by the Indonesian Government. In May 1948, they {{declared}} a break-away regime, the Negara Islam Indonesia (Indonesian Islamic State), better known as Darul Islam. Led by an Islamic mystic, Sekarmadji Maridjan Kartosuwirjo, Darul Islam sought to establish Indonesia as an Islamic theocracy. At the time, the Republican Government did not respond, as they were focused on <b>the</b> <b>threat</b> <b>from</b> the Dutch. Some leaders of Masjumi sympathised with the rebellion. After the Republic regained all territories in 1950, the government took the Darul Islam threat seriously, especially after some provinces declared that they had joined Darul Islam. The rebellion was put down in 1962.|$|E
