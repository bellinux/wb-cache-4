5|$|Across the Way is a 1915 American silent {{short film}} {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company under <b>the</b> <b>Princess</b> brand. The comedy-drama involves a man named Sparks playing a trick on his friend to make him question his sanity. The trick involves the friend's love interest being attacked by an assailant which works, but then a burglar attacks her a few days later. The friend saves his love interest from the burglar and later marries him instead of Sparks. <b>The</b> <b>Princess</b> comedy-dramas were not well-received {{and it was not}} long after the film's release that Edwin Thanhouser took a personal interest in the productions at the New Rochelle studio. Soon thereafter, <b>the</b> <b>Princess</b> brand was discontinued and replaced by the Falstaff brand. The film is presumed to be lost.|$|E

5|$|At <b>the</b> <b>Princess,</b> sound {{installation}} {{was completed}} by August 16. An entire page of the Edmonton Bulletin was devoted to the reopening, including a congratulating ad from a local record store, an ad for the electrical contractors who installed the wiring, and a message congratulating <b>the</b> <b>Princess</b> placed by the managers of three other establishments already wired for sound: the Rialto, Empress and Capitol Theatres. The physical renovations necessary to accommodate the new wiring were carried out by S. H. Muttart, an important local builder and namesake of the Muttart Conservatory in Edmonton’s River Valley. The first talkie screened at <b>the</b> <b>Princess</b> was Close Harmony starring Buddy Rogers and Nancy Carroll.|$|E
5|$|At the time, <b>the</b> <b>Princess</b> was {{considered}} a showpiece of elegance and modernity. It was the first building west of Winnipeg to be faced with marble. The Edmonton Journal remarked {{on the quality of}} the “photoplay house’s” finishings, remarking on the solid marble facade, frescoes, brass mirrors and the abundance of gold leaf decoration. On the technical side, two modern projectors were housed in their own fireproof machine room. <b>The</b> <b>Princess</b> was serviced by a freight elevator, which was an unusual feature for a building of its size, and the theatre lighting was indirect and gentle on theatregoers’ eyes. The Journal was also impressed by three novel firsts for a movie theatre in Edmonton: an electric ticketing machine, an “electric time-projecting clock”, and a refrigerated drinking fountain. Perhaps most importantly, the forced air ventilation system was capable of filtering, heating, and cooling air and featured dedicated intake and output fans making <b>the</b> <b>Princess</b> by far the most comfortable theatre in Edmonton.|$|E

5|$|By 1916, <b>the</b> <b>Princess</b> {{had stopped}} booking live acts and was {{focusing}} {{exclusively on the}} more profitable cinema side of the business.

Two generals set out in search, but having spent all their money without finding <b>the</b> <b>princesses,</b> were forced to work as servants to repay an innkeeper for the food and drink he had given them.|$|R

Ostapchuk began major renovations to the theatre, and in 1999 unveiled <b>The</b> <b>Princess</b> II in Chinook Theatre’s old space.

5|$|After {{finding the}} fifth and final Scroll, the Sky Scroll, Musashi discovers Thirstquencher's base, a {{floating}} ship known as the Soda Fountain. Musashi attacks the base and defeats the Sky Guardian. Thirstquencher's leader, Flatski, forces Musashi to give him Lumina in exchange for <b>the</b> <b>Princess,</b> and frees the Sky Crest. However, this unleashes the Wizard of Darkness, who was sealed within Brave Fencer Musashi's sword Lumina the entire time. It is also revealed by Jon that the original Brave Fencer Musashi sealed The Dark Wizard within the sword. Furthermore, it was Brave Fencer Musashi who entrusted the crests to the crest guardians to prevent The Dark Wizard's seal within Lumina from being broken. In effect, the present Musashi's quest merely aided The Dark Wizard's revival. Musashi recovers Lumina and uses it to defeat The Dark Wizard.

His grandmother, father and uncle all approved the match, but the mothers—the Princess of Wales and the Duchess of Edinburgh—both opposed it. <b>The</b> <b>Princess</b> of Wales thought the family was too pro-German, and the Duchess of Edinburgh disliked England. Marie's mother was the only daughter of Tsar Alexander II of Russia. She resented the fact that, as the wife of a younger son of the British sovereign, she had to yield precedence to George's mother, <b>the</b> <b>Princess</b> of Wales, whose father had been a minor German prince before being called unexpectedly to the throne of Denmark. Guided by her mother, Marie refused George when he proposed to her. She married Ferdinand, the heir to the King of Romania, in 1893.|$|E
