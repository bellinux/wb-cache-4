5|$|By {{the time}} Hope was exhibited, Watts had already {{committed}} himself to donate his most significant works <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation,</b> {{and although he}} received multiple offers for the painting he thought it inappropriate not to include Hope in this donation, {{in light of the}} fact that it was already being considered one of his most important pictures. In mid-1886 Watts and his assistant Cecil Schott painted a duplicate of the piece, with the intention that this duplicate be donated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> allowing him to sell the original. Although the composition of this second painting is identical, it is radically different in feel. The central figure is smaller in relation to the globe, and the colours darker and less sumptuous, giving it an intentionally gloomier feel than the original.|$|E

5|$|Reddy was succeeded as President by Giani Zail Singh who {{was sworn}} in on 25 July 1982. In his {{farewell}} address <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation,</b> Reddy criticised the failure of successive governments in improving {{the lives of the}} Indian masses and called for the emergence of a strong political opposition to prevent governmental misrule. Following his presidential term, the then Chief Minister of Karnataka Ramakrishna Hegde invited Reddy to settle down in Bangalore but he chose to retire to his farm in Anantapur. He died of pneumonia in Bangalore in 1996 at the age of 83. His samadhi is at Kallahalli near Bangalore. The Parliament mourned Reddy's death on 11 June 1996 and members cutting across party lines paid him tribute and recalled his contributions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> and the House.|$|E
5|$|Through Henley, Rodin met Robert Louis Stevenson and Robert Browning, in whom {{he found}} further support. Encouraged by {{the enthusiasm of}} British artists, students, and high society for his art, Rodin donated a {{significant}} selection of his works <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> in 1914.|$|E
5|$|Although Watts {{received}} many offers {{to buy the}} painting, he had agreed to donate his most important works <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> and felt {{it would be inappropriate}} not to include Hope. Consequently, later in 1886 Watts and his assistant Cecil Schott painted a second version. On its completion Watts sold the original and donated the copy to the South Kensington Museum (now the Victoria and Albert Museum); thus, this second version is better known than the original. He painted at least two further versions for private sale.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{prosperity}} and modernization PedroII left <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation,</b> {{there was also}} a heritage of political and personal values. Many of his reforms and achievements had become {{so much a part of}} the national consciousness that they were accommodated by successor regimes. These formed the foundation for Brazilian democratic ideals. Historians have also largely agreed that PedroII's reign was not merely benign, but rather, exceptionally constructive and progressive. He has also consistently been ranked by scholars as the greatest Brazilian.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} {{socio-economic}} stagnation Brezhnev left <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation,</b> {{there was also}} a heritage of political and personal values. When Brezhnev died he left behind a gerontocracy, a group of leaders who were significantly older than most of the adult population. Historians have largely agreed that Brezhnev's reign was one primarily of stagnation. However, in a poll taken in 2006, 61 percent of the people polled viewed the Brezhnev era as good for Russia.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the hostility}} with which Candaules was met on its exhibition, it {{was bought by}} Robert Vernon, who had made a fortune {{supplying}} horses to the military and was using the proceeds to amass a major art collection. Vernon presented his collection <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> in 1847, although {{in the case of}} Candaules a painting so controversial becoming government property was a source of some embarrassment. In 1929 Candaules was transferred to the newly expanded Tate Gallery, where it remains.|$|E

5|$|In late November, Typhoon Durian brought {{even greater}} devastation to the Philippines and {{prompted}} greater need for international assistance. On December11, President Arroyo declared a national state of calamity and released 1billion PHP (US$25.6million) in relief and rehabilitation funds. Throughout 2006 as a whole, the Philippines was devastated by multiple natural disasters that collectively killed well over 1,000people and left more than US$1.6billion in damage. Consequently, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs appealed for emergency assistance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation,</b> {{in the form}} of US$46million in funds for the most severely affected areas. The European Commission Humanitarian Aid department also provided €2million (US$1.9million) in emergency funds in relation to the four major typhoons that struck the country, with a focus on areas affected by Typhoon Durian. The Red Cross ultimately provided US$9.67million in assistance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> in relation to the four typhoons as well as Typhoon Fengshen in June 2008 which struck while relief efforts from the 2006 storms were still ongoing.|$|E

The plan focused on reducing the deficit rather than on cutting taxes for the middle class, which had been high on his campaign agenda. Clinton's advisers pressured him to raise taxes, based on the theory that a smaller federal budget deficit would reduce bond interest rates.|$|E

In 1849 Hall secured reproduction rights to the 157 paintings which Vernon had given <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>nation</b> but declined to distribute reproductions of Candaules, despite his willingness to publish reproductions of other provocative Etty nudes such as Female Bathers Surprised by a Swan.|$|E
