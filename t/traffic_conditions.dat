40|$|Intelligent {{transportation}} systems {{have become increasingly}} important for the public transportation in Shanghai. In response, ShanghaiGrid (SG) aims to provide abundant intelligent transportation services to improve the <b>traffic</b> <b>condition.</b> A challenging service in SG is to estimate the real-time <b>traffic</b> <b>condition</b> on surface streets. In this paper, we present an innovative approach SEER to tackle this problem. In SEER, we deploy a cost-effective system of taxi traffic sensors. These taxi sensory data {{are found to be}} noisy and very lossy in both time and space. By intensively mining the spatio-temporal correlations along with the evolution of <b>traffic</b> <b>condition,</b> SEER provides wealthy knowledge to setup statistical models for inferring <b>traffic</b> <b>condition</b> when they cannot be directly calculated. As an example, we demonstrate utilizing multi-channel singular spectrum analysis (MSSA) to iteratively produce estimates of <b>traffic</b> <b>condition</b> in a metropolitan scale. The optimal window width of MSSA is determined with the basic periodicity found in <b>traffic</b> <b>condition.</b> Moreover, we minimize the number of channels required by MSSA to estimate <b>traffic</b> <b>condition</b> at any location. Given a desired estimation granularity, we optimize the MSSA parameters to minimize the estimation error. © 2009 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|Travel time {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{understandable}} parameters to describe <b>traffic</b> <b>condition</b> and an important input to many intelligent transportation systems applications. Direct measurement from Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) system is promising but the data arrives too late, only after the vehicles complete their trip. There are several existing models with varying degree of success to indirectly estimate travel time from loop detector. The performance of these models depends significantly on the variation of <b>traffic</b> <b>condition.</b> By closely looking at the time-series of the estimated travel time with the actual travel time, the error was found to follow a specific pattern for each <b>traffic</b> <b>condition.</b> The goal of this research is to develop a simple data fusion between loop detector data and ETC data to make more accurate estimation of instantaneous travel time on expressway corridor. With the error pattern for each <b>traffic</b> <b>condition</b> in mind, it is possible to develop a simple fusion method that can improve the accuracy of travel time estimate even under sparely distributed detectors...|$|R

As the results, it becomes known that the extremely large standard deviations of headaway distribution aggregated by 3 -minutes time duration appear at the period when traffic flow changes from one type of <b>traffic</b> <b>condition</b> to another. According to this result, the criteria to judge <b>traffic</b> <b>condition</b> are proposed based on the standard deviation of time-headway...|$|R
40|$|Urban <b>traffic</b> <b>condition</b> usually {{serves as}} basic {{information}} for some intelligent urban applications, for example, intelligent transportation system. The traditional acquisition of such information is often costly {{because of the}} dependencies on infrastructures, such as cameras and loop detectors. Crowdsensing, as a new economic paradigm, can be utilized together with vehicular networks to efficiently gather vehicle-sensed data for estimating the <b>traffic</b> <b>condition.</b> However, it has the problem of being lack of data uploading efficiency and data usage effectiveness. In this paper, we {{take into account the}} topology of the road net to deal with these problems. Specifically, we divide the road net into road sections and junction areas. Based on this division, we introduce a two-phased data collection and processing scheme named road topology-based scheme. It leverages the correlations among adjacent roads. In a junction area, data collected by vehicles are first processed and integrated by a sponsor vehicle to locally calculate <b>traffic</b> <b>condition.</b> Both the selection of the sponsor and the calculation of road condition utilize the road correlation. The sponsor then uploads the local data to a server. By employing the inherent relations among roads, the server processes data and estimates <b>traffic</b> <b>condition</b> for the road sections without vehicular data in a global vision. We conduct experiments based on real vehicle trace data. The results indicate that our design can commendably handle the problems of efficiency and effectiveness in <b>traffic</b> <b>condition</b> evaluation using the vehicular crowdsensing data...|$|R
