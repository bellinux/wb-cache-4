5|$|The Aniplex {{producer}} of Angel Beats!, Hironori Toba, was interviewed in the November 2009 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine, where he commented that a 13-episode anime with about 21 minutes per episode {{was not enough}} to tell <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> Angel Beats! Maeda had envisioned. Therefore, the various additional media, such as the illustrated short stories and manga, contain some of the story that was unable to make it into the anime because of time constraints. Toba wanted fans of the series to be able to enjoy it to the fullest by exploring all of the media types. Maeda found it tiring to go back and forth between Osaka and Tokyo for business meetings {{when he was in the}} process of writing the script, and found it difficult to write an entire script by himself, since he had never done that before with any of the games he produced as a member of Key. It was only after the script was done that Maeda was able to work on the music, which he greatly enjoyed and never tired of it. Maeda composed about 15 songs for Girls Dead Monster and spent about two days each composing each song. He made sure to create songs for Girls Dead Monster that high school girls would compose, including the lyrics. Due to this, Maeda pointed out that the opening and ending theme songs for Angel Beats!, which Maeda also composed, sound like they were composed by a different person compared to the Girls Dead Monster songs.|$|E

In 1884, with associates, Rogers formed the Consolidated Gas Company, and thereafter for several years he was instrumental in gaining control of great city plants, fighting terrific battles with rivals for some of them, {{as in the case of}} Boston. Almost <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> his natural gas interests was one of business warfare.|$|E

25|$|Shilts's {{writing was}} admired for its {{powerful}} narrative drive, interweaving personal stories with {{political and social}} reporting. Shilts saw himself as a literary journalist {{in the tradition of}} Truman Capote and Norman Mailer. Undaunted by a lack of enthusiasm for his initial proposal for the Harvey Milk biography, Shilts reworked the concept, as he later said, after further reflection: I read Hawaii by James Michener. That gave me the concept for the book, the idea of taking people and using them as vehicles, symbols for different ideas. I would take the life-and-times approach and tell <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> the gay movement in this way, using Harvey as the major vehicle.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of firearms {{does not tell}} <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> the 19th century due to their mixed impact and use in many regions. Indeed, some historians argue that mere advanced technology was not the single most decisive factor {{in the outcome of}} many colonial conquests. More important, was the divided, fragmented nature of many small African polities that enabled them to be defeated separately by their enemies. Such fragmentation is not unique to Africa. Germany for example in 1815, was split into over 30 separate states. Despite these weaknesses, until well into {{the second part of the}} century, many native forces held their own until the coming of modern artillery, machine guns and rifles.|$|E

500|$|Whereas Radiohead {{developed}} In Rainbows {{from their}} live performances, The King of Limbs was developed from studio experimentation. After Godrich and Yorke had {{become interested in}} DJing during their time in Los Angeles, Godrich proposed [...] "an experiment for two weeks where everyone has a turntable instead of playing the guitar or drums or whatever. And that two-week experiment ended up being fucking six months. And that’s that record, <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> all of it." [...] Much of the album is constructed from samples of drum, bass and guitar parts which were looped, manipulated and edited with turntables and vinyl emulation software. The band also used sampling software written by Greenwood, which he described as a [...] "wonky, rubbish version" [...] of Ableton Live.|$|E

Paul Mavis of DVD Talk said, [...] "A fun, 'scary' (for little kids) SpongeBob that adults will appreciate, 'Graveyard Shift' uses the old standby of the headless/handless/legless (take your pick) killer-seeking-revenge stories we all told as kids, and cleverly grafts it onto a 'SpongeBob at work' storyline." [...] Mavis added, [...] "I always enjoy it when Rodger Bumpass, the voice actor for Squidward, gets quiet and {{manipulative}} when he's shining SpongeBob on, and here's {{one of the best}} examples of that." [...] He praised Count Orlok's cameo, [...] "especially when they animate the vampire's face into a goofy, giddy smile." [...] Mike Jackson of DVD Verdict said the episode is one of his [...] "personal faves." [...] He also said [...] " [...] has everything that makes the show great: funny dialogue (<b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> the Hash-Slinging Slasher is hilarious), clever sight gags (especially SpongeBob's regenerating limbs), and that aforementioned outta-nowhere ending that made me bust a gut." ...|$|E

500|$|Historian Robert Bartlett has {{commented that}} [...] "one {{of the largest}} {{uncertainties}} in <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> the death and resurrection of William Cragh is why Lady Mary [...] interceded for him", but intercede she did. John of Baggeham, when questioned about her motivation 18 years after the event, could only reply that [...] "Lady Mary had sought the body of this William, {{he did not know}} why". [...] Before the execution she had asked her husband to spare the two condemned men, but he had refused. Then on hearing that Trahaern ap Hywel was dead, and believing that Cragh was still alive, she once again asked that he be handed over to her, but de Briouze delayed until he was convinced that Cragh was also dead. Then [...] "he granted him [...] to the said lady, such as he was, and ordered him to be taken down from the gallows". Lady Mary had [...] "a special devotion" [...] to Thomas de Cantilupe, the deceased Bishop of Hereford, and in her own words, upon hearing of Cragh's death, [...] "on bended knee, she asked Saint Thomas de Cantilupe to ask God to restore life to William Cragh".|$|E
500|$|Supporters of {{the series}} assert {{that it is a}} worthy {{interpretation}} of the book and that most of the changes were necessary. Many who worked on the series are fans of the book, including Christopher Lee, who (alone among the cast) had actually met Tolkien in person, and Boyens once noted that no matter what, it is simply their interpretation of the book. Jackson once said that to simply summarize the story on screen would be a mess, and in his own words, [...] "Sure, it's not really The Lord of the Rings... but it could still be a pretty damn cool movie." [...] Other fans also claim that, despite any changes, the films serve as a tribute to the book, appealing to those who have not yet read it, and even leading some to do so. The Movie Guide for The Encyclopedia of Arda (an online Tolkien encyclopedia) states that Jackson's films were exceptional since filming <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> The Lord of the Rings was probably impossible. This notion is partially supported by a review published in 2005 that otherwise criticized a lack of [...] "faithfulness to Tolkien's spirit and tone." ...|$|E
500|$|Mythographers have {{discussed}} Orion {{at least since}} the Renaissance of classical learning; the Renaissance interpretations were allegorical. In the 14th century, Boccaccio interpreted the oxhide story as representing human conception; the hide is the womb, Neptune the moisture of semen, Jupiter its heat, and Mercury the female coldness; he also explained Orion's death {{at the hands of the}} moon-goddess as the Moon producing winter storms. The 16th-century Italian mythographer Natalis Comes interpreted <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> Orion as an allegory of the evolution of a storm cloud: Begotten by air (Zeus), water (Poseidon), and the sun (Apollo), a storm cloud is diffused (Chios, which Comes derives from χέω, [...] "pour out"), rises though the upper air (Aërope, as Comes spells Merope), chills (is blinded), and is turned into rain by the moon (Artemis). He also explains how Orion walked on the sea: [...] "Since the subtler part of the water which is rarefied rests on the surface, it is said that Orion learned from his father how to walk on water." [...] Similarly, Orion's conception made him a symbol of the philosophical child, an allegory of philosophy springing from multiple sources, in the Renaissance as in alchemical works, with some variations. The 16th-century German alchemist Michael Maier lists the fathers as Apollo, Vulcan and Mercury, and the 18th-century French alchemist Antoine-Joseph Pernety gave them as Jupiter, Neptune and Mercury.|$|E

500|$|Following {{completion}} of the game, the player finds additional texts that expand the story. The ending {{of the game is}} purposely ambiguous, and has been subject to multiple interpretations. One theory, based on the inclusion of a hidden event and the famous quotation stated by Kenneth Bainbridge after the detonation of the first atomic bomb—"Now we are all sons of bitches"—is that the princess represents the atomic bomb and Tim is a scientist involved in its development. Some also refer to {{the name of the game}} as both reference to the hair braid of the princess Tim seeks as well as the intertwining of time, demonstrated by the various time mechanics explored in the game. Journalists have considered Braids plot to be interwoven with the game itself, much as the book Dictionary of the Khazars and the films Memento and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind interweave the narrative into the work's construction. In this sense, some have considered the game to carry a simple credo, such as [...] "You must look back to go forwards" [...] as suggested by Eurogamer's Dan Whitehead. Others have likened Braid to punk rock, designed (as explicitly stated by Blow) specifically as a statement against the status quo of the industry; it is considered to deconstruct traditional gameplay concepts, such as jumping on enemies or rescuing a princess from a castle as borrowed from Super Mario Bros., and rebuild them in the game to force the player to rethink current game design. Blow has stated that there is more than one interpretation of the story; he [...] "would not be capable" [...] of explaining <b>the</b> <b>whole</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> the game in words, and said that the central idea is [...] "something big and subtle and resists being looked at directly." [...] Blow considered Braid to be [...] "about the journey, not the destination". He deliberately designed the plot not to be fully revealed to the player unless they completed the game, seeing it as a way to provide [...] "a longer-term challenge".|$|E
