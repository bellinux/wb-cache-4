25|$|<b>The</b> <b>plethora</b> <b>of</b> {{religious}} {{names in}} this area – the Kirkmuirs, Kirkhill, Lady Moss, High Cross, Canaan and the Kilbrides, suggest {{that at some point}} in the distant past a pre-Christian and Christian site was located here. No documentary evidence appears to survive and the earliest record is for Kirkry in 1654, now Kilbride. Bride, Brigit or St. Brigid was originally a Celtic Goddess linked with the festival of Imbolc, the eve of the first of February. She was the goddess of spring and was associated with healing and sacred wells. Interestingly the Carlin Stone at Commoncrags in Dunlop is associated with the 'old winter hag', the antithesis of the goddess Bride. The name Canaan at Kirkmuir was in use as early as 1779. In 1922 James Martin and Mary Gilmour purchased Gillmill and Canaan from the Cunninghames of Lainshaw.|$|E
25|$|Both <b>the</b> <b>plethora</b> <b>of</b> {{parties and}} the {{defection}} to the majority party were typical of Somali parliamentary elections. To register for elective office, a candidate merely needed either the support of 500 voters or the sponsorship of his clan, expressed through a vote of its traditional assembly. After registering, the office seeker then attempted to become the official candidate of a political party. Failing this, he would remain on the ballot as an individual contestant. Voting was by party list, which could make a candidate a one-person party. (This practice explained not only the proliferation of small parties but also the transient nature of party support.) Many candidates affiliated with a major party {{only long enough to}} use its symbol in the election campaign and, if elected, abandoned it for the winning side as soon as the National Assembly met.

25|$|Even {{before the}} nullification issue had been settled, another {{controversy}} arose to challenge Jackson's leadership. It concerned the rechartering of the Second Bank of the United States.

After the Revolutionary War, the United States had a large war debt to France and others, and the banking system of the fledgling nation was in disarray, as state banks printed their own currency, and <b>the</b> <b>plethora</b> <b>of</b> different bank notes made commerce difficult.

25|$|Philcoxia is a genus of four rare {{plant species}} in the Plantaginaceae that are endemic to Brazil and {{resemble}} terrestrial species of the genus Utricularia. The genus, formally described in 2000, consists of the species P. bahiensis, P. goiasensis, P. minensis, and P. tuberosa, {{each of the first}} three named for the Brazilian state to which it is endemic. The species are characterized by subterranean stems, peltate leaves at or below the soil surface, and five-lobed calyces. Their habitat has been reported as areas of white sand in the midst of cerrado vegetation at an elevation between 800 and 1450m. Initial descriptions of the genus included suspicions that <b>the</b> <b>plethora</b> <b>of</b> stalked capitate glands on the upper surfaces of leaves was an indication that these species may be carnivorous. A study published in 2007 tested P. minensis for protease activity, a typical test for the carnivorous syndrome, and could detect none. Later studies detected other digestive enzymes such as phosphatases and qualitatively assessed prey digestion and nutrient uptake, suggesting that it is a true carnivorous plant. The genus epithet honors David Philcox, a botanist at Kew Gardens who worked extensively in tropical Scrophulariaceae.|$|E
25|$|The cabin {{exists in}} a rural area off of Forest Road (FR) 245, just to the west of its {{intersection}} with Arizona State Route 373. In 1911, the U.S. Forest Service declared the area which includes the property where Butterfly Lodge sits as a protected area. As part of a program which encouraged U.S. citizens to develop public lands, a long-term lease was issued to Schultz by the local forest ranger. Schultz financial success as a writer and explorer enabled him to build the first cabin by a non-resident in the remote White Mountains. Two men from nearby Greer, Arizona, John T. Butler and Cleve Wiltbank, built the cabin in 1913, intending to be used by James Willard Schultz as a hunting lodge and retreat. The men used ponderosa pine and Douglas fir to build the cabin. Schultz son, Hart Merriam Schultz (also known as Lone Wolf), later put additions on the structure, including an artist's studio. The site was a clearing near a spring, purported to be the headwaters of the Little Colorado River. <b>The</b> <b>plethora</b> <b>of</b> butterflies in the area was the impetus for the name of the cabin. Between 1916 and 1929 three additions were made to the structure, including a bedroom and storage area, an artist's studio, and a kitchen.|$|E

Support for the Direct2Drive version of the game was introduced, as well as a minimalist version of the user interface. Version 3220, released on March 5, 2007, notably removed the SecuROM disk checking from the game. This enables the player to run the game without the game DVD in the DVD drive. Polish, Russian, and Chinese localizations were excluded from this change. Version 3223 included bug fixes only. It has been called a 'specific purpose patch' by the developer Gas Powered Games. Update 3251, was a highly anticipated update, mainly because of <b>the</b> <b>plethora</b> <b>of</b> changes relating to the balance between playable factions.

On July 30, 2007, patch 3260 was released. It included 3 new units, and some bug fixes and tweaks.
