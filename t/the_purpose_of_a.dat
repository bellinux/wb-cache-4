A significant deficit will result in spending cuts or borrowing. Ideally, surpluses and deficits should be small.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the international organization, the Temple sponsors initiatory Orders and Elements and local groups called Pylons. Pylons are intended to facilitate the initiatory work of the Temple's members by conducting meetings where discussions and magical works take place. <b>The</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pylon {{is to provide a}} space in which the Setian can focus on their religion, aided by like-minded individuals. Pylons typically meet in a member's home. Members usually join the Pylon located geographically closest to them. Correspondence- or Internet-based Pylons also exist, with Harvey noting that this online networking is more common than in-person interaction. A Pylon is led a by a second-degree (or higher) member who is called a Sentinel. The term pylon derives from the architectural features which served as fortified gateways to ancient Egyptian temples. One Finnish Setian informed Granholm that the relationship between the orders and the temple was like that of different departments in a university.|$|E

5|$|The NCMP {{scheme was}} {{introduced}} on 22 August 1984 by the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Act 1984 and the Parliamentary Elections (Amendment) Act 1984. Under Article 39(1)(b) of the Constitution which {{was introduced by}} the constitutional amendment Act, {{the maximum number of}} NCMPs was set at six. However, the actual number that could be declared elected at any general election was fixed at three, less the total number of Opposition MPs elected to Parliament. The President, acting on the advice of the Cabinet, could order that between four and six NCMPs be declared elected for <b>the</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> particular general election. Such an order ceased to have effect at the next dissolution of Parliament. On 1 July 2010, the need for a presidential order {{to increase the number of}} NCMPs was removed. Instead, the maximum number of NCMPs in Parliament was increased from six to nine, and the actual number that would be declared elected following a general election would be nine less the number of opposition MPs elected to Parliament.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> castle was {{not simply}} militaristic, but was also {{considered}} to be a stamp of authority over the population of an area and a status symbol. Some would have acted as centres of trade and administration for a manor. The earliest castles in Greater Manchester are Dunham and Watch Hill in Trafford, Ullerwood in Manchester, and Stockport Castle in Stockport. They were first recorded in 1173 as belonging to barons who had rebelled against Henry II, and at least three were motte-and-bailey castles, probably because of the speed and ease with which they could be erected. Hamon de Massey, who owned the Trafford castles and Ullerwood, and Geoffrey de Constentyn, who owned Stockport Castle, were two of the three rebels from Cheshire; the other was the Earl of Chester, the owner of Chester Castle. Castles continued to be built in the area, although the last to be built in Greater Manchester were two fortified manor houses near Bury, built more for comfort than as utilitarian military structures. Bury Castle and Radcliffe Tower followed the national trend in the 13th century; they would most likely have acted as the centre of the manor they served.|$|E

He was {{also involved in}} the building of the North and West Branch Railway between 1880 and 1881. He started raising money for this railroad in 1872 and broke the ground for the railroad in March 1872. Waller put most of his money into the building of the North and West Branch Railway. The work on the railroad stopped during the Panic of 1873 but resumed in 1880. The North and West Branch Railway Company was sold in 1881 but he managed to regain much of the company. The company was leased to the Pennsylvania Railroad on November 23, 1881, but remained its own company for approximately 20 years. He was president of the North and West Branch Railway in the 1880s. In 1888, he sold a piece of land to the town of Bloomsburg for the purpose of building the Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad through it. It was he who initially conceived the idea of the Bloomsburg and Sullivan Railroad. Waller also successfully convinced the Lackawanna and Bloomsburg Railroad to move its Bloomsburg station to his land on Market Street.|$|E
