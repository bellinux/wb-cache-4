Seussical, a musical adaptation that incorporates aspects of many Dr. Seuss works, features the Cat in <b>the</b> <b>Hat</b> as narrator. The musical received weak reviews when it opened, in November 2001, but eventually became a staple in regional and school theaters. The Cat also stars in the 1982 television film The Grinch Grinches the Cat in <b>the</b> <b>Hat</b> and the 2010 animated television series The Cat in <b>the</b> <b>Hat</b> Knows a Lot About That! A ride at Universal Studios' Islands of Adventure park in Orlando, Florida, is based around The Cat in <b>the</b> <b>Hat.</b>|$|E

5|$|The slouch hat was the {{preferred}} choice of many soldiers, including officers. <b>The</b> <b>hat</b> was normally a floppy, wide brimmed, woolen body head-cover, meant {{to protect the}} individual from the sun, and inclement weather. It was normally a civilian hat, of brown, gray, or black wool. This simple hat saw widespread use throughout the Confederate Armies, and even with U.S. Army personnel. Occasionally, <b>the</b> <b>hat</b> was adorned with insignia of the wearer's preference, {{and may have been}} pinned up for the drill {{in the use of the}} regular weapon of the time, the Rifled-musket.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of Men in Black: Alien Attacks development, Universal Creative were {{installing}} two new dark ride systems at the neighbouring Islands of Adventure theme park. The first system was designed for The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man and was manufactured by Oceaneering International. It featured track-mounted motion bases with {{six degrees of freedom}} that were able to tour physical sets and allow riders to view 3D projections. The second system was developed by MTS Systems Corporation for The Cat in <b>the</b> <b>Hat.</b> This system was simpler, offering track-mounted spinning platforms, with no additional degrees of freedom. The MIB design team initially intended to utilise the Spider-Man ride system; however, when shooting tests were performed on the ride, the vast motion of the vehicles made it impossible for riders to achieve a reasonable score. As a result, The Cat in <b>the</b> <b>Hat</b> system was selected for the MIB attraction.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Hats</b> (Hattarna) were a Swedish {{political}} faction active {{during the}} Age of Liberty (1719-1772). Their name derives from <b>the</b> tricorne <b>hat</b> worn by officers and gentlemen.

During their tenure, they involved Sweden in two expensive and disastrous wars, in the 1740s and 1750s.|$|R

Random House retained the rights to trade sales, which encompassed copies of the book sold at book stores, while Houghton Mifflin retained the education rights, which encompassed copies sold to schools.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th and 19th centuries, European nations used cockades, or {{knots of}} colored ribbons pinned to <b>the</b> <b>hat,</b> to denote the {{nationality}} of their military. In Poland, until 1831, {{there was no}} consensus {{as to what the}} colors of the national cockade should be. Polish soldiers wore white, white-and-red, blue-and-red or blue-white-red cockades.|$|E
5|$|The Cat in the Hats {{popularity}} {{also led}} to increased popularity and exposure for Geisel's previous children's books. For example, 1940's Horton Hatches the Egg had sold 5,801 copies in its opening year and 1,645 the following year. In 1958, {{the year after the}} publication of The Cat in <b>the</b> <b>Hat,</b> 27,643 copies of Horton were sold, and by 1960 the book had sold a total of over 200,000 copies.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>HAT</b> under Rajoelina's {{leadership}} affected highly visible, concrete {{activities that}} appealed to popular concerns. Rajoelina occasionally organized events to distribute basic items to groups of poor recipients, including medicines, clothing, house maintenance materials and school supplies. Rajoelina's administration also spent billions of ariary to subsidize basic needs like electricity, petrol, and food staples. Public works construction projects featured prominently among Rajoelina's activities. In 2010, two years after Rajoelina launched the project as mayor of Antananarivo, <b>the</b> <b>HAT</b> completed {{the reconstruction of the}} Hotel de Ville (town hall) of Antananarivo which had been destroyed by arson during the rotaka political protests of 1972. Also in 2010, Rajoelina oversaw the construction of a hospital built to international standards in Toamasina. Through its trano mora ("cheap house") initiative, <b>the</b> <b>HAT</b> built several subsidized housing developments intended for young middle class couples. Numerous other construction projects were planned or completed, including the restoration of historic staircases in Antananarivo built in the 19th century during the reign of Queen Ranavalona I, renovation of Toamasina's two main markets and its principal boulevard, repaving of the heavily traveled road between Toamasina and Foulpointe, and the construction of a 15,000-capacity municipal stadium and new town hall in Toamasina.|$|E
5|$|The {{depiction}} of the galero in arms can vary greatly depending on the artist's style. The top of <b>the</b> <b>hat</b> may be shown flat or round. Sometimes the brim is shown much narrower; with a domed top it can look like a cappello romano with tassels, but in heraldry it is still called a galero. The tassels may be represented as knotted cords.|$|E

Then they hear a loud bump which is quickly {{followed}} {{by the arrival of}} the Cat in <b>the</b> <b>Hat,</b> a tall anthropomorphic cat in a red and white striped hat and a red bow tie. The Cat proposes to entertain the children with some tricks that he knows. The children's pet fish refuses, insisting that the Cat leave. The Cat responds by balancing the fish on the tip of his umbrella. The game quickly becomes more complicated, as the Cat balances himself on a ball and tries to balance lots of household items on his limbs until he falls on his head, dropping everything he was holding. The fish admonishes him again, but the Cat in <b>the</b> <b>Hat</b> just proposes another game.|$|E

25|$|During the 1840s, <b>the</b> felt <b>hat</b> {{industry}} {{went into}} depression; the recession affected Denton, with wages {{in the area}} falling by 35% and only 12 hat manufacturers remaining in Denton. The depression was partially due to changes in fashion away from felt towards silk <b>hats.</b> <b>The</b> revitalisation of <b>the</b> felt <b>hat</b> industry came in the 1850s, once again on a whim of fashion but also {{the increased use of}} machinery led to reduced production costs. The resurgence was demonstrated by the doubling of <b>the</b> number of <b>hat</b> manufacturers in <b>the</b> town between 1861 and 1872. At its peak in the Edwardian period, Denton's felt <b>hat</b> industry was <b>the</b> largest felt <b>hat</b> manufacturing centre in Britain. There were 36 firms directly involved in <b>the</b> felt <b>hat</b> making industry. In 1907 the majority of <b>the</b> 16,428,000 felt <b>hats</b> made in England (worth £2,068,000) were made in Denton and Stockport. In 1921, the working population of Denton was 9,653 with about 41% of those people in occupations related to <b>the</b> <b>hatting</b> industry. <b>The</b> last <b>hat</b> factory in Denton closed in 1980.|$|R

5|$|Environmental {{conditions}} on the island also worsened under Rajoelina. The illegal exportation of endangered rosewood from protected national forests abruptly increased under <b>the</b> <b>HAT,</b> with several business leaders and politicians linked to <b>the</b> <b>HAT</b> having been implicated in trafficking the valuable wood to China; NGOs and the US government accused the Rajoelina administration of selling the wood to supplement the national budget and finance its public works projects. A large, unexplained stash of rosewood logs was discovered at the presidential palace {{after the end of}} Rajoelina's term in office. Due to accelerating deforestation and a spike in bush meat consumption linked with deepening poverty, the island's lemurs moved closer toward extinction under Rajoelina's tenure. A July 2012 assessment found that 90percent of lemur species were found to be threatened with extinction, an increase from 38 percent in 2008. Lack of funds for pesticides and systematic spraying resulted in the March 2013 outbreak of a locust infestation that was anticipated to persist for five to ten years and require $41 million U.S. dollars to bring under control, deepening the risk of nationwide famine and destruction of habitat for endangered species.|$|E
5|$|For Super Street Fighter IV, a third outfit {{intended}} {{to resemble the}} Chinese jiangshi was included, consisting of a long Chinese robe, black hat with his ponytail extruding from the top, yellow and black striped pants, and a yellow strip of paper meant to represent a sealing charm extending {{from the front of}} <b>the</b> <b>hat</b> and over his face. The developers considered to have the charm able to be knocked off by an opponent's attacks, and as a result alter his attack patterns and power; however, they felt this overcomplicated the character, and instead abandoned the idea. Assistant producer Natsuki Shiozawa cited the outfit as one of her five favorites in the game, feeling that design suited his body well.|$|E
