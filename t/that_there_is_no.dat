5|$|Where {{there is}} still a corneal reflex or {{spontaneous}} motor response to painful stimulus but all other criteria are satisfied, or where any of the criteria cannot be performed but the remaining criteria are satisfied, the irreversible cessation of all brain functions can be determined by a combination of the criteria that have been satisfied and the performance of a supplementary test. These tests are cerebral angiography to confirm <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> intracranial blood flow, and a radionuclide scan to confirm <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> intracranial perfusion.|$|E
