5|$|During {{the earlier}} seasons of the show, Maggie's {{equivalent}} of a hallmark was to trip over her clothing and fall on her face while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk,</b> causing a loud thud on the floor, but this was toned down in the later seasons. She has penchant for her pacifier, on which she is always seen sucking.|$|E
5|$|During {{the bridge}} sequence, Minogue and Fletcher park {{in front of}} a shop, and Minogue seductively tries to {{distract}} the cashier outside by staring and posing at him, while Fletcher tries to steal money from the till. In the last scenes, Minogue is in another outfit <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> out of an alley with a bag of money, but sees a police car driving towards her and tries to walk off. Fletcher is caught by police and is escorted into the police car while yelling at Minogue.

5|$|Starting {{out in a}} {{black and}} white frame (and later {{incorporating}} scenes of color), a group of girls are seen standing outside on the street while Bieber is seen exiting a building while <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> away without getting noticed. This however, is unsuccessful as the girls run up to Bieber; he then takes pictures and signs autographs with the girls. While this is happening Bieber takes an interest with one particular girl asking her to meet him later on, to which she agrees. As the song starts playing Bieber is seen sitting in an empty auditorium playing the piano and singing. When Bieber's date shows up they sneak into an empty theater where they are seen; holding hands, horsing around on the theater's seats, and sliding down banisters. At the ending of the video they are seen engaging in a playful back-alley water fight and eventually collapse into each other's arms while Bieber is playing the piano back inside the theater.|$|E

25|$|Investigations {{concluded}} the first-time (all new) crew failed to realize they had overflown their {{air base in}} a sandstorm. After continuing to fly south into the desert for many hours, the crew bailed out when the plane's fuel ran out. The survivors then died in the desert <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> to safety. All {{but one of the}} crew's remains were recovered between February and August 1960. The wreckage of the Lady Be Good was taken to a Libyan Air Force base after being removed from the crash site in August 1994.|$|E

25|$|Symptoms of {{cerebellar}} abiotrophy include ataxia {{or lack of}} balance, {{an awkward}} wide-legged stance, a head tremor (intention tremor) (in dogs, body tremors also occur), hyperreactivity, lack of menace reflex, stiff or high-stepping gait, coarse or jerky head bob when in motion (or in very young animals, when attempting to nurse), apparent lack of awareness of where the feet are (sometimes standing or <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> with a foot knuckled over), poor depth perception, and a general inability to determine space and distance. The symptoms, when taken as a group, are distinctive and not easily mimicked by other illnesses, though certain types of neurological injury and infection need to be ruled out. Verifying the diagnosis in a laboratory setting is possible only by examining the brain post-mortem {{to determine if there}} has been a loss of Purkinje cells.|$|E
500|$|The play {{opens with}} Marjorie Taylor in bed, in 1905. [...] Wife of small town doctor Joseph Taylor, {{she has just}} had a son. [...] The people of the town predict great things for Joseph Taylor, Jr., or Joe as he will {{come to be called}} (Musical number: [...] "Joseph Taylor, Jr."). [...] Joe learns what a baby learns: the comforting {{presence}} of his mother, the presence of another figure, who does not smell as nice, and who always leaves as soon as he picks up his black bag. [...] Joe is seen as a baby and then not again as a child; the audience takes his perspective. [...] Joe's Grandma notices him <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk,</b> calls for Marjorie to witness the first steps, and once he takes them, as the chorus states, [...] "the world belongs to Joe" [...] ("One Foot, Other Foot"). [...] Joe grows to school age, and loses his beloved Grandma. [...] He is comforted by Jennie Brinker, a businessman's daughter. [...] The two grow to high school age and date, though Joe lacks the nerve to kiss her, to Jennie's frustration. [...] As Joe prepares to leave for college, Dr. Taylor hopes that his son will help him in his medical practice, and he and Marjorie wonder if Joe will marry Jennie ("A Fellow Needs a Girl").|$|E
2500|$|Affected horses {{display a}} [...] "tiptoe" [...] gait - <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> on the toes due to heel pain. They may stumble frequently. The {{lameness}} may switch from one leg to another, {{and may not}} be consistent. Lameness usually occurs in both front feet, although one foot may be more sore than the other.|$|E

2500|$|... "Clown Stops" [...] or [...] "interludes" [...] are {{the brief}} {{appearances}} of clowns in a circus while the props and rigging are changed. These are typically {{made up of}} a few gags or several bits. Clown stops will always have a beginning, a middle, and an end to them, invariably culminating in a blow-off. These are also called [...] "reprises" [...] or [...] "run-ins" [...] by many, and in today's circus they are an art form in themselves. Originally they were bits of [...] "business" [...] usually parodying the act that had preceded it. If for instance there had been a tightrope walker the reprise would involve two chairs with a piece of rope between and the clown trying to imitate the artiste by <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> between them, with the resulting falls and cascades bringing laughter from the audience. Today, interludes are far more complex, and in many modern shows the clowning is a thread that links the whole show together.|$|E
2500|$|The trope {{of masculinity}} {{continued}} in season two. Vox's Todd VanDerWerff stated, [...] "...above all else, True Detective wants {{to explore the}} role of men in society." [...] "Yet if season one was already interested in the topic, then season two has nearly jumped off the cliff with its obsessions, {{to the degree that}} Rachel McAdams's Ani is defined largely by her rejection of the more open and traditionally [...] "feminine" [...] New Age philosophy of her father and her embrace of the hardened, traditionally [...] "masculine" [...] life of the emotionally closed-off police officer," [...] he continued. VanDerWerff also noted that season two's three male leads are all dealing with their own issues of masculinity; [...] "Ray seems tortured by having to exist as a man in this world that doesn't share his ideals," [...] "Frank is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> a very noble, masculine path by taking his dark, dirty enterprise legitimate," [...] and [...] " [...] is mostly playing out a very typical story of a deeply repressed gay man who's trying to fight back his own impulses." ...|$|E
2500|$|It {{must have}} been late 1941 or early 1942. Jews were {{required}} to wear the Star of David and to obey a 6p.m. curfew. I had gone {{to play with a}} Christian friend and had stayed too late. I turned my brown sweater inside out to walk the few blocks home. As I was walking down an empty street, I saw a German soldier approaching. He was wearing the black uniform that I had been told to fear more than others â€“ the one worn by specially recruited SS soldiers. As I came closer to him, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> fast, I noticed that he was looking at me intently. Then he beckoned me over, picked me up, and hugged me. I was terrified that he would notice the star inside my sweater. He was speaking to me with great emotion, in German. When he put me down, he opened his wallet, showed me a picture of a boy, and gave me some money. I went home more certain than ever that my mother was right: people were endlessly complicated and interesting. (Kahneman, 2003, p. 417) ...|$|E
