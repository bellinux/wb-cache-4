Grass started to expand in the Miocene, and the Miocene is where many modern- day mammals first appeared. Giant ungulates like Paraceratherium and Deinotherium evolved to rule the grasslands. The {{evolution of}} grass also brought primates down from the trees, and started human evolution. The first big cats evolved during this time as well. The Tethys Sea was closed off by the collision of Africa and Europe.|$|E

It was mastered by Vlado Meller at Masterdisk in New York City. Malay {{said that he and}} Ocean focused on sonic [...] "intricacies" [...] such as interludes and skits on tracks when mixing the album, which he referred to as their [...] "art project". Ocean said that he admires [...] "the anonymity that directors can have about their films" [...] and explained his use of interludes on the album, saying that [...] "the work is the work. The work is not me ... Even though it's my voice, I'm a storyteller."

Malay recalled in an interview for Complex how he and Ocean were [...] "somewhat oblivious to how quickly everything happened" [...] as they were finishing the album, as Ocean's name was [...] "continuing <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>bigger</b> and bigger." [...] To downplay himself from being [...] "the focal point" [...] of the album, Ocean did not want his name on the cover and had Everest, his Bernese Mountain Dog, credited as the executive producer instead.|$|E

60|$|I puzzled out at {{last that}} my best chance {{would be to}} drop back towards the moon as near as I dared in order to gather velocity, then to shut my windows, and fly behind it, and when I was past to open my earthward windows, and so get off at a good pace homeward. But whether I should ever reach the earth by that device, or whether I might not simply find myself {{spinning}} about it in some hyperbolic or parabolic curve or other, I could not tell. Later I had a happy inspiration, and by opening certain windows to the moon, which {{had appeared in the}} sky in front of the earth, I turned my course aside so as to head off the earth, which it had become evident to me I must pass behind without some such expedient. I did a very great deal of complicated thinking over these problems--for I am no mathematician--and in the end I am certain it was much more my good luck than my reasoning that enabled me to hit the earth. Had I known then, as I know now, the mathematical chances there were against me, I doubt if I should have troubled even to touch the studs to make any attempt. And having puzzled out what I considered to be the thing to do, I opened all my moonward windows, and squatted down--the effort lifted me for a time some feet or so into the air, and I hung there in the oddest way--and waited for the crescent <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>bigger</b> and bigger until I felt I was near enough for safety. Then I would shut the windows, fly past the moon with the velocity I had got from it--if I did not smash upon it--and so go on towards the earth.|$|E
