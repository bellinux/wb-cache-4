While still severely constrained by lack of funding, the Ministry of Labor budgeted approximately $60,000 to its Labor Administration and Inspection Services for child labor inspections.

The government generally encourages victims’ assistance in the investigation and prosecution of their traffickers, but the lack of national procedures for victim protection likely led to the deportation of most foreign victims before they were identified or able to give evidence in court. Foreign victims are not offered legal alternatives to their removal to countries in which they would face hardship or retribution. In a few cases, the lack of adequate shelter facilities forced Tanzanian officials to house potential trafficking victims in prisons.|$|E

[...] "Guest Users" [...] - any viewers not logged in - can see 24, a logged-in user can see up to 48, and the senior administrators ("gods," [...] though this term has fallen out of favour in recent years) can see up to 64.

Whenever a logged-in user moves from one node to another, be it through a hard link, another soft link, or through the title search box, the system creates (or strengthens) the bidirectional soft link between the two; however, some nodes - namely the special pages and the user profiles - will not display the soft links so created.

5000|$|Text {{messaging}} {{has been}} a subject of interest for police forces around the world. One of the issues of concern to law enforcement agencies {{is the use of}} encrypted text messages. In 2003, a British company developed a program called Fortress SMS which used 128 bit AES encryption to protect SMS messages. Police have also retrieved deleted text messages to aid them in solving crimes. For example, Swedish police retrieved deleted texts from a cult member who claimed she committed a double murder based on forwarded texts she received. Police in Tilburg, Netherlands, started an SMS alert program, in which they would send a message to ask citizens to be vigilant when a burglar was on the loose or a child was missing in their neighborhood. Several thieves have been caught and children have been found using the SMS Alerts. The service has been expanding to other cities. A Malaysian-Australian company has released a multi-layer SMS security program. Boston police are now turning to text messaging to help stop crime.

40|$|Given {{the lack}} of modern {{techniques}} to ensure the digital privacy of individuals, we want {{to pave the way}} for a new approach <b>to</b> <b>make</b> pedestrians in cityscape images anonymous. To address these concerns, we propose an automated method to replace any unknown pedestrian with another one which is extracted from a controlled and authorized dataset. The techniques used up <b>to</b> now <b>to</b> <b>make</b> people <b>anonymous</b> are based mainly on the blurring of people’s faces, but even so it is pos-sible to trace the identity of the subject starting from his clothing, personal items, hairstyle, the place and time where the photo was taken. The proposed method aims <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the pedestrians completely anonymous, and consists of four phases: firstly we identify the area where the pedestrian is located, we separate the pedes-trian from the background, we select the most similar pedestrian from a controlled dataset and subsequently we substitute it. Our case study is Google Street View because it is one of the online services which suffers most from this kind of privacy issues. The experimen-tal results show how this technique can overcome the problems of digital privacy with promising results. 1...|$|R
40|$|Due {{to growing}} traffic density on road systems new methods {{have to be}} {{developed}} to generate up-to-date traffic and safety information. The floating car data (FCD) concept is a promissing approach to generate and collect traffic related data. Data collection has a somewhat negative connotation, therefore, mechanisms <b>to</b> <b>make</b> data <b>anonymous</b> have <b>to</b> be used. In this paper we’ll present {{a new approach to}} depersonalize FCD information using a ticket-based identification solution. The whole system is relying on a telematics platform defined in the EU-project Global System for Telematics (GST). Hence, the approach is likely to be compatible to future telematics system realizations. The ticket-based identification solution enables the identification of viable data and the mapping of data to a certain account while still preserving the anonymity of the user. This new approach has primarily been designed for FCD systems, however, it can also be used in other contexts using a similar underlying system setup. 1...|$|R

SurePath aims <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>anonymous</b> tunnels fault-tolerant to node failures.

40|$|The paper explores a {{behavioral}} paradox which occurs in everyday life: people try <b>to</b> <b>make</b> themselves different and {{stand out from}} others, but they also try to minimize their differences and be just like everyone else. The major {{hypothesis of the study}} states that people will work to individuate themselves when a positive event is forthcoming in the envronment, but will work to deindividuate themselves {{in the face of an}} impending negative event. A second hypothesis, in which individuation is both the independent and the dependent variable, states that people who are already in a deindividuated state should have to work harder <b>to</b> <b>make</b> themselves stand out than people who already feel individuated, but should have tc work less hard <b>to</b> <b>make</b> themselves <b>anonymous.</b> In contrast, people who are in an individual state should show the reverse pattern. The study also explores the hypothesis that males and females would use different techniques to call attention to themselves, as a result of previously learned sex roles. Subjects for the experiments were 80 university undergraduates; results are analyzed statistically while the ensuing discussion examines the outcomes of the study as they underscore the complexity of the individuation process.

The value of the hash function is also used as a hash address for the tags in the database. The purpose of the random numbers is <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the response <b>anonymous.</b> This protocol protects the privacy and security of RFID systems of the issues outlined above.|$|R

40|$|One hurdle {{to using}} {{peer-to-peer}} networks as anonymizing networks is churn. Node churn makes anonymous paths fragile and short-lived: failures of a relay node disrupt the path, resulting in message loss and communication failures. <b>To</b> <b>make</b> <b>anonymous</b> routing resilient to node failures, we take two steps: (1) {{we use a}} simple yet powerful idea based on message redundancy by erasure coding and path redundancy to mask node failures; (2) we base mix choices of a path on node lifetime prediction and choose stable nodes as relay nodes, thereby prolonging single path durability. We present an allocation of erasure-coded message segments among multiple paths that provides a guideline on how to maximize routing resilience upon different node availabilities in real-world systems. Via detailed simulations, we compare routing resilience of our approach and existing anonymity protocols, showing that our approach greatly improves routing resilience while consuming modest bandwidth. 1...|$|E

30|$|Anonymous job {{applications}} {{appear as}} an attractive policy instrument to combat hiring discrimination. Nevertheless, {{they are very}} controversially discussed in the public debate. Our paper backs this discussion by reconsidering the available empirical evidence from field experiments testing anonymous job applications in Europe. Against this background, we discuss the potentials and limits of this approach. We particularly focus on novel evidence from an experiment organized by the German Federal Anti-Discrimination Agency. Results show that anonymous job applications can be practically implemented, but they also show that the method of implementation is crucial. Standardized application forms which are completed by the applicants appear as {{the most effective and}} efficient way <b>to</b> <b>make</b> applications <b>anonymous.</b> Results show moreover that with anonymous job applications, all applicant groups have the expected equal chances to receive an interview invitation in nearly all recruitment processes. When analyzing the effects of introducing anonymous job applications, we find that anonymous hiring can reduce discrimination—if discrimination is present beforehand. Anonymous hiring can also have no effects if no discrimination exists initially, and it can even prevent the employer from applying measures such as affirmative action, at least in the first stage of the hiring process.|$|R
