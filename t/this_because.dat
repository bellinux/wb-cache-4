He did <b>this</b> <b>because</b> the Institute was free of debt and, due to its status as an educational organization, was tax-exempt.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the medieval}} chronicler Geoffrey Gaimar, after the Battle of Stamford Bridge Harold {{entrusted}} the loot gained from Harold Hardrada to Ealdred. Gaimar asserts that King Harold did <b>this</b> <b>because</b> {{he had heard}} of Duke William's landing in England, and needed to rush south to counter it. After the Battle of Hastings, Ealdred joined the group who tried to elevate Edgar the Ætheling, Edward the Exile's son, as king, but eventually he submitted to William the Conqueror at Berkhamsted. John of Worcester says that the group supporting Edgar vacillated {{over what to do}} while William ravaged the countryside, which led to Ealdred and Edgar's submission to William.|$|E

5|$|After filming was complete, test {{screenings}} were held, and {{the production}} team became aware of {{a problem with the}} ending. In the original ending, Ru'afo is ejected into space from the Son'a collector ship and de-ages rapidly as he floats amongst the rings of the planet Ba'ku. The revised ending saw the Enterprise swoop in at the last minute to save Picard and destroy the collector ship with Ru'afo aboard. The studio liked the new ending but wanted a bigger space battle. The production team agreed providing they could postpone the release to allow enough time for <b>this.</b> <b>Because</b> the studio wanted Insurrection to be released in time for Christmas, no further revisions were made to the ending.|$|E
5|$|After {{replacing}} drummer Niklas Lundgren with Tomas Haake in 1990, Meshuggah {{signed a}} contract with German heavy metal record label Nuclear Blast and recorded its debut full-length album, Contradictions Collapse. The LP, originally entitled (All <b>this</b> <b>because</b> of) Greed, was released in 1991. The album received positive reviews, but was not a commercial success. Soon after, Kidman decided to concentrate on vocals, and rhythm guitarist Mårten Hagström, who had already played in a band with Haake when they were in sixth grade, was recruited. The new lineup recorded the EP None at Tonteknik Recordings in Umeå in 1994 for release later that year. A Japanese version was also released, including lyrics printed in Japanese.|$|E
5|$|Alex convinces Principal Skinner {{to have a}} school-dance {{rather than}} the regular yearly event of apple picking. Skinner agrees, so Alex and Lisa, {{accompanied}} by Sherri, Terri, Janey and Allison visit the mall to purchase party supplies, but the girls detour and begin trying on outfits for the dance, despite Lisa's protests. The group leave the mall, none speaking to each other. Lisa decides not to attend the dance, but changes her mind {{and goes to the}} school to take tickets at the door, but later arrives and discovers the boys and girls are standing on different sides of the room, and explains to Alex that it is like <b>this</b> <b>because</b> they are only children, not adults.|$|E

5|$|Beauchamp {{probably}} {{held the}} office of royal forester for Worcestershire as well as sheriff. The evidence {{for this is that}} after Beauchamp's death, his son William was granted the revenues from the royal forests of Worcestershire {{at the same rate as}} his father had held them; this strongly implies that the elder held {{the office of}} forester. The historian Judith Green felt that Walter de Beauchamp might possibly have held the office of constable, which had been held by his father-in-law, although the historian C. Warren Hollister felt that Beauchamp definitely did hold the office. He also a held the royal office of dispenser, an office which later became known as a butler. He acquired <b>this</b> <b>because</b> his wife inherited the office from her father. The date when he acquired the office is unknown. While a member of the royal household, Beauchamp witnessed a number of royal charters, mainly when the king was in England.|$|E
5|$|Cienfuegos led electors {{that were}} part of the {{imperial}} party in an attempt to elect Giulio Piazza. Piazza was almost elected on May 13, but was short by four votes. The electors were confident that {{they would be able to}} elect him, because more cardinals were arriving to participate in the conclave, and it became public in Rome that Piazza was likely to be the new pope. Albani did not support <b>this</b> <b>because</b> he had not been a part of the negotiations despite being the original elector to suggest Piazza, and undermined his election by proposing Vincenzo Orsini as an alternate candidate.|$|E
5|$|Diageo {{maintained}} {{ownership of}} BK until 2000 when Diageo {{decided to focus}} solely on their beverage products and divest itself of the chain. In 2001, the company put forth a plan to float approximately 20 percent of BKC on the NYSE. Burger King's franchises representation group, The National Franchise Association (NFA), sought to block <b>this</b> <b>because</b> it believed that any money raised from the issue would not be put into helping bolster the then flagging BK, but would instead end up being used to help Diageo bolster its liquor brands.|$|E

5|$|Fincher {{realized}} that {{his job was to}} dispel the mythic stature the case had taken on over the years by clearly defining what was fact and what was fiction. He told Vanderbilt that he wanted the screenplay re-written but with additional research done from the original police reports. Fincher found {{that there was a lot}} of speculation and hearsay and wanted to interview people directly involved in the case in person to see if he believed what they were telling him. Fincher did <b>this</b> <b>because</b> he felt a burden of responsibility in making a film that convicted someone posthumously.|$|E
5|$|He was bailed {{from the}} police station on 13 September, after which he went on holiday to Saint-Tropez. Before leaving England, he {{returned}} to the farmhouse, gaining entry by the downstairs bathroom window. He said he did <b>this</b> <b>because</b> he had left his keys in London and needed some papers from the house for the trip to France; he entered through the window rather than borrow keys from the farm's housekeeper who lived nearby. When he returned to England on 29 September, he was re-arrested and charged with the murders.|$|E
5|$|In August 937, Olaf {{crossed the}} Irish Sea with his army {{to join forces}} with Constantine and Owen and in Livingston's opinion this {{suggests}} that the battle of Brunanburh occurred in early October of that year. According to Paul Cavill, the invading armies raided Mercia, from which Æthelstan obtained Saxon troops as he travelled north to meet them. Michael Wood wrote that no source mentions any intrusion into Mercia. John of Worcester wrote that the invaders entered via the Humber but no other chronicler mentioned <b>this.</b> <b>Because</b> of the lack of sources supporting the claim, along with other issues, philologist Paul Cavill argues John's statement is not true. According to Symeon of Durham, Olaf had 615 ships but this number is likely exaggerated.|$|E

5|$|Many {{of these}} species have adaptations to help in under-water locomotion. Water beetles and water bugs have legs adapted into paddle-like structures. Dragonfly naiads use jet propulsion, {{forcibly}} expelling water out of their rectal chamber. Some species like the water striders are capable of walking {{on the surface of}} water. They can do <b>this</b> <b>because</b> their claws are not at the tips of the legs as in most insects, but recessed in a special groove further up the leg; this prevents the claws from piercing the water's surface film. Other insects such as the Rove beetle Stenus are known to emit pygidial gland secretions that reduce surface tension making it possible for them to move on the surface of water by Marangoni propulsion (also known by the German term Entspannungsschwimmen).|$|E
5|$|One {{result of}} Wallace's early travels {{is a modern}} {{controversy}} about his nationality. Since Wallace was born in Monmouthshire, some sources have considered him to be Welsh. However, some historians have questioned <b>this</b> <b>because</b> neither of his parents was Welsh, his family only briefly lived in Monmouthshire, the Welsh people Wallace knew in his childhood considered him to be English, and because Wallace himself consistently referred to himself as English rather than Welsh (even when writing about his time in Wales). One Wallace scholar has stated that the most reasonable interpretation is therefore {{that he was an}} Englishman born in Wales.|$|E
5|$|Patrick Stewart {{sought a}} {{change to the}} script to have the crew defend the Ba'ku village {{in the manner of}} the Battle of the Alamo instead of fleeing into the mountains. Piller could not find a {{feasible}} way to include this in the script, and the budget ruled out the creation of Alamo-like structures in the mountains. Several titles were considered for the film as shooting approached. Star Trek: Where Time Stands Still, Star Trek: Forever and Star Trek: Beyond Paradise were all considered but were rejected. Piller's favorite was Star Trek: Sacred Honor, but the studio rejected <b>this</b> <b>because</b> they were concerned that it sounded too religious. When shooting began, the film was still called Star Trek IX.|$|E

5|$|The Nazi {{reproductive}} {{policies were}} {{a significant factor}} behind their anti-tobacco campaign. Women who smoked {{were considered to be}} vulnerable to premature aging and loss of physical attractiveness; they were viewed as unsuitable to be wives and mothers in a German family. Werner Huttig of the Nazi Party's Rassenpolitisches Amt (Office of Racial Politics) said that a smoking mother's breast milk contained nicotine, a claim that modern research has proven correct. , a prominent physician during the Third Reich, opined that smoking by pregnant women resulted in a higher rate of stillbirths and miscarriages. This opinion was also supported by well-known female racial hygienist Agnes Bluhm, whose book published in 1936 expressed the same view. The Nazi leadership was concerned over <b>this</b> <b>because</b> they wanted German women to be as reproductive as possible. An article published in a German gynecology journal in 1943 stated that women smoking three or more cigarettes per day were more likely to remain childless compared to nonsmoking women.|$|E
5|$|The {{explosive}} lenses {{required by}} the Fat Man had to be fabricated. A small explosive plant was established at Los Alamos known as Site S, {{as it was a}} former sawmill.

On Parsons' recommendation, Groves decided to establish a pilot plant at NOTS, because Caltech had experience in building and operating pilot ordnance plants.
