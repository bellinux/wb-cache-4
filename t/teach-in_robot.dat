40|$|Today’s {{developments}} in industrial robots focus on aims like gain of flexibility, {{improvement of the}} interaction between robots and reduction of down-times. A very important method to achieve these goals are off-line programming techniques. In contrast to conventional <b>teach-in</b> <b>robot</b> programming techniques, where sequences of actions are defined step-by-step via remote control on the real object, off-line programming techniques design complete robot (inter-) action programs in a CAD/CAM environment. This poses high requirements to the geometric accuracy of a robot. While the repeatability of robot poses in the teach-in mode is often better than 0. 1 mm, the absolute pose accuracy potential of industrial robots is usually much worse due to tolerances, eccentricities, elasticities, play, wear-out, load, temperature and insufficient knowledge of model parameters for the transformation from poses into robot axis angles. This fact necessitates robot calibration techniques, including the formulation of a robot model describing kinematics and dynamics of the robot, and a measurement technique to provide reference data. Digital photogrammetry as an accurate, economic technique with realtime potential offers itself for this purpose. The paper analyzes the requirements posed to a measurement technique by industrial robot calibration tasks. After an overview on measurement techniques used for robot calibration purposes in the past, a photogrammetric robot calibration system based on off-the-shelf lowcost hardware components will be shown and results of pilot studie...|$|E

In this paper we give- some experiences from more than 5000 installations, in industry, in mines, harbours etc- outline the AutoSurveyor that automatically gives {{a map of the}} reflectors, SLAM. - mention <b>Teach-In</b> where the <b>robot,</b> by a manual operation, learns the trajectory from, say, a loading station to the “navigation highway”. Among needs for the future we mention- The need for sensing obstacles. This also includes objects hanging down from the ceiling!- Sensing and navigation in cases where retroreflective tapes can not be used. - Outdoor sensing that is robust booth to snow flakes, hoarfrost, rain and bright sunshine. It is very essential that the vehicle / robot have reliable and predictable properties. This is both a question of safety and economy. The paper outlines some properties and discuss the future...|$|R
40|$|Today's {{situation}} with increasingly shorter time-to-market limits and growing variant spectra calls for advanced methods {{in the manufacturing}} domain. A big potential for gaining faster and better manufacturing results lies {{in the application of}} offline programming, especially if processing small lot sizes. Offline programming offers as main advantage a notable reduction of deadlock times of manufacturing systems. Applying this technology there is no time consumptive <b>teach-in</b> on the <b>robots</b> necessary. A technology module based on CAD/CAM technique is described which permits to carry out offline path and process planning including simulation and visualization of the processing task. The technology module is designed as an interactive and flexible tool to support the user in the planning phase. Simulation is utilized to visualize the manufacturing process and to detect conflicting situations like collisions or forbidden welding positions. The welding track with all processing parameters is displayed on a graphical user screen. The user has the possibility to modify the processing parameters interactively. After finishing simulation the CNC code is generated by a post-processor and directly transferred to the machine control...|$|R
