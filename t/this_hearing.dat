5|$|In March 1993, the AFL and AFLPA {{appeared}} before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC). At <b>this</b> <b>hearing</b> {{it was determined that}} a dispute between the parties did exist and that the AIRC had jurisdiction to determine an Award. The AFL and AFLPA were instructed by the AIRC to attempt negotiations away from the AIRC environment. These negotiations led to the CBA of 1994-1995.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert had {{previously}} been investigated by Eugene at Paris in April 1147, but <b>this</b> <b>hearing</b> came to nothing for two reasons. One was that Gilbert's opponents were not unified in what they opposed in Gilbert's teachings. The second reason was {{that no one had}} a copy of the treatise on Boethius by Gilbert that was in dispute. Prior to the second hearing at Reims, Bernard of Clairvaux, who was opposed to Gilbert's teachings, held a private meeting with a number of the attendees, where Bernard attempted to pressure them to condemn Gilbert. This offended the various cardinals in attendance, who then proceeded to insist that they were the only persons who could judge the case.|$|E

5|$|One {{of the key}} {{elements}} in <b>this</b> <b>hearing</b> was Oppenheimer's earliest testimony about George Eltenton's approach to various Los Alamos scientists, a story that Oppenheimer confessed he had fabricated to protect his friend Haakon Chevalier. Unknown to Oppenheimer, both versions were recorded during his interrogations of a decade before. He was surprised {{on the witness stand}} with transcripts of these, which he had not been given a chance to review. In fact, Oppenheimer had never told Chevalier that he had finally named him, and the testimony had cost Chevalier his job. Both Chevalier and Eltenton confirmed mentioning that they had a way to get information to the Soviets, Eltenton admitting he said this to Chevalier and Chevalier admitting he mentioned it to Oppenheimer, but both put the matter in terms of gossip and denied any thought or suggestion of treason or thoughts of espionage, either in planning or in deed. Neither was ever convicted of any crime.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{returning}} from Flanders, the bishop was impeached in parliament, on 26 October 1383, {{in the presence of}} the king. The chancellor Michael de la Pole accused him of not mustering his troops at Calais, as had been agreed; not recruiting a high enough number of armed men; refusing to certify properly who his military leaders were; deceiving the king by not allowing a secular lord to command the expedition to Flanders; and disbanding his forces prematurely. Despenser denied all the charges, insisting that enough men had assembled at Ypres, that he had chosen his commanders well and that he had not refused to obey the king's orders. After de la Pole declared the bishop's replies to be insufficient, Despenser requested another hearing to defend himself still further, which was granted. In <b>this</b> <b>hearing</b> Despencer proceeded to blame his own commanders for forcing him to retreat from Ypres and then evacuate the garrisons. All his arguments were refuted and he was blamed for the failure of the expedition. His temporalities were confiscated and he was ordered to repay any costs taken from money gained from the French.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{their initial}} lack of popularity, {{by the late}} 1990s the Treasury's supply of Anthony dollars began to dwindle due to their {{widespread}} use in vending machines (including more than 9,000 stamp machines situated in post offices across the United States) and mass transit turnstiles. Beginning in 1997, several bills were introduced to Congress {{with the intent of}} resuming mintage of small-sized dollar coins to keep up with demand. On March 20 of that year, Arizona Republican Representative Jim Kolbe introduced legislation calling for more dollar coins to be minted. Four months later, on July 24, Republican Representative Michael Castle of Delaware, a member of the House Subcommittee on Domestic and International Monetary Policy, also introduced legislation, calling for the Statue of Liberty to be the subject of the design. On October 21, Minnesota Republican Rod Grams introduced a bill in the Senate, also calling for the mintage of a newly designed dollar coin. The final legislation authorizing the design and production of a new dollar coin was based on Grams' bill. Also on October 21, in a hearing before the House Financial Services Subcommittee on Domestic and International Monetary Policy, Trade, and Technology, Treasury Department officials gave their support for a new dollar coin, recommending that it be gold-colored with a distinctive edge, to make it easily distinguishable from the quarter-dollar. During <b>this</b> <b>hearing,</b> Philip N. Diehl, then Director of the Mint, estimated that it would take thirty months to begin production of the new coin.|$|E

25|$|Free agency saw the {{departure}} of two 2006 starters for the Patriots: tight end Daniel Graham signed with the Denver Broncos, and linebacker Tully Banta-Cain signed with the San Francisco 49ers, while running back Corey Dillon, the Patriots' leading rusher in 2006, asked to be released; the Patriots released him on March 2. Safety Tebucky Jones was also released early in the offseason. Another departure came when punter Todd Sauerbrun signed with the Denver Broncos. When Sauerbrun was signed by the Patriots in December 2006, he agreed to a right of first refusal, meaning that the Patriots could match any offer by any other team made in the subsequent offseason. When the unrestricted free agent signing period came, the Broncos tendered Sauerbrun, and the Patriots exercised their right and matched the offer. However, the Broncos argued that the Patriots had not filed the proper documents required for that right, and ordered a hearing before an NFL special master. The Broncos won <b>this</b> <b>hearing</b> and Sauerbrun was allowed to sign with the Broncos. After spending all of training camp with the team, veteran punter Josh Miller was released on August 16.|$|E
25|$|Reginald de Dunhers of Elnodestune would counter {{her claim}} to 33 acres in Elnodestune. On 22 June 1205 Cecilia Devereux put Simon Tirell {{in her place}} for this land plea.

In May 1206 Richard of Chandos, John Bankington, Geoffrey Ruff, and Jordan of Manington were sent to confirm that Reginald de Dunhers was truly too ill to attend the court proceedings. On 25 May 1206 they confirmed that he was incapacitated, and a new hearing granted for 26 June 1207 at the Tower of London. On 26 June 1206 the delay granted on 25 May 1206 due to Reginald’s illness was again confirmed, and the delay was extended indefinitely due {{to the absence of}} Reginald’s son, John de Dunhers, {{in the service of the}} king overseas. On 29 January 1207 Cecilia Devereux claimed in court that the 33 acres in Elnodestune were hers by hereditary right as they had been held by her grandfather, William Devereux, in the time of Henry, father of the king. Reginald denied her right making a grand assize of his own claiming a greater right to the land, and a day was granted on 6 May 1207 to hear the case. Reginald put his son, John of Dunhers, in his place for <b>this</b> <b>hearing.</b> On 7 October 1207 Reginald de Dunhers gave the king 1 mark for an agreement between him and Cecilia Devereux regarding the 33 acres in Elnodestune.
