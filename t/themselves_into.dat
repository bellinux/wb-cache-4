5|$|Deshasthas, {{like all}} other Hindu Brahmins, trace their {{paternal}} ancestors {{to one of the}} seven or eight sages, the saptarshi. They classify <b>themselves</b> <b>into</b> eight gotras, named after the ancestor rishi. Intra-marriage within gotras (Sagotra Vivaha) was uncommon until recently, being discouraged as it was likened to incest, although the taboo has considerably reduced in the case of modern Deshastha families who are bound by more practical considerations.|$|E
5|$|Emulsions are {{a type of}} colloid {{in which}} surface tension plays a role. Tiny {{fragments}} of oil suspended in pure water will spontaneously assemble <b>themselves</b> <b>into</b> much larger masses. But {{the presence of a}} surfactant provides a decrease in surface tension, which permits stability of minute droplets of oil in the bulk of water (or vice versa).|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1930s, Trotsky and his {{supporters}} believed that Stalin's influence over the Third International could still be fought from within and slowly rolled back. They organised <b>themselves</b> <b>into</b> the International Left Opposition in 1930, which {{was intended to be}} a group of anti-Stalinist dissenters within the Third International. Stalin's supporters, who dominated the International, would no longer tolerate dissent. All Trotskyists, and those suspected of being influenced by Trotskyism, were expelled.|$|E

5|$|Later work by Wolfram {{identifies}} the one-dimensional Rule 37R automaton as being particularly interesting in this respect. When {{run on a}} finite array of cells with periodic boundary conditions, starting from a small seed of random cells centered within a larger empty neighborhood, it tends to fluctuate between ordered and chaotic states. However, with the same initial conditions on an unbounded set of cells its configurations tend to organize <b>themselves</b> <b>into</b> several types of simple moving particles.|$|E
5|$|Like other pterosaurs, Pteranodon {{probably}} {{took off}} from a standing, quadrupedal position. Using their long forelimbs for leverage, they would have vaulted <b>themselves</b> <b>into</b> the air in a rapid leap. Almost all of the energy would have been generated by the forelimbs. The upstroke of the wings would have occurred when the animal cleared the ground followed by a rapid down-stroke to generate additional lift and complete the launch into the air.|$|E

Members {{of the families}} Ligiidae and Tylidae, commonly known as rock lice or sea slaters, are the least specialised of the woodlice for life on land. They inhabit the splash zone on rocky shores, jetties and pilings, may hide under debris washed up on the shore and can swim if immersed in water.|$|E

50|$|The {{refugees}} were largely aristocrats, {{no longer able}} to bear arms or command troops. They threw <b>themselves</b> instead <b>into</b> colonial trade, creating numerous trading companies, among them those leading in the Transatlantic slave trade.

In Ireland these refugees in France were known as Wild Geese by their detractors.|$|R

Mammals can communicate and vocalize {{in several different}} ways, including the production of ultrasound, scent-marking, alarm signals, singing, and echolocation.

5|$|According to Rose, {{the police}} let <b>themselves</b> <b>into</b> the house using Floyd's keys, without {{knocking}} or announcing themselves, while Cynthia {{and her family}} were watching television. The family said that an officer pushed Cynthia, causing her to fall. The officer denied this; the police said {{she had not been}} pushed but had simply collapsed. When it became clear she had stopped breathing, the same officer tried to revive her using mouth-to-mouth resuscitation, to no avail. The pathologist testified at the inquest that the fall may have been a precipitating factor; the jury returned a verdict of accidental death, following the coroner's direction that such a verdict would mean Cynthia had been pushed, but perhaps accidentally.|$|E

The outbreak of war on 3 September 1939 obliged him to postpone his plans for several months, while he strove to secure {{the future of the}} orchestra, whose financial guarantees had been withdrawn by its backers when war was declared. The original LPO company was liquidated and Beecham raised large sums of money for the orchestra, helping its members to form <b>themselves</b> <b>into</b> a self-governing body.|$|E

The outbreak of war on 3 September 1939 obliged him to postpone his plans for several months, striving instead to secure the future of the London Philharmonic, whose financial guarantees had been withdrawn by its backers when war was declared.

5|$|As the {{combined}} Texian force prepared for battle, they sent a messenger to instruct the alcalde {{of the city}} to surrender. At 11pm, the alcade responded that the town would remain neutral, neither surrendering nor fighting. Several of the locals did, however, supply axes to the Texian militia. The Texians divided <b>themselves</b> <b>into</b> four groups, each assigned a different approach to the presidio. In the pre-dawn hours of October 10, the Texians attacked. The lone sentinel managed to give the alarm but was immediately shot dead. The Texians quickly hacked through a door on the north wall of the fortress and ran to the interior courtyard. Hearing the commotion, the Mexican soldiers had lined the walls to defend the fort.|$|E
5|$|By {{the first}} decade of the 20th century, a number of {{business}} entities had formed <b>themselves</b> <b>into</b> trusts, which dominated their industries. Trusts often sought to purchase or otherwise neutralize their competitors, allowing the conglomerates to raise prices to high levels. In 1890, Congress had passed the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, but it was not until the Theodore Roosevelt administration (1901–09) that serious efforts were made to break up or control the trusts. The dominant force in the oil industry was Standard Oil, controlled by John D. Rockefeller. Modern-day Exxon, Mobil, Atlantic Richfield, Chevron, Sohio, Amoco and Continental Oil all trace their ancestry to various parts of Standard Oil.|$|E

5|$|Despite his fervour, Saglio's {{negotiations}} with the local people were unsuccessful. Niomoune and Carabane were the first two villages to attempt to apply this innovative approach, but both failed. The inhabitants were reluctant to participate, and the young inexperienced promoter had to abandon some of his ethnographic theories in favour of being careful to understand the daily realities of villages. The project was eventually abandoned, and the Catholic missions house was transformed by the nuns <b>themselves</b> <b>into</b> a modern, functional building. Despite the failure of Saglio's initiative in Carabane, agritourist camps were set up over the following decade in a dozen other nearby towns.|$|E

Aeron chooses to join her, and the two throw <b>themselves</b> <b>into</b> the Scar, using the chain to close it as they fall. The epilogue reveals that the land continued to be plagued by war, and that the Vestra passed down Aeron and Elena's tale as a legend.|$|E
5|$|Goss darted inside, but Hays {{slipped and}} fell {{before he could}} enter the blockhouse. As he fell, three musket balls lodged <b>themselves</b> <b>into</b> the wall {{where he had been}} {{standing}} moments before. While the attackers reloaded, Hays slipped inside and for about an hour an exchange of heavy gunfire erupted between the parties before the attackers withdrew. A fourth man, Upton, was out hunting nearby; when he was discovered by the attackers he was chased throughout the afternoon. Upton escaped the attackers injury-free. In fact, no person was killed or injured during the Plum River raid. The small raiding party escaped with three horses, but two horses were badly wounded by gunfire, and the other shot dead by the settlement's defenders.|$|E
