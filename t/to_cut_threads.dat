5000|$|Bottoming tap or plug tap: [...] The tap {{illustrated}} {{in the top of}} the image has a continuous cutting edge with almost no taper — between 1 and 1.5 threads of taper is typical. [...] This feature enables a bottoming tap <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>threads</b> to the bottom of a blind hole. A bottoming tap is usually used <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>threads</b> in a hole that has already been partially threaded using one of the more tapered types of tap; the tapered end ("tap chamfer") of a bottoming tap is too short to successfully start into an unthreaded hole. In the US, they are commonly known as bottoming taps, but in Australia and Britain they are also known as plug taps.|$|E

50|$|With soft or average {{hardness}} materials, such as plastic, aluminum or mild steel, {{the common}} practice {{is to use}} an intermediate (plug) tap to cut the threads. If the threads are to extend {{to the bottom of}} a blind hole, the intermediate (plug) tap will be used <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>threads</b> until the point of the tap reaches bottom, after which a bottoming tap will be used to finish the hole. Frequent ejection of the chips must be made in such an operation to avoid jamming and possibly breaking the tap. With hard materials, the machinist may start with a taper tap, whose less severe diameter transition reduces the amount of torque required to cut the threads. If threads are to be cut to the bottom of a blind hole, the taper tap will be followed by an intermediate (plug) tap and then a bottoming tap to finish the operation.|$|E

60|$|Mr. Quest, {{sitting in}} state as Clerk to the Magistrates {{assembled}} in Quarter Sessions at the Court House, Boisingham, little guessed that the sword at whose shadow he had trembled {{all these years}} was even now falling on his head.

25|$|There {{are many}} {{threading}} processes including: cutting threads with a tap or die, thread milling, single-point thread cutting, thread rolling, cold root rolling and forming, and thread grinding. A tap is used <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> a female <b>thread</b> {{on the inside}} surface of a pre-drilled hole, while a die <b>cuts</b> a male <b>thread</b> on a preformed cylindrical rod.|$|R
5000|$|Threads can be (and often are) {{truncated}} a bit more, yielding thread {{depths of}} 60 percent to 75 {{percent of the}} [...]65p value. For example, a 75 percent thread sacrifices {{only a small amount}} of strength in exchange for a significant reduction in the force required <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> the <b>thread.</b> The result is that tap and die wear is reduced, the likelihood of breakage is lessened and higher cutting speeds can often be employed.|$|R
50|$|Self-tapping screws {{are widely}} used for driving into sheet metal or {{plastics}} and forming their own thread. They may be either self-drilling, forming their own hole through unbroken material, or fitted into a pre-pierced hole. Self-drilling screws have some ability <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> a <b>thread,</b> as for a tap. Others work not by cutting, but rather by roll-forming the thread, pushing excess material {{out of the way}} by plastic deformation. This is one reason why ductile host materials, rather than brittle, are needed.|$|R
25|$|The {{greatest}} disadvantage is {{the difficulty}} in machining such a thread. The single-point cutting tools or taps and dies used <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> the <b>thread</b> cannot have efficient rake and relief angles (because of the square form), which makes the cutting slow and difficult. Square threads also cannot carry as much load as a trapezoidal thread, because {{the root of the}} square thread is smaller. Also, {{there is no way to}} compensate for wear on the nut, so it must be replaced when worn out.|$|R

Many designs require more than one color and may involve additional processing for appliqués, foam, or other special effects.

In addition, most designs have one or more jumps that need <b>to</b> be <b>cut.</b> Depending on the quality {{and size of the}} design, sewing a design file can require anywhere from a few minutes to over half a day! ...|$|R
5000|$|A common {{method of}} {{threading}} is cutting with taps and dies. Unlike drill bits, hand taps do not automatically remove the chips they create. A hand tap cannot <b>cut</b> its <b>threads</b> {{in a single}} rotation because it creates long chips which quickly jam the tap (an effect known as [...] "crowding"), possibly breaking it. Therefore, in manual thread cutting, normal wrench usage is <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> the <b>threads</b> 1/2 <b>to</b> 2/3 of a turn (180 to 240 degree rotation), then reverse the tap for about 1/6 of a turn (60 degrees) until the chips are broken by the back edges of the cutters.

50|$|In operation, {{there are}} usually four {{moveable}} chasers that <b>cut</b> the <b>thread</b> then {{back away from the}} work to permit rapid removal of the tool. The lower picture at the right shows four sets of chasers. Each set of chasers is designed <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> a different <b>thread.</b> One set of chasers would be used at a time, each chaser is inserted into the die head (in the correct order) and the die head is closed bringing the chasers down to their cutting position.

50|$|Early {{machine screws}} of metal, and early wood screws made of metal {{for use in}} wood, were made by hand, with files used <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> the <b>threads.</b> One method for making fairly {{accurate}} threads was to score a rod using an inclined knife with a wrap half way around the rod, the knife being precisely angled for the proper pitch. This {{was one of the}} methods Maudslay used to make his early leadscrews. This made the screw slow and expensive to make, and its quality highly dependent on the skill of the maker. A process for automating the manufacture of screws and improving the accuracy and consistency of the thread was needed.|$|R
5000|$|Important early {{machine tools}} {{included}} the slide rest lathe, screw-cutting lathe, turret lathe, milling machine, pattern tracing lathe, shaper, and metal planer, which {{were all in}} use before 1840. [...] With these machine tools the decades-old objective of producing interchangeable parts was finally realized. An important early example of something now taken for granted was the standardization of screw fasteners such as nuts and bolts. Before about {{the beginning of the}} 19th century, these were used in pairs, and even screws of the same machine were generally not interchangeable. [...] Methods were developed <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> screw <b>thread</b> <b>to</b> a greater precision than that of the feed screw in the lathe being used. This led to the bar length standards of the 19th and early 20th centuries.|$|R
50|$|The {{leadscrew}} will {{be manufactured}} to either imperial or metric standards and {{will require a}} conversion ratio to be introduced to create thread forms from a different family. To accurately convert from one thread form to the other requires a 127-tooth gear, or on lathes not large enough to mount one, an approximation may be used. Multiples of 3 and 7 giving a ratio of 63:1 can be used <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> fairly loose <b>threads.</b> This conversion ratio is often built into the quick change gearboxes.|$|R
50|$|Langlands and Fulton {{established}} their iron foundry in Flinders Streetwith in 1842 {{with only a}} small foot-lathe, but were still able to erect a steam engine for the first flour mill in Melbourne. They produced rack woolpresses for squatters with Fulton having <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> screws <b>threads</b> by hand because their lathe was too small. Fulton developed a technique for boiling down sheep for tallow around in 1843-44 when squatters slaughtered their otherwise worthless sheep in the thousands due to a rural depression. Fulton was located at 131 Flinders St West in about 1844 and entered partnership with George Annand and Robert Smith at 129 Flinders St West, between 1846-55, employing 150 men in 1858. The gold rush proved a boon and the firm increased output of plumbing and smithy work and dray wheels. They were also milling flour and operating as a licensed insurance agent and merchant.|$|R

5000|$|The {{painting}} is a reinterpretation of the mythological {{subject of the}} goddesses of destiny—the Moirai or fates as recounted in Homer, Hesiod, Virgil and other classical writers. These [...] "Daughters of Night" [...] were headed by Atropos, the inexorable goddess of death, who carries a few scissors <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> the <b>thread</b> of life; Clotho, with her distaff (which Goya replaces with a doll or newborn child, possibly an allegory of life), and Lachesis, the spinning one, which in this representation looks across a lens or in a mirror and symbolizes time, since {{she was the one}} who measured the length of the fiber. To the three female figures suspended in the air a fourth figure is added in the foreground. Possibly male, this figure's hands are bound behind him as if is captive. If this interpretation is true, the fates would be deciding the destiny of the man whose bound hands cannot be opposed to his fate. It has been speculated that he may represent Prometheus, who was bound on a mountain and left to be savaged by an eagle as punishment for stealing fire from Mount Olympus. All four are hideously ugly.|$|R
