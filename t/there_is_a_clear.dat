5|$|A {{sense of}} destiny {{is present in}} the novel through {{patterns}} of repetition, including reversals of destiny in a number of characters. Characters who are paired together tend to suffer the same destiny: Ti Noel and Monsieur Lenormand de Mezy both witness the marvels of the age and slowly decline; both Pauline and Solimán indulge in their wealthy positions and then sink into madness. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> pattern of succession from fortune to misfortune.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{maturity}} {{is reached}} {{between the ages}} of 18 and 24 months in females, and can be reached by 17 months in males. It is polyestrous, having many periods of sexual receptivity during a year. In captivity however, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> birth peak between March and May. It has been observed that reproductive patterns of captive prosimians in the northern hemisphere are altered. The estrus cycle lasts 29–45 days, with most copulations occurring on the same day.|$|E
5|$|Some lessons {{identified}} in the series include diversity, acceptance, political tolerance, and equality. Surveys of over 1,000 college students in the United States show that those who read the books were significantly different {{than those who had}} not. Readers of the series were found to be more tolerant, more opposed to violence and torture, less authoritarian, and less cynical. Although it is not known if this is a cause-and-effect relationship, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> correlation, and it seems that Harry Potter's cultural impact may be stronger than just a fandom bond.|$|E

5|$|The skull {{is similar}} in shape to that of M.mystacinus and M.brandtii, but the front part of the braincase is higher. The second and third upper premolars (P2 and P3) are tiny and pressed against the upper canine (C1) and fourth premolar (P4). The canine is less {{well-developed}} than in M.mystacinus. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> cusp present {{on the side of}} the P4. The accessory cusp known as the protoconule is present on each of the upper molars when they are unworn. M.mystacinus lacks the P4 cusp and the protoconules on the molars, but M.brandtii has an even larger cusp on P4.|$|E
5|$|Wade {{asserts that}} <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> {{continuity}} {{from the earlier}} apes of five million years ago to the anatomically modern humans who diverged from them, citing the genetic and social similarities between humans and chimpanzees. He attributes the divergence of the two species from a common ancestor {{to a change in}} their ecological niche; the ancestors of chimpanzees remained in the forests of equatorial Africa, whereas the ancestors of humans moved to open woodland and were exposed to different evolutionary pressures. Although Wade posits that much of human evolution {{can be attributed to the}} physical environment, he also believes that one of the major forces shaping evolution has been the nature of human society itself.|$|E
5|$|While Star Trek {{in general}} {{features}} few overt references to religion, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>clear</b> recognition that a laying aside of past hurts {{is necessary for}} peace, similar {{to the concept of}} shalom in Judaism. Shatner regretted that Kirk's angst at being outmoded was minimized in the final print. A scene where Spock asks Kirk if they have grown so old and inflexible they have outlived their usefulness had two meanings: it was as much Nimoy asking Shatner as it was their characters.|$|E
