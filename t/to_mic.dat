He told Newsweek this {{added to the}} evidence that Trump may have engaged in obstruction of justice, and compared it to the Watergate scandal. He reminded The National that support for impeachment grew after Nixon fired his special prosecutor. Lichtman remarked to Salon that Comey's firing and circumstantial evidence of 2016 election coordination between the Trump campaign and Russia were reasons for impeachment. He explained public opinion in 1974 changed the viewpoints of Nixon's Republican comrades towards impeachment. Lichtman elaborated that impeachment was possible even with a Republican-controlled Congress. He pointed out impeachment grew likely if Republicans felt Trump hurt their election chances. Lichtman emphasized to AM Joy, the first adage of politicians was to safeguard their careers. He commented <b>to</b> <b>Mic</b> and Newsweek the chance of impeachment grew after Comey's Senate Intelligence Committee testimony about his memos, and said the evidence was stronger than that in the impeachment of Bill Clinton. Writing in The Hill Lichtman said that Paul Ryan's assertions {{that some of the}} president's actions could be excused because of ignorance or naivety were indefensible, and would not stand.|$|E

[...] "Whenever we came up with something familiar sounding, it was rejected", said Rechtshaid. Pitch shifting was a major component of recording the album. For tracks such as [...] "Step", drums were recorded on a Varispeed Tape deck set to a lower speed so that they would play back faster and more high pitched. Drummer Chris Tomson would then re-record the drums playing to the sped-up recording to get an uptempo live take.

Ezra Koenig's vocals were run through Eventide H949 and 910 on tracks such as [...] "Diane Young", with both the pitch and formant shifted changed to manipulate the sound of recorded vocals.

40|$|Objective: This study {{compared}} {{the activity of}} ceftolozane–tazobactam and ceftazidime–avibactam against 120 bacterial strains, including extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) producers, carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, isolated from patients admitted to Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. Methods: In vitro susceptibility was tested using the Etest strip minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) method, and PCR was used to characterize the carbapenemase enzymes produced by CRE strains. Results: All 29 ESBL isolates were susceptible <b>to</b> ceftazidime–avibactam (<b>MIC</b> 50 0. 125  μg/ml), whereas all but one were susceptible <b>to</b> ceftolozane–tazobactam (<b>MIC</b> 50 0. 38  μg/ml). Twenty-seven (45 %) CRE isolates were susceptible <b>to</b> ceftazidime–avibactam (<b>MIC</b> 50 ≥ 256  μg/ml), whereas only six (10 %) isolates were susceptible <b>to</b> ceftolozane–tazobactam (<b>MIC</b> 50 ≥ 256  μg/ml). Very few NDM- 1 isolates were susceptible to ceftazidime–avibactam, whereas the majority of OXA- 48 isolates were susceptible. Twenty-nine (94 %) P. aeruginosa isolates were susceptible <b>to</b> ceftazidime–avibactam (<b>MIC</b> 50 1. 5  μg/ml), whereas 30 (97 %) isolates were susceptible <b>to</b> ceftolozane–tazobactam (<b>MIC</b> 50 0. 75  μg/ml). Conclusions: Ceftolozane–tazobactam and ceftazidime–avibactam showed comparable activity against ESBL and P. aeruginosa, with ceftazidime–avibactam having lower MICs against ESBL isolates and ceftolozane–tazobactam having lower MICs against P. aeruginosa.
