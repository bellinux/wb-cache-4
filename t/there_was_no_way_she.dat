500|$|In the {{documentary}} Living With Michael Jackson (2003), Michael alleged that {{near the beginning}} of their relationship, the 12-year-old actress tried to seduce the then 17-year-old singer. According to Jackson, the incident happened at her home, where she attempted to unbutton his shirt and talked explicitly about sex. O'Neal's behavior apparently proved too much for Jackson, who became scared and covered his face, before she walked away. When confronted with the allegation, O'Neal claimed to have been [...] "just as shocked as everyone else". She stated that while having respect for Jackson as an artist and a person, he had [...] "a very vivid imagination". The actress described his statements as [...] "inaccurate"; [...] "at 12 years old, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>way</b> <b>she</b> was capable of being as mature or as sophisticated as he claimed". O'Neal released her autobiography A Paper Life in 2004, a year after the Jackson documentary. In the book, she claimed it was Jackson who attempted to make out with her. The actress wrote, [...] "I was just 12 and not at all ready for a real-life encounter Michael, who was sweating profusely, seemed as intimidated as I was. He jumped up nervously and said, 'Uh ... gotta go.'" ...|$|E
