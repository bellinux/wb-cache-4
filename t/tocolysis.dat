50|$|Terbutaline as a {{treatment}} for premature labor is an off-label use not approved by the FDA. It is a pregnancy category C medication and is routinely prescribed to stop contractions.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Clinical {{guidelines}} do {{not recommend}} maintenance <b>tocolysis</b> {{for the management}} of preterm labour. The French national survey EVAPRIMA revealed it was administered to more than 50 % of women hospitalised for preterm labour. Our aim was to identify the individual and organisational determinants associated with maintenance <b>tocolysis.</b> METHODS: The study was a secondary analysis of the prospective population-based EVAPRIMA study database. Population study included every women hospitalised for preterm labour and at risk of receiving maintenance <b>tocolysis,</b> over a one month period, in 99 randomly selected French maternity units. Main outcome was the prescription of maintenance <b>tocolysis.</b> The association between maintenance <b>tocolysis</b> and individual (maternal or obstetrical) and organisational determinants were evaluated with multilevel analysis. RESULTS: Of the 531 women included, 68. 9 % (95 % CI 0. 65 - 0. 73) received maintenance <b>tocolysis.</b> The only individual factor associated with maintenance <b>tocolysis</b> was gestational age at admission; the rate of maintenance <b>tocolysis</b> was higher among women hospitalised before 32 weeks of gestation. The significantly different rates between maternity units demonstrated the existence of a maternity unit effect. Maintenance <b>tocolysis</b> was also associated with organisational determinants and was more frequent in level 1 (ORa =  6. 54 [2. 21 - 19. 40]) and level 2 maternity units (ORa =  3. 68 [1. 28 - 10. 59]), in units with less than 1500 deliveries/year (ORa =  5. 27 [4. 43 - 19. 44]), and in specific areas of France. CONCLUSION: A maternity unit effect, explained partly by the organisational characteristics of the units, {{plays a major role in}} the practice of maintenance <b>tocolysis.</b> Widespread dissemination of these results might improve adherence to clinical guidelines...|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} if the dose regimen of nifedipine used for <b>tocolysis</b> was effective to achieve uterine quietness, and at which plasma concentration levels this <b>tocolysis</b> was achieved to optimize our dose regimen of nifedipine. In women with preterm labor, nifedipine was administered orally to achieve uterine quietness to prevent preterm birth. Patients (n = 5) were administered 10 mg nifedipine capsules (Adalat capsules, Bayer AG) orally every 15 minutes up to 40 mg in the first hour, and were subsequently given 1 tablet of 20 mg nifedipine slow release (Adalat retard, Bayer AG) t = 90 min. Plasma levels of nifedipine were measured at regular intervals during the first 4 hours after starting <b>tocolysis.</b> In all 5 patients <b>tocolysis</b> was achieved with nifedipine. Peak plasma concentration of nifedipine was 127. 2 +/- 44 ng/mL at 1. 2 +/- 0. 1 hours. Mean plasma concentrations of nifedipine was 67. 4 +/- 28. 4 ng/mL. In all patients, <b>tocolysis</b> was achieved during the 4 hours of blood sampling. There were no adverse hemodynamic side effects seen before and after starting <b>tocolysis</b> with nifedipine. Initial dose regimen of 4 times 10 mg nifedipine capsule orally in the first hour, followed by 20 mg slow release nifedipine at t = 90 min is effective in achieving <b>tocolysis</b> in women with preterm labor.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether the levels of the cytokines interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) and IL- 8 in amniotic fluid identify patients with preterm labor who are resistant to <b>tocolysis.</b> METHODS: Amniocenteses were performed in 23 women with documented preterm labor at 20 - 32 weeks’gestational age who were treated subsequently with tocolytics. The concentrations of IL- 6 and IL- 8 in amniotic fluid were determined by double-antibody radioimmunoassay methods using recombinant human IL standards. RESULTS: Of the 23 patients, five {{failed to respond to}} <b>tocolysis</b> (four delivered within 48 hours), and of the remaining 18, all delivered more than 9 days after <b>tocolysis</b> was initiated (mean 31 &plusmn; 10 days; range 9 - 61). In women who had failed <b>tocolysis,</b> discriminatory concentrations of IL- 6 and IL- 8 were 20 and 15 ng/mL, respectively. Of the patients who had amniotic fluid concentrations higher than these thresholds, all failed <b>tocolysis</b> (100 % positive predictive value) and delivered within 6 days. The patients with levels below these discriminatory concentrations had successful <b>tocolysis,</b> and 17 of 18 delivered more than 2 weeks after treatment (95 % negative predictive value). CONCLUSION: The success of <b>tocolysis</b> and thus delivery remote from an episode of preterm labor is associated with discriminatory amniotic fluid IL- 6 and IL- 8 levels of less than 20 and less than 15 ng/mL, respectively. If the immunologic response that causes the release of IL- 6 and IL- 8 has not occurred, the likelihood of successful <b>tocolysis</b> is extremely high. However, if both IL- 6 and IL- 8 are elevated, <b>tocolysis</b> is likely to fail and delivery may occur within 48 hours. (J So...|$|E

40|$|Premature birth {{before the}} end of the 37 th week of {{gestation}} is associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality in newborns. Using drugs to suppress labour (<b>tocolysis)</b> does not prevent the causes of imminent premature birth, in most cases the birth can merely be temporarily delayed. In Austria, the drugs used in <b>tocolysis</b> are the betamimetic Hexoprenalin, a low cost drug which often leads to cardiovascular side effects, and the oxytocin receptor blocker Atosiban, which has fewer side effects but is more costly. The aims of the systematic review were to summarise (1) existing evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of imminent premature birth, (2) existing studies on the effectiveness and safety of <b>tocolysis</b> and, (3) health economic evaluations of the <b>tocolysis</b> drugs currently authorised in Austria. Evidence-based guidelines for <b>tocolysis</b> make the following recommendations: - <b>Tocolysis</b> is only indicated {{before the end}} of the 34 th week of pregnancy. - In routine practice only one cycle of <b>tocolysis</b> should be carried out in a 48 hour period. Neither a repetition of the treatment nor maintenance therapy are recommended. Using a combination of several <b>tocolysis</b> drugs is also not recommended. - When <b>tocolysis</b> is required, corticosteroids should be administered to help lung maturation, and, if necessary, the patient should be transferred to a neonatological centre. - Contraindications for <b>tocolysis</b> are increasing intrauterine infections, and fetuses that are unviable due to malformations. - Accompanying measures such as strict bed rest, hydration or sedation are not recommended in routine practice. Betamimetics were effective in delaying birth by 2 to 7 days compared to placebo. However, they did not change neonatal mortality and morbidity. No significant differences in effectiveness and safety were found between the different betamimetics. Under study conditions, Atosiban and betamimetics demonstrated the same effectiveness in terms of prolonging pregnancy, but Atosiban had fewer side effects. In order to avoid a side effect associated with betamimetic treatment, 6 women need to be tocolysed using Atosiban (NNT = 6). Atosiban failed to reduce morbidity and mortality to a greater extent than placebo or betamimetics. No health economic evaluations of Hexoprenalin, and just one of Atosiban could be identified, therefore a statement as to the cost-effectiveness of Hexoprenalin compared with Atosiban is currently not possible. Due to study heterogeneity in terms of design, intervention and data used, the cost-effectiveness of the tocolytics used in the studies cannot be assessed...|$|E

Whether continued <b>tocolysis</b> after 48 hours of rescue <b>tocolysis</b> improves neonatal outcome is unproven. ObjectivesTo evaluate the effectiveness of maintenance tocolytic therapy with oral nifedipine on the reduction of adverse neonatal outcomes and the prolongation of pregnancy by performing an individual patient data meta-analysis (IPDMA). Search strategyWe searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases for randomised controlled trials of maintenance <b>tocolysis</b> therapy with nifedipine in preterm labour. Selection criteriaWe selected trials including pregnant women between 24 and 36 (6 / 7) weeks of gestation (gestational age, GA) with imminent preterm labour who had not delivered after 48 hours of initial <b>tocolysis,</b> and compared maintenance nifedipine <b>tocolysis</b> with placebo/no treatment. Data collection and analysisThe primary outcome was perinatal mortality. Secondary outcome measures were intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS), prolongation of pregnancy, GA at delivery, birthweight, neonatal intensive care unit admission, and number of days on ventilation support. Pre-specified subgroup analyses were performed. Main resultsSix randomised controlled trials were included in this IPDMA, encompassing data from 787 patients (n= 390 for nifedipine; n= 397 for placebo/no treatment). There was no difference between the groups for the incidence of perinatal death (risk ratio, RR 1. 36; 95 % confidence interval, 95 %CI 0. 35 - 5. 33), intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) gradeII (RR 0. 65; 95 %CI 0. 16 - 2. 67), necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) (RR 1. 15; 95 %CI 0. 50 - 2. 65), infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS) (RR 0. 98; 95 %CI 0. 51 - 1. 85), and prolongation of pregnancy (hazard ratio, HR 0. 74; 95 %CI 0. 55 - 1. 01).

SELECTION CRITERIA: We selected trials including pregnant women between 24 and 36 (6 / 7) weeks of gestation (gestational age, GA) with imminent preterm labour who had not delivered after 48 hours of initial <b>tocolysis,</b> and compared maintenance nifedipine <b>tocolysis</b> with placebo/no treatment. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: The primary outcome was perinatal mortality. Secondary outcome measures were intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH), necrotising enterocolitis (NEC), infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS), prolongation of pregnancy, GA at delivery, birthweight, neonatal intensive care unit admission, and number of days on ventilation support. Pre-specified subgroup analyses were performed. MAIN RESULTS: Six randomised controlled trials were included in this IPDMA, encompassing data from 787 patients (n = 390 for nifedipine; n = 397 for placebo/no treatment). There was no difference between the groups for the incidence of perinatal death (risk ratio, RR 1. 36; 95 % confidence interval, 95 % CI 0. 35 - 5. 33), intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) ≥ grade II (RR 0. 65; 95 % CI 0. 16 - 2. 67), necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) (RR 1. 15; 95 % CI 0. 50 - 2. 65), infant respiratory distress syndrome (IRDS) (RR 0. 98; 95 % CI 0. 51 - 1. 85), and prolongation of pregnancy (hazard ratio, HR 0. 74; 95 % CI 0. 55 - 1. 01). CONCLUSION: Maintenance <b>tocolysis</b> is not associated with improved perinatal outcome and is therefore not recommended for routine practice.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} a single 250 -mg dose of 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone caproate (17 -OHPC) intramuscularly as adjunct to nifedipine <b>tocolysis</b> in preterm labor. METHOD: Women diagnosed with threatened preterm labor between 22 and 35  weeks' gestation scheduled to receive nifedipine <b>tocolysis</b> and prophylactic antenatal corticosteroid were randomized to a single intramuscular injection of 250  mg of 17 -OHPC or placebo saline in a double-blind fashion. Nifedipine <b>tocolysis</b> and corticosteroids were administered to all participants. Further management was otherwise carried out according to providers' discretion. Main outcome measures are delivery within 48  h and 7  days. RESULTS: Data were analyzed for the 56 participants randomized to 17 -OHPC and 56 randomized to placebo. Delivery rates within 48  h were 11 / 54 (20. 4...|$|E
40|$|AIM—To {{examine the}} {{relation}} between grade III-IV periventricular/intraventricular haemorrhage (PVH/IVH) and antenatal exposure to tocolytic treatment in very low birthweight (VLBW) premature infants.  STUDY DESIGN—The study population consisted of 2794 infants from the Israel National VLBW Infant Database, of gestational age 24 - 32 weeks, who had a cranial ultrasound examination during the first 28 days of life. Infants of mothers with pregnancy induced hypertension or those exposed {{to more than one}} tocolytic drug were excluded. Of the 2794 infants, 2013 (72 %) had not been exposed to <b>tocolysis</b> and 781 (28 %) had been exposed to a single tocolytic agent. To evaluate the effect of <b>tocolysis</b> and confounding variables on grade III-IV PVH/IVH, the χ 2 test, univariate analysis, and a logistic regression model were used.  RESULTS—Of the 781 infants (28 %) exposed to <b>tocolysis,</b> 341 (12. 2 %) were exposed to magnesium sulphate, 263 (9. 4 %) to ritodrine, and 177 (6. 3 %) to indomethacin. The overall incidence of grade III-IV PVH/IVH was 13. 4 %. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, the following factors were related significantly and independently to grade III-IV PVH/IVH: no prenatal steroid treatment, low gestational age, one minute Apgar score 0 - 3, respiratory distress syndrome, patent ductus arteriosus, mechanical ventilation, and pneumothorax. Infants exposed to ritodrine <b>tocolysis</b> (but not to the other tocolytic drugs) were at significantly lower risk of grade III-IV PVH/IVH after adjustment for other variables (odds ratio = 0. 3; 95 % confidence interval 0. 2 to 0. 6).  CONCLUSION—This study suggests that antenatal exposure of VLBW infants to ritodrine <b>tocolysis,</b> in contrast with <b>tocolysis</b> induced by magnesium sulphate or indomethacin, was associated with a lower incidence of grade III-IV PVH/IVH. ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction The APOSTEL-II {{trial was}} a multicenter {{randomized}} placebo-controlled trial, assessing {{the effectiveness of}} maintenance <b>tocolysis</b> with nifedipine.

We report four cases of acute pulmonary edema that occurred during treatment by intravenous <b>tocolysis</b> using nicardipine in pregnancy patients with no previous heart problems. Clinical severity justified hospitalization {{in intensive care unit}} (ICU) each time. Acute dyspnea has begun at an average of 63 hours after initiation of treatment. For all patients, the first diagnosis suspected was pulmonary embolism. The patients ’ condition improved rapidly with appropriate diuretic treatment and by modifying the <b>tocolysis.</b> The use of intravenous nicardipine is widely used for <b>tocolysis</b> in France even if its prescription does not have a marketing authorization. The pathophysiological mechanisms of this complication remain unclear. The main reported risk factors are spontaneous preterm labor, multiple pregnancy, concomitant obstetrical disease, association with beta-agonists, and fetal lung maturation corticotherapy. A better knowledge of this rare but serious adverse event should improve the management of patients. Nifedipine or atosiban, the efficiency of which <b>tocolysis</b> was also studied, could be an alternative. 1...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of 200 mg of daily vaginal natural progesterone to prevent preterm birth in women with preterm labour. DESIGN Multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING Twenty-nine centres in Switzerland and Argentina. POPULATION A total of 385 women with preterm labour (24 (0 / 7) to 33 (6 / 7) weeks of gestation) treated with acute <b>tocolysis.</b> METHODS Participants were randomly allocated to either 200 mg daily of self-administered vaginal progesterone or placebo within 48 hours of starting acute <b>tocolysis.</b> MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES Primary outcome was delivery before 37 weeks of gestation. Secondary outcomes were delivery before 32 and 34 weeks, adverse effects, duration of <b>tocolysis,</b> re-admissions for preterm labour, length of hospital stay, and neonatal morbidity and mortality. The study was ended prematurely based on results of the intermediate analysis. RESULTS Preterm birth occurred in 42. 5...|$|E
40|$|To {{determine}} whether adrenomedullin levels in amniotic fluid {{were associated with}} preterm labor. We measured immunoreactive adrenomedullin in amniotic fluid collected by amniocentesis from 36 women with clinical diagnosis of preterm labor or preterm premature rupture of membranes (PROM) and from 18 normal pregnant women. Amniotic fluid from cases of PROM and failure to respond to <b>tocolysis</b> were associated significantly with higher amniotic fluid adrenomedullin concentrations (177. 0 +/- 22. 5 pg/mL and 182. 7 +/- 22. 0 pg/mL, respectively, P <. 01) than that from uncomplicated pregnancies (101. 2 +/- 28. 1 pg/mL) or preterm labor responsive to <b>tocolysis</b> (102. 3 +/- 26. 8 pg/mL). Amniotic fluid adrenomedullin is higher than normal in cases of PROM and preterm labor unresponsive to <b>tocolysis,</b> perhaps indicating enhanced synthesis from placenta or fetal membranes being stimulated by bacterial products...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this study is to compare the hemodynamic and {{metabolic}} changes after ritodrine and nifedipine <b>tocolysis.</b> Methods: For an open randomized study, patients with preterm labor (N = 185) were allocated to groups to receive ritodrine intravenously (N = 90) or nifedipine orally (N = 95). Results: The mean diastolic blood pressure was significantly lower in the ritodrine group 24 h (65 +/- 12 vs. 70 +/- 8, P= 0. 001) and 48 h (65 +/- 12 vs. 71 +/- 8, P= 0. 004) after starting <b>tocolysis</b> compared with the nifedipine group. Mean maternal heart rate was significantly higher in the ritodrine group 24 h (105 +/- 17 vs. 86 +/- 13, P < 0. 0001) and 48 h (100 +/- 21 vs. 85 +/- 12, P < 0. 0001) after starting <b>tocolysis</b> compared with the nifedipine group. Mean fasting glucose levels were higher (6. 68 +/- 2. 53 vs. 4. 93 +/- 1. 23, P = 0. 0016), while mean potassium levels were lower (3. 52 +/- 0. 84 vs. 3. 81 +/- 0. 45, P = 0. 04) in the ritodrine group 48 h after starting <b>tocolysis</b> compared with the nifedipine group. Conclusions: Use of nifedipine for preterm labor is associated with a lower incidence of adverse hemodynamic and metabolic changes compared with ritodrine after 24 and 48 h of <b>tocolysis.</b> In our opinion nifedipine is the preferred drug of choice for the treatment of preterm labor.
