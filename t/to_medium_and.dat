500|$|As a bowler, Crawford's {{technique}} was also orthodox, {{although he was}} unusual in using his second and third fingers to spin the ball—most bowlers used their first and second. His bowling pace varied from fast <b>to</b> <b>medium,</b> <b>and</b> he spun the ball so much that his fingers snapped audibly as he released it. An accurate bowler, {{it was difficult for}} batsmen to score runs against him. Crawford could swing the ball away from the bat, but his most effective delivery was his off break: Clem Hill stated that Crawford could make the ball turn several inches, despite the hard pitches prevalent in Australia when he played there. John Arlott described him as [...] "the schoolboy genius who turned on Australian pitches where no one else deviated from straight". In 1937, Herbie Collins wrote, at a time when Wally Hammond was considered to be the world's leading all-rounder, that [...] "people who have seen both men consider [...] a better all-rounder".|$|E

2500|$|When {{compared}} to {{shell and tube}} exchangers, the stacked-plate arrangement typically has lower volume and cost. Another {{difference between the two}} is that plate exchangers typically serve low to medium pressure fluids, compared <b>to</b> <b>medium</b> <b>and</b> high pressures of shell and tube. [...] A third and important difference is that plate exchangers employ more countercurrent flow rather than cross current flow, which allows lower approach temperature differences, high temperature changes, and increased efficiencies.|$|E

2500|$|In {{terms of}} pure keeping ability, Berry was rated {{extremely}} highly, particularly his ability [...] "keeping up" [...] both to leg-spinner Shane Warne and <b>to</b> <b>medium</b> (<b>and</b> even fast-medium) paced bowlers. Warne, his Victorian teammate, said that [...] "Darren Berry {{up to the}} stumps has probably been the best keeper that I've {{ever seen in my}} time... I really wish he did get the opportunity to show how good a keeper he was, with a baggy green cap playing for Australia." [...] Berry has often talked about his leg-side stumping off the bowling of paceman Paul Reiffel as one of his best achievements.|$|E
2500|$|The War Department, {{seeking to}} stifle {{procurement}} of the B-17 while belatedly recognizing that coordinated air-ground support {{had been long}} neglected, decided that it would order only two-engined [...] "light" [...] bombers in fiscal years 1939 through 1941. It also rejected further advancement of Project A, the development program {{for a very long}} range bomber. In collaboration with the Navy, the Joint Board (whose senior member was Army Chief of Staff Gen. Malin Craig) on 29 June 1938 issued a ruling that it could foresee no use for a long-range bomber in future conflict. [...] As a direct result, the last planned order of long-range bombers (67 B-17s) was cancelled by Craig and a moratorium on further development of them was put into effect by restricting R funding <b>to</b> <b>medium</b> <b>and</b> light bombers. This policy would last less than a year, as it went against not only the trends of technological development, but against the geopolitical realities of coming war. In August 1939 the Army's research and development program for 1941 was modified with the addition of nearly five million dollars to buy five long-range bombers for experimental purposes, resulting on 10 November 1939 in the request by Arnold of the developmental program that would create the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, which was approved on 2 December.|$|E
