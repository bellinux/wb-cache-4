5|$|Philosopher Taede Smedes {{argued that}} {{religious}} language is symbolic. Denying any conflict {{between science and}} religion, he proposes that 'to believe' means to accept a conviction (that God exists, {{in the context of}} Christianity), which is different from 'knowing', which only occurs once something is proven. Thus, according to Smedes, we believe <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> do not know for sure. Smedes argues that, rather than being part of the world, God is so far beyond the world {{that there can be no}} common standard to which both God and the world can be compared. He argues that people can still believe in God, even though he cannot be compared to anything in the world, because belief in God is just an alternative way of viewing that world (he likens this to two people viewing a painting differently). Smedes claims that there should be no reason to look for a meaning behind our metaphors and symbols of God because the metaphors are all we have of God. He suggests that we can only talk of God pro nobis (for us) and not in se (as such) or sine nobis (without us). The point, he argues, is not that our concept of God should correspond with reality, but that we can only conceive of God through metaphors.|$|E
25|$|When we {{talk about}} a {{permanent}} vegetative state, I am offended by that. Terri smiles and acknowledges the people that love her {{when they come to}} see her. She cries when they leave. How heartless are we to call somebody like Terri Schiavo a vegetable? What are we thinking?When we think about this case, we need to think about the message that we are sending to our children and our grandchildren. What we do in this Chamber tonight is as important as anything we have done in defending our Nation, in doing the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> do as Members of Congress.|$|E
25|$|As a brief example, Frame {{uses the}} {{epistemology}} of Kant, who taught that {{the categories of}} thought that are necessary for our understanding the world around us, such as causality, logic, time, space, and order, are structured by our minds and imposed upon the things we experience. In order to be rational and {{make sense out of}} life we must assume, or presuppose, these notions. Because we cannot empirically verify these categories by touch, smell, sight, etc. they must be thought of as created by and arising from our minds, thus ordering and providing the criterion for those <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can empirically verify. This led Kant to conclude that if we are to think of anything at all we must think in terms of everything being caused by something logically and temporally prior to it. This led to a fairly deterministic view of mankind.|$|E

There was a lack of shame about those <b>things,</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had to portray with a lack of shame in order to make it work." ...|$|E
500|$|A large {{aspect of}} the game is the {{alternative}} history in which it is set, where the Nazis won the Second World War. The team saw this aspect as an opportunity to create everything at a very large scale, with very little limitations; [...] "so many <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> can create, and work with, and expand on. So, I never really felt that we were limited," [...] said Öjerfors.|$|E
500|$|After {{the death}} of {{incumbent}} Senator Ted Kennedy, a special election to succeed him was scheduled. On September 8, 2009, Capuano collected nomination papers {{to run for the}} seat and on September 18, he announced his candidacy. Capuano ran as a [...] "Washington insider," [...] comparing himself to Kennedy saying: [...] "was [...] not the ultimate insider ... I think that’s probably one of the best <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> share.” In his campaign Capuano received several high-profile endorsements, including House Speaker Pelosi and former Massachusetts Governor and 1988 Democratic presidential nominee, Michael Dukakis.|$|E

500|$|I have no {{argument}} with someone having a fundamentalist belief in Christianity or Islam or Judaism or Buddhism or anything else, but I {{do have a}} serious objection to people trying to impose their values on other people. [...] And that's what this episode is about. No one {{has the right to}} force anyone to believe the things that they believe. That's one of the beautiful things about Gene Roddenberry's vision of IDIC (Infinite Diversity in Infinite Combinations), {{and that was one of}} the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> really wanted to hammer home here.

500|$|The 278 Beti chiefs under Atangana's control {{began to}} oppose his primacy by the mid-1920s. His control fell {{especially}} among the Bane. In 1924, the Bane filed a complaint against Atangana in court, claiming, [...] "We work always and it is Atangana who receives the money. For all the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have sent to the Europeans, such as chickens and eggs, through Atangana, we have received nothing." [...] They plotted to raise their own paramount chief and to drum up sentiment against Atangana among the common people. The French arrested the plotters for refusing to pay their taxes and provide labourers. This left Atangana still head of the Bane, but his influence had been severely curtailed.|$|E

500|$|Call of Duty 2 {{was going}} to be more {{immersive}} than the original Call of Duty. Vince Zampella, creative director of Infinity Ward, said, [...] "We didn't want to take any of the parts out that made Call of Duty so good. But {{there were a couple of}} <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> admit could have been done better". A demo of the game showed a more open gameplay style and a better AI for the enemies, who would actively go after the player. There are a set number of enemies set on the map that will begin reacting to the player's presence once the first shot has been fired. Groups of enemies farther away send units up to see what is happening and add to the combat while enemies directly in front of the player will join in and take cover quickly.|$|E
500|$|Wenger managed Nagoya for {{the final}} time on 28 August 1996 and {{delivered}} a farewell speech, thanking the fans in Japanese. Assessing his time in Japan, biographer Jasper Rees felt Wenger had left a mixed legacy at the club, as the immediate success was followed by fluctuating league finishes; {{it was not until}} 2010 that Nagoya (under Stojković) won their first title. Wenger continues to speak fondly of his career in Japan and once likened the country to his ancestral home: [...] "It has beautiful <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> have lost in Europe, beautiful things that make life good." [...] He also credited the culture for improving his temperament and rediscovering his passion for the game. Wenger returned to Japan as a television pundit for the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup, and a decade later, took Arsenal to face Nagoya in a pre-season friendly.|$|E
500|$|Co-showrunner Wyman {{also served}} as episode director, marking his {{television}} directorial debut. He noted his love of the experience, as it permitted him to grow closer with the series' actors and [...] "actually work with them on a level that [...] before and really get down there with them." [...] Wyman was originally supposed to direct several episodes the previous year and earlier in the season, but found he was too busy. He explained, [...] "Then an episode was coming up that we were thinking about writing and I really felt close to it. [...] The opportunity came up where somebody had fallen out and I felt {{that this is the}} perfect time because everything was completely under control. [...] It allowed me to go and do it. [...] It's an episode that's really close to me. [...] It's about love and it's about all the great <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> talk about on Fringe." ...|$|E

500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. Ology (website)'s Josh Harrison gave it an {{eight out of}} ten rating, writing that [...] "You gotta love these Simpsons episodes that really get {{into the heart of}} a subculture. Diving head-first into the world of foodies and food blogging (after a hilarious geeky pit-stop at a video game expo), 'The Food Wife' shish-kabobs gourmet diehards while highlighting a very real problem between Homer and Marge." [...] He concluded that the episode is [...] "a definite swing for the fences, and I think it hits its mark completely." [...] The scenes at the video game convention were praised by Anthony Severino of Game Revolution as well. He commented that the writers [...] "nailed it. Everything from the massive displays, long lines, and even the look of the Los Angeles Convention Center was spot on. The best was how they portrayed people with 'VIP passes', you know those <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> journalists get, as douches who think they're better than the regulars." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Harry Shearer criticized what he {{perceived}} as the show's declining quality: [...] "I rate {{the last three seasons}} as among the worst, so season four looks very good to me now." [...] Dan Castellaneta responded: [...] "I don't agree,... I think Harry's issue is that the show isn't as grounded {{as it was in the}} first three or four seasons, that it's gotten crazy or a little more madcap. I think it organically changes to stay fresh." [...] Also in 2004 author Douglas Coupland described claims of declining quality in the series as [...] "hogwash", saying [...] "The Simpsons hasn't fumbled the ball in fourteen years, it's hardly likely to fumble it now." [...] In an April 2006 interview, Groening said: [...] "I honestly don't see any end in sight. I think it's possible that the show will become too financially cumbersome... but right now, the show is creatively, I think, as good or better than it's ever been. The animation is incredibly detailed and imaginative, and the stories do <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> haven't done before. So creatively there's no reason to quit." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2006, John Lasseter {{spoke about}} how they worked {{hard to make the}} {{animation}} believable, saying: [...] "It took many months of trial and error, and practicing test animation, to figure out how each car moves and how their world works. Our supervising animators, Doug Sweetland and Scott Clark, and the directing animators, Bobby Podesta and James Ford Murphy, did an amazing job working with the animation team to determine the unique movements for each character based on its age and the type of car it was. Some cars are like sports cars and they're much tighter in their suspension. Others are older '50s cars that are a lot looser and have more bounce to them. We wanted to get that authenticity in there but also to make sure each car had a unique personality. We also wanted each animator {{to be able to put}} some of themself in the character and give it their own spin. Every day in dailies, it was so much fun because we would see <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> had never seen in our lives. The world of cars came alive in a believable and unexpected way." ...|$|E
