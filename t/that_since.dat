5|$|A fourth reason {{concerns}} students {{rather than}} researchers: Gonzalez Galli argues <b>that</b> <b>since</b> people naturally imagine that evolution has a purpose or direction, then {{the use of}} teleological language by scientists may act {{as an obstacle to}} students when learning about natural selection.

5|$|During July 2017, Governor Cuomo and Mayor Bill de Blasio disputed who has {{control of}} the subway system.

5|$|In {{conversations with}} Eidelman, Meyer {{mentioned}} <b>that</b> <b>since</b> the marches {{that accompanied the}} main titles for the previous Star Trek films were so good, he {{had no desire to}} compete with them by composing a bombastic opening. He also felt <b>that</b> <b>since</b> the film was darker than its predecessors, it demanded something different musically as a result. He mentioned the opening to Igor Stravinsky's The Firebird as similar to the foreboding sound he wanted. Two days later Eidelman produced a tape of his idea for the main theme, played on a synthesizer. Meyer was impressed by the speed of the work and the close fit to his vision. Meyer approached producer Steven Charles-Jaffe with Eidelman's CD, which reminded Jaffe of Bernard Herrmann; Eidelman was given the task of composing the score.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>since</b> Article 9(1) of the Singapore Constitution is pitched {{at a high level}} of generality, there is no limitation in the ordinary natural meaning of the phrase.

5|$|A second {{emigrant}} ship—the Kennersley Castle, a merchantman docked at Leith, near Edinburgh—was {{hired by}} MacGregor in October 1822, and left Leith on 22 January 1823 with almost 200 emigrants aboard. MacGregor again saw the settlers off, coming aboard {{to see that}} they were well quartered; to their delight, he announced <b>that</b> <b>since</b> this was the maiden emigrant voyage from Scotland to Poyais, all the women and children would sail free of charge. The Cazique was rowed back to shore to rousing cheers from his colonists. The ship's captain Henry Crouch fired a six-gun broadside salute, hoisted the supposed flag of Poyais, then steered the ship out of port.|$|E

5|$|According to Christian theologian Gordon J.

Wenham argued <b>that</b> <b>since</b> the impact of the food laws was a public affair, this would have enhanced Jewish attachment to them as a reminder of their distinct status as Jews.|$|E

After conducting a poll through the former republican infrastructure—587 signed in favour of the annexation, 6,591 against—he organised a second deputation to London, made up of himself and Joubert with Bok again serving as secretary. The envoys met the British High Commissioner in Cape Town, Sir Bartle Frere, and arrived in London on 29 June 1878 to find a censorious letter from Shepstone waiting for them, along with a communication <b>that</b> <b>since</b> Kruger was agitating against the government he had been dismissed from the executive council.|$|E
5|$|According to the Miami Herald the {{financing}} {{structure of the}} plan is notable {{for the amount of}} financial risk taken by the builders in return for the long term concession on the tunnel. Opposition to the project states that it is a waste of taxpayer money, and may become Miami's Big Dig, the nickname of a tunnel megaproject in Boston, which was a $4 billion project that ended up costing $22 billion in cost overruns. Many believe that the Port of Miami Tunnel Project will be likely to have similar cost overruns, even though the Secretary of the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) promised that the project would finish on time and without overruns. They also state that truck traffic is not a problem in Downtown, and <b>that</b> <b>since</b> 1991 car and truck traffic had reduced significantly.|$|E

The ACB concluded <b>that,</b> <b>since</b> Waugh and Warne had previously accused Pakistani cricket captain Saleem Malik of attempting to bribe them to lose matches, their credibility as witnesses would be damaged if their own involvement with John was publicised. The ACB reported the matter to the International Cricket Council, and there the matter ended.|$|E
