50|$|The <b>turnip</b> <b>sawfly</b> {{was found}} to result in diploid males and females after sister-brother matings. This differs from normal haplodiploid {{hymenoptera}} and after a further cross causing triploid males, resulted in evidence that sex determination is controlled by a single locus. The sawflies {{have been found to}} sequester glucosinolates like many insects in larval stages. Removal of various glucosinolates has been shown to reduce sensitivity to host plants in later adult stages. The fact that glucosinolates being removed causes reduced sensitivity to future possible host plants has been used to argue that these chemicals are important in specific larval patterning to future host plant options. Due to no current primitive Hymenoptera, the <b>turnip</b> <b>sawfly</b> is being worked on for genome sequencing. This effort will add to the planned i5K, the effort to sequence 5,000 insect genomes in 5 years.|$|E
50|$|The <b>turnip</b> <b>sawfly</b> Athalia rosae is {{a typical}} sawfly with dark green or blackish 18 - 25 mm long larvae that feed on plants of the {{brassica}} family, and can sometimes be a pest. It winters below the ground, emerging in early summer as a 7 - 8 mm adult with a mainly orange body and a black head. The adult feeds on nectar.|$|E
40|$|Following the {{limitations}} {{regarding the use}} of the neonicotinoids: clothianidin, thiamethoxam and imidacloprid there are no currently available insecticide seed dressings for oilseed rape in Poland. For maize here is only one seed dressing containing methiocarb available with a very narrow registered scope of use. The impact of limitations on protection possibilities of other major Polish agricultural crops is either negligible or non-existent. In consequence a group of economically important insect pests of maize [dungbeetles (Melolonthidae); click beetles (Elateridae); noctuid moths (Agrotinae) ] and oilseed rape [leaf miners (Agromyzidae), <b>turnip</b> <b>sawfly</b> (Athalia colibri Christ.), cabbage weevils (Curculionidae), cabbage root fly (Hylemyia brassicae Bche.), diamond-back moth (Plutella maculipennis Curt.) ] is left without any legal possibility of chemical control. For the other important pests of the early growth stage of oilseed rape development, there are only pyrethroids available together with one product containing chloropiryfos that can be applied once per vegetation season. Since both maize and oilseed rape are grown in Poland on the area of approximately 1 million ha (each crop), this situation raises concerns about production possibilities as well as development of pest resistance...|$|E
5|$|An insect {{survey in}} September 2009 {{recorded}} 187 beetle species, including two new to Norfolk, the rove beetle Phytosus nigriventris and the fungus beetle Leiodes ciliaris, and two very rarely {{seen in the}} county, the sap beetle Nitidula carnaria and the clown beetle Gnathoncus nanus. There were also 24 types of spider, and the five ant species included the nationally rare Myrmica specioides. The rare millipede Thalassisobates littoralis, a specialist of coastal shingle habitats, was found here in 1972, and a red-veined darter appeared in 2012. Tens of thousands of migrant <b>turnip</b> <b>sawflies</b> were recorded {{for a few days}} in late summer 2006, along with red-eyed damselflies. The silver Y moth also appears in large numbers in some years.|$|R
40|$|Hymenopteran insects (sawflies, ants, bees, and wasps) have {{an unusual}} genetic system called haplodiploidy, where parthenogenetically {{produced}} haploid eggs become males, and fertilized, diploid eggs become females. Several hypotheses {{have been proposed}} to explain the mechanism of such sex determination, including control at a single polymorphic locus. From experiments of mother-son mating and using a genetic marker, we show that a single multiallele locus controls sex determination in the <b>turnip</b> <b>sawfly</b> (Athalia rosae). We estimated the number of alleles at this single locus in a field population by analyzing the rate of diploid males {{in the field and}} the rate of diploid males by random crossing in the laboratory. Only one diploid male was discovered in 1306 diploid larvae collected in the field. However, the number of alleles calculated by random crossing in the laboratory was 45 – 50. We suggest that the effective population size may be much larger than that from the areas where we collected larvae, and that there are mechanisms for avoiding inbreeding, including protogyny, dispersion, and sperm displacement by second-mated males. Hymenopteran insects have a genetic determination system called haplodiploidy, where fertilized, diploid eggs become females, and unfertilized, haploid eggs become males. A single-locus complementary sex determination (CSD) syste...|$|E
40|$|Insect herbivores exhibit various {{strategies}} {{to counter the}} toxic effects of plant chemical defenses. These strategies include the detoxification, excretion, and sequestration of plant secondary metabolites. The latter strategy is often considered to provide an additional benefit in that it provides herbivores with protection against natural enemies such as predators. Profiles of sequestered chemicals {{are influenced by the}} food plants from which these chemicals are derived. We compared the effects of sequestration and nonsequestration of plant secondary metabolites in two specialist herbivores on the development of a generalist predator, Podisus maculiventris. Profiles of glucosinolates, secondary metabolites characteristic for the Brassicaceae, are known to differ considerably both inter- and intraspecifically. Throughout their immature (=nymphal) development, the predator was fed on larval stages of either sequestering (<b>turnip</b> <b>sawfly,</b> Athalia rosae) or nonsequestering (small cabbage white butterfly, Pieris rapae) prey that in turn had been feeding on plants originating from three wild cabbage (Brassica oleracea) populations that have previously been shown to differ in their glucosinolate profiles. We compared survival, development time, and adult body mass as parameters for bug performance. Our results show that sequestration of glucosinolates by A. rosae only marginally affected the development of P. maculiventris. The effects of plant population on predator performance were variable. We suggest that sequestration of glucosinolates by A. rosae functions not only as a defensive mechanism against some predators, but may also be an alternative way of harmlessly dealing with plant allelochemicals. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E
