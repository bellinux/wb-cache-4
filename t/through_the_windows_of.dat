5|$|At school, Dawn {{is crying}} in the {{bathroom}} upset that a girl called her a freak. In art class she talks with a boy as they sketch, and the two share a moment of understanding about being troubled. Buffy arrives and pulls Dawn out of class into the hall. <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> the art room, the class watches Buffy tell her that Joyce has had an accident. The rest of the conversation is muffled. Dawn collapses in the hall, sobbing.|$|E
5|$|The {{tradition}} of the dole continues to the present, and every Easter Monday tea, cheese and bread are given to local widows and pensioners <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> Biddenden's former workhouse. All those eligible for the annual dole are given a Biddenden cake, and they are sold as souvenirs to visitors. The cakes are baked so hard as to be inedible, to allow better preservation as souvenirs; they are baked in large batches every few years and kept until the stock runs out. Historically, the loaves used were of the archaic quartern loaf size, but this particular part of the tradition ended when Biddenden's last bakery closed in the 1990s.|$|E

25|$|Residents threw {{rocks and}} oyster shells <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> the LDS meetinghouse and fired {{at least one}} gunshot into the building. In 1906, arsonists burned the meetinghouse to the ground. Organized Mormon {{religious}} services did not resume on Harkers Island until 1909. A new LDS meetinghouse was constructed on the island in the 1930s. Despite these difficult beginnings, Harker's Island {{has one of the}} highest percentages of residents as members of the Latter-day Saints of any locality in North Carolina.|$|E
25|$|The {{second of}} the Dublin car bombs went off at about 17:30 on Talbot Street, near the {{intersection}} with Lower Gardiner Street. Talbot Street was the main route from the city centre to Connolly station, Dublin's primary railway station. It was parked at 18 Talbot Street, on the north side, opposite Guineys department store. The bomb car was a metallic blue mink Ford Escort, registration number 1385 WZ. It had been stolen that morning in the Docks area of Belfast. The blast damaged buildings and vehicles {{on both sides of}} the street. People suffered severe burns and were struck by shrapnel, flying glass and debris; some were hurled <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> shops.|$|E
25|$|The Distinguished Service Cross is {{presented}} to Lloyd A. Hamilton, First Lieutenant (Air Service), U.S. Army, for extraordinary heroism in action at Varssenaere, Belgium, August 13, 1918. Leading a low bombing attack on a German aerodrome, 30 miles behind the line, Lieutenant Hamilton destroyed the hangars {{on the north side}} of the aerodrome and then attacked a row of enemy machines, flying as low as 20 feet from the ground despite intense machine-gun fire, and setting fire to three of the German planes. He then turned and fired bursts <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> the chateau in which the German pilots were quartered, 26 of whom were afterwards reported killed.

25|$|In late 1933, Gold {{served a}} brief prison {{sentence}} {{after having been}} arrested for participating in a hunger march in Wilmington, Delaware. Hunger marches had been occurring throughout the United States since 1931. Catholic social activist Dorothy Day herself encouraged Gold {{to participate in a}} march from New York City to Washington, D.C. Gold was one of 315 marchers who left New York City on November 29, 1932, bound for Washington. The marchers reached Wilmington on December 2, their number having increased by several hundred. Their permit to march in the city was withdrawn. That night, the police herded most of the marchers into a warehouse downtown, but Gold, most of the women and most of the marchers from New England stayed in a rented church two blocks away. That night, the marchers at the church were refused permission to hold a meeting in the street, so they held it on the church steps. When the police tried to stop the meeting, the marchers resisted. The police began beating the people listening to the speaker, and the marchers fled into the church and barricaded the doors. The police fired tear gas <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> the building, then broke down the doors and entered the building with weapons drawn. The marchers resisted by hurling chairs at the police, but were beaten and gassed repeatedly until subdued. Twenty-three marchers, including Gold, were arrested. Four police and three marchers were hospitalized. Gold was convicted of incitement to riot, and served a brief prison term in Wilmington in late 1933 and early 1934. Gold participated in additional hunger marches in 1933 and 1934, and was arrested again in Albany, New York, in late October 1934.|$|E
500|$|James Tomison, {{who became}} a keeper in 1861, wrote of the bird migrations visible from the tower: [...] "Hundreds of birds are flying about in all directions, {{crossing}} and re-crossing one another's flight, but never coming into collision, all seemingly {{of the opinion that}} the only way of escape out of the confusion into which they have got is <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> the lantern".

500|$|After {{discharging}} a {{total of}} 23 rounds, Williams fled the scene by car, firing a further six shots from a second, [...]22 calibre, pistol as he did so. In Stanhurst Way he shot at two boys, aged 10 and 11, who were playing football, and at a woman, but missed them all. Passing through Wednesbury, he shot <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> a barber's shop and two houses. In one of these, a nine-year-old girl was hurt by flying glass. He stopped for petrol in Walsall and drove off without paying.|$|E

While Lennon reportedly unleashed his anger that day by throwing two bricks <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> McCartney's St John's Wood home, Harrison channelled his frustration {{into a new}} composition, [...] "Sue Me, Sue You Blues". Harrison biographer Simon Leng suggests that the song [...] "takes a nearly impersonal overview of the Beatles' self-infliced legal wounds".

500|$|A fifth Tiger halted on {{the main}} street short of the ambush site, {{apparently}} waiting for the British to emerge from cover. The Tiger was spotted by the Firefly crew <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> a corner building. They reversed to shoot through the windows. The Tiger was hit on the gun mantlet and raced past the side street. A Cromwell advanced onto the main street and fired into {{the rear of the}} Tiger, knocking it out and then reversed back into cover. The Firefly knocked out a Panzer IV and during a lull, the disabled tanks were set on fire with blankets and petrol. Outside the town, the 7th Armoured Division brigade group stretched back to Amayé-sur-Seulles and was attacked from the north and south. The attacks were repulsed and [...] at Tracey-Bocage, the 11th Hussars overwhelmed a pocket of resistance.|$|E

500|$|The Maya {{measured}} the 584-day Venus cycle with an error of just two hours. Five cycles of Venus equated to eight 365-day haab calendrical cycles, and {{this period was}} recorded in the codices. The Maya also followed the movements of Jupiter, Mars and Mercury. When Venus rose as the Morning Star, this {{was associated with the}} rebirth of the Maya Hero Twins. For the Maya, the heliacal rising of Venus was associated with destruction and upheaval. Venus was closely associated with warfare, and the hieroglyph meaning [...] "war" [...] incorporated the glyph-element symbolizing the planet. Sight-lines <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> the Caracol building at Chichen Itza align with the northernmost and southernmost extremes of Venus' path. Maya rulers launched military campaigns to coincide with the heliacal or cosmical rising of Venus, and would also sacrifice important captives to coincide with such conjunctions.|$|E
500|$|Cliff White of NME {{called the}} album [...] "almost a voyeur's delight", {{and was not}} {{favorable}} of Gaye's sensual themes, stating [...] "Although getting down, getting mellow, and getting it on are paramount considerations {{in the privacy of}} my own home, I don't particularly want to be party to someone else's night life. Not on record anyway... Like peeking <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> the Gaye residence in the wee wee hours. Perhaps that's your kick, but personally I find it a mite frustrating." [...] White also criticized the album's sound, describing the songs as [...] "all expressions of the same mood. Sensual, satisfied, and spaced out", and calling I Want You [...] "simply the explorative aftermath of Let's Get It On. The sweet nuthin's of a drowsy, sweat-streaked lover." [...] Robert Christgau of The Village Voice wrote favorably of the album's sound quality. However, he criticized the lyrical content, as well as Ware's involvement in songwriting, stating [...] "was it Ware who instructed Marvin to eliminate all depth and power from his voice? I mean, if you're into insisting on sex it's in bad taste to whine about it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{features}} Lee {{in a warehouse}} and begins with her burying a photograph beneath {{a hole in the}} floorboards. After she walks away singing [...] "Under your spell again, I can't say no to you" [...] while looking directly in the camera, the hole in the floorboard slowly covers up. As she walks by a bookcase, she touches the books placed on it and they start smoking. Then she goes to her desk to write in a diary, while the floorboards and items surrounding her begin to melt. After finishing with the writing, she walks by a mirror and takes a look at herself as it starts to melt. As she begins to play a baby grand piano, the piano and the room surrounding her begin to catch on fire until rain begins to fall and extinguishes the flames. The room appears to be burnt and wasted. As the sun begins to shine <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>windows</b> <b>of</b> the building, a small vine grows from the floorboard and expands across the room, and blue flowers begin to blossom from the vines above the piano.|$|E
