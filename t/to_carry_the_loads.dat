5|$|The {{bridge was}} {{completed}} in 1928 by the NSW Department of Public Works and, although opened as a traffic bridge, it was designed <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>the</b> <b>loads</b> required for a railway, once the Mildura railway line had been extended over the bridge. The line was never extended beyond Yelta, where the terminus remains to this day. The location of the bridge {{was thought to be}} convenient, as it provided a link to the Sturt Highway without travelling farther upstream to Mildura. It is the only remaining steel truss bridge with a lift span on the Murray, although other lifting bridges still exist along the river. The bridge was built after the decline in commercial river traffic on the Murray. Due to its significance to the local area, it has been listed on the NSW State Heritage Register.|$|E

50|$|A {{series of}} tasks were early {{identified}} as {{critical to the}} project's success. The first task was the undertaking of a thorough geotechnical examination of the existing tower founding material.

Nine metre bore holes were drilled through the existing foundations and a footing/soil profile was established. This soil profile showed that beneath the sandstone and lime concrete footings was a 1.5 to 2.0 metre band of sandy clay, and weathered sandstone, which was judged inadequate <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>the</b> tower <b>loads,</b> particularly under <b>the</b> stress of wind and seismic loading.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Tensioned {{membrane}} {{structures are}} pre-stressed membrane structures {{that are appropriate}} {{to be used for}} long span application. Tensioned membrane structures must depend on their shape and internal pre-stress alone to achieve stability and <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>the</b> <b>loads.</b> Some of the largest stadiums, airports, convention halls and commercial places are tensioned membrane structures. It is essential to perform shape-finding analysis while dealing with tensioned membrane structures. In this study, shape-finding analysis is carried out using computer program for stress analysis which is based on theory of nonlinear displacement method. Shape-finding of membrane surface bordered by Egg has been investigated. In this study, the possibility of adopting the form of Egg as surface shape for tensioned membrane structure has been studied...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION Nowadays, {{some of the}} {{concrete}} structures that built in the past years were inadequate <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>the</b> <b>loads.</b> This insufficient load carrying capacity has resulted from poor maintenance, increasing in legal load limit, insufficient reinforcement, excessive deflections, structural damages(such as vechicient impact or fire damages) or reinforcement corrosion. These structures almost are classified as deficient and need of strengthening or replacement. The required functional life of the structure {{plays a major role}} in the decision whether to strengthening the existing structure or to demolish and reconstruct with a new structure. Such a decision is largely influenced by site conditions, operational requirements, possible technical solutions, and the cost-benefit relationship. For the strengthening, a number of methods have been developed to satisfy the demand for an increased maximum load bearing capacity or to fulfil the serviceability requirements. In many cases ext...|$|E
40|$|Load paths can be mapped from vector {{plots of}} 2 ̆ 7 {{pointing}} stress vectors 2 ̆ 7. They define a path along which {{a component of}} load remains constant as it traverses the solution domain. In this paper the theory for the paths is first defined. Properties of the plots that enable a designer to interpret the structural behavior from the contours are then identified. Because stress is a second order tensor defined on an orthogonal set of axes, the vector plots define separate paths for load transfer in each direction of the set of axes. An algorithm is therefore presented that combines the vectors to define a topology <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>the</b> <b>loads.</b> The algorithm is shown to straighten the paths reducing bending moments and removing stress concentration. Application to a bolted joint, a racing car body and a yacht hull demonstrate {{the usefulness of the}} plots...|$|E
50|$|Until {{the early}} nineteenth century Canterbury's line of supply for goods had been along the River Stour which flows to Pegwell Bay, near Ramsgate on the eastern coast of Kent. Although this is only 17 mi as the crow flies, the {{meandering}} river journey is around 70 mi. The river was continually silting up, and the cost of dredging such a length was prohibitive. Although turnpikes had been built, four or five carts were needed <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>the</b> <b>load</b> of a single barge.|$|R
50|$|Spectacular {{accidents}} {{have occurred}} when the forms were either removed too soon or had been under-designed <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>the</b> <b>load</b> imposed by <b>the</b> weight of the uncured concrete. Less critical and much more common (though no less embarrassing and often costly) are those cases in which under-designed formwork bends or breaks during the filling process (especially if filled with a high-pressure concrete pump). This then results in fresh concrete escaping out of the formwork in a form blowout, often in large quantities.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A micromechanical {{finite element}} model {{incorporated}} with molecular mechanics is employed to determine the mechanical properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT). The SWCNT is modelled as a space-frame structure. The bonds between the carbon atoms are simulated as beam members <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>the</b> <b>loads,</b> while the carbon atoms are the joints of the members. The modified Morse potential is adopted to characterize the non-linear behavior of C-C bonds. In this work, the mechanical properties of SWCNT such as the Young’s modulus, ultimate strength and strain are investigated. To verify the proposed FE model and evaluate its performance, the effects of diameter and chirality on the mechanical properties of SWCNT are presented. It is found that both the Young’s modulus and ultimate strength of SWCNT increase monotonically {{with the increase of}} diameter. The Young’s modulus of armchair is larger than that of zigzag SWCNTs. These results are in good agreement with the existing numerical and experimental results...|$|E
40|$|Cut- Outs {{throw the}} {{fuselage}} are {{very common in}} commercial aircrafts. One {{of the most critical}} Cut- Out that an aircraft has in its fuselage, is the one used to mount the Horizontal Stabilizer because a very high load concentration in this region occurs. Therefore, additional structures such as splices and beams must be installed <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>the</b> <b>loads</b> around the openings. This Master Thesis studies the mechanical behaviour of the Cut – Out of the Horizontal Stabilizer with a Finite Element Model and provides the static sizing and fatigue check of the parts related to it. The analyses performed on the structure are: static strength of the splices, damage tolerance at skin, bolted joints analysis and fatigue check of the splices. The results show a very small reserve factors in this region. Therefore, this Cut- Out must be treated as critical, especially during the manufacturing of the aircraft but this also implies a good design because it will withstand all the known load cases and it is as light as possible...|$|E
30|$|At present, bridges are {{designed}} {{based on the}} use of a live load model present in the respective codes, uniformly applied to all bridges. Therefore, some bridges carrying a relatively small volume of traffic {{are designed}} <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>the</b> <b>loads</b> of heavy vehicles that are unlikely to act during their service life, resulting in uneconomical design. In other cases, non-standard bridges, as long-span bridges (cable-stayed, arches,…), may be subject to very high levels of live load that the bridge most probably will never experience. This is because the live load model in the code is normally calibrated for short- and medium-span bridges, and the direct application to very long spans derives on the overestimation of the loading. If it was possible to design a bridge so that it can carry the design load equivalent to the loads of vehicles that usually travel and control bridge performance to structurally offset the loads of heavy vehicles that may be hazardous to the bridge, safety and reliability of the bridge may be ensured against such unexpected heavy loads (Kim et al. 2000). Reducing the design live load may also lead to the reduction of the volume of materials used. This approach should therefore be taken actively also from a viewpoint of resource saving (Holnicki-Szulc and Rodellar 1998).|$|E
