5|$|Castro stockpiled {{weapons for}} a planned {{attack on the}} Moncada Barracks, a {{military}} garrison outside Santiago de Cuba, Oriente.

The rebels would seize control, raid the armory and escape before reinforcements arrived. Supplied with new weaponry, Castro intended to arm supporters and spark a revolution among Oriente's impoverished cane cutters. The plan was to then seize control of a Santiago radio station, broadcasting the Movement's manifesto, hence promoting further uprisings. Castro's plan emulated those of the 19th century Cuban independence fighters who had raided Spanish barracks; Castro saw himself as the heir <b>to</b> <b>independence</b> leader and national hero José Martí.|$|E
