5|$|Hunting {{is often}} {{performed}} alone, but L. colubrina may also {{do so in}} large numbers {{in the company of}} hunting parties of giant <b>trevally</b> and goatfish. This cooperative hunting technique {{is similar to that of}} the moray eel, with the banded sea kraits flushing out prey from narrow crevices and holes, and the <b>trevally</b> and goatfish feeding on fleeing prey.|$|E
5|$|During group interactions, Galapagos {{sharks are}} {{dominant}} to blacktip sharks (C. limbatus) but deferent to silvertip sharks (C. albimarginatus) of equal size. When confronted or cornered, the Galapagos shark may perform a threat display {{similar to that}} of the grey reef shark, in which the shark performs an exaggerated, rolling swimming motion while arching its back, lowering its pectoral fins, puffing out its gills, and gaping its jaw. The shark may also swing its head from side to side, so as to keep the perceived threat within its field of vision. A known parasite of the Galapagos shark is the flatworm Dermophthirius carcharhini, which attaches to the shark's skin. In one account, a bluefin <b>trevally</b> (Caranax melampygus) was seen rubbing against the rough skin of a Galapagos shark to rid itself of parasites.|$|E

25|$|The longnose <b>trevally,</b> Carangoides chrysophrys (also {{known as}} the tea-leaf <b>trevally,</b> club-nosed <b>trevally,</b> {{grunting}} <b>trevally,</b> and dusky <b>trevally),</b> is a species of inshore marine fish in the jack family, Carangidae. The species is distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indian and west Pacific Oceans from South Africa to New Zealand and Japan, inhabiting coastal waters, especially reefs, {{to a depth of}} 90 m. The longnose <b>trevally</b> is distinguished from similar species by a combination of a scaleless breast and the number of gill rakers and fin rays. It is a moderately large fish, growing to a maximum known length of 72cm and 4.35kg. The longnose <b>trevally</b> is a predatory fish, consuming small fish, crustaceans and molluscs. The species is of minor commercial importance throughout its range, and {{is considered to be a}} good table fish.|$|E
25|$|The yellowstripe scad, Selaroides leptolepis, (also {{known as}} the yellowstripe <b>trevally,</b> yellow-banded <b>trevally,</b> smooth-tailed <b>trevally,</b> slender-scaled <b>trevally</b> and slender <b>trevally)</b> is a species of small inshore fish in the jack and horse {{mackerel}} family Carangidae, and {{the only member of}} the genus Selaroides. The yellowstripe <b>trevally</b> is distributed throughout the tropical waters of the Indo-West Pacific region, ranging from the Persian Gulf in the west to Vanuatu and New Caledonia in the east. The species is distinguished by its prominent lateral yellow band, and differs from the scads of the genus Selar in having a smaller eye and different dentition. The yellowstripe scad reaches a maximum recorded length of 22 cm, however is normally encountered at sizes less than 15cm. Phylogenetic studies indicate the yellowstripe scad is closely related to the scads of the genus Selar, although its exact placement in the family Carangidae is less well agreed upon.|$|E
25|$|The coachwhip <b>trevally,</b> Carangoides oblongus (also {{known as}} the oblong <b>trevally</b> and oblique-banded <b>trevally)</b> is a species of inshore marine fish {{classified}} in the jack family Carangidae. The coachwhip <b>trevally</b> is distributed through the Indo-west Pacific region, ranging from South Africa {{in the west to}} Fiji and Japan in the east. It is a moderately large fish, growing to a known maximum length of 46cm and can be distinguished from similar species by an array of detailed morphological features including dentition, fin ray counts and scale patterns. The coachwhip <b>trevally</b> inhabits coastal waters throughout its range, known to prefer estuarine waters in a number of localities. Nothing is known of its diet or reproductive biology, and is of little importance to fisheries, occasionally taken as bycatch in trawl and hook and line fisheries.|$|E

25|$|The bludger is {{classified}} within the genus Carangoides, {{a group of}} fish commonly known as jacks and <b>trevallies.</b> Carangoides falls into the jack and horse mackerel family Carangidae, itself part the order Perciformes, in the suborder Percoidei.|$|R
50|$|The {{threadfin}} jack {{is classified}} within the genus Carangoides, {{one of a}} number of groups of fish referred to as jacks and <b>trevallies.</b> Carangoides is further classified in the family Carangidae, of the suborder Percoidei and the order Perciformes.|$|R
25|$|The blue <b>trevally,</b> Carangoides ferdau, (also {{known as}} the banded <b>trevally,</b> barred <b>trevally,</b> Ferdau’s <b>trevally</b> and Forskaal’s jackfish) is a common, {{widespread}} species of pelagic marine fish classified in the jack family, Carangidae. The blue <b>trevally</b> is distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indo-Pacific and central Pacific regions, ranging from South Africa {{in the west to}} Hawaii in the east. It is a moderately large fish, growing to a recorded maximum length of 70cm, with the number of rays in the second dorsal fin and the colouring serving as diagnostic features of the species. The species inhabits waters to depths of 60 m, generally inhabiting reefs, beaches, lagoons, and areas with sandy substrates. It is a predatory fish, taking other fish, prawns, crabs, and molluscs, and very little is known of the species' reproductive biology. The blue <b>trevally</b> is of varying importance to fisheries throughout its range, with some regions having high catches of the fish. It {{is considered to be a}} gamefish, and is sought after for its excellent eating qualities.|$|E
25|$|The golden <b>trevally</b> is {{commonly}} targeted by both anglers and spearfishermen, {{and is considered}} to be a gamefish. Golden <b>trevally</b> will take a variety of baits and lures and may be caught from both the shore and boats, making it a highly accessible species. Baits commonly employed for golden <b>trevally</b> include prawns and a variety of small fish or cut baits. The fish are known to follow a burley stream right up to the back of a boat, allowing for easy capture on unweighted baits. A variety of lures may be employed when targeting the species, including jigs, poppers, spoons, slices, and minnows, with large minnows trolled around reefs often accounting for larger specimens. The use of saltwater fly fishing to specifically target golden <b>trevally</b> has developed in recent years, especially over shallow, sandy flats. In these cases, a sinking line and leader is employed to not spook the fish in these shallow waters. Once hooked, golden <b>trevally</b> are known for fast runs and hard fights, especially when reef or other structures are present. Golden <b>trevally</b> are considered one of the best members of the <b>trevally</b> family for eating, with bleeding recommended. The fish has slightly translucent, dark-pink flesh while fresh, becoming white and juicy during cooking, although has a tendency to become dry, flaky, and fibrous. A rich, tangy fish flavour is noted.|$|E
25|$|The golden <b>trevally,</b> Gnathanodon speciosus (also {{known as}} the golden kingfish, banded <b>trevally</b> and king <b>trevally),</b> is a species of large marine fish {{classified}} in the jack and horse mackerel family Carangidae, and {{the only member of}} the genus Gnathanodon. The golden <b>trevally</b> is widely distributed throughout the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, ranging from South Africa in the west to Central America in the east, extending to Japan in the north and Australia in the south. The species predominantly occupies inshore waters where it inhabits both reef and sandy substrates. The golden <b>trevally</b> is easily distinguished from its relatives by its fleshy, rubbery lips and unique colouration, which ranges from bright yellow with black bars as a juvenile to a golden-silvery colour as an adult. It is known to grow to 120 cm in length and 15 kg in weight. The golden <b>trevally</b> schools as a juvenile, often closely following larger objects including sharks and jellyfish. The species uses its protractile jaws to suck out prey from the sand or reef, and consumes a variety of fish, crustaceans and molluscs. Spawning aggregations gather at night at different times of the year throughout its range. The golden <b>trevally</b> is a considerable constituent of several Middle Eastern fisheries and being of minor importance to many others, with a worldwide annual catch of 1187 t to 3475 t recorded between 2000 and 2010. The golden <b>trevally</b> is a popular gamefish, taken by bait, lure, fly and also spear throughout its range. Several Asian countries currently farm the fish in caged aquaculture. Due to their brilliant colouration, juveniles are popular in marine aquaria.|$|E
50|$|The Pemba Channel is {{well known}} to be teeming with fish; marlins, tiger sharks, hammerhead sharks, yellowfin tunas, wahoos, giant <b>trevallies</b> and {{barracudas}} {{are some of the}} species found in the area, together with sea turtles, dolphins, dugongs and occasional whales.|$|R
25|$|The {{blue runner}} is {{classified}} within the genus Caranx, {{one of a}} number of groups known as the jacks or <b>trevallies.</b> Caranx itself is part of the larger jack and horse mackerel family Carangidae, a group of percoid fishes in the order Perciformes.|$|R
50|$|Alectis is a genus {{of fish in}} {{the family}} Carangidae {{containing}} three extant species, {{all of which are}} large marine fishes.

25|$|The longfin <b>trevally,</b> Carangoides armatus (also {{known as}} the longfin kingfish, longfin cavalla and armed <b>trevally),</b> is a species of inshore marine fish in the jack family, Carangidae. The species is common in {{tropical}} to subtropical waters of the Indo-Pacific, ranging from South Africa {{in the west to}} Japan in the east, typically inhabiting inshore reefs and bays. The species is easily distinguished by its elongate dorsal and anal fin lobes and filamentous dorsal rays, as well as its scaleless breast. Longfin <b>trevally</b> are pelagic predators, taking a variety of small fish, cephalopods and crustaceans, and reach sexual maturity at around 21cm. The species has a maximum known length of 57cm and weight of 3.5kg. The longfin <b>trevally</b> has a very complex taxonomic history which is closely intertwined with another currently valid species, Carangoides ciliarius, which may yet prove to be synonymous. Longfin <b>trevally</b> are of minor importance to fisheries throughout their range and are considered good table fish, and are occasionally taken by anglers.|$|E
25|$|The cleftbelly <b>trevally</b> (Atropus atropos) (also {{known as}} the cleftbelly kingfish, Kuweh <b>trevally</b> and thin crevalle) is a species of {{tropical}} marine fish of the jack family, Carangidae. The species inhabits coastal waters throughout the Indo-West Pacific region from South Africa {{in the west to}} Japan in the east, often found near the water's surface. The cleftbelly <b>trevally</b> is {{the only member of the}} genus Atropus and is distinguished by a number of anatomical characteristics, with a deep median groove in the belly giving the species its common name. It is not a large fish, growing to a maximum recorded length of 26.5cm. Cleftbelly <b>trevally</b> are predatory fish, taking a variety of small crustaceans and fish. The species is of minor importance to fisheries throughout its range.|$|E
25|$|The bluefin <b>trevally,</b> Caranx melampygus (also {{known as}} the bluefin jack, bluefin kingfish, bluefinned crevalle, blue ulua, omilu and spotted <b>trevally),</b> is a species of large, widely {{distributed}} marine fish classified in the jack family, Carangidae. The bluefin <b>trevally</b> is distributed throughout the tropical waters of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, ranging from Eastern Africa {{in the west to}} Central America in the east, including Japan in the north and Australia in the south. The species grows to a maximum known length of 117cm and a weight of 43.5 kg, however is rare above 80cm. Bluefin <b>trevally</b> are easily recognised by their electric blue fins, tapered snout and numerous blue and black spots on their sides. Juveniles lack these obvious colours, and must be identified by more detailed anatomical features such as fin ray and scute counts. The bluefin <b>trevally</b> inhabits both inshore environments such as bays, lagoons and shallow reefs, as well as deeper offshore reefs, atolls and bomboras. Juveniles prefer shallower, protected waters, even entering estuaries for short periods in some locations.|$|E
50|$|The {{black jack}} is {{classified}} within the genus Caranx, {{one of a}} number of groups known as the jacks or <b>trevallies.</b> Caranx itself is part of the larger jack and horse mackerel family Carangidae, a group of percoid fishes in the order Perciformes.|$|R
50|$|In {{recent years}} many illegal fishing traps {{have been found}} outside the most common dive sites. They have {{contained}} among others <b>trevallies,</b> batfish, barracuda, golden pilot jacks, and triggerfish. Fishing traps seem to be overly abundant around Ko Bon and Ko Tachai.|$|R

25|$|C. ignobilis is most {{commonly}} referred to as the giant <b>trevally</b> (or giant kingfish) due to its large maximum size, with this often abbreviated to simply GT by many anglers. Other names occasionally used include lowly <b>trevally,</b> barrier <b>trevally,</b> yellowfin jack (not to be confused with Hemicaranx leucurus), Forsskål's Indo-Pacific jack fish and Goyan fish. In Hawaii, the species is almost exclusively referred to as ulua, often in conjunction with the prefixes black, white, or giant. Due to its wide distribution, many other names for the species in different languages are also used.|$|E
25|$|Two {{hybridisation}} {{events in}} the species are known from Hawaii; the first with the giant <b>trevally,</b> Caranx ignobilis and the second with the bigeye <b>trevally,</b> Caranx sexfasciatus. Both were initially identified as hybrids by intermediate physical characteristics, and were later confiremed by DNA sequencing. It has been suggested these hybrids resulted from mixed species schooling during spawning periods. It is thought that hybridisation is more likely if one or both parent species is rare in an area, which {{is the case in}} much of the Main Hawaiian Islands, where overfishing has severely depleted all <b>trevally</b> species populations.|$|E
25|$|Bigeye <b>trevally</b> also form schools. They are swift predators who {{patrol the}} reef in hunting packs. When {{they find a}} school of forage fish, such as cardinalfish, they {{surround}} them and herd them close to the reef. This panics the prey fish, and their schooling becomes chaotic, leaving them open to attack by the <b>trevally.</b>|$|E
50|$|The green jack is {{formally}} classified {{within the}} genus Caranx, {{one of a}} number of groups of fish referred to as jacks and <b>trevallies.</b> Caranx is further classified in the family Carangidae, itself part of the suborder Percoidei and the order Perciformes; the perch-like fishes.|$|R

25|$|The African pompano {{is not a}} true pompano of {{the genus}} Trachinotus, but is more closely allied with the fish {{commonly}} called jacks and <b>trevallies.</b> The various common names used for the species generally reflect the juvenile filamentous fins, {{with a number of}} variations on 'threadfin trevally' often used.|$|R
25|$|The {{species is}} {{commonly}} referred to as the 'yellowstripe', 'yellow-banded' or 'gold-banded' scad or <b>trevally</b> in reference to the distinctive yellow strip running {{along the side of the}} species. Other names applied to the species include 'smooth-tailed trevally', 'slender-scaled' or 'thin scaled' <b>trevally</b> or scad and 'slender trevally', with an extensive list of non-English names also used.|$|E
25|$|The Malabar <b>trevally</b> often schools, {{especially}} as juveniles in shallow bays, becoming more solitary as they age.|$|E
