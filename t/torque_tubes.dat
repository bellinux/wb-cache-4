25|$|The UH-1H's dual {{controls}} are conventional for a helicopter and {{consist of a}} single hydraulic system boosting the cyclic stick, collective lever and anti-torque pedals. The collective levers have integral throttles, although these {{are not used to}} control rotor rpm, which is automatically governed, but are used for starting and shutting down the engine. The cyclic and collective control the main rotor pitch through torque tube linkages to the swash plate, while the anti-torque pedals change the pitch of the tail rotor via a tensioned cable arrangement. Some UH-1Hs have been modified to replace the tail rotor control cables with <b>torque</b> <b>tubes</b> similar to the UH-1N Twin Huey.|$|E

2500|$|Westland's design team, {{under the}} new {{leadership}} of W. E. W. [...] "Teddy" [...] Petter (who later designed the English Electric Canberra, Lightning and Folland Gnat) designed an aircraft that employed state-of-the-art technology. The monocoque fuselage was tubular, with a T-tail at the end, although as originally conceived, the design featured a twin tail, which was discarded when large Fowler flaps were added that caused large areas of turbulence over the tail unit. The elevator was moved {{up out of the}} way of the disturbed airflow caused when the flaps were down. Handley Page slats were fitted to the outer wings and to the leading edge of the radiator openings; these were interconnected by duraluminium <b>torque</b> <b>tubes.</b> In June 1941, the slats were wired shut on the recommendation of the Chief Investigator of the Accident Investigation Branch, after two Whirlwinds crashed when the outer slats failed during hard man≈ìuvering; tests by the A confirmed that the Whirlwind's take-off and landing was largely unaffected with the slats locked shut, while the flight characteristics improved under the conditions in which the slats normally deployed.|$|E

50|$|The {{airframe}} of the C2 {{was virtually}} {{identical to the}} model C1.

50|$|The Woodwind is a two-seat {{side-by-side}} configuration, strut-braced, high-wing aircraft {{with conventional}} landing gear and Plexiglas doors.

5000|$|Examples of the <b>torque</b> <b>tube</b> {{were the}} American cars of the Ford brand up through 1948, {{including}} over 19,000,000 Model Ts.

5000|$|The Excalibur was {{designed}} as [...] "clone" [...] of the Quad City Challenger II aircraft. The company took the basic Challenger design and incorporated many changes, including mounting the engine upright allowing larger propellers and the Rotax gearbox to be mounted, lengthening the tailboom and enlarging the tail vertical surface to increase stability, shortening the ailerons and replacing control cables with <b>torque</b> <b>tubes.</b> The optional Dacron covering on the Challenger was replaced with Superflite standard aircraft fabric, the fuselage was lengthened to give more backseat room and the nosecone was reduced in size to provide better over-the-nose visibility. The design was also streamlined to reduce drag and round cross-section wing struts were replaced with aerodynamic extrusions. The Challenger's rigid landing gear was replaced with a bungee-suspended system.|$|E

50|$|The Crosley Moonbeam {{was built}} in Sharonville, Ohio and was first flown on December 8, 1929. It was {{designed}} by Harold D. Hoekstra, who was employed by Powel Crosley Jr., President of the Crosley Aircraft Company. Mr. Hoeskstra later became Chief of Engineering and Design for the F.A.A. Unique features of this aircraft are the square tube longerons used in the fuselage construction, use of <b>torque</b> <b>tubes</b> instead of control cable, and the corrugated aluminum ailerons. Original power was supplied by a four-cylinder inverted inline 90 hp Crosley engine. At one time it was also tested with a 110 Warner Scarab engine. N147N reportedly was the first airplane on which the spoilers were tested (in May, 1930) as a lateral control device. Five ‚ÄúMoonbeams‚Äù were produced. The first was a three-place parasol; next, a four-place, high wing cabin model; third and fourth were one place high wings. Due to the Great Depression, planned production did not take place. N147N (shown here) {{is the last of}} these planes in existence. It is housed at the Aviation Museum of Kentucky, Lexington Kentucky.|$|E

5000|$|The Nieuport 28 design {{advanced}} {{the concept of}} the lightly built, highly maneuverable rotary engined fighter typified by the Nieuport 17 to the more demanding conditions of the times. It had a more powerful engine, twin machine guns, and a new wing structure - for the first time, a production Nieuport fighter was fitted with conventional two-spar wings, top and bottom, in place of the sesquiplane [...] "v-strut" [...] layout of earlier Nieuports. Ailerons, controlled with <b>torque</b> <b>tubes</b> were fitted to the lower wings only. The design of the tail unit closely followed that of the Nieuport 27, but in order to provide a more streamlined profile, the fuselage was longer and slimmer, so narrow that its twin Vickers machine guns were offset to port, one between the cabane struts and one just outboard of them. Several prototypes were built - testing three different dihedral settings for the top wing, including a completely flat wing, and one with marked dihedral that rested very close {{to the top of the}} front fuselage. Production machines had an intermediate configuration, with a slight dihedral in the upper wing, taller cabane struts, and room for the second machine gun to be mounted under the center section.|$|E
