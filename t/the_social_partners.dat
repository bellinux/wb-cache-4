40|$|The {{field of}} animal {{personality}} {{is interested in}} decomposing behaviors into different levels of variation, with its present focus on the ecological and evolutionary causes and consequences of expressed variation. Recently the role of <b>the</b> <b>social</b> environment, i. e. <b>social</b> <b>partners,</b> has been suggested to affect behavioral variation and induce selection on animal personality. <b>Social</b> <b>partner</b> effects exist because characters of <b>social</b> <b>partners</b> (e. g. size, behavior), affect the behavioral expression of a focal individual. Here, we 1) first review the proximate mechanisms underlying <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>partner</b> effects on behavioral expression and the timescales at which such effects might take place. We then 2) discuss how within- and among-individual variation in single behaviors and covariation between multiple behaviors, caused by <b>social</b> <b>partners,</b> can carry-over to non-social behaviors expressed outside <b>the</b> <b>social</b> context. Finally, we 3) highlight evolutionary consequences of social carry-over effects to non-social behaviors and 4) suggest study designs and statistical approaches which {{can be applied to}} study the nature and evolutionary consequences of social carry-over effects on non-social behaviors. Understanding the proximate mechanisms underpinning <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>partner</b> effects is important since it opens a door for deeper understanding of how social environments can affect behavioral variation and covariation at multiple levels, and the evolution of non-social behaviors (i. e. exploration, activity, boldness) that are affected by social interactions...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} simple, biologically-inspired {{mechanism}} by which synthetic entities {{can be made to}} form social relationships with each other. We describe an interactive multi-agent system, based on <b>the</b> <b>social</b> behavior of <b>the</b> gray wolf (Canis lupus), that features this mechanism of social relationship formation. This installation, shown at SIGGRAPH 2001, allowed several participants to direct semi-autonomous wolf pups in a virtual pack. In our mechanism, an entity has an emotional state that is affected by its interactions. It is able to recognize a <b>social</b> <b>partner</b> as <b>the</b> same individual on successive encounters. It learns an association between interacting with that <b>social</b> <b>partner</b> and its own current emotional state [...] an "emotional memory" of the partner. When the entity again encounters <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>partner,</b> its emotional memory of that partner influences its current emotional state. The emotional state, in turn, affects its expressive range of behavior. Finally, in the wake of each interaction, the entity revises its model of its emotional relationship with <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>partner.</b> Our mechanism for social relationship formation could be of use in a variety of domains, for example, creating believable virtual characters, building multi-agent systems, and designing human-computer interfaces...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to account for the revival of both {{academic}} and substantive interest in what had long been seen as an unimportant byway of <b>social</b> policy: <b>the</b> role of <b>social</b> <b>partners,</b> especially trade unions, in the management of national <b>social</b> insurance systems. <b>The</b> answer is found in the budgetary crises facing these systems along with the frequent embedded role of <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>partner</b> organizations in their governance. Meanwhile, this welfare state role of trade unions then has implications back on to the conduct of industrial relations. The diversity of national experiences is considered, including the reasons for British exceptionalism on this question.

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{have shown that}} children with autism would increase in social responsiveness after being imitated by an adult, regardless whether the adult was a stranger or the child’s caregiver (Nadel et al, 2000; Escalona et al., 2002; Field et al., 2001; Heimann et al., 2006; Sanefuji, Yamashita & Ohgami, 2009; Sanefuji & Ohgami, 2011). Although no direct comparison has been made between the familiar and unfamiliar adult’s imitation effect on children with autism, existing literature has provided evidence suggesting that children with autism tend to preferentially display social behaviors towards their caregiver than to an unfamiliar person (Kasari, Sigman, Yirmiya, 1993; Kasari & Sigman, 1997). With that, the present study aimed to examine whether familiarity with <b>the</b> imitating <b>social</b> <b>partner</b> would induce a differential social responsiveness from children with autism after being imitated. A modified version of Nadel et. al (2000) ’s still face paradigm served as the basic procedure for the two conditions in the study - <b>the</b> familiar <b>social</b> <b>partner</b> condition (caregiver) and <b>the</b> unfamiliar <b>social</b> <b>partner</b> condition (experimenter). A total of 9 children with autism took part in both conditions in a repeated measures design. It was found that children with autism showed an increase in their proximity behaviors and also engaged in less solitary play after being imitated by their parent, but not after being imitated by the unfamiliar experimenter. The study highlighted the importance of familiarity with <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>partner</b> for children with autism in an imitative context and further discussed how this familiarity factor comes into play in a domestic and clinical setting...|$|R

In this work, {{we take a}} broader view of social learning and {{are interested in the}} multifaceted ways that a <b>social</b> <b>partner</b> can influence <b>the</b> learning process. We implement stimulus enhancement and emulation on a robot, and illustrate the computational benefits of social learning over individual learning. Additionally we characterize the differences between these two social learning strategies, showing that the preferred strategy is dependent on the current behavior of <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>partner.</b> We demonstrate these learning results both in simulation and with physical robot ‘playmates’.

40|$|The High Quality Communication {{intervention}} aims {{to stimulate}} interpersonal communication between individuals with congenital deaf-blindness (CDB) and their <b>social</b> <b>partners.</b> Found effective in multiple-case experiments, the intervention {{is based on}} Trevarthen's theory of inter-subjective development (Bråten & Trevarthen, 2007), which describes children's innate and developing ability to share subjective states in interpersonal communication and social partners' mediating role in this development. One implication of this theory is that <b>social</b> <b>partners</b> can support <b>the</b> emergence of higher-complexity communication behaviors in individuals who are still developing these behaviors. To test this proposition, communication patterns between individuals with CDB and their parents, teachers, and professional caregivers were analyzed. Analysis of two-event sequences of communicative behaviors showed a highly significant correspondence between the behavior of <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>partner</b> and <b>the</b> subsequent behavior of the individual with CDB, confirming that <b>social</b> <b>partners</b> can scaffold higher-complexity communication within interpersonal communication...|$|R
