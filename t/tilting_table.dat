5000|$|Congreve {{appears to}} have been unaware that rolling ball clocks had been invented earlier by both Nicolas Grollier de Servière and Johann Sayller. Congreve's version {{differed}} from Grollier's rolling ball clock in that the ball travelled down a zig-zag rather than straight path. While Sayller's version had also used a zig-zag path, it had utilized a number of balls and a fixed table rather than the single ball and <b>tilting</b> <b>table</b> employed by Congreve. The [...] "Extreme Detached Escapement" [...] (as Congreve referred to his escapement design) was patented in 1808. Congreve, who was not a clock maker, hired Gravel and Tolkien to produce the first working version, which he then presented to the Prince of Wales in 1808. This version was weight-driven, but the second design, which {{appears to have}} been constructed by John Moxon, was spring-driven. The second model is in the collection of Buckingham Palace.|$|E

The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the use of <b>tilt</b> <b>tables</b> in physiotherapy management of patients in ICUs across Australia. Ninety-nine physiotherapists working in Australian public ICUs were contacted via mail and asked to complete a questionnaire regarding their use of <b>tilt</b> <b>tables</b> in practice. Reasons for the use of the <b>tilt</b> <b>table,</b> contraindications, commonly used adjuncts, monitoring, and outcome measures were also investigated. Eighty-six questionnaires were returned (87 % response). The <b>tilt</b> <b>table</b> was used by 58 physiotherapists (67. 4 %). The most common reasons for inclusion of <b>tilt</b> <b>table</b> treatment were to: facilitate weight bearing (94. 8 % of those who tilt); prevent muscle contractures (86 %); improve lower limb strength (81 %); and increase arousal (70 %). The <b>tilt</b> <b>table</b> was most frequently applied to patients with neurological conditions (63. 8 %) and during long-term ICU stay (43. 1 %).

40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESThis {{study was}} {{conducted}} to develop a time-efficient <b>tilt</b> <b>table</b> test. BACKGROUNDCurrent protocols of <b>tilt</b> <b>table</b> testing are quite time-consuming. This study was designed to assess the diagnostic value, tolerance and procedural time of a single-stage isoproterenol <b>tilt</b> <b>table</b> protocol. METHODSA single-stage isoproterenol <b>tilt</b> <b>table</b> test was compared with the passive <b>tilt</b> <b>table</b> test. The study was prospectively designed in a randomized and crossover fashion. RESULTSThe study population consisted of 111 patients with a history of syncope (mean age 55 ± 20 years). Of the total, 62 patients (56 %; 95 % confidence interval, 46 % to 65 %) had a positive vasovagal response during isoproterenol <b>tilt</b> <b>table</b> testing and 35 (32 %; 23 % to 41 %) during passive <b>tilt</b> <b>table</b> testing (p = 0. 002). The mean procedural times of the study population were 11. 7 ± 3. 6 min and 36. 9 ± 13. 3 min for isoproterenol and passive <b>tilt</b> <b>table</b> testing, respectively (p < 0. 001). All patients tolerated single-stage isoproterenol testing. In the 23 control subjects (mean age 34 ± 11 years), the apparent specificities were 91 % (72 % to 99 %) and 83 % (61 % to 99 %) for passive and single-stage <b>tilt</b> <b>table</b> testing, respectively. CONCLUSIONSThe single-stage isoproterenol <b>tilt</b> <b>table</b> test was more effective in inducing a positive vasovagal response in an adult population than the standard passive <b>tilt</b> <b>table</b> test, and it significantly reduced the procedural time. The increase in positive yield was associated with a moderate decrease in apparent specificity. These observations support the conclusion that single-stage <b>tilt</b> <b>table</b> testing could be a reasonable diagnostic option in patients undergoing syncope evaluation...|$|R

40|$|Effect of {{tilting angle}} on the {{dynamics}} of <b>tilting</b> <b>table</b> driven by worm and worm wheel Wenming Wei, Jun Zhang, Dun Lu and Wanhua Zhao The dynamics of <b>tilting</b> <b>table</b> behaves differently during five-axis machining due to the constant changes {{of the position of}} its center of mass which leads to different forces acting on parts of the transmission system. In this research, the lumped parameter method is used to model {{the dynamics of}} <b>tilting</b> <b>table</b> driven by worm and worm wheel in the tilting direction, where the varying stiffness of the transmission system at different tilting angles is considered. The impact testing experiments of <b>tilting</b> <b>table</b> system with tilting angles from 0 to 90 are also performed to verify the analytical model. The results from sensitivity analysis show that the three stiffnesses have a great effect on the variation of system natural frequency in the tilting direction, including the equivalent tangential meshing stiffness of worm and worm wheel, the torsional stiffness of worm wheel shaft, and the axial stiffness of worm supporting bearings. Moreover, the variations of system natural frequency with the three stiffnesses at different tilting angles are further investigated...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background One {{problem in}} the {{mobilization}} of patients with neurological diseases, such as spinal cord injury, is the circulatory collapse that occurs while changing from supine to vertical position because of the missing venous pump due to paralyzed leg muscles. Therefore, a <b>tilt</b> <b>table</b> with integrated stepping device (tilt stepper) was developed, which allows passive stepping movements for performing locomotion training in an early state of rehabilitation. The aim of this pilot {{study was to investigate}} if passive stepping and cycling movements of the legs during <b>tilt</b> <b>table</b> training could stabilize blood circulation and prevent neurally-mediated syncope in healthy young adults. Methods In the first experiment, healthy subjects were tested on a traditional <b>tilt</b> <b>table.</b> Subjects who had a syncope or near-syncope in this condition underwent a second trial on the tilt stepper. In the second experiment, a group of healthy subjects was investigated on a traditional <b>tilt</b> <b>table,</b> the second group on the tilt ergometer, a device that allows cycling movements during <b>tilt</b> <b>table</b> training. We used the chi-square test to compare the occurrence of near-syncope/syncope in both groups (tilt table/tilt stepper and tilt table/tilt ergometer) and ANOVA to compare the blood pressure and heart rate between the groups at the four time intervals (supine, at 2 minutes, at 6 minutes and end of head-up tilt). Results Separate chi-square tests performed for each experiment showed significant differences in the occurrence of near syncope or syncope based on the device used. Comparison of the two groups (<b>tilt</b> stepper/ <b>tilt</b> <b>table)</b> in experiment one (ANOVA) showed that blood pressure was significantly higher at the end of head-up tilt on the tilt stepper and on the <b>tilt</b> <b>table</b> there was a greater increase in heart rate (2 minutes after head-up tilt). Comparison of the two groups (<b>tilt</b> ergometer/tilt <b>table)</b> in experiment 2 (ANOVA) showed that blood pressure was significantly higher on the tilt ergometer at the end of head-up tilt and on the <b>tilt</b> <b>table</b> the increase in heart rate was significantly larger (at 6 min and end of head-up tilt). Conclusions Stabilization of blood circulation and prevention of benign syncope can be achieved by passive leg movement during a <b>tilt</b> <b>table</b> test in healthy adults. </p...|$|R

40|$|Sliding of rock masses along penetrative {{discontinuities}} cam be simulated by rock blocks slide along inclined planes. Shearing strengths along penetrative discontinuities {{are determined}} by friction and cohesion along the sliding planes. Determination of friction angles of rocks and discontinuities is essential for evaluation of stability of rock slopes. The use of direct shear boxes requires careful transport of specimens from the field, cutting rocks to specified shapes, lapping rock surfaces if necessary and spending {{at least a day}} to test a sample. Since Hoek and Brary (1974) first suggested that the angle of friction could be obtained from a simple tilt test when a clearly defined failure surface existed, friction angles of artificial rock surfaces and natural discontinuities have been tested by Cawsey and Farrar (1976), Barton and Choubey (1977), Bruce et al (1988) and Cruden and Hu (1988). Hencher (1976) discussed advantages and limitations of tilting tables. Testing rocks in the laboratory using a <b>tilting</b> <b>table</b> requires transportation of rock samples from the field and, generally, cutting of rock samples in the laboratory. Only a limited number of rock samples can be tested if the working site is far from a highway. Rock samples may be broken when they are sawn.

We sent a questionnaire {{to members of the}} Pediatric and Congenital Electrophysiology Society to assess the current practice pattern. Of the 186 members, 97 (52 %) replied. Twenty four percent of the pediatric electrophysiologists have completely stopped doing <b>tilt</b> <b>table</b> tests and of those performing the tests, a majority (76 %) did < 10 tests/yr (median= 3 tilts/yr, range 0 - 100 /yr).

Difficulties when using extremely high magnifications will be stated and means of solutions are presented and evaluated. Since the scanning electron microscope cannot be moved around the object, the object has to be tilted instead. By this movement, the object {{can be seen in}} several virtual points of view, which is a necessity for any three dimensional reconstruction. As for generating the virtual views, the first difficulty encountered is to position the sample into the eucentric axis. Only when positioned in the rotation axis, the sample remains within the field of view, instead of being moved outside. Therefore, a special <b>tilting</b> <b>table</b> was required, which provided maximum precision and accuracy. Furthermore, an object had to be found, which met the requirements of a calibration object. Here, a new microscopic cascade pyramid was developed, supplied with 38 spatially distributed control points. Finally, for each tilting series, all desired images were oriented using a bundle block adjustment following the rules of parallel projection. In this paper, the mathematics of parallel projection will be an important chapter, pointing out the differences to central projection. As a result, the accuracy of the <b>tilting</b> <b>table</b> and the imaging properties of the microscope are presented.
