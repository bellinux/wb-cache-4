30|$|Mycobacterium leprae is the causative {{agent of}} leprosy, an ancient chronic {{infectious}} disease {{and may have}} severely debilitating physical, social, and psychological consequences. The skin, the peripheral nerves, the nasal mucosa, eyes, and the reticulum-endothelial system are the preferred target sites for this pathogen. The disease displays a spectrum of clinical manifestations, such as lepromatous (multibacillar) and <b>tuberculoid</b> (paucibacillar) <b>leprosy,</b> which are attributed to the host immune response. It still remains a stigmatizing disease (Nascimento 2013; Degang et al. 2014).

40|$|A {{sensitive}} specific radioimmunoassay {{was developed}} to measure antibodies against BCG antigen 60, a prominent antigenic component of BCG bacilli which cross-reacts with similar components in many mycobacterial species including Mycobacterium leprae and M tuberculosis. A lepromatous serum pool had anti-BCG- 60 activity with a titre of 10 (5) and the tuberculoid pool a titre of 10 (4). Testing of individual sera showed striking variations within groups of patients with lepromatous and <b>tuberculoid</b> <b>leprosy.</b> In five of the 20 <b>tuberculoid</b> <b>leprosy</b> sera the anti-BCG- 60 activity was above the median for the lepromatous group. The current view that antibody formation against mycobacterial antigens is very low in <b>tuberculoid</b> <b>leprosy</b> thus no longer appears to be tenable.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the evidence for}} and against {{the view that the}} spectrum of pathological changes in leprosy, extending from the lepromatous form to the tuberculoid form, may be caused by differences in the immune responses of patients. Patients with the <b>tuberculoid</b> form of <b>leprosy</b> generally have well-developed specific cell-mediated immunity, but in a large proportion of patients with lepromatous leprosy the specific cell-mediated immunity to Mycobacterium leprae and sometimes to other antigens seems to be deficient, whereas the circulating antibody response is well-developed.

40|$|Background: Pure neuritic leprosy (PNL) usually {{presents}} with neurological symptoms without skin involvement. Fine needle aspiration {{can play}} an important role in the management of PNL cases presenting as nerve abscesses. Aim: To assess the role of fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) in diagnosing and categorizing PNL cases presenting as nerve abscesses in the absence of neurological symptoms. Materials and Methods: Five patients with subcutaneous nerve related swellings without clinically evident neurological deficits were subjected to FNAC. As the cytological features were suggestive of nerve abscesses due to leprosy, Fite stain was performed in all cases. As none of the patients had any leprosy skin lesions, they were diagnosed as cases of PNL. Features like cellularity, caseous necrosis, presence or absence of lymphocytes, macrophages, epithelioid cells, granulomas, Langhans giant cells and nerve elements were analyzed with the bacteriological index, to categorize PNL according to the Ridley-Jopling classification. Results: Based on the cytological features and bacteriological indices, 3 cases were cytologically categorized into tuberculoid (TT) /borderline <b>tuberculoid</b> (BT) <b>leprosy</b> and the other two, as BT/borderline lepromatous (BL) and BL leprosy respectively in spite of having similar clinical presentation. Based on the cytological diagnoses, category-specific treatment could be instituted with clinical improvement. Conclusions: The simple and minimally invasive FNAC procedure allows diagnosis and a reasonably accurate categorization of PNL presenting as nerve abscess and therefore, highly useful in its clinical management...|$|R
40|$|The sera of 187 {{patients}} {{from across the}} leprosy spectrum were screened {{for the expression of}} the PR 4 idiotype, which was first identified on a human hybridoma-derived monoclonal antibody from a patient with leprosy and found to react with the Mycobacterium leprae phenolic glycolipid and a variety of polynucleotides. Sixty per cent (51 out of 85) of patients with lepromatous leprosy (LL), 66 % (33 out of 49) with borderline lepromatous (BL) disease, 47 % (14 out of 30) with borderline <b>tuberculoid</b> (BT) <b>leprosy,</b> and 56 % (13 out of 23) of tuberculoid (TT) patients were found to have significantly elevated titres of the PR 4 idiotype in their sera compared with endemic controls, irrespective of {{the presence or absence of}} endemic malaria. Sera from 52 patients with tuberculosis were also screened as a control for mycobacterial infection. The PR 4 idiotype was significantly elevated in 37 % (19 out of 52) of these patients. No correlation between idiotype and serum immunoglobulins IgG and IgM was found, indicating that the concentrations of idiotype levels in sera were not merely a reflection of changes in serum immunoglobulin levels. It is hypothesized that the expression of the PR 4 idiotype is due to certain germline genes preferentially expressed rather than being the result of polyclonal B cell activation...|$|R
40|$|Granuloma multiforme (GM) is a {{reactive}} {{skin disorder}} of unknown etiology, characterized clinically by confluent annular lesions and histologically by focal necrobiosis and histiocytic granulomas.

It was also found that (1) the number of carriers was higher among patients staying longer in hospital; (2) titres of antigen in patients with lepromatous leprosy were higher than in those with <b>tuberculoid</b> <b>leprosy</b> or in controls; and (3) antigen titres measured twice at an interval of 4 months indicated that the carrying of hepatitis B antigen in patients with leprosy is stable and persistent...|$|E
40|$|Case 1 : A 43 year-old, {{white man}} {{presented}} with a four month-history of six plaques well-circumscribed. Laboratory results, including several serological tests, {{as well as a}} radiological investigation, were either negative or normal. The Mitsuda reaction was positive (9 mm). He was put on prednisone therapy and multi-drug therapy (MDT) with subsequent healing of the cutaneous lesions and improvement of the neuritis in about six months. The diagnostic hypothesis was reactional <b>tuberculoid</b> <b>leprosy</b> (Figure 1). Case 2 : A 23 year-old, mulatto man with a two-year history of prednisone treatment for bouts of nodules appearing over a macula who had been on treatment for <b>tuberculoid</b> <b>leprosy</b> with MDT-PB. Laboratory data, which included a search for other infectious diseases (HIV, HTLV- 1 and 2, hepatitis B and C, syphilis, tuberculosis, and chest X-ray) was normal/negative. However his tuberculosis skin test (PPD) was strongly positive (30 mm), and the Mitsuda reaction was also positive (7 mm). A biopsy revealed a chronic granulomatous dermatitis with caseous necrosis. Although a search for M. tuberculosis was negative by immune-histochemistry and PCR, he received conventional anti-TB therapy, with improvement of the nodules and the infiltrative lesions. Hypotheses: <b>Tuberculoid</b> <b>leprosy</b> in one reaction with caseous necrosis or Tuberculosis and <b>Tuberculoid</b> <b>leprosy?</b> Discussion: Various infectious/inflammatory diseases are associated with necrosis [1 - 3]. Caseous lesions are frequently seen in tuberculosis but are rare in leprosy granulomas [4]. In case 1, the corticotherapy may have accelerated the healing of the ulcers and limited the fibrinoid necrosis, avoiding the deleterious effects of exacerbated host cell-mediated immunity [5]. In case 2, the two-year persisting caseous necrosis could have been due to a reinfection partially controlled by rifampicine. The strongly...|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} {{which can be}} used to quantitate class II MHC antigens (HLA-DR) expressed by cells within tissue sections. A mouse anti-human HLA-DR monoclonal antibody is directly conjugated to the fungal enzyme glucose oxidase.

The coloured reaction product is proportional to the amount of antigen and can be eluted from cells and measured spectrophotometrically. The application of this technique to a study of the expression of HLA-DR antigens, functionally significant molecules, by mononuclear cells in the cutaneous lesions of leprosy, is described.

50|$|The {{incubation}} period of M. leprae can range between nine months and twenty years. It replicates intracellularly inside histiocytes and nerve cells {{and has two}} forms. One form is tuberculoid, which induces a cell-mediated response that limits its growth.

The microbe then induces T-helper lymphocytes, epitheloid cells, and giant cell infiltration of the skin, causing infected individuals to exhibit large flattened patches with raised and elevated red edges on their skin. These patches have dry, pale, hairless centers, accompanied by a loss of sensation on the skin. The loss of sensation may develop as a result of invasion of the peripheral sensory nerves.
