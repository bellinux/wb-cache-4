5|$|The DS {{version of}} the game, which was {{significantly}} different from the other versions, received praise for its unique gameplay, but criticism for its short length. IGN lauded the DS version's unique gameplay experience and GameSpot proclaimed that it was satisfying from start to finish. GameSpot and GameZone, however, were both disappointed that the game was extremely brief. 1UP found that even though The Simpsons Game parodied numerous 2D platform game conventions, it used <b>them</b> <b>anyway,</b> making it a pointless endeavor.|$|E
5|$|The affair {{apparently}} over, the Dude and his bowling teammates {{return to}} the bowling alley. As they leave, they are confronted {{in the parking lot}} by the nihilists, who have set the Dude's car on fire. They, once again, demand the ransom money. Even after the Dude and Walter explain they don't have the money, the nihilists try to rob <b>them</b> <b>anyway.</b> Walter violently beats all three, biting the ear off of one. However, in the excitement, Donny suffers a fatal heart attack.|$|E
5|$|After {{arriving}} in Turkey {{he met with}} Skene, the British Vice-Consul, who had him introduced to Omar Pasha and invited to view the Turkish regiments. Nolan was not particularly impressed by them, judging the irregulars incapable of withstanding a Russian cavalry charge and finding the horses too small. He ordered 250 of <b>them</b> <b>anyway,</b> finding them appropriate for the British artillery {{if not for the}} cavalry. His report to Somerset (now Baron Raglan, and commander of the British forces in Turkey) included a proposal for a trip to Syria, where he claimed the horses were more appropriate. This proposal was eventually agreed to, and he went to İskenderun on 9 May. When they arrived they discovered that Turkish officials had already bought most of the army horses in northern Syria, and so they continued on to Beirut and then Damascus. Even there, they failed to find horses of sufficient quality, and so they left the city on 21 May in hopes of making contact with the Bedouin. They left with a train of 292 horses, mostly bought from the 'Anizzah, and were met at Beirut by the steamship Trent and transported back to Turkey.|$|E

25|$|Harold and Red {{spend much}} of their time on the show trading insults and poking fun at each other. While they have shown they can {{cooperate}} with one another at times, Harold is often very critical of Red's ideas and schemes, but usually ends up going along with <b>them</b> <b>anyway.</b>|$|E
25|$|In January 1911, the Westmoreland County sheriff began deputizing {{striking}} miners {{as deputy}} sheriffs (although they served without pay). In May 1911, four sheriff's deputies were cited for {{contempt of court}} for venturing too close to coal company property. The sheriff said that the men had done so in their official capacity as deputies, but the local court fined <b>them</b> <b>anyway.</b> The Westmoreland County sheriff became so frustrated with the injunction that he refused to permit his deputies to patrol marches on public highways.|$|E
25|$|Weller {{accepted}} {{money from}} two convicted associates of former congressman Duke Cunningham. Weller's spokesman {{said that the}} donations probably originated from his support of {{the research and development}} tax credit and the money was donated to a charity in Oregon. Weller and 11 other congressmen were subpoenaed to testify in the trial of Brent R. Wilkes, the contractor accused of bribing Cunningham. The subpoenas were withdrawn by defense attorneys on October 3, 2007 when it became apparent the trial judge would quash <b>them</b> <b>anyway.</b> Weller and the other 11 did not testify in the trial.|$|E

25|$|By {{the late}} 1980s the {{neighborhood}} had changed. Another Register-listed property nearby, the Abrams Building, had been demolished {{to clear the}} way for a new arena, now known as the Times Union Center. In 1988 plans for two large office towers at the corner of South Pearl and Hudson were approved by the city. While the two garages did not overlap the new buildings' footprint, it was necessary to demolish <b>them</b> <b>anyway</b> to provide enough parking. That was accomplished in early 1989; they were delisted a month later.|$|E
25|$|Although {{the idea}} of working with {{resistance}} is essentially a hypnotic one, it goes beyond hypnosis and trance. In a typical example, a girl that bit her nails was told that she was cheating herself of really enjoying the nail biting. He encouraged her to let some of her nails grow a little longer before biting them, so that she really could derive the fullest pleasure from the activity. She decided to grow all of her nails long enough that she might really enjoy biting them, and then, after some days, she realised that she didn't want to bite <b>them</b> <b>anyway.</b>|$|E
25|$|Under the {{captaincy}} of Lynagh {{and with}} David Campese in vintage form, Australia beat New Zealand 13-12 {{in the final}} of the 1988 Hong Kong Sevens. When Lynagh received the silver symbol of sevens supremacy from Hong Long bank taipan Williams Purves, the Royal Hong Kong Police bank struck up ‘Waltzing Matilda’, but they might have stopped the drums and trumpets after a few bars. No one heard <b>them</b> <b>anyway</b> as all but the most rabid anti-Australians in the twenty-thousand-strong throng took up the singing. It was stirring stuff. In the Australian on 28 March Dwyer used the occasion to proclaim {{the start of a new}} era in Australian rugby.|$|E

25|$|Hazumu's parents, {{her father}} , {{and her mother}} , are almost always shown {{together}} throughout the series. When Hazumu goes missing after getting rejected from Yasuna, both of Hazumu's parents are completely distraught, and {{do not know what}} to do. After Hazumu's transformation, both parents become overjoyed to have a daughter in place of a son which is shown through their eccentricities. Toru works as a magazine photographer and loves to take pictures of Hazumu any chance he gets; often this is after his wife has already dressed Hazumu in some feminine garment. Additionally, Hazumu's father repeatedly attempts to take a bath with Hazumu, but is always stopped by his wife. Kahoru loves to buy feminine clothes for Hazumu to wear, and buys these clothes without consulting Hazumu herself, though regardless she finds herself wearing <b>them</b> <b>anyway.</b> Directly after Hazumu turned into a girl, her mother even goes ahead and buys her a female school uniform to wear from now on. Hazumu becomes annoyed by her parents' new behavior toward her, and finds trying on her new clothes very tiring. When Hazumu bakes cookies for the first time, Kahoru loves it, but Toru simply wolfs down most of the cookies for himself. Since his mother had always wanted a daughter instead of son, she often dressed Hazumu up in young girl's clothes, saying that gender discrimination is not a good thing.|$|E

500|$|Clark {{set about}} arming the {{resistance}} and training them in methods of warfare. He had {{been instructed to}} avoid arming the communists where possible, his superiors fearing for their actions after the war, but finding the communists {{to be the most}} organised and well-motivated group in his area proceeded to arm <b>them</b> <b>anyway.</b> He arranged an air drop of arms and explosives, and led the partisans on several railway sabotage expeditions. Clark later recalled that [...] "blowing up railway engines was very great fun". For his work with the partisans he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, the third-highest award for gallantry in the Royal Navy. Clark was betrayed and captured by a German patrol in December 1944 whilst trying to hide in a haystack with four partisans.|$|E

Kurt later eavesdrops on the directors and hears them question whether he is masculine enough for the role. He re-auditions and attempts to give a more masculine performance, but {{they are unable to}} suppress laughter at his acting. Kurt is also running for class president, and accepts campaign help from Brittany (Heather Morris), who wants to highlight his unique character by comparing him to a unicorn. Kurt feels her proposed campaign materials highlight only his gay side, and is upset when she goes against his wishes and posts <b>them</b> <b>anyway.</b> He discusses his image problem with his father, Burt (Mike O'Malley), who recommends that he embrace his uniqueness. Kurt later changes his mind about his campaign's approach and apologizes to Brittany, but is surprised to learn that she too has decided to run for class president.|$|E
