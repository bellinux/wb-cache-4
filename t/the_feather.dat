5|$|State Route 70 (SR 70) is a {{state highway}} in the U.S. state of California. Connecting Sacramento with U.S. Route 395 (US 395) near Beckwourth Pass (lowest in the Sierra Nevada) via <b>the</b> <b>Feather</b> River Canyon. Through <b>the</b> <b>Feather</b> River Canyon, from SR 149 to US 395, SR 70 is <b>the</b> <b>Feather</b> River Scenic Byway, a Forest Service Byway that {{parallels}} the ex-Western Pacific Railroad's Feather River Route.|$|E
5|$|Red-billed choughs {{can also}} carry mites, but {{a study of}} <b>the</b> <b>feather</b> mite Gabucinia delibata, {{acquired}} by young birds {{a few months after}} fledging when they join communal roosts, suggested that this parasite actually improved the body condition of its host. It is possible that <b>the</b> <b>feather</b> mites enhance feather cleaning and deter pathogens, and may complement other feather care measures such as sunbathing, and anting—rubbing the plumage with ants (the formic acid from the insects deters parasites).|$|E
5|$|In 1951, California State Engineer A.D. Edmonston {{proposed}} <b>the</b> <b>Feather</b> River Project, {{the direct}} predecessor to the SWP, {{which included a}} major dam on <b>the</b> <b>Feather</b> River at Oroville, and aqueducts and pumping plants to transfer stored water to destinations in central and southern California. The proposed project was strongly opposed by voters in Northern California and parts of Southern California that received water from the Colorado River, but was supported by other Southern Californians and San Joaquin Valley farmers. However, major flooding in the 1950s prompted the 1957 passage of an emergency flood-control bill that provided sufficient funding for construction for a dam at Oroville – {{regardless of whether it}} would become part of the SWP.|$|E

5|$|In many of {{the legends}} of the Cascade Mountains, there are thunderbirds that live on them and Adams is no exception. This {{particular}} thunderbird was named Enumtla and he terrorized {{the inhabitants of the}} land. Speelyi, the Klickitat coyote god, came along one day and they implored him to do something. Speelyi transformed himself into a feather and waited. It did not take long for Enumtla to see <b>the</b> <b>feather</b> and investigate. Being suspicious, he thundered at <b>the</b> <b>feather</b> with no effect. He paused and suddenly the magic feather let loose a terrific volley of thunder and lightning and stunned Enumtla. Speelyi then managed to overpower Enumtla and decreed that the thunderbird could no longer terrify the people, could only thunder on hot days, and could not destroy with lightning.|$|E

5|$|The Western Pacific Railroad {{completed}} its main line into California in 1909. This followed the old Beckwourth Trail east of Quincy, {{but to the}} west it reached Oroville and Marysville via <b>the</b> <b>Feather</b> River Canyon. While building the railroad, the Utah Construction Company had created a dirt road through the canyon to assist with construction; citizens created the Plumas County Road Association in 1911 to push for improvements to this roadway and creation of a year-round route between Oroville and Quincy (the existing route over the ridges was closed {{for at least four}} months each winter). The first state highway bond issue, passed by the state's voters in 1910, included a Route 30 connecting Oroville with Quincy. Plumas County surveyor Arthur W. Keddie surveyed <b>the</b> <b>Feather</b> River Canyon route for the California Highway Commission in 1913, but the state announced in 1916 that the existing ridge route would be improved. After much debate, the state legislative road committee included the statement that this route would follow <b>the</b> <b>Feather</b> River in the 1919 amendment authorizing a third bond issue; instead of keeping it as Route 30, the Highway Commission changed the designation to an extension of the short Richvale-Oroville (now SR 162) Route 21, which was also part of the first bond issue.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, a {{new species}} of chewing louse, Psittacobrosus bechsteini, was {{described}} based on a dead specimen discovered on a museum skin of the Cuban macaw. It {{is thought to have}} been unique to this species, and is therefore an example of coextinction. <b>The</b> <b>feather</b> mite species Genoprotolichus eurycnemis and Distigmesikya extincta have also been reported from Cuban macaw skins, the latter new to science.|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} noted that <b>the</b> <b>feather,</b> the first {{specimen}} of Archaeopteryx described, does not correspond well with the flight-related feathers of Archaeopteryx. It certainly is a flight feather of a contemporary species, but its size and proportions indicate that it may belong to another, smaller species of feathered theropod, of which only this feather is known so far. As <b>the</b> <b>feather</b> had been designated the type specimen, the name Archaeopteryx should then no longer {{be applied to the}} skeletons, thus creating significant nomenclatorial confusion. In 2007, two sets of scientists therefore petitioned the ICZN requesting that the London specimen explicitly be made the type by designating it as the new holotype specimen, or neotype. This suggestion was upheld by the ICZN after four years of debate, and the London specimen was designated the neotype on 3 October 2011.|$|E
25|$|On {{the basis}} of the Teotihuacan iconographical depictions of <b>the</b> <b>feathered</b> serpent, {{archaeologist}} Karl Taube has argued that <b>the</b> <b>feathered</b> serpent was a symbol of fertility and internal political structures contrasting with the War Serpent symbolizing the outwards military expansion of the Teotihuacan empire. Historian Enrique Florescano also analyzing Teotihuacan iconography argues that <b>the</b> <b>Feathered</b> Serpent was part of a triad of agricultural deities: the Goddess of the Cave symbolizing motherhood, reproduction and life, Tlaloc, god of rain, lightning and thunder and <b>the</b> <b>feathered</b> serpent, god of vegetational renewal. <b>The</b> <b>feathered</b> serpent was furthermore connected to the planet Venus because of this planet's importance {{as a sign of the}} beginning of the rainy season. To both Teotihuacan and Mayan cultures, Venus was in turn also symbolically connected with warfare.|$|R

5|$|Oroville Dam is an earthfill {{embankment}} dam on <b>the</b> <b>Feather</b> River {{east of the}} city of Oroville, California, in the Sierra Nevada foothills east of the Sacramento Valley. At 770 feet (235m) high, it is the tallest dam in the U.S. and serves mainly for water supply, hydroelectricity generation and flood control. The dam impounds Lake Oroville, the second largest man-made lake in the state of California, capable of storing more than 3.5 million acre-feet (4.4km3).|$|E

Similarly, the adaptations of birds' bills in species like the crossbill, spoonbill and (long-billed) snipe are discussed.|$|E
5|$|Since its {{completion}} in 1968, the Oroville Dam has allocated {{the flow of}} <b>the</b> <b>Feather</b> River from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta into the State Water Project's California Aqueduct, which provides a major supply of water for irrigation in the San Joaquin Valley as well as municipal and industrial water supplies to coastal Southern California, and has prevented large amounts of flood damage to the area — more than $1.3 billion between the years of 1987 and 1999. The dam has confined fish migration up <b>the</b> <b>Feather</b> River and the controlled flow of the river {{as a result of}} the Oroville Dam has affected riparian habitat. Multiple attempts at trying to counter the dam's impacts on fish migration have included the construction of a salmon/steelhead fish incubator on the river, which began shortly after the dam was completed.|$|E

50|$|The {{nature of}} <b>the</b> <b>feathers</b> {{preserved}} in <b>the</b> two immature Yixian specimens of Similicaudipteryx appeared to Xu and colleagues, who described <b>the</b> two <b>feathered</b> specimens, {{to change with}} age. The youngest specimen had relatively short primary feathers (those anchored to the hand) compared to its tail <b>feathers.</b> In <b>the</b> older specimen, <b>the</b> primary <b>feathers</b> were <b>the</b> same length as <b>the</b> tail <b>feathers,</b> and secondary feathers (those anchored to the lower arm) were also present. <b>The</b> primary <b>feathers</b> may have grown more slowly than <b>the</b> tail <b>feathers,</b> not reaching equal size until the animal was close to maturity, and <b>the</b> secondary <b>feathers</b> would not appear at all until this more mature stage. This suggests that <b>the</b> wing <b>feathers</b> had little use at a young age, only becoming fully developed with maturity.|$|R
5|$|The Western Pacific Railroad line, part of <b>the</b> <b>Feather</b> River Route, that {{parallels}} the cut-off was built between 1906 and 1907, filling a causeway with rock and gravel {{at a great}} cost. Along the route across the Great Salt Lake Desert, the railroad served the communities of Arinosa, Barro, and Salduro, which were also served by the new road. The Union Pacific Railroad merged with the Missouri Pacific Railroad and the Western Pacific in December 1982.|$|E
5|$|There's {{got to be}} {{a series}} of {{advantages}} all the way in <b>the</b> <b>feather.</b> If you can't think of one, then that's your problem not natural selection's problem...
