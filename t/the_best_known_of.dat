5|$|Anna Anderson (16 December 1896– 12 February 1984) was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>known</b> <b>of</b> several impostors {{who claimed}} to be Grand Duchess Anastasia of Russia. Anastasia, the {{youngest}} daughter of the last Tsar and Tsarina of Russia, Nicholas II and Alexandra, was killed along with her parents and siblings on 17 July 1918 by communist revolutionaries in Yekaterinburg, Russia; but the location of her body was unknown until 2007.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologically and ethnohistorically, Q'umarkaj is <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>known</b> <b>of</b> the Late Postclassic {{highland}} Maya capitals. The earliest {{reference to}} the site in Spanish occurs in Hernán Cortés' letters from Mexico. Although the site has been investigated, little reconstruction work has taken place. The surviving architecture, which includes a Mesoamerican ballcourt, temples and palaces, has been badly damaged by the looting of stone to build {{the nearby town of}} Santa Cruz del Quiché.|$|E
5|$|John {{also had}} illegitimate {{children}} with several mistresses. These children probably included nine sons called Richard, Oliver, Henry, Osbert Gifford, Geoffrey, John FitzJohn or Courcy, Odo or Eudes FitzRoy, Ivo, Henry, Richard the constable of Wallingford Castle and three daughters called Joan, Matilda the abbess of Barking and Isabella la Blanche. Joan was <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>known</b> <b>of</b> these, since she married Prince Llewelyn the Great of Wales.|$|E

5|$|Some B-class bracteates showing three godly {{figures have}} been {{interpreted}} as depicting Baldr's death, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>known</b> <b>of</b> {{these is the}} Fakse bracteate. Two of the figures are understood to be Baldr and Odin while both Loki and Hel have been proposed as candidates for the third figure. If it is Hel she is presumably greeting the dying Baldr as he comes to her realm.|$|E
5|$|Today, the Gettysburg National Cemetery and Gettysburg National Military Park are {{maintained}} by the U.S. National Park Service as two of the nation's most revered historical landmarks. Although Gettysburg is one of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>known</b> <b>of</b> all Civil War battlefields, it too faces threats to its preservation and interpretation. Many historically significant locations on the battlefield lie outside the boundaries of Gettysburg National Military Park and are vulnerable to residential or commercial development.|$|E

5|$|After the Mariner and Viking {{spacecraft}} {{had returned}} pictures of Mars as it really is, an apparently lifeless and canal-less world, these ideas about Mars {{had to be}} abandoned, and a vogue for accurate, realist depictions of human colonies on Mars developed, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>known</b> <b>of</b> which may be Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars trilogy. Pseudo-scientific speculations about the Face on Mars and other enigmatic landmarks spotted by space probes have meant that ancient civilizations {{continue to be a}} popular theme in science fiction, especially in film.|$|E
5|$|An emaki of Murasaki Shikibu's diary is {{mentioned}} in the Meigetsuki ("Record of the clean moon"), the diary of the poet and scholar Fujiwara no Teika. According to this document, in 1233 several aristocrats close to cloistered Emperor Go-Horikawa planned {{to create a new}} emaki of The Tale of Genji (after the 12th century Genji Monogatari Emaki, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>known</b> <b>of</b> these works), accompanied by another of Murasaki's diary. However, there is no conclusive evidence that the extant scrolls correspond to those mentioned by Fujiwara no Teika, even though the consistency of manufacturing dates suggests that this is the case. The paintings of the emaki have been attributed to the painter Fujiwara Nobuzane and the captions to the excellent calligrapher Gokyōgoku (後京極良経, 1169–1206), despite definitive evidence.|$|E
5|$|During 1937 Britten {{composed}} a Pacifist March to words by Ronald Duncan for the Peace Pledge Union, of which, as a pacifist, {{he had become}} an active member; the work was not a success and was soon withdrawn. <b>The</b> <b>best</b> <b>known</b> <b>of</b> his compositions from this period is probably Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge for string orchestra, described by Matthews as the first of Britten's works to become a popular classic. It was a success in North America, with performances in Toronto, New York, Boston, Chicago and San Francisco, under conductors including John Barbirolli and Serge Koussevitzky.|$|E

5|$|In the {{immediate}} post-war years, jazz {{took off in}} Italy. All American post-war jazz styles, from bebop to free jazz and fusion have their equivalents in Italy. The universality of Italian culture ensured that jazz clubs would spring up throughout the peninsula, that all radio and then television studios would have jazz-based house bands, that Italian musicians would then start nurturing a home grown kind of jazz, based on European song forms, classical composition techniques and folk music. Currently, all Italian music conservatories have jazz departments, and there are jazz festivals each year in Italy, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>known</b> <b>of</b> which is the Umbria Jazz Festival, and there are prominent publications such as the journal, Musica Jazz.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the architects}} {{training}} and working in Douglas's office were influenced by him. Perhaps <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>known</b> <b>of</b> these were Edmund Kirby and Edward Ould. Kirby is best remembered for his Roman Catholic churches. Ould went on to design a number of buildings in Chester and further afield in a Douglas-like style, including notably Wightwick Manor and various buildings at Port Sunlight. Other architects who did not work in his office were also influenced by him; these include Thomas Lockwood, Richard Thomas Beckett, Howard Hignett, A. E. Powers, James Strong and the Cheshire County Architect, Henry Beswick.|$|E
5|$|Music and {{politics}} have been intertwined for centuries in Italy. Just as many {{works of art}} in the Italian Renaissance were commissioned by royalty and the Roman Catholic Church, much music was likewise composed on the basis of such commissions—incidental court music, music for coronations, for the birth of a royal heir, royal marches, and other occasions. Composers who strayed ran certain risks. Among <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>known</b> <b>of</b> such cases was the Neapolitan composer Domenico Cimarosa, who composed the Republican hymn for the short-lived Neapolitan Republic of 1799. When the republic fell, he was tried for treason along with other revolutionaries. Cimarosa was not executed by the restored monarchy, but he was exiled.|$|E

5|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>known</b> <b>of</b> these {{tells of}} a {{stranger}} who arrived at the club on a stormy night. Invited in, he joined the members in a card game. One player dropped his card {{on the floor and}} when he bent under the table to retrieve it noticed that the stranger had a cloven hoof. At this point the visitor disappeared in a ball of flame. This story, which is found in texts from at least the 1930s, is very similar to one associated with Loftus Hall, County Wexford. The Loftus family owned a hunting lodge – known as Dolly Mount – which was also to be found on Mount Pelier Hill.|$|E
5|$|The empire's legacy {{includes}} many monuments spread over South India, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>known</b> <b>of</b> {{which is the}} group at Hampi. Different temple building traditions in South and Central India came together in the Vijayanagara Architecture style. This synthesis inspired architectural innovation in Hindu temples construction. Efficient administration and vigorous overseas trade brought new technologies such as water management systems for irrigation. The empire's patronage enabled fine arts and literature to reach new heights in Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, and Sanskrit, while Carnatic music evolved into its current form. The Vijayanagara Empire created an epoch in South Indian history that transcended regionalism by promoting Hinduism as a unifying factor.|$|E
5|$|The first fossils named Edmontosaurus were {{discovered}} in southern Alberta (named after Edmonton, the capital city), in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation (formerly called the lower Edmonton Formation). The type species, E. regalis, was named by Lawrence Lambe in 1917, although several other species that are now classified in Edmontosaurus were named earlier. <b>The</b> <b>best</b> <b>known</b> <b>of</b> these is E. annectens, named by Othniel Charles Marsh in 1892; originally as a species of Claosaurus, known for many years as a species of Trachodon, and later as Anatosaurus annectens. Anatosaurus and Anatotitan are now generally regarded as synonyms of Edmontosaurus.|$|E

5|$|The true {{honey bees}} (genus Apis, {{of which there}} are seven currently-recognized species) are highly eusocial, and are among <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>known</b> <b>of</b> all insects. Their colonies are {{established}} by swarms, consisting of a queen and several hundred workers. There are 29 subspecies of one of these species, Apis mellifera, native to Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Africanized bees are a hybrid strain of A. mellifera that escaped from experiments involving crossing European and African subspecies; they are extremely defensive.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} Katyn {{memorials}} in the UK, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>known</b> <b>of</b> which was unveiled on 18 September 1976 at Gunnersbury Cemetery in London, amid considerable controversy. During {{the period of}} the Cold War, successive British governments objected to plans by the UK's Polish community to build a major monument to commemorate the massacre. The Soviet Union did not want Katyn to be remembered, and put pressure on Britain to prevent the creation of the monument. As a result, the construction of the monument was delayed for many years. After the local community had finally secured the right to build the monument, no official government representative was present at the opening ceremony (although some politicians did attend the event unofficially).|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{fragmented}} votive life-size sculptures of little children lying {{on their side}} and holding a pet animal or a small object were also recovered at the temple site; among <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>known</b> <b>of</b> these is a sculpture of a royal child holding a dove with his right hand; the boy's head is shaved, his torso is bare and his lower body is wrapped in a large cloth. The socle of this sculpture is inscribed with a dedication from Baalshillem, {{the son of a}} Sidonian king to Eshmun, which illustrates the importance of the site to the Sidonian monarchy. These votive sculptures appear to have been purposely broken after dedication to Eshmun and then ceremoniously cast into the sacred canal, probably simulating the sacrifice of the sick child. All of these sculptures represent boys. A limestone bust of a Kouros dating from the 6thcentury BC was found at the site, but unlike the archaic Greek kouroi this figure is not bare.|$|E
