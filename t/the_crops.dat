40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} the evaluation of the mitigation effect of the upland field on the regional intrinsic environment, considering <b>the</b> <b>crop</b> growth stages. FAO Penman-Monteith method is introduced for caluclation of the reference evepotranspiration. <b>The</b> <b>crop</b> transpiration and <b>the</b> soil surface evaportation in the upland fields are separately estimated using the cropcoefficients, considering <b>the</b> <b>crop</b> growth stages. <b>The</b> ratios of <b>the</b> <b>crop</b> transpiration and <b>the</b> soil surface evaportation in the water consumption change drastically with <b>the</b> <b>crop</b> growth stages. To evaluate the mitigation effect of the upland field, the latent heat fluxes in the sugar cane field and bare field are estimated during <b>the</b> <b>crop</b> growth period. <b>The</b> deference of the latent heat fluxes in the sugar cane field, the latent heat flux increases drastically, with the sugar cane growing. In the mid-season stage, the latent heat flux is larger than the effect on the envirnoment, and the efficiency changes with the various factors, including <b>the</b> <b>crop</b> types, <b>the</b> <b>crop</b> growth stages, <b>the</b> cultivation, and so on...|$|R

5|$|A central Food Production Committee, set up {{in early}} 1942, {{organised}} the conscripted labourers and attempted to help the white farmers to grow all <b>the</b> <b>crops</b> they could. Maize production grew by 40% between 1942 and 1944, the potato harvest doubled and the onion crop grew sixfold {{by the end of}} the war. Production of the colony's most important cash crop, tobacco, was high throughout the war, averaging about 40million pounds (18million kg) annually.|$|E
5|$|Agriculture {{also made}} up an {{important}} part of the Plymouth economy. The colonists adopted Native American agricultural practices and crops. They planted maize, squash, pumpkins, beans, and potatoes. Besides <b>the</b> <b>crops</b> themselves, the Pilgrims learned productive farming techniques from the Native Americans, such as proper crop rotation and the use of dead fish to fertilize the soil. In addition to these native crops, the colonists also successfully planted Old World crops such as turnips, carrots, peas, wheat, barley, and oats.|$|E

5|$|Dunstanburgh Castle was not {{a primary}} {{strategic}} target for Scottish attack, as it was positioned away from the main routes through the region, but it was kept well garrisoned during the Scottish wars. The surrounding manor of Embleton had nonetheless suffered from Scottish raids and Gaunt had concerns over {{the condition of the}} castle's defences, ordering the building of additional fortifications around the gatehouse. Part of the surrounding lands around the castle may have been brought into agricultural production at this time, either to feed a growing garrison, or to protect <b>the</b> <b>crops</b> against Scottish attacks.|$|E
5|$|Food and cuisine in Ireland {{takes its}} {{influence}} from <b>the</b> <b>crops</b> grown and animals farmed in the island's temperate climate {{and from the}} social and political circumstances of Irish history. For example, whilst from the Middle Ages until the arrival of the potato in the 16th century the dominant feature of the Irish economy was the herding of cattle, the number of cattle a person owned was equated to their social standing. Thus herders would avoid slaughtering a milk-producing cow.|$|E

5|$|Food was {{in short}} supply in the conquered areas of the Soviet Union and Poland, with rations {{inadequate}} to meet nutritional needs. The retreating armies had burned <b>the</b> <b>crops</b> {{and much of the}} remainder was sent back to the Reich. In Germany itself, food rations had to be cut in 1942. In his role as Plenipotentiary of the Four Year Plan, Hermann Göring demanded increased shipments of grain from France and fish from Norway. The 1942 harvest was a good one and food supplies remained adequate in Western Europe.|$|E

5|$|In 1880, {{as part of}} its {{campaign}} for the Three Fs (fair rent, fixity of tenure, and free sale) and specifically in resistance to proposed evictions on the estate, local activists of the Irish Land League encouraged Boycott's employees (including the seasonal workers required to harvest <b>the</b> <b>crops</b> on LordErne's estate) to withdraw their labour, and began a campaign of isolation against Boycott in the local community. This campaign included shops in nearby Ballinrobe refusing to serve him, and the withdrawal of services. Some were threatened with violence to ensure compliance.|$|E

40|$|The {{economic}} exploitation of agricultural resources {{is one of}} the main goals of agricultural policy to achieve sustainable agricultural development. On the other hand, the method of linear programming {{is one of the}} most important mathematical techniques designed to distribute economic resources among alternative uses so as to achieve the optimal use. Accordingly, this study aims at characterizing <b>the</b> <b>cropping</b> patterns that maximizes the net return per feddan, minimizes water requirements and maximizes the net return per water unit for <b>the</b> <b>cropping</b> pattern of <b>the</b> year 2006. To accomplish the study main goals, three linear programming models were applied as a tool for economic planning. The main objectives of these scenarios are maximizing the total net revenues for <b>the</b> <b>cropping</b> pattern calculated, maximizing the total net revenues for <b>the</b> <b>cropping</b> pattern, minimizing water irrigation requirements, and maximizing the total net revenues for <b>the</b> <b>cropping</b> pattern in case of achieving higher self-sufficiency ratios for <b>the</b> major <b>crops.</b> <b>The</b> results of solving the linear programming models for <b>the</b> <b>cropping</b> pattern found out that the optimum combination of crops can be produced according to the third scenario, since it achieves an increase in the total net revenue for <b>the</b> <b>cropping</b> pattern of about 0. 13 %. Moreover, it saves about 4. 28 % of the water irrigation, as well as achieving greater return per unit of water resources of about 4, 61 % as compared to those achieved by <b>the</b> <b>cropping</b> pattern of <b>the</b> year 2006 in addition to achieving suitable self-sufficiency ratios of most major crops...|$|R

40|$|The study aims to {{investigate}} the influence factors on <b>the</b> <b>crop</b> food supply price using the Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method. <b>Crops</b> are <b>the</b> basic food rations for urban and rural residents and occupy the most important position in the food consumption. The price of <b>the</b> <b>crop</b> food has important influence on the stable economic operation and even social stability in China; hence {{it is crucial to}} find out the fluctuation rules and formation mechanism of crop food supply price. However, there is very little work has been done to look into the relationship between different influence factors and <b>the</b> <b>crop</b> food supply price. As a result, this study proposes a new method based on the DEA to quantitatively investigate the influence factors on <b>the</b> <b>crop</b> food supply price. The inflation, seeded area, cost of production, yield per unit area and rice consumption level have been selected as the influence factors in this study. Empirical analysis using the historical data acquired from China Statistical Yearbook during 2005 to 2012 has been carried out to calculate the quantities of the five factors connected to <b>the</b> <b>crop</b> food price change. The analysis results show that the price of <b>the</b> <b>crop</b> food is influenced obviously by the yield per unit area; meanwhile the cost of production has a certain impact on <b>the</b> <b>crop</b> food price. Hence, useful solutions can be proposed to stabilize <b>the</b> <b>crop</b> food price...|$|R
40|$|The {{two species}} under genus Echinochloa, E. frumentacea (Indian {{barnyard}} millet) and E. esculenta (Japanese barnyard millet), are cultivated {{for food and}} fodder by hilly and tribal communities in Asia particularly in India, China and Japan. <b>The</b> <b>crop</b> has wide adaptability and occupies {{a special place in}} marginal rainfed areas because of its short life cycle. Although the area under <b>the</b> <b>crop</b> has come down drastically in last 50 years, <b>the</b> <b>crop</b> ability to survive under harsh conditions makes it a better choice during famine years. In the Indian Himalayan region, <b>the</b> <b>crop</b> was traditionally used as a substitute for rice. It has been identified as a suitable choice for climate-resilient agriculture.
