5|$|Should the {{tropical}} system further intensify and have winds estimated or measured, as greater than 64kn (74mph; 119km/h), <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> called a hurricane and classified on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. The lowest classification on the SSHWS is a Category 1 hurricane, which has winds of between 64–82kn (74–95mph, 119–153km/h). Should the hurricane intensify further <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> rated as a Category 2 hurricane, {{if it has}} winds of between 83–95kn (96–110mph, 154–177km/h). When a system becomes a Category 3 hurricane with winds of between 96–112kn (111–129mph, 178–208km/h), it {{is considered to be}} a major hurricane by the warning centers. A Category 4 hurricane has winds of 113–136kn (130–156mph, 209–251km/h), while a Category 5 hurricane has winds of at least 137kn (157mph, 252km/h). A post tropical cyclone is a system that has weakened, into a remnant low or has dissipated and formal advisories are usually discontinued at this stage. However, advisories may continue if the post tropical cyclone, poses a significant threat to life and property. They may also continue if the remnants of the system have a chance of regeneration and producing tropical storm or hurricane-force winds over land within 48hours.|$|E
5|$|Should the named storm intensify {{further and}} reach winds speeds of 48knots (89km/h, 55mph), <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> {{classified}} as a severe tropical storm. A severe tropical storm is designated as a tropical cyclone when it reaches wind speeds of 64knots (118km/h, 74mph). Should a tropical cyclone intensify further and reach wind speeds of 90knots (166km/h, 103mph), it will be {{classified as a}}n intense tropical cyclone. A very intense tropical cyclone is the highest category on the South-West Indian Ocean Tropical Cyclone scale, and has winds of over 115knots (212km/h, 132mph).|$|E

5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{that develop}} in the Northern Hemisphere are officially classified, by the warning centres on one of three intensity scales. Tropical cyclones or subtropical cyclones that exist, within the North Atlantic Ocean or the North-eastern Pacific Ocean, are classified as either tropical depressions or tropical storms. Should a system intensify further and become a hurricane, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> classified on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, {{which is based on}} the estimated maximum sustained winds over a 1-minute period. In the Western Pacific, the Typhoon Committee uses four separate classifications for tropical cyclones that exist within the basin, which are based on the estimated maximum sustained winds over a 10-minute period.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{that occur}} within the Northern Hemisphere {{to the east}} of the anti-meridian, are officially monitored by either the National Hurricane Center or the Central Pacific Hurricane Center. Within the region a tropical cyclone is defined to be a warm cored, non-frontal synoptic disturbance, that develops over tropical or subtropical waters, with organized atmospheric convection and a closed well defined circulation centre. The region also defines a subtropical cyclone as a non-frontal low pressure disturbance, that has the characteristics of both tropical and extratropical cyclones. Once either of these classifications are met, then advisories are initiated and the warning centers will classify the system as either a tropical or subtropical depression, if the one-minute sustained winds estimated or measured as less than 33kn (38mph; 62km/h). However, if a tropical disturbance is capable of producing tropical storm or hurricane conditions on land within 48 hours, then advisories will be initiated and it will be classified as a potential tropical cyclone. Should the system intensify further or already have one-minute sustained winds of 34–63kn (39–73mph; 63–118km/h), <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> called either a tropical or subtropical storm and assigned a name.|$|E
