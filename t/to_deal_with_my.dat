It will be inevitable that different aspects are more focused on by different readers and cultural backgrounds. If I could say one thing, this novel isnâ€™t a singular indictment of the Korean patriarchy. I wanted <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> long-lasting questions about the possibility/impossibility of innocence in this world, which is mingled with such violence and beauty. These were universal questions that occupied me as I wrote it".|$|E

A man in dealing should as really design his Neighbours good, profit, and advantage, as his own: For this is to exercise Charity in his dealing.|$|E

I had nearly flung back my parole in his face, {{and told him that}} no English sword should set me on the Bruce's throne; but there is {{something}} in Harry of Monmouth that one must love, and there are moments when to see and hear him one would as soon doubt the commission of an angel with a flaming sword.' ...|$|E
60|$|Twenty {{minutes before}} nine that night, we were {{deposited}} at the Pacific Transfer Station near Council Bluffs, {{on the eastern}} bank of the Missouri river. Here we were to stay the night at a kind of caravanserai, set apart for emigrants. But I {{gave way to a}} thirst for luxury, separated myself from my companions, and marched with my effects into the Union Pacific Hotel. A white clerk and a coloured gentleman whom, in my plain European way, I should call the boots, were installed behind a counter like bank tellers. They took my name, assigned me a number, and proceeded <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> packages. And here came the tug of war. I wished to give up my packages into safe keeping; but I did not wish to go to bed. And this, it appeared, was impossible in an American hotel.|$|E
60|$|For these reasons, and {{for many}} more, I for one {{have come to believe}} in going back to fundamentals. Such is the general idea of this book. I wish <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> most {{distinguished}} contemporaries, not personally or in a merely literary manner, but in relation to the real body of doctrine which they teach. I am not concerned with Mr. Rudyard Kipling as a vivid artist or a vigorous personality; I am concerned with him as a Heretic--that is to say, a man whose view of things has the hardihood to differ from mine. I am not concerned with Mr. Bernard Shaw {{as one of the most}} brilliant and one of the most honest men alive; I am concerned with him as a Heretic--that is to say, a man whose philosophy is quite solid, quite coherent, and quite wrong. I revert to the doctrinal methods of the thirteenth century, inspired by the general hope of getting something done.|$|E

6000|$|There {{could be}} no doubt, I thought, {{in the mind of}} any {{reasonable}} person that the walking delegate was the source of the discontent among our proletariate, and I alleged him with a confidence which met the approval of the professor, apparently, for he nodded, as if to say that I had {{hit the nail on the}} head this time; and the minister seemed to be freshly impressed with a notion that could not be new to him. The lawyer and the doctor were silent, as if waiting for the banker to speak again; but he was silent, too. The manufacturer, to my chagrin, broke into a laugh. [...] "I'm afraid," [...] he said, with a sardonic levity which surprised me, [...] "you'll have to go a good deal deeper than the walking delegate. He's a symptom; he isn't the disease. The thing keeps on and on, and it seems to be always about wages; but it isn't about wages at the bottom. Some of those fellows know it and some of them don't, but the real discontent is with the whole system, with the nature of things. I had a curious revelation on that point the last time I tried <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> men as a union. They were always bothering me about this and about that, and there was no end to the bickering. I yielded point after point, but it didn't make any difference. It seemed as if the more I gave the more they asked. At last I made up my mind to try to get at the real inwardness of the matter, and I didn't wait for their committee to come to me--I sent for their leading man, and said I wanted to have it out with him. He wasn't a bad fellow, and when I got at him, man to man that way, I found he had sense, and he had ideas--it's no use pretending those fellows are fools; he had thought about his side of the question, anyway. I said: 'Now what does it all mean? Do you want the earth, or don't you? When is it going to end?' I offered him something to take, but he said he didn't drink, and we compromised on cigars. 'Now when is it going to end?' said I, and I pressed it home, and wouldn't let him fight off from the point. 'Do you mean when is it all going to end?' said he. 'Yes,' said I, 'all. I'm sick of it. If there's any way out I'd like to know it.' 'Well,' said he, 'I'll tell you, if you want to know. It's all going to end when you get the same amount of money for the same amount of work as we do.'" ...|$|E

The finished product, titled We Are on Our Own, was published by Drawn and Quarterly in 2006. It is drawn in black-and-white pencil and incorporates some of Katin's family photos. She created her second graphic novel, Letting It Go, published in 2013, in response to her [...] "enormous need <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> trauma of my son's decision to move to Berlin". Letting It Go is also autobiographical, depicting her initial reaction to her son's move to Berlin, and her own visit to Germany, including Berlin's Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe. In contrast to her first novel, it is drawn in colored crayons.|$|E

5000|$|According to John Lydon {{regarding}} album opener [...] "Albatross", he {{said the}} band recorded the song live at The Manor Studio in Oxfordshire, with Lydon free-forming his lyrics. Guitarist Keith Levene, bassist Jah Wobble, and session drummer David Humphrey made the song up as they went along, and they recorded the song in one take. PiL also recorded at Townhouse Studios in West London with session drummer Richard Dudanski and produced the songs [...] "Memories", [...] "No Birds", [...] "Socialist", and [...] "Chant"; Levene recalls that [...] "Memories" [...] features him playing [...] "this normal Spanish guitar thing that goes dun-da-da-dun da-da-dun... it's {{one of the first}} things I learned to play on guitar, very simple. I was very fond of that. I totally knew what the fuck John was singing about ... All I'm doing when I'm playing those notes over the top. I just had the guitar going through an Electric Mistress." [...] The song [...] "Death Disco", which was released as a single in late June 1979, was re-recorded and retitled [...] "Swan Lake" [...] when it was released on Metal Box. Levene stated that, [...] "I realised that this tune that I was bastardising by mistake was 'Swan Lake', so I started playing it on purpose but I was doing it from memory. You can hear that I'm not playing it exactly right. It just worked. ... There's a few versions of that. The one on Metal Box is version two, which is very different from the simpler, original 12-inch version." [...] The subject matter of the lyrics is based on Lydon's mother's dying of cancer: [...] "When I had <b>to</b> <b>deal</b> <b>with</b> <b>my</b> mother's death, which upset the fuck out of me, I did it partly through music. I had to watch her die slowly of cancer for a whole year. I wrote 'Death Disco' about that. I played it to her just before she died and she was very happy. That's the Irish in her, nothing drearily sympathetic or weak. Like her you've got to really get to grips with your emotions and attack them, confront them head on. You won't solve things any other way. It works for me, I can't run away from things." [...] PiL recorded the song at an empty hall in Brixton to test a three-bass sound system and worked with drummer Jim Walker but didn't record with him.|$|E
