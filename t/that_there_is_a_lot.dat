500|$|During {{her show}} at the Olympic Stadium in Rome, Madonna {{dedicated}} her song [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] to Pope Benedict XVI. She stated, [...] "I'm gonna dedicate this song to the Pope, because, I know he loves me. I am a child of God! And you know what else?...." [...] Italian newspaper Corriere della Sera called the dedication a surprising provocation. During the 2009 leg, at the Bucharest concert in Romania, Madonna began talking about gypsy discrimination in East-European countries. She said that [...] "It has been brought to my attention ... <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of discrimination against Romanies and Gypsies in general in Eastern Europe. [...] It made me feel very sad." [...] Immediately boos and [...] resounded from the 60,000 crowd. Madonna added that [...] "e don't believe in discrimination [...] we believe in freedom and equal rights for everyone." [...] Although some applauded this statement, many others continued booing when Madonna mentioned discrimination against gay people. Madonna's publicist Liz Rosenberg {{issued a statement saying}} that [...] "Madonna has been touring with a phenomenal troupe of Roma musicians who made her aware of the discrimination toward them in several countries so she felt compelled to make a brief statement, [...] She will not be issuing a further statement." [...] In January 2009, Florin Cioabă, self-proclaimed King of Roma, announced that he wished to present Madonna with a gold plaque to thank the singer for criticising discrimination against the Roma people.|$|E
500|$|Boosinger {{said that}} while the game retains the comedy of the Ace Attorney series and has great {{character}} writing, he found the story to be dull, slow, and too long. Ronaghan called the dialogue funny, and said that the game was well-paced, long, and enjoyable. Goldstein called the story interesting, but said that it at times plays out [...] "like a bad soap opera". Walker appreciated the choice to make Edgeworth the game's lead character, and called Kay a fantastic addition. He found the translation of the game to be incredible, despite a number of spelling mistakes. Hopper appreciated that the game has a new protagonist and setting, and called the dialogue [...] "cheesy but charming". On the other hand, he said <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of superfluous text in the game, making the cases longer than they need to be. Parker said that it takes some time to get used to playing as Edgeworth, saying that he is not as immediately engaging as Phoenix and Apollo. She called the story deep and intricate, and slow but solid. Ronaghan called the art style and presentation wonderful, and said that each character [...] "oozes with personality", but that the animation, while better than that in previous titles, was limited to only a few frames at a time. Goldstein called the characters colorful, but found the locations to be uninteresting. Hopper called the game's aesthetic [...] "anime-esque" [...] and clean, and said that the static images were decent. Parker liked the game's presentation, and called the environments [...] "beautifully drawn".|$|E
