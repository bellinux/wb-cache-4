5|$|Davos Seaworth confronts Melisandre about Shireen's death. Melisandre {{admits to}} burning Shireen alive, but {{points out that}} she did it for the Lord of Light. Davos rebuts by saying that Stannis was {{defeated}} anyway and that Melisandre's actions were all for naught, forcing her <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was wrong. Davos requests permission from Jon Snow to execute Melisandre, but she counters {{that she will be}} useful in the coming war against the White Walkers. Jon exiles Melisandre from the North and threatens to execute her if she ever returns. Later, Jon and Sansa Stark discuss who will lead the united Stark forces, with each deferring to the other.|$|E
5|$|At {{the house}} of her friend, Effy Stonem (Kaya Scodelario), Pandora (Lisa Backwell) tells Effy's mother, Anthea (Morwenna Banks), that she misses Thomas, who {{recently}} returned to his country of origin, the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Later, Effy's father, Jim (Harry Enfield), discovers his wife's infidelity when his boss, Steve (David Baddiel), arrives at the house, declaring his love for Anthea. Effy grows miserable after Jim leaves the family, and Pandora, desperate for some fun, throws a pyjama party. Effy and Katie Fitch (Megan Prescott) arrive with Pandora at her house for the party and meet her neurotic mother, Angela (Sally Phillips). Disappointed {{by the lack of}} boys, drugs and alcohol because of Angela's strict supervision, Katie spikes the brownies that they make with MDMA. As Naomi Campbell (Lily Loveless) and Katie's twin sister, Emily (Kathryn Prescott), arrive together, Naomi urges Emily <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is gay, but Emily denies it.

Anyhow, he overdid the thing. If he had given me a thick wax match like those we found on board the wreck, it wouldn't have proved much; while his anxiety to show he used the small pine kind strikes me as significant." ...|$|R
25|$|Due to the {{international}} media coverage she received in 2014, Poklonskaya has been intentionally reticent about her personal life. Although Russian media reported her as being married, when Poklonskaya failed to disclose her husband's name in her financial declarations, she was forced <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had broken up with her fiancé, and had only stated {{she was married to}} prevent unwanted attention from male fans who may have wanted to date her. Poklonskaya has a daughter named Anastasiya, but it is not known if her fiancé is the father of her child.|$|E
25|$|As {{the play}} begins, Valentine is {{preparing}} to leave Verona for Milan so as to broaden his horizons. He begs his best friend, Proteus, to come with him, but Proteus {{is in love with}} Julia, and refuses to leave. Disappointed, Valentine bids Proteus farewell and goes on alone. Meanwhile, Julia is discussing Proteus with her maid, Lucetta, who tells Julia that she thinks Proteus is fond of her. Julia, however, acts coyly, embarrassed <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> likes him. Lucetta then produces a letter; she will not say who gave it to her, but teases Julia that it was Valentine's servant, Speed, who brought it from Proteus. Julia, still unwilling to reveal her love in front of Lucetta, angrily tears up the letter. She sends Lucetta away, but then, realising her own rashness, she picks up the fragments of the letter and kisses them, trying to piece them back together.|$|E
25|$|Delia was {{introduced}} on General Hospital in October 2013 {{when she is}} visited by Sam Morgan (Kelly Monaco) and Silas Clay (Michael Easton) and forced <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is the biological mother of Ava Jerome (Maura West) from an affair with late mobster, Victor Jerome (Jack Axelrod). Delia and Ava eventually reunite when Ava shows up in New York. Delia later comes to Port Charles to run interference with Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard) for Ava. Ava reveals that she killed Sonny's girlfriend and that Sonny will kill her once she delivers her baby. To protect her daughter, Delia tries to steal information implicating Sonny in another murder but is caught and sent back to New York. When Ava was presumed dead, she popped up at Ryan's Bar to tell her mother that she was alive, {{and the two of}} them later schemed to give Ava another identity as a dark-haired look-alike whom Delia claimed was a twin she had also given up for adoption.|$|E

25|$|Simpson's initial {{claim that}} he was asleep {{at the time of}} the murders was refuted by several {{different}} accounts. According to defense lawyer Johnnie Cochran, Simpson had never left his house that night, and he was alone as he packed his belongings to travel to Chicago. Cochran claimed that Simpson went outside through the back door to hit a few golf balls into the children's sandbox in the front garden, one or more of which made the three loud thumps on the wall of Kaelin's bungalow. Cochran produced a potential alibi witness, Rosa Lopez, a neighbor's Spanish-speaking housekeeper who testified that she had seen Simpson's car parked outside his house {{at the time of the}} murders. But Lopez's testimony, which was not presented to the jury, was pulled apart under intense cross-examination by Clark, when Lopez was forced <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> could not be sure of the precise time she saw Simpson's white Bronco outside his house.|$|E
25|$|Jean's {{past was}} {{revealed}} {{and she is}} shown in her teenage years being confronted by Magneto and Professor X, ultimately joining the X-Men, {{becoming part of the}} original five that included Angel, Iceman, Beast and Cyclops. Magneto then tried to force Jean to join by attacking the X-Men, but she fought and defeated Magneto, forcing the extremist <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was much stronger than originally thought. Specifically, Jean prevented Magneto from crushing a visorless Cyclops with a bus and using her telekinetic powers to restrain Cyclops's optic beams, then telepathically guided Cyclops aiming at Magneto, blasting Magneto's helmet off; it was around this time that she apparently developed a romantic relationship with Scott Summers. After working at the Institute for a few years, Logan develops a huge romantic crush on her at first sight. Scott and Logan confront each other regarding this matter, which ended with Jean scolding Scott for lashing out at Wolverine. In the pilot, she is still shown berating Scott for poor behavior towards Wolverine and demands that Scott apologize.|$|E
25|$|We are {{introduced}} to the new cast on their first day at Roundview College in the series premiere, 'Everyone'. JJ Jones, James Cook and Freddie McClair are best friends to begin with; twins Katie and Emily Fitch know Naomi Campbell from school but are distant with her because Katie is homophobic and suspects her of being a lesbian. The gang meet Effy, and sidekick Pandora; Katie wants to become Effy's best friend, and both Cook and Freddie are instantly smitten. Cook passes the test set by Effy and begins a casual sexual relationship with her. Episode two focuses on Cook who invites the whole group over, but their friendships are not very strong yet; chaos ensues, and Cook angers local gangster Johnny White (Mackenzie Crook). Thomas Tomone is only introduced in the third episode. He is an immigrant from the Congo, and develops a crush on Pandora. He endears himself to the group when {{he is able to}} get Johnny White off their backs by besting him in a pepper-eating competition. However, despairing at his decadent life in Bristol, Mrs. Tomone brings Thomas back to the Congo. In 'Pandora', Pandora's innocent slumber party becomes an MDMA-fuelled rave after Katie spikes the brownies. Emily and Naomi kiss; Naomi denies being gay, but urges Emily <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is, who also denies it. Pandora allows Cook to take her virginity, but regrets it when later Thomas returns from the Congo.|$|E

Once there, Miranda, without makeup, opens up to Andy about the effect Miranda's {{impending}} divorce will have on her daughters. Later that night, Nigel tells Andy that he has accepted a job as Creative Director with rising fashion star James Holt at Miranda's recommendation. Andy finally succumbs to Christian's charms and, after spending the night with him, learns from him about a plan to replace Miranda with Jacqueline Follet as editor of Runway. Despite the suffering she has endured at her boss's behest, she attempts to warn Miranda.|$|R

25|$|Mick and Stan's {{relationship}} {{starts to}} thaw, annoying Shirley. Mick attempts to reunite Shirley with her estranged son, Dean Wicks (Matt Di Angelo), with little success. Tina {{refers to the}} incident involving a young Mick in the bathtub, citing the event as happening after their mother left. This confuses Mick, and he concludes that it was Stan who tried to kill him and attacks him, prompting Shirley <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had attempted to drown him. Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden) finds out from Shirley that Mick is actually her son, his father is a man named Andy and her mother Sylvie Carter (Linda Marlowe) concealed the pregnancy and brought Mick up as her and Stan's son. Shirley warns Phil not to tell Mick. Despite {{not being able to}} swim and having a phobia of water, Mick signs up to a sponsored swim in aid of his friend Billy Mitchell's (Perry Fenwick) young daughter, Janet Mitchell (Grace), who has Down's syndrome. He starts to learn at the local swimming pool, and confesses his fear to his friend, Ian Beale (Adam Woodyatt). Ian helps him overcome this fear and he makes progress. Linda tells Mick she wants another baby after she realises her children are too old to require her constant attention. Mick convinces Linda {{that this is not a}} good idea, but proposes to her, as they are not actually married, though their families think they are. Linda turns down the proposal, liking things as they are, and then she finds out that Dean has overheard this conversation.|$|E
25|$|Poirot has had Sheppard and Caryl round for dinner. They {{are expecting}} further guests as Poirot {{has asked the}} {{household}} from Fernley to call round but his first visitor is Bourne, panicked over a newspaper report that Poirot asked Davies to insert claiming that Ralph had been arrested in Liverpool. This forces Bourne <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> and Ralph are married. She had confessed this to Sir Roger and he had dismissed her. Ralph came to Fernley after an urgent telegram from her but she insists they only met in the summerhouse for ten minutes and then she left him there. Poirot wants her to join the others when they arrive and Caryl insists that the former maid can stay the night at their house. She goes to make arrangements as the party from Fernley arrives. Poirot asks them to sit down as he addresses them and he first reveals Bourne's marriage to Ralph. However {{the time when the}} two people met in the summerhouse coincided with the time that Sir Roger's voice was heard behind the closed study door. They are therefore all puzzled as to who was with him but Poirot has another idea – no one was with him: the formal words that Ackroyd were using were intended for the Dictaphone. This creates problems for Ralph as his alibi for the time is now useless and Raymond thinks the young man should come forward and explain himself. Poirot agrees and opens the curtains to the conservatory, revealing Ralph. Poirot guessed that Sheppard met him that night, knowing that he had gone to the inn where he was staying, and had then hidden him. Poirot further deduced that a doctor would hide someone in a nursing home, hence his questions to Caryl. Ralph’s alibi is now useless and Poirot tells the assembled group that to save him the real murderer – {{who is one of the}} people in the room – must confess. They have until midday tomorrow and then Poirot will go to the police.|$|E
500|$|However, in R v. Hill and Hall (1989), the Court of Appeal {{introduced}} an objective element to part (b) of the defence. The defendants {{had been convicted}} of possession of a hacksaw blade outside a US naval base in Wales, having admitted an intention to use the blade to cut through the base's perimeter fence. They claimed a lawful excuse in that they had acted to protect their own property located near the base; their reasoning was that the base would {{at some point in the}} future attract a nuclear attack by the Soviet Union. Given that Hill was [...] "forced <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> did not expect a nuclear bomb to fall today or tomorrow", the Court concluded that this threat to property was too remote and thus the defence had not been made out, however honest the belief had been.|$|E

Nina records a song called [...] "Born to Try", which is heard by Connor. He {{secretly}} enters the song into UniFM's undiscovered talent contest. Nina is angry with Connor at first but tells her that he did it for her so she could realise her potential. Nina's song wins the contest, but she is too shy to come forward, and Tahnee takes the credit instead. Connor takes Nina to the station and she admits that she wrote and sang the song. Nina then overcomes her fears to sing [...] "Born to Try" [...] for the crowd, which upsets Tahnee. Nina's prize is to sing at a nightclub; afterwards, she is approached by Glenn Wheatley, but she turns down his offer.|$|E
500|$|For {{the plan}} to be successful, the Expedition must also prevent the Asuran ships from {{escaping}} into hyperspace. The Wraith prisoner convinces seven Wraith hive ships to join the Earth ships' attack. Concerned about the Asuran threat, the Travelers under Larrin contribute some of their ships as well. Back on Atlantis, Teyla (Rachel Luttrell) is forced <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> is pregnant, and is pulled off duty. The combined fleet arrives over the Asuran homeworld and engages the enemy fleet, while Fran beams down {{to the surface and}} begins to pull the other nanites towards her. However, the nanite mass collapses the power grid, meaning that the ZPMs cannot be overloaded. McKay and Colonel Carter (Amanda Tapping) determine that, if they increase the mass's attraction to the ultra-dense neutronium in the planet's crust, the additional mass will cause it to sink into the core of the planet. The pressure and heat in the core initiates a fusion reaction so that the planet explodes, shortly after the allied fleet escapes. One Asuran ship survives {{at the end of the}} episode, revealing its commander as Elizabeth Weir (Torri Higginson), who notes that their [...] "work" [...] can now begin without interference.|$|E
500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club was {{critical}} of Emma in the show's second season. He said: [...] "Emma is apparently married, but we haven’t seen her husband since October, and {{even when he was}} more of a “fixture” on the show (which is difficult to say about a character who’s appeared as little as Carl Howell has), his relationship with Emma made no sense as anything other than a plot device. Now, as it turns out, Emma and Carl haven’t consummated their marriage at all, and this {{has something to do with}} the fact that the show has combined Emma’s germ-phobia and virginity into some sort of terrifying psychosexual pathology that doesn’t make much sense and doesn’t resemble the somewhat levelheaded person she used to be. (The plotting in Will Schuester’s love life is the one place where the show attempts to have even a modicum of continuity, for whatever reason.) Anyway, Carl is necessarily upset about this, and he’s also upset when Holly Holliday gets Emma <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> still has confusing feelings for Will, so he resolves to let her stay in the condo while he stays in the Radisson where all of the good big-name Glee guest stars go to hope their pilots for the fall are picked up." ...|$|E

He was forced <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> himself <b>that</b> <b>she</b> had deliberately chosen not to take any portion of that drive home alone with him. And yet, as he looked back through the evening, he told himself that he was satisfied. He declined to feel even a shadow of discouragement.|$|R
50|$|For the {{majority}} of the novel, she refuses <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>to</b> herself <b>that</b> <b>she</b> was raped, a fact that makes it hard for Melinda to heal and continue with her life. Melinda attempts to confide in her ex-best friend Rachel, but she doesn't believe her. Only when Andy angrily confronts her about talking to Rachel and attempts to rape her again, Melinda fights back and finally break her silence, which sets her free from her isolation and terror.|$|R

500|$|The plaintiffs appealed and {{the case}} went before the Alberta Supreme Court appeals {{division}} in January 1935. [...] On February2, by a 3–2 decision, the court upheld Ives' ruling. [...] The majority ruling by Chief Justice Horace Harvey cast serious doubts on MacMillan's credibility, calling her story [...] "quite unsupported by other evidence" [...] and noting that she [...] "showed a readiness <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> may have been mistaken as regards very positive statements previously made when by the questions it appeared there may be independent evidence she was wrong". [...] In addition to agreeing with Ives on the points of law, {{he felt that the}} jury had not based its finding of fact on the evidence in the case. [...] Justices Mitchell and Ford concurred. [...] Justice Clarke, in dissent, agreed that MacMillan's story was unlikely, but expressed a willingness to defer to the jury on questions of fact. [...] On the legal questions, he cited a precedent written by Justice Harvey himself in which the chief justice had argued that the inclusion of seduced women as potential plaintiffs under the Seduction Act proved that its framers intended a broader definition of damage than financial damage. [...] Justice Lunney concurred. [...] The court was unanimous in upholding Ives' dismissal of Allan MacMillan's action, and he did not appeal further.|$|E
500|$|When {{developing}} {{the characteristics of}} their version of Lois Lane, the writers took inspiration from other leading ladies in cinema, for example, Karen Allen's character Marion Ravenwood, from Raiders of the Lost Ark. Todd Slavkin describes the character as having a [...] "sophisticated, worldly experience", and {{was considered to be}} more of an adult {{than the rest of the}} cast. Durance believes that she embodies many of the characteristics that the creative team wanted to show in their version of Lois, specifically the fact that Lois has a lot of [...] "nervous energy" [...] from trying to [...] "find herself", the same nervous energy that Durance brings to the role. The actress also relates to Lois's sassy, and independent nature, but, conversely, she is not as extroverted as Lois. Gough describes the character as coming from the school of hard knocks; she is street smart, and a very capable woman. Durance believes her character is [...] "fiercely independent", but at the same time she is not afraid <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> has flaws, and she is only human; Lois also does not feel sorry about having those flaws. She goes into further detail, identifying the character as more of a tomboy who is vulnerable, with Gough adding that she is also [...] "slightly neurotic". BuddyTV's John Kubicek characterizes her as a fast-talking woman, who, though she whines over petty annoyances, can take care of herself. He goes on to further describe how she is not afraid of getting herself into trouble just so she can dig herself out.|$|E
2500|$|Constable Karen Pelly (Tara Spencer-Nairn) is Dog River's ambitious, {{sometimes}} neurotic junior police officer. Before {{becoming a}} police officer, she ranked fifth in Canada {{in the sport}} of static apnea, with a personal best of more than six minutes. She's a very good cook, but does not like {{to bring it up}} for fear it will stereotype her. She does not want <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> does not know how to ride a bike. She is also at least 10 years younger than most of the other characters, turning 30 in the sixth season. Karen possesses a variety of skills including cooking, martial arts, drums, drawing, and table hockey; but when she wins a raffle in the sixth season, she says it's the first time she ever won anything. She tends to take her police position very seriously, unlike her partner Davis, and treats even the most minor problem officially. On one occasion, when she mentions to Davis that she feels she has a good lead on a cold case, he stares at her dumbfounded and asks [...] "Why?" [...] Karen frequently becomes annoyed with Davis' willingness to obey the mayor in everything and bend rules. They differ greatly on their views of what a police officer should portray; on one occasion, Karen states that [...] "a police officer should be respected by the community", to which Davis casually replies [...] "Who said that?" [...] Many episodes see them engaged in petty disputes and going to great lengths to one-up each other. Despite their differences, Karen and Davis get along well although they don't spend much time together outside of work. In the episode [...] "Hook, Line and Sinker" [...] Karen goes fishing with Hank and is seduced by his [...] "sexy fish talk". After the end of the series, she falls in love and marries; in , Karen's husband {{is said to be a}} soldier stationed off the Mediterranean coast, and they are expecting their first child.|$|E
