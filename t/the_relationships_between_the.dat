5|$|The monophyly of Malacostraca {{is widely}} accepted. This is {{supported}} by several common morphological traits which are present throughout the group and is confirmed by molecular studies. However, {{a number of problems}} make it difficult to determine <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> orders of Malacostraca. These include differences in mutation rates in different lineages, different patterns of evolution being apparent in different sources of data, including convergent evolution, and long branch attraction.|$|E

5|$|All the {{families}} were formerly treated {{as part of}} a single order, Mecoptera. <b>The</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> families are however a matter of debate. The cladogram, from Cracraft and Donoghue 2004, places the Nannochoristidae as a separate order, with the Boreidae, sister to the Siphonaptera, also as its own order. The Eomeropidae is suggested to be sister {{to the rest of the}} Mecoptera, with the position of the Bittacidae unclear. Of those other families, the Meropeidae is the most basal, and the relationships of the rest not completely clear.|$|E

5|$|More recent {{research}} from art historians such as Lorne Campbell relies on X-ray and infrared photography {{to develop an}} understanding of the techniques and materials used by the painters. The conservation of the Ghent Altarpiece in the mid-1950s pioneered methodologies and scholarship in technical studies. Examination of paint layers and underlayers was later applied to other Netherlandish works, allowing for more accurate attributions. Van Eyck's work, for example, typically shows underdrawings unlike Christus' work. These discoveries, too, hint at <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> masters of the first rank and those in the following generations, with Memling's underdrawings clearly showing van der Weyden's influence.|$|E
5|$|Morphologically, {{the dark}} colour of the gills and stem, {{lack of a}} strong taste, and {{characters}} of the cystidia (large cells found on the mushrooms) are the most distinguishing characteristics of X.setulipes. These features allow the species to be readily distinguished from other, similar species, including X.cauticinalis and X.brunneola. Its ecology and habitat are also distinct, but {{it is unclear whether}} they can serve as certain identifying characteristics. Within the genus Xeromphalina, X.setulipes is classified in the section Mutabiles, along with several other species. It seems most closely related to X.fraxinophila, X.cornui, X.campanelloides and X.cauticinalis, but, according to Esteve-Raventós and colleagues, further analysis is required to accurately judge <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> species of Xeromphalina.|$|E
5|$|The {{classification}} of birds is a contentious issue. Sibley and Ahlquist's Phylogeny and Classification of Birds (1990) is a landmark {{work on the}} {{classification of}} birds, although it is frequently debated and constantly revised. Most evidence seems to suggest the assignment of orders is accurate, but scientists disagree about <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> orders themselves; evidence from modern bird anatomy, fossils and DNA have all been {{brought to bear on}} the problem, but no strong consensus has emerged. More recently, new fossil and molecular evidence is providing an increasingly clear picture of the evolution of modern bird orders.|$|E

5|$|During the Cold War Era, <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> First World, Second World and the Third World {{were very}} rigid. The First World and Second World were at {{constant}} odds {{with one another}} via the tensions between their two cores, the United States and the Soviet Union, respectively. The Cold War, {{by virtue of its}} name, was a primarily ideological struggle between the First and Second Worlds, or more specifically, the U.S. and the Soviet Union. Multiple doctrines and plans dominated Cold War dynamics including the Truman Doctrine, Marshall Plan (from the U.S) and the Molotov Plan (from the Soviet Union). The extent of the odds between the two worlds is evident in Berlin—which was then split into East and West. To stop citizens in East Berlin from having too much exposure to the capitalist West, the Soviet Union put up the Berlin Wall within the actual city.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} story, Nagisa is {{introduced}} {{to other students}} {{from each of the}} three schools; some she admires, some she is intimidated by, and some are merely friends encountered while attending St. Miator. The series encompasses the relationships the characters build with each other, climaxing whenever two of the characters start dating. The central focuses of Strawberry Panic! are the lesbian relationships and friendships between the girls from the three schools and the Etoile position and competition; the anime is more relationship-heavy while the manga is more competition-heavy. The story of what happens to the other half of St. Miator's Etoile pairing is explored in the latter portion of the anime. Depending on the media type, the depiction of <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> girls is variously presented, with more explicit fan service– appealing visuals of the girls in provocative situations– in the anime adaptation than in the manga or light novels. A hint of astronomical star imagery is seen throughout the series, as well as minor Catholic religious undertones including a St. Mary statue on campus and a large Catholic church in the center of Astraea Hill.|$|E
5|$|Paleoptera and Neoptera are {{the winged}} orders of insects {{differentiated}} {{by the presence}} of hardened body parts called sclerites, and in the Neoptera, muscles that allow their wings to fold flatly over the abdomen. Neoptera can further be divided into incomplete metamorphosis-based (Polyneoptera and Paraneoptera) and complete metamorphosis-based groups. It has proved difficult to clarify <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> orders in Polyneoptera because of constant new findings calling for revision of the taxa. For example, the Paraneoptera {{have turned out to be}} more closely related to the Endopterygota than to the rest of the Exopterygota. The recent molecular finding that the traditional louse orders Mallophaga and Anoplura are derived from within Psocoptera has led to the new taxon Psocodea. Phasmatodea and Embiidina have been suggested to form the Eukinolabia. Mantodea, Blattodea, and Isoptera are thought to form a monophyletic group termed Dictyoptera.|$|E

5|$|Since the 1990s archaeological {{research}} at Gedi and other Swahili coastal settlements has intensified. From the 1980s archaeological research increasingly {{began to focus}} more on <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> coastal communities and their internal development, challenging the original notion that the development of the Swahili Coast was driven by foreign influence through Indian Ocean trade or by Arab colonists. Another important development in the study of Swahili coastal sites is the increased attention given to remains of structures that were not built of stone. Surveys of the open terrain at Gedi found dense concentrations of mud-thatched dwellings. In 2001, Stephane Pradines from the Institute Francias d'Archeologie Orientale and archaeologists from the National Museum of Kenya conducted a topographical survey of Gedi, which mapped the distribution of neighborhoods in order to investigate the site's urban development. Concurrently, Lynn Koplin conducted surveys of the mud-thatch neighborhoods, focusing on the area between the inner and outer walls. From 2002 to 2003, {{research at}} Gedi continued to focus on urban development prior to the fifteenth century, with focus on a group of coral houses built by social elites in the site's urban core.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Union never {{participated in}} the Eurovision Song Contest, but it made several {{attempts}} in the late 1980s. In 2009, Eduard Fomin, a former employee of the Ministry of Education of the RSFSR, revealed that in 1987 George Veselov, the Minister of Education for the Soviet Union, brought forward the idea of Soviet participation in the Eurovision Song Contest due {{to the number of}} political reforms made by the General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union Mikhail Gorbachev during the late 1980s. The idea was mainly a political one, with the thought that a win in the contest for the Soviet Union would impact on <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> Soviet Union and the capitalist countries of the west. Valery Leontyev was suggested as a singer for the Soviet Union's first entry into the contest, but Veselov's ideas were not shared by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, or by Gorbachev himself, believing it to be too radical a step to take, and so the Soviet Union never entered the contest before dissolving.|$|E
5|$|The {{most widely}} used {{approach}} to multiple sequence alignments uses a heuristic search known as progressive technique (also known as the hierarchical or tree method) developed by Paulien Hogeweg and Ben Hesper in 1984. Progressive alignment builds up a final MSA by combining pairwise alignments beginning with the most similar pair and progressing to the most distantly related. All progressive alignment methods require two stages: a first stage in which <b>the</b> <b>relationships</b> <b>between</b> <b>the</b> sequences are represented as a tree, called a guide tree, and a second step in which the MSA is built by adding the sequences sequentially to the growing MSA according to the guide tree. The initial guide tree is determined by an efficient clustering method such as neighbor-joining or UPGMA, and may use distances {{based on the number}} of identical two letter sub-sequences (as in FASTA rather than a dynamic programming alignment).|$|E
