50|$|Energy {{certificates}} issued under {{national legislation}} are normally {{used to provide}} evidence of compliance with an obligation on electricity producers, suppliers or consumers to use energy of a specific type or {{in order to qualify}} for financial support: qualifying plant are often high-quality cogenerators, or produce electricity from renewable sources. Examples of this within Europe are the Renewable Obligation Certificates (ROCs) issued under the Renewables Obligation, and Levy Exemption Certificates (LECs) issued under the Climate Change Levy - originally part of the Finance Act 2001 - within the UK; Certificati Verdi within Italy; Elcerts within Sweden; and also within the three regions (Brussels, Flanders and Wallonia) of Belgium. At the time of writing, almost all such support schemes are national in character only, the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>certificates</b> to and from other countries not being the intention of the policymakers. A notable exception is the Climate Change Levy: LECs are issued by the UK regulator to electricity producers both in the UK and in a number of European countries and exported to the UK, where they are purchased as proof of production of renewable energy production.|$|E
40|$|Public key {{infrastructure}} (PKI) is {{a powerful}} tool for protecting information. Currently a PKI system shows a trend toward an emerging global PKI which becomes more complicated. The global PKI has to handle an enormous number of queries for cryptographic certificates which attest the authenticity of public keys. So a decentralized organization of the PKI is advantageously. Therefore we developed a specialized Peer-to-Peer-PKI model realizing efficient search and <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>certificates</b> and trust-recommendations. Our model based on our own rigorous binary tree algorithm and has four advantages. First, there is no any bottleneck problem when establishing a certification path or authenticating. Second, the authentication path is short with two constant logic steps. Third, in our model the entities need to mutual authenticate don’t need to inquire or download the CRL. Fourth, it’s easy to extend and suitable for large-scale network. 1...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT [...] -Security of SCADA (supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) {{has become}} a {{challenging}} issue today because of its connectivity {{with the outside world}} and remote access to the system. One major challenge in the SCADA systems is securing the data over the communication channel. PKI (public key infrastructure) is a well known framework for securing the communication. In SCADA system, due to limited bandwidth and rare communications among some RTUs (Remote Terminal Units), there is a need of customization of general PKI which can reduce the openness of Public Key, frequent <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>certificates</b> and reduction in DOS (Denial of Service) attacks at MTUs (Master Terminal Units) and RTUs. This paper intends to address the issues of securing data over communication channel in the constrained environment and presents the novel solutions pivoted on key distribution and key management schemes. This paper also presents a set of innovative methods of multicast and broadcast of messages in SCADA system...|$|E
