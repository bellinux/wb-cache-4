5|$|June 23, 2001: An {{isolated}} supercell produced three tornadoes in the state. The first, an F1, hit a {{golf course}} in Washington, demolishing a storage building and a tennis court, and injuring one person. The second tornado, rated an F2, touched down in <b>Torrington</b> near <b>Torrington</b> Middle School, damaging the roof and destroying bleachers and a storage shed. The final tornado, an F0, produced minor damage to the East Hartland fire station.|$|E
5|$|Benbow's next post was as Master Attendant of Chatham Dockyard. He {{then moved}} to become Master Attendant at Deptford Dockyard in early March 1690, a post he {{intermittently}} held {{for the next six}} years. He was master of HMS Sovereign in summer 1690, under his old commander Arthur Herbert, now Lord <b>Torrington.</b> He was assigned to act as master of the fleet, and took part in the English defeat in the Battle of Beachy Head. After the defeat, a Royal Commission was held into the circumstances that led to it. Benbow was highly regarded as a specialist in both navigation and pilotage, and his evidence given in July 1690 to the preliminary investigation strongly favoured his old patron, <b>Torrington.</b> He did not however testify during Torrington's court-martial in December that year.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{defendants}} were then indicted for {{breaking into the}} house of Josiah Dewey in Littleport, stealing money and property and assaulting Dewey. Mr Gurney addressed the jury. Three witnesses testified. The jury recorded a verdict of guilty against Chevall, Easey, Jessop, South and Benton; Dann and <b>Torrington</b> were acquitted. The court adjourned at 5pm.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Fox {{started the}} Fox, Fowler and Company bank in Wellington which rapidly {{expanded}} and ran successfully, until it merged with Lloyds Bank in 1927. It {{was the last}} private bank in England to issue its own notes and they were legal tender until 1964. There are nine notes left in circulation. The British Museum have another example on display. The bank established its Head Office at the old family house in Fore Street, Wellington (today the Lloyds Bank branch) - they opened branches at Taunton, Bridgwater, Weston-super-Mare, <b>Torrington,</b> Bideford, Barnstaple, Ilfracombe and South Molton.|$|E
5|$|Damage from Diane was {{heaviest}} in Connecticut, where rainfall {{peaked at}} 16.86in (428mm) near <b>Torrington.</b> The storm produced the state's largest flood on record, which effectively split the state into two by destroying bridges and cutting communications. All major streams and valleys were flooded, and 30stream gauges reported their highest levels on record. The Connecticut River at Hartford reached a water level of 30.6ft (9.3m), the third highest on record there. The flooding destroyed a large section of downtown Winsted, {{much of which}} was never rebuilt. Record-high tides and flooded rivers heavily damaged Woonsocket, Rhode Island. In Massachusetts, flood water levels surpassed those during the 1938 Long Island hurricane, breaching multiple dams and inundating adjacent towns and roads. Throughout New England, 206dams were damaged or destroyed, and about 7,000people were injured. Nationwide, Diane killed at least 184people and destroyed 813houses, with another 14,000homes heavily damaged. Monetary losses totaled $754.7million, although the inclusion of loss of business and personal revenue increased the total to over $1billion. In the hurricane's wake, eight states were declared federal disaster areas, and the name Diane was retired.|$|E
5|$|In 1952 she met Nicholas Heron, {{with whom}} she entered into a relationship. An engraver, {{photographer}} and former journalist for the Brighton Argus, he shared her interest in the occult, and together they developed a magical system based upon Luciferianism, the veneration of the deity Lucifer, or Lumiel, whom they {{considered to be a}} benevolent angelic deity. In 1956, they founded the Order of the Morning Star, or Ordo Stella Matutina (OSM), propagating it through a correspondence course. The couple sent out lessons to those who paid the necessary fees over a series of weeks, eventually leading to the twelfth lesson, which contained The Book of Lumiel, a short work written by Montalban that documented her understanding of Lumiel, or Lucifer, and his involvement with humankind. The couple initially lived together in <b>Torrington</b> Place, London, from where they ran the course, but in 1961 moved to the coastal town of Southsea in Essex, where there was greater room for Heron's engraving equipment.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{the young}} would-be {{candidate}} {{was offered the}} opportunity of succeeding the party leader, Clement Davies, in the Welsh seat of Montgomeryshire, when Davies decided to retire. There being no immediate prospect of that, Thorpe looked elsewhere, in particular to Devon and Cornwall, where the party had long-standing traditions and had polled respectably in 1950 and 1951. In these elections Thorpe had assisted the Liberal candidate for North Cornwall, Dingle Foot, whose agent recommended him to the neighbouring North Devon constituency. The <b>Torrington</b> local party was also anxious to adopt Thorpe as their candidate, while Foot saw him as a possible successor in North Cornwall. Thorpe chose to fight North Devon, a seat once held by the Liberals although, in 1951, the party had finished in third place behind Conservative and Labour, with less than 20% of the vote.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} day, 10 July, off Beachy Head near Eastbourne, <b>Torrington</b> advanced {{towards the}} French in line of battle. He placed the Dutch white squadron with 21 ships – commanded by Cornelis Evertsen – in the van. <b>Torrington</b> {{was in the}} centre red squadron; the rear blue squadron, commanded by Vice-Admiral Ralph Delaval, comprised English and Dutch ships.|$|E
25|$|In William's absence, Queen Mary and her advisors – the 'Council of Nine' – {{hastened to}} take {{measures}} for the defence of the country. Carmarthen {{thought that it was}} advisable to fight, as did Nottingham and Admiral Russell, who were unconvinced that the French were as strong as <b>Torrington</b> reported and considered that only the admiral's pessimism, defeatism or treachery could account for his reports. As the two fleets moved slowly up the channel (with <b>Torrington</b> keeping carefully out of range), Russell drafted the order to fight. Countersigned by Nottingham, the orders reached the admiral on 9 July whilst he was off Beachy Head. <b>Torrington</b> realised that not to give battle was to be guilty of direct disobedience; to give battle was, in his judgment, to incur serious risk of defeat. <b>Torrington</b> called a council of war with his flag-officers, who concluded that they had no option but to obey.|$|E
25|$|The University of Connecticut at <b>Torrington,</b> {{founded in}} 1957, was closed May 2016 due to low {{enrollment}} numbers.|$|E
25|$|The Byng vault {{includes}} George Viscount <b>Torrington,</b> Rear Admiral {{who died}} in 1732 and Admiral John Byng, executed 1757.|$|E
25|$|Ebersol {{was born}} in <b>Torrington,</b> Connecticut, the son of Mary (née Duncan) and Charles Roberts Ebersol, a former {{chairman}} of the American Cancer Society.|$|E
25|$|Torrington's fleet {{reached the}} Isle of Wight and {{was joined by}} a Dutch {{squadron}} {{under the command of}} Cornelis Evertsen. On 5 July, <b>Torrington</b> sighted the French fleet, calculating their strength at almost 80 ships of the line. Unable to proceed to the westward to link up with Shovell and Killigrew (who was on his way home), <b>Torrington</b> announced his intention of retreating before the superior French fleet to the Straits of Dover, believing that the risk to the fleet in being would be too great.|$|E
25|$|The English squadrons {{rallied to}} the main fleet. By the end of August the Allies had 90 vessels {{cruising}} the Channel – temporary French control {{had come to an}} end. <b>Torrington</b> had been sent to the Tower of London to await a court martial at Chatham. The substance of the charge was that he had withdrawn and kept back, had not done his utmost to damage the enemy and to assist his own and the Dutch ships. <b>Torrington</b> blamed the defeat on the lack of naval preparations and intelligence – he had not been informed that the Brest fleet had been reinforced with the Toulon squadron. He also contended that the Dutch had engaged too early, before they had reached the head of the French line. To the outrage and astonishment of William and his ministers – and the delight of the English seamen who, rightly or wrongly, regarded him as a political sacrifice to the Dutch – the court acquitted him. <b>Torrington</b> took up his seat in the House of Lords but William refused to see him and dismissed him from the service on 12 December (O.S). <b>Torrington</b> was temporarily replaced by a triumvirate of Sir Henry Killigrew, John Ashby and Sir Richard Haddock; these were in turn replaced by Admiral Russell as sole commander of the English fleet.|$|E
25|$|The North Devon-based {{helicopter}} {{is located}} at Eaglescott Airfield, previously at Belle Vue Airfield, near Great <b>Torrington.</b> A new Eurocopter EC135P2+ entered service flying out of Eaglescott in September 2013; it is registered G-DVAA and replaces G-DAAT.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of the rail network made local small-scale kilns generally unprofitable, but Annery had closed in around 1864, before the local railway was opened. Local competition from the lime kilns at <b>Torrington</b> and elsewhere would have been intense.|$|E
25|$|In November 1950, Pablo Picasso, {{a fellow}} communist, {{en route to}} a Soviet-sponsored World Peace Congress in Sheffield created a mural in Bernal's flat at the top of No.22 <b>Torrington</b> Square. In 2007 this became part of the Wellcome Trust's {{collection}} for £250,000.|$|E
25|$|John Brown {{was born}} May 9, 1800, in <b>Torrington,</b> Connecticut. He {{was the fourth}} of the eight {{children}} of Owen Brown (1771–1856) and Ruth Mills (1772–1808) and grandson of Capt. John Brown (1728–1776). Brown could trace his ancestry back to 17th-century English Puritans.|$|E
25|$|Loughton Town Council {{placed a}} Blue Plaque at 164 <b>Torrington</b> Drive to commemorate its famous former resident. On 23 August 2014, exactly 100 {{years to the}} hour from when he defended the bridge at Mons, a {{commemorative}} service was held at his graveside.|$|E
25|$|The eight-hour {{battle was}} {{a victory for the}} French but far from decisive. When the tide changed at 21:00, the Allies weighed anchor. Tourville pursued, but instead of {{ordering}} a general chase, he maintained the strict line-of-battle, reducing the speed of the fleet to that of the slower ships. <b>Torrington</b> burnt six more badly-damaged Dutch ships (Noorderkwartier, Gekroonde Burg, Maagd van Enkhuizen, Elswout, Tholen and the fireship Maagd van Enkhuizen) and one English ship (the third rate 70-gun Anne) to avoid their capture before gaining the refuge of the Thames. The Wapen van Utrecht sank by herself. As soon as <b>Torrington</b> was in the safety of the river, he ordered all the navigation buoys removed, making any attempt to follow him too dangerous.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} residence, Southill Park, {{was one of}} {{at least}} four manors, and was for three generations {{the home of the}} local branch of the landed Byng family, the Viscounts <b>Torrington,</b> Navy admirals, by whom it was sold {{at the end of the}} 18th century to industrialist Samuel Whitbread.|$|E
25|$|Tourville was criticised for not {{following}} up his victory and was relieved of his command. English Admiral <b>Torrington</b> – who had advised against engaging the superior French fleet {{but had been}} overruled by Queen Mary and her ministers – was court-martialled for his performance during the battle. Although he was acquitted, King William dismissed him from the service.|$|E
25|$|Thirteen {{ships were}} built to these specifications, again all by {{contract}} - the Anglesea, <b>Torrington,</b> Hector, Roebuck, Lark, Pearl, Mary Galley, Ludlow Castle, Fowey, Looe, Poole, Southsea Castle and Chesterfield. Three further ships followed a slightly amended design, with the depth in hold increased by a further 5inches - the Prince Edward, another Anglesea and Thetis.|$|E
25|$|Jane's {{relationship}} with the Queen was close, but it became strained {{for a short period}} when rumours circulated that Jane was to remarry. Lord <b>Torrington</b> mentioned the possibility of her remarriage to Robert St Clair-Erskine, Lord Loughborough, but shortly afterwards, Jane personally denied that there was any truth in it. Other suitors included Count Cavour, the Piedmontese leader.|$|E
25|$|Robert Davidson died {{suddenly}} on October 10, 1982, of a coronary occlusion in Charlotte Hungerford Hospital in <b>Torrington,</b> Connecticut. He was interred in East Cemetery in Litchfield, Connecticut. On September 30, 2010, Anne Davidson died {{at home in}} Litchfield and following a funeral service in the First Congregational Church; United Church of Christ was also interred in East Cemetery.|$|E
25|$|The main Allied fleet under Admiral <b>Torrington</b> was {{stationed}} in the English Channel; {{a substantial part of}} the fleet was in the Mediterranean under Vice Admiral Henry Killigrew, which the Earl of Nottingham, William's Secretary of State and chosen naval advisor, hoped would neutralize the French Toulon squadron. Sir Cloudesley Shovell remained in the Irish Sea but his squadron was much too small to stop the French controlling these waters if they chose to do so. The French decided not to use their fleet as a subsidiary to the Irish campaign; King Louis XIV instead directed his navy against <b>Torrington</b> in the Channel. Although 6,000 French troops under the command of the Comte de Lauzun were ferried across to Ireland to aid James on 17 March, the French fleet under the Comte de Tourville returned to Brest on 1 May and there remained inactive during May and June, whilst the grand fleet was assembling.|$|E
25|$|Annery {{was well}} built, with local mortar-cemented stones, a rubble infill and firebricks lining the kilns' {{combustion}} chambers. The various openings to the kilns have rounded or pointed Gothic arches formed from bricks. The now lost crenellated 'battlements' construction {{was similar to}} other kilns such as those at Yeo Vale on the Torridge, south-west of Bideford and those at <b>Torrington.</b>|$|E
25|$|At age 16, Hartness {{began his}} career in machine shops. At age 21 he became a foreman at the Winsted-Norway Bolt Company in Winsted, Connecticut. He moved in 1886 to <b>Torrington,</b> Connecticut {{to work as a}} tool-maker and foreman at the Union Hardware Company. His {{lifetime}} achievement of more than 100 patents began here with patents of locks, roller skates, and bicycle pedal mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|Barlow {{enjoyed a}} lengthy {{retirement}} in Canterbury and in 1840 was restored to naval service {{in order to}} receive a belated promotion to full admiral and advancement to Knight Grand Cross. He died at the archbishop's palace in Canterbury in May 1843. His wife had predeceased him by 26 years, but two of his daughters had married well, wedding George Byng, 6th Viscount <b>Torrington</b> and William Nelson, 1st Earl Nelson.|$|E
25|$|The 1716 Establishment of Guns for {{the larger}} fifth rates had removed the four smaller guns from the {{quarterdeck}} and instead added a tenth pair of guns on the lower deck, turning them from 42 to 40 guns. However the lower deck guns were now 12-pounders instead of the former 9-pounders. Thirteen vessels were rebuilt to this specification - the Hector, Anglesea, Diamond, Mary Galley, Ludlow Castle, Pearl, Kinsale, Lark, Adventure, Roebuck, <b>Torrington,</b> Princess Louisa and Southsea Castle.|$|E
25|$|Bridgeport {{has several}} major roadways. Interstate 95 and the Route 8/Route 25 Connector meet in {{downtown}} Bridgeport. I-95 runs east-west near the coast heading towards New York City {{to the southwest}} and Providence to the northeast. Routes 8 and 25 run north-south across the city, with the two routes splitting {{just north of the}} city. Route 8 continues towards Waterbury and <b>Torrington</b> and Route 25 continues towards the Danbury area. Both Routes 8 and 25 connect to the Merritt Parkway in the adjacent town of Trumbull.|$|E
25|$|A {{threefold}} cord {{to unite}} soules for ever unto God. 1. The mysterie of godlinesse opened. 2. The imitation of Christ proposed. 3. The crowne of afflicted saints promised. As it was compacted by M. Richard Head, M.A.and sometimes {{minister of the}} Gospel, in his labours at Great <b>Torrington</b> in Devon. Published now, after his death, for publike profit (London: Printed by E.P. for Fr. Coles, and are to be sold at his shop in the Old-Bayly, at the Signe of the Halfe-Bowle, 1647).|$|E
25|$|The kiln had {{excellent}} communications, originally being sited simply {{next to the}} river, but gaining {{later the}} additions of the canal, the road between Bideford and <b>Torrington,</b> {{as well as the}} new Half-Penny toll-bridge across the Torridge to Weare Giffard, built in 1835 by Lord Rolle and Mr Tardrew. In Devon the demand for agricultural lime in the 19th century was very high, and farmers from a wide area collected loads of lime from Annery, by pack-horse at first and later using wagons, They arrived sometimes as early as 4am to ensure a supply for the day.|$|E
25|$|Byng {{was then}} given power to {{negotiate}} with the various princes and states of Italy on behalf of the English crown. Following his return to England, Byng became both Treasurer of the Navy and Rear-Admiral of Great Britain on 21 October 1720. He was admitted to the Privy Council on 3 January 1721 and, having stepped down from the Admiralty Board in September 1721, was created Baron Byng of Southill in the county of Bedford, and 1st Viscount <b>Torrington</b> in Devon on 21 September 1721. He developed his estate at Southill Park in Bedfordshire in the 1720s.|$|E
25|$|After evading Killigrew off Cadiz, the Toulon {{squadron}} (Château-Renault) joined Tourville's fleet on 21 June. Tourville, {{commanding the}} combined Brest and Mediterranean fleets, with 75 ships {{of the line}} and 23 fireships, sailed on 23 June into the Channel; by 30 June, the French were off the Lizard. <b>Torrington</b> sailed from the Nore, already convinced the French would be stronger – much of the Royal Navy had been diverted to protect their maritime commerce from privateers and the Allied fleet had only 56 English and Dutch ships of the line, with 4,153 guns, against the French fleet of 4,600 guns.|$|E
