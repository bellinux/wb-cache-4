5|$|Among its {{weaknesses}} {{were the}} positioning of its gatehouse, {{on the wrong}} side of the castle, facing away from the road, and <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> windows in the hall, reaching down to the ground and making access relatively easy to any intruder.

5|$|Average wage {{rates in}} the Soviet Union were {{published}} relatively rarely. Some academics in the West believed this was because the Soviet government wanted to conceal low average earnings. Alec Nove wrote in 1966 (when wage statistics were published {{for the first time}} since the Second World War) that the lack of transparency surrounding average wages was intended to prevent Soviet workers from discovering <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> disparities that existed between wages in different sectors of the Soviet economy.|$|E

5|$|Calisthenics, {{especially}} as done in <b>the</b> <b>huge</b> formations favored at the time, could be boring, {{and at the}} high school and college levels, games such as baseball and rugby were more often spectator sports than a practical source of physical exercise for the masses.
