5|$|The {{disappearance}} of Chandra Levy {{became a national}} topic {{of the news media}} in the summer of 2001, with 63 percent of Americans closely following the case. The media swamped Levy's parents from the moment they decided <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington,</b> D.C. in search of their daughter. According to Condit, there were about a hundred reporters camped out in front of his apartment during the morning of September 11, 2001, but they all left after news spread about that day's terrorist attacks in New York and Washington. Media critics and cable news executives later cited the Levy case, as well as the concurrent sensationalist coverage of a string of shark attacks, as a reflection of the manner of news coverage in the United States before the September 11 attacks had taken priority.|$|E

25|$|After {{arriving}} in Bannack, Idaho Territory, Edgerton reported to Territorial Governor William Wallace. Edgerton requested {{the designation of}} courts and districts, but no court was designated for his district. Wallace appointed Edgerton {{to one of the}} farthest and most remote places away from the capitol. When he arrived there was no administrator to administer the oath of office. He never took the oath of office and therefore he never legally took his position as Chief Justice. The Edgerton's then bought a home at a Sheriff's sale for $400. The one room home became the first Montana Governor's Residence. After {{arriving in}} his district, he began taking tours of the territory gold fields and gold camps. Edgerton realized the value of the gold fields, to the Union. He was then chosen, by the local population, <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> D.C.. His mission was to lobby for the split of the Territory of Idaho. Edgerton and Sanders then left in a stagecoach for Washington. Edgerton arrived with $2,500 in gold nuggets in his pockets (about $34,000 in 2009). He presented this to President Abraham Lincoln and numerous members of Congress. His lobbying paid off in 1864. That year the Territory of Idaho split into three parts. The three parts included the Territory of Idaho, the Territory of Montana, and the Territory of Dakota.|$|E

He traveled to Buffalo on September 10; hearing on his arrival an account of the President's recovery, Hay responded that McKinley would die. He was more cheerful after visiting McKinley, giving a statement to the press, and went to Washington, as Roosevelt and other officials also dispersed. [...] Hay was about to return to New Hampshire on the 13th, when word came that McKinley was dying. [...] Hay remained at his office and the next morning, on the way to Buffalo, the former Rough Rider received from Hay his first communication as head of state, officially informing President Roosevelt of McKinley's death.|$|E

2500|$|While Gilda was in release, it {{was widely}} {{reported}} that an atomic bomb which {{was scheduled to be}} tested at Bikini Atoll in the Pacific Ocean's Marshall Islands would bear an image of Hayworth, a reference to her bombshell status. Although the gesture was undoubtedly meant as a compliment, Hayworth was deeply offended. Orson Welles, then married to Hayworth, recalled her anger in an interview with biographer Barbara Leaming: [...] "Rita used to fly into terrible rages all the time, but the angriest was when she found out that they'd put her on the atom bomb. Rita almost went insane, she was so angry. â€¦ She wanted <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> to hold a press conference, but Harry Cohn wouldn't let her because it would be unpatriotic." [...] Welles tried to persuade Hayworth that the whole business was not a publicity stunt on Cohn's part, that it was simply homage to her from the flight crew.|$|E
2500|$|Lamon's {{professional}} association with Lincoln started in 1852. Lamon became the prosecuting {{attorney for the}} Old Eighth Judicial district and subsequently moved to Bloomington, Illinois, in 1858. [...] While Lamon had Southern sympathies and his hatred of abolitionism set him apart from Lincoln, they remained friends, despite their very different characters. Lamon joined the then-young Republican Party and campaigned for Lincoln in 1860. [...] Lincoln was up against New York Senator William Seward for the Republican nomination, and Lamon proved his friendship by printing up extra tickets for the convention to fill the hall with Lincoln supporters. [...] When Lincoln was elected President, Lamon hoped for a foreign diplomatic post, but {{received a letter from}} his friend that said, [...] "Dear Hill, I need you. [...] I want you <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> with me and be prepared for a long stay."

2500|$|When Dana {{left the}} Tribune, Secretary of War, Edwin Stanton, {{immediately}} {{made him a}} special Investigating Agent of the War Department during the American Civil War. In this capacity, Dana discovered frauds committed by quartermasters and contractors. As {{the eyes of the}} administration, as Abraham Lincoln called him, Dana spent much time at the front, and sent to [...] War Secretary Edwin Stanton frequent reports concerning the capacity and methods of various generals in the field. In particular, the War Department was concerned about rumors of Ulysses S. Grant's alcoholism. Dana spent considerable time with Grant, becoming a close friend and assuaging administration concerns. Dana reported to Secretary of War Edwin Stanton that he found Grant [...] "modest, honest, and judicial[...] [...] [...] 'not an original or brilliant man, but sincere, thoughtful, deep, and gifted with a courage that never faltered.' Although quiet and hard to know, he loved a humorous story and the company of his friends." [...] Dana also observed the growing problem of cotton speculators, who were often going beyond established limits into rebel territory with the purpose of trading and often collaborating with the rebels. Dana warned President Lincoln and Stanton that the cotton trading and all related activity needed to be stopped, maintaining that general Grant was in full agreement with his assessment and recommendations. Dana went through the Vicksburg Campaign and was present at the Battle of Chickamauga and the Chattanooga Campaign. He urged placing General Grant in supreme command of all the armies in the field, which happened in March 1864. After returning to Washington Dana received a telegram from assistant Secretary of War H.P. Watson, instructing him <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>Washington</b> to pursue another investigation, and was received by Stanton, who offered him the position of Assistant Secretary of War, which he accepted. It was reported in the New york papers the next morning. Dana held this position from 1863 to 1865. With the likely exception of John Rawlins, Dana had a greater influence over Grant's military career than any other political or military man.|$|E
