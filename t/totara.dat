25|$|A well-attended dawn {{ceremony}} {{conducted by}} Tupuna Maunga Authority took place upon Maungakiekie on 11 June 2016 planting nine young <b>tōtara</b> and pōhutukawa grown from parent {{trees on the}} hill. A kiekie will be added later.|$|E
25|$|Having {{divided the}} land into 100 acre block, the {{settlers}} set about clearing {{the land of}} its indigenous forest and turning it into farmland. Sawmillers milled larger trees, such as <b>Totara,</b> for building materials and burned off the remaining scrub and underbrush.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{sections}} of podocarp forest in Westland New Zealand are found around 43° latitude, where they grow {{from the western}} coastal region along the Tasman Sea up to the Southern Alps. Rimu-kamahi forest is common in this area, along with mountain <b>tōtara</b> and southern rātā.|$|E
25|$|Pollen {{analysis}} in the sediments of the Waitetuna arm of the harbour shows that the original vegetation was kahikatea on the flats, and a mixed podocarp-hardwood forest on the slopes, with <b>totara,</b> maire, matai, rimu, rata, beech and tree ferns. Kauri was present, but not abundant.|$|E
25|$|Previous to the {{construction}} of the Kinleith Mill, and the current Kinleith Branch line, a private bush tramway operated by the Taupo <b>Totara</b> Timber (TTT) Company, used to operate along the route of the present line along its path between Putaruru and the company's mill at Mokai, near Taupo.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} pohutukawa and grass areas, {{there is a}} {{southern}} patch of mature tanekaha and a northern patch of puriri (ripe red berries) and taraire. Other large trees include rewarewa, mapou, kowhai, <b>totara,</b> tree ferns, cabbage trees, and kahikatea. Kanuka {{can be found on}} the slopes of the Te Puru creek (the estuarine mangrove salt marsh).|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, {{significant}} travel delays {{were being}} experienced through Upper Hutt, with State Highway 2 traffic travelling from Lower Hutt and Wellington to central Upper Hutt and further afield to the Wairarapa being funnelled down the two-lane Fergusson Drive and mixing with local traffic through Silverstream and Trentham. With central government reluctant to fund any road {{improvements in the}} area, the Upper Hutt City Council commissioned {{the construction of a}} two-laned high-speed bypass {{along the banks of the}} Hutt River from the Taita Gorge in the south to Māoribank in the north. River Road, as the road became to be known, opened in 1987. It promptly ran at full capacity and, after several serious accidents that were a legacy of its origins, it was enlarged and re-engineered to cope with the growing traffic volume. Today, River Road is a median-divided 2+1 road from the Taita Gorge to <b>Totara</b> Park, with two-laned undivided sections over the Moonshine Bridge and from <b>Totara</b> Park to Maoribank.|$|E

25|$|In 1903 the Taupo <b>Totara</b> Timber Company (TTT Co) {{constructed}} an 82km tramway to link their milling centre at Mokai {{with the}} New Zealand Government Railways line (NZR) at Putaruru. The line was {{built over the}} former Lichfield Branch line, which was originally built by the Thames Valley and Rotorua Railway Company {{to be part of}} the line to Rotorua. The TTT Co line then went onwards south of Lichfield through what are now Tokoroa and Kinleith and crossed the Waikato River at Ongaroto.|$|E
25|$|At Ongaroto {{the company}} built a large timber bridge of locally sourced <b>totara,</b> {{designed}} by Public Works Department engineer Frederick Furkert. In later years this timber bridge deteriorated and was condemned, {{but the company}} {{could not afford to}} replace it immediately because its sawmill had burned down in 1928. In the last few years of service, trains arriving at the bridge would stop and the passengers and fireman would walk across while the driver gently opened the throttle and then jumped off. The train would slowly ease across the bridge before being stopped on the other side by the fireman, where everyone would reboard the train. This bridge was replaced in 1931 by a steel truss bridge with a central pier.|$|E
25|$|Before European {{settlement}} Papanui, {{like much}} of Christchurch, was mostly marshy ground covered with native flax, toetoe and raupō brush. There was an abundance of forest birds which were hunted for food by the area's Māori inhabitants. It is believed in 1800 possibly as many as 5000 Māori lived in Canterbury, but from disease like measles and influenza, introduced through the early whaling settlements on Banks Peninsula, and through tribal wars the number had fallen to around 500 in 1840. While most of the plains in the South Island of New Zealand were deforested by either the Māori or the so-called moa hunters in the mid-1300s, Papanui Bush {{was one of the}} few stands of pine and <b>totara</b> left in the Canterbury region at the time of European colonisation.|$|E
500|$|The huia {{inhabited}} {{both of the}} {{two principal}} forest types in New Zealand. They were primarily found in broadleaf-podocarp forests {{where there was a}} dense understorey, but occasionally also in southern beech (Nothofagus) forest. The species was observed in native vegetation including mataī (Prumnopitys taxifolia), rimu (Dacrydium cupressinum), kahikatea (Dacrycarpus dacrydioides), northern rātā (Metrosideros robusta), maire (Nestegis), hinau [...] (Elaeocarpus dentatus), <b>totara</b> (Podocarpus <b>totara),</b> rewarewa (Knightia excelsa), mahoe (Melicytus ramiflorus), and taraire (Beilschmiedia tarairi), and at sea level in karaka (Corynocarpus laevigatus) trees at Cape Turakirae. It was never seen in burnt forest or land cleared for farming.|$|E
500|$|The Catlins {{features}} dense temperate rainforest, {{dominated by}} podocarps. This {{is the largest}} area of native forest remaining on the South Island's east coast, with over [...] of forest and neighbouring subalpine areas being protected in Catlins Conservation Park. The forest is thick with trees such as rimu, <b>totara,</b> silver beech, matai and kahikatea. Of particular note are the virgin rimu and <b>totara</b> forest remaining in those areas which were too rugged or steep to have been milled by early settlers, and an extensive area of silver beech forest close to the Takahopa River. This is New Zealand's most southerly expanse of beech forest. Many native species of forest plant {{can be found in}} the undergrowth of the Catlins forest, including young lancewoods, orchids such as the spider orchid and perching Easter orchid, and many different native ferns.|$|E
500|$|It {{seems that}} the kakapo – like many of New Zealand's bird species – has evolved to occupy an {{ecological}} niche normally filled by various species of mammal (the only non-marine mammals native to New Zealand are [...] ). Before the arrival of humans, the kakapo was distributed throughout the three main islands of New Zealand. It lived {{in a variety of}} habitats, including tussocklands, scrublands and coastal areas. It also inhabited forests dominated by podocarps (rimu, matai, kahikatea, <b>totara),</b> beeches, tawa, and rata. In Fiordland, areas of avalanche and slip debris with regenerating and heavily fruiting vegetation – such as five finger, wineberry, bush lawyer, tutu, hebes, and coprosmas – became known as [...] "kakapo gardens".|$|E
500|$|In {{breeding}} years, {{the loud}} booming calls {{of the males}} at their mating arenas {{made it easy for}} Māori hunting parties to track the kakapo down, and it was also hunted while feeding or when dust-bathing in dry weather. The bird was caught, generally at night, using snares, pitfall traps, or by groups of domesticated Polynesian dogs which accompanied hunting parties – sometimes they would use fire sticks of various sorts to dazzle a bird in the darkness, stopping it in their tracks and making the capture easier. Cooking was done in a hāngi or in gourds of boiling oil. The flesh of the bird could be preserved in its own fat and stored in containers for later consumption – hunters of the Ngāi Tahu tribe would pack the flesh in baskets made from the inner bark of <b>totara</b> tree or in containers constructed from kelp. Bundles of kakapo tail feathers were attached to the sides of these containers to provide decoration and a way to identify their contents. Also taken by the Māori were the bird's eggs, which are described as whitish [...] "but not pure white", and about the same size as a kererū egg.|$|E
2500|$|When Auckland {{was founded}} as a colonial town a tree {{stood near the}} summit which gave the hill its English name. Two {{accounts}} identify it as a pōhutukawa (Metrosideros excelsa). This tree was cut down by a white settler in 1852, {{in an act of}} vandalism in one account, or for firewood in another. It seems likely this was a different tree from the <b>tōtara</b> (Podocarpus <b>totara)</b> which, as a sacred tree, had given the hill one of its Maori names. A radiata pine was planted in the 1870s to replace the previous <b>tōtara</b> [...] John Logan Campbell repeatedly tried to grow native trees on the hill's summit, but the trees failed to survive - with only two pines, originally part of a shelter belt for the native trees, surviving for long. However, in 1960, one of the two was felled in another attack, possibly for firewood.|$|E
2500|$|... 20th century: Last century Kakahi was a King Country sawmill town, {{with four}} timber mills around the township, many tram lines for moving the timber (mainly <b>totara).</b> Kakahi also had three churches, one hotel (burned to the ground), one {{boarding}} {{house and a}} pool hall. [...] It still has the active Kakahi Primary School (...) , the Kakahi General Store (also a post office), and the Kakahi Hall (which has been restored to full function by the community).|$|E
2500|$|From 5 December 1881, {{a herd of}} 10,000 Merino/Lincoln and Leicester crossbreed sheep on NZALC's <b>Totara</b> Estate near Oamaru was {{slaughtered}} at a purpose-built slaughter works {{close to}} the railhead there. [...] The carcases were sent overnight by goods trains with a central block of ice to be loaded on the Dunedin, where they were sewn into calico bags and frozen. To prove the process, the first frozen carcases were taken off the ship, thawed and cut.|$|E
2500|$|St Joseph's School was {{established}} by the Dominican Sisters and the Christian Brothers. It is the only Catholic primary school in North Otago. [...] , it has a roll of just over 200 and it caters for students up to Year 8. There are no longer any Sisters or Brothers on the staff and the school is run and managed by lay people. Other primary schools in Oamaru and the surrounding areas include; North School, Fenwick School, Weston School, Ardgowan School, Oamaru Intermediate School and <b>Totara</b> School.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{development}} of pastoralism and the associated frozen-meat industry having its historical origins in New Zealand {{just south of the}} town at <b>Totara,</b> Oamaru flourished. Institutions such as the Athenaeum and Waitaki Boys' and Waitaki Girls' High Schools sprang up. The locally plentiful limestone (Oamaru stone) lent itself to carving and good designers, such as Thomas Forrester (1838-1907) and his son J.M. Forrester (1865–1965), and craftsmen utilised it. By the time of the depression of the 1880s Oamaru had become the [...] "best built and most mortgaged town in Australasia".|$|E
2500|$|When {{the pilgrims}} {{first began to}} settle in Christchurch in the early 1851, Papanui Bush {{attracted}} a number of [...] who made a living from milling <b>totara</b> and pine timber for construction and fire wood. Near the bush a settlement sprung up along on the old Maori track leading north to Kaiapoi which eventually became the Main North Road. The settlement soon boasted a hotel, store, blacksmiths, clothing shop, butchers, chemist, dispensers, and a school room appeared in 1853. Due to the pressing need for building materials in Christchurch, Papanui Road {{was one of the}} first roads built outside the city boundaries. The Papanui Bridge was also built over the Avon River in March 1852 to allow the timber to be brought by bullock drawn wagons directly into the Market Square near the city centre. It is interesting to note that in 1857 sawmilling had attracted a population of 692 to the Papanui village compared with 953 in Christchurch in the same year.|$|E
2500|$|A few notable bridges, sans rails, {{still stand}} on the route to Ross, {{including}} an impressive truss bridge over the <b>Totara</b> River just north of Ross itself and a smaller truss bridge over the Mahinapua Creek 5km south of Hokitika that is now protected by the New Zealand Department of Conservation. [...] The route between Ruatapu and Ross is largely out of sight from the road, but can be driven for much of its length and is used as an accessway by some locals. From Hokitika to Ruatapu, the railway's formation is readily apparent as it is often near the road, and the road has even been diverted to use portions of it. [...] Little else remains of the railway due {{to the passage of}} time and influence of human and natural activity, but at the site of Ross's yard, some twisted rail and a loading bank remain. In March 2010 work was started on clearing the Ruatapa - Ross section for use by cyclists. However, the long-term future of this is somewhat in doubt due to gold prospecting in the area. A number of bridges still exist in this section and are being refurbished as part of the cycle track. The West Coast Wilderness Trail from Hokitika to Ross, which incorporates the former railway route from Ruatapu south, opened on 24 October 2015.|$|E
60|$|The {{trees were}} {{for the most part}} pines of {{different}} varieties, but differing so widely in appearance from those Wilfrid had seen in England, that had not Mr. Mitford assured him that they were really pines he would never have guessed they belonged to that family. Mr. Mitford gave him the native names of many of them. The <b>totara</b> matai were among the largest and most beautiful. The rimu was distinguished by its hanging leaves and branches, the tanekaha by its parsley-shaped leaves. Among them towered up the poplar-shaped rewarewa and the hinau, whose fruit Mr. Mitford said was the favourite food of the parrots.|$|E
