5|$|In Reformed churches, only believing Christians are {{expected}} to partake of the Lord's Supper. Further, partakers {{are expected}} to examine and prepare themselves for the sacrament. This involves determining whether one acknowledges their sinfulness and has faith in Christ to forgive them. Christians may have some degree of doubt regarding their salvation, but they are at least {{to be aware of}} their sin and have a desire <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>faith.</b>|$|E
5|$|Many of Model's fellow {{officers}} considered him a Nazi. He frequently harangued his troops <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>faith</b> in the Führer and uphold {{the virtues of}} National Socialism. He accepted the offer of SS-Gruppenführer Hermann Fegelein to appoint a Waffen-SS officer as his adjutant at Army Group North in 1944, after the Heerespersonalamt had refused him an adjutant, and filled the Nationalsozialistischer Führungsoffizier (NSFO, essentially a Nazi political commissar) post at Army Group B that had been vacant before his arrival. His habit of parroting the Führer's orders caused him {{to be viewed as}} a sycophant, even if he often undermined or ignored those orders in practice.|$|E
5|$|The court {{passed the}} {{judgement}} while hearing two Public Interest Litigations on related issues. While the first, filed by advocate Arvind Shukla, had sought direction to the Election Commission to derecognise Mr Raj Thackeray's MNS for his controversial remarks against North Indians, the other one, filed by RU Upadhyay, sought {{protection for the}} North Indians in Maharashtra and compensation {{to those who had}} suffered from the attacks. The court, however, refused to pass any direction {{on the grounds that the}} issue was related to the aspect of law and order, and it thus directed the petitioners <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>faith</b> in the Bombay High Court and seek further hearing there.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{entering}} Philo's penthouse suite, Lenny finds another SQUID disc and Philo's {{body on the}} floor, whose {{brain has}} been damaged {{in the same manner}} as Tick's. After watching the disc, Lenny discovers that Max and Faith have become lovers and that they forced Philo to run an amplified recording of them having sex. Max and Faith then enter the room, explaining that they set Philo up because he wanted <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>Faith</b> killed for what she knew about Jeriko's death, and that he now intends to frame Lenny for Philo's murder. After a hand-to-hand fight, Lenny throws Max off the balcony to his death. Meanwhile, on the street, Mace is pursued by Steckler and Engelman, but she manages to subdue them with the help of Strickland, who saw the proof behind Jeriko's death. Lenny then finds Mace and the two share a passionate kiss as the crowd celebrates the turn of the new century around them.|$|E

In community life {{the people who live}} the Sodalit spirituality are meant <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>faith</b> which they share and celebrate, living like a family {{in the same way as}} the disciples of Jesus gathered around Mary. Members of the Sodalitium and its spiritual family come together as friends with the same belief, to share the life of faith, where each person should be for the others a motivation of fervor, humility, prayer, reverence, joy, work, ministry and solidarity.|$|E
25|$|German {{reaction}} to the French Revolution was mixed at first. German intellectuals celebrated the outbreak, hoping to see the triumph of Reason and The Enlightenment. The royal courts in Vienna and Berlin denounced {{the overthrow of the}} king and the threatened spread of notions of liberty, equality, and fraternity. By 1793, the execution of the French king and the onset of the Terror disillusioned the Bildungsbürgertum (educated middle classes). Reformers said the solution was <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>faith</b> in the ability of Germans to reform their laws and institutions in peaceful fashion.|$|E

25|$|President Narayanan in {{his speeches}} {{consistently}} sought {{to remind the}} nation of its duties and obligations towards the Dalits and Adivasis, the minorities, and the poor and downtrodden. He called the nation's attention to various recalcitrant social ills and evils, such as atrocities against women and children, caste discrimination and the ingrained attitudes it nurtured, abuse {{of the environment and}} public utilities, corruption and lack of accountability in the delivery of public services, religious fundamentalism, advertisement-driven consumerism, and flouting of human rights, and lamented the absence of public concern, political debate, and civic action to address them. Drawing from the experiences of his own home state Kerala, he pointed out that education was at the root of human and economic development. He hoped that the establishment would not fear the awakening of the masses through education, and spoke of the need <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>faith</b> in the people.|$|E
500|$|After leaving England, Eko assumes his brother's identity, {{serving as}} a priest in Australia under the name Father Tunde. A monsignor asks him to {{investigate}} a reported miracle of a young lady who has {{come back to life}} after drowning. The girl's father, Richard Malkin, dismisses the miracle as an act of incompetence by the undertaker, claiming the girl was suffering from severe hypothermia and the doctor misdiagnosed her as a result. Eko soon prepares to board Oceanic Airlines Flight 815; shortly after buying a ticket, he encounters the girl whom the investigation is about. She tells Eko [...] she saw Yemi as she was [...] "between places", and his brother had a message for him <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>faith.</b>|$|E
500|$|The {{scientific}} community rejects astrology as having no explanatory power for describing the universe, and considers it a pseudoscience. Scientific testing of astrology has been conducted, and no {{evidence has been}} found to support any of the premises or purported effects outlined in astrological traditions. There is no proposed mechanism of action by which the positions and motions of stars and planets could affect people and events on Earth that does not contradict well understood, basic aspects of biology and physics. [...] Those who continue <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>faith</b> in astrology have been characterised as doing so [...] "...in {{spite of the fact that}} there is no verified scientific basis for their beliefs, and indeed that there is strong evidence to the contrary." ...|$|E

500|$|In the Reformed tradition, baptism's {{function}} as a rite of initiation into the church is secondary to its {{function as}} a sign of God's promise of grace. Reformed theologians distinguish between the visible church, which consists of those who publicly claim <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>faith</b> in Christ as well as their children; and the invisible church, which consists of those who actually have faith and have been regenerated. Baptism is believed to make one a member of the visible, rather than the invisible church. It is believed to be impossible to know {{who is a member of}} the invisible church. As members of the visible church, baptized Christians are believed to have obligations to live in love and service to Christ and his people. The fulfillment of these obligations is referred to as the [...] "improvement" [...] of one's baptism.|$|E
500|$|Griffith {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>faith</b> in Neuer {{during the}} exhibition season, {{and said he}} could potentially be [...] "one of the greatest ever in the twirling line." [...] Instead of working on his control during that time, which was considered the main thing he needed to work on, he practiced throwing the knuckleball and spitball. Griffith encouraged him to do so, believing that developing these trick pitches {{would allow him to}} become a great pitcher, and as a result, he practiced these pitches until, according to one sportswriter, [...] "he was so wild he couldn’t hit the grand stand." [...] In one exhibition game against Atlanta, he appeared in relief of Jack Chesbro, and allowed four runs in less than an inning due to his lack of control. His pitching continued to get worse, {{and by the end of}} spring training he was sent to the Newark Indians of the Eastern League. He never returned to the major leagues, becoming the only person to throw a shutout in both his major league debut and his final game.|$|E
500|$|In a twist from expectation, Eliot's poem {{suggests}} that old men {{should go out}} and explore. He warns that people should trade wisdom for pointless experience and argues that men should explore human experience itself. This concept is hinted of in The Waste Land and draws from the ideas within Dante's Convivio. Dante argues that old men are supposed to return to God and describes the process in a way similar to the travels of Odysseus. Unlike Homer's hero, Dante argues that men should not travel in the material world but in the spiritual world. Both Dante and Eliot put forth a similar view to St. Augustine when they focus on internal travels. Through these travels, mankind is able <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>faith</b> in salvation and {{able to see that}} there is more to the world than darkness. Eliot explains within the poem that we are all interconnected through time and that we must realize this. Only through this realization is mankind able to understand the truth of the universe. This, in turn, would allow humanity to break free from the burden of time. As Russel Kirk explains: [...] "That end, for those who apprehend a reality superior to 'birth, copulation, and death'—a reality transcending the rhythms of physical nature—is to know God and enjoy Him forever." ...|$|E

[...] End of Show writer Kirsty Walker comments that fans on Twitter accused Moran of [...] "deliberately egging on the 'shippers'." [...] Moran noted in his blog that {{of the thousands of}} messages from viewers, the [...] "vast majority" [...] were extremely positive, managing to express that they were [...] "upset, angry and shocked" [...] without making personal attacks. Moran declared the response from other commentators to be unacceptable, describing their conduct as the spewing of insults and [...] "passive aggressive nonsense". He noted that fans had accused him of deliberately trying to [...] "mislead", [...] "lie" [...] and [...] "hurt" [...] them, said that he hated them, was [...] "laughing at them" [...] and [...] "slapping [...] in the face", and claimed that he had [...] "killed the show", had attempted to drive away existing fans to court newer and [...] "cooler" [...] viewers, and had deliberately hurt depressed people [...] "with dark storylines." [...] In a poll conducted by Digital Spy shortly after Ianto's death, 27.4% of voters claimed that they would no longer watch Torchwood. Responding to these results, Gareth David-Lloyd thanked the fans for their dedication to the show and the character but urged them <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>faith</b> in the writers. On the show's Facebook groups, fans expressed anger towards creator Russell T Davies and some claimed they would stop watching the show.
