5|$|It {{has been}} a {{struggle}} telling this story over the years, {{because a lot of}} people don't want <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> this kind of history.

5|$|One {{group of}} Corregidor prisoners, before first {{entering}} the camp, had each hidden {{a piece of}} a radio under their clothing, to later be reassembled into a working device. When the Japanese had an American radio technician fix their radios, he stole parts. The prisoners thus had several radios to listen to newscasts on radio stations as far away as San Francisco, allowing the POWs <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> the status of the war. A smuggled camera was used to document the camp's living conditions. Prisoners also constructed weapons and smuggled ammunition into the camp for the possibility of securing a handgun.|$|E

5|$|The Enterprise {{enters the}} neutral zone, to {{investigate}} the distress call of a Talarian freighter. The freighter is badly damaged, and three life forms are detected aboard. An away team beams over and finds three Klingons: Korris (Vaughn Armstrong); Konmel (Charles Hyman); and Kunivas (Robert Bauer), who is wounded. The away team returns {{with them to the}} Enterprise before the freighter explodes. Kunivas is taken to sickbay and Korris meets with Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart). The Klingon explains that they were passengers when the freighter was attacked by a Ferengi ship; the Klingons took over the freighter to fend off and destroy the Ferengi ship, but the damage sustained left the freighter adrift and faltering. As Korris and Konmel are shown to quarters, they are surprised <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> a fellow Klingon, Lt. Worf (Michael Dorn), who is serving within Starfleet.|$|E

Moore had recently made an offer to the Royal Society to pay for the establishment of an observatory.

Charles appointed a Royal Commission to examine the proposal in December 1674, consisting of Lord Brouncker, Seth Ward, Samuel Moreland, Christopher Wren, Silius Titus, John Pell and Robert Hooke.|$|E
25|$|Elliot and Doherty {{remained}} friends {{after the}} band's break-up, while Elliot {{had a hit}} solo show. She eventually asked Doherty to marry her, but he declined. He released a few solo LPs and singles during this period, two of note being 1971's Watcha Gonna Do? and 1974's Waiting for a Song, the latter of which went unreleased in the US. Featuring both Michelle and Cass on background vocals, the recordings would be Elliot's last, as she died after a sold-out run in London {{a few months later}} after the record was finished. Doherty was stunned and saddened <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> her death in 1974 at age 32. He attended her funeral several days later in early August along with the Phillipses.|$|E

25|$|In July 1810, {{shortly before}} {{completion}} of the lines, Fletcher left the fortifications to serve alongside Wellington once more in the field, and was thus at the Battle of Buçaco (27 September 1810) where he again distinguished himself and was mentioned in dispatches. Wellington fell back to the Lines of Torres Vedras in October 1810, pursued by Marshal Masséna, who was shocked to find such extensive defences, having been promised by Portuguese rebels that the road to Lisbon was an easy one. Wellington's superiors were equally surprised <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> the defences when they later received his report. After an unsuccessful attack on 18 October, Masséna initially retreated to Santarém but when his supplies ran out the following March, he abandoned any thoughts of another attempt and headed north.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of 1538, when the troops were {{exhausted}} after almost two years in foreign terrain, the soldiers asked what was their payment for the conquest they had done. De Quesada divided the conquered treasures over his men; 40,000 pieces of fine gold, 562 emeralds and tumbaga (gold-copper-silver alloys). Foot soldiers received 520 pieces each, horse riders the double amount, captains 2080 pieces, generals 3640 and some pieces were given as prizes for the most distinguished soldiers. Masses were organised to honour the many dead soldiers during the campaign {{and part of the}} treasure was given to Juan de las Casas. De Quesada was not pleased <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> the advancement of another group of conquistadors in the east, led by Nikolaus Federmann, coming from later Venezuela across the Llanos Orientales. Another team of conquerors, commanded by Sebastián de Belalcázar, was coming from the south, originating from Quito. Gonzalo sent Hernán to meet the southern group who had traveled through the hot valley of Neiva.|$|E

25|$|Throughout 1916 morale in {{the factory}} went slowly downhill, but nothing was done to {{alleviate}} the problem, although consultations were going on between Whitehall and Birtley {{on how best to}} deal with any unrest that night occur {{in the factory}}. Another problem was that in practice the Colony was policed by Belgian gendarmes but in theory they were working under British rule of law, very different from their own. As just one example, back home the gendarmes were allowed to carry pistols at all times: here they were not allowed to be armed except under special circumstances and only then with the approval of the British police. Finally, on 20 December 1916, it all came to a head. One of the workers went to see Captain Algrain, Military Head of Security, in order to obtain four days leave, to which he was entitled to. Suddenly the captain noticed that the man, though wearing his regulation uniform, was sporting a civilian cap. Enraged at this ‘breach of discipline’, he had the man sent directly to the cells for four days, to join two others who had attempted to leave the camp in civvies. The rest of the workforce quickly got <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> this unjust act.|$|E

Whereas Rolling Stone had declared in 1973 that Harrison had [...] "inherited the most precious Beatle legacy – the spiritual aura that the group accumulated", now the magazine's album reviewer attacked him for his [...] "insufferable" [...] spiritual preoccupations. Writing in the NME, Woffinden similarly dismissed Dark Horse as [...] "the product of a complete egotist ... someone whose universe is confined to himself. And his guru." [...] Privately, Harrison descended into a [...] "spiritual funk", Tillery writes. Another biographer, Joshua Greene, concludes of Harrison's post-tour mindset: [...] "He grappled with the depressing realization that most people simply didn't care <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>about</b> Krishna or maya or getting liberated from birth and death ...
