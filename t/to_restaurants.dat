5|$|After the war, Emeco {{started selling}} 1006 chairs to prisons, {{hospitals}} and government offices. The chair was sold <b>to</b> <b>restaurants</b> in the 1980s and 1990s, under Jay Buchbinder's leadership, {{then as a}} designer chair in the 2000s after Emeco was acquired by his son, Gregg.

5|$|Authentic bird's nest soup is {{made from}} the nests of the edible-nest swiftlet (or white-nest swiftlet), Aerodramus fuciphagus, and the black-nest swiftlet, Aerodramus maximus. Instead of {{incorporating}} twigs, feathers and straw like others in the genus, these two swiftlets make their nest only from strands of their gummy saliva, which harden when exposed to air. Once the nests are harvested, they are cleaned and sold <b>to</b> <b>restaurants.</b> Over the past twenty years, the high demand for the nests of these Aerodramus species has had an adverse effect on their populations. The Niah caves population of black-nest swiftlets plunged from around 1.5 million pairs in 1959 to 150,000–298,000 pairs in the early 1990s through over-harvesting.|$|E

25|$|In Toronto, blockos are {{a form of}} block party {{based on}} a {{tradition}} of outdoor gatherings in the West Indies. They are held by neighbours and outreach workers, particularly during the city's warm, humid summers. Daytime activities are focused on children, and the evenings provide an alternative for residents who cannot afford to go out <b>to</b> <b>restaurants,</b> clubs, etc. Since the 1970s many blockos have been held each year at Toronto Community Housing Corporation (TCHC) developments without incident.|$|E
25|$|Annie began {{trapping}} {{before the}} age of seven, and shooting and hunting by age eight, to support her siblings and her widowed mother.

25|$|Another {{creative}} idea {{to create}} more revenue, was the establishment of Graakalbanens Isforretning A/S.

It was sold in blocks and crushed <b>to</b> <b>restaurants,</b> ships, fish exporters and private households. This remained in service until the 1940s, after which the branch line was removed.|$|E

40|$|While {{the term}} {{restaurant}} revenue management was defined in this journal in 1998, {{the history of}} publications in the Cornell Hospitality Quarterly (CHQ) related <b>to</b> managing <b>restaurant</b> profitability spans nearly fifty years. Of the 160 published articles related <b>to</b> <b>restaurant</b> profitability, more than one-quarter {{have appeared in the}} CHQ, which is more than three times that of any other journal. This article presents a new, decision-based framework for restaurant profitability, which expands on the earlier revenue-focused framework. The existing CHQ articles are categorized using the framework, and the gaps are used as the basis for identifying a large number of worthwhile, but as yet unanswered research questions related <b>to</b> <b>restaurant</b> profitability...|$|R

25|$|Although the pataca is {{the legal}} tender of Macau, the Hong Kong dollar is almost universally {{acceptable}} in the Region, and in some cases, is preferred to the Pataca. Circulation of the pataca is mandated by a decree (Decreto-Lei n.º 16/95/M) prohibiting refusal by merchants, but some casinos flout this rule and refuse bets in patacas. The Hong Kong dollar and Chinese yuan are generally accepted throughout Macau from casinos <b>to</b> <b>restaurants.</b> Payments to government agencies can also be made in both Hong Kong dollars and patacas.|$|E
25|$|The North End, {{generally}} {{defined as}} the part of Boise north of State Street, contains many of the city's older homes. It {{is known for its}} tree-lined drives such as Harrison Boulevard, and for its quiet neighborhoods near the downtown area. Downtown Boise is visible from Camel's Back Park. On 13th Street, Hyde Park is home <b>to</b> <b>restaurants</b> and other businesses. The North End also hosts events such as the annual Hyde Park Street Fair. In 2008, the American Planning Association (APA) designated Boise's North End one of 10 Great Neighborhoods.|$|E
25|$|In 1924 artist Lucius Wolcott Hitchcock {{introduced}} Montague to illustrator Coles Phillips, also {{a resident}} of New Rochelle. A noted pigeon fancier, Phillips suggested to Montague that {{they could make a}} substantial amount of money raising and selling squabs <b>to</b> <b>restaurants</b> and hotels. The breed chosen was the red carneau. Together they bought four acres of land on Webster Avenue near the Wykagyl Country Club, built a row of pigeon houses and installed 4,000 birds. The result, called the Silver Ring Squab Farm, had set the two back a total of $15,000.|$|E

25|$|Storer, Holmen and Pedersen {{describes}} a netchain {{built around a}} food processor. The food processor uses the output of a meat and a vegetable processor and sells food <b>to</b> <b>restaurants.</b> The meat and vegetable processors are using the output of primary producers, whereas the restaurants serve consumers and {{are connected to the}} vegetable processor and the meat processor as well. Moreover, primary producers also share information with the food processor. The main purpose of the entire food chain/network is to serve consumer needs and they need to cooperate to achieve this. As a result, a strongly connected system is formed, which can be described as a netchain.|$|E
25|$|In modern times, {{the extent}} of dog {{consumption}} in China varies by region. It is most prevalent in Guangdong, Yunnan and Guangxi, {{as well as the}} northern provinces of Heilongjiang, Jilin and Liaoning. It is common to find dog meat served in restaurants in Southern China, where dogs are reared on farms for consumption (however, there are also instances of finding stolen pet meat on menus). In 2012, Chinese netizens and the Chinese police intercepted trucks transporting caged dogs to be slaughtered in localities such as Chongqing and Kunming. In 2014, 11 people in the Hunan province were sentenced to prison for allegedly poisoning over 1,000 dogs and selling the poisonous meat <b>to</b> <b>restaurants.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{historic}} core of {{the town}} lies around the parish church and along the High Street. With {{the building of the}} railway line and station in 1852, the town began to grow towards the new station, along what is today Sandford Avenue. Since {{the first half of the}} 20th century the two main streets of the town centre are the High Street and Sandford Avenue. In the later decades of the 20th century a number of shops on the southern end of High Street changed use <b>to</b> <b>restaurants</b> or purely residential, as Sandford Avenue became the pre-eminent shopping street. The B5477 takes the name Shrewsbury Road north from the town centre, High Street within the town centre, and Ludlow Road south of there.|$|E
