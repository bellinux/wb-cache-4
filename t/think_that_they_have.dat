500|$|It {{is not yet}} {{known whether}} the medial pallium plays a similar role in even more {{primitive}} vertebrates, such as sharks and rays, or even lampreys and hagfish. [...] Some types of insects, and molluscs such as the octopus, also have strong spatial learning and navigation abilities, but these appear to work differently from the mammalian spatial system, so there is as yet no good reason to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> a common evolutionary origin; nor is there sufficient similarity in brain structure to enable anything resembling a [...] "hippocampus" [...] to be identified in these species. Some have proposed, however, that the insect's mushroom bodies may have a function {{similar to that of}} the hippocampus.|$|E
500|$|Eliminativism {{maintains}} that the common-sense understanding of the mind is mistaken, and that the neurosciences will one day reveal that the mental states that are talked about in everyday discourse, using words such as [...] "intend", [...] "believe", [...] "desire", and [...] "love", do not refer to anything real. Because of the inadequacy of natural languages, people mistakenly <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> such beliefs and desires. Some eliminativists, such as Frank Jackson, claim that consciousness does not exist except as an epiphenomenon of brain function; others, such as Georges Rey, claim that the concept will eventually be eliminated as neuroscience progresses. Consciousness and folk psychology are separate issues {{and it is possible}} to take an eliminative stance on one but not the other. The roots of eliminativism go back to the writings of Wilfred Sellars, W.V. Quine, Paul Feyerabend, and Richard Rorty. The term [...] "eliminative materialism" [...] was first introduced by James Cornman in 1968 while describing a version of physicalism endorsed by Rorty. The later Ludwig Wittgenstein was also an important inspiration for eliminativism, particularly with his attack on [...] "private objects" [...] as [...] "grammatical fictions".|$|E
500|$|Abductive logic {{has three}} parts. First, {{there is the}} {{surprising}} fact—also called the result—that both Mulder and Scully are hallucinating, despite not taking any drugs. Second, there is Scully's hypothesis—the rule—that, {{if it were true}} the hallucination [...] "would be a matter of course". Third, there is the conclusion—the case—that [...] "there is a reason to suspect [...] as true." [...] This abduction, Abrams and Cooke point out, is an example of creative abduction, because Scully manages to pull three, separate ideas [...] "creatively" [...] together. Mulder, however, next makes an abductive conclusion. While discussing the events with Skinner, he states that he is not convinced, because drugs do not wear off only when one notices their effects. This abduction also has three parts. The result is the surprising fact that Mulder and Scully's escape seems problematic. The rule is that Mulder and Scully only <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> escaped, but they really are still underground and being digested. Finally, the case states that [...] "there is reason to suspect that" [...] Mulder and Scully have not escaped from the mushroom. This type of logic is an example of undercoded abduction, because it is the most plausible rule among many.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of banknotes, precious or semi-precious metals minted into coins to certify their substance were widely used as a medium of exchange. The value that people attributed to coins was originally based upon the value of the metal unless they were token issues or had been debased. Banknotes were originally a claim for the coins held by the bank, but due to the ease with which they could be transferred and the confidence that people had in the capacity of the bank to settle the notes in coin if presented, they became a popular means of exchange in their own right. They now make up a very small proportion of the [...] "money" [...] that people <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> as demand deposit bank accounts and electronic payments have negated the need to carry notes and coins.|$|E
2500|$|Madonna's Russian {{shows in}} Moscow and Saint Petersburg {{were met with}} great controversy. Asked her stance on the arrest of feminist punk-rock band Pussy Riot, Madonna responded: [...] "I'm against censorship, and my whole career I've always {{promoted}} freedom of expression and freedom of speech so I think what's happening to them is unfair. And I hope that they don't have to serve 7 years in jail; {{that would be a}} tragedy. I think art should be political, that art, historically speaking, always reflects what's going on socially. So for me it's hard to separate being an artist and being political." [...] During her Moscow show, Madonna gave a speech in support of the band, saying [...] "...My dream, and my prayer, is that everyone in the world has the right to express their opinions and still be treated as human beings. I know there are many sides to every story, and I mean no disrespect to the Church, or the government, but I think that these three girls -- Nadezhda, Yekaterina, and Maria -- have done something courageous. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> paid the price for this act. And I pray for their freedom." [...] Madonna later appeared on stage with a temporary tattoo that said [...] "Pussy Riot" [...] on her back in place of the usual [...] "No Fear" [...] slogan, and performed [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] donning a balaclava covering her face, the band's trademark. It was considered an artistic statement against the oppression of the band's freedom of speech.|$|E

Many media outlets lauded Madonna's efforts, and other artists joined her in support of the band, among them Yoko Ono, Paul McCartney and Peter Gabriel. Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin, however, wrote an expletive-ridden Twitter post lambasting Madonna for backing the band: [...] "With age, every ex-slut tends to lecture everybody on morality. Especially during world tours and concerts." [...] Madonna's second Russian date in Saint Petersburg was consequently met with terrorist threats, prompting the U.S. Embassy to issue a warning to those in attendance. Madonna's spokesperson Liz Rosenberg responded that the concert would go on as scheduled and that Russian authorities would step up security for the date. Following threats of arrest by Russian officials if she spoke in support of gay rights and opposed the recent anti-gay law which prohibits [...] "public actions aimed at propaganda of sodomy, lesbianism, bisexuality, and transgenderism among minors", Madonna responded, on March 21, in a letter on her website saying she was a [...] "freedom fighter" [...] and would defend LGBT rights. Before the show, Madonna released pink wristbands to audience members in support of the LGBT community. In addition, hundreds brought rainbow flags to the show and waved them throughout.|$|E
