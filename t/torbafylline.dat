40|$|We {{addressed}} the issue of cross-reactivity of several commonly used phosphodiesterase inhibitors with radioimmunoassays for cyclic AMP, after we had observed a considerably high cross-reactivity with a noncommercial antibody. Theophylline, pentoxifylline, penthydroxifylline (BL 194), albifylline (HWA 138), <b>torbafylline</b> (HWA 448), A 80 2715, isobutyl methylxanthine, and the nonmethylxanthines amrinone and rolipram were dissolved in supplemented and boiled cell culture medium (RPMI 1640). These samples were assayed for apparent cyclic AMP in two different, commercially available radioimmunoassay kits (based on polyclonal antibodies), applying the nonacetylated protocol. Cross-reactivity was dose-dependent and nonlinear. Samples containing theophylline and amrinone exhibited the strongest cross-reactivity in assay A (NEN/DuPont) : 3. 0 +/- 0. 5 (-nM) and 2. 4 +/- 1. 1 (-nM) apparent cyclic AMP +/- SD at 1 -nM spike, respectively. With the more sensitive assay B (Amersham), higher concentrations of apparent cyclic AMP were detected: from 7. 9 +/- 0. 4 nM (for albifylline) to 3. 5 +/- 0. 1 nM (for rolipram). Values were calculated from standard curves set up in the respective assay buffer, where culture medium controls resulted in 1. 8 +/- 0. 3 nM and 3. 1 +/- 0. 1 nM for assay A and B, respectively. The culture medium interference increased with rising cyclic AMP concentrations. Although comparatively low, this degree of cross-reactivity is relevant for in vitro experiments. Phosphodiesterase inhibitors are commonly administered at millimolar concentrations, and resulting cyclic AMP levels are often in the nanomolar range. Neglecting these findings may lead to falsely high readouts of cyclic AMP concentrations...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of new pharmacological approaches for preventing muscle wasting in cancer is an important goal because cachectic patients display a reduced response to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Xanthine derivatives such as pentoxifylline inhibit tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) production, which has been implicated in the signalling of muscle wasting. However, the effect of pentoxifylline has been inconclusive in clinical trials. We report here the first direct evidence that daily injections of <b>torbafylline</b> (also known as HWA 448), another xanthine derivative, had no effect by itself on muscle proteolysis in control healthy rats. In cancer rats, the drug blocked the lipopolysaccharide-induced hyperproduction of TNF and prevented muscle wasting. In these animals HWA 448 suppressed the enhanced proteasome-dependent proteolysis, which is sensitive to the proteasome inhibitor MG 132, and the accumulation of high-molecular-mass ubiquitin (Ub) conjugates in the myofibrillar fraction. The drug also normalized the enhanced muscle expression of Ub, which prevails in the atrophying muscles from cancer rats. In contrast, HWA 448 did not reduce the increased expression of either the 14 kDa Ub conjugating enzyme E 2 or the ATPase and non-ATPase subunits of the 19 S regulatory complex of the 26 S proteasome, including the non-ATPase subunit S 5 a, which recognizes polyUb degradation signals. Finally, the drug also prevented muscle wasting in septic rats (which exhibit increased TNF production), and was much more potent than pentoxifylline or other xanthine derivatives. Taken together, the data indicate that HWA 448 is a powerful inhibitor of muscle wasting that blocks enhanced Ub-proteasome-dependent proteolysis in situations where TNF production rises, including cancer and sepsis...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} cooperative {{effects of}} phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors and prostanoids on {{cyclic adenosine monophosphate}} (cAMP) accumulation and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -alpha synthesis in human {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMC). PDE inhibitors alone induced only a small increase in cAMP levels in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) -stimulated PBMC. Cicaprost (a stable analogue of prostacyclin) and pentoxifylline added simultaneously to LPS-stimulated PBMC (2. 0 x 10 (6) /ml) induced a rapid increase of cAMP to a level of 100 nM that peaked within 10 min and remained at a plateau for up to 4 h. Thus combined prostanoids and PDE inhibitors enhanced cAMP accumulation. TNF-alpha suppression in the presence of pentoxifylline and prostanoids exceeded that of either drug alone. The potency of different PDE inhibitors (theophylline, pentoxifylline, penthydroxifylline, albifylline, <b>torbafylline,</b> A 80 2715, amrinone and rolipram) to increase cAMP levels in combination with cicaprost was evaluated after 1 h of incubation. The dose-dependent increase of cAMP for all PDE inhibitors tested in this combined stimulation provided a useful tool for evaluating the potency of PDE inhibitors on cAMP accumulation. The effective concentration of PDE inhibitors, which raised cAMP levels to 300 % of control, (EC 300), correlated with the IC 50 for TNF-alpha suppression (r = 0. 930, p = 0. 007, with theophylline excluded from the analysis). Interestingly, by contrast, the specific type IV PDE inhibitor rolipram caused only a moderate rise of accumulated cAMP in the same cells. Our data support cAMP as an essential mediator for TNF-alpha suppression by PDE inhibitors. Furthermore, an enhanced inhibiting effect on TNF-alpha production may prove therapeutically advantageous. It may occur in inflammatory and infectious diseases in vivo, since high levels of endogenous prostaglandins are liberated in these conditions...|$|E
