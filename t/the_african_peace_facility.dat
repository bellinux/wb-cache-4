40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the twenty-first century, the European Union has promoted, more explicitly than in earlier decades, the view that security and development policies are inextricably linked. Yet, trying to dismantle the walls erected around the two policy domains has proved very difficult. The launch and implementation of <b>the</b> <b>African</b> <b>Peace</b> <b>Facility</b> (APF), meant to support the African Union in the promotion of security in Africa, exemplifies some of these tensions. While existing analyses have emphasized the role of interests - in a sort of accidental convergence of the bureaucratic interest of the European Commission and those of the Member States - this article concentrates on the normative aspects of the initiative. In particular, the three principles underpinning it - promotion of ownership, solidarity, and a virtuous development-security nexus - make the APF different from any other EU security initiative. Whilst boosting the AU's clout in the field of peace and security and as an actor in the international arena, the implementation of the APF has nonetheless presented some problems. First, a larger number of resources have been devoted to the peace missions than to capacity building. Second, its alleged success has diverted attention from other important areas in EU-Africa relations. Finally, the EU's rhetoric on the Africanization of security, paradoxically, has risked undermining the legitimacy of the African Union in Africa...|$|E

Therefore, if Art 4 (h) is to be operationalised effectively, the ASF will have a significant role to play to prevent or stop mass atrocities on the continent. This chapter assesses how Art 4 (h) in particular, and civilian protection in general, has been addressed {{in the establishment of}} the ASF - more specifically in ongoing efforts to elaborate on doctrine, standard operating procedures and training needs for the continental standby arrangement. It identifies gaps between general political commitment and the emergent operational reality; and argues that there is an enduring need for appropriate guidance for the ASF as it prepares for future protection missions...|$|R
