40|$|A Committee on Agricultural Safety and Health Research and Extension {{was formed}} by the United States Department of Agriculture Cooperative State Research, Education, and Extension Service (USDA-CSREES) North Central Regional (NCR) Administrators in 2000. The goal of the committee, {{designated}} as NCR 197, was to more effectively use the land grant system 2 ̆ 7 s research and extension capacity {{in cooperation with the}} experience of those who live and work in agriculture to reduce work-related injuries, illness, death, and property loss. The NCR 197 Committee produced a landmark publication in 2003 titled, National Land Grant Research and Extension Agenda for Agricultural Safety and Health: National Agenda for Action. Twelve priorities for action were identified: Sensors and guarding systems Agricultural equipment on public roads Agriculture confined spaces Emerging technologies Human factors engineering and design Management of agricultural emergencies Livestock handling and housing systems Public policy issues Capital and management intensive vs. family labor intensive operations Fire detection and suppression Agricultural safety education and training Special populations and enterprises In 2007, the committee chose to develop a white paper on Agricultural Equipment on Public Roads. This white paper has multiple purposes: a) to help identify research, policy and extension/outreach priorities for the U. S. Departments of Agriculture and Transportation, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, state departments of agriculture, transportation and law enforcement, county government, and production agriculture based organizations; and b) to identify possible design and practice standards, goals, or guidelines for farm equipment manufacturers, standard setting organizations, and government agencies. Issues relating to operating agricultural equipment on public roads are multi-faceted and complex. This report looks at a number of issues, however, not all issues can be examined in the same detail because the literature in some areas is at best sparse. Issues addressed in this report include rural/urban <b>traffic</b> <b>interface,</b> state and federal regulations, higher speed tractors, and transport of workers on public roadways with farm equipment. Several suggestions in the areas of research, standards, education/outreach and policy have been developed to help guide future work {{as a result of this}} review...|$|E

The produced data volume per unit is numerated. The collected data is stored in a database and offers different analysis possibilities. The results can be visualized and adapted to the users requirements. The main effort was to build a data traffic quota system for single units as well as groups of devices that also report exceeded quotas. The system itself only observes the network <b>traffic.</b> <b>Interfaces</b> offer tools to interact with the network.

30|$|In this study, {{the method}} {{described}} in [21, 22] {{is used for}} bidirectional coupling between OMNeT++/MiXiM and SUMO, where the two simulators {{communicate with each other}} through a <b>traffic</b> control <b>interface</b> (TraCI) by transmitting TCP messages. Here OMNeT++/MiXiM acts as the TraCI client and SUMO acts as the TraCI server.|$|R
30|$|Since SUMO’s {{ability to}} save vehicle traces into files is limited, {{we chose to}} use the <b>traffic</b> control <b>interface</b> (TraCI) to connect a Java program via TCP {{connection}} to SUMO.

50|$|SiConnect's {{first product}} was the PLT050, which was {{launched}} in 2007. This was the digital baseband integrated circuit for its 21Mbit/s POEM powerline comms technology. It presented Ethernet and USB data-plane <b>traffic</b> <b>interfaces,</b> {{as well as a}} host-processor interface port for control-plane management. The PLT050 was built on UMC's 0.18 micron digital process. The PLT050 required an external analog front-end (AFE) circuit, including an integrated component for high-speed and scalable A/D and D/A conversion. Initial powerline modems built around the PLT050 used Analog Devices's AD9865 integrated AFE part, in common with the powerline modem designs from other silicon manufacturers. SiConnect had designed its own integrated AFE, codenamed the SCA10, which delivered superior performance at lower cost than the AD9865. The company intended to combine the SCA10 with the PLT050 in a single package to sell a single-package solution {{to be known as the}} PLi050, but this had not come to market before SiConnect ceased trading.|$|R
50|$|Channel bonding is an {{arrangement}} of communications links in which two or more links are combined for redundancy or increased throughput. Examples include links associated with network interfaces on a host computer, or downstream and upstream channels within a DOCSIS cable modem connection. Channel bonding is differentiated from load balancing in that load balancing divides <b>traffic</b> between network <b>interfaces</b> on per network socket (OSI model layer 4) basis, while channel bonding implies a division of <b>traffic</b> between physical <b>interfaces</b> at a lower level, either per packet (OSI model Layer 3) or a data link (OSI model Layer 2) basis.|$|R

40|$|The {{quality of}} {{computer}} interfaces in transportation {{command and control}} centres is vital to safe and smooth operations. Air Traffic Control (ATC) {{is probably the most}} dynamic area in transportation where a large amount of information is presented to the air traffic controller within a short timeframe. Future Air <b>Traffic</b> <b>Interfaces</b> (ATI) are on the horizon with more information and added levels of sophistication. Safety is becoming a default constraint in current systems and evaluating the usability of these interfaces has been seen traditionally as crucial for ensuring high operational safety standards. To this end, a strong business case for evaluating the usability of interfaces necessarily requires a full-scale justification of the usability study and its associated cost. The benefits of performing such an evaluation also need to be communicated to decision makers in terms of economic values and gains. It is at this point that the field of operational analysis intersects with human factor research. This paper outlines a methodology for conducting usability studies for ATI. The methodology has been designed to connect higher-level organisational objectives with low-level usability metrics. The methodology will be presented towards establishing a code of best practice for the design and conduct of usability studies in this domain. While the results can be generalised to other transportation command and control interfaces, this paper focuses on ATC because this code of best practice is tailored towards ATC functions. 1...|$|R

The particular goal is to advance integration of non-broadcast multiple-access (NBMA) subnets, such as native ATM, and furthermore, to allow for meaningful inter-operation between traffic control and policy control. Our experience stems from implementing RSVP in combination with a policy interface to charging modules. Furthermore, we have developed a VC management module for ATM, which enables flexible inter-operation of RSVP with ATM subnets.

Our city-scenarios and geo-data come from the OpenStreetMap project, an open data repository for geographical information. The microscopic model employed is the car-following model proposed by Krauss [22], this model allows the simulation of platooning of vehicles and reproduces the drivers' behavior.

The lane changing model is rule based. The core models in SUMO is further described by Krajzewicz [24]. The VSL algorithms are implemented through python scripts [51]. SUMO’s <b>Traffic</b> Control <b>Interface</b> (TraCI) is used for communication of the speed limits to be applied on each road segment, and for accessing the mean values gathered by the detectors in the simulation.|$|R

40|$|In a free-flight {{airspace}} environment, pilots {{have more}} freedom to choose user-preferred trajectories. An onboard pilot support system is needed that exploits travel freedom while maintaining spatial separation with other <b>traffic.</b> Ecological <b>interface</b> design is used to design an interface tool that assists pilots with the tactical planning of efficient conflict-free trajectories toward their destination. Desired pilot actions emerge from the visualization of workspace affordances {{in terms of a}} suitable description of aircraft (loco) motion. Traditional models and descriptions for aircraft motion cannot be applied efficiently for this purpose. Through functional modeling, more suitable locomotion models for trajectory planning are analyzed. As a result, a novel interface, the state vector envelope, is presented that is intended to provide the pilot with both low-level information, allowing direct action, and high-level information, allowing conflict understanding and situation awareness.

30|$|In SILVIO, mobile routers are {{not only}} {{equipped}} with a 3 G interface, but also with a WLAN one, that is opportunistically used to offload part of the traffic from the 3 G one. Let us consider that the WLAN interface provides intermittent connectivity to the Internet (how this connectivity is achieved {{is the subject of}} Section 2.4), these connectivity opportunities can be used to dynamically move (i.e., offload) part of the total traffic sent/received by/at the vehicle to the WLAN access, reducing in this way the load of the 3 G network. We describe in Section 2.6 the design of the automatic mechanisms (the intelligence) that decide which packets are moved, when they are moved, and from which interface to which interface.

40|$|Abstract [...] The Scalable Coherent Interface (SCI) {{is one of}} the {{enabling}} interconnect {{technologies for}} high performance computing on PC Clusters. Trinity College Dublin has designed and is currently prototyping a trace instrument that allows deep traces of SCI interconnect traffic. Figure 1. shows how the trace instrument’s hardware and software components are related to each other during trace data acquisition and a subsequent off-line data analysis. Such an instrument is essential for a detailed spatial and temporal analysis of parallel executed algorithms on loosely coupled clusters. Currently, there are no commercial instruments available that sample and store very deep (>> 10 Mbyte) interconnect traces per target node. The technology enables the non-intrusive monitoring of SCI <b>interface</b> <b>traffic.</b> The primary observation of <b>interface</b> <b>traffic</b> is accomplished through snooping on the Blink ™ [3], Dolphin’s implementation of the SCI IEEE standard [4] transfer cloud. Snooping on SCI cable traffic, via SCILAB’s SCITRAC [9], is also supported. The tracer’s configuration consists of three modules, a trace probe, a deep trace memory and a trace database. The database, which over time is expected to represent the major investment, provides a powerful means for a fine-grained analysis of a large quantity of trace data. This paper describes the technical features of the SCI trace instrument and outlines the tool’s potential for further research and development activities...|$|R

40|$|Currently IP {{addresses}} {{are used}} both for node identifiers and topological location {{names in the}} Internet. The semantic overloading and non-cryptographic nature of IP addresses {{makes it impossible to}} use them as identifiers from the security point of view. The problem becomes even worse with multi-homed mobile nodes. Multi-homed mobile nodes have several interfaces bound to dynamically changing IP addresses. When a node changes its point of attachment to the network or it reroutes <b>traffic</b> fromone <b>interface</b> to another, the connection identifiers are changed. A peer node cannot verify the validity of the new identifiers without a naming trust relationship between the identifiers and the identity of the node. The peer must have evidence that an identifier belongs to a specific identity. Currently, there are no way for a node, using traditional IP addresses, to prove that it owns a specific address, i. e., an identifier. We present in this paper the philosophy behind separation of end-point identifiers from location names, which is an essential part in designing secure multi-homed mobility architectures...|$|R
