5|$|Pantulf {{regained his}} lands after he cleared {{himself of the}} charge, through the {{mechanism}} of a trial by ordeal. It is not clear why the ordeal was required, with the historian David Bates speculating that either the evidence of Pantulf's involvement was not conclusive or <b>that</b> <b>murder</b> victim's family demanded the ordeal because they suspected any evidence pointing to Pantulf's innocence. Pantulf gave Saint-Evroul four altar frontals for the abbey's help after he was cleared of the charges.|$|E
5|$|Crime and Punishment {{focuses on}} the mental anguish and moral {{dilemmas}} of Rodion Raskolnikov, an impoverished ex-student in Saint Petersburg who formulates and executes a plan to kill an unscrupulous pawnbroker for her cash. Raskolnikov, {{in an attempt to}} defend his actions, argues that with the pawnbroker's money he can perform good deeds to counterbalance the crime, while ridding the world of a vermin. He also commits the murder to test a theory of his that dictates some people are naturally capable of such actions, and even have the right to perform them. Several times throughout the novel, Raskolnikov compares himself with Napoleon Bonaparte and shares his belief <b>that</b> <b>murder</b> is permissible in pursuit of a higher purpose.|$|E

5|$|The {{prosecutor}} alleges <b>that</b> <b>murder</b> as a {{crime against}} humanity took place in Nakuru and Naivasha. He alleges that approximately 112 people were killed in Nakuru between 24 and 27 January 2008 and that by 31 January at least 50 people had been killed in Naivasha. One witness testified that 23 people died in Naivasha from burns including 19 who died in a single arson attack on the Kabati estate. The majority of the killings were the result of attacks with machetes and blunt instruments although guns were used in some attacks.|$|E
5|$|St. Paul, Minnesota: in a store, Clyde Bruckman (Peter Boyle), a life {{insurance}} salesman, purchases a {{paper and a}} lottery ticket and leaves. In the street, he almost bumps into an inconspicuous man (Stuart Charno), who heads to a gypsy palm reader named Madame Zelma (Karin Konoval). After seeking his fortune, the inconspicuous man attacks and kills her. A few days later, the eyes and entrails of a tea leaf reader, {{who was also a}} doll collector, have been found in her apartment, her body being missing. FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) arrive at the scene of <b>that</b> <b>murder</b> to help the local cops, who have recruited the help of a psychic, the eccentric Stupendous Yappi (Jaap Broeker). Although the psychic delivers extremely vague clues, the cops are thoroughly impressed; both Scully and Mulder, however, are not, especially after Yappi diagnoses that it is Mulder—not Scully—who is a skeptic.|$|E

25|$|In some states, {{the high}} number of {{aggravating}} factors has been criticized on account of giving prosecutors too much discretion in choosing cases where they believe capital punishment is warranted. In California especially, an official commission proposed, in 2008, to reduce these factors to five (multiple murders, torture murder, murder of a police officer, murder committed in jail, and murder related to another felony). Columnist Charles Lane went further, and proposed <b>that</b> <b>murder</b> related to a felony other than rape should no longer be a capital crime when there is only one victim killed.|$|E
25|$|As Mormon thinkers recognized, {{application}} of the blood atonement doctrine to the sin of murder seemingly created some difficulties. The Book of Mormon states that murderers can receive forgiveness by repentance. Nevertheless, a passage in the Doctrine and Covenants says <b>that</b> <b>murder</b> is unpardonable. Attempting to resolve this seeming conflict in a Deseret News article on July 4, 1883, Apostle Charles W. Penrose taught {{that in some cases}} such as murder done in anger or provocation, murder might be forgiven, but only after the guilty party atones for the murder by the shedding of blood.|$|E

I wanted {{people to know that}} thousands upon thousands of their fellow citizens were being assaulted daily, and that the police—in this case, the federal government—had done nothing to remedy the situation.

25|$|Finally, O'Connor {{rejected}} the FBI's argument that all its sources must be confidential {{in order to}} maintain effective law enforcement. The presumption of confidentiality that the FBI makes of presuming that a source and documents related to a source are confidential simply {{based on the fact that}} a source gave information to the FBI in the course of a criminal investigation was also rejected by Justice O'Connor. She stated that any source related to any type of criminal case the FBI handles should not be considered confidential simply because information was given for a criminal case. While she believed <b>that</b> <b>murder</b> cases would warrant an accurate presumption of confidentiality, she opposed the view that the FBI can presume confidentiality for every type of criminal case it deals with.|$|E
25|$|The {{case against}} Chivarra and Hernandez changed after Miguel Gatins, an American businessman, intervened on their behalf. Gatins lived in Atlanta, {{as his father}} had been a hotelier there, and then he resided in Guadalajara. After taking an {{interest}} in the case, Gatins was convinced based on contradictions in their interrogation and in the autopsies that there was no conclusive proof <b>that</b> <b>murder</b> had been committed. Gatins spent US $30,000 and worked through his philanthropic organization, Latin American Institute of Philanthropy, to acquire representation to make motions on their behalf. The head of a social service prepared the case. A member of the human rights commission in Jalisco wrote in support of the Huichol men. In 2001, lawyers presented a case to judges that evidence pointed to falling and after a closed hearing to review the evidence, judges released the two men.|$|E

25|$|They {{engaged in}} a {{systematic}} campaign of terror amongst the rural Nicaraguan population to disrupt the social reform projects of the Sandinistas. Several historians have criticized the contra campaign and the Reagan administration's support for it, citing the brutality and numerous human rights violations of the contras. LaRamee and Polakoff, for example, describe the destruction of health centers, schools, and cooperatives {{at the hands of}} the rebels, and others have contended <b>that</b> <b>murder,</b> rape, and torture occurred on a large scale in contra-dominated areas. The United States also carried out a campaign of economic sabotage, and disrupted shipping by planting underwater mines in Nicaragua's port of Corinto, an action condemned by the International Court of Justice as illegal. The U.S. also sought to place economic pressure on the Sandinistas, and the Reagan administration imposed a full trade embargo. The Sandinistas were also accused of human rights abuses.|$|E

The song topped the chart in France for five consecutive weeks {{and reached the}} top three in Belgium and the Netherlands. Anthony Mandler directed its music video, in which Rihanna's character shoots a man after he rapes her. The video was criticized by the Parents Television Council, Industry Ears and Mothers Against Violence, who faulted Rihanna for suggesting <b>that</b> <b>murder</b> is an acceptable form of justice for rape victims. However, actress Gabrielle Union, a rape victim, praised the video for being relatable.
