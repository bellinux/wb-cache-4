The Product Differentiation Hypothesis for Corporate Trade Credit The product {{differentiation}} hypothesis for trade credit says that business managers use trade credit like advertising to differentiate their products. Prior studies of this hypothesis conclude that higher <b>profit</b> <b>margins</b> induce firms {{to increase trade}} credit and vice versa. Indeed, prior empirical studies show a positive relation between the level of <b>trade</b> credit and <b>profit</b> <b>margin.</b> This result is biased, however, by failure to control for capital intensity. High levels of capital intensity create barriers to entry and firms with relatively high capital investments tend to earn higher per-unit <b>profit</b> <b>margins.</b> Such firms also face higher fixed costs and benefit most from predictable sales and long-lived customer accounts. Our model shows that higher real-asset investment induces managers to adjust both trade credit and price, but that they may move in opposite directions. Contrary to early versions of the {{product differentiation}} hypothesis, optimal <b>profit</b> <b>margin</b> may increase when trade credit decreases and vice versa. Trade credit is linked to <b>profit</b> <b>margin,</b> but through capital intensity, and the relation need not be positive. We test our predictions empirically with data taken from COMPUSTAT. First, using industry trade receivables relative to industry revenues, we replicate the positive relation already documented between trade credit and unconditional <b>profit</b> <b>margin.</b> Then we show that th...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{interdependence}} {{of competition and}} <b>profit</b> <b>margins</b> {{is one of the}} mostimportant features of industrial economics. According to mainstream economics,intense market competition results in smaller <b>profit</b> <b>margins.</b> Long-termprofitsare contingent on competition and market imperfections; perfect competitionpresumably reduces profits to zero in the long run (excluding normal profitsallocated to managerial compensation). This relationship between competition and <b>profit</b> <b>margins</b> is also an importanttheme in Post Keynesian economics. From Joan Robinson’s Economics of ImperfectCompetition to Kalecki’s analyses of the degree of monopoly, Post Keynesianeconomists have long been interested in this aspect of economic theory. There ishowever no unified Post Keynesian view of competition and its effect on profitmargins, and we can, from a historical perspective, identify two main strands ofPost Keynesian thought, each relying on a specific theory to determine profitmargins. Based on the ‘imperfect competition and degree of monopoly principle,’the first branch considers that <b>profit</b> <b>margins</b> are the result of market structure(market imperfections). In this view, as in the theory of monopoly capitalism (seeMoudud, Bina, and Mason 2013), <b>profit</b> <b>margins</b> thus positively correlate withcompetition imperfections and degree of monopoly. Rooted in the ‘investmentfinancing tradition,’ including the works of Alfred Eichner and Adrian Wood, thesecond branch makes a direct connection between <b>profit</b> <b>margins</b> and internalfinancing requirements for investment. We consider this second view to clearlyrepresent Fred Lee’s economic thinking (see, for example, Lee 2013 b). A comparisonof the two Post Keynesian branches shows that the first position closelyresembles what later became the mainstream view on the relation between competitionand <b>profit</b> <b>margins</b> (notably with the emergence of the so-calledstructure-conduct-paradigm in the 1960 s and 1970 s, which remains an influential theoreticalframework for industry-competitionpolicies). Stated succinctly, in this theory, thetougher the competition, the smaller the <b>profit</b> <b>margins.</b> Nevertheless, empirical testing of this theory poses certain difficulties. In fact,many empirical studies fail to validate the direct link between the degree of competition(regardless of the chosen criterion) and <b>profit</b> <b>margins.</b> Such studies often report weak or even paradoxical results, be it at the sectoral or macroeconomiclevel. These unexpected results can, however, be explained from the‘investment-financing’theory of <b>profit</b> <b>margins.</b> Based on the theories of AlfredEichner (1973, 1976) and Adrian Wood (1975), this second branch offers anexplanation for why <b>profit</b> <b>margins</b> are independent of the degree of competitionin the market. In conjunction with his two-curvediagram, Adrian Wood’s analysis(developed in his 1975 book, A Theory of Profits) enables us to show whycompetition does not affect the determination of <b>profit</b> <b>margins.</b> Therefore, thesecond strand’s main contribution is its emphasis on the fundamental role ofinternal financing in capitalist economies, which is the missing link in industrialeconomics...|$|R

Methods: Interviews with managers/owners of 62 small retail shops that sold tobacco in disadvantaged areas of Newcastle and London, England. The interviews included questions about tobacco sales and <b>profit</b> <b>margins,</b> {{and interest in}} reducing reliance on tobacco sales. Results: The majority of retailers (89 %) reported low overall <b>profit</b> <b>margins</b> on tobacco sales (< 6 %). The most common response was a <b>profit</b> <b>margin</b> of 4 – 6 %,with some reporting lower margins for price-marked packs of cigarettes (1 – 6 %) and higher margins for non-price marked or premium brands (7 % to over 10 %).

Despite this, most thought tobacco sales were important (90 %), and attributed this reliance to footfall (81 %), i. e., customers purchasing tobacco also purchasing other products. 42 % of retailers expressed interest in reducing their reliance on tobacco sales. Conclusions: Small retailers report low tobacco <b>profit</b> <b>margins,</b> but high reliance on tobacco sales because of footfall.

50|$|Tesco's <b>profit</b> <b>margins</b> in the Republic are the company's {{highest in}} the world {{according}} to retail industry analysts in London, who have a detailed knowledge of Tesco's worldwide operations. Tesco's Irish <b>profit</b> <b>margin,</b> was 9.3 per cent in 2008 and is projected to rise to 9.5 per cent by the end of 2009. This makes the Irish operation Tesco's most successful worldwide in margin terms. Tesco's Irish <b>profit</b> <b>margin</b> is all the more remarkable given that the company sells a much larger volume of higher margin non-food items at its UK stores.|$|R
40|$|According to the {{standard}} model, advertising is remarkably sensitive to <b>profit</b> <b>margins.</b> Firms advertise to stimulate demand for their products. They advertise highmargin products aggressively and low-margin ones hardly at all. In macroeconomics, variations in <b>profit</b> <b>margins</b> over the business cycle have a key role. A widening of margins can explain the rise in unemployment in recessions. A higher margin implies a lower real wage. A variety of models ranging from Keynesian to search-and-matching map a decline in wages to higher unemployment. But a rise in <b>profit</b> <b>margins</b> should expand advertising by a lot. Really a lot. Advertising should be highly countercyclical. Instead, it is somewhat procyclical. The ratio of advertising spending to private GDP falls when the economy contracts. The behavior of advertising refutes the hypothesis that <b>profit</b> <b>margins</b> rise. But {{it is true that}} the labor share of income falls. Hence there must be another factor that lowers the labor share without raising <b>profit</b> <b>margins.</b> The only influence that fits the facts is a rise in a product-market friction that has the same effect as an increase in sales taxes...|$|R
