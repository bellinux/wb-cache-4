5|$|All {{those with}} a risk of {{exposure}} to body fluids such as blood should be vaccinated, if not already. Testing to verify effective immunization is recommended and further doses of vaccine are given <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> not sufficiently immunized. In 10- to 22-year follow-up studies there were no cases of hepatitis B among {{those with a}} normal immune system who were vaccinated. Only rare chronic infections have been documented.|$|E
5|$|Many bathhouses {{are open}} {{twenty-four hours a}} day, seven days a week. There is {{typically}} a single customer entrance and exit. After paying at the main entrance, the customer is buzzed through the main door. This system allows establishments to screen potential troublemakers; many bathhouses refuse entry <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> visibly intoxicated, as well as known prostitutes. In some areas, particularly where homosexuality is illegal, considered immoral, or viewed with hostility, this is a necessary safety precaution.|$|E

5|$|Prostitutes are {{the lowest}} and meanest, so {{are they the}} basest, vilest, and wickedest of all Creatures. It is a trite Observation, that when a Woman quits her Modesty, she {{discards}} with it every other Virtue. To extend this to every frail Individual of the Sex, is to carry it too far; but if it be confined <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> become infamous by public Prostitution, no Maxim, I believe, hath a greater Foundation in Truth, or will be more strongly verified by Experience.|$|E
5|$|In Belarus, {{the right}} to vote in {{elections}} and plebiscites is extended <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> above the age of eighteen. During elections and plebiscites, a citizen can vote or not vote without any consequences from the government. The Constitution describes two methods of preventing a citizen from voting. First, a court can issue an order stating that the citizen does not have the mental capacity to understand and to cast a ballot. Second, a person being held in detention or confined in a prison during an election cannot cast a ballot. The Constitution says nothing about the voting rights of those who have served their prison terms, nor does it state how those citizens gain the rights back.|$|E
5|$|In some {{countries}} bathhouses {{are prohibited from}} selling alcohol. (In Canada, where some bathhouses serve alcohol, a bathhouse holding a liquor license {{may be required to}} submit to liquor inspections, which activists claim are often a pretext for regulating gay sexual activity.) Many bathhouses deny entry <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> visibly intoxicated but do notor cannotregulate the consumption of drugs (typically marijuana, poppers, ecstasy, cocaine, and crystal meth) by their patrons. The use of drugs and alcohol may make people {{more likely to engage in}} unsafe sex. Sex clubs with no private areas potentially find it easier to regulate consumption of drugs on their premises.|$|E

5|$|The International Finance Corporation (IFC) is an {{international}} financial institution that offers investment, advisory, and asset-management services to encourage private-sector development in developing countries. The IFC {{is a member of}} the World Bank Group and is headquartered in Washington, D.C.. It was established in 1956, as the private-sector arm of the World Bank Group, to advance economic development by investing in for-profit and commercial projects for poverty reduction and promoting development. The IFC's stated aim is to create opportunities for people to escape poverty and achieve better living standards by mobilizing financial resources for private enterprise, promoting accessible and competitive markets, supporting businesses and other private-sector entities, and creating jobs and delivering necessary services <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> poverty stricken or otherwise vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{treatment}} is only needed {{if a person}} is showing signs of a severe allergic reaction. Prior to calling for help, stung persons should be laid down, and their legs elevated. An EpiPen or an Anapen is given to people at risk of anaphylaxis, to use in case they are stung. If someone experiences anaphylactic shock, adrenaline and intravenous infusions are required, and those who suffer cardiac arrest require resuscitation. Desensitisation (also called allergy immunotherapy) is offered <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> susceptible to M. pilosula stings, and the program has shown effectiveness in preventing anaphylaxis. However, the standardisation of M. pilosula venom is not validated, and the program is poorly funded. The Royal Hobart Hospital and the Royal Adelaide Hospital are the only known hospitals to run desensitisation programs. During immunotherapy, patients are given an injection of venom under the skin. The first dose is small, but dosage gradually increases. This sort of immunotherapy is designed to change how the immune system reacts to increased doses of venom entering the body.|$|E

5|$|The {{right to}} be identified, known as the right of paternity, applies to the creators of {{original}} literary, dramatic, musical or artistic works; for films, the {{right to be}} identified is granted to the director rather than the writer. Some specific types of work are not protected by this right, particularly those made to report current events, periodicals, newspapers or encyclopaedias. These exceptions were included as a result of lobbying by the publishing industry, and the fear that the need to name the author of a current events report could interfere with its speedy delivery, and undermine the image of the news as objective and neutral. Under Section 79, {{the right to be}} identified also does not apply to authors of computer programs, computer-generated works, typefaces or works protected by crown copyright. On those works which are covered by this moral right, {{there is a need to}} assert it; this may be done through an instrument assigning copyright, or any other instrument written by the author or director. If the asserting is done through a document designed to assign copyright, it binds the assignee and anyone who claims through him, with or without notice; if it is done through another instrument, it only applies <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> directly informed of the assertion.|$|E
5|$|The story depicts how {{suffering}} {{is essential to}} completing one's destiny. Southey's purpose in Thalaba, however, is to describe {{as many of the}} various myths and superstitions that he can, and this interferes with the resolving of moral problems within the story. Instead, the moral lessons are formulaic and the events focus on awards given <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> obedient. Southey's emphasis on the actual mythic incidents over the moral events are backed up with more than 80 pages of his own notes that describe the various references to traditional myths or mythic creatures that are incorporated into the story. In terms of structure, the unilateral plot keeps Thalaba does not allow for an easy flow into various mythic incidents. Instances of the plot being supplanted by the myths can be found during the descriptions of the story of Irem, Haruth and Maruth, or others.|$|E

5000|$|The Webster's Online Dictionary defines affranchisement as [...] "the act {{of making}} free".

30|$|Contrarily, it was {{noticed that}} {{immigrant}} traders who {{were less than}} 20 [*]years were about 0.478 times less likely to reduce vulnerabilities to occasional price shocks on basic necessities as compared <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> older (40 – 49 [*]years) (Table 3). The current finding {{could be attributed to}} the fact that these group of immigrants (those aged <[*] 20) might have been inexperienced in the business as compared <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> older <b>to</b> overcome occasional prices shocks. As regards assets acquisition, Table 3 revealed that immigrants <b>who</b> <b>were</b> young (<[*] 20 – 29 [*]years) were less likely to have improved asset-holding status as compared <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> older (40 – 49 [*]years). This revelation again could be {{due to the fact that}} those immigrant traders who were elderly might have been involved in their itinerant trading activities for longer periods and are, therefore, more likely to accumulate sufficient assets. In general, age indicated a statistically significant effect on the overall livelihood status of the immigrant traders and <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> much younger (<[*] 20 [*]years) were less likely to better their lots as compared <b>to</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>were</b> older (40 – 45 [*]years) (Table 3).|$|R
