According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>report,</b> Egypt and Syria's air forces, if reinforced with 16 air squadrons from other Arab countries would achieve numerical superiority. However, the Israelis offset this by superior training, avionics, aircraft payload and weaponry. A simultaneous Arab attack could dilute the effectiveness of the Israeli Air Force (IAF), and would force Israeli ground forces to fight a two-front war.|$|E

5|$|In 1985, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) {{formed a}} Joint Working Party (JWP) aimed at {{assessing}} discoveries and establishing final {{names for the}} elements in question. The party held numerous meetings with delegates from the three competing institutes; in 1990, they established criteria on recognizing an element and in 1991, they completed the work on assessing discoverer statuses and the party was disbanded. These results were published in 1993. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>report,</b> the first definitely successful experiment was the April 1970 experiment in Berkeley, followed closely by the June 1970 Dubna experiment; thus, credit for discovery of the element should be shared between the two competing teams.|$|E

5|$|The FIA {{announced}} a ten-person review panel, composed of former drivers and team principals, {{to investigate the}} cause of the accident and published its findings four weeks later in Doha. According <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>report,</b> there was no single cause of Bianchi's accident; contributing factors included track conditions, car speed and the presence of a recovery vehicle on the track. The report made several suggestions to improve safety when recovering disabled vehicles (which were introduced for 2015), and concluded {{that it would have been}} impossible to mitigate Bianchi's injuries with changes to cockpit design. Since 2015, for safety reasons, the FIA has required that the start time of certain Grands Prix be at least four hours before sunset or dusk (except for designated night races). FIA safety commission chairman Peter Wright was quoted in July 2015 as saying that a closed cockpit would not have prevented Bianchi's head injuries, and vice-president Andy Mellow confirmed that attaching impact protection to recovery vehicles was unfeasible.|$|E

Mansur al-Bajali commanded the vanguard as before, reinforced by the troops of the district of Damascus (under Hamlah ibn Nu'aym al-Kalbi) and the personal retinue of Asad. The khagan, who had only 4,000 of his men with him, placed Ibn Surayj and his followers on the right, while the rest of his force consisted not only of his Turgesh but also of contingents from the princes of Transoxiana—al-Tabari implies they were there in person, but this is unlikely—including the rulers of Sughd, Shash (Tashkent), Usrushana, Khuttal, and the Jabghu of Tokharistan.|$|E
