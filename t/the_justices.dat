5|$|Other {{legislation}} {{of importance}} includes the Treason Act of 1351. It {{was precisely the}} harmony of the reign that allowed a consensus on the definition of this controversial crime. Yet the most significant legal reform was probably that concerning <b>the</b> <b>Justices</b> of the Peace. This institution began before the reign of Edward III but, by 1350, <b>the</b> <b>justices</b> {{had been given the}} power not only to investigate crimes and make arrests, but also to try cases, including those of felony. With this, an enduring fixture in the administration of local English justice had been created.|$|E
5|$|By a 5–4 margin, <b>the</b> <b>justices</b> {{reversed}} the conviction, agreeing that Jacobson had been entrapped, on April 6, 1992. It {{has since been}} reported that {{this was one of}} the rare cases where the decision changed after arguments. The original poll of <b>the</b> <b>justices</b> showed a 7–2 majority for affirmance, with only White and Stevens holding out. But White argued persuasively for reversal to his fellow Justices, and Blackmun and Clarence Thomas, who had replaced Marshall, changed their minds. It has been suggested that Thomas, who later established a reputation for allowing wide latitude to law enforcement similar to other contemporary Republican appointees, was especially sensitive at that time to Jacobson's situation due to the sexual harassment allegations raised by Anita Hill during his own recent confirmation hearings.|$|E

5|$|The Court's {{caseload}} {{continued to}} grow over time. In 1881 the general assembly approved {{the creation of a}} five-member panel of commissioners to assist <b>the</b> <b>justices</b> in administrative tasks. Even this was not enough to handle the load. In 1891 the Appellate Court of Indiana was created to handle cases of lower importance. At first the appellate court only took {{a small portion of the}} Supreme Court's caseload, but its responsibility gradually increased.|$|E
5|$|The Old Court – New Court {{controversy}} was a 19th-century political {{controversy in}} the U.S. state of Kentucky in which the Kentucky General Assembly abolished the Kentucky Court of Appeals {{and replaced it with}} a new court. <b>The</b> <b>justices</b> of the old court refused to recognize the action as valid, and for a time, two separate courts operated as the court of last resort for the state.|$|E
5|$|The {{powers of}} the OSC derive from the Oregon Constitution’s Article VII. Like other supreme courts in the United States, the Oregon Supreme Court acts {{primarily}} as a court of appeals. They choose cases that are of legal significance or to unify lower court decisions. In this aspect the court has discretionary review over many of the cases appealed to the high court. Discretionary review allows the court to choose which cases it will hear on appeal. With those cases that are denied {{an appeal to the}} Supreme Court, the decision of the lower court becomes final and binding. As of 1995, the court only accepted one in eight appeals that were discretionary. <b>The</b> <b>justices</b> meet once per week in a formal conference in which only <b>the</b> <b>justices</b> are involved to determine rulings. Once a case is accepted, the court hears the case en banc. That is the court is not divided into panels, and instead all justices participate in all the cases, unless a justice recuses themselves due to a conflict of interest or other concern.|$|E

5|$|Warren {{convened a}} meeting of <b>the</b> <b>justices,</b> and {{presented}} to them the simple argument {{that the only reason}} to sustain segregation was an honest belief in the inferiority of Negroes. Warren further submitted that the Court must overrule Plessy to maintain its legitimacy as an institution of liberty, and it must do so unanimously to avoid massive Southern resistance. He began to build a unanimous opinion.|$|E
5|$|Attorney General Alfred S. Hartwell {{applied for}} the {{appointment}} of trustees shortly after Kanaʻina's death under the articles of Lunalilo's will.

The property was to be sold and invested until the sum of $25,000.00 was raised to fund {{a home for the}} poor and destitute.

He was behind the abduction of <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> League members and specific objects in order to eliminate <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> League so that Batman can be the greatest hero in the universe. To do this, he became the mysterious benefactor to Lex Luthor, Joker, Penguin, Man-Bat, Captain Cold, and Black Manta in order {{to pull off the}} heists. When <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> League members were abducted and placed in a cage, Bat-Mite assembled a special death trap that would be activated by the sun's rays.

Desha's election by the overwhelming vote of 38,37822,499 was seen by the party as a mandate to pursue the relief agenda. An early proposal to reduce the salaries of the Court of Appeals justices to 25 cents per year was discarded without a vote, but the House of Representatives mustered the votes to remove the offending justices. <b>The</b> <b>justices</b> were spared removal when the Senate failed to pass the measure with a two-thirds majority.

In 1226 he was once more a royal justice. Later, he was employed by King Henry III as an ambassador, helping negotiate with King Louis VIII of France over the status of Normandy and Poitou.

5|$|The Court reargued {{the case}} {{at the behest of}} Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter, who used reargument as a {{stalling}} tactic, to allow the Court to gather a consensus around a Brown opinion that would outlaw segregation. <b>The</b> <b>justices</b> in support of desegregation spent much effort convincing those who initially intended to dissent to join a unanimous opinion. Although the legal effect would be same for a majority rather than unanimous decision, it was felt that dissent could be used by segregation supporters as a legitimizing counter-argument.|$|E
5|$|The law {{partnership}} of Despard, Maxwell, and Goff was in operation until {{the autumn of}} 1866, when Maxwell was elected as an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia. Maxwell {{and the other three}} justices were chosen because of their early statehood leadership, and because they could be depended upon to defend the new state from Virginia sympathies and uphold the Unionist cause. While serving on the court, the major issues that faced Maxwell and <b>the</b> <b>justices</b> primarily involved post-war reconstruction and sectional acrimonies across the state.

Unlike the Crime Syndicate though, <b>the</b> <b>Justice</b> Lords are not simply evil opposites of their good counterparts.

Using data from a sample of 1, 216 first-time male adolescent offenders, the present study examines how attitudes toward <b>the</b> <b>justice</b> system develop over 24 months following the adolescent’s first arrest. Even after accounting for personal justice system experiences, including self-reported offending, time on the streets, and contacts with the police, results indicate that adolescents with friends who were arrested report more negative attitudes toward <b>the</b> <b>justice</b> system than those without friends who were arrested. Further, experiencing a friend’s arrest has a larger impact on the attitudes of youths who are experiencing {{it for the first}} time. We provide evidence that attitudes toward <b>the</b> <b>justice</b> system are a product of accumulated social experiences—both personal and vicarious—with <b>the</b> <b>justice</b> system...|$|R

5|$|At the hearing, new {{evidence}} was heard, that heavy rain {{had fallen on}} the ship {{on the second day}} of the killings, but a third batch of slaves was killed after that. This led Mansfield to order another trial, because the rainfall meant that the killing of those slaves, after the water shortage had been eased, could not be justified in terms of the greater necessity of saving the ship and the rest of its human cargo. One of <b>the</b> <b>justices</b> in attendance also said that this evidence invalidated the findings of the jury in the first trial, as the jury had heard testimony that the water shortage resulted from the poor condition of the ship, brought on by unforeseen maritime conditions, rather than from errors committed by its captain. Mansfield concluded that the insurers were not liable for losses resulting from errors committed by Zong crew.|$|E
5|$|Bloet {{continued}} to be an advisor to the king even after Rufus was succeeded by King Henry I, and was a supporter of Henry during the rebellion of 1102.

When the king and Anselm clashed over investiture, the king persuaded Bloet to consecrate {{a number of the}} king's abbatial appointments in 1102 and 1103. Throughout Henry's reign, Bloet {{continued to}} be a trusted councillor, and was often trusted with advising the queen when the king was absent from England.
