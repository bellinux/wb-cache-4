5|$|According to eyewitnesses, on 23 May 2015 <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> {{destroyed}} the Lion of Al-lāt and other statues; this came days after <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> gathered the citizens and {{promised not to}} destroy the city's monuments. ISIL {{destroyed the}} Temple of Baalshamin on 23 August 2015 according to Syria's antiquities chief Maamoun Abdulkarim and activists. On 30 August 2015, ISIL destroyed the cella of the Temple of Bel. On 31 August 2015, the United Nations confirmed the temple was destroyed; the temple's exterior walls and entrance arch remain.|$|E
5|$|Most historians {{share the}} view that <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> {{escalated}} the conflict toward violence {{on the basis of}} false information transmitted by duplicitous individuals or groups attempting to neutralize the nationalist influence. Members of VVS and Jiny involved in the initial attacks have stated that their organizations were obliged to attack after the signal to take action was transmitted to them by a group that was later discovered to have secret ties to the national police. Researchers have documented reports of nationalists whose member organizations joined the conflict upon commands issued by the police, British nationals, and French settlers living in Madagascar. Despite the role of <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> in leading the uprising, the colonial authorities immediately held MDRM responsible for the movement and responded by targeting the party's members and supporters.|$|E
5|$|On 3 July 2014, V-22 {{aircraft}} carried Delta Force commandos to a campsite {{in eastern}} Syria where Islamic State militants had held American and other hostages. The commandos eliminated <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> at the site, {{but found that}} the hostages had been moved elsewhere and returned home empty handed.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of April 23, 1998 a band of Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) fighters was ambushed by a much smaller group of Yugoslav Army (VJ) border guards near the Košare outpost, just west of Dečani. The fighters {{had been trying to}} smuggle weapons and {{supplies}} into Kosovo via northern Albania. Nineteen were killed in the ensuing attack, and a further two were captured. The VJ did not sustain any casualties. Some of <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> retreated back to Albania, while others managed to break through the ambush and make it past the Yugoslav border, into Kosovo. Following the clash, the VJ confiscated a large quantity of arms that <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> had been transporting.|$|E
5|$|Although many Pakistanis {{were silent}} about the {{operation}} against Lal Masjid, most {{agreed with the}} government's decision {{to use force to}} retake the complex. While hardliners have been able to stir up anger every time Musharraf moves against militants, most people have been tolerant and oppose <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> desire to impose their interpretation of Islamic law. Most residents of Islamabad agree that the raid restored local peace, despite fears of retaliation.|$|E
5|$|The SSG {{entered the}} complex, which {{also served as}} Abdul Rasid Ghazi's living quarters, and engaged in a firefight in the main courtyard. Militants fired on them from {{makeshift}} bunkers beneath the stairwell. Army spokesman Arshad later stated that <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> must have been fortifying the bunkers for several months. Once the courtyard was cleared, the SSG entered the labyrinth of the Jamia Hafsa building. Militants inside were armed with guns and rockets, and some areas were booby-trapped. Some militants had bullet- and explosion-proof vests and other sophisticated weapons. The SSG suffered most of their casualties during {{this phase of the}} operation. In close-quarter combat, the SSG were attacked with smoke grenades, incendiary grenades, and fragmentation grenades. Twenty-nine of the thirty-three SSG commandos who were injured in the operation received injuries from fragmentation grenades. As the fight continued, the SSG came upon a room in which half a dozen militants were present. One of <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> detonated a suicide jacket, killing everyone in the room.. It took several hours of intense fighting before the SSG gained control of Jamia Hafsa, with only the basement remaining to be secured.|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{explores the}} tactic of entrism within the British Labour Party {{pursued by the}} Revolutionary Socialist League and <b>the</b> <b>Militant</b> Tendency between 1955 and 1991. It also explores Labour’s {{response}} to such tactics by assessing {{the impact of the}} party’s internal investigations into <b>Militant</b> in <b>the</b> 1970 s and 1980 s, particularly the expulsion of <b>the</b> <b>Militant</b> Editorial Board in 1983, and the Inquiry into <b>the</b> <b>Militant</b> Tendency in Liverpool in 1985 - 6. Through an examination of <b>the</b> <b>Militant</b> newspaper, <b>the</b> group’s penetration of Labour’s youth wing, and its activities in Liverpool, this study analyses <b>the</b> extent of <b>Militant’s</b> infiltration of <b>the</b> Labour Party...|$|R
50|$|The new RSL {{became the}} British {{affiliate}} {{of the newly}} formed Fourth International. They maintained <b>the</b> <b>Militant</b> Labour League for those members {{who were involved in}} Labour Party entryism and published <b>The</b> <b>Militant.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Socialist Party was {{formerly}} <b>the</b> <b>Militant</b> group (also known as <b>the</b> <b>Militant</b> tendency) which practised entryist tactics in the Labour Party and organised around <b>the</b> <b>Militant</b> newspaper. Founded in 1964, <b>the</b> <b>Militant</b> newspaper described {{itself as the}} [...] "Marxist voice of Labour and Youth". In <b>the</b> 1980s, prominent <b>Militant</b> supporters Dave Nellist, Pat Wall and Terry Fields were elected to the House of Commons as Labour MPs. In 1982, the Liverpool District Labour Party adopted Militant's policies for Liverpool City Council in its battle against cuts in the rate support grant from government, and adopted the slogan [...] "Better {{to break the law}} than break the poor". It came into conflict with the Conservative government.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>militants</b> {{responsible}} for the murders were tried and executed in Damascus by Djemal Pasha in September 1915; the incident later {{became the subject of}} a 1916 investigation by the Ottoman Parliament led by Artin Boshgezenian, the deputy for Aleppo. After Marzbed's release from the court, he worked under a false Ottoman identity for the Germans in Intilli (Amanus railway tunnel). He escaped to Nusaybin, where he fell from a horse and died shortly before the armistice.|$|E
5|$|Intelligence {{agencies}} expressed {{shock at}} the highly sophisticated weapons that <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> in the Lal Masjid and Jamia Hafsa compound had, and began {{an investigation into}} where the equipment came from. Pakistan Army spokesman Waheed Arshad said that a suicide bomber had detonated himself in the mosque located at {{the opposite side of}} the complex to the seminary. Arshad also said a second suicide bomber had detonated himself in the white-domed mosque. In total, it took 36 hours to fully secure the complex and remove the booby traps.|$|E
5|$|Soldiers at {{the base}} noticed warning signs, {{including}} groups of men watching the construction from the nearby village, which was set at a higher elevation than the outpost, and other groups of men moving through nearby mountains. At a dinner meeting in the village, a villager told the Americans that they should shoot any men seen in the mountains, and asked them if U.S. UAVs were keeping watch nearby. The day before the attack, <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> began flowing water through an irrigation ditch feeding an unused field, creating background noise that masked {{the sounds of the}} advancing fighters.|$|E
25|$|In 1988, Taaffe began {{assessing}} with <b>the</b> Scottish <b>Militant</b> members <b>the</b> {{prospects of}} activism against the government's Poll tax (officially the Community Charge) legislation. But for Taaffe {{and the leadership}} of <b>the</b> <b>Militant,</b> <b>the</b> prospects for <b>Militant</b> in <b>the</b> Labour Party were poor.|$|R
5000|$|The Socialist is {{the weekly}} paper of the Socialist Party. Founded in 1964 under <b>the</b> name <b>Militant,</b> it styled {{itself as the}} [...] "Marxist voice of Labour and Youth" [...] and played an {{important}} role in bringing together a strong left-wing grouping within the British Labour Party, so much so that the group came to be known as <b>the</b> <b>Militant</b> tendency after <b>the</b> newspaper they sold and read. In 1997, Militant Labour (successor to <b>the</b> <b>Militant</b> tendency) changed its name to the Socialist Party, and <b>the</b> <b>Militant</b> newspaper was renamed the Socialist the same year.|$|R
50|$|After the war, Breitman {{was once}} again named editor of <b>The</b> <b>Militant,</b> {{handling}} primary editorial duties from 1946 to 1954. During this time, Breitman wrote copiously, publishing over 500 articles in <b>The</b> <b>Militant</b> from 1947 to 1955.|$|R
5|$|The complex was besieged from 3 to 11 July 2007, while {{negotiations}} were attempted between <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> and the state's Shujaat Hussain and Ijaz-ul-Haq. Once negotiations failed, the complex was stormed and {{captured by the}} Pakistan Army's Special Service Group. The government reported that the operation resulted in 154 deaths, and 50 militants were captured (other estimates were higher). It also prompted pro-Taliban rebels along the Afghan border to nullify a 10-month-old peace agreement with the Pakistani Government. This event triggered the Third Waziristan War, which marked another surge in militancy and violence in Pakistan and has resulted in more than 3,000 casualties.|$|E
5|$|While the SSG {{secured the}} ground floor of the mosque, they {{continually}} received fire from the mosque's minarets. This slowed the operation's progress. On the mosque roof, militants had piled sandbags {{at the base of the}} minarets, which they now used as steps to shoot at troops below. After the minarets were taken, the SSG progressed deeper into the complex, and <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> threw gasoline bombs in an unsuccessful attempt to set fire to the mosque and stop the assault. Once {{the ground floor}} was secured, the SSG attempted to enter the Jamia Hafsa madrasah adjoining the mosque but were delayed by booby traps, which had to be disabled before they could continue into the complex.|$|E
5|$|Within hours, {{suspected}} KLA gunmen {{attacked a}} Serb-owned café in Peć, killing six unarmed Serb youths. Western diplomats suspected {{the attack was}} carried out in retaliation for the ambush, though the KLA denied responsibility. Several days later, Yugoslav authorities returned the bodies of all but three of the fallen militants following mediation by the International Committee of the Red Cross. <b>The</b> <b>militants</b> were given heroes' funerals in a rebel-held area, in a ceremony attended by thousands of ethnic Albanians, including other KLA fighters. In January 1999, the KLA abducted eight VJ personnel, who were later exchanged for the nine militants captured in the ambush.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> {{opposition}} Mauritian <b>Militant</b> Movement (MMM) party decisively won {{the elections}} in coalition with <b>the</b> <b>Militant</b> Socialist Movement (MSM), defeating the governing Mauritian Labour Party (MLP) led coalition. They formed together the MSM/MMM As a result, in a pre-election deal Anerood Jugnauth of <b>the</b> <b>Militant</b> Socialist Movement became Prime Minister of Mauritius before handing over to Paul Bérenger of <b>the</b> Mauritian <b>Militant</b> Movement in 2003; Bérenger would become the first non-Hindu Prime Minister of Mauritius.|$|R
25|$|Two <b>militants</b> {{attacked}} <b>the</b> watchtower, raking it with RPG and small-arms fire, wounding {{two soldiers}} manning <b>the</b> tower. One <b>militant</b> crept towards <b>the</b> tower and placed an explosive charge {{next to the}} bottom doors. The ensuing explosion damaged the tower's communication cables. <b>The</b> <b>militant</b> then attempted to climb the stairs, while <b>the</b> second <b>militant</b> remained on <b>the</b> ground as backup. IDF soldiers in the tower spotted <b>the</b> <b>militant</b> climbing <b>the</b> stairs and opened fire, killing him in {{the upper part of}} the stairway. <b>The</b> second <b>militant</b> was spotted by an IDF lookout, and soldiers then opened fire and killed him.|$|R
5|$|About 1,500 {{members of}} the Front for the National Liberation of the Congo (FNLC) invaded Shaba Province (modern-day Katanga Province) in Zaire from eastern Angola on 7 March 1977. The FNLC wanted to {{overthrow}} Mobutu, and the MPLA government, suffering from Mobutu's support for the FNLA and UNITA, {{did not try to}} stop the invasion. The FNLC failed to capture Kolwezi, Zaire's economic heartland, but took Kasaji and Mutshatsha. The Zairean army (the Forces Armées Zaïroises) was defeated without difficulty and the FNLC continued to advance. On 2 April, Mobutu appealed to William Eteki of Cameroon, Chairman of the Organization of African Unity, for assistance. Eight days later, the French government responded to Mobutu's plea and airlifted 1,500 Moroccan troops into Kinshasa. This force worked in conjunction with the Zairean army, the FNLA and Egyptian pilots flying French-made Zairean Mirage fighter aircraft to beat back the FNLC. The counter-invasion force pushed the last of <b>the</b> <b>militants,</b> along with numerous refugees, into Angola and Zambia in April 1977.|$|E
5|$|Batista {{responded with}} an all-out-attack, Operation Verano, {{in which the}} army aerially bombarded forested areas and villages {{suspected}} of aiding <b>the</b> <b>militants,</b> while 10,000 soldiers commanded by General Eulogio Cantillo surrounded the Sierra Maestra, driving north to the rebel encampments. Despite their numerical and technological superiority, the army had no experience with guerrilla warfare, and Castro halted their offensive using land mines and ambushes. Many of Batista's soldiers defected to Castro's rebels, who also benefited from local popular support. In the summer, the MR-26-7 went on the offensive, pushing the army out of the mountains, with Castro using his columns in a pincer movement to surround the main army concentration in Santiago. By November, Castro's forces controlled most of Oriente and Las Villas, and divided Cuba in two by closing major roads and rail lines, severely disadvantaging Batista.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the role}} of <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> in leading the Uprising, the colonial {{authorities}} immediately accused the MDRM of instigating the movement. This view was echoed by PADESM leaders and shared {{by the majority of}} French settlers. The French authorities responded by targeting not only MDRM leaders and members, but also their supporters, drawing the wider population into the conflict. Attacks against the colonial authority in the east were immediately followed by similar actions in the south of the island before rapidly spreading throughout the country. The movement enjoyed particularly strong support in the south, where the revolt attracted as many as one million peasants to fight for the nationalist cause. The French responded with heavy military action and psychological warfare, including incidences of crimes against humanity. Between July and September 1948, most of the key leaders of the Uprising were captured or killed, and the last of the fighters disbanded and fled into the forests in December 1948.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Militant,</b> {{commonly}} called <b>the</b> <b>Militant</b> tendency, was a Trotskyist entryist {{group in the}} British Labour Party, based around <b>the</b> <b>Militant</b> newspaper launched in 1964. According to Michael Crick, its politics were influenced by Karl Marx, Friedrich Engels, Vladimir Lenin, and Leon Trotsky and [...] "virtually nobody else".|$|R

5|$|It {{became known}} on 4 September 2015 that ISIL had {{destroyed}} {{three of the}} best preserved tower tombs including the Tower of Elahbel. On 5 October 2015, news media reported ISIL is destroying buildings with no religious meaning, including the Arch of Triumph. On 20 January 2017, news emerged that <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> destroyed the tetrapylon {{and part of the}} theater. Following the March 2017 capture of Palmyra by the Syrian Army, Maamoun Abdulkarim, director of antiquities and museums at the Syrian Ministry of Culture, stated that the damage to ancient monuments may be lesser than earlier believed and preliminary pictures showed almost no further damage than what was already known. Antiquities official Wael Hafyan stated that the Tetrapylon was badly damaged while the damage to the facade of the Roman theatre was less serious in relativity.|$|E
5|$|On July 18, 1998 a Yugoslav Army (VJ) {{border patrol}} ambushed over 200 Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) insurgents and foreign mujahideen {{just west of}} Dečani, on the {{frontier}} between Albania and Yugoslavia. The ambush resulted {{in the deaths of}} four KLA fighters and 18 mujahideen (mostly citizens of Saudi Arabia). Another six KLA fighters were arrested by the Yugoslav authorities and charged with illegal entry and gunrunning. The VJ reported seizing a significant amount of arms and ammunition that <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> had been smuggling. One Yugoslav border guard was seriously wounded in the clash. According to Israeli historian Shaul Shay, the ambush represented the first clash of the Kosovo War between the VJ and foreign mujahideen. Human Rights Watch advisor Fred C. Abrahams suggests {{it is possible that the}} mujahideen were deliberately led into a trap by the KLA as part of a plan to reduce the influence of Islamic extremists within the KLA's ranks.|$|E
5|$|The {{damage to}} Lal Masjid was extensive. The {{entrance}} hall was completely burned out, the ceiling scorched, {{and the red}} walls above the oval doorway blackened. However, the mosque itself sustained less damage than the Jamia Hafsa seminary. Bullet casings were found all over the mosque roof, and the inside of Lal Masjid was turned coal black from <b>the</b> <b>militants</b> trying to set the mosque on fire using gasoline bombs. Militants used the mosque's two white minarets as vantage points, resulting in damage to the minarets. One minaret was completely destroyed, and its speakers were hanging from their wires. The dome, however, was not damaged during the 36-hour battle. The {{director general of the}} Inter Services Public Relations said photographs of the bodies seem to indicate that there were foreigners among the dead.|$|E
