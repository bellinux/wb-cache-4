500|$|Most of {{the money}} needed was raised {{from the sale of}} shares at £100 each (approximately £ in [...] ) in two tontine schemes, the first for £20,000 and the second for £5,000. The first was {{appropriately}} called the Richmond-Bridge Tontine, but {{when it became clear that}} the initial £20,000 would not be sufficient to complete construction a second tontine was set up. Each investor was guaranteed a return of 4% per annum, so £1,000 per annum from the income raised from tolls was divided amongst the investors in the two <b>tontines.</b> On the death of a shareholder their share of the dividend was divided among the surviving shareholders. To avoid fraud, each investor was obliged to sign an affidavit that they were alive before receiving their dividend. Any revenue over the £1,000 per annum required to pay the investors was held in a general fund for the maintenance of the bridge.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{well-known}} client that Robinson took on was the Order of the Iron Hall, nominally a fraternal benefit society {{founded in}} Indiana in 1881. [...] The organization {{was essentially a}} fraudulent investment vehicle that {{was a combination of}} a tontine (where increased benefits accrue to survivors as investors die) and a Ponzi scheme (where deposits of later investors are used to pay off earlier ones). [...] <b>Tontines</b> were illegal under Massachusetts insurance regulations, and the Iron Hall was in 1887 threatened with an injunction to stop doing business in the state. [...] It hired Robinson to appear before the legislature, {{and he was able to}} secure legislative alteration to the statute governing fraternal societies that would permit continued operation. [...] Iron Hall went into receivership in 1892, and the state insurance commissioner criticized Robinson for his defense of the organization in his reports, which he charged exacerbated the financial losses incurred by Iron Hall and similar organizations. (The Iron Hall was one of the more high-profile of a large number of similar investment schemes, in which the operators of the organization also frequently siphoned funds away in the guise of salaries and expenses.) ...|$|E

40|$|A <b>tontine</b> {{provides}} a mortality driven, age-increasing payout structure through the pooling of mortality. Because a <b>tontine</b> does not entail any guarantees, the payout {{structure of a}} <b>tontine</b> {{is determined by the}} pooling of individual characteristics of tontinists. Therefore, the surrender decision of single tontinists directly affects the remaining members' payouts. Nevertheless, the opportunity to surrender is crucial to the success of a <b>tontine</b> from a regulatory as well as a policyholder perspective. Therefore, this paper derives the fair surrender value of a <b>tontine,</b> first on the basis of expected values, and then incorporates the increasing payout volatility to determine an equitable surrender value. Results show that the surrender decision requires a discount on the fair surrender value as security for the remaining members. The discount intensifies in decreasing <b>tontine</b> size and increasing risk aversion. However, tontinists are less willing to surrender for decreasing <b>tontine</b> size and increasing risk aversion, creating a natural protection against <b>tontine</b> runs stemming from short-term liquidity shocks. Furthermore we argue that a surrender decision based on private information requires a discount on the fair surrender value as well...|$|R

60|$|Too {{many of the}} financiers by {{profession}} are apt to {{see nothing}} in revenue but banks, and circulations, and annuities on lives, and <b>tontines,</b> and perpetual rents, and all the small wares of the shop. In a settled order of the state, these things {{are not to be}} slighted, nor is the skill in them to be held of trivial estimation. They are good, but then only good when they assume the effects of that settled order, and are built upon it. But when men think that these beggarly contrivances may supply a resource for the evils which result from breaking up the foundations of public order, and from causing or suffering the principles of property to be subverted, they will, in the ruin of their country, leave a melancholy and lasting monument of the effect of preposterous politics, and presumptuous, short-sighted, narrow-minded wisdom.|$|E

But the reader must judge on the probability of the accounts we lay before him. The author speaks of France as raising her supplies for war by taxes within the year; and of her debt, as a thing scarcely worthy of notice. I affirm that she borrowed large sums in every year; and has thereby accumulated an immense debt. This debt continued after the war infinitely to embarrass her affairs; and to find some means for its reduction was then and has ever since been the first object of her policy. But she has so little succeeded in all her efforts, that the perpetual debt of France is at this hour little short of 100,000,000l. sterling; and she stands charged with at least 40,000,000 of English pounds on life-rents and <b>tontines.</b> The annuities paid at this day at the Hôtel de Ville of Paris, which are by no means her sole payments of that nature, amount to 139,000,000 of livres, that is to 6,318,000l.; besides billets au porteur, and various detached and unfunded debts, to a great amount, and which bear an interest.|$|E

50|$|While once {{very popular}} in France, Britain, and the United States, <b>tontines</b> have been banned in Britain, {{pursuant}} to the British Life Assurance Act 1774, 14 Geo. 3, c. 48, and as amended, and in the United States. See, e.g., Warnock v. Davis, 104 U.S. 775, 779 (1881). Such financial instruments are illegal primarily because they create beneficiaries who {{have an interest in}} the reduced lifespan of another person, and because many of these schemes were little more than swindles that encourage mischief against the life of the insured. Geneva, in Switzerland, was known for its active market in <b>tontines</b> in the 17th and 18th centuries.

5000|$|<b>Tontines</b> soon caused {{problems}} for their issuing governments, as the organisers tended {{to underestimate the}} longevity of the population. At first, tontine holders included {{men and women of}} all ages. However, by the mid-18th century, investors were beginning to understand how to game the system, and it became increasingly common to buy tontine shares for young children, especially for girls around the age of 5 (since girls lived longer than boys, and by which age they were less at risk of infant mortality). This created the possibility of significant returns for the shareholders, with significant losses for the organizers. As a result, tontine schemes were eventually abandoned, and by the mid-1850s <b>tontines</b> had been replaced by other investment vehicles, such as [...] "penny policies", a predecessor of the 20th-century pension scheme.|$|E

5000|$|In French-speaking cultures, {{particularly}} in developing countries, {{the meaning of}} the term [...] "tontine" [...] has broadened to encompass a wider range of semi-formal group savings and microcredit schemes.
