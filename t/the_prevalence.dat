5|$|Many {{microbes}} {{have been}} proposed as triggers of MS, but none have been confirmed. Moving {{at an early age}} from one location in the world to another alters a person's subsequent risk of MS. An explanation for this could be that some kind of infection, produced by a widespread microbe rather than a rare one, is related to the disease. Proposed mechanisms include the hygiene hypothesis and <b>the</b> <b>prevalence</b> hypothesis. The hygiene hypothesis proposes that exposure to certain infectious agents early in life is protective, the disease being a response to a late encounter with such agents. <b>The</b> <b>prevalence</b> hypothesis proposes that the disease is due to an infectious agent more common in regions where MS is common and where in most individuals it causes an ongoing infection without symptoms. Only in a few cases and after many years does it cause demyelination. The hygiene hypothesis has received more support than <b>the</b> <b>prevalence</b> hypothesis.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} <b>the</b> <b>prevalences</b> {{of a range}} of foot-related pathologies of a large random sample of older patients (> 65 years) who were discharged from NHS care as part of a disinvestment programme. <b>The</b> <b>prevalences</b> are examined with respect to the time since discharge, the age of the patients and their reported ability to care for their own feet. The pattern of alternative care taken up by these patients is reported, which shows that a sizeable proportion of patients with poor foot health are not receiving professional care. <b>The</b> <b>prevalences</b> of insensitivity to touch and vibration are reported both for diabetics and non-diabetics and <b>the</b> increasing <b>prevalence</b> of these problems with increasing age is commented upon.

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: To assess <b>the</b> <b>prevalences</b> of asthma, {{allergic}} rhinitis, and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis {{in adolescents}} {{in the city of}} Belo Horizonte, Brazil, in 2012 by administering the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire, as well as to compare <b>the</b> observed <b>prevalences</b> with those found in studies performed 10 years earlier and employing the same methodology used here. Methods: This was a cross-sectional study conducted between May and December of 2012 and involving {{adolescents in the}} 13 - to 14 -year age bracket. Participants were randomly selected from among adolescents studying at public schools in Belo Horizonte and completed the ISAAC questionnaire. Proportions were calculated in order to assess <b>the</b> <b>prevalences</b> of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis in the sample as a whole, and the chi-square goodness-of-fit test was used in order to compare <b>the</b> <b>prevalences</b> observed in 2012 with those found in 2002. Results: <b>The</b> <b>prevalences</b> of symptoms of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis in 2012 were 19. 8 %, 35. 3 %, and 16. 3 %, respectively, being significantly higher than those found in 2002 (asthma, p = 0. 006; allergic rhinitis, p < 0. 01; and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis, p = 0. 002). Conclusions: <b>The</b> <b>prevalences</b> of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and allergic rhinoconjunctivitis among adolescents in 2012 were found to be high, having increased in comparison with those found 10 years earlier, despite efforts in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Adolescence is a {{stressful}} period due to physical, psychological, sexual changes, {{and the presence}} of psychiatric disorders such as depression, anxiety, and stress at this stage of life is a matter of concern. Objectives: The objectives of the study were to determine <b>the</b> <b>prevalences</b> of depression, anxiety, and stress among higher secondary school students of Imphal and to determine the association between depression, anxiety, and stress and selected variables such as gender, standard, and religion. Materials and methods: From September 2014 to October 2014, a cross-sectional study was conducted among higher secondary school students of Imphal. The sample size was calculated to be 750. Seven schools were randomly selected, and all the students in that school were enrolled in the study. The study tool used was a questionnaire containing DASS (Depression Anxiety Stress Scale) and sociodemographic characteristics. Results: <b>The</b> <b>prevalences</b> of depression, anxiety, and stress among 830 valid respondents were 19. 5 %, 24. 4 %, and 21. 1 %, respectively. In total, 81. 6 % of the respondents had {{at least one of the}} studied disorders and 34. 7 % of the respondents had all the three negative states. <b>The</b> <b>prevalences</b> of depression, anxiety, and stress were high among females and were significant for anxiety (P = 0. 00) and stress (P = 0. 04). <b>The</b> <b>prevalences</b> of depression and stress were significantly higher among 12 th standard students with P-values of 0. 00 and 0. 02. Conclusion: <b>The</b> <b>prevalences</b> of depression, anxiety, and stress were high with anxiety and stress significantly higher among females, whereas prevalences of depression and stress were significantly higher among 12 th standard students. More studies are recommended to determine the factors leading to these mental disorders...|$|R

Among the mental disorders <b>the</b> highest <b>prevalence</b> can be found for anxiety disorders. For some of the anxiety disorders (specific phobia, social phobia, posttraumatic stress disorders, panic disorders, and alcohol abuse with or without dependence) can be noticed an increase of prevalence in adulthood compared to younger ages, following a decrease at 65 years or older ages. The major depressive episode registers continuous increase reaching <b>the</b> highest <b>prevalence</b> at elderly people. The projected lifetime risk shows higher values compared to <b>the</b> observed lifetime <b>prevalence.</b> <b>The</b> proportion of those making initial treatment contact in the year of onset is 32 - 63 % for those with bipolar disorder, dysthymia, drug abuse, 10, 2 - 24, 6 % for mood disorders and agoraphobia and under 10 % for major depressive episode, panic disorder specific phobia alcohol abuse and substance use disorders...|$|R

30|$|Fleck and Mitroff (2007) {{proposed}} that <b>the</b> low <b>prevalence</b> effect {{is due to}} observers executing the prepotent “target-absent” motor response despite detecting the target, and thus offered observers a corrective response {{in the case of}} an accidental button press. Although they found that the corrective response eliminated <b>the</b> low <b>prevalence</b> effect, this result has not been replicated by other researchers (Peltier & Becker, 2016; Van Wert, Horowitz, & Wolfe, 2009) and one of the original researchers later published a paper that reported <b>the</b> low <b>prevalence</b> effect (Mitroff & Biggs, 2014).
