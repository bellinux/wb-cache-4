5|$|In 1989 Greene {{published}} his {{book about the}} excavations entitled Norton Priory: The Archaeology of a Medieval Religious House. Further work has been carried out, recording and analysing the archaeological findings. In 2008 Fraser Brown and Christine Howard-Davis published Norton Priory: Monastery to Museum, in which <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>are</b> described in more detail. Howard-Davis was {{largely responsible for the}} post-excavation assessment and for compiling a database for the artefacts and, with Brown, for their analysis.|$|E
25|$|However, criticisms {{have been}} raised, for {{instance}} of the phonological-loop component, because some details of <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>are</b> not easily explained by the original Baddeley & Hitch model.|$|E
25|$|The COPE {{guidelines}} {{state that}} journal editors should consider retracting a publication {{if they have}} clear evidence that <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>are</b> unreliable, either {{as a result of}} misconduct (e.g. data fabrication) or honest error (e.g. miscalculation or experimental error). Retraction is also appropriate in cases of redundant publication, plagiarism and unethical research.|$|E
50|$|Failing to {{meet the}} {{residence}} or admissibility requirements above results in loss of permanent residence status when <b>the</b> <b>finding</b> of which becomes final without appeal, if <b>the</b> <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> made outside Canada, and upon the person being removed from Canada if <b>the</b> <b>finding</b> <b>is</b> made inside Canada.|$|R

50|$|Audits In September 2015, the Pennsylvania Auditor General {{conducted}} a performance audit of <b>the</b> District. <b>The</b> <b>findings</b> <b>were</b> reported to <b>the</b> {{school board and}} school administration.

25|$|In 2010, {{researchers}} from Karolinska Institutet in Sweden and University of Nigeria, Nsukka, showed that Igbos born in Biafra {{during the years}} of the famine were of higher risk of suffering from obesity, hypertension and impaired glucose metabolism compared to controls born a short period after the famine had ended. <b>The</b> <b>findings</b> <b>are</b> in line with the developmental origin of health and disease hypothesis suggesting that malnutrition in early life is a predisposing factor for cardiovascular diseases and diabetes later in life.|$|E
25|$|Journal editors should {{consider}} issuing {{an expression of}} concern if they receive inconclusive evidence of research or publication misconduct by the authors, {{there is evidence that}} <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>are</b> unreliable but the authors' institution will not investigate the case, they believe that an investigation into alleged misconduct related to the publication either has not been, or would not be, fair and impartial or conclusive, or an investigation is underway but a judgement will not be available for a considerable time.|$|E
25|$|This {{investigation}} objectively {{documents the}} functional {{status of the}} sphincters. However, the clinical significance of <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>are</b> disputed by some. It {{may be used to}} assess for pelvic floor dyssenergia, (anismus is a contraindication for certain surgeries, e.g. STARR), and these patients may benefit from post-operative biofeedback therapy. Decreased squeeze and resting pressures are usually the findings, and this may predate the development of the prolapse. Resting tone is usually preserved in patients with mucosal prolapse. In patients with reduced resting pressure, levatorplasty may be combined with prolapse repair to further improve continence.|$|E

40|$|The {{curious and}} unusual finding of coarse iron {{granules}} in marrow plasma cells is reported in 13 patients, in whom <b>the</b> <b>finding</b> <b>was</b> incidental. In 10 {{of these patients}} there was known alcohol abuse and serious medical complications of that abuse. Previous reports of <b>the</b> <b>finding</b> <b>are</b> reviewed.

25|$|Parts of the Kinsey Reports {{regarding}} {{diversity in}} sexual orientations are frequently {{used to support}} the common estimate of 10% for homosexuality in the general population. However, <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>are</b> not as absolute, and Kinsey himself avoided and disapproved of using terms like homosexual or heterosexual to describe individuals, asserting that sexuality is prone to change over time, and that sexual behavior can be understood both as physical contact as well as purely psychological phenomena (desire, sexual attraction, fantasy). Instead of three categories (heterosexual, bisexual and homosexual), a seven-point Kinsey scale system was used.|$|E
25|$|Bronze Age {{artefacts}} – mainly spearheads and sword fragments – {{have been}} discovered in the riparian vicinity of the hall, initially from an excavation (for drainage works) in 1867. Many of <b>the</b> <b>findings</b> <b>are</b> now in the British Museum and form part of the Broadward complex. The artefacts were over a metre below modern-day ground level and {{are believed to have}} been offerings to water gods in what was a marshy landscape; the level of the ground has since risen in the area (by natural process of alluvial material deposited in times of flood) and the area has also now been drained for agriculture.|$|E
25|$|Neuroimaging is {{controversial}} in whether it provides specific patterns unique to neuroborreliosis, but may aid in differential diagnosis and {{in understanding the}} pathophysiology of the disease. Though controversial, some evidence shows certain neuroimaging tests can provide data that are helpful in the diagnosis of a patient. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) {{are two of the}} tests that can identify abnormalities in the brain of a patient affected with this disease. Neuroimaging findings in an MRI include lesions in the periventricular white matter, as well as enlarged ventricles and cortical atrophy. <b>The</b> <b>findings</b> <b>are</b> considered somewhat unexceptional because the lesions {{have been found to be}} reversible following antibiotic treatment. Images produced using SPECT show numerous areas where an insufficient amount of blood is being delivered the cortex and subcortical white matter. However, SPECT images are known to be nonspecific because they show a heterogeneous pattern in the imaging. The abnormalities seen in the SPECT images are very similar to those seen in people with cerebral vacuities and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, which makes them questionable.|$|E
