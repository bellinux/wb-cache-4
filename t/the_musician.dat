Before <b>the</b> <b>musicians</b> {{had a chance to}} vote on the terms of the new contract, the management changed the locks to Powell Hall without notifying <b>the</b> <b>musicians.</b> Auditions were cancelled, and the health insurance for musicians was cancelled without notice as well. Whilst <b>the</b> <b>musicians</b> considered themselves to be 'locked out', management considered this action to be an illegal strike, since the players' attorney, Leonard Leibowitz, had advised them against filing certain documents as required by law. The National Labor Relations Board agreed with management.

5|$|The closing titles use a {{different}} arrangement of the theme, sung by countertenor Jeremy Jackman, with lyrics (usually insulting Blackadder) that reflect {{the events of the}} preceding episode.

At the end of the final episode, Blackadder catches the minstrel and repeatedly dunks him in a fountain.|$|E

5|$|Burges {{bought the}} lease on {{the plot of}} land in 1875. The house was built by the Ashby Brothers, with {{interior}} decoration by members of Burges's long-standing team of craftsmen including Thomas Nicholls and Henry Stacy Marks. By 1878 the house was largely complete, although interior decoration and the designing of numerous items of furniture and metalwork continued until Burges's death in 1881. The house was inherited by his brother-in-law, Richard Popplewell Pullan. It was later sold to Colonel T.H. Minshall and then, in 1933, to Colonel E.R.B. Graham. The poet John Betjeman inherited the remaining lease in 1962 but did not extend it.

5|$|Famous former {{residents}} include <b>the</b> <b>musician</b> Tricky, {{the boxer}} Dixie Brown and late 1950s {{rock and roll}} band the Eagles. There are five schools and four churches in Knowle West, {{as well as a}} number of open spaces, community centres, youth clubs and shopping facilities. Community organisations include the Knowle West Media Centre, the Residents' Planning Group and the Knowle West Health Association.

Just under a third of the residents are classed as economically inactive and the area is one of the most economically deprived in Bristol. Knowle West has relatively high indices of crime and drug use, but community efforts to combat this have had some success.|$|E
5|$|If, in {{the famous}} garden and {{cemetery}} scenes the dialogue of the two lovers, Juliet's asides, and Romeo's passionate outbursts are not sung, if the duets of love and despair are given to the orchestra, the reasons are numerous and easy to comprehend. First, and this alone would be sufficient, it is a symphony and not an opera. Second, since duets of this nature have been handled vocally a thousand times by the greatest masters, it was wise as well as unusual to attempt another means of expression. It is also because the very sublimity of this love made its depiction so dangerous for <b>the</b> <b>musician</b> {{that he had to}} give his imagination a latitude that the positive sense of the sung words would not have given him, resorting instead to instrumental language, which is richer, more varied, less precise, and by its very indefiniteness incomparably more powerful in such a case.|$|E
