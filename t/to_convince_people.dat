Rickey saw the opportunity as a way <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>people</b> that he was interested in cleaning up blackball, not integrating it.

After World War II, at age 17, he published his first piece of work: Diary of Ma-chan. Tezuka began talks with fellow manga artist Shichima Sakai, who had pitched Tezuka a manga based around the famous story Treasure Island. Sakai promised Tezuka a publishing spot from Ikuei Shuppan if he would work on the manga. Tezuka finished the manga, only loosely basing it on the original work. Shin Takarajima (New Treasure Island) was published and became an overnight success which began the golden age of manga, a craze comparable to American comic books at the time.|$|E
25|$|Many Russians {{believed}} that tsars and tsarevichs bore special marks {{on their bodies}} symbolising their royal status, which became known as royal marks. Four of the pretenders claiming to be Peter III showed royal marks to legitimise their claims. The first fake Peter to have royal marks was Gavrila Kremnev who Lev Evdokimov recognised because of a cross on Kremnev's foot. Lev Evdokimov claimed that he {{had worked as a}} chorister at the royal palace and had held the real Peter III in his arms as a child therefore giving credibility to Kremnev's claims. Despite Kremnev's marking, he never gained many supporters and was flogged and branded with the words, “deserter and pretender”. The next fake Peter III to show a royal mark of some sort was Fedot Kazin-Bogomolov in 1772. He showed a guard where he was imprisoned a cross on his chest and claimed he had two more on his arm and head allowing him to gain many supporters. The government branded Kazin-Bogomolov despite his markings. The third Peter III with royal marks was the most famous of the four and the most successful pretender of the time, Pugachev. In 1773 Pugachev staged a revealing of his royal identity to a cossack, Eremina Kuritsa, leading other cossacks to challenge Pugachev at dinner, which resulted in him showing scars on his chest and head to the cossacks. Pugachev claimed the scars on his chest were caused from the coup against him and that the scars on his forehead were from smallpox. Pugachev's rational reasoning for his markings caused him to continually gain supporters throughout his stand as a pretender. Unlike the first two pretenders to show royal marks, Pugachev's efforts cost him his life since his punishment was execution. The final pretender during Catherine's reign to reveal royal marks was Makar Mosiakin in 1774. Mosiakin entered a peasant hut claiming to be Peter III and then showed the peasants crosses on his arms, claiming they represented royal inheritance. According to the official report of the Mosiakin he had made the cross marks himself <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>people</b> that he was Peter III and he actually had some success as he managed to gain followers from various villages as he went from house to house.|$|E

And in our society sick people, by any definition of sick, just DO not get equal treatment. Equal treatment— no more, no less— is what we want! And compassion— which many homosexuals gladly swallow {{because they think it}} represents an improvement in attitudes toward them— is not equal treatment." ...|$|E
500|$|On 11 October 1954, {{the border}} was closed by the International Control Commission, {{after a period}} of 300 days during which free passage between both halves of Vietnam had been allowed.

Civilians were free to move to whichever zone they preferred. During the 300 days, Diệm and U.S. CIA adviser Colonel Edward Lansdale staged a campaign <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>people</b> to move to South Vietnam.

500|$|By {{the turn}} of the 20th century, campaigners such as William Morris had {{attempted}} <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>people</b> of the virtues of self-sufficient communities for poor families away from large cities, which led to developments such as Peacehaven in Sussex in 1914. Jaywick was proposed by property developer Frank Stedman in 1928 as a cheap holiday retreat for Londoners. Stedman had noticed the popularity of Clacton as a holiday resort and believed that he could sell small plots of land to East End residents on which holiday homes could be built. Residents were encouraged to buy land and self-build properties, with plots being offered as little as £25 (...) , while Stedman convinced buyers that a house could be built for as little as £395 (...) [...] An initial emphasis was on well-being, health and fitness, with outdoor exercises being popular. However, Stedman was motivated primarily by money rather than altruism, and while he discussed plans for landscaping the development, along with a lake and a sports centre, these never materialised.|$|E
500|$|... "Here Comes Your Man" [...] was {{released}} {{as a single}} in June 1989, and the song's music video received some airplay on MTV. The cover image, chosen by Francis, comes from a photograph cover designer Simon Larbalestier took of a bulldog terrier for a gallery showing.

Music writer Ben Sisario described this stance as [...] "vintage college-rock 'tude--the hit, the pop song, should be avoided as inauthentic, while the aggro, anticommercial song represents legitimacy." [...] Ivo Watts-Russell stated if Black Francis had been possibly persuaded to release the version of the song recorded during the session for the [...] "Gigantic" [...] single—which he described as [...] "totally streamlined and ready for radio"—that [...] "maybe if a major label company was able <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>people</b> {{to take a more}} commercial route, maybe Pixies would have sold a whole bunch more records than they did. But those steps were just not required back in 1989". The song reached number three on the U.S. Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart.|$|E
500|$|The name of {{the episode}} is a {{reference}} to the 1989 comedy film Weekend at Bernie's, in which two young insurance executives try <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>people</b> that their deceased boss is alive. The last part of the episode, in which Homer and Smithers believe that they have killed Burns, is based on the film's plot. While under the influence of marijuana, Homer shaves his beard, causing blood to pour out from his face. To Homer, the blood looks like psychedelic rainbows, and the song that plays during the scene is [...] "Wear Your Love Like Heaven" [...] by Scottish singer-songwriter Donovan. When speaking at the Phish concert, Homer stands in front of a large picture of himself. The scene is {{a reference to the}} 1941 drama film Citizen Kane, in which the main character Charles Foster Kane makes a political speech in front of a large picture of himself. In another scene, Homer and Smithers smoke marijuana in order to find Mr. Burns' jokes funny. While high, Smithers wears a suit similar to one worn by American actress and singer Judy Garland. While talking to Homer, Smithers forgets to take Mr. Burns out of his bathtub. Horrified, Smithers thinks that the unconscious Mr. Burns has drowned.

500|$|At {{the time}} of Jackson's death, and in the {{aftermath}} of it, multiple reports surfaced that AEG Live purposely tried to hide Jackson's health concerns during preparations for his would-have-been concerts. Concerns included Jackson's frail appearance due to lack of eating that had reportedly caused Jackson to be unable to perform from lack of strength and that AEG had used body doubles in rehearsals to stand in for Jackson. After Jackson's death, AEG stated that there was no truth to any of the rumors and that Jackson was thin but in good enough condition to perform. On 23 October 2009, days before the film's release, fans of Jackson launched a protest campaign against the film entitled [...] "This Is not It". The campaign's focus was <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> <b>people</b> that Jackson's health was neglected by AEG, among others, and that AEG was partly responsible for Jackson's death and now the company is making a profit off Jackson's death. The group started a website and created their own 'trailer' for the movie to showcase their point-of-view on the documentary. The protestors also inaccurately claimed that Jackson was 108 pounds (49 kg) at his death, contradicting Jackson's autopsy, which had stated that Jackson weighed 136 pounds (61kg). Shortly after the protest became news, The Guardian conducted a poll on their website asking users [...] "What do you think of Michael Jackson's posthumous film This Is It?", 51.4% agreed with one of the two options: [...] "I agree with the fans who are boycotting it—it's shameless profiteering".|$|E
