5|$|Fragments of Him {{originally}} {{stemmed from}} an idea developed at a game jam called the Ludum Dare. The game originally had players removing objects while {{the main character}} {{became more and more}} depressed. Mata Haggis, one of the developers of Fragments of Him, told the Rock, Paper, Shotgun blog that in the final version there would be more mechanics than just removing objects. He said that there would be some choices to be made, and that the story would branch off a little from the choices. <b>The</b> <b>prototype</b> <b>of</b> the game focused only on the boyfriend, while the full version was to include four different character perspectives. He described the gameplay style as a mix of Heavy Rain and Gone Home. Haggis told Nathan Grayson of the Kotaku blog that many of the objects in the game, such as hotels and parks, were based on his real-life experiences of when he lost a friend.|$|E
5|$|Located about 1.8° west of Epsilon (ε) Tauri is T Tauri, <b>the</b> <b>prototype</b> <b>of</b> a {{class of}} {{variable}} stars called T Tauri stars.

This is a newly formed stellar object that is just emerging from its envelope of gas and dust, but has not yet become a main sequence star. The surrounding reflection nebula NGC 1555 is illuminated by T Tauri, and thus is also variable in luminosity. To the north lies Kappa Tauri, a visual double star consisting of two A7-type components. The pair have a separation of just 5.6 arc minutes, making them a challenge to split with the naked eye.|$|E

40|$|Prototyping {{assumes a}} {{predominant}} {{role in the}} development of automated manufacturing systems (AMSs) and, in particular, in the verification of system specifications prior to their subsequent realization. In recent years, object-oriented methods have been applied increasingly in <b>the</b> <b>prototyping</b> <b>of</b> AMSs to shorten the development cycle. This paper proposes an object-oriented frame-based approach to <b>the</b> rapid <b>prototyping</b> <b>of</b> AMSs. <b>The</b> proposed approach is characterized by the extended use of the frame-based representation method in the modelling of object behaviour. This approach also draws reference from an object-oriented conceptual model of manufacturing systems and a semantic model of object behaviour. These two models and an object-oriented frame-based prototyping tool are developed to support the approach. When compared with the conventional object-oriented methods, the proposed approach can reduce the semantic gap in system modelling and therefore lead to a better integration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> specification and <b>prototyping</b> <b>of</b> AMSs. <b>The</b> application of the proposed approach is illustrated by <b>the</b> <b>prototyping</b> <b>of</b> a flexible manufacturing system. © IMechE 1999. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
5|$|Metroid Prime was a {{collaboration}} between Retro Studios and Nintendo EAD and R. The overall design was a collaborative effort, while the art and engineering was done entirely at Retro, and the music was handled in Japan. Retro Studios was created in 1998 by an alliance between Nintendo and Iguana Entertainment founder Jeff Spangenberg. The studio would create games for the forthcoming GameCube targeted at a mature demographic. After establishing its offices in Austin, Texas in 1999, Retro worked on four GameCube projects. When Miyamoto visited Retro in 2000, he suggested a new Metroid game after seeing <b>the</b> <b>prototype</b> <b>of</b> a first-person shooter engine they had created. In 2000 and early 2001, three games in development at Retro were canceled, and in July 2001, an RPG, Raven Blade, was terminated, leaving Prime {{the only game in}} development. During the last nine months of development, Retro's staff worked 80- to 100-hour weeks to reach the deadline imposed by Nintendo.|$|E
5|$|Stirred {{into action}} by the 1930 Ohio penitentiary fire, which {{resulted}} in 300 deaths when guards refused to let inmates out of their cells, Hollywood produced movies which depicted the harsh conditions in prisons at the time. <b>The</b> <b>prototype</b> <b>of</b> the prison genre was 1930's The Big House. The picture features future genre staples such as solitary confinement, informers, riots, an escape, and the codes of prison life. Never box office hits, prison pictures failed to attract the female audiences they needed to achieve financial success. The chain gang films were produced in a similar response to the callous inhumanity of the chain gang system which was prevalent among states in the southern US. The 1932 film I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang is considered the seminal movie of the genre, and {{was based on the}} autobiography of Robert E. Burns who was himself a fugitive {{at the time of the}} picture's release.|$|E

ADS 9731 and Sigma Coronae Borealis are multiple star systems with six and five components respectively. Five star systems have been found to have Jupiter-sized exoplanets. Abell 2065 is a highly concentrated galaxy cluster one billion light-years from the Solar System containing more than 400 members, and is itself part of the larger Corona Borealis Supercluster.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>prototype</b> <b>of</b> {{the prison}} genre was The Big House (1930). In The Big House, Robert Montgomery plays a squirmy inmate who is sentenced {{to six years}} after {{committing}} vehicular manslaughter while under the influence. His cell mates are a murderer played by Wallace Beery and a forger played by Chester Morris. The picture features future staples of the prison genre such as solitary confinement, informers, riots, visitations, an escape, and the codes of prison life. The protagonist, Montgomery, ends up being a loathsome character, a coward who will sell anyone in the prison out to get an early release. The film was banned in Ohio, {{the site of the}} deadly prison riots that inspired it. Numbered Men, The Criminal Code, Shadow of the Law, Convict's Code, and others, from no less than seven studios, followed. However, prison films mainly appealed to men, and had weak box office performances as a result.|$|E
5|$|Three of the constellation's {{stars are}} {{visible to the}} naked eye: Alpha Comae Berenices, Beta Comae Berenices and Gamma Comae Berenices. They form a 45-degree triangle, from which Berenice's {{imaginary}} tresses, formed by the Coma Star Cluster, hang. The constellation's brightest star is Beta Comae Berenices, a 4.2-magnitude main sequence star similar to the Sun. Coma Berenices contains the North Galactic Pole and one of the richest known galaxy clusters, the Coma Cluster, part of the Coma Supercluster. Galaxy Malin 1, in the constellation, is the first known giant low-surface-brightness galaxy.

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the crumbling social system outside their walls, the prison film portrayed a universe where the state was all powerful and orderly. Sparked by the Ohio penitentiary fire on April 21, 1930 in which guards refused to release prisoners from their cells causing 300 deaths, the films depicted the inhumane conditions in prisons in the early 1930s. The genre was composed of two archetypes: the prison film and the chain gang film. In the prison film, large hordes of men move about in identical uniforms, resigned to their fate, they live by a well defined code. In the chain gang film, Southern prisoners were subjected to a draconion system in the blazing outdoors where they were treated terribly by their ruthless captors. <b>The</b> <b>prototype</b> <b>of</b> the prison genre was 1930's The Big House. 1932's I am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang is considered the seminal film of the chain gang genre. Although the chain gang film Hell's Highway had beaten Fugitive to the screen two months earlier, it exerted nowhere the influence.|$|E
