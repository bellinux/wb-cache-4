The account in Genesis relates that, before his death, {{he had his}} brothers swear they would carry his bones out of Egypt to Canaan. He is then {{said to have been}} embalmed then placed in a coffin in Egypt. In Exodus, we are told that Moses fulfilled the pledge by taking Joseph's bones with him when he left Egypt. In Joshua, Joseph’s bones are said to have been brought from Egypt by <b>the</b> <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> and interred in Shechem.The bones of Joseph, which <b>the</b> <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> brought up out of Egypt, were buried in Shechem in a parcel of land Jacob bought from the sons of Hamor, father of Shechem, for a hundred pieces of silver (qeśîṭâ)..|$|E

This identification with the Israelites was a response to the sociopolitical realities of their situation in the United States, including slavery and racial discrimination. For African-Americans, appropriating Jewish history was part of a rebellion against the American racial hierarchy that deemed Africans inferior. It was also a means of fulfilling their desire to know their origins and regain their lost history.|$|E

5|$|A major {{figure in}} Islam, Jesus (commonly transliterated as ʾĪsā) is {{considered}} to be a messenger of God (Allah) and the Messiah (al-Masih) who was sent to guide <b>the</b> <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> (Bani Isra'il) with a new scripture, the Gospel (referred to in Islam as Injil). Muslims regard the gospels of the New Testament as inauthentic, and believe that Jesus' original message was lost or altered and that Muhammad came later to restore it. Belief in Jesus (and all other messengers of God) is a requirement for being a Muslim. The Quran mentions Jesus by name 25 times—more often than Muhammad—and emphasizes that Jesus was a mortal human who, like all other prophets, had been divinely chosen to spread God's message. While the Qur'an acknowledges the Virgin birth of Jesus, he {{is considered to}} be neither the incarnation nor the son of God. Islamic texts emphasize a strict notion of monotheism (tawhid) and forbid the association of partners with God, which would be idolatry. Like all prophets in Islam, Jesus is considered a Muslim.|$|E

40|$|Riza Saputra. 2011. <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel’s</b> Covenant in <b>the</b> Qur’ān. Thesis, Tafsir Hadith Department, Ushuluddin Faculty. Supervisors: (I) Dr. Mujiburrahman, M. A, (II) Dr. Wardani, M. Ag. This {{research}} reveals some perspectives <b>of</b> <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> in <b>the</b> Qur’ān {{concerning their}} covenant. The covenant {{is the great}} responsibility: the responsibility to uphold and abide by the law and guidance of God. The Qur'ān mentions that covenant {{is not confined to}} the particular nation and ethnicity, although the covenant was revealed to <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel,</b> it contains a series of universal laws for the whole human race throughout the world. And these instructions, in some forms are comprehensively found in every religion. This research aims at finding the interpretations of key terms <b>of</b> <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel’s</b> covenant in <b>the</b> Qur’ān, <b>the</b> contents <b>of</b> <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel’s</b> covenant mentioned in the Qur’ān, and their responses to this covenant. The method of this research is thematic, with the following steps: defining <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel’s</b> covenant as a research theme, collecting verses of the Qur’ān which refers to <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel’s</b> covenant, arranging verses chronologically within a discussion framework based on contexts of revelation, constructing discussions of the themes within the precise framework systematically, completing the discussion with the relevant ḥadīth (if any) relating to <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel’s</b> covenant in <b>the</b> Qur’ān, and describing <b>the</b> conclusion <b>of</b> <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel’s</b> covenant formulations in the Qur’ān. Having discussed <b>the</b> <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> <b>israel’s</b> covenant in <b>the</b> Qur’ān, this thesis found that: Firstly, the term mīthāq is closely related to the contents of the covenant, and guaranteed by an oath and confession, the term 'ahd is used as a sense of responsibility to keep and maintain the covenant and to remind God’s blessing on them. Secondly, <b>the</b> contents <b>of</b> <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel’s</b> covenant is to act according to what is in the Torah contents, this covenant was made at Sinai at the time of Moses. The Qur’ān recalls this covenant at the time of Messenger of Allah (P. B. U. H.) to criticize the Jews living in Medina. These commandments namely: do not worship any but Allah, do kindness to parents, to the kinsfolk and to the orphans, and the needies, speak kind words to people, keep up the prayer and pay the charity, do not shed your blood, and nor expel one another from your dwellings, believe in the divine prophets and help them respectfully. Thirdly, <b>the</b> responses <b>of</b> <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> to <b>the</b> covenant described in the Qur’ān are ambivalent. On the one hand, they are described as true believers, while on the other, they are presented as infidels...|$|R
50|$|Based on Jewish biblical {{tradition}} and Ethiopian legend via Kebra Nagast, Rastas believe that Israel's King Solomon, together with Ethiopian Queen of Sheba, conceived a <b>child</b> which began <b>the</b> Solomonic line of kings in Ethiopia, rendering the Ethiopian people as <b>the</b> true <b>children</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel,</b> and thereby chosen.

Their only common feature appeared to be the devotion which they showed to the platter and the wine flagon. There was little talking, for there were few who knew their neighbours. Some were soldiers who had come to offer their swords and their services to the King's lieutenant; others were merchants from Bristol, with some proposal or suggestion anent the safety of their property. There were two or three officials of the city, who had come out to receive instructions as to its defence, while here and there I marked <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel,</b> who had found his way there in the hope that in times of trouble he might find high interest and noble borrowers.

Every one <b>of</b> those <b>children</b> died for righteousness, if Christ is righteousness; for they died upon his account, as being supposed to be he himself. Thus also <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel's</b> little ones, that were murdered with their parents, or otherwise, because of the religion of them that begat and bare them, died for righteousness. The same may be said concerning those of them that suffered {{in the land of the}} Chaldeans upon the same account. I might here also bring in those poor infants that in Ireland, Piedmont, Paris, and other places, have had their throats cut, and their brains dashed out against the walls, for none other cause but for the religion of their fathers. Many, many have suffered for righteousness after this manner. Their will, nor consent, has been in the suffering, yet they have suffered for religion, for righteousness. And as this hath been, so it may be again; for if men may yet suffer for righteousness, even so, for ought I know, even in this sense, may their children also.|$|R

There is also the expectation that Selassie will return {{for a day of}} judgment and bring home <b>the</b> lost <b>children</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel,</b> which in Rastafarianism refer to those taken from Africa through the slave trade.

500|$|Though the {{congregation}} continued to grow, most new Jewish immigrants to Memphis were from Eastern Europe, and more traditional than <b>the</b> members <b>of</b> <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel.</b> As a result, they typically formed their own Orthodox synagogues, {{the oldest and}} longest-lasting {{of which was the}} Baron Hirsch Synagogue. Members <b>of</b> <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> worked to assist the Eastern European Jews in assimilating into American society, providing financial assistance, free education on topics such as English, civics, and even hygiene, and from 1897 to 1907 they held a Sunday School for <b>children</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Baron Hirsch congregation. In 1890, <b>the</b> membership <b>of</b> <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> was 186 families, and the religious school had 148 students. To deal with persistent financial issues and attract younger members, in 1897 {{the congregation}} created a new class of member, the [...] "seatholder", who could not be elected to any office, but paid less in return. This innovation was successful; 47 new members joined in 1898, and the congregation's total membership reached 222 families. Combined with cost cuts in other areas (primarily reducing the amount paid to the choir), this pulled the synagogue out of a four-year financial deficit.|$|R
25|$|Professor George Coats, former of Lexington Theological Seminary, {{argued that}} the Joseph {{narrative}} is a literary device constructed to carry <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> from Canaan to Egypt, to link preexisting stories of ancestral promises in Canaan to an Exodus narrative of oppression in and liberation from Egypt. Coats described the two principal goals of the Joseph story as (1) to describe reconciliation in a broken family {{despite the lack of}} merit of any of its members, and (2) to describe the characteristics of an ideal administrator.|$|E
25|$|According to the Bible, <b>the</b> <b>Children</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> {{conquered the}} Golan from the Amorites. The Bible {{also says that}} the area, known as Bashan, was {{inhabited}} by two Israelite tribes {{during the time of}} Joshua, the tribe of Dan and Manasseh. The city of Golan was a city of refuge. King Solomon appointed ministers in the region. After the split of the United Monarchy, the area was contested between the northern Kingdom of Israel and the Aramean kingdom from the 9th century BC. King Ahab of Israel (reigned 874–852 BC) defeated Ben-Hadad I in Afek of the southern Golan.|$|E
25|$|Vesey {{developed}} followers {{among the}} mostly enslaved {{blacks in the}} Second Presbyterian Church and then the independent AME African Church. Its congregation represented more than 10% of the blacks in the city. They resented the harassment by city officials. Economic conditions in the Charleston area became difficult since an economic decline affected the city. In the year of 1821, Vesey {{and a few other}} slaves began to conspire and plan a revolt. In order for the revolt to be successful, Vesey had to recruit others and strengthen his army. Because Denmark Vesey was a lay preacher, when he had recruited enough followers, he would review the plans of the revolts with the others at his home during the religious classes. Vesey inspired slaves by connecting their potential freedom to the biblical story of the delivery of <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> <b>Israel</b> from Egyptian slavery.|$|E

Even Sarmatia may furnish a weeping willow. The law has told him that he must pluck the fruit of goodly trees, and the Rabbins have explained that goodly fruit on this occasion is confined to the citron. Perhaps, in his despair, he is obliged to fly to the candied delicacies of the grocer.
