5|$|The ratings also do {{not reflect}} state-specific {{population}} conditions. For instance, for the <b>Texas</b> <b>horned</b> <b>lizard,</b> much of eastern Texas has lost the animal. Nevertheless, based on healthy populations {{in other parts of}} the West, especially New Mexico, the IUCN rates the animal Least Concern. For the timber rattlesnake (West Virginia), the IUCN notes the animal as losing range in many parts of the northeastern U.S., but because the animal is numerous in the southern Appalachians, it is also Least Concern.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the hypothesis that}} the squirting of blood from orbital sinuses by <b>Texas</b> <b>horned</b> <b>lizards</b> (Phrynosoma cornutum) is an antipredator defense against some mammalian species. Coyotes (Canis latrans) were tested for the first time. As expected, <b>Texas</b> <b>horned</b> <b>lizards</b> squirted blood in response to coyote attacks, and coyotes exhibited startle response, avoidance response, or both {{as a result of these}} events. Whereas lizard carcasses mixed into normal foodmash elicited regurgitation by coyotes, possibly due to physical effects, blood of <b>horned</b> <b>lizards</b> similarly mixed into food did not. Coyote responses to simulated squirts of 5 compounds, including blood of <b>horned</b> <b>lizards,</b> into 3 potential sensory target areas (eyes, nose, and mouth) strongly suggested that aversive effects were mediated by receptors in the oral or nasal cavities. Coyote responses were more frequent to delivery of blood plasma and whole blood of Phrynosoma to buccal and nasal membranes than to delivery of plasma and blood from spiny lizards (Sceloporus jarrovii) or to delivery of a saline control to these membranes. We concluded that <b>Texas</b> <b>horned</b> <b>lizards</b> squirt blood from sinuses surrounding the eyes during attacks by canids, such as coyotes, and that this blood affects oral receptors, causing a negative response in coyote attack behavior that potentially increases survival of the lizards...|$|R

5|$|Texas {{honored the}} <b>Texas</b> <b>horned</b> <b>lizard</b> in 1993, but private Texas Christian University {{has had the}} {{associated}} mascot the Horned Frog since 1896. According to legend, the football team identified with the lizards found on the practice field as the athletes and reptiles were similarly scrappy. The college founder's son, Addison Clark Jr., a faculty member and the initiator of the football team, had been fascinated by the creatures. By 1897, the lizard appeared as a logo {{on the front of}} the school yearbook, which Clark had also started and was managing.|$|E
5|$|A few {{vertebrate}} {{species such}} as the <b>Texas</b> <b>horned</b> <b>lizard</b> are able to shoot squirts of blood from their eyes, by rapidly increasing the blood pressure within the eye sockets, if threatened. Because an individual may lose up to 53% of blood in a single squirt, this is only used against persistent predators like foxes, wolves and coyotes (Canidae), as a last defence. Canids often drop horned lizards after being squirted, and attempt to wipe or shake the blood out of their mouths, suggesting that the fluid has a foul taste; they choose other lizards if given the choice, suggesting a learned aversion towards horned lizards as prey.|$|E
25|$|Over the years, {{their numbers}} have been declining, and this has often been {{attributed}} to competition for food with the invasive red imported fire ant and the Argentine ant.

40|$|Correlative and process-based {{approaches}} to describing the ecological niche in a spatially explicit fashion {{have often been}} compared in an adversarial framework. We sought to compare niche models developed via classic (correlative only), niche (process-based information), and hybridized (correlative augmented with process-based derived information) approaches, {{with the goal of}} determining if the added effort of process-based model development yielded better model fit. Correlative data layers (i. e., habitat models) included vegetation community types, Euclidean distance statistics, neighborhood analyses, and topographically-derived information. Mechanistic data layers were estimates of thermal suitability derived from field-collected datasets and biophysical calculations, and estimates of prey biomass interpolated from monitoring stations. We applied these models at high resolution (1 m × 1 m pixel size) to habitat occupied by a population of <b>Texas</b> <b>horned</b> <b>lizards</b> (Phrynosoma cornutum) located in central Oklahoma. Results suggested that our treatment of process-based information offered dramatically better identification of suitable habitat when compared to correlative information, but that these results were likely due to low variability of niche variable pixel values. Niche layers nearly perfectly predicted lizard locations; the interpretation of these results suggest that lizards occupy habitat based on thermal suitability over the duration of a field season. Given the low variability observed in thermal suitability layers, we question the ecological reality of these predictions. Correlative models may accurately describe the niche at small spatial scales, and may suffice in situations where time and financial resources are limiting constraints on project goals. Process-based information continues to be {{an important part of the}} niche, and may offer additional predictive accuracy via correlative approaches when included in an ecologically meaningful context...|$|R
40|$|Disturbance due to habitat {{restoration}} and urbanization can threaten populations of sensitive wildlife species. I examined 2 {{aspects of the}} ecology of <b>Texas</b> <b>horned</b> <b>lizards</b> (Phrynosoma cornutum), a Species of Special Concern in Oklahoma. I studied the effects of native prairie {{restoration and}} urban development on a population of P. cornutum on an urban wildlife reserve at Tinker Air Force Base, Oklahoma. I also studied population vital rate variation in 2 populations of P. cornutum using deterministic elasticity and life-stage simulation analyses. My research {{on the effects of}} habitat disturbance on urban P. cornutum focused on Wildlife Reserve 3 (WR 3) at Tinker Air Force Base, which has a population of P. cornutum that has persisted for many years. I quantified daily movement rates, home-range size, changes in spatial distribution, survival rates, and population size and density over 9 years (2003 - 2011). Movement rates of P. cornutum were affected by a 3 -way interaction of sex, period (reproductive vs. non-reproductive), and study stage (2004 - 2005, 2007 - 2008, and 2009 - 2011). Stages represented variation in the type and level of anthropogenic disturbance on the site. Home-range size did not vary by sex, but was smaller during the non-reproductive period than the reproductive period. Spatial analyses indicated that disturbances due to restoration activities had little effect on the spatial distribution of P. cornutum on WR 3. Survival was affected by season (inactive-season survival was higher), stage (declining survival in later stages with more disturbance), an interaction of season and stage, and disturbance (covariate of proportion of an individual 2 ̆ 7 s home range in disturbed areas for a given year; small negative effect), with little evidence for variation in survival by sex. Major causes of mortality included depredation and anthropogenic causes. I estimated a population size of 32. 9 ± 4. 7 (95...|$|R

2500|$|The fauna in {{the state}} is just {{as diverse as the}} flora and varies greatly due to the large {{contrast}} in climates. In the mountain zone of the state the most observed mammals are: Mexican fox squirrel (Sciurus nayaritensis), antelope jackrabbit (Lepus alleni), raccoon (Procyon lotor), hooded skunk (Mephitis macroura), wild boar (Sus scrofa), collared peccary (Pecari tajacu), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus), mule deer Odocoileus hemionus, American bison Bison bison, cougar (Puma concolor), eastern cottontail Sylvilagus floridanus, North American porcupine Erethizon dorsatum, bobcat Lynx rufus, Mexican wolf Canis lupus baileyi, and coyote Canis latrans. American black bear Ursus americanus is also found but in very small numbers. The Mexican wolf, once abundant, has been extirpated. The main cause of degradation has been grazing. Although there are many reptilian species in the mountains the most observed species include: Northern Mexican pine snake, Pituophis deppei jani, <b>Texas</b> <b>horned</b> <b>lizard</b> (Phrynosoma cornutum), rock rattlesnake (Crotalus lepidus), black-tailed rattlesnake [...] (Crotalus molossus), and plateau tiger salamander Ambystoma velasci, one of possibly many amphibians {{to be found in the}} mountains.|$|E
40|$|I studied {{translocation}} of <b>Texas</b> <b>horned</b> <b>lizards</b> on Tinker Air Force Base, Midwest City, Oklahoma, using correlative and mechanistic habitat suitability models. My {{goals were}} broadly classified into two categories: first, {{to determine if}} the addition of mechanistic data layers (i. e., habitat-niche models) in a correlative model improved the overall accuracy of model predictions, and second, to apply the best model produced from my dataset to a planned translocation event on Tinker Air Force Base. Correlative data layers (i. e., habitat models) included typically applied datasets such as vegetative components, Euclidean distance statistics, neighborhood analyses, and topographically-derived information. Mechanistic data layers were estimates of thermal suitability derived from field-collected datasets and biophysical calculations, and estimates of prey availability taken from interpolated datasets. I estimated habitat suitability using the partitioned Mahalanobis distance statistic, which is a suitable model technique for presence-only data. Translocated and resident lizards were monitored via radiotelemetry and using fluorescent powder trails. Telemetry locations and powder trails were overlaid onto habitat suitability models to provide the datasets used to quantify interaction between site occupancy and habitat model predictions. Lizard paths were tested against random walk models to determine efficiency of travel, and site occupancy metrics (powder track and telemetry Mahalanobis distance values) were tested using parametric (repeated-measures ANOVA) and nonparametric (Wilcoxon rank-sum and signed-rank tests) tests. Mechanistic data layers did not substantially improve model accuracy over correlative-only layers, and data layers taken from mixed bare soil-vegetation, shrub, and grassland habitat types dominated important eigenvector weights. Analyses of fluorescent powder track data suggested that lizards did not move through habitat differently from a random walk model, potentially due to neighborhood factor loadings strongly influencing the area in which entire trails traveled. Wilcoxon tests and repeated-measures ANOVA results suggested that although lizards experienced different median Mahalanobis distance values by group (translocated, resident), there appeared to be an overall decrease in distance scores for translocated individuals over time. In this context, translocated individuals seemed to acclimate their behavior to areas that were predicted to be more suitable by Mahalanobis classifiers. Although survival results were not encouraging and habitat models did not suggest that my translocation site was ideal, my data supports the idea that translocations may be aided in the future by modeling efforts. My models suggest that mechanistic data layers may not improve classification accuracy over correlative processes, but {{this may be due to}} inaccurate representation of specific mechanisms over spatial and temporal scales. Future work should focus on including more explicit measures of mechanisms, as well as broadening biotic influences on species distributions (i. e., predator distribution, intra- and interspecific competition) ...|$|R
