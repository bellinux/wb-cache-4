5|$|Fingerspelling {{is a form}} of borrowing, a {{linguistic}} process wherein words from one language are incorporated into another. In ASL, fingerspelling is used for proper nouns and for <b>technical</b> <b>terms</b> with no native ASL equivalent. There are also some other loan words which are fingerspelled, either very short English words or abbreviations of longer English words, e.g. O-N from English 'on', and A-P-T from English 'apartment'. Fingerspelling may also be used to emphasize a word that would normally be signed otherwise.|$|E

5|$|Mathematicians {{use some}} <b>technical</b> <b>terms</b> when {{discussing}} tilings. An edge is the intersection between two bordering tiles; {{it is often}} a straight line. A vertex {{is the point of}} intersection of three or more bordering tiles. Using these terms, an isogonal or vertex-transitive tiling is a tiling where every vertex point is identical; that is, the arrangement of polygons about each vertex is the same. The fundamental region is a shape such as a rectangle that is repeated to form the tessellation. For example, a regular tessellation of the plane with squares has a meeting of four squares at every vertex.|$|E

5|$|In June 1940, the Government of Madras {{appointed}} a committee headed by Srinivasa Sastri to frame {{a set of}} general principles for coining words for scientific and <b>technical</b> <b>terms</b> in vernacular languages. The constitution of the committee was strongly condemned by the Madras Presidency Tamil Sangam and its Secretary E. M. Subramania Pillai who felt that Srinivasa Sastri was biased in favour of Sanskrit and hence, Anti-Tamil. The committee submitted its report after three months recommending the retention of the existing Sanskrit loanwords in Tamil and rejecting the need {{for them to be}} replaced. The deliberations of the Sastri Committee provoked widespread agitations in Madras Presidency. The committee was eventually reshuffled by Provincial Education Minister T. S. Avinashilingam Chettiar soon after the demise of Srinivasa Sastri and balanced with the introduction of more members supporting the replacement of Sanskrit loan words.|$|E
