5|$|Jade burial suit: Burial suits made of jade {{existed in}} China during the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD). Confirming ancient records about Han royalty and nobility buried in jade burial suits, archaeologists {{discovered}} in June 1968 the tombs and jade burial suits of Prince Liu Sheng (d. 113 BC) {{and his wife}} Dou Wan in Hebei province. Liu's suit, in twelve flexible sections, comprised 2,690 square pieces of green jade with holes punctured in {{the four corners of}} each piece so that they could be sewn together with gold <b>thread.</b> <b>The</b> total weight of the gold thread used in his suit was 1,110 g (39oz). Princess Dou Wan's suit had 2,156 pieces of jade stitched together with 703 g (24.7oz) of gold thread. Although jade burial outer wears and head masks appear in tombs of the early Han Dynasty, burial suits did not appear until the reign of Emperor Wen of Han (r. 180–157 BC), with the earliest being found in the Shizishan site. A total of 22 Western Han (202 BC– 9 AD) and 27 Eastern Han (25–220 AD) complete and partial jade burial suits were uncovered between 1954 and 1996. They are found mainly in Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu and Henan, as well as at Yangjiawan, Dongyuan, Guangzhou, Mawangdui, Mianyang and Shizhaishan. The jade burial suit gradually disappeared when it was forbidden in 222 by Emperor Wen of Wei.|$|E
5|$|Radamel Falcao {{replaced}} Rémy {{after the}} break and his long-range shot in the 48th minute was blocked. Although Chelsea started the half well, it was Arsenal who fashioned the notable chances before the hour mark. In the 50th minute Santi Cazorla attempted to <b>thread</b> <b>the</b> ball through Chelsea's defence for Walcott to reach but his pass was cleared. Two minutes later Coquelin over-hit his pass which was directed to Özil, who roamed freely. Chelsea made another change, this time Oscar in place of Ramires in the 53rd minute. Seven minutes later Chelsea came close to scoring when Eden Hazard managed to evade his markers, but through on goal failed to get his shot on target, hitting over. Azpilicueta was shown the game's first yellow card for pulling Oxlade-Chamberlain back; Mourinho {{made the decision to}} substitute him with Kurt Zouma in the 69th minute. Giroud came on for Walcott moments before, and immediately was involved in the action, shooting high and then from long range.|$|E

5|$|The {{national}} flag has {{a length of}} 2.20meters and a width of 1.47m, a ratio of 2 to 3. The field is split into three horizontal colored bands, a yellow band of one-half the flag's width, a blue band of one-quarter the width, and a red band of one-quarter the width. All three bands extend {{the full length of}} the flag. The flag is charged with the Ecuadorian coat of arms scaled to one-half the width of the flag and centered in the field. The coat of arms itself is constructed in a rectangle with proportions 12:10. The national standard has the same design as the {{national flag}}, but is square, with length 0.9m and width 0.9m. When used by military units and organizations, lettering can encircle the coat of arms with a diameter of 55 centimeters. The lettering must be 4cm in height, 3cm in width, gold-colored Roman font, embroidered with gold <b>thread.</b> <b>The</b> only other regulated size is a table flag (banderola) where the flag is 200mm wide and 300mm long. When manufacturing the national flag, sellers to the public must include the name of their company, along with the year of manufacture, by placing a 20 × 10mm tag on the reverse side of the flag on the sleeve.|$|E

25|$|The {{greatest}} disadvantage is {{the difficulty}} in machining such a <b>thread.</b> <b>The</b> single-point cutting tools or taps and dies used to cut the thread cannot have efficient rake and relief angles (because of the square form), which makes the cutting slow and difficult. Square threads also cannot carry as much load as a trapezoidal thread, because {{the root of the}} square thread is smaller. Also, {{there is no way to}} compensate for wear on the nut, so it must be replaced when worn out.|$|E
25|$|After {{strengthening}} the first <b>thread,</b> <b>the</b> spider {{continues to make}} a Y-shaped netting. The first three radials of the web are now constructed. More radials are added, {{making sure that the}} distance between each radial and the next is small enough to cross. This means that the number of radials in a web directly depends {{on the size of the}} spider plus the size of the web. It is common for a web to be about 20 times the size of the spider building it.|$|E
25|$|The Acme thread form has a 29° {{thread angle}} with a thread height {{half of the}} pitch; the apex (or crest) and valley (or root) are flat. This shape is easier to machine (faster cutting, longer tool life) than is a square <b>thread.</b> <b>The</b> tooth shape also has a wider base which means it is {{stronger}} (thus, the screw can carry a greater load) than a similarly sized square thread. This thread form also allows {{for the use of}} a split nut, which can compensate for nut wear.|$|E

25|$|Cotton lisle is a finely-spun, tightly twisted type {{of cotton}} that is noted for being strong and durable. Lisle is {{composed}} of two strands that have each been twisted an extra twist per inch than ordinary yarns and combined to create a single <b>thread.</b> <b>The</b> yarn is spun {{so that it is}} compact and solid. This cotton is used mainly for underwear, stockings, and gloves. Colors applied to this yarn are noted for being more brilliant than colors applied to softer yarn. This type of thread was first made in the city of Lisle, France (now Lille), hence its name.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{difficulty}} of travel in the 19th century, villages in Palestine remained isolated. As a result, clothing and accessories became a statement of region. In Ramallah, the back panels of dresses often incorporated a palm tree motif embroidered in cross-stitch. Ramallah women were famous for their distinctive dress of white linen fabric embroidered with red silk <b>thread.</b> <b>The</b> headdress or smadeh worn in Ramallah was common throughout northern Palestine: a small roundish cap, padded and stiffened, with gold and silver coins set in a fringe with a long veil pinned to the back, sometimes of silk and sometimes embroidered.|$|E
25|$|At this point, {{the thread}} is woven. Depending on the era, one person could manage {{anywhere}} from 3 to 100 machines. In the mid nineteenth century, four was the standard number. A skilled weaver in 1925 would run 6 Lancashire Looms. As time progressed new mechanisms were added that stopped the loom any time something went wrong. The mechanisms checked {{for such things}} as a broken warp thread, broken weft <b>thread,</b> <b>the</b> shuttle going straight across, and if the shuttle was empty. Forty of these Northrop Looms or automatic looms could be operated by one skilled worker.|$|E
5000|$|Tartan is {{recorded}} by counting <b>the</b> <b>threads</b> of each colour {{that appear in}} <b>the</b> sett. <b>The</b> <b>thread</b> count not only describes {{the width of the}} stripes on a sett, but also the colours used.

Though thread counts are indeed quite specific, they can be modified in certain circumstances, depending on the desired size of the tartan. For example, the sett of a tartan (about 6 inches) may be too large to fit upon the face of a necktie.

25|$|Of all of Pape's works, TtEias (1979) {{is perhaps}} most emblematic of her artistic process.

The artwork consists of nine semi-transparent prisms, which were created using gold thread. A square platform drilled with nails serves as the base of each prism. The gold thread is then wrapped around each protruding nail, from floor to ceiling, to create the prism. Light is shined onto the prisms at various angles, emphasizing the metallic sheen of the <b>thread.</b> <b>The</b> exhibition space is otherwise dark, giving the allusion that the prisms continue infinitely upwards.|$|E
25|$|Most bonnets {{are joined}} to the corselet by 1/8th turn {{interrupted}} <b>thread.</b> <b>The</b> helmet neck thread is placed onto {{the neck of}} the corselet facing the divers left front, where the threads do not engage, and then rotated forward, engaging the thread and seating on a leather gasket to make a watertight seal. The helmet usually has a safety lock which prevents the bonnet from rotating back and separating underwater. Other styles of connection are also used, with the joint secured by clamps or bolts (usually three). Some helmets were made with the bonnet and corselet in one piece and secured to the suit in other ways.|$|E
25|$|The {{torsion balance}} {{consists}} of a bar suspended from its middle by a thin fiber. The fiber acts as a very weak torsion spring. In Coulomb's experiment, the torsion balance was an insulating rod with a metal-coated ball attached to one end, suspended by a silk <b>thread.</b> <b>The</b> ball was charged with a known charge of static electricity, and a second charged ball of the same polarity was brought near it. The two charged balls repelled one another, twisting the fiber through a certain angle, which could be read from a scale on the instrument. By knowing how much force it took to twist the fiber through a given angle, Coulomb was able to calculate the force between the balls and derive his inverse-square proportionality law.|$|E
5000|$|Thread crashes a process: {{an illegal}} {{operation}} {{performed by a}} <b>thread</b> crashes <b>the</b> entire process; therefore, one misbehaving <b>thread</b> can disrupt <b>the</b> processing of all <b>the</b> other <b>threads</b> in <b>the</b> application.|$|R
5000|$|Jam Nuts - Two nuts, {{tightened}} on each other. In {{this application}} a thinner nut {{should be placed}} adjacent to the joint, and a thicker nut tightened onto it. The thicker nut applies more force to the joint, first relieving the force on <b>the</b> <b>threads</b> of <b>the</b> thinner nut and then applying a force in the opposite direction. In this way the thicker nut presses tightly {{on the side of}} <b>the</b> <b>threads</b> away from <b>the</b> joint, while the thinner nut presses on the side of <b>the</b> <b>threads</b> nearest <b>the</b> joint, tightly locking the two nuts against <b>the</b> <b>threads</b> in both directions.|$|R
50|$|When weaving on a loom, {{the beads}} {{are locked in}} between <b>the</b> warp <b>threads</b> by <b>the</b> weft <b>threads.</b> <b>The</b> most common bead weaving {{technique}} requires two passes of <b>the</b> weft <b>thread.</b> First, an entire row of beads is strung on <b>the</b> weft <b>thread.</b> Then <b>the</b> beads are pressed in between <b>the</b> warp <b>threads.</b> <b>The</b> needle is passed back through the beads above <b>the</b> warp <b>threads</b> to lock <b>the</b> beads into place. Heddle looms were popular {{near the beginning of}} the 20th century. They allowed weaving of beads by raising every other thread and inserting strung beads in the shed, the space between the lowered and raised threads. There are still a few Heddle Bead Looms being manufactured today. The most difficult part of loomwork is finishing off <b>the</b> warp <b>threads.</b>|$|R
