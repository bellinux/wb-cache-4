5|$|Edward {{appears in}} his world, reunited with Alphonse and their friend Winry Rockbell, who fits Edward with new automail limbs. The Amestris {{military}} manages to stop most of Eckhart's soldiers {{with the help}} of Roy Mustang. Edward battles Eckhart before Alphonse transmutes parts of his soul to a group of armors, which attack her and force her to retreat. Upon reappearing in her own world, Eckhart is covered with shadow creatures from <b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>and</b> killed by an officer out of alarm of her new, monstrous appearance. Understanding the danger posed by the connection between the two worlds, Edward returns to Earth to seal the Gate on the other side, knowing he will be trapped there forever. Instead of sealing the Gate on the other world's side as per Edward's request, however, Alphonse has Mustang seal <b>the</b> <b>Gate</b> <b>and</b> follows Edward to remain with his brother. Following Alfons' funeral, the Elric brothers leave Munich with Noah, intending to close <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> <b>and</b> destroy the weapons meant to be used in Hitler's attack. They enjoy their new lives together as they leave Germany with Noah, while on the Elric brothers homeworld, their friends go back to their normal lives.|$|E

The gates themselves were normally wooden with metal covering plates to prevent destruction by fire. Some gates had portcullises.

5|$|Fort Ricasoli {{was active}} in the defence of Malta during World War II, and on 26 July 1941, its guns helped repel an Italian attack on the Grand Harbour. In April 1942, <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> <b>and</b> Governor's House were {{destroyed}} by German aerial bombardment. After the war, the fort was commissioned as HMS Ricasoli between 1947 and 1958, and was used as a naval barracks. In 1958, the gate was rebuilt, although the design was slightly different from the original. The Governor's House was never reconstructed, mainly for financial reasons. In 1964, the Admiralty transferred control of the fort to the government of Malta.|$|E

5|$|The {{report on}} the crash in Dryden criticised {{approaches}} to deicing. It made several points, including recommending the use of Type II deicing fluid rather than Type I, deicing trucks near the runway rather than at <b>the</b> <b>gate,</b> <b>and</b> that the crew should inspect their wings {{not only from the}} cockpit, but also the cabin. The report concluded that competitive pressures caused by commercial deregulation cut into safety standards and that many of the industry’s sloppy practices and questionable procedures were placing pilots in difficult situations.|$|E
5|$|After {{realizing that}} no {{reinforcements}} would come, Thomas decided {{to launch a}} counter offensive. Early in {{the third week of}} September 634, Thomas drew men from all sectors of the city to form a force strong enough to break through the Gate of Thomas. He was there faced by Shurahbil with his corps of about 5,000 men. The Byzantine attack began with a concentrated shower of arrows against the Muslims. The Byzantine infantry, covered by the archers on the wall, rushed through <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> <b>and</b> fanned out into battle formation. Thomas himself led the assault. During this action, Thomas was struck in his right eye by an arrow. Unsuccessful in breaking the Muslim lines, the Byzantines retreated back to the fortress. The wounded Thomas is said to have sworn to take a thousand eyes in return. He ordered another great sortie for that night.|$|E

5|$|Finucane {{continued}} to the pedestrian gate where he stabbed the officer controlling <b>the</b> <b>gate,</b> <b>and</b> two officers {{who had just}} entered the prison. This incident was seen by a soldier on duty in a watch tower, who reported to the British Army operations room {{that he had seen}} prison officers fighting. The operations room telephoned the prison's Emergency Control Room (ECR), which replied that everything was all right and that an alarm had been accidentally triggered earlier. At 4:12 pm the alarm was raised when an officer in the gatehouse pushed the prisoner holding him hostage {{out of the room and}} telephoned the ECR. However, this was not done soon enough to prevent the escape. After several attempts the prisoners had opened the main gate, and were waiting for the prisoners still in the gatehouse to rejoin them in the lorry. At this time two prison officers blocked the exit with their cars, forcing the prisoners to abandon the lorry and make their way to the outer fence which was 25 yards away. Four prisoners attacked one of the officers and hijacked his car, which they drove towards the external gate. They crashed into a car near <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> <b>and</b> abandoned the car. Two escaped through the gate, one was captured exiting the car, and another was captured after being chased by a soldier. At the main gate, a prison officer was shot in the leg while chasing the only two prisoners who had not yet reached the outer fence. The prisoner who fired the shot was captured after being shot and wounded by a soldier in a watch tower, and the other prisoner was captured after falling. The other prisoners escaped over the fence, and by 4:18 pm the main gate was closed and the prison secured, after 35 prisoners had breached the prison perimeter. The escape was the biggest in both British and Irish history, and the biggest in Europe since World War II.|$|E
5|$|In 1903, {{the demise}} of wooden covered bridge would be seen, as a storm, dubbed the Pumpkin Flood of 1903, struck in October of that year. The storm struck both communities, and the bridge in between, causing the loss of many lives, and on October 17, the toll {{collector}} on the bridge closed off <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> <b>and</b> did not allow any person to cross. At 6:40 that evening, a crash was heard, and seconds later, the bridge was no more, after tumbling into the Delaware River below. Remnants of the bridge were swept downstream, and smashed {{on the side of}} the new Northampton Street Bridge, constructed just a few years before. After the storm cleared, the community of Belvidere put a ferry to Riverton back in almost immediately.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the medieval}} walls of Mdina were {{gradually}} dismantled between the 1530s and 1720s, when the city's fortifications were being upgraded by the Hospitallers. One {{of the most significant}} visible remnants {{of the medieval}} fortifications is the Greeks Gate and the surrounding curtain walls, which still retains its medieval form apart from the outer portal which was built in the 18th century. Parts of the double walls, including the remains of two gun loops, still stand between <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> <b>and</b> the Torre dello Standardo. Most of the northern and eastern walls date back to the medieval period, although some sections were rebuilt by the Hospitallers. The northern ramparts contain a medieval wall tower, while the remains of Byzantine antemurals and the foundations of a late 15th-century artillery platform have been found in the eastern walls.|$|E

5|$|The 2/2nd Infantry Battalion, {{supported}} by the three Matilda tanks and the guns of the 7th Medium Regiment, advanced down the Wadi Scemmas towards an Italian fort on the southern headland of Bardia. After some hours of climbing, the 2/2nd reached the headland and attacked the fort at 1645. Inside the fort were two 6inch guns, two field guns and five other guns of the fort. Fortunately, the 6inch guns were for coastal defence and were unable to fire inland. One of the tanks made straight for {{the gate of the}} fort. The Italians opened <b>the</b> <b>gate,</b> <b>and</b> the tanks moved inside, taking the garrison of 300 prisoners. D Company then followed a goat track that led to lower Bardia. Thousands of prisoners were taken, most from service units. Two carriers of the 2/5th Infantry Battalion patrolling near the coast captured 1,500 prisoners. Captain N. A. Vickery, a forward observer from the 2/1st Field Regiment, attacked an Italian battery in his Bren gun carrier and captured 1,000 prisoners.|$|E
5|$|The vessels {{have four}} decks, upon {{which there are}} cabins and saloons for merchants. Several of these 'mysria' contain {{cupboards}} and other conveniences; they have doors which can be locked, and keys for their occupiers. (The merchants) take with them their wives and concubines. It often happens that a man can be in his cabin without others on board realizing it, {{and they do not}} see him until the vessel has arrived in some port. The sailors also have their children in such cabins; and (in some parts of the ship) they sew garden herbs, vegetables, and ginger in wooden tubs. The Commander of such a vessel is a great Emir; when he lands, the archers and the Ethiops (i.e. black slaves, yet in China these men-at-arms would have most likely been Malays) march before him bearing javelins and swords, with drums beating and trumpets blowing. When he arrives at the guesthouse where he is to stay, they set up their lances on each side of <b>the</b> <b>gate,</b> <b>and</b> mount guard throughout his visit.|$|E
5|$|At the top-secret Icarus Base, {{the group}} is {{introduced}} to Colonel Everett Young (Louis Ferreira), Colonel David Telford (Lou Diamond Phillips), and First Lieutenant Matthew Scott (Brian J. Smith). Wallace's solution is tested but fails to establish a lock. During dinner, three Ha'tak vessels, believed {{to be under the}} control of the Lucian Alliance, attack the planet. An evacuation is begun while the Hammond which is manned by Colonel Samantha Carter (Amanda Tapping) and a squadron of F-302s led by Colonel Telford battle the enemy. Rush, desperate to see his project succeed, enlists Wallace's aid in figuring out what went wrong. Wallace suggests that the final symbol of the address is wrong, and that they should use the symbol for Earth. Rush aborts the dialing sequence to Earth, arguing that the energy release from the exploding planet could follow them through <b>the</b> <b>Gate,</b> <b>and</b> tests the theory, which succeeds. With the planet's unstable core about to go critical and lacking any other means of escape, the remaining survivors in the base (roughly 80 people) are forced to risk heading to an unknown destination. The planet explodes shortly after everyone is evacuated, destroying the three Ha'tak vessels. The Hammond survives, but the fate of those in the base is a mystery to Stargate Command.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>gated</b> {{structures}} {{stay open}} during normal, non-tropical conditions. When storm surge threatens {{to exceed the}} maximum operating water level of a canal, the Corps closes <b>the</b> <b>gates</b> <b>and</b> operates <b>the</b> pumps. Interior pumps operated by the Sewerage and Water Board pump rainwater out of the sub-basin and into the outfall canals. The interim pumps then pump rainwater out of the outfall canals, around <b>the</b> <b>gates</b> <b>and</b> into Lake Pontchartrain. <b>The</b> closed <b>gates</b> reduce <b>the</b> risk of storm surge entering the canals and threatening the city. When the surge recedes to a safe level, <b>the</b> <b>gates</b> are reopened <b>and</b> normal drainage resumes.|$|R

5|$|Despite its {{ceremonial}} role, the Golden Gate {{was one of}} {{the stronger}} positions along the walls of the city, withstanding several attacks during the various sieges. With the addition of transverse walls on the peribolos between the inner and outer walls, it formed a virtually separate fortress. Its military value was recognized by John VI Kantakouzenos (r. 1347–1354), who records that it was virtually impregnable, capable of holding provisions for three years and defying the whole city if need be. He repaired the marble towers and garrisoned the fort with loyal Catalan soldiers, but had to surrender it to John V Palaiologos (r. 1341–1391) when he abdicated in 1354. John V undid Kantakouzenos' repairs and left it unguarded, but in 1389–90 he too rebuilt and expanded the fortress, erecting two towers behind <b>the</b> <b>gate</b> <b>and</b> extending a wall some 350 m to the sea walls, thus forming a separate fortified enceinte inside the city to serve as a final refuge. In the event, John V was soon after forced to flee there from a coup led by his grandson, John VII. The fort held out successfully in the subsequent siege that lasted several months, and in which cannons were possibly employed. In 1391 however, John V was compelled to raze the fort by Sultan Bayezid I (r. 1382–1402), who otherwise threatened to blind his son Manuel, whom he held captive. Emperor John VIII Palaiologos (r. 1425–1448) attempted to rebuild it in 1434, but was thwarted by Sultan Murad II.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, the Environment Agency {{constructed}} a tidal barrier {{at the mouth}} of the river. The structure spans the river, and a huge steel gate, weighing 202 tonnes, can be lowered into the waterway, effectively sealing the river from the Humber, and preventing tidal surges from moving up the river and flooding parts of the city and the low-lying areas beyond. The gate is lowered between eight and twelve times a year, and protects around 17,000 properties. In 2009, a £10million upgrade of the structure was started, to ensure it would stay operational for a further 30 years. The upgrade included a new drive mechanism, which raises and lowers <b>the</b> <b>gate,</b> <b>and</b> pivots it when it is at the top of the structure, so that it lies horizontally rather than vertically. It also included a new control system. In July 2017 the barrier was granted Grade II listed status. Plans have been considered to build a barrage {{at the mouth of}} the Hull where it joins the Humber Estuary to maintain a constant water level as it passes through the city. The idea was first raised by the Abercrombie report, which considered how to redevelop Hull after significant destruction during the Second World War. The estimated cost of such a project was around £195million in 2007.|$|E
