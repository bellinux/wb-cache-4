50|$|Hydrodyne {{produced}} {{many different}} hulls ranging from small runabouts {{all the way}} up to house boats. Hydrodyne is mostly remembered for its signature Ski boats that ran <b>twin</b> <b>outboards</b> in many ski shows throughout the 1960s through the 1990s. A few manufacturers, specifically Tom Miller Boats and Dyna-Ski boat company still make the 18 foot and 20 foot models that can accept up to 3 outboard motors.|$|R
25|$|Contrary to Japanese Shinyo motorboats, MT boats, though very {{dangerous}} {{to use in}} combat, were not designed as suicide weapons: The pilot, installed over the transom had a crude ejector seat and after bailing out, the seat acted as a miniature raft to keep the pilot {{out of the water}} and immune from the lethal shock of the underwater explosion. Another very innovative design was the Isotta-Fraschini Z-drive transmission system, featuring an inboard engine and <b>twin</b> <b>outboard</b> contra-rotating propellers.|$|R
50|$|The most {{successful}} early outboard motor, {{was created by}} Norwegian-American inventor Ole Evinrude in 1909. Between 1909 and 1912, Evinrude made thousands of his outboards and the three horse units were sold around the world. His Evinrude Outboard Co. was spun off to other owners, {{and he went on}} to success after starting the ELTO company to produce a two-cylinder motor - ELTO stood for Evinrude Light <b>Twin</b> <b>Outboard.</b> The 1920s were the first high-water mark for the outboard with Evinrude, Johnson, ELTO, Atwater Lockwood and dozens of other makers in the field.|$|R
5000|$|Marine 2 - 26 ft 2004 Zodiac Hurricane, 7.5 meter Rigid Hull Inflatable Boat {{powered by}} <b>twin</b> [...] <b>outboard</b> motors (2 Yamaha 150 hp {{four-stroke}} outboard engines, 380 litres) ...|$|R
5000|$|Because of Bessie's poor health, the Evinrudes {{sold their}} company in 1913, and Ole agreed to not {{re-enter}} the outboard motor business for five years. His inventive mind kept busy, however, and during his [...] "retirement", he devised a much-improved, two-cylinder outboard engine. In 1921 he and Bessie formed the ELTO Outboard Motor Company (ELTO standing for Evinrude's Light <b>Twin</b> <b>Outboard).</b> This new outboard engine {{was also very}} successful, and in 1929 the ELTO company merged with the original Evinrude company (since renamed the Outboard Marine Corporation) and the Lockwood Motor Company, with Evinrude the president of this new company.|$|R
50|$|In {{the mid-1970s}} a hull mould and tubes for 21-foot R-HIBs were sent from Atlantic College {{to their new}} sister school being {{established}} {{on the west coast}} of Canada, the Lester B. Pearson College of the Pacific, at Pedder Bay, British Columbia. Three graduates of the Atlantic College who were also trained as RNLI inshore lifeboat coxswains worked at the school during its inaugural year and coached some Pacific College students to build a pair of boats, designated X-27, propelled by <b>twin</b> <b>outboard</b> engines and X-28, propelled by inboard-outboard stern drive. These students were also trained by the graduates to operate these craft as safety boats in support of the college's coastal sailing and diving programs.|$|R
5000|$|The Mk III Manchester (serial number BT308) {{which first}} flew on 9 January 1941, was {{essentially}} the first Lancaster, featuring a longer wing fitted with four Rolls-Royce Merlins in new power-egg nacelles - originally developed by Rolls-Royce for the Merlin-powered Beaufighter II - although initially retaining the three fins and <b>twin</b> <b>outboard</b> rudders (the central fin had no movable control surface) of the Manchester I. BT308 received the [...] "Lancaster" [...] name immediately after its first flight. The second prototype Lancaster DG595 featured the twin, enlarged fins and rudders of the Manchester IA. Manchester production continued until November {{of that year}} but some aircraft that were still in production were instead completed as Lancasters.|$|R
5000|$|The Heather White's engine's were {{upgraded}} from twin [...] to <b>twin</b> [...] <b>outboards,</b> {{and are now}} continually replaced {{after three}} years of service. The Honda ATV quad bikes used are also replaced every three years before signs of corrosion from the harsh environment cause problems.|$|R
2500|$|The Suffolk Police Marine Bureau patrols the [...] of navigable {{waterways}} {{within the}} police district, from the Connecticut and Rhode Island state line which bisects the Long Island Sound, to the New York state line [...] south of Fire Island in the Atlantic Ocean. The Bureau is {{also responsible for}} patrol of the barrier beach communities of Fire Island, including EMS services in the eastern communities. The Bureau operates 27' and 31' <b>twin</b> <b>outboard</b> [...] SAFE Boats, which are also certified for patient transport, as well as 40' twin diesel Thomas Marine patrol boats, {{as well as a}} variety of other craft for special missions and flood water rescue. On the barrier beach, the Bureau operates four-wheel drive SUVs, pickups, ATVs and John Deere Gators for patrol and medical response.|$|R
50|$|By 1921, Evinrude {{was back}} in business, in a venture he called the ELTO Outboard Motor Company. His new {{offering}} was the Evinrude Light <b>Twin</b> <b>Outboard,</b> a motor partly made of aluminum, reducing its weight by a third. Popular with the fishing fleets, this revolutionary engine outstripped sales of Evinrude's original outboard motor within three years. It also {{attracted the attention of}} a competitor, Johnson Motor Company, which brought out its rival lightweight engine in 1922. Johnson gained market share, snatching the lead four years later with an updated model weighing a trim 100 pounds, costing a thrifty $190, and able to drive a boat at a zippy 16 miles per hour. Neither the Evinrude Company nor ELTO could match this. Now far ahead, Johnson produced a net profit of $433,000 in 1927, far outpacing Evinrude's $25,000 and ELTO's $30,000.|$|R
500|$|The {{main battery}} {{consisted}} of four 12-inch 45-caliber guns, {{meaning that the}} gun is 45 times {{as long as it}} is in diameter. [...] These were considered quick-firing guns and were arranged in two twin turrets, one forward and one to the rear of the main superstructure. The eight 8-inch 45-caliber guns were arranged in four <b>twin</b> turrets <b>outboard</b> of the main superstructure on each side of the ship.|$|R
5000|$|The C-class {{lifeboat}} used Zodiac Grand Raid Mark IV's {{powered by}} <b>twin</b> 40 hp <b>outboards</b> and was formerly {{operated by the}} Royal National Lifeboat Institution of the United Kingdom and Ireland. It {{was replaced by the}} [...] and [...]|$|R
5000|$|The 25 ft (8 m) Transportable Port Security Boat (TPSB): (AKA The Guardian) is a <b>twin</b> <b>outboard</b> motor, open deck, all weather, high performance, moderately-armed {{platform}} {{capable of}} operating in inner harbor/near shore environments in light sea conditions. It was first built in FY97 by Boston Whaler in Edgewater, Florida, for the US Coast Guard, Maintenance and Logistic Command. The 25 ft (8 m) TPSB is designed and configured to support Port Security Units as an inshore/harbor surface interdiction response asset {{in accordance with}} Required Operational Capabilities (ROC) and Projected Operational Environment (POE) for Coast Guard Port Security Units (PSU), COMDTINST 3501.49 (series). The basic design {{is based on the}} standard Boston Whaler 25 ft (8 m) Guardian hull, customized to functionally suit the TPSB mission requirements. The basic craft arrangements consist of a centrally positioned control console and leaning post with an open work deck and low non-obstructive gunwales. The TPSB is outfitted as a military gunboat with three (3) hardened weapon positions: (1) forward [...]50 caliber (12.7 mm) tri-pod, (2) gunwale - mounted 7.62 mm M240B Machine Gun pipe pedestals, port and starboard.|$|R
5000|$|The design {{length of}} the hull is 25 feet and the boat is officially {{referred}} to as such. However, the overall length with engines mounted is approximately 29 ft. Powered by <b>twin</b> [...] <b>outboard</b> motors, {{they are capable of}} speeds in excess of 46 kn and have a range of 150 to 175 nmi km, depending on the class. The boat requires a minimum crew of two persons, but has a carrying capacity for 10 persons. The boat is easily trailerable and can be transported by a C-130 Hercules aircraft or truck.|$|R
50|$|The Atlantic 75-class {{superseded}} the Atlantic 21-class. The name Atlantic {{is derived}} from Atlantic College in Wales, where the rigid inflatable B-class was first developed. The designation 75 {{is derived from}} its length of nearly 7.5 m. A significant improvement to this class over the 21 is {{the addition of a}} ballast tank installed {{at the front of the}} lifeboat which enables the craft to launch into larger surf than the previous class. The ballast when full, either of sea water or water from a hose, weighs the same as three fully grown men. The lifeboat has a crew of three and has a top speed of 32 kn and can operated in severe weather conditions up to winds of near gale force. The design incorporates <b>twin</b> <b>outboard</b> engines which are completely waterproofed, even if totally immersed. The hull of the lifeboat is constructed from Glass Reinforced plastic with a hypalon coated polyester which is highly resistant attack by marine organisms, chemicals and temperature extremes. The lifeboat had a displacement of 1.6 tonnes. Her equipment included two VHF radios, First Aid Kit & oxygen, GPS navigation system, night vision equipment, self-righting system, anchor and various warps, toolkit, towing system, illuminating and distress pyrotechnics, spotlight, torches. The rollbar assembly installed above the engines contains a self-righting bag which was operated by a member of the crew activating a gas bottle.|$|R
50|$|EnCon Police Officers utilize various sized {{patrol vessels}} to patrol Connecticut’s waters. A new 27’ Safe Boat patrol vessel, powered by <b>twin</b> 250 {{horsepower}} <b>outboard</b> motors, {{is equipped with}} a 360 degree infrared camera and provides EnCon Police Officers with all weather capability for enforcement and search & rescue missions on Long Island Sound.|$|R
40|$|Three {{station keeping}} {{controllers}} {{have been developed}} which work to minimize displacement of a small outboard-powered vessel from a desired location. Each of these three controllers has a common initial layer that uses fixed-gain feedback control to calculate the desired heading of the vessel. A second control layer uses a common fixed-gain feedback controller to calculate the net forward thrust, one of two algorithms for controlling engine angle (Fixed-Gain Proportional-integral-derivative (PID) or PID with Adaptively Augmented Gains), and one of two algorithms for differential throttle control (Fixed-Gain PID and PID with Adaptive Differential Throttle gains), which work together to eliminate heading error. The three selected controllers are evaluated using a numerical simulation of a 33 -foot center console vessel with <b>twin</b> <b>outboards</b> that is subject to wave, wind, and current disturbances. Each controller is tested {{for its ability to}} maintain position in the presence of three sets of environmental disturbances. These algorithms were tested with current velocity of 1. 5 m/s, significant wave height of 0. 5 m, and wind speeds of 2, 5, and 10 m/s. These values were chosen to model conditions a small vessel may experience in the Gulf Stream off of Fort Lauderdale. The Fixed-gain PID controller progressively got worse as wind speeds increased, while the controllers using adaptive methodologies showed consistent performance over all weather conditions and decreased heading error by as much as 20 %. Thus, enhanced robustness to environmental changes has been gained by using an adaptive algorithm...|$|R
50|$|Flying wings lack {{anywhere}} to attach an efficient vertical stabilizer or fin. Any fin must attach directly {{on to the}} rear part of the wing, giving a small moment arm from the aerodynamic center, which in turn means that the fin is inefficient and to be effective the fin area must be large. Such a large fin has weight and drag penalties, and can negate {{the advantages of the}} flying wing. The problem can be minimized by increasing the wing sweepback and placing <b>twin</b> fins <b>outboard</b> near the tips, as for example in a low-aspect-ratio delta wing, but many flying wings have gentler sweepback and consequently have, at best, marginal stability.|$|R
5000|$|The B-536 was {{launched}} from a supplied trolley which was towed from the boathouse by a tractor. The boat was 7.21 m {{in length and}} she had a beam of 2.49 m, and a draught of 0.81 m. She was powered through the water by <b>twin</b> 2-stroke <b>outboard</b> engines, of [...] each. Her equipment included two VHF radios, First Aid Kit & oxygen, GPS navigation system, night vision equipment, self-righting system, anchor and various warps, toolkit, towing system, illuminating and distress pyrotechnics, spotlight, torches. The rollbar assembly installed above the engines contains a self-righting bag which was operated {{by a member of the}} crew activating a gas bottle.|$|R
5000|$|She was a 6 m Carson rigid {{inflatable}} (RIB), originally {{powered by}} <b>twin</b> [...] Mariner <b>outboards,</b> but refitted in 1995 {{with a single}} [...] Suzuki and a [...] auxiliary engine. She had self-righting capability, integral fuel tanks and {{a top speed of}} around 30 knots. She was named the [...] "Geoff Clements" [...] after one of the young men who perished in the 1987 accidents.|$|R
50|$|The Rysachok is a {{conventionally}} {{laid out}} low wing, <b>twin</b> engine monoplane. <b>Outboard</b> {{of the engines}} the wings have constant chord and blunt wing tips; inboard, the chord increases toward the fuselage via sweep on the trailing edge. The starboard aileron carries a trim tab and the wing has two-section flaps. The tailplane, mounted {{at the top of}} the fuselage, has constant chord. The fin is straight edged and swept. All the tail surfaces have trim tabs and are horn balanced.|$|R
25|$|Pitch {{control is}} {{achieved}} by tilting the rotor fore and aft; roll control by tilting the rotor laterally (side to side). Three designs to affect the tilt of the rotor are a tilting hub (Cierva), swashplate (Air & Space 18A), or servo-flaps. A rudder provides yaw control. On pusher configuration autogyros, the rudder is typically placed in the propeller slipstream to maximize yaw control at low airspeed (but not always, {{as seen in the}} McCulloch J-2, with <b>twin</b> rudders placed <b>outboard</b> of the propeller arc).|$|R
50|$|The biplane {{featured}} a steel tube fuselage, and aluminum covered wings. The fuselage was fabric covered only to behind the cockpit, leaving {{the rest of}} the tail structure exposed, preventing dust buildup in the tail. The aircraft had <b>twin</b> rudders mounted <b>outboard</b> of the spray trail. Each of these were all-moving with anti-servo tabs. Standard automotive wheels and tires were employed to reduce cost as low-cost World War II surplus was becoming too old, and new aviation tires cost nearly five times as much.|$|R

5000|$|In 1995 a new Lifeboat {{was brought}} into service. The [...] "Bessie Worthington" [...] was a 6.6 m RIB {{manufactured}} by Delta Power Services in Stockport for the Southport Lifeboat’s requirements, meeting all the necessary specifications including SOLAS (The international organisation for Safety of Life at Sea). The boat was originally powered by <b>twin</b> 90HP Suzuki <b>outboard</b> engines. These were changed to 90HP Mariners in 1998. The [...] "Bessie Worthington" [...] had full self-righting capability activated by the crew after the unlikely event of capsize by pulling handles {{on the outside of}} the transom.

5000|$|Dock next {{turned to}} the {{question}} of outboard motors. In 1951, he orchestrated the first successful down-run of outboard motorboats through the entire Grand Canyon. The 1951 [...] "Marston Motorcade" [...] consisted of two outboard motorboats and three stock Chris-Craft Speedsters. The 18-foot aluminum hull outboard motorboat June Bug was piloted by Jimmy Jordan and the second boat of the same design, the Twin, was piloted by Rod Sanderson. The two outboards were powered by <b>twin</b> 25-horsepower Evinrude <b>outboard</b> motors. While the June Bug completed the cruise, not far below Separation Canyon, the gearshift on the motor of the Twin gave trouble,and the boat was taken in tow, much to the disgust of its crew.|$|R
