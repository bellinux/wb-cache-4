Zombi 2 has also been released under the titles Sanguella, The Island of <b>the</b> <b>Living</b> <b>Dead,</b> Zombie Flesh Eaters, Zombie, Zombie The Dead Walk Among Us, Gli Ultimi Zombi, Woodoo, L'Enfer de Zombies, Zombie 2: The Dead Are Among Us and Nightmare Island.|$|E
5|$|As {{a student}} at Carnegie Mellon University in 2004, Druckmann was tasked with {{creating}} a video game concept to present to film director George A. Romero, who would select a winner. Druckmann's idea was to merge the gameplay of Ico (2001) in a story set during a zombie apocalypse, like that of Romero's Night of <b>the</b> <b>Living</b> <b>Dead</b> (1968), with a lead character similar to John Hartigan from Sin City (1991–2000). The lead character, a police officer, would be tasked with protecting a young girl; however, due to the lead character's heart condition, players would often assume control of the young girl, reversing the roles. Though the idea did not win, Druckmann later developed it when creating the story of The Last of Us. An early idea for the game was that the infection only spread to women, though this was later deemed misogynistic.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, the growing {{practice}} of screening nonmainstream motion pictures as late shows, {{with the goal}} of building a cult film audience, brought the midnight movie concept home to the cinema, now in a countercultural setting—something like a drive-in movie for the hip. One of the first films adopted by the new circuit in 1971 was the three-year-old Night of <b>the</b> <b>Living</b> <b>Dead.</b> The midnight movie success of low-budget pictures made entirely outside the studio system, like John Waters' Pink Flamingos (1972), with its campy spin on exploitation, spurred the development of the independent film movement. The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975), an inexpensive film from 20th Century Fox that spoofed all manner of classic B picture clichés, became an unparalleled hit when it was relaunched as a late show feature the year after its initial, unprofitable release. Even as Rocky Horror generated its own subcultural phenomenon, it contributed to the mainstreaming of the theatrical midnight movie.|$|E

5|$|Filmmaker George A. Romero {{was brought}} in with {{a vision of a}} zombie-style horror movie similar to Night of <b>the</b> <b>Living</b> <b>Dead,</b> but which also relied heavily upon {{elements}} of tragic romance and ambivalence of identity. Romero completed a draft in October 1994, co-written with Ormsby and Sayles, that revolved around female archaeologist Helen Grover and her discovery in Abydos of the tomb of Imhotep, an Egyptian general who lived in the time of Ramesses II. Unfolding in a nameless American city in modern times, events are set into motion when Imhotep inadvertently awakens {{as a result of his}} preserved cadaver having been exposed to rays from an MRI scan in a high-tech forensic archaeology lab. The script then progresses to a fish-out-of-water story when Imhotep, having regained his youthful appearance, recognizes the need to adapt to a contemporary society that is three thousand years removed from the one he came from. Assuming at first that he is a representative from the Bureau of Antiquities, Helen finds herself drawn into a tentative relationship with Imhotep while also experiencing clairvoyant flashbacks to a previous life in Nineteenth Dynasty Egypt as a priestess of Isis. Summoning mystical powers through incantation, Imhotep later resurrects the mummy of Karis, a loyal slave whose body had been resting alongside his master's in the same tomb but is now held in the local museum. After escaping into the city sewer system, Karis embarks on a vengeful rampage against the various criminal fences and high society antiquarians who had acquired stolen relics from his tomb. Romero's script was considered too dark and violent by Jacks and the studio, who wanted a more accessible picture. Compounding the issue was the fact that Romero was unable to extricate from a contract for a different film project he had in negotiation at the time with MGM, and so his involvement with the film was severed and the development of an entirely new script was commissioned to other writers.|$|E

40|$|Guanabara Bay (GB), {{located at}} the coast of Rio de Janeiro State (Brazil), is an {{ecosystem}} rich in biodiversity {{both in terms of}} mega, macro and microfauna. However, the factors that control their distribution are still poorly understood. This work intends to identify the possible factors affecting the distribution of benthic foraminifera in the bay by comparing <b>living</b> and <b>dead</b> assemblages in selected sediment fractions. Substantial differences in terms of density, diversity and equitability of the species in <b>the</b> <b>living</b> and <b>dead</b> assemblages and in different sediment fractions (63 - 150 μm, 150 - 250 μm, 250 - 500 μm) are identified. Lower similarity (< 70 %) between <b>the</b> <b>living</b> and <b>dead</b> assemblages are associated with areas impacted by organic matter and may be mainly ascribed to either loss of tests due to dissolution, currents remobilization and abrasion, or inclusion of allochthonous species transported by currents. This work suggests that the use of <b>the</b> <b>living</b> plus <b>dead</b> assemblages or dead assemblages can reduce the accuracy of the results if the work intends to evaluate the environmental conditions...|$|R

25|$|Earlier script titles {{included}} Twilight of the Dead, Dead City, and Dead Reckoning (the same as {{the military}} vehicle used in the film).

It turned out that Fox sought to own the rights to the Night of <b>the</b> <b>Living</b> <b>Dead</b> franchise, and Romero decided not to do business with them. The film is the highest budgeted film in the series to date.|$|E
25|$|Horror movies also {{directly}} influenced deathrock artists. According to 45 Grave singer Dinah Cancer, Italian horror {{movies were}} a large influence on 45 Grave's visual style. Zombie movies influenced many deathrock artists, especially George A. Romero's Night of <b>the</b> <b>Living</b> <b>Dead</b> (1968) and its sequels. John Russo's Return of <b>the</b> <b>Living</b> <b>Dead</b> (1985) which featured Linnea Quigley and a mostly punk soundtrack influenced later deathrock bands. Horror-themed TV shows, such as The Addams Family, The Munsters, The Twilight Zone, Dark Shadows etc., also provided some visual influence, as did spookily-clad horror movie hosts on TV such as Vampira in Los Angeles, John Zacherle in Philadelphia and New York, Elvira in Los Angeles (then later nationally), and Ghoulardi in Cleveland.|$|E
