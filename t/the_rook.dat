25|$|As they show, {{except in}} the case , these {{properties}} uniquely characterize <b>the</b> <b>rook's</b> graph. That is, <b>the</b> <b>rook's</b> graphs are <b>the</b> only graphs obeying all of these properties.|$|R
50|$|The {{opposing}} name is {{used since}} if <b>the</b> Opposing <b>Rook</b> player's opponent is playing Static <b>Rook,</b> then <b>the</b> Opposing <b>Rook</b> player's rook {{will be on}} the same file as the opponent and <b>the</b> <b>rooks</b> will be facing or opposing each other.|$|R
5|$|The diagram {{shows an}} example checkmate position. The white king is {{threatened}} by the black queen; the square to which the king could move is also threatened; it cannot capture the queen, because it would then be in check by <b>the</b> <b>rook.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>rook</b> {{can move}} {{any number of}} squares along a rank or file, but cannot leap over other pieces. Along with the king, a rook is {{involved}} during the king's castling move.|$|E
5|$|According to the DTC metric, White should capture <b>the</b> <b>rook</b> {{because that}} leads {{immediately}} {{to a position}} which will certainly win (DTC = 1), {{but it will take}} two more moves actually to checkmate (DTM = 3). In contrast according to the DTM metric, White mates in two moves, so DTM = DTC = 2.|$|E

5|$|Western jackdaws inhabit wooded steppes, pastures, {{cultivated}} land, coastal cliffs, and towns. They thrive when forested {{areas are}} cleared and converted to fields and open areas. Habitats {{with a mix}} of large trees, buildings, and open ground are preferred; open fields are left to <b>the</b> <b>rook,</b> and more wooded areas to the Eurasian jay (Garrulus glandarius). Along with other corvids such as <b>the</b> <b>rook,</b> common raven (Corvus corax), and hooded crow (C. cornix), some western jackdaws spend the winter in urban parks; populations measured in three urban parks in Warsaw show increases from October to December, possibly due to western jackdaws migrating there from areas further north. The same data from Warsaw, collected from 1977 to 2003, showed that the wintering western jackdaw population had increased four-fold. The cause of the increase is unknown, but a {{reduction in the number of}} rooks may have benefited the species locally, or rooks overwintering in Belarus may have caused western jackdaws to relocate to Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>rook</b> is {{then used}} to support a piece attack against White's castled King. Black can easily get several pieces around the white king, notably a rook to h6, a queen to h4 and a knight on g4. The queen's arrival on the h4-square is {{facilitated}} {{by the absence of}} a white knight on the f3-square (that would otherwise cover the h4-square) and of a black knight on the f6-square (that would block the way for the black queen). If White tries to defend with h2–h3, this may allow the Bc8 to be sacrificed at h3 in order to open the h-file.|$|E
5|$|Flying {{insects that}} {{parasitise}} common starlings include the louse-fly Omithomya nigricornis and the saprophagous fly Camus hemapterus. The latter species breaks off the feathers of its host and {{lives on the}} fats produced by growing plumage. Larvae of the moth Hofmannophila pseudospretella are nest scavengers, which feed on animal material such as faeces or dead nestlings. Protozoan blood parasites of the genus Haemoproteus {{have been found in}} common starlings, but a better known pest is the brilliant scarlet nematode Syngamus trachea. This worm moves from the lungs to the trachea and may cause its host to suffocate. In Britain, <b>the</b> <b>rook</b> and the common starling are the most infested wild birds. Other recorded internal parasites include the spiny-headed worm Prosthorhynchus transverses.|$|E

5000|$|In <b>the</b> opening, <b>the</b> <b>rooks</b> are blocked in {{by other}} pieces and cannot {{immediately}} {{participate in the}} game; so it is usually desirable to connect one's <b>rooks</b> on <b>the</b> first [...] by clearing all pieces except <b>the</b> king and <b>rooks</b> from <b>the</b> first rank and then castling. In that position, <b>the</b> <b>rooks</b> support each other, and can more easily move to occupy and control the most favorable [...]|$|R
5|$|A {{scoring system}} to {{evaluate}} material {{is to add}} up the piece values of the material on the board. In chess, when a pawn equals one unit, a bishop or knight is worth three, a rook five and a queen nine. These values are {{a consequence of the}} difference in mobility of the pieces. In bughouse, piece values differ because pieces in reserve essentially have the same mobility as they can be dropped on any vacant square. The pawn relatively gains importance in bughouse chess, as its very limited mobility does not handicap reserve pawns. They can for instance be dropped to block non-contact checks. Pawns can be dropped onto the seventh rank, one step away from promotion, which again adds to their importance. Long-range pieces like the queen or <b>the</b> <b>rook</b> lose relative value, due to the constantly changing pawn structure. They {{are also more likely to}} be hemmed in. A valuation system, first suggested by FICS-player Gnejs, often applied to bughouse is pawn=1, bishop=knight=rook=2 and queen=4.|$|E
25|$|If <b>the</b> <b>rook</b> {{has three}} or more pawns the {{position}} is usually a draw but there are {{cases in which the}} queen wins and some in which <b>the</b> <b>rook</b> wins.|$|E
25|$|In castling, <b>the</b> <b>rook</b> {{moves the}} same {{distance}} {{as it does in}} chess. Thus, the king moves further; if it castles kingside, it ends on the second-rightmost file, and if it castles queenside, it ends on the third-leftmost file. On the 16×16 board, 0-0 leaves <b>the</b> <b>rook</b> on the n-file and the king on the o-file, and 0-0-0 leaves <b>the</b> <b>rook</b> on the d-file and the king on the c-file.|$|E

25|$|The chariot is {{sometimes}} known as <b>the</b> <b>rook</b> by English-speaking players, {{since it is}} like <b>the</b> <b>rook</b> in Western chess. Chinese players (and others) often call this piece a car, since that is one modern meaning of the character 車.|$|E
25|$|Capturing <b>the</b> <b>rook</b> {{results in}} stalemate.|$|E
25|$|Openings {{are also}} {{classified}} as Static Rook openings, where the offense {{is supported by}} <b>the</b> <b>rook</b> in its original position, and Ranging Rook openings, where <b>the</b> <b>rook</b> moves to the center or left of the board to support an attack there, typically {{with the idea of}} allowing the opponent to attack while arranging a better defense and aiming for a counterattack. However, as the most powerful piece on the board, <b>the</b> <b>rook</b> invites attack, and in most cases, especially for weaker players, {{it is a good idea}} to keep the king well away from <b>the</b> <b>rook.</b> Relatedly, the static vs ranging classification corresponds to castle development: static rook positions tend to have castles on the left side of the board while ranging rook positions tend to have castles on the right side.|$|E
5000|$|The {{pieces are}} placed on the players' first and second ranks, respectively, with <b>the</b> <b>rooks</b> alone on <b>the</b> players' first ranks.
