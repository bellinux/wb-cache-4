The Laws {{stipulate}} that the regulations on covering the pitch shall be agreed by both captains in advance. <b>The</b> <b>decision</b> <b>concerning</b> whether to cover the pitch greatly affects how the ball will react to the pitch surface, as a ball bounces differently on wet ground as compared to dry ground.

So reluctant was the governor to come to <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>concerning</b> the crew, that he even bent sails before a council was again convened. But there was no longer any good excuse for delay. Betts had long been back, and brought the report that the sandal-wood was being hauled to the coast in great quantities, both factions working with right good will. In another month the ship might be loaded and sail for America.|$|E

50|$|One {{advantage}} of MoUs over more formal instruments is that, because obligations {{under international law}} may be avoided, they can be put into effect in most countries without requiring parliamentary approval. Hence, MoUs are often used to modify and adapt existing treaties, in which case these MoUs have factual treaty status. <b>The</b> <b>decision</b> <b>concerning</b> ratification, however, {{is determined by the}} parties' internal law and depends to a large degree on the subject agreed upon. MoUs that are kept confidential (i.e., not registered with the UN) cannot be enforced before any UN organ, and it may be concluded that no obligations under international law have been created.

5000|$|Suicide is {{regarded}} generally within the Orthodox Tradition as {{a rejection of}} God's gift of physical life, a failure of stewardship, an act of despair, and a transgression of the sixth commandment, [...] "You shall not kill" [...] (Exodus 20:13).

However, factors bearing on the particular case may become known to the priest who must share this information with the diocesan bishop; the bishop will consider the factors and make <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>concerning</b> funeral services. The condemnation of suicide is reflected in the teachings of Clement of Alexandria, Lactantius, St. Augustine and others.

40|$|The article aims at {{presenting}} basic {{problems of}} decision-making independence of an enterprise arising {{in connection with}} the present (instituted in 1982) economic reform which opened new and hitherto unknown possibilities for an enterprise to shape independently its own activity at short and long range. The considerations are laid in a historical background, helping to accentuate innovatory and progressive conceptions of the reform and to expose the facts of retaining or rejecting some solutions introduced by previous reforms. The starting point has been provided by the thesis about limied decision-making independence of an enterprise as long as the national economy functions under the conditions of socialized basic means of production and the active role of the central plan. However, the above does not settle explicitly the question of the range and types of independence; the latter may be shapd in various ways. Accepting fully an extensive, and as broad as possible, independence of an enterprise in current and developmental matters, the author carried out the detailed analysis of three main decision-making spheres: 1) <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> <b>concerning</b> production and exploitation, 2) <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> <b>concerning</b> supplies and sales, 3) <b>the</b> <b>decisions</b> <b>concerning</b> property and income. The results of the analysis are to inform the management of new opportunities and prerogatives of its decision-making activity and of the problems to be autonomically overcome and solved by means of decision-making measures.

The division provided these men with their basic training as well as instruction in cavalry operations. The divisional training as a whole, however, would not be tested. Stating that there was no intrinsic need for a second cavalry division, the War Department had devised a plan to use the 2d Cavalry Division personnel to form needed service units. Black community leaders, reacting against the criticism of the performance of negroes in combat units, protested the possible conversion of the division. The debate over the capabilities of black units continued but <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>concerning</b> the status of the 2d Cavalry Division was already made. The War Department ordered the division to be shipped overseas where the conversion would take place. During January 1944 the 2d Cavalry Division was dismounted and shipped back east for deployment abroad. Arriving at Oran, North Africa, on 9 March 1944, the division was inactivated the next day.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the same}} time, Democrats {{characterized}} Republicans as lawless rebels, provoking disunion by their unwillingness {{to accept the}} Supreme Court's decision as {{the law of the}} land. Many Northern opponents of slavery offered a legalistic argument for refusing to recognize the Dred Scott decision as binding. As they noted, the Court's decision began with the proposition that the federal courts did not have jurisdiction to hear Scott's case because he was not a citizen of the State of Missouri. Therefore, so the opponents argued, the remainder of <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>concerning</b> the Missouri Compromise was unnecessary (i.e., beyond the Court's power to decide) and therefore a passing remark rather than an authoritative interpretation of the law (i.e., obiter dictum). Douglas attacked this position in the Lincoln-Douglas debates: Mr. Lincoln goes for a warfare upon the Supreme Court of the United States, because of their judicial decision in the Dred Scott case. I yield obedience to the decisions in that court — to the final determination of the highest judicial tribunal known to our constitution.|$|E

Eighteen days later, Judge Kollar-Kotelly ordered the justice department and Microsoft to [...] "engage in discussions seven days a week, 24 hours a day." [...] The judge cited the events of September 11, 2001, in her direction to begin settlement talks but did not explain the linkage between the two. Attorney General Ashcroft, however, denied that the events of September 11 had any effect on the outcome. Microsoft subsequently reached a settlement with the Department of Justice and some of the states which brought suit against it. Several class-action lawsuits filed after the conviction are still pending.|$|E

Partisans encircled the town in a tight ring and undertook the offensive. Over 1000 Italians held the town. The fights lasted three days. The commander of the garrison had demanded air support, but before the support arrived, partisans seized the town. The Italians lost several hundred soldiers and considerable quantities weapons and equipment. In the end of June the Italians started a punitive expedition against partisans in the region of Mallakastra - Tepelena. Two thousand partisans took up defensive positions on mountain passes. In the first clash the Italians were forced back. Yet they renewed the action on 14 July with tanks, artillery and aircraft. After four-days of fighting, the partisans suffering heavy losses, retreated to upward parts of the mountains. In general from May to July the Italians lost thousands and many were wounded.|$|E
5000|$|This, however, did {{not deter}} the Czechoslovak government, {{increasingly}} under communist influence, from pocketing the estate without any compensation to the owner. In {{view of the}} fact that there was no legal basis for expropriating Adolph Schwarzenberg, on July 10, 1947 the Czechoslovak parliament promulgated a special law, 143/1947, coll., later to be known as Lex Schwarzenberg to secure his business assets for the state without giving a reason or offering compensation. This law has proved to be highly controversial as it is a piece of arbitrary ad hominem [...] legislation. As such it contravenes the Czechoslovak Constitution of 1920, which was in force at the time, as well as the current Constitution of the Czech Republic. It also contravenes the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. By the time Lex Schwarzenberg came into effect, however, Czechoslovakia was well on its way to becoming a communist system: Klement Gottwald, who would become the country's Stalinist dictator, had been Prime Minister since 1946.
