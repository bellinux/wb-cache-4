5|$|As the day wears on, Michael becomes {{convinced}} <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to {{his office}} is a hate crime and an act of terrorism. Believing it to have been perpetrated by someone in the office, he begins to lose his faith in his employees, whom he considers his friends. Michael tries talking to his former boss Ed Truck (Ken Howard), who tells him {{that he does not}} need to have his employees be his friends. But his mood changes drastically when he finds out the prank was carried out by his obnoxious friend Todd Packer (David Koechner). Michael instantly finds the joke hilarious, and his faith in his friends is restored. At the end of the day, Jim is cheered up when he finds that all seven of his voicemail messages were left by Pam throughout the day. Jim is seen driving home, and Pam's voicemails act as a voice-over, closing out the episode.|$|E
5|$|Fowler {{began the}} 2001–02 season controversially, after being {{dropped by the}} then manager Gérard Houllier from the Liverpool squad for the 2001 Charity Shield match {{following}} a training ground confrontation with assistant manager Phil Thompson. He made an appearance in Liverpool's 3–2 European Super Cup victory over Bayern Munich, but starts were intermittent. In October 2001, he scored his first league hat-trick for three years, helping Liverpool beat Leicester City 4–1, but was dropped for the following league match. Though Fowler {{had been on a}} contract extension from 1999 (unlike Steve McManaman – who exercised his Bosman entitlement the very same year), Fowler was linked to Lazio, Arsenal and Leeds, and Liverpool's management as well as fans and the media constantly reported <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> with McManaman (regarded as a huge financial loss) would never be repeated and thus the club never rejected those bids without consideration. This meant that coupled with Fowler's relationship with Houllier, speculation over Fowler's future persisted for most of Houllier's tenure and became an issue that divided Liverpool fans. His last appearance for Liverpool was against Sunderland, in which he was substituted at half-time.|$|E
25|$|The {{massacre}} of the garrison in Drogheda, including some {{after they had}} surrendered and some who had sheltered in a church, was received with horror in Ireland and is used today {{as an example of}} Cromwell's extreme cruelty. Tom Reilly in Cromwell, an Honourable Enemy (Dingle 1999), argues <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> at Drogheda was not unusually severe by the standards of 17th century siege warfare. In Cromwell was Framed (2014), he claims that civilians were not targeted.|$|E

25|$|H. M. Robertson, in {{his book}} Aspects of Economic Individualism, argued against the {{historical}} and religious claims of Weber. Robertson points out that capitalism began to flourish not in Britain, but in 14th century Italy, a decidedly different epoch. Since this is true, then the rise of capitalism cannot be attributed to Adam Smith, the Protestant Reformation, etc. In fact, Robertson goes further, and states <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> in Britain was rather a retrogression from what was achieved in Italy centuries earlier.|$|E
25|$|On 21 November 2006, six imams were forcefully {{removed from}} a US Airways flight at Minneapolis St. Paul International Airport for {{security}} reasons. The event led to an outcry from Muslim organizations in America saying <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> showed the growing prejudice against Muslims in America. Investigations by the airline and police so far have reported that the airline and ground crews responded to security concerns properly in removing {{the men from the}} plane.

25|$|In 1987, {{seven years}} {{after the release of}} the motion picture, Simon Hawke {{produced}} a novelization of Friday the 13th. One of the few additions to the book was Mrs. Voorhees begging the Christy family to take her back after the loss of her son; they agreed. Another addition in the novel is more understanding in Mrs. Voorhees' actions. Hawke felt the character had attempted to move on when Jason died, but her psychosis got the best of her. When Steve Christy reopened the camp, Mrs. Voorhees saw it as a chance <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to her son could happen again. Her murders were against the counselors, because she saw them all as responsible for Jason's death.|$|E

25|$|During the trial, Taylor {{received}} {{a series of}} anonymous letters from a person claiming to be an officer who worked with Burge. The anonymous letters asserted <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to Wilson {{was part of a}} decades-old pattern of police torture, led by Burge, that victimized African-American detainees. These letters led Taylor and his colleagues to other alleged torture victims, but federal court trial Judge Brian Barnett Duff did not permit the jury to hear this evidence; he held Taylor and Haas in contempt of court. After eight weeks of trial, the jury was unable to reach a verdict. The case was retried later in the year. After a second trial that lasted eight weeks, an all-white jury found Burge not guilty, but the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the verdict, based on ?. Eventually Wilson was awarded more than $1 million in attorney's fees and $100,000 in damages; the $100,000 went to the estate of the officers who were killed in 1982.|$|E
25|$|As {{the story}} {{continues}} {{from the previous}} episode, Emma sees the woman across from her in the cell as the same woman who was arrested for helping Snow, and learns that they are both due to be executed immediately the next day. Using her tricks from the night Neal broke into the amusement park, Emma remembers {{she knows how to}} break a lock by using two spoons, and it works. Later on, Charming catches Snow in the rope trap, although the timeline of their introduction is thrown off, until Hook shows up to say that another woman (Emma) has his ring. Charming looks at Snow's fairy dust pendant while she tells him her backstory (another timeline that was thrown off), and comes {{up with a plan to}} break into Regina’s castle first, then rescue Emma and steal back the ring. Snow tells them to wait, which gives Hook and Charming time to talk about love. Moments later, Red Riding Hood shows up, revealing herself as a friend of Snow's, and who can get them into the castle. As they reach the place, Red, who transformed into a wolf, scares a guard into running away, but the escape plan goes awry when they run into Emma and her fellow inmate, prompting Hook to tell Emma that she deprived him of a dashing rescue. Seconds later, Snow and Regina prepare to face off, with Snow throwing her dark fairy dust, but Regina uses her magic to stop it in midair. Snow tries telling her <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to Daniel (when she told Cora) was a mistake, saying that she was only a child, but an unforgiving Regina talks about consequences and sets up a stake to burn her. Regina throws a fireball at the helpless Snow White, who appears to die. Her death causes Red to howl as a wolf and Emma to cry over her mother's death.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the first}} free {{practice}} crash between Nakajima and Jarvis, Davidson called for cars to {{be equipped with}} brighter flashing rain lights and <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> to his co-driver was [...] "every driver's worst nightmare". He suggested Formula One rain lights provided by McLaren Electronic Systems were brighter than those employed in the World Endurance Championship. Toyota's technical director Pascal Vasselon believed Nakajima's lack of reaction time along with the absence of flashing rain lights contributed to his injury. Christopher Reinke, Audi Sport's Le Mans Prototype manager, stated such a measure had been discussed but the issue was complex, while the Automobile Club de l'Ouest's (ACO) sporting manager, Vincent Beaumesnil, said he was unsure that brighter lights would have assisted Nakajima. In early June, the sport's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) and the ACO, required all Le Mans Prototype cars carry additional flashing rain lights {{at the rear of}} their cars from the 24 Hours of Le Mans onward after the FIA's Endurance Committee observed their usage under wet weather conditions and felt there was an improvement in visibility.|$|E
500|$|The Whistleblower premiered on September 13, 2010, at the Toronto International Film Festival, and Samuel Goldwyn Films {{distributed}} {{the film in}} theaters in the United States. The film was advertised as a fictionalization of events occurring during the late 1990s. Kondracki said that the facts are broadly accurate but some details were omitted for the film; for example, a three-week [...] "breaking-in" [...] period for trafficking victims was not shown. The film received mixed reviews. The performances by Weisz and her co-stars were praised, but the intense violence depicted in several scenes was debated by critics, with some calling it exploitative. Kondracki and Weisz responded <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> in Bosnia had been toned down for the film. The Whistleblower received several awards and nominations, including three nominations at the 2012 Genie Awards. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon hosted a screening of the film and promised action would be taken to prevent further instances of human trafficking. The Guardian reported that other UN officials attempted to downplay the events depicted and that initiatives against trafficking in Bosnia were aborted.|$|E

She denied <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>happened</b> in the finished novel was actually rape, referring to it as [...] "rape by engraved invitation". She said Dominique wanted and [...] "all but invited" [...] the act, citing, among other things, a passage where Dominique scratches a marble slab in her bedroom to invite Roark to repair it. A true rape, Rand said, would be [...] "a dreadful crime". Defenders of the novel have agreed with this interpretation. In an essay specifically explaining this scene, Andrew Bernstein wrote that although much [...] "confusion" [...] exists about it, the descriptions in the novel provide [...] "conclusive" [...] evidence of Dominique's strong attraction to Roark and her desire {{to have sex with}} him. Individualist feminist Wendy McElroy said that while Dominique is [...] "thoroughly taken," [...] there is nonetheless [...] "clear indication" [...] that Dominique both gave consent for and enjoyed the experience. Both Bernstein and McElroy saw the interpretations of feminists such as Brownmiller as based in a false understanding of sexuality.|$|E

[...] Lineberger commented that [...] ", Tessa gets a taste for how Duncan's life must feel when she faces the killer." [...] She hits Tanovsky with her car, telling MacLeod [...] "I thought ridding the world of evil would feel better than this." [...] Panzer comments that having Tessa stop the killer [...] "...was kind of an unusual idea , and this {{was the subject of a}} lot of meetings with [...] David Abramowitz, myself and the people from the various networks, domestic and foreign, who were involved."
