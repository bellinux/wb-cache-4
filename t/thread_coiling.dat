40|$|Thermal {{processing}} zone status when threading in heatproof, high-strength and titanium alloys {{is a major}} problem in the general theory of metal cutting. Under other equal conditions temperature in the {{processing zone}} of these materials is higher than in cutting of carbon structural steels, as they have high strength and ductility, low thermal conductivity, that makes difficult the working conditions of the taps, increases the area of the tool contact with the workpiece, deteriorates lubrication and cooling of the cutting area because of the increased tendency of heatresistant materials for the curing. This causes an increase in the work and force of friction and as a consequence the rise of cutting temperature. Research of temperature state of the <b>threaded</b> <b>coils</b> formation zone with combined countersink tool-tap {{is one of the major}} challenges facing the authors of this work. When performing the work was used factorial experiment. The temperature in the cutting zone of the thread was determined by a built-in chromel-aluminum thermocouple with thermoelectrode cross-sectional area 0, 23 mm 2. Experiments were carried out using the apparatus of mathematical statistics. Studies have shown that the greatest impact on the temperature state of the cutting area has a tensile strength of the material. Effect of cutting speed in the studied variation range is relatively less noticeable. The explanation for this is a special scheme of cutting of combined countersink tap which allows significantly improve conditions in the cutting zone. The proposed design of the tap allows to reduce the temperature in the area of tapping for 20 %.  </p...|$|R

Bacteriol. 89 : 1557 – 1569. 1965. —Several morphological forms characteristic of the poxvirus group were demonstrated for fowlpox virus with neutral phosphotungstic acid (PTA). Viral particles (purified from viral inclusion bodies) stained with uranyl acetate (UA) and shadowed with platinum were shown to have an external knobby surface not evident with PTA. The external coat of freshly purified viral particles seemed intact, but as the preparation aged, it appeared to unwind, resulting in twisted “rope-like” structures. This process was facilitated by use of 1 % trypsin, and three dense fibrils were identified with UA within the partially detached viral coat. Studies with alkaline PTA (pH 9) were interpreted as revealing a complex nucleoid, but solutions above this pH damaged the particles. The morphology of the nucleoid was better depicted in ultrathin sections of whole virus which, when stained with UA, revealed dense <b>coiled</b> <b>threads.</b> Treatment of virus with sodium lauryl sulfate exposed an underlying coat consisting of small subunits approximately 40 A in diameter. Of great interest was the demonstration that the detergent removed strands of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from the virus without destroying the contour of the particle. The origin of the strands was definitely the fine uranophilic, <b>coiled</b> <b>threads</b> of the nucleoid, which probably represent the DNA molecule(s). That the extracted material was largely DNA was proved by digestion with deoxyribonuclease and resistance to ribonuclease and trypsin.
