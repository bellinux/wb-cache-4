His descendant further said that Atherton and his wife were each about 15 years old when they were married.|$|E
5|$|By 1869 Calcraft's mother, Sarah, {{was living}} as a pauper in a workhouse at Hatfield Peverel near Chelmsford. Calcraft was ordered to pay 3shillings a week towards her upkeep, to which he objected, arguing that his brother and sister {{should be made to}} help, and that he had three {{children}} of his own to support, although <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>record</b> of his marriage.|$|E
5|$|Details of Bonnet's {{military}} service are unclear, {{but he held}} the rank of major in the Barbados militia. The rank was probably due to his land holdings, since deterring slave revolts was an important function of the militia. Bonnet's militia service coincided with the War of the Spanish Succession, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>record</b> that he {{took part in the}} fighting.|$|E

5|$|Details on Buffalo's {{early life}} are sparse. Although {{he appears to}} have been favored by British traders and {{decorated}} by British authorities, few Ojibwa from Lake Superior fought in either the American Revolution or the War of 1812. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>record</b> of Buffalo participating.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that cricket {{was introduced to the}} Americas and India before it had spread throughout the British Isles. For example, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>record</b> of cricket in Yorkshire, home of the English game's most successful club, until 1751. The earliest mentions of cricket in Ireland, Scotland and Wales occur even later in the 18th century.|$|E

5|$|Tiger was {{the sole}} battlecruiser {{authorised}} in the 1911–12 Naval Programme. According to naval historian Siegfried Breyer, a sister ship named Leopard was considered in the 1912–13 Programme and deferred until 1914 as a sixth member of the , but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>record</b> of any additional battlecruiser being provided for in any naval estimates before 1914.|$|E
5|$|After the Venice 1640–41 revival <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>record</b> {{of further}} {{performances}} of Il ritorno in Venice, or elsewhere, before {{the discovery of}} the music manuscript in the 19th century. The discovery of this manuscript in Vienna suggests that at some time the opera was staged there, or at least contemplated, perhaps before the Imperial court. The Monteverdi scholar Alan Curtis dates the manuscript's arrival in Vienna to 1675, during the reign of the Emperor LeopoldI who was a considerable patron of the arts, and opera in particular.|$|E
5|$|As is {{the case}} with many castles – {{especially}} of the 12th century – <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>record</b> of how much it cost to build Buckton Castle. However, based on comparison to Peveril Castle in Derbyshire, where construction of the keep in 11751177 cost £184 according to the Pipe Rolls, it is estimated that the work at Buckton would have cost around £100. This was close to the median annual income for a baron in 1200.|$|E

5|$|Author John Macklin {{includes}} an account in his 1965 book, Strange Destinies, of two green children {{who arrived in}} the Spanish village of Banjos in 1887. Many details of the story very closely resemble the accounts given of the Woolpit children, such as the name of Ricardo de Calno, the mayor of Banjos who befriends the two children, strikingly similar to Richard de Calne. It therefore seems that Macklin's story is an invention inspired by the green children of Woolpit, particularly as <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>record</b> of any Spanish village called Banjos.|$|E
5|$|Commissioned by Queen Victoria in 1858, Garrard & Co. made a set {{of three}} large bow {{brooches}} containing more than 506 diamonds. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>record</b> of Queen Victoria ever wearing them; Queen Alexandra, Queen Mary, the Queen Mother and Elizabeth were seen wearing them frequently. The brooches are often adjusted to contain a large pearl or emerald diamond drop. Queen Mary was pictured {{on more than one}} occasion with the smaller Cullinan diamonds as the drops.|$|E
5|$|For a {{landscape}} artist, it seems Ruisdael travelled relatively little: to Blaricum, Egmond aan Zee, and Rhenen in the 1640s, with Nicolaes Berchem to Bentheim and Steinfurt {{just across the}} border in Germany in 1650, and possibly with Hobbema across the German border again in 1661, via the Veluwe, Deventer and Ootmarsum. Despite Ruisdael's numerous Norwegian landscapes, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>record</b> of him having travelled to Scandinavia.|$|E

Matthew Cooper made a call sometime in July 2003 to Karl Rove but <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>no</b> <b>records</b> of the call.

5|$|It {{is unknown}} how {{effective}} the Caesar cipher {{was at the}} time, but {{it is likely to}} have been reasonably secure, not least because most of Caesar's enemies would have been illiterate and others would have assumed that the messages were written in an unknown foreign language. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>record</b> at that time of any techniques for the solution of simple substitution ciphers. The earliest surviving records date to the 9th century works of Al-Kindi in the Arab world with the discovery of frequency analysis.|$|E
5|$|Ruisdael's first Scandinavian views contain big firs, rugged mountains, large {{boulders}} and rushing torrents. Though convincingly realistic, {{they are based}} on previous art works, rather than on direct experience. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>record</b> that Ruisdael made any trip to Scandinavia, although fellow Haarlem painter van Everdingen had travelled there in 1644 and had popularised the subgenre. Ruisdael's work soon outstripped van Everdingen's finest efforts. In total Ruisdael produced more than 150 Scandinavian views featuring waterfalls, of which Waterfall in a Mountainous Landscape with a Ruined Castle, 1665–1670, is seen as his greatest by Slive.|$|E
5|$|She {{had three}} younger brothers. The eldest, Alfred, {{was born in}} 1883, was awarded a {{doctorate}} in chemistry from Erlangen in 1909, but died nine years later. Fritz Noether, born in 1884, is remembered for his academic accomplishments: after studying in Munich he made a reputation for himself in applied mathematics. The youngest, Gustav Robert, was born in 1889. Very {{little is known about}} his life; he suffered from chronic illness and died in 1928. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>record</b> of Noether ever marrying or having children.|$|E
