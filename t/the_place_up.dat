In 1938 Vaux purchased The Grotto and set upon a large refurbishment program. The buildings joined onto the caves were rebuilt to a high standard. A lift was also added to the surface.|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} {{recorded}} at the Warfield Theatre in San Francisco on December 7, 2001. War at the Warfield was Slayer's second DVD. Originally set for release on February 11, 2003, and later February 13, 2003, it was delayed several times, due to unspecified [...] "production issues". However, on May 20, 2003, {{it was announced}} that the release would be on June 17, 2003, only to be pushed back once again to July 27. Before the DVD's release, Tom Araya commented, [...] "I don't think it's different than any other Slayer show, you got your kids doing the mosh stuff. They get crazy, they tear <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>up.</b> And then you get the one kid that's tempted to jump off the balcony. Whether he does it or not is another story. When they do, of course they get hurt, but they always insist on staying so they can watch the rest of the show, then they go to the emergency room." [...] On July 25, 2003, four days before its release, MTV announced the DVD's contents.|$|E
2500|$|Rock {{and roll}} music {{first came to}} Carnegie Hall when Bill Haley & His Comets {{appeared}} in a variety benefit concert on May 6, 1955. Rock acts were not regularly booked at the Hall however, until February 12, 1964, when The Beatles performed two shows during their historic {{first trip to the}} United States. Promoter Sid Bernstein convinced Carnegie officials that allowing a Beatles concert at the venue [...] "would further international understanding" [...] between the United States and Great Britain. [...] "Led Zeppelin became the first hard rock act to play Carnegie Hall since the Rolling Stones tore <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>up</b> some five years ago." [...] Two concerts were performed October 17, 1969. Since then numerous rock, blues, jazz and country performers have appeared at the hall every season. Jethro Tull released the tapes recorded on its presentation in a 1970 Benefit concert, in the 2010 re-release of the Stand Up album. Ike & Tina Turner performed a concert April 1, 1971, which resulted in their album What You Hear is What You Get. The Beach Boys played concerts in 1971 and 1972, and two songs from the show appeared on their Endless Harmony Soundtrack. Chicago recorded its 4-LP box set Chicago at Carnegie Hall in 1971.|$|E

2500|$|A {{spokesperson}} for the National Abortion Federation, an association of abortion providers, noted that Gosnell had been rejected for membership following inspection, because his clinics did not meet appropriate standards of care, but that [...] "they’d cleaned <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>up</b> and hired an RN [...] for our visit. We only saw first-trimester procedures." [...] She adding that [...] "Unfortunately, some women don't know where to turn. You sometimes have substandard providers preying on low-income women who don't know {{that they do have}} other (safe) options." [...] A {{spokesperson for}} Planned Parenthood in Southeastern Pennsylvania, condemned Gosnell, saying, [...] "We would condemn any physician who does not follow the law or endangers anyone’s health... All women should have access to high-quality care when they are vulnerable and facing difficult decisions." [...] Dayle Steinberg, CEO of Planned Parenthood of Southeastern Pennsylvania, says she knew that Gosnell had provided abortions in Philadelphia for many years, but says she hadn't heard of any problems at his clinic until the allegations surfaced. She has been quoted as stating that [...] "when Gosnell was in practice, women would sometimes come to Planned Parenthood for services after first visiting Gosnell's West Philadelphia clinic, and would complain to staff about the conditions there. We would always encourage them to report it to the Department of Health." [...] She clarified that [...] "when Gosnell was arrested, I asked our staff if anyone had ever heard of him, and clinic staff members reported that a few women over the years said they were concerned about the uncleanliness of his facility and came to Planned Parenthood instead... if we had heard anything remotely like the conditions that have since come to light about Gosnell's facility, of course we would have alerted the state and other authorities".|$|E
