5|$|Stephen I granted {{privileges}} to the Roman Catholic Church, {{for example}} by ordering the general {{imposition of the}} tithe upon the population. Burials in most local pre-Christian cemeteries, for example at Hunedoara, only ceased around 1100. Stephen I also divided his kingdom, including the territories of modern Romania he had occupied, into counties, that is administrative units around royal fortresses, each administered by a royal official called count. In time the voivode, a higher royal official first attested in 1176, became the principal of all <b>the</b> <b>counts</b> in Transylvania. In contrast with Transylvania, <b>the</b> <b>counts</b> in modern Banat and Crişana remained {{in direct contact with}} the king who appointed and replaced them at will.|$|E
5|$|Bishop Lépes and his brother, the vice-voivode, {{started to}} {{assemble}} their troops near the peasants' camp. The absent voivode, Ladislaus Csáki, hurried to Transylvania. <b>The</b> <b>counts</b> of the Székelys, Michael Jakcs and Henry Tamási, also joined the united armies of the voivode and the bishop. The young noblemen {{who joined the}} campaign {{wanted to make a}} sudden assault on the peasants, but the bishop suggested that the peasants should be pacified through negotiations. The delay enabled the rioters to complete the fortification of their camp.|$|E
5|$|Bowes Castle {{was built}} within {{the ruins of}} the Roman fort of Lavatrae. The route {{was one of the few}} upland passes to link England and Scotland and had {{remained}} strategically important during the medieval period. The castle site lay within the Honour of Richmond, a grouping of lands traditionally owned by <b>the</b> <b>Counts</b> of Brittany during the early medieval period, but the land itself was a demesne estate, owned by the Crown.|$|E

50|$|Above the big wheel, <b>the</b> <b>count</b> {{wheel is}} mounted {{on the front of}} the clock outside the clock frame. <b>The</b> <b>count</b> wheel has 78 teeth on the outside, and the 12 notches are on the inside of <b>the</b> <b>count</b> wheel. <b>The</b> main arbor has an 8-tooth pinion which drives <b>the</b> <b>count</b> wheel. This {{directly}} reflects the ratio of strikes to lifting pins on the main wheel, as each turn of <b>the</b> <b>count</b> wheel has to produce 78 strikes (the total of numbers 1 through 12). One turn of <b>the</b> <b>count</b> wheel is equal to 9¾ turns of the big wheel.|$|R
5|$|Château de Chinon is {{a castle}} {{located on the}} bank of the Vienne river in Chinon, France. It was founded by Theobald I, Count of Blois. In the 11thcentury the castle became the {{property}} of <b>the</b> <b>counts</b> of Anjou. In 1156 Henry II of England, a member of the House of Anjou, took the castle from his brother Geoffrey after he had rebelled for a second time. Henry favoured the Château de Chinon as a residence: most of the standing structure can be attributed to his reign and he died there in 1189.|$|E
5|$|Conrad of Abenberg {{came from}} the family of <b>the</b> <b>Counts</b> of Abenberg-Frensdorf, and had many {{distinguished}} relatives in Germany. He was born around 1075, son of Count Wolfram I von Abenberg. His mother was probably the daughter of Heinrich I, viscount of Regensburg. Conrad had two older brothers, Otto and Wolfram. He was raised for a clerical career at the court of the Emperor Henry IV, {{where he was a}} member of the court chapel. He became a canon in Hildesheim.|$|E
5|$|Edward made {{alliances with}} the German king, <b>the</b> <b>Counts</b> of Flanders and Guelders, and the Burgundians, who would attack France from the north. The alliances proved volatile, however, and Edward was facing trouble {{at home at}} the time, both in Wales and Scotland. It was not until August 1297 that he {{was finally able to}} sail for Flanders, at which time his allies there had already {{suffered}} defeat. The support from Germany never materialised, and Edward was forced to seek peace. His marriage to Margaret in 1299 ended the war, but the whole affair had proven both costly and fruitless for the English.|$|E

In 1138, he granted permission for the castle to be built in , first mentioned in an 862 abbey charter. In the 12th to 15th centuries, however, the abbacy experienced a slow decline. In the 14th and 15th centuries, several Imperial edicts, initially issued by Emperor Charles IV, put the abbacy under the protection of <b>the</b> <b>counts</b> of Luxembourg.|$|E
5|$|In 1487, Sigismund {{arranged}} {{the marriage of}} Frederick's daughter Kunigunde to duke Albert IV of Bavaria against her father's will, and he also signed away some of his territories in Tyrol and Further Austria to Albert IV. Frederick intervened by force: he founded the Swabian League in 1488, an alliance of the Swabian cities, the Swabian knights of the League of St. George's Shield and <b>the</b> <b>counts</b> of Württemberg and Tyrol and Vorarlberg. With their help, he forced the Wittelsbach house to return the territories signed over by Sigismund.|$|E

5|$|Sutton Valence Castle was {{probably}} {{built in the}} second half of the 12th century by <b>the</b> <b>Counts</b> of Aumale, most likely by Baldwin of Bethune, but perhaps alternatively by William le Gros, Baldwin's father-in-law. The castle was built on a commanding position overlooking the strategic route between the towns of Maidstone, Rye and Old Winchelsea. and the location was originally known as Town Sutton. The stone keep of the castle was constructed around 1200.|$|E
5|$|The Carolingian reign saw {{periods of}} {{prosperity}} for the Champagne region beginning with Charlemagne's encouragement {{for the area}} to start planting vines and continuing with the coronation of his son Louis the Pious at Reims.

In 1314, the last Count of Champagne assumed the throne as King Louis X of France and the region became part of the Crown territories.|$|E

Baculus thinks to send Gretchen to change <b>the</b> <b>count's</b> mind, but then recalls <b>the</b> <b>count's</b> weakness for young women. The Baroness von Freimann, sister of <b>the</b> <b>count</b> and recently widowed, arrives disguised as a student to travel incognito. Her brother wants her to remarry with Baron Kronthal. The Baroness hears of Baculus' misfortune, and offers herself to plead his case in place of Gretchen. <b>The</b> <b>Count</b> then comes on the scene with his shooting party, as does Baron Kronthal.

5|$|A 2009 {{resource}} {{assessment of}} the Cumberland Island National Seashore by the National Parks Conservation Association (NPCA) estimated that there were approximately 200 feral horses on Cumberland Island. As of 2010, 121 horses were counted on the island during the yearly census. Censuses conducted between 2000 and 2010 have counted between 120 and 154 horses. Not all horses are counted during the census, and park management estimates that approximately 50 horses are missed in <b>the</b> <b>counts</b> each year, bringing the 2010 total to around 170 horses. The life span of horses on Cumberland Island is approximately half that of their ancestors, due to infestations of parasites and disease. They also suffer from digestive issues linked to the ingestion of {{a great amount of}} sand, which causes intestinal blockages and abdominal distension.|$|E
5|$|After Metternich's {{studies in}} Vienna, the Prince's death in September 1797 allowed Metternich to {{participate}} in the Congress of Rastatt. Initially his father took him as a secretary while ensuring that, when proceedings officially started in December 1797, he was named the representative of the Catholic Bench of the College of <b>the</b> <b>Counts</b> of Westphalia. A bored Metternich remained at Rastatt in this role until 1799 when the congress was finally wound down. During this period Eleonore had chosen to live with Metternich at Rastatt and gave birth to sons Francis (February 1798) and, shortly {{after the end of the}} Congress, Klemens (June 1799). Much to Metternich's anguish Klemens died after only a few days, and Francis soon contracted a lung infection from which he would never recover.|$|E

The third, fifth, and seventh counts charged that Burton had actually received compensation from Rialto. <b>The</b> <b>counts</b> different only {{in the interest of}} the United States which was alleged to have been involved in the matter.

5|$|Conrad {{seems to}} have been {{involved}} when Henry V revolted against his father in 1105. This would explain his election as Archbishop of Salzburg at the Diet of Mainz on 7 January 1106.

Conrad came to Salzburg accompanied by his brothers, <b>the</b> <b>counts</b> Otto and Wolfram, with an escort of 1,000 soldiers. Some of these soldiers may well have been servitors, servile rather than free vassals. With this display of force, he was able to force Berthold to abdicate.
