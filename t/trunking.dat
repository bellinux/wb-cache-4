[Purpose] To {{explore the}} {{differences}} in bilateral <b>trunk</b> muscle activation between chronic stroke pa-tients and healthy controls, this study investigated the symmetry index and cross-correlation of <b>trunk</b> muscles during <b>trunk</b> flexion and extension movements. This study also assessed {{the differences in}} <b>trunk</b> reposition error between groups and the association between <b>trunk</b> reposition error and bilateral <b>trunk</b> muscle activation. [Subjects and Methods] Fifteen stroke patients and 15 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects participated. Bilateral <b>trunk</b> muscle activations were collected by electromyography during <b>trunk</b> flexion and extension. <b>Trunk</b> reposition errors in <b>trunk</b> flexion and extension directions were recorded by a Qualisys motion capture system. [Results] Compared with the healthy controls, the stroke patients presented lower symmetrical muscle activation of the bilateral internal oblique and lower cross-correlation of abdominal muscles during <b>trunk</b> flexion, and lower symmetry index and cross-correlation of erector spinae in <b>trunk</b> extension. They also showed a larger <b>trunk</b> extension reposition error. A smaller <b>trunk</b> reposition error was associated with higher cross-correlation of bilateral <b>trunk</b> muscles during <b>trunk</b> movements in all subjects. [Conclusion] <b>Trunk</b> muscle function during symmetrical <b>trunk</b> movements and <b>trunk</b> reposition sense were impaired in the chronic stroke patients, and <b>trunk</b> position sense was associated with <b>trunk</b> muscle functions.

40|$|Although <b>trunk</b> muscle {{function}} {{has been}} suggested to be a determinant of judo performance, its contribution to high-level performance in this sport has been poorly studied. Therefore, several tests {{were used to assess}} the differences in <b>trunk</b> muscle function between 11 international and 14 national level judo practitioners (judokas). <b>Trunk</b> strength and endurance were assessed using isokinetic tests and core stability was assessed using two protocols: 1) sudden loading, to assess <b>trunk</b> responses to unexpected external perturbations; 2) stable and unstable sitting, to assess the participants' ability to control <b>trunk</b> balance. No differences between groups were found for <b>trunk</b> flexor isokinetic strength, <b>trunk</b> responses against lateral and posterior loading and <b>trunk</b> control while sitting. However, international level judokas showed significantly higher <b>trunk</b> extensor isokinetic strength (p < 0. 05) and lower <b>trunk</b> angular displacement after anterior <b>trunk</b> loading (p < 0. 05) than national level judokas.

500|$|A [...] "Saturation System" [...] or [...] "Saturation spread" [...] {{typically}} {{includes a}} living chamber, transfer chamber and submersible decompression chamber, which is {{commonly referred to}} in commercial diving and military diving as the diving bell, PTC (Personnel Transfer Capsule) or SDC (Submersible Decompression Chamber). The system can be permanently placed on a ship or ocean platform, but is more commonly capable of being moved from one vessel to another by crane. The entire system is managed from a control room (van), where depth, chamber atmosphere and other system parameters are monitored and controlled. The diving bell is the elevator or lift that transfers divers from the system to the work site. Typically, it is mated to the system utilizing a removable clamp and is separated from the system tankage bulkhead by a <b>trunking</b> space, a kind of tunnel, through which the divers transfer {{to and from the}} bell. At the completion of work or a mission, the saturation diving team is decompressed gradually back to atmospheric pressure by the slow venting of system pressure, at rates of about of 15 to 30msw (50 to 100fsw) per day, (schedules vary). Thus the process involves only one ascent, thereby mitigating the time-consuming and comparatively risky process of multiple decompressions normally associated with non-saturation ("bounce diving") operations. The chamber gas mixture is typically controlled to maintain a nominally constant partial pressure of oxygen of between 0.3 and 0.5 bar during most of the decompression (0.44 to 0.48bar on US Navy schedule), which is below the upper limit for long term exposure. NOAA has used rather different saturation decompression schedules for relatively shallow (less than 100fsw) air and nitrox saturation dives, which use oxygen breathing when pressure is reduced to less than 55fsw.|$|E
