5000|$|<b>Transfer</b> <b>to</b> monomer. Chain <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> monomer {{may take}} place in which the growing polymer chain abstracts an atom from unreacted monomer {{existing}} in the reaction medium. Because, by definition, polymerization reactions only {{take place in}} the presence of monomer, chain <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> monomer determines the theoretical maximum molecular weight that can be achieved by a given monomer. Chain <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> monomer is especially significant in cationic addition polymerization and ring-opening polymerization.|$|R

40|$|In this article, the {{objective}} is to focus on the likelihood that politicians will rely on intergovernmental <b>transfers</b> <b>to</b> pursue political ambition.

How are constraints (introduced to ensure that politicians rely on predetermined formulae which reduce the incentive <b>to</b> design <b>transfers</b> <b>to</b> win re-election) likely to influence “distributive politics?” Predictions in this article are tested with reference <b>to</b> intergovernmental <b>transfers</b> <b>to</b> 31 Mexican states between 2004 and 2012...|$|R

40|$|Chain <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> polymer is a {{significant}} process in the polymerization of acrylate-type monomers. 1 ?? 4 It is well accepted that intramolecular chain <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> polymer (socalled backbiting) is favored over intermolecular chain <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> polymer. It {{has been reported that}} chain <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> polymer occurs primarily via a 1, 5 -hydrogen shift (Scheme S 1, Supporting Information). 5 ?? 7 It {{is important to note that}} intramolecular chain <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> remote positions is also possible, though not favored. The result of chain <b>transfer</b> <b>to</b> polymer is an interesting situation in which two distinct transient radicals coexist in the system. The complexity and challenges posed by the coexistence of two distinct transient radicals in n-butyl acrylate (BA) polymerization becomes apparent in the kinetic description of its controlled radical polymerization. The prime focus of this Communication is to probe the kinetics of BA polymerization mediated by nitroxides, especially the implications on kinetics of the reversible deactivation of the tertiary mid-chain radicals (MCRs) ...|$|R
