A relevant implication of Taagepera’s equation for political practitioners of institutional design is that if the size of the assembly is rather stable and depends on the country's size, for a small country with a small assembly just a few parties can be sufficient to produce a change of electoral system in favor of proportional representation, while, for a large country and a large assembly, many parties would be necessary to produce such a result.|$|E

The Automobile Association of America reported that nearly every state along I-80 had reports of road work. In Iowa, though, there were two sections in 1988 which were particularly troublesome for travelers.

Now in Robinson Township, PA 60 becomes known as Steubenville Pike as it heads generally westward through a mountainous, lightly developed portion of the township. The amount of development around the route increases as it approaches Interstate 79 (I-79), which PA 60 meets at exit 60. At this point, the Yellow Belt joins PA 60 as the route heads generally westward through a narrow but extensive commercial and residential neighborhood developed around the highway. As the route enters the vicinity of I-376, US 22, and US 30, the valley widens and the homes and small commercial developments give way to larger establishments and stores.

Therefore, pests damage was influenced by pesticide application, and resulting one-way relationship between pest attack and pesticide application. After the economic threshold concept was introduced as pest control strategy, the relationship becomes <b>two-directions,</b> namely pest attack is affected by pesticide application, and vice versa. Therefore, the simple relationship does not reflect the real condition. The unbiased relationship can be overcame by econometric approach called two stage least square, including new relevant independent variables. The objective of this study is determining the reversible relationship between pest attack and pesticide application. For this purpose, the time series data-containing pest attack level and pesticide application on rice and soybean during 1990 – 1998 were required. The result of analysis in rice indicated that the irreplaceable phenomenon that is increasing pest attack caused by rising pesticide application, but in soybean indicated common condition that is pest attack reduced when pesticide application increase. On the other hand, both pesticides application on rice and soybean were influenced by pests attack condition. Higher pest attack causes increasing pesticides application.

40|$|Background: The integration, besides synergy and convergence, is {{regarded}} as a leading orientation in modern logistics. The connection of various participants within supply chains enables the integration of actions and allows to fulfill growing customers&# 39; demands in an effective and economically efficient way.   In times of a concept of the balanced development, growing interest in utilization of recycled material, connected with possibilities to consolidate  logistic activities, can be observed. According to the scientific literature (integration models) as well as practical business cases, supply chains of forward and backward type (two-directional) are the area of logistics of the intensive development.     	Material and methods: The paper presents the Authors&# 39; model and methodology of modeling of the integration of supply chains, which realizes the flows of forward and backward type (<b>two-directions).</b> The empirical material was obtained during modeling and simulation of processes in the environment of iGrafx Process 2013 for Six Sigma with the support of Minitab 17 (for planning of experiments).   The method of the verification of statistical hypotheses was used. As a first step, the correlation between the level of the integration and the global service level for the supply chain was conducted using the method of Pearson&# 39;s coefficient. The test of relevance of correlation coefficient was conducted by the use of t-distribution method. Then the verification of statistical hypotheses was made, based on the method using the Z-statistics. 	Results: The obtained results indicate clearly the strong relationship between the level of the integration of a supply chain and the obtained service level (values of Pearson&# 39;s correlation coefficient and results of t-test). The detailed statistical researches of authors indicate that the increased level of the integration leads to the increase of the average value of service level coefficient (results of Z-statistics). Concluded, the analyze of the service level indicator shows its growth together with the growth of the integration level. 	Conclusions: Based of integration aims, the integrated systems should have bigger possibility of activity. The possibility to obtain higher customer service level is one of postulated effects ("gains") of the integration of supply chains.   The results of Authors&# 39; researches confirmed such statement in quantitative way, and not only in a describing one. The conclusions from conducted researches encourage to integration activities within supply chains of forward and backward type...|$|R

In general, a full diffusion tensor analysis requires the acquisition of diffusion-weighted images (DWI) along at least six independent directions of diffusion-sensitizing gradients. Thus, DTI measurements of the rodent central nervous system are time consuming. In this study, diffusion indices derived using the <b>two-direction</b> DWI (parallel and perpendicular to axonal tracts) were compared with those obtained using six-direction DTI in a mouse model of SCI. It was hypothesized that the mouse spinal cord ventral-lateral white-matter (VLWM) tracts, T 8 –T 10 in this study, aligned with the main magnet axis (z) allowing the apparent diffusion coefficient parallel and perpendicular to the axis of the spine to be derived with diffusion-weighting gradients in the z and y axes of the magnet coordinate respectively. Compared with six-direction full tensor DTI, <b>two-direction</b> DWI provided comparable diffusion indices in mouse spinal cords.
