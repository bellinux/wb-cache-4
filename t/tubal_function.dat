40|$|Contents In the bitch, oocyte maturation, sperm storage, {{fertilization}} {{and early}} embryo development {{take place within}} the oviducts under high and increasing circulating progesterone concentrations. To investigate the potential effects of progesterone on the canine oviduct, nuclear progesterone receptors (PR) were localized. Oviducts were collected by ovariectomy from adult Beagle bitches during anestrus, after the onset of proestrus but prior to the Luteinizing Hormone (LH) peak (Pre-LH), after the LH peak but before ovulation (Pre-ov) and on Days 1, 4 and 7 after ovulation (n = 3 bitches per stage). The cellular distribution of PR was studied by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in the ampulla, isthmus and tubal part of the utero-tubal junction (UTJ). Plasma progesterone and 17 beta-oestradiol were assayed {{on the day of}} surgery. PR were specifically expressed in the nuclei of epithelial, stromal and muscular cells in the ampulla, isthmus and UTJ. The IHC scores did not vary from one oviductal region to another. However, the epithelium displayed higher scores than the stroma at anestrus, Pre-ov, Days 4 and 7, and also higher scores than muscle at Days 4 and 7 (p < 0. 05). Immunohistochemistry scores in the stroma and muscle decreased at Days 4 and 7 compared with previous stages (p < 0. 05). Furthermore, muscular IHC scores were positively correlated with circulating 17 beta-oestradiol concentrations and negatively correlated with circulating progesterone concentrations (p < 0. 05). In conclusion, PR were identified in the canine oviduct, with differences in expression between tissues and times around ovulation, suggesting that progesterone may regulate <b>tubal</b> <b>functions</b> and reproductive events in this species...|$|R

40|$|Background. To {{confirm the}} {{hypothesis}} that the incidence of pathological changes of the mucosa in the contralateral tube is higher in women with tubal pregnancy than in fertile women. To evaluate a new method for direct assessment of the tubal mucosa, salpingoscopy. Patients and methods. In the prospective study we enrolled 58 women in the period June 1998 –April 2001.  The study group consisted of 23 women with tubal pregnancy and 19 infertile women seeking diagnostic laparoscopy. The exclusion criteria was tubal pregnancy that occurred in spite of an inserted intrauterine device or after an in vitro fertilizationembryo transfer (IVF-ET). The control group consisted of 16 fertile women. Laparoscopy was performed in all the enrolled women. Peritubal adhesions were diagnosed laparoscopically, whereas intratubal adhesions were diagnosed by salpingoscopic examination of the ampullary tubal mucosa. Results. Laparoscopy revealed peritubal adhesions in 31 women: in 43 % of women with a history of ectopic pregnancy, in 94 % of infertile women, and in 19 % of fertile women. On salpingoscopy pathologic changes of the ampullary tubal mucosa were most frequent in infertile women (47. 7 %), less frequent in women with a history of ectopic pregnancy (26. 1 %), and the least frequent in fertile women (6. 3 %). Pearson correlation coefficient yielded a weak correlation between the extensiveness of laparoscopically assessed lesions and salpingoscopically assessed pathology. None of the 13 women with pathologic changes of the ampullary tubal mucosa conceived spontaneously, whereas 43. 5 % of women with healthy tubal mucosa on salpingoscopy conceived spontaneously. The women with diagnosed pathologic changes of the tubal mucosa were referred for IVF treatment to prevent further ectopic pregnancies. Conclusions. Salpingoscopy is a useful method in the evaluations <b>tubal</b> <b>functions.</b> Salpingoscopy is beneficial to the women with pathological changes of the tube: by referring them for IVF-ET further tubal pregnancies are avoided. The results of endoscopic tubal surgery can be further improved through a proper selection of patients by salpingoscopy. </p...|$|R

Acta Otolaryngol (Stockh) 1999; 119 : 809 – 815. Direct middle ear (ME) pressure measurements during 24 h and <b>tubal</b> <b>function</b> tests were performed on 11 subjects with the clinical diagnosis patulous Eustachian tube (PET). The pressure was recorded from the ME via a perforation in the tympanic membrane. The method used has previously been reported in a study on subjects with normal ME function and no symptoms of PET: a normal group. Results from <b>tubal</b> <b>function</b> tests correlated well with the clinical diagnosis of PET and the sniff test was positive in most subjects. Continuous ME pressure measurements during normal everyday and night-time activities showed no indications of pressure changes induced by sniffing. Subjects with the clinical diagnosis PET did not have a static state of an open ET. The ME pressure varied during the day and night, indicating that the function of the ET changed over time from a closed to an open state. Subjects with PET had a long-term pressure pattern significantly different from that of a normal group, a difference seen in the erect {{as well as in the}} recumbent position during the night. The subjects demonstrated a negative mean pressure level in the recumbent position during the night, whereas the normal group had a slight positive mean pressure. The difference was statistically significant. Many subjects demonstrated frequent slow rate negative pressure trends during normal day-time and night-time activities.

40|$|Objective: We {{evaluated}} {{whether or}} not persistent ectopic pregnancy (PEP) is a preventable complication after conservative laparoscopic surgery (salpingotomy) for tubal pregnancy. Methods: We reviewed the medical records of 139 patients who underwent salpingotomy between December 1992 and December 2008. Results: Out of 139 patients, 23 (16. 5 %) were diagnosed with a PEP after salpingotomy.

40|$|OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS:Although {{middle ear}} {{aeration}} is certainly related to eustachian tube (ET) function, other anatomic factors may {{play an important}} role in ventilation of these spaces, particularly the epitympanum. STUDY DESIGN:A prospective case series study group with retrospective case series comparison. METHODS:Eight patients affected by non-self-cleaning attic retraction pockets or attic cholesteatoma of the middle ear and normal <b>tubal</b> <b>function</b> (verified by type A tympanogram or Williams' test) underwent endoscopic surgery. Anatomic findings were noted and collected, with particular attention paid to middle ear folds. A control group was used for comparison. The prevalence of an isthmus blockage with a complete tensor fold in pathologic ears was compared between the study group and control group. RESULTS:The higher prevalence of an isthmus blockage associated with a complete tensor fold in the study group was found to be statistically significant (P =. 001). CONCLUSIONS:A selective epitympanic dysventilation syndrome is hypothesized; normal ET function seems to be insufficient for complete ventilation of the middle ear, and an open tympanic isthmus or an incomplete tensor fold may be necessary for epitympanic recess ventilation. The selective epitympanic dysventilation syndrome would consist of the contemporary presence of the following four conditions: attic retraction pocket or cholesteatoma, normal <b>tubal</b> <b>function</b> tests, complete epitympanic diaphragm, and isthmus blockage...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{assess the}} {{reliability}} of manometric eustachian tube function tests in children with ventilation tubes in situ. STUDY DESIGN: Repeated manometric eustachian tube function tests during one session. SETTING: The study took place at a secondary referral hospital and a tertiary referral hospital. PATIENTS: Ninety-nine children with ventilation tubes in situ because of persistent otitis media with effusion. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Opening pressure (Po), closing pressure (Pc), and <b>tubal</b> <b>function</b> group. RESULTS: Analysis of Po and Pc showed a decrease with repeated measurement (p = 0. 0001 and p = 0. 001, respectively). The effect of repeated measurement on Po was more pronounced than the effect on Pc. The results {{of the first and}} second pressure equilibration tests showed 99 % agreement. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed good reproducibility of the categorized results of the pressure equilibration test, whereas the results of the forced-response test seemed to be less reproducible and showed a downward shift with repeated measurement. A single measurement using wet swallowing and starting pressures of 100 and - 100 daPa and the mean of the first three measurements of the Po and Pc are sufficient to determine <b>tubal</b> <b>function.</b> Further studies are needed to determine the discriminative power of these tests in children with different degrees of middle ear disease...|$|E

40|$|Fallopian tubes {{from ten}} premenopausal women were {{collected}} and examined {{for the presence}} of inhibin, activin and its type IIA and IIB receptors (ActRIIA and ActRIIB) in the endosalpinx. Immunocytochemistry demonstrated clear staining for the bA, bB subunits and ActRIIA and ActRIIB that increased in intensity from the isthmus to the ampulla. No staining for the a subunit was observed. Whilst the staining of the bA subunit and ActRIIA was seen in almost every epithelial cell, staining for the bB subunit and ActRIIB was more variable. In situ hybridization and RT-PCR confirmed the presence of mRNA for the bA, bB subunits and ActRIIA and ActRIIB. These results indicated that the epithelium of the uterine tube is able to synthesize acti-vin but not inhibin and has receptors for activin.

30|$|A parietal {{enhancement}} of a dilated tube {{surrounded by a}} cystic mass may eventually indicate a tubal pregnancy. Ectopic pregnancy is {{the main cause of}} pregnancy-related death during the first trimester in the USA, with an occurrence of 1 : 150 births [75]. Approximately 95  % of ectopic pregnancies occur in the tubes, with the majority of cases located in the distal parts, particularly the ampulla. When ectopic pregnancy involves the intramural portion of the tube, the highest rate of morbidity and mortality is seen [76]. The other 5  % of cases occur in the ovaries, in a rudimentary horn of the bicornuate uterus, in broad ligaments, in peritoneum, and in the cervix [77]. This event can result from anatomical abnormalities of the tubes, such as constriction and false passage formation (diverticulum), or from tubal dysfunction such as altered contractility or abnormal ciliary activity. <b>Tubal</b> anatomy and <b>function</b> can both be altered by either tubal surgery or prior PID. The surgical procedures that predispose women to ectopic pregnancy include salpingolysis and ovariolysis, fimbrioplasty, neosalpingostomy, and tubal anastomosis.|$|R
40|$|Background: Asymptomatic female genital {{tuberculosis}} can impair <b>tubal</b> and endometrial <b>function</b> {{and later}} present as subfertility. A {{majority of the}} patients with genital tuberculosis in endemic regions present with subfertility and the delay in presentation, coupled with the potential the disease has in mimicking other gynecological conditions, renders it elusive. In addition {{to the challenge of}} diagnosing genital tuberculosis, fertility outcomes after treatment are not impressive. This is particularly so in the background of another confounding subfertility factor to which interventional efforts may initially be directed, at the expense of undiagnosed genital tuberculosis. We therefore present a case of subfertility due to endometrial tuberculosis, but confounded by other subfertility factors notably polycystic ovary syndrome. To {{the best of our knowledge}} this case report is the first of its kind in the literature. Case presentation: This is a case report of a 42 -year-old woman of African descent who presented to our fertility clinic with a 10 -year history of primary subfertility and amenorrhea of 6 years duration. She was a nurse in a medical ward and had no prior history of tuberculosis. She had undergone a diagnostic laparoscopy 8 years prior which demonstrated dense pelvic adhesions and an impression of tubal factor subfertility was made. At presentation, her gonadal hormone profile and pelvic ultrasound were consistent with polycystic ovary syndrome. A negative response to a progesterone challenge test prompted a hysteroscopic evaluation which revealed endometrial atrophy. Endometrial biopsies confirmed histological features consistent with tuberculosis. Normal endometrial function was not restored despite adequate treatment and her options were limited to surrogacy or adoption. Conclusions: Genital tuberculosis is elusive in presentation and clinicians should consider it in patients with amenorrhea and/or tubal disease from tuberculosis-endemic regions. Due to the attendant high cost of fertility treatment and associated poor fertility outcomes, it is prudent to explore options to diagnose it early. A routine endometrial biopsy in a patient with subfertility in a tuberculosis-endemic area would be pragmatic. An alternative algorithm in management would be risk stratification prior to endometrial biopsy...|$|R

40|$|In vitro {{fertilization}} embryo transfer (IVF-ET) {{is a well}} established infertility treatment caused by damage of the fallopian tube, {{which is one of}} the largest diagnostic categories in most IVF programs. This study evaluates factors of importance for the outcome of IVF-treatment: age, tubal damage grade, extent of recontructive surgery, endocrine ovarian function and endometrial development. In order to assess whether the women's age influences IVF treatment outcome, when Using a long GnRHa-hMG or a CC-hMG ovarian stimulation protocol, 200 women were investigated. One hundred under the age of 35 and 100 women 35 years of age and older (mean 31. 8 years and 36. 7 years respectively). Our findings were in accordance with others, showing woman's age as an important factor for treatment outcome. Using the long GnRHa-hMG protocol for ovarian stimulation in "older" women, seems to counteract the negative impact of advancea age. Increasing age is often correlated with high cancellation rate due to a poor response to ovarian stimulation, independently of the drug used. The post inflammatory tubal damage grade appears to be an other important factor for the outcome of IVF treatment. The grade of tubal damage and extent of surgery for the outcome of IVF treatment was evaluated in 53 women with <b>tubal</b> infertility. Ovarian <b>function</b> was assessed before IVF-treatment during two complete screening cycles. The first was a randomly selected natural cycle, and during the second cycle CC challenge test was performed. FSH on cycle day 3 and 10 and E 2 and P 4 AUC in the luteal phase of a CC stimulated cycle were used as hormonal predictors. When the Predictive value was calculated for these hormonal indicators, the highest was for E 2 AUC during the luteal phase. The relation between grade of tubal damage and pregnancy rate following IVF treatmcnt was evaluated in women who had not undergone tubal surgery. Indicators of low ovarian response were the number of ampoules needed, pre ovum retrieval E 2 levels, and the number of oocytes recovered. A gradual decline in number of pregnancies following IVF-treatment in relation to tubal damage grade was observed. When the success rate of IVF-treatment was compared between women who underwent surgery before IVF-treatment and those who did not, the pregnancy rate was higher in the latest group. Indications about the negative impact of tubal surgery on the outcome of IVF-treatment were found, at least in women with advanced tubal damage. None of the women who undcrwent extensive surgery with ovarian intervention became pregnant. Endometrial quality was evaluated in relation to ovarian function and the outcome of IVF treatment. Biopsies were obtained on cycle days LH+ 2 to LH+ 6 in women on the waiting list for IVF- treatment and in controls with proven fertility. An increased occurrence of retarded endometrial developmcnt was found in the women who did not become pregnant compared with the controls, suggesting that thc endometrial quality could have some importance for successful implantatiom Our study clearly indicates, that ovarian function is the most important factor for the outcome of IVF treatment. Factors influencing ovarian function such as age could be improved by using a GnRHa-hMG protocol in women 35 vears of age and older. In tubal infertility, a close relation was observed between higher grade of tubal damage and impaired ovarian hormonal function, both in women who underwent reconstructive sur~ery and those who were not operated before IVF- treatment. The morphological endometrial retardation observed in women who did not become pregnant following rVF-treatment suggests, that the endometrium could have a significant role for unsuccessful implantation, Other facts, such as the possible implantation in tubal mucosa or peritoneum, indicate that endometrial quality may be of less importance as compared to embryo quality. Basal FSH and CC challenge test followed by repeated measurements of E 2 and P 4 in the luteal phase, appear to be a promising prognostic test battery for the outcome of IVF trcatrment, which could be used for pre-treatment patient counselling.

40|$|In the {{reproductive}} {{life of the}} non-pregnant female, the Fallopian tube functions to nourish and transport the ovum towards the uterus in a precisely timed manner. These processes are facilitated by cyclical changes in the mucosa and musculature layers of the Fallopian tube during the ovarian cycle. The volume of tubal fluid in the Fallopian tube also varies during the ovarian cycle. However, {{there is very little}} information on any morphological changes in the tubal vasculature which may be associated with the above mentioned variations in the <b>tubal</b> structure and <b>function</b> during the ovarian cycle. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the morphology of tubal blood and lymph vessels in the different layers of the isthmus, ampulla and infundibulum, and to determine whether there were any cyclical changes occurring in the mucosa at the: (A) early/mid proliferative phase (B) late proliferative/ovulatory/early luteal phase and (C) mid/late luteal phase. For this purpose, the serosal, muscle and mucosal layers of the isthmus, ampulla and infundibulum were studied by light microscopy. In order to identify any possible cyclical changes in vascularity of the isthmus, ampulla and infundibulum, mucosal blood capillaries were counted in toluidine blue stained sections. Distinction between blood and lymph vessels was achieved using a blood vascular endothelial marker, CD 34. Furthermore, any possible cyclical alterations in the fine structure of ampullary mucosal blood capillaries were examined by transmission electron microscopy. The serosal layer consisted of large arterioles and veins. In the muscle layer, when detected, small blood vessels were present. Mucosa consisted of two types of folds, branched and unbranched. Both types were present in the ampulla and infundibulum (fimbriae), whereas the isthmus consisted mainly of shorter and thicker unbranched folds. Arrangement of the different types of blood vessels was different in these two types of mucosal folds. Branched folds in the ampulla and infundibulum (fimbriae) contained arterioles, blood capillaries and venules. Arterioles were confined to the core and base of the folds, whereas blood capillaries and venules were distributed in all parts of these folds. Unbranched folds from the ampulla and infundibulum contained blood capillaries and venules. Isthmic unbranched folds contained only blood capillaries. The epithelial cells/blood capillary ratio was lowest in all three groups of the infundibulum compared with the ampulla and isthmus, the lowest being in Group A (4 epithelial cells/blood capillary). However, in Group A, the isthmus had the highest epithelial cells/blood capillary ratio (56 epithelial cells/blood capillary) compared to Group B and Group C in the three regions. These observations suggest that the isthmic mucosal folds may be least vascular and the infundibular (fimbrial) mucosal folds the most vascular prior to ovulation. Significant variations in the epithelial cells/blood capillary/fold ratio within each region and group (P< 0. 00 1), suggests that each mucosal fold may be functioning separately from another fold within that cross section of Fallopian tube. Immunohistochemical staining using CD 34 gave variable results in different layers. All types of blood vessels were CD 34 positive except for serosal and muscle arterioles which were mostly CD 34 negative. In addition, mucosal stromal cells were CD 34 positive in some folds within the same patient, suggesting the selective expression of CD 34 in different folds. When detected, mucosal lymphatics had a central position in the folds in the three regions in both branched and unbranched folds. In branched folds, lymph capillaries were present not only in the central core but also in the side branches, suggesting a more extensive lymph vascular network in these folds. By transmission electron microscopy, ampullary mucosal blood capillaries were examined from the three groups of patients. An unexpected finding was the sparse number of ampullary subepithelial blood capillaries in both types of folds. Ultrastructural examination revealed morphological alterations in both continuous and fenestrated blood capillary wall. These modifications consisted of varying degrees in shape and thickness of the endothelial cytoplasm and nuclei and were observed in all three group of patients. Nuclei were thin and orientated circumferencially around the lumen, suggestive of blood capillary dilatation. In other blood capillaries, nuclei appeared to be thicker than the cytoplasm and bulged into the lumen. Pore- like structures were found only in fenestrated blood capillaries and were confined to the attentuated portion of the cytoplasm. The observations mentioned above, in the different regions of the Fallopian tubes, support the view that there are variations occurring in the blood vasculature and lymphatics in different folds in the three regions of the Fallopian tube during the ovarian cycle. Further studies are required to determine their physiological and clinical relevance...|$|R

In 4 volunteers with different middle ear conditions, a small perforation was made through the tympanic membrane. A rubber stopper containing a small polyethylene tube was fitted into the external ear canal. <b>Tubal</b> <b>function</b> tests were made to establish the equipment's ability to monitor fast pressure changes. The tests were well in accordance with other methods of direct pressure measurements. The equipment was carried by the volunteers for 24 h to monitor any slow or rapid dynamic pressure changes in the middle ear. Four continuous 24 -h measurements are presented. The method was found to be suitable for valid measurements of dynamic pressure changes in the middle ear during normal every-day activities. It may become a useful instrument in the search for {{a better understanding of the}} development of chronic middle ear disease...|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{compare the}} results of embryo {{transfer}} into the uterus (ET) performed on day 3 vs. tubal embryo transfer (TET) on day 2 in couples diagnosed with male factor infertility. Materials and MethodsWe collected data from 34 and 110 patients who underwent intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) followed by either TET on day 2 or ET on day 3 (January 2001 -June 2005), respectively. All couples were diagnosed with male factor infertility; there were no tubal or uterine factors, diminished ovarian reserve, pelvic adhesions, history of polycystic ovary syndrome or previous ovarian surgery. ResultsThe clinical pregnancy rates of day 2 TET and day 3 ET following ICSI were 64. 71 % and 57. 27 % (p > 0. 05), respectively. The corresponding implantation rates were 35. 47 % and 29. 58 % (p > 0. 05), respectively. ConclusionThe implantation and clinical pregnancy rates of ET on the 3 rd day following ICSI were similar to the rates obtained with TET 2 days after ICSI. Therefore, ET performed 3 days after ICSI {{should be the first}} choice for couples with male factor infertility, while day 2 TET remains a good alternative, especially for women with normal <b>tubal</b> <b>function</b> and known difficulties of transcervical ET...|$|E
40|$|Myomectomy or art: {{which comes}} first?: Fibroids {{of the uterus}} {{are among the most}} common benign pelvic tumors {{reaching}} an incidence of 25 - 40 % in women during their reproductive years. The rate is higher with advancing age. The prevalence of fibroids without any obvious cause of infertility is estimated to be between 1 and 2. 4 % (1, 2). However, modern sophisticated ultrasound equipment provides the means for more frequent diagnosis of fibroids of all shapes, sizes and in different locations, whether symptomatic, or asymptomatic. This fact adds to the basic dilemma of whether to excise an existing fibroid in an infertile patient despite the potential complications, or whether surgery should be avoided despite possible lower "take home baby rates". The relationship between uterine fibroids and infertility remains a controversial issue. The precise mechanism by which fibroids may cause infertility is unknown and includes: occlusion of fallopian tubes, alterations of <b>tubal</b> <b>function</b> and motility, alteration of cervical and vaginal pool of semen, dyspareunia, and thin, poorly vascularized endometrium (1). Only the latter can directly affect implantation and IVF results. Our knowledge of the effect of fibroids is based on several lines of evidence, none of which is well controlled. Many studies, some fro...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: For the {{evaluation}} of <b>tubal</b> <b>function,</b> Chlamydia antibody testing (CAT) has been introduced as a screening test. We compared six CAT screening strategies (five CAT tests and one combination of tests), {{with respect to their}} cost-effectiveness, by using IVF pregnancy rate as outcome measure. METHODS: A decision analytic model was developed based on a source population of 1715 subfertile women. The model incorporates hysterosalpingography (HSG), laparoscopy and IVF. To calculate IVF pregnancy rates, costs, effects, cost-effective-ness and incremental costs per effect of the six different CAT screening strategies were determined. RESULTS: pELISA Medac {{turned out to be the}} most cost-effective CAT screening strategy (e 15 075 per IVF pregnancy), followed by MIF Anilabsystems (e 15 108). A combination of tests (pELISA Medac and MIF Anilabsystems; e 15 127) did not improve the cost-effectiveness of the single strategies. Sensitivity analyses showed that the results are robust for changes in the baseline values of the model parameters. CONCLUSIONS: Only small differences were found between the screening strategies regarding the cost-effectiveness, although pELISA Medac was the most cost-effective strategy. Before introducing a particular CAT test into clinical practice, one should consider the effects and consequences of the entire screening strategy, instead of only the diagnostic accuracy of the test used.

40|$|Background. Hysterosalpingography (HSG) and {{diagnostic}} laparoscopy with chromopertubation are two {{widely used}} diagnosic methods to determine <b>tubal</b> <b>function</b> in infertile women. The diagnostic value of HSG and laparoscopy {{is still a}} matter for much debate. In the retrospective analyses we wanted to evaluate the HSG and laparoscopy as diagnostic and therapeutic procedure in the infertile patients. Materials and methods. Three hundreds and sixty two patients treated at University Department of Obstetry and Gynecology in Ljubljana because of infertility were analysed in the year 2000 and 2001.  Laparoscopy was done in all 362 patients and HSG before the laparoscopy was done in 185 patients. Results. The laparoscopy was done in 215 patients because of primary sterility and in 147 patients because of secondary sterility. The patology was found in 79 % of the patients (myomas in 8 %, polycystic ovaries (PCO) in 19 %, endometriosis in 27 %, tubo-ovarian adhesions in 46 %). Considering the tubal factor of infertility sensitivity of HSG was 68 %, specificity 52 %, PPV 55 % and NPV 64 %. Conclusions. Considering the results we found the laparoscopy as diagnostic and therapeutic method in infertile patients very useful and important and HSG {{as a method of}} limited value. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} {{for using the}} case-control design with only hospital separation records was explored {{in a study of}} ectopic pregnancy. The Saskatchewan Hospital Services Commission hospital morbidity database was used. Cases were women hospitalized for ectopic pregnancy in the years 1984 through 1986. Controls were women hospitalized for any other pregnancy condition. In a case-control study using pregnant controls, the odds ratio is an appropriate estimator of relative risk, conditional on conception. Among the potential risk factors (exposures) represented in the data were tubal surgery, prior ectopic pregnancy, pelvic inflammatory disease, and infertility. Of these, the first two are completely ascertained during the time a woman was resident in Saskatchewan. Under representation of exposures should be non-differential, leading to odds ratios which are biased towards the null. Multiple logistic regression analysis yielded estimates of the odds ratios for acute PID, chronic PID or pelvic adhesions, prior ectopic pregnancy, tubal sterilization, and tubal repair. Of particular interest was the association between ectopic pregnancy and tubal surgery performed in the hope of maintaining or restoring normal <b>tubal</b> <b>function.</b> The attributable risk proportion of ectopic pregnancy due to such surgery was 8. 1 %. This study design can be used to follow trends in surgical causes of ectopic pregnancy in Canada. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: A {{long lasting}} {{dysfunction}} of the Eustachian tube {{seems to be}} the etiologic origin for development of Chronic Otitis Media (COM) with a mesotympanic perforation, Otitis Media with Effusion (OME), as well as for chronic atelectasis of the middle ear. Surgical interventions in the middle ear generally treat the sequelae of the tube dysfunction but not the dysfunction itself. Material and Methods: This prospective clinical study investigates how far a fiber-guided laser ablation of the posterior half of the epipharyngeal tubal ostium leads to better middle ear ventilation in the otologic disease patterns mentioned below. 38 adult patients were included in the analysis. The patients in one group had a perforated tympanic membrane (COM before primary tympanoplasty (n= 14) or revision tympanoplasty (n= 5)), the patients in a second group had an intact eardrum (OME resistant to therapy (n= 3), with an atelectasis of the middle ear (n= 2) and patients with problems of pressure equalization with fast changes in ambient pressure (diving, flying) (n= 14)). A laser ablation of the posterior half of the epipharyngeal tubal ostium was performed, generally in local anesthesia, if <b>tubal</b> <b>function</b> testing was pathologic (Valsalva maneuver, passive tube opening, tympanogram). In patients with COM, the procedure was performed eight weeks before the middle ear surgery. All patients were checked 8 weeks postoperatively {{and in the course of}} the following year. Results: The intervention seemed to have a positive effect on the tube function in 68. 4 % of operated patients (p= 0. 001). In 26 of the 38 operated patients, an improvement of <b>tubal</b> <b>function</b> tests could be seen in the postoperative follow-up. In the COM group, the Valsalva maneuver improved in 14 of 19 patients (73. 6 %) (p= 0, 001), and the passive tube opening in 9 of 18 patients (50 %). In the group with an intact eardrum the Valsalva improved in 13 of 18 patients (72. 2 %) (p= 0. 001). The results remain stable after one year. None of the patients showed any complications as a result of the therapy. Conclusions: Minimally invasive shaping of the distal Eustachian tube under topical anesthesia can be recommended for patients with the above-mentioned diagnoses who have pathologic middle ear ventilation. Especially prior to tympanoplasties and especially in otologic revision procedures, where middle ear ventilation is a prerequisite for successful otologic surgery, the function of the Eustachian tube can be optimized in 70 % of the patients, particularly if there are pathological findings (tubal tonsil, narrow orifice of the tubal ostium, adenoids). The placement of permanent ear tubes in adults with recurrent OME can also be avoided by the described procedure. The results remained stable for the next year. Patients with tympanic ventilation problems due to rapid pressure changes (flying, diving) can also benefit from this procedure...|$|E
