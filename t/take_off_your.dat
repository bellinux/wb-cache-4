5|$|<b>Take</b> <b>Off</b> <b>Your</b> Pants and Jacket is {{the fourth}} studio album by American rock band Blink-182. Produced by Jerry Finn, the album was {{released}} on June 12, 2001, through MCA Records. The band {{had spent much of}} the previous year traveling and supporting their third album Enema of the State (1999), which launched the band's mainstream career. The title is a tongue-in-cheek pun on male masturbation ("take off your pants and jack it"). The cover art has icons for each member of the trio: an airplane ("take off"), a pair of pants, and a jacket. The album's first, limited pressing came in three separate discs reflecting each icon and containing separate bonus tracks and joke songs.|$|E
5|$|The album debuted {{at number}} {{three on the}} US Billboard 200 chart, with first-week sales of 313,000 copies. In comparison, <b>Take</b> <b>Off</b> <b>Your</b> Pants and Jacket debuted at number one and sold more than 350,000 copies in its first week. The album charted at number three, below fellow new album In the Zone by Britney Spears (number one) and above remix album Let It Be... Naked by The Beatles (number five). Blink-182 charted highest in Canada, where it debuted at number one. The album was also {{successful}} in other countries, debuting in the top ten in Australia and New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} over three months at Signature Sound in San Diego. During the sessions, MCA executives pressured the band {{to retain the}} sound that helped their previous album sell millions. As such, <b>Take</b> <b>Off</b> <b>Your</b> Pants and Jacket continues the pop punk sound that the group honed and made famous, albeit with a heavier tone inspired by groups such as Fugazi and Refused. Regarding lyrics, the album {{has been referred to}} as a concept album chronicling adolescence, with songs dedicated to first dates, fighting authority and teenage parties. Due to differing opinions on direction, the trio worked in opposition to one another for the first time, and the sessions sometimes became contentious.|$|E

5|$|California debuted {{at number}} one on the US Billboard 200, moving 186,000 {{equivalent}} album units; it sold 172,000 copies in its first week, with the remainder of its unit total reflecting the album's streaming activity and track sales. It marked the band's second number one album and first in over 15 years, when <b>Take</b> <b>Off</b> <b>Your</b> Pants and Jacket debuted at number one in 2001. It also knocked Drake's Views from the summit after having spent nine weeks at the top. The album became the band's first to top the charts in the United Kingdom, selling 24,000 copies in its debut week. The album also managed to reach higher chart positions worldwide than its predecessor Neighborhoods and outsold both its first-week and total sales in the US. As of December 2016, California has sold 408,000 units in the United States; making it the ninth best selling rock album of 2016. The album re-entered the Billboard 200 at number 17 in the week of the deluxe edition release.|$|E
5|$|Blink-182 {{consisted}} of guitarist Tom DeLonge, bassist Mark Hoppus and drummer Travis Barker, and by 2004 had {{been regarded as}} the most successful pop punk act of the time since the releases of Enema of the State (1999) and <b>Take</b> <b>Off</b> <b>Your</b> Pants and Jacket (2001). During its brief hiatus in 2002, DeLonge suffered a herniated disc in his back and collected several darker musical ideas he viewed unsuitable for the band; the ideas were used in supergroup Box Car Racer's self-titled album, recorded with assistance from Hazen Street guitarist and longtime friend David Kennedy. Box Car Racer {{was intended as a}} one-time experimental project but evolved into a full-fledged band involving Barker. The side project would cause personal conflicts between DeLonge and Hoppus, the latter was {{not a member of the}} supergroup and felt betrayed. The moody subject matter on Box Car Racer was incorporated into the sound of Blink-182, who explored experimentalist elements on their eponymous fifth studio album (2003). After the success of Box Car Racer, DeLonge declined a solo recording deal offered by Geffen Records because he believed it would cast negative light on Blink-182, but it loomed over the band in addition to growing internal tension.|$|E
5|$|By 2004, Blink-182, {{consisting}} of guitarist Tom DeLonge, bassist Mark Hoppus and drummer Travis Barker, had {{emerged as the}} biggest pop punk act of the era, releasing the seven-times-multiplatinum Enema of the State (1999) and number one album <b>Take</b> <b>Off</b> <b>Your</b> Pants and Jacket (2001). The band took a brief break in 2002 when DeLonge suffered a herniated disc in his back, during which time he collected several darker musical ideas he felt unsuitable for Blink-182, compiling them into a record, Box Car Racer. The album, recorded {{with the help of}} Hazen Street guitarist and longtime friend David Kennedy, was intended as a one-time experimental project but evolved into a full-fledged band with Barker behind the kit. The side project would cause great division between DeLonge and Hoppus, who was not included and felt betrayed. The moody subject matter and music on Box Car Racer edged its way into the Blink sound as well, and the band explored experimentalist elements on their next effort, an eponymous fifth studio album (2003). Geffen Records, after the success of Box Car Racer, offered DeLonge a solo recording deal, which he declined, feeling that it would cast a negative shadow over the band. Nevertheless, the possible deal loomed over the band, contributing to internal tension.|$|E

Blink-182 scored a number one album with 2001's <b>Take</b> <b>Off</b> <b>Your</b> Pants and Jacket. DeLonge experimented with post-hardcore music on Box Car Racer, which formed into a full-fledged band in 2002, but dissolved the following year. Blink's eponymous fifth studio album (2003) reflected {{a change in}} tone within the group, which broke up in 2005 following internal tension, spearheaded by DeLonge.|$|E

500|$|<b>Take</b> <b>Off</b> <b>Your</b> Pants and Jacket was {{released}} in June 2001, and the album debuted at {{number one on the}} US Billboard 200 chart, with first-week sales of 350,000 copies.

The album also debuted at number one on Canada's Canadian Albums Chart, and on Germany's Top 100 Albums. The album was the first album identified as punk rock to debut at number one in the United States. The record shipped enough units to be certified platinum, and was certified double platinum in May 2002. Shortly after the release of <b>Take</b> <b>Off</b> <b>Your</b> Pants and Jacket, the Federal Trade Commission's report charged MCA and Blink-182 with marketing explicit material to children. <b>Take</b> <b>Off</b> <b>Your</b> Pants and Jacket has sold over 14 million copies worldwide as of 2011.|$|E

500|$|In 2013, Hoppus {{referred}} to <b>Take</b> <b>Off</b> <b>Your</b> Pants and Jacket as the [...] "permanent {{record of a}} band in transition... our confused, contentious, brilliant, painful, cathartic leap into the unknown." ...|$|E

Blink-182 performed on the Late Show with David Letterman and Late Night with Conan O'Brien in support of <b>Take</b> <b>Off</b> <b>Your</b> Pants and Jacket. The band also appeared in a MADtv sketch, in which the trio stars as misfits in an all-American 1950s family (a parody Leave It to Beaver). The trio also sanctioned a band biography, Tales from Beneath Your Mom (2001), which was written by the trio and Anne Hoppus (sister of Mark Hoppus).|$|E
500|$|Evan Lucy of Alternative Press {{gave the}} album a mixed review, feeling [...] "some songs feel ripped from Fall Out Boy's Take This to Your Grave," [...] but praised songs which were less {{adherent}} to pop punk, namely [...] "Tigers and Sharks" [...] and [...] "Always Attract". AllMusic reviewer Jon O'Brien criticised the album's sound, describing {{it as an}} album which was more mature than a Busted record, but not as heavy as Fightstar's music. O'Brien stated that the band followed a [...] "well-worn formula" [...] of emo pop on <b>Take</b> <b>Off</b> <b>Your</b> Colours. However, another AllMusic reviewer, Jason Birchmeier, later regarded <b>Take</b> <b>Off</b> <b>Your</b> Colours as an [...] "impressive debut album" [...] which cemented the group [...] "as one of England's hottest up-and-coming rock bands". The Guardian described the band's sound to be [...] "the UK's answer to Fall Out Boy," [...] with reviewer Emma Johnston choosing [...] "Jealous Minds Think Alike" [...] as a highlight.|$|E

[...] "Kiss and Tell" [...] was released as a single on 7 September 2009, {{a week before the}} limited edition of <b>Take</b> <b>Off</b> <b>Your</b> Colours was released in the UK.

500|$|By November 2009, Franceschi {{described}} {{playing the}} material live as having [...] "become suffocated almost and we've really overplayed some of them".
