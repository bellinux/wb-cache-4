5|$|Michigan {{closed out}} the season by losing to Indiana (#2 AP/#2 Coaches) on March 10, failing its pursuit of defense of its conference co-championship. Michigan led by 5 with 52 seconds <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> <b>but</b> then missed 3 free throws, {{including}} the first attempt during 2 one-and-one situations. Burke and Morgan also missed last-second shots at the rim. Michigan wound down its regular season with its fifteenth sellout and five seniors on the roster: Eso Akunne, Josh Bartelstein, Blake McLimans, Corey Person, and Matt Vogrich. The loss kept Michigan from its first undefeated home season since the 1976–77 team.|$|E

5|$|The sixth day {{of racing}} {{was marred by}} poor weather. General {{classification}} contenders Pedro Delgado and Laurent Fignon lost time due to crashing on the descent of Monte Terminillo, while Greg LeMond lost over two minutes.

Gaston attacked again with a kilometer remaining, but was robbed of the stage win as Vladimir Poulnikov overtook him three meters before the finish.

5|$|Celski {{advanced}} to finals of the 1500m after winning 1st {{place in the}} heats, quarterfinals, and semifinals. During the finals, Celski was in the lead with about five laps <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> <b>but</b> {{in the last few}} laps, the three Korean skaters managed to overtake him, sweeping the podium with Kwak Yoon-Gy in 1st. Celski finished in 4th place, in front of teammate Travis Jayner, who came in 6th. The next day, Celski competed in the 500m. During the semifinals, Celski attempted a pass from fourth to third place, but during his pass, François-Louis Tremblay of Canada, in second place at the time, fell, tripping Celski on his way down. Celski finished the race in 3rd, but was then disqualified, while Tremblay advanced. In the 1000m, Celski finished third behind Lee Ho-Suk and Kwak Yoon-Gy with a time of 1:27.515. In the 3000m, Celski again placed third behind Lee Ho-Suk and Kwak Yoon-Gy. Celski finished fourth overall with 39 points. Celski then combined with Jordan Malone, Travis Jayner, and Simon Cho in the 5000m relay to finish second behind South Korea with a time of 6:46.205.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} 1987–1988 season, Rodman steadily improved his stats, averaging 11.6points and 8.7rebounds and starting in 32 of 82 regular season games. The Pistons fought {{their way into}} the 1988 NBA Finals, and took a 3–2 lead, but lost in seven games against the Los Angeles Lakers. In Game Six, the Pistons were down by one point with eight seconds to go; Dumars missed a shot, and Rodman just fell short of an offensive rebound and a putback which could have won the title. In Game Seven, L.A. led by 15points in the fourth quarter, but Rodman's defense helped cut down the lead to six with 3:52minutes to go and to two with one minute <b>to</b> <b>go.</b> <b>But</b> then, he fouled Magic Johnson, who hit a free throw, missed an ill-advised shot with 39seconds to go, and the Pistons never recovered. In that year, he and his girlfriend Annie had a daughter they named Alexis.|$|E
5|$|Jadzia confides in Major Kira Nerys (Nana Visitor) {{that she}} feels obligated to pursue Curzon's oath, but Kira warns her about what killing someone will do to her. Kang, likewise, tells Jadzia {{that she is not}} bound by Curzon's oath, but she insists on joining their quest. Kor, as buoyant as ever, is delighted to have her along. Koloth is dismissive, until she shows him her skills with a Klingon bat'leth. Kang refuses to accept her, until she shames him with his own devotion to Klingon honor, and insists that she have the chance to avenge her godson. Before Jadzia can request a leave of absence, Commander Benjamin Sisko (Avery Brooks) confronts her in her quarters, refusing her request before she can make it. Jadzia tells him that she is going and begs him not to make her disobey a direct order. He does not give her {{permission}} <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>but</b> does not stop her either.|$|E

5|$|The Australians seized {{their good}} fortune and set their fastest time to date with 11.0seconds (s). Having been beaten twice after leading out, the Australians sat back before {{sweeping}} past the Germans and Americans {{in the final}} lap. Australia were again drawn against South Africa in their quarter-final, who had defeated them easily in the heats. This time they equalled the fastest team in the competition over the final 200m, clocking 10.8s to progress to the final, where they faced the Italy. Giuseppe Ogna and Cesare Pinarello {{appeared to be in}} control {{at the start of the}} final lap. They had moved alongside the Australians with one and a half laps <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> <b>but</b> the Australians surprised them at the start of the final lap. The Italians came back to pull level at the start of the back straight, but the Australians held them off and pulled away to win by a length and a half. The Italians lodged a protest for interference but it was dismissed. The Australians finished in a time of 10.8s and Browne later claimed that he was convinced by the performance that they would win the gold medal.|$|E
5|$|The Mahabharata also records an {{encounter}} between the sage Uttanka and Kalmashapada. After serving his guru Gautama {{for a hundred}} years, Uttanka is allowed <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> <b>but</b> must provide Gautama with Gurudakshina, a traditional repayment for his teacher's services. Gautama's wife Ahalya suggests that he bring her the divine earrings of Madayanti, Kalmashapada's wife, as repayment. Uttanka meets the cannibalistic Kalmashapada, who approaches Uttanka to eat him, but Uttanka stops him and explains that he is duty-bound to get Madayanti's earrings as gurudakshina and that he, Uttanka, will return to Kalmashapada after fulfilling his obligation. Kalmashapada agrees and directs him to his wife, who refuses to part with her earrings until Uttanka brings some token from Kalmashapada as proof of his consent. Upon returning from Kalmashapada with a token, Madayanti gives him the earrings.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} quarter, the Australian defence {{remained}} strong, but their shooting did not improve. For the entire game, Crispin made only 3 out of 10 attempts, and Merritt just 4 out of 16. Nott, {{who played the}} entire game, ended up being the team's most accurate player, with {{four out of five}} attempts. Meanwhile, Team USA fought back to 40–39. Three timeouts were taken in the last minute. The game went down to the last seconds. Trailing 40-37 with less than 30 seconds to play, America's Desi Miller scored to have the USA trail by a point. Deliberately fouling Merrit put Miller out of the game, and sent Merritt to the free-throw line. It was a risk, but it paid off; Merritt missed both shots. The second was rebounded by Team USA's Rebecca Murray, who took the ball down the court, {{in the face of the}} Gliders' relentless defence. The ball was passed to Rose Hollermann, at 16 the youngest of Team USA's players. Spectators saw Hollermann's shot from the paint hit the ring with a second <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> <b>but</b> the shot clock was not reset. Team USA's Alana Nichols rebounded, and put the ball in the bucket, but not before time ran out and a shot clock violation was called. This left Australia with possession. In another 1.9 seconds, it was all over, and Australia had a controversial one-point win.|$|E

5|$|Margarito, {{traditionally}} {{a sluggish}} starter, anticipated to emerge swift, {{but it was}} Cotto who {{got off to a}} more effective start by throwing numerous punches and applying plenty of movement. Cotto picked up where he left off in the second round, approaching directly at Margarito though easily getting by harm's way once Margarito sought to counterpunch. That, nevertheless, changed approximately a minute into the round, as Margarito landed a right hand that momentarily had Cotto by the ropes. Margarito directed his assault to Cotto's body, but Cotto landed various left hooks. Blood started descending from Cotto's nose, but did not discourage him from closing the round by landing a punch upon Margarito. Mobility represented the key for Cotto in the third round, efficaciously blending boxing and brawling while trying to minimize the blood flow from his nose and a small cut over his left eye. Margarito continued targeting the body, but drew two distinguish warnings for low blows in the span of less than a minute. Margarito closed the gap sufficiency in the fourth round by landing a right uppercut and attacking Cotto's body to slow him down. In the fifth round, Cotto provided plenty of lateral movement which frustrated Margarito. Cotto persisted on the move and would land a flurry of punches prior to directly escaping harm's way. Margarito landed a straight right hand that had Cotto temporarily unsteady with ten seconds <b>to</b> <b>go,</b> <b>but</b> Cotto eluded all of the ensuing punches until the final bell.|$|E
