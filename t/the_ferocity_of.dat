5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>ferocity</b> <b>of</b> {{the night}} fighting, the High Seas Fleet punched through the British {{destroyer}} forces and reached Horns Reef by 04:00 on 1June. The German fleet reached Wilhelmshaven {{a few hours}} later, where Posen and several other battleships from the I Battle Squadron took up defensive positions in the outer roadstead. Over {{the course of the}} battle, the ship had fired fifty-three 28cm shells, sixty-four 15cm rounds, and thirty-two 8.8cm shells. The ship and her crew emerged from the battle completely unscathed by enemy fire.|$|E
5|$|As the day progressed, the 2nd Battalion, 192nd Panzergrenadier Regiment counterattacked in the Bénouville area in {{an attempt}} to get through to the bridges. The coup-de-main force and the 7th Parachute Battalion held their position, {{knocking}} out 13 of the 17 tanks trying to get through. The British troops moved forward into Bénouville and cleared the Germans in house to house fighting. By midday, most of the missing men from the 7th Parachute Battalion had arrived at the bridges. Despite <b>the</b> <b>ferocity</b> <b>of</b> the attacks, the battalion and the coup-de-main force were able to hold the bridges until 19:00, when the leading elements of the British 3rd Infantry Division arrived and began to relieve the airborne troops, a process that was completed around 01:00 7 June.|$|E

5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>ferocity</b> <b>of</b> {{the night}} fighting, the High Seas Fleet punched through the British {{destroyer}} forces and reached Horns Reef by 04:00 on 1June. The German fleet reached Wilhelmshaven {{a few hours}} later, where Rheinland refueled and re-armed. Meanwhile, her three sisters stood out in the roadstead in defensive positions. Over {{the course of the}} battle, the ship had fired thirty-five 28cm (11in) shells and twenty-six 15cm (5.9in) rounds. The two hits from Black Prince had killed 10 men and wounded 20. Repair work followed immediately in Wilhelmshaven and was completed by 10 June.|$|E
5|$|Given <b>the</b> <b>ferocity</b> <b>of</b> the Russian defense, {{everyone}} {{was aware that}} {{such a move would}} cost the lives of thousands of Guardsmen, but it was thought that the presence of this prestigious unit would bolster the morale of the entire army for a final decisive push. A notable exception was Marshal Bessières, commander of the Guard cavalry, {{who was one of the}} very few senior generals to strongly advise against the intervention of the Guard. As the general staff were discussing the matter, general Rapp, a senior aide-de-camp to the Emperor, was being brought from the field of battle, having been wounded in action.|$|E
5|$|The fire {{may have}} been caused by the {{accidental}} ignition of polyurethane foam insulation used on the building's outer walls. In China, the foam is commonly used as insulation material without the addition of flame retardants, and the foam produces toxic gases and carbon monoxide when burned. The Beijing Television Cultural Center was said to have used polyurethane insulation, which magnified <b>the</b> <b>ferocity</b> <b>of</b> a 2009 fire that consumed the center. In a 24 November press conference, local authorities said that the two apartments next to the destroyed building would be renovated as well, and that foam cladding on their exteriors would be switched out in favor of fire-resistant materials. Chinese citizens have also questioned the lack of an indoor fire sprinkler system in high rise buildings.|$|E

5|$|At around 6:50 am on 5 April, the Viet Cong 5th Division {{moved across}} the Cambodian border to stage the main attack on Lộc Ninh. The Viet Cong assault opened with a heavy barrage of artillery, rocket and mortar fire {{targeting}} {{the headquarters of the}} ARVN 9th Infantry Regiment and the Lộc Ninh district compound. The Viet Cong simultaneously mounted other attacks throughout the ARVN 5th Infantry Division's areas of operations in Lai Khê and Quần Lợi. There was also indirect fire on South Vietnamese positions in Phước Long Province, mainly targeting Phước Vinh, Sông Bé, and Bo Duc. Following the artillery barrage, Viet Cong infantry, supported by about 25 tanks, attacked Lộc Ninh from the west. In the initial assault, they tried to overrun the South Vietnamese regimental compound located {{at the south end of}} the airstrip. Despite <b>the</b> <b>ferocity</b> <b>of</b> the onslaught, South Vietnamese soldiers held their ground and fought desperately to hold the enemy at bay; South Vietnamese artillerymen lowered the muzzles of their 105mm howitzers and fired directly at enemy infantry formations moving through the rubber trees.|$|E
5|$|The commotion {{caused by}} the stoor worm's writhing agonies draws a crowd to the beach, and Assipattle lands safely among them. <b>The</b> <b>ferocity</b> <b>of</b> the fire burning in the creature's liver increases, causing smoke clouds to be {{expelled}} from its mouth and nostrils, turning the skies black. The islanders, believing {{that the world is}} about to end, clamber up a hillside to watch the final death throes of the creature at a safe distance from the resulting tidal waves and earthquakes. As it dies, the creature's teeth fall out to become the islands of Orkney, Shetland and the Faroes. The Baltic Sea is created where its tongue falls out, and when the creature finally curls up into a tight knot and dies, its body becomes Iceland. True to his word, once the skies clear and the earth settles, the king relinquishes his kingdom to Assipattle, who marries Princess Gem-de-lovely. As promised, the king also gives Odin's magic sword to Assipattle.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ferocity</b> <b>of</b> {{the fight}} {{convinced}} Black Hawk that Apple River Fort {{was impossible to}} defeat. He considered burning the fort, but feared the rising smoke would alert other militia in the area. His war-party slackened their fire as their fellow braves raided cabins near the fort. Taken were meat, flour, clothing, cooking utensils. Left behind was a paucity of real vandalism. Braves then raided the livestock: horses were run off and pigs and cattle were shot down and the choicest cut of meat taken. In the gathering darkness, Black Hawk quietly withdrew his war party and retreated back to the gap in Terrapin Ridge and gained the Galena Road. Casualties were few, given {{the intensity of the}} battle. Courier George Harkleroad was shot in the neck early in the battle and died; it has been documented that he was killed while peering over the stockade wall's pickets. Besides Welch, the only other garrison casualty was Josiah Nutting, who suffered a non-lethal wound to the side of his head. The number of Sauk casualties is unknown.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after takeoff}} at 16.27 BST (15.27 GMT) on 8 April 1968, {{according}} to the investigations of Rolls-Royce, the 5th stage low-pressure compressor wheel failed in fatigue at the run out radius of the wheel web with the rim, causing secondary failures to other wheels {{and other parts of}} the engine. The wheel then burst through its casing and disconnected the main fuel pipe, igniting the fuel which was being pumped at 50 gallons (approx. 150kg) per minute. The fire could not be put out because the engine's two extinguishers had become ineffectual following the destruction caused to the engine cowling by the broken compressor casing. <b>The</b> <b>ferocity</b> <b>of</b> the blaze soon after caused the engine pylon to fatally weaken, which when it gave way, led to the engine falling off of the wing. However, the fuel booster pump continued to function, intensifying the fire until it spread to the wing itself, sweeping back from forward of the leading edge towards the tail. Upon landing, the application of reverse thrust and the westerly crosswind on runway 05R blew the flames underneath the wing and set light to the fuselage. The rapidly intensifying fire then spread under the plane and ignited the fuel lines and oxygen tanks, which, within seconds of the aircraft coming to a stop, caused a series of explosions that broke through the fuselage and set fire to the cabin, ultimately resulting in the deaths of five people.|$|E
5|$|The Board {{determined}} that the probable cause of this accident was the inadequate consideration given to human factors limitations in the inspection and quality control procedures used by United Airlines' engine overhaul facility. These resulted in the failure to detect a fatigue crack originating from a previously undetected metallurgical defect located in a critical area of the titanium-alloy stage 1 fan disk that was manufactured by General Electric Aircraft Engines. The uncontained {{manner in which the}} engine failed resulted in high-speed metal fragments being hurled from the engine; these fragments penetrated the hydraulic lines of all three independent hydraulic systems on board the aircraft, which rapidly lost their hydraulic fluid. The subsequent catastrophic disintegration of the disk resulted in the liberation of debris in a pattern of distribution and with energy levels that exceeded the level of protection provided by design features of the hydraulic systems that operate the DC-10's flight controls; the flight crew lost its ability to operate nearly all of them. Despite these losses, the crew was able to attain and then maintain limited control by using the throttles to adjust thrust to the remaining wing-mounted engines. By using each engine independently, the crew made rough steering adjustments, and by using the engines together they were able to roughly adjust altitude. The crew guided the crippled jet to Sioux Gateway Airport and lined it up for landing on one of the runways. Without the use of flaps and slats, they were unable to slow down for landing, and were forced to attempt landing at a very high ground speed. The aircraft also landed at an extremely high rate of descent due to the inability to flare (reduce the rate of descent before touchdown by increasing pitch). As a result, upon touchdown the aircraft broke apart, rolled over and caught fire. The largest section came to rest in a cornfield next to the runway. Despite <b>the</b> <b>ferocity</b> <b>of</b> the accident, 185 (62.5%) passengers and crew survived owing to a variety of factors including the relatively controlled manner of the crash and the early notification of emergency services.|$|E
25|$|There {{are various}} legends {{about how the}} Tigers got their nickname. One {{involves}} the orange stripes they wore on their black stockings.

25|$|Until the 20th century, {{the canyon}} area was {{relatively}} unexplored. In 1895, three Frenchmen attempted {{to explore the}} canyon but were drowned in the river. An American came in 1932 but also perished. This gave rise to legends about witchcraft in the areas as well as <b>the</b> <b>ferocity</b> <b>of</b> the area’s crocodiles. In 1960, an expedition of soldiers from the Mexican army, nicknamed the “red handkerchiefs” succeeded into crossing through the canyon by boat over twenty km.
