The area was (of natural development) bounded by left (northern) bank of Dyje river in the south, right (western) bank of Jihlava River in the east and in the north by rectangular plan enclosed V-shaped ditch (and light fence ?). History of this area and its development is probably more older than history of real Roman fort on top of the hill.|$|E
50|$|During Raymond's 27 {{years as}} Executive Director, {{the success of}} the Oak Park Housing Center was {{recognized}} nationally and internationally. In 1973 the Housing Center was named one of the <b>top</b> <b>housing</b> programs in the United States by the Department of Housing and Urban Development. In 1974 the documentary film As Time Goes By: Oak Park, Illinois premiered at the Lake Theater in Oak Park and on television on WTTW. The film was reviewed both favorably and skeptically in Chicago papers and in Variety. In 1976, the accomplishments of the Housing Center, along with the Oak Park Village Mall and the Frank Lloyd Wright Home and Studio, earned Oak Park the coveted All-America City Award. Raymond wrote the winning presentation script. The award was a turning point for Oak Park. It brought extensive publicity and recognition from the National Municipal League and Chicago daily papers. An ABC documentary Oak Park: All American followed.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} 1950s the company, now called Robot-Berning, {{redesigned}} the Robot Star {{and created the}} Vollautomat Star II. The length stayed the same but the height increased by half an inch. The new higher <b>top</b> <b>housing</b> disposed of the right angle finder and instead included an Albada finder with frames for the factory-fitted 38/40 mm and 75 mm lenses. The drive and shutter too were improved. By 1960 the hallmark stamped steel body was replaced by heavier die castings. The camera became, with slight changes, the Robot Star 25 and Star 50. The Robot Star 25 could expose 25 frames on a single winding, and the double-motor Robot Star 50 could expose 50 frames. Since most Robot cameras by then were sold for industrial use where the camera was fixed in position, Robot also introduced versions without a finder, and even without rewind. Although most production dates from the 1950-1960s era, essentially the same camera continued to be manufactured into the late 1990s.|$|E

After this, he goes to a purple area which is made of an archipelago of islands known as the Violet Isles, and fights Paper Wendy at the end of the island chain. Next, Paper Mario goes through an orange mesa area, where he follows a train and fights Paper Larry after he hijacks the train before he goes to collect the Big Paint Star.

5000|$|The first Retina, Nr. 117, was {{introduced}} in late July 1934. The successive model: Nr 118 Retina followed in 1935 with minor modifications to the Nr. 117. The Nr. 119 Retina (I) and the more expensive Nr. 126 Retina (I) follow in 1936. Nr. 117, Nr. 118 and Nr. 119 Retina cameras all had black lacquered top housings, black lacquered body edges and nickel-plated control surfaces. Nr. 126 Retina (I) was the first with a chrome-plated finish to the <b>top</b> <b>housing,</b> chrome-plated top deck below the rewind knob and chrome-plated control surfaces with the body edges being polished aluminum alloy with a clear lacquer coat. Nr. 122 Retina II {{was introduced}} in 1936 with a separate coupled rangefinder and viewfinder and at this point, Nr. 119 and Nr. 126 Retina cameras were designated as [...] "Retina I" [...] cameras. The Nr. 122 Retina II had a problematic film advance lever and was replaced in June 1937 by the Nr. 142 Retina II with {{a return to the}} knob advance. Nr. 141 Retina I is a chrome finished model with a shutter release on the top body which {{was introduced in}} late 1937. Nr. 143 Retina I was the black lacquer/nickel-plated version of the Nr. 141 Retina I introduced in early 1938. The identification of Retina I cameras is based on the finish and configuration of the top housings of each camera and should NOT be based on lens/shutter or serial number, as lenses, shutters and back doors can be easily interchanged by repairman. In 1939 a Nr. 150 Retina IIa was introduced to replace the Nr. 142 Retina II, but it was unrelated to the flash capable Type 016 Retina IIa series of the early 1950s. Also in 1939, the Nr. 148 Retina I and the Nr. 149 Retina I with double exposure prevention are introduced. Late versions of the Type 148 Retina I have a black lacquer finish to the body edges. The last pre-war Retina I is the Nr. 167 Retina I which was manufactured in July 1941 and was for export only. The Nr. 167 Retina I was a [...] "Retina" [...] version of the Nr. 160 Retinette II with basically the same body, but with [...] "Retina" [...] embossed on the back door and a chrome-plated <b>top</b> <b>housing</b> and chrome-plated deck under the rewind knob.|$|E

Six acres of condemned land was repurchased by the county and combined with 16 acres purchased from Turf Valley developer Samuel M.

The community was redeveloped into mixed-income, multi-generational 198 unit community of manor homes, apartment homes and townhouse with an underground parking garage. The community also includes Howard County's Department of Recreation & Parks new 45,000 square foot state-of-the-art Roger Carter Community Center; the Center replacing the former Roger Carter Recreation Center built from a segregated Ellicott City Schoolhouse.
