5|$|A {{total of}} 60 cases {{were ordered to}} be reviewed. A special {{prosecutor}} was hired because Cook County State's Attorney, Richard Devine, had {{a conflict of interest}} stemming from his tenure at the law firm of Phelan, Pope & John, which had defended Burge in two federal suits. Criminal Courts Judge Paul P. Biebel Jr. presided over the determination of the need of a review to determine <b>the</b> <b>propriety</b> of criminal charges and the appointment of the special prosecutor.|$|E
5|$|Newspapers {{in major}} {{international}} cities and Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, and socialist publications reported outrage about the verdict and strong criticism of American society. Southern newspapers, particularly in Mississippi, {{wrote that the}} court system had done its job. Till's story continued to make the news for weeks following the trial, especially sparking debate among Southern, Northern, and black newspapers, the NAACP and various high-profile segregationists about justice for blacks and <b>the</b> <b>propriety</b> of Jim Crow society.|$|E
5|$|While in office, in 2001 Reed {{served as}} the {{campaign}} manager in Shirley Franklin's successful election campaign to become the 58th Mayor of Atlanta. As a campaign manager in an election occurring {{in the shadow of}} the September 11 attacks, he surveyed potential voters' perceptions of <b>the</b> <b>propriety</b> of the campaign's advertising broadcasts. At the time certain ads were thought to focus on sensitive topics. After winning the election, Franklin chose Reed as one of two co-chairs on her transition team. In this role he was charged with identifying and reviewing candidates for cabinet-level positions.|$|E

5|$|After Sibelius's {{death in}} 1957, {{news of the}} Eighth Symphony's {{destruction}} was made public, and {{it was assumed that}} the work had disappeared forever. But in the 1990s, when the composer's many notebooks and sketches were being catalogued, scholars first raised the possibility that fragments of the music for the lost symphony might have survived. Since then, several short manuscript sketches have been tentatively identified with the Eighth, three of which (comprising less than three minutes of music) were recorded by the Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra in 2011. While a few musicologists have speculated that, if further fragments can be identified, {{it may be possible to}} reconstruct the entire work, others have suggested that this is unlikely given the ambiguity of the extant material. <b>The</b> <b>propriety</b> of publicly performing music that Sibelius himself had rejected has also been questioned.|$|E
5|$|In 1643, Governor Winthrop became {{embroiled in}} a {{controversy}} over <b>the</b> <b>propriety</b> of taking sides in a power struggle going on in neighbouring French Acadia. Endecott pointed out {{that he should have}} let the French fight amongst themselves without English involvement, as this would weaken them both. The 1644 governor's election became a referendum on Winthrop's policy; Endecott was elected governor, with Winthrop as his deputy. During his one-year term he oversaw the division of the colony into four counties: Suffolk, Essex, Middlesex, and Norfolk. The ascent of the Salem-based Endecott also prompted an attempt by other Salem residents to have the colonial capital relocated there; the attempt was rejected by the governor's council of assistants.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} the First World War {{dramatically}} shifted public perceptions on <b>the</b> <b>propriety</b> of the man's wristwatch, and opened up a mass market in the post-war era. The creeping barrage artillery tactic, developed during the War, required precise synchronization between the artillery gunners and the infantry advancing behind the barrage. Service watches produced during the War were specially designed for the rigours of trench warfare, with luminous dials and unbreakable glass. Wristwatches were also found to be needed {{in the air as}} much as on the ground: military pilots found them more convenient than pocket watches for the same reasons as Santos-Dumont had. The British War Department began issuing wristwatches to combatants from 1917.|$|E
2500|$|As an administrator, in his {{capacity}} as the chairman of the protest committee of the Greater New York Bridge Association (GNYBA), Kaplan was able to steer between extreme views of <b>the</b> <b>Proprieties.</b> An older group of players tended to regard <b>the</b> <b>Proprieties</b> as pious nonsense, believing that it was unrealistic to demand that players bid and play in tempo: problems arise that require time to consider. A younger group demanded that violations of <b>the</b> <b>proprieties</b> be made part of a playerâ€™s record. (Such violations can include, for example, fumbling with a doubleton on defense: a singleton would be played promptly, with no trace of indecision.) ...|$|R

5|$|By 1770, Sabrina {{began to}} {{question}} Day's techniques and {{to complain about the}} chores she had to perform. In December, <b>the</b> <b>propriety</b> of Day's arrangement with Sabrina was questioned by the local community, especially Anna Seward. Edgeworth joined Day for Christmas at Stowe, and convinced him that his experiment had been unsuccessful. He also persuaded Day that Sabrina was too old to live with him without a chaperone. Day appeared to accept Edgeworth's point of view, as he paid for Sabrina to attend Sutton Coldfield boarding school in Warwickshire early in 1771. She remained at the boarding school for three years, including weekends and holidays, with infrequent visits from Day. The school normally focused on preparing high society daughters for marriage, with subjects such as needlework and the arts. Day stipulated that she was to be taught academic subjects but should not dance or learn music.|$|E
5|$|Speculation {{that this}} would be the {{decision}} had already taken place, and both Glenn and McCain were frustrated that the long delay in resolving their cases was damaging their reputations. However, there were political implications, as the removal of the two would eliminate the only Republican from the case. The committee's work was further made difficult by there being no specific rule that governed <b>the</b> <b>propriety</b> of members intervening with federal regulators. By mid-October, several Republican senators, including former Ethics Committee chair Ted Stevens, were taking the unusual step of publicly complaining about the Ethics Committee's inaction, saying that it was unfair to Glenn and McCain, that the whole lengthy process was unfair to all five, and that political motives might be behind the delays. Eventually, the committee could not agree on the Bennett recommendation regarding Glenn and McCain: vice chair Rudman agreed with Bennett, chair Heflin did not. On October 23, 1990, the committee decided to keep all five senators in the case, and scheduled public hearings to question them and other witnesses.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} {{assimilation}} rate among the Israeli Jewish community {{has always been}} low, <b>the</b> <b>propriety</b> and degree of assimilation of Israeli Jews and Jews worldwide {{has always been a}} significant and controversial issue within the modern Israeli Jewish community, with both political and religious skeptics.|$|E

25|$|Today, {{opinions}} {{on the nature of}} the Eucharist and thus on <b>the</b> <b>propriety</b> of adoration and exposition of the Blessed Sacrament vary in the Anglican tradition (see Anglican Eucharistic theology), but many Anglo-Catholics practice Eucharistic adoration. Others celebrate Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament, which is not unlike Eucharistic adoration.|$|E
25|$|National {{unity is}} the basis of {{national}} security. To deny the legislature the right to select appropriate means for its attainment presents a totally different order of problem from that of <b>the</b> <b>propriety</b> of subordinating the possible ugliness of littered streets to the free expression opinion through handbills.|$|E
25|$|These {{parallel}} themes have {{facilitated the}} extraordinary economic, political, and social {{success of the}} American Jewish community, but also have contributed to widespread cultural assimilation.

25|$|No direct rate regulation: Insurers set {{rates that}} can be changed at an insurer's discretion. Even in this {{apparent}} unregulated situation, a regulatory body still is charged with overseeing the title insurance industry and can question <b>the</b> <b>propriety</b> of a rate {{that appears to be}} unfairly discriminatory or otherwise violates statutory standards.

25|$|Overall, the {{software}} developments {{that have come}} out of the open source movement have not been unique to the computer science field, but they have been successful in developing alternatives to propriety software.

25|$|In Bradwell vs. Illinois, Carpenter {{sought to}} broaden the amendment's protections {{in the case of}} the editor of the Chicago Legal News, Myra Bradwell, who had been denied {{admission}} to the bar of the Illinois Supreme Court because she was a woman. Representing Bradwell, Carpenter argued that no class of people could be excluded from practicing the legal profession. The federal court disagreed, questioning <b>the</b> <b>propriety</b> of ruling on a state's qualifications for admission to the bar.|$|E
25|$|Until Kennedy v. Louisiana, {{some states}} were testing {{the limit of}} this {{restriction}} by enacting death penalty statutes for repeat child rapists. In terms of the Court's capital punishment jurisprudence, Coker signaled the Court's commitment to employing a robust proportionality test for deciding when the death penalty would be an appropriate punishment. The Court would later use this same proportionality test to evaluate <b>the</b> <b>propriety</b> {{of the death penalty}} for felony murder (except for the actual killer), mentally retarded offenders, juvenile offenders, and eventually all crimes except murder and crimes against the state.|$|E
25|$|The {{principle}} of equality was taken extremely seriously up until the 1970s. Kibbutzniks did not individually own tools, or even clothing.

If a member received a gift in servicesâ€”like a visit to a relative or a trip abroad paid for by a parentâ€”there could be arguments at members' meetings about <b>the</b> <b>propriety</b> of accepting such a gift. Up until recently, members ate meals together in the communal dining hall. This was seen as an important aspect of communal life.|$|E
