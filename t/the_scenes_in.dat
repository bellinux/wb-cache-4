5|$|<b>The</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>in</b> Jackie Treehorn's {{house were}} {{shot in the}} Sheats Goldstein Residence, {{designed}} by John Lautner and built in 1963 in the Hollywood Hills.|$|E
5|$|The first {{adaptation}} of Hellblazer ever filmed for {{the screen is}} one of <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>in</b> the documentary feature film The Mindscape of Alan Moore, which was shot in early 2002. The dramatization consists of the John Constantine character wandering through London and, in the film ending, experiencing a mystical epiphany of sorts.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>in</b> Calgary were {{actually}} {{shot in the}} back of the Universal Studios lot in Los Angeles. In order to convert the Los Angeles cityscape into Calgary's, Mat Beck created a matte of the shot; the background buildings were then edited out. A separate shot of Calgary was superimposed in the background and the scenes were mixed.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> King Kong {{in which}} Kong shakes sailors {{off of a}} log bridge was {{inspired}} by <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> Creation in which the Arsinoitherium knocks sailors from a log.|$|R
50|$|Part two of {{the black}} metal special began {{with a look at}} Supernatural Records, black metal labels, <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> South America, <b>the</b> top twenty of the second wave, the black metal {{mainstream}} and <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> North America. <b>The</b> third part contained a look at <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK and Ireland, Scandinavia, Australasia and a look at post-black metal.|$|R
50|$|In filmmaking, {{internal}} rhythm {{is created}} by whatever appears or occurs within the shot of a moving picture. It can change within a scene (film) and from <b>scene</b> to <b>scene.</b> <b>In</b> Citizen Kane, for instance, the internal rhythm of <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> which Kane, Leland, Bernstein, and the movers take over {{the offices of the}} Inquirer differs from the rhythm of <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> which Kane demolishes Susan's bedroom or from <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> which Kane and Susan spend an evening at home at Xanadu.|$|R
5|$|The scenes {{set in the}} Needmore, Pennsylvania were {{actually}} filmed in Douglaston, Queens. Similarly, <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>in</b> Cleveland from the previous episode were filmed in Battery Park City, Manhattan.|$|E
5|$|Wally Pfister {{gave each}} {{location}} and dream level a distinctive look {{to aid the}} audience's recognition of the narrative's location during the heavily crosscut portion of the film: the mountain fortress appears sterile and cool, the hotel hallways have warm hues, and <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>in</b> the van are more neutral.|$|E
5|$|A further {{challenge}} for the dog actor was to lie still in an isolation tank and not move even when petted by Bakula or Billingsley during some long scenes whilst on screen. At times a stunt dog was used, but Breezy was required for any close-ups. A prosthetic Beagle was also created for <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>in</b> the isolation tank and to be submersed in a super-hydration tank. The prop was created by Joel Harlow, who had also created make-up designs for the television series Carnivàle and the film The Chronicles of Riddick.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> Rome where MacLaine and Plummer wade {{into the}} Trevi Fountain is shot {{in black and}} white, to mimic <b>the</b> {{corresponding}} <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> La Dolce Vita.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> which Homer {{is running}} through town {{after he got}} his hair is a {{reference}} to the film It's a Wonderful Life. <b>The</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> which Homer receives the key to the executive washroom is {{a reference to the}} movie Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> baptism <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Godfather {{was filmed}} {{in the old}} Cathedral, as was <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> Godfather Part III in which Michael Corleone {{receives}} an honor from the church.|$|R
5|$|Early in production, Warner Bros. {{decided to}} release Phantasm as a {{theatrical}} release, rather than straight to video. That left {{less than a}} year for production time (most animated features take well over two years from finished story to final release). Due to this decision, the animators went over <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>in</b> order to accommodate the widescreen theatrical aspect ratio. The studio cooperated well, granting the filmmakers a large amount of creative control.|$|E
5|$|Eon again {{turned to}} Richard Maibaum for the script, {{although}} Paul Dehn was later introduced for rewrites. After missing From Russia with Love, Ken Adam returned as production designer. Adam's imagination provided {{the idea of}} gold stacked upon gold behind iron bars for <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>in</b> the United States Bullion Depository. Saltzman disliked the design's resemblance to a prison, but Hamilton liked it enough that it was built.|$|E
5|$|Josh Weinstein {{has said}} {{that there are so many}} sleazy {{characters}} in The Simpsons that it was easy to find people for <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>in</b> the burlesque house. A character modeled after John Swartzwelder can also be seen. Belle was not modeled after anyone in particular and she was redesigned several times. Belle was voiced by Tress MacNeille but there had been previous efforts to cast a guest voice for the role.|$|E
50|$|For <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1975 film Jaws {{in which}} the {{character}} Ben Gardner's corpse pops out from his stationary boat, director Steven Spielberg re-shot <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> swimming pool of editor Verna Fields. Spielberg poured Carnation's powdered milk into the pool in order to simulate the murky waters of Martha's Vineyard where <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> was originally shot.|$|R
50|$|The film shot <b>the</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> Nantong, Jiangsu, China.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{movie in}} which the three sisters have a scuffle with the stepbrother {{is said to be}} one of <b>the</b> most exhilarating <b>scenes</b> <b>in</b> Malayalam Cinema.|$|R
5|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>in</b> Southeast Asia {{takes place}} near a karaoke club, and depicts groups of girls, {{apparently}} {{ranging in age}} from early to late teens, offering sexual services to customers. Benjamin Nolot interviews a police officer, who says that the bar's owner recently bought eight other similar clubs and controls around 2,000 girls. Another Southeast Asian scene shows Nolot and his crew chasing an American man out of a town where he was trying to purchase sex with a child.|$|E
5|$|Shooting of {{the film}} began on May 13, 1957, with the newly created choreography. Presley's {{characteristic}} hairstyle and sideburns were covered with a wig and makeup for <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>in</b> musical number and those set in the jail. During the performance, one of Presley's dental caps fell out and became lodged in his lung. He {{was taken to the}} Cedars of Lebanon Hospital, where he spent the night after the cap was removed. Shooting was resumed the next day. Throughout the film, Presley mimed the songs, which had been previously recorded in the studio and were added to the finished scenes.|$|E
5|$|The Amberley Museum & Heritage Centre {{doubled as}} the {{exterior}} of villain Max Zorin's mine, while <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>in</b> the complex under Zorin's stables were filmed in a Renault plant in Swindon, before primary filming moved to San Francisco. Filming finished in January 1985 at the 007 Stage, with the filming of the interior of Zorin's mine, designed by Peter Lamont.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> gay <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{island of}} Myconos and <b>the</b> lesbian <b>scene</b> <b>in</b> Eressos, Lesbos are famous internationally.|$|R
5|$|The episode {{contains}} several cultural {{references and}} allusions. <b>The</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>in</b> which Henry {{was carrying a}} couple of Apollo Chocolate Candy Bars in his back pack was also the same brand of candy bars made by the DHARMA Initiative on Lost, while Archie's pet Pongo is also {{the name of one}} of the dogs in the Disney film One Hundred and One Dalmatians.|$|E
5|$|The {{film is a}} {{condensed}} {{adaptation of}} Dickens' work, reviewers specifically highlighted the attention to detail and {{the limitations of the}} format when condensing the work to a single reel format. The atmosphere of the film and the portrayal was deemed to be natural except for <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>in</b> open. The director of the film was Barry O'Neil, but the scenario writer and cameraman are uncredited. The surviving status of the film yields to the possibility of further information being gained on the production and details of the work.|$|E
5|$|The outdoor {{scenes were}} filmed around Vancouver's Mount Seymour, with weather {{conditions}} making shooting difficult enough to require {{an extra day}} of work. The episode's production took place just a week before David Duchovny's wedding, with his fiancée Téa Leoni visiting the set during filming. The first cut of the episode was twelve minutes too long, resulting in some of <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>in</b> the mountains being removed. Series creator Chris Carter re-edited the entire episode two days before it aired.|$|E

5|$|The {{production}} team also had significant problems with <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>in</b> the parking garage, {{and how to}} avoid the anatopism of contemporary cars being found on Caprica. In order to avoid this, the {{production team}} used cars mostly found in Eastern Europe, for the purpose that the audience would not immediately recognise the types of cars, but still to keep a sense of realism.|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} {{versions}} of the video. The full, long version is one minute longer than the Making the Video version, while the cut version omits <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>in</b> which she leaves the airport and is sleepy and in which she fills out the questionnaire. The short version begins with Stefani practicing on the piano and her finding the watch just seconds after that. Her being billed is not shown in this version, so the video ends with the Harajuku Girls laughing at her performance.|$|E
5|$|To {{visually}} {{enhance the}} size of this set, the camera was equipped with a 40mm Panavision wide-angle lens and mounted {{at the opposite end of}} the stage, giving Crosby the ability to frame <b>the</b> <b>scenes</b> <b>in</b> his camera with extra space at the bottom and at either side. These areas were filled in later by printing-in process extensions of the set, doubling its size onscreen.|$|E
