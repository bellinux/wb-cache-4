The influence on local contact conditions of parameters such as normal load, global sliding ratio, friction coefficient, and the transient value for applying sliding conditions is then evaluated. Finally, the consequences of these states on local rail plastic deformation are presented and correlated with rail corrugation occurring on straight tracks under acceleration and deceleration conditions...|$|R
