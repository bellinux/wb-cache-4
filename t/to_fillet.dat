For the computational modeling of fatigue crack propagation generally applicable solutions for stress intensity factors have been derived by FE analyses.

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} chemical, nutritional and microbiological evaluation of whole or gutted meagre stored at 4 ± 1 oC. Whole ungutted (Group A), eviscerated (Group B), beheaded-eviscerated fish (Group C) and fillets (Group D) groups were created for this study. According to fatty acid analysis, it was determined that meagre is rich in PUFA content and the n 3 /n 6 ratio is within the ideal limits. In all 4 groups, obtained from fillets values were the highest in general, quality parameters were found within acceptable limits. Psychrophilic and mesophilic aerobic bacteria counts exceeded the standards for fillet groups on 7 th days of storage. According to microbiological analysis, ungutted, beheaded, eviscerated samples were not exceeded limit values on 9 th day. In conclusion, whole or gutted (headed and eviscerated) storage of meagre is found to be more advantageous compared <b>to</b> <b>fillets</b> for storage at 4 ± 1 oC...|$|R

Frozen herring fillet were glazed with water, PJ or 50 mM phosphate buffer of the same pH as herring PJ (6. 5). Over 52 weeks, peroxide value (PV), TBA-reactive substances (TBARS), rancid odour and colour were monitored. From 26 to 52 weeks, water-glazed fillets were significantly (P < 0. 05) more oxidised compared <b>to</b> <b>fillets</b> glazed with PJ or buffer, most clearly shown by PV and TBARS data. The protective effects of both PJ and buffer compared to water could indicate a role, for example, of the physiological ionic strength. The finding that PV became elevated in PJ which was frozen stored alone in a thin layer indicates that PJ stripped from, for example, trace lipids and haemoglobin would provide better protection...|$|R

This study gives a comprehensive overview of muscle flesh composition of farmed and wild Atlantic turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) and barramundi (Lates calcarifer) and of farmed pangasius (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus). The proximate composition, di- and triphosphates and citric acid values are presented in order to evaluate possible indicators for a hidden treatment during processing <b>to</b> <b>fillets.</b> All moisture contents were ≤ 80 %. Even for pangasius, protein values for deep skinned fillets of ≥ 18 % were determined. Only small quantities of naturally occurring citric acid (up to 0. 03 g·kg− 1) were detectable. The lipid content was the most varying main component within the different species, ranging between 1. 2 % to 2. 0 % and 0. 3 % to 3. 0 % for farmed turbot and barramundi, respectively. Pangasius flesh had a mean lipid content of 7. 8 %. Trimming and separation of the red layer reduced the lipid content of the commercially sold white-flesh <b>fillets</b> <b>to</b> 2. 7 % to 3. 5 %.
