The goal is to lift, from programmers to optimizing compilers, the heavy burden of determining program details that are dependent on the hardware characteristics. The expected benefit is to improve robustness, portability and efficiency of the generated computer programs. We address these requirements by: (1) <b>treating</b> <b>machine</b> and program parameters as unknown symbols during code generation, and (2) generating optimized programs {{in the form of}} a case discussion, based on the possible values of the machine and program parameters.

Seeds were sampled before processing and after leaving the air and screen machine (upper and intermediary screens and bottom); first gravity table (drift, upper and intermediate spouts); second gravity table (upper, intermediate, and lower spouts), and <b>treating</b> <b>machine</b> for dyeing the seeds. The sanitary analyses were conducted according to the filter paper method, with and without superficial disinfestation of the seeds, which were incubated at a temperature of 20 ± 2 °C with photoperiod of 12 h for seven days. Some seed processing steps may reduce the incidence of seeds of P. maximum cv. ‘Tanzania’ contaminated with Phoma sp. and Helminthosporium sp. In general, the processing can increase the incidence of seeds contaminated with Cladosporium sp. and Cercospora sp.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} {{visualizations}} for machine learning tasks. More specifically, we create a taxonomy for existing machine learning visualizations, and design {{a system to}} help machine learning novices perform labelling tasks. There are many mature visualizations to help people understand the performance of current classifiers, including scatterplots, confusion matrices and ROC curves. However, most machine learning researchers are unaware of the visualization possibilities that exist, and many published visualizations are too task-oriented or dataset-oriented to be easily applied to other tasks. This thesis defines a taxonomy for machine learning visualizations in three dimensions: the data displayed, the advanced features to add for a specific task, and {{the goal of the}} visualizations. This taxonomy seeks to help machine learning researchers select a better visualization method to analyze their data. Previous machine learning tools focus on presenting comprehensive information to experts, <b>treating</b> <b>machine</b> learning as a black-box for end-users, or explaining the reason behind the prediction in a simple and clear way. However, to build a machine learning system, one needs to label data first, and a lot of machine learning novices want to build a classifier themselves simply by labelling data. This inspired our idea to design and implement the Label-and-Learn system, which includes five visualizations to help users better understand their data, the likelihood of the classifier's success, and to improve their user experience. To evaluate the utility of our Label-and-Learn system, we ran user studies to compare the visualization system and traditional system in the quality of the labels, the user's mental model about the task, and the user experience. The results from the experiment show that visualizations have no negative effect {{on the quality of the}} labels, but do improve the user's mental model and the user experience. The success of the Label-and-Learn system should inspire further research in using visualizations to improve the user experience of data labelling in machine learning tasks...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is about}} efforts to reconstruct industry {{to make it}} palatable to the English public and to enable the government to involve itself in the industrial sector. At {{a time when it}} was difficult to do so, taste and science became avenues for the government to insert control over the production sphere. Manufacture was represented as a product of taste and science and hence industrialization became culture. Before the Great Exhibition of 1851, concerns were raised that British manufacture was lacking in taste. The exhibition was initially intended to showcase taste, but that proved to be difficult. Nevertheless, in its aftermath, the Department of Practical Art was established and it defined the exact impact of taste and the exact measurements that needed to be taken to combat bad taste. As products of taste, industrial manufacture was defined as having aesthetic, moral and social dimensions and pressures were put on manufacturers to take up the role as upholders of good taste. By defining and <b>treating</b> <b>machine</b> production as culture, the government institutions extended the role of mass production beyond mere economy. The Great Exhibition was originally intended to promote both science and taste, and with the surplus generated from the exhibition, the Royal Commissioners of 1851 sought to establish an institution of science and technology. To reach its goals, the Commissioners prompted the establishment of the Department of Science and Art, but its initial policies failed. The Department then used exhibitionary strategies as well as examinations to promote science as a necessary knowledge. At the South Kensington Museum, the familiar was presented in an open, inviting setting to entice acceptance of the theoretical subcontext. Science was promoted as culture to further the idea that it was necessary to establish a central institution of science. This study shows the importance of placing educational measures in their actual context rather than focusing on topics such as decline and progress. In the decades around 1850, industry was defined as culture to transgress prominent contemporary definitions which constructed it in terms of the market or as the preeminence of the workplace...|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} on the pathogens Septoria tritici and Septoria nodorum, and the wheat diseases they cause has been reviewed, including methods of disease assessment and some aspects of fungicide application and mode of action. Both S. tritici and S. nodorum have ascogenous states, and these are a Mycosphaerella sp. and Leptosphaeria nodorum respectively. Perithecia of both were found in old leaf tissue in wheat stubble soon after harvest. Perithecia began to mature {{by the end of}} February, and wind-borne ascospores were trapped from March to June, 1974. Those of L. nodorum were trapped two weeks before any Mycosphaerella ascospores were found. The release of both ascospore types appeared to be in response to moisture. Viable ascospores of both types could still be detected in June. Ascospores of these two species would be capable of initiating infection in autumn-sown wheat crops some distance from other inoculum sources (i. e. pycnidia), and hence would be important in the epidemiology of the Septoria diseases of wheat. A field survey of wheat crops in Canterbury during 1973 failed to detect S. nodorum. Symptoms caused by this fungus were first seen on the basal leaves of volunteer wheat plants in spring of 1974, as discrete brown necrotic lesions, bordered by a ring of chlorotic tissue. The lesion did not coalesce, as do those caused by S. tritici. At no stage did pycnidia develop on leaves in the field, but when leaves with lesions were floated on a benzimidazole solution and placed under near ultra-violet (NUV) light for a 12 hour photoperiod, pycnidia developed four days later. Laboratory tests showed that a temperature of l 8 - 24 °C, light, 95 - 100 % R. H. and senescing tissue were important factors governing the appearance of pycnidia of S. nodorum in leaf tissue. S. nodorum was isolated from these pycnidia, and inoculation experiments showed that the cultures of this fungus were pathogenic to wheat. Cultures which developed from ascospores of L. nodorum were found to be S. nodoxum and also shown to be pathogenic to wheat. Colonies of S. nodorum grew on malt, but better on oatmeal and potato-dextrose agar. Sporulation occurred after 20 - 30 days incubation at 20 - 22 °C under a light regime of 12 hours NUV/ 12 hours darkness, and was greatest in those colonies grown on oatmeal agar. S. nodorum was not observed on the glumes of wheat. An examination of twenty-five Canterbury lines of wheat seed failed to reveal the presence of S. nodorum. S. txitici was common in wheat crops in Canterbury during 1973 and 1974. Symptoms first appeared on young leaves as discrete chlorotic lesions, which eventually coalesced into large necrotic lesions, containing black pycnidia, often with a broad chlorotic marginal zone. These lesions often covered the entire leaf area. By heading (G. S. 10), S. tritici infection could be found on all leaves of the wheat plant, but was not observed on the glumes. A 'black' and a 'white' cultural race of S. tritici was isolated from separate lesions on wheat plants from the field. These races, inoculated to wheat, produced identical symptoms and signs in the host plant, but in culture were distinct and did not produce any variants. Both could be isolated from lesions on leaves throughout the growing season of the plant, but at no stage in time were both races isolated from the same lesion. Pycnidia of S. tritici containing pycnidiospores, were also found to be present within old leaves of wheat stubble from February to June. Pycnidiospores from these pycnidia were still viable in May, but by June, their viability had markedly decreased. Aotea wheat plants in a replicated field trial became naturally infected by S. tritici. When sprayed with benomyl or mancozeb at ear emergence, a significant increase in 1000 grain weight was produced. This increase appeared to be due to a reduction of infection and delaying of senescence of the flag leaf. However, yield was not significantly increased, although there was 14 % more grain produced from treated plots. Benomyl and thiophanate-methyl applied at tillering did not increase yield, although S. tritici was controlled for up to six weeks. Field assessments of six wheat varieties showed that Hilgendorf and Kopara showed some tolerance to S. tritici, Arawa and Karamu were moderately susceptible, and Aotea and Gamenya were highly susceptible. When inoculated with S. tritiei in the laboratory, these varieties reacted similarly. Varietal reaction to S. nodorum in the laboratory was similar to the S. tritici results. The {{literature on}} stinking smut, or bunt, (Tilletia caries, and Tilletia foetida) of wheat in New Zealand was reviewed, including data on incidence, control measures, and the assessment of fungicidal activity on seed by bioassay methods. Grain samples of eight wheat varieties from each of the 1970 to 1973 harvests were tested by means of a 'Washings test' for the presence of Tilletia teliospores. The main variety in New Zealand, Aotea, contained significantly more teliospores per sample than any other variety. Further Aotea samples were tested to indicate the incidence of bunt in the 1973 crop. A total of 244 Aotea wheat samples from the wheat growing counties of New Zealand were tested for Tilletia teliospores, with the number of samples tested per county being proportional to the area of wheat grown. Of these, 2 samples from the North Island, 6 from North Canterbury, 4 from Mid-Canterbury, 6 from South Canterbury and 4 from Southland were infected; the 22 infected samples being 9 % of the total number tested. All teliospores detected were those of Tilletia caries, and all were present as trace amounts. A visual examination of 21 treated wheat seed samples from five grain merchants in Canterbury showed that the coverage of seed with fungicide, applied as a slurry, was very variable. This was confirmed by bioassay tests on nine samples which showed that nearly 30 % of the seeds tested were receiving less than half the recommended rate of fungicide coverage, and approximately 6 % of these seeds were receiving no fungicide at all. This appeared to be a fault of the slurry <b>treating</b> <b>machine</b> used, rather than that of the operators. Three samples of wheat seed, slurry treated by another type of machine, were found to be less variable in coverage...|$|E

40|$|Cognitive dissonance, {{the mental}} {{discomfort}} experienced {{when a person}} hold contradictory beliefs and/or behaviors, has been studied through the effort justification paradigm – wherein people prefer a reward more when they have put more effort towards it. Contrast theory, a behaviorist approach, says this preference {{is due to the}} greater difference between participant’s starting and ending state.

Afterwards, they were given a preference test to see if they formed a preference for the treat associated with the severely annoying noise (consistent with the effort justification paradigm). One explanation for the effort justification effect is contrast theory, which was eliminated by assigning dogs to either a contingent or non-contingent treatment.

However because these materials are extremely hard and brittle, development of an ideal machining process has been a challenge for researchers. Non-traditional machining processes such as abrasive jet and ultrasonic machining have improved machining quality but these processes typically results with issues of poor surface integrity, high tool wear and low productivity. Therefore a machining technique that overcomes the disadvantages of existing methods must be developed. This study focused primarily on improving the machinability and attaining crack-free machined surfaces on transparent {{brittle materials}} by inducing micro cracks or seed damages on the subsurface of the materials. The hypothesis was that micro-cracks induced by femtosecond laser would synergistically assist the material removal process by a cutting tool by weakening or softening the material, followed by conventional machining process. Laser induced damages due to varying laser intensities and at different depths in bulk BK 7 glass was studied in order to select the optimal laser machining conditions for the experiments.
