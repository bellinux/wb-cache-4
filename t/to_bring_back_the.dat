According to the US military, Khamis received his funding and orders directly from Saddam, then still a fugitive.|$|E

5|$|Despite 1980's playoff defeat, the Browns {{were widely}} {{expected}} to be even better the following year. But 1981 came {{with none of the}} comebacks or late-game magic the Kardiac Kids were known for. Several games were close, but most were losses. Sipe threw only 17 touchdowns and was intercepted 25 times. The team finished 5–11. The 1982 NFL strike, which began in September and lasted until mid-November, shortened the regular season the following year to nine games. Coming off a poor year, Sipe split starts with his backup, Paul McDonald, and neither was able <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> old Kardiac Kids spark. The team ended with a 4–5 record, which qualified for an expanded Super Bowl playoff tournament created to accommodate the shorter season. The Browns faced the Raiders in a rematch of 1980's playoff thriller. This time, though, McDonald was the starter and the ending was far from tense. The Raiders won 27–10.|$|E
