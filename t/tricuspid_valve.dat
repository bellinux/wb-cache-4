5|$|The right heart {{consists}} of two chambers, the right atrium and the right ventricle, separated by a valve, the <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|E
5|$|The valves {{between the}} atria and ventricles {{are called the}} {{atrioventricular}} valves. Between the right atrium and the right ventricle is the <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve.</b> The <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> has three cusps, which connect to chordae tendinae and three papillary muscles named the anterior, posterior, and septal muscles, after their relative positions. The mitral valve lies between the left atrium and left ventricle. It {{is also known as}} the bicuspid valve due to its having two cusps, an anterior and a posterior cusp. These cusps are also attached via chordae tendinae to two papillary muscles projecting from the ventricular wall.|$|E
5|$|The right heart {{collects}} deoxygenated {{blood from}} two large veins, the superior and inferior venae cavae. Blood collects {{in the right}} and left atrium continuously. The superior vena cava drains blood from above the diaphragm and empties into the upper back part of the right atrium. The inferior vena cava drains the blood from below the diaphragm and empties into the back part of the atrium below the opening for the superior vena cava. Immediately above and {{to the middle of the}} opening of the inferior vena cava is the opening of the thin-walled coronary sinus. Additionally, the coronary sinus returns deoxygenated blood from the myocardium to the right atrium. The blood collects in the right atrium. When the right atrium contracts, the blood is pumped through the <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> into the right ventricle. As the right ventricle contracts, the <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> closes and the blood is pumped into the pulmonary trunk through the pulmonary valve. The pulmonary trunk divides into pulmonary arteries and progressively smaller arteries throughout the lungs, until it reaches capillaries. As these pass by alveoli carbon dioxide is exchanged for oxygen. This happens through the passive process of diffusion.|$|E

50|$|Heart valve {{dysplasia}} is a congenital heart defect {{which affects}} the aortic, pulmonary, mitral, and <b>tricuspid</b> heart <b>valves.</b> Dysplasia of the mitral and <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valves</b> can cause leakage of blood or stenosis.|$|R
5000|$|The {{closing of}} the mitral and <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valves</b> (known {{together}} as the atrioventricular valves) {{at the beginning of}} ventricular systole cause the first part (the lubb) of the [...] "lubb-dubb" [...] sound made by the heart as it beats. Formally, this sound is known as the first heart sound, or S1. This first heart sound is created by the closure of the mitral and <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valves</b> and is actually a two component sound, M1, T1.|$|R
5|$|The low oxygen level {{leads to}} {{physiologic}} constriction of the pulmonary arteries to correct ventilation-perfusion mismatching, which puts excessive {{strain on the}} right side of the heart. When this leads to right sided heart failure, it is known as cor pulmonale. Symptoms of this disorder occur because the heart has difficulty pumping blood from the body through the lungs. Fluid may, therefore, accumulate in the skin of the legs in the form of edema (swelling), and in the abdominal cavity in the form of ascites; decreased exercise tolerance and exertional chest pain may occur. On physical examination, characteristic findings are the presence of a raised jugular venous pressure, a palpable parasternal heave, a heart murmur due to blood leaking through the <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve,</b> hepatomegaly (an enlarged liver), ascites and leg edema. Cor pulmonale occurs in about a third of all people with OHS.|$|E

40|$|ObjectivesPatients with {{congenital}} bicuspid {{aortic valve}}s have aortic valve stenosis {{at a relatively}} young age compared with patients with <b>tricuspid</b> aortic <b>valves.</b> We hypothesize that aortic valve stenosis evolves from a more aggressive inflammatory process, with increased macrophage/T-cell and neovessel content in congenital bicuspid aortic valveswhen compared with that seen in <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valves.</b> MethodsFifty-one severely stenotic aortic valves were obtained {{at the time of}} aortic valve replacement. A total of 17 bicuspid and 34 <b>tricuspid</b> aortic <b>valves</b> were evaluated. Macrophage/T-cell infiltration (CD 68 plus CD 3) and neovessel density (CD 34) were evaluated with immunohistochemical staining. Leaflet calcification and ossification were also quantified. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to assess expression of chondromodulin 1 and vascular endothelial growth factor. ResultsThe density of macrophages/T cells was greater in congenital bicuspid aortic <b>valves</b> than in <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valves</b> (51 ± 31 vs 23 ± 13 cells/mm 2, P = . 002). Neovascularization was more frequently noted in congenital bicuspid aortic valves when compared with <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valves</b> (31 ± 10 vs 21 ± 9 vessels/mm 2, P = . 0005), and calcification was more severe (P = . 03). Expression of chondromodulin 1 demonstrated a 6 -fold downregulation (P = . 0003) and expression of vascular endothelial growth factor demonstrated a 2 -fold increase (P = . 02) in congenital bicuspid aortic valves compared with that seen in <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valves.</b> Multivariable analyses demonstrated significant associations between bicuspid aortic valve anatomy and increased inflammatory cell infiltration (β =  25. 8, P = . 0007) and neovascularization (β =  9. 4, P = . 001), despite adjusting for measured covariates. ConclusionsThe pathogenesis of aortic valve stenosis in bicuspid aortic valves is associated with a more aggressive inflammatory process with increased macrophage infiltration and neovascularization when compared with that seen in <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valves...</b>|$|R

25|$|Heart valve {{dysplasia}} (including mitral and <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> dysplasia) is a congenital heart abnormality in dogs.

25|$|SLE {{may cause}} {{pericarditis}} - {{inflammation of the}} outer lining surrounding the heart, myocarditis - inflammation of the heart muscle, and/or endocarditis - inflammation of the inner lining of the heart. The endocarditis of SLE is non-infectious, and is also called (Libman–Sacks endocarditis). It involves either the mitral valve or the <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve.</b> Atherosclerosis also occurs more often and advances more rapidly than in the general population.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to compare the calcium burden of the aortic valve and {{coronary}} arteries with multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) in a propensity score–matched population of patients with a bicuspid versus a <b>tricuspid</b> aortic <b>valve.</b> From an ongoing clinical registry of patients who underwent MDCT, 70 patients with bicuspid aortic valve and 210 patients with <b>tricuspid</b> aortic <b>valve</b> were matched based on age, gender, cardiovascular risk factors, chest pain symptoms, and MDCT indication. Aortic valve calcium and the presence and severity of coronary artery disease were analyzed. Patients were divided into age quintiles. The median Agatston coronary artery score (27 [0 to 563] vs 0 [0  to 57], p = 0. 003) was higher in patients with a <b>tricuspid</b> aortic <b>valve</b> compared with those with a bicuspid aortic valve. In contrast, patients with bicuspid aortic valve had a significantly larger calcium volume of the aortic valve than those with <b>tricuspid</b> aortic <b>valve</b> (391 [43 to 2, 028] mm 3 vs 0 [0 to 1, 844] mm 3, p < 0. 001). In patients with bicuspid aortic valve, the calcification process of the aortic valve started at an earlier age (second quintile 35 to 51  years) compared with those with <b>tricuspid</b> aortic <b>valve,</b> whereas the coronary atherosclerosis process was similar in both groups. In conclusion, patients with bicuspid aortic valve show larger aortic valve calcium load and at earlier age than those with <b>tricuspid</b> aortic <b>valve,</b> independently from the extent of calcium in the coronary arteries. Calcific deposits were heavier in bicuspid than in <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valves...</b>|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the relative importance}} of the different causes of isolated aortic valve stenosis in a surgical series, and to relate these to patient characteristics including the rate of insertion of bypass grafts for coronary artery disease. DESIGN: Survey of the clinical and pathological data on patients undergoing aortic valve replacement for isolated stenosis. SETTING: Tertiary care cardiothoracic surgical unit. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 465 adult patients undergoing aortic valve replacement representing a consecutive series in one surgical unit. Retrospective review of patients records and classification of cause of aortic stenosis based on pathological examination of excised valve cusps. RESULTS: 63. 7 % patients had calcific bicuspid valves, 26. 9 % <b>tricuspid</b> calcific <b>valves,</b> and 5. 4 % rheumatic, 2. 6 % mixed pathology and 1. 5 % unicommissural valves. The ratio of males to females for bicuspid valves was 1. 85 : 1 and for <b>tricuspid</b> calcific <b>valves</b> 0. 76 : 1. The mean age of patients with bicuspid valves was 64. 9 years compared with 73. 4 years for those with <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valves.</b> Some 22. 3 % of patients with bicuspid valves and 44. 8 % of those with <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valves</b> had sufficient coronary artery disease to necessitate insertion of coronary bypass grafts. The differential rate of insertion of coronary bypass grafts was independent of age. CONCLUSIONS: Bicuspid calcified aortic valves are the predominant cause of isolated aortic valve stenosis followed by <b>tricuspid</b> calcified aortic <b>valves.</b> The sex and age distribution of bicuspid and <b>tricuspid</b> calcific aortic <b>valve</b> stenosis is different. The higher rate of insertion of vascular grafts in <b>tricuspid</b> calcific aortic <b>valves</b> may indicate that risk factors for atherosclerosis enhance cusp calcification in these patients...|$|R
25|$|The primary {{mechanism}} {{is likely to}} be high pulmonary vascular pressures with concurrent negative airway pressures, causing extreme stress across the pulmonary capillary membrane (the fragile membrane separating blood in the pulmonary capillaries from the air-filled alveoli) and consequent hemorrhage into the air spaces of the lung. Other contributing factors may include upper airway obstruction, increased blood viscosity, abnormalities of cardiac origin (small cross-sectional area of atrioventricular valves, stiff valves, slow left ventricular relaxation time, right <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> regurgitation), preferential distribution of blood flow to the dorsocaudal lung regions, mechanical trauma, lower airway obstruction, inflammation, abnormalities of blood coagulation, inhomogeneity of ventilation and locomotory trauma. EIPH begins in the dorso-caudal region of the lung and progresses in a cranioventral direction over time.|$|E
500|$|The right atrium is {{connected}} to the right ventricle by the <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve.</b> The walls of the right ventricle are lined with trabeculae carneae, ridges of cardiac muscle covered by endocardium. In addition to these muscular ridges, a band of cardiac muscle, also covered by endocardium, known as the moderator band reinforces the thin walls of the right ventricle and plays a crucial role in cardiac conduction. It arises from {{the lower part of the}} interventricular septum and crosses the interior space of the right ventricle to connect with the inferior papillary muscle. The right ventricle tapers into the pulmonary trunk, into which it ejects blood when contracting. The pulmonary trunk [...] branches into the left and right pulmonary arteries that carry the blood to each lung. The pulmonary valve lies between the right heart and the pulmonary trunk.|$|E

40|$|The Doppler echocardiographic {{characteristics}} of 70 prosthetic valves in 35 patients are reported. Twenty nine patients had a Björk-Shiley prosthesis in both mitral and tricuspid positions and six had Carpentier-Edwards valves in both sites. Five {{of the patients}} had abnormal tricuspid prostheses {{on the basis of}} clinical and echocardiographic criteria. Pulsed wave Doppler echocardiography was used in all examinations. The pressure half times for the normal <b>tricuspid</b> prosthetic <b>valves,</b> 105 (40) ms (Björk-Shiley) and 97 (53) ms (Carpentier-Edwards), were significantly longer than those of normal mitral prosthetic valves, 75 (18) ms (Björk-Shiley) and 83 (15) ms (Carpentier-Edwards). The range of pressure half times for the abnormal <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valves</b> (237 - 530 ms) was distinct from that of the apparently normal <b>tricuspid</b> prosthetic <b>valves</b> (38 - 197 ms). There was an increase in the peak velocity of the obstructed <b>tricuspid</b> prosthetic <b>valves</b> (1. 69 (0. 12) m/s) in comparison with normal prostheses (1. 06 (0. 26) m/s). The normal range of pressure half times for the Björk-Shiley and Carpentier-Edwards valves in the mitral position is not applicable to the same <b>valves</b> in the <b>tricuspid</b> position. The <b>valve</b> appears to function well with very long pressure half times but a pressure half time of greater than 200 ms coupled with a peak velocity of greater than 1. 60 ms without significant <b>valve</b> regurgitation indicates <b>tricuspid</b> obstruction of the <b>tricuspid</b> prosthetic <b>valve...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Oxygen {{deprived}} {{blood from}} the superior and inferior vena cava enters the right atrium {{of the heart and}} flows through the <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> (right atrioventricular valve) into the right ventricle, from which it is then pumped through the pulmonary semilunar valve into the pulmonary artery to the lungs.

2500|$|Mechanical {{heart valves}} (MHV) are {{prosthetics}} designed {{to replicate the}} function of the natural valves of the human heart. [...] The human heart contains four valves: <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve,</b> pulmonic valve, mitral valve and aortic valve. Their main purpose is to maintain unimpeded forward flow through the heart and from the heart into the major blood vessels connected to the heart, the pulmonary artery and the aorta. [...] As a result of a number of disease processes, both acquired and congenital, any one of the four heart valves may malfunction and result in either stenosis (impeded forward flow) and/or backward flow (regurgitation). [...] Either process burdens the heart and may lead to serious problems including heart failure. [...] A mechanical heart valve is intended to replace a diseased heart valve with its prosthetic equivalent.|$|E
2500|$|The first heart sound, or S1, {{forms the}} [...] "lub" [...] of [...] "lub-dub" [...] and is {{composed}} of components M1 (mitral valve closure) and T1 (<b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> closure). Normally M1 precedes T1 slightly. It {{is caused by the}} [...] closure of the atrioventricular valves, i.e. tricuspid and mitral (bicuspid), at the beginning of ventricular contraction, or systole. When the ventricles begin to contract, so do the papillary muscles in each ventricle. The papillary muscles are attached to the cusps or leaflets of the tricuspid and mitral valves via chordae tendineae (heart strings). When the papillary muscles contract, the chordae tendineae become tense and thereby prevent the backflow of blood into the lower pressure environment of the atria. The chordae tendineae act a bit like the strings on a parachute, and allow the leaflets of the valve to balloon up into the atria slightly, but not so much as to evert the cusp edges and allow back flow of blood. It is the pressure created from ventricular contraction that closes the valve, not the papillary muscles themselves. The contraction of the ventricle begins just prior to AV valves closing and prior to the semilunar valves opening. The sudden tensing of the chordae tendineae and the squeezing of the ventricles against closed semilunar valves, sends blood rushing back toward the atria, and the parachute-like valves catch the rush of blood in their leaflets causing the valve to snap shut. The S1 sound results from reverberation within the blood associated with the sudden block of flow reversal by the valves. The delay of T1 even more than normally causes the split S1 which is heard in a right bundle branch blockage.|$|E
50|$|The {{papillary}} {{muscles are}} muscles {{located in the}} ventricles of the heart.

6000|$|... "You {{misunderstand}} me," [...] I repeated: [...] "I am speaking literally, not figuratively. Have you {{a central}} vascular organ on your left-hand side, with two auricles and ventricles, a mitral and a <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve,</b> {{and the usual}} accompaniment of aorta, pulmonary vein, pulmonary artery, systole and diastole, and so forth?" ...|$|E
60|$|Section 44. The {{beating of}} the heart is, of course, a {{succession}} of contractions and expansions of its muscular wall. The contraction, or systole, commences {{at the base of}} the venae cavae and passes to the auricles, driving the blood before it into the ventricles, which then contract sharply and drive it on into the aorta or pulmonary artery; a pause and then a dilatation, the diastole follows. The flow of the blood is determined in one direction by the various valves {{of the heart}}. No valves occur in the opening of the superior cavae but an imperfect one, the Eustachian valve, protects the inferior cava; the direction of the heart's contraction prevents any excessive back-flow into the veins, and the onward, tendency is encouraged by the suck of the diastole of the ventricles. Between the left ventricle and auricle is a valve made up of two flaps of skin, the mitral valve, the edges of the flaps being connected with the walls of the ventricle through the intermediation of small muscular threads, the chordae tendinae, which stretch across its cavity to little muscular pillars, the papillary muscles; these attachments prevent the mitral valve from flapping back into the auricle, and as the blood flows into and accumulates in the ventricle it gets behind the flaps of the valve and presses its edges together. When the systole of the ventricle occurs, the increased, tension of the blood only closes the aperture the tighter, and the current passes on into the aorta, where we find three watch-pocket valves, with the pocket turned away from the heart, which are also closed and tightened by any attempt at regurgitation (back-flow). A similar process occurs on the right side of the heart, but here, instead of a mitral valve of two flaps between auricle and ventricle, we have a <b>tricuspid</b> <b>valve</b> with three. The thickness of the muscular walls, in view of the lesser distance through which it has to force the blood, -are- [is] less for the right ventricle than the left.|$|E
