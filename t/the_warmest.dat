5|$|Most of the {{precipitation}} {{comes from}} frontal systems associated with cyclogenesis and strong southeasterly winds (Sudestada), which bring {{long periods of}} precipitation, cloudy weather and cooler temperatures. Winters are cloudy while relative humidity is very high, often 90% or higher, making the weather dull, grey and cool. Occasionally, warm air masses from the north bring warmer temperatures. These warm air masses can bring sunny weather, particularly during the afternoon when {{they come from the}} north or northwest {{as a result of a}} trough located in central Argentina. On the other hand, warm air masses from Brazil bring humid conditions, featuring high humidity with high cloud cover that is typical of a warm front of a frontal system and typical of tropical maritime air. These warm air masses that are responsible for the high humidity and cloud cover are <b>the</b> <b>warmest</b> air masses, leading to <b>the</b> <b>warmest</b> temperatures. Nonetheless, these are short lived as the Chaco Low, which is responsible for bringing in warm and tropical air from the north is weaker in winter due to lower insolation, leading to the winds from the north being less intense and shorter lived.|$|E

Data for this study consists of aircraft data averaged over one minute supplimented by satellite and drifting buoy observations.

40|$|AbstractProjections of {{equatorial}} {{sea surface}} temperature from CMIP 5 climate models {{are important for}} understanding possible future changes in marine habitats, local rainfall and climate processes such as El Niño Southern Oscillation. Interpreting the projected changes in the tropical Pacific {{is complicated by the}} systematic cold tongue bias and overly westward location of <b>the</b> <b>Warm</b> Pool edge at the equator in coupled models. Here an index based on the maximum zonal salinity gradient is used to differentiate <b>the</b> <b>Warm</b> Pool from <b>the</b> cold tongue in each of 19 CMIP 5 models. Warming is then calculated relative to the dynamic edge of <b>the</b> <b>Warm</b> Pool between <b>the</b> second halves of the 20 th and 21 st Centuries from the RCP 8. 5 scenario to provide a bias adjusted SST projection. Based on this definition of the edge, while <b>the</b> <b>Warm</b> Pool edge is projected to warm, it is likely to remain within 10 ° of its present longitude. This is {{in stark contrast to the}} large projected eastward displacements of the isotherms that are usually used to define the edge. Adjusting for <b>the</b> edge, <b>warming</b> within <b>the</b> <b>Warm</b> Pool is projected to be fairly uniform with surface water freshening. Projected warming is enhanced over the cold tongue with the net effect of reducing the zonal SST gradient. In contrast, if <b>the</b> <b>warming</b> is calculated without correcting for the edge of <b>the</b> <b>Warm</b> Pool, <b>the</b> <b>warming</b> signature is dominated by the poorer performing models with an overly westward Warm Pool, resulting in enhanced <b>warming</b> across <b>the</b> equatorial Pacific. Bias adjusting realigns <b>the</b> <b>warming</b> signature and reduces the model spread of projected <b>warming.</b> <b>The</b> biased <b>warming</b> signature also introduces spurious meridional and zonal SST gradients. This will potentially alter the behaviour of the atmospheric convergence zones and the dynamics of ENSO which is influenced by the extent of <b>the</b> <b>Warm</b> Pool and zonal SST gradients...|$|R

The thermohaline causes are shown to contribute positively to <b>warming</b> in <b>the</b> Okhotsk Sea Intermediate Water (OSIW). The heat budget analysis for the OSIW indicates that <b>the</b> <b>warming</b> is related to a decrease in cold and dense shelf water (DSW) flux, which is caused by a decrease in sea ice and surface water freshening. In contrast, the wind cause has a cooling effect in the OSIW through an increase in DSW. In the subarctic frontal region, <b>the</b> <b>warming</b> is mainly caused by the wind stress change. The heat budget analysis indicates that <b>the</b> <b>warming</b> is related to an increase in the northward advection of <b>the</b> subtropical <b>warm</b> water.
