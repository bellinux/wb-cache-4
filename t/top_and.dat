5|$|By the mid-1980s, synth-pop {{had helped}} {{establish}} the synthesizer {{as a primary}} instrument in mainstream pop music.

5|$|He {{recognised}} German {{skill in}} constructing trench parapets: by {{making use of}} an irregular <b>top</b> <b>and</b> face to the parapet, and constructing it from material of varying composition, {{the presence of a}} sniper or an observer poking his head up became much less conspicuous. In contrast, British trench practice had been to give a military-straight neat edge to the parapet top, making any movement or protrusion immediately obvious.|$|E
