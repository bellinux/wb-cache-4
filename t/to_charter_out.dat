The new consumer groups entering the market had low willingness to pay, {{and the demand}} for premium charter services was low. The company was faced with not being able <b>to</b> <b>charter</b> <b>out</b> the plane because of the low seat numbers, but could not put in the extra seats because of the aircraft also being used on the scheduled market. Using so large aircraft on the short-haul flights in Southern Norway gave little economy-of-scale, and the airline seldom needed the increased capacity. Braathens SAFE also had problems, because from order to delivery, the exchange rates had increased from 5 to 9 NOK per USD, almost doubling the price in NOK. In 1986, the two 767s where sold. Two years later, Altas Resor was sold, and the following year Saga. Braathens SAFE closed its bases in Gothenburg and Stockholm, but remained a charter operator with 737s from Norway.|$|E

40|$|Approximately 80 % of {{the world}} trade {{measured}} in volume is carried at sea and there are accordingly many different actors making the shipping industry close to a perfect market. The shipping industry is also a highly volatile industry with abrupt market fluctuations. Under such premises correct timing of decisions becomes essential {{for those who want to}} succeed. The nature of the shipping industry also makes it difficult to conduct strategic planning because the fluctuations and irregular pattern between the cycles make the future hard to predict. In this thesis an optimization model that can be used as a tool for strategic planners is presented. An introduction to the shipping industry is given in order to set the background for developing an optimization model. Different types of planning are discussed and important issues connected to strategic planning in shipping are addressed. A deterministic optimization model is presented which suggest the strategic long term decisions that will yield the highest profit for a given planning period. It can be used to evaluate contracts up against each other and find the best mix of COAs and spot contracts for a given fleet, find the optimal fleet size & mix for a set of contracts or a mix of both. In that way it is a very flexible model that can be adapted to fit different scenarios, ranging from small fleets to the larger ones. The model can be used as a basis for a fleet renewal program, helping to decide when to sell and whether to buy old or new ships. It also takes into consideration the time charter market, recommending when to charter in vessels and when <b>to</b> <b>charter</b> <b>out.</b> Another area of application is for users that only are engaged in active vessel trading and not in transportation. A fictional case is used to illustrate how the model can be used to help the management in a shipping company evaluate different strategies. Limitations related to the model and the uncertainties connected to using forecast data is discussed in the thesis...|$|E
