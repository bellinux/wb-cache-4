5|$|As the {{prestige}} of winning the Cup grew, so did the need to attract top players. Only nine months after winning the Cup, in March 1906, the Montreal Wanderers pushed through a resolution at <b>the</b> <b>annual</b> <b>meeting</b> of the Eastern Canada Amateur Hockey Association (ECAHA) that would allow professional players to play alongside amateurs. Because the ECAHA was the top hockey league in Canada at the time, the Cup trustees agreed to open the challenges to professional teams.

If obstetrics were seen as dignified work that could draw more than the menial fees charged by midwives, DeLee said, many young physicians would be willing to deliver the patients that were then under the care of midwives.|$|E

5|$|In August and September 1940 the Congress became {{split between}} Ansar and Khatmiyya supporters. At first the Ansar were dominant, but they lost this {{position}} {{by the end}} of 1942. Many of Abd al-Rahman's supporters saw him as a source of financial backing and admired his advocacy of an independent Sudan, but did not follow him as a religious leader and were not members of the Ansar movement. By the end of 1942 the government had decided the Congress had no political value. The Mahdists had split into rival camps, other factions had emerged, and the attendees at <b>the</b> <b>annual</b> <b>meeting</b> of the Congress included artisans, merchants and illiterates.|$|E
5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the report, Hordaland County Municipality demanded an extraordinary annual meeting be held in February, in which chairman Harry Herstad was replaced. Pål Kårbø was elected new chairman. At the same time <b>the</b> <b>annual</b> <b>meeting</b> demanded that the company withdraw from its various tasks related to establishing toll projects on Bølmo and Halsnøy as well as administrative work of the Norwegian Road Financing Companies Association. In a 2007 report from the Public Roads Administration, SBT was one of seven toll companies which was criticized for too high administration costs. The toll changed the operator of the toll plaza from Bru- og Tunnelselskapet to Vegamot in 2010. The same year the toll plaza had 1,910,280 passing vehicles and a revenue of NOK142 million. This made it the ninth-largest toll road in Norway by revenue. The toll collection was scheduled to be completed on 30 April 2013.|$|E

5|$|In 1991, Fosen Trafikklag {{purchased}} Inderøy Municipality's {{shares in}} Innherredferja, while Verran Sparebank bought those previously owned by Mosvik Municipality. In its {{last year of}} operation, the Skarnsund service carried 267,894 people, 108,482 cars, 13,878 trucks, 840 buses and 312 motorcycles. Skarnsund II was sold to Namsos Trafikkselskap for NOK23,357,778. In 1992, <b>the</b> <b>annual</b> <b>meeting</b> had to be postponed due to a ferry strike, which prevented the shareholders from Ytterøy attending. Levanger Municipality and Nord-Trøndelag County Municipality were the only remaining public shareholders, and in 1992 Levanger announced that they intended to sell the Trondheim-based ferry operator Fosen Trafikklag. However, the politicians changed their mind, and the municipality remained as a shareholder. In 1994, both ferries were out of service and a small passenger ferry was used for a few days. In 1996, the company was again hit by a strike. Normally the service was not chosen {{to be subject to}} strikes due to the high regularity needed by the chicken manufacturer Trønderkylling, who would otherwise have to proceed with unnecessary slaughtering of animals. In 1997, a cooperation with Fosen Trafikklag started, including the two using a shared reserve ferry, Austråt.|$|E
5|$|Windsor Castle, {{part of the}} Occupied Royal Palaces Estate, {{is owned}} by Queen ElizabethII in right of the Crown, and day-to-day {{management}} is by the Royal Household. In terms of population, Windsor Castle is the largest inhabited castle {{in the world and}} the longest-occupied palace in Europe, but it also remains a functioning royal home. As of 2006, around 500 people were living and working in the castle. The Queen has increasingly used the castle as a royal palace as well as her weekend home and it is now as often used for state banquets and official entertaining as Buckingham Palace. In recent years, Windsor Castle has hosted visits from President Mbeki of South Africa, King Abdullah II of Jordan and President Obama of the United States. The castle remains an important ceremonial location. The Waterloo ceremony is carried out in the presence of the Queen each year, and the annual ceremony of the Order of the Garter takes place in St George's Chapel. While the Queen is in residence, the Guard Mounting ceremony occurs on a daily basis. The Royal Ascot procession leaves the castle each year during <b>the</b> <b>annual</b> <b>meeting.</b>|$|E
5|$|Shamrock Rovers F.C. is a members' club {{owned by}} the Shamrock Rovers Members Club. The Shamrock Rovers Members Club was {{originally}} formed as the 400 Club in November 2002, by the then privately owned football club's board of directors, to raise funds through the fan base, with {{the sole purpose of}} facilitating a mortgage {{for the development of the}} stalled stadium project in Tallaght. The monthly membership fee was set at €40. However, it became apparent to the members that the funds raised were being used for purposes outside of the stated objective. As a result, the membership took control of the 400 Club, adopted a transparent structure and constitution, and declared itself totally independent of the then board of Shamrock Rovers. The 400 Club consortium played a crucial role in the survival of Shamrock Rovers when the club entered examinership in April 2005. They paid off a portion of the club's debts and assumed responsibility for running it. After the successful acquisition of the club through the examinership process, the 400 Club Trustees became the Board of Directors of Shamrock Rovers Football Club and began the process of building a sustainable club through sensible business practices. Numerous clubs and supporters groups subsequently sought their advice with regard to using the model of the 400 club elsewhere. At <b>the</b> <b>annual</b> <b>meeting</b> of the 400 Club in 2006, the members voted to rename it as the SRFC Members Club, reflecting the reality of their ownership of the football club. At the 2008 meeting, the monthly membership fee was increased to €50. In January 2012, there were more than 400 members of the club. Membership is open to all.|$|E
