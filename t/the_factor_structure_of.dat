40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare <b>the</b> <b>factor</b> <b>structures</b> and means for moth-ering and fathering, as retrospectively perceived by young adult children. Three dimensions of perceived parenting were examined: nurturance, reported involvement, and desired involvement. We used the existing Nurturant Fa-thering and Father Involvement Scales, and the newly developed parallel Nur-turant Mothering and Mother Involvement Scales. Confirmatory factor analyses indicated that <b>the</b> originally validated <b>factor</b> <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> father-ing measures fit the data well and that <b>the</b> <b>factor</b> <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> paternal and maternal nurturance and involvement were isomorphic. These scales appear to index parenting functions that generalize across mothers and fathers. Mean-difference analyses indicated that fathers were significantly less involved than mothers in all of the domains surveyed except providing income, and that the patterns of means for fathers (but not for mothers) were highly consistent with the seminal work of Parsons and Bales. Implications for the study of parent-ing are discussed...|$|R

40|$|The {{patterns}} pf differences (Sex, Religion, Social Class and Education Level) {{in actual}} and ideal self concepts were compared between Korean and New Zealand young adults aged 16 - 24 attending {{high school or}} university. <b>The</b> <b>factor</b> <b>structures</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> both actual and ideal self concepts and the subjective changes (Past, Present and Future) in self concepts of these subjects were also studied and compared.

50|$|This {{technique}} is frequently applied when analysing items on self-report instruments such as personality tests and surveys that often use rating scales {{with a small}} number of response options (e.g., strongly disagree to strongly agree).

Lee, Poon & Bentler (1995) have recommended a two-step approach to factor analysis for assessing <b>the</b> <b>factor</b> <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> tests involving ordinally measured items. This aims to reduce the effect of statistical artifacts, such as the number of response scales or skewness of variables leading to items grouping together in factors.|$|E

It includes visual: information perceived through seeing; auditory: information perceived through hearing; and kinesthetic: information perceived through one's own physical actions.

5000|$|Because the NPI was {{originally}} based on DSM criteria for NPD, {{there has been}} much research on its factor structure.

Since then, several studies have further examined <b>the</b> <b>factor</b> <b>structure</b> <b>of</b> the NPI with varying results.

After controlling for the effects of common method variance, a number of the subdimensions of transformational leadership demonstrated significant unique relationships with a range of outcomes.
