On 9 July 2011, South Sudan became an independent state, with Kiir as its first president. Kiir positioned himself as a reformer, using his inaugural address to call for the South Sudanese people [...] "to forgive, though we shall not forget" [...] perceived injustices {{at the hands of}} the northern Sudanese over the preceding decades and announce a general amnesty for South Sudanese groups that had warred against the SPLM in <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> A <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> later, he publicly addressed members of the military and police to warn them that rape, torture, and other human rights violations carried out by armed personnel would be considered criminal acts and prosecuted aggressively by the Ministry of Justice. His presidency was characterized as a period of reconstruction, albeit one marred by with internal and foreign disputes. Among these were the Heglig Crisis, which caused a border war with Sudan, and an internal political crisis in which attempts were made to overthrow him.|$|R
2500|$|While Clinton {{recognized}} some of {{the contradictions}} of U.S. policy towards turmoil in the Mideast countries, which involving backing some regimes while supporting protesters against others, she was nevertheless passionate on the subject, enough so that Obama joked at the annual Gridiron Dinner that [...] "I've dispatched Hillary to the Middle East {{to talk about how}} these countries can transition to new leadersâ€”though, I've got to be honest, she's gotten a little passionate about <b>the</b> subject.

60|$|In {{these times}} of {{electrical}} movement, {{the sort of}} construction in the moral world for which ages were once needed, takes place almost simultaneously with the event to be adjusted in history, and as true a perspective forms itself as any in <b>the</b> <b>past.</b> A <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> after <b>the</b> death of a poet of such great epical imagination, such great ethical force, as Emile Zola, we may see him as clearly and judge him as fairly as posterity alone was formerly supposed able to see and to judge the heroes that antedated it. The present is always holding in solution {{the elements of the}} future and <b>the</b> <b>past,</b> in fact; and whilst Zola still lived, in the moments of his highest activity, the love and hate, the intelligence and ignorance, of his motives and his work were as evident, and were as accurately the measure of progressive and retrogressive criticism, as they will be hereafter in any of the literary periods to come. There will never be criticism to appreciate him more justly, to depreciate him more unjustly, than that of his immediate contemporaries. There will never be a day when criticism will be of one mind about him, when he will no longer be a question, and will have become a conclusion. A conclusion is an accomplished fact, something finally ended, something dead; and the extraordinary vitality of Zola, when he was doing the things most characteristic of him, forbids the notion of this in his case. Like every man who embodies an ideal, his individuality partook of what was imperishable in that ideal. Because he believed with his whole soul that fiction should be the representation, and in no measure the misrepresentation, of life, he will live as long as any history of literature survives. He will live as a question, a dispute, an affair of inextinguishable debate; for the two principles of the human mind, the love of the natural and the love of the unnatural, the real and the unreal, the truthful and the fanciful, are inalienable and indestructible.|$|R

40|$|Each year, {{hundreds}} of first year students {{head to the}} Lincoln University campus to embark on university study. Many of them, however, do not continue <b>past</b> <b>the</b> first <b>few</b> <b>weeks.</b> When students decide to leave university without completing their degree, they {{become one of the}} growing attrition statistics. Attrition represents a significant cost to both the institution and the student. With universities becoming more dependent on student contributions, due to decreased government funding and an increasingly competitive tertiary education market, attrition has become a major issue for New Zealand institutions. It is widely accepted that most attrition occurs in the first year; therefore, to understand attrition, an understanding of the first year experience at university is required. This study sought to examine the first year experience of undergraduate students at Lincoln University. A total of twenty-three, in depth, qualitative interviews were conducted with first year students. Five students, who had been interviewed for a previous study while in their first year, were re-interviewed in their last year of university. Of the twenty-three students, twenty-one were still studying at Lincoln, while one student had transferred to another university and one student had left the university system altogether. Results {{of this study indicate that}} one of the key factors in the retention of first year students at Lincoln is the acknowledgement that there are at least three distinct groups of students: school leavers; gap students; mature students. These three groups arrive at Lincoln with different experiences of a number of preparatory factors such as prior academic experience, family and social background and perceptions of personal ability. It is during their first year that students have their initial experiences of interacting with various aspects of the university setting - the environment, the people and the institutional systems. The two major facets of interaction identified in this study can be categorised as social and academic. It was found that each group of students encountered these aspects of the university setting in quite different ways which gave rise to quite distinct first year experiences. It emerged that these different groups of students require support for the different facets of the experience (for example, academic and social) at different times, for different reasons if the overall experience is to be positive. This support may be found through the students' existing support networks, but it can also provide the foundations for specific retention strategies. Finally, suggestions were made for future research...|$|R
