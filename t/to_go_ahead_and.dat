5|$|The {{winds of}} Donna {{can be seen}} in the feature film Blast of Silence (1961); a fist fight scene on Long Island had been {{previously}} scheduled, and the filmmakers decided <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> shoot the exterior scene despite the hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Troilus, however, {{after he}} had learned of his father's {{intention}} <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> release Briseida and restore her to the Greeks, was overwhelmed and completely wracked by great grief, and almost entirely consumed by tears, anguished sighs, and laments, because he cherished her with the great fervour of youthful love and had been led by the excessive ardour of love into the intense longing of blazing passion. There was no one of his dear ones who could console him.|$|E
5|$|Mulder later tells Scully that {{he wants}} to reveal the {{conspiracy}} to the public. As he is leaving, he meets with The Smoking Man who tells him that he can cure Scully's cancer by using a chip included in the vial Mulder took from the Pentagon. Meanwhile, Kritschgau goes before the FBI panel, denying any knowledge of Ostelhoff's murderer, also revealing that his son died that morning. Kritschgau claims to work for not only the Department of Defense but also a congressional lobbying firm known as Roush. Mulder sees Scully and her doctor about the chip. Scully's family is skeptical, particularly her brother Bill, who is quite upset with Mulder. Scully decides <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> have the chip inserted in her neck.|$|E
50|$|He {{moved on}} <b>to</b> <b>Go</b> <b>Ahead</b> Eagles <b>and</b> Club Brugge before rejoining Twente in the 1982/1983 season, {{but he could}} not save them from relegation that year. After 5 rounds in the 1988/1989 season Kohn became the {{responsible}} manager at Ajax, his assistant being Louis van Gaal.|$|R
60|$|Merlin, who {{all along}} {{had meant to}} return to the house, took his {{opportunity}} now. He allowed Déroulède and the two men <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on <b>ahead,</b> <b>and</b> beat a hasty retreat back into the house, followed by the jeers of the women.|$|R

King was told <b>to</b> not <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> agree <b>to</b> Kennedy's offer by Southern Christian Leadership Conference members, who told her about his presidential ambitions. She ignored the {{warnings}} and went along with his request.|$|R
5|$|Dusten Brown is {{a member}} of the Cherokee Nation. Brown served in the United States Army at Fort Sill, Oklahoma. Christina Maldonado was a non-Indian single mother of two. Brown and Maldonado became engaged to be married in December 2008, and Maldonado {{informed}} Brown that she was pregnant in January 2009. On learning that Maldonado was pregnant, Brown began to press her <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> marry him, and refused to provide any financial support until after the two had married. In May 2009, Maldonado broke off the engagement by text message and cut all communications with Brown. In June, Maldonado sent Brown a text message asking if he would rather pay child support or relinquish his parental rights. Brown responded via text message that he relinquished his rights. No child support order was in place at this time. Furthermore, while laws vary from state to state, it is generally impossible for any parent, male or female, to surrender their parental rights without a court hearing that determines the best interest of the child. A father cannot terminate his parental rights by contract, much less by more informal means (such as by text message).|$|E
5|$|Leading up to Turning Point 2007, TNA {{officials}} {{began to}} suspect Scott Hall would not {{show up at the}} event, as the last contact with him prior to the event was earlier that morning. TNA officials soon received word from Hall that he was suffering from food poisoning and {{would not be able to}} attend. As a result of the no-show, officials approached Samoa Joe and asked him to help take blame off the company for Hall's no-show and to help promote talent in TNA by giving an announcement before introducing Eric Young as Hall's replacement. Joe's announcement went five minutes longer than originally planned, which upset several individuals in TNA. At one point during his announcement, he asked a person off-screen if they were angry and <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> fire him, as he did not care; this individual was the legitimate president of TNA, Dixie Carter. After the event went off the air, a heated exchange between Kevin Nash and Joe took place backstage. The next night, TNA held a meeting and announced that anyone unhappy with their job could void their contract with the company. Senshi was the only one who wished to void his contract. During the meeting, Joe apologized for his actions at the event.|$|E
25|$|With Roger Ramey {{waiting in}} his office, Brown took {{the tape to}} Jimmy Bowen, President of MCA Nashville at the time. Hearing the tape, Bowen wasn't {{impressed}} with Loveless, but told Brown <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> sign her, but only to a short-term, singles-only recording contract.|$|E
50|$|Python style {{calls for}} the use of {{exceptions}} whenever an error condition might arise. Rather than testing for access to a file or resource before actually using it, it is conventional in Python <b>to</b> just <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> try <b>to</b> use it, catching the exception if access is rejected.|$|R

50|$|A deal is {{made that}} Dima must be sent onto London first via helicopter, {{with his family}} to follow once the account {{information}} he has memorised has been verified. The attack at the safe house and his wife's insistence convinces Dima <b>to</b> <b>go</b> on <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> Perry volunteers to accompany him.|$|R
25|$|On race day {{the weather}} was very wet with fog and running water at several places on the track. There were intense debates {{as to whether the}} race should be started; in the end the organisers decided <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> a {{majority}} of drivers did not disagree. Some drivers, including Lauda, were not happy with the decision.|$|E
25|$|In May 1982 the Holgate Labor {{government}} {{was defeated by}} the strongly pro-dam Liberal Party under Robin Gray. The new Premier immediately ordered the original plan <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> passed the necessary legislation. Gray attempted to dissuade the federal government from intervening by threatening to secede from the Commonwealth if they did so. The federal government initially declined {{to intervene in the}} dispute.|$|E
25|$|This might ordinarily {{have been}} the end of the line for the F-104A. However, delays in the {{delivery}} and development of the Convair F-106A Delta Dart Mach 2+ fighter-interceptor for ADC Command had at that time become worrisome, and the USAF decided <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> accept the F-104As originally destined for the TAC and assign them to the ADC as a stopgap measure.|$|E
500|$|... “If {{they want}} <b>to</b> be independent, <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> form your own party," [...] Berrios said in 2014, {{referring}} to candidates in Democratic primaries running {{without benefit of}} slating by the Cook County Democratic Party.|$|R

5000|$|Soon {{after the}} war had started the U.S. had imposed an embargo on {{military}} aid on both India and Pakistan. This embargo {{did not affect the}} Indian Army but produced major changes in the Pakistan Army's technical composition. US Secretary of State Dean Rusk well summed it up when he said, [...] "Well if you are going <b>to</b> fight, <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> fight, but we’re not going to pay for it".|$|R
25|$|In 1971, BCA President S. K. Wankhede {{was told}} by the then CCI President, Vijay Merchant that the BCA would not be allotted any extra seats for the visit of England in 1972. CCI {{maintained}} that it spends a large amount in maintaining the ground and any further concessions would lead to substantial loss of revenue to the club. BCA decided <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> construct a new ground of its own. The new Wankhede Stadium hosted its first Test match early in 1975 during the tour of West Indies. Wankhede had superseded Brabourne as the city's international cricket venue. Since then, except for a few first class matches, Brabourne staged few major games until 2006, though international cricket briefly returned to the ground in 1989, when Australia and Pakistan played an ODI against each other.|$|E
25|$|At 1030 {{hours on}} the morning of 24 November Seneca hailed Tomoka in {{latitude}} 40° 21.6' North, longitude 73° 49.7' West and ordered her to heave to and be prepared to be boarded and examined. A surfboat with an armed boarding party in charge of Lieutenant L. W. Perkins was sent to go on board and take charge of the vessel. At first Tomoka broke out the British flag and cruised about so that the boarding party would not overtake her. Seneca called her gun crews to quarters, cast loose the number one gun, and then ordered Tomoka to permit the boat to board. The master then complied. At 12:00 the boarding officer reported that he was all right and requested the Seneca <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> he would follow with Tomoka. Seneca shaped a course for the Ambrose Channel lightship, but by 12:30 Tomoka had still not started to follow. Heading back for the rum-runner Seneca was met by her boarding party, which had been chased off Tomoka with a machinegun.|$|E
25|$|During the Korean War, a Chinese army {{offensive}} {{broke through}} the UN lines in January 1951 and was rapidly advancing south. The South Korean army was ordered to burn all of the buildings in the Odae Mountains in order to deny shelter to the advancing Chinese troops. WolJeong Temple could be seen burning when a squad of South Korean soldiers arrived at Sangwon Temple. Explaining their mission, they ordered everyone to pack what they could and leave immediately. Instead, Hanam Sunim returned to the Dharma Hall, put on his formal robe, and, sitting down, told the lieutenant <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> burn the buildings. Hanam Sunim then told the lieutenant that his since {{his job was to}} stay with the temple, and the lieutenant's was to burn it, there would be no conflict(or bad karma) because they were both just doing their job. The lieutenant couldn't get Hanam Sunim to leave, and so at great risk to himself (for disobeying orders in wartime) he instead piled all of the wooden doors and window shutters in the courtyard and burned those instead. In this way, Sangwon Temple {{was one of the few}} temples in this area to survive the war.|$|E

5000|$|Bholu is {{presented}} as a train guard, and he holds a signal lamp with green light in one hand. The green light is the symbol of movement, which assures trains <b>and</b> passengers <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> with safety <b>and</b> without fear.|$|R
5000|$|The {{upgrades}} <b>to</b> Astron <b>went</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> started {{operation in}} 1969. During this period, following {{the advice of}} the Panel, the theoretical divisions at LLNL started taking a much more serious look at the concept. Building computer models of the system, they first attacked the problem of [...] "stacking", that individual pulses of electrons from the accelerator did not build up in the E-layer as expected. Bruce Langdon demonstrated that stacking simply would not work.|$|R
500|$|Bassist Montano {{was asked}} to leave Hellyeah after the album's release party, where he {{assaulted}} guitarist Tom Maxwell and made numerous gun threats while heavily intoxicated. The band's publicist stated his departure was due to [...] "personal reasons on both sides" [...] The band considered Damageplan bassist Bob Zilla as Paul thought; [...] "It was kind hard <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> commit to this band without Bob being part of it". Zilla was invited to audition and got the gig immediately.|$|E
500|$|Filmmaker Karan Johar {{named it}} as the one film that changed his life. He said, [...] "After seeing Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! I {{realized}} Indian cinema is about values, tradition, subtlety, romance. There is so much soul in it. [...] I decided <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> be a filmmaker only after watching this film." [...] Hum Aapke Hain Koun..! belongs to a small collection of films, including Kismet (1943), Mother India (1957), Mughal-e-Azam (1960) and Sholay (1975), which are repeatedly watched throughout India and are viewed as definitive Hindi films with cultural significance.|$|E
500|$|At {{administration}} meetings, Kissinger voiced {{the concern}} that the North would see the U.S. as [...] "the paper tigers of Saigon" [...] {{if they did not}} respond, and Ford agreed with that assessment. After mulling various options the Ford administration decided that it was necessary to respond with a major show of force. A large number of ground forces went to cut down the tree, {{while at the same time}} the air force was deployed, which included B-52 bomber flights over Panmunjom. The North Korean government backed down and allowed the tree-cutting <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead,</b> <b>and</b> later issued an unprecedented official apology.|$|E
5000|$|Meggett was {{recruited}} by Notre Dame, Virginia, and Rutgers, but Maryland {{was the only}} Division I FBS school to offer him a scholarship. He also received scholarship offers from Division I FCS programs , Old Dominion, and James Madison. Meggett, who grew up a Maryland fan, accepted the school's offer and later said, [...] "This is a dream. Is this really happening? ... I'm going <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead,</b> commit <b>and</b> live out a fantasy." ...|$|R

After the season at Telstar he returned to Deventer and became a first team regular for <b>Go</b> <b>Ahead</b> Eagles again for three more seasons. In 1985, he switched to SC Heracles where he ended his professional career as a player.|$|R
50|$|Top-posting can be {{problematic}} on mailing lists with ongoing discussions which eventually require someone {{to act on}} the top-posted material. For example, top-posting &ldquo;Those changes look ok <b>to</b> me, <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> make them&rdquo; can be very inconvenient for the person who needs to make the changes if he or she has to read through a long email trail to know which changes the top-poster is referring to. Inter-leaving the text directly below the text describing the changes is much more convenient in these cases.|$|R
500|$|Gernsback {{had started}} another {{magazine}} called Practical Electrics in 1921. In 1924, he {{changed its name}} to The Experimenter, and sent a letter to 25,000 people to gauge interest in the possibility of a magazine devoted to scientific fiction; in his words, [...] "the response was such that the idea was given up for two years." [...] However, in 1926 he decided <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead,</b> <b>and</b> ceased publication of The Experimenter to make room in his publishing schedule for a new magazine. The editor of The Experimenter, T. O'Conor Sloane, became the editor of Amazing Stories. The first issue appeared on 10 March 1926, with a cover date of April 1926.|$|E

[...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic believed that the documentary served its purpose well.

500|$|For the Astral Weeks sessions, {{apparently}} {{they did not}} employ any lead sheets, or at least none were distributed to the musicians.

[...] "We were used to playing to charts, but Van just played us the songs on his guitar and then told us <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>ahead</b> <b>and</b> play exactly what we felt." [...] Berliner actually had great appreciation for the freedom given to him and the band; something few, if any, of them were used to. [...] "I played a lot of classical guitar on those sessions and it was very unusual to play classical guitar in that context," [...] says Berliner.|$|E
