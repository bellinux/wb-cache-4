40|$|The {{pervasiveness of}} {{research}} agreements between pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies is puzzling, {{since it is}} hard to contract on the exact nature of the research activities. A major concern of financing companies is that the R&D firms use their funding to subsidize other projects or substitute one project for another. We develop a model based on the property-rights theory of the firm that allows for researchers in the R&D firms to pursue multiple tasks. When research activities are non-contractible, we show that it is optimal for the financing company to obtain the option right to terminate the research agreement while maintaining the property rights to the terminated project. This right will induce the biotechnology firm researchers not to deviate from the proposed research activities. The contract prevents opportunistic exercise of this <b>termination</b> <b>right</b> by conditioning payments on the termination of the agreement. We test the model empirically using a new data set on 584 biotechnology research agreements.

We employ further empirical tests to distinguish the property-rights explanation from alternative stories, based on uncertainty and asymmetric information about the project quality or research abilities...|$|E
40|$|Although {{compensation}} is the governing principle in contract law remedies, it has tenuous historical, economic, and empirical support. A promisor's right to breach and pay damages {{is only a}} subset of a larger family of <b>termination</b> <b>rights</b> that do not purport to compensate the promisee for losses suffered when the promisor walks away from the contemplated exchange. These <b>termination</b> <b>rights</b> {{can be characterized as}} embedded options that serve important risk management functions. We show that sellers often sell insurance to their buyers in the form of these embedded call options, and that termination fees, including damages, are in essence option prices. Furthermore, we explain why {{compensation is}} of little relevance to the option price agreed to by the parties, which {{is a function of the}} option's value to the buyer, its cost to the seller, and the market in which they transact. We propose, therefore, a novel justification for why penalty liquidated damages may be higher than the seller's costs: They are option prices that reflect the value of the options to the buyer. The regulation of liquidated damages is thus tantamount to price regulation [...] a function outside the realm of contract law. Moreover, in light of the generosity among optimal option prices, this Article also makes the case against the expectation damages default rule. In thick markets, we argue for enforcing the parties' risk allocation with market damages. In thin markets, we propose the default rule should encourage parties to agree explicitly to <b>termination</b> <b>rights,</b> including break damages, by the threat of specific performance of their contemplation exchange or, in the case of consumers, by a default rule that provides them a termination option at no cost...|$|R

40|$|Copyright law gives a {{deceased}} author’s surviving spouse {{the right to}} terminate a transfer of copyright rights that the author made decades earlier. The spouse who recovers the author’s rights can, in many instances, negotiate a new transfer on more favorable terms. Because the statute grants this <b>termination</b> <b>right</b> to {{a deceased}} author’s widow or widower, copyright law must determine who qualifies as the author’s spouse, a question more familiar to family law than copyright law. Copyright’s termination provisions, from their enactment in 1978, have treated gay and lesbian authors with same-sex partners less favorably than authors with different-sex partners. The statute’s facially neutral language has, in practice, always treated authors with same-sex partners unequally because its marriage recognition rule has incorporated by reference unequal treatment of those couples by state and federal law. This unequal treatment has evolved over time, as some states allowed same-sex couples to marry, as Congress enacted the so-called Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), and as the Supreme Court struck down DOMA’s federal marriage recognition provisions in Windsor v. United States. But even after Windsor, copyright law still treats gay and lesbian couples unequally, so that an author with a same-sex spouse must be careful where she lives when she dies - if she is domiciled {{in a state that}} does not recognize her marriage, then copyright law will not recognize her surviving spouse. The Supreme Court’s decision later this year in Obergefell v. Hodges, challenging state prohibitions on marrying same-sex couples, could perpetuate, reduce, or largely eliminate copyright law’s remaining inequality. But even the most favorable Court decision for marriage equality would leave copyright law’s unequal treatment in place for authors - American and foreign - who live in most other countries in the world, as long as copyright’s statutory marriage recognition rule remains unchanged...|$|E

40|$|The credit {{crisis of}} 2008 and the {{subsequent}} collapse {{of a number of}} high-profile acquisition transactions put a spotlight on contracting practices that embedded optionality into merger agreements by way of the reverse termination fee and its attendant triggers. This article examines whether reverse termination fees are a symmetrical response to the seller 2 ̆ 7 s judicially mandated fiduciary <b>termination</b> <b>right</b> and whether such fees represent an efficient transactional term. A series of Delaware cases over the last decade limited the degree to which buyers could rely on deal protection measures in merger agreements to prevent a seller from accepting a superior second bid resulting in a judicially-created fiduciary put. Where courts require seller termination rights, it is possible that buyers might attempt to negotiate symmetrical 2 ̆ 2 optionality 2 ̆ 2 for buyers elsewhere in the merger agreement. This article investigates whether the termination triggers that accompany reverse termination fees are that symmetrical response. Using a sample of 644 acquisitions from 2003 through 2008, which includes 105 transactions where strategic buyers negotiated a reverse termination fee, this article provides an empirical account of the use of reverse termination fees by strategic buyers, including the first taxonomy of reverse termination fee triggers. This article concludes first that reverse termination fee triggers are not a symmetrical response to the judicially mandated seller 2 ̆ 7 s fiduciary termination rights. Second, to the extent reverse termination rights mimic termination rights in size, they may be inefficient terms. The results of this study provide some guidance to courts as they are asked to assess the viability of reverse termination fees and the degree of optionality embedded in the modern merger agreement...|$|E
40|$|AbstractImplantable defibrillators use {{algorithms}} {{based on}} ventricular electrographic data {{to detect the}} onset and termination of arrhythmias, but these algorithms do not always differentiate hemodynamically stable from unstable arrhythmias. Although, ideally, left ventricular function {{should be used to}} assess the hemodynamic state, right ventricular pulse pressure can be assessed in humans on a long-term basis with a transvenous lead. The potential utility of right ventricular pulse pressure to assess hemodynamic stability was studied in 22 patients with induced ventricular arrhythmias. Right ventricular pressure was measured with use of a transvenous right ventricular endocardial pacing lead with a piezoelectric bender pressure sensor 3 cm from its tip. Single ventricular premature paced beats administered in up to a bigeminal frequency did not alter the mean right ventricular pulse pressure (control 33. 7 ± 26, bigeminy 35. 7 ± 26 mm Hg) :Twenty-one episodes of induced ventricular tachycardia were studied in the electrophysiology laboratory. Five seconds after tachycardia induction, hemodynamically stable ventricular tachycardia had a longer cycle length (294 ± 41 ms) and the right ventricular pulse pressure ratio was higher (0. 55 ± 0. 26) than that in unstable ventricular tachycardia (cycle length 256 ± 55 ms, p = 0. 06; pulse pressure ratio 0. 26 ± 0. 09, p < 0. 05). Twenty episodes of ventricular fibrillation were induced in eight patients. One second after induction, right ventricular pulse pressure decreased from 25 ± 5 to 6 ± 3 mm Hg (p < 0. 05). On the first beat after defibrillation, right ventricular pulse pressure increased to 24 ± 14 mm Hg, a level not significantly different from that before the induction of ventricular fibrillation. This rapid decrease of right ventricular pulse pressure during ventricular fibrillation and immediate recovery after defibrillation is useful for detecting ventricular fibrillation onset and <b>termination.</b> <b>Right</b> ventricular pulse pressure can differentiate hemodynamically stable from unstable ventricular tachycardia.

40|$|The 1976 Copyright Act’s {{provisions}} on {{termination of}} transfers give authors or their statutory successors {{a mechanism to}} recapture copyright rights that the author previously transferred to a third party. The statute and its implementing regulations outline a relatively complex set of formalities that must be complied with in order to effect a termination. In this article, I examine two different kinds of notice issues related to these formalities. The first issue concerns whether the statute and regulations give adequate notice to a potential terminating party regarding termination formalities. That is, how well do the statute and the regulations tell someone who might wish to terminate a grant precisely {{how to go about}} doing so? This is primarily an issue of statutory and regulatory clarity and workability. The current statutory termination provisions in some respects fail to provide clear and understandable notice to authors (and their statutory successors) of how to fulfill the formalities necessary to effect a termination. Some of this notice failure is due to poor statutory drafting that leaves those trying to use the provision uncertain of how it operates. Some of the failure arises because such a long time passes between the events that trigger termination’s availability and the start of the actual termination process. But the end result is that the statute’s complex formalities impose hurdles that can potentially stymie attempts to exercise the statute’s <b>termination</b> <b>right.</b> The second issue concerns how well the statutory scheme gives notice of a termination (and the consequent change of copyright ownership) both to those whose ownership of copyright rights is being terminated and to strangers to the terminated transaction who may wish to use the work involved. When a termination occurs and previously granted rights revert to the terminating party, how clearly does the termination system inform interested parties of the change of ownership? This issue primarily concerns whether the copyright system does a good job of putting grantees and their successors in title on notice of the termination of their ownership, and putting potential users of copyrighted works on notice of whom they should contact to get permission for their desired use...|$|E

In doing so, it questions the framework used to analyze parental <b>rights</b> <b>termination</b> decisions. Specifically, it questions the sharp line drawn between cases concerning <b>termination</b> of parental <b>rights</b> (in which parents have certain constitutional protections) and cases concerning child custody (in which parents lack those constitutional protections), noting that for indigent parents, an unfavorable decision on child custody can operate as a decision terminating parental rights.
