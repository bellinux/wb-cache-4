5000|$|After Efuru’s first publication, it {{received}} mixed reviews. For instance, Kenyan author Grace Ogot spoke positively {{of the novel}} in a review {{which appeared in the}} East Africa Journal in 1966, stating that “of the many novels <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> of Nigeria, Efuru {{is one of the few}} that portrays vividly the woman’s world, giving only peripheral treatment to the affairs of men.” Nwapa’s male counterparts, however, were not as fond of the book. Literary critic Eldred Jones and author Eustace Palmer both represent the opinion of some Nigerian male writers at the time, most of whom criticize Nwapa for focusing on the affairs of women. Later critics of Efuru, however, commend Nwapa for creating an image of female protagonists which is unlike that created by Nigerian male writers. Author Rose Acholonu describes Nwapa and certain other African female writers as “pathfinders”, who were able to “break the seals of silence and invisibility on the female protagonist by the early traditionalist male writers.” [...] Christine N. Ohale a professor at the department of English, Communications, Media Arts and Theater in Chicago State University mentions that Nwapa’s “efforts to present brand-new, assertive and individualistic females have helped to salvage the lop-sided image that male writers have created”, which is mainly one of passiveness.|$|E

Thus digital image processing {{can be used in}} this area mainly for the detection of faulted parts or missing part. Automated visual inspection is the key factor behind all the industrial application of digital image processing. The proposed project mainly deals with analysis to find faulty industrial parts and correcting it. Automated visual inspection uses digital camera that captures image which is coming out of product line. The captured image is then fed to computer for further processing. The typical image processing task is to find the faulty piece by comparing the user requirements and manufactured product image. This proposed idea will employ verification of measurements of all the pieces <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> of product line. Based on the error rate modification in the design can be pursued. This proposed idea increases the speed and accuracy and avoids human errors which are common in quality testing.

40|$|The {{creation}} of a Physical Union Catalogue constitutes a big technical challenge and simultaneously a challenge for the qualitative upgrade of the services provided by the Hellenic Academic Libraries. The qualitative upgrade consists of the unification of the existing electronic catalogues and the {{creation of}} an Interlibrary Lending System for the members of Hellenic Academic Libraries Network. The inhomogeneity of the information systems that we meet in the field of the Hellenic Academic Libraries constituted the most difficult issue in the implementation of Physical Union Catalogue. Nevertheless, the coordinated efforts of the Central Team of the Union Catalogue and the supporting firm have yielded important results. The experimental base of Collective List is currently consisted of 9 (out of 37) collections. The number of records exceeds the 450. 000 (as on 10 / 7 / 2005), and the prospect is to incorporate at least 20 libraries until the end of year with more than one million records originated from 5 different systems.

40|$|Federal welfare-to-work {{legislation}} (the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act of 1996 {{and related}} federal grants) and {{the anticipation of}} the consolidation of job training programs through the Workforce Investment Act of 1998 have created new relationships amongst local government, for-profit and non-profit sectors. Related shifts toward work-oriented programs in public housing (through the Quality Housing and Work Responsibility Act of 1998) and facilitation of work for those with disabilities (through the Ticket to Work and Work Incentives Improvement Act of 1999) are also involved in this transition. Together, the new public/private mix is expanding "job readiness" services, childcare, private-sector involvement in training of the low-wage labor force, and coordination of welfare, unemployment and reemployment initiatives. The reconfiguration {{also seems to be}} fundamentally bluffing the boundaries between traditionally male-based job training and unemployment insurance and traditionally female-based aid for families and related services. In addition to a blurring of the boundaries between male and female systems of aid, there seems at times to be an implicit recognition of the blurred boundaries between the working-poor and welfare recipients. This paper explores the work of several organizations in Boston that have received Department of Labor (F/S) Welfare-to-Work grants. While the Welfare-to- Work grants are a time-limited source of funding (established in 1998 and scheduled to end in FY 2001), they have served as a catalyst for organizational changes in ways that seem likely to be lasting and they seem to be paradigmatic of the sort of incentives and programs <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>coming</b> <b>out</b> of combined Health and Human Services and Department of Labor programming that seek to employ "hard-to-place" populations. By considering organizations that have received this funding and their relationships to city and state agencies, the for-profit sector, and other organizations in the not-for-profit sector, this paper creates a "map" of some of the important public and private institutions involved in the welfare-to-work transition in Boston. It also suggests the impacts of legislative changes on the evolving trajectories of individual organizations. by Dulcy Anderson. Thesis (M. C. P.)
