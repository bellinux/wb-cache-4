[...] and he generally tells me some lamentable case of failure. Then I ask, [...] "What are {{the circumstances of the}} case, and how was the teaching carried out?" [...] I remember, some few years ago, hearing of the head master of a large school, who had expressed great dissatisfaction with the adoption of the teaching of physical science--and that after experiment. But the experiment consisted in this--in asking one of the junior masters in the school to get up science, in order to teach it; and the young gentleman went away for a year and got up science and taught it. Well, I have no doubt that the result was as disappointing as the head-master said it was, and I have no doubt that it ought to have been as disappointing, and far more disappointing too; for, if this kind of instruction is to be of any good at all, if it is not to be less than no good, if it is {{to take the place of}} that which is already of some good, then there are several points which must be attended to.|$|E
50|$|In the English {{speaking}} world, {{the recognition}} of sport pedagogy as a discipline is more recent. In 1989, the notable German researcher Herbert Haag observed that {{the meaning of the}} term 'sport pedagogy' was not as yet fully established in the English speaking sport science literature. Nevertheless, Haag confirmed the ascendence and usefulness of the term 'sport pedagogy' to communicate about research in learning and <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> <b>physical</b> education and sport to international academic audiences in this field. The relatively late adoption of the term 'sport pedagogy' in the English speaking academic literature is also observed by the distinguished Australian researcher Richard Tinning (2008, p. 405) who notes that ‘notwithstanding the fact that our European colleagues had been using the terms pedagogy and sport pedagogy for many years, the English-speaking world of kinesiology has only relatively recently embraced the terms.’ Nonetheless, Tinning observes that sport pedagogy is now ‘firmly established as a credible academic subdiscipline’.|$|E

It explores issues arising from a case study investigation that sought to respond to the critical commentary about the form and substance of sport <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> <b>physical</b> education by supporting innovation in school curriculum and pedagogy through pre-service teacher education. The study was designed to challenge PETE pre-service teachers ’ thinking about sport curriculum and pedagogy in physical education, introduce them to new thinking about models and specifically, the sport literacy model (Drummond & Pill, 2011; Pill, 2009, 2010). Details of the research design are presented and the insights that the data have provided in relation to challenges and opportunities that teacher educators and teacher education courses confront in seeking to promote and support curriculum and pedagogical innovation are discussed...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of incorporating English language <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> <b>Physical</b> Sciences education. The sample was selected from Physical Sciences Grade 10 learners in a school in Mpumalanga Province and comprised an experimental group who were taught through a workbook that incorporated language teaching in science lessons and a control group who were taught via the normal textbook prescribed by the Department of Basic Education. Pre- and post-tests were administered to both groups and a sample of learners participated in a focus group interview. Two educators were also individually interviewed. The results revealed that incorporating language teaching in science lessons not only improves learners’ academic performance but also their comprehension skills, and encouraged the application of learner-centred methods of teaching. The study recommends that Physical Sciences textbooks include English language activities with the view of incorporating language <b>teaching</b> <b>in</b> <b>Physical</b> Sciences content lessons.

In this article we present the research we did in conducted at the six classes of graduates of <b>Teaching</b> <b>in</b> <b>Physical</b> Education from the University of Seville (N = 292).

Thus, we can conclude that most graduates of <b>Teaching</b> <b>in</b> <b>Physical</b> Education do not receive guidance for their incorporation into the labour world.

Special attention needs to be paid to preparation of lower-grade teachers 1 to perform physical education, bearing in mind the expected education reform process.
