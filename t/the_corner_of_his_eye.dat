500|$|Smith was {{involved}} in another incident that scared him to death. One day when he was flying his normal air mail route from Hadley Field to Cleveland, he caught something out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> {{that looked like a}} skyscraper. He pulled back on the control stick to [...] quickly gain altitude and just missed hitting the U.S. Navy airship USS Los Angeles that was in his direct path. It was a close call of just over a hundred feet.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} prevent {{possible}} injuries and be in peak condition for the film, Willis worked out almost daily for several months prior to filming. Willis was injured on January 24, 2007 during a fight scene, when he was kicked above his right eye by a stunt double for actress Maggie Q who was wearing stiletto heels. Willis described the event as [...] "no big deal" [...] but when Len Wiseman inspected his injury, {{he noticed that the}} situation was much more serious than previously thought—in the DVD commentary, Wiseman indicates in inspecting the wound that he could see bone. Willis was hospitalized and received seven stitches which ran through his right eyebrow and down into <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye.</b> Due to the film's non-linear production schedule, these stitches can accidentally be seen in the scene where McClane first delivers Farrell to Bowman.|$|E
500|$|Although Paul {{changed his}} ways to an extent, he still {{shows signs of}} being evil. Dennis has stated that he and fellow cast member, Alan Fletcher (Karl Kennedy) {{purposely}} portray hints of his former self. Of this Dennis stated: [...] "I like to keep that boiling under the surface so that the audience will always think 'what is he up to next?'. You never quite know if he will burst out into Mr. Evil or stay as the character {{he is at the}} moment. Alan Fletcher keeps it alive as well, by always looking out <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> and thinking 'I just don't trust you!'" [...] Dennis later defended his character to the Birmingham Post after he was branded an evil character, describing him in his early years: [...] "Paul started out as a university student, which people have forgotten, he was studying engineering then, much to his father's disgust, left to join an airline and became a trolley dolly. He later became a bit of a cad but I wouldn't call him a villain. I'd describe him as a bad boy with a conscience". Dennis has also stated that he loves playing Paul as a [...] "baddie", because in his opinion he is so colourful, not just an average bad guy, adding: [...] "He's not just a black and white bad guy, he's a sneaky bastard. He's the smiling baddie".|$|E

2500|$|Psychologist Richard Wiseman of the University of Hertfordshire {{suggests}} that the odd sensations that people attribute to ghosts {{may be caused by}} infrasonic vibrations. Vic Tandy, experimental officer and part-time lecturer in the school of international studies and law at Coventry University, along with Dr. Tony Lawrence of the University's psychology department, wrote in 1998 a paper called [...] "Ghosts in the Machine" [...] for the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research. Their research suggested that an infrasonic signal of 19Hz might be responsible for some ghost sightings. Tandy was working late one night alone in a supposedly haunted laboratory at Warwick, when he felt very anxious and could detect a grey blob out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye.</b> When Tandy turned to face the grey blob, there was nothing.|$|E
2500|$|Lucy is {{the common}} name of AL 288-1, several hundred pieces of bone {{representing}} about 40% of the skeleton of an individual Australopithecus afarensis. Lucy is reckoned to have lived 3.2 million years ago. This hominid was significant as the skeleton shows evidence of small skull capacity akin to that of apes and of bipedal upright walk akin to that of humans, providing further evidence that bipedalism preceded increase in brain size in human evolution. While working in collaboration with a joint French-British-American team, Lucy was discovered in Hadar, Ethiopia on November 24, 1974, when American paleoanthropologist Donald Johanson, coaxed away from his paperwork by graduate student Tom Gray for a spur-of-the-moment survey, caught the glint of a white fossilized bone out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> and recognized it as hominid. Later described as the first known member of Australopithecus afarensis. [...] Dr. Johanson's girlfriend suggested she be named [...] "Lucy" [...] after the Beatles' song [...] "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" [...] which was played repeatedly during {{the night of the}} discovery.|$|E
2500|$|... "The try Australia scored {{towards the}} end of the first half was relayed {{endlessly}} on television and, I predict, will be shown again and again in years to come. It was Lynagh, running towards the blind side, who set things in motion. Noticing that the New Zealand backs were lined up flat, he chipped the ball into the gap behind the winger. The New Zealand fullback, Kieran Crowley, was regarded by the Australians as being a little slow off the mark, and no doubt Lynagh had this in mind when he chose to kick in front of him. Campese was bearing down on the ball, and I think Crowley was undecided whether to go in for the ball or wait for the bounce and try to stop Campese. His slight hesitation gave Campese the fraction of a second he needed to scoop up the ball and flash past him. Campese's running then was superb. He drew two defenders and had a third one chasing him, all of whom thought he was a threat. Campese saw Tim Horan behind him out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye</b> and flipped the ball back over his shoulder. Horan did well to catch it before going on to score." ...|$|E

2500|$|Presenting {{his first}} gallery {{exhibition}} in 1978 as an “installation” {{rather than as}} a photography show, Wall placed The Destroyed Room in the storefront window of the Nova Gallery, enclosing it in a plasterboard wall.Mimic [...] (1982) typifies Wall's cinematographic style and according to art historian Michael Fried [...] "characteristic of Wall's engagement in his art of the 1980s with social issues". A 198 × 226cm. colour transparency, it shows a white couple and an Asian man walking towards the camera. The sidewalk, flanked by parked cars and residential and light-industrial buildings, suggests a North American industrial suburb. The woman is wearing red shorts and a white top displaying her midriff; her bearded, unkempt boyfriend wears a denim vest. The Asian man is casual but well-dressed in comparison, in a collared shirt and slacks. As the couple overtake the man, the boyfriend makes an ambiguous but apparently obscene and racist gesture, holding his upraised middle finger close to <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> [...] "slanting" [...] his eye in mockery of the Asian man's eyes. The picture resembles a candid shot that captures the moment and its implicit social tensions, but is actually a recreation of an exchange witnessed by the artist.|$|E
2500|$|Rosenthal piled {{stones and}} a sandbag {{so he had}} {{something}} on which to stand, as he was only 5 feet and 5inches (1.65m) tall. He set his camera for a lens setting between f/8 and f/11 and the shutter speed at 1/400th second. Then, out of <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye,</b> he saw six Marines start to raise the second flag. He swung his camera around toward the action and pushed the shutter. Three feet to his right, Sgt. Genaust captured the flag-raising from nearly the same angle using color motion picture film. To make sure he had a worthwhile photo to send to the AP, Rosenthal took another black and white photograph showing four of the second flag-raisers steadying the flagstaff waiting for {{the bottom of the}} pipe to be more secured with rocks; and afterwards a rope. When that was done, Rosenthal gathered a group of sixteen Marines and two Navy corpsmen {{around the base of the}} flagstaff for a posed shot (called the [...] "Gung Ho" [...] photo) which included First Lieutenant Harold Schrier, the only officer on the summit, who had volunteered to take the 40-man patrol up Mount Suribachi that morning to seize and occupy the crest and raise the battalion's flag.|$|E

6000|$|Mr. Jewell {{glanced at}} him from <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye.</b> [...] "Cooking," [...] he said, {{and put his hand}} over his mouth with some suddenness.|$|E
60|$|He {{kept her}} in <b>the</b> <b>corner</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> <b>eye.</b> She {{seemed to be}} {{thinking}} out some scathing retort, but ended by only shrugging her shoulders slightly.|$|E
60|$|Major Thomson paused. There was a queer twisted {{smile at}} <b>the</b> <b>corners</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> lips.|$|R
