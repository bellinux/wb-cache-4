3000|$|Despite these findings, {{we still}} have not a {{comprehensive}} understanding of what are the main properties of human interaction that make social ties to persist.

On the other hand, most studies infer tie decay from absence of <b>tie</b> <b>activity</b> in large databases [8, 12]. This is a potential problem since, given the large burstiness of human interaction [6, 16], large inactivity periods could be mistaken as tie decay events. Thus, although previous studies agree on the general importance of tie structural embeddedness, intensity or reciprocity to predict its future persistence [8, 12], they still provide an incomplete picture of what are the main properties that make ties persistent. As it was done in the problem of tie prediction, can we build efficient models based on endogenous properties of ties to predict if a social relationship is bound to decay? [...]...|$|R

50|$|Relationships {{are usually}} based on {{resource}} <b>ties,</b> <b>activity</b> links and/or actor bonds (Ford et al., 2006). A company should therefore analyze their firm itself, their relationships and their business networks {{in terms of}} activities, actors and resources. In this way, a company can determine where there are new opportunities for relationships and where resources, technologies and/or skills can be developed, integrated or exploited from other companies (Ford et al., 2006). In this way, business development can be established with help of this business network. Nowadays, marketing is about the exchange of heterogeneous resources between dynamic, cooperating partners in network-like structures (Hakansson et al., 2004). It is about relationships, not about selling products. So, business marketers should be busy finding, developing and managing of relationships within the complex network that surrounds them (Ford et al., 2006). Blois (2004) provides three ways in which a firm can evolve from market to network mechanism. These are entrepreneurial alertness (being alert to value-creating opportunities), path dependence (historical events cause solutions to problems and become “locked in”) and replaceability (irreplaceable contributors get much attention of others trying to influence them).|$|R

40|$|The {{role of the}} angiopoietin- 1 (Ang 1) –Tie 2 pathway in the {{pathogenesis}} of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is controversial. Although Ang 1 is well known to prevent endothelial activation and injury in systemic vascular beds, this pathway has been suggested to mediate pulmonary vascular remodeling in PAH. Therefore, we used transgenic models {{to determine the effect}} of increased or decreased <b>Tie</b> 2 <b>activity</b> on the development of PAH. We now report modest spontaneous elevation in right ventricular systolic pressure in Tie 2 -deficient mice (Tie 2 +/−) compared with wild-type (WT) littermate controls, which was exacerbated upon chronic exposure to the clinically relevant PAH triggers, serotonin (5 -HT) or interleukin- 6 (IL- 6). Moreover, overexpression of Ang 1 in transgenic mice had no deleterious effect on pulmonary hemodynamics and, if anything, blunted the response to 5 -HT. Exposure to 5 -HT or IL- 6 also decreased lung Ang 1 expression, further reducing <b>Tie</b> 2 <b>activity</b> and inducing pulmonary apoptosis in the Tie 2 +/− group only. Similarly, cultured pulmonary artery endothelial cells subjected to Tie 2 silencing demonstrated increased susceptibility to apoptosis after 5 -HT treatment. Finally, treatment of Tie 2 -deficient mice with Z-VAD, a pan-caspase inhibitor, prevented the pulmonary hypertensive response to 5 -HT. Thus, these findings firmly establish that endothelial survival signaling via the Ang 1 –Tie 2 pathway is protective in PAH...|$|R

30|$|In {{order to}} contextualize our study within the {{broader range of}} {{research}} on pastoral livelihoods, we have generated a conceptual framework that <b>ties</b> new <b>activities</b> to traditional ones in order to depict the current socio-ecological and economic conditions and practices of pastoral livelihoods in Laikipia, Kenya. Our framework thus identifies activities and linkages that illustrate the process of rapid internal social and economic differentiation via access to cash. Under these conditions of rapid differentiation, differences among households in wealth (livestock or otherwise) and social position act as a filter that bins households into quantitatively distinct sets of social, economic, and ecological opportunities and strategies.|$|R

30|$|Human {{behavior}} display {{very different}} temporal patterns due to many constrains like circadian rhythms, cognitive limits or finite capacity to perform tasks [1, 32]. Since {{most of those}} constrains are common to human nature, those patterns show also a large degree of universality across individuals. Interestingly, deviations from universal rhythms can inform us about changes of behavior related to, for example, unemployment [33], health conditions [34], or crowd events [35, 36]. Along this line, our research also shows that future network dynamics is encoded in the relative properties of the temporal patterns of communication between individuals and that those temporal properties have more predicting power than structural, intensity or intimacy features of the communication. Specifically, we find that if <b>tie</b> <b>activity</b> is not observed for more than 8 times its typical inter-event time, the tie has a great probability to decay, a result that indicates that each tie has a natural rhythm and that when communication is halted {{for a long time}} it will probably decay. More importantly, although recent research has found that burstiness affects a large number of human activities and some explanations have been given to explain its universality [16], our results show that relative burstiness could be also related to the weakness of ties and that those ties that show excessive burstiness might decay in the future. Since burstiness in ties slows down information spreading [6], we have found that more bursty ties are not only weaker to transmit information, but also they are more prone to disappear, making them extremely fragile for the structural and functional processes happening in social networks.|$|R
40|$|Leisure and entertainment-based {{computing}} {{has been}} traditionally associated with interactive entertainment media and game playing, yet {{the forms of}} engagement offered by these technologies only support {{a small part of}} how we act when we are at leisure. In this paper, we move away from the paradigm of leisure technology as computer-based entertainment consumption, and towards a broader view of leisure computing. This perspective is more in line with our everyday experience of leisure as an embodied, everyday accomplishment in which people artfully employ the everyday resources in the world around them in carrying out their daily lives outside of work. We develop this extended notion of leisure using data from a field study of domestic communication focusing on asynchronous and situated messaging to explore some of these issues, and develop these findings towards design implications for leisure technologies. Central to our discussion on the normal, everyday and occasioned conduct of leisure lie the notions of playfulness and creativity, the interweaving of the worlds of work and leisure, and in the creation of embodied displays of affect, all of which may be seen manifested in the use of messaging artefacts. This view of technology in support of leisure-in-the-broad is strongly divergent from traditional entertainment computing models in its coupling of the mechanics of the organisation of everyday life to the ways that we make entertainment for ourselves. This recognition allows us to draw specific implications for domestic situated messaging technologies, but also more generally for technology design by <b>tying</b> <b>activities</b> that we tend to regard as purely functional to other multifaceted and leisure-related purposes...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: This study aims to (1) {{describe}} and analyse the local ground operator’s {{role in the}} network of the Botswana tourism industry, (2) to investigate what factors characterize and influence their relationships with foreign tour operators, as well as (3) to provide implications for improving these relations. Methodology: This study has been conducted as a case study, where the empirical data was collected during a two months field trip to Botswana. A qualitative research method, and a deductive approach has been used. Five semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} ground operators to get their perspective of their own situation, and one with a person representing a governmental organisation. Most data was collected through the interviews, but participating observation also served as a source of information. The validity and reliability of the study has been enhanced by defining core concepts, interviewing several respondents, using an interview guide and recording most of the interviews. Results: Local ground operators play are crucial role in the network of Botswana’s tourism industry, as they are engaged in a high number of business relationships, are bringing the services at the destination together, and are connecting them to the tourists. They play a role as both customers and suppliers. Their relationship to tour operators abroad consists of a lot of resource <b>ties,</b> <b>activity</b> links as well as some actor bonds. Trust is found to be a very essential part of the relationship, and they perceive themselves as being dependent on the tour operators. Culture is not identified as a major influencing factor.

40|$|The {{research}} paper discusses {{the concept of}} 'network capitalism' (Boisot and Child 1996; 1999) {{in line with the}} 'network enterprise' concept developed by Castells (1996) o provide a background of the socio-cultural/institutional environment that characterises the Chinese context. Network capitalism differs from market capitalism or bureaucracies in terms of its adaptive mode to complex environments. In China the mode of complexity absorption is most often favoured over the complexity reduction mode used by Westerners (Boisot and Child 1999). The complexity absorption mode 'entails creating options and hedging strategies, [formally] often through alliances' (ibid. p. 237) and informally through guanxi-based trust and close relationships. The latter has important implications for analysing product development within networks in China, as it is related to soft knowledge transfer mechanisms and knowledge articulation rather than codification. This paper views guanxi as a process; not something static. Guanxi is seen as a dynamic resource created through interactive relationship processes. The concept of guanxi is linked to the IMP concept of interaction, which is relevant to the study of supply management and product development within the supply or production networks in China. Three case studies are conducted in Southern China using qualitative techniques of open-ended interviews with the aim of enhancing understanding of supply or production network formation, development and maintenance in a product development context. The main unit of analysis is supplier relationships among the Chinese; however, multiple relationship levels are analysed incorporating a network approach that takes into account relationship <b>ties,</b> <b>activity</b> links, and resource interdependences among buyers, suppliers and sub-suppliers. The three cases can be distinguished initially in terms of ownership structure, but similarities are also found at the operational level that is most relevant for successful product development. The case studies involve a state-owned company, a family-owned company group and a foreign-owned company...|$|R
40|$|This thesis explores how Danish {{migrants}} in the New York area {{engage in}} transnational <b>ties</b> and <b>activities,</b> {{and the influence}} these <b>ties</b> and <b>activities</b> have on the migrants’ incorporation in the American society. Numerous {{studies have examined the}} continuing ties and bonds of migrants to the land of their origin. But most studies on transnational migration focus on uneducated migrants from 3 rd world countries. There is a lack on studies that examine the processes of migration of well-educated white middleclass western migrants. I find that the lack of knowledge on how these migrants adapt and respond to the migrant situation makes it difficult for the majority-population in Denmark and other western countries to relate to and understand the situation of the non-western migrants. The reason is that non-western migrants have a very different background and culture than the majority population in western countries. I claim that Danish/Western migrants act like most other migrants when becoming a minority far from home. Danish migrants seek a community where they easily can be included, and where they know the norms and codes of conduct, this is in many cases the ethnic community. I have explored the incorporation of Danish migrants in the New York area and their transnational <b>ties</b> and <b>activities</b> to enable a better appreciation of migrants continuing ties to their country of origin. The overall objective of this thesis is to examine how Danish people themselves behave when they become the minority in a place far from home. The empirical data on which this thesis relies have been produced during my visit to New York in the spring of 2008. I interviewed ten Danish migrants in the New York area about their involvement in transnational activities and their transnational ties. My objective with the interviews has been to examine the ways in which individuals engage in social relations and practices that cross borders as a regular feature of everyday life. Furthermore, the objective has been to explore their highlighting of the transnational elements of who they are and how this affects their incorporation in the main society. I show how the Danish migrants express a transnational way of belonging by having an emotional connection to Denmark and the community of Danes by a notion of shared history and culture. The notion of belonging is expressed by a claim for a Danish identity and participation in organisations and social networks operating in the transnational social field. The Danes also express a transnational way of being which is observed in the way they engage in social relations with other people. Their understanding and interpretation of the actions and signals by others is based on their social and cultural understanding and experiences in a Danish context and not an American. Their way of being is transnational because it is based on Danish values, norms and codes of conduct. In general the Danish migrants are employed in non-ethnic business, do not segregate themselves into ethnic enclaves, feel {{as a part of the}} community, have social relations with Americans – though some more than others. I draw the conclusion that the Danish migrants, despite their transnational <b>ties</b> and <b>activities,</b> are well incorporated in the American society, as long as one does not equal incorporation with assimilation. In the public sphere the migrants are more or less assimilated, but in the private sphere they are not. However, their transnational belonging does hinder their incorporation in the American society to some extent. Several of the migrants refused to become naturalised American citizens because they were unwilling to cede their Danish citizenship. This excludes them from political rights in the United States, as well as in Denmark. The fact that they have no desire to become naturalized American citizens and thereby obtain political rights, hinder their full incorporation...|$|R
