5|$|Within 90 {{minutes of}} the explosion, McVeigh was stopped by Oklahoma Highway Patrolman Charlie Hanger for driving without a license plate and arrested for illegal weapons possession. Forensic {{evidence}} quickly linked McVeigh and Nichols to the attack; Nichols was arrested, and within days, both were charged. Michael and Lori Fortier were later identified as accomplices. McVeigh, {{a veteran of the}} Gulf War and a U.S. militia movement sympathizer, had detonated a Ryder rental truck full of explosives {{parked in front of the}} building. His co-conspirator, Nichols, had assisted with the bomb's preparation. Motivated by his dislike for the U.S. federal government and angry about its handling of the Ruby Ridge incident in 1992 and the Waco siege in 1993, McVeigh timed his attack to coincide with the second anniversary of the deadly fire that ended the siege at <b>the</b> <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidian</b> compound in Waco, Texas.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the integration of}} <b>the</b> <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> into <b>the</b> Waco, Texas community during the years immediately preceding the BATF siege of 1993. An examination of media and biographical sources indicates that <b>the</b> <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> were better integrated in the community than is commonly suggested. Survivor accounts describe <b>the</b> <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> working and relaxing in Waco, rather than hiding in their compound. A survey of local newspaper coverage reveals that the press in Waco had a positive view of Koresh and <b>the</b> <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> in <b>the</b> late 1980 s. In particular, coverage of a 1988 trial involving David Koresh and his followers in the Waco Tribune Herald was markedly more positive than the later and more famous coverage of the group in 1993...|$|R
50|$|After a {{jury trial}} lasting nearly two months, the jury acquitted four of <b>the</b> <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> on all charges. Additionally, the jury acquitted all of <b>the</b> <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> on <b>the</b> murder-related charges, but convicted five of them on lesser charges, {{including}} aiding and abetting the voluntary manslaughter of federal agents. Eight <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> were convicted on firearms charges.|$|R

Pace feels the Lord [...] "has anointed me and appointed me to be the leader" [...] but he claims he is [...] "not a prophet" [...] but [...] "a teacher of righteousness".

25|$|An {{investigation}} {{of the events of}} April 19, 1993 when Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) special agents served a warrant on <b>the</b> <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidian</b> compound at Waco, Texas was ongoing during Freeh's tenure. While the event had taken place before he became Director, a highly controversial investigation ensued, including allegations of a cover-up by the FBI, and tensions developed between Freeh and Janet Reno, then-Attorney General. Reno, who had herself been blamed for mishandling of the confrontation and investigation, sent United States Marshals to FBI headquarters to seize Waco-related evidence.|$|E
500|$|McVeigh {{believed}} that the bomb attack had {{a positive impact on}} government policy. In evidence he cited the peaceful resolution of the Montana Freemen standoff in 1996, the government's $3.1million settlement with Randy Weaver and his surviving children four months after the bombing, and April 2000 statements by Bill Clinton regretting his decision to storm <b>the</b> <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidian</b> compound.

2500|$|McVeigh {{instructed}} {{his lawyers}} {{to use a}} necessity defense, but they ended up not doing so, because {{they would have had}} to prove that McVeigh was in [...] "imminent danger" [...] from the government. (McVeigh himself argued that [...] "imminent" [...] did not necessarily mean [...] "immediate.") They would have argued that his bombing of the Murrah building was a justifiable response to what McVeigh believed were the crimes of the U.S. government at Waco, Texas, where the 51-day siege of <b>the</b> <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidian</b> complex resulted in the deaths of 76 Branch Davidians. [...] As part of the defense, McVeigh's lawyers showed the jury the controversial video Waco, the Big Lie.|$|E
2500|$|McVeigh {{later said}} he {{considered}} [...] "a campaign of individual assassination," [...] with [...] "eligible" [...] targets including Attorney-General Janet Reno, Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. of Federal District Court, who handled <b>the</b> <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidian</b> trial, and Lon Horiuchi, {{a member of}} the FBI hostage-rescue team who shot and killed Vicki Weaver in a standoff at a remote cabin at Ruby Ridge, Idaho, in 1992. He said he wanted Reno to accept [...] "full responsibility in deed, not just words." [...] Such an assassination seemed too difficult, and he decided that since federal agents had become soldiers, it was necessary to strike against them at their command centers. According to McVeigh's authorized biography, he ultimately decided that he would make the loudest statement by bombing a federal building. After the bombing, he was ambivalent about his act; as he expressed in letters to his hometown newspaper, he sometimes wished he had carried out a series of assassinations against police and government officials instead.|$|E
5000|$|Following this disappointment, Benjamin Roden {{formed a}} {{splinter}} group called <b>the</b> <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidian</b> Seventh-day Adventists and succeeded in {{taking control of}} the Mount Carmel property.

The film challenged the mainstream news reports of <b>the</b> <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidian</b> siege and created a small sensation, alleging a government coverup of the events surrounding the siege.

CEVs used explosives to puncture holes in the walls of buildings of the compound so they could pump in CS gas ("tear gas") and try to flush out <b>the</b> <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> without harming them. The stated plan called for increasing amounts of gas to be pumped in over two days to increase pressure. Officially, no armed assault was to be made, and loudspeakers were used to tell <b>the</b> <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> {{that there would be}} no armed assault and to ask them not to fire on the vehicles. FBI agents had been permitted to return any incoming fire, but no shots were fired by federal agents on April 19.

50|$|Well known but distant offshoots are the Davidian Seventh-day Adventist {{organization}} and <b>the</b> <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians,</b> themselves a schism {{within the larger}} Davidian movement. The Davidians formed in 1929, following Victor Houteff after he came out with his book The Shepherd's Rod which was rejected as heretical. A succession dispute after Houteff's death in 1955 {{led to the formation}} of generally two groups, the original <b>Davidians</b> and <b>the</b> <b>Branches.</b> Later, another ex-Adventist, David Koresh, led <b>the</b> <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> until he died in the 1993 siege at the group's headquarters near Waco, Texas.|$|R
5000|$|The ATF {{knew that}} <b>the</b> <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> {{had a pair}} of [...]50 caliber rifles, so they asked for Bradley armored vehicles, which could resist that caliber. During the siege, Koresh said that he had weapons bigger than [...]50 rifles and that he could destroy the Bradleys, so they were {{supplemented}} with two Abrams tanks and five M728 vehicles. The Texas Rangers recovered at least two [...]50 caliber weapons from the remains of the compound. There is the question of whether <b>the</b> <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> actually fired <b>the</b> [...]50 caliber rifles during the raid or during the assault. Various groups supporting gun bans, such as Handgun Control Incorporated and the Violence Policy Center have claimed that <b>the</b> <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> had used [...]50 caliber rifles and that therefore these types of firearms should be banned. The ATF claims such rifles were used against ATF agents the day of the search. Several years later, the General Accounting Office, in response to a request from Henry Waxman, released a briefing paper titled [...] "Criminal Activity Associated with [...]50 Caliber Semiautomatic Rifles" [...] which repeated the ATF's claims that <b>the</b> <b>Branch</b> <b>Davidians</b> used [...]50 caliber rifles during the search. FBI Hostage Rescue Team snipers did report sighting one of the weapons, readily identifiable by its distinctive muzzle brake, during the siege.|$|R
