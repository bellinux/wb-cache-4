25|$|The <b>toe</b> <b>box</b> is {{the part}} that covers and protects the toes. People with toe deformities, or {{individuals}} who experience toe swelling (such as long distance runners) usually require a larger <b>toe</b> <b>box.</b>|$|E
25|$|A demi-pointe shoe, {{which is}} also {{variously}} called a break-down, pre-pointe, or a soft-block shoe, shares many characteristics with pointe shoes. For example, its outer appearance resembles that of a pointe shoe {{and it has a}} <b>toe</b> <b>box,</b> although the box is softer and the wings (sides of the <b>toe</b> <b>box)</b> are typically not as deep as those found on pointe shoes. Demi-pointe shoes are secured to the feet with ribbons and elastic band in identical fashion to pointe shoes. Unlike pointe shoes, however, demi-pointe shoes have no shank and, as a result, they do not provide the support necessary for proper pointe work.|$|E
25|$|Pointe {{shoes are}} {{designed}} for ballet dancing. These have a <b>toe</b> <b>box</b> that is stiffened with glue and a hardened sole so the dancer can stand on the tips of their toes. They are secured by elastic straps and ribbons that {{are tied to the}} dancer's ankles.|$|E
50|$|Gaynor Minden’s unique {{manufacturing}} system employs injection molded, thermoplastic elastomeric shanks and <b>toe</b> <b>boxes,</b> in {{a choice}} of stiffness. Impact and noise absorbing cellular urethane cushioning is located throughout the shoe. The exterior is traditional satin and a suede outer sole; the linings are treated with silver ion and combined directly to the satin. An elastic drawstring opens at the side. Unlike turnshoe manufacturing pleats are not used.|$|R
40|$|Two {{cases of}} {{osteochondral}} lesions of the proximal pha-lanx {{of the great}} toe at the interphalangeal joint are presented. This condition is characterized by pain, swell-ing, and tenderness at the interphalangeal joint. The roentgenographic characteristics resemble osteochon-dritis dissecans. Curettage and bone grafting to the le-sion is effective. These conditions in adolescent soccer players {{may be caused by}} chronic repetitive overloading of the interphalangeal joint using soccer shoes with soft, supple, and narrow <b>toe</b> <b>boxes...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Charlie made boots {{the best}} way he knew how—not the fastest (a pair {{required}} at least twenty hours, sometimes double, of [...] "hand time," [...] not counting fitting, curing, drying, and other pauses in the process); not the cheapest (nylon, plastic, and rubber cost less); and not the easiest (leather <b>toe</b> <b>boxes</b> and hand-spun flax thread took time and skill). The result? [...] "A horse can step on my boots and they won't break down." ...|$|R
25|$|En pointe dancers employ pointe {{technique}} to determine foot placement and body alignment. When exhibiting proper technique, a dancer's en pointe foot is placed {{so that the}} instep is fully stretched, with toes perpendicular to the floor, with the pointe shoe's platform (the flattened tip of the <b>toe</b> <b>box)</b> square to the floor so that {{a substantial part of}} its surface is contacting the floor.|$|E
25|$|Demi-pointe {{shoes are}} most often used to train dancers who are new to pointe technique. They serve to {{acclimate}} dancers to the feel of wearing pointe shoes and to strengthen the ankles and feet in preparation for dancing en pointe in pointe shoes. The <b>toe</b> <b>box</b> allows the dancer to experience {{the feel of a}} pointe shoe, while the insole and outsole work together to provide the resistance needed for developing foot and ankle strength.|$|E
25|$|Orthopedic {{shoes are}} specially-designed {{footwear}} to relieve discomfort associated with many foot and ankle disorders, such as blisters, bunions, calluses and corns, hammer toes, plantar fasciitis, or heel spurs. They {{may also be}} worn by individuals with diabetes or people with unequal leg length. These shoes typically have a low heel, tend to be wide with a particularly wide <b>toe</b> <b>box,</b> and have a firm heel to provide extra support. Some may also have a removable insole, or orthotic, to provide extra arch support.|$|E
50|$|In many cases, {{conservative}} treatment {{consisting of}} physical therapy and new shoes with soft, spacious <b>toe</b> <b>boxes</b> {{is enough to}} resolve the condition, while in more severe or longstanding cases Hammertoe Surgery {{may be necessary to}} correct the deformity. The patient's doctor may also prescribe some toe exercises that can be done at home to stretch and strengthen the muscles. For example, the individual can gently stretch the toes manually, or use the toes to pick things up off the floor. While watching television or reading, one can put a towel flat under the feet and use the toes to crumple it. The doctor can also prescribe a brace that pushes down on the toes to force them to stretch out their muscles.|$|R
40|$|Pair of lady's {{shoes of}} black kid leather and broadcloth. The "high button shoes" have black leather <b>toe</b> <b>boxes</b> with pointed <b>toes</b> and black leather {{sections}} at heels which extend from heel {{up the back}} of the shoe. The uppers are of black wool broadcloth. Shoes secure at outside edges with 12 circular, slightly domed black buttons. Upper edges lined with black leather, the rest lined with white cloth. The medium-height heel is rounded at sides and back, and squared-off at front. Although not technically a "stacked" heel, the layers can be seen. Maker's label sewn into lining at top: "Wichert / Shoe / Trade Mark / New York U. S. A. " Retailer's gilt stamp on inside edge: "Norton's / Gainesville, Tex. " Handwritten notation inside boot, just below upper edge: " 36 - 1 36752 / 330 "...|$|R
60|$|Buggins {{could talk}} of nothing after that but Shalford's meanness in {{turning off the}} gas, and after being {{extremely}} satirical indeed about their employer, undressed in the dark, hit his bare <b>toe</b> against a <b>box</b> and subsided after unseemly ejaculations into silent ill-temper.|$|R
2500|$|Wide heels do not {{necessarily}} offer more stability, and any raised heel with too much width, such as found in [...] "blade-heeled" [...] or [...] "block-heeled" [...] shoes, induces unhealthy side-to-side torque to the ankles with every step, stressing them unnecessarily, while creating additional impact {{on the balls of}} the feet. Thus, the best design for a high heel is one with a narrower width, where the heel is closer to the front, more solidly under the ankle, where the <b>toe</b> <b>box</b> provides room enough for the toes, and where forward movement of the foot in the shoe is kept in check by material snug across the instep, rather than by the toes being rammed forward and jamming together in the <b>toe</b> <b>box</b> or crushed into the front of the <b>toe</b> <b>box.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The other primary type of wear {{involves}} the exterior fabric. In pointe work the front face and bottom {{edge of the}} <b>toe</b> <b>box</b> are subjected to friction against the performance surface. This friction will eventually wear through the shoe's outer fabric covering, thereby exposing the <b>toe</b> <b>box</b> and creating loose, frayed fabric edges. Unlike a weakened shank, damaged outer fabric {{does not affect the}} performance of a shoe. Due to its unprofessional appearance, however, damaged fabric may render the shoe unfit to wear in situations other than informal practice or rehearsal.|$|E
2500|$|Freed pointe {{shoes are}} made using the {{traditional}} turn shoe method, with a [...] "signature" [...] peach-colored satin. The <b>toe</b> <b>box</b> is constructed by gluing together hand-layered triangles of hessian and paper, using a proprietary, water-based glue. After {{the box is}} formed, pleats are formed in the satin that covers the shoe and secured with metal pincers. The shoe is then stitched and the sole is joined to the upper with wax thread. Next, the pointe shoe is turned right-side-out and the insole is inserted. Finally, the box, which is not yet dried, is hammered into its final shape.|$|E
50|$|Until recent {{advances}} in technology, shellac (French polish) was the only glue used {{in the making of}} ballet dancers' pointe shoes, to stiffen the <b>box</b> (<b>toe</b> area) to support the dancer en pointe. Many manufacturers of pointe shoes still use the traditional techniques, and many dancers use shellac to revive a softening pair of shoes.|$|R

5000|$|For the fit to last, so to speak, {{the boot}} {{had to hold}} the shape. In the {{construction}} of the boot itself, as with {{the construction of the}} last, Charlie had some secrets. He drew on a lifetime of incorporating ideas and practices from the dozens of bootmakers with whom he worked and his own, constant effort to improve his practices. By the 1970s, something like a Charlie Dunn [...] "code" [...] for bootmaking had taken shape. Put simply, he made boots the old-fashioned way, never trying something new unless it improved the boot, and sometimes not even then, for he preferred the traditional way. This [...] "code" [...] had practices that were not negotiable for Charlie. The boot must have hard maple, not plastic or metal, pegs in securing various elements. He insisted on spinning his own flax threads for stitching and binding, though doing so {{took a long time to}} perfect and was expensive. Nylon thread, though sometimes more durable, was never used. Though almost every other bootmaker, including custom fitters, used plastic <b>toe</b> <b>boxes</b> as inserts to shape the toe of the boot, Charlie insisted on shaping them exclusively with leather boxes because they were tougher, could be built in almost any appropriate shape, and retained the tradition of bootmaking by hand. Where leather joined to leather, he skived, or thinned, both pieces to obtain a smoother, less abrasive seam, one that not only felt better to the wearer but also retained the lines of the boot. To provide support for the foot of the boot, Charlie used only iron spikes pounded flat by his hammer of 70+ years on his anvil affixed to a tree stump. For small men and women, he used a 40-penny spike; for larger men, he used a 60-penny spike, about six inches long and half-inch wide, known as a [...] "bridge timber spike." [...] And [...] "The sole has got to be leather and got to be thick leather," [...] and that's the way it was, for Charlie. These and other elements defined the Charlie Dunn [...] "code" [...] of making boots that had passed through the centuries of bootmaking, refined in his hands and on shop machines nearly as old as he was.|$|R
2500|$|A dancer may {{transition}} to en pointe {{by any of}} three possible methods: relevé, sauté or piqué. In the relevé method, the dancer rises smoothly by rotating the foot downward until it reaches a fully extended, vertical orientation, while the <b>toe</b> <b>box</b> remains {{in contact with the}} floor, thus [...] "rolling up" [...] on the foot. This may be done either gradually or rapidly, on one foot or both feet, beginning with {{feet flat on the floor}} or in demi-pointe (heels raised). In the sauté method, the dancer springs up and lands en pointe. In the process, the feet break contact with the floor and the dancer is briefly airborne. To {{transition to}} en pointe via piqué, a dancer will step out directly onto a fully extended, vertical foot. The other foot is then raised from the floor, thereby leaving the dancer en pointe.|$|E

2500|$|The 19th {{century was}} a period of great social change, which was {{reflected}} in ballet by a shift away from the aristocratic sensibilities that had dominated earlier periods through romantic ballet. Ballerinas such as Geneviève Gosselin, Marie Taglioni and Fanny Elssler experimented with new techniques such as pointework that gave the ballerina prominence as the ideal stage figure. Taglioni was known as the [...] "Christian Dancer," [...] as her image was light and pure (associated with her role as the sylph in La Sylphide). She was trained primarily by her father, Filipo Taglioni. In 1834, Fanny Elssler arrived at the Paris Opera and became known as the [...] "Pagan Dancer," [...] because of the fiery qualities of the Cachucha dance that made her famous. [...] Professional librettists began crafting the stories in ballets. Teachers like Carlo Blasis codified ballet technique in the basic form that is still used today. The ballet <b>boxed</b> <b>toe</b> shoe was invented to support pointe work.|$|R
