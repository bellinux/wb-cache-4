50|$|The {{cleaning}} {{performance of}} the bristle blasting process {{is a consequence of}} synchronized impact of the bristle tips onto the target surface. The tool head with the bristle belt rotates at approximately 2,500 rpm. A so-called 'accelerator bar' detains the bristle tips and by releasing them increases their kinetic energy with which they strike the surface. Immediately after the bristles strike the corroded steel surface, they retract (rebound) from the surface ('single-impact'), which results in corrosion removal and a micro-identation that exposes the sheer metallic surface. The multitude of such primary impact craters generates a texture and surface which in visual cleanliness and roughness (anchor profile) mimics those obtained by grit blasting processes. The cleaned and coarsened surface is deemed favorable for <b>the</b> <b>subsequent</b> <b>application</b> and adhesion of protective films and industrial coatings.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Surface {{parameterization}} establishes bijective maps from {{a surface}} onto a topolog-ically equivalent standard domain. It {{is well known}} that the spherical parameterization is limited to genus-zero surfaces. In this work, we design a new parameter domain, two-layered sphere, and present a framework for mapping high genus surfaces onto sphere. This setup allows us to trans-fer the existing applications based on general spherical parameterization to the field of high genus surfaces, such as remeshing, consistent parameterization, shape analysis, and so on. Our method is based on Riemann surface theory. We construct meromorphic functions on sur-faces: for genus one surfaces, we apply Weierstrass P-functions; for high genus surfaces, we compute the quotient between two holomorphic one-forms. Our method of spherical parameterization is theoretically sound and practically efficient. It makes <b>the</b> <b>subsequent</b> <b>applications</b> on high genus surfaces very promising...|$|R

In one of the intermediary steps, a modified method for extracting relative importance of ANN inputs was developed. The resulting relative weight results indicated that the importance of input variables of continuous outcomes may vary over the course of outcome's duration. Observing relative weights for three outcomes indicated that each outcome must have its own prediction model...|$|R

50|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} in a renewable-energy-dominated energy system to use the excess electricity generated by wind, solar photovoltaic, hydro, marine current, etc. to make methane (natural gas) via water electrolysis and <b>the</b> <b>subsequent</b> <b>application</b> of the Sabatier reaction.In contrast to a direct usage of hydrogen for transport or energy storage applications, the methane can be injected into the existing gas network, which in many countries has {{one or two years}} of gas storage capacity. The methane can then be used on demand to generate electricity (and heat—combined heat and power) overcoming low points of renewable energy production. The process is electrolysis of water by electricity to create hydrogen (which can partly be used directly in fuel cells) and the addition of carbon dioxide CO2 (Sabatier process) to create methane. The CO2 can be extracted from the air or fossil fuel waste gases by the amine process, amongst many others. It is a low-CO2 system, and has similar efficiencies of today's energy system.A 6 MW power-to-gas plant went into production in Germany in 2013, and powered a fleet of 1500 Audi A3s.|$|E

The current specification (2009) is MIL-DTL-5541F, which superseded MIL-C-5541E in July 2006. The specification is approved for use by all departments and agencies of the United States Department of Defense (DoD). Although prepared specifically for DoD applications, the standard is used for many commercial applications as well.
