In Morondava in Toliara Province, the government distributed 4tons of rice seed, while in Ambatolampy in Antananarivo Province, the government sent 10tons of rice; additionally, the World Food Programme sent 80tons of flour to the nation.

5|$|The unique {{characteristics}} of R.palmatus {{have made it}} difficult for taxonomists to agree on how it should be classified, resulting in an elaborate taxonomical history and an extensive synonymy. First named Agaricus palmatus by Bulliard in 1785, it was reclassified into several different genera before becoming Rhodotus in 1926. The familial placement of the genus Rhodotus within the order Agaricales has also been subject to dispute, and the taxon has been transferred variously <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>families</b> Amanitaceae, Entolomataceae, and Tricholomataceae. More recently, molecular phylogenetics analysis has helped determine that Rhodotus is most closely related to genera in the Physalacriaceae.|$|E
5|$|Certain occupations were {{traditionally}} {{reserved for}} women, {{while they were}} also exempted from corvée labor duties. Women were expected to rear children, weave clothes for the family, and perform domestic duties such as cooking; although farming was considered men's work, sometimes women tilled fields alongside their husbands and brothers. Some women formed communal spinning and weaving groups to pool resources together to pay for candles, lamp oil, and heat during night and winter. A successful textile business could employ hundreds of women. Singing and dancing to entertain wealthy patrons were other common professions open for women. When a husband died, sometimes the widow became the sole supporter of her children, and thus {{had to make a}} living weaving silk cloths or making straw sandals to sell in the market. Some women also turned to the humble profession of sorcery for income. Other more fortunate women could become renowned medical physicians who provided services <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>families</b> of high officials and nobility. Some wealthy women engaged in luxury trade, such as one who frequently sold pearls to a princess. Some even aided in their husband's business decisions. Female merchants dressed in silk clothes which rivaled even female nobles' attire were considered immoral compared to the ideal woman weaver.|$|E
5|$|In October 1873, Grant's {{neutrality}} {{policy was}} shaken, when a Spanish cruiser captured a merchant ship, Virginius, flying the U.S. flag, carrying war materials and men {{to aid the}} Cuban insurrection. Spanish authorities executed the prisoners, including eight American citizens, and many Americans called for war with Spain. Grant ordered the Navy to increase its presence in the Caribbean. Fish, with Grant's support, worked to reach a peaceful resolution. Spain's president, Emilio Castelar y Ripoll, expressed regret for the tragedy, surrendered the Virginius and paid a cash indemnity of $80,000 <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>families</b> of the executed Americans. Realizing the Navy was susceptible to European naval powers, in June 1874, Secretary Robeson commissioned the reconstruction of five redesigned double-turreted monitor warships.|$|E

5000|$|Many {{important}} {{families of}} matroids are closed under {{the operation of}} taking minors: if a matroid M belongs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>family,</b> then every minor of M also belongs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>family.</b> In this case, <b>the</b> <b>family</b> may be characterized by its set of [...] "forbidden matroids", the minor-minimal matroids that do not belong <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>family.</b> A matroid belongs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>family</b> {{if and only if}} it does not have a forbidden matroid as a minor. Often, but not always, the set of forbidden matroids is finite, paralleling the Robertson-Seymour theorem which states that the set of forbidden minors of a minor-closed graph family is always finite.|$|R
5|$|In {{the days}} after Chanchu moved through the Philippines, then-President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo ordered that the country's National Disaster Coordinating Council help all towns {{affected}} by the storm. The agency helped coordinate search and rescue missions. Several areas were {{declared a state of}} calamity, mostly on Mindoro, Samar, and Batangas. The Tzu Chi Foundation visited islands in eastern Samar, providing money <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>families</b> whose houses were destroyed. Towns in the region also assisted by supplying thatch to rebuild homes. In Oriental Mindoro, the Philippine Red Cross provided food and relief items to families in Calapan. The Adventist Development and Relief Agency also provided building materials for 200families in Mindoro. Ultimately, the government provided storm victims with ₱415.1million (PHP, $7.6million USD) worth of relief supplies. Rainfall from the storm caused a red tide in Taal Lake, after dispersing a Ceratium bloom.|$|E
5|$|The La Colonia Formation {{is exposed}} over the {{southern}} {{slope of the}} North Patagonian Massif. Most vertebrate fossils, including Carnotaurus, come from the formation's middle section (called the middle facies association). This part likely represents the deposits of an environment of estuaries, tidal flats or coastal plains. The climate would have been seasonal with both dry and humid periods. The most common vertebrates collected include ceratodontid lungfish, turtles, crocodiles, plesiosaurs, dinosaurs, lizards, snakes and mammals. Some of the snakes {{that have been found}} belong <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>families</b> Boidae and Madtsoidae, such as Alamitophis argentinus. Turtles are represented by at least five taxa, four from Chelidae (Pleurodira) and one from Meiolaniidae (Cryptodira). Among the marine reptiles is the plesiosaur Sulcusuchus erraini of the family Polycotylidae. Mammals are represented with Reigitherium bunodontum, which was considered the first record of a South American docodont, and Argentodites coloniensis, possibly of Multituberculata. In 2011, the discovery of a new enantiornithine bird from the La Colonia Formation was announced.|$|E
5|$|The Ehoie of Salmoneus' {{daughter}} Tyro {{provides the}} transition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>families</b> {{of the male}} Aeolids. As king of Elis, Salmoneus forced his subjects to worship him as Zeus and simulated the god's thunder and lighting by dragging bronze cauldrons from his chariot and throwing torches through the air. The real Zeus destroyed king and subjects alike, but spared Tyro and conducted her {{to the house of}} her uncle Cretheus in Thessaly because she wrangled with her impious father. There she became enamoured of the river Enipeus, but Poseidon had his own designs upon Tyro and in the guise of the river lay with her, siring Neleus and Pelias. The brothers did not get along, and Zeus gave them different realms to rule: Pelias received as his lot Iolcos; to Neleus fell Pylos in the western Peloponnese. The house of Neleus now takes center-stage. Heracles sacked Pylos, killing all the male Neleids, save Nestor who was off in Gerenia, another Messenian city. Periclymenus, a son of Neleus to whom Poseidon had granted the ability to change shape, was Pylos' only bulwark against the onslaught of Heracles, and the Catalogue-poet granted him a brief aristeia which ended when Athena pointed out that the bee on Heracles' chariot was actually the Pylian defender. Following the account of Nestor's marriage and family, the contest for Neleus' daughter Pero was narrated. The father would give her hand to whoever could rustle the cattle of Iphicles from Phylace, a feat accomplished by Bias {{with the help of his}} brother Melampus. The poet then turned to the family of Pelias as the last assignable papyrus fragment from book 1 breaks off. It is likely that Tyro's children by Cretheus—Aeson, Pheres and Amythaon—followed, and there might have been room in the book to at least start the family of Cretheus' brother Athamas.|$|E
