5|$|Despite {{the modest}} {{popularity}} of IBM <b>Token</b> <b>Ring</b> in the 1980s and 1990s, virtually all LANs now use either wired or wireless Ethernet facilities. At the physical layer, most wired Ethernet implementations use copper twisted-pair cables (including the common 10BASE-T networks). However, some early implementations used heavier coaxial cables and some recent implementations (especially high-speed ones) use optical fibers. When optic fibers are used, the distinction {{must be made}} between multimode fibers and single-mode fibers.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we present the {{reliability}} analysis of ring-based hierarchical directed {{networks in the}} context of large-scale multiprocessors. A wide range of hierarchical structures based on the basic, dual counter-rotating, and braided (skip-a-node) rings are analyzed and compared in thispaper. We have adopted the two-processor (two-temzinal) reliability criteria for our analysis. The results of computing the system reliability for thousands of processors show that hierarchical structures constructed of counter-rotating and braided rings significantly improve the reliability of hierarchical structures constructed of basic rings. For most of the hierarchies the braided structures have better survivability andprovide higher reliability than the counter-rotating structures for long mission times. Our results show that uniform hierarchical structures tend to provide better reliability than nonuniform structures. The results are of value in designing real time systems, large-scale architectures, and general computer networks. Because Scalable Coherent Interface (SCI) appears to be a promising interface for high speed interconnections, we use it to illustrate both the approach and the applicability of our results. The results apply also to similar ring architectures such as <b>token</b> <b>rings,</b> slotted rings, and other unidirectional ring networks. 1...|$|R

This network, called FDDI-based reconfigurable network (FBRN), is constructed using multiple FDDI <b>token</b> <b>rings</b> {{and has the}} ability to reconfigure itself in the event of extensive damage to the network. Thus, an FBRN has the potential to provide high available bandwidth even in the presence of numerous faults. Realization of this potential depends crucially on a reconfiguration algorithm that guides the reconfiguration process. We design and analyze a reconfiguration algorithm for FBRNs. Our algorithm is optimal {{in the sense that it}} always produces a configuration that results in the maximum available bandwidth for a given fault pattern. This algorithm has a polynomial time complexity. We also show that the available bandwidth of an FBRN is dramatically improved with our reconfiguration algorithm.
