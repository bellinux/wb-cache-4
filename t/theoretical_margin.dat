After its creation prior to the 2008 election, ABC electoral commentator Antony Green calculated a <b>theoretical</b> <b>margin</b> of 10.6% favouring Australian Labor Party over the Liberal Party in two party preferred terms. Rita Saffioti won the seat in 2008, holding it again with a margin of 1.9 points after the 2013 election. A redistribution in 2015 saw the seat with a notional 0.9 point Liberal margin, however Saffioti retained the seat at the 2017 election which saw a large swing to Labor.|$|E

It is necessary to obtain the crack tip stress field before a failure criterion of composite materials is applied. However, the crack tip stress field is complicated since there are numerous factors that influence the crack tip stress distribution.

One way to guard against default is prudent margin setting practices designed to protect futures positions from extreme price movements. The objective of this research is to extrapolate the probabilities of encountering extreme price movements by applying statistical extreme value theory to the Finnish stock index futures market. The extreme value technique is found to be appropriate since it generates <b>theoretical</b> <b>margin</b> violation probabilities that closely follow the empirical probability distribution.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of time delays on the {{stability}} of a generator excitation control system compensated with a stabilizing transformer known as rate feedback stabilizer to damp out oscillations. The time delays are due {{to the use of}} measurement devices and communication links for data transfer. An analytical method is presented to compute the delay margin for stability. The delay margin is the maximum amount of time delay that the system can tolerate before it becomes unstable. First, without using any approximation, the transcendental characteristic equation is converted into a polynomial without the transcendentality such that its real roots coincide with the imaginary roots of the characteristic equation exactly. The resulting polynomial also enables us to easily determine the delay dependency of the system stability and the sensitivities of crossing roots with respect to the time delay. Then, an expression in terms of system parameters and imaginary root of the characteristic equation is derived for computing the delay <b>margin.</b> <b>Theoretical</b> delay <b>margins</b> are computed {{for a wide range of}} controller gains and their accuracy is verified by performing simulation studies. Results indicate that the addition of a stabilizing transformer to the excitation system increases the delay margin and improves the system damping significantly...|$|R

The measurement devices and communication links used by networked control systems, cause {{a significant amount of}} time delays. The stability boundary of the system in terms of the time delay is theoretically determined and an expression is obtained to compute the delay margin in terms of system parameters. The delay margin is defined as the maximum amount of time delay for which the DC motor speed control system is marginally stable. The results indicate that the system becomes unstable if the time delay exceeds the delay margin at a given set of parameters. <b>Theoretical</b> delay <b>margin</b> results are verified using the time-domain simulations of MATLAB/Simulink.

Cell handoff is required {{to make the transition}} of a mobile between cells smoother without degrading performance. CDMA multiple access allows soft handoff, in which the signal strength of the mobile is detected and tracked by the searchers from more than one base stations. The cell receiving strongest signal strength handles signal processing. In this paper, we demonstrate that the signal detection quality in the handoff region can be further improved by fusing the detected results from multiple base stations. A new fusion handoff strategy is designed, and its error performance measures are derived analytically in the presence of log-normal shadowing. <b>Theoretical</b> fading <b>margin</b> analysis shows that the fusion handoff approach offers better network performance over conventional hard and soft handoffs...|$|R
40|$|Examining the {{material}} history of contemporary Madrid, this dissertation investigates the spatial process of Europeanization {{as both a}} state-led project and an everyday urban experience. Looking particularly {{to the role of}} private property within that larger experiment, I argue Madrid’s urban development has long been central to Spain’s quest for strategic inclusion within the broader European landscape. In turn, I demonstrate how the recent moment of financialization and neoliberal planning worked through longer historical questions of modernity that implicated changing concepts of difference. In a moment in which the European project is now in doubt, moreover, I reveal how once marginal groups now articulate new repertoires and imaginaries for a more inclusive Union. Demonstrating the primacy of homeownership—long utilized as a mechanism that offered admission into Madrid’s imagined whole—I address how both the state and its citizens conceived of European membership as a spatial project of physical expansion and acquisition. Through archival research, I show that private property markets became a tool for both state-led Europeanization and middle class aspirations of economic advancement and consumption. Accordingly, I look to the <b>theoretical</b> <b>margins</b> of this ontological regime, namely, immigrant participation within the housing market. In doing so, I uncover how the state treated their acquisition of private property as a de facto integration policy. Employing ethnographic methods, I then demonstrate how the financialization of that model has precipitated both everyday violence along lines of race, class, and gender, and new forms of resistance and civil disobedience, as experiences of dispossession contribute to new repertoires of activism and solidarity. To conclude, I demonstrate how grassroots movements challenge ecologies of speculative homeownership through new arsenals of political action and inclusive urban politics that insists on mutual cooperation. Such politics imagines an alternative future in which plurality and diversity are not only tolerated, but also enliven the limits of possibility. By challenging the borders and boundaries of Spain’s boom and bust, this dissertation reveals how political economic crisis and uncertainty provide openings for new articulations of grassroots organizing and political action, against the standard narrative of xenophobia and exclusion. Ultimately, it argues Europe’s everyday citizens are fundamentally transforming their relationship to the state and its systems of rule...|$|R
40|$|Data fusion is {{the study}} of optimal {{information}} processing in distributed multisensor environments with the benefits of more reliable detection and higher immunity to noise and sensor failures. We investigate applications of the data fusion principle to the handoff problem in popular code-division multiple access (CDMA) cellular wireless communication networks. When a mobile station traverses a cell boundary, cell handoff is required to make the transition of a mobile between cells smoother without degrading performance. CDMA multiple access allows soft handoff, in which the signal strength of the mobile is detected and tracked by the searchers from more than one base station.

The impact was of gating on treatment margins, image artifacts, and volume and positional accuracy was investigated by CT imaging of sinusoidally moving spheres. The motion of the spheres simulates target motion. During the CT imaging of dynamically moving spheres, gating reproduced the static volume to within 1 %, whereas errors of over 20 % were observed where gating was not used. Using a <b>theoretical</b> analysis of <b>margins,</b> gating alone or in combination with an electronic portal imaging device may allow a 2 - 11 mm reduction in the CTV to PTV margin, and thus less healthy tissue need be irradiated.
