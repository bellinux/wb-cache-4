5|$|In September 1985, the Board of Governors of the World Bank {{endorsed}} the Convention establishing <b>the</b> <b>Multilateral</b> Investment Guarantee Agency. MIGA was established and became operational on April 12, 1988 {{under the leadership}} of then-Executive Vice President Yoshio Terasawa, becoming the fifth member institution of the World Bank Group. MIGA initially had $1 billion ($1.94 billion in 2012 dollars) in capital and 29 member states. All members of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) were eligible to become members of the agency. MIGA was established as an effort to complement existing sources of non-commercial risk insurance for investments in developing countries, and thereby improve investor confidence. The agency's mandate to be apolitical has been said to be an advantage over private and national risk insurance markets. By serving as a multilateral guarantor, the agency reduces the likelihood of confrontations among the investor's country and the host country.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The paper tests {{whether the}} theory of Purchasing Power Parity holds in a {{selected}} sample of twenty African countries. The paper employs a panel unit root test to test whether the real exchange rates in the panel are mean reverting or not. The test employed is the Im et al (1997) test. Results show that the null of a unit root is rejected for the three real exchange rate indices, namely, the import-based and trade-weighted <b>multilateral</b> indices, and <b>the</b> bilateral indices, while for the export-based indices, the null hypothesis is not rejected. That is, Purchasing Power Parity is confirmed for the import-based and trade-weighted <b>multilateral</b> indices, and <b>the</b> bilateral indices, while it is rejected for <b>the</b> export-based <b>multilateral</b> indices. After performing the demeaning adjustment to account for cross-sectional dependence, our {{results show that the}} null hypothesis of a unit root is rejected for <b>the</b> import-based <b>multilateral</b> indices and <b>the</b> bilateral indices, while the null is not rejected for <b>the</b> trade-weighted <b>multilateral</b> indices.
