Regarding the artwork, Ament said, [...] "The reason that we went with Tchad [...] is because he provides an amazing atmosphere to songs....So, I think we wanted the artwork to represent that....One of the themes that we've been exploring...is just realizing that in the big scheme of things, even the music that we make when we come together, no matter how powerful it is, it's still pretty minuscule.

[...] William Arnold of Seattle Post-Intelligencer found it as [...] "a series of Grand Guignol skits played for mean-spirited laughs."

That said, it’s most definitely not for the squeamish nor the easily offended."

500|$|Sophie Muller {{directed}} the music video for [...] "Love Is a Camera", which {{was released on}} 30 May 2014. The video commences with Ellis-Bextor, who impersonates an [...] "eerie temptress" [...] {{dressed in a black}} [...] "ankle-length, lace-trimmed" [...] gown, walking and dancing slowly inside a classical mansion. Exploring the divisions of her house, she starts adjusting picture frames, which hold monochromatic photographs of individuals. One of <b>those</b> <b>pictures</b> depicts a short-haired woman, dressed in white—also played by Ellis-Bextor—who starts mimicking the song, whilst in the frame. The story of the woman in the frame is told throughout the video—after crossing a field, she finds the mansion.

Whilst walking down a staircase, the [...] "temptress" [...] passes by a bearded man who stares at her interestingly.

500|$|The single reel drama, {{approximate}} 1000 feet long, {{was released}} on July 8, 1910. Theaters in Indiana and Pennsylvania were among those which advertised the film, one specifically focusing on the film having dealing with [...] "the labor question". A review in The Moving Picture News was contained detailed praise of the film's relevance and success in portraying the subject. The reviewer states, [...] "This film strikes home. ... The situation has been lived in New York City. The strike and its miseries are not forgotten. Whoever arranged the story had a big, tender heart and knew what appeals to the masses. The glee with which the superintendent's discomfiture was hailed by the audience spoke volumes. We wish {{some of the pictures}} were not quite so vividly black and white. Mayhap the tenseness of the situation hit the cameraman. Be that as it may, one thing is certain - there is no melodrama, but scenes out of real life." [...] While the reviewer in this case refers to the scenario being drawn from real life, the happy ending is termed as a fantasy by reviewer in The Moving Picture World who states, [...] " [...] of <b>those</b> <b>pictures</b> which thrill one despite their improbability. It may go in stories but never in fact, that an owner of a factory marries one of his girl employees, and a strike leader at that..." ...|$|E
500|$|The younger alternate-timeline Spock. Quinto {{expressed}} interest in the role because of the duality of Spock's half-human, half-Vulcan heritage, and how [...] "he is constantly exploring that notion of how to evolve in a responsible way and how to evolve in a respectful way. I think those are all things {{that we as a}} society, and certainly the world, could implement." [...] He mentioned he heard about the new film and revealed his interest in the role in a December 2006 interview with the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette; the article was widely circulated and he attracted Abrams' interest. For the audition, Quinto wore a blue shirt and flattened his hair down to feel more like Spock. He bound his fingers to practice the Vulcan salute, shaved his eyebrows, and grew and dyed his hair for the role. He conveyed many of Spock's attributes, such as his stillness and the way Nimoy would hold his hands behind his back. Quinto commented that the physical transformation aided in portraying an alien, joking [...] "I just felt like a nerd. I felt like I was 12 again. You look back at <b>those</b> <b>pictures</b> and you see the bowl cut. There's no question I was born to play the Spock role. I was sporting that look for a good four or five years. The film officially establishes (to Kirk's surprise) that Uhura and Spock are lovers and have been romantically linked for some time, a point which had never been previously explored on TV or in film." [...] Adrien Brody had discussed playing the role with the director before Quinto was cast.|$|E

500|$|... "The Master Plan" [...] {{marked the}} first {{appearance}} of Adam Scott, who also appeared in the subsequent season finale [...] "Freddy Spaghetti" [...] and became a regular cast member during the third season. Scott left the Starz comedy Party Down to join the Parks and Recreation cast, a decision he made {{in part because it}} was unclear whether Starz would renew the series: [...] "It was a matter of me asking Starz {{if it was going to}} continue, and them saying they weren't ready to make that decision. I couldn't pass up the opportunity on Parks and Rec for a show that could possibly not exist anymore." [...] Schur said when the Ben Wyatt character was written, Scott was envisioned as the [...] "dream scenario" [...] for casting. Schur described Scott as [...] "brilliant and funny" [...] and praised his comedic range: [...] "There just aren't that many people with a comedic range that spans Step Brothers to Party Down.". Several commentators said Ben Wyatt closely resembles the character Scott played on Party Down, Henry Pollard. While Ben was a politician who found great success at a young age then suffered a downfall, Henry was an actor who became a caterer after his acting career declined. Scott, however, said he feels they are [...] "vastly different characters and circumstances". The idea of a character trying to rebuild a government career following a humiliating public failure was one of the original ideas for the series of Parks and Recreation in general, but one that was ultimately not used until the Ben Wyatt character was introduced. During the scene when Ben explains his failed mayoral tenure, shots of a newspaper clip with images of the character's prom pictures are shown. <b>Those</b> <b>pictures</b> are the actual high school prom photos of actor Adam Scott.|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} filmed {{in front of}} a live {{audience}} at the United Nations General Assembly in New York on August 10, 2012. SuperUber worked on integration between animations and technology, the structure design and projection mapping that took over the General Assembly Hall after it was invited by Kenzo Digital. 10 20K HLM Barco projectors were placed and mapping was done using Pandora's widget designer and 5 Pandora's Dual Box servers. The final video had an 8856 x 1664 resolution and was split into 10 slices of 1080 x 1664 pixels, since each projector was turned on its side and the images were projected vertically in order to cover the whole structure. Two slices were fed into each system and SuperUber did the warping and edge blending inside Pandora. The screen which was used was over 12,000 square feet; Lucas Werthein, a representative for SuperUber commented that it was the largest indoor temporary screen that was a tilted compound curve adding that from an engineering standpoint, it is [...] "extremely complex". It was custom-designed to mold {{to the inside of the}} General Assembly Hall. It spanned 68m X 15m and surrounded the audience with a 240 degree immersive projection. Ten synchronized and mapped projections covered the screen with 200,000 lumens, creating one continuous giant image. The screen which weighed 1000 pounds was sewn by forty five people. The whole structure, which was hanging off the UN ceiling weighed 6000 pounds. Werthein revealed, [...] "In order to create the proper tension for the screen to hold its shape we had to weld permanent rigging points into the dome of the general assembly." [...] Peter Kirn of Create Digital Motion wrote that the projection mapping was performed onto a fairly simple surface: [...] "What makes the mapping so effective is the way in which it can fill the space, making <b>those</b> <b>pictures</b> immersive on a grand architectural scale. It makes the image a real volume in which the performance can take place." [...] Russ Rive, SuperUber’s director said, [...] "It’s an ambitious project that has completely transformed an iconic location – seen as immutable and unchanging, with its goldplated panel and grand volume. By adding a virtual layer to it, we could digitally rebuild it, playing with the architectural elements, and therefore changing the notion of something static. The technology made the integration between animation and architecture. We used projectors to 'paint with light' the UN General Assembly’s Hall – a unique opportunity to transform such an emblematic place." ...|$|E
