Wesley and Fox capture Pekwarsky, who arranges a meeting with Cross. When Wesley faces Cross alone on a moving train, Fox crashes a car into the train, causing a derailment. After Cross saves Wesley from falling, Wesley fatally shoots him. Before dying, Cross reveals that he is Wesley's real father. Fox confirms this, and explains that Wesley was recruited {{because he was the}} only person Cross would not kill. Fox points her gun at Wesley, but he shoots the window below,falling into the river.|$|E

5|$|Another {{major benefit}} of the tunnel will be the redirecting of {{the large amount of}} {{vehicles}} (nearly 16,000 daily; 2009 estimate), many of them container trucks and cruise buses, <b>that</b> <b>cross</b> Biscayne Boulevard (US 1) at NW 5th Street (Port Boulevard), using level streets, such as Northeast 1st Avenue, which for years were the only way to access the port. Along with the capacity of the port, the amount of truck traffic could double after the completion of the numerous port projects. Additionally, the Port Boulevard entrance to the port is closed at night, concentrating all truck traffic during the day. This traffic creates congestion and presents a danger to pedestrians and bicyclists. Traffic is also considered to be a harm to Miami's northern central business district, reducing its ability to grow, including the new arts and entertainment (Omni) district, valued at over $12 billion.|$|E
5|$|By 1930, {{the college}} 1st VIII had reached its highest {{position}} on the river for thirty years. In 1947, the college chaplain Leslie Cross presented {{a new set of}} oars to the club. He retired that year, and the college magazine, noting <b>that</b> <b>Cross</b> had been a particularly generous supporter of the club, stated that the oars had already been used to good purpose. The 1st VIII progressed further in the 1950s, making five bumps in 1951 and four in 1952 to reach the first division, with a high point of seventh in 1957. It later returned to the second division, before re-entering the first division in 1970. Its highest position in recent years was seventh in the first division in 2000; it has been back in the second division since 2004, and finished eighth in the second division in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Eight sacbe (causeways) {{have been}} located around Calakmul.

The causeway network not only linked Calakmul with local satellite sites but also with more distant allies and rivals, such as the great cities of El Mirador, El Tintal and Nakbe. Those causeways <b>that</b> <b>cross</b> swampy land are elevated above the surrounding wetland and they now tend to support denser vegetation than the surrounding forest.|$|E

5|$|Grand Canyon {{lies on the}} {{southern}} end of the Intermountain West seismic belt. At least 35 earthquakes larger than 3.0 on the Richter Scale occurred in the Grand Canyon region in the 20th century. Of these, five registered over 5.0 on the Richter Scale and the largest was a 6.2 quake that occurred in January 1906. Major roughly north—south trending faults <b>that</b> <b>cross</b> the canyon are (from west to east), the Grand Wash, Hurricane and Toroweap. Major northeast-trending fracture systems of normal faults that intersect the canyon include the West Kaibab and Bright Angel while northwest-trending systems include the Grandview—Phantom. Most earthquakes in the region occur in a narrow northwest-trending band between the Mesa Butte and West Kaibab fracture systems. These events are probably the result of eastward-migrating crustal stretching that may eventually move past the Grand Canyon area.|$|E
5|$|Like the Philadelphia {{extension}}, {{the western}} extension required {{the building of}} long bridges, including those <b>that</b> <b>cross</b> the Beaver River and the Allegheny River. The overpasses along the road consisted of steel girder bridges and through plate girder bridges. Unlike the other segments, the concrete arch bridge was not used for overpasses, although {{it was used to}} carry the turnpike over other roads. On August 7, 1950, the roadway opened between the Irwin and Pittsburgh interchanges. Ohio Governor Frank Lausche led a dedication ceremony on November 26, 1951. The extension opened to the Gateway toll plaza near the Ohio border on December 26, 1951. At the time, the highway ended in a cornfield. Traffic followed a temporary ramp onto local rural roads until the connecting Ohio Turnpike could be built. On December 1, 1954, the Ohio Turnpike opened.|$|E
5|$|M-72 {{is a state}} {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan, running from Lake Huron to Lake Michigan across {{the northern part of}} the Lower Peninsula. The highway connects M-22 in Empire with US Highway 23 (US23) in Harrisville. It is one of only three Michigan state trunklines <b>that</b> <b>cross</b> the Lower Peninsula, shore to shore. In between, M-72 runs across Northern Michigan woodland, agricultural areas of the Leelanau Peninsula near Traverse City, and the Au Sable River watershed. The trunkline also provides access to Camp Grayling, a National Guard training facility near the city of the same name. Traffic levels along the highway vary from approximately 800vehicles a day on the east end to over 32,000vehicles near Traverse City.|$|E

5|$|On March 9, Cross {{abruptly}} resigned as Attorney-General; Woods resigned the next day. Cross gave as his reason that Rutherford {{had told him}} that Cushing was re-entering cabinet, and Cross felt that that made his position untenable. Cushing gave a different account: {{he said that he had}} been asked by Rutherford to re-enter cabinet, and that the Premier {{had told him that}} if he did, Cross would resign. However, he denied ever having agreed to do so, and accused Cross of fabricating his story completely. Rutherford stayed silent until March 11, when he announced that he had refused Cross's resignation, and that he was still Attorney-General. Soon after, Boyle made his own set of accusations, saying that agents of the liquor license department, which was under Cross, had been demanding bribes from hoteliers in exchange for licenses and <b>that</b> <b>Cross</b> was aware of this. Cross denied the charge.|$|E
5|$|The {{founding}} educational {{philosophy is}} still {{evident in the}} modern day curriculum in the focus on learning by doing, teaching based on broad themes <b>that</b> <b>cross</b> subjects, an emphasis on collaborative projects, and a de-emphasis of textbooks.

These principles, adapted in the 1970s for gifted students, have been further extended to accommodate new developments in technology and educational research.|$|E
5|$|The lake formed {{several times}} over during the Holocene when water from the Colorado River was {{diverted}} into the Salton Trough. This tectonic depression forms the northern basin of the Gulf of California, but it was separated from the sea proper by {{the growth of the}} Colorado River Delta. Such changes in river courses may have been caused by earthquakes among the numerous faults <b>that</b> <b>cross</b> the region, such as the San Andreas Fault. Conversely, {{it is possible that the}} weight of the water itself triggered earthquakes. During its existence, Lake Cahuilla formed strandlines and various beach deposits such as gravel bars and travertine deposits.|$|E

5|$|The list {{of names}} {{consists}} of entries from 17 Southeast and East Asian nations and the United States who have territories directly affected by typhoons. The submitted names are arranged into five lists, and each list is cycled with each year. Unlike tropical cyclones {{in other parts of}} the world, typhoons are not named after people. Instead, they generally refer to animals, flowers, astrological signs, and a few personal names. However, PAGASA retains its own naming list, which does consist of human names. Therefore, a typhoon can possibly have two names. Storms <b>that</b> <b>cross</b> the date line from the central Pacific retain their original name, but the designation of hurricane becomes typhoon. In Japan, people use the numerical designation of typhoons according to the sequence of their occurrence in the calendar year.|$|E
5|$|In the universe, thorium {{is among}} the rarest of the {{primordial}} elements, because {{it is one of}} the two elements that can be produced only in the r-process, and also because it has slowly been decaying away from the moment it formed. The only primordial elements rarer than thorium are uranium, also produced only by the r-process, and thulium, lutetium, tantalum, and rhenium, the odd-numbered elements just before the third peak of r-process abundances around the heavy platinum group metals. Neutron capture by nuclides beyond A = 209 often results in nuclear fission instead of neutron absorption, reducing the fraction of nuclei <b>that</b> <b>cross</b> the gap of instability past bismuth to become actinides such as thorium. In the distant past the abundances of thorium and uranium were enriched by the decay of plutonium and curium isotopes, and thorium was enriched relative to uranium by the decay of 236U to 232Th and the natural depletion of 235U, but these sources have long since decayed and no longer contribute.|$|E
5|$|The crisis {{divided the}} Liberal Party into two camps: the pro-government Liberals, led by Cross and Rutherford, and the insurgent Liberals, led by Cushing and Boyle. The insurgents' {{objective}} was to replace Rutherford with Cushing. Though most important Liberals outside the legislature, including Bulyea and Oliver, lacked confidence in Rutherford, they had little more in Cushing. Some newspapers characterized the struggle as the visible element of a battle for influence between Oliver, long Alberta's most prominent Liberal, and Cross, seen as its rising star. Though Rutherford never actually lost a confidence motion, Bulyea pressured him to resign in favour of Arthur Sifton, the province's chief justice. Several of Cross's supporters attempted to extract a promise to keep Cross as Attorney-General {{in exchange for their}} support of Sifton's government, but Sifton was unwilling to agree. Rutherford eventually and reluctantly complied with Bulyea's wishes, {{and the rest of his}} government, including Cross, followed suit. Subsequent rumours suggested <b>that</b> <b>Cross</b> and his followers had agreed to resign only because of a belief that Sifton would be appointed to the Supreme Court of Canada after approximately a year as Premier, with Cross then being asked to form a government. A subsequent commission declined to find Cross guilty of wrongdoing in relation to the A incident, but criticized him and Rutherford for granting over-generous terms to the railway.|$|E
