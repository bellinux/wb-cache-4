5|$|The {{sixth and}} final symphony, Sinfonia semplice, {{was written in}} 1924–25. After {{suffering}} a serious heart attack in 1925, Nielsen was forced to curtail much of his activity, although he continued to compose until his death. His sixtieth birthday in 1925 brought many congratulations, a decoration from the Swedish government, and a gala concert and reception in Copenhagen. The composer, however, was in a dour mood; {{in an article in}} Politiken on 9 November 1925 he wrote: If I could live my life again, I would chase any thoughts of Art out of my head and be apprenticed to a merchant or pursue some other useful trade the results of which could be visible in the end... What use is it to me that the whole world acknowledges me, but hurries away and leaves me alone with my wares until everything breaks down and I discover to my disgrace that I have lived as a foolish dreamer and believed that <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>I</b> worked and exerted myself in my art, the better position I would achieve. No, it is no enviable fate to be an artist.|$|E

Maybe at the time I {{was a little bit}} selfish with it. I think it kind of hit me so hard. It just blindsided me. I just went into such a dark place that, with everything, the drugs, my thoughts, everything.

25|$|They don't respect {{our culture}} because we didn't give {{permission}} {{for someone to}} carve the sacred Black Hills where our burial grounds are. They were there for us to enjoy and they were there for us to pray.

25|$|I needed good victims. Recent news {{had offered}} an {{excellent}} group, the Baha'is, {{who had been}} horribly persecuted in Iran. <b>The</b> <b>more</b> <b>I</b> researched them, the more convinced I became that they would make excellent space colonists. My primary reference was an aged primer on the Baha'i Faith by J. E. Esselmont. I did receive some comments from several Baha'is suggesting that I'd portrayed them as too pacifistic, however, I'll stick by my guns on this. My characters, while they believe in public defense, even armies, to preserve peace, are stubborn in living by a passage I found in Esselmont's book in which Baha'u'llah forbids the Baha'is from taking up arms {{in the defense of}} the faith. The story is carefully crafted to back them into this corner. Our hero is faced with a loss of his faith, which enables him to take action to save his people, but leaves him in a spiritual dilemma.|$|E

500|$|Mikoyan {{received}} his {{education at the}} Nersisian School in Tiflis and the Gevorgian Seminary in Vagharshapat (Echmiadzin), both affiliated with the Armenian Apostolic Church. Religion, however, played an increasingly insignificant role in his life. He would later remark that his continued studies in theology drew him closer to atheism: [...] "I had a very clear feeling that I didn't believe in God and that I had in fact received a certificate in materialist uncertainty; <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>I</b> studied religious subjects, the less I believed in God." [...] Before becoming active in politics Mikoyan had already dabbled {{in the study of}} liberalism and socialism.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the time}} of its release, G. Brown of The Denver Post {{reported}} that Harley disdained the song's commercial potential in private.

500|$|The Guardian of Education was {{the first}} {{periodical}} to take the reviewing of children's books seriously. Trimmer's over four hundred reviews constituted a set of distinct and identifiable criteria regarding what was valuable in this new genre. As a high-church Anglican, she was intent on protecting Christianity from secularism as well as evangelicalism, particularly as the latter manifested itself in Methodism. Her reviews also reveal {{her to be a}} staunch monarchist and opponent of the French Revolution. As Grenby puts it, [...] "her initial questions of any children's books that came before her were always first, was it damaging to religion and second, was it damaging to political loyalty and the established social hierarchy". Religion was Trimmer's first priority and her emphasis on the doctrine of Biblical inerrancy illustrated her fundamentalism. She wrote to a friend: [...] "I will only say, that <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>I</b> reflect on the subject, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>I</b> am convinced that it is not right to supersede the figurative style in which they speak of God and divine things, my opinion is, that whoever attempts to teach the truths of divine revelation, should follow the method of the inspired writers as nearly as possible" [...] For Trimmer, the truth of the Bible was not only in its content, but also in its style, and some of her harshest reviews were written against texts that altered both the style and the substance of the Bible.|$|E
500|$|The band {{immediately}} started {{to search for}} a replacement vocalist and found Howard Jones of Blood Has Been Shed. Jones disliked the band's sound when he first heard it. He commented, [...] "I was like, 'Meh.' I come from hardcore and dirtier metal, and Killswitch sounded so clean. But <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>I</b> listened to it, I realized there's some really good songs here". After hearing about Leach's vocal problems, Jones contacted the band and was accepted as the replacement. Philip Labonte of All That Remains tried out for lead vocals but lost to Jones, who had to quickly memorize seven songs for his debut at the 2002 Hellfest.|$|E
500|$|Synge {{joined the}} Dublin Naturalists' Field Club {{and read the}} works of Charles Darwin. He wrote: [...] "When I was about {{fourteen}} I obtained a book of Darwin's.... My studies showed me the force of what I read, [...] <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>I</b> put it from me the more it rushed back with new instances and power... Soon afterwards I turned my attention to works of Christian evidence, reading them at first with pleasure, soon with doubt, and at last in some cases with derision." [...] He then continued, [...] "Soon after I had relinquished the kingdom of God I began {{to take up a}} real interest in the kingdom of Ireland.

500|$|In 1943, the Texas League disbanded {{due to the}} {{shortage}} of players during World War II. [...] Oana was sold to the Milwaukee Brewers in February 1943, and he appeared in 20 games for that team. [...] However, baseball commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis ruled that Oana was a free agent since the Texas League had disbanded. In late June 1943, Oana signed with the Detroit Tigers. In an introductory interview with the Detroit press, Oana {{had this to say}} about his supposed connection to Hawaiian royalty: When I first joined the Seals, stories were published that I was a Hawaiian prince. <b>The</b> <b>more</b> <b>I</b> denied them, the more people believed them.

500|$|The artwork of Royal Robertson, {{a self-proclaimed}} prophet from Louisiana, {{was used for}} the album's cover and interior. Will Hermes of Rolling Stone said that Sufjan Stevens uses the artwork [...] "as a {{springboard}} for music that evokes a visionary psyche." [...] Stevens became interested in the work of Robertson after recording music for a friend's documentary on the artist, and said that [...] ", <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>I</b> felt a weird affinity to this guy and the story of his life." [...] He began to transcribe some of the text that appears in Robertson's artwork, and says this process stayed with him a [...] "long time" [...] and [...] "that some of it started to come up in the lyrics, in the songs I was writing.|$|E

When I called my producer about it he asked who I wanted to sing it with me and I said Kelly Clarkson, but I didn’t think we’d be able to get her. I’ve always been a big fan of hers. I love her voice and I love her style. Long story short, we got her a copy of the song and she loved it. As soon as she started singing, it became obvious {{it was going to be}} great." ...|$|E

500|$|Dan White's {{arrest and}} trial caused a sensation, and {{illustrated}} severe {{tensions between the}} liberal population and the city police. The San Francisco Police were mostly working-class Irish descendants who intensely disliked the growing gay immigration, {{as well as the}} liberal direction of the city government. After White turned himself in and confessed, he sat in his cell while his former colleagues on the police force told Harvey Milk jokes; police openly wore [...] "Free Dan White" [...] T-shirts {{in the days after the}} murder. An undersheriff for San Francisco later stated: [...] "The more I observed what went on at the jail, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>I</b> began to stop seeing what Dan White did as the act of an individual and began to see it as a political act in a political movement." [...] White showed no remorse for his actions, and only exhibited vulnerability during an eight-minute call to his mother from jail.|$|E

At the time, Mason was still filming for the show, but ATV {{reported that}} it was not known if he would be given a new contract. However, in January 2011, a Network Ten spokesperson told SX News that Mason's role would be expanded from April and he and Chris will get more screen time. Chris will be seen taking on [...] "issues that every gay teenager does." [...] On becoming a regular cast member, Mason told Channel 5, [...] "I love it. The more time I spend on Neighbours, <b>the</b> <b>more</b> <b>I</b> feel part of the show. And I'm learning all the time. The thing about this industry is it's very hard to find stable work, so to have stability, I'm extremely grateful." ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} for Complex, Beyoncé expressed dissatisfaction with contemporary radio.

I wanted musical changes, bridges, vibrata, live instrumentation and classic songwriting." [...] On her website she wrote, [...] "The album is definitely an evolution.
