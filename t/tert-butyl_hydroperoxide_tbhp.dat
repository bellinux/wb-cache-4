50|$|Many organic {{compounds}} are prepared using peroxides, most famously epoxides from alkenes. <b>Tert-butyl</b> <b>hydroperoxide</b> (<b>TBHP)</b> is an organic-soluble oxidant employed {{in a variety}} of metal-catalyzed oxidations, such as the Halcon process (to give propylene oxide) and the Sharpless epoxidation.|$|E
5000|$|... tert-Butyl {{alcohol is}} used as a solvent, ethanol denaturant, paint remover ingredient, and {{gasoline}} octane booster and oxygenate. It is a chemical intermediate used to produce methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) and ethyl tert-butyl ether (ETBE) by reaction with methanol and ethanol, respectively, and <b>tert-butyl</b> <b>hydroperoxide</b> (<b>TBHP)</b> by reaction with hydrogen peroxide.|$|E
50|$|It is used {{in organic}} {{chemistry}} {{as a catalyst for}} the epoxidation of allylic alcohols by <b>tert-butyl</b> <b>hydroperoxide</b> (<b>TBHP).</b> The VO(acac)2-TBHP system exclusively epoxidizes geraniol at the allylic alcohol position, leaving the other alkene of geraniol untouched. By comparison, m-CPBA, another epoxidizing agent, reacts with both alkenes, creating the products in a two to one ratio favoring reaction at the alkene away from the hydroxyl group. TBHP oxidizes VO(acac)2 to a vanadium(V) species which coordinates the alcohol of the substrate and the hydroperoxide.|$|E

40|$|Tetrakis(trimethylsiloxy) {{titanium}} (TTMST, Ti(OSiMe 3) 4) possesses {{an isolated}} Ti center {{and is a}} highly active homogeneous catalyst in epoxidation of various olefins. The structure of TTMST resembles that of the active sites in some heterogeneous Ti−Si epoxidation catalysts, especially silylated titania−silica mixed oxides. Water cleaves the Ti−O−Si bond and deactivates the catalyst. An alkyl <b>hydroperoxide,</b> <b>TBHP</b> (<b>tert-butyl</b> <b>hydroperoxide),</b> does not cleave the Ti−O−Si bond, but interacts via weak hydrogen-bonding as supported by NMR, DOSY, IR, and computational studies. ATR−IR spectroscopy combined with computational investigations shows that more than one, that is, up to four, TBHP can undergo hydrogen-bonding with TTMST, leading to the activation of the O−O bond of TBHP. The greater the number of TBHP molecules that form hydrogen bonds to TTMST, the more electrophilic the O−O bond becomes, and the more active the complex is for epoxidation. An allylic alcohol, 2 -cyclohexen- 1 -ol, does not interact strongly with TTMST, but the interaction is prominent when it interacts with the TTMST−TBHP complex. On {{the basis of the}} experimental and theoretical findings, a hydrogen-bond-assisted epoxidation mechanism of TTMST is suggested...|$|R

50|$|Alkene dihydroxylation by {{osmium tetroxide}} {{is an old}} and {{extremely}} useful method for the functionalization of olefins. However, since osmium(VIII) reagents like osmium tetroxide (OsO4) are expensive and extremely toxic, it has become desirable to develop catalytic variants of this reaction. Some stoichiometric terminal oxidants that have been employed in these catalytic reactions include potassium chlorate, hydrogen peroxide (Milas hydroxylation), N-Methylmorpholine N-oxide (NMO, Upjohn dihydroxylation), <b>tert-butyl</b> <b>hydroperoxide</b> (<b>tBHP),</b> and potassium ferricyanide (K3Fe(CN)6). K. Barry Sharpless {{was the first to}} develop a general, reliable enantioselective alkene dihydroxylation, referred to as the Sharpless Asymmetric Dihydroxylation (SAD). Low levels of OsO4 are combined with a stoichiometric ferricyanide oxidant in the presence of chiral nitrogenous ligands to create an asymmetric environment around the oxidant.|$|E
5000|$|Metal {{complexes}} {{are useful}} catalysts for these reactions. Typical peroxide reagents include hydrogen peroxide, peroxycarboxylic acids, and alkyl hydroperoxides (generated in-situ or preformed). In specialized applications, other peroxide-containing reagents are employed, such as dimethyldioxirane. Depending on {{the mechanism of}} the reaction and the geometry of the alkene starting material, cis and/or trans epoxide diastereomers may be formed. In addition, if there are other stereocenters present in the starting material, they can influence the stereochemistry of the epoxidation relative to them. The metal-catalyzed epoxidation was first explored using <b>tert-butyl</b> <b>hydroperoxide</b> (<b>TBHP)</b> {{as a source of}} an O atom. [...] Association of TBHP with the metal generates the active metal catalyst with a peroxy ligand (MOOR), which then transfers an O center to the alkene.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} the response of the antioxidant defense system to two oxidative stressors, hydrogen peroxide and <b>tert-butyl</b> <b>hydroperoxide,</b> in HepG 2 cells in culture. The parameters evaluated included enzyme activity and gene expression of superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and activity of glutathione reductase. Besides, markers of the cell damage and oxidative stress evoked by the stressors such as cell viability, intracellular reactive oxygen species generation, malondialdehyde levels, and reduced glutathione concentration were evaluated. Both stressors, hydrogen peroxide and <b>tert-butyl</b> <b>hydroperoxide,</b> enhanced cell damage and reactive oxygen species generation at doses above 50 μM. The concentration of reduced glutathione decreased, and levels of malondialdehyde and activity of the antioxidant enzymes consistently increased only when HepG 2 cells were treated with <b>tert-butyl</b> <b>hydroperoxide</b> but not when hydrogen peroxide was used. A slight increase in the gene expression of Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase and catalase with 500 μM <b>tert-butyl</b> <b>hydroperoxide</b> and of catalase with 200 μM hydrogen peroxide was observed.

30|$|The {{fact that}} no dimerization {{products}} (13 a, 13 b or 13 c) formed {{in the absence of}} a copper salt suggests that the copper(II) ion, rather than <b>tert-butyl</b> <b>hydroperoxide,</b> plays the role of oxidizing the carbanion to a radical in the dimerization process. <b>Tert-butyl</b> <b>hydroperoxide</b> just serves as an oxidant to convert copper(I) to copper(II) in the oxidative dimerization process.|$|R

40|$|This work {{addresses}} {{a correlation between}} the redox state of pyridine nucleotides and that of sulfhydryl groups of the mitochondrial membranes. Several major observations emerge: (1) Conditions leading to an oxidation of the pyridine nucleotides such as incubation with <b>tert-butyl</b> <b>hydroperoxide</b> or acetoacetate determine a decrease of total mitochondrial sulfhydryl groups. Glutathione does not follow the same pattern since it decreases {{in the presence of}} <b>tert-butyl</b> <b>hydroperoxide</b> but not in the presence of acetoacetate.

40|$|During plant-microbe {{interactions}} {{and in the}} environment, Xanthomonas campestris pv. phaseoli {{is likely to be}} exposed to high concentrations of multiple oxidants. Here, we show that simultaneous exposures of the bacteria to multiple oxidants affects cell survival in a complex manner. A superoxide generator (menadione) enhanced the lethal effect of an organic peroxide (<b>tert-butyl</b> <b>hydroperoxide)</b> by 1, 000 -fold; conversely, treatment of cells with menadione plus H 2 O 2 resulted in 100 -fold protection compared to that for cells treated with the individual oxidants. Treatment of X. campestris with a combination of H 2 O 2 and <b>tert-butyl</b> <b>hydroperoxide</b> elicited no additive or protective effect. High levels of catalase alone are sufficient to protect cells against the lethal effect of menadione plus H 2 O 2 and <b>tert-butyl</b> <b>hydroperoxide</b> plus H 2 O 2. These data suggest that H 2 O 2 is the lethal agent responsible for killing the bacteria {{as a result of these}} treatments. However, increased expression of individual genes for peroxide (alkyl hydroperoxide reductase, catalase) - and superoxide (superoxide dismutase) -scavenging enzymes or concerted induction of oxidative stress-protective genes by menadione gave no protection against killing by a combination of menadione plus <b>tert-butyl</b> <b>hydroperoxide.</b> However, X. campestris cells in the stationary phase and a spontaneous H 2 O 2 -resistant mutant (X. campestris pv. phaseoli HR) were more resistant to killing by menadione plus <b>tert-butyl</b> <b>hydroperoxide.</b> These findings give new insight into oxidant killing of Xanthomonas spp. that could be generally applied to other bacteria...|$|R

The objective {{of the present study was}} to investigate the protective effect of quercetin on cell viability and redox status of cultured HepG 2 cells submitted to oxidative stress induced by <b>tert-butyl</b> <b>hydroperoxide.</b> Concentrations of reduced glutathione and malondialdehyde, generation of reactive oxygen species and activity and gene expression of antioxidant enzymes were used as markers of cellular oxidative status. Pretreatment of HepG 2 with 10 μM quercetin completely prevented lactate dehydrogenase leakage from the cells.

Reactive oxygen species generation induced by <b>tert-butyl</b> <b>hydroperoxide</b> was significantly reduced when cells were pretreated for 2 or 20 h with 10 μM and for 20 h with 5 μM quercetin.
