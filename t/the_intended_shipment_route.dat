40|$|The energy {{security}} {{is a growing concern}} both of the EU governments, and of Brussels. The European officials have been working on a strategy that should ensure the {{energy security}} of the Union. Some of the main courses of action are as follows: increasing the energy output from regenerative resources, cutting down on the dependence upon Russia by finding alternative suppliers, and interconnecting the <b>shipment</b> <b>routes.</b> Romania must act as such in order to face the domestic economic challenges. An increase in the quota of energy derived from regenerative resources of the total energy output will be sustained by important investments in the hydro-energy and eolian field. Another top priority for Romania is to interconnect the <b>shipment</b> <b>routes</b> for hydrocarbons at the European and regional level. ...|$|R

500|$|Árbenz had <b>intended</b> <b>the</b> <b>shipment</b> {{of weapons}} from the Alfhem {{to be used}} to bolster peasant militia, in the event of army disloyalty, but the US {{informed}} the Guatemalan army chiefs of the shipment, forcing Árbenz to hand them over to the military, and deepening the rift between him and the chiefs of his army. Castillo Armas' forces invaded Guatemala on June 18, 1954. The invasion was accompanied by an intense campaign of psychological warfare presenting Castillo Armas' victory as a fait accompli, with the intent of forcing Árbenz to resign. The most wide-reaching psychological weapon was the radio station known as the [...] "Voice of Liberation", whose transmissions broadcast news of rebel troops converging on the capital, and contributed to massive demoralization among both the army and the civilian population. Árbenz was confident that Castillo Armas could be defeated militarily, but he worried that a defeat for Castillo Armas would provoke a US invasion. Árbenz ordered Carlos Enrique Díaz, the chief of the army, to select officers to lead a counter-attack. Díaz chose a corps of officers who were all known to be men of personal integrity, and who were loyal to Árbenz.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{proposed}} in 1803, the canal was finally {{constructed by the}} Army Corps of Engineers from 1913 to 1916.

50|$|The {{illegal drug}} trade in Haiti {{involves}} trans-shipment {{of cocaine and}} marijuana to the United States. It is a major <b>shipment</b> <b>route.</b> The island of Hispaniola, which Haiti shares with the Dominican Republic places Haiti in an ideal location for drug smuggling between Colombia and Puerto Rico. Because Puerto Rico is a Commonwealth of the United States, shipments are generally not subject to further U.S. Customs inspection after reaching the territory. Cocaine is also often smuggled directly to Miami in freighters.|$|R

50|$|Resultantly, most {{industrial}} railways are short, usually {{being only}} a few miles/kilometers long. While these types of lines most often at some point connect via exchange sidings or transfer sidings to bulk mainline shipping railways, there are notable exceptions which are hundreds of miles long, which include the iron ore-carrying railways in Western Australia, or in China to transport coal, while in Canada there are the Quebec North Shore and Labrador Railway and the Cartier Railway. These lines {{can be thought of}} as dedicated <b>shipment</b> <b>routes,</b> where only the products of that industry require shipment between those two points, and hence a dedicated line makes more economic sense with only limited possibility of consolidation of shipment with other industries.|$|R

50|$|Fort Pierre Chouteau {{was located}} {{just north of}} the {{confluence}} of the Missouri and Bad Rivers, on a low terrace above {{the west bank of the}} Missouri River. This site was of strategic importance for several reasons. It served as a midpoint among the outposts of the American Fur Company (AFC), which monopolized trade on the upper Missouri, and as an endpoint for a major overland <b>shipment</b> <b>route</b> to Fort Laramie in present-day eastern Wyoming. The fort was built as a replacement for Fort Tecumseh, located nearer the river confluence, which had been built by the AFC's predecessor in the regional fur trade, the Columbia Fur Company. That fort, built about 1822, was poorly sited and subject to flooding. Some of its timber elements were reused in the construction of Fort Pierre Chouteau.|$|R

50|$|Illinois State Route 25 {{was to be}} {{built in}} the early 20th century to serve {{the east side of the}} Fox River, running from Oswego to Algonquin. Bosworth's {{residence}} was located on grounds adjacent to the planned highway. Seeing an opportunity for development, Max McGraw purchased the property in 1926. McGraw was beginning to accrue great wealth in manufacturing, due to the success of his Toastmaster products. He added a single-story extension later that year. Route 25 was opened in 1929, and the Country Tea Room, like many roadside restaurants in its day, flourished. The road was an important <b>shipment</b> <b>route</b> for dairy products and provided a route for tourists seeking to visit Wisconsin to the north. Customers enjoyed toasting their own bread with McGraw's invention, and some bought Toastmasters for their own homes. When the restaurant first opened, dining options for automobile travelers were limited to picnics or fancy hotels. Roadside restaurants filled the need for other options for travelers in the 1920s and 1930s. McGraw also maintained the dairy operations of the farm until 1939.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{tries to}} address the dynamic priority shipment routing problem and dynamic service network design problem for the less-than-truckload (LTL) carriers. First, described is a decision support tool to assist LTL managers in studying, analyzing and planning LTL operations so that scarce resources are used more effectively and efficiently. The decision support tool helps to understand the complicated interactions between the <b>shipment</b> <b>route,</b> closing rules, cost, and service level. Numerical experiments are done using the decision support tool to analyze the existing rules of LTL carriers and to understand their effect on {{the total cost of}} the system and the service level provided;Currently, LTL carriers route both regular and priority shipments through their service networks using some fixed route patterns known as load plans. In this research, an alternative routing strategy for routing priority shipments in LTL networks is proposed. This strategy exploits the stochasticity and dynamism embedded in the routing process and utilizes the real time information about terminals to determine the <b>shipment</b> <b>routes</b> adaptively. The research shows that this strategy can be formulated as the problem of finding a dynamic shortest path problem over a network with random arc costs. An efficient algorithm is developed that can solve this optimization problem in real-time. Numerical testing using real data sets suggests that the proposed strategy can improve the level of service for priority shipments;LTL carriers currently use ad hoc rules in deciding when there is enough capacity to close a trailer. In order to reduce the fixed and penalty costs incurred by the LTL carriers and to increase the service level provided by LTL carriers to customers, the decision should be optimized over time. In other words, the decision to dispatch a trailer should not only depend on the current shipment level, but should also vary dynamically based on time of day, day of the week, and seasonal effects. A dynamic control policy for dispatching a trailer over a single link is proposed in this research. This research provides an approach to estimate the shape of the recourse function. The dynamic control policy exploits the linearity of the recourse function estimated in solving the trailer dispatching problem efficiently. The algorithm is easy to implement and computationally fast and hence can be extended to solve large LTL networks. Experiments with the dynamic control policy show that the solutions obtained are very close to the optimal...|$|R

Escobar and Robert Vesco purchased most of the land on the island, which included a [...] airstrip, a harbor, a hotel, houses, boats, and aircraft, and they built a refrigerated warehouse to store the cocaine.
