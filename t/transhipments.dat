40|$|Traditionally, {{maritime}} economists, {{ports and}} shipping lines have considered container <b>transhipment</b> {{to be more}} expensive than direct call services, mainly {{by virtue of the}} extra feeder costs and container lift charges involved. This seems contrary to ongoing industry developments, with <b>transhipment</b> hubs now quite common in most major regions. Here, modelled costs for <b>transhipment</b> in northern Europe have been estimated and compared with an alternative multiport service. The conclusion is that <b>transhipment</b> can offer substantial operating and capital cost advantages compared with multiport direct call services. The explanation for <b>transhipment</b> advantages relates to diseconomies both at sea and in port associated with multiport style itineraries, coupled with container handling cost and productivity advantages pertaining to pure <b>transhipment</b> terminals, added to enhanced feedership economies of scale. In line with a move towards hub–hub shuttles and associated feeder services, these results indicate that further developments might be expected in regard to offshore <b>transhipment</b> hub terminals being provided as low-cost container transfer points for very large vessels. Policy makers {{need to be aware of}} the net benefits, both ecological and economic, resulting from increased use of offshore <b>transhipment</b> terminals as an alternative to continued artificial development (and duplication) of big ship container terminal capacity within constrained traditional port locations, and any requirement for support thereof.

50|$|Railways could {{supplement}} {{water transport}} and, as Nyasaland was nowhere nearer than 200 miles to a suitable Indian Ocean port, a short rail link to river ports that eliminated porterage was initially more practical than a line direct {{to the coast}} passing through areas of low population. The Shire Highlands Railway opened a line from Blantyre to Chiromo in 1907, and extended it to Port Herald, 113 miles from Blantyre in 1908. After Port Herald became unsatisfactory, the British South Africa Company built the Central African Railway, mainly in Mozambique, of 61 miles from Port Herald to Chindio on the north bank of the Zambezi in 1914. From here, goods went by river steamers to Chinde then by sea to Beira, involving three <b>transhipments</b> and delays.

30|$|Taking {{into account}} the <b>transhipment</b> and third party costs, the rail freight {{operator}} would have to identify ways to reduce to cost.

The interview with P&G suggested that multi-stop train services were not feasible without fast and reliable <b>transhipment,</b> where a freight train stopped in a terminal for only short transit time – much like passenger train station stops. Such faster <b>transhipment</b> was unrealistic using traditional vertical <b>transhipment</b> techniques and equipment (forklift or gantry crane), leading us to recommend that a new <b>transhipment</b> technique would be required to reduce the building and operations cost of a rail terminal.|$|R

It hosts many sailing events including DYS (Derbyshire Youth Sailing). The reservoir {{is owned by the}} Canal & River Trust and, like Combs Reservoir, is a feeder reservoir for Peak Forest Canal.

5000|$|Further {{construction}} of the railway was greatly hampered by a difference in elevation of more than 3000 ft between Chiromo and Blantyre. The difficulties were so severe that the Shire Highlands Railway ran out of funds, with the consequence that another company, the British South Africa Company, assumed the task of completing the section, which was finally opened on 23 January 1909. [...] Additional reductions in the Shire River’s flow made Port Herald unsatisfactory, so a Zambezi port was needed. In 1914, the British South Africa Company built the Central African Railway of 61 miles from Port Herald to Chindio on the north bank of the Zambezi.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} the pricing policy of <b>transhipment</b> route for India to move cargo through Bangladesh from Kolkata port to the capital city of Tripura i. e.

The future opening of Myanmar route further gives some relief to India. Most of the cargo originates from Kolkata (Port) and terminates at Guwahati and distributed to various destinations of north eastern states.

Later the gauge-conversion of carriages on through trains to the broad gauge tracks of the Russian Railways was carried out there. In 1871, the 34 km shorter Schneidemühl-Konitz-Dirschau (now Tczew) line was built parallel, bypassing Bromberg. After the completion of these sections work began with duplicating the line from Küstrin east. The route from Berlin to Kustrin however, was already duplicated. In addition, there were several sections of line built parallel with the main line over short sections.|$|E
50|$|Further {{falls in}} Shire River level made it {{difficult}} and often impossible to use Port Herald, so a Zambezi river port was needed. The British South Africa Company already had a concession to build a railway in Portuguese territory, and in 1912 the Nyasaland government agreed with the Shire Highlands Railway Company Ltd that it would redeem the land it had previously granted to the company for £180,800, and that company would pay this to British South Africa Company {{to assist with the}} construction costs of the Central African railway in exchange for shares in the Central Africa Railway Company Ltd. This railway of 61 mi from Port Herald to Chindio on the north bank of the Zambezi was completed in 1914. From here, river steamers went to Chinde from where sea-going lighters continued to Beira, Mozambique. Although this route allowed Beira’s port to be used, it took two to three weeks from Blantyre, involved three <b>transhipments</b> and exposed goods to the risk of water damage. The Central African Railway was expensive to construct yet poorly built, and soon needed extensive repairs. The Nyasaland government agreed support the line to Chindio financially for ten years, and paid on average £20,000 until 1924.|$|E

All {{direct transit}} rail <b>transhipments</b> between Azerbaijan and Europe or Central Asia (onto China {{and the rest}} of Asia) are via this Ferry (Rail) Terminal. Currently, if {{containers}} are transported to their final destination on a rail platform (without being unloaded and loaded onto a container vessel) they are transferred directly onto a rail platform and use the Ferry Terminal in the New Port. If they are unloaded from a rail platform and then loaded onto a dedicated container vessel, then they come to the old port in downtown Baku. With the completion of Phase One, all such intermodal operations will be done in the new Port of Baku at Alat. The completion of Phase One will also see an overall cargo throughput at the new Port of Baku at Alat of 10-11.5 million tonnes of general cargo and 40,000-50,000 TEU in containers.Phase Two and Phase Three The expansion of the New Port is linked to the increased flow in potential cargo and on the speed of growth of the various business segments. In other words, the decision on when to start the construction of Phase Two and Phase Three will depend on existing cargo volumes. In general, these next phases are likely to follow the PPP (or BOT) type of partnership model, whereby a private party will likely invest, construct and operate these expansions.

30|$|The {{first and}} most {{conspicuous}} step consists in constructing a revised version of the LSBCI. The underlying raw data is obtained from Lloyds List Intelligence (formally Containerisation International On-line) (“Lloyd’s List Intelligence - Containers,” n.d.).

The information is obtained annually, in the month of May. The data covers the reported deployment of all containerships at a given point in time. This methodology allows for comparisons over time, as the “sample” is always complete. UNCTAD started the systematic annual gathering of data in 2004 on the country level and in 2006 on the pair-of-country level. In addition to the LSBCI itself and its components which are defined and discussed in detail in next section, two novel variables are retrieved from this data: a variable indicating the number of <b>transhipments</b> necessary to connect any pair of countries and, the effective maritime distance to be covered between any pair of countries. Note that only {{in the case of a}} direct maritime connection, the effective (computed) maritime distance coincides with sea distance. Note also that information on the number of <b>transhipments</b> necessary to connect any pair of countries is symmetric: if two <b>transhipments</b> are necessary to move containers from country C to country D, then the same number of <b>transhipments</b> is necessary to move containers in the opposite direction from D to C.|$|E
