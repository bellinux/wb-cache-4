40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the diploma thesis there is the task to create a drive concept for an alternative, <b>track-guided</b> <b>vehicle</b> to transport standard sea containers. The challenge is, that actuators are to be used, which are under the current face of points energy-efficient and innovatively and meet the necessary requirements. Due to the variety of work packages, with the responsibilities of the project partners, were defined interfaces, which limit the number of variants by demand boundary conditions. It showed a list of requirements which afterwards fundamental solutions subsequently examined and has been oppose in a comparison of variants. This matrix could be during the work by required calculations to driving resistance, driving power and engine design completed. As a result, the generation was followed of preferred option. In a conceptual design structure that is finally presented...|$|E
