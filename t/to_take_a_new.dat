5|$|Failure {{to qualify}} for the 2010 Stanley Cup playoffs {{resulted}} in changes to the team's management and evaluation structure. Former Tampa Bay Lightning general manager Jay Feaster was hired to serve as an assistant to Darryl Sutter, while three scouts were released by the organization as it planned <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> direction in its amateur scouting.|$|E
5|$|Neither Baldwin III of Jerusalem nor the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos could {{persuade the}} widowed Constance <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> husband. Finally, she chose Raynald of Châtillon, a French knight who had {{recently}} settled in Syria. Raynald ruled the principality as Constance's husband from 1153 until he was captured by Majd al-Din, governor of Aleppo, in late November 1160 or 1161.|$|E
5|$|Felton (Daniel Baldwin) hesitates <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> {{murder case}} because he fears {{it will be}} too {{difficult}} to solve, so it is taken on by his partner Howard (Melissa Leo), who has recently experienced a perfect streak of solving 11 consecutive cases. They investigate the body of a man dead in a basement, and much to Felton's bewilderment, Howard solves the case easily. The owner of the house, Jerry Jempson (Jim Grollman), literally calls her at the house while she is investigating and agrees to a police interview, during which he acts extremely nervous and is eventually charged with the murder.|$|E

5|$|In July 2013 the Sevenstone project, which {{aimed to}} {{demolish}} and rebuild {{a large part}} of the city centre, and had been on hold since 2009, was further delayed and the company developing it was dropped. The city council is looking for partners <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> version of the plan forwards. In April 2014 the council, together with Sheffield University, proposed a plan to reduce the blight of empty shops in the city centre by offering them free of charge to small businesses on a month-by-month basis.|$|E
5|$|In 2014, {{district}} court judge Ricardo Rodriguez campaigned to unseat Guerra as district attorney, and the Garza case arose as a campaign issue. Rodriguez said that he wanted justice for the Garza family. He {{said that he would}} take a new look at Garza's case if he were elected. Rodriguez won the election. In the days after the vote was announced, Guerra sought to appoint Rodriguez as a special prosecutor in the Garza case. Rodriguez declined, saying that he preferred <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> look at the evidence once he took control of the district attorney's office in January 2015. In April, he announced that the Garza case was open again. Without mentioning any suspects or elaborating on new evidence, he said that several employees in his office were working on the case.|$|E
5|$|Before {{leaving the}} band in 1984, Dade Farrar {{introduced}} {{its members to}} Mike Heidorn, the younger brother of his girlfriend; Heidorn then joined the group as their drummer. The Plebes then decided to change its name to The Primitives, {{a reference to a}} 1965 song by psychedelic rock group The Groupies. Due to the unpopularity of punk rock in the St. Louis area, The Primitives began to play blues-oriented garage rock at fast tempos. They performed regularly at a wedding hall in Millstadt, Illinois, where Tweedy's mother Jo Ann would collect the cover fee. They also performed regularly at B St Bar in Belleville with bands such as The Newsboys (later Sammy and the Snowmonkeys), Charlie Langrehr, and The Symptoms. Wade Farrar was the lead singer of the band, but his commitment to Southern Illinois University and an attempted enlistment in the United States Army meant he was only able to dedicate a small amount of time to the group. Additionally, Heidorn broke his collarbone during a concert in 1986, which caused the band to go on hiatus. Jay Farrar and Tweedy continued to write songs and perform at Heidorn's house while he recovered, and by 1987 they had restarted the group. The Primitives temporarily added Tony Mayr as a bassist so that Tweedy could play guitar, but a month later the band decided to keep Tweedy on bass and remain a three-piece. To avoid confusion with a successful British band also named The Primitives, they decided to change their name once again, to Uncle Tupelo. Although they performed only 1960s cover songs as The Primitives, the trio decided <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> approach and write their own music under their new name.|$|E
50|$|The band left RCA Records {{in early}} 1988. Isham left the band to pursue other options {{but was not}} replaced, as the band felt they no longer needed {{keyboards}} and wanted <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>newer</b> and heavier direction. The remaining members began recording <b>a</b> <b>new</b> album in 1988 which they hoped to release sometime the following year, but those plans never occurred {{due to lack of}} any type of label support.|$|R

25|$|Despair – A {{journey into}} the Light (Despair – Eine Reise ins Licht) {{tells the story of}} Hermann Hermann, an {{unbalanced}} Russian émigré and chocolate magnate, whose business and marriage have both grown bitter. The factory is close to bankruptcy, and his vulgar wife is chronically unfaithful. He hatches an elaborate plot <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> identity in the belief it will free him of all his worries. The story of Hermann's descent into madness is juxtaposed against the rise of National Socialism in the Germany of the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} themes of the novel is the comparison between European and American women, which James stresses through the great difference existing between Eugenia and the Wentworth ladies. Madame Münster is independent, modern, and displays hauteur. Gertrude and Charlotte lack this self-possession. For example, they tend to comply with their father's suggestions. When Mr. Wentworth tries to arrange a marriage between Mr. Brand and Gertrude to which she objects, it is difficult for her to clearly express her preference. The sisters spend most of their free time with the family, until the moment in which Gertrude discovers herself to be in love with Felix. Her love encourages her <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> perspective on the world and to resist the presumptions of her family. She reacts against her father's decision regarding Mr. Brand, explaining that she will never marry a man she does not love. Instead, Gertrude will marry Felix and leave America.|$|E

500|$|Animator {{and writer}} Lauren Faust {{approached}} Hasbro, seeking to develop her girls' toys property [...] "Galaxy Girls" [...] into an animated series. Faust, {{who had previously}} worked on Cartoon Network's The Powerpuff Girls and Foster's Home for Imaginary Friends, had been pitching original animation aimed at girls for years, but had always been rejected by studios and networks because cartoons for girls were considered unsuccessful. When she pitched to Lisa Licht of Hasbro Studios, Licht showed Faust one of their recent My Little Pony animated works, , [...] "completely on the fly".

500|$|Startling was {{launched}} on a bimonthly schedule, alternating months with Thrilling Wonder Stories, though in 1940 Thrilling {{moved to a}} monthly schedule that lasted for over a year. [...] The first editor was Mort Weisinger, who had been an active fan in the early 1930s and had joined Standard Magazines in 1935, editing Thrilling Wonder from 1936. [...] Weisinger left in 1941 <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> post as editor of Superman, {{and was replaced by}} Oscar J.

It'll be a mixture of stuff from my long career, stuff from my years with Pink Floyd, some new things.

[...] It is intended that the 44-date Us + Them Tour would visit the United States and Canada, showcase Waters' highlights, start on 26 May 2017 in Kansas City, MO and end on 29 October 2017 in Vancouver, BC.
