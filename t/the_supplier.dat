40|$|This {{research}} studies {{the competition between}} two coexisting suppliers in a two-echelon supply chain. <b>The</b> <b>suppliers</b> have different inventory cost structures (holding cost and setup cost). Each supplier offers one type of the two substitutable products to multiple buyers. Buyers' preferences between the substitutable products differ. Each buyer has a particular order profile (order frequency and quantity). A buyer chooses between <b>the</b> <b>suppliers</b> based on <b>the</b> prices offered by both suppliers and his/her own preference. A Hotelling-type model is used to describe buyers' preferences for the products. We are able to describe the conditions for buyers to switch between <b>the</b> <b>suppliers,</b> and therefore spot the buyer groups {{that may or may}} not switch when <b>the</b> <b>suppliers</b> compete. Pricing strategies for different buyer groups are suggested to <b>the</b> competitive <b>suppliers</b> accordingly. Furthermore, equilibrium prices, market segments, and overall profits for <b>the</b> <b>suppliers</b> are revealed based on Game Theory.

5|$|Although the United States {{remained}} officially neutral until April 1917, it {{was increasingly}} throwing its {{support to the}} Allies through trade. To counter this, German ambassador Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff and Interior Ministry official Heinrich Albert were tasked with undermining American industry and maintaining public support for Germany. One of their agents was a former Bayer employee, Hugo Schweitzer. Schweitzer set up a contract for a front company called the Chemical Exchange Association to buy all of Edison's excess phenol. Much of the phenol {{would go to the}} German-owned Chemische Fabrik von Heyden's American subsidiary; Heyden was <b>the</b> <b>supplier</b> of Bayer's salicylic acid for aspirin manufacture. By July 1915, Edison's plants were selling about three tons of phenol per day to Schweitzer; Heyden's salicylic acid production was soon back on line, and in turn Bayer's aspirin plant was running as well.|$|E

5|$|Most {{people in}} the stadium were unaware that the (first) Ibrox {{disaster}} had happened. People even re-occupied the damaged area, despite the danger of further collapse. A definite reason for the disaster was not agreed upon, partly {{because there was no}} public inquiry held. Some experts blamed the quality of wood and <b>the</b> <b>supplier</b> was tried for culpable homicide, but was acquitted. The design was also cited as a possible cause. Generally, wooden structures of that size were not trusted. Rangers removed the wooden terraces, reducing capacity to 25,000. The criticism of the design did not deter Rangers from hiring Leitch in the future. He designed an expansion of Ibrox to a 63,000 capacity by 1910, using slopes made of earth. By this point, the city of Glasgow had the three largest purpose-built football grounds in the world.|$|E
5|$|The {{collapse}} of the Hananu Revolt marked a significant turning point in Aleppo's political configurations. Whereas prior to the revolt, many in Aleppo's political elite were aligned with Turkish national politics, the betrayal that Aleppo's leaders felt at the withdrawal of Turkish support prompted most of them to embrace and pursue a shared destiny {{with the rest of}} Syria. Many were also influenced by Hananu's support for Syrian unity and strengthening ties with Damascus. In the aftermath of the Franco-Turkish accords, Aleppo's Anatolian hinterland, the major market for its goods and <b>the</b> <b>supplier</b> of its food and raw materials, was ceded to Turkey. This effectively severed commercial relations between Aleppo and Anatolia, harming the former's economy.|$|E

40|$|We model a {{situation}} in which a single firm evaluates competing suppliers and selects just one. Suppliers submit bids involving both price and quality variables. The buyer makes a choice which from <b>the</b> <b>supplier's</b> perspective appears to contain a stochastic element - for example the buyer may have information, which is not shared with <b>the</b> <b>suppliers,</b> and that gives one supplier an advantage in the final choice. We use a discrete choice model of buyer choice (e. g. multinomial logit). Our main result is that <b>the</b> <b>supplier's</b> choice of <b>the</b> quality variables is not affected by the competitive environment. Thus <b>the</b> <b>suppliers</b> compete only on price.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the suppliers’ view of their relation to Stora Enso.

Areas essential for the functioning of the central purchasing unit: - The overall organisation of Stora Enso’s purchasing activities, - Stora Enso’s cross-functional purchasing teams, - The internal coordination and communication, - The relational bonds between Stora Enso and <b>the</b> <b>suppliers</b> Important goals and visions for the central purchasing unit: - Minimising the Total Business Cost, - Being an attractive partner to <b>the</b> <b>suppliers</b> Currently discussed issues within the central purchasing organisation: - The potential for closer cooperation between Stora Enso and <b>the</b> <b>suppliers,</b> - <b>The</b> professionalism of Stora Enso’s purchasers Stora Enso is well organised for purchasing but the centrally coordinated cross-functional teams are not working as well as they could. The internal coordination has improved lately but the central purchasing unit’s mission to optimise for Stora Enso as a whole often creates tension within the organisation, as a result of the mills being profit centres. The internal communication is not efficient, and <b>the</b> <b>suppliers</b> are strengthening their bonds with the mills by taking over the responsibility for certain information flows. The central purchasing unit and the cross-functional teams have the responsibility but not the authority to carry out their task of identifying and reducing the Total Business Cost. Stora Enso is an attractive customer for their suppliers, mainly because of the big volumes they represent. The current negotiation strategies are not advantageous for the introduction of collaborative supplier relations but other factors in the relation between <b>the</b> <b>suppliers</b> and Stora Enso speak strongly in favour for such a strategic change.
