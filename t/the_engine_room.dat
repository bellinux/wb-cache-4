5|$|In December 2002, Chapter XII of the SOLAS {{convention}} was amended {{to require the}} installation of high-level water alarms and monitoring systems on all bulkers. This safety measure quickly alerts watch standers on the bridge and in <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>room</b> in case of flooding in the holds. In cases of catastrophic flooding, these detectors could speed the process of abandoning ship.|$|E
5|$|Passengers {{gathered}} in the third class common room where they could play chess or cards, or walk along the poop deck. Third class children played in the common room or explored the ship—nine-year-old Frank Goldsmith recalled peering into <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>room</b> and climbing up the baggage cranes on the poop deck.|$|E
5|$|Ten {{minutes after}} the first impact, the engines still turning astern, the ship struck again beneath <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>room,</b> tearing open her bottom. She {{instantly}} broke in two just aft of the mainmast. The funnel went over the side and the forepart of the ship sank at once. The stern section, now crowded with men, floated {{for a few minutes}} before sinking.|$|E

5|$|The Yugoslav {{emphasis}} on anti-aircraft defense meant that Split {{could only have}} a single funnel to allow the guns as much freedom to fire as possible, which dictated that the boiler rooms were adjacent to <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>room.</b> This meant that a single torpedo hit in the machinery spaces could immobilize the ship.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} crew numbered 103 {{officers and}} 1,962 enlisted men. The crew {{was divided into}} twelve divisions of between 180 and 220 men. The first six divisions {{were assigned to the}} ship's armament, divisions one to four for the main and secondary batteries and five and six manning anti-aircraft guns. The seventh division consisted of specialists, including cooks and carpenters, and the eighth division consisted of ammunition handlers. The radio operators, signalmen, and quartermasters were assigned to the ninth division. The last three divisions were <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>room</b> personnel. When Bismarck left port, fleet staff, prize crews, and war correspondents increased the crew complement to over 2,200 men. Roughly 200 of <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>room</b> personnel came from the light cruiser , which had been lost during Operation Weserübung, the German invasion of Norway. Bismarcks crew published a ship's newspaper titled Die Schiffsglocke (The Ship's Bell); this paper was only published once, on 23 April 1941, by the commander of the engineering department, Gerhard Junack.|$|E
5|$|Previous {{practices}} had required {{ships to}} withstand the flooding of a single forward hold, but did not guard against situations where two holds would flood. The case where two after (rear) holds are flooded is no better, because <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>room</b> is quickly flooded, leaving the ship without propulsion. If two holds {{in the middle of}} the ship are flooded, the stress on the hull can become so great that the ship snaps in two.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> {{powerful}} <b>engines</b> {{allowed a}} maximum speed of about 40 knots together with reasonable endurance and reliability. There were also three diesel generators. Two main engines and one generator {{were placed in}} <b>the</b> forward <b>engine</b> <b>room,</b> <b>the</b> third main <b>engine</b> and two generators in <b>the</b> aft <b>engine</b> <b>room.</b> There was a control compartment between <b>the</b> two <b>engine</b> <b>rooms.</b>|$|R

The centre allows {{the public to}} drop in and use the computers and equipment for free (on certain days) to teach themselves how to edit video, design websites or screen films at open evenings. Cameras and edit suites can also be hired and day courses on using creative software are run regularly. The founder is Phil Shepherd.

5|$|Unfortunately, {{the turret}} {{layout of the}} Delawares was also retained, with its {{respective}} challenges. Two turrets, Numbers 1 and 2, were mounted fore in a superfiring pair, while the other three were mounted aft of the main superstructure, all on the centerline. The rearmost turret, number 5, {{was placed on the}} main deck, facing rearward, the next turret, Number 4, was placed on the main deck facing forward, but could only have fired on either broadside, it could not have fired straight forward or aft. The center turret, Number 3, placed in a superfiring position facing rearward, could not fire astern when the turret directly under it had its guns trained forward. This left only the rearmost turret, with its pair of 12-inch guns, to cover the rear quarter of the ship. Also, since <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>room</b> was situated between the superfiring rear turret and the ones behind it, steam lines ran from the boiler rooms amidships around the ammunition magazine for Number 3 turret to <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>room.</b> These lines, it was later found, had the potential to heat the powder in the magazine and degrade its ballistics. This design flaw was also prevalent in several British dreadnoughts but was considered inescapable by naval designers on structural grounds.|$|E
5|$|Warrior {{was heavily}} {{damaged by the}} German shells, which caused large fires and heavy flooding, {{although}} <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>room</b> crew - of whom only three survived - kept the engines running for long enough {{to allow her to}} withdraw to the west. She was taken in tow by the seaplane tender HMS Engadine who took off her surviving crew of 743. She was abandoned in a rising sea at 8:25a.m. on 1 June when her upper deck was only 4feet (1.2m) above the water, and subsequently foundered.|$|E
500|$|<b>The</b> <b>engine</b> {{system was}} divided into four <b>engine</b> <b>rooms,</b> all on <b>the</b> centerline. Each room {{contained}} a turbine and two boilers, without any division between the boilers and turbines. This was done to limit the risk of capsizing should the ship sustain heavy flooding in <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>rooms.</b> <b>The</b> <b>engine</b> <b>rooms</b> alternated in their layout: {{the first and third}} <b>engine</b> <b>rooms</b> were arranged with the turbine on the starboard side and its corresponding boilers on the port, this was reversed in the second and fourth <b>rooms.</b> <b>The</b> forward-most <b>engine</b> <b>room</b> powered <b>the</b> starboard outer shaft, the second turbine drove the outer screw on the port side, <b>the</b> third <b>engine</b> supplied power to the inner starboard propeller, and the fourth turbine drove the port-side inner screw. All four screws had four blades; the two outer propellers were [...] in diameter and the inner pair were [...] wide. Steering was controlled by a pair of rudders.|$|R
50|$|There was a leak {{around the}} {{starboard}} shaft, which was five inches out of line; <b>the</b> auxiliary <b>engine</b> <b>room</b> was leaking {{and had two}} feet of water in it; <b>the</b> main <b>engine</b> <b>room</b> was flooded beyond control; six other compartments were ruptured; some compartments were holed through the bottom; the midships fresh water tanks were punctured; and <b>the</b> auxiliary <b>engine</b> <b>room</b> had a four-foot coral head protruding up through the bottom about 10 inches.|$|R
50|$|In 1994 Sand Lance, while moored at Charleston, almost sank next to {{the pier}} ahead {{of one of her}} sister ships, the attack {{submarine}} , due to flooding in <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>room's</b> lower level when a main seawater hull valve was being removed for maintenance. Plates, called blanks, had been placed over her hull penetrations by divers to avoid flooding during removal of the valve but had been placed over the wrong main seawater openings. The flooding was stopped, but not before most of <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>room's</b> lower level was flooded.|$|R
5|$|After being alerted by McCoy, Kirk {{arrives in}} <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>room</b> and discovers Spock dying of {{radiation}} poisoning. The two share a meaningful exchange in which Spock urges Kirk not to grieve, as {{his decision to}} sacrifice his own life to save those of the ship's crew is a logical one, before succumbing to his injuries. A space burial is held in the Enterprise torpedo room and Spock's coffin is shot into orbit around the new planet. The crew leaves {{to pick up the}} Reliant marooned crew from Ceti Alpha V. Spock's coffin, having soft-landed, rests on the Genesis planet's surface.|$|E
5|$|First Officer Hans Oels {{ordered the}} men below decks to abandon ship; he {{instructed}} <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>room</b> crews {{to open the}} ship's watertight doors and prepare scuttling charges. Gerhard Junack, the chief engineering officer, ordered his men to set the demolition charges with a 9-minute fuse but the intercom system broke down and he sent a messenger to confirm the order to scuttle the ship. The messenger never returned and Junack primed the charges and ordered the crew to abandon the ship. Junack and his comrades heard the demolition charges detonate {{as they made their}} way up through the various levels. Oels rushed throughout the ship, ordering men to abandon their posts. After he reached the deck a huge explosion killed him and about a hundred others.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{refitted}} Saien in 1898, partly replacing her existing Hotchkiss guns {{with eight}} quick-firing 6 pounders. While supporting the Imperial Japanese Army following the Battle of Port Arthur {{during the opening}} stages of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–1905, Saien struck a submerged Russian mine on 30 November 1904. Eight crewmen in <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>room</b> were killed immediately by the explosion, with the cruiser sinking rapidly over the following two minutes. During this time only two boats could be launched, saving 70 of the crew, along {{with a collection of}} various items entrusted to them by the officers such as the signal book and some paintings of the Imperial family.|$|E
5000|$|The torpedo {{struck her}} on the port side, {{entering}} <b>the</b> auxiliary <b>engine</b> <b>room</b> and destroying <b>the</b> dynamo and the bulkhead separating <b>the</b> auxiliary <b>engine</b> <b>room</b> from <b>the</b> main <b>engine</b> <b>room.</b> All <b>the</b> lights went out. HMS Bergamot launched a [...] "panic party" [...] in lifeboat no.1, containing 31 men, but the ship lurched to port, both the bow and stern {{rising out of the}} water, and she sank too quickly for the ruse to be successful.|$|R

5|$|As August ended, {{production}} {{continued to}} slip farther behind schedule. Koenig learned {{that rather than}} being released in 14 days after his scenes were completed, his last day would be on October 26—eight weeks later than expected. The next bridge scenes to be filmed after the wormhole sequence, Enterprises approach to V'Ger and the machine's resulting attack, were postponed for two weeks so that the special effects for the scene could be planned and implemented, and <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>room</b> scenes could be shot. Chekov's burns sustained in V'Ger's attack were difficult to film; though the incident took only minutes on film, Weldon spent hours preparing the effect. A piece of aluminum foil was placed around Koenig's arm, covered by a protective pad and then hidden by the uniform sleeve. Weldon prepared an ammonia and acetic acid solution that was touched to Koenig's sleeve, causing it to smoke. Difficulties resulted in the scene being shot ten times; it was especially uncomfortable for the actor, whose arm was slightly burned {{when some of the}} solution leaked through to his arm.|$|E
5|$|Continued poor weather drove New Carissa {{closer to}} the shore. Technical teams from two salvage contractors, Smit International and Salvage Master, had {{been working with the}} Coast Guard since February 5 and had drawn up plans to attempt to refloat the vessel, but when cracks in the hull and oil leaks were {{observed}} on February 8, any refloating attempts were precluded by the focus on preventing of a large-scale oil spill. In addition, Salvage Chief, upon her arrival, was unable to reach New Carissa with her tow gear. On February 10, New Carissa suffered major structural failure when the hull breached near <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>room,</b> flooding the engines with seawater (and thus disabling them). The ship's insurers declared the vessel to be a total loss. As a result, New Carissa was no longer a salvageable vessel; instead, she had effectively become a shipwreck.|$|E
5|$|During gunnery {{training}} on 5 May, {{there was a}} premature detonation in the left gun of Hyūgas Turret No. 5 that disabled both guns and killed 51 crewmen. Both aft magazines were flooded to douse the resulting fire and save the ship. She received temporary repairs during which the turret was removed and replaced by a circular armour plate on which three triple 25mm gun mounts were positioned. On 11 May a valve in Ises No. 2 engine room stuck {{in the open position}} and flooded <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>room.</b> While under repair at Kure, both ships received prototype Type 21 radars. Commanded by Vice-Admiral Shirō Takasu, the 2nd Battleship Division set sail with the Aleutian Support Group on 28 May, {{at the same time that}} most of the Imperial Fleet began an attack on Midway Island (Operation MI).|$|E

5|$|In February 1918, {{the call}} {{went out for}} volunteers to {{participate}} in a special mission to close the port of Zeebrugge using blockships. Although many aboard Australia volunteered their services in an attempt to escape the drudgery of North Sea patrols, only 11 personnel—10 sailors and an engineering lieutenant—were selected for the raid, which occurred on 23 April. The lieutenant was posted to <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>room</b> of the requisitioned ferry , and was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal (DSM) for his efforts. The other Australians were assigned to the boiler rooms of the blockship , or as part of a storming party along the mole. All ten sailors survived—Australia was the only ship to have no casualties from the raid—and three were awarded the DSM, while another three were mentioned in dispatches. One of the sailors was listed in the ballot to receive a Victoria Cross, but he did not receive the award.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to refloat her, Captain Pearce ordered Gothenburg to be {{lightened}} forward. Water casks used as ballast and passengers were positioned aft in an endeavour to refloat her as the tide rose, but without success. Finally, a fatal {{attempt was made to}} refloat her, by reversing the engine hard. The vessel came half off the reef, but holed herself badly and then slewed broadside to the waves, in a much worse position. However, with the tide rising and some cargo now being dumped overboard, all aboard still expected Gothenburg to float free. With strong winds changing direction and seas increasing, the boiler fires were extinguished by water rising through the damaged stern. Around midnight, the chief engineer came on deck to report that <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>room</b> was flooded and the engine was of no further use. With heavy seas now rushing down hatchways and into the cabins, Gothenburg was doomed and Captain Pearce was forced to admit that the situation had become desperate.|$|E
5|$|Napier {{assisted}} in the evacuation of British and Commonwealth troops from the island of Crete in late May, following the successful Axis invasion. On one such occasion the vessel embarked 296 soldiers, three women, one Greek and one Chinese civilian, ten sailors, two children and a dog. Returning to Alexandria, the destroyer came under attack but arrived unscathed. Two days later Napier was less fortunate; having taken 705 soldiers on board, she was targeted on her return journey by a formation of twelve German dive-bombers. The ship was struck twice by bombs and suffered damage to the stern, <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>room</b> and boiler room. One of the aircraft was shot down and a further three damaged. Although no allied casualties were sustained and the destroyer arrived safely in Alexandria, she spent the next two-and-a-half months in Port Said under repair.|$|E

2500|$|On 6 January 1916, King Edward VII — having {{transferred}} her flag temporarily – departed Scapa Flow at 07:12 on {{a voyage}} around the northern coast of Scotland to Belfast, {{where she was}} scheduled to undergo a refit. At 10:47, she struck a mine that had been laid by the German auxiliary cruiser [...] off Cape Wrath. The explosion occurred under <b>the</b> starboard <b>engine</b> <b>room,</b> and King Edward VII listed 8° to starboard. Her commanding officer – Captain Maclachlan – ordered her helm put over to starboard to close the coast and beach the ship if necessary, but the helm jammed hard to starboard and <b>the</b> <b>engine</b> <b>rooms</b> quickly flooded, stopping <b>the</b> <b>engines.</b> Counterflooding reduced her list to 5°.|$|R
