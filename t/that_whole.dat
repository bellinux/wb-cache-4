5|$|The {{earliest}} extant work on astrology that is extensive, coherent, {{and mostly}} intact, the Astronomica describes celestial phenomena, and, in particular, the zodiac and astrology. The poemwhich {{seems to have}} been inspired by Lucretius's Epicurean poem De rerum naturaespouses a Stoic, deterministic understanding of a universe overseen by a god and governed by reason. The fifth book of the Astronomica features a lacuna, which has led to debate about the original size of the poem; some scholars have argued <b>that</b> <b>whole</b> books have been lost over the years, whereas others believe only a small section of the work is missing.|$|E
5|$|Those {{lyrics are}} crazy. I {{listen to that}} like, 'What was she doing?' Pharrell's just so creative, I {{remember}} back then, and he's always kind of been the same.

I look back at <b>that</b> <b>whole</b> record, and I think, 'Wow I wish there was more time to do more singles.' You only get {{so many things that}} people hear.|$|E
5000|$|Nancey Murphy {{has claimed}} {{that there are}} two species of ontological reductionism: one <b>that</b> denies <b>that</b> <b>wholes</b> are {{anything}} more than their parts; and the stronger thesis of atomist reductionism <b>that</b> <b>wholes</b> are not [...] "really real". She admits that the phrase [...] "really real" [...] is apparently senseless but nonetheless has tried to explicate the supposed difference between the two.|$|R

They also promote local agricultures in over 2,400 independent farms to maintain their line of sustainable organic produce. As a result, Whole Foods' high prices do not turn customers away from shopping. In fact, they are pleased buying organic products that come from sustainable practices.|$|E
25|$|The U.S. federal {{government}} document Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010 recommends consumption of three glasses of fat-free or low-fat milk {{for adults and}} children 9 and older (less for younger children) per day. This recommendation is disputed by some health researchers who call for more study of the issue, given {{that there are other}} sources for calcium and vitamin D. The researchers also claim that the recommendations have been unduly influenced by the American dairy industry, and <b>that</b> <b>whole</b> milk may be better for health due to its increased ability to satiate hunger.|$|E
25|$|In {{a fourth}} case, the {{consequences}} of incapacity are more drastic.

The result is the same as it was for companies before reform in 1989, so <b>that</b> <b>whole</b> chains of agreements could be declared as non-existent.|$|E

25|$|A {{study of}} {{informant}} reports by Claude Gilliot concluded the possibility <b>that</b> <b>whole</b> {{sections of the}} Meccan Quran contains elements from or within groups possessing Biblical, post-Biblical and other sources. One such report and likely informant of Muhammad was the Christian slave mentioned in Sahih Bukhari whom Ibn Ishaq named as Jabr for which the Quran's chapter 16: 101-104 was probably revealed. Waqidi names this Christian as Ibn Qumta, with his identity and religious affiliation being contradicted in informant reports. Ibn Ishaq also recounts {{the story of how}} three Christians, Abu Haritha Ibn `Alqama, Al-`Aqib `Abdul-Masih and Al-Ayham al-Sa`id, spoke to Muhammad regarding such Christian subjects as the Trinity.|$|E
25|$|The Itchi–Soretsu {{controversy}} was of {{no interest}} to outsiders, but it kept Nichiren theologians on their toes and forced them to define their positions with more clarity. It did result {{in the formation of}} new sub-sects, but these gave impetus to missionary enterprises which expanded Nichiren Buddhism and helped spread it throughout the country. The number of adherents to Nichiren's teachings grew steadily during the 14th and 15th century to the extent <b>that</b> <b>whole</b> communities became followers. By 1400, and only being outnumbered by Zen, Nichiren temples had been founded all over Kyoto and although the various sects of Nichiren Buddhism were administratively independent they met in a council to resolve common problems.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to Adelphia's coverage being divided up, Time Warner Cable and Comcast {{also agreed to}} exchange {{some of their own}} subscribers in order to consolidate key regions. An example of this is the Los Angeles market, which was mostly covered by Comcast and Adelphia (and some areas of the region already served by TWC), is now under Time Warner Cable. Philadelphia had been split between Time Warner and Comcast, with the majority of cable subscribers belonging to Comcast. Time Warner subscribers in Philadelphia were swapped with Comcast in early 2007. Similarly, the Houston area, which was under Time Warner, was swapped to Comcast, while the Dallas metro area was changed to Time Warner (RR). In the Twin Cities, Minneapolis was Time Warner and Saint Paul was Comcast. <b>That</b> <b>whole</b> market is now Comcast.|$|E
25|$|The Texans {{home opener}} against the Baltimore Ravens was {{initially}} postponed one day from Sunday, September 14, 2008 to Monday, September 15, {{but when the}} extent of the damage from Hurricane Ike became known, the NFL rescheduled the Texans & Ravens game to week 10 (November 9, 2008), which was to have been the bye week for the Ravens and the Texans scheduled home game against the Cincinnati Bengals. That game was rescheduled to week 8 (October 26), which was to have been the bye week for both the Texans and Bengals. The Bengals bye week was moved from October 26 to November 9, originally scheduled for the Ravens. Both the Texans and Ravens took their unexpected bye week in week 2, the weekend Hurricane Ike hit East Texas and the Gulf Coast, despite the fact that both teams were preparing <b>that</b> <b>whole</b> week to play that game as scheduled.|$|E

25|$|In {{his early}} thirties, Ginzberg {{returned}} to Odessa {{where he was}} influenced by Leon Pinsker, {{a leader of the}} Hovevei Zion (Lovers of Zion) movement whose goal was settlement of Jews in Palestine. Unlike Pinsker, Ginsberg did not believe in political Zionism, which he fought, 'with a vehemence and austerity which embittered <b>that</b> <b>whole</b> period'. Instead he hailed the spiritual value of the Hebrew renaissance to counter the debilitating fragmentation (hitpardut) in the diaspora, he believed that the ingathering of Jews in Palestine was not an answer. Kibbutz galuyoth was a messianic ideal rather than a feasible contemporary project. The real answer lay in achieving a spiritual centre, or 'central domicile', within Palestine, that of Eretz Israel, which would form an exemplary model for the dispersed world of Jewry in exile to imitate; a spiritual focus for the circumferential world of the Jewish diaspora. He split from the Zionist movement after the First Zionist Congress, because he felt that Theodor Herzl's program was impractical. From 1889 to 1906, Ginzberg flourished as a preeminent intellectual in Zionist politics.|$|E
25|$|Tim Noakes, {{based on}} an earlier idea by the 1922 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine winner Archibald Hill has {{proposed}} {{the existence of a}} central governor. In this, the brain continuously adjusts the power output by muscles during exercise in regard to a safe level of exertion. These neural calculations factor in prior length of strenuous exercise, the planned duration of further exertion, and the present metabolic state of the body. This adjusts the number of activated skeletal muscle motor units, and is subjectively experienced as fatigue and exhaustion. The idea of a central governor rejects the earlier idea that fatigue is only caused by mechanical failure of the exercising muscles ("peripheral fatigue"). Instead, the brain models the metabolic limits of the body to ensure <b>that</b> <b>whole</b> body homeostasis is protected, in particular that the heart is guarded from hypoxia, and an emergency reserve is always maintained. The idea of the central governor has been questioned since ‘physiological catastrophes’ can and do occur suggesting athletes (such as Dorando Pietri, Jim Peters and Gabriela Andersen-Schiess) can over-ride the ‘‘central governor’.|$|E
25|$|Chief Engineer Alecz Lorhrok is an unjoined Trill, born on {{his home}} planet in the Kalandra Sector on December 11, 2356. Due to his {{youthful}} looks he is often mistaken for an Ensign (rank) or Cadet. After hostilities during the Dominion War around his home planet ended, Lorhrok enlisted in Starfleet {{at the age of}} 18, and obtained a degree in starship design. His first posting was to the USS Steadfast (NCC-1966), where he applied his skills and an unorthodox methodology to keep the old ship in good repair. After the Steadfast was decommissioned, Lorhrok considered requesting a transfer to Utopia Planitia. Instead, he was offered and accepted the position of Chief Engineer on the Excelsior. During the first episode, while the Excelsior was still docked at Starbase 911, Lorhrok tangled with crewwoman Kinash Adow, who subsequently sabotaged Lorhrok's replicator which inadvertently affected all replicators on <b>that</b> <b>whole</b> deck. On the Excelsior 's maiden voyage to the Valendrian system Lorhrok was put in charge of young stow-away Simon Westlake. The role of Lorhrok was portrayed by Ben Randall during Episodes 100 - 102 as well as Episode #3E, and by Sam Gillis in all episodes since.|$|E
