In addition, environmental factors that may contribute to increased <b>TRS</b> <b>emissions</b> were evaluated. It was observed that TRS levels in the vicinity of beef cattle feedlots are not likely to exceed current regulatory thresholds used by midwestern states. It was further noted that concentration of TRS varies with air temperature and time of day. However, wet feedlot surface conditions and wind speed had almost no impact upon observed concentrations...|$|E
40|$|Further {{reducing}} environmental impacts, such as reduced-sulfur emissions, will {{be among}} the major challenges facing the pulp and paper industry in the near future. It will not be easy to further decrease emissions at modern pulp mills because all the major emission sources have already been eliminated. New strategies, such as the prevention of emissions at their source, e. g. by means of improved control of the subsequent processes, will therefore undoubtedly be required in order to conform with the present and also future environmental requirements. An increase in the authorities and public's attention and awareness on environmental issues, together with intensifying interest in artificial intelligence (AI) and intelligent systems, were also prime motivator for this thesis work. The primary objective of the research, which has been carried out as a co-operative effort between academic and industrial parties, has been to lower of the total reduced-sulfur (<b>TRS)</b> <b>emissions</b> from a pulp mill by means of intelligent control techniques. The research was focused on the lime reburning process, {{which is one of the}} main sources of the <b>TRS</b> <b>emissions</b> at modern pulp mills. In addition, the environmental requirements for lime kilns have become tighter and even at well-managed mills, the emissions tend periodically to exceed the limits set by the authorities. It has also been widely recognized that control of the rotary kiln used for lime calcination is, in many respects, a demanding task. So far, most of the kilns have therefore been operated without supervisory-level control system. However, there are outstanding economical and the environmental improveme nt potentials associated with improved control. Hence, supervisory-level control of the lime reburning process is undoubtedly a prospective application for intelligent control techniques. In the first phase of the research, a comprehensive study of the operation of the lime reburning process was carried out at one of the major Finnish pulp mills, with special attention paid to the factors affecting the <b>TRS</b> <b>emissions.</b> The results showed that, in addition to the considerable enhancement potential in the performance of the kiln process operation, improved kiln control is also a feasible means to reduce emissions. An overall supervisory-level control schema that takes into account both the environmental and operational requirements, was then designed on the basis of the results of the study. The supervisory-level control system, embedded with a certain degree of intelligence, was then incrementally developed and implemented at the pulp mill. The control structure combines both feedforward (FF) control models and supervisory-level feedback (FB) controllers that are based on the linguistic equation (LE) approach, strengthened with certain capabilities for adaptation and constraint handling. Advanced capabilities and highly developed functionality of the control system were achieved by combining information from different knowledge sources, and by using appropriate techniques to solve each of the recognized problems. On the other hand, the complexity of the lime reburning process was handled by implementing a modular system structure, and by utilizing an incremental system development approach. The results obtained during extended testing periods of the system demonstrate that the proposed control schema can be successfully realized in an industrial environment, and that it provides quantifiable benefits in both the economical and ecological respect. The major benefit from the ecological point of the view was an almost 30 % decrease in the mean of the <b>TRS</b> <b>emissions</b> and a considerable reduction, about 90 %, in the proportion of peak emission periods. The main verified economical benefits were an increase of about 5 % in the long-term production capacity. Improvements in reburned lime quality and enhancements in energy efficiency were also obtained compared to the situation during manual operation. reviewe...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY: This action {{proposes a}} method for {{measuring}} total reduced sulfur (<b>TRS)</b> <b>emissions</b> from stationary sources. The EPA is making this method available for general use as requested {{by a number of}} source testing companies since it has been allowed for use in the past on a case-by-case basis for kraft pulp mills and refineries. This proposed method would offer advantages over current methods in that real-time data are acquired and testers are allowed to use analyzers and procedures for measuring TRS that are commonly used to measure sulfur dioxide (SO 2). The proposed method would offer an alternative to methods that are currently required.

40|$|The corona and {{transition}} region (TR) are fundamentally coupled through {{the processes of}} thermal conduction and mass exchange. It {{is not possible to}} understand one without the other. Yet the temperature-dependent emissions from the two locations behave quite differently in the aftermath of an impulsive heating event such as a coronal nanoflare. Whereas the corona cools sequentially, emitting first at higher temperatures and then at lower temperatures, the TR is multithermal and the emission at all temperatures responds in unison. We have previously applied the automated time lag technique of Viall & Klimchuk to disk observations of an active region (AR) made by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on the Solar Dynamics Observatory. Lines of sight passing through coronal plasma show clear evidence for post-nanoflare cooling, while lines of sight intersecting the TR footpoints of coronal strands show zero time lag. In this paper, we use the EBTEL hydrodynamics code to demonstrate that this is precisely the expected behavior when the corona is heated by nanoflares. We also apply the time lag technique {{for the first time to}} off-limb observations of an AR. Since <b>TR</b> <b>emission</b> is not present above the limb, the occurrence of zero time lags is greatly diminished, supporting the conclusion that zero time lags measured on the disk are due to TR plasma. Lastly, we show that the "coronal" channels in AIA can be dominated by bright <b>TR</b> <b>emission.</b> When defined in a physically meaningful way, the TR reaches a temperature of roughly 60 % the peak temperature in a flux tube. The TR resulting from impulsive heating can extend to 3 MK and higher, well within the range of the "coronal" AIA channels...|$|R

Covariance and causality are the two faces of the same coin: failing in implementing {{one of the two}} constraints into the model necessarily implies betraying the other one.

40|$|This {{method is}} {{applicable}} to the determination of total reduced sulfur (<b>TRS)</b> <b>emissions</b> from recovery boilers, lime kilns, and smelt dissolving tanks at kraft pulp mills, and from other sources when specified in an applicable subpart of the regulations. The TRS compounds include hydrogen sulfide, methyl mercaptan, dimethyl sulfide, and dimethyl disulfide. The flue gas must contain at least 1 percent oxygen for complete oxidation of all TRS to sulfur dioxide (SO 2). The lower detectable limit is 0. 1 ppm SO 2 when sampling at 2 liters/min for 3 hours or 0. 3 ppm when sampling at 2 liters/min for 1 hour. The upper concentration limit of the method exceeds TRS levels generally encountered at kraft pulp mills. 1. 2 Principle. An integrated gas sample is extracted from the stack. SO 2 is removed selectively from the sample using a citrate buffer solution. TRS compounds are then thermally oxidized to SO 2, collected in hydrogen peroxide as sulfate, and analyzed by the Method 6 barium-thorin titration procedure. Any modification of this method beyond those expressly permitted shall be considered a major modification subject to {{the approval of the}} Executive Officer. The term Executive Officer as used in this document shall mean the Executive Officer of the Air Resources Board (ARB), or his or her authorized representative. 1. 3 Interferences. TRS compounds other than those regulated by the emission standards, if present, may be measured by this method. Therefore, carbonyl sulfide, which is partially oxidized to SO 2 and may be present in a lime kiln exit stack, would be a positive interferant. Particulate matter from the lime kiln stack gas (primarily calcium carbonate) can cause a negative bias if it is allowed to enter the citrate scrubber; the particulate matter will cause the pH to rise and H 2 S to be absorbed prior to oxidation. Furthermore, if the calcium carbonate enters the hydrogen peroxide impingers, the calcium will precipitate sulfate ion. Proper use of the particulate filter described in Section 2. 1. 3 will eliminate this interference...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} line {{profiles}} {{of a range}} of transition region (<b>TR)</b> <b>emission</b> lines observed in typical quiet Sun regions. In magnetic network regions, the Si IV 1402 Å, C IV 1548 Å, N V 1238 Å, O VI 1031 Å, and Ne VIII 770 Å spectral lines show significant asymmetry in the blue wing of the emission line profiles. We interpret these high-velocity upflows in the lower and upper TR as the quiet Sun equivalent of the recently discovered upflows in the low corona above plage regions (Hara et al., 2008). The latter {{have been shown to be}} directly associated with high-velocity chromospheric spicules that are (partially) heated to coronal temperatures and play a significant role in supplying the active region corona with hot plasma (DePontieu et al., 2009. We show that a similar process likely dominates the quiet Sun network. We provide a new interpretation of the observed quiet Sun <b>TR</b> <b>emission</b> in terms of the relentless mass transport between the chromosphere and corona - a mixture of emission from dynamic episodic heating and mass injection into the corona as well as that from the previously filled, slowly cooling, coronal plasma. Analysis of the observed upflow component shows that it carries enough hot plasma to play a significant role in the energy and mass balance of the quiet corona. We determine the temperature dependence of the upflow velocities to constrain the acceleration and heating mechanism that drives these upflows. We also show that the temporal characteristics of these upflows suggest an episodic driver that sometimes leads to quasi-periodic signals. We suggest that at least some of the quasi-periodicities observed with coronal imagers and spectrographs that have previously been interpreted as propagating magnetoacoustic waves, may instead be caused by these upflows.

All but one of the stars observed shows evidence for stellar activity, as defined by the presence of large C II and C IV surface fluxes, with fluxes greater than 100, 000 ergs/sqcm/sec. There is no correlation between surface flux and the stellar rotation rate in the early F dwarfs. The TR surface fluxes increase systematically with decreasing B-V color, with no evidence for any decrease in the activity as the convection zones become very small. It is argued that there is a fundamental difference in the atmospheric heating mechanisms between early F dwarfs and solar-like stars. The heating of the TR in the early F dwarfs may be dominated by acoustic heating...|$|R
30|$|Using {{multiple}} emission lines {{formed at}} {{a wide range}} of temperatures, the differential emission measure (DEM) of the sunspot atmosphere can be derived. Brosius and Landi (2005) found that the DEM curves of two sunspot plumes exhibit peaks at ~  105.6 and ~  105.8 K, respectively. Tian et al. (2009) compared the DEM curves of different regions and found that the DEM curves of the umbra, penumbra and plage regions all peak at a similar temperature around 105.75 K. They also found that the DEM curve of the sunspot plume region peaks at a much lower temperature, ~  105.45 K. The temperature structure revealed through the DEM analysis is consistent with the fact that sunspot plumes usually show greatly enhanced emission of spectral lines formed in the upper TR. For a long time it was unknown why the plume emission was so prominent at upper TR temperatures. Through a detailed analysis of the SUMER spectra, Tian et al. (2009) concluded that the enhanced <b>TR</b> <b>emission</b> of sunspot plumes is most likely caused by a large filling factor.|$|R
40|$|Minimal {{observational}} {{evidence exists}} for fast transition region (TR) upflows {{in the presence}} of cool loops. Observations of such occurrences challenge notions of standard solar atmospheric heating models, as well as their description of bright <b>TR</b> <b>emission.</b> Using the EUV Imaging Spectrometer (EIS) onboard Hinode, we observe fast upflows (v_λ < - 10 km s^- 1) over multiple TR temperatures (5. 8 < T < 6. 0) at the footpoint sites of a cool loop (T < 6. 0). Prior to cool loop energizing, asymmetric flows of + 5 km s^- 1 and - 60 km s^- 1 are observed at footpoint sites. These flows speeds and patterns occur simultaneously with both magnetic flux cancellation (at site of upflows only) derived from the Solar Dynamics Observatory's (SDOs) Helioseismic Magnetic Imager's (HMI) line-of-sight magnetogram images, and a 30 % mass in-flux at coronal heights. The incurred non-equilibrium structure of the cool loop leads to a catastrophic cooling event, with subsequent plasma evaporation indicating the TR as the heating site. From the magnetic flux evolution we conclude that magnetic reconnection between the footpoint and background field are responsible for observed fast TR plasma upflows.

30|$|Sunspots {{are known}} to exhibit {{periodic}} oscillations in both the photosphere and chromosphere. The 3 -min oscillations detected in the chromosphere of sunspots are often suggested to be leakage of p-mode waves from the photosphere. Using SUMER and CDS observations of sunspots, 3 -min oscillations have also been identified in TR lines, suggesting the propagation of the waves further up to the TR (Brynildsen et al. 1999 a, b, 2004 b; Maltby et al. 1999; O’Shea et al. 2002). Some of these studies found signatures of nonlinearity for these waves. Thanks to the high resolution of IRIS observations, waves are clearly observed in both the 1330 and 1400  Å slit-jaw images of IRIS. These passbands sample mainly the <b>TR</b> <b>emission</b> from two C II and Si IV lines in sunspots. Tian et al. (2014 a) performed {{detailed analysis of the}} TR spectra and identified strong signals of shock waves in the TR above sunspots. IRIS observations of these shocks at different layers appear to be consistent with the scenario of upward propagating magnetoacoustic shock waves along inclined magnetic field lines (Madsen et al. 2015). A recent study by Zhao et al. (2016) suggests that these waves can propagate further up into the corona.|$|R
40|$|The {{atmospheric}} structure and energy balance phenomena associated with magnetic {{fields in the}} Sun are reviewed and it is shown that similar phenomena occur in cool stars. The evidence for the weakening or disappearance of transition regions and coronae is discussed together {{with the appearance of}} extended cool chromospheres with large mass loss, near V-R = 0. 80 in the H-R diagram. Like the solar atmosphere, these atmospheres are not homogeneous and there is considerable evidence for plage regions with bright <b>TR</b> <b>emission</b> lines that overlie dark (presumably magnetic) star spots. The IUE observations are providing important information on the energy balance in these atmospheres that should guide theoretical calculations of the nonradiative heating rate. Recent high dispersion spectra are providing unique information concerning which components of close binary systems are the dominant contributors to the observed emission. A recent unanticipated discovery is that the transition lines are redshifted (an antiwind) in DRa (G 2 Ib) and perhaps other stars. Finally, the G and K giants and supergiants are classified into three groups depending on whether their atmospheres are dominated by closed magnetic flux tubes, open field geometries, or a predominately open geometry with a few closed flux tubes embedded...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} the scaling {{properties of the}} long-range temporal evolution and intermittency of SDO/AIA intensity observations in four solar environments: an active region core, a weak emission region, and two core loops. We use two approaches: the probability distribution function (PDF) of time series increments, and multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA). Noise taints the results, so {{we focus on the}} 171 Angstrom waveband, which has the highest signal-to-noise ratio. The lags between pairs of wavebands distinguish between coronal versus transition region (<b>TR)</b> <b>emission.</b> In all physical regions studied, scaling in the range 15 - 45 min is multifractal, and the time series are anti-persistent on the average. The degree of anti-correlation in the TR time series is greater than for coronal emission. The multifractality stems from long term correlations in the data rather than the wide distribution of intensities. Observations in the 335 Angstrom waveband can be described in terms of a multifractal with added noise. The multiscaling of the EUV data agrees qualitatively with the radiance from a phenomenological model of impulsive bursts plus noise, and also from ohmic dissipation in a reduced magnetohydrodynamics (RMHD) model for coronal loop heating. The parameter space must be further explored to seek quantitative agreement. Thus, the observational signatures obtained by the combined tests of the PDF of increments and the MF-DFA offer strong constraints which can systematically discriminate among models for coronal heating.

40|$|Increasing {{evidence}} for coronal heating contributions from cooler solar atmospheric layers, notably quiet Sun (QS) conditions, challenges standard solar atmospheric descriptions of bright transition region (<b>TR)</b> <b>emission.</b> As such, {{questions about the}} role of dynamic QS transients in contributing to the total coronal energy budget are raised. Using observations from the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly and Heliosemic Magnetic Imager on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory, and numerical model extrapolations of coronal magnetic fields, we investigate a dynamic QS transient that is energetically isolated to the TR and extrudes from a common footpoint shared with two heated loop arcades. A non-causal relationship is established between episodic heating of the QS transient and widespread magnetic field re-organization events, while evidence is found favoring a magnetic topology that is typical of eruptive processes. Quasi-steady interchange reconnection events are implicated as a source of the transient's visibly bright radiative signature. We consider the QS transient's temporally stable (≈ 35 minutes) radiative nature to occur {{as a result of the}} large-scale magnetic field geometries of the QS and/or relatively quiet nature of the magnetic photosphere, which possibly act to inhibit energetic build-up processes that are required to initiate a catastrophic eruption phase. This work provides insight into the QS's thermodynamic and magnetic relation to eruptive processes that quasi-steadily heat a small-scale dynamic and TR transient. This work explores arguments of non-negligible coronal heating contributions from cool atmospheric layers in QS conditions and contributes evidence to the notion that solar wind mass feeds off of dynamic transients therein.

40|$|Many {{models for}} coronal loops have {{difficulty}} explaining the observed EUV {{brightness of the}} transition region, which is often significantly less than theoretical models predict. This discrepancy has been addressed {{by a variety of}} approaches including filling factors and time-dependent heating. Here we focus on an effect that has been ignored so far: the absorption of EUV light with wavelengths below 912 Å by the resonance continua of neutral hydrogen and helium. Such absorption is expected to occur in the low-lying transition region of hot, active region loops, that is co-located with cool chromospheric features and called "moss" {{as a result of the}} reticulated appearance resulting from the absorption. We use co-temporal and co-spatial spectroheliograms obtained with SOHO/SUMER and Hinode/EIS of Fe XII 1242 Å, 195 Å and 186. 88 Å, and compare the density determination from the 186 / 195 Å line ratio to that resulting from the 195 / 1242 Å line ratio. We find significant absorption of 195 Å emission caused by the chromospheric inclusions in the moss. We find that the amount of absorption is generally of order a factor of 2. We compare to numerical models and show that the observed effect is well reproduced by 3 D radiative MHD models of the transition region and corona. We use STEREO A/B data of the same active region and find that increased angles between line-of-sight and local vertical cause additional absorption. Our determination of the amount of chromospheric absorption of <b>TR</b> <b>emission</b> can be used to better constrain coronal heating models.

Stellar activity on A and F supergiants has been poorly {{studied in the}} past; primarily because the photospheric continuum dominates any chromospheric (~ 10 4 K) or transition region (TR; ~ 10 5 K) emission lines far into the ultraviolet. FUSE observations of A and F supergiants offer {{one of the best}} methods to study stellar activity on these stars, because many activity indicators longward of 1200 A are swamped by the photospheric continuum emission. We used FUSE FUV spectra to search for 0 VI and C I 11 <b>TR</b> <b>emission</b> lines and obtained data for t Car (A 8 Ib, for 60. 5 ksec, on 2003 Apr 27), 8 Sco (F 1 11, 22. 7 ksec, 2003 Aug 2), ct Per (F 5 Ib, 30. 8 ksec, 2003 Oct l), a UMi (F 7 Ib- 11, 23. 9 ksec, 2003 Oct 14), and y Cyg (F 8 Ib, 25. 8 ksec, 2003 Oct 18).

Analogously, the modern combination of RHESSI and IRIS data can inform the details of heating processes {{in ways that were}} never before possible. We study a small event that was observed with RHESSI, IRIS, SDO, and Hinode, allowing us to strongly constrain the heating and hydrodynamical properties of the flare, with detailed observations presented in a previous paper. Long duration redshifts of TR lines observed in this event, as well as many other events, are fundamentally incompatible with chromospheric condensation on a single loop. We combine RHESSI and IRIS data to measure the energy partition among the many magnetic strands that comprise the flare. Using that observationally determined energy partition, we show that a proper multithreaded model can reproduce these redshifts in magnitude, duration, and line intensity, while simultaneously being well constrained by the observed density, temperature, and emission measure. We comment on the implications for both RHESSI and IRIS observations of flares in general, namely that: (1) a single loop model is inconsistent with long duration redshifts, among other observables; (2) the average time between energization of strands is less than 10 s, which implies that for a HXR burst lasting 10 minutes, there were at least 60 strands within a single IRIS pixel located on the flare ribbon; (3) the majority of these strands were explosively heated with an energy distribution well described by a power law of slope »- 1. 6; (4) the multi-stranded model reproduces the observed line profiles, peak temperatures, differential emission measure distributions, and densities...|$|R

We compare the SUMER spectra observed in the umbra, penumbra, plage, and sunspot plume regions. The Lyman line profiles averaged in each region are presented. For the sunspot observed in 2006, the electron densities, DEM, and filling factors of the TR plasma in the four regions are also investigated. The self-reversals of the Lyman line profiles are almost absent in umbral regions at different locations (heliocentric angle up to 49 ^∘) on the solar disk. In the sunspot plume, the Lyman lines are also not reversed, whilst the lower Lyman line profiles observed in the plage region are obviously reversed. The TR densities of the umbra and plume are similar and one order of magnitude {{lower than those of}} the plage and penumbra. The DEM curve of the sunspot plume exhibits a peak centered around (T/K) ∼ 5. 45, which exceeds the DEM of other regions by one to two orders of magnitude at these temperatures. We also find that more than 100 lines, which are very weak or not observed anywhere else on the Sun, are well observed by SUMER in the sunspot, especially in the sunspot plume. We suggest that the TR above sunspots is higher and probably more extended, and that the opacity of the hydrogen lines is much smaller above sunspots, as compared to the TR above plage regions.

Seven test cases were performed.
