500|$|Ratchet & Clank was {{met with}} {{positive}} reviews from critics upon release. After playing {{a preview of the}} game, GameSpot described it as having [...] "excellent graphics, varied gameplay, and tight control". The game's use of weapons, rather than simple melee attacks, was cited as one of the main features that made it stand out from other platform games; Computer and Video Games said that [...] "Going berserk with your giant ratchet [...] is seriously satisfying [...] Every time you thump an enemy with the hefty tool, it looks, sounds and feels remarkably solid. [...] What's more, {{the same can be said}} for all the other weapons you collect and use over <b>the</b> <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>your</b> intergalactic adventure". GameSpot noted that the player does not need to follow the same paths multiple times, as was common in platformers at the time. Gameplanet said that it was [...] "Quite simply the best platform game on the PS2 right now and possibly the best on any format!" ...|$|E

5000|$|If {{the breakup}} is the appetizer, <b>the</b> main <b>course</b> <b>of</b> <b>Your</b> Problem with Men is Asun’s {{struggle}} with the solitude of being single, which lends a couple of smart monologues to a bottle of tequila and a hilarious delusion of Jane Eyre.

5000|$|Bursey {{and several}} others {{traveled}} into the heartland by dog team on two missions. One was to mark a safe trail and leave caches of supplies over the 200 miles of treacherous crevasses and open chasms between the main base and the Queen Maud mountain range where the geological party would make camp and conduct their studies. The other was to provide ground support for Byrd by erecting beacons every 50 miles and depositing emergency supplies at them in case Byrd’s plane crashed when he attempted to fly over the pole. Bursey’s lead dog, St. Lunaire, blazed the trail. Byrd sent them off with: “Boys I would rather never fly over the South Pole than to lose one of you.

I now understand them with sufficient clearness to be fully convinced of their excellence, and in future I intend to act upon them, without any exception or deviation. To prove my sincerity, I have determined to commence the new system at once; and as I think that, without some extension of our international relations, the commercial interest of this island will be incapable of furnishing the taxes which I intend to levy, I have determined, therefore, to fit out an expedition for the purpose of discovering new islands and forming relations with new islanders. It is but due to your merit that you should be appointed to the command of it; and further to testify my infinite esteem for your character, and my complete confidence in your abilities, I make you post-captain on the spot.
