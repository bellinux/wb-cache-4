5|$|In some {{bacteria}} and archaea, ATP synthesis {{is driven by}} the movement of sodium ions through the cell membrane, rather than the movement of protons. Archaea such as Methanococcus also contain the A1Ao synthase, a form of the enzyme that contains additional proteins with little similarity in sequence to other bacterial and eukaryotic ATP synthase subunits. It is possible that, in some species, the A1Ao form of the enzyme is a specialized sodium-driven ATP synthase, but <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> be true in all cases.|$|E
5|$|Kant {{believed}} that the Categorical Imperative provides us with the maxim that {{we ought not to}} lie in any circumstances, even if we are trying to bring about good consequences, such as lying to a murderer to prevent them from finding their intended victim. Kant argued that, because we cannot fully know what the consequences of any action will be, the result might be unexpectedly harmful. Therefore, we ought to act to avoid the known wrong—lying—rather than to avoid a potential wrong. If there are harmful consequences, we are blameless because we acted according to our duty. Driver argues that <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> be a problem if we choose to formulate our maxims differently: the maxim 'I will lie to save an innocent life' can be universalized. However, this new maxim may still treat the murderer as a means to an end, which we have a duty to avoid doing. Thus we may still be required to tell the truth to the murderer in Kant's example.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{founding}} of the republic, most of the powers of the Curiate Assembly were transferred to the Centuriate Assembly and the Tribal Assembly. While it then fell into disuse, it did retain some theoretical powers, most importantly, the power to ratify elections of the top-ranking Roman Magistrates (Consuls and Praetors) by passing the statute that gave them their legal command authority, the lex curiata de imperio. In practice, however, they actually received this authority from the Centuriate Assembly (which formally elected them), and as such, this functioned as nothing more than a reminder of Rome's regal heritage. Other acts that the Curiate Assembly voted on were mostly symbolic and usually in the affirmative. At one point, possibly as early as 218 BC, the Curiate Assembly's thirty Curia were abolished, and replaced with thirty lictors, one from each of the original Patrician clans. Since the Curia had always been organized {{on the basis of the}} Roman family, the Curiate Assembly actually retained jurisdiction over clan matters even after the fall of the Roman Republic in 27 BC. Under the presidency of the Pontifex Maximus, it witnessed wills and ratified adoptions, inaugurated certain priests, and transferred citizens from Patrician class to Plebeian class (or vice versa). In 44 BC, for example, it ratified the will of Julius Caesar, and with it Caesar's adoption of his nephew Gaius Octavian (the future Roman emperor Augustus) as his son and heir. However, <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have been the comitia curiata but instead the comitia calata.|$|E

25|$|The coolant water must {{be highly}} {{pressurized}} to remain liquid at high temperatures.

Eventually the ductility of the steel will reach limits determined by the applicable boiler and pressure vessel standards, and the pressure vessel must be repaired or replaced. <b>This</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> be practical or economic, and so determines the life of the plant.|$|E
25|$|If in {{fact there}} was no third road wheel, the chariot might have functioned as a compass if turns were always made so {{that one of the}} two wheels was {{stationary}} and only the other rotated, with the pointing doll connected to it by gears. The charioteer could have kept the stationary wheel from turning by controlling the horses appropriately. (A brake would have helped, but {{there is no mention of}} one in the description.) The radius of the curve around which the rotating wheel moved would have equalled the track-width of the chariot, and the gears turning the doll would have been chosen accordingly. This design would have worked as a compass for short journeys, but would have suffered from cumulative errors if used for long ones. Also, the chariot would have been slow and awkward to turn. <b>This</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> have mattered if turns were rarely executed.|$|E

25|$|The New York Times, however, {{reported}} that {{it was unlikely that}} NBC would get baseball, as the network would have to preempt up to three weeks of NFL coverage on Sunday nights. However, the NFL used to not schedule a Sunday night game on the second night of the World Series, which meant that NBC gaining the rights was not completely out of the question (however, the following Sunday, in which a possible World Series Game 7 is scheduled, a Sunday night NFL game is also scheduled). In addition to this, other Sunday playoff games, such as the ALCS and NLCS could be pushed to the afternoon. <b>This</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> be appetizing to league officials, as major playoff games would go up head-to-head against highly rated afternoon NFL games (as opposed to today's system, in which only one game out of two for the day would go up against network NFL broadcasts).|$|E
25|$|The social {{sharing of}} {{emotions}} {{is an important}} source of interpersonal interaction, social integration, and forming positive and durable relationships. In fact, many people engage in sharing behaviors in order to have such social interactions and strengthen their relationships (as described above). However, <b>this</b> <b>might</b> <b>not</b> result from the sharing of certain emotional events. When asked why they would keep an emotional event a secret, the most frequent reasons cited were: wanting to avoid hurting someone, preserving one’s image in the eyes of others, protecting one’s private life, and protecting one’s self. Such reasons, which together constituted the responses of over 75% of participants, all concern one thing: protection. According to Baumeister and Leary, this idea of protection pertains to protection from undesirable consequences {{in the realm of the}} social sphere, namely that the revelation of such secrets would be harmful to social relationships. Therefore, instead of social integration and the strengthening of relationships, the revelation of certain emotional events could be harmful to a relationship and could thus result in social disintegration and deterioration of relationships.|$|E

On {{the question of}} amateurism, Maraniss suggests that Brundage was [...] "caught in a vise" [...] between communist and capitalist states pursuing dissimilar goals; nations following either system were not willing to accept Brundage's vision of pure amateurism, and broke those rules, each system in its own way. Guttmann notes that in the 1960s, Brundage may have been better-known as an art collector than for his sports activities, and [...] "there are those who maintain {{that he will be}} remembered not for his career in sports but for his jades and bronzes." [...] Andrew Leigh, a Member of the Australian House of Representatives, criticizes Brundage for expelling the two athletes in Mexico City, calling him [...] "a man who'd had no difficulty with the Nazi salute being used in the 1936 Olympics". Dick Pound believes Brundage to {{have been one of the}} IOC's great presidents, along with deCoubertin and Samaranch, but concedes that by the end of his term, Brundage was out of touch with the world of sports.
