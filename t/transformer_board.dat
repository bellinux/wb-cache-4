50|$|<b>Transformer</b> <b>board</b> is used {{mainly in}} {{oil-filled}} transformers where a solid insulating structure is needed. This is a pressboard up to 8 mm in thickness. The board is built up wet on forming cylinders {{and cut off}} when at the desired thickness. This makes a sheet {{with the size of}} the width and circumference of the drum. The wet sheets are hot- or cold-press dried and finished on separate machines.|$|E

50|$|The use {{of paper}} board as {{electrical}} insulation paper {{started in the}} early-mid 20th century. Since the need for high voltage electrical transformers, {{there has been a}} need for an insulating material that could withstand the high electrical and physical stresses experienced around a core and windings. Pressboard, a board made by compressing layers of paper together and drying them, has been used for installation purposes in many of the first electrical machines. However, as electrical technology increased, the need for a higher density material that was capable of insulating larger and higher voltage transformers grew. In the late 1920s, Hans Tschudi-Faude became the director of H. Weidmann Limited and began developing a type of pressboard that would meet the higher standards needed for the newer, more powerful transformers. Unlike older methods of pressboard production, Transformerboard was not based on used paper or cotton waste but was made with high-grade sulfate cellulose. The new product was made purely out of cellulose without a resin or binder, improving electrical insulation capabilities and could be completely dried, degassed, and oil impregnated. The new product became famous under the name Transformerboard. Throughout the 1930s, new methods of production and advances in understanding replaced almost all insulating parts of transformers with parts made from <b>transformer</b> <b>board.</b>|$|E
40|$|Despite recent advancements in {{material}} technology, oil-cellulose insulation systems {{in form of}} so called <b>Transformer</b> <b>board</b> combined with paper and mineral oil are {{still one of the}} backbones of high voltage technology. This insulation system is widely used in the high voltage industry, especially in high voltage transformers for AC and HVDC applications, e. g. converter transformers.

40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} aimed at the study of aging {{behavior}} of cellulosic materials in different dielectric liquids under air and nitrogen atmospheres. Paper for copper conductor and high density <b>transformer</b> <b>board</b> were aged at 130 °C up to 1128 h in sealed vessels in presence of mineral oil (MO), natural ester (VO) and synthetic ester (SE). The influence of thermal aging on cellulose and oil characteristics are investigated and compared. It's observed that the paper degradation {{is associated with the}} generation of CO 2 and CO gases. Whatever the type of oil, this generation is more important with vessel under air atmosphere than that under nitrogen gap indicating a protective effect of nitrogen. In mineral oil, the degree of polymerization (DPv) reaches the end of life criteria at around 200 whereas it remains around 400 with ester oils. This is mainly due to the higher water solubility of esters compared to mineral oil. The measured degree of polymerization in MO is comparable to that calculated through 2 -FAL (Furanic compounds) content using Vuarchex equation whereas for esters oil, there is no agreement between the measured and calculated DPv through 2 -FAL content. This can constitute a limitation in the use of 2 -FAL for the diagnosis of ester-filled transformers. Overall, the insulation cellulose/oil behavior seems better under nitrogen atmosphere...|$|E

50|$|A {{disaster}} befell Spaulding Fibre Company when in 1944 {{when the}} North Rochester plant burned. It was rebuilt and reopened in 1946. Huntley N. Spaulding, the last surviving son of Jonas Spaulding, set the cornerstone for the rebuilt mill. When the mill was rebuilt {{it was designed}} to make <b>transformer</b> insulation <b>board.</b> At the time of its reopening it was hailed as the most modern fibreboard plant in the world. The plant in North Rochester served as the center for the Spaulding Brothers, and the company's corporate offices remained in Rochester until after Huntley's death on November 11, 1955, after which they were relocated to Tonawanda in 1960. After Huntley's death, Spaulding Fibre Company became part of a charitable trust that Huntley and his only sister Marion S. Potter had set up to disperse their remaining wealth within 15 years of the last to die. Marion S. Potter followed her brother in death on September 27, 1957.|$|R
40|$|The authors {{report the}} use of a {{coreless}} printed circuit <b>board</b> <b>transformer</b> for power conversion with very high power density and efficiency. A coreless PCB transformer with an outermost radius of ∼ 1 cm and 19 turns for both the primary and secondary windings can transfer 19 W at an efficiency of 90 %, resulting in a record power density of 24 W/cm 2. The power density and energy efficiency of a coreless PCB transformer are higher than those of core-based microtransformers.

40|$|The power {{requirements}} of automotive alternators are increasing significantly {{due to the}} introduction of new vehicle electrical loads. Moreover, the possible transition to a 42 V electrical system is introducing new concerns regarding the load dump overvoltage transient of alternators. This thesis makes several contributions to the power density, efficiency, and transient performance of future alternators. A comparison and design optimization of four alternator types is conducted to identify the least cost alternator that meets the challenging requirements of future automobiles. Alternator designs with conventional diode rectifiers and switched-mode rectifiers are investigated. It is found that optimized Lundell alternators are capable of meeting the demands of future systems, and that wound field synchronous machines may also be competitive. It is also found that incorporation of a simple switched-mode rectifier enables substantial improvements in designs optimized for their use. The behavior of the Lundell alternator under load dump transient conditions is studied. It is found that rotor eddy currents limit {{the rate at which the}} machine can be de-excited to terminate the transient overvoltage. Models for the de-excitation process are developed based on experimental measurements, and new field control circuits are proposed that provide fast field de-excitation. (cont.) The use of foil field windings in Lundell alternators to improve alternator power density is also explored. Foil field windings are shown to provide higher conductor packing factors than conventional wire wound fields (e. g. 73 % as opposed to 64 % for a typical wire wound design) and offer improved thermal transfer properties. These advantages are demonstrated to enable significant increases in field ampere turns and achievable alternator output power. However, realizing these advantages requires new field excitation circuits that can deliver high field currents at low voltages, without exceeding the limited current ratings of alternator brushes. Two new field excitation circuits capable of meeting the needs of foil field windings are developed and experimentally demonstrated. The first field excitation circuit is based on the use of a coreless printed circuit <b>board</b> <b>transformer</b> with a rotating secondary for contactless transfer of power to the rotor. A stationary inverter delivers high frequency ac to the transformer primary, and the power received by the transformer secondary is rectified and delivered to the field. This approach eliminates the need for brushes, and their associated wear and current limitations. (cont.) This rotating transformer topology is designed, built and tested at standstill with a foil wound bobbin. Experimental results demonstrate that a 51 % increase in ampere turns on the rotor can be delivered with this approach, which is more than sufficient for practical applications. The second class of field excitation circuits developed in this thesis uses a DC/DC converter on the rotating side to provide a step down in voltage and a step up in current for the foil field. Control information is communicated to the rotating converter to regulate the field. An experimental alternator implementing a foil field winding and this excitation circuit is developed and experimentally validated. Tests at idle speed demonstrate an improvement of 15 % in alternator output power, and an approximate increase of 30 % in field ampere turns for similar temperature limits. It is anticipated that significantly larger power improvements could be achieved if the alternator stator were redesigned to take advantage of this improved field capability. by Leandro Manalac Lorilla.
