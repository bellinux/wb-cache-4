40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe implementation of <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> item <b>description</b> (CID) program {{is one of}} DoD's attempts to improve <b>the</b> acquisition of <b>commercial</b> and commercial-type products. CIDs provide the Contracting Officer with a means to solicit for commercial products using a generic description consisting of salient characteristics of products available in <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> marketplace. This thesis addresses the benefits and inhibitors {{to the use of}} CIDs at Defense Logistics Agency (DLA) Supply Centers. Data were collected from DLA employees and Government contractors to determine the perceived benefits and inhibitors. Based on this research, it is recommended that the parameters for the use of CIDs be expanded and continued education of the acquisition workforce regarding the CID program be held.

40|$|This {{illustrated}} essay {{explores the}} idea of the type specimen historically as a way of contextualising issues surrounding the production of a type specimen within the current markets. The essay’s critical contribution is to broaden <b>the</b> limited <b>commercial</b> <b>description</b> of specimen material typical within the field by drawing together a range of perspectives. The type specimen is interrogated not only as design object and branding exercise but also in terms of its role within academic scholarship and as a tool of craft-based discipline and trade. A functional link is made with the other lettering trades of stone-cutting and calligraphy. In 'Showing Type' I was able to explore the relationship between technology and the contemporary market, discursively outlining issues relating to {{the idea of}} the artefact within the increasingly intangible context of online product design. Located within a type specimen itself, this writing intentionally plays with traditions of design and scholarship within <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> typographic sphere. A model for authoritative information-giving as a reinforcement of quality and worth borrowed from early twentieth century specimen examples is here reworked to explore appropriately the ideas of 'value' and 'collectability' reflected through the idiosyncratic use of a book format...|$|R
40|$|We give a {{presentation}} of a trace-based semantics of Core ELLA, a covering subset of <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> hardware <b>description</b> language ELLA, using a synchronous process algebra called ELLA PROCESS ALGEBRA (EPA). This report is a semantics reference manual for ELLA, giving a detailed definition of the behaviour of ELLA expressions on a construct by construct basis. EPA is an instantiation of a generic Process Algebra Framework (PAF). It supports parameterised process calls, and has highly structured actions representing pairs of input/output maps labelling its transitions. The EPA process terms reprsenting ELLA are constructed compositionally following the structure of ELLA expressions. Primitive terms, corresponding to atomic operations in ELLA, are assembled using a small set of process operators. In particular the parallel composition operator models synchronous communication between components and is effected by a special product operation on actions. The EPA terms resulting fr [...] ...|$|R
40|$|In a {{previous}} study the thermal and polymorphic behavior of four different industrial lauric fats which are sold under <b>the</b> same <b>commercial</b> <b>description,</b> was compared (1). According to the findings the four fats were split in two groups based on the similarities found at polymorphic level. In the present paper two of these industrial lauric fats (F 1 and F 2, one from each group) were incorporated into oil -in -water emulsions. The objective {{of this study was}} to point out the differences in the crystallization and polymorphic behavior between bulk and emulsified fat. Moreover anhydrous milk fat (AMF) was used in the same way for comparison. For that purpose, the fats were investigated for their thermal and polymorphic behavior by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and X-ray diffraction (XRD), both in bulk and emulsified state. The DSC and X -Ray investigations made possible the observation of the differences in the crystallization behavior and kinetics that occurred for those fats in the bulk and emulsified state. 1.

40|$|The beer {{industry}} {{is one of}} the largest moneymaking industries in the U. S., and is one that spends a significant amount of money on advertising expenditures. While beer companies traditionally target men in their advertisements, particularly those aired during televised sporting events, the female audience is practically ignored, although it is one that is growing in importance due to the increase in women as beer drinkers and sports fans. The objectives of this study are to: (1) determine the extent to which females are targeted as potential consumers in beer advertising aired during Super Bowl broadcasts from 2011 - 2015; (2) examine the representations of men and women in these commercials; and (3) understand the impact that these beer commercials had on consumers in terms of how the content applied to them and whether they felt compelled to buy or drink the advertised beer. A content analysis of 19 Bud Light and Budweiser commercials aired during Super Bowls from 2011 to 2015 was conducted to understand <b>the</b> <b>commercial</b> content and representations of characters. The sample was then narrowed to five commercials – one from each year – and a survey was conducted with 100 respondents who watched and analyzed each <b>commercial.</b> <b>The</b> survey discussed whether men or women were the primary targets in <b>the</b> <b>commercials,</b> whether respondents felt <b>the</b> <b>commercials</b> were engaging and appealing, the perceived messages of <b>the</b> <b>commercials,</b> respondents’ <b>descriptions</b> of <b>the</b> characters, and details about the respondents regarding their affinity to beer and sports. In general, the research found that although women were present in <b>the</b> majority of <b>commercials,</b> respondents viewed them as pretty or sexy background characters rather than as primary targets or consumers. Very few respondents agreed that <b>the</b> <b>commercials</b> targeted a female audience. The men, on the other hand, were viewed as main characters in <b>the</b> <b>commercials</b> and were overwhelmingly seen as the primary audience for <b>the</b> <b>commercials.</b> <b>The</b> research also found that despite respondents finding <b>the</b> <b>commercials</b> visually engaging, few felt the content was applicable to them and even fewer felt compelled to buy or drink the advertised beer after watching <b>the</b> <b>commercials...</b>|$|R
