5|$|Station to Station is {{the tenth}} studio album by English {{musician}} David Bowie, released by RCA Records in 1976. Commonly {{regarded as one}} of his most significant works, Station to Station was <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>for</b> his performance persona, the Thin White Duke. The album was recorded after he completed shooting Nicolas Roeg's The Man Who Fell to Earth, and the cover artwork featured a still from the movie. During the sessions Bowie was heavily dependent on drugs, especially cocaine, and later claimed that he recalled almost nothing of the production.|$|E
5|$|The Wreck {{experienced}} a major transition of ownership after the Centennial Celebration. Since Reck Club had financially maintained <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>for</b> {{so long and}} Reck Club fell under the Dean of Students rather than the Athletic Association, the vehicle was sold from the Athletic Association to the Institute for zero dollars in 1987. The transaction further solidified Reck Club's responsibilities over the car but also made the car more than simply a football mascot. The Old Ford was officially an Institute icon.|$|E
5|$|The {{due process}} clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments apply {{generally}} to {{all stages of}} criminal proceedings. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment was <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>for</b> the incorporation {{of all of the}} foregoing rights (with the exception of the Grand Jury Clause, the Vicinage Clause, and maybe the Excessive Bail Clause) to apply in state criminal proceedings. Due process is also the catchall vehicle for the enforcement of fundamental fairness, even if the infirmities of a given prosecution do not neatly sound in another enumerated provision.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Design the {{structure}} of <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> system <b>for</b> overturning prevention {{and set up the}} system dynamic model. Based on the Matlab/Simulink, establish the dynamic simulation system of <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> system <b>for</b> overturning prevention for the Chery A 3 car. Using the brake / drive integrated ESP control principle, based on the simulation model, respectively simulate and analyze the ESP control performances of <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> system and <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> system <b>for</b> overturning prevention on different simulation conditions. The study results indicate that when there is no ESP control or ESP control system failure, <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> system <b>for</b> overturning prevention can simulate the ESP control performances of <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> system effectively, <b>the</b> ESP control performances of <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> system and <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> system <b>for</b> overturning prevention have remarkable consistency. The theory of <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> system <b>for</b> overturning prevention for the ESP control performances test provides a basis <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> stability control performance research. ...|$|R

5|$|Trooper Harper's {{official}} reports {{state that}} after he stopped the Pontiac, he ordered Acoli {{to the back of}} <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>for</b> Trooper Foerster—who had arrived on the scene—to examine his driver's license. The reports then state that after Acoli complied, and as Harper was looking inside the vehicle to examine the registration, Trooper Foerster yelled and held up an ammunition magazine as Shakur simultaneously reached into her red pocketbook, pulled out a nine-millimeter weapon and fired at him. Trooper Harper's reports then state that he ran to the rear of his car and shot at Shakur who had exited the vehicle and was firing from a crouched position next to the vehicle.|$|E

25|$|Mudflaps are now rarely {{specified}} {{as standard}} on production cars as they {{interfere with the}} clean airflow around <b>the</b> <b>vehicle.</b> <b>For</b> larger vehicles such as trucks, mud flaps are still important for their control of spray, and in 2010 {{a new version of}} the mud flap was introduced that has been shown to create significantly less aerodynamic drag than standard mud flaps.|$|E
25|$|The {{standard}} contains ergonomic {{requirements and}} design specifications {{for the patient}} compartment, and also places practical restrictions on the physical lifting of patients {{in and out of}} <b>the</b> <b>vehicle,</b> <b>for</b> safety reasons.

25|$|Passive sonar on {{vehicles}} {{is usually}} severely limited because of noise generated by <b>the</b> <b>vehicle.</b> <b>For</b> this reason, many submarines operate nuclear reactors {{that can be}} cooled without pumps, using silent convection, or fuel cells or batteries, which can also run silently. Vehicles' propellers are also designed and precisely machined to emit minimal noise. High-speed propellers often create tiny bubbles in the water, and this cavitation has a distinct sound.|$|E

25|$|Hawthorne's fiction had a {{profound}} impact on his friend Herman Melville (1819–1891), who first made a name for himself by turning material from his seafaring days into exotic sea narrative novels. Inspired by Hawthorne's focus on allegories and psychology, Melville went on to write romances replete with philosophical speculation. In Moby-Dick, an adventurous whaling voyage becomes <b>the</b> <b>vehicle</b> <b>for</b> examining such themes as obsession, the nature of evil, and human struggle against the elements.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} I propose a {{framework}} {{to study the}} causal relationships between public and mental representations in culture.

In the evolutionary system of forms, public representations such as artifacts and behaviours are <b>the</b> <b>vehicles</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> replication of mental representations. In the evolutionary system of skills, cultural skills such as the ability to interact linguistically, socially or technologically in a society are <b>the</b> <b>vehicles</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> replication of observable features of public representations. The resulting combination must increase human fitness, since natural selection has favoured genes that provide culture with the neural substrate it needs...|$|R
