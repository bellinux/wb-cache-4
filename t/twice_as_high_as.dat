5|$|The {{triangular}} pediment depicts {{sculptures of}} plants and geometrical figures. The staircase has nine unusually high steps— high, about <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> the average height of stairs. Tananyan suggests that the unusually high stairs compel a person ascending the staircase to feel humbled and make physical effort to reach the altar. On the {{both sides of the}} staircase there are roughly square pedestals. Atlas, the Greek mythological Titan who held up the earth, is sculpted on both pedestals in a way seemingly trying to hold the entire temple on its shoulders. It is assumed that, originally, pedestals held up altars (sacrificial tables).|$|E

5|$|This {{interpretation}} {{was questioned}} by François Therrien and colleagues (2005), {{who found that}} the biting force of Carnotaurus was <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> that of the American alligator, which may have the strongest bite of any living tetrapod. These researchers also noted analogies with modern Komodo dragons: the flexural strength of the lower jaw decreases towards the tip linearly, indicating that the jaws were not suited for high precision catching of small prey but for delivering slashing wounds to weaken big prey. As a consequence, according to this study, Carnotaurus must have mainly preyed upon large animals, possibly by ambush.|$|E
5|$|A 2010 {{study of}} the stream found that the Fonteyn Kill's {{specific}} conductance, {{a measure of the}} amount of dissolved road salt in the stream's water, was nearly 1.0 mS/cm, higher than any value recorded in the Casperkill. Sites upstream of Vassar Lake were recorded in a separate study as having specific conductances <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> locations downstream of the lake, suggesting a regulating effect caused by water mixing and retention in Vassar Lake. The total inorganic nitrogen in the kill, which is usually correlated with surrounding green cover, was about , average for measurements taken in the Fonteyn Kill and Casperkill in that study. The study also found that the Fonteyn Kill's score on the Hilsenhoff family biotic index (HBI), a scale measuring pollution based on the tolerance of endemic benthic macroinvertebrates, was approximately six, indicating fairly poor water quality, with scores {{for the rest of the}} Casperkill–Fonteyn Kill watershed were as high as seven (poor water quality) to as low as four (very good water quality).|$|E

5|$|Kentrosaurus can be {{distinguished}} from {{other members of the}} Stegosauria by a number of osteological characters. Mallison (2011) provided a revised diagnosis, an updated list of distinguishing traits or autapomorphies. Most notably, the neural spines, the blade-like upper extensions of the vertebrae, in the tail do not run sub-parallel, as in most dinosaurs. In the front third of the tail, they point backwards, the usual direction. In the middle tail, however, they are almost vertical, and further back they are hook-shaped and point obliquely forward. Also typical is that the dorsal (back) vertebrae have a neural arch more than <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> the centrum, the vertebral body, and almost completely occupied by the extremely spacious neural canal. The preacetabular process, front blade, of the ilium widens laterally, to the front outer side, and does not taper.|$|E
5|$|Frederick William's {{excise tax}} (Akzise), which since 1667 {{replaced}} {{the property tax}} raised in Brandenburg for Brandenburg-Prussia's standing army with the estates' consent, was raised by the elector without consultation of the estates. The conclusion of the Second Northern War had strengthened the elector politically, enabling him to reform the constitution of Cleves and Mark in 1660 and 1661 to introduce officials loyal to him and independent of the local estates. In the Duchy of Prussia, he confirmed the traditional privileges of the estates in 1663, but the latter accepted the caveat that these privileges {{were not to be}} used to interfere with the exertion of the elector's sovereignty. As in Brandenburg, Frederick William ignored the privilege of the Prussian estates to confirm or veto taxes raised by the elector: while in 1656, an Akzise was raised with the estates' consent, the elector by force collected taxes not approved by the Prussian estates {{for the first time in}} 1674. Since 1704, the Prussian estates had de facto relinquished their right to approve the elector's taxes while formally still entitled to do so. In 1682, the elector introduced an Akzise to Pomerania and in 1688 to Magdeburg, while in Cleves and Mark an Akzise was introduced only between 1716 and 1720. Due to Frederick William's reforms, the state income increased threefold during his reign, and the tax burden per subject reached a level <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> in France.|$|E
5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the war, one pressing problem was the very high number of unwanted pregnancies of rape victims. Estimates of the number of pregnancies resulting in births range from 25,000 to the Bangladeshi government's figure of 70,000, while one publication by the Centre for Reproductive Law and Policy gave a total of 250,000. A government-mandated victim relief programme was set up with the support of the World Health Organization and International Planned Parenthood Federation, among whose goals it was to organise abortion facilities to help rape victims terminate unwanted pregnancies. A doctor at a rehabilitation centre in Dhaka reported 170,000 abortions of pregnancies caused by the rapes, and the births of 30,000 war babies during the first three months of 1972. Dr. Geoffrey Davis, an Australian doctor and abortion specialist who worked for the programme, estimated that there had been about 5,000 cases of self-induced abortions. He also said that during his work he heard of numerous infanticides and suicides by victims. His estimate of the total number of rape victims was 400,000, <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> <b>as</b> the official estimate of 200,000 cited by the Bangladeshi government. Most of the victims also contracted sexual infections. Many suffered from feelings of intense shame and humiliation, and a number were ostracised by their families and communities or committed suicide.|$|E
40|$|The {{phytochemical}} {{isolation of}} the ethanol extract of the stem bark of Allanblackia ulugurensis led to the isolation and identification of two polycyclic polyprenylated acylphloroglucinols (PPAPs), named guttiferone F (1) and 30 -epi-cambogin (2) and a biphenyl compound, 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methoxybiphenyl (3). The ethanolic crude extract of A. ulugurensis exhibited high activity in anti-HIV protease assay with IC 50 of 4. 1 g/ml, while the standard drug has IC 50 of 2. 2 g/ml. However, compounds 1 and 2 indicated lower activity in anti-HIV protease assay with IC 50 values of 11. 3 and 22. 7 g/ml respectively. The ethanolic crude extract of the stem bark of Mammea usambarensis indicated potent antioxidant activity in the DPPH assay with a value of 6, 165 ± 152 μmol TE/g, {{which is more than}} <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>higher</b> <b>as</b> that of the standard (Chlorogenic acid; 3, 056 ± 157 μmol TE/g).

The lower activities of the isolated compounds compared to the crude extracts may be attributed by the synergistic effect. Interestingly, the activities of the isolated compounds were higher than the corresponding standard compounds...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the increment of dental caries and potential clinical {{risk factors for}} this increase within a 3 -year-period (1998 - 2001). Method: A prospective longitudinal study on dental caries was performed between 1998 a 2001 {{in a sample of}} 136 children aged 12 years and 30 months, in the city of Feira de Santana, BA. The city has fluoridated water supply and the children were evaluated at three different moments: baseline, after 1 year and after 3 years. At the three moments, intraoral examination was performed for detection of dental caries (dmf-t index), dental plaque and white spot lesions on the buccal surfaces of maxillary incisors and presence of molars. Data were analyzed by distribution of absolute and relative frequencies, means, median and standard deviation, and use of chi-square, Wilcoxon test of signalized posts, Mc-Nemar and Fisher’s tests. Significance level was set at 5 %. Results: The prevalence of dental caries in the baseline examination was 5. 9 %, 18. 4 % after 1 year and 40. 4 % after 3 years, denoting an increment of 39. 7 %. It was confirmed the significant association between the variables white spot lesions, visible plaque and previous caries experience with the increment of dental caries after 3 years. There was no association with the presence of primary molars. Conclusions: The prevalence of dental caries after 3 years was approximately 7 times higher than that of the baseline examination and <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>higher</b> <b>as</b> that of the baseline examination. The clinical risk factors identified in this study are important indicators of the increment of dental caries in very young children...|$|R
50|$|Aardonyx {{is thought}} to be the sister taxon of a sauropodomorph clade {{containing}} Melanorosaurus and sauropods, which are all obligatory quadrupeds, based on a phylogenetic analysis conducted along with the first description of the genus.

40|$|The {{expression}} of beta-adrenoceptors (BAR) {{was investigated in}} abdominal and gluteal fat cells of 32 nonobese men and women using radioligand binding and RNA excess solution hybridization. In both sexes the number of BAR binding sites was about <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> in abdominal <b>as</b> in gluteal fat cells (P < 0. 01). Northern blot analysis of total RNA from adipose tissue showed hybridization of the BAR, probe to an mRNA species of about 2. 5 kb and of the BAR 2 probe to an mRNA species of- 2. 2 kb. The steady-state mRNA levels of BAR 1 and BAR 2 were also about <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>high</b> in abdominal <b>as</b> in gluteal adipocytes ofmen and women (P < 0. 01).
