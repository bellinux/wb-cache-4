The family owned several shops in Jakarta, including one in Blok M and another in Tanah Abang. Beginning {{when he was in}} junior high school Arnada helped the family with the shops, using his free <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> Arnada was raised in a Muslim family and has remained a devout Muslim.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, Hu went to Luzhou in {{southern}} Sichuan, {{the base of}} the progressive warlord Yang Sen, where she worked at the elementary school of South Sichuan Teachers College and studied at the college. She taught two of Yang's five wives (polygamy being legal at the <b>time)</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> and befriended another, but when Yang proposed to Hu, she angrily refused to become his sixth wife. When the influential writer Mao Dun heard about her story from a mutual friend, he wrote the novel Rainbow, which was published in 1929. The novel's heroine Mei, modelled after Hu Lanqi's life from 1920 to 1924, would become much better known in China than Hu herself.|$|E
5|$|Stephen King criticised the {{reactions}} of some reviewers to the books, including McCauley, for jumping too quickly to surface conclusions of the work. He felt this was inevitable, because of the extreme secrecy before launch which did not allow reviewers <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> and consider the book, but meant that many early reviews lacked depth. Rather than finding the writing style disappointing, he felt it had matured and improved. He acknowledged that {{the subject matter of}} the books had become more adult, and that Rowling had clearly been writing with the adult audience firmly in mind since the middle of the series. He compared the works in this respect to Huckleberry Finn and Alice in Wonderland which achieved success and have become established classics, in part by appealing to the adult audience as well as children.|$|E

5|$|Haynes' father {{attended}} the Philadelphia Centennial Exposition in 1876 {{where he learned}} of a school that would fit his son's interests. Using the money he had saved, Haynes decided to attend the college and enrolled in the Worcester Technical Institute in Worcester, Massachusetts, in September 1878. The school was revolutionary for its time, combining technical training with a classical liberal arts education. Although he easily passed the difficult entrance exam, he {{found that he was}} ill-prepared for some of his college courses, and he struggled with mathematics. To earn an income while away from home, he worked as a custodian and night guard at the local public library. He cleaned the building overnight and used his spare <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> books and study. During his final year at the school, boarding rates were increased beyond what Haynes could afford so with no other option, he lived in the library for several months. He could not afford to return home during his stay at the institute, so during the holidays he spent time with his family and friends in New England.|$|E
25|$|Large {{databases}} {{have historically}} been kept on disk drives. The <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> a record on a disk drive far exceeds {{the time needed to}} compare keys once the record is available. The <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> a record from a disk drive involves a seek time and a rotational delay. The seek time may be 0 to 20 or more milliseconds, and the rotational delay averages about half the rotation period. For a 7200 RPM drive, the rotation period is 8.33 milliseconds. For a drive such as the Seagate ST3500320NS, the track-to-track seek time is 0.8 milliseconds and the average reading seek time is 8.5 milliseconds. For simplicity, assume reading from disk takes about 10 milliseconds.|$|E

25|$|On June 4, 2015, Nichols' {{booking agency}} {{announced}} that she had suffered a mild stroke at her Los Angeles home and had been admitted to a Los Angeles-area hospital. This was barely {{three months after the}} death of her friend and Star Trek co-star Leonard Nimoy. Doctors were conducting tests to determine the severity of the stroke. Nichols was reportedly awake and resting comfortably. An online news article by Frazier Moore of the Associated Press, which cited news updates from the actress's Facebook page, stated that, four days afterward, the hospitalized actress was feeling much better and was improving, remaining cheerful and alert and taking the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the messages from fans and well-wishers on her Facebook page, of which there were many. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan did reveal a small stroke but she was able to begin inpatient therapy on June 5, 2015, for rehabilitation and recovery and to further evaluate her condition and determine the prognosis. Her fellow Star Trek actor George Takei, who played Hikaru Sulu, wished her well on his Twitter account page.|$|E

As Ochse points out, when Bemis becomes the last person on Earth, he finally has <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>read,</b> with all his books at his fingertips and the only impediment is technology when his medium for accessing them—his glasses—breaks. In a hypothetical world where all books are published electronically, Ochse observes, readers would be [...] "only a lightning strike, a faulty switch, a sleepy workman or a natural disaster away from becoming Henry Bemis {{at the end of the}} world"—that is, a power outage has the potential to give them <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>read,</b> yet like Bemis, they too would lose their medium for accessing their books—namely the computer.|$|E

500|$|At first, {{his work}} on the symphony kept Rimsky-Korsakov {{occupied}} during his cruise. He purchased scores at every port of call, along with a piano on which to play them, and filled his idle hours studying Berlioz's Treatise on Instrumentation. He found <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the works of Homer, William Shakespeare, Friedrich Schiller and Johann Wolfgang von Goethe; he saw London, Niagara Falls, and Rio de Janeiro during his stops in port. Eventually, the lack of outside musical stimuli dulled the young midshipman's hunger to learn. He wrote to Balakirev that after two years at sea he had neglected his musical lessons for months.|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of the album's lyrics discuss political issues in the United States. Jeff Miers of The Buffalo News calls the album [...] "a response to the oppressive vacuousness of the Bush years". Dealing with specific tracks on the album, AllMusic states that Rise Against [...] "rages against the moral decay rotting {{the core of the}} U.S. on the opening 'Collapse (Post-Amerika),' just as they strike out against the slow dumbing down of America on 'Re-Education (Through Labor)'". In addition to political topics, more personal issues constitute {{a large portion of the}} lyrical content. [...] "Savior" [...] is about forgiveness and broken relationships, while [...] "The Dirt Whispered" [...] is about the need to sacrifice for what a person loves. Bassist Joe Principe said, [...] "The political side of this band is just that -- it's a side. There are political lyrics. There are social awareness and there are lyrics about the environment. I think if people take the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the lyrics, they'll know we're not strictly force feeding you our politics." ...|$|E
500|$|At its introduction, The Woman's Bible {{was widely}} criticized in editorials {{and from the}} pulpit. Stanton wrote that [...] "the clergy denounced it {{as the work of}} Satan..." [...] Some were put off just by its prejudicial, sacrilegious title, {{especially}} those who did not take the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the book. Others countered the book's more extreme conclusions one by one in public fora such as letters to the editor. One female reader of The New York Times wrote to decry The Woman's Bible for its radical statements that the Trinity was composed of [...] "a Heavenly Mother, Father, and Son", and that prayers should be addressed to an [...] "ideal Heavenly Mother". Mary Seymour Howell, a member of the Revising Committee, wrote to The New York Times in defense of the book, saying that its title could be better understood as [...] "The Woman's Commentary on the Women of the Bible". Stanton countered attacks by women readers, writing [...] "the only difference between us is, we say that these degrading ideas of woman emanated from the brain of man, while the church says that they came from God." ...|$|E

500|$|Prior to performing, Staton {{received}} a 12-page document that outlined the story, {{and the history}} of Phelps. He has said that he received the document as there wasn't enough <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>read</b> the 2,200-page script before filming began. Staton cumulatively worked on L.A. Noire for about eighteen months. He said, [...] "consecutively I think I worked six months, and then for the next year here and there picking things up, adding, changing and tweaking things". When discussing his character, McGowan felt that Bekowsky was initially jealous of Phelps, but eventually warmed up to him. [...] "Like a good older brother he'll always have his back but will never take shit from him," [...] he said. McGrady, who portrayed Rusty Galloway, said his own introverted personality helped him connect to the character. [...] "I am a classic introvert but I can hold court when I need to. I think Rusty is that way too," [...] McGrady said. Harrington described Roy as [...] "jaded, tough, mean, cruel, brutally honest and ... very funny". He took credit for all of Roy's facial expressions, but said that all of the dialogue was scripted, as opposed to ad-lib. Many characters in the game are influenced by real people and events; for example, Captain Donnelly is loosely based on both McNamara's father, and LAPD Captain Jack Donahue. Additionally, many cases that Phelps solves are based off real life events, such as the Black Dahlia case.|$|E
