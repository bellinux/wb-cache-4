5|$|At this point, the Muslims divided their forces: {{the bulk}} of the army, under Abbas, {{remained}} at Kamacha to continue the siege, while the remainder (an obviously exaggerated force of 50,000 according to the Zuqnin chronicler) was sent to raid further into Byzantine territory and pillage. The siege continued through the autumn, and the Arabs, who customarily did not take along many provisions, began suffering from lack of supplies. <b>To</b> <b>solve</b> <b>their</b> supply problems, they established a market for merchants from Mesopotamia and elsewhere. In the end, with winter approaching, Abbas was forced to raise the siege and retreat south, burning the large market-place to prevent it from falling into Byzantine hands.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{were not}} able to hold Dijon and ordered a {{complete}} withdrawal from Southern France. Army GroupG retreated further north, pursued by Allied forces. The fighting ultimately came to a stop at the Vosges mountains, where Army GroupG was finally able to establish a stable defense line. After meeting with the Allied units from Operation Overlord, the Allied forces were in need of reorganizing and, facing stiffened German resistance, the offensive was halted on 14September. Operation Dragoon was considered a success by the Allies. It enabled them to liberate most of Southern France in a time span of only four weeks, while inflicting heavy casualties on the German forces, although a substantial part of the best German units was able to escape. The captured French ports were put into operation, allowing the Allies <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>their</b> supply problems soon after.|$|E

However, Father John begins to question those boundaries and reconsider whether the role as priest goes far enough in having a positive, substantive impact on the lives of those in his care, particularly Linda. And, in addition to questioning whether he is helping his congregants, Father John questions whether staying within those boundaries is enough to personally fulfill himself as a priest and provide his own life with meaning. He ultimately crosses over those boundaries and gets personally involved in trying to help Linda by delving into the city's red-light district to seek her.|$|E

The AdA in March 1976 would issue a set of official requirements whose parameters matched that of Dassault's performance estimates of the new fighter.

25|$|LLNL has a {{long history}} of {{developing}} computing software and systems. Initially, there was no commercially available software, and computer manufacturers considered it the customer’s responsibility to develop their own. Users of the early computers had to write not only the codes <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>their</b> technical problems, but also the routines to run the machines themselves. Today, LLNL computer scientists focus on creating the highly complex physics models, visualization codes, and other unique applications tailored to specific research requirements. A great deal of software also has been written by LLNL personnel to optimize the operation and management of the computer systems, including operating system extensions such as CHAOS (Linux Clustering) and resource management packages such as SLURM. The Peloton procurements in late 2006 (Atlas and other computers) were the first in which a commercial resource management package, Moab, was used to manage the clusters.|$|E
25|$|However, {{a crisis}} arrived. The United States {{drastically}} reduced its immigrant quotas, causing shipping companies {{to lose a}} large part of their income and to have to adapt to this circumstance. The Great Depression also played an important role, causing a drastic {{decrease in the number of}} people crossing the Atlantic and at the same time reducing the number of profitable transatlantic voyages. In response, shipping companies redirected many of their liners to a more profitable cruise service. In 1934, in the United Kingdom, Cunard Line and White Star Line were in very bad shape financially. Chancellor of the Exchequer Arthur Neville Chamberlain proposed to merge the two companies in order <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>their</b> financial problems. The merger took place in 1934 and launched the construction of the Queen Mary while progressively sending their older ships to the scrapyard. The construction of a second ship, the Queen Elizabeth, was interrupted by the outbreak of World War II.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, {{the problem}} became {{increasingly}} popular in scientific circles in Europe and the USA after the RAND Corporation in Santa Monica offered prizes for steps {{in solving the}} problem. Notable contributions were made by George Dantzig, Delbert Ray Fulkerson and Selmer M. Johnson from the RAND Corporation, who expressed the problem as an integer linear program and developed the cutting plane method for its solution. They wrote what is considered the seminal paper on the subject in which with these new methods they solved an instance with 49 cities to optimality by constructing a tour and proving that no other tour could be shorter. Dantzig, Fulkerson and Johnson, however, speculated that given a near optimal solution {{we may be able}} to find optimality or prove optimality by adding a small amount of extra inequalities (cuts). They used this idea <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>their</b> initial 49 city problem using a string model. They found they only needed 26 cuts to come to a solution for their 49 city problem. While this paper did not give an algorithmic approach to TSP problems, the ideas that lay within it were indispensable to later creating exact solution methods for the TSP, though it would take 15 years to find an algorithmic approach in creating these cuts. As well as cutting plane methods, Dantzig, Fulkerson and Johnson used branch and bound algorithms perhaps for the first time.|$|E

However, she scored well on her handling of the recent euro crisis (69% rated her performance as good rather than poor), and her approval rating reached an all-time high of 77% in February 2012 and again in July 2014. Merkel's approval rating dropped to 54% in October 2015, during the European migrant crisis, the lowest since 2011.

500|$|Film theorist David Roche {{writes that}} Lynch films do not simply tell detective stories, but rather force the {{audience}} {{into the role}} of becoming detectives themselves {{to make sense of the}} narratives, and that Mulholland Drive, like other Lynch films, frustrates [...] "the spectator's need for a rational diegesis by playing on the spectator's mistake that narration is synonymous with diegesis". In Lynch's films, the spectator is always [...] "one step behind narration" [...] and thus [...] "narration prevails over diegesis". Roche also notes that there are multiple mysteries in the film that ultimately go unanswered by the characters who meet dead ends, like Betty and Rita, or give in to pressures as Adam does. Although the audience still struggles to make sense of the stories, the characters are no longer trying <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> <b>their</b> mysteries. Roche concludes that Mulholland Drive is a mystery film not because it allows the audience to view the solution to a question, but the film itself is a mystery that is held together [...] "by the spectator-detective's desire to make sense" [...] of it.|$|E
