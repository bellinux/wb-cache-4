5|$|In the {{beginning}} of a match, a 30-second headstart is given to <b>the</b> <b>Monster</b> so that they can have enough time to escape before the Hunters parachute from a plane to where <b>the</b> <b>Monster</b> started. Each map features an open world environment for players to explore and play within. To help the Hunters navigate the environments quickly, they are equipped with jetpacks, allowing them to jump over obstacles and cliffs. The jetpack {{can also be used to}} dodge attacks performed by <b>the</b> <b>monster,</b> though it consumes a Hunter's energy. The team can track <b>the</b> <b>monster,</b> as well as place waypoints on an interactive map. The color of these waypoints are different based on what players have marked. The waypoint mark turns yellow for environment, orange for wildlife or red for <b>the</b> <b>Monster.</b>|$|E

Also in 2005, she was the only female competitor in the Super Bowl of Motorsports.|$|E
5|$|Trapper: The Trapper-class {{characters}} can {{use their}} gear to track the Monster's movements. As <b>the</b> <b>Monster</b> occasionally scatters local wildlife, such as birds, the trapper can use these 'signs' to find the location of <b>the</b> <b>monster.</b> Trappers also have other abilities and tools that can slow the movements of <b>the</b> <b>Monster.</b> Following {{the release of the}} Stage 2 alpha, all hunters gained the ability to use the mobile arena and the trappers gained the plant scanner ability, similar to the monster's smell.|$|E

5|$|After Jacob's death, <b>the</b> <b>Monster</b> tells Ben {{to fetch}} Richard, {{as he wants}} to speak to him. However, when Ben exits the statue, Richard throws him down beside the corpse of the real John Locke, which has {{been brought to the}} statue by {{survivors}} of the Ajira flight, led by Ilana Verdansky (Zuleikha Robinson). Ben is forced by Ilana's group to bring them to the imposter Locke. They start shooting at <b>the</b> <b>Monster,</b> but he disappears, then returns in its black smoke form, killing Ilana's group. <b>The</b> <b>Monster</b> returns to Locke's form and mockingly informs Ben of the real Locke's last thoughts, while being strangled by Ben. Afterwards, Ben comforts Ilana when he finds her crying in Jacob's chamber and sets off with her, Sun, and Frank Lapidus (Jeff Fahey) to bury Locke before going to the Temple, where they believe they will be safe from <b>the</b> <b>Monster.</b> At Locke's funeral, Ben provides the eulogy, and expresses his sincere apologies for killing Locke. When they arrive at the Temple, <b>the</b> <b>Monster</b> is destroying the place. They return to the beach as a temporary shelter, and Ben attempts to make amends with everyone for killing Jacob. Ilana then forces him to dig a grave and explains she will kill Ben for murdering her father figure. Later, <b>the</b> <b>Monster</b> visits Ben, telling him to join him and then magically frees Ben. After Ben escapes, Ilana chases after him, and the two come face-to-face at the jungle when Ben points a rifle at her. Ben explains to her why he really killed Jacob, particularly grieving his daughter. Ilana understands and allows him to rejoin their group, which he does. Hurley, Jack, and Richard show up and join their group, then have a meeting, deciding what to do next. Richard suggests they should stop <b>the</b> <b>Monster</b> escaping by blowing up the Ajira plane. After Hurley destroys the available dynamite from the shipwrecked Black Rock, Richard insists he will find other explosives. Ben and Miles join Richard, while the rest decide to go talk to <b>the</b> <b>Monster.</b> When Ben, Richard and Miles arrive at the Barracks, Widmore is there, and is soon joined by <b>the</b> <b>Monster.</b> Ben murders Widmore before he is able to make a deal with <b>the</b> <b>Monster</b> to spare his daughter. <b>The</b> <b>Monster</b> and Ben find Desmond and <b>the</b> <b>Monster</b> forces him to go destroy the Island. They run into Jack's group and they both go {{to the heart of the}} Island, where Desmond removes the cork of the Island, causing the Island to begin collapsing. After Jack kills <b>the</b> <b>Monster,</b> Ben and Hurley volunteer to stay behind on the Island with Jack to assist him relighting the Island. Jack tells them he will die doing this and Jack gives Hurley the new position of being protector of the Island. Ben advises him to approach his Island duties with his kindness and helpful attitude. Hurley asks Ben to become his advisor, to which he is honored. After an undisclosed period of time, Ben, on orders from Hurley, arrives at the Dharma Logistics Warehouse in Guam. He speaks to the two workers there and instructs them that the facility is being shut down. Afterward, Ben arrives at the Santa Rosa Mental Hospital and visits Walt. Ben tells him that he is still special and that he can help his father, Michael, even though he is dead, and offers Walt a job to return to the island.|$|E
