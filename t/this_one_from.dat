5|$|Michigan State {{continued}} its recent dominance over Michigan, winning 28–14. The first half was relatively quiet, with each team only scoring one {{touchdown in the}} first quarter. Michigan's Denard Robinson ran in one from 15 yards out, with Michigan State responding with a one-yard touchdown run by Edwin Baker. After halftime, State's Kirk Cousins threw a 10-yard touchdown pass to Keshawn Martin to take the lead. The Spartans added more points with another touchdown catch by Martin, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>from</b> 13 yards out. In the fourth quarter, Michigan scored their only points {{of the second half}} with a 34-yard touchdown catch and run by Roy Roundtree. State sealed their victory with a 39-yard interception return touchdown by Isaiah Lewis, handing Michigan their first loss of the season.|$|E
5|$|Ohio State {{was unable}} to score and gave the ball back to Texas with 13:24 left in the game. Texas was forced to punt. On the Buckeyes' next {{possession}} they drove from their own 30 to the Texas 33 before settling for a sixth field goal attempt by Huston, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>from</b> 50yards out. Huston missed wide left to leave Ohio State still ahead by sixpoints. Texas took over at their own 33with 5:07 left in the game.|$|E
5|$|Arkansas State got {{the ball}} to start the second half, and {{promptly}} drove down the field relying predominantly on Knighten, who threw six passes and attempted three rushes; ultimately, their drive stalled at the 2-yard line, and Davis kicked an 18-yard field goal to put the Red Wolves atop 13–10. Ball State subsequently faced a fourth down and one (4th and 1) situation, on which they attempted a fake punt – Schmidt was tackled by Brock Barnhill on the play and lost three yards on the rush, and the Cardinals had to relinquish the ball in their own territory. Arkansas State {{took advantage of the}} field position, converting another field goal attempt, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>from</b> 29 yards, to give them a 6-point lead. Once again, Ball State turned the ball over on downs on their ensuing possession, this time doing so at the Arkansas State 32-yard line. This time, Arkansas State failed to take advantage, punting after achieving only one first down. At the end of the quarter, Ball State {{was in the midst of}} a possession around their 25-yard line.|$|E

25|$|Most of the {{remaining}} first half would be a defensive struggle. With just over five minutes left, Washington running back Timmy Smith broke off a 34-yard run to the Vikings 31-yard line. But they failed to score again because of another missed field goal from Haji-Sheikh, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>from</b> 47 yards. Minnesota took over and tied the game before halftime with quarterback Wade Wilson's 36-yard completion to tight end Steve Jordan setting up a 23-yard touchdown pass to Leo Lewis.|$|E
25|$|The Broncos {{opened the}} second half by driving 74 yards to the Atlanta 20-yard line, but ended up scoring no points after Elam's 38-yard field goal attempt sailed wide right. Chandler responded on the next 2 plays with a 29-yard {{completion}} to receiver Tony Martin and a 12-yard scramble to advance {{the ball to the}} Denver 41-yard line. But then linebacker John Mobley sacked Chandler for a 6-yard loss, and cornerback Darrius Johnson intercepted Chandler's pass and returned it 28 yards to the Falcons 42-yard line on the next play. Denver then drove to the 29-yard line, but Elam missed another field goal attempt, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>from</b> 47 yards.|$|E
25|$|With the game-time {{temperature}} at , the coldest NFL game since the Ice Bowl of December 31, 1967, {{the first quarter}} contained nothing but punts and interceptions, with Cleveland's Ron Bolton and Oakland's Lester Hayes each recording a pick. Near {{the end of the}} quarter, Sipe's 20-yard completion to Reggie Rucker sparked a drive inside the Raiders 30-yard line, but it ended with no points early in the second quarter when Cockroft missed a field goal attempt from 47 yards. On Oakland's ensuing drive, quarterback Jim Plunkett lost a fumble while being sacked, but their defense kept the Browns in check and Cockroft missed another field goal try, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>from</b> 30 yards out.|$|E

25|$|By 1863 Camp Morton's {{buildings}} were {{in need of}} repair, but little was spent on improvements. Colonel James Biddle, Seventy-first Indiana Volunteers, became commandant of the camp. Most of his regiment had been captured at Muldraugh Hill, Kentucky, where they were paroled on the field, and had been living at Camp Morton awaiting a prisoner exchange. Soldiers from Biddle's regiment were assigned to guard duty at the camp, {{with the assistance of}} other military companies. New prisoners from arrived at Camp Morton between January 29 and the end of March 1863. In April 1863, the camp's prisoners were ordered to City Point, Virginia, and in June a new group arrived, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>from</b> Gallatin, Tennessee.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fourth}} quarter, Fuller was nailed with a 15-yard {{facemask}} penalty while tackling Vikings running back Allen Rice after he gained 19 yards {{on a screen}} pass, setting up Nelson's 46-yard field goal to put the Vikings up 33–17. Then defensive back Carl Lee intercepted a pass from Young, allowing Minnesota to run more time off the clock. Following a punt, Young led the 49ers 68 yards in eight plays to score on a 16-yard touchdown pass to tight end John Frank, but by then there was only 3:42 left in the game. Nelson later kicked a postseason record fifth field goal, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>from</b> 46 yards, to completely dash any hope of a miracle comeback.|$|E
25|$|Following their {{extraordinary}} journey, the two {{men took}} divergent paths.

He began practicing law in New York City, the home of his brother Richard Morris Hunt, until the outbreak of the American Civil War, when he enlisted as lieutenant on the staff of General Heintzelman. Eventually he was promoted to lieutenant colonel for bravery at the Battle of Malvern Hill. Hunt subsequently attained the rank of full colonel and assistant adjutant general in the Union Army.|$|E

25|$|San Francisco {{started the}} second half with a drive into Washington territory, aided by a {{controversial}} ruling in which running back Wendell Tyler dropped the ball just a second after catching it and then dove on it. Officials ruled the play a fumble and recovery for the 49ers rather than an incompletion. But kicker Ray Wersching later slipped on the muddy field while attempting a 50-yard field goal and it fell well short. On Washington's next drive, they ran another trick play, this time a pass from Riggins, who threw a 36-yard completion to Charlie Brown inside the 49ers 15-yard line. But all that led to was Moseley's third missed field goal attempt of the day, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>from</b> 38 yards, that he once again sent wide right.|$|E
25|$|For {{the third}} time in three quarters, St. Louis scored a field goal on their first drive, this one a {{franchise}} playoff record 51-yard kick from Wilkins that was set up by Bruce's 24-yard reception. However, the Panthers stormed back with three unanswered scoring drives. Kasay soon responded with a franchise playoff record field goal of his own, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>from</b> 52 yards, to retake the Panthers lead at 13-12. Following a Rams punt, Carolina drove 64 yards in 14 plays and scored again on Kasay's 34-yard kick. Then in the fourth quarter, Minter intercepted a pass from Bulger on the Panthers 27. Carolina subsequently drove 73 yards, including a 36-yard catch by Steve Smith, to score on Hoover's 7-yard touchdown run and increase their lead to 23-12.|$|E
25|$|Following {{a first-round}} bye, the Broncos {{kicked off the}} divisional round of the 2012–13 NFL playoffs at home by {{welcoming}} the Baltimore Ravens, whom the Broncos defeated in Baltimore four weeks earlier. A 90-yard punt return for a touchdown by return specialist Trindon Holliday gave the Broncos the early lead. However, the Ravens quickly responded, with quarterback Joe Flacco connecting on a 59-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Torrey Smith, followed by cornerback Corey Graham returning an interception off Broncos' quarterback Peyton Manning 39 yards for a touchdown. The Broncos tied the game, with Manning throwing a 15-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Brandon Stokley, then re-claimed the lead midway through the second quarter, with Manning connecting on a 14-yard touchdown pass to running back Knowshon Moreno. The Broncos {{had an opportunity to}} add to their lead just after the two-minute warning, but placekicker Matt Prater missed a 52-yard field goal, giving the Ravens excellent field goal position with 1:16 remaining until halftime. Three plays later, Flacco connected on another touchdown pass to Smith — <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>from</b> 32 yards.|$|E

25|$|For {{their season}} finale, the Lions hosted a rematch with {{division}} rivals the Chicago Bears. The Bears started the scoring {{in the first}} quarter with a 44-yard field goal by Robbie Gould. The Lions responded with a 42-yard field goal of their own. Then in the second quarter the Bears kicked another field goal, from 28 yards out. The Lions then took the lead with a 12-yard Bryant Johnson TD catch. The Bears took it back just before halftime with a 7-yard Greg Olsen TD catch. In the third quarter the Bears added to their lead with a Devin Aromashodu 9-yard TD catch. The Lions responded with a 48-yard field goal. Later, in the fourth quarter, the Lions tied it up with a 5-yard Calvin Johnson TD catch.

25|$|In what was, at the time, the most-watched NFL {{regular season}} game since 1996, the Patriots faced the Cowboys, the NFC's only {{remaining}} unbeaten team. The Patriots' first drive {{of the game}} spanned 74yards and ended in a 6-yard touchdown catch by Moss from Brady. After three punts, the Patriots' lead increased to 14–0 after another Brady touchdown pass, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>from</b> 35yards out to Welker. In the second quarter, the Cowboys got on the scoreboard when they culminated a 64-yard, 10-play drive with a 38-yard field goal by Nick Folk. On their ensuing possession, the Patriots advanced 12yards before Brady was strip-sacked by defensive end Greg Ellis; defensive end Jason Hatcher recovered the ball and returned it 29yards for a touchdown, cutting the Patriots' lead to 14–10. The Patriots responded with a 12-play, 72-yard drive that ended on a 12-yard touchdown pass from Brady to Welker, his second of the day. The Cowboys then moved the ball 84yards, keeping pace with the Patriots when Tony Romo threw to Terrell Owens for a 12-yard touchdown grab of his own, giving the game a 21–17 score at halftime.|$|E
25|$|The Bills {{took the}} opening kickoff and scored with a typical fast-paced drive, moving the ball 76 yards in five plays. Running back Thurman Thomas rushed for 14 yards {{and caught a}} pass for 20, while Jim Kelly {{finished}} {{it off with a}} 40-yard touchdown pass to receiver Andre Reed. Aided by three Bills penalties, the Dolphins responded with a 40-yard drive that ended on Pete Stoyanovich's 49-yard field goal, cutting their deficit to 7-3. The Bills struck back with Kelly's 44-yard completion to James Lofton setting up a 24-yard Scott Norwood field goal, retaking their 7-point lead at 10-3. On the next series, Miami quarterback Dan Marino threw a pass that was tipped by Darryl Talley and intercepted by defensive back Nate Odomes, who returned the ball nine yards to the Dolphins 38. Faced with third and 8 on their ensuing possession, Kelly took off for a 16-yard gain. He fumbled at the end, but center Kent Hull recovered the ball for a first down on the 18-yard line. Norwood completed the drive with his second field goal, <b>this</b> <b>one</b> <b>from</b> 22 yards, upping the lead to 13-3.|$|E
