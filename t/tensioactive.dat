30|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{surfactants}} have arosen {{as a main}} pollutant group {{that has to be}} taken care of. According to previous literature, detergents and other <b>tensioactives</b> may modify environmental equilibrium by contaminating lakes and groundwater (Cserháti et al. 2002). Moreover, they usually present a synergistic binding effect on pharmaceuticals, and hence the impact of such chemicals and their toxicity for both humans and animals has considerably increased (Clara et al. 2007). There already exist several methods for removing surfactants from aqueous effluents. The main ones may involve chemical association (Rosu et al. 2007), electrochemical removal (Önder et al. 2007) or adsorption on activated carbon (Basar et al. 2004). However, there is still a challenge in developing new removal methods that may be even cheaper and easier to apply. Nowadays, the great impact of surfactants have claimed more research efforts. Particularly, anionic <b>tensioactives</b> enter into the aquatic ecosystems together with polluted waters because they are widely used in many industries, including petroleum, oil refining, petrochemical and gas industries. They are also used in pest control in aquaculture for combating pathogenic organisms for fish (Ostroumov 2006).

40|$|The {{interfacial}} {{quality of}} emulsions impacts their digestibility. Infant formulas are stabilized by milk proteins and non-dairy <b>tensioactives</b> whereas Human milk is stabilized by a native membrane based on Milk Polar Lipids (MPL) and proteins. The addition of MPL in infant formulas seems a clever approach to closely mimic Human milk natural interface although very few infant formulas use milk lipids {{more expensive than}} vegetable lipids. The interfacial composition of such emulsion has never been characterized nor its effect on emulsion digestibility. Our study aimed at elucidating these two points. Two model emulsions with similar droplets size (mode= 2 µm, specific surface~ 15 m 2 /g of lipids) and based on a blend of vegetable fats (3 g/ 100 g) were produced at labscale: the emulsions were stabilized by MPL and milk proteins (molar ratio= 1 : 1); MPL were introduced before homogenization in emulsion MPL 1 to favour their interfacial contribution whereas MPL were introduced after homogenization in emulsion PROT 1. The emulsions structures and interfacial compositions were characterized by laser granulometry, confocal laser scanning microscopy and high performance liquid chromatography. The emulsions were then digested using a dynamic in vitro model of neonatal digestion [1, 2]. The interface of MPL 1 contained 0. 32 % of total MPL/m 2 of emulsion surface area whereas only 0. 06 - 0. 12 % of total MPL/m 2 occupied the interface of PROT 1. No selectivity in the adsorption of MPL was reported. The protein interfacial coverage was twice lower in MPL 1. For both emulsions a selective adsorption of caseins (α-s and β in particular) was observed. The digestive desintegration and kinetics of lipolysis and proteolysis of the emulsions in the gastric phase were affected by these interfacial differences: the structure of MPL 1 was more stable and its hydrolysis slightly slower...|$|R

METHODS AND RESULTS: Burkholderia glumae AU 6208 produces a large spectrum of mono- and di-rhamnolipid congeners with side chains varying between C(12) -C(12) and C(16) -C(16), {{the most abundant}} being Rha-Rha-C(14) -C(14). The effects on rhamnolipid production of the cultivation temperature, nitrogen and carbon source were investigated. With urea as the nitrogen source and canola oil as the carbon source, a production of 1000. 7 mg l(- 1) was reached after 6 days. These rhamnolipids display a critical micelle concentration of 25 - 27 mg l(- 1) and decrease the interfacial tension against hexadecane from 40 to 1. 8 mN m(- 1). They also have excellent emulsifying properties against long chain alkanes. CONCLUSIONS: Burkholderia glumae AU 6208 can produce considerable amounts of rhamnolipids.

40|$|National audienceMany food {{proteins}} as {{egg white}} or milk protein show <b>tensioactive</b> properties. This means that one {{region of the}} protein has affinity for polar environment and another region of the protein prefers an apolar environment. For that reason, these proteins tend to adsorb to amphiphilic-hydrophobic interfaces such as air-water interface of bubble surface in case of foams or oil-water interface of droplets surfaces in case of emulsions. In both cases, food proteins act as stabilizers of the dispersed medium. In addition, {{and in contrast with}} small-molecular weight surfactants, proteins can also self-associate and form an interfacial film with viscoelastic properties, which also contributes to stabilization. However, their <b>tensioactive</b> properties confer to food proteins striking associative properties that this presentation will illustrate following three ideas:The mixture of two proteins as components of a dispersed medium can lead to enhanced bulk properties compared to the case where each protein is alone, even if one protein is in very small amount in the mixture. This property offers the possibility to modulate bulk properties of a mixture using one protein as an additive. The case of foaming properties of ovalbumine-lysozyme will illustrate this idea. We have shown (1, 2) that the interaction between proteins preferentially takes place at the air-water interface and that the interfacial adsorbed film is stratified, the most <b>tensioactive</b> protein being adsorbed first. The association of two proteins can lead to the formation of monodisperse microspheres, the ratio of each protein in the microsphere depending on the charge ratio. This property is illustrated by the case of the mixture alpha-lactalbumine/lysozyme (3). We have shown that the first steps of these bulk associative properties are revealed by the interfacial properties of these proteins. The last part of this presentation shows how very slight modifications of a protein, hardly detectable with standard bulk caracterisation tools, can lead to drastic changes in foaming and interfacial properties. The case of dry-heated lysozyme will be exposed, for which we haveshown (4) that a modification of one unique aminoacid greatly affects the interfacial properties of the protein and consequently greatly enhance the bulk properties of the foam.

But as for lysozyme, one of the egg white proteins, dry-heating results in a great increase of foaming properties, without any significant modifications of structure, as determined thanks to usual analytical methods for secondary and tertiary structure determination. On the other hand, chemical modifications of the protein sequence could be highlighted for about 40 % of lysozyme molecules: up to 5 Asp/Asn residues were changed for succinimide residues after dry-heating for 7 days at 80 °C. These modifications result in more <b>tensioactive</b> forms, compared to native lysozyme. However, these "succinimide lysozymes" do not explain all the interfacial properties of dry-heated lysozyme.

The optimum proportions of okara and sugarcane bagasse were 50 % each, by mass. Due to the relatively high production of proteases during SSF, pre-hydrolysis of the okara with a protease did not improve surfactin levels. The optimum temperature for surfactin production was 37 °C, with the incubation temperature affecting the ratios of the various surfactin homologues produced. Cultivation in column bioreactors with forced aeration under optimized conditions gave a surfactin level of 809 mgL− 1 of impregnating solution, which corresponds to 3. 3 gkg-dry-solids− 1. This is the highest surfactin level that has been produced to date in SSF with a non-recombinant microorganism. The peak O 2 uptake rate was 20 mmolmin− 1 kg-initial-dry-solids− 1, corresponding to metabolic waste heat production rate of 182 Wkg-initial-dry-solids− 1. The <b>tensioactive</b> properties of the surfactin were similar to those reported in the literature for surfactin produced by submerged fermentation.

Bacteriologic tests assessing the effects on normal vaginal flora and pathogens; in vitro and in vivo tests {{designed to}} assess cytotoxicity, as well as irritant and sensitizing potentials; biocompatibility, barrier, residence time, and absorption tests using reconstituted human vaginal epithelium were performed. Results: Polybactum is a selective bacteriostatic agent that is active against Streptococcus agalactiae and Gardnerella vaginalis while sparing normal vaginal flora; that is, Lactobacillus spp. It had no cytotoxic, irritant, and sensitizing effects nor did it impair barrier and fence functions of the vaginal epithelium. The Type 1 ovule showed film-forming properties in vitro. Finally, LG absorption through reconstituted human vaginal epithelium was negligible, ruling out the risk for possible systemic toxicity. Conclusions: This favorable preclinical profile is encouraging and supports clinical studies on Polybactum Type 1 ovules for the prevention and management of recurring bacterial vaginosis...|$|E

It contains polycarbophil, a bioadhesive agent, and lauryl glucoside (LG), a nonionic surfactant that reinforces the barrier effect through its <b>tensioactive</b> properties.

40|$|We have {{analyzed}} the chemical variety obtained by Miller-Urey-type experiments using {{nuclear magnetic resonance}} (NMR) spectroscopy and coherent anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) spectroscopy, gas chromatography followed by mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and two-dimensional gas chromatography followed by mass spectrometry (GCxGC/MS). In {{the course of a}} running Miller-Urey-type experiment, a hydrophobic organic layer emerged besides the hydrophilic aqueous phase and the gaseous phase that were initially present. The gas phase mainly consisted of aromatic compounds and molecules containing C≡C or C≡N triple bonds. The hydrophilic phase contained at least a few thousands of different molecules, primarily distributed in a range of 50 and 500 Da. The hydrophobic phase is characterized by carbon-rich, oil-like compounds and their amphiphilic derivatives containing oxygen with <b>tensioactive</b> properties. The presence {{of a wide range of}} oxidized molecules hints to the availability of oxygen radicals. We suggest that they intervene in the formation of alkylated polyethylene glycol (PEG) in the oil/water interface. CARS spectroscopy revealed distinct vibrational molecular signatures. In particular, characteristic spectral bands for cyanide compounds were observed if the broth was prepared with electric discharges in the gaseous phase. The characteristic spectral bands were absent if discharges were released onto the water surface. NMR spectroscopy on the same set of samples independently confirmed the observation. In addition, NMR spectroscopy revealed overall high chemical variability that suggests strong non-linearities due to interdependent, sequential reaction steps. © 2016 The Author(s...|$|E
30|$|The {{appearance}} of patches of dendritic {{growth in the}} P. aeruginosa ATCC strain biofilm on the BSA-covered PP substrate is an interesting phenomenon and may be analyzed {{from the point of}} view of rhamnolipid production and display of group behavior. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is capable of twitching, swimming, and swarming motility (Caiazza et al. 2005). Among these, swarming motility is a group behavior that requires rhamnolipid biosynthesis. The result of swarming in P. aeruginosa is the complex patterns of cells organized as radiating tendrils, the spaces between which may be analogous to biofilm channels in that they remain uncolonized. It has been noticed in swarming experiments that tendrils of a given swarm rarely intersect, and furthermore, tendrils from different swarms change course as they approach each other (as in Fig.  1 A in Caiazza et al. 2005). Also, when tendrils of opposing swarms approach, they change direction and swarm parallel to each other instead of crossing paths. The dendritic growth pattern in Fig.  7 reveals a similar characteristic as described above, indicating the probability of production of rhamnolipids in the ATCC biofilm on PP substrate. Such occurrence has not been observed in either of the other bacteria–substrate interactions presented here. The reason for the rhamnolipid production on a particular substrate or for a particular bacteria–substrate pair is, however, not known at present and may be revealed through future research. However, it might be predicted that the presence of rhamnolipids in the EPS of a biofilm is able to change the biofilm architecture due to their <b>tensioactive</b> properties (Beal and Betts 2000).|$|E
40|$|Industrial Biotechnology and Applied Microbiology is an {{optional}} 128 h-course for Chemistry and Biology {{students at the}} Faculty of Sciences, University of Buenos Aires, Argentina. This course is usually attended by 25 students, working in teams of two. The curriculum, with 8 lab exercises, includes an oil bioremediation practice covering an insight of bioremediation processes: the influence of pollutants on autochthonous microbiota, biodegrader isolation and biosurfactant production for bioavailability understanding. The experimental steps are: (A) evaluation of microbial tolerance to pollutants by constructing pristine soil microcosms contaminated with diesel or xylene and (B) isolation of degraders and biosurfactant production analysis. To check microbial tolerance, microcosms are incubated during one week at 25 - 28 ºC. Samples are collected at 0, 4 and every 48 h for CFU/g soil testing. An initial decrease of total CFU/g related to toxicity is noticed. At {{the end of the}} experiment, a recovery of the CFU number is observed, evidencing enrichment in biodegraders. Some colonies from the CFU counting plates are streaked in M 9 -agar with diesel as sole carbon source. After a week, isolates are inoculated on M 9 -Broth supplemented with diesel to induce biosurfactant production. Surface tension and Emulsification Index are measured in culture supernatants to visualize <b>tensioactive</b> effect of bacterial products. Besides the improvement in the good microbiological practices, the students show enthusiasm in different aspects, depending on their own interests. While biology students explore and learn new concepts on solubility, emulsions and bioavailability, chemistry students show curiosity in bacterial behavior and manipulation of microorganisms for environmental benefits. </span...|$|E
