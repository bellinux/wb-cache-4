Correlation between organic (vitrinite {{reflectance}} (Ro) and Rock-Eval Tmax temperature) and inorganic (mixed layer illite/smectite (I/S)) {{indicators of}} thermal maturity depend {{mainly on the}} maximum temperature achieved by the rock and the time exposure of this temperature. During sedimentary or tectonic burial of rocks, clay minerals may react diversely to organic matter due to heat flow features and the duration of heating (Aldega et al. 2005). The {{aim of this study}} was to correlate maximum paleotemperatures of the Oligocene Menilite Shales from the Polish Outer Carpathians determined based on vitrinite reflectance and Rock-Eval pyrolysis data to those calculated using I/S ratio. The analysis was performed on eight claystone samples collected from natural exposures of the Dukla Nappe. Four of them were taken in <b>tectonic</b> <b>windows</b> within the Magura Nappe: Świątkowa and Grybów <b>tectonic</b> <b>windows.</b> All samples were analyzed by vitrinite reflectance, Rock-Eval and smectite to illite conversion. Reflectance of vitrinite and huminite macerals was measured under oil immersion using Carl Zeiss Axioplan microscope in reflected white and blue (fluorescence) light. Standard deviation was calculated for all measurements. The values of Ro were converted into paleotemperatures according to Barker & Pawlewicz (1986). The degree of smectite to illite conversion is shown as the percentage of smectite (%S) in I/S. To define this percentage X-ray powder diffraction was used (Dudek & Środoń 1996 and references therein). Maximum paleotemperatures were estimated according to Šucha et al. (1993). Rock-Eval pyrolysis was conducted on Delsi Instruments apparatus equipped in TOC module to determine: a) total organic carbon content (TOC), b) the amount of residual hydrocarbons generated during pyrolysis of organic matter (S 2) and the temperature of maximum of S 2 peak (Tmax). The Rock-Eval data indicate that the analysed samples are rich in organic matter, predominantly of oil-prone Type II kerogen. Values of Tmax vary from 421 °C to 453 °C, and were re-calculated into vitrinite reflectance values using equation proposed by Jarvie et al. (2005) and then into paleotemperatures indicating range between 42 - 153 °C. The Ro values vary between 0. 45 - 1. 0 % indicating paleotemperatures between 51 - 154 °C. The analyzed rocks contain 12 - 40 % S in I/S suggesting paleotemperatures between 104 - 176 °C. Usually, paleotemperatures determined from I/S are higher than those achieved using organic indicators. In both, present and previous (Waliczek & Więcław 2013) studies, a strong positive correlation between organic maturity indicators was observed. The good correlation between the organic and inorganic paleotemperature indicators was noticed for all samples collected from <b>tectonic</b> <b>windows</b> of the Dukla Nappe, where organic matter is mature (above 0. 7 % in Ro scale). For samples containing immature or early-mature organic matter maximum paleotemperatures calculated from I/S data are 40 - 70 °C higher than those calculated based on results of organic matter investigations. The higher maturation of samples from <b>tectonic</b> <b>windows</b> than those from the Dukla Nappe are probably related to the overburden of these rocks by the Magura Nappe. Illitization process is probably time-independent (Pollastro 1993, Środoń 1995) whereas vitrinite reflectance stabilizes in normal burial coalification after about 106 - 107 years (Barker 1989). The good positive correlation between the organic and inorganic paleotemperature indicators occurs only for samples from <b>tectonic</b> <b>windows</b> which might lead to the conclusion that these sediments were temperature-affected by at least 106 years.

The foreland gneisses of the Charcot Land window are similar in age to parts of the allochthonous gneiss complexes of structurally overlying thrust sheets, but the two terranes have different lithological and structural characteristics. No Archaean rocks have been identified with certainty in any of the East Greenland Caledonian foreland windows...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Gran Paradiso Massif {{is one of}} the Internal Crystalline Massifs (Penninic Zone) in the Alps. This Massif {{comprises}} the widely investigated Gran Paradiso Unit and the underlying, much less-explored Money Unit, which is a well-exposed <b>tectonic</b> <b>window</b> below the Gran Paradiso Unit. This contribution provides a new detailed petro-structural map of the Money Unit. An integrated structural and metamorphic study can relate different structures to the evolving metamorphic stages. There is also recognition of evidence of Permo-Carboniferous sedimentation, contact metamorphism and polyphase Alpine evolution, mainly developed under blueschist to greenschist facies conditions. The 1 : 5000 scale map (and the cross sections) display evidence for the Alpine evolution of the Money Unit and for the structural and geological setting of this area. From these data, a 3 D model of the Money Unit and its folded contact with the Gran Paradiso Units is constructed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Structural and {{metamorphic}} {{data from}} the island of Amorgos (central Aegean Sea) show evidence {{for the existence of}} two distinct high-pressure units, the Metabasite Unit and the Basal Conglomerate Unit. These are exposed {{at the base of a}} thick marble sequence and overlying flysch deposits. The Metabasite Unit is characterized by a mineral assemblage of blue amphibole, garnet and clinopyroxene, indicating P–T conditions of 500 – 600 8 C and. 13 kbar. It is juxtaposed below carpholite-bearing metaconglomerates and quartz-rich micaschists of the Basal Conglomerate Unit, for which metamorphic conditions of 300 – 450 8 C and 10 – 14 kbar are estimated. The contact between the two units is interpreted as a low-angle detachment fault that accommodated top-to-the-NW sense of motion. The Amorgos succession above the Basal Conglomerate Unit collectively resembles the stratigraphy of external units in the Hellenides and could possibly be correlated with the so-called ‘Basal Unit’, which crops out in a number of <b>tectonic</b> <b>windows</b> throughout the Aegean Sea. This means that the Metabasite Unit in Amorgos could possibly represent the lowermost structural unit in the central Aegean Sea. The Hellenide–Anatolide belt in the central Aegean Sea (Fig. 1) represents a major complexity within the Alpine–Mediterranean orogenic system. This orogenic segment records a prolonged history of synsubduction high-pressure metamorphism and subse-quent large-scale extensional deformation (e. g. Dürr et al. 1978...|$|R
40|$|Expeditions 309 and 312 {{successfully}} completed the first sampling of an intact section of upper oceanic crust, through lavas and the sheeted dikes into the uppermost gabbros. Hole 1256 D, which was initiated on the Ocean Drilling Program’s (ODP) Leg 206, now penetrates to> 1500 mbsf and> 1250 m sub-basement. The first gabbroic rocks were encoun-tered at 1407 mbsf. Below this, the hole penetrates ~ 100 m into a complex zone of fractionated gabbros intruded into contact metamorphosed dikes. Deep Drilling of the Ocean Basement Drilling a complete in situ section of ocean crust {{has been an}} unfulfilled ambition of Earth scientists {{since the inception of}} ocean drilling that followed the audaciously ambitious Project MoHole, which was targeted to sample the first order seismic boundary named the Mohorovičić discontinuity (‘Moho’; see Bascom, 1961; Greenberg, 1974). The principal emphasis of Project MoHole was {{to understand the nature of}} the oceanic crust and the underlying uppermost mantle thought to be separated by the Moho at roughly 6 km depth below the ocean basins. Unfortunately, many of the key questions regarding the formation and evolution of the oceanic crust remain unanswered despite a further forty years of research; moreover, our sampling of the ocean crust remains extremely cursory (see compilations in Teagle et al., 2004; Wilson et al., 2003). Although offset drilling strategies, where deeper parts of the ocean crust are sampled by drilling in <b>tectonic</b> <b>windows,</b> have had notabl...|$|R
40|$|Three {{models are}} {{evaluated}} for restoring basement rocks coring <b>tectonic</b> <b>windows</b> (Window-Basement) in the Scandinavian Caledonides; parautochthonous (Model I) and allochthonous (models II/III), with initial imbrication of the Window-Basement post-dating or pre-dating, respectively, {{that in the}} external imbricate zone (Lower Allochthon). In Model I, the Window-Basement comes from the eastern margin of the basin now imbricated into the Lower Allochthon, while in models II/III {{it comes from the}} western margin. In Model II, the Window-Basement formed a basement-high between Tonian and Cryogenian sediments imbricated into the Middle and Lower allochthons; in Model III deposition of the Lower Allochthon sediments commenced in Ediacaran times. Balanced cross-sections and branch-line restorations of four transects (Finnmark–Troms, Västerbotten–Nordland, Jämtland–Trøndelag, Telemark–Møre og Romsdal) show similar restored lengths for the models in two transects and longer restorations for models II/III in the other transects. Model I can result in c. 280 km wide gaps in the restored Lower Allochthon, evidence for which is not seen in the sedimentology. The presence of < 3 km thick alluvial-fan deposits {{at the base of the}} Middle Allochthon indicates proximal, rapidly uplifting basement during Tonian–Cryogenian periods, taken as the origin of the Window-Basement during thrusting in models II/III. Model I requires multiple changes in thrusting-direction and predicts major thrusts or back-thrusts, currently unrecognized, separating parts of the Lower Allochthon; neither are required in models II/III. Metamorphic data are consistent with models II/III. Despite considerable along-strike structural variability in the external Scandinavian Caledonides, models II/III are preferred for the restoration of the Window-Basement...|$|R
