40|$|Porosity and {{permeability}} {{changes in}} deformation bands are commonly quantified using relatively low-resolution techniques, which invite host rock bias in measurement and inevitably underestimate {{the potential of}} these structures as fluid barriers.

Deformation bands are localised but laterally extensive sites of extreme porosity and permeability reduction, particularly in high porosity sandstones (Figure 1). In fact, permeability reductions of up to 3 orders of magnitude have been reported by Antonellini and Aydin, (1994). However, deformation bands in clay-rich sandstones may have a comparable flow barrier potential to certain sedimentary structures. This is because their porosity and permeability is not radically different to the host sandstone, which may have already low depositional porosities and permeabilities (Figure 2 a).

40|$|To {{ascertain}} {{the effectiveness of}} slacklining as a supplementary therapy for elderly stroke patients who are functionally non-progressing. This case study involved an 18 -mo prospective observation of the management of an 87 -year-old female stroke-patient of the left hemisphere with reduced balance, reduced lower limb muscular activation, hypertonia, and concurrent postural deficits. This entailed the initial acute care phase through to discharge to home and 18 -mo final status in her original independent living setting. The introduction of slacklining as an adjunct therapy was made 12 mo post incident. Slacklining involves balance retention on a <b>tightened</b> <b>band</b> where external environmental changes cause a whole-body dynamic response to retain equilibrium. It is a complex neuromechanical task enabling individualized self-developed response strategies to be learned and adapted. This facilitates the innate process of balance retention, lower-limb and core muscle activation, and stable posture {{through a combination of}} learned motor skills and neurological system down regulation. Individuals adopt and follow established sequential motor learning stages where the acquired balance skills are achieved in a challenging composite-chain activity. Slacklining could be considered an adjunct therapy for lower limb stroke rehabilitation where function is compromised due to decreased muscle recruitment, decreased postural control and compromised balance. Initial inpatient rehabilitation involved one-month acute-care, one-month rehabilitation, and one-month transitional care prior to home discharge. A further six months of intensive outpatient rehabilitation was provided with five hourly sessions per week including:supervised and self-managed hydrotherapy, plus one individual and two group falls 2 ̆ 7 prevention sessions. These were supported by daily home exercises. At 12 mo post incident, recovery plateaued, then regressed following three falls. Rehabilitation was subsequently modified with the hydrotherapy retained and the group sessions replaced with an additional individual session supplemented with slacklining. The slacklining followed stages one and two of a standardized five-stage protocol. Self-reported functional progression resumed with improvement by 14 mo which further increased and was sustained 18 mo (Students 2 ̆ 7 t test P 3 ̆c 0. 05).

According to the statistics of several researchers, it has been reported as high as that the rate of headache patientsamongcivilianpopulations is 40 ~ 65 %(1). A tension type headache is the most common type among several kinds of headaches. Even though its frequencyandduration is diverse, the symptomgener-ally showseverydayandpersists for fromseveralhours to several months.

The objective was to study the efficacy of some locally available botanicals to control Sitophilus zeamais Mostch and to determine the length of period the grain could be protected by the different treatments. For comparison, two more treatments-standard check Malathion 5 % dust plus control (untreated check) were included; and the experiment was replicated three times. The experiment was conducted under room temperature at 25 - 28 °C and relative humidity at 70 ± 5 % in Kombolcha Plant Health Clinic Laboratory.

40|$|BackgroundPulmonary artery banding is {{proposed}} {{as a first}} palliation in infants with complex congenital heart disease and high pulmonary blood flow. In addition, it {{may be used to}} retrain the left ventricle. Optimal tightening may be difficult to obtain, leading to reoperation. An implantable device for pulmonary artery banding with telemetric control was recently developed allowing for repeated adjustments, but it is presently limited to patients weighing less than 20 kg. In large animals, we tested an off-label adjustable gastric banding system for pulmonary artery banding. Methods and ResultsFourteen ewes weighing 50 to 75 kg underwent implantation of the Lap-Band device (BioEnterics Corp, Santa Barbara, Calif) around the main pulmonary artery through a left thoracotomy. All had functional evaluation with progressive occlusion and opening of the device at implantation and every 2 weeks until sacrifice immediately after implantation (group 1, n = 8), at 1 month (group 2, n = 3), at 3 months (group 3, n = 3), or death. Invasive pressure measurements in the right ventricle and aorta were carried out each time. Devices were easily implanted in all animals. Progressive occlusion and reopening were possible in all animals during each time point. Two animals died of right heart failure related to excessive <b>tightening</b> of the <b>band.</b> Retrieval of the device without any major damage was possible in 12 of 14 animals.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In late-diagnosed {{transposition}} of {{the great}} arteries (TGA), the left ventricle (LV) involutes as it pumps against low resistance and needs retraining by applying a pulmonary artery band (PAB) in preparation for an arterial switch operation. We report our experience with a telemetrically adaptable band compared with classic banding. METHODS: Ten patients underwent retraining of the LV, 4 patients with an adaptable band and progressive weekly <b>tightening</b> of the <b>band</b> (group 1) and 6 patients with a traditional band (group 2). RESULTS: Mean weight and age at pulmonary band placement was 5. 8 ± 2. 36 kg and 11. 7 ± 11. 1 months for group 1 and 5. 0 ± 2. 3 kg and 6. 4 ± 7. 6 months for group 2. Time between palliation and switch procedure was 4. 2 months in both groups. Group 1 showed an initial mean pulmonary gradient of 25. 5 ± 4. 43 mm Hg with a 5 % closure of the device. The mean gradient increased with progressive closure to 63. 5 ± 9. 8 mm Hg {{at the time of}} the arterial switch operation. There were no reinterventions or deaths in this group. In group 2, the mean pulmonary gradient increased with growth from 49 ± 21. 4 mm Hg to 68. 4 ± 7. 86 mm Hg {{at the time of the}} switch procedure. However, 4 of these patients required reoperations during retraining: 2 needed 1 reoperation and 2 needed 2 reoperations. Two patients died- 1 after banding and 1 after the switch operation. CONCLUSIONS: Retraining of the LV by the adaptable device allows precise control of the tightening, avoids repetitive operations, and diminishes morbidity...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} thesis {{presents an}} analysis of the torsional loads on V-band clamps. In some applications, the relative rotational movement of the flanges connected by V-band clamps can result in catastrophic system failure. The ability to understand the factors impacting on torsional load capacity is therefore essential. In this research project, a theoretical model of a V-band joint subjected to torsional loads was developed. This model is used to identify those parameters that will impact on the joint’s reliability. An experimental investigation was conducted to validate a theoretical model using a newly developed test rig. The development and features of this test rig are presented in this report. This experimental investigation also allowed the impact of those parameters that are difficult to control, to be determined. A total of three V-bands were used with different diameters but nominally identical cross sections were studied. In the research results, the initial slip point between flanges and the V-band clamp was identified by experimentation within this research project. Different sizes of Vbands were used under boundary conditions and loads. From the simulation results it was determned that the friction effect on the V-band depends {{on the size of the}} V-band. For the largest size of V-band, there was moderate correlation of the experimental and theoretical results. For the smallest size, the results suggest that with <b>band</b> <b>tightening,</b> flange contact is localised, rather than being throughout the band’s entire circumference. The research demonstrated the significant relevance of the band and flanges’ contact points and the coefficient of friction, especially that between the flanges, on the V-band clamp’s theoretical torsional load capacit...|$|R
60|$|From {{whatever}} {{point of}} view {{the writings of the}} Old Testament may be regarded, the picture they present of a national development is of high interest and speciality, nor can their historic momentousness be much affected by any varieties of theory as to the relation they bear to the New Testament or to the rise and constitution of Christianity. Whether we accept the canonical Hebrew books as a revelation or simply as part of an ancient literature, makes no difference {{to the fact that we}} find there the strongly characterised portraiture of a people educated from an earlier or later period to a sense of separateness unique in its intensity, a people taught by many concurrent influences to identify faithfulness to its national traditions with the highest social and religious blessings. Our too scanty sources of Jewish history, from the return under Ezra to the beginning of the desperate resistance against Rome, show us the heroic and triumphant struggle of the Maccabees, which rescued the religion and independence of the nation from the corrupting sway of the Syrian Greeks, adding to the glorious sum of its memorials, and stimulating continuous efforts of a more peaceful sort to maintain and develop that national life which the heroes had fought and died for, by internal measures of legal administration and public teaching. Thenceforth the virtuous elements of the Jewish life were engaged, as they had been with varying aspects during the long and changeful prophetic period and the restoration under Ezra, on the side of preserving the specific national character against a demoralising fusion with that of foreigners whose religion and ritual were idolatrous and often obscene. There was always a Foreign party reviling the National party as narrow, and sometimes manifesting their own breadth in extensive views of advancement or profit to themselves by flattery of a foreign power. Such internal conflict naturally <b>tightened</b> the <b>bands</b> of conservatism, which needed to be strong if it were to rescue the sacred ark, the vital spirit of a small nation--"the smallest of the nations"--whose territory lay on the highway between three continents; and when the dread and hatred of foreign sway had condensed itself into dread and hatred of the Romans, many Conservatives became Zealots, whose chief mark was that they advocated resistance to the death against the submergence of their nationality. Much might be said on this point towards distinguishing the desperate struggle against a conquest which is regarded as degradation and corruption, from rash, hopeless insurrection against an established native government; and for my part (if that were of any consequence) I share the spirit of the Zealots. I take the spectacle of the Jewish people defying the Roman edict, and preferring death by starvation or the sword to the introduction of Caligula's deified statue into the temple, as a sublime type of steadfastness. But all that need be noticed here is the continuity of that national education (by outward and inward circumstance) which created in the Jews a feeling of race, a sense of corporate existence, unique in its intensity.|$|R

Little is known however, {{of the effect of}} interspinous devices on intersegmental range of motion (ROM). The aim of this in vivo study was to investigate the effect of a novel minimally invasive interspinous implant, InSwing, on sagittal plane ROM of the lumbar spine using an ovine model. Ten adolescent Merino lambs underwent a destabilization procedure at the L 1 -L 2 level simulating a stenotic degenerative spondylolisthesis (as described in our earlier work; Spine 15 : 571 - 576, 1990). All animals were placed in a side-lying posture and lateral radiographs were taken in full flexion and extension of the trunk in a standardized manner. Radiographs were repeated following the insertion of an 8 -mm InSwing interspinous device at L 1 -L 2, and again with the implant secured by means of a tension <b>band</b> <b>tightened</b> to 1 N/m around the L 1 and L 2 spinous processes. ROM was assessed {{in each of the three}} conditions and compared using Cobb's method. A paired t-test compared ROM for each of the experimental conditions (P < 0. 05). After instrumentation with the InSwing interspinous implant, the mean total sagittal ROM (from full extension to full flexion) was reduced by 16 % from 6. 3 degrees to 5. 3 +/- 2. 7 degrees. The addition of the tension band resulted in a 43 % reduction in total sagittal ROM to 3. 6 +/- 1. 9 degrees which approached significance. When looking at flexion only, the addition of the interspinous implant without the tension band did not significantly reduce lumbar flexion, however, a statistically significant 15 % reduction in lumbar flexion was observed with the addition of the tension band (P = 0. 01). To our knowledge, this is the first in vivo study radiographically showing the advantage of using an interspinous device to stabilize the spine in flexion. These results are important findings particularly for patients with clinical symptoms related to instable degenerative spondylolisthesis. Journal ArticleResearch Support, Non-U. S.

Alešiju atribuira 9 reljefa (br 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11, 11, 16, 19) The author {{concludes that}} {{the fate of the}} largest Early Renaissance {{architectural}} and sculptural monument in Croatia - The Chapel of St. John in Trogir, which was added to the Trogir cathedral 1468 - 1482 - has been that throughout this century scholars have almost exclusively carried out research on the 15 sculptures in niches and almost entirely forgotten the 143 reliefs showing children 2 ̆ 7 s figures and heads. This extraordinary disproportion between a lively interest in sculpture and the neglect of reliefs, has had a harmful effect on the interpretation and evaluation of the chapee, because the Trogir reliefs are not only the largest gallery of children 2 ̆ 7 s figures in the quattrocento, but they are an integral art of a building, which is itself unique in the Earkly Renaissance art of Europe. The author has undertaken the publication of an analytical and critical catalogue of these reliefs. In a number of studies he has established the iconographic stratigraphy of this chapel-mausoleum (an unusual feature of which is that besides Earth and Heaven, the Underworld is also shown), and has published studies of the 17 cornices of leaves and fruit around the oculi (which are in fact realistic "still lifes"), 96 reliefs of children 2 ̆ 7 s heads - seraphs on the coffered vault, 16 putti - telamoni on pillars and 9 angels in the relief Coronation of the Virgin in the lunette above the altar. In this essay he treats the last group of children 2 ̆ 7 s figures, genii torchbearers peeping out of the slightly opened doors of the Underworld, serving as the back of the stone pew that goes around the inside of the chapel and {{at the foot of the}} pilasters at the entrance. In the contract of 4 January 1468, they are refered to as the spiritelli, and the author define the as small spirits of the Underworld, Classical genii emerging with torches thorugh the door that separates the world of the living from the Kingdom of Shadows. In this contract Nikola Firentinac (Niccolo di Giovanni Fiorentino) and Andrija Aleši promised to make reliefs: et tra vne e I 2 ̆ 7 altro di dicti pilastrelli die esser a similitudine d 2 ̆ 7 vna portella, de la qual jusir de vn spiritello de longeza de pie 3 tenedo in mano vna fiasella per vno, che sarano per numero XVII. The author records that the Chapel was not entirely carried out according to the contract, and that every change required a larger number of human figures, decorative motifs were changed into figural ones, easier tasks into more difficult ones. Such treatment is typical of great creative artists such as Firentinac, who was the author of the project. Instead of 17 genii, 21 were made. According to the contract there were supposed to be three garlands at the foot of the pilasters, but instead there are four more figures genii with torches in relief o the back and front, and on the side towards the passage there is a bouquet of acanthus. The genii with torches in relief are placed in the following way: 4 at the foot of the pilasters, 6 on each of the side walls and 5 behind the altar. The author numbers them starting from the south-west pilaster as it is marked in ground-plan. After a thorough analysis and interpretation of every single relief, the author separates in typology or quality Nikola 2 ̆ 7 s reliefs which are better from Andrija 2 ̆ 7 s. But he considers that the dilemma of some researhcers, about a third artist being involved, should not be relinquished. He does, however, (following C. Fisković) reject the assumption that Duknović made two or three angels with thick hair decorated with ribbons and roses as I. Delalle wrote, and also the idea that the best reliefs might be the work of Laurana 2 ̆ 7 s followers, as Venturi suggested. He does agree however, that the reliefs of the genii on the back and front of the pilasters of the triumphal arch iconographically, typologically and in quality can be distinguished from the others. In the two outside ones the doors are differently treated, and the two inner ones do not have doors at all. The genii are specific and typologically different in treatment: more graceful and more delicate. Author states that their prettyness helps us to notice the essential realistic vitality and authenticity of work that is definitely Nikola 2 ̆ 7 s. However, every individual work has its own range in quality, scale and variants of typology, so it is not always easy, to decide whether it is the highest reach of the same author or another author. Although he agrees with C. Fisković that, in quality, these reliefs are not better than others by Firentinac, another leaves open the possibility of a third author being involved because of their different character. For now it is most logical to presume that they are the work of Duknović. This assumption is supported by the fact that the four reliefs at the foot of the pilasters were not in the contract. They may have been added so as to offer the possibility, as hommage, to a great sculptor who happened to find himself in Trogir at the time, to leave his mark on the most important project and Renaissance monument in the town. This has already been proved in the case of two sculptures by Duknović in the same chapel, St. John Evangelist and St. Thomas. The genii of the east pilaster, (numbers 20 and 21) might be attributed to Duknović also beccause of the way the hair is treated in voluminous locks, and the round face (like the genius shieldbearer and torchbearer from the small Ćipiko Palace). The genius at the front has a high forehead, thicker hair, the flame of the torch has been treated in an original way and at the bottom of the torch there is a band, similar to those on the reliefs attributed to Duknović. If these assumptions are right, we may see the two front reliefs at the foot of the trimphal arch, as representation and competition between the two greates sculptors of 15 t h century Dalmatia: Firentinac (left) and Duknović (right). Treating the typology, an aspect in common to all the reliefs on the three walls of the chapel (numbers 3 to 19), is that the genii are emerging from double, cassetted doors, one wing parallel to the wall, and the other half opened towards the inside. The doors on the front of the bases of the pilasters are different, because one side has only three cassettes. The doors are opened from left or right, which accordingly means that the genii can be placed on the left or right side of the composition. The number of the left and right doors is the same, and they do not alternate in any special order. On some reliefs one side of the door is completely closed and on some it is slightly opened (this is mostly in Aleši 2 ̆ 7 s reliefs). Thre are also two types of torches: the first is a sheaf of thicker, straight sticks (usually three), it widens at the top and is connected spirally by a leather band. The second type consists of thinner sticks (usually five), <b>tightened</b> with transversal <b>bands</b> so they are slightly convex. In the first type the sticks are treated like cane (they have "joints"). The flame is treated in a realistic manner, so that a separate tongue of flame comes out of each stick. The variants and quality are mostly similar to that of the locks of hair. Although they are generally naked, some genii have some kind of clothing: one has a short dress (sleeveless tunic), two have shorts, two have leaves around their waist (vine leaves and ivy leaves), two have socks, and three of them have a piece of fluttering cloth around their sholuders, one has a rose wreath on his head and another has a flower. When it comes to quality Nikola 2 ̆ 7 s genii have harmonious proportions and the modelation is softer (Aleši 2 ̆ 7 s are often stocky and their heads are too big), the facial details are more delicate, the hair is treated in a livelier manner, often the classical hairstyle (while Aleši 2 ̆ 7 s sometimes have hair like a helmet, in block), their poses and gestures are more convincing and real (for example blowing into the torch, hiding their eyes), and especially the different position of their fingers (I have called one the Fagot Player because he is holding his torch like a musical instrument, 6), while Aleši 2 ̆ 7 s always hold their fingers pressed toghether and parallel. According to the interpretation of every single genius and to comparative analysis, the criteria being typology and quality, 12 reliefs can be attributed to Nikola Firentinac (numbers 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 12, 13, 15, 17, 18, 20 ?, 21 ?). We can see from the numbering, that they were often put up in pairs. Aleši 2 ̆ 7 s are numbers 3, 4, 8, 9, 10, 11 ?, 14, 15, 19 (four reliefs in a row: the very west one and three on the north wall are behind the altar). The difference in number of Nikola 2 ̆ 7 a and Aleši 2 ̆ 7 s reliefs may also support the thesis that at least two reliefs of high quality are the work of another author, probably Duknović, (numbers 20 and 21). All the author 2 ̆ 7 s studies to date, are collected and published in R. Ivančević, The Early Renaissance in Trogir, Split 1977. The book does not include two texts: R. I., "Putinj Boy - Telamons of the Trogir Chapel" (1468 - 1482), Peristil 37, Zagreb 1994, pp 33 - 48 and R. I., "Reconstruction of the Altar of Trogir Chapel by Firentinac", Peristil 38, Zagreb, 1995, pp 51 - 58 in which the author deals with another relief showing the angel candlebearer...|$|R
