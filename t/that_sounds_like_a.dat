5|$|A noisy species, {{the female}} has the deep quack stereotypically {{associated}} with ducks. Male mallards {{make a sound}} phonetically {{similar to that of}} the female, a typical quack, but it is a deep and raspy and can also sound like breeeeze. When incubating a nest, or when offspring are present, females vocalise differently, making a call <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> truncated version of the usual quack. They hiss if the nest or offspring are threatened or interfered with. When taking off, the wings of a mallard produce a characteristic faint whistling noise.|$|E
5|$|In a B plot, Andy (Chris Pratt) {{is doing}} well in his new job as the Pawnee shoeshiner, and Ron pays for a shine. Ron is {{impressed}} when Andy actually eases the pain from his bunion, and he later purposely scuffs his shoe {{so he can get}} a second shine. Andy is initially flattered, but starts to grow uncomfortable when Ron returns for a third shoeshine. This time, Ron makes an involuntary noise <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> sexual moan, seriously embarrassing both men. After a day of avoiding each other, Ron and Andy discuss the noise and decide {{it would be best to}} simply pretend it never happened.|$|E
25|$|Stereotypical pirate accents are {{modeled on}} those of Cornwall, South Devon or the Bristol Channel area in South West England, though {{they can also}} be based on Elizabethan era English or other parts of the world. Pirates in film, {{television}} and theatre are generally depicted as speaking English in a particular accent and speech pattern <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> stylized West Country accent, exemplified by Robert Newton's performance as Long John Silver in the 1950 film Treasure Island. A native of the West Country in south west England from where many famous English pirates hailed, Newton also used the same strong West Country accent in Blackbeard the Pirate (1952).|$|E

25|$|A {{very rare}} form {{includes}} the diaphragmatic flutter, the Belly Dancer's Syndrome, or Van Leeuwenhoek's disease. It was first described by Antony van Leeuwenhoek in 1723, {{who suffered from}} it. The condition characterizes spoken communication <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> short-breathed hiccup. These muscle spasms can recur dozens of times per day. Rate of diaphragmatic contraction ranges between 35 and 480 contractions per minute, with the average rate found to be 150. Studies show that possible causes include disruptions within the central or peripheral nervous systems, anxiety, nutritional disorder, and certain pharmaceuticals. No single treatment has proven effective, though blocking or crushing of the phrenic nerve can provide instantaneous relief when pharmacologic treatment has proven ineffective.|$|E
500|$|Musically, {{the album}} is more {{electronic}} and beat-driven than preceding releases, with reviewers commenting that its sound is at times reminiscent of KMFDM. This {{has been attributed to}} Sköld, {{who was a member of}} that band immediately prior to his arrival in Marilyn Manson. It is also not as metallic as their earlier work, with Manson explaining to MTV that he wanted to create music which was dissimilar to the nu metal being played on radio at the time. He also noted the influence of early industrial rock acts such as Ministry, Big Black and Nitzer Ebb on the material. Early twentieth-century German composer Kurt Weill was also claimed as an influence, along with the lucid dreams Manson was having during the album's production, elaborating that he would [...] "wake up and say, 'I want to write a song <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> stampeding elephant' or 'I want to write a song <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> burning piano'." ...|$|E
500|$|New prog {{describes}} {{the wave of}} progressive rock bands in the 2000s who revived the genre. According to Entertainment Weeklys Evan Serpick: [...] "Along with recent success stories like System of a Down and up-and-comers like the Dillinger Escape Plan, Lightning Bolt, and Coheed and Cambria, the Mars Volta create incredibly complex and inventive music <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> heavier, more aggressive version of ’70s behemoths such as Led Zeppelin and King Crimson." ...|$|E

It's in Hawaii, right? I can do that!'" [...] Cuse later commented, [...] "He's quite a good actor. People only {{think of him as}} the doobie-smoking '70s dude.

However, Homer {{mistakes}} the whistle for an actual cougar, and shoots Moe in the leg. After Homer apologizes, he, along with Moe, R.E.M. {{and the rest of the}} Simpson family return to Moe’s tavern, reverted to its original decor, for a Thanksgiving meal of a turkey, made [...] "entirely of tofu and gluten" [...] and provided by Michael Stipe, who is an environmentalist.|$|E
500|$|With Poquita Ropa, Arjona {{wanted to}} {{drastically}} change his musical style. He {{tried to use}} as few instruments as possible, resulting in a production <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> capella performances. Arjona said about the album, [...] "music and women look better with little clothes", and that [...] "they [...] are like women; they get things up and are so concerned about this that they forget that the less clothes, more beauty. The songs are often overwhelmed by ourselves, because we saturate them with arrangements looking to exalt their qualities and we end up hiding them." ...|$|E

500|$|Poquita Ropa {{is similar}} in style to Arjona's work on Galería Caribe (2000). With the album, Arjona wanted to {{drastically}} change his musical style. He tried to use as few instruments as possible, resulting in a production <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> cappella performances. Arjona talking about the album, stated that [...] "music and women look better with little clothes", and that [...] "they [...] are like women; they get things up and are so concerned about this that they forget that the less clothes, more beauty.

500|$|The song divided music critics. Sasha Geffen {{from the}} Chicago Reader gave a {{positive}} {{review of the}} track, complimenting it for bringing the underground PC Music to the mainstream, adding that [...] "between Diplo's blocky breakdowns and Sophie's slippery arpeggios, s a provocative piece of work [...] The shift from SoundCloud to superstars was always coming—it {{just so happens that}} Madonna is the one who carried it over." [...] Another positive review came from [...] Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph, who elaborated: [...] "he track in question fizzes with bright energy, a handclapping rave anthem powered by a fantastically wonky synth line <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> vintage arcade game played on an electronic kazoo, and topped off with a snappy Nicki Minaj rap. Madonna delivers the melody like a playground nursery rhyme, chanting about bad behavior in a butter-wouldn't-melt sing-song voice." ...|$|E
500|$|Since the band's 1960s heyday, the {{influence}} of the Monks has grown steadily, beginning with krautrock then followed by successive generations of musicians in disparate genres such as punk rock, experimental, alternative and hip-hop, with acts such as the Dead Kennedys, the Beastie Boys, the White Stripes, and the Fall exhibiting signs of their influence. Music historian Kelley Stoltz described the Monks in 1996 as a group that [...] "overwhelms the listener with a sound they termed 'over-beat' - at their worst it is totally oddball freakrock <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> pleasurable argument". Stoltz concluded the band was an innovative musical act which [...] "outsexed the [...] Pistols" [...] ten years before any other punk band emerged. In his book, The Rough Guide to Rock, writer Peter Buckley had said Black Monk Time has not [...] "aged one iota. If anything, it has gotten stranger".|$|E

500|$|Roth rewrote {{the lyrics}} for most tracks, {{as he wanted}} to {{incorporate}} {{a point of view}} from his current personal life. He declared that: [...] "All music is autobiographic. Particularly when it's not meant to be", adding that by retooling the songs [...] "there is a body of new that meets halfway there, that I think makes very colorful sense." [...] Only lead single [...] "Tattoo" [...] contains a synthesizer, which was played by Roth. Two other songs, [...] "You and Your Blues" [...] and [...] "As Is", have a processed guitar <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> synth. Roth also performs acoustic guitar on the intro for [...] "Stay Frosty"—a song that he had written which was re-arranged by Wolfgang. Among the effects units used by Eddie on the album were his signature model MXR Phase 90, a Whammy pedal, and a Wah-wah pedal. The latter is prominently featured on the [...] "kind of Hendrix-ish" [...] "The Trouble with Never".|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Author Lucy O'Brien {{wrote in her}} biography, , that the techno composition and the stuttering vocals made the song [...] "an almost anti-Bond theme". James Hannaham from Spin was positive in his review, writing {{that it is a}} [...] "brilliant, melodramatic song, <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> stoic response to a world gone mad." [...] Writing for Yahoo! Music, Dan Gennoe felt that since the songs in American Life mostly gave prominence to style over substance, [...] "Die Another Day" [...] as a result had become one-dimensional. Stylus Magazine's Ed Howard described the song as [...] "a great slice-and-dice hit of fucked-up electroclash", in an otherwise negative review for American Life. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine considered it [...] "forward-thinking" [...] and believed that the record was added to American Lifes track list to ensure that the album would not be devoid of a hit song. Clover described the track as [...] "A blistering zeitgeist-negation, hostile and uneasy—as a single, a club track, a Bond theme." [...] Chuck Taylor from Billboard was positive in his response, saying that the electronic effects rendered Madonna's vocals as non-discernible but the composition was forward thinking from Music (2000), her eighth studio album.|$|E
500|$|... "Yummy" [...] {{was written}} by Stefani and Pharrell Williams, while The Neptunes handled the track's production. Its style can be {{described}} as dance pop that contains a day-glo rap. As described by Mark Pytlik from Pitchfork, the song [...] "mov from a skeletal rhythmic backbone and resound 'Milkshake'-pitching triangle into a spiraling melody line <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Sherman Brothers outtake". Writing for Slant Magazine, Sal Cinquemani also compared it to Kelis' 2003 single [...] "Milkshake", and stated it [...] "finally gives a name to Pharrell's percussive minimalism". The recording opens with a [...] "subdued, subtle and quiet atmosphere", while the outro consists of [...] "scary and demented circus music", which serves as a [...] "voyage into a mechanic's shop". Stefani discusses roles of a homemaker in the lyrics, singing: [...] "I know you've been waiting but I've been out making babies" [...] and [...] "Man, there's so much heat beneath these clothes / It's time to make you sweat". Food imagery is continually mentioned in its lyrics, which Quentin B. Huff, writing for PopMatters, saw as an imitation of [...] "Milkshake". The chorus consists of a [...] "serious" [...] and repetitive coo, where she sings [...] "I'm feeling yummy head to toe".|$|E
500|$|Life {{magazine}} called the speech [...] "demagogic slander <b>that</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> script for Radio Hanoi", and The Washington Post declared that King had [...] "diminished his usefulness to his cause, his country, his people." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The Count Bishops were a fine, energetic, R&B-based band {{capable of}} kicking out a fierce racket of noise <b>that</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> grimier version of seminal British R&B revivalists Dr. Feelgood." [...] (John Dougan, Allmusic) ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Has he {{got over}} his fatigue?' pursued the dogged Baronet, with a short, gritty laugh, <b>that</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> loose drag-chain {{dangling}} against the stones. 'We all thought the Yorkshire air {{would not agree}} with him.' ...|$|R
500|$|The song {{received}} mixed reviews. [...] Alexis Petridis from The Guardian {{compared the}} song to [...] "Diva", stating that [...] "Video Phone" [...] is [...] "Almost equally weird, but much better, [...] introduces {{us to the}} unlikely figure of Beyoncé Knowles, amateur pornographer: 'You want me naked? If you like this position you can tape it.' She doesn't make for the world's most believable Reader's Wife, but it doesn't matter, because the spare, eerie backdrop of groans and echoing electronics is so thrilling." [...] A writer of Rolling Stone said that Knowles sings in a [...] "dirty groove on the slippery" [...] song. Colin Mcguire from PopMatters wrote that [...] "'Video Phone' is sexy enough {{to the point where}} it almost becomes uncomfortable to think of her listening back to this with her father in the room." [...] Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine commented that the song ended the album abruptly. Daniel Brockman of The Phoenix noted that the song was [...] "smutty" [...] for an artist like Knowles. J. Freedom du Lac of The Washington Post chose the song as a highlight on I Am... Sasha Fierce saying, [...] "The moaning, groaning 'Video Phone' positions Beyoncé as the star of a sex tape set to a thrillingly spare soundtrack <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Nine Inch Nails instrumental." [...] A negative review for the song was given by Bernard Zuel of The Sydney Morning Herald who described it as [...] "awful".|$|E
500|$|Billboard critic Keith Claufield {{singled out}} the song as a {{highlight}} from the album {{and called it}} [...] "a cousin of Justin Timberlake's 'Cry Me a River'." [...] Also from Billboard, Michael Paoletta called it a [...] "sexy, skittery, beat-driven hip-pop number <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> Timbaland production". He concluded that [...] " [...] definitely deserves a shot at mainstream top 40 and rhythmic success". Like Paoletta, Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine too compared {{the production of the}} song to that of Timbaland. The [...] "Boy! Boy" [...] hook of the song and its synthpop style were praised by Spin magazine, who felt that they [...] "demonstrate that even in the 21st century, Kylie wears the 1980s well." [...] Writing for NME, John Robinson found [...] "Red Blooded Woman" [...] to be better than [...] "Slow", the lead single from the album, and called it [...] "excellent cutting edge pop in a great single by the Justin Timberlake or Sugababes way." [...] Adrien Begrand from PopMatters favoured its [...] "almost garage-like beat" [...] and appreciated the lyric [...] "You'll never get to Heaven if you're scared of getting high." [...] Louis Vartel from the LGBT oriented website NewNownext, ranked it at number 46 on his list of the singer's 48 greatest songs, in honor of her 48th birthday. He hailed it a [...] "sweaty dip in self-possession and sex appeal". A reviewer from Sputnikmusic called it [...] "equally as strong as (if not stronger than)" [...] lead single [...] "Slow".|$|E
500|$|James Montogomery from MTV commented: [...] " [...] all pulsing sirens, wobbly {{bass and}} four-on-the-floor beat, with an {{expansive}} electro chorus <b>that</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> truckload of Nintendo Entertainment Systems exploding in unison (only sexier)." [...] Frase McAlpine from BBC gave the song three out five stars and said: [...] "I can't {{be the only}} person in the world who is slightly disappointed that this song isn't a jaunty '80 syn-disco rave up, in which Madge skips around in a big pink wig, like she used to in the olden days." [...] He went on to add that [...] "Celebration" [...] is a decent dance track for Madonna to play on her tours. Stephen M. Deusner of Pitchfork Media complimented the song, calling it [...] "personality-driven pop" [...] in which Madonna has never sounded more convincing. Deusner added that the track sounds like [...] "it's conjuring several of Madonna's younger selves" [...] in its modest goal to just make people move. Sarah Crompton from The Daily Telegraph said that the song is infinitely forgettable. Popjustice named the song one of the best 100 singles of 2009. Louis Virtel of The Backlot included the song at number sixty-five on his list of [...] "The 100 Greatest Madonna Songs," [...] referring to the track as a [...] "rollicking dance jam" [...] that is a [...] "perfect companion piece to [...] other testament to celebration, Holiday.” At the 52nd Grammy Awards, the song received a nomination in the Best Dance Recording category.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{did hear}} {{something}} <b>that</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> quarrel or a fray," [...] John Wilkes said, [...] "but {{there is nothing}} unusual about that. As everything was soon quiet again, I gave no further thought to it." ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{reviewing}} Dub Housing, critic John Dougan writes, [...] "Ravenstine, {{who may be}} one of {{the all-time}} great synth players colors the sound with ominous whooshes of distortions, blips, and blurbs <b>that</b> <b>sound</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> sped-up Pong game." ...|$|R
