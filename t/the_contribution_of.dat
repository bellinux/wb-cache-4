40|$|This chapter {{introduces}} {{the field of}} intrinsically motivated learning systems and illustrates the content, objectives, and organisation of the book. The chapter first expands the concept of intrinsic motivations, then introduces a taxonomy of three classes of intrinsic-motivation mechanisms (based on predictors, on novelty detection, and on competence), and finally introduces and reviews <b>the</b> various <b>contributions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> book. <b>The</b> <b>contributions</b> are organised into six parts. <b>The</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first part provide general overviews {{on the concept of}} intrinsic motivations, the possible mechanisms that may implement them, and the functions that they can play. <b>The</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> second, third, and fourth parts focus on the three classes of the aforementioned intrinsic-motivation mechanisms. <b>The</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fifth part discuss mechanisms that are complementary to intrinsic motivations. <b>The</b> <b>contributions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sixth part introduce tools and experimental paradigms {{that can be used to}} investigate intrinsic motivation...|$|R

5|$|Darwin's speculations on {{the origin}} of species {{convinced}} him that cross-fertilisation {{played an important role in}} keeping specific forms consistent. He rejected the doctrine that the characteristics of a species were static, and was aware from animal husbandry that inbreeding could lead to changes, often deleterious. He thought that natural outbreeding through cross-fertilisation would keep wild species homogenous yet vigorous. Cross-fertilisation would confer an evolutionary advantage by spreading favourable changes throughout a reproductive community. His ideas were contrary to the common supposition that plants were usually self-fertilising, and so every summer Darwin investigated <b>the</b> <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> insect pollination to the cross-pollination of flowers.|$|E

The 707B and 707A proved the design's validity and gave confidence in the delta planform. A second 707A, WZ736 and a two-seat 707C, WZ744 were also constructed but they played no part in the 698's development.|$|E
5|$|Edgar T.

Herb Wagner, in 1953, suggested instead {{that it was the}} hybrid of A.montanum and A.platyneuron, noting that Eaton and W. N. Clute had already made tentative suggestions along those lines. His cytological studies the following year showed that A.bradleyi was an allotetraploid, the product of hybridization between A.montanum and A.platyneuron to form a sterile diploid, followed by chromosome doubling that restored fertility.|$|E

5|$|The Court {{made clear}} that the {{interests}} of children should be assumed to be covered as part of the interests of the parent, not treated as separate, but this doctrine has been less clear in practice as termination proceedings still focus on the fitness of the parent.

Santosky has also contributed to the role of parental rights of undocumented immigrants as the constitutionally protected parental rights may apply to non-citizens as well as United States citizens.|$|E

5|$|The {{effect can}} also be derived by using either the exact Schwarzschild metric (describing spacetime around a spherical mass) or the much more general post-Newtonian formalism.

Relativistic precession has been observed for all planets that allow for accurate precession measurements (Mercury, Venus, and Earth), as well as in binary pulsar systems, where it is larger by five orders of magnitude.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} wild {{ancestor of}} Malus pumila was Malus sieversii, found growing wild {{in the mountains}} of Central Asia in southern Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Xinjiang, China. Cultivation of the species, most likely beginning on the forested flanks of the Tian Shan mountains, progressed {{over a long period of}} time and permitted secondary introgression of genes from other species into the open-pollinated seeds. Significant exchange with Malus sylvestris, the crabapple, resulted in current populations of apples being more related to crabapples than to the more morphologically similar progenitor Malus sieversii. In strains without recent admixture <b>the</b> <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> the latter predominates.|$|E
5|$|These direct pain inputs, {{as well as}} {{indirect}} inputs, {{are thought}} to induce long-term pain avoidance behavior that results in chronic posture changes and consequently, in functional and anatomical remodeling of vestibular and proprioceptive nuclei.

The magnitude of this remodeling and the induction of neuron progenitor markers suggest <b>the</b> <b>contribution</b> <b>of</b> adult neurogenesis to these changes.|$|E
