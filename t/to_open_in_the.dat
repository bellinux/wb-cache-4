5|$|In 2006 Bayern {{purchased}} {{land near}} the Allianz Arena {{with the purpose}} of building a new youth academy. In 2015 the project, estimated to cost €70 million, was started, after overcoming internal resistance. The main reasons for the project were that the existing facilities were too small and that the club, while very successful at senior level, lacked competitiveness with other German and European clubs at youth level. The new facility is scheduled <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2017–18 season.|$|E
5|$|The Pavilion Theatre {{opened on}} Nos.191–193Whitechapel Road, {{the site of}} a former clothes factory, in 1828.

The {{original}} building was destroyed in a fire in 1856, and was replaced by a larger theatre that could accommodate over 1,000 people, becoming the centre of Yiddish theatre in Britain. It closed in 1934.|$|E

5|$|A left-handed opening batsman, Morris {{played in}} all five Tests, partnering the {{right-handed}} Sid Barnes in three Tests; Barnes {{was injured in}} the Third and Fourth Tests. Barnes was unable <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> former and did not play in the latter. Three opening batsmen were taken on the tour, with Bill Brown being the reserve. During the tour matches, which were usually played consecutively with only one or no days between fixtures, Bradman rotated the trio, so one would generally be rested while the other two opened.N- Notable exceptions occurred in the Test series and the opening match against Worcestershire and the clash against the MCC. In those matches, Australia fielded its first-choice team; Brown played out of position in the middle order, while Morris and Barnes opened. A very occasional left-arm unorthodox spin bowler, Morris delivered only 35 overs during the first-class matches, including eight in the Tests. He took two wickets, both outside the Test arena.|$|E
5|$|Hammond toured South Africa in {{the winter}} of 1930–31, in a weak M.C.C. side without some of the best English players. The {{tourists}} were short of opening batsmen, frequently forcing Hammond into the role. Although successful, he brought a more wary approach than usual to his unaccustomed position. In all first-class cricket, he scored 1,045 runs (average 61.47). In the five-Test series, which South Africa won 1–0, he scored 517 runs (average 64.62), passing fifty five times in nine innings. A very cautious approach batting at number three saw Hammond score 49 and 63 in the first Test. Opening the batting in the second Test, he scored two fifties to save the game; he also kept wicket for a time following an injury to the regular wicketkeeper. Hammond continued <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> third Test, playing more aggressively for 136 not out, before returning to number three and making 75 in the fourth Test. In the final Test, he opened both the batting and the bowling.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, the Doctor—a time {{travelling}} alien {{played by}} Matt Smith—and his companions Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) land in Wales in 2020, where a drilling operation headed by Nasreen Chaudhry (Meera Syal) is drilling {{deep into the}} earth and disrupting a civilisation of Silurians who dwell beneath the earth. The Silurians cause holes <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> earth, one of which consumes Amy. The Doctor and Rory capture one Silurian, Alaya (Neve McIntosh), and the Doctor instructs Rory and a local family to not harm Alaya, as it could spark a war. He then takes Nasreen in the TARDIS to the Silurian civilisation to rescue Amy and a local boy.|$|E

5|$|On 26 June 2015, on {{the anniversary}} of the debut of the first book, Rowling {{revealed}} via Twitter that the Harry Potter stage play would be called Harry Potter and The Cursed Child. The Production is expected <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> summer of 2016 at London's Palace Theatre, London. The first four months of tickets for the June–September performances were sold out within several hours upon release. On 10 February 2016, it was announced via the Pottermore website, that the script would be released in book form, the day after the play's world premiere, making this the 8th book in the series, with events set nineteen years after the closing chapter of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.|$|E
5|$|The teams {{then headed}} to Headingley for the Fourth Test. Australia made two changes. Neil Harvey {{replaced}} the injured Barnes, while Ron Saggers replaced Don Tallonwho had a finger injurybehind the stumps. The reserve opener Brown was not recalled <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> absence of Barnes; instead, Hassett would improvise and open with Morris, while the teenaged Harvey {{came into the}} middle-order. As Australia led 20 after three Tests, England needed to win the last two matches to square the series. The home team won the toss and elected to bat on a batsman-friendly pitch. Hassett dropped Len Huttonwho went on to score 81on 25. England’s first-wicket partnership was broken at 168 and was their first opening stand beyond 42 for the series. The hosts were eventually out for 496 on the second day. Hassett caught England wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans, who meekly prodded a ball from Sam Loxton straight to silly mid-on.|$|E

5|$|As Dennis {{approached}} the Florida Keys, several gale warnings were issued, {{with the first}} from Long Key to Dry Tortugas at 04:00UTC on August16. These gale warnings were posted progressively farther north along the East Coast of the United States, reaching {{as far north as}} Windmill Point in Virginia. Additionally, a hurricane watch was issued in South Florida from Fort Myers to Palm Beach, including the Florida Keys. Hundreds of people were evacuated from the campgrounds of Bahia Honda and John Pennekamp state parks. Shelters were also prepared <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Florida Keys if necessary. Typically, when a tropical cyclone approaches South Florida, the South Florida Water Management District drains Lake Okeechobee using the floodgates. However, due to a severe drought, water was instead directed into the lake from the connector canals. The storm resulted in a postponement of a second spraying to combat the spread of Mediterranean fruit flies in the Tampa Bay Area. About 40,000tourists fled Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, including about 500people from a campground, causing a loss of about $2million to tourism. Some United States Military vessels were sent out to sea, while about 70A-10 jets at the Myrtle Beach Air Force Base were flown to England Air Force Base near Alexandria, Louisiana.|$|E
5|$|Brown missed {{selection}} {{for the tour}} opener against Worcestershire—in which Australia traditionally fielded its first-choice XI—before making his debut in the second match against Leicestershire. He made a century against Cambridge University in his second tour match, making 105 in the middle order. Batting at number3 against Lancashire in the final tour match before the Tests, Brown scored 119. After compiling 351 runs at 43.88 in the opening tour matches, Brown was selected for the Test side. Playing in all five Tests, Brown made his debut at Trent Bridge, Nottingham and scored 22 in his first innings. After Australia lost three early wickets in the second innings, Brown scored 73 to help secure a winning lead. Brown then made a century while opening the batting against Northamptonshire, and an unbeaten 62 in the second innings, guiding Australia to an eight-wicket victory over the Gentlemen of England. He was promoted <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Second Test at Lord's with Woodfull, after Ponsford was unavailable due to illness. At the home of cricket, Brown made his maiden Test century, scoring 105 in the first innings. His innings was an unhurried one; he tended {{to wait for the}} ball to come onto the bat rather than attacking the leather. However, he was unable to prevent Australia from being forced to follow-on and made two the match ended in an innings defeat. He was retained as opener upon Ponsford's return for the Third Test, with Woodfull dropping down the order in a reshuffled batting line-up. Brown made 72 and a duck. The match ended in a draw after both teams passed 490 in the first innings.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the railway}} was finally {{completed}} in 1840, and in July the Preston and Wyre Railway opened. The following year St Peter's Church was finished, and Hesketh-Fleetwood appointed as vicar the Rev. St. Vincent Beechey of Hilgay in Norfolk. Also in 1841, the North Euston {{was the fourth}} hotel <b>to</b> <b>open</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> town. Steamer services opened to the Isle of Man, Whitehaven, Ardrossan and Belfast. Fleetwood initially flourished, but Hesketh-Fleetwood {{had run out of}} money and was compelled to take out mortgages. He lost the £75,000 he had invested in the Preston and Wyre Railway Company owing to a lack of accounts. Kemp claimed that Hesketh-Fleetwood owed him money, but Kemp refused to explain his book-keeping. In the face of enormous debts Hesketh-Fleetwood sold his estates at Blackpool, Southport, Meols Hall, and Tulketh Hall. Charles bought the Churchtown estate, where {{he and his wife had}} been living, from his brother. In 1844 Hesketh-Fleetwood auctioned off his personal possessions from Rossall Hall and left Lancashire. The Rev. St. Vincent Beechey had set up the Northern Church of England School for boys. Close to bankruptcy, Hesketh-Fleetwood leased the buildings at Rossall Hall to the school for six years, with the option to buy it after nine for £7,000. Thereafter, the school was called Rossall School.|$|E
