5|$|Philip's {{alliance}} with Carthage caused immediate dismay in Rome, hard-pressed as they already were. An additional twenty-five warships were at once outfitted {{and sent to}} join Flaccus' fleet of twenty-five warships already at Tarentum, with orders to guard the Italian Adriatic coast, and to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> Philip's intent and if necessary cross over to Macedonia, keeping Philip confined there.|$|E
5|$|To use Lorenz, a {{conventional}} radio was {{tuned to the}} transmission, and the operator would listen for the signal and <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> if they heard dots or dashes. If they heard dots, the short 0.2s pulse, they would know they were {{too far to the}} left, and turned to the right in order to reach the centreline. Dashes indicated they should turn left. In the centre the receiver could hear both signals, which merged to form a steady tone, the equisignal.|$|E
5|$|In early August, Lerch and U-12 set {{out from}} Pola for Venice to look for enemy ships to sink. On 6 August, the Italian {{destroyer}} Rosolino Pilo rammed U-12, probably by chance, at about 05:00 in the Lido inlet of the Venetian Lagoon. Two days later, when Italian workers were dredging to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the object Rosolino Pilo had hit, they heard a heavy explosion. When divers {{went down in the}} area, they discovered the wreck of U-12 with her stern blown off. U-12s entire complement of 17 men was lost when she went down. U-12 was the first Austro-Hungarian submarine sunk during the war.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} other {{experiments}} were to be performed inside the orbiter crew compartment. Among these was the Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System, being flown for the fourth time. This separated solutions of biological materials by passing electric fields through them; the experiment aimed at supporting research into diabetes treatments. A small animal cage was flown containing six rats; no animal experiment was carried out on the flight, but a student involvement project was planned for a later mission which would use the cage, and NASA wanted to ensure it was flight-tested. The student involvement project carried out on STS-8 involved William Thornton using biofeedback techniques, to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> if they worked in microgravity. A photography experiment would attempt to study the spectrum of a luminous atmospheric glow which had been reported around the orbiter, and determine how this interacted with firings of the reaction control system.|$|E
5|$|Four months later, {{the player}} learns {{that the council}} city-states {{are now trying to}} find Remnants all around the world to use to fight the Conqueror, who is in turn binding and {{transforming}} the Remnants of the city-states, even those that are already bound. Rush and Irina's parents, once found, reveal that their research at the academy had been to create tablets that can transform Remnants and it is through one of these that Wagram stole that the Conqueror is able to do so. When the party travels to the God-Emperor's city, Undelwalt, to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> why he is supporting the Conqueror, they find Wagram, who tells them that the Conqueror is a Remnant himself. Wagram and the God-Emperor are supporting him in his quest to destroy the people of the world, who are misusing Remnants and destroying the balance of the world.|$|E
5|$|In October 2006, the NSW Department of Local Government {{announced}} it would investigate the Council's financial management and would <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> whether it properly considered the impact the added costs could have on its other functions. The investigation, which commenced on 6 November 2006, was conducted under Section 430 of the , which allows the Director-General of the Department to investigate any aspect of a Council or of its work or activities. The report, delivered in May 2007 to the Minister of Local Government, concluded that the Council did not exercise due diligence and {{that there had been}} a failure to scope the project, and recommended to the Minister that a Section 740 public inquiry, which would be independent and have some of the powers and protections of a Royal Commission, be held. A Section 740 inquiry is a necessary step before a Council can be dismissed.|$|E

25|$|Protein {{ensemble}} {{files are}} {{a representation of}} a protein that can be considered to have a flexible structure.

40|$|Today {{there are}} many {{agricultural}} products in the market with different designations and certificates which are as a proof of product quality and adherence to health standards.

In this article we <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the consumers' general degree of trust in food safety and in the health safety of the fruit offered in Croatia. A comparison is made between the trust degrees for domestic and imported fruit. Consumers also expressed their opinion about the need for various certificates that guarantee the health safety of food products. In this respect, we also <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>determine</b> the various degrees of trust for different certificates.

It was later found, already filled in reporting uneventful patrols of the site up to 7 am in the morning when the guards would have gone off duty.
