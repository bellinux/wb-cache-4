Research has shown that tight glycaemic control of this disease significantly reduces the risks of developing several life threatening diabetic complications. The Ets-Insulin-Bolus Calculator (EIBC), inspired by the Ets concept (Equivalent <b>Teaspoon</b> <b>Sugar),</b> was primarily designed to assist type I diabetics in improving their blood glucose control. The EIBC has shown to improve the average blood glucose level of type 1 diabetics.

With the use of the latest technology in blood glucose monitoring, the CGMS from Medtronic, mathematical models expressing and rating blood glucose control have been proposed and derived in this study. A clinical trial with type 1 diabetics has also been conducted. The use of the models together with the clinical trial results have shown that the EIBC does in fact promote tighter glycaemic control for type 1 diabetics. Master...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Electronical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2008. The {{rapid growth}} of {{biotechnology}} has promoted industries to harness {{the market in the}} field of human energy systems. A growing literature of research has linked human energy systems to weight loss, major diseases or illnesses. In our modern society, the general public is exposed to everyday stress, which often results in the development of chronic stress. Therefore, stress becomes an important area of medicine. It has been postulated that suppressing these physiological responses may help in disease prevention. Consequently, there is an urge for defining a model integrating stress with the human energy model. Over the past decades, a large amount of research has been put forward in defining the physiological responses or changes when an individual experiences psychological or environmental changes such as interpersonal dysfunction, traumatic experiences and diseases. Interestingly, it reveals that blood glucose fluctuation tends to be the end product of most psychological or physiological stressors. The blood glucose system {{is one of the major}} subsystems of the complete metabolic fuel system in humans. In this study, an empirical model and procedure for the derivation of the model due to various psychological influences on the human energy system are presented. This study can be divided into two main sections. An overview of a previously developed unit (ets: equivalent <b>teaspoon</b> <b>sugar)</b> for blood glucose quantification is given in the first section. Stress quantification methods are derived in the second section and a link between these methods and ets is drawn. A verification study of the derived model is also presented in the second section. Stress can be divided into physiological stress and psychological stress. Between the two types of stress, a generalised model based on studies of physiological stress has been drawn and accepted by the public. However, the generalised model does not account for psychological stress. Evidence shows that depending on the specific nature of a stressful circumstance, it can cause different activations of central circuits leading to the release of different neurotransmitters. However, these neurotransmitters have a common effect of increasing blood glucose concentrations. A substantial amount of literature shows that, when stress involves mental effort, epinephrine (EPI) is the main endocrine response. However, stress that does not require mental effort mainly induces cortisol release. The response models for different types of stress were derived using these relations. Furthermore, it is known that prolonged stress may lead to the development of disease. Several studies have used this observation and associated chronic stress with the relative risk factor of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Previously, different quartiles of risk factors for CVD have been related to blood glucose energy and ets expenditure. This link was further utilised to quantify chronic stress in this study. Increases in either of the two endocrine concentrations have been shown to raise the blood glucose level. In order to demonstrate the benefits of applying the ets concept, the cortisol and epinephrine responses were further quantified using the new glucose quantification method, the equivalent <b>teaspoon</b> <b>sugar</b> (ets) concept. The models derived in this study were verified against measured data. The models reveal a strong agreement with the measured data and therefore support the feasibility of these quantification methods. In conclusion, a link does exist between blood glucose energy and stress, and the highly accurate models derived for this association may serve as an adjunct tool for glycaemic control and stress management.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Electronical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007 People often neglect {{their diets}} {{because of the}} effort {{required}} {{to ensure that they}} are maintaining a healthy diet. Most people do not know exactly what types of food and the amount they should eat without some guidance. The ideal would be to provide them with an assistant who could supply the required information quickly and reliably when needed. Diabetes and obesity are serious illnesses that are on the increase worldwide. Both these illnesses are related to food consumption and are referred to as energy related illnesses. Human beings derive energy from the food that they consume and thus it is of the utmost importance that they follow a healthy diet. The latter should ensure that the correct amount of energy is obtained and used on a daily basis. At Human-Sim (Pty) Ltd a new method for quantifying the energy available from food has been developed known as the Equivalent <b>Teaspoon</b> <b>Sugar</b> (ets). By using ets a healthy diet can be established for both healthy individuals and those suffering from diabetes or obesity. This study investigates the feasibility of providing an individual with a digital assistant to help with maintaining a healthy diet. The assistant is implemented on a cellular phone platform to ensure the least inconvenience to the user. The study also investigates the efficiency of the ets concept for dietary energy control. The results obtained during this study showed that the dietary assistant was successful. The user acceptance was high and the efficiency of use impressive. Users found it easy and intuitive to relate to the new ets quantification method. Master...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Electrical and Electronic Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012 This study {{examined}} the energy dependence of cancer cells. Glucose {{was found to be}} their main energy source. It seems possible to use this dependence to advantage in the fight against cancer. A novel experiment to reduce the blood glucose supply and utilisation was proposed. It entailed caloric restriction, suppression of glucose secretion by the liver as well as suppression of stress hormones (which elevates glucose levels). This minimises the blood glucose value. As a last step, anti-insulin is provided to inhibit cancer cells to utilise the glucose. The cancer cells are thus deprived of their main energy source. This should lead to a reduction or elimination of tumours and will aid in preventing their development. Although feasible, this method turned out to be too expensive to perform the necessary clinical trials to prove the hypothesis. Next, the focus shifted to cancer prevention. The human energy system was analysed with the goal to reduce the circulating glucose level. The main focus here was metabolised CHO energy consumption. A previously proposed unit – the Equivalent <b>Teaspoon</b> <b>Sugar,</b> or ets, was used to quantify energy with. It was shown that cancer risk increases significantly when the recommended ets consumption per day is exceeded. Furthermore, it was shown that including fibre in a meal reduces the ets value of the meal. One gram of fibre leads to a reduction of around 0. 6 ets. The link between exercise, stress, fibre, their resulting blood glucose levels and cancer were quantified in terms of ets. Exercise expends ets, while stress causes the liver to secrete more ets. Experimental data was analysed to confirm the relationships. In conclusion an equation was formulated to describe the combined effect of all these elements on the energy system. One’s total daily ets consumption can be obtained from the equation, and it was linked to one’s cancer risk. Adapting a lifestyle that ensures the correct daily ets intake will lead to a significant reduction in cancer risk. This study proved that cancer cells are very dependent on sugar and a restriction of this energy source forces them into regression. Using this knowledge to advantage may help in the combat one of the biggest killers of our time – cancer. Doctora...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Mechanical Engineering) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. Cardiovascular Disease (CVD) is {{the most}} {{widespread}} modern disease in the Western world. There is {{a substantial amount of}} evidence suggesting that blood glucose energy plays a role in the formation and progression of the disease. The staff at Human-Sim (Pty) Ltd have developed a concept that they believe can be used to help decrease the risk of CVD. This concept can be used to quantify blood glucose energy extracted from any foodstuff. This method of quantification of blood glucose energy has been called the Equivalent <b>Teaspoon</b> <b>Sugar</b> (ets) concept. To link the ets concept with CVD, two studies were done. In the first study risk factors obtained from cohort studies linking the HbA-ic percentage with CVD risk were used. The HbA-ic percentage is a representation of the mean blood glucose level over a certain period of time. Through simulating the effect of ets intake on blood glucose levels using the simulation model Diabetic Toolbox, it was found that an increase in ets intake results in an increase in mean blood glucose levels in diabetic patients. This increase was linked with an increase in the HbA-ic percentage and hence the link with CVD risk was made. However, the increase in mean blood glucose due to ets intake is not sufficiently significant to create an accurate link between ets intake and CVD. The second study used risk factors obtained from cohort studies linking giycaemic load intake with CVD risk. This proved to be much more effective than the first study. Since giycaemic load can be expressed through ets, a link between ets intake and CVD was made. Stress is also a well-known factor that is associated with the increase of CVD. With empirical measurements and simulations, {{it was found that the}} effect stress has on blood sugar levels can be approximated with an effect similar to that of ingested carbohydrates. The effect stress has on blood glucose energy could be linked to an increased risk of CVD. The results correlated very well with cohort studies done where stress was viewed as a risk factor of CVD. This research can lead to a new way of quantifying stress. The effect exercise has on CVD was also investigated. A decrease in CVD risk is associated with the amount of energy expended during exercise in KCal. During exercise, blood glucose energy is used. The amount of blood glucose energy used can be expressed as ets-expended during exercise, which in turn was linked to a decrease in the risk of CVD. In conclusion, a correlation does exist between blood glucose energy and CVD. The ets concept quantifies blood glucose energy and can thus be used to control blood glucose energy. Research shows that the risk of CVD can be reduced if a person controls his energy intake, manages his stress and exercises regularly. All of these above factors can be quantified with the ets concept which is an easy to understand unit of blood glucose energy. The ets concept can be used as a tool to help a person keep his blood glucose energy levels at a healthy level considering carbohydrate intake, stress and exercise and thus reduce the risk of CVD.

5000|$|The {{management}} of dehydration typically {{involves the use}} of oral rehydration solution (ORS). Standard home solutions such as salted rice water, salted yogurt drinks, vegetable and chicken soups with salt can be given. Home solutions such as water in which cereal has been cooked, unsalted soup, green coconut water, weak tea (unsweetened), and unsweetened fresh fruit juices can have from half a teaspoon to full teaspoon of salt (from one-and-a-half to three grams) added per liter. Clean plain water can also be one of several fluids given. There are commercial solutions such as Pedialyte, and relief agencies such as UNICEF widely distribute packets of salts and sugar. The World Health Organization (WHO) describes a homemade ORS with one liter water with one teaspoon salt (or 3 grams) and six <b>teaspoons</b> <b>sugar</b> (or 18 grams) added [...] (approximately the “taste of tears”). The WHO; however, does not generally recommend homemade solutions as how to make them is easily forgotten.
