500|$|Tuning screws are screws {{inserted}} into resonant cavities {{which can be}} adjusted externally to the waveguide. [...] They provide fine tuning of the resonant frequency by inserting more, or less thread into the waveguide. [...] Examples {{can be seen in}} the post filter of figure 1: each cavity has a tuning screw secured with jam nuts and <b>thread-locking</b> compound. [...] For screws inserted only a small distance, the equivalent circuit is a shunt capacitor, increasing in value as the screw is inserted. [...] However, when the screw has been inserted a distance λ/4 it resonates equivalent to a series LC circuit. [...] Inserting it further causes the impedance to change from capacitive to inductive, that is, the arithmetic sign changes.|$|E
5000|$|Typically, <b>thread-locking</b> fluids are methacrylate-based, {{and cure}} [...] <b>Thread-locking</b> fluid is a {{thixotropic}} fluid: under shear stress, it exhibits a time-dependent decrease in viscosity. This {{allows it to}} flow well over time, yet still resist short-duration shearing, as in vibration or shock.|$|E
50|$|Lock washers, locknuts, jam nuts, and <b>thread-locking</b> fluid {{are ways}} to prevent {{vibration}} from loosening a bolted joint.|$|E
50|$|Most <b>thread-locking</b> {{formulas}} are methacrylate-based {{and rely}} on the electrochemical activity of a metal substrate to cause polymerization of the fluid. <b>Thread-locking</b> fluid is thixotropic, which allows it to flow well over time, yet still resist shocks and vibrations. It can be permanent or removable; in the latter case, it can be removed with heat, for example. Typically, brands are color-coded to indicate strength and whether they can be removed.|$|E
50|$|Lock washers, locknuts, jam nuts, {{and safety}} wire {{may be used}} in {{conjunction}} with <b>thread-locking</b> fluid to prevent loosening of bolted joints.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thread-locking</b> fluid or {{threadlocker}} is a thin, single-component adhesive, {{applied to}} the threads of fasteners such as screws and bolts to prevent loosening, leakage, and corrosion.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thread-locking</b> fluid was {{developed}} by American professor Vernon K. Krieble in 1953. His company, American Sealants, founded the Loctite brand. An early version of the compound was patented in 1960.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thread-locking</b> fluid is {{typically}} sold in small containers, in amounts from 5 millilitres (about one teaspoon) to 250 mL. Threadlocker is also sold in sticks and in tape form, similar to Teflon tape.|$|E
50|$|In {{applications}} where vibration or rotation {{may work}} a nut loose, various locking mechanisms may be employed: lock washers, jam nuts, specialist adhesive <b>thread-locking</b> fluid such as Loctite, safety pins (split pins) or lockwire {{in conjunction with}} castellated nuts, nylon inserts (nyloc nut), or slightly oval-shaped threads.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "jam nut" [...] {{can also}} refer to any nut {{that is used}} in the same {{function}} (even a standard nut used for the jamming purpose). Jam nuts, other types of locknuts, lock washers, and <b>thread-locking</b> fluid are ways to prevent vibration from loosening a bolted joint.|$|E
50|$|Screw-in studs simply screw {{into the}} {{existing}} threaded bolt {{hole in the}} hub. The end that screws into the hub is usually either threaded with a higher tolerance fit or installed with a chemical <b>thread-locking</b> fluid {{to keep it from}} backing out from the hub when the lug nut is removed.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} other systems of {{fastener}} retention {{that do not}} rely on safety wire at all, such as lock washers, locknuts, jam nuts, <b>thread-locking</b> fluid, castellated nuts and cotter pins, all of which accomplish the same objective as safety wire, which is to prevent vibration or other forces from causing the undesired loosening of a mechanical fastener.|$|E
50|$|Acknowledging the MOE slot systems shortcomings, Magpul drafted M-LOK {{as a new}} and {{improved}} mounting standard which was released in 2014 replacing the existing MOE slot. The M-LOK rail specification included metric dimensions instead of imperial, and utilizes a T-slot nut with a <b>thread-locking</b> fluid making it suited for applications such as free floated handguards. It was designed to work with both metal and polymer parts.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Thread-locking</b> fluid may {{be applied}} {{before or after}} assembly, {{depending}} on the type. Threadlockers are available in [...] "permanent" [...] and [...] "removable" [...] formulas, with heavy-duty permanent threadlockers rated to withstand as much as [...] in shear. Some threadlockers are removable with the application of heat. Many brands use color-coded labeling to indicate each type's strength and whether it is permanent or removable.|$|E
50|$|In 1986, Chemence Ltd. {{acquired}} {{the assets of}} Alembic Chemicals, a cyanoacrylate manufacturer in Dublin, Ireland. In 1988, the facility was moved to Corby (England), expanding product development and manufacturing to encompass anaerobic thread lockers (<b>thread-locking</b> fluid), retaining compounds, gasket makers and pipe sealants, UV curing products, and cyanoacrylate adhesives for consumer and industrial markets. Chemence Ltd. also manufactured a range of private label consumer adhesives for companies including Bostik, ASDA, TESCO, and B&Q.|$|E
50|$|Another example {{where they}} aid locking {{is a joint}} that {{experiences}} {{a large amount of}} thermal expansion and contraction. They will supply the required pre-load, but the bolt may have an additional locking mechanism (like <b>Thread-locking</b> fluid) that would fail without the Belleville. Belleville washers should never overhang the joint they are trying to secure, as all of their clamping force is on the outside perimeter edge of the washer. If a belleville washer overhangs a joint, its clamping effectiveness is exponentially reduced, and it is a poor application that will eventually fail under thermal expansion and contraction.|$|E
