40|$|When a {{viscoelastic}} fluid blob {{is stretched}} {{out into a}} thin horizontal filament, it sags and falls gradually under its own weight, forming a catenary-like structure that evolves dynamically. If the ends are brought together rapidly after stretching, the falling filament tends <b>to</b> <b>straighten</b> <b>by</b> rising. These two effects are strongly influenced by the elasticity of the fluid and yield qualitatively different behaviours from {{the case of a}} purely viscous filament analysed previously (Teichman & Mahadevan, J. Fluid Mech. vol. 478, 2003, p. 71). Starting from the bulk equations for the motion of a viscoelastic fluid, we derive a simplified equation for the dynamics of a viscoelastic filament and analyse this equation in some simple settings to explain our observations...|$|R

50|$|During the Depression and WWII years, {{not only}} were jobs hard to find, but so were materials. The {{government}} imposed a cost ceiling of $10,000 on all new buildings. This also applied to service stations, which made {{it very difficult to}} construct a building big enough to repair trucks and tractors or car dealerships. In order to construct a new building, another would have to be taken down, just to obtain nails, which then had <b>to</b> be <b>straightened</b> <b>by</b> hand.|$|R

50|$|Beresford {{employed}} Lewis Nockalls Cottingham, one of {{the most}} skilled architects at that time to restore Armagh's St Patrick's Cathedral. Cottingham removed the old stunted spire and shored up the belfry stages while he re-built the piers and arches under it. The arcade walls which had fallen away as much as 21 inches from the perpendicular on the south side and 7 inches on the North side, were <b>straightened</b> <b>by</b> means of <b>heated</b> irons, and the clerestory windows which had long been concealed, were opened out, and filled with tracery.|$|R

His limp {{handshake}} and lack of military experience (and his stooping donnish manner {{at a time when many}} politicians were former officers) were political handicaps in later life.|$|R

50|$|The Holsons thought big, {{everything}} {{was brought in}} from Chicago, a few items remain to this day, such as the kitchen cabinets and the old gas crystal chandelier in the dining room.

The undertaking was massive in addition to running a large modern cattle and hog operation big things were happening to Clover Forest. It is likely {{that most of the}} outbuildings and former slave quarters were removed at this time. Where the outhouse had once stood a three car carriage house came into being. To balance out the house the east side porch and root cellar were removed and the library wing was added to the house. Through some creative plumbing (which would have <b>to</b> be <b>straightened</b> <b>by</b> later owners) the bedrooms were equipped with bathrooms.|$|R
5000|$|When the Lincoln Highway became U.S. Highway 30 in 1926, {{the route}} was 358 mi long and passed through every town along the way.

In Cedar Rapids, it began its move to the south, avoiding the downtown area, and in Clinton, it was rerouted over the Gateway Bridge, allowing Iowa 136 to cross the Lyons-Fulton Bridge.

Despite finishing in second place, behind London Capital, they managed <b>to</b> <b>straighten</b> the record <b>by</b> beating them in the Playoff final at the National Indoor Arena, winning 95-87.

Later, to their horror, Jerry and Elaine discover the Visa renewal form Babu was supposed to fill out in Jerry's belated mail; it had been delivered to Jerry's address by mistake. They go to the jail where Babu is being held and he is delighted to see them until they tell him what happened. At that point he becomes angry at them and calls Jerry [...] "A very, very bad man!"
