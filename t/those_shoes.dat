500|$|Gough and Millar {{had always}} wanted Marsters {{for the role of}} Milton Fine/Brainiac. The pair wrote a draft for the major story arc of season five, knowing they wanted a new villain on the show to fight Clark. With the arrival of the black ship at the end of season four, Gough and Millar decided to {{introduce}} Brainiac. To them, Marsters was the only actor they could envision that could fit the [...] "menace, intelligence, and sexiness" [...] Brainiac was going to embody. Had Marsters declined the role, Gough and Millar would have rethought introducing Brainiac, as they could not think of any other actor who could fill <b>those</b> <b>shoes.</b> Marsters felt excited playing a character that was completely intentional; he likened the intention to that of a shark. As Marsters explains, [...] " [...] was just composed of his intent. And that's exciting—it's like watching a shark. You don't really ask how a shark is feeling—it's pure." ...|$|E
500|$|Downes {{said that}} his voicing for Master Chief was based entirely on Bungie's written {{character}} description provided, which specified a character similar to Clint Eastwood and of few words. In a podcast interview, the actor noted that, during the recording, {{he was given a}} fair amount of creative leeway to develop the Chief's personality. In the games, Master Chief never speaks during player-controlled gameplay, making him an almost silent protagonist. Even during cut scenes, the character generally speaks sparingly. Bungie Studios' Frank O'Connor has described the Chief as [...] "so quiet and so invisible, literally, that the player gets to pretend they're the Chief. The player gets to inhabit <b>those</b> <b>shoes</b> [...] apply their own personality." [...] Bungie concept artist Eddie Smith described Master Chief as [...] "pretty much the consummate professional. He does his job, walks off, doesn't even get the girl, he's that cool he doesn't need her." [...] Although the Master Chief is usually depicted as calm, quiet, and wryly cynical, some reviewers stated that Eric Nylund's portrayal of the character in Halo: The Fall of Reach deviates significantly from the treatment found in the games and other media. Alternatively, William C. Dietz's portrayal of the Chief in [...] was occasionally blasted by fans as too radical a departure from Nylund's template.|$|E

However, other than <b>those</b> <b>shoe</b> shiners, the remaining hawkers still {{are not allowed to}} renew their licenses. Therefore, there are always conflicts between unlicensed bootblack hawkers about where to locate their hawker stalls.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effect of different outsole hardness of turf cleats shoes on the lower limb kinematics and kinetics of soccer players playing on artificial turf. The participants were required to complete tasks of straight running and 45 ° left sidestep cutting movements, respectively, at the speed of 4. 5 ± 0. 2 m/s on artificial turf. They were asked to randomly select turf cleats shoes with a soft outsole (SO), medium hardness outsole (MO) and hard outsole (HO). During the stance phase of straight running, peak pressure and force-time integral in medial forefoot (MFF) of players wearing cleats shoes with MO were significantly higher than <b>those</b> wearing cleats <b>shoes</b> with SO. During the stance phase of a 45 ° cutting maneuver, players wearing cleats shoes with SO showed significantly higher peak knee flexion and abduction angles than the HO group. Players wearing cleats shoes with SO also showed higher ankle dorsiflexion and inversion angles compared with <b>those</b> wearing cleats <b>shoes</b> with HO. The vertical average loading rate (VALR) as well as peak pressure and force-time integral in the heel (H) and lateral forefoot (LFF) regions of players wearing cleats shoes with HO were significantly higher than <b>those</b> wearing <b>shoes</b> with SO. On the contrary, peak pressure and force-time integral of players wearing shoes with SO were significantly higher than <b>those</b> wearing <b>shoes</b> with HO in MFF. A higher vertical loading rate and plantar pressure of some areas may increase the potential risk of metatarsal stress fractures and plantar fasciitis. Therefore, this finding about turf cleats shoes could give some theoretic support for the design of turf cleats shoes and material optimization in the future...|$|R

60|$|Before Dickory {{had reached}} his mother's cottage Mistress Kate Bonnet came running to meet him, {{and she did}} not seem to be the same girl he had left that morning. Her clothes had been dried and smoothed; even her hat, which had been found in the boat, had been made shapely and wearable, and its ribbons floated in the breeze. Dickory glanced at her feet, and as he did so, a thrill of strange delight ran through him. He saw his own Sunday shoes, with silver buckles, and he caught a glimpse of a pair of brown stockings, which he knew went always with <b>those</b> <b>shoes.</b>|$|E
60|$|One insect there was, however, before {{which even}} Eliza herself, {{hardened}} wretch as she seemed, used to cower and shiver; {{and that was}} the great black bumble-bee, the largest and most powerful of the British bee-kind. When one of these dangerous monsters, a burly, buzzing bourgeois, got entangled in her web, Eliza, shaking in her shoes (I allow her <b>those</b> <b>shoes</b> by poetical licence) would retire in high dudgeon to her inmost bower, and there would sit and sulk, in visible bad temper, till the clumsy big thing, after many futile efforts, had torn its way by main force out of the coils that surrounded it. Then, the moment the telegraphic communication told her the lines in the web were once more free, Eliza would sally forth again with a smiling face--oh yes, I assure you, we could tell by her look when she was smiling--and would repair afresh with cheerful alacrity the damage done to her snare by the unwelcome visitor. Hummingbird hawk-moths, on the other hand, though so big and quick, she would kill immediately. As for Lucy, craven soul, she had so little sense of proper pride and arachnid honour, that she shrank even from the wasps which Eliza so bravely and unhesitatingly tackled; and more than once we caught her in the very act of cutting them out entire, with the whole piece of web in which they were immeshed, and letting them drop on to the ground beneath, merely as a short way of getting rid of them from her premises. I always rather despised Lucy. She hadn't even the one redeeming virtue of most carnivorous or predatory races--an insensate and almost automatic courage.|$|E
