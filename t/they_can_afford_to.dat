In many countries, textiles {{are one of the}} first manufacturing industries to develop, but the African textile industry has been crippled by competition The negative consequences are not easily resolved: African consumers give praise to Chinese textiles, and they are often the first clothes <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> buy new; yet local manufactures are badly wounded, raising opposition and concern over the loss of local jobs.|$|E
25|$|The Metropolitan Opera in the US {{reports that}} {{the average age of}} its {{audience}} is now 60. Many opera companies have experienced a similar trend, and opera company websites are replete with attempts to attract a younger audience. This trend is part of the larger trend of greying audiences for classical music since the last decades of the 20th century. In an effort to attract younger audiences, the Metropolitan Opera offers a student discount on ticket purchases. Major opera companies have been better able to weather the funding cutbacks, because <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> hire star singers which draw substantial audiences.|$|E

50|$|All {{the above}} is {{independent}} of the prices of {{the goods and services}} and of the budget constraints faced by consumers. These determine the feasible bundles (which <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford).</b> According <b>to</b> the standard theory, consumers chooses a bundle within their budget such that no other feasible bundle is preferred over it; therefore their utility is maximized.|$|R
500|$|At home, Will {{is being}} pushed by his wife, Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig), {{to find a}} second job so that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> move into a new house before {{the birth of their}} child. He begins working at the school as a janitor after hours, and shares a romantic moment with {{guidance}} counselor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays). Football coach Ken Tanaka (Patrick Gallagher) observes them, and warns Emma not to become Will's rebound girl. When Will asks her to meet with him after school again, Emma turns him down, having accepted a date with Ken. Terri discovers that she is actually experiencing a hysterical pregnancy, but she cannot bring herself to tell Will, so she lies to him that they are having a son. She tells him to quit working as a janitor, offering up use of her craft room as a nursery for the baby so they do not need to move.|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the controversy, {{the reports}} on the Bogdanov theses {{and most of the}} journal referees' reports spoke favorably of their work, {{describing}} it as original and containing interesting ideas. This has been the basis of concerns raised about the efficacy of the peer-review system that the scientific community and academia use to determine the merit of submitted manuscripts for publication; one concern is that over-worked and unpaid referees {{may not be able to}} thoroughly judge the value of a paper in the little time <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> spend on it.

Miriam, however, insists on trying to sweeten Alice up by offering her some wine in a summer house built over an old well. Annabel has a seizure {{at the sight of}} it – after her marriage to her violent husband collapsed, and her business with it, she drank herself to a heart attack. As they wait, they remember their times in the garden: Annabel in the tennis court, pelted with balls by her father, and Miriam's brief relationship with a man called [...] "Lewis", ended by her disapproving father.|$|E

2500|$|Since the {{majority}} (85%) of Americans have health insurance, {{they do not}} directly pay for medical services. Insurance companies, as payors, negotiate health care pricing with providers {{on behalf of the}} insured. Hospitals, doctors, and other medical providers have traditionally disclosed their fee schedules only to insurance companies and other institutional payors, and not to individual patients. Uninsured individuals are expected to pay directly for services, but since they lack access to pricing information, price-based competition may be reduced. The introduction of high-deductible insurance has increased demand for pricing information among consumers. [...] As high-deductible health plans rise across the country, with many individuals having deductibles of $2500 or more, their ability to pay for costly procedures diminishes, and hospitals end up covering the cost of patients care. [...] Many health systems are putting in place price transparency initiatives and payments plans for their patients so that the patients better understand what the estimated cost of their care is, and how <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> pay for their care over time.|$|E

Anything proved would go tremendously hard for her." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{success of}} the {{implementation}} of the policy is also controversial because it is questioned whether the policy is actually going to those who need the benefits. For instance, since the leave offered is unpaid, majorities of eligible employees can not take time off because <b>they</b> <b>can</b> not <b>afford</b> <b>to</b> do so. And according to Pyle and Pelletier, eligible workers may not even know about this policy and the benefits allotted to them.|$|R
