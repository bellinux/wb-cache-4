50|$|Precise {{control of}} time and {{temperature}} during the <b>tempering</b> <b>process</b> is crucial to achieve the desired balance of physical properties. Low tempering temperatures may only relieve the internal stresses, decreasing brittleness while maintaining {{a majority of the}} hardness. Higher tempering temperatures tend to produce a greater reduction in the hardness, sacrificing some yield strength and tensile strength for an increase in elasticity and plasticity. However, in some low alloy steels, containing other elements like chromium and molybdenum, tempering at low temperatures may produce an increase in hardness, while at higher temperatures the hardness will decrease. Many steels with high concentrations of these alloying elements behave like precipitation hardening alloys, which produces the opposite effects under the conditions found in quenching and tempering, and are referred to as maraging steels.|$|E

Ductile iron produced by CO 2 sand casting method was heat treated by new heat treatment cycle that comprised combination of modified annealing, austenitizing and <b>tempering</b> <b>processes.</b> The new heat treatment process performed was divided into three stages: first stage consists of modified annealing (as-annealed condition); second stage consists of modified annealing and austenitizing processes (as-austenitized condition); and third stage consists of modified annealing, austenitizing and <b>tempering</b> <b>processes</b> (as-tempered condition). A series of microstructure analysis tests, including optical microscopy, X-ray diffractometry, and scanning electron microscopy equipped with energy dispersive X-ray, was applied. Mechanical tests including tensile (ASTM E 8 M), impact toughness (ASTM-E 23 - 1990) and Vickers hardness test were performed. The results suggest that heat treatment temperature influences the matrix and volume fraction of each phase of ductile iron. Annealing included in new heat treatment process does influence the hardness of ductile iron. Moreover, microstructure constituents have good correlation with mechanical properties. It is proven that, hardness could be estimated using mixture law of hardness for each microstructure constituent.
