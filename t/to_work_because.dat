5|$|New Keynesians offered {{explanations}} {{for the failure of}} the labor market to clear. In a Walrasian market, unemployed workers bid down wages until the demand for workers meets the supply. If markets are Walrasian, the ranks of the unemployed would be limited to workers transitioning between jobs and workers who choose not <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>because</b> wages are too low to attract them. They developed several theories explaining why markets might leave willing workers unemployed. Of these theories, new Keynesians were especially associated with efficiency wages and the insider-outsider model used to explain long-term effects of previous unemployment, where short-term increases in unemployment become permanent and lead to higher levels of unemployment in the long-run.|$|E
5|$|Young Como started {{helping his}} family at age 10, working {{before and after}} school in Steve Fragapane's barber shop for 50¢ a week. By age 13, he had {{graduated}} to having his own chair in the Fragapane barber shop, although he stood on a box to tend to his customers. It was also around this time that young Como lost his week's wages in a dice game. Filled with shame, he locked himself in his room and did not come out until hunger {{got the better of}} him. He managed to tell his father {{what had happened to the}} money his family depended on. His father told him he was entitled to make a mistake and that he hoped his son would never do anything worse than this. When Perry was 14, his father became unable <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>because</b> of a severe heart condition. Como and his brothers became the support of the household.|$|E

25|$|Disability {{insurance}} policies provide financial {{support in the}} event of the policyholder becoming unable <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>because</b> of disabling illness or injury. It provides monthly support to help pay such obligations as mortgage loans and credit cards. Short-term and long-term disability policies are available to individuals, but considering the expense, long-term policies are generally obtained only by those with at least six-figure incomes, such as doctors, lawyers, etc. Short-term disability insurance covers a person for a period typically up to six months, paying a stipend each month to cover medical bills and other necessities.|$|E
25|$|In {{semantic}} priming, {{the prime}} {{and the target}} are from the same semantic category and share features. For example, the word dog is a semantic prime for wolf, because the two are similar animals. Semantic priming is theorized <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>because</b> of spreading activation within associative networks. When a person thinks of one item in a category, similar items are stimulated by the brain. Even {{if they are not}} words, morphemes can prime for complete words that include them. An example of this would be that the morpheme 'psych' can prime for the word 'psychology'.|$|E
25|$|The sea wasp, a box {{jellyfish}} found in Australian waters, and more recently, Florida, can kill an adult human {{within a few}} minutes. A thin skin covering such as pantyhose {{was found to be}} sufficient protection. The pantyhose were formerly thought <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>because</b> of the length of the nematocysts, but it is now known {{to be related to the}} way the stinger cells work. The stinging cells on a {{box jellyfish}}'s tentacles are not triggered by pressure. Instead, they are triggered by the chemicals found on skin. Pantyhose hinders the detection of the chemicals preventing the nematocysts from firing.|$|E

25|$|In 1948, Robeson was preeminent in Henry A.

In the ensuing year, Robeson was forced to go overseas <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>because</b> his concert performances were canceled at the FBI's behest. While on tour, he spoke at the World Peace Council, at which his speech was publicly reported as equating America with a Fascist state—a depiction that he flatly denied. Nevertheless, the speech publicly attributed to him was a catalyst for his becoming an enemy of mainstream America. Robeson refused to bow to public criticism when he advocated in favor of twelve defendants, including his long-time friend, Benjamin J. Davis Jr., charged during the Smith Act trials of Communist Party leaders.|$|E

The upper terminus consisted of a walled basin, , reached by another aqueduct over the Gwendraeth Fawr. In October 1835 Green {{announced that he was}} unable to complete the inclined planes because of cost overruns. The company raised more capital to finish the work by calling on shareholders, and on 30 January 1836 dismissed Green as engineer. The Grand Western Canal Company had taken a similar action three days earlier, when the Wellisford inclined plane had failed <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>because</b> of a design fault in the sizing of the descending bucket.

Birkett went further than the proposed change and suggested that pensions should be provided to unmarried mothers, deserted wives and divorced wives. His speech was well-received; the Nottingham Journal described it as making [...] "a most excellent impression" [...] on the House of Commons, and Charles Masterman called him [...] "a possible future Lord Chancellor". Because of his focus on {{his career as a}} barrister rather than as a politician, Birkett rarely appeared in the House of Commons, but he worked hard when he did attend. On one occasion, he spent all night in a Parliamentary session that ended at 6 a.m. and then attended a court session the next day.|$|E

It's an over the top, overly cheerful musical – but also a biting comedy that always winks at the audience and acknowledges how cheesy musical theater can be, even while also proving how fun it is." [...] The Daily News David Hinckley shared Goldman's concerns about resetting the characters, and while he believed that doing so was the right long-term move, he commented that: [...] "the immediate effect {{is to make the}} episode feel a little jerky." [...] Hinckley felt that the episode's greatest problems were its pace and execution, observing: [...] "Too many twists and turns feel a little too sudden, leaving us not quite sure how we got from here to there." ...|$|E

It's a character who's been here for a while." [...] The relationship proved popular with viewers; during an interview with Digital Spy, Cooper spoke of her original lack of optimism towards the pairing, stating: [...] "When the relationship first started, we didn't know how they were going to gel and how it was going <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> <b>because</b> people were such fans of Jacqui and Tony. Some people still ask me if those two are going to get back together, but people are really taken with Rhys and Jacqui." [...] Cooper believes it's her own working relationship with Moss that helps make the pairing a success stating: [...] "It's a nice collaboration and we try to make it funny, emotional, hard-hitting, three-dimensional and as interesting for the audience as possible."

500|$|The video {{opens with}} two men {{watching}} a rush in the screening rooms of a Hollywood studio. On the screen, an actress played by Madonna sings and dances to [...] "Material Girl", dressed like Monroe from [...] "Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend". One of the men, played by Carradine, is a director or a producer and is immensely rich. He {{falls in love with}} the actress and wants to express his passion for her. He tells his employee, played by Wuhl: [...] "She's [...] fantastic. She could become a star." [...] The employee answered: [...] "She could be. She could be great. She could be a major star." [...] The former then concludes by saying: [...] "She is a star, George." [...] Madonna is in a pink strapless gown and has her hair in blond locks ala Monroe. The background is a reconstruction of the Monroe video, complete with staircase, chandeliers and a number of tuxedo clad chorus boys. Madonna dances and sings the song, while she is showered with cash, expensive jewellery, furs and is carried by the men over the stairs. At one time, she alludes herself from the men, by dismissing them with her fan. As the producer tries to impress Madonna, he comes to know that she does not like material things, but rather prefers simple romance. He pretends to be penniless, and brings her hand-cut flowers while paying a poor man a large amount to borrow (or possibly buy) his dirty truck to take her on a date. His plan seems <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> <b>because</b> the final scene shows him and Madonna kissing in the truck in an intimate position.|$|E
