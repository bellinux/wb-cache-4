5|$|Djedkare {{seems to}} have been held in high esteem during the Sixth Dynasty. For example, Merenre Nemtyemsaf I chose to place his pyramid complex close to that of Djedkare. In addition, the South Saqqara Stone, a royal annal dating to the reign of Merenre or of his {{successor}} Pepi II, records rich offerings being made to Djedkare on behalf of the king. An estimated 92% of the text inscribed on the stone was lost when it was roughly polished <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reused</b> as a sarcophagus lid, possibly in the late First Intermediate (c. 2160–2055 BC) to early Middle Kingdom period (c. 2055–1650 BC).|$|E
5|$|In 1885, Friedrich Carl had torpedo nets installed; these {{remained}} on the ship until 1897. In 1895, the ship was disarmed; she was placed into service as a torpedo test ship on 11 August of that year. She served in this capacity until 21 January 1902, when she was renamed Neptun and used as a harbor ship. Her name was then freed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reused</b> on the new armored cruiser , which was launched on 22 June 1902. Neptun was formally stricken from the naval register on 22 June 1905 and sold to a Dutch ship-breaking firm in March 1906 for 284,000gold marks. The ship was then towed to the Netherlands and broken up for scrap.|$|E

5|$|Josceline Percy, {{the last}} Percy earl, died in 1670. Two years later his widow allowed the keep's {{materials}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reused</b> to build Chirton Hall. A total of 272cart-loads {{were taken from}} the keep. Josceline Percy's property passed to the Duke of Somerset through marriage. In 1698, the owners decided not to renovate Warkworth Castle after the estimate to add battlements, floors and new windows came in at £1,600. Elizabeth Seymour inherited the property from her father in 1750. Her husband, Hugh Smithson, changed his name to Hugh Percy, and the castle then descended through the Dukes of Northumberland, a dynasty he founded.|$|E
5|$|The 1982 work-ins {{took place}} from 24 July to 1 August and 21 August to 29 August. The work planned {{included}} {{the completion of}} the brickwork {{at the top of the}} tower, installation of the Elm curb, a start on the construction of the new cap, installing machinery and making and fitting various doors and windows. The cap frame was constructed, incorporating two beams from the original cap frame that were fit <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reused.</b> The cap frame was completed in autumn 1982. It had been constructed upside down and a mobile crane was used to turn it over and place the windshaft into position.|$|E
5|$|After {{the devastating}} raid of 6 July, the Germans held a {{high-level}} {{meeting on the}} site's future at which Hitler ordered major changes to the site's development. On 12 July 1944 he signed an order instructing that only five HDP guns were to be installed in a single drift. The two others were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reused</b> to house a pair of Krupp K5 artillery pieces, reamed out to a smooth bore with a diameter of , which were to use {{a new type of}} long-range rocket-propelled shell. A pair of Rheinbote missile launchers were to be installed at the tunnel entrances. These plans were soon abandoned as Allied ground forces advanced towards Mimoyecques, and on 30 July the Organisation Todt engineers were ordered to end construction work.|$|E

5|$|While {{the valve}} is off, the threads of {{cylinder}} and valve are checked {{to identify the}} thread type and condition. The threads of cylinder and valve must be of matching thread specification, clean and full form, undamaged and free of cracks, burrs and other imperfections. Ultrasonic inspection may be substituted for the pressure test, which is usually a hydrostatic test and may be either a proof test or a volumetric expansion test, depending on the cylinder design specification. Test pressure is specified in the stamp markings of the cylinder. Valves that are <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reused</b> are inspected and maintained to ensure they remain fit for service. Before fitting the valve the thread type must be checked {{to ensure that a}} valve with matching thread specification is fitted.|$|E
5|$|The {{high school}} was the first new high school {{to be built in}} Saint Paul or Minneapolis since the 1970s. The school {{district}} was also not expecting to build another high school for 40 years after. As a result, the competition to name the school was fierce. The name Arlington High School was eventually chosen from a list of 85 suggestions. Two names, Arlington and Mechanic Arts, were quickly favored. Mechanic Arts was the initial favorite after alumni of the former school campaigned for the name <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reused</b> after the first Mechanic Arts High School was closed down in 1976 after operating for 86 years. The alumni created a lobbying group and even enlisted the help of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun, a 1925 graduate of Mechanic Arts. However, the school board's policy of naming schools after local neighborhoods and street names eventually won out with the name Arlington being chosen in a 5-2 vote. The chosen school colors, blue and white, were the colors of Mechanic Arts.|$|E
5|$|There {{are some}} {{objections}} to {{the interpretation of the}} structure as being a road at all, including the fact that several burial cists along the structure's course protrude through its surface by up to 0.4m, highly unusual for a road surface. Since 1997, authorities including English Heritage have accepted the possibility that the structure may not be a road. Archaeological consultant Blaise Vyner suggested in 1997 that the structure may be the collapsed and heavily robbed remains of a Neolithic or Bronze Age boundary wall or dyke. There are other Neolithic remains on the North York Moors, including boundary dikes, although Knight et al. report that the later Neolithic is very poorly represented archaeologically in the North York Moors area and neolithic use of the moors was likely very limited in extent. Bronze Age presence in the moors, including earthworks, is well represented generally in the archaeology of the area, and therefore is a more plausible origin. Evidence against the identification of the causeway as an early Neolithic structure includes the statement by Elgee in 1912 that the causeway had been identified as cutting across an earlier British earthwork just north of Julian Park, suggesting that it must post-date it. One possibility that could explain several of the anomalies in trying to definitively identify the site is the suggestion by Knight et al. that it was commonly observed practice in the area for dykes <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>reused</b> as trackways.|$|E
