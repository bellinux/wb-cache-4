Solutions with high elemental iodine concentration, such as <b>tincture</b> of iodine and Lugol's solution, are capable of causing tissue damage if used in prolonged cleaning or antisepsis; similarly, liquid Povidone-iodine (Betadine) trapped against the skin resulted in chemical burns in some reported cases.|$|E
5|$|In Polish heraldry, the <b>tincture</b> of {{the charge}} has {{priority}} {{in relation to the}} <b>tincture</b> of the field. In the case of Polish national colors, white, the color of the White Eagle, should always be placed in a more honorable position than red, the color of the field of the Polish coat of arms. In the most usual, horizontal alignment, this means that the white stripe is placed above the red one. If the alignment is vertical, the white stripe should be on the left from the onlooker's point of view. If the flag is hung vertically above a street, the white stripe should be placed on the left when looking in the direction of increasing house numbers. If it drapes a coffin, the white stripe should be placed over the heart.|$|E
40|$|Introduction - <b>Tinctures</b> {{are widely}} used liquid {{pharmaceutical}} preparations traditionally obtained by maceration {{of one or more}} medicinal plants in ethanol-water solutions. Such a process results in the extraction of virtually hundreds of structurally diverse compounds with different polarities. Owing to the large chemical diversity of the constituents present in the herbal <b>tinctures,</b> the analytical tools used for the quality control of <b>tinctures</b> are usually optimised only for the detection of single chemical entities or specific class of compounds. Objective - In order to overcome the major limitations of the current methods used for analysis of <b>tinctures,</b> a new methodological approach based on NMR spectroscopy and MS spectrometry has been tested with different commercial <b>tinctures.</b> Methodology - Diffusion-edited 1 H-NMR (1 D DOSY) and 1 H-NMR with suppression of the ethanol and water signals have been applied {{here for the first time}} to the direct analysis of commercial herbal <b>tinctures</b> derived from Echinacea purpurea, Hypericum perforatum, Ginkgo biloba and Valeriana officinalis. The direct injection of the <b>tinctures</b> in the MS detector in order to obtain the corresponding metabolic profiles was also performed. Results - Using both NMR and MS methods it was possible, without evaporation or separation steps, to obtain a metabolic fingerprint able to distinguish between <b>tinctures</b> prepared with different plants. Batch-to-batch homogeneity, as well as degradation after the expiry date of a batch, was also investigated. Conclusion - The techniques proposed here represent fast and convenient direct analyses of medicinal herbal <b>tinctures...</b>|$|R
40|$|Silybum marianum (L.) Gaertner (Milk thistle) {{extracts}} {{have been}} widely used for the treatment of liver pathologies and as a hepatoprotectant against alcohol-induced liver diseases and other harmful drug metabolites or toxins. Silymarin, the active fraction of Silybum marianum <b>tinctures,</b> accounts for 70 – 80 % of the plant's hydro-alcoholic extract and consists of a mixture of flavonolignans and a flavonoid. Silybum marianum <b>tinctures</b> are commonly prescribed by herbal practitioners for the treatment of liver diseases. However, previous studies have showed inconsistency in the therapeutic efficacy of Silybum marianum <b>tinctures,</b> which is believed to have arisen from the content variability of silymarin, resulting from lack of standardized and regulated manufacturing processes. This work was conducted to quantify the silymarin content in commercial Silybum marianum <b>tinctures</b> in order to evaluate their quality. In this study, we report the determination of the total silymarin content in eleven different commercial <b>tinctures</b> retailed in the U. K. using a convenient and accurate HPLC-UV method. The <b>tinctures</b> analyzed differed in the ratio between herb and liquid as well as percentage of ethanol used during the extraction process. Our results showed a direct correlation between the silymarin content in <b>tinctures</b> and the alcohol strength. Following our protocol, silymarin could not be detected in <b>tinctures</b> extracted with 25 % ethanol. Effective therapeutic doses were found only in <b>tinctures</b> with a concentration ratio herb to liquid 1 : 1 (kg/L) and an alcoholic content of 70 %. To guarantee quality and safety of herbal medicinal products, legal requirements to produce plant-based products under regulatory frameworks are needed...|$|R
40|$|Background: Antioxidant {{compounds}} {{are widely}} used in health protection. Homoeopathic mother <b>tinctures</b> are commonly prescribed for prevention and cure of many illnesses. Objective: The present study focused to determine the antioxidant potential of six commonly prescribed mother <b>tinctures.</b> i. e. Syzygium jambolanum, Damiana, Cinchona officinalis, Chelidonium majus, Convallaria majalis, Coca. Materials and Methods: Antioxidant activity was estimated by 2, 2 -diphenyl- 1 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) inhibition assay. A volume of 0. 1 mM solution of DPPH was used while mother <b>tinctures</b> (5, 2. 5, and 1. 25 μl volumes) were used for estimating antioxidant activity. Quercetin was taken as a standard control in antioxidant activity. Total phenolic content was measured by Folin–Ciocalteu reagent assay. Total phenolic content of mother <b>tinctures</b> was measured in comparison to gallic acid. Results: Results of the study showed the significant antioxidant activity and high total phenolic content of all tested mother <b>tinctures</b> in the following order: Syzygium jambolanum, Damiana, Cinchona officinalis, Chelidonium majus, Convallaria majalis, Coca. Conclusion: Antioxidant potential of mother <b>tinctures</b> is related to total phenolic content present in them, and their role in prevention and cure of diseases may link through their antioxidant activity. Among six selected mother <b>tinctures,</b> S. jambolanum has highest antioxidant potential...|$|R
5|$|Iron(III) {{chloride}} finds use {{in water}} purification and sewage treatment, in the dyeing of cloth, as a coloring agent in paints, as an additive in animal feed, and as an etchant for copper {{in the manufacture of}} printed circuit boards.

5|$|Anecdotal {{evidence}} suggests that the plant may be mildly toxic. The noxious odours have been associated with nausea and headaches, as well as with contact dermatitis reported in both humans and sheep, who also developed weakness and paralysis. It contains a quinone irritant, 2,6-dimethoxybenzoquinone, as well as active quassinoids (ailanthone itself being one) which may account for these effects, but they have, however, proved difficult or impossible to reproduce in humans and goats. In one trial a <b>tincture</b> from the blossom and foliage caused nausea, vomiting and muscular relaxation.|$|E
5|$|Cubebin (C20H20O6) is a {{crystalline}} substance {{existing in}} cubebs, discovered by Eugène Soubeiran and Capitaine in 1839. It may be prepared from cubebene, {{or from the}} pulp left after the distillation of the oil. The drug, along with gum, fatty oils, and malates of magnesium and calcium, contains also about 1% of cubebic acid, and about 6% of a resin. The dose of the fruit is 30 to 60 grains, and the British Pharmacopoeia contains a <b>tincture</b> with a dose of 4 to 1 dram.|$|E
50|$|When {{the same}} {{patterns}} {{are composed of}} <b>tinctures</b> other than argent and azure, they are termed vairé or vairy of those <b>tinctures,</b> rather than vair; potenté of other colours may also be found.

50|$|The <b>tinctures</b> and metals used in Danish {{heraldry}} are {{the same}} as in other European heraldic traditions. The <b>tinctures</b> gules, azure and sable are most common with vert and purpure being less common and furs very rare.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to these seven basic <b>tinctures,</b> which were standard in English heraldry and elsewhere in western Europe, many more <b>tinctures</b> were used in Poland and (after the union with Poland) Lithuania, including grey, steel, brunatre, weasel and carnation.|$|R
5|$|In 1834, in British Guiana, a German physician, Carl Warburg, invented an {{antipyretic}} medicine: 'Warburg's Tincture'. This secret, proprietary remedy contained quinine {{and other}} herbs.

It was considered by many eminent medical professionals {{to be a more}} efficacious antimalarial than quinine. It was also more economical. The British Government supplied Warburg's <b>Tincture</b> to troops in India and other colonies.|$|E
5|$|Medicinal {{plants are}} often tough and fibrous, {{requiring}} {{some form of}} preparation to make them convenient to administer. According to the Institute for Traditional Medicine, common methods for the preparation of herbal medicines include decoction, powdering, and extraction with alcohol, in each case yielding a mixture of substances. Decoction involves crushing and then boiling the plant material in water to produce a liquid extract. Powdering involves drying the plant material and then crushing it to yield a powder that can be compressed into tablets. Alcohol extraction involves soaking the plant material in cold wine or distilled spirit to form a <b>tincture.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Arthurian legends contain {{numerous}} {{instances of}} red knights, black knights or green knights challenging {{the knights of}} the Round Table.

Plain arms were rare in the 12th century, and were used in literature to suggest a primitive heraldry of a time long past. Geoffrey of Monmouth noted with favor that in the Arthurian age, worthy knights used arms of one color, suggesting 12th century heraldic ornamentation was partly pretence (Brault, 29).|$|E

They are essential parts of infection control practices, especially in wound treatment and aid in the prevention of nosocomial infections. This study was done to evaluate and compare the antibacterial effectiveness of povidone iodine and eight commonly used homoeopathic mother <b>tinctures.</b> Materials and Methods: The present study was conducted in the Faculty of Pharmacy and alternative Medicine, The Islamia University of Bahawalpur. All the selected Homeopathic mother <b>tinctures</b> were purchased by Masood Homeopathic Pharmaceuticals, Pakistan. Prepared PYODINEâ (povidone iodine) solution 10 % w/v, batch no. 084 F 4 used as positive control while 70 % ethanol was used as negative control in each test. These <b>tinctures</b> were tested against three clinically important human skin-pathogenic bacteria (Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa) by disc diffusion method with povidone iodine as positive standard. Results: Seven out of eight mother <b>tinctures</b> showed more or less antibacterial activity; some of them have high activity than povidone iodine.

5|$|The heraldic {{term for}} an X-shaped cross is a 'saltire', {{from the old}} French word saultoir or salteur (itself derived from the Latin saltatorium), a word for both a type of stile {{constructed}} from two cross pieces and a type of cross-shaped stirrup-cord. In heraldic language, it may be blazoned azure, a saltire argent. The <b>tincture</b> of the Saltire can appear as either silver (argent) or white, however the term azure does not refer to a particular shade of blue.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{chlorine}} and bromine {{which have}} one significant main use dwarfing all others, iodine {{is used in}} many applications of varying importance. About half of all produced iodine goes into various organoiodine compounds; another 15% remains as the pure element, another 15% is used to form potassium iodide, and another 15% for other inorganic iodine compounds. The remaining 5% is for minor uses. Among the major uses of iodine compounds are catalysts, animal feed supplements, stabilisers, dyes, colourants and pigments, pharmaceutical, sanitation (from <b>tincture</b> of iodine), and photography; minor uses include smog inhibition, cloud seeding, and various uses in analytical chemistry.|$|E
5|$|In English, {{achievements}} of arms are usually described (blazoned) in a specialized jargon that uses derivatives of French terms. In Swedish, however, {{achievements of}} arms {{are described in}} relatively plain language, using only Swedish terms and tending to avoid specialized jargon. Examples {{include the use of}} Swedish blå and grön for blue and green, as compared to the French-derived azure and vert used in English blazon. Rather than argent, the Swedish words silver or vit (white) are used, and white, while rare, may be a different color than silver. Purpur (purple) is used in the lining of crowns and in the royal canopy of the greater national coat of arms. Traditionally, purple was rarely used as a <b>tincture</b> on the shield, though it does appear on the shields of some (especially modern) burgher arms. Ermine likewise appears in the lining of the mantling over the greater national coat of arms, but is otherwise virtually unknown in Swedish heraldry. Vair is also rare in Scandinavian heraldry, and other furs are unknown.|$|E

Mother <b>tinctures</b> (85 % ethanol extracts) of T. aphrodisiaca have also been used {{for the treatment of}} central nervous system disorders. In the present investigation, T. aphrodisiaca mother <b>tinctures</b> formulated by three reputed manufacturers of homoeopathic medicines (NLK, DWSG and SBL) were evaluated for their anxiolytic activity. Dried mother <b>tinctures</b> of T. aphrodisiaca were subjected to anxiolytic activity evaluation at various doses, i. e. 50, 75, 100, 125 or 150 mg/kg p. o. in mice using elevated plus maze apparatus. Dried mother <b>tinctures</b> exhibited significant anxiolytic activity at 50 mg/kg (NLK), 75 mg/kg (DWSG) and 125 mg/kg (SBL), respectively, with reference to control as well as standard (diazepam, 2 mg/kg p. o.). Mother <b>tinctures</b> of T. aphrodisiaca available in the market, have significant anxiolytic activity. Amongst the three mother <b>tinctures</b> of T. aphrodisiaca analyzed, the dry residue of NLK possesses the highest amount of anxiolytic constituent(s).

40|$|<b>Tinctures</b> {{are almost}} the oldest {{medicines}} {{and their use}} is substantial in the medication nowadays as well. The antioxidant values by ferric reducing/antioxidant power (FRAP) method and element content by inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES) were investigated in some <b>tinctures</b> official in the VII. and VIII. Pharmacopoeia Hungarica. The highest FRAP values were found for volatile oil containing Tinctura Aurantii amari epicarpii et mesocarpii, Tinctura Amara and Tinctura Valerianae (764. 54 ± 19. 90; 757. 37 ± 14. 46; 826. 40 ± 5. 89 µmol l − 1, respectively). The correlations between the FRAP values and dilution with different alcohol content in Tinctura Chinae, Tinctura Ipecacuanhae normata and Tinctura Strychni were also investigated.

The common feature of the <b>tinctures</b> seems to be the lithium content. The Ca to Mg concentration ratio was found to be shifted towards magnesium in some of the <b>tinctures</b> that can show a higher Mg absorption which could affect against the proinflammatoric processes in the cases of gastrointestinal diseases...|$|R
5|$|There are 290 {{municipalities}} in Sweden, {{each with}} its own coat of arms. A local government reform in the 1960s–1970s made all cities part of a municipality. The city arms often—but not always—became the coat of arms of the new municipality. As some municipalities were created at this time by merging smaller communities, this led in some cases to arms consisting of two parts, each derived from one of the communities. Some new municipalities also lacked historical cities within, and therefore created wholly new coats of arms. Municipalities which carry the name of a city (with a few exceptions—see below) traditionally display a mural crown on top of their coat of arms. While no law forbids other municipalities from using the mural crown, it is customarily reserved for those bearing former city arms. Kalmar was the first to establish city arms in 1247, and Stockholm, Skara and Örebro were also among the first cities in Sweden to establish city arms. As recently as 2007, Härryda Municipality was among the last municipalities in Sweden to replace its logo with a newly registered coat of arms. Municipal arms may not use any colors (tinctures) other than argent, Or, gules, azure, sable and vert. As in other heraldic traditions, the rule of <b>tincture</b> applies and it is the blazon—not the image—that is legally registered.|$|E
5|$|Thyroid hormones {{to treat}} goiters: In 239 BC, Master Lu's Spring and Autumn Annals stated that where water is too light, people suffer {{widespread}} baldness and goiter. It {{was not until}} the 1860 that French physician Gaspard Adolphe Chatin (1813–1901) linked goiter with the lack of iodine in soil and water; iodine was discovered in the thyroid gland in 1896 by German chemist Eugen Baumann, while thyroid extract was used to treat patients in 1890. The Tang Dynasty (618–907) physician Zhen Quan (d. 643 AD), in his Old and New Tried and Tested Prescriptions, stated that the thyroid glands taken from gelded rams were used to treat patients with goiter; the thyroid hormones could be swallowed in pill form (the body of the pill made from crushed jujube pulp) or as a solid thyroid gland with the fat taken off. The Pharmacopoeia of the Heavenly Husbandman asserted that iodine-rich sargassum was used to treat goiter by the 1st century BC (Ge Hong, 284–364, also suggested using a <b>tincture</b> derived from sargassum seaweed in about 340 AD), a treatment later recorded in the West by Italian practrica Roger of Palermo in his Practica Chirurgiae of 1180 AD.|$|E
