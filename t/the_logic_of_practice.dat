We have outlined three approaches to capture <b>the</b> <b>logic</b> <b>of</b> management <b>practice</b> (1) theorizing through practical rationality, (2) the application of ‘participant objectivation’, and (3) the consideration of the dissociation process. We argue that if strategy-as-practice research builds on these insights, it can prove a particularly fruitful approach to generate knowledge that is of conceptual relevance to strategy practice...|$|R

Antibiotic use and the viability of existing antibiotic options now sit precariously at the nexus of political will, institutional governance and clinical priorities 'at the bedside'. Yet no study has hitherto explored the perspectives of managers, {{instead of focusing on}} clinicians. In this article, drawing on qualitative interviews with hospital managers, we explore accounts of responding to antimicrobial resistance, managing antibiotic governance and negotiating clinical and managerial priorities. We argue that the managers' accounts articulate the problematic nexus of measurement and accountability, the downflow effects of political will, and core tensions within the hospital between moral, managerial and medical authority.

We argue that Bourdieu provides helpful ways of understanding and explaining the complex processes of social interactions which are centre stage in action learning – especially the ‘social friction’ through which action learners gain new insights and new prompts to action in their workplace from learning set members. These insights can support action learning practitioners keen to explore their own practice...|$|E

However, the formation, development, and modification of the power pattern in the intergenerational parenting coalition largely depend on the cultivation of intimate bonds by both the parents and their adult children. Highlighting the intimate bonds sheds light on the importance of bring in individual agency regarding their conception and pursuit of family life in the studies of the intergenerational relations and thus better informs <b>the</b> <b>logic</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> in collaborations across generations.

40|$|In {{recent years}} postructuralist feminism, with its {{emphasis}} on the importance of discourse, has emerged as an important theoretical framework for analysing the place of gender in both labour history and the sociology of education, a framework which assumes agency within constraint, historical specificity and the non-unitary subject. It is argued that at present no satisfactory action theory exists for interpreting empirical findings in these areas within this framework, and that such a theory needs to accommodate both the discourse analysis advocated by poststructualist feminism and the emphasis on "practice" in the work on gender in educational settings of those using concepts taken from humanist marxism. It is suggested that Pierre Bourdieu's theorisation of <b>the</b> <b>logic</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice,</b> if applied in the area of gender, would provide an action theory which encompasses both discourse and practice and which could be used to examine the dynamics of gender construction and reproduction within the broad conceptualisation of the social advocated by postructuralist feminism...|$|E

The research followed phenomenological and ethnographic traditions; complemented by interview data and the exploratory application of visual methods (photography and video). This qualitative research was therefore designed to articulate the essence of public injecting in an urban setting within the UK and provide more nuanced understandings of the relationship between injecting drug use, health-risk and the socio-physical environments in which drugs are injected. This study focused upon the public injecting experience of 31 individuals and considered their motivations, injecting technique (and associated hygiene) and risk/safety management strategies associated with such drug use. The research was further guided by critical theory for considering the role of structure and agency. More specifically, the agency of public injectors was analysed within the theoretical frameworks advocated by Pierre Bourdieu concerning habitus, capital, field and the logics of practice. A wide range of minor harms and major hazards were identified with participation in public injecting. However, those harms and hazards identified were not necessarily unique to the public injecting phenomenon and may be experiences noted within wider drug-injecting practice. Nevertheless, it is the preparedness of public injectors to risk these harms that opportunities for hazard are increased in public settings. Accordingly, the effect of spatially located injecting drug use (in public/semi-public settings) upon health risk may be summarised as one that, in contemporary contexts, amplifies existing injecting related risk and harm. In Bourdieusian terminology, <b>the</b> <b>logic</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> that ensues from the inter-relationality of habitus and capital, within the field of public injecting, is characterised by a commitment to a doxic attitude of resistance (situated and symbolic).

Drawing on Pierre Bourdieu’s social theory, I then unearth the social practices surrounding the interviewed Afghans in the time encompassing their arrival, asylum application, and waiting for a decision in a privately run asylum seeker camp.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I argue that, rather than theory {{development}} aim at simplifying complex organizational phenomena, it should aim at complexifying theories – theoretical complexity {{is needed to}} account for organizational complexity. Defining the latter as the capacity for ‘nontrivial’ action, I explore a complex ‘system of picturing’ organizations as objects of study that provides {{an alternative to the}} hitherto dominant disjunctive style of thinking. A complex ‘system of picturing’ consists of an open-world ontology, a performative epistemology, and a poetic praxeology. Complex theorizing is conjunctive: it seeks to make connections between diverse elements of human experience through making those analytical distinctions that will enable the joining up of concepts normally used in a compartmentalized manner. Insofar as conjunctive theorizing is driven by the need to preserve the ‘living-forward – understanding backward’ dialectic, it is better suited to grasping <b>the</b> <b>logic</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> and, thus, to doing justice to organizational complexity. We come close to grasping complexity when we restore the past to its own present and make distinctions that overcome dualisms, preserving as much as possible relationality, temporality, situatedness and, interpretive open-endedness.

The voice of Sherlock Holmes is used to highlight critical issues involving actual logic in use in qualitative research. Suggestions for modifying existing qualitative research practices, based upon this richer understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>logic</b> in <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> method, are also offered.

40|$|This article {{draws on}} Bourdieu 2 ̆ 7 s field theory and related {{concepts}} of habitus and capitals, to explore policy implementation {{in relation to}} a particular case of teacher professional development in Queensland, Australia. This implementation process is described as an effect of the interplay between what is called the policy field and the field of teachers 2 ̆ 7 work. The policy field demonstrates intra-field tensions between the federal Quality Teacher Programme (QTP) and a raft of state policies, particularly those associated with the Queensland meta-policy, Queensland State Education 2010 (QSE 2010). To investigate the effects of this complex policy ensemble, the article draws upon the experiences of principals and a group of teachers engaged in professional development across a cluster of six schools in south-east Queensland, Australia. The specific focus is on the 2 ̆ 7 Curriculum Board 2 ̆ 7, a cross-school body created by the principals in the participating schools, and its mediated work in policy implementation and teacher learning. The article analyses the effects of the involvement of the principals {{in the creation of the}} board, the limiting impact of QTP requirements to involve consultants rather than support for teacher release, and the limited influence of the board on teacher learning and policy implementation in the individual schools. By doing so, the analysis shows the disjunctions between <b>the</b> <b>logics</b> <b>of</b> <b>practice</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> policy field and that of teachers 2 ̆ 7 work, and the ways in which the differing habitus of principals and teachers and teacher members of the board affected teacher learning and policy implementation. It is argued that effective implementation requires learning within and across fields, and more reflexive habitus of policy makers, principals and teachers...|$|R
