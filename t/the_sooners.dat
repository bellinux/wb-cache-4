5|$|Nearly {{all major}} sports {{publications}} had <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> {{in the preseason}} Top 10. Some had <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> as the preseason No. 1 pick including Athlon, Phil Steele and Gold Sheet. The team {{had a lot of}} young talent this year. The high school scouting website Rivals.com ranked Oklahoma's 2005 recruiting class number one in the nation and the 2006 recruiting class number nine. Most of the 2006 signees redshirted and did not play in 2006. When combined with statements from the Oklahoma coaching staff, <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> expected to be back in contention for the national title this year. On July 24, 2006, <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> were a 51 favorite to win the National Championship.|$|E
5|$|This {{game was}} Bob Stoops's 100th {{as head coach}} at Oklahoma; {{it was also the}} 25th meeting between the programs. <b>The</b> <b>Sooners</b> held a narrow 14–10 lead in the series going into the game, though A had won five of the eight played in College Station. Both <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> and the Aggies were coming off a four-game winning streak.|$|E
5|$|With an 8–1 conference record, <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> {{once again}} won {{a share of}} the Big 12 Championship; however, their loss to the Kansas State Wildcats {{prevented}} them from reaching the 2013 Fiesta Bowl spot. In addition, the non-AQ Northern Illinois Huskies completed the qualifications to go to the 2013 Orange Bowl, leaving <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> out of the Bowl Championship Series (BCS).|$|E

5|$|Gary Pinkel's Missouri {{team was}} the {{surprise}} of the conference in 2006, having already matched their win total from the previous year. They shared the lead for the Big12 North division with Nebraska (who they lost to November 4 in Lincoln). The Tigers won their homecoming game against Kansas State 41–21. <b>The</b> <b>Sooners</b> also won their homecoming game against Colorado by a score of 24–3. This {{was the beginning of}} a long road stretch for Oklahoma; they played four of their last five games on the road. This was the 91st meeting between the schools with <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> holding the advantage 63235.|$|E
5|$|Since Oklahoma won the Big12 Championship game, they {{represented}} the Big12 Conference in the Fiesta Bowl in Glendale, Arizona. Contractually, the Fiesta Bowl hosts the Big12 Champion and then picks, {{from among the}} BCS eligible teams, the opponent. For 2007, the Fiesta Bowl picked Boise State as Oklahoma's opponent. The game took place on New Year's Day in the then-new University of Phoenix Stadium, home of the Arizona Cardinals. The Broncos led <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> {{the majority of the}} game, but <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> made up an 18point deficit late in the game and led by a touchdown with a minute left in regulation. With 18seconds left, <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> had the Broncos in a fourth-and-18 situation from midfield, but were stunned when the Broncos executed a hook and lateral for the tying score. This would be only the first of three Boise State trick plays that helped elevate this game to epic status.|$|E
5|$|After {{the teams}} traded punts {{to open the}} second half, Derrick Henry made the score 31–24 with his 43-yard {{touchdown}} run for the only points scored in the third quarter. Oklahoma next scored on their opening possession of the fourth quarter on a nine-yard Knight touchdown pass to Shepard that capped an eight-play drive. Later in the quarter, Henry scored his second long touchdown of the game for Alabama on a 61—yard reception from McCarron that cut the Oklahoma lead to 38–31. However, <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> closed {{the game with a}} long drive that ran down the clock and in the final minute, an Eric Striker sack of McCarron caused a fumble that Grissom recovered and returned eight-yards for a touchdown and made the final score 45–31. The loss brought Alabama's all-time record against <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> 1–3–1.|$|E

5|$|In Tatum's {{one season}} at Oklahoma, he led <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> to an 8–3 finish and {{a share of}} the Big Six Conference championship. Tatum and his staff also {{recruited}} nine players who became All-Americans: Plato Andros, Buddy Burris, Jack Mitchell, Jim Owens, John Rapacz, Darrell Royal, George Thomas, Wade Walker, and Stan West.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma back Larry Grigg {{managed to}} score the only {{touchdown}} {{of the game}} and Buddy Leake made the extra point. Grigg led <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> in rushing with 89yards on 13carries. Maryland was led by Felton who gained 51yards on tencarries.|$|E
5|$|Paul Thompson had {{a disappointing}} day as he {{completed}} {{only three of}} his twelve passing attempts {{for a total of}} 39yards. A's Stephen McGee was slightly better completing 8 of 18 for 63yards, though he was picked off by Marcus Walker in the third quarter; Garrett Hartley kicked a field goal after <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> offense could not advance the ball after the turnover. The Aggies forced two fumbles of their own (one from Patrick and one from Thompson), but they were forced to punt after their own offense was also stymied. The player of the game was Allen Patrick, who finished the day with a career-high 173yards on 32 carries and one touchdown. However, he suffered a sprained ankle during the last minutes of the game. Coach Wilson questioned whether he would be 100% for the next game. Texas A coach Dennis Franchione dropped to 04 against <b>the</b> <b>Sooners.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Oklahoma Sooners college {{football}} team competes in the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I Football Bowl Subdivision, representing the University of Oklahoma in the Big 12 Conference. <b>The</b> <b>Sooners</b> have played their home games at Oklahoma Memorial Stadium in Norman, Oklahoma since 1923.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sooners</b> {{adopted a}} {{different}} jersey design in 2006, {{which included the}} removal of the players' last names {{from the back of the}} jersey due to the design of the uniform's shoulders and back, and a darker crimson color for the jersey and helmet.|$|E
5|$|After the {{previous}} year's 84 season, <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> looked {{to return to}} past success in 2006. Standout running back Adrian Peterson came into the season healthy and was also on the Maxwell Award watch list. Star linebacker Rufus Alexander (a Bednarik Award hopeful) returned for his senior campaign as did defensive ends C.J. Ah You, Larry Birdine, and Calvin Thibodeaux (Ah You and Birdine were Ted Hendricks Award hopefuls). Reggie Smith was also named to the Jim Thorpe Award watch list.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} quarter, Maryland {{started with the}} wind to their backs. Bill Walker kicked a punt that pinned Oklahoma on their own one-foot line. Oklahoma quarterback Gene Calame rushed twice to gain some {{breathing}} room before <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> punted it away. Maryland took over on the Oklahoma 37-yard line. Quarterback Charlie Boxold completed a nine-yard pass to Dick Nolan. Halfback Chet Hanulak then connected with Nolan again. That {{was followed by a}} first down by fullback Ralph Felton on the Oklahoma four-yard line. Hanulak rushed to pick up twoyards. Nolan then ran to the left but was stopped by Oklahoma back Larry Grigg for no gain. Hanulak rushed again to pick up one more yard. Felton rushed from the one-yard line, but was stopped sixinches shy of the end zone, and Maryland turned over on downs. Maryland again drove inside the Oklahoma 10-yard line. Wilkinson sent in the alternate line-up and Oklahoma again stopped Maryland short. <b>The</b> <b>Sooners</b> fumbled at their own 20-yard line, but the Terrapins again failed to capitalize.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma held a {{significant}} advantage in contests between the schools with the series record at 65–5–2. Iowa State had not won in Norman since 1990 and had dropped nine straight games to <b>the</b> <b>Sooners.</b> The Cyclones' head coach Dan McCarney was 0–5 against Oklahoma while Bob Stoops was 3–0 against Iowa State and 22–3 against {{teams from the}} North Division of the Big12.|$|E
5|$|On December 9, Alabama was {{selected}} as an at-large BCS participant {{to play in the}} Sugar Bowl against Oklahoma. Against <b>the</b> <b>Sooners,</b> the Crimson Tide were upset 45–31 against an upstart Oklahoma squad. Alabama opened the game with a four play, 75-yard touchdown drive that saw AJ McCarron complete a 53-yard pass to Amari Cooper and T. J. Yeldon score on a one-yard run for a 7–0 lead. On the first Oklahoma possession of the game, Landon Collins intercepted a Trevor Knight pass that halted the Sooners' drive. However, on the Alabama play that ensued, McCarron threw an interception to Gabe Lynn, and Oklahoma responded on their next play with a 45-yard Knight pass to Lacoltan Bester that tied the game 7–7. Alabama retook a 10–7 lead on a 27-yard Cade Foster field goal, but <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> again responded and took a 14–10 lead {{at the end of the}} first quarter when Knight threw an eight-yard touchdown pass to Jalen Saunders.|$|E

5|$|The Baylor game {{marked the}} {{beginning}} of a two-game stretch of road games to finish the season for Oklahoma. <b>The</b> <b>Sooners</b> traveled to Baylor in Waco for the 16th meeting between the schools and the seventh at Floyd Casey Stadium. Oklahoma had never lost to the Bears, though the game in 2005 in Norman went into double-overtime. This was the last game of the season for Baylor; even with a win they would not be bowl-eligible.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sooners</b> led {{the conference}} in many defense statistics, {{including}} pass efficiency defense, scoring defense, total defense, and sacks allowed. They finished second in rushing defense. They also {{ranked in the top}} 20 nationally in all the above categories. The Sooners' weakness came on offense where they finished {{in the middle of the}} pack in the conference. The Sooners' rushing offense ranked third in the conference but passing offense ranked tenth, total offense eighth and passing efficiency sixth.|$|E
5|$|The Terrapins, with {{a perfect}} ACC record, were named conference co-champions {{alongside}} Duke {{for the second consecutive}} year. Maryland possessed a perfect regular season record and ranked third in the nation behind Michigan State (8–1). The Terps secured an Orange Bowl rematch against first-ranked Oklahoma and a chance to avenge their defeat in 1953. However, <b>the</b> <b>Sooners</b> beat them again, 20–6, and they finished the postseason with a 10–1 record.|$|E
