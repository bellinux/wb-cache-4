5|$|Preventing Aβ {{aggregation}} is {{a promising}} method to developing therapeutic drugs for Alzheimer's disease, according to Drs. Naeem and Fazili in a literature review article. In 2008, Folding@home simulated {{the dynamics of}} Aβ aggregation in atomic detail over timescales {{of the order of}} tens of seconds. Prior studies were only able to simulate about 10 microseconds. Folding@home was able to simulate Aβ folding for six orders of magnitude longer than formerly possible. Researchers used <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> to identify a beta hairpin that was a major source of molecular interactions within the structure. The study helped prepare the Pande lab for future aggregation studies and for further research to find a small peptide which may stabilize the aggregation process.|$|E
5|$|The FEFAP field surveys, {{excavations}} and exhumations spanned {{more than}} 10years. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> from King William Island and Beechey Island artefacts and human remains {{showed that the}} Beechey Island crew had most likely died of pneumonia and perhaps tuberculosis, which was suggested by the evidence of Pott's disease discovered in Braine. Toxicological reports pointed to lead poisoning as a likely contributing factor. Blade cut marks found on bones {{from some of the}} crew were seen as signs of cannibalism. Evidence suggested that a combination of cold, starvation and disease including scurvy, pneumonia and tuberculosis, all made worse by lead poisoning, killed everyone in the Franklin party.|$|E
25|$|Family {{members may}} have a genetic {{tendency}} for stroke or share a lifestyle that contributes to stroke.

He carried out a comprehensive survey into the living conditions of the poor in York during which investigators visited every working class home. This amounted to the detailed study of 11,560 families or 46,754 individuals. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> were published in 1901 in his book Poverty, A Study of Town Life.|$|E
25|$|While the {{majority}} of exposures {{have been shown to}} come through the diet, accidental ingestion can also be considered a source of exposure. One study conducted in Japan tested plastic baby books to look for possible leaching into saliva when babies chew on them. While <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> have yet to be replicated, it gives reason to question whether exposure can also occur in infants through ingestion by chewing on certain books or toys.|$|E

Doubts have been expressed about <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study.</b> Another study placed Cynomorium in Rosales based on analysis of the two invert repeat regions of the chloroplast genome, which evolve at one fifth {{the rate of the}} two single copy regions.|$|E

25|$|The {{researchers}} found <b>the</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> {{to match their}} initial hypothesis that the gambler's fallacy could in fact be countered {{by the use of}} the hot hand and people's attention to the person who was actively flipping the coin. It {{is important to note that}} this counteraction of the gambler's fallacy only happened if the person tossing the coin remained the same. This study shed light on the idea that the gambler's and hot hand fallacies at times fight for dominance when people try to make predictions about the same event.|$|E
25|$|Current {{research}} shows that when music therapy is {{used in conjunction with}} traditional therapy, it improves rates of recovery and emotional and social deficits resulting from stroke. A study by Jeong & Kim examined the impact of music therapy when combined with traditional stroke therapy in a community-based rehabilitation program. Thirty-three stroke survivors were randomized into one of two groups: the experimental group, which combined rhythmic music and specialized rehabilitation movement for eight weeks; and a control group that sought and received traditional therapy. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> showed that participants in the experimental group gained not only more flexibility and wider range of motion, but an increased frequency and quality of social interactions and positive mood.|$|E
25|$|One {{study done}} by Simon Vermeier used neuroimaging to {{investigate}} serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission in 9 dogs with Canine Compulsive Disorder (CCD) {{to measure the}} serotonin 2A receptor availability. When compared to the 15 non-compulsive dogs used as a control group, the dogs with CCD {{were found to have}} lower receptor availability as well as lower subcortical perfusion and hypothalamic availability. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> provide evidence that there are imbalanced serotonergic and dopaminergic pathways in dogs. Similarities between other studies about human OCD provide construct validity for this study, which suggests that the research will be valid and useful in continuing to investigate brain activity and drug treatment in Obsessive Compulsive Disorder.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> {{show that}} the {{earliest}} age at which children can discriminate well-formed from ill-formed sentences, as well as correct these, is at 6 years. During the critical period between 4 and 6 years old, {{there is a significant}} increase in the accuracy of grammaticality judgments, since metalinguistic skill is in critical development; the judgment relies on the psycholinguistic ability of the child to access their internalized grammar and to compute whether it can or cannot generate the target sentence. This ability to judge the grammaticality of sentences seems to develop in children well after basic grammar skills have been established, and is related to early reading acquisition—acquisitionists generally believe that the ability to make grammaticality judgments is a measure of syntactic awareness.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> {{indicate}} that the taxi drivers' (experts') recall of streets was higher in both the route order condition and the map order condition than in the two random conditions. This indicates that the experts {{were able to use}} their prelearned spatial knowledge to organize the information {{in such a way that}} they surpassed STM and WM capacity limitations. The organization strategy that the drivers employed is known as chunking. Additionally, the comments made by the experts during the procedure point towards their use of route knowledge in completing the task. To ensure that it was in fact spatial information that they were encoding, the researchers also presented lists in alphabetical order and semantic categories. However, the researchers found that it was in fact spatial information that the experts were chunking, allowing them to surpass the limitations of both visuo-spatial STM and WM.|$|E
25|$|Another {{study of}} the Amerindian ancestry of Argentines was headed by Argentine {{geneticist}} Daniel Corach of the University of Buenos Aires. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> in which DNA from 320 individuals in 9 Argentine provinces was examined showed that 56% of these individuals {{had at least one}} Amerindian ancestor. Another study on African ancestry was also conducted by the University of Buenos Aires in the city of La Plata. In this study 4.3% of the 500 study participants were shown to have some degree of African ancestry. Nevertheless, it must be said here that this type of genetic studies -meant only to search for specific lineages in the mtDNA or in the Y-Chromosome, which do not recombine- may be misleading. For example, a person with seven European great-grandparents and only one Amerindian/Mestizo great-grandparent will be included in that 56%, although his/her phenotype will most probably be Caucasian.|$|E

25|$|The ABO antigen is also {{expressed}} on the von Willebrand factor (vWF) glycoprotein, which participates in hemostasis (control of bleeding). In fact, having type O blood predisposes to bleeding, as 30% {{of the total}} genetic variation observed in plasma vWF is explained by {{the effect of the}} ABO blood group, and individuals with group O blood normally have significantly lower plasma levels of vWF (and Factor VIII) than do non-O individuals. In addition, vWF is degraded more rapidly due to the higher prevalence of blood group O with the Cys1584 variant of vWF (an amino acid polymorphism in VWF): the gene for ADAMTS13 (vWF-cleaving protease) maps to the ninth chromosome (9q34), the same locus as ABO blood type. Higher levels of vWF are more common amongst people who have had ischemic stroke (from blood clotting) for the first time. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> found that the occurrence was not affected by ADAMTS13 polymorphism, and the only significant genetic factor was the person's blood group.|$|E

This SCBA had had air supply into the mask with [...] "on demand" [...] mode (with negative pressure under the mask during inhalation).

Carboxyhemoglobin formed due to inhalation of carbon monoxide. The biomonitoring results shown: (1) the intermittently usage of these respirators makes it totally ineffective; (2) even in continuous usage of such breathing apparatus does not provide effective protection. <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> (and other similar studies) led to restrict the use of respirators with fresh air supply [...] "on demand"; and to prohibit their use in fighting fires.

2500|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} music therapy techniques used with adolescents. The music therapy model is based on various theoretical backgrounds such as psychodynamic, behavioral, and humanistic approaches. Techniques can be classified as active vs. receptive and improvisational vs. structured. The most common techniques in use with adolescents are musical improvisation, the use of precomposed songs or music, receptive listening to music, verbal discussion about the music, and incorporating creative media outlets into the therapy. Research also showed that improvisation {{and the use of}} other media were the two techniques most often used by the music therapists. The overall research showed that adolescents in music therapy [...] "change more when discipline-specific music therapy techniques, such as improvisation and verbal reflection of the music, are used". <b>The</b> <b>results</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>study</b> showed that music therapists should put careful thought into their choice of technique with each individual client.
