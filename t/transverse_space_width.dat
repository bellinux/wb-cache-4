Current methods require proprietary software or have not been well validated; our purpose was to develop and assess the reliability of a digital joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> quantification method using public access software. We studied 95 patients, asymptomatic in the ankles and without history of ankle trauma, but with symptomatic medial knee osteoarthritis, participating in an ongoing longitudinal trial. Weightbearing anteroposterior radiographs of the ankle and supine radiographs of the pelvis were assessed, and the narrowest medial and lateral tibiotalar joint <b>space</b> <b>widths</b> and hip joint <b>space</b> <b>widths</b> were measured using Image J software (US NIH, Bethesda, MD).

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} impact of axial {{traction}} during acquisition of direct magnetic resonance (MR) arthrography of the wrist with regard to joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> and amount of contrast material between the opposing cartilage surfaces. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen consecutive patients (12 male, mean age 38. 1 years) were included in this Institutional Review Board-approved prospective study. Three-compartment wrist MR arthrographies were performed between October and December 2009 on a 3 T unit using a fat-suppressed T 1 -weighted isotropic high-resolution volumetric interpolated breathhold examination (VIBE) sequence in the coronal plane, with and without axial traction (3 kg). Two radiologists measured radiocarpal (radioscaphoid, radiolunate) and midcarpal (lunocapitate, hamatolunate) joint <b>space</b> <b>widths,</b> with and without traction, and assessed the amount of contrast material between the opposing cartilage surfaces using a three-point scale: 0 = absence, 1 = partial, 2 = complete. RESULTS: With traction, joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> increased significantly at the radioscaphoid (Delta = 0. 78 mm, P < 0. 01), radiolunate (Delta = 0. 18 mm, P < 0. 01), and lunocapitate (Delta = 0. 45 mm, P < 0. 01) spaces, and both observers detected significantly more contrast material between the cartilage surfaces. At the hamatolunate space, the differences in joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> (Delta = 0. 14 mm, P = 0. 54) and amount of contrast material were not significant. CONCLUSION: Direct wrist MR arthrography with axial traction of 3 kg increases joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> at the radiocarpal and lunocapitate spaces, and prompts better coverage of the articular cartilage by the contrast material.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relationship between the biochemical markers of arthritis and the radiographic grading of osteoarthritis (OA) in knees. Seventy-one women aged 49 - 85 years with knee OA were studied. Anterior-posterior knee radiographs and hand radiographs were taken in all patients. The radiographic grading of OA in the knee was performed by using the Kellgren-Lawrence criteria and the joint <b>space</b> <b>width.</b> The 71 patients with knee OA were divided into two groups: 37 patients exhibiting generalized osteoarthritis (GOA) and 34 non-GOA patients, according to the grading of their hand radiograph. C-reactive protein (CRP), urinary pyridinoline, YKL- 40, plasma matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) - 3, MMP- 9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMP) - 1 were measured as the biochemical markers of arthritis. The radiographic grading with the Kellgren-Lawrence scale revealed a significant relationship to the joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> (P = 0. 003) : the joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> decreased with increasing Kellgren-Lawrence grade. All biochemical markers had negative correlations with the joint <b>space</b> <b>width,</b> but only urinary pyridinoline had a significant correlation (P = 0. 039).

STUDY DESIGN: Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. METHODS: A total of 62 patients (15 women and 47 men) with all ligaments intact, no previous surgery to either knee, and an isolated degenerative medial meniscus tear removed in 1 knee were examined. The mean age at examination was 58. 2 years at a mean follow-up of 9. 4 years (range, 4 - 20 years). Subjective results were obtained with the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) knee survey. Radiographs were taken using 45 ° weightbearing posteroanterior views. Midpoint and perceived minimum joint <b>space</b> <b>width</b> of the medial and lateral compartments of both knees were measured to the nearest 0. 1 mm by 2 observers at different times, and they were blinded as to the previous measurements (Pearson intra- and interclass correlations, > 0. 93).
