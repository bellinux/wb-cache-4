5|$|During the 1920s, Victoria had repressive and {{restrictive}} drinking laws, {{including the}} notorious six o'clock closing. Blamey took {{the position that}} it was the job of the police to enforce the laws, even if they did not support them. Many members of the public did not agree with this attitude, maintaining that the police should not uphold such laws. Almost as controversially, Blamey drew a sharp distinction between his personal life and his job. His presence in a hotel after closing time was always welcome, as it meant <b>that</b> <b>drinking</b> could continue, for it was known {{that it would not be}} raided while he was there; but other citizens felt that it was unjust when they were arrested for breaking the same laws.|$|E
5|$|Many small {{communities}} obtain their drinking water from diverse sources (lakes, streams, springs and groundwater wells). Levels of treatment vary widely, from rudimentary systems with coarse screening or settling followed by disinfection (usually chlorination), to more sophisticated systems using a filtration step. It {{should be noted}} that unless a high quality source is used, such as secure groundwater, disinfection alone is unlikely to guarantee <b>that</b> <b>drinking</b> water is safe from protozoa such as Giardia and Cryptosporidium, which are relatively resistant to standard disinfectants and which require additional removal steps such as filtration.|$|E
5|$|After his defeat, Dow {{continued}} to promote prohibition around the country, and was gratified {{to see it}} spread to eleven states. He also made efforts to refute the charge made by his enemies (including his cousin John Neal) that the Maine law was ineffective and <b>that</b> <b>drinking</b> had actually increased in Portland during Dow's term in office. In 1854, Dow ran for mayor again unsuccessfully; as the Whig Party began to break apart, Dow attracted support from the Free Soilers and the Know Nothings, a nativist party. By the next year, those two parties began to join anti-slavery Whigs in a new party, the Republicans. They soon controlled the state legislature and, with Dow's encouragement, strengthened the enforcement provisions of the Maine law. Dow ran again for mayor in 1855 and was narrowly re-elected to the office he had left three years earlier.|$|E

25|$|It is {{estimated}} that each year about 17,000 children die from diarrhea. One reason is <b>that</b> <b>drinking</b> water quality is often below standards. Some water treatment plants are not maintained properly and are thus inefficient in removing parasites, viruses and other parasitic microorganisms. In 2009, {{a study by the}} Ministry of Health showed <b>that</b> <b>drinking</b> water for half a million people in Asiut was unfit for human consumption. As of June 2011, nothing had been done to address the problem. Chlorination systems of wells, which had been installed years ago because high levels of bacteria had been detected in the groundwater, failed for lack of maintenance and have been shut down so that untreated water is provided to the residents.|$|E

25|$|Age: {{some people}} {{experience}} hangovers as getting worse as one ages.

To avoid the possibility of BPA leaching into food or drink, the National Toxicology Panel recommends avoiding microwaving food in plastic containers, putting plastics in the dishwasher, or using harsh detergents.|$|E
25|$|Hair of the dog: The {{belief is}} that {{consumption}} of further alcohol after the onset of a hangover will relieve symptoms, based upon {{the theory that the}} hangover represents a form of alcohol withdrawal and that by satiating the body's need for alcohol the symptoms will be relieved. Social drinkers and alcoholics claim <b>that</b> <b>drinking</b> more alcohol gives relief from hangover symptoms, but research shows that the use of alcohol as a hangover cure seems to predict current or future problem drinking and alcohol use disorder, through negative reinforcement and the development of physical dependence. While the practice is popular in tradition and promoted by many sellers of alcoholic beverages, medical opinion holds that the practice merely postpones the symptoms, and courts addiction. Favored choices include Fernet Branca and Bloody Mary.|$|E
25|$|On 27 November 2013, the occupying {{students}} filmed two professors from Sofia University {{who were}} celebrating a birthday and the conferral of a professorship while drinking alcohol {{on the premises}} of the university (outside working hours). While some commentators were critical of the academics for setting a bad example and possibly violating university policies, others condemned the students for going overboard in their desire to pontificate about morality and for supposedly being motivated by revanchism (because the two professors had publicly opposed the occupation). Ivaylo Dinev, {{one of the leading}} figures behind the first occupation, later regretted the decision to make the clip available to the general public, calling it a strategic and moral mistake, as it shifted the focus of the wider society on a relatively unimportant issue, caused the student protesters to lose some outside support, and created friction within the ranks of the occupying students themselves. He also acknowledged <b>that</b> <b>drinking</b> alcohol (by both students and academics) during special occasions had always been regarded as being compatible with the ethos of the university.|$|E

25|$|Increased arsenic, nitrate and {{fluoride}} contamination {{was detected}} {{in drinking water}} in various localities in Pakistan, according to an official government document. Generally, water pressure is low in Pakistani supply systems. Together with leaky pipes, this leads to infiltration of contaminated water. A survey of drinking water samples in Karachi in 2007/08 found that, of 216 ground and surface water samples collected, 86% had lead levels higher than the WHO maximum acceptable concentration of 10 parts per billion (ppb). The mean lead concentration was 146 ppb in untreated ground water and 77 ppb in treated tap water. In 2012, according to Rafiq Khanani, professor and pathology chairman at the Dow University of Health Sciences, water-borne Naegleria fowleri have killed at least 10 people in Karachi in three months. The infection does not occur by drinking water infested with the amoeba, but if water enters the nose. The amoeba then attack the brain and cause primary amoebic meningoencephalitis. Newspapers reported <b>that</b> <b>drinking</b> water was provided without any treatment or disinfection, which facilitated {{the spread of the}} amoeba. As a reaction to the findings, a citizen of Karachi submitted a court petition asking the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board to fulfill its duty to provide clean water. In October 2012, the Sindh High Court issued a notice to the Board asking it to comment on the petition.|$|E
