5|$|Overlordship was {{a central}} feature of Anglo-Saxon {{politics}} which began before Æthelberht's time; kings were described as overlords {{as late as the}} ninth century. The Anglo-Saxon invasion may have involved military coordination of different groups within the invaders, with a leader who had authority over many different groups; Ælle of Sussex may have been such a leader. Once the new states began to form, conflicts among them began. Tribute from dependents could lead <b>to</b> <b>wealth.</b> A weaker state also might ask or pay for the protection of a stronger neighbour against a warlike third state.|$|E
5|$|Settlement of Kent by {{continental}} peoples, primarily Jutes, {{was complete}} {{by the end}} of the sixth century. Eadbald's father, Æthelberht, probably came to the throne in about 589 or 590, though the chronology of his reign is very difficult to determine accurately. Æthelberht was recorded by the early chronicler Bede as having overlordship, or imperium, over other Anglo-Saxon kingdoms. This dominance led <b>to</b> <b>wealth</b> in the form of tribute, and Kent was a powerful kingdom at the time of Æthelberht's death in 616, with trade well-established with the European mainland.|$|E

25|$|These beliefs were {{complemented by}} {{a belief that}} laborers could be best {{motivated}} by financial incentive. This belief led {{to the passage of}} the Poor Law Amendment Act 1834, which limited the provision of social assistance, {{based on the idea that}} markets are the mechanism that most efficiently leads <b>to</b> <b>wealth.</b> Adopting Thomas Malthus's population theory, they saw poor urban conditions as inevitable, they believed population growth would outstrip food production and they regarded that consequence desirable, because starvation would help limit population growth. They opposed any income or wealth redistribution, which they believed would be dissipated by the lowest orders.|$|E
25|$|Nigamananda {{said that}} one should {{remember}} that death is coming. Before working on good or evil deeds one should also remember that death is not far off. Contemplating death drives away the desire for sensual pleasure and evil thoughts and stops acts of injustice. Attachment <b>to</b> <b>wealth</b> and relations will then diminish. Earthly matters remain even after departure from this world. Only spiritual wealth remains as an asset to the individual. Those who have puffed with pride on account of their accomplishments will submit to the God of death meekly when that hour comes. Drunk with pride, some persons ill-treat their brethren. They will {{be left in the}} deserted crematory ground with the beasts and birds joyously waiting to feast upon their flesh. Thinking of this will drive evil thoughts from the mind.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s, the Japanese economy shifted its {{emphasis}} from {{primary and secondary}} activities (notably agriculture, manufacturing, and mining) to processing, with telecommunications and computers becoming increasingly vital. Information became an important resource and product, central <b>to</b> <b>wealth</b> and power. The rise of an information-based economy was led by major research in highly sophisticated technology, such as advanced computers. The selling and use of information became very beneficial to the economy. Tokyo became a major financial center, {{home to some of}} the world's major banks, financial firms, insurance companies, and the world's largest stock exchange, the Tokyo Securities and Stock Exchange. Even here, however, the recession took its toll. In 1992, the Nikkei 225 stock average began the year at 23,000 points, but fell to 14,000 points in mid-August before leveling off at 17,000 {{by the end of the}} year.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} {{designers of}} gross product accounts (such as Simon Kuznets, Colin Clark, Edward Fulton Denison and Richard Stone) aimed precisely to exclude any capital gains (or other income from asset transactions and revaluations) from their measure of gross output, just like transfer payments. They wanted a reliable standard {{measure that would}} indicate changes {{in the value of}} the net new addition <b>to</b> <b>wealth</b> per year or per quarter: roughly, the total sales revenue from production less intermediate costs, or, the value of total outputs produced less the value of goods and services used up to produce them, or, the sum of factor incomes directly generated by production. The issue then is, how exactly the grossing and netting must be done to obtain the value of total output, and it is done in a different way than business itself would do it (to eliminate non-production income/expenditure, ensure uniform valuation, and remove double counting; from the point of view of national accounts, in fact real credits can become theoretical debits, and real debits can become theoretical credits).|$|E
500|$|This {{crushing}} defeat {{prompted a}} series of military reforms by Marcus Furius Camillus. Under the new system, men were sorted into classes according <b>to</b> <b>wealth,</b> the triarii being the richest after the mounted equites. Triarii were armed with spears, or hastae, about 2metres (6½feet) long. They also carried [...] swords, or gladii, about 84centimetres (29inches) long, in case the spear broke or the enemy drew too close.|$|E
500|$|As {{his wealth}} increased, Bottomley adopted an {{increasingly}} ostentatious lifestyle. In London {{he lived in}} a luxurious apartment in Pall Mall. He took numerous mistresses, whom he visited in several discreet flats in different districts of London. He owned several racehorses, which achieved prestigious victories—the Stewards' Cup at Goodwood, and the Cesarewitch at Newmarket—but he often lost large sums through unwise bets. Quite early in his rise <b>to</b> <b>wealth</b> he bought a modest property in Upper Dicker, near Eastbourne in East Sussex. He called it [...] "The Dicker", and over the years extended and developed it into a large country mansion, where he entertained extravagantly.|$|E

500|$|Away {{from his}} expeditions, Shackleton's life was {{generally}} restless and unfulfilled. In {{his search for}} rapid pathways <b>to</b> <b>wealth</b> and security, he launched business ventures which failed to prosper, and he died heavily in debt. Upon his death, he was lauded in the press, but was thereafter largely forgotten, while the heroic reputation of his rival Scott was sustained for many decades. Later in the 20th century, Shackleton was [...] "rediscovered", and rapidly became {{a role model for}} leadership as one who, in extreme circumstances, kept his team together in a survival story described by cultural historian Stephanie Barczewski as [...] "incredible". In his 1956 address to the British [...] Association, Sir Raymond Priestley, one of his contemporaries, said [...] "Scott for scientific method, Amundsen for speed and efficiency but when disaster strikes and all hope is gone, get down on your knees and pray for Shackleton", paraphrasing what Apsley Cherry-Garrard had written in a preface to The Worst Journey in the World.|$|E
500|$|Of Sicily's own form of Baroque, post 1693, it {{has been}} said, [...] "The {{buildings}} conceived {{in the wake of}} this disaster expressed a light-hearted freedom of decoration whose incongruous gaiety was intended, perhaps, to assuage the horror". While this is an accurate description of a style which is almost a celebration of joie de vivre in stone, it is unlikely to be the reason for the choice. As with all architectural styles, the selection of style would have directly linked to current fashion. Versailles had been completed in 1688 in a far sterner Baroque style; Louis XIV's new palace was immediately emulated across Europe by any aristocrat or sovereign in Europe aspiring <b>to</b> <b>wealth,</b> taste, or power. Thus it was the obvious choice for the [...] "homeless rich" [...] of Sicily, of whom there were hundreds. The excesses of the Baroque-style palazzi and country villas to be constructed in Sicily, however, were soon to make Versailles seem a model of restraint.|$|E
500|$|Various philosophers, {{such as the}} Pythagoreans, had {{advocated}} simple {{living in}} the centuries preceding the Cynics. In the early 6th century BC, Anacharsis, a Scythian sage, had combined plain living together with criticisms of Greek customs in a manner which would become standard among the Cynics. Perhaps of importance were tales of Indian philosophers, known to later Greeks as the gymnosophists, who had adopted a strict asceticism together with a disrespect for established laws and customs. By the 5th century BC, the sophists had begun a process of questioning many aspects of Greek society such as religion, law and ethics. However, the most immediate influence for the Cynic school was Socrates. Although {{he was not an}} ascetic, he did profess a love of virtue and an indifference <b>to</b> <b>wealth,</b> together with a disdain for general opinion. [...] These aspects of Socrates' thought, which formed only a minor part of Plato's philosophy, became the central inspiration for another of Socrates' pupils, Antisthenes.|$|E
