2500|$|In 2007 the Office of Communications (Ofcom) {{awarded a}} DAB Digital Radio {{multiplex}} licence for Herefordshire & Worcestershire to [...] MuxCo Ltd. who aimed to provide several new stations in 2009, while also providing a digital platform for Free Radio, Sunshine Radio and BBC Hereford & Worcester and area extensions to United Christian Broadcasters and the Highways Agency. This multiplex eventually launched in December 2013, carrying the three aforementioned local services. In 2008, MXR, who {{owned and operated}} the West Midlands regional DAB multiplex licence, improved coverage of DAB Digital Radio across {{other parts of the}} county to include Worcester and Malvern. Services that could be heard reasonably across much of Worcestershire included: Chill, Gold (Birmingham), Magic Radio, Sunrise Radio, <b>Traffic</b> <b>Radio</b> (Midlands), BBC Radio WM, Xfm and Radio XL. However, this regional multiplex closed on 27 August 2013, reducing the number of services available in the county.
