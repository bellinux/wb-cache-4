25|$|When I saw Going My Way I was as {{moved as}} they were by the {{character}} he played. Father O'Malley handled that gang of young hooligans in his parish with such kindness and wisdom that I thought he was wonderful too. Instead of coming {{down hard on the}} kids and withdrawing his affection, he forgave them their misdeeds, took them to the ball game and picture show, taught them how to sing. By the last reel, the sheer persistence of his goodness had transformed even the worst of them into solid citizens. Then the lights came on and the movie was over. All {{the way back to the}} house I thought about the difference between the person up there on the screen and <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> knew at home.|$|E

25|$|Macleod {{described}} his policy over North Rhodesia (modern Zambia) as “incredibly devious and tortuous” but “easily <b>the</b> <b>one</b> <b>I</b> am most proud of”. Macleod's initial {{plan for a}} Legislative Council with an African majority (16 African members to 14 Europeans) was strongly opposed by Sir Roy Welensky, Prime Minister of the Central African Federation. After a long battle {{in the first half}} of 1961, and under pressure from cabinet colleagues, Macleod accepted Welensky's proposal for a council of 45 members, 15 of whom would be elected by a largely African electoral roll, 15 by a largely European roll, 14 by both rolls jointly (with a further stipulation that successful candidates had to gain at least 10% of the African votes and 10% of the European ones) and 1 by Asians. Macleod's role in these negotiations attracted damaging and much-remembered criticism of Macleod by the party grandee, the Marquess of Salisbury, who had resigned from a senior position in the Cabinet over Cyprus in 1957. In a speech in the House of Lords on 7 March 1961 Salisbury denounced Macleod as “too clever by half” and accused him of bridge-table trickery. The new constitution, which was equally disliked by both Africans and Europeans, helped to weaken the Central African Federation, which was later wound up by Rab Butler at the Victoria Falls Conference on 5 July 1963.|$|E

500|$|<b>The</b> <b>One</b> <b>I</b> Love was {{developed}} by Clamp—the all-female, manga artist team consisting of Satsuki Igarashi, Mokona, Tsubaki Nekoi, and Nanase Ohkawa. The group decided {{on the theme of}} romance after considering the target audience of the manga magazine Monthly Young Rose, whose editors had asked them for a manga. For <b>The</b> <b>One</b> <b>I</b> Love, Ohkawa wrote the essays, and Nekoi illustrated the manga, the first time she primarily illustrated a series for the group. For costumes, Ohkawa used [...] "Anon non-no Olive" [...] as a reference. Additionally, the preview panels of each story featured different visual motifs, primarily girls and animals. In retrospective, Nekoi self-deprecatingly thought that her illustrations of the female protagonists, including working women, made them resemble junior high students.|$|E

500|$|Breezy {{questioned}} if the song's {{content was}} inspired by Fantasia's past affair with a married man. The singer explained that the single was about self-love, saying: [...] "My song talks about all the bad relationships but I'm grateful for going through them." [...] Fantasia compared [...] "Sleeping with <b>the</b> <b>One</b> <b>I</b> Love" [...] to her 2005 single [...] "Free Yourself", explaining that they both have [...] "that gritty, bluesy feeling". Amber McKynzie described the main theme of the song as [...] "what it’s like to love hard and not get the same love in return". Matthew Scott Donnelly wrote that [...] "Sleeping with <b>the</b> <b>One</b> <b>I</b> Love" [...] was [...] "a modern sister track" [...] to Ben E. King's 1963 single [...] "I (Who Have Nothing)".
