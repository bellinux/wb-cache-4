5|$|Under the {{original}} {{terms of the}} state constitution, the lieutenant governor was elected for a two-year term on a separate ticket from the governor; because of this, <b>the</b> <b>Governor</b> <b>and</b> Lieutenant Governor of Wisconsin {{have not always been}} of the same party. After a 1967 amendment, however, the two have been nominated, and voted upon, as a single ticket. Another 1967 amendment increased the terms of both <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> <b>and</b> lieutenant governor to four years. There is no limit to the number of terms a lieutenant governor may hold.|$|E

5|$|Kentucky {{is one of}} {{only five}} U.S. states to hold gubernatorial {{elections}} in odd-numbered years—commonly called an off-year election.

The general election for governor and lieutenant governor is held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. <b>The</b> <b>governor</b> <b>and</b> lieutenant governor are inaugurated on the fifth Tuesday after their election.

5|$|Leaders of the Southern Baptists and United Methodists led {{opposition}} to the amendment during Wilkinson's administration, activating the Coalition Against a State Lottery. Despite the opposition, Kentucky voters approved the lottery amendment {{by a vote of}} 694,577 to 446,937 in the November 1988 elections. Days after the election, Wilkinson signed a proclamation calling a special legislative session to begin November 28 to pass legislation to implement the lottery. The call instructed the legislature to consider a bill based on the recommendations of Wilkinson's lottery commission. The recommendations included the establishment of a lottery board whose president and members would be appointed by <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> <b>and</b> could only be removed by <b>the</b> <b>governor,</b> <b>and</b> earmarked the first year's proceeds to be split evenly between early childhood education programs, programs for the elderly, and a one-time bonus to veterans of the Vietnam War. Legislators insisted on more legislative control of the lottery and did not favor explicit earmarks for the proceeds, preferring to allocate them in the 1990 legislative session. They also objected to the lottery board's exemption from open records and open meetings laws.|$|E

5|$|New {{regulations}} for prison officers {{were published in}} the Government Gazette in 1902, and a new Prisons Act was passed in 1903.

5|$|Originally, the {{president}} of the state senate acted as governor should that office be vacant. The 1865 and 1868 constitutions created the office of lieutenant governor, who would similarly act as governor.

The 1968 constitution recreated the office of lieutenant governor, who now becomes governor in the absence of the governor. <b>The</b> <b>governor</b> <b>and</b> lieutenant governor are elected on the same ticket.|$|E

5|$|Acting on {{recommendations}} from Beckham's commission, legislators helped offset the lost {{revenue from the}} sales tax by raising excise taxes; of particular import was the tax on whiskey, which {{was made possible by}} the repeal of Prohibition in 1935. Legislators also enacted the state's first income tax during the session. Chandler further proposed to achieve savings through the Governmental Reorganization Act of 1936. The bill realized significant cost savings by restructuring the state government, reducing the number of boards and commissions in the executive branch from 133 to 22. Critics pointed out that the act also centralized more {{power in the hands of}} <b>the</b> <b>governor</b> <b>and</b> accused Chandler of ulterior motives in supporting it.|$|E

Union president Calderwood assured him that union members would cooperate with his operations, even surrendering for arrest if requested. Convinced that Bowers had exaggerated the extent of the chaos in the region, Tarsney recommended the withdrawal of troops; Waite concurred. The state militia left Cripple Creek on March 20.|$|E
