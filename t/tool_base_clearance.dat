40|$|This report {{discusses}} {{the use of}} parallel computation for optimisation <b>based</b> <b>clearance</b> and gives a brief specification of a software tool which will put some of the possible parallelisation concepts into practice. The basic features of an application programming interface (API) for parallel computation in MATLAB are sketched and different types of parallelisation useful in optimisation based flight control law clearance are developed...|$|R

A ¯rst set of criteria covering partly the nonlinear model based assessment of aircraft manoeuvrability, non- exceedance of protection limits {{as well as the}} criterion for actuator damages due to fatigue have been implemented. The implemented functions in MATLAB share a common interface which can be easily customized for existing general purpose optimization tools...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{presents}} the theoretical background for several enhancements of the worst-case parameter search <b>based</b> <b>clearance</b> of flight control laws. The worst case search method aims to find combinations of parameters and flight conditions {{for which the}} clearance criteria are mostly violated or poorly satisfied. The two main aspects for the proposed enhancements are: (1) increasing the reliability of clearance by the application of global optimization methods in conjunction with established simulation and analysis tools; and (2) increasing the efficiency of clearance by applying parallel computation techniques...|$|R
