25|$|Long and {{laborious}} negotiations followed {{between the}} Danish {{government and the}} representatives of the Løgting. Finally a public vote was held on 14 September 1946 where the electorate was to choose between a Danish proposition of Home rule and full secession from Denmark. <b>This</b> <b>election</b> <b>is</b> not considered a referendum, as the parliament was not bound to follow the decision of the vote. The result was a marginal majority of 161 votes for secession from Denmark (48.7% in favour, 47.2% against, 4.1% blank or spoilt).|$|E

25|$|As it was then, <b>this</b> <b>election</b> <b>is</b> still today {{shrouded}} in controversy, and there exist two popular stances in this discussion. On one hand, some people {{argue that there}} was a resolve in favor of independence, as there actually was a factual majority for secession, even if it was a small one. On the other hand, other people argue that the majority was far too small, as there were in fact only 161 more votes for independence, and this side specifically argues that only a qualified majority can be large enough grounds to pass a vote of such social and political consequence.|$|E
25|$|During the 1983 Assembly elections, Indira Gandhi campaigned aggressively, {{raising the}} bogey of a 'Muslim invasion' in the Jammu region {{because of the}} Resettlement Bill, passed by the then NC government, which gave Kashmiris who left for Pakistan between 1947 and 1954 the right to return, reclaim their {{properties}} and resettle. On the other hand, Farooq Abdullah allied with the Mirwaiz Maulvi Mohammed Farooq for the elections and charged that the state's autonomy had been eroded by successive Congress Party governments. The strategies yielded dividends and the Congress won 26 seats, while the NC secured 46. Barring an odd constituency, all victories of the Congress were in the Jammu and Ladakh regions, while NC swept the Kashmir Valley. <b>This</b> <b>election</b> <b>is</b> said to have cemented the political polarization on religious lines in the Jammu and Kashmir state.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>{{election}}</b> <b>is</b> {{the last}} election - presidential, local and general - scheduled in Turkey until 2019. Arguments as to whether this is by chance, {{or whether it was}} planned by the Justice and Development Party (AKP) government when they proposed to reduce the parliamentary terms from five years to four in the 2007 constitutional referendum, are still ongoing. Speculation as to what the AKP government will do during four years of electorally unchecked power should they win generated both favourable predictions and concerns. While four years without elections may allow the government to undertake widespread necessary economic reforms, critics of the AKP argue that it is an opportunity to further erode the diminishing checks and balances and separation of powers in the Turkish political and legal systems. The AKP also support a presidential system, which would give greater powers to President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.|$|E

25|$|Reagan won 53% of {{the vote}} in {{reliably}} Democratic South Boston. His electoral college victory of 489 electoral votes (90.9% of the electoral vote) was the most lopsided electoral college victory for a first-time President-elect. Although Reagan was to win an even greater Electoral College majority in 1984, the 1980 election nonetheless stands as the last time some currently very strong Democratic counties gave a Republican majority or plurality. Notable examples are Jefferson County in Washington State, Lane County, Oregon, Marin and Santa Cruz Counties in California, McKinley County, New Mexico, Polk County, Iowa and Rock Island County, Illinois. Conversely, this was the last time that the Democrats won Georgia and Maryland until 1992. <b>This</b> <b>election</b> <b>is</b> the last time a Republican won the presidency without winning Georgia. This is the first time Massachusetts voted for the Republican candidate since 1956. 1980 is one of only two occurrences of a pair of consecutive elections seeing the incumbent President defeated, the other one happening in 1892. This is the only time in the 20th century a party was voted out after a single four-year term.|$|E

[...] Addressing the racial dust-up and the other campaign back-and-forths between himself and the Clintons, he said, [...] "The choice in <b>this</b> <b>election</b> <b>is</b> not between regions or religions or genders.

[...] When asked by Ryan Tubridy if she would refuse to sign any bill threatening , she responded by saying, [...] "You bet your boots I would".

2500|$|On July 14–15, rigged, extraordinary, single-party {{parliamentary}} elections were held, in which voters {{were presented with}} a single list of pro-Communist candidates. The goal of occupation authorities was to maximize turnout to legitimize the new system, which included stamping passports in voting facilities for future identification of voting, along with a threat running in the main Communist paper, the Rahva Hääl, that [...] "It would be extremely unwise to shirk elections.... Only people's enemies stay at home on election day." [...] Each ballot carried only the Soviet-assigned candidate's name, with {{the only way to}} register opposition being to strike out that name on the ballot. According to official election results, the Communist [...] "Union of the Estonian Working People" [...] bloc won 92.8% of the votes with 84.1% of the population attending the elections. Time magazine reported that, following the elections, tribunals were set up to judge and punish [...] "traitors to the people", which included opponents of Sovietization {{and those who did not}} vote for incorporation in the Soviet Union. [...] <b>This</b> <b>election</b> <b>is</b> considered illegal, since the amended electoral law—along with hundreds of other laws passed by the Vares government—had not been approved by the upper house of parliament, as required by the Estonian constitution.

As a rule there is not even an attempt made to put forward evidence in substantiation of anything that is alleged. Wild and sweeping statement takes the place that should be held by calm deduction and reasoned comment.|$|E
