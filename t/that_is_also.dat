5|$|A male {{sea otter}} {{is most likely}} to mate if he {{maintains}} a breeding territory in an area <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> favored by females. As autumn is the peak breeding season in most areas, males typically defend their territory only from spring to autumn. During this time, males patrol the boundaries of their territories to exclude other males, although actual fighting is rare. Adult females move freely between male territories, where they outnumber adult males by an average of five to one. Males that do not have territories tend to congregate in large, male-only groups, and swim through female areas when searching for a mate.|$|E

5|$|Human {{cultures}} have developed many {{views of the}} planet. Earth is sometimes personified as a deity.

5|$|The highest known {{ruthenium}} halide is the hexafluoride, a {{dark brown}} solid that melts at 54°C. It hydrolyzes violently upon contact {{with water and}} easily disproportionates to form a mixture of lower ruthenium fluorides, releasing fluorine gas. Ruthenium pentafluoride is a tetrameric dark green solid <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> readily hydrolyzed, melting at 86.5°C. The yellow ruthenium tetrafluoride is probably also polymeric and can be formed by reducing the pentafluoride with iodine. Among the binary compounds of ruthenium, these high oxidation states are known only in the oxides and fluorides.|$|E
5|$|The time-reversed {{dynamics}} of the automaton can be described by another cellular automaton. Clearly, {{for this to be}} possible, the update rule must be bijective. In the other direction, if the update rule is bijective, then it has an inverse function <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> bijective. This inverse function must be a cellular automaton rule. The proof of this fact uses the Curtis–Hedlund–Lyndon theorem, a topological characterization of cellular automata rules as the translation-invariant functions that are continuous with respect to the Cantor topology on the space of configurations.|$|E

5|$|By tabulating {{the number}} of {{specimens}} of each age group, Erickson and his colleagues were able to draw conclusions about life history in tyranosauridae populations. Their analysis showed that while juveniles were rare in the fossil record, subadults in the rapid growth phase and adults were far more common. Over half of the known T. rex specimens appear to have died within six years of reaching sexual maturity, a pattern <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> seen in other tyrannosaurs and in some large, long-lived birds and mammals today. These species are characterized by high infant mortality rates, followed by relatively low mortality among juveniles. Mortality increases again following sexual maturity, {{partly due to the}} stresses of reproduction. While this could be due to preservation or collection biases, Erickson hypothesized that the difference was due to low mortality among juveniles over a certain size, which is also seen in some modern large mammals, like elephants. This low mortality may have resulted from a lack of predation, since tyrannosaurs surpassed all contemporaneous predators in size by the age of two. Paleontologists have not found enough Daspletosaurus remains for a similar analysis, but Erickson notes that the same general trend seems to apply.|$|E
5|$|During its time, the West Coast Express {{was widely}} {{considered}} one of the most dominant line combinations in the league. The mid-nineties witnessed the increased popularity of defensive schemes like the neutral zone trap which slowed the game, limiting scoring and offensive chances. The emphasis on defensive has been blamed for diminishing fan interest. When Naslund was traded to Vancouver in 1996 the Canucks often played in a half empty arena and there were rumors about the franchise moving. The line's offense first style helped to popularize the franchise. They began to sell out home games on a regular basis and started to have a following on the road. In the 2002–03 season the Canucks 264 goals was the highest total for the franchise in nine years. It remained unsurpassed by another Canucks team until the 2009–10 team, which featured the NHL's leading scorer, Henrik Sedin. The franchise record for points they set that same season stood for only two seasons until it was surpassed in 2006–07 season. During which Roberto Luongo set a franchise record for goaltender wins with 47, a single season win total <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> tied for second most all-time in NHL history.|$|E
5|$|Female {{individuals}} of Laevistrombus canarium are generally larger (both shell and soft parts) than male individuals, {{which is also}} the case in other strombid gastropods such as the spider conch (Harpago chiragra) and queen conch (Lobatus gigas). The external anatomy of the soft parts of this species {{is similar to that of}} the other members of the family: the animal has a long extensible snout and thin eyestalks (also known as ommatophores), with well-developed lens eyes at the tips. Each eyestalk has a small sensory tentacle branching off near the end. The large foot of the animal is narrow and strong, able to perform the leaping form of locomotion <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> found in other species of Strombidae (such as the queen conch).|$|E

5|$|It is {{constructed}} in a verse-pre-chorus-chorus form, with a bridge before {{the third and}} fourth chorus. It starts with an instrumental introduction, and uses a chord progression of C–B–Am7–G, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> used during the verses and the chorus. In the first verse, Halliwell, Chisholm, Bunton, and Beckham sing each one line. The chords change to Dm11–Dm9–Dm11–Dm9–Dm7–Em7–F major7–G during the pre-chorus, followed by the chorus. The same pattern occurs leading to the second chorus, {{the first part of the}} second verse consists on the repeated use of the words do and ba da, then Bunton and Chisholm sing the rest of the verse. The group then sing the bridge, and end the song repeating the chorus twice. The song uses the verse melody of When You Were Mine (Prince song) with slightly altered phrasing.|$|E
5|$|Located {{close to}} Polaris is Lambda Ursae Minoris, a red giant of {{spectral}} type M1III. It is a semiregular variable varying from magnitudes 6.35 to 6.45. The northerly {{nature of the}} constellation means that the variable stars can be observed all year: the red giant R Ursae Minoris is a semiregular variable varying from magnitude 8.5 to 11.5 over 328days, while S Ursae Minoris is a long period variable that ranges between magnitudes 8.0 and 11 over 331days. Located south of Kochab and Pherkad towards Draco is RR Ursae Minoris, a red giant of spectral type M5III <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> a semiregular variable ranging from magnitude 4.44 to 4.85 {{over a period of}} 43.3days. T Ursae Minoris is another red giant variable star that has undergone a dramatic change in status—from being a long period (Mira) variable ranging from magnitude 7.8 to 15 over 310–315 days to a semiregular variable. The star is thought to have undergone a shell helium flash—a point where the shell of helium around the star's core reaches a critical mass and ignites—marked by its abrupt change in variability in 1979. Z Ursae Minoris is a faint variable star that suddenly dropped 6magnitudes in 1992 and was identified as one of a rare class of stars—R Coronae Borealis variables.|$|E
5|$|Located on the {{property}} of Ambler's Texaco Gas Station, {{just north of the}} station, is a 24-foot (7.3 m) by 16 foot (4.9m) wood clad, wooden frame building that once housed a commercial icehouse. Though its exact dates of operation are unknown, it is believed the icehouse was established by a member of Jack Schore's family during the 1930s. While the icehouse was in business, there was a small pond located about 200feet (61m) east of {{the property}}. Operators cut ice from the pond and stored it in the building until sale. After the icehouse ceased operation, a date <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>also</b> unknown, the building was used as a storage shed for the gas station. The building features a double wall with sawdust stuffed in between the walls to provide insulation. The wooden roof has asphalt shingles. Ambler's Texaco Station listing on the National Register lists the icehouse building as a contributing property.|$|E

He has proven himself an unselfish player, averaging 6.1 assists per game throughout his career. After winning the NBA Finals MVP Award in 2006, Wade developed a reputation as one of the premier clutch players in the NBA. He has gained a reputation for being capable of hitting game-winning baskets and potential game-winning free throws.|$|E
