40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the utility of}} opposed-phase magnetic resonance imaging (OP MRI) in differentiating malignant from benign bone lesions. Materials and methods: MRI scans of musculoskeletal lesions including opposed-phase imaging sequences were reviewed by both an experienced musculoskeletal attending radiologist, and a second year radiology resident. The change in signal from IP to OP images was measured. The reviewers' evaluation of the lesions based on T 1 and T 2 -weighted images was compared to their evaluation with inclusion of the OP sequences. Results: Twenty-seven lesions in bone were analyzed: 4 malignant primary bone lesions, 3 malignant soft tissue lesions to bone, 3 metastases from visceral malignancies, and 17 benign bone lesions. Benign lesions of bone dropped in signal on OP imaging {{by an average of}} 37. 1 %. Five of the benign lesions decreased in signal by less than 20 %, and two increased. Malignant bone lesions dropped in signal by an average of 0. 69 % with one of the ten lesions showing a greater than 20 % drop. When OP sequences were included, concern for malignancy decreased in benign lesions and increased in malignant lesions, <b>for</b> <b>both</b> the resident and attending. Compared with standard MRI, inclusion of these sequences increased the overall confidence in diagnosis <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>reviewers.</b> Conclusion: Opposed-phase imaging is helpful in differentiating benign from malignant lesions in bone.

Peer review {{can be a}} way to open up new {{possibilities}} <b>for</b> <b>both</b> writer and <b>reviewer.</b> Peer review is increasingly conducted in writing classes since the prevalence of communicative approach in recent years, and it has been proved as an effective approach to improve the writing skill (Corbin, 2012), to increase motivation to writing, and to learn how to treat writing as a collaborative social activity. The present article illustrates the practicalities {{to improve the quality of}} peer review sessions. Peer review is meant to complement teacher feedback rather than to replace it. With appropriate training, guidance and practice, students can learn to be more specific and helpful in their responses to a peer's script. Identifying and practicing the skills required for peer review, by providing the atmosphere of trust and mutual respect, limiting the role of peer reviewer to that of a reader and leaving the freedom of modifying the suggestion to the writer would improve the quality of peer review.

40|$|Purpose The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} impact of 3 -dimensional cranial ultrasonography (3 DUS) on reinterpretation of cranial ultrasonography images in neonates in comparison with 2 -dimensional cranial ultrasonography (2 DUS). Methods We retrospectively enrolled 50 young infants who simultaneously underwent both 2 DUS and 3 DUS scanning from February to March 2015. Two pediatric radiologists independently reviewed <b>both</b> scans <b>for</b> overall image quality on a 5 -point scale. Five features were evaluated in both scans: the presence of germinal matrix hemorrhage (GMH), intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), ventriculomegaly (VM), abnormality of periventricular echogenicity (PVE), and focal parenchymal lesions (FL). The concordance rate between the two scanning modes was calculated. The confidence level for each finding on a 3 -point scale and the scanning time were compared between the two scanning modes. Interobserver agreement was evaluated using kappa statistics. Results Both scans demonstrated similar overall image quality in terms of reinterpretation (mean scores for 2 DUS and 3 DUS, 4. 0 ± 0. 5 and 4. 0 ± 0. 7 in reviewer 1, 3. 9 ± 0. 6 and 4. 0 ± 0. 8 in reviewer 2, respectively). GMH, IVH, VM, and FL showed perfect concordance, while PVE showed a concordance rate of 91. 4 % between the two modes by <b>both</b> <b>reviewers.</b> 3 DUS was associated with a higher diagnostic confidence in the evaluation of GMH, IVH, and FL than 2 DUS (P< 0. 05) <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>reviewers.</b> <b>For</b> PVE, 3 DUS received a significantly higher confidence score than 2 DUS from one of the reviewers. The mean scanning time for 2 DUS and 3 DUS was 92. 75 seconds and 36 seconds, respectively. Interobserver agreement for qualitative scoring was almost perfect. Conclusion In reinterpretation, 3 DUS showed very high concordance with 2 DUS and a similar image quality. 3 DUS also increased diagnostic confidence for several image findings and significantly decreased scan time...|$|R

Methods: An international multidisciplinary (neurosurgery, neuroradiology, neurology, clinical epidemiology) group of 69 specialists was convened to develop and validate the UIATS model using a Delphi consensus. For internal (39 panel members involved in identification of relevant features) and external validation (30 independent external reviewers), 30 selected UIA cases were used to analyze agreement with UIATS management recommendations based on a 5 -point Likert scale (5 indicating strong agreement). Interrater agreement (IRA) was assessed with standardized coefficients of dispersion (v r) (v r 0 indicating excellent agreement and v r 1 indicating poor agreement). Results: The UIATS accounts for 29 key factors in UIA management. Agreement with UIATS (mean Likert scores) was 4. 2 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 4. 1 - 4. 3) per <b>reviewer</b> <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>reviewer</b> cohorts; agreement per case was 4. 3 (95 % CI 4. 1 - 4. 4) for panel members and 4. 5 (95 % CI 4. 3 - 4. 6) for external reviewers (p 0. 017). Mean Likert scores were 4. 2 (95 % CI 4. 1 - 4. 3) for interventional reviewers (n 56) and 4. 1 (95 % CI 3. 9 - 4. 4) for noninterventional reviewers (n 12) (p 0. 290).

40|$|Magnetic {{resonance}} (MR) arthrography {{is generally}} regarded as {{the gold standard for}} shoulder imaging. As an alternative to direct MR arthrography, the less invasive indirect MR arthrography technique was proposed, offering logistic advantages because fluoroscopic or ultrasonographic guidance for joint injection is not required. To assess the diagnostic performance of indirect MR arthrography in the diagnosis of full- and partial-thickness supraspinatus tears in a symptomatic population. Two radiologists with different levels of experience independently and retrospectively interpreted indirect MR (1. 5 T) arthrograms of the shoulder obtained in 67 symptomatic patients who underwent subsequent arthroscopy. On MR, the supraspinatus tendon was evaluated for full- or partial-thickness tear. With arthroscopy as the standard of reference, sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy of indirect MR arthrography in the detection of full- and partial-thickness tears of the supraspinatus tendon was calculated. Kappa (kappa) statistics were used for the assessment of the agreement between arthroscopic and imaging findings and for the assessment of interobserver agreement. For full-thickness tears of the supraspinatus tendon, sensitivities, specificities, and accuracies exceeded 90 % <b>for</b> <b>both</b> observers, with excellent interobserver agreement (kappa = 0. 910). For partial-thickness tears, sensitivities (38 - 50 %) and accuracies (76 - 78 %) were poor <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>reviewers,</b> and interobserver agreement was moderate (kappa = 0. 491). Discrepancies between MR diagnosis and arthroscopy were predominantly observed with small partial-thickness tears. Indirect MR arthrography is highly accurate in the diagnosis of full-thickness rotator cuff tears. However, the diagnosis of partial-thickness tears with indirect MR arthrography remains faulty, because exact demarcation of degenerative change and partial rupture is difficult. On the basis of the above findings, we do not recommend indirect MR arthrography on patients for whom rotator cuff disease is suspected clinicall...|$|R
