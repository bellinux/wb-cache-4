25|$|The {{northern}} route {{begins at}} <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>area</b> along Malden Avenue in Palenville, just off New York State Route 23A.

The trail switches back {{at the top of a}} small rise and begins to descend slightly to the two streams at the base of Hillyer Ravine.|$|E
25|$|Secunderabad Railway Station is {{the first}} railway station to be {{installed}} with an automated parking system.

This allows the vehicle access to <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>area.</b> A manual pay station has been set up at the exit point.|$|E
25|$|By 1950 {{the depot}} had {{changed its name}} to Clapton to avoid {{confusion}} with the nearby Well Street garage (H) prior to being converted for motorbus operation.

Over the years the garage has seen various types allocated including RT, RM, DMS, M and Ts, but in 1987 with just a few MCW Metrobuses and AEC Routemasters remaining the garage was closed with the remaining work transferred to the newer Ash Grove bus garage.|$|E

25|$|The dual-carriage Grand Trunk Road {{takes you}} past Gujar Khan and Sohawa, {{to the small}} town of Dina 130km away.

After about 100 meters to your left you will find a signpost, which {{indicates}} the way towards the road leading to Rohtas Fort which is 8km away, past the small holy village of Muftian home to the Mufti Tribe.

25|$|In {{the early}} morning of 16 March, over 5,000 {{security}} forces backed by tanks and helicopters stormed the Pearl Roundabout, where protesters had camped for about a month. The number of protesters was much lower than that in previous days due to many of them returning to villages to protect their homes. Intimidated {{by the amount of}} security forces, most protesters retreated from the location, while others decided to stay and were violently cleared within two hours. Then, security forces cleared road blockades and the financial harbor, and moved to take control over Salmaniya hospital. They entered the hospital building with their sticks, shields, handguns and assault rifles after clearing <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>area,</b> and treated it as a crime scene.|$|E
25|$|The reverse parking {{procedure}} is virtually {{identical to the}} parallel parking procedure. The driver approaches the parking space, moving forward and turning, positioning the car in place for backing into the reverse parking spot. The vehicle rear has to be facing the reverse parking spot, allowing the backup camera to 'see' <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>area.</b> Shifting to reverse automatically activates the backup camera system, and the driver selects the reverse park guidance button on the navigation/camera touchscreen (the grid appears with green or red lines, a flag symbol representing {{the corner of the}} parking spot, and adjustment arrows; reverse parking adds rotation selection). After checking the parking space and engaging the reverse park procedure, the same exact parking process occurs as the car reverse parks into the spot.|$|E

25|$|Hoover {{was best}} known for his civil air show career, which started when he was hired to {{demonstrate}} the capabilities of Aero Commander's Shrike Commander, a twin piston-engined business aircraft that had developed a staid reputation due to its bulky shape. Hoover showed the strength of the plane as he put the aircraft through rolls, loops, and other maneuvers, which most people would not associate with executive aircraft. As a grand finale, he shut down both engines and executed a loop and an eight-point hesitation slow roll as he headed back to the runway. Upon landing he would touch down on one tire followed gradually by the other. After pulling off the runway, he would start his engines to taxi back to <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>area.</b> On airfields with large enough parking ramps (such as the Reno Stead Airport, where the Reno Air Races take place), Hoover would sometimes land directly on the ramp and coast {{all the way back to}} his parking spot in front of the grandstand without restarting the engines. He was also known for creating the stunt of successfully pouring a cup of tea while performing a 1G barrel roll.|$|E
25|$|Finally on 28 November 1944, {{an accord}} was signed between the US and Portuguese governments, that envisioned its {{use as a}} {{waypoint}} for planes travelling to the Pacific theatre of operations, or those {{that needed to be}} diverted due to weather conditions. This was followed on 14 December 1944 by a similar accord between Pan American Airways and the Portuguese government, resulting in the installation of new radio equipment. Work on the passenger terminal and support buildings had already progressed, along with runways 2 and 3 and <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>area.</b> At this time there were 3000 workers onsite: 2000 American, 600 Micaleanse and 400 Marienses, a number that continued to grow over time (eventually reaching 3000 Americans and 1000 Azoreans). Meanwhile, the port was expanded to receive battalions with the equipment necessary to improve the infrastructures and to construct a network to pipe aviation fuel to the plateau. These included: airport infrastructures; roadways; water supply and sewage; residences; and social spaces (such as hotel, gymnasium, church, a cinema/theatre to hold 1000 people, and a hospital in the area of Santana, to evacuate the injured in the European theatre).|$|E

500|$|In 2009 and 2010, the Tea Party {{movement}} held protests {{along the}} Gardiner {{section of the}} trail. In November 2009, New Paltz received grants from the Greenway Conservancy, a state organization, to fund several rail trailâ€“related projects. This included $17,750 to create {{a link between the}} New Paltz section of the trail and the Hudson Valley Rail Trail in nearby Lloyd, which was in turn being extended eastward to the Poughkeepsie Bridge; the connection with the bridge was completed in October 2010. The Wallkill Valley Railroad had considered such a connection after the bridge opened in 1889, but never built one. The grants also included $7,000 to create [...] of ADA-accessible trail, to connect <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>area</b> of a local park, named after Sojourner Truth, with the rail trail. The town had intended to connect <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> <b>area</b> with the trail since the late 1990s, but concerns over traffic, as well as state requirements, had added to the time and cost of the path; it was completed by June 2010. The connections are part of a county-wide plan to create a bicycle path along NY 299, to link regional rail trails.|$|E
