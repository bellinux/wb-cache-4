5|$|The {{pilot in}} command was 53-year-old Captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah from Penang. He joined Malaysia Airlines as a cadet pilot in 1981 and, after {{training}} and receiving his commercial pilot's licence, became a Second Officer with the airline in 1983. Zaharie was promoted to Captain of Boeing 737-400 in 1991, Captain of Airbus A330-300 in 1996, and to Captain of Boeing 777-200 in 1998. He had been a <b>Type</b> <b>Rating</b> Instructor and <b>Type</b> <b>Rating</b> Examiner since 2007 and had 18,365 hours of flying experience.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{shares a}} common <b>type</b> <b>rating</b> {{with all other}} Airbus A320 family variants, allowing existing A320 family pilots to fly the aircraft {{without the need for}} further training. It is the largest commercial aircraft certified by the European Aviation Safety Agency for steep approach operations, allowing flights at airports such as London City.|$|E
5|$|Besides common {{avionics}} {{and computer}} systems, the 757 shares its auxiliary power unit, electric power systems, flight deck, and hydraulic parts with the 767. Through operational commonality, 757 pilots can obtain a common <b>type</b> <b>rating</b> {{to fly the}} 767 and share the same seniority roster with pilots of either aircraft. This reduces costs for airlines that operate both twinjets.|$|E
5000|$|Typical 'customers' include, but are {{not limited}} to, 'low timers' (inexperienced pilots) and low-hour <b>type</b> <b>rated</b> pilots [...] (e.g. B737 <b>type</b> <b>rated</b> -or qualified-, A320 <b>type</b> <b>rated</b> etc...) that pay to work to build hours and improve their odds at finding an {{employment}} as airline pilots, thus challenging the 'pilot shortage' mainstream consensus.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to shared avionics and computer technology, the 767 {{uses the same}} auxiliary power unit, electric power systems, and hydraulic parts as the 757. A raised cockpit floor and the same forward cockpit windows result in similar pilot viewing angles. Related design and functionality allows 767 pilots to obtain a common <b>type</b> <b>rating</b> to operate the 757 and share the same seniority roster with pilots of either aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In late 2011, the FAA {{assigned}} a common <b>type</b> <b>rating</b> to the 787 and 777, allowing pilots qualified on either aircraft to operate both models, due to related design features. The smaller 787 {{was the first}} stage of a replacement aircraft initiative called the Boeing Yellowstone Project. Reportedly, the 777 could eventually be replaced by a new aircraft family, Yellowstone 3, which would draw upon technologies from the 787.|$|E
5|$|The 777 {{ranks as}} one of Boeing's best-selling models. Airlines have {{acquired}} the type as a comparatively fuel-efficient alternative to other wide-body jets and have increasingly deployed the aircraft on long-haul transoceanic routes. Direct market competitors include the Airbus A330-300, the Airbus A350 XWB, and the out-of-production A340 and McDonnell Douglas MD-11. The 787 Dreamliner, which entered service in 2011, shares design features and a common <b>type</b> <b>rating</b> for pilots with the 777. In November 2013, Boeing announced the development of upgraded 777-8 and 777-9 variants, collectively named 777X, featuring composite wings and GE9X engines and further technologies developed for the 787. The new 777X series is planned to enter service by 2020.|$|E

5|$|The Boeing 767 is a mid- to large-size, mid- to long-range, {{wide-body}} twin-engine jet airliner {{built by}} Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It was Boeing's first wide-body twinjet and its first airliner with a two-crew glass cockpit. The aircraft has two turbofan engines, a conventional tail, and, for reduced aerodynamic drag, a supercritical wing design. Designed as a smaller wide-body airliner than earlier aircraft {{such as the}} 747, the 767 has seating capacity for 181 to 375 people, and a design range of , depending on variant. Development of the 767 occurred in tandem with a narrow-body twinjet, the 757, resulting in shared design features which allow pilots to obtain a common <b>type</b> <b>rating</b> to operate both aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The {{baseline}} A320 {{has given}} rise to a family of aircraft which share a common design but with passenger capacity ranges from 100, on the A318, to 220, on the A321. They compete with the 737, 757, and 717. Because the four variants share the same flight deck, all have the same pilot <b>type</b> <b>rating.</b> Today all variants are available as corporate jets. An A319 variant known as A319LR is also developed. Military version like A319 MPA also exists. American Airlines is the world's largest airline operator of the A320 family of aircraft with 392 aircraft in service as of 30 September 2017.|$|E
5|$|The Boeing 757 is a mid-size, narrow-body {{twin-engine}} jet airliner {{that was}} designed and built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It is the manufacturer's largest single-aisle passenger aircraft and was produced from 1981 to 2004. The twinjet has a two-crew member glass cockpit, turbofan engines of sufficient power to allow takeoffs from relatively short runways and higher altitudes, a conventional tail and, for reduced aerodynamic drag, a supercritical wing design. Intended to replace the smaller three-engine 727 on short and medium routes, the 757 can carry 200 to 295 passengers for a maximum of , depending on variant. The 757 was designed concurrently with a wide-body twinjet, the 767, and owing to shared features pilots can obtain a common <b>type</b> <b>rating</b> {{that allows them to}} operate both aircraft.|$|E

30|$|According to the {{empirical}} results (Tables  6, 7, 8), the prediction {{accuracy of the}} LASSO–NN model is 88.96  % (<b>Type</b> I error <b>rate</b> is 12.22  %; <b>Type</b> II error <b>rate</b> is 7.50  %), the prediction accuracy of the LASSO–CART model is 88.75  % (<b>Type</b> I error <b>rate</b> is 13.61  %; <b>Type</b> II error <b>rate</b> is 14.17  %), and the prediction accuracy of the LASSO–SVM model is 89.79  % (<b>Type</b> I error <b>rate</b> is 10.00  %; <b>Type</b> II error <b>rate</b> is 15.83  %). Our comparison follows that of Kirkos et al. (2007 a, b), Tasi and Huang (2010) and Chen et al. (2014).

40|$|An {{experienced}} user of the Twiddler, a one [...] handed chording keyboard, averages {{speeds of}} 60 {{words per minute}} with letter [...] by [...] letter typing of standard test phrases. This fast <b>typing</b> <b>rate</b> coupled with the Twiddler's 3 x 4 button design, {{similar to that of}} a standard mobile telephone, makes it a potential alternative to multi [...] tap for text entry on mobile phones. Despite this similarity, there is very little data on the Twiddler 's performance and learnability. We present a longitudinal study of novice users' learning rates on the Twiddler. Ten participants typed for 20 sessions using two different methods. Each session is composed of 20 minutes of typing with multi [...] tap and 20 minutes of one [...] handed chording on the Twiddler. We found that users initially have a faster average <b>typing</b> <b>rate</b> with multi [...] tap; however, after four sessions the difference becomes negligible, and by the eighth session participants type faster with chording on the Twiddler. Furthermore, after 20 sessions <b>typing</b> <b>rates</b> for the Twiddler are still increasing...|$|R
25|$|Some {{aircraft}} {{are covered by}} a blanket <b>type</b> <b>rating</b> which is applicable to a grouping of aircraft types. For example, the aeroplanes blanket <b>type</b> <b>rating</b> covers all non-high performance, single engine aeroplanes that have a minimum flight crew requirement of one pilot. Examples {{of this type of}} {{aircraft are}} the Cessna 172 and the Piper Cherokee. These are considered similar enough that specific ratings are not required for each type.|$|E
