5|$|Large {{fish are}} caught with the bill-tip, then tossed {{up in the}} air <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> and slid into the gullet head-first. A gull will {{sometimes}} stand on the pelican's head, peck it to distraction, and grab a fish from the open bill. Pelicans in their turn sometimes snatch prey from other waterbirds.|$|E

5|$|French Admiral Pierre André de Suffren with a {{fleet of}} fifteen ships sailed from Trincomalee to support the besieged city on 10June. Arriving on 13June, the French found the British {{reluctant}} to fight, moving away and anchoring some five miles off. As {{the success of the}} siege would probably be decided by naval action, 1200 troops were embarked onto Suffren's ships to increase his gunnery complement. Having been frustrated by contrary winds, the French fleet was able to close with the British ships on 17June. Hughes, not wishing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> at anchor, weighed, and the two fleets began manoeuvring for advantage.|$|E
5|$|I don't see {{the point}} of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be {{impossible}} for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music. We're not afraid to experiment, or <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> with our pants down, so to speak. That's what keeps us going.|$|E
5|$|Morris found batting {{difficult}} {{for the first few}} weeks of the tour, as he struggled to adapt to the unfamiliar batting conditions. He reached 50 only twice in the nine innings after the Worcestershire match, totalling only 223 runs at 24.77; Morris sometimes attempted to drive balls pitched just short of a good length, and if they reared suddenly, he was liable <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>caught.</b> Morris was worried about edging the ball to the slips cordon and had become fidgety and shuffled across the crease.|$|E

He was buried {{with the rest of his}} family in Tondol, while his cousin Tandibua' became the native rule of Pangala', serving under the Dutch.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises {{are highly}} {{affected}} by bycatch. Many porpoises, mainly the vaquita, {{are subject to}} great mortality due to gillnetting. Although it is the world's most endangered marine cetacean, the vaquita continues <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> in small-mesh gillnet fisheries throughout much of its range. Incidental mortality caused by the fleet of El Golfo de Santa Clara {{was estimated to be}} at around 39 vaquitas per year, which is over 17% of the population size. Harbour porpoises also suffer drowning by gillnetting, but on a less threatening scale due to their high population; their mortality rate per year increases a mere 5% due to this.|$|E
5|$|The Earth's {{magnetic}} field serves to deflect {{most of the}} solar wind, whose charged particles would otherwise strip away the ozone layer that protects the Earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation. One stripping mechanism is for gas <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> in bubbles of {{magnetic field}}, which are ripped off by solar winds. Calculations {{of the loss of}} carbon dioxide from the atmosphere of Mars, resulting from scavenging of ions by the solar wind, indicate that the dissipation of the magnetic field of Mars caused a near total loss of its atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|Though little {{specific}} data are available, the Japanese sleeper ray is believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> incidentally in shrimp trawls and other demersal fishing gear throughout its range. It is not utilized economically; however, electric rays {{tend not to}} survive being caught and discarded, and shrimp trawling {{is known to have}} caused marked population declines in other electric ray species elsewhere. Given the high intensity of fishing activity off East Asia, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed this species as Vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|Yonekura {{and his men}} {{had reached}} Kaiapit after an {{exhausting}} night march. Yonekura was aware that the Australians had reached Kaiapit but his main concern was not <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> in the open by Allied aircraft. Spotting Australian positions in the pre-dawn light, the Japanese column opened fire. A torrent of fire descended on the Australians, who replied sporadically, attempting to conserve their ammunition. Although he was running low on ammunition, King launched an immediate counter-attack on the Japanese, which took them by surprise.|$|E
5|$|Bodyline was {{a tactic}} devised for and {{primarily}} {{used in the}} Ashes series between England and Australia in 1932—33. The tactic involved bowling at leg stump or just outside it, pitching the ball short so that it reared at {{the body of a}} batsman stood in an orthodox batting position. A ring of fielders ranged on the leg side would catch any defensive deflections from the bat. The batsman's options were to evade the ball through ducking or moving aside, allow the ball to strike their body or play the ball with his bat. The latter course carried additional risks. Defensive shots brought few runs and could carry far enough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> by the fielders on the leg side; pull and hook shots could be caught {{on the edge of the}} field where two men were usually placed for such a shot.|$|E

5|$|Following the German {{invasion}} of Poland, Hergé was conscripted into the Belgian Army and temporarily stationed in Herenthout. Discharged within the month, {{he returned to}} Brussels and began Land of Black Gold. The story subsequently began serialisation in Le Vingtième Siècle on 25 September 1939. He was re-mobilised in December and stationed in Antwerp, from where he continued to send the Tintin strip to Le Petit Vingtième. However, he fell ill with sinusitis and boils and was declared unfit for service in May 1940. That same day, Germany invaded Belgium, and Le Vingtième Siècle was shut down part way through the serialisation of Land of Black Gold, on 8 May. The {{point at which the}} story was ended corresponds to page 30 of the current book edition, when Tintin is about <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> in a sandstorm following his first confrontation with Muller.|$|E
5|$|In the game's introduction, {{the ghost}} of Garamon haunts the Avatar's dreams with {{warnings}} of a great danger in Britannia. The Avatar allows Garamon to take him there, where he watches Tyball kidnap Arial. Tyball escapes, leaving the Avatar <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> by the Baron's guards. The guards {{take him to the}} Baron, who banishes him to the Great Stygian Abyss to rescue Arial. After the introduction, the Avatar explores the dungeon and finds remnants of Cabirus's colony. A few possible scenarios include deciding the fate of two warring goblin tribes, learning a language, and playing an instrument to complete a quest. The Avatar eventually defeats Tyball and frees Arial.|$|E
5|$|Morris {{marked his}} {{first-class}} debut on English soil with a fluent 138 against Worcestershire, which was scored in only {{four hours and}} made him the first Australian centurion on tour. Morris found batting difficult {{for the first few}} weeks as he adapted to the alien batting conditions, reaching 50 only twice in his next nine innings with a total of 223 runs at 24.77; Morris sometimes attempted to drive balls pitched just short of a good length, and if they reared suddenly he was liable <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>caught.</b> Morris was worried about edging the ball to the slips cordon and had become fidgety and shuffled across the crease. He rectified this, and success followed with 184 against Sussex in the final match before the First Test. Five more centuries {{before the end of the}} season.|$|E

5|$|On {{the evening}} of 9 July, the II SS-Panzer Corps was ordered to shift its own forward progress, from due north to the northeast, toward the {{settlement}} of Prokhorovka. Hoth had formulated this move, and had discussed it with Manstein since early May, as he expected large Soviet armoured reserve forces to arrive from the east, {{and he did not}} want his corps <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> crossing the Psel River when they arrived. The plan originally envisioned elements of XLVIII Panzer Corps and III Panzer Corps joining in the attack toward Prokhorovka, but this could not be realised. The Soviet command, however, interpreted the change in direction to be a response to the heavy resistance the German forces had faced driving toward Oboyan, and incorrectly believed the change indicated the German panzer forces had been severely weakened.|$|E
5|$|Only a few shark {{attacks of}} {{uncertain}} provenance {{have been attributed}} to the porbeagle. It is well regarded as a game fish by recreational anglers. The meat and fins of the porbeagle are highly valued, which has led to a long history of intense human exploitation. However, this species cannot sustain heavy fishing pressure due to its low reproductive capacity. Direct commercial fishing for the porbeagle, principally by Norwegian longliners, led to stock collapses in the eastern North Atlantic in the 1950s, and the western North Atlantic in the 1960s. The porbeagle continues <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> throughout its range, both intentionally and as bycatch, with varying degrees of monitoring and management. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed the porbeagle as Vulnerable worldwide, and as either Endangered or Critically Endangered in different parts of its northern range.|$|E
5|$|The All Blacks' first-half {{play was}} {{generally}} considered poor—with aimless kicking to Welsh fullback Winfield who returned much better kicks into touch. The first ten minutes saw New Zealand's Roberts break the line twice only, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>caught</b> by Winfield without support. Eventually Wales had a scrum-feed 25 yards {{out from the}} All Blacks' try-line. From this Wales executed a planned move—Owen got the Wales scrum-ball and dummied on his right to Bush. He then turned left and passed to Cliff Pritchard. Pritchard then passed to Gabe, who passed to Bush, who eventually passed to Morgan. Morgan then raced 25 yards down the touchline, eluding Gillett, to score for Wales. Winfield missed the resulting conversion—leaving the score at 3–0. In {{the final stages of}} the first half the All Blacks began to assert themselves and were attacking strongly when half-time was sounded. Dixon claimed half-time was called two minutes early, and Wallace that it was three minutes early.|$|E
