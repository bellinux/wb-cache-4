25|$|None of this, apparently, was enough. Sage {{wrote in}} a journal in August 1961, “I have said all that I have <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>There</b> <b>is</b> nothing left {{for me to do}} but scream.” On January 8, 1963, she put a fatal bullet through her heart.

He said Skin Trade [...] "fails" [...] to satisfy even the [...] "qualified expectations" [...] that someone brings to a [...] "low-rent Dolph Lundgren ass-kicker". Bowen went on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> [...] "no beauty to this film, little rhythm", {{and none of the}} [...] "physical grace" [...] that action-film fans [...] "crave".|$|E

500|$|On September 4, 2014, a 14-year-old girl in Port Richey, Florida, {{allegedly}} set her family's {{house on}} fire {{while her mother}} and nine-year-old brother were inside. Police reported that the teenager had been reading online stories about Slender Man as well as Atsushi Ōkubo's manga Soul Eater. Eddie Daniels of the Pasco County Sheriff's Office said the girl [...] "had visited the website that contains {{a lot of the}} Slender Man information and stories [...] It would be safe <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a connection to that." ...|$|E
500|$|After the Liberal {{losses in}} the 1910 elections, ILP member and {{journalist}} Henry Brailsford helped organise a Conciliation Committee for Women's Suffrage, which gathered 54 MPs from various parties. The group's Conciliation Bill {{looked to be a}} narrowly defined but still significant possibility to achieve the vote for women. Thus the WSPU agreed to suspend its support for window-breaking and hunger strikes while it was being negotiated. When {{it became clear that the}} bill would not pass, Pankhurst declared: [...] "If the Bill, in spite of our efforts, is killed by the Government, then... I have <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> an end to the truce." [...] When it was defeated, Pankhurst led a protest march of 300 women to Parliament Square on 18 November. They were met with aggressive police response, directed by Home Secretary Winston Churchill: officers punched the marchers, twisted arms, and pulled on women's breasts. Although Pankhurst was allowed to enter Parliament, Prime Minister Asquith refused to meet her. The incident became known as Black Friday.|$|E

Now, the only difference is, of course, we are Americans, and they are Russians, and the people trying to break away there were pro-Russian.|$|E
2500|$|Under UK law, a {{contractor}} {{can be found}} caught by the tax initiative IR35, that is <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a virtual ("deemed") employment {{because that would be}} the case had the contract between worker and hirer been direct and the worker is then subject to extra taxes to compensate the government in that regard, yet he still has no apparent employment entitlements.

He reiterated that it was useless to 'become censorious about , <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> no God'. He also mentioned that his novel, The Book of Dust, is based on the 'extreme danger of putting power into the hands of those who believe in some absolute creed, whether that is Christianity or Islam or Marxism'.|$|E
2500|$|The {{explosion}} and resulting fire caused a full plant shutdown, reducing Western Australia's {{supply of energy}} by up to 35%. Apache's managing director, Tim Wall, said, [...] "It's pretty easy <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> {{a lot of damage}} here and we are looking at alternatives to try to get gas to market as soon as possible but it will be at least several months before we have partial sales." [...] He estimated it would be at least three months until the plant was at least partially operational, when the less-damaged processing plants for John Brookes and East Spar are brought back online. The John Brookes and East Spar plants produce 150-200 terajoules of gas daily, compared to 370 terajoules when all plants, including the significantly damaged Harriet plant, were fully operational. [...] Approximately 80-90% of the island's gas is used by industrial customers, with small amounts provided to Synergy, the state's largest electricity retailer.|$|E
