5|$|In the {{immediate}} aftermath of the executions, there was speculation that up to 27 more prisoners could face <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty.</b> Ultimately, these predictions proved ill-founded. Franco fell ill in late October 1975 and never recovered, dying on 20 November 1975. His death resulted in the de facto abolition of <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty,</b> as no further executions took place. Capital punishment was abolished for all civil crimes by the Spanish Constitution of 1978, with sanctioned military executions in war time the sole exceptions. In 1995, the Spanish parliament abolished <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> in all circumstances.|$|E
5|$|On 26 September, the Council of Ministers, {{headed by}} Franco, {{confirmed}} <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> for {{five of those}} sentenced: FRAP members José Humberto Baena, Ramón García Sanz and José Luis Sánchez Bravo and ETA members Ángel Otaegui and Juan Paredes, while commuting <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> {{in the case of}} the remaining six.|$|E

25|$|Since <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty's</b> {{suspension}} in 1965, {{there have}} been continued public and media calls for its reintroduction, particularly prompted by high-profile murder cases.|$|R
50|$|There {{has been}} {{continuing}} attention for the Carr brothers' case because of various rulings about <b>the</b> Kansas <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> law and decisions by its high court on such cases. In 2004 the Kansas Supreme Court overturned <b>the</b> state's <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> law, but <b>the</b> {{state attorney general}} appealed this ruling to the U.S. Supreme Court. It upheld the constitutionality of <b>the</b> state's <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> law, which returned the Carrs and other condemned killers to death row.|$|R
5000|$|The {{case has}} {{continued}} to receive attention because the convicted killers' sentences {{have been subject to}} various rulings related to <b>the</b> state's <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> law. In 2004, the Kansas Supreme Court overturned <b>the</b> state's <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> law, but <b>the</b> Kansas attorney general appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. It upheld the constitutionality of <b>the</b> state's <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> law; this meant that the Carrs and other condemned killers were returned to death row. Defense attorneys continued appeals.|$|R
5|$|Gibbs {{was also}} viewed {{as one of}} the crucial swing votes on a measure to repeal <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> in Colorado and use the {{resulting}} savings to fund a statewide cold case unit. Although he first voted to remove <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> repeal from the legislation, he later voted in support of a version of the bill containing the repeal, which came within one vote of passing the legislature {{on the final day of}} the session.|$|E
5|$|Opponents {{of capital}} {{punishment}} gathered at the Utah State Capitol to hold a rally during the final appeals. The protest was attended by Gardner's family, and was organized by Utahans for Alternatives to <b>the</b> <b>Death</b> <b>Penalty.</b> The protest also included the support of Brian King of the Utah House of Representatives, who pledged to urge the legislature to reconsider {{the use of the}} capital punishment. The family of murder victim Michael Burdell had also appealed on Gardner's behalf, stating that Burdell was a pacifist who would have opposed <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty.</b>|$|E
5|$|Similarly, the Supreme Court and {{individual}} justices have cited the Crimes Act's authorization of <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> {{as evidence that}} the founders believed it was constitutional.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, the Attorney-General {{disagreed}} with the contention that <b>the</b> mandatory <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> violates any customary international law prohibition against inhuman punishment. He submitted that the decisions after Ong Ah Chuan and Nguyen Tuong Van were reflective of the Privy Council's changing attitude toward <b>the</b> mandatory <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> specifically, but did not reflect any international consensus that <b>the</b> mandatory <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> is prohibited {{by the rules of}} customary international law. This was evident from {{the fact that there are}} still 31 states worldwide which continue to impose <b>the</b> mandatory <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> for drug-related offences as well as other serious crimes. Thus, the international consensus needed to establish the principle contended for by the appellant was lacking.|$|R
50|$|Later, <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalties</b> of Ricky and Raymond Tison {{were reduced}} to life {{sentences}} because they were both under twenty {{at the time of}} the crimes. Greenawalt was executed in 1997.|$|R
50|$|The Mattan family's {{first attempt}} to {{overturn}} the conviction was denied in 1969 by the Home Secretary James Callaghan; by this stage, three {{years had passed since}} <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty's</b> abolition.|$|R
5|$|Supporters of this {{assertion}} said that Ray's confession was given under pressure {{and that he}} had been threatened with <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Foreign Minister, Alexander Downer, {{said that}} Australia opposed <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> and would seek clemency {{for the group}} if they were convicted.|$|E
5|$|This was {{the last}} use of <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> in Spain; {{following}} the death of Francisco Franco, two months later, no further executions took place. The 1978 Spanish Constitution largely abolished <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty,</b> with the exception of limited cases in times of war, and these exceptions were abolished in 1995. In 2012, a Basque Government commission found that the processes used to convict two of those executed had violated their rights and awarded compensation to their families.|$|E
50|$|The U.S. Armed Forces Court of Appeals {{ruled in}} 1983 that <b>the</b> {{military}} <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> was unconstitutional. <b>The</b> military <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> was reinstated by {{an executive order}} of President Ronald Reagan in 1984, with new standards intended to rectify the Armed Forces Court of Appeals' objections.|$|R

25|$|At the {{sentencing}} stage, <b>the</b> mandatory <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> precluded <b>the</b> court from considering {{the circumstances in}} which the offence was committed.

5|$|After {{a three-week}} trial, in late July a twelve-person jury {{unanimously}} found both Owen and West guilty of murder. The state prosecutors, Kathy Pryce and Karen Seymour Johnson, requested that Owen and West face <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the {{attempted}} assassination of Ronald Reagan, Ford told reporters while appearing at a fundraiser for Thomas Kean that criminals who use firearms should get <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> {{in the event}} someone is injured with the weapon.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the trial, FRAP members VIadimiro Fernández, Manuel Blanco and José Humberto Baena {{received}} <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> for the killing of Lucio Rodríguez, an armed policeman, in Madrid on 14 July 1975. Humberto had been an activist in the then-illegal Communist Party of Spain and had been arrested and jailed following a student demonstration in 1970. His parents claimed that he had been in Portugal {{at the time of the}} killing and that one of the main witnesses was not allowed to attend the trial. Though the prosecution had sought <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> for all five accused, Pablo Mayoral Ronda and Fernando Siera Marco received sentences of 30 and 25 years respectively. Lawyers of the three sentenced to death appealed the sentences.|$|E
50|$|The High Court, which functioned until 1949, judged 108 cases; it {{pronounced}} eight <b>death</b> <b>penalties,</b> {{including one}} for an elderly Pétain, whose appeal failed. Only three of <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalties</b> were carried out: Pierre Laval; Fernand de Brinon, Vichy's Ambassador in Paris to the German authorities; and Joseph Darnand, head of the Milice.|$|R

5|$|As {{the crime}} {{involved}} {{more than one}} victim, the prosecutors decided to request <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> when the case went to trial. When faced with this possibility, Green's defense team brought in Sean O'Brien, a representative of a Missouri anti-capital-punishment group.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{pressed to}} reform the state's {{criminal}} code, {{which was based on}} the English system and imposed <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> for over 200 different crimes. Inspired by Thomas Jefferson's failed attempt to reform Virginia's code, he first asked the Lexington Democratic Society to study ways to make punishments more proportional to crimes in November 1793. By 1796, he was drafting a new code based on the principles that criminals should be rehabilitated, victims should be compensated for their injury, the public should be reimbursed for the cost of prosecuting the criminal, and the punishment's severity should serve as a deterrent for would-be offenders. In January 1798, he introduced his proposed code in the General Assembly. A month later, the Assembly reformed the code, abolishing <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> for every crime except first-degree murder.|$|E
5|$|From May 1, 1889, {{changes made}} by Congress allowed appeals of capital {{convictions}} to the United States Supreme Court. Forty-four {{cases in which}} Parker imposed <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> were appealed to the Supreme Court, which overturned and ordered a re-trial for 30 of them.|$|E
25|$|At any rate, {{whether there}} {{is in fact a}} {{customary}} international law rule that prohibits <b>the</b> mandatory <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> is also far from certain. The Court held that {{there is a lack of}} extensive and uniform state practice that supports the contention that customary international law prohibits <b>the</b> mandatory <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> as an inhuman punishment.|$|R
50|$|The last non-military {{execution}} in Mexico was in 1937, {{and the last}} military execution (of a soldier charged with insubordination and murder) was in 1961, so the official abolition of <b>the</b> military <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> in 2005 and of <b>the</b> civil <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> in 1976 lagged the de facto cessations by 68 and 15 years, respectively.|$|R

5|$|On 6 September 2006, it was {{revealed}} {{that as a result of}} appeals brought by prosecutors and heard by the Supreme Court, Chen had <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> reimposed after his reduced sentence of life imprisonment was overturned.

Prosecutors, in their appeals against the 20-year terms faced by most of the nine, had only called for them to be upgraded to life imprisonment. Czugaj's life sentence, after being reduced to 20 years on appeal, was reinstated. Stephens' life sentence was upheld on appeal as were Sukumaran's and Chan's death sentences. Lawrence had not lodged a further appeal to her 20-year sentence, so her sentence was not rejudged.|$|E
