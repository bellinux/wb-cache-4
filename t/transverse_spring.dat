25|$|A few {{suspension}} refinements {{were made}} for 1964. The front coil springs were changed from constant-rate to progressive or variable-rate and were more tightly wound at the top, while leaf thickness of the rear <b>transverse</b> <b>spring</b> was also altered thus providing a more comfortable ride with no sacrifice in handling. Shock absorbers were reworked toward the same end. The 1964 Corvette arrived with a new standard shock containing within its fluid reservoir a small bag of Freon gas that absorbed heat. Chevy added more sound insulation and revised body and transmission mounts for the 1964 Corvette. It also fitted additional bushings to quiet the shift linkage and placed a new boot around the lever. The result was a more livable car for everyday transportation.|$|E
25|$|The {{independent}} {{rear suspension}} Duntov created for Sting Ray was essentially a frame-mounted differential with U-jointed half-shafts tied together by a transverse leaf spring – a design derived from the CERV I concept. Rubber-cushioned struts carried the differential, which reduced ride harshness while improving tire adhesion, especially on rougher roads. The <b>transverse</b> <b>spring</b> was bolted {{to the rear of}} the differential case. A control arm extended laterally and slightly forward from each side of the case to a hub carrier, with a trailing radius rod mounted behind it. The half-shafts functioned like upper control arms. The lower arms controlled vertical wheel motion, while the trailing rods took care of fore/aft wheel motion and transferred braking torque to the frame. Shock absorbers were conventional twin-tube units. Considerably lighter than the old solid axle, the new rear suspension array delivered a significant reduction in unsprung weight, which was important since the 1963 model would retain the previous generation's outboard rear brakes. The new model's front suspension would be much as before, with unequal-length upper and lower A-arms on coil springs concentric with the shocks, plus a standard anti-roll bar. Steering remained the conventional recirculating-ball steering design, but it was geared at a higher 19.6:1 overall ratio (previously 21.0:1). Bolted to the frame rail at one end and to the relay rod at the other was a new hydraulic steering damper (essentially a shock absorber), which helped soak up bumps before they reached the steering wheel. What's more, hydraulically assisted steering would be offered as optional equipment for the first time on a Corvette – except on cars with the two most powerful engines – and offer a faster 17.1:1 ratio, which reduced lock-to-lock turns from 3.4 to just 2.9.|$|E
5000|$|The {{mechanical}} particular {{was that}} the rear suspension {{could not be a}} Hotchkiss drive. Ford Motor Company, which used a <b>transverse</b> <b>spring</b> suspension until 1949, could offer such a vehicle, and called its version a [...] "Victoria" [...] in the 1930s.|$|E

5000|$|Of {{the several}} Anglo-American hybrid cars {{produced}} in the late 1930s the Batten probably had the highest performance. The car used a Ford chassis shortened by 16 inches (400 mm) and narrowed at the rear with the <b>transverse</b> <b>spring</b> suspension retained on most cars but reset. The 3622 cc V-8 engine was tuned and with the car weighing only 2180 pounds (940 kg) in its most basic form, {{a top speed of}} over 100 mph (160 km/h) was easily obtained.|$|E
5000|$|The chassis {{took the}} form of an [...] "A" [...] with the engine mounted between the channel {{sections}} at the narrow front end. The rear suspension was by quarter elliptic springs cantilevered {{from the rear of the}} chassis while at the front the beam axle had a centrally mounted half elliptic <b>transverse</b> <b>spring.</b> Early cars did not have any shock absorbers. Brakes were on all wheels but at first the front brakes were operated by the handbrake and the rear by the footbrake, becoming fully coupled in 1930.|$|E
50|$|Dellow styling {{was created}} by Lionel Evans at his Radpanels coachbuilding {{business}} in Kidderminster. The car evolved through several variants known as Mk I to Mk V.

The Ford torque-tube was suitably shortened {{and the vast majority}} of cars used the 3-speed Ford gearbox but a very small number of cars (KOX 300 being one of them) were produced to customer order with a 4 speed gearbox, from the 10M series Morris.|$|E

50|$|Floating Power was a {{technology}} {{developed in the}} 1920s by the United States automobile firm of Chrysler, credited mostly to the engineering of Owen Ray Skelton. It was a new means of attaching an engine to its chassis, {{with the intention of}} reducing vibration. Four-cylinder engines of the day started and rode rather roughly, transmitting the torque to the whole chassis. By attaching the engine at only two points ("fore-and-aft"), on two points defining an axis that passes through the engine's center of mass, the engine would be able to rotate slightly about this axis and reduce the transmission of torsional vibration to the chassis. One mounting attachment was at the upper front of the engine, directly below the water pump. The rear mount was under the transmission case. A <b>transverse</b> <b>spring</b> went {{from the bottom of the}} engine to a snubber bracket on the frame rail to limit the rotational travel of the engine. The bracket was lined with rubber.|$|E

40|$|In {{this study}} {{microscopic}} gas bubbles (7 - 12 μm diameter) suspended in water were optically {{trapped in a}} custom-built microfluidic slide using holographically generated Laguerre-Gaussian (‘doughnut’) beam optical tweezers.

It was found that microbubbles were held at the equilibrium position of buoyant and optical forces at a distance from the focus of the beam that increased with laser power, and that optical trapping in this configuration was only possible within a specific range of trap and bubble parameters. Furthermore an optimum size of the doughnut beam to microbubble diameter which maximized the <b>transverse</b> <b>spring</b> constant was found.
