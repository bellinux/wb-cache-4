40|$|The {{removal of}} a patient from a laminar air flow room during {{protected}} isolation poses the risk of his microbial contamination and infection. Nonetheless, <b>temporary</b> <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> the laminar air flow room may be necessary for certain medical procedures or for psychological relief during prolonged periods of isolation or both. A means for protecting patients during <b>temporary</b> <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> the laminar air flow room is highly desirable. A previously described total body garment {{has been shown to}} be microbiologically safe and effective, but is expensive, cumbersome, and not very adaptable to patients of different ages and body sizes. We now present an alternative, microbiologically safe transportation system which delivers, high-efficiency particulate air-filtered air over the head and neck through a modified, lightweight, commercially available helmet and power supply and which can be comfortably and reliably used by isolated patients...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} a stowage plan for {{containers}} in a container ship. Since the approach to the containers on board the ship is only from above, it {{is often the case}} that containers have to be shifted. Shifting is defined as the <b>temporary</b> <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> and placement back of containers onto a stack of containers. Our aim is to find a stowage plan that minimizes the shifting cost. We show that the shift problem is NP-complete. We also show a relation between the stowage problem and the coloring of circle graphs problem. Using this relation we slightly improve Unger's upper bound on the coloring number of circle graphs...|$|R

40|$|A 42 -year-old woman {{experienced}} an acute asthma attack, seizures, and unconsciousness immediately after a carpet-cleaning and deodorizing job {{was conducted in}} her home. Exposure modeling estimates that she was exposed to approximately 3. 4 – 17 mg/m 3 of sodium tripolyphosphate and more than 14 mg/m 3 volatile organic compounds immediately after the cleaning. I derived two separate exposure models for these estimates that evidenced good consistency of exposure estimates. Asthmatics and carpet-cleaning companies should be advised about safety during carpetcleaning operations, including adequate warnings about excess risk for asthmatics, <b>temporary</b> <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> the home, reduced detergent levels within cleaners, and reduced overall levels of cleaning solutions used within the home. Further studies of carpet-cleaning exposures are indicated...|$|R
50|$|After 40 {{years as}} a museum ship, C.A. Thayer has again been restored, a {{restoration}} which took three years from 2004, and which resulted in her <b>temporary</b> <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> her berth at the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park. Approximately 80% of the ship's timbers were replaced with new timbers matching the original wood. The ship sailed back to the Hyde Street Pier on 12 April 2007.In Nov. 2016 she was moved to Alameda to be painted, get new booms and gaffs, and have three masts and a bowsprit installed by the Bay Ship and Yacht Company. She returned to the Hyde Street Pier in Feb. 2017. In 2017 she will be rigged with {{a new set of}} sails.|$|R

50|$|Due to the {{collapse}} of the Yugoslav Army, the general population of Montenegro had easy access to large amounts of military arms and ammunition. By July 1941, the Communist Party of Yugoslavia had over 1,800 members and another 3,000 youth members, located in the area of Montenegro, Kotor and the Sandzak. Most of these were ready to commence an armed uprising against the Axis powers and the occupying Italians in particular. Grievances mainly related to the expulsion of Montenegrin people from the Kosovo region and Vojvodina, as well as the influx of refugees from other parts of Yugoslavia. Other refugees were fleeing the terror of the Ustaše in the regions along the borders with Bosnia and Herzegovina. The Montenegrins also hated the Italians because they had annexed important food-producing territories around Kosovo and a salt-producing facility at Ulcinj to Albania. This was coupled with the economic damage inflicted by the <b>temporary</b> <b>removal</b> <b>from</b> circulation of Yugoslav banknotes of 500 dinars and more.|$|R
