5|$|Arms: A {{coat of arms}} {{consisting}} of a shield divided into quarters. In the upper left and lower right quarter, a red eagle, its wings outstretched. The upper right quarter shows a ship with furled sails, while in <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>left</b> quarter a red hand grasps a blue cross. A cow, standing on two hooves, appears {{on either side of}} the shield. The shield is surmounted by a silver helmet above which there is a hand grasping a dagger.|Coat of arms of the chief of Clan MacIntyre.|$|E
5|$|Metalloids lie {{on either}} side of the {{dividing}} line between metals and nonmetals. This can be found, in varying configurations, on some periodic tables. Elements to <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>left</b> of the line generally display increasing metallic behaviour; elements to the upper right display increasing nonmetallic behaviour. When presented as a regular stairstep, elements with the highest critical temperature for their groups (Li, Be, Al, Ge, Sb, Po) lie just below the line.|$|E

5|$|The {{review board}} {{determined}} that the electrical power momentarily failed at 23:30:55 GMT, and found evidence of several electric arcs in the interior equipment. They were unable to identify conclusively a single ignition source. They {{determined that the}} fire most likely started near the floor in <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>left</b> section of the cabin, close to the Environmental Control Unit. It spread from the left wall of the cabin to the right, with the floor being affected only briefly.|$|E
5|$|A smaller, single-panel oil {{painting}} by Lichtenstein {{around the same}} time, Tex!, has a similar composition, with a plane at <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>left</b> shooting an air-to-air missile at a second plane that is exploding in the upper right, with a word bubble. The same issue of All-American Men of War was the inspiration {{for at least three}} other Lichtenstein paintings, Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!, Brattata and Blam, in addition to Whaam! and Tex! The graphite pencil sketch, Jet Pilot was also from that issue. Several of Lichtenstein's other comics-based works are inspired by stories about Johnny Flying Cloud written by Robert Kanigher and illustrated by Novick, including Okay Hot-Shot, Okay!, Jet Pilot and Von Karp.|$|E
5|$|The print {{depicts a}} hollowed-out {{compound}} of three octahedra, a polyhedral compound composed of three interlocking regular octahedra, floating in space. Numerous other polyhedra and polyhedral compounds {{float in the}} background; the four largest are, on the upper left, the compound of cube and octahedron; on the upper right, the stella octangula; on <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>left,</b> a compound of two cubes; and on the lower right, a solid {{version of the same}} octahedron 3-compound. The smaller polyhedra visible within the print also include all of the five Platonic solids and the rhombic dodecahedron. In order to depict polyhedra accurately, Escher made models of them from cardboard.|$|E

5|$|Wrapped {{on one of}} {{the arms}} of Shiva is his iconic coiling serpent whose hood is seen near his left shoulder. Another hand (partly broken) gives the semblance of Shiva hugging Parvati, with a head of matted hair. A damaged ornamented drapery covers his lower torso, below the waist. Parvati is carved to the left of Shiva with a coiffured hair dress, fully bedecked with {{ornaments}} and jewellery. Between them stands a gana (dwarf jester) expressing confused panic as to whether Shiva will be able to contain the mighty river goddess. In <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>left</b> of the panel is a kneeling devout figure in namaste posture representing the heroic mythical king Bhagiratha who worked hard to bring the river of prosperity to his earthly kingdom, but unaware of the potentially destructive forces that came with it.|$|E
5|$|Overall, {{the relief}} is in {{excellent}} condition. It was originally received in three pieces and some fragments by the British Museum; after repair, some cracks are still apparent, in particular a triangular piece missing {{on the right}} edge, but the main features of the deity and the animals are intact. The figure's face has damage to its left side, {{the left side of}} the nose and the neck region. The headdress has some damage to its front and right hand side, but the overall shape can be inferred from symmetry. Half of the necklace is missing and the symbol of the figure held in her right hand; the owls' beaks are lost and a piece of a lion's tail. A comparison of images from 1936 and 2005 shows that some modern damage has been sustained as well: the right hand side of the crown has now lost its top tier, and at <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>left</b> corner a piece of the mountain patterning has chipped off and the owl has lost its right-side toes. However, in all major aspects, the relief has survived intact for more than 3,500years.|$|E
5|$|The way the {{painting}} shows {{the progress of}} time is also without precedent in Western art. The death of a blameless victim had typically been presented as a conclusive episode, imbued with the virtue of heroism. The Third of May offers no such cathartic message. Instead, there is a continuous procession of the condemned in a mechanical formalization of murder. The inevitable outcome {{is seen in the}} corpse of a man, splayed on the ground in <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>left</b> portion of the work. There is no room left for the sublime; his head and body have been disfigured to a degree that renders resurrection impossible. The victim is portrayed bereft of all aesthetic or spiritual grace. For the rest of the picture the viewer's eye level is mostly along the central horizontal axis; only here is the perspectival point of view changed, so that the viewer looks down on the mutilated body.|$|E

5|$|Two other SS units {{composed}} the inner ring of Hitler's personal protection. The SS-Begleitkommando des Führers (Escort Command of the Führer), formed in February 1932, served as Hitler's protection escort {{while he was}} travelling. This unit consisted of eight men who served around the clock protecting Hitler in shifts. Later the SS-Begleitkommando was expanded and {{became known as the}} Führerbegleitkommando (Führer Escort Command; FBK). It continued under separate command and remained responsible for Hitler's personal protection. The Führer Schutzkommando (Führer Protection Command; FSK) was a protection unit founded by Himmler in March 1933. Originally it was charged with protecting Hitler only while he was inside the borders of Bavaria. In early 1934, they replaced the SS-Begleitkommando for Hitler's protection throughout Germany. The FSK was renamed the Reichssicherheitsdienst (Reich Security Service; RSD) in August 1935. Johann Rattenhuber, chief of the RSD, for the most part took his orders directly from Hitler. The current FBK chief acted as his deputy. Wherever Hitler was in residence, members of the RSD and FBK would be present. RSD men patrolled the grounds and FBK men provided close security protection inside. The RSD and FBK worked together for security and personal protection during Hitler's trips and public events, but they operated as two groups and used separate vehicles. By March 1938, both units wore the standard field grey uniform of the SS. The RSD uniform had the SD diamond on <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> <b>left</b> sleeve.|$|E
