40|$|Objectives To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} various dilutions of antibiotic medicaments used in endodontic regeneration on the survival of human dental pulp stem cells (DPSCs) and to determine their antibacterial effect against established Enterococcus faecalis biofilm. Materials and methods The cytotoxic and antibacterial effects of different <b>triple</b> (<b>TAP)</b> and double antibiotic paste (DAP) dilutions (0. 125, 0. 25, 0. 5, 1, and 10 mg/ml) were tested against Enterococcus faecalis established biofilm and DPSC. Established bacterial biofilm were exposed to antibiotic dilutions for 3 days. Then, biofilms were collected, spiral plated, and the numbers of bacterial colony forming units (CFU/ml) were determined. For the cytotoxic effect, lactate dehydrogenase activity assays (LDH) and cell viability assays (WST- 1) were {{used to measure the}} percentage of DPSC cytotoxicity after 3 -day treatment with the same antibiotic dilutions. A general linear mixed model was used for statistical analyses (α[*]=[*] 0. 05). Results All antibiotic dilutions significantly decreased the bacterial CFU/ml. For WST- 1 assays, all antibiotic dilutions except 0. 125 mg/ml significantly reduced the viability of DPSC. For LDH assays, the three lowest tested concentrations of DAP (0. 5, 0. 25, 0. 125 mg/ml) and the two lowest concentrations of TAP (0. 25 and 0. 125 mg/ml) were non-toxic to DPSC. Conclusions All tested dilutions had an antibacterial effect against E. faecalis. However, 0. 125 mg/ml of DAP and TAP showed a significant antibacterial effect with no cytotoxic effects on DPSCs.

Materials and Methods: Immature human premolars were selected (n= 22). Four specimens were obtained from each root and randomly assigned to three treatment groups and a control group. Each specimen was exposed {{to one of three}} treatment pastes (<b>triple</b> antibiotic (<b>TAP),</b> double antibiotic (DAP), or calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH) 2] or neutral de-ionized water (control) for one or four weeks. After each time-interval, the indentation properties of the root canal dentine surfaces were measured using a BioDent reference point indenter. Two-way ANOVA and Fisher’s Protected Least Significant Differences were used for statistical analyses. Results: Significant differences in indentation parameters and estimated hardness between all groups at both time points were found. TAP treated dentine had the highest significant indentation parameters, followed by DAP treated dentine, untreated control dentine and Ca(OH) 2 treated dentine, respectively. Furthermore, TAP treated dentine had the lowest significant estimated hardness, followed by DAP treated dentine, untreated control dentine and Ca(OH) 2 treated dentine, respectively.

40|$|A recent {{treatment}} {{option for}} non-vital immature teeth in young patients is revascularization with <b>triple</b> antibiotic paste (<b>TAP).</b> However, tooth discoloration was reported {{with the use}} of conventional minocycline-containing TAP. In this case report, amoxicillin-containing TAP was used for revascularization of non-vital immature teeth to prevent tooth discoloration. At the 1 yr follow up, the teeth were asymptomatic on clinical examination and showed slight discoloration of the crown due to mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) filling rather than amoxicillin-containing TAP. Radiographic examination revealed complete resolution of the periapical radiolucency, and closed apex with obvious periodontal ligament space. However, the root growth was limited, and the treatment outcome was more like apexification rather than revascularization. These results may be due to unstable blood clot formation which could not resist the condensation force of MTA filling, whether or not a collagen matrix was in place. These cases showed that although revascularization was not successful, apexification could be expected, resulting in the resolution of the periapical radiolucency and the closure of the apex. Therefore, it is worthwhile attempting revascularization of non-vital immature teeth in young patients...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This study {{evaluated}} the bond strength of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) to root canal dentin after {{the performance of}} various irrigation procedures to remove <b>triple</b> antibiotic paste (<b>TAP).</b> A total of 56 single-rooted human mandibular premolars were instrumented using a rotary system to size 40 and divided randomly into a control group (no intracanal dressing) and three experimental groups (TAP application for 28 days). TAP was then removed by rinsing with 10 mL 2. 5 % NaOCl using three irrigation systems (Vibringe sonic irrigation, CanalBrush, and syringe irrigation). The coronal and middle parts of root canals were then obturated with MTA. After storage for 1 week, each specimen was embedded in an acrylic block and sectioned horizontally (2 -mm-thick slices) at two levels (coronal and middle). Bond strength of MTA to root canal dentin was assessed in 28 samples per group via push-out test using a universal testing machine. Data from the four groups were compared using one-way analysis of variance. Tukey&# 8217;s test was used for multiple comparisons. Push-out bond strength values were significantly higher in the control and Vibringe groups than in the CanalBrush and syringe irrigation groups (p < 0. 001).

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Although {{intracanal}} {{application of}} the <b>triple</b> antibiotic paste (<b>TAP)</b> may offer advantages (eg, disinfection), this practice {{has been associated with}} significant drawbacks, including tooth discoloration. In this study, the color change of dentin was monitored during treatment with distinct TAP pastes and novel tubular-shaped 3 -dimensional electrospun scaffolds containing minocycline (MINO) or doxycycline (DOX). METHODS: Two TAP pastes (TAPMINO [MINO, metronidazole, and ciprofloxacin] and TAPDOX [DOX, metronidazole, and ciprofloxacin]), 4 scaffold-based groups containing MINO or DOX at distinct concentrations, 1 antibiotic-free scaffold, and 1 untreated group (control) were investigated. Human canines were sectioned at the cementoenamel junction and tubular-shaped scaffolds or paste were placed into the root canals and sealed. Color measurements (CIEL(*) a(*) b(*) parameters) were performed at baseline and after 1, 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days. Color changes were expressed as ΔE(*) values. In addition, scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy were also performed on the specimens after treatment. Data were analyzed using repeated measures analysis of variance (alpha = 0. 05). RESULTS: All antibiotic-containing groups led to greater discoloration than the antibiotic-free groups. A severe discoloration occurred after 1 day. At the end of the experiment, antibiotic-treated samples exhibited crusts/agglomerates over the dentin surface, which totally or partially obliterated the dentinal tubules. The presence of MINO resulted in a greater color change than DOX.

40|$|Objectives: Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) is {{the most}} {{commonly}} isolated microorganism from teeth with postoperative infection. <b>Triple</b> antibiotic paste (<b>TAP)</b> {{has the ability to}} eradicate microorganisms from the root canal system when used as an intracanal medicament. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the minimum duration of application of TAP required for elimination of E. faecalis from the root canal system and its minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) in an ex-vivo model. Materials and Methods: Root canals of 34 extracted human single canal teeth were inoculated with E. Faecalis after instrumentation, and then 4 g of TAP (ciprofloxacin, metronidazole and doxycycline) was mixed with 4. 5 mL of saline and applied as intracanal medicament. The teeth were sectioned longitudinally and dentin chips were collected and evaluated to determine the count of bacterial colonies. Micro-dilution broth test was used to assess the MIC and MBC of TAP. Data were analyzed using SPSS version 22 via the Wilcoxon signed rank test. Results: After seven days of application of TAP as intracanal medicament, E. faecalis was eliminated from the dentinal tubules of the apical half of root canal up to 400 µ depth. The MIC and MBC of TAP in its original concentration were both found to be 16 µg/mL.   Conclusions: The original concentration of TAP was found to be 5 × 10 4 times its MIC.

The other 3 treatment groups were irrigated with NaOCl; treated for 4 weeks with <b>triple</b> antibiotic paste (<b>TAP),</b> diluted <b>triple</b> antibiotic paste (DTAP), or calcium hydroxide (Ca[OH] 2); and then irrigated with EDTA. After treatment, contact angles between a blood analog and dentin surfaces were evaluated. Surface roughness and chemical composition were characterized using optical profilometry and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy, respectively. One-way analysis of variance followed by Fisher least significant difference tests were used for statistical analyses. Results All treatment groups showed {{a significant reduction in}} wettability and a significant increase in surface roughness when compared with untreated dentin. Dentin treated with Ca(OH) 2 had significantly lower wettability compared with all other groups. No significant difference in wettability was found between dentin treated with DTAP and TAP protocols.

The treatment groups {{were treated with}} a clinically used concentration of <b>triple</b> antibiotic paste (<b>TAP),</b> double antibiotic paste (DAP), calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH) 2) or diluted TAP in a methylcellulose system (DTAP) for 1 week. Each sample in the treatment groups was then irrigated with EDTA. The two control groups were treated with EDTA or received no treatment. Dental pulp stem cells were seeded on each dentine specimen (10 000 cells). Lactate dehydrogenase activity assays were then performed to evaluate the attached DPSC after 1 day of incubation. Water-soluble tetrazolium assays {{were used to determine}} DPSC proliferation after three additional days of incubation. Friedman's test followed by least significant difference were used for statistical analyses (α = 0. 05). Results Triple antibiotic paste and DTAP regeneration protocols, as well as EDTA-treated dentine, caused significant increases in DPSC attachment to dentine.

After the medication removal, each group was divided in two subgroups and the coronal portion of each canal was filled with MTA or BD. After one week of storage, the coronal region of each root was horizontally sectioned and push-out test was performed. Data were analyzed by two-way analysis of variance and the Tukey post hoc test (P = 0. 05). PBS values were significantly affected by the type of material (P < 0. 001) and the type of medication used (P = 0. 049), but no interaction was found (P = 0. 97). The BD group showed significantly higher push-out resistance values than those of the MTA group (P < 0. 001). TAP showed the lowest PBS values, which were significantly lower than those of the control group (P = 0. 043) but not than those of CH (P = 0. 229). After a two-week application period, TAP seemed to decrease the PBS of both cements, while CH did not. BD appeared to have higher PBS compared to MTA, regardless of medication...|$|R
40|$|Objectives This {{study was}} {{performed}} to investigate the effects of different intracanal medicaments on chemical structure and microhardness of dentin. Materials and Methods Fifty human dentin discs were obtained from intact third molars and randomly assigned into two control groups and three treatment groups. The first control group received no treatment. The second control group (no medicament group) was irrigated with sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl), stored in humid environment for four weeks and then irrigated with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA). The three treatment groups were irrigated with NaOCl, treated for four weeks with either 1 g/mL <b>triple</b> antibiotic paste (<b>TAP),</b> 1 mg/mL methylcellulose-based triple antibiotic paste (DTAP), or calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH) 2] and finally irrigated with EDTA. After treatment, one half of each dentin disc was subjected to Vickers microhardness (n = 10 per group) {{and the other half}} was used to evaluate the chemical structure (phosphate/amide I ratio) of treated dentin utilizing attenuated total reflection Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (n = 5 per group). One-way ANOVA followed by Fisher's least significant difference were used for statistical analyses. Results Dentin discs treated with different intracanal medicaments and those treated with NaOCl + EDTA showed significant reduction in microhardness (p < 0. 0001) and phosphate/amide I ratio (p < 0. 05) compared to no treatment control dentin. Furthermore, dentin discs treated with TAP had significantly lower microhardness (p < 0. 0001) and phosphate/amide I ratio (p < 0. 0001) compared to all other groups. Conclusions The use of DTAP or Ca(OH) 2 medicaments during endodontic regeneration may cause significantly less microhardness reduction and superficial demineralization of dentin compared to the use of TAP...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Actinomyces naeslundii {{has been}} {{recovered}} from traumatized permanent teeth diagnosed with necrotic pulps. In this work, a <b>triple</b> antibiotic paste (<b>TAP)</b> -mimic scaffold is proposed as a drug-delivery strategy to eliminate A. naeslundii dentin biofilm. METHODS: Metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, and minocycline {{were added to}} a polydioxanone (PDS) polymer solution and spun into fibrous scaffolds. Fiber morphology, mechanical properties, and drug release were investigated by using scanning electron microscopy, microtensile testing, and high-performance liquid chromatography, respectively. Human dentin specimens (4 × 4 × 1 mm(3), n = 4 /group) were inoculated with A. naeslundii (ATCC 43146) for 7 days for biofilm formation. The infected dentin specimens were exposed to TAP-mimic scaffolds, TAP solution (positive control), and pure PDS (drug-free scaffold). Dentin infected (7 -day biofilm) specimens were used for comparison (negative control). Confocal laser scanning microscopy was done to determine bacterial viability. RESULTS: Scaffolds displayed a submicron mean fiber diameter (PDS = 689 ± 312 nm and TAP-mimic = 718 ± 125 nm). Overall, TAP-mimic scaffolds showed significantly (P ≤. 040) lower mechanical properties than PDS. Within the first 24 hours, a burst release for all drugs was seen. A sustained maintenance of metronidazole and ciprofloxacin was observed over 4 weeks, but not for minocycline. Confocal laser scanning microscopy demonstrated complete elimination of all viable bacteria exposed to the TAP solution. Meanwhile, TAP-mimic scaffolds led to a significant (P <. 05) reduction {{in the percentage of}} viable bacteria compared with the negative control and PDS. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that TAP-mimic scaffolds hold significant potential in the eradication/elimination of bacterial biofilm, a critical step in regenerative endodontics...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundIt {{has been}} well known that the {{inhibition}} of platelet aggregation (IPA) by anti-platelet agents was important to reduce the thrombo-embolic events in patients with ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI). However, the peri-procedural IPA by anti-platelet agents was not well known. MethodsWe compared the peri-procedural IPA between prasugrel and adjunctive cilostazol to dual anti-platelet therapy (<b>triple</b> anti-platelet therapy; <b>TAP)</b> in patients with STEMI undergoing primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We prospectively randomized 70 consecutive clopidogrel-naive patients with STEMI planned PCI to either prasugrel [loading dose (LD) 60 mg; 37 patients] or TAP (LD aspirin 300 mg, clopidogrel 600 mg, and cilostazol 200 mg; 33 patients). Primary end points {{of the study were}} the platelet reactivity unit (PRU) or % inhibition by the VerifyNow P 2 Y 12 assay at pre-PCI and pre-discharge. ResultsThe drug loading to pre-PCI time was similar between prasugrel and TAP groups (25. 4 ± 10. 42 min vs. 25. 5 ± 10. 56 min, p= 0. 957). PRU at pre-PCI was significantly lower in prasugrel than in TAP (269. 1 ± 71. 69 vs. 306. 5 ± 48. 67, p= 0. 012). The lower PRU and greater % inhibition also observed in prasugrel than in TAP at pre-discharge (108. 2 ± 60. 51 vs. 238. 1 ± 73. 40; 63. 6 ± 18. 51 % vs. 16. 8 ± 17. 91 %, p< 0. 001 respectively). No differences in in-hospital bleeding complications between the two groups were observed. ConclusionOur study demonstrates that prasugrel could produce a significantly greater peri-procedural as well as in-hospital IPA compared with TAP in patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{sought to}} investigate, in vitro, {{the effects of a}} {{recently}} developed <b>triple</b> antibiotic paste (<b>TAP)</b> -mimic polymer nanofibrous scaffold against Porphyromonas gingivalis-infected dentin biofilm. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dentin specimens (4 × 4 × 1 mm(3)) were prepared from human canines. The specimens were sterilized, inoculated with P. gingivalis (ATCC 33277), and incubated for 1 week to allow for biofilm formation. Infected dentin specimens were exposed for 3 days to the following treatments: antibiotic-free polydioxanone scaffold (PDS, control), PDS + 25 wt% TAP [25 mg of each antibiotic (metronidazole, ciprofloxacin, and minocycline) per mL of the PDS polymer solution], or a saturated TAP-based solution (50 mg of each antibiotic per mL of saline solution). In order to serve as the negative control, infected dentin specimens were left untreated (bacteria only). To determine the antimicrobial efficacy of the TAP-mimic scaffold, a colony-forming unit (CFU) per milliliter (n = 10 /group) measurement was performed. Furthermore, additional specimens (n = 2 /group) were prepared to qualitatively study biofilm inhibition via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Statistics were performed, and significance was set at the 5 % level. RESULTS: Both the TAP-mimic scaffold and the positive control (TAP solution) led to complete bacterial elimination, differing statistically (p < 0. 05) from the negative control group (bacteria only). No statistical differences were observed for CFU per milliliter data between antibiotic-free scaffolds (2. 7 log 10 CFU/mL) and the negative control (5. 9 log 10 CFU/mL). CONCLUSIONS: The obtained data revealed significant antimicrobial properties of the novel PDS-based TAP-mimic scaffold against an established P. gingivalis-infected dentin biofilm. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Collectively, the data suggest that the proposed nanofibrous scaffold might be used {{as an alternative to the}} advocated clinical gold standard (i. e., TAP) for intracanal disinfection prior to regenerative endodontics...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Regenerative endodontic {{procedure}} (REP) {{has been}} proposed as {{a new approach to}} treat immature permanent teeth. However, materials used in REP for root canal disinfection or cervical sealing may induce tooth discoloration. Objectives To assess tooth crown’s color after intracanal treatment with <b>triple</b> antibiotic paste (<b>TAP)</b> or calcium hydroxide (CH); cervical sealing with glass ionomer cement (GIC) or mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA); and bleaching with carbamide peroxide. Material and Methods After pulp removal and color spectrophotometer measurement, 50 bovine incisors were divided into 4 experimental groups and one control (untreated). Experiments were performed in phases (Ph). Ph 1 : TAP (ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, minocycline), TAPM (ciprofloxacin, metronidazole, amoxicillin), DAP (ciprofloxacin, metronidazole), or CH treatment groups. After 1 and 3 days (d); 1, 2, 3 weeks (w); and 1, 2, 3 and 4 months (m), color was measured and medications were removed. Ph 2 : GIC or MTA cervical sealing, each using half of the specimens from each group. Color was assessed after 1 d, 3 d; 1 w, 2 w, 3 w; 1 m and 2 m. Ph 3 : Two bleaching sessions, each followed by color measurement. Data were analyzed with ANOVA and post-hoc Holm-Sidak method. Results Ph 1 : Specimens of TAP group presented higher color alteration (ΔE) mean than those of TAPM group. No significant difference was found among TAP or TAPM and CH, DAP or Control groups. Ph 2 : cervical sealing materials showed no influence on color alteration. Ph 3 : Different ΔE means (from different groups), prior to bleaching, became equivalent after one bleaching session. Conclusions TAP induces higher color alteration than TAPM; color alteration increases over time; cervical sealing material has no influence on color alteration; and, dental bleaching was able to recover, at least partially, the tooth crown’s color...|$|R
40|$|Indiana University School of Dentistry Department of EndodonticsIntroduction: <b>Triple</b> {{antibiotic}} paste (<b>TAP,</b> 1000 mg/ml) {{is composed}} of equal portions of ciprofloxacin, metronidazole and minocycline and is used as an intracanal dressing to disinfect the infected immature root canal during endodontic regeneration procedures. Lower concentrations of TAP have been recommended to minimize detrimental effects on pulp stem cells. TAP can be retained within the dentin matrix and its continual release confers an antibacterial effect to the dentin. Objective: The aim of this in vitro {{study was to investigate}} the residual antibacterial effect of dentin treated with various concentrations of TAP loaded into a gel system. Materials and Methods: Radicular dentin slabs were prepared from human teeth after obtaining IRB approval. The slabs were sterilized and treated with methylcellulose-based TAP of 100 mg/mL, 10 mg/mL, 1 mg/mL, 1. 5 % NaOCl, placebo paste with no TAP, or a positive control group with pure 1000 mg/mL TAP. Samples in each group were treated with the assigned TAP concentration for three weeks or immersed in 1. 5 % NaOCl for five minutes (n = 18 per group). All samples were then irrigated with sterile water followed by 17 % EDTA and incubated in phosphate buffered saline for either 2 or 4 weeks. Samples were then inoculated with Enterococcus faecalis and incubated for an additional 3 weeks. Biofilm formed on each sample was then dislodged and spiral plated to evaluate the bacterial colony-forming units. Data were analyzed using Fisher’s Exact tests and Wilcoxon rank sum tests (α = 0. 05). Results: Dentin treated with 10, 100, or 1000 mg/mL of TAP demonstrated significant residual antibacterial effects up to four weeks. However, only 100 mg/mL TAP was able to completely prevent bacterial colonization after four weeks. No considerable residual antibacterial effect was observed in dentin treated with placebo gel, 1 mg/ml TAP or 1. 5 % NaOCl. Conclusion: At least 10 mg/mL of TAP loaded into a methylcellulose system is required to achieve a substantial residual antibacterial effect for four weeks...|$|R
