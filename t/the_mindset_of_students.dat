We recruited a total of 1260 (658 males and 602 females) Chinese students from five diversified primary and middle schools. Results from the structural equation model (SEM) show that the development of high levels of growth mindsets in students predicts higher psychological well-being and school engagement through the enhancement of resilience.

40|$|Abstract of the DissertationMindset Matters: Supporting Student Persistence Through The Developmental Mathematics PipelinebyTracey Nicole KiserDoctor of Education in Teaching and LearningUniversity of California, San Diego, 2016 Christopher P. Halter, ChairDevelopmental {{mathematics}} {{is one of}} the most challenging leaks in the mathematics K- 20 pipeline. Few students enter two-year colleges prepared to successfully engage in college-level mathematics classes. Many of students who place into developmental mathematics are low-income, underprepared, students of color, and many are not equipped with the necessary resources to help them persist through college Math placement predicts college success, and being placed into developmental mathematics makes it less possible for students to not only transfer from a community college to a university, but also graduate. Students who place into developmental mathematics can spend most of their community college experience relearning and building on skills they should have mastered in high school. This study investigated developmental mathematics, strategies for maximizing students’ success in developmental math classes, and the interactions between students’ social and physical environments that mediate their thinking and understanding of developmental mathematics. As a result, multiple methods of data sources (survey, field note observations, focus group interviews, and semi-structured interviews) were used to better understand students and teachers’ characterizations of accelerated developmental mathematics. 	The overarching finding in this study was that <b>the</b> <b>mindset</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> matter. Mindsets determine students’ decision-making and their motivation as a result of past math experiences. Consequently, students enter college with a lack of confidence in their ability to succeed in developmental mathematics, which affects their ability to transfer to a university and obtain a degree. While students past math experiences did not make them feel like they could grow mathematically, their personal lives motivated them to develop and grow as a whole individual. In-class practice and tutoring support were also instrumental to student success in developmental mathematics. This research study contributed knowledge about students’ learning needs, faculty perceptions of the students’ learning needs, the ways their instructional practices address students’ learning needs by using their voices to shed light on effective strategies for maximizing students’ success in developmental math classes...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{a number}} of commonly used theories and constructs applied to {{the investigation of the}} entrepreneur (at the individual level). For each of these theories, an existing measure is selected and assessed on its applicability to the study of entrepreneurship education, reflecting on past research and an empirical investigation in the entrepreneurship education context. Focusing on trait theory, self-efficacy, intentionality and passion, a measure for each construct was investigated by administering it on a sample of students (n= 367) taking an entrepreneurship education module. Aspects of the reliability, validity, internal consistency and factor structure of each test were examined using SPSS and MPlus statistical analyses. The findings allow for a direct comparison to be made of the measures in a controlled environment. Theoretically there is a justification for applying each assessment approach to entrepreneurship education. Based on past research it was noted that trait theory has often been criticised for inconsistent empirical findings. This was echoed in our study as empirical analysis supported the use of the entrepreneurial intentionality and entrepreneurial self-efficacy measures, yet the trait measure, the General Enterprise Tendency (GET) test displayed worrisome reliability and structural validities and would not be recommended for future research without significant revision. The measure used to examine entrepreneurial passion was stable in the context, and furthermore suggested that this construct may offer valuable insight about <b>the</b> <b>mindset</b> <b>of</b> <b>students</b> undertaking entrepreneurship education in future. Limitations of the study include use of a mainly homogenous sample with no control group. The measures for analysis were selected as they were intended for entrepreneurship research and have since been applied to entrepreneurship education. The measures are not reflective of respective theory as a whole. Different and many theories could have been selected, as well as alternative measurement instruments. The measures could have been integrated together into a more complex analysis, however the intended purpose was to examine them in parallel. There have been repeated calls to systematise the assessment of entrepreneurship education, to converge existing knowledge and research. It is hoped that this paper provides educators with an overview and empirical insight regarding theories and measures to adopt for future research and assessment approaches. ...|$|E

In this study, we explore the extent to which <b>the</b> <b>mindsets</b> <b>of</b> a <b>student’s</b> parents regarding math ability influence <b>the</b> student’s <b>mindset</b> in math ability and longer-term STEM-related outcomes. We pay particular attention to differences between male and female students. We also explore if student outcomes can be attributable to a role modeling effect through parental occupation type (i. e., whether the parent has a job in the STEM field or not) or if there is a remaining direct inheritance from parent growth mindset after controlling for parental occupation. We test these hypotheses in the Education Longitudinal Study of 2002 (ELS), a nationally-representative data set where data for high school students are linked to data from their parents and followed throughout secondary and postsecondary school. Estimating regression models while controlling for a rich set of covariates, we first show that students who exhibit greater levels <b>of</b> growth <b>mindset,</b> self-efficacy, and effort, particularly when it comes to their math coursework, demonstrate higher math achievement, complete more advanced math courses, are more likely to earn a college degree in a STEM field, and are more interested in and likely to actually enter the STEM fields.

On the other hand, although parental occupation type does not consistently explain short- and medium-term STEM outcomes, it does explain longer-term outcomes in early adulthood like graduating with a STEM degree and working in the STEM field.

PBL has now spread widely across the globe and beyond the healthcare disciplines, and has prevailed for almost four decades. PBL is essentially a strategic learning system design, which combines several complementary educational principles for the delivery of instruction. PBL is specifically aimed at enhancing and optimizing the educational outcomes of learner-centered, collaborative, contextual, integrated, self-directed, and reflective learning. The design and delivery of instruction in PBL involve peer teaching and learning in small groups through {{the social construction of}} knowledge using a real-life problem case to trigger the learning process. Therefore, PBL represents a major shift in the educational paradigm from the traditional teacher-directed (teacher-centered) instruction to student-centered (learner-centered) learning. PBL is firmly underpinned by several educational theories, but problems are often encountered in practice that can affect learning outcomes. Educators contemplating implementing PBL in their institutions should have a clear understanding of its basic tenets, its practice and its philosophy, as well as the issues, challenges, and opportunities associated with its implementation. Special attention should be paid to the training and selection of PBL tutors who have a critical role in the PBL process. Furthermore, a significant change in <b>the</b> <b>mindsets</b> <b>of</b> both <b>students</b> and teachers are required for the successful implementation of PBL. Thus, effective training programs for students and teachers must precede its implementation. PBL is a highly resource-intensive learning strategy and the returns on investment (i. e. the actual versus expected learning outcomes) should be carefully and critically appraised in the decision-making process. Implementation of PBL can be a daunting task and will require detailed and careful planning, together with a significant commitment on the part of educators given the responsibility to implement PBL in an institution. PBL can offer a more holistic, value-added, and quality education to energize student learning in the healthcare professions in the 21 st century. Successful implementation of PBL can therefore help to nurture in <b>students</b> the development <b>of</b> desired ‘habits of mind, behavior, and action’ to become the competent, caring, and ethical healthcare professionals of the 21 st century. Thus, PBL can contribute to the improvement of the healthcare of a nation by healthcare professionals, but we need to do it right...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{collective}} case {{study was to explore}} and understand administrators’ and teachers’ perceptions on how a school-wide positive behavior intervention and supports (SWPBIS) framework influences school climate at the elementary school level. The theory guiding this study was grounded in B. F. Skinner’s theory of operant behavior and applied behavior analysis, which supports the use of positive reinforcement to increase desired behavior in a real world setting. A rich description of the perceived influence a SWPBIS framework has on school climate was constructed by answering the central research question: “How do administrators and teachers perceive the influence of a SWPBIS on school climate at the elementary school level?” Although numerous research studies regarding SWPBIS have been conducted, few have addressed the perceptions of administrators and teachers. Participants included 37 administrators, teachers, and school personnel from 3 north Georgia elementary schools within the same district that had implemented SWPBIS. Data was collected during face-to-face interviews, focus group sessions, and from relevant documentation to increase trustworthiness through triangulation. Results of the present study demonstrate that administrators and teachers believe SWPBIS has positively changed <b>the</b> <b>mindset</b> and behaviors <b>of</b> <b>students,</b> teachers, and administrators resulting in a healthier school climate. Implications of the study include measures for central office personnel in making implementation decisions, measures for school administrators to increase buy-in, and measures for teachers to choose specific features to maximize the success of SWPBI...|$|R
40|$|During Robert E. Kennedy’s {{presidency}} at Cal Poly from 1967 to 1979, Cal Poly experienced many protests {{on several}} different topics, but all ended peacefully, without incident. I argue this is largely because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> peaceful <b>mindset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> body, faculty, and administration {{to keep the}} peace, making Cal Poly a more conservative campus compared to other California Universities, such as the University of California, Berkeley and San Francisco State University. For students, such as those involved in SNAP, violence was not {{a means to an}} end and one of their key goals was to educate rather than yell at others. They believed in Cal Poly’s “Learn By Doing” motto and chose to actually enact it by protesting, but also allowing open discussions about political issues and allowing people with dissenting opinions to voice their opinions without fear of persecution or the threat of harm. The faculty were also very concerned with the issues that were brought up and became involved in protests and held debates in which they had faculty with opposing viewpoints in open discussions, setting an example for their students. The administration also played a huge role in keeping the peace on campus by showing students that their dissatisfaction was not unnoticed by the heads of the school. Kennedy would listen to students, even if he had no real answer for them and would show them that although they tended to associate him with “the man,” that he was indeed also human, like them, and that he understood how frustrated they were. He cooperated with them by giving them times and locations to protest, instead of denying them the opportunity to make their viewpoints known...|$|R
40|$|The city of Amsterdam is a {{densely packed}} area, using every space {{possible}} to boast its unique architectural identity. In my project, I have explored these core foundations in Amsterdam architecture, whilst tying it {{together with the}} function of my building. My design for an International Boarding School in Amsterdam is an exclusive school, offering both accommodation and education. I delved into <b>the</b> <b>mindset</b> <b>of</b> an international <b>student,</b> attempting to fit in whilst also maintaining pride in their own background. This concept of simultaneous conformity and individuality was the primary inspiration behind my design process this semester. The original block plan provided was from an area of Amsterdam which was primarily housing based. Due to the insertion of Ross Boulevard, I consequently chose a triangular form {{at the end of}} one blackened area on the site plan. This however, forced the issue of what limited space we had to work with in terms of building size. Here arose the newer concept of cantilevering over the pedestrian accessway, a form not often seen in the streets of Amsterdam. This created an almost “demented” shape of a triangle, with an additional right angled triangle attached for the upper floors, as a means of maximising what little space I had to begin with. From this point, the building took momentum, creating specific functions for each level, moving from a more public open area on the ground floor, to education on the first, and accommodation on the second to assure privacy. The building remained in the traditional cladding of brick, however windows were enlarged to not only allow more light to enter the building in Amsterdam’s dimly lit skies, but also to escape the image of an institution. Thus, being positioned tightly within a busy Amsterdam block, my project fits into its surroundings, whilst remaining true to its own individuality. DESA 1002 (Design and Practice...|$|R
40|$|The basic aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{establish}} {{the relationship between the}} academic self-concept, attributions and <b>the</b> <b>mindset</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> <b>of</b> the second triad of the primary school. We are particularly interested in the student's learning self-concept, what attributions ascribe to their successful performance at school and <b>the</b> <b>mindset.</b> Furthermore, we are interested in the differences between boys and girls, as well as between the identified gifted students and thier classmates, all within measured variables. The theoretical part of this thesis describes the following constructs related to the theme: student's learning self-concept, attributions for the academic achievement and <b>the</b> <b>mindset,</b> taking in <b>the</b> interpretation of relations between them rely on theoretical and empirical findings of different authors. In the theories of the learning self-concept, attributions and <b>the</b> <b>mindset,</b> we find common ground on which the various studies confirmed that they are connected. Students' beliefs about their abilities are among the most important attributions that guide the students' perception of their successes or failures. According to Dweck, when interpreting their abilities, each individual has two assumptions: the first one being the belief that people are given certain abilities and skills and thus they cannot be changed, whereas the second assumption being that people believe they can develop and upgrade their knowledge and skills. The belief, whether these abilities are of a fixed or variable capacity influences the individual's behaviour, judgement and knowledge. The reasons for a student's success or failure are described in Weiner's attribution theory. It describes how individual explanations, apologies and excuses affect their learning motivation and to what the students attribute thier credits for the success or failure. Attributions answer the question »Why?«. The consequences of the given attributions are of great importance, since they impact the <b>student's</b> further expectations <b>of</b> success or failure, as well as their academic self-concept. The latter is being moulded by the student's subjective knowledge about their own learning abilities which are reflected in the experience of learning and academic achievement, {{as well as in the}} selection and use of learning strategies. In the empirical part, in accordance with the objectives of the thesis, 194 fifth and sixth graders, attending four different primary school from Gorenjska region, were surveyed. The data were quantitatively analyzed in a descriptive and inferential level of statistical analysis. The results showed there are certain correlations and statistically significant differences between treatments constructs. There were no differences in learning self-concept among boys and girls, the results show the benefit of positive learning self-concept. Both, boys and girls, are dominated by growth mindset. Statistically significant gender difference was seen in a permanent internal attributions of success, in favor of boys. Statistically significant differences between the identified gifted students and their classmates are in learning self-concept, in favor of positive learning self-concept when identified gifted students, in <b>the</b> growth <b>mindset,</b> also in favour <b>of</b> identified gifted <b>students,</b> in the attributions for academic success, again in favour of identified gifted with variable internal attributions of success. Classmates significantly higher than the rated continuous identified talented external attributions of success and failure, changing external attributions of success and constant internal attributions of failure. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{will focus}} on the popular culture {{iconography}} of the Pennsylvania State University: the Nittany Lion-as a symbol and apolitical mascot; Happy Valley, the geographic area in which the university is located, as a kind of sacred place and utopia in the Keystone State; football-its hallowed shrines, legendary coaches, and heroic players; regional foods and delicacies-from the unique offerings of the area 2 ̆ 7 s diners to the University Creamery (where patrons yearly consume more than 750, 000 ice cream cones); and Lion Shrine and the adjacent Nittany Lion Inn-where the faithful have made pilgrimages since the early-twentieth century. The sum of these parts contributes to the pastoral image of Happy Valley-an image that is a constant reality {{in the mind of the}} Penn Stater. The Happy Valley myth is perpetuated by socio-cultural activities indigenous to 2 ̆ 2 Lion Country. 2 ̆ 2 Certain activities are mandatory to be a real Penn Stater: sitting on the Nittany Lion Statue, going to a football game, buying a sticky bun at the College Diner, eating an ice cream cone from the University Creamery, and staying the night at the Nittany Lion Inn. Sociological texts, such as Emile Durkheim 2 ̆ 7 s Elementary Forms of Religion, are central to the theme of the thesis. Durkheim 2 ̆ 7 s work explains how symbols or totems represent the force of the group, thereby giving religious meaning to secular institutions. Moreover, anthropological theories of Clifford Geertz-taken from Interpretations of Culture-are indispensable in realizing how integral the use of signs and symbols are to that of the group 2 ̆ 7 s fundamental understanding of its own worldview. These cultural phenomena occupy a large part in <b>the</b> <b>mindset</b> and mentality <b>of</b> <b>students,</b> alumni, locals, and fans alike. Furthermore, the sacred iconic image of the Nittany Lion permeates the local psyche, media, and overall reality of the area. Ultimately, this constant reinforcement of local cultural values contributes to the bucolic image of Happy Valley as a kind of utopia, where the problems of urban life dissipate into the mountain air...|$|R
40|$|Transcendental {{intelligence}} is ability {{to listen to}} conscience or divine whisper of truth {{in the way of}} taking decision or make choices, empathize, and adaptable. Therefore, transcendental intelligence determined by the effort to purify and enlighten the heart (tazkiyyah) so as to provide advice and direction of action and the way in making decisions. One of function of the heart is to feel and experience; which means it is able to capture the sensory functions that are summarized and reflected back to the outside world, and this process is called to experience. The center of transcendental intelligence in the heart is love. Love is not a feeling of sensory but spiritual feeling, therefore the feeling of love can exceed sensory feelings. Transcendental {{intelligence is}} not only cognitive intelligence, but also the ability of the hearth which then reflected into the attitudes and actions that affect the live. In theory, transcendental intelligence is similar to the theory of tasawuf in general that is the way to clean the human heart in order that human beings become closer to God. <b>Student</b> <b>of</b> Tasawuf and Psychotherapy Department are students who study tasawuf in lectures. When compared with other departments in Ushuluddin and Humaniora Faculty, <b>student</b> <b>of</b> Tasawuf and Psychotherapy get more courses on tasawuf {{so that it can be}} concluded that the <b>student</b> <b>of</b> Tasawuf and Psychotherapy has knowledge of tasawuf that is more than the <b>students</b> <b>of</b> other departments in the Ushuluddin and Humaniora Faculty which then influence <b>the</b> <b>mindset</b> and behavior <b>of</b> <b>students.</b> Therefore, this study aims to prove the hypothesis that there is difference between the transcendental intelligence of Tasawuf and Psychotherapy <b>students</b> to <b>students</b> <b>of</b> other departments in Ushuluddin and Humaniora Faculty of UIN Walisongo Semarang period 2013. This study uses quantitative designs by using t-test analysis to find differences in the two different groups. From the results of this study it can be concluded that there is a significant difference between transcendental intelligence of of Tasawuf and Psychotherapy students and Non-Tasawuf and Psychotherapy students in Ushuluddin and Humaniora Faculty. So the hypothesis is proved correct. T test results show the value of t 5. 881 with significant p value 0. 000 with a significance of 0. 001 so that it can be concluded that there is a significant difference between transcendental intelligence of Tasawuf and Psychotherapy students and Non-Tasawuf and Psychotherapy students where Tasawuf and Psychotherapy students have the higher mean than Non-Tasawuf and Psychotherapy students...|$|R
