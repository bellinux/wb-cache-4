5|$|Between 1815 and 1824, the Rev William Buckland, a {{professor}} of geology at Oxford, collected more fossilized bones of Megalosaurus {{and became the first}} person to describe a dinosaur in a scientific journal.

5|$|Data for the abelisaurid forelimbs {{are known}} from Eoabelisaurus and the carnotaurines Aucasaurus, Carnotaurus and Majungasaurus. All had small forelimbs {{which seem to}} have been vestigial. <b>The</b> <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> the forearm (radius and ulna) were {{extremely}} short, only 25% of the length of the upper arm (humerus) in Carnotaurus and 33% in Aucasaurus. The entire arm was held straight, and the elbow joint was immobile.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the cold, the emperor penguin encounters another stressful condition on deep dives—markedly increased pressure of up to 40 {{times that of the}} surface, which in most other terrestrial organisms would cause barotrauma. <b>The</b> <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> the penguin are solid rather than air-filled, which eliminates the risk of mechanical barotrauma.|$|E

Moreover, in <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> marrow <b>of</b> rabbits administered with benzol injection for a long time, or injected with phenylhydrazine, korallgol, or exposed to X-rays, the carbohydrate metabolism has been more markedly inhibited. 2) The carbohydrate metabolism has been accelerated in <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> marrow <b>of</b> rabbits depleted of blood. 3) In <b>the</b> <b>bone</b> marrow <b>of</b> rabbits injected with saponin no abnormality can be observed in the carbohydrate metabolism. 4) Vitamin B(12) and bone marrow extracts have been found to act directly upon bone marrow as to promote the carbohydrate metabolism...|$|R

5|$|Some {{species have}} bony plates {{embedded}} in their skin, a trait {{that appears to}} have evolved independently several times.

5|$|The entepicondylar foramen is absent, as in {{all members}} of the Sigmodontinae; if present, as in some other rodents, this foramen (opening) {{perforates}} the distal (far) end of the humerus (upper arm bone). The pelvis and <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> the hindlimbs are heavily built. The femoral tubercle of the acetabulum (part of the pelvis), which anchors the rectum femoris muscle, is reduced relative to Holochilus and Lundomys.|$|E
5|$|Titanosaurians were {{a flourishing}} group of sauropod dinosaurs during Cretaceous times. The Spanish {{locality}} {{from the latest}} Cretaceous of “Lo Hueco” yielded a relatively well preserved, titanosaurian braincase, which shares a number of unique features with A. atacis from France. However, it appeared to differ from A. atacis in some traits also. The specimen has been provisionally identified as Ampelosaurus sp.; it is most likely a mature titanosaurian since <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> the braincase have largely fused together.|$|E

5|$|A 2007 report {{described}} pathologies in <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> Majungasaurus. Scientists {{examined the}} remains of at least 21 individuals and discovered four with noticeable pathologies. While pathology had been studied in large tetanuran theropods like allosaurids and tyrannosaurids, {{this was the first}} time an abelisauroid had been examined in this manner. No wounds were found on any skull elements, in contrast to tyrannosaurids where sometimes gruesome facial bites were common. One of the specimens was a phalanx (toe bone) of the foot, which had apparently been broken and subsequently healed.|$|E
5|$|A 2017 study {{indicates}} that juveniles were born with a robust build similar to the adults. Comparison of <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> juvenile S. fatalis specimens from La Brea {{with those of the}} contemporaneous American lion revealed that the two cats shared a similar growth curve. Felid forelimb development during ontogeny (changes during growth) has remained tightly constrained. The curve is similar to that for modern cats such as tigers and cougars, but shifts more towards the robust direction of the axes than is seen in modern felids.|$|E
5|$|According to {{historical}} sources, Augvald and his cow {{were taken from}} the battlefield and buried at Avaldsnes. In his Saga of Olav Tryggvason, Oddr Snorrason writes that Tryggvason excavated two mounds on Karmøy, revealing <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> a man in one and those of a cow in the other. Local legends contradict Augvald's burial at Avaldsnes, stating instead that he was buried in Ferkingstad, {{on the south side of}} the 12th-century churchyard. A large memorial stone, still standing, was raised outside the churchyard in memory of Augvald.|$|E

5|$|Caligula's first acts {{were said}} to be generous in spirit, though many were {{political}} in nature. To gain support, he granted bonuses to the military, including the Praetorian Guard, city troops and the army outside Italy. He destroyed Tiberius's treason papers, declared that treason trials were a thing of the past, and recalled those who had been sent into exile. He helped those who had been harmed by the imperial tax system, banished certain sexual deviants, and put on lavish spectacles for the public, including gladiatorial games. Caligula collected and brought back <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> his mother and of his brothers and deposited their remains in the tomb of Augustus.|$|E
5|$|Exposure to lead {{can occur}} by {{contaminated}} air, water, dust, food, or consumer products. Children are {{at greater risk}} as {{they are more likely to}} put objects in their mouth such as those that contain lead paint and absorb a greater proportion of the lead that they eat. Exposure at work is a common cause of lead poisoning in adults with certain occupations at particular risk. Diagnosis is typically by measurement of the blood lead level. The Centers for Disease Control (US) has set the upper limit for blood lead for adults at 10µg/dl (10µg/100 g) and for children at 5µg/dl. Elevated lead may also be detected by changes in red blood cells or dense lines in <b>the</b> <b>bones</b> <b>of</b> children as seen on X-ray.|$|E
