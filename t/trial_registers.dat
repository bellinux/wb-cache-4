40|$|Background: Publication and {{selective}} outcome reporting bias {{are a threat}} to the validity of systematic reviews. Extensive searching for additional trials in prospective <b>trial</b> <b>registers</b> could reduce this problem. We have evaluated how authors of Cochrane systematic reviews currently make use of <b>trial</b> <b>registers</b> as an additional source for the identification of potentially eligible trials. Methodology/Principal Findings: We included 210 systematic Cochrane reviews of interventions published between 2008 and 2010 of which the protocol was first published in 2008. When prospective <b>trial</b> <b>registers</b> were searched we recorded the names of the register(s), the authors ’ motive(s) and if they yielded any extra trials. In 80 reviews (38. 1 %) the authors had searched in one or more prospective <b>trial</b> <b>register(s)</b> of which 55 % had searched in overlapping search portals and individual registers. Most frequently assessed were the MetaRegister (66. 3 %) and Clinicaltrials. gov (60 %) which is in sharp contrast of other registers or portals like the WHO ICTRP Search Portal (20 %). Reported motives to use registers were to identify ongoing trials (83. 3 %), to identify unpublished outcomes or trials (23. 5 %), to identify recently published trials (11. 8 %), or to identify any relevant trial (3. 9 %). In 28 reviews (35 %) the authors had selected (ongoing) trials identified in <b>trial</b> <b>registers</b> as potentially eligible.

40|$|Aims: To {{evaluate}} {{the trend of}} clinical trials in India over the last 4 years compared to the well-established countries using clinical trial registries {{since the advent of}} clinical trial registry of India (CTRI). Materials and Methods: The data of clinical <b>trials</b> <b>registered</b> in India, United States (US), and European Union (EU) were obtained from websites of CTRI, clinicaltrial. gov and EU clinical trial registry, respectively from July 20, 2007 to August 29, 2011 for a period of 4 years. <b>Trials</b> <b>registered</b> in Australia, Canada, China, and Japan were obtained from WHO′s international clinical trial registry platform for the same period. We used search words for the common diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, etc., Results: The total number of clinical <b>trials</b> <b>registered</b> during the study period was 67, 448 across seven study nations. Clinical trials from India constituted only 2. 7 % {{of the total number of}} trials carried out, compared to US constituting 47 % of the total number of <b>trials</b> <b>registered,</b> followed by 18 % from EU and 11 % from Japan. However, India, China, and Japan have been found to show an increase of 3. 7 %, 5. 1 %, and 13. 1 % increase in the number of <b>trials</b> <b>registered</b> in 2011 compared to 2007. In contrast, US and EU showed a decline of 11. 3 % and 11. 95 % respectively in the total number of <b>trials</b> <b>registered</b> in 2011 compared to 2007.

In the current guidelines on {{diagnosis and treatment of}} AD, no recommendations for treatment of (risk of) undernutrition in community-dwelling AD patients are given. Methods: We conducted a systematic review on the effect of nutritional interventions in community-dwelling AD patients with (risk of) undernutrition, according to the methods outlined by the Cochrane Collaboration. Three electronic databases and three <b>trial</b> <b>registers</b> were searched from inception till April 2013. Results: Literature search in the electronic databases yielded 546 records of which one was relevant for this review. This study, with a high risk of bias, demonstrated that oral nutritional supplements improved nutritional outcomes without effect on clinical and biochemical outcomes. The search in the <b>trial</b> <b>registers</b> yielded 369 records of which two were relevant. One trial was terminated because of failing inclusion, the other is ongoing. Conclusions: This systematic review on the effect of nutritional interventions in community-dwelling AD patients with (risk of) undernutrition, reveals a serious lack of evidence.

40|$|Background. Identifying all {{existing}} {{evidence is}} a crucial aspect in conducting systematic reviews. Since the retrieval of electronic database searches alone is limited, guidelines recommend the use of addi- tional search strategies. The aim {{of this investigation was}} to assess the efficiency and contribution of additional search strategies for identifying randomized controlled trials in conducting a systematic review on interventions after performing a sensitive electronic database search. Design and Methods. Seven electronic databases, 3 journals and 11 systematic reviews were searched. All first authors of the included studies were contacted; citation tracking and a search in clinical <b>trial</b> <b>registers</b> were performed. A priori defined evaluation criteria were calculated for each search strategy. Results. A total of 358 full-text articles were identified; 50 studies were included in the systematic review, wherefrom 84. 0 % (42) were acquired by the sensitive electronic database search and 16. 0 % (8) through additional search strategies. Screening reference lists of related systematic reviews was the most beneficial additional search strategy, with an efficiency of 31. 3 % (5) and a contribution of 10. 0 % (5 / 50), whereas hand-searching and author contacts contributed two and one additional studies, respectively. Citation tracking and searching clinical <b>trial</b> <b>registers</b> did not lead to any further inclusion of primary studies. Conclusions. Based on our findings, hand-searching contents of relevant journals and screening reference lists of related systematic reviews may be helpful additional strategies to identify an extensive body of evidence. In case of limited resources, a sensitive electronic database search may constitute an appropriate alternative for identifying relevant trials...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: In September 2004, the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE) {{issued a}} Statement {{requiring}} that all clinical trials be registered at inception {{in a public}} register {{in order to be}} considered for publication. The World Health Organization (WHO) and ICMJE have identified 20 items that should be provided before a trial is considered registered, including contact information. Identifying those scientifically responsible for trial conduct increases accountability. The objective is to examine the proportion of registered clinical trials providing valid scientific leadership information. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We reviewed clinical trial entries listing Canadian investigators in the two largest international and public <b>trial</b> <b>registers,</b> the International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) register, and ClinicalTrials. gov. The main outcome measures were the proportion of clinical trials reporting valid contact information for the trials' Principal Investigator (PI) /Co-ordinating Investigator/Study Chair/Site PI, and trial e-mail contact address, stratified by funding source, recruiting status, and register. A total of 1388 entries (142 from ISRCTN and 1246 from ClinicalTrials. gov) comprised our sample. We found non-compliance with mandatory registration requirements regarding scientific leadership and trial contact information. Non-industry and partial industry funded trials {{were significantly more likely to}} identify the individual responsible for scientific leadership (OR = 259, 95 % CI: 95 - 701) and to provide a contact e-mail address (OR = 9. 6, 95 % CI: 6. 6 - 14) than were solely industry funded trials. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Despite the requirements set by WHO and ICMJE, data on scientific leadership and contact e-mail addresses are frequently omitted from clinical trials registered in the two leading public clinical <b>trial</b> <b>registers.</b> To promote accountability and transparency in clinical trials research, public clinical trials registers should ensure adequate monitoring of trial registration to ensure completion of mandatory contact information fields identifying scientific leadership...|$|E

40|$|Background A 2003 survey {{suggested}} {{the number of}} noncommercial trials in the UK was declining. Formation of the NIHR in 2006 and increased research spending by the Department of Health may have {{increased the number of}} noncommercial trials but no data are available. Methods Available data on UK noncommercial trials (were obtained from the two relevant registries: ISRCTN register for the UK, and US ClinicalTrials. gov. Data on each trial were sorted by start year, and compared with the: 2003 survey, and UKCRN portfolio database from 2007. Results The number of UK noncommercial <b>trials</b> <b>registered</b> rose from 25 in 1990 to 188 in 1999, peaked at 533 in 2003, and fell back to 334 in 2009. Total <b>trials</b> <b>registered</b> was similar to but slightly above those in the 2003 survey up to 1998, then rose sharply to 2002 before falling to 2007. From 2007 to 2009 the number registered to start each year was similar to but slightly above the UKCRN database. Less than 10 % of UK noncommercial <b>trials</b> <b>registered</b> with ClinGov for most years before 2005, but this rose to 35 % by 2009. Conclusions For the periods of overlap, trial registration data provide fairly similar totals to other sources on the number of noncommercial trials starting each year. The rise and fall in the number of <b>trials</b> <b>registered</b> between 1999 and 2007 was due to those registered in the ISRCTN database as funded by NHS Trusts. After 2007, the number of <b>trials</b> <b>registered</b> as funded by NHS Trusts has fallen in the ISRCTN <b>register</b> but these <b>trials</b> may have migrated to the US ClinGov register. The total number of noncommercial trial starts, excluding those funded by NHS Trusts, has been upward since around 2002. By 2009 the two main funders were NIHR and charities. Feasibility of using registration data to monitor the number of noncommercial trials has been demonstrated but is complicated by the use of two registers and difficulties in accessing the data.
