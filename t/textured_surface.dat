5|$|The fogstand beetle of the Namib Desert, Stenocara gracilipes, is able {{to collect}} water from fog, as its elytra have a <b>textured</b> <b>surface</b> {{combining}} hydrophilic (water-loving) bumps and waxy, hydrophobic troughs. The beetle faces the early morning breeze, holding up its abdomen; droplets condense on the elytra and run along ridges towards their mouthparts. Similar adaptations are found in several other Namib desert beetles such as Onymacris unguicularis.|$|E
5|$|Among Harrison's post-Beatles solo releases, Extra Texture is {{the only}} album on which his lyrics are devoid of any obvious spiritual message. Uniquely also, it was {{recorded}} mostly in America rather than England, while Harrison was working in Los Angeles {{in his role as}} head of Dark Horse Records. Gary Wright, David Foster, Jim Keltner, Jesse Ed Davis, Leon Russell, Tom Scott, Billy Preston and Jim Horn were among the many contributing musicians. The keyboard-heavy arrangements incorporate elements of soul music and the influence of Smokey Robinson, signalling a further departure from the rock and folk-rock sound of Harrison's popular early-1970s work. Contrasting with the musical content, the album's art design conveys an upbeat mood and includes an unusual die-cut cover with a <b>textured</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E

30|$|In this work, we {{investigated}} the Si texture surface {{as a part}} of paraboloid and developed a model for surface reflection of paraboloid texture surfaces. This model was used to predict the reflectance as a function of wavelength and h/D ratio for the paraboloid <b>textured</b> Si <b>surface.</b> This model considers the reflection from the entire solar spectrum, bulk absorption, and the contribution of the rear surface to light trapping. In the case of parabola, there is more possibility that the light could be concentrated inside the Si solar cell compared to the hemispherical, random pyramidal, and regular pyramidal <b>textured</b> <b>surfaces.</b> For hemispherical or pyramidal <b>textured</b> <b>surfaces,</b> the maximum h/D value can reach 0.5, whereas in paraboloid <b>textured</b> <b>surfaces,</b> the maximum h/D value can reach a maximum of 4 or even more by anisotropic chemical etching.|$|R

The surgical implantation procedures that {{have reduced the}} incidence of capsular contracture include submuscular emplacement, the use of breast implants with a <b>textured</b> <b>surface</b> (polyurethane-coated); limited pre-operative handling of the implants, limited contact with the chest skin of the implant pocket before the emplacement of the breast implant, and irrigation of the recipient site with triple-antibiotic solutions.|$|E

40|$|Background: {{standing}} on <b>textured</b> <b>surfaces</b> or wearing <b>textured</b> shoe insoles can alter balance performance. This evidence, although inconclusive, offers a potential intervention for improving balance in older adults. This study explored {{the effect of}} {{standing on}} <b>textured</b> <b>surfaces</b> on double-limb balance in older adults and changes in muscle activity as a possible mechanism of effect. Methods: 50 healthy older adults (29 female, age mean [1 SD] 75. 1 [5. 0]) stood quietly in six conditions—eyes open and closed on two different <b>textured</b> <b>surfaces</b> and a smooth surface control. Mediolateral sway, anterior-posterior sway and centre of pressure velocity were extracted from a force platform and lower limb muscle activity collected using surface electromyography (EMG) over 30 s. Results: for mediolateral range with eyes closed, there was a statistically significant effect of texture (F [2, 47] = 3. 840, P = 0. 033). This was attributed to a 9. 2 % decrease with Texture 1 compared with Control. No such effects were seen in any other balance variable or lower limb EMG activity for either visual condition. Conclusion: the results suggest an effect of standing on <b>textured</b> <b>surfaces</b> on mediolateral sway in older adults, supporting further work to develop the therapeutic benefits of <b>textured</b> <b>surfaces</b> as an intervention to improve balance...|$|R

25|$|For {{the past}} years, {{researchers}} {{have been trying to}} reduce the price of solar cells while maximizing efficiency. Thin-film solar cell is a cost-effective second generation solar cell with much reduced thickness at the expense of light absorption efficiency. Efforts to maximize light absorption efficiency with reduced thickness have been made. Surface texturing is one of techniques used to reduce optical losses to maximize light absorbed. Currently, surface texturing techniques on silicon photovoltaics are drawing much attention. Surface texturing could be done in multiple ways. Etching single crystalline silicon substrate can produce randomly distributed square based pyramids on the surface using anisotropic etchants. Recent studies show that c-Si wafers could be etched down to form nano-scale inverted pyramids. Multicrystalline silicon solar cells, due to poorer crystallographic quality, are less effective than single crystal solar cells, but mc-Si solar cells are still being used widely due to less manufacturing difficulties. It is reported that multicrystalline solar cells can be surface-textured to yield solar energy conversion efficiency comparable to that of monocrystalline silicon cells, through isotropic etching or photolithography techniques. Incident light rays onto a <b>textured</b> <b>surface</b> do not reflect back out to the air as opposed to rays onto a flat surface. Rather some light rays are bounced back onto the other surface again due to the geometry of the surface. This process significantly improves light to electricity conversion efficiency, due to increased light absorption. This texture effect as well as the interaction with other interfaces in the PV module is a challenging optical simulation task. A particularly efficient method for modeling and optimization is the OPTOS formalism. In 2012, researchers at MIT reported that c-Si films textured with nanoscale inverted pyramids could achieve light absorption comparable to 30 times thicker planar c-Si. In combination with anti-reflective coating, surface texturing technique can effectively trap light rays within a thin film silicon solar cell. Consequently, required thickness for solar cells decreases with the increased absorption of light rays.|$|E

2500|$|The role of glide wax is {{to adapt}} and improve the {{friction}} properties of a ski base to the expected snow properties to be encountered on a spectrum from cold crystalline snow to saturated granular snow. [...] Modern ski bases often are made from ultra-high-molecular-weight polyethylene (UHMWPE). Kuzmin asserts that UHMWPE is non-porous and can hold neither wax nor water, {{so there is no}} possibility for filling pores; furthermore, he asserts that UHMWPE is very hydrophobic, which means that wet snow does not appreciably retard the ski and that glide wax offers little additional ability to repel water. He notes that clear bases are more durable and hydrophobic than those with carbon content. The same author asserts that texture is more important than surface chemistry for creating the optimum balance between a running surface that's too dry (not slippery enough) and too wet (ski subject to suction forces). In warm, moist snow, texture can help break the retarding capillary attraction between the ski base and the snow. Giesbrecht agrees that low wetting angle of the ski base is key and also emphasizes the importance of the degree of surface roughness at the micrometre scale as a function of snow temperature—cold snow favoring a smoother surface and wetter, warmer snow favoring a <b>textured</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E

40|$|Texture as {{a surface}} {{representation}} {{is the subject}} of a wide body of computer vision and computer graphics literature. While texture is always associated with a form of repetition in the image, the repeating quantity may vary. The texture may be a color or albedo variation as in a checkerboard, a paisley print or zebra stripes. Very often in real-world scenes, texture is instead due to a surface height variation, e. g. pebbles, gravel, foliage and any rough surface. Such surfaces are referred to here as 3 D <b>textured</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Standard texture recognition algorithms are not appropriate for 3 D <b>textured</b> <b>surfaces</b> because the appearance of 3 D <b>textured</b> <b>surfaces</b> changes in a complex manner with viewing direction, illumination direction and scale. Recent methods have been developed for recognition of 3 D <b>textured</b> <b>surfaces</b> using a database of surfaces observed under varied imaging parameters. One of these methods is based on 3 D textons obtained using K-means clustering of multiscale feature vectors. Another method uses eigen-analysis originally developed for appearance-based object recognition. In this work we develop a hybrid approach that employs both feature grouping and dimensionality reduction. The method is tested using the Columbia-Utrecht texture database (CUReT) and provides excellent recognition rates. The method is compared with existing recognition methods for 3 D <b>textured</b> <b>surfaces.</b> A direct comparison is facilitated by empirical recognition rates from the same texture data set.
