25|$|The 'Barcid Empire' {{consisted}} of the Punic territories in Iberia. According to the historian Pedro Barceló, it {{can be described as}} a private military-economic hegemony backed by the two independent powers, Carthage and Gades (modern Cádiz). These shared the profits of the silver mines in southern Iberia with the Barcas family and closely followed Hellenistic diplomatic customs. Gades played a supporting role in this field, but Hannibal visited the local temple to conduct ceremonies before launching his campaign against Rome. The Barcid Empire was strongly influenced by the Hellenistic kingdoms of the time and for example, contrary to Carthage, it minted silver coins in its short <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>existence.</b>|$|E
25|$|During its <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>existence</b> {{the legal}} {{settlement}} {{that gives the}} rabbinical courts the monopoly on conducting the marriages and divorces of the entire Israeli Jewish population {{has been a source}} of great criticism from the secular public in Israel, but also to the ardent support from the religious public. The main argument of the supporters of the law is that its cancellation will divide the Jewish people in Israel between the Jews who would marry and divorce each other within the Jewish religious authorities and the Jews who would marry and divorce each other within the civil marriages—which would not be registered or inspected by the religious authorities, and thus their children would be considered illegitimate to marry the children of the couples married within the religious court, from fear of them being considered Mamzer. Opponents of the law see it as a severe offense to the human civil rights made by the state of Israel.|$|E
2500|$|In this {{document}} some modern day scholars note that “chain of being {{described by the}} Ikhwan possess a temporal aspect which has led certain scholars to view that {{the authors of the}} Rasai’l believed in the modern theory of evolution”. [...] According to the Rasa’il “But individuals are in perpetual flow; they are neither definite nor preserved. [...] The reason for the conservation of forms, genus and species in matter is fixity of their celestial cause because their efficient cause is the Universal Soul of the spheres instead of the change and continuous flux of individuals which is due to the variability of their cause”. [...] This statement is supporting the concept that species and individuals are not static, and that when they change it is due to a new purpose given. [...] In the Ikhwan doctrine there are similarities between that and the theory of evolution. [...] Both believe that “the <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>existence</b> of terrestrial plants precedes that of animals, minerals precede plants, and organism adapt to their environment”, but asserts that everything exists for a purpose.|$|E
