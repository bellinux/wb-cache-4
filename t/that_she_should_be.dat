5|$|In August 1923 Moriarty died, and Fortune—who {{had never}} been {{particularly}} popular among his followers—tried to convince them <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> their new leader. A few accepted her offer, but many others instead accepted the leadership of Stafford-Allen. Meanwhile, Fortune's parents relocated to the garden city of Letchworth, Hertfordshire in 1922, and {{it was here that}} Fortune carried out what she deemed to be additional communications with the Masters through trance mediumship between 1923 and 1925.|$|E
5|$|Obama {{advocated}} for her husband's policy priorities by promoting bills that support it. She hosted a White House reception for women's rights advocates {{in celebration of}} {{the enactment of the}} Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 Pay equity law. She supported the economic stimulus bill in visits to the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development and United States Department of Education. Some observers looked favorably upon her legislative activities, while others said <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> less involved in politics. According to her representatives, she intended to visit all United States Cabinet-level agencies in order to get acquainted with Washington.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} source mentioning Stephen by name {{dates from}} 30 April 1455, when Pope Callixtus III put the King of Bosnia {{and his son}} under his protection. King Thomas's ambitions for Stephen grew as he strived to establish closer relations with the Western world. In 1456, he asked the Pope to procure a bride for his son, specifying <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> a princess from a royal house. Negotiations soon commenced about Stephen's marriage to an illegitimate daughter of Francesco I Sforza, Duke of Milan, but Stephen's father harbored greater ambitions.|$|E

5|$|En Liten Hushålls-Cateches {{came out}} in 1800 and was only 43 pages long. In her last book Rückerschöld {{repeated}} her previous stances {{about the importance of}} knowing household skills, and that girls should be allowed to partake in household work from an early age rather than being pampered and taught impractical skills. While stressing that a woman's God-given station was in the home and <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> accustomed to humility and obedience, she also encouraged women to take matters in their own hands; the lack of household education could only be alleviated by sharing information and passing on knowledge {{from one generation to the}} other.|$|E
5|$|The trial {{ended with}} Lhermitte {{receiving}} the maximum sentence {{for the murder}} of her five children. The court and the jury did not take any extenuating circumstances into account. In her closing argument, Lhermitte said she would accept any punishment the court gave her and showed remorse for her actions. Earlier in the trial, psychiatrists had found that Lhermitte was not of sound mind when she committed the acts and should not be held accountable for her actions. They felt <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> admitted into a psychiatric institution rather than going to prison, but the jury did not follow their opinions. Lhermitte had been battling with depression for many years. She concluded that she saw the murder of her children and committing suicide as her only way out.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Day was a {{bachelor}} who had inherited his fortune {{from his father}} {{when he was an}} infant. Described as having a face pockmarked from smallpox, a brooding personality, and a short temper, Day attended Corpus Christi College, Oxford, to study philosophy. It was there that he decided to dedicate his life to becoming a virtuous man, shunning luxury and focusing on altruism. Around the same time he developed a list of requirements for his future wife, <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> subservient and pure but also able to discuss philosophy and live without frivolities. These high standards, combined with his generally unlikeable personality, meant that his advances were rejected by several women while he was at university.|$|E

5|$|Michael and Dwight {{meet with}} Jan, {{who is now}} a fairly {{successful}} office manager for a hospital and single mother. After Jan gives Michael a brutal description of why their relationship failed and he watches her play with her daughter Astrid, Michael reveals that he has herpes. He meets with Helene, Pam's mother, who is playing with CeCe at a playground; after an awkward conversation in which she also points out his skewed memory, he insults her and walks off. He meets with Carol while she is conducting an open house. Carol attempts to be polite, but then abruptly points out his faults too. Finally, Michael calls Holly one last time, only to get her voicemail. He leaves her a heartfelt message that what she said hurt him and that when he saw all his other exes, he had not been happy to see any of them, but when he talked to her, he was happy. He says that does not understand why she wants to downplay what they had, but he remembers their relationship perfectly and considers it special. Before hanging up, he awkwardly adds <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> tested for herpes.|$|E
25|$|Castalia {{was built}} in 1874 by the Thames Ironworks and Shipbuilding Company, Leamouth for the English Channel Steamship Company. Costing about £70,000 to build, she was {{designed}} by a Captain Dicey, who thought <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> more stable therefore leading to less seasickness for her passengers. Castalia was launched on 2 June. She was named for Lady Granville, who launched her.|$|E
25|$|He {{also noted}} that {{whatever}} {{the details of the}} contested initiation of the custody at the end of 1942 might be, Adrianus Hertogh had not been part of it and had not abrogated his parental rights. He therefore awarded the custody of Maria to the Hertoghs and ordered <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> handed over to her mother with immediate effect.|$|E

25|$|In recent decades, Christine de Pizan's {{work has}} been {{returned}} to prominence by the efforts of scholars such as Charity Cannon Willard, Earl Jeffrey Richards and Simone de Beauvoir. Certain scholars have argued <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> seen as an early feminist who efficiently used language to convey that women could {{play an important role}} within society. This characterization has been challenged by other critics, who say that it is either an anachronistic use of the word or a misinterpretation of her writing and intentions.|$|E
25|$|Some of her wealthy friends contributed {{often to}} her {{financial}} needs, such as Doane, Sankey, and Phoebe Knapp, although she still tended to give generously to those whom she saw as less fortunate than herself. Her longtime publisher The Biglow and Main Company paid her a small stipend of $8 each week {{in recognition of}} her contributions to their business over the years, even after she submitted fewer lyrics to them. However, Knapp and others believed that Biglow and Main had made enormous profits because of Crosby without compensating her adequately for her contributions, and <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> living more comfortably in her advanced years.|$|E
25|$|In 1983, Safia Bibi, {{a nearly}} blind teenaged {{domestic}} servant was allegedly raped by her employer and his son. Due {{to lack of}} evidence, she was convicted for adultery under the Zina ordinance, while the rapists were acquitted. She was sentenced to fifteen lashes, five years imprisonment, and a fine of 1000 rupees. The decision attracted so much publicity and condemnation from {{the public and the}} press that the Federal Shariah Court of its own motion, called for the records of the case and ordered <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> released from prison on her own bond. Subsequently, on appeal, the finding of the trial court was reversed and the conviction was set aside.|$|E

25|$|Radcliffe has {{advocated}} {{a system where}} first time offenders are banned {{for four years and}} any future offense for life. However, she felt that in cases like that of Christine Ohuruogu, who missed three out-of-competition drugs tests, <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> allowed to compete in the Olympics, as the BOA does not allow anyone who has served a doping ban to compete. However, when Ohuruogu admitted to not {{trying to get to the}} tests, Radcliffe expressed her disappointment and hoped that it was a lesson learned. When Marion Jones admitted to steroid use, Radcliffe stated that it was good for the sport that Jones was caught and that they had to keep testing and that people being caught is a big deterrent to would-be cheats.|$|E
25|$|In 1808 William Balfour {{replaced}} Balderston. He {{wrote to}} his uncle {{and some of his}} letters were later published. He described her as a leaky and <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> taken out of service. He reported that the owners had hired her out for 15s/month/ton (or £1795 per annum, based on a burthen of 195 tons). The owners also had agreed to provide 45 men at a rate of £5 10s each, per month. However, Balfour further reported that the owners were rarely able to provide half that many. At the time of writing, Cockatrice had a crew of 30 including Balfour and his servant. Lastly, Balfour reported that it was his understanding that Balderston had, in his 16 months in command, amassed some £2000 in prize money.|$|E
25|$|As {{she grew}} older her {{determination}} to make literature her profession became very strong, and no discouragements ever altered her purpose. As {{she was the}} oldest of four children, her father {{did not feel that}} it would be fair to the others to give her more than her just proportion of aid, since the others might also, in time, require assistance. Consequently, when at eighteen years old Miss Booth decided that it was necessary for her work <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> in New York, she could not depend entirely upon her father. While not disregarding any expressed wish of her parents, she made her own decision as to the chief aim of her life. She was now obliged to leave them, and in some way to earn the difference between the sum her father could allow her and her expenses, and also to find time and opportunity for that other work to which she meant to make everything subordinate.|$|E

25|$|When Zach dies {{in a plane}} crash, Greenlee feels {{responsible}} because Zach {{was trying}} to help her, and Kendall blames her for exactly the same reason. On December 28, Greenlee gets trapped in the Fusion elevator while Kendall is outside of the elevator. Still blaming Greenlee for Zach's death, Kendall is initially hesitant to help her. While trapped in the elevator, Greenlee and Kendall talk about Zach's death, during which Greenlee breaks down completely, stating that she loves both of them and is tormented by her inability to relieve Kendall's pain, climaxing when she tearfully proclaims that she should have died in Zach's place. With this, Kendall realizes that she does not want to lose Greenlee too, and manages to get help. Though Greenlee continues to insist that she does not deserve Kendall's help and <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> dead instead of Zach, Kendall immediately denies it, reassuring her that it was never her fault that Zach's plane crashed and that it was wrong of her to blame Greenlee in the first place, the two subsequently embracing and tearfully reaffirming their friendship before going back to Ryan's house, where Kendall tells everyone that it was Zach's influence that led her to save Greenlee.|$|E
25|$|On 16 July 1676, Malin Matsdotter {{was judged}} guilty as charged by a {{unanimous}} court on the testimonies {{of her daughters}} and sentenced to be executed. The method of execution {{was the subject of}} debate in the royal witchcraft commission, who was to decide between three alternatives; the first was the customary execution by decapitation followed by public burning of the corpse; the second was that she would be subjected to torture prior to the first alternative; and she third alternative was the she would be executed by being burned alive. The last alternative was given the majority vote. The clerical commissioner Carolinus stated in his vote that the honor of God should be regarded before the personal pain of Malin and <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> given a taste of what was awaiting her in Hell after having seduced so many souls to Satan; commissioners Ivar and Noreus motivated their vote by the deterring effect such a method would have upon the public and her accomplices, and commissioner doctor Urban Hjärne suggested that she be tortured with hot iron prior to the execution, which would make her unconscious and unable to feel pain, because her death would otherwise be too cruel, but the suggestion was revoked with the view, expressed by a priest, that the honour of the name of God was more important than Malin's personal experience of pain; the method was also deemed necessary as an example to the public and to her accomplices. She was instead to have a bag of gunpowder secured around her neck to make her death quicker.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, Hook arrives to the mansion to warn Emma, but Gold thwarts his efforts, erases his {{phone calls to}} Emma, and ties him to the fence. Inside the mansion, Elsa finds Emma and tells her that she sees her {{doing the same thing}} that she once did, blaming herself {{for not being able to}} control her powers because her family was harmed, and <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> blessed to have this gift. Elsa then asks Emma for her hand and she takes it, {{resulting}} in Emma's powers returning to normal. Outside, Gold, upset over what he just saw, becomes furious over his failed attempt to take Emma's power, which pleased Hook. However, Gold says that despite the setback, he will find a way to acquire the power to free him of the Dagger of Kris. But Gold also needs another item: the heart of someone who knew Gold before he became the Dark One. Since Killian is the only one left alive, Gold takes his heart. By doing so, Gold makes Killian his puppet and vows to use him to find another way to get Emma's powers, before he will kill him. As Hook reunites with Emma and kisses her, Emma wondered what got into him, and after she and Elsa walk away, he grabs the Sorcerer's box and hides it inside the jacket. Regina arrives at the library, where Robin shows her a page that featured the two together at the pub back in the Enchanted Forest, leading to indications that whoever wrote the story wanted them to be together. Back at the Snow Queen's lair, Ingrid, now free of the force field, follows through with her plan to bring her three sisters together by sending out her ribbons to Emma and Elsa. As Emma and Elsa are reunited with David, Mary Margaret, and Henry, she unleashed her magic into the sky, which creates colorful auroras and then fireworks. Unfortunately, Emma and Elsa notice the yellow ribbons on their left wrists too late, and that they can't remove their ribbons, even while the ribbons are siphoning away their power.|$|E
