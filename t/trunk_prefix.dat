50|$|Making a {{domestic}} (national) telephone call usually requires the dialing {{of a single}} or two-digit national <b>trunk</b> <b>prefix</b> preceding any area codes and the destination subscriber number. In most countries, such as Australia, Germany and the United Kingdom, the <b>trunk</b> <b>prefix</b> is 0. In the North American Numbering Plan (NANP) states, such as the U.S. and Canada, it is 1. For international telephone calls, the national <b>trunk</b> <b>prefix</b> is not dialed; instead, an international <b>trunk</b> <b>prefix</b> is typically required. Many countries use the sequence 00, but in the NANP it is 011.|$|E
50|$|The <b>trunk</b> <b>prefix</b> '0' is dropped when prefixed by {{the country}} code: +31 AA BBBBBBBB, +31 6 CBBBBBBB, etcetera. Note {{that there is not}} a <b>trunk</b> <b>prefix</b> for the 14 series so the {{international}} number becomes +31 14 0AAA.|$|E

5000|$|A {{dialing plan}} {{establishes}} the permitted sequences of digits dialed on subscriber or station lines with subscriber premises equipment, such as telephones and {{private branch exchange}} (PBX) systems. [...] Dialing plans in the public switch telephone network (PSTN) have traditionally been more {{commonly referred to as}} dialing procedures. The dialing plan of a private telephone system or a customer premise equipment, such as an analog telephone adapter (ATA) or an IP phone, is sometimes also called dial plan. The digit sequences (numbers) permissible in a dialing plan may be as short as a single digit, e.g. for reaching an operator, or as long as a complete international telephone number, including <b>trunk</b> <b>prefixes</b> and international prefixes.|$|R
50|$|Various office {{codes in}} certain plan areas are {{deliberately}} not issued, for example, numbers , where 212 and 718 are both New York City area codes, are typically avoided to prevent confusion between an area code and a similarly numbered local exchange {{in the same}} region. 958-xxxx and 959-xxxx are usually test numbers. Using 0 or 1 as the first digit of an area code or seven-digit local number is invalid, as is a 9 as the middle digit of an area code; these are <b>trunk</b> <b>prefixes</b> or reserved for North American Numbering Plan expansion. Lists of exchanges in an individual area code (posted by CNAC in Canada, NANP in the United States) all list various prefixes as deliberately not issued.|$|R
50|$|In {{national}} notation, the <b>trunk</b> <b>prefix</b> can {{be included}} with the area code if required by national writing conventions; <b>trunk</b> <b>prefix</b> is included in most European countries whenever they use fixed or variable dialing, but is omitted in USA and Canada where phone numbers only indicate optional area code.|$|E
50|$|When {{calling from}} abroad, the initial '0' <b>trunk</b> <b>prefix</b> is not required; it is, however, commonplace to {{represent}} telephone numbers {{with both the}} international code and the '0' <b>trunk</b> <b>prefix</b> - which is typically placed within parentheses - but this representation is inconsistent with the E.123 international standard.|$|E

50|$|Until 1995, {{calls to}} Malaysia from Singapore were direct, {{with only the}} area code and number being required, hence 03 for Kuala Lumpur instead of +60 3. In 1995, owing to the {{divergence}} of the two countries' numbering plans, the Subscriber <b>Trunk</b> Dialling <b>prefix</b> 020 was adopted. For example, in order to call a number in Kuala Lumpur, 020 is dialled first, followed by the area code 3 (excluding the leading zero), then the subscriber number.|$|R

40|$|In a Telephony network {{the most}} {{important}} issue is to select the correct Gateway for the data transformation. The Gateways are generally required for the handling purpose of geographical diversity, capacity, and redundancy. For this issues TGREP(Telephony Gateway Registration Protocol) is used. TGREP is a route registration protocol for telephony destinations on a gateway. These telephony destinations could be <b>prefixes,</b> <b>trunk</b> groups or Carriers. The proposed theoretical implementation of the simulator should allow the user to closely monitor the network under TGREP and consequently decide the values of various parameters so that the network gives an optimum performance. Based on the above goals, the simulator deals with the following aspects: Providing flexibility of defining the network by means of various parameters.  For a given ITAD configuration the simulator evaluates the performance of TGRE...|$|R

50|$|Calling inter-area (within Australia) (e.g. from Western Australia—area code 8), {{a caller}} need not dial an {{international}} <b>trunk</b> <b>prefix</b> or a country code. However, the caller must at least dial the Australian <b>trunk</b> <b>prefix</b> (0) {{followed by the}} area code (7) and then the local subscriber number: 07 3333 3333. Calling from within the Queensland (7) area, a caller need only dial the telephone number: 3333 3333.|$|E

50|$|Geographic area codes were {{designed}} {{based on previous}} 3-digit USSR area codes by removing the lead 0. Calling across areas still requires dialing <b>trunk</b> <b>prefix</b> 8 and waiting for dialtone after that. This pause was initially required by the analog trunk switches to identify the caller from PSTN for billing purposes. When calling within Belarus add 0 to the <b>trunk</b> <b>prefix.</b> This way dialing within the country is practically unchanged. In 2003 the abbreviated dialing within areas was replaced with a full 9-digit number + 2-digit <b>trunk</b> <b>prefix.</b> Previously {{it was possible to}} dial 82RRnn-nnn to reach a number in the same area. Now it is required to dial 80-AARRnn-nnn where AA is the area code, RR is the region code and nn-nnn is the local number.|$|E

50|$|Callers {{within a}} private {{numbering}} plan often dial a <b>trunk</b> <b>prefix</b> {{to reach a}} national or international destination (outside line) or to access a leased line (or tie-line) to another location within the same enterprise. A large manufacturer with factories and offices in multiple cities may use a prefix (such as '8') followed by an internal routing code to indicate a city or location, then an individual four- or five-digit extension number at the destination site. A common <b>trunk</b> <b>prefix</b> for an outside line on North American systems is the digit 9, followed by the outside destination number.|$|E
