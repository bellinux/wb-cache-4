500|$|In 2015, {{political}} historian Jenny Hocking {{revealed an}} exchange between Kerr and Prince Charles, who in 1975 was being mooted {{as a future}} Governor-General. In Kerr's private papers from September 1975, {{a month before the}} dismissal, Kerr had informed Prince Charles that he was considering dismissing Whitlam, and was concerned that his commission might be revoked by Whitlam to prevent it. According to Kerr, Charles had responded: [...] "But surely, Sir John, the Queen should not have to accept advice <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> recalled at the very time when you were considering having to dismiss the government". This information was also shared with Buckingham Palace because the Queen's Private Secretary, Sir Martin Charteris, wrote to Kerr that should this [...] "contingency" [...] arise, the Queen would try to delay things for as long as possible.|$|E
500|$|John Colonnello, a youth pastor from Athens, Alabama, criticized Rihanna's {{failure as}} a role model for young girls and women who look up to her. Colonello said that Rihanna is {{promoting}} the importance of one's physical appearance, and unhealthy sex: [...] "the message should be that it's about who you are on the inside and your character. <b>That</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> honest, trustworthy, faithful, kind, loving, compassionate and more." [...] The video is the third by Rihanna in 2011 to receive a negative reaction from organizations; [...] "S" [...] was banned from eleven countries due to its explicit sexual content, while [...] "Man Down" [...] attracted media attention when the Parents Television Council (PTC) criticized Rihanna for depicting a [...] "cold, calculated execution of murder" [...] in the video and for portraying a scenario of rape. On November 23, 2011, the music video for [...] "We Found Love" [...] was banned from broadcast before 10pm in France, owing to its violent, dangerous, and sexually suggestive nature. Ulster Cancer Foundation, an anti-smoking organization, condemned Rihanna for smoking in the music video. Doreen Reegan, a spokesperson for the organization, commented on the singer's decision to include smoking as part of her promotional image, saying: ...|$|E
500|$|He began rapping {{his poems}} {{in the eighth}} grade, and upon hearing Nas' 1996 album, It Was Written, began to pursue hip hop. [...] While {{attending}} Thornton Township High School, Fiasco met gang member Bishop G. [...] The two became friends due to their shared interest in music. [...] Fiasco's father allowed him and Bishop to make mixtapes in his basement, and the two gained notoriety at the school for their music. [...] However, they were kicked off stage during their first performance because their eclectic musical style was not embraced by the hip hop community. [...] Early in his career, he went by stage names Little Lu and Lu tha Underdog. Growing up, Fiasco was given the nickname [...] "Lu", {{the last part of}} his first name, by his mother. [...] "Lupe" [...] is an extension of this nickname, which he borrowed from a friend from high school. [...] "Fiasco" [...] is a reference to The Firm song [...] "Firm Fiasco"; the rapper [...] "liked the way it looked on paper." [...] He also said of his name, [...] "You know how rappers always have names like MC Terrorist—like they're 'terrorizing' other rappers? I knew fiasco meant a great disaster or something like that, but I didn't realize that the person named Fiasco would be the disaster, and <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> calling other MCs fiascos—not yourself...it kind of humbled me in a sense. It taught me like, 'Yo, stop rushing, or you're going to have some fiascos.'" ...|$|E

500|$|Other reviewers {{were less}} positive. The {{political}} {{journalist and author}} Andrew Rawnsley was critical of Blair's writing style in The Observer. [...] "It is Tony Blair's boast that he wrote every word in longhand 'on hundreds of notepads'. That I believe," [...] he wrote. [...] "He was the most brilliant communicator of his era as a platform speaker or television interviewee, but {{he can be a}} ghastly writer. Anyone thinking about taking this journey needs to be given a travel advisory: much of the prose is execrable ... I could say that it is a pity that Tony Blair did not employ a ghostwriter to prettify the prose and organise his recollections more elegantly." [...] Rawnsley does, though, praise the book as being [...] "a more honest political memoir than most and more open in many respects than I had anticipated." [...] Julian Glover, a columnist in The Guardian, said that [...] "no political memoir has ever been like this: a book written as if in a dream—or a nightmare; a literary out-of-body experience. By turns honest, confused, memorable, boastful, fitfully endearing, important, lazy, shallow, rambling and intellectually correct, it scampers through the last two decades like a trashy airport read." [...] The Sunday Telegraph was extremely critical of Blair's writing style. [...] "If Blair wants to tell you a funny story, he makes the mistake of signalling in advance <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> laughing—what happened was 'hilarious', his first weekend at Balmoral was 'utterly freaky'—thereby strangling the anecdote at birth. The book, like its author, is slightly embarrassing." [...] In the journal History Today, Archie Brown, Emeritus Professor of Politics at Oxford University was critical of what he believed to be Blair's flawed sense of leadership, but had praise for the chapter on the Northern Ireland peace process: [...] "Blair's role in the Northern Ireland settlement was perhaps his single most noteworthy achievement. His account of it is also the best chapter in a book which, even by the standards of memoirists who fancy themselves to be remarkable leaders, is strikingly egocentric." ...|$|E

2500|$|Several biblical {{passages}} historically motivated Christian apologetics. R. C.

[...] The verse quoted here reads in full: [...] "but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect." ...|$|E
2500|$|Continued Allied {{failure and}} heavy losses at the Battle of Loos between September and October 1915 ended any {{remaining}} {{confidence in the}} British commander, Sir John French and in the judgement of Lord Kitchener. Asquith resorted to a favoured stratagem and, persuading Kitchener to undertake {{a tour of the}} Gallipoli battlefield in the hope that he could be persuaded to remain in the Mediterranean as Commander-in-Chief, took temporary charge of the War Office himself. He then replaced French with Sir Douglas Haig; the latter recording in his diary for 10 December 1915; [...] "About 7pm I received a letter from the Prime Minister marked 'Secret' and enclosed in three envelopes. It ran 'Sir J. French has placed in my hands his resignation… Subject to the King's approval, I have the pleasure of proposing to you <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> his successor.'" [...] Asquith also appointed Sir William Robertson as Chief of the Imperial General Staff with increased powers, reporting directly to the Cabinet and with the sole right to give them military advice, relegating the Secretary of State for War to the tasks of recruiting and supplying the army. Lastly, he instituted a smaller Dardanelles Committee, re-christened the War Committee, with himself, Balfour, Bonar Law, Lloyd George and Reginald McKenna as members although, as this soon increased, the Committee continued the failings of its predecessor, being [...] "too large and lack(ing) executive authority". None of this saved the Dardanelles Campaign and the decision to evacuate was taken in December, resulting in the resignation from the Duchy of Lancaster of Churchill, who wrote, [...] "I could not accept a position of general responsibility for war policy without any effective share in its guidance and control." [...] Further reverses took place in the Balkans: the Central Powers overran Serbia, forcing the Allied troops which had attempted to intervene back towards Salonika.|$|E
