5|$|The court {{declared}} that Hill was not validly elected at the 1998 federal election. However, {{they did not}} declare the whole election invalid, acting on an earlier decision of the court, because although no effect could be given to voters' preferences for Hill, their other preferences were not invalid, and those {{could be used to}} determine who should be elected in Hill's stead. The court did not reach a definite decision about what action should be taken, remitting <b>that</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> a lower court. Eventually, Len Harris, the number two candidate on the One Nation ticket, was elected in Hill's stead, taking up his seat on 1 July 1999.|$|E
25|$|The {{first two}} members of each family {{appeared}} at the face-off podium and were asked a question to which only the number-one answer was available. Giving the top answer added the value for <b>that</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> the family's bank. The process then repeated with the four remaining members from each family. On {{the first half of}} the daytime version, families were staked with $2,500. The first question was worth $500, with each succeeding question worth $500 more than the previous, with the final question worth $2,500. This allowed for a potential maximum bank of $10,000. For the second half of the daytime version, and also on the syndicated version, all values were doubled, making the maximum potential bank $20,000. The team that eventually won the game played for their bank in Fast Money.|$|E
500|$|At {{the podium}} interview, {{conducted}} by film director George Lucas, Lewis Hamilton expressed gratitude to his {{team and the}} fans at the venue. Felipe Massa, asked about his last lap fight with teammate Bottas, stated: [...] "I’m getting old for that! I even said to the team I’m getting old! The last three laps of the race I was fighting with my team-mate. It was very difficult but we managed to be here." [...] During the post-race press conference, Hamilton expressed surprise over his championship lead, since {{he had not been}} made aware of Rosberg's retirement at that point. When asked about the tyre pressure issue, Sebastian Vettel defended Hamilton, saying: [...] "I think it’s not fair to hand <b>that</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> Lewis because he doesn’t know what’s going on [...] In a lot of respect and fairness he {{did a very good job}} today and you have to accept that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Much of {{the story}} engages with the {{philosophical}} idealism of George Berkeley, who questioned whether {{it is possible to}} say that a thing exists if it is not being perceived. (Berkeley, a philosopher and, later, a bishop in the Protestant Church of Ireland, resolved <b>that</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> his own satisfaction by saying that the omnipresent perception of God ensures that objects continue to exist outside of personal or human perception.) Berkeley's philosophy privileges perceptions over any notion of the [...] "thing in itself." [...] Immanuel Kant accused Berkeley of {{going so far as to}} deny objective reality.|$|E
2500|$|The German Millionaires risk format {{features}} an extra lifeline called [...] "Ask One of the Audience", {{in which the}} host will reread the question and ask the audience who think {{they would be able}} to answer <b>that</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> stand up. The contestant may choose one of these (judging by looks only) and discuss the question at length with said audience member. He may or may not choose an answer after that. If he chooses the suggested answer and it proves to be correct, the audience member will also receive a prize of €500. This lifeline is also implemented in the Costa Rican version, after the first milestone is reached. Starting in its thirteenth season, the U.S. syndicated version uses a variant of this lifeline, called [...] "Plus One", which allows the contestant to bring a companion with them for help, rather than having them select their companion from the audience.|$|E
2500|$|After the reunion, Nielsen and Friis {{returned}} to anonymity and resumed their respective jobs as postman and truck driver. while Christensen continued his solo career. On November 12, 2010, EMI released the compilation album Big-5: Dizzy Mizz Lizzy {{as part of}} their Big-5 series, containing their artists' five best tracks. In the case of Dizzy Mizz Lizzy, these were all taken from their eponymous debut album. Christensen released his fourth solo album, Tim Christensen and The Damn Crystals on November 25, 2011. In interviews, he was often asked questions about Dizzy Mizz Lizzy, to which Christensen explained that already a week after the last show, Dizzy Mizz Lizzy was out of his system again. Prior to the reunion, Christensen was often being asked about a Dizzy-reunion. On the question whether people have stopped asking about this now, Christensen answered: [...] "No, they haven't. Except that now, it's no longer: 'Will Dizzy ever reunite?' but instead: 'Will you do it again?' And I won't exclude the possibility, but it won't be any time soon. But I have stopped asking <b>that</b> <b>question</b> <b>to</b> myself." [...] Christensen went on to release [...] in 2012, and he performed a Paul McCartney tribute [...] with Mike Viola, Tracy Bonham and his solo band The Damn Crystals in 2012, which was released as the album Pure McCartney in 2013. Together with Mads Langer, he recorded the EP Side Effects in 2014, of which [...] "Bringing Back Tomorrow" [...] became a hit. He was expected to also be working on his fifth solo album or a second volume of The EP Series, which Christensen still plans in addition to the Dizzy Mizz Lizzy reunion.|$|E
