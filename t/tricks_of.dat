Burgess devised a Stone Age language for La Guerre du Feu (Quest for Fire; Jean-Jacques Annaud, 1981).|$|E
25|$|In 1854, Anderson held a {{farewell}} performance in Aberdeen. The {{success of this}} show was enough to inspire Anderson not to retire. Rather, he began to concentrate his efforts on exposing the <b>tricks</b> <b>of</b> mediums and spiritualist fraud. In his shows, he used his daughters to duplicate spiritualist effects. Anderson {{was one of the}} magicians of his day who exposed the frauds of the Davenport brothers. The show played at the Lyceum in London and then moved to Covent Garden in 1855. The following year, after a gala performance, the theatre caught fire, destroying all of Anderson's properties and bankrupting him {{for the second time in}} his professional career.|$|E
25|$|In 1872, Alcock {{purchased}} the Football Association Cup for £20. That year, fifteen clubs entered the competition. Queen's Park reached the semi-finals without playing due to withdrawals, but {{then after a}} goalless draw with Wanderers, were forced to withdraw as {{before the advent of}} penalties and extra time, they could not afford to come back to London for the replay. Wanderers won the cup outright in 1878 after what remains to this day one of only two hat <b>tricks</b> <b>of</b> wins ever. However they returned the cup to the FA in order for the competition to continue, on the condition that no other club could win the cup outright ever again.|$|E

25|$|Elsewhere {{within the}} Vatican, Bernini created {{systematic}} rearrangements and majestic embellishment of either empty or aesthetically undistinguished space that exist as he designed {{them to the}} present day and have become indelible icons of the splendor of the papal precincts. Within the hitherto unadorned apse of the basilica, the Cathedra Petri, the symbolic throne of St Peter, was rearranged as a monumental gilded bronze extravagance that matched the Baldacchino created earlier in the century. Bernini's complete reconstruction of the Scala Regia, the stately papal stairway between St. Peters's and the Vatican Palace, was slightly less ostentatious in appearance but still taxed Bernini's creative powers (employing, for example, clever <b>tricks</b> <b>of</b> optical illusion) to create a seemingly uniform, totally functional, but nonetheless regally impressive stairway to connect two irregular buildings within an even more irregular space.|$|E
25|$|Casino (1995), like The Age of Innocence before it, {{focused on}} a tightly wound male whose well-ordered life is {{disrupted}} {{by the arrival of}} unpredictable forces. The fact that it was a violent gangster film made it more palatable to fans of the director who perhaps were baffled by the apparent departure of the earlier film. Casino was a box office success, but the film received mixed notices from critics. In large part this was due to its huge stylistic similarities to his earlier Goodfellas, and its excessive violence that garnered it a reputation as possibly the most violent American gangster film ever made. Indeed, many of the tropes and <b>tricks</b> <b>of</b> the earlier film resurfaced more or less intact, most obviously the casting of both Robert De Niro and Joe Pesci, Pesci once again playing an unbridled psychopath. Sharon Stone was nominated for the Best Actress Academy Award for her performance. During the filming Scorsese played a background part as a gambler at one of the tables.|$|E
25|$|While the Loch Ness monster {{is often}} {{reported}} as {{looking like a}} plesiosaur, it is also often described as looking completely different. A number of reasons have been presented for why a plesiosaurian identity is unlikely. These include {{the assumption that the}} water in the loch is too cold for a, for the sake of this argument, presumed cold-blooded reptile to be able to survive easily, the assumption that air-breathing animals would be easy to see whenever they appear at the surface to breathe, the fact that the loch is too small and contains insufficient food to be able to support a breeding colony of large animals, and finally the fact that the lake was only formed 10,000 years ago {{at the end of the}} last ice age, while the latest fossil appearance of plesiosaurs dates to over 66 million years ago. Frequent explanations for the sightings include waves, floating inanimate objects, <b>tricks</b> <b>of</b> the light, swimming known animals, and practical jokes. Nevertheless, in the popular imagination, plesiosaurs have come to be identified with the Monster of Loch Ness. This has had the advantage of making the group better known to the general public, but the disadvantage that people have trouble taking the subject seriously, forcing paleontologists to explain time and again that plesiosaurs really did exist and are not creatures of myth or fantasy.|$|E

Early in his career he broke his ribs and backbone, but learned the <b>tricks</b> <b>of</b> the trade, such as interlinking arms with opposition players {{to prevent them from}} jumping. Billy Horner compared him with Malcolm Poskett, and stated the only quality missing in Houchen's game was aggression. Horner and his coaching team of George Smith and Willie Maddren taught Houchen how to protect himself from the highly physical centre-halves that dominated the division, and the youngster learned how to hold the ball up and bring other players into the attack.|$|E
500|$|Kagan {{states that}} Pericles adopted [...] "an {{elevated}} mode of speech, {{free from the}} vulgar and knavish <b>tricks</b> <b>of</b> mob-orators" [...] and, according to Diodorus Siculus, he [...] "excelled all his fellow citizens in skill of oratory". According to Plutarch, he avoided using gimmicks in his speeches, unlike the passionate Demosthenes, and always spoke in a calm and tranquil manner. The biographer points out, however, that the poet Ion reported that Pericles' speaking style was [...] "a presumptuous and somewhat arrogant manner of address, and that into his haughtiness there entered {{a good deal of}} disdain and contempt for others".|$|E

The mother in Trimmer's text acts as a [...] "spiritual leader" [...] and demonstrates that a woman is capable of [...] "theological reasoning". Such depictions challenge [...] Jean-Jacques Rousseau's claims that women are capable only of memorizing religious dogma and not of sophisticated reasoning.

500|$|Reviewers celebrated McEwan's {{dissection}} of the quotidian and {{his talent}} for observation and description. Michiko Kakutani liked the [...] "myriad of small, telling details and a reverence for their very ordinariness [...] ", and the suspense created that threatens these. Tim Adams concurred in The Observer, calling the observation [...] "wonderfully precise". Mark Lawson in The Guardian said McEwan's style had matured into [...] "scrupulous, sensual rhythms," [...] and noted the considered word choice that enables his work. Perowne, for example, is a convincing neurosurgeon {{by the end}} of the book. This attention to detail allowed McEwan to use all the <b>tricks</b> <b>of</b> fiction to generate [...] "a growing sense of disquiet with the tiniest finger-flicks of detail".|$|E

The [...] "dynamic duo take a saber saw to a glistening new Maybach {{and turn it}} into a tricked-out 'Thunderdome' cruiser, then do doughnuts in a parking lot with a gaggle of models packed in the back." [...] The video [...] "eschews the narrative spazzouts and stoner-boggling <b>tricks</b> <b>of</b> previous Jonze videos" [...] preferring instead to [...] "luxuriate in the icon status of its two principals. We get fireworks, fist bumps, a fast car, and general larger-than-life camaraderie rather than, say, guys on fire running in slow-motion. It's like The Expendables, if that movie only starred two guys, and both of them were rappers who didn't do any onscreen fighting."

500|$|Recalling {{the release}} of Sgt.

Schaffner said that in the context of 1967, the track [...] "was so visually evocative it seemed more like a film than a mere song". Richard Goldstein of The New York Times called the song [...] "a deadly earnest excursion in emotive music with a chilling lyric... stands {{as one of the most}} important Lennon-McCartney compositions… [...] an historic Pop event". In a contemporary music critics' poll published by Jazz & Pop magazine, [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] won in the categories of Best Pop Song and Best Pop Arrangement.|$|E
500|$|Wright also {{developed}} {{a reputation as a}} surveyor on land. He prepared [...] "a plat of part of the waye whereby a newe River may be brought from Uxbridge to St. James, Whitehall, Westminster [...] the Strand, St Giles, Holbourne and London", However, according to a 1615 paper in Latin in the annals of Gonville and Caius College, he was prevented from bringing this plan to fruition [...] "by the <b>tricks</b> <b>of</b> others". Nonetheless, early {{in the first decade of}} the 17th century, he was appointed by Sir Hugh Myddelton as surveyor to the New River project, which successfully directed the course of a new man-made channel to bring clean water from Chadwell Spring at Ware, Hertfordshire, to Islington, London. Although the distance in a straight line from Ware to London is only slightly more than , the project required a high degree of surveying skill on Wright's part as it was necessary for the river to take a route of over 40miles following the [...] contour line on the west side of the Lea Valley. As the technology of the time did not extend to large pumps or pipes, the water flow had to depend on gravity through canals or aqueducts over an average fall of 5.5inches a mile (approximately 8.7centimetres per kilometre).|$|E
500|$|In The Observer, Tony Palmer {{wrote that}} [...] "if {{there is still}} any doubt that Lennon and McCartney are the {{greatest}} songwriters since Schubert", the album [...] "should surely see {{the last vestiges of}} cultural snobbery and bourgeois prejudice swept away in a deluge of joyful music making". Richard Goldstein of The New York Times considered the double album to be [...] "a major success" [...] and [...] "far more imaginative" [...] than Sgt. Pepper or Magical Mystery Tour, due to the band's improved songwriting and their relying less on the studio <b>tricks</b> <b>of</b> those earlier works. In The Sunday Times, Derek Jewell hailed it as [...] "the best thing in pop since Sgt. Pepper" [...] and concluded: [...] "Musically, there is beauty, horror, surprise, chaos, order. And that is the world; and that is what The Beatles are on about. Created by, creating for, their age." [...] Although he dismissed [...] "Revolution 9" [...] as a [...] "pretentious" [...] example of [...] "idiot immaturity", the NMEs Alan Smith declared [...] "God Bless You, Beatles!" [...] to the majority of the album. Jann Wenner of Rolling Stone called it [...] "the history and synthesis of Western music", and the group's best album yet. Wenner contended that they were allowed to appropriate other styles and traditions into rock music because their ability and identity were [...] "so strong that they make it uniquely theirs, and uniquely the Beatles. They are so good that they not only expand the idiom, but they are also able to penetrate it and take it further." ...|$|E
