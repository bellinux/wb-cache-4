5|$|On the microeconomic scale, {{companies}} have used telecommunications {{to help build}} global business empires. This is self-evident {{in the case of}} online retailer Amazon.com but, according to academic Edward Lenert, even the conventional retailer Walmart has benefited from better telecommunication infrastructure compared to its competitors. In cities throughout the world, home owners use their telephones to order and arrange a variety of home services ranging from pizza deliveries to electricians. Even relatively poor communities have been noted to use telecommunication to their advantage. In Bangladesh's Narshingdi district, isolated villagers use cellular phones to speak directly to wholesalers and arrange a better price for their goods. In Côte d'Ivoire, coffee growers share mobile phones to follow hourly variations in coffee prices and sell at <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>price.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} month, during 10–14 September 1960, the Baghdad Conference {{was held}} at the initiative of Tariki, Pérez Alfonzo, and Iraqi prime minister Abd al-Karim Qasim, whose country had skipped the 1959 congress. Government representatives from Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela met in Baghdad to discuss ways to increase the price of crude oil produced by their countries, and ways to respond to unilateral actions by the MOCs. Despite strong US opposition: [...] "Together with Arab and non-Arab producers, Saudi Arabia formed the Organization of Petroleum Export Countries (OPEC) to secure <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>price</b> available from the major oil corporations." [...] The Middle Eastern members originally called for OPEC headquarters to be in Baghdad or Beirut, but Venezuela argued for a neutral location, and so the organization chose Geneva, Switzerland. On 1 September 1965, OPEC moved to Vienna, Austria, after Switzerland declined to extend diplomatic privileges.|$|E
500|$|Belgrano {{maintained}} frequent {{discussions with}} the committee members of the Consulate, who were all merchants with strong interests involved in the monopolic commerce with Cadiz. He made many proposals, influenced by free trade ideas. By this time, Belgrano thought that [...] "The merchant must have freedom to buy where he can be best accommodated, and it's natural that he does where {{he is supplied with}} <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>price</b> to be able to earn the best profit". Those proposals were rejected by the committee members; his only supporters were Juan José Castelli, Juan Larrea, and Domingo Matheu. However, Belgrano had some successes, such as creating the Nautical School, the Commerce School, and the Geometry and Drawing Academy. He created the Commerce School to influence future merchants to work towards {{the best interests of the}} nation, and the nautical and drawing ones to provide the youth with prestigious and lucrative careers. The schools were situated next to the Consulate so that Belgrano could easily supervise their development. The schools were in place for three years before they were closed by a ruling of Manuel Godoy, from the Spanish monarchy, who considered them an unnecessary luxury for a colony. It was felt that Buenos Aires might not be able to maintain them.|$|E

2500|$|One {{reason for}} high prices is that Fairtrade farmers {{have to sell}} through a monopsonist cooperative, which may be inefficient or corrupt – {{certainly}} some private traders are more efficient than some cooperatives. They cannot choose the buyer who offers <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>price,</b> or switch when their cooperative is going bankrupt {{if they wish to}} retain fairtrade status. There are also complaints that Fairtrade deviates from the free market ideal of some economists. Brink Lindsey calls fair trade a [...] "misguided attempt to make up for market failures" [...] encouraging market inefficiencies and overproduction.|$|E

2500|$|Reverse auction {{is a type}} of {{auction in}} which the roles of the buyer and the seller are reversed, with the primary {{objective}} to drive purchase prices downward. While ordinary auctions provide suppliers the opportunity to find <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>price</b> among interested buyers, reverse auctions give buyers a chance to find the lowest-price supplier. During a reverse auction, suppliers may submit multiple offers, usually as a response to competing suppliers’ offers, bidding down the price of a good or service to the lowest price they are willing to receive. By revealing the competing bids in real time to every participating supplier, reverse auctions promote “information transparency”. This, coupled with the dynamic bidding process, improves the chances of reaching the fair market value of the item.|$|E
2500|$|Ron Atkinson bought Lamptey to Aston Villa in {{the summer}} of 1994. This move came as a surprise, as PSV was a more {{successful}} club than Aston Villa at the time and Lamptey was one of the star players at PSV. However, on German TV (see below), Lamptey recalled that when he came to Europe, he had signed an exclusive marketing contract with an Italian player agent. Naive as he was, he thought that the agent would only act in his best interest. In fact, the player's agent (Antonio Caliendo) was [...] "a shady character who held Lamptey's transfer rights like a slave owner held his slave" [...] (quote by a fellow German player agent, and an opinion also supported by Lamptey's trainer Otto Pfister). He thought only of where to sell Lamptey for <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>price,</b> to bag ~25% of the transfer sum for himself, and so he sold him to Aston Villa. Too late Lamptey realized that the exclusive contract was a trap he could not flee. He failed to impress at Villa Park, scoring just three times, all of which came in the League Cup against Wigan Athletic (once in the home leg and twice in the away leg).|$|E
2500|$|During the 1640s and 1650s, the Beaver Wars {{initiated}} by the Iroquois forced a massive demographic shift as the western neighbors of the Haudenosaunee (better known as the Iroquois) fled the violence. They sought refuge west and north of Lake Michigan. The Five Nations of the Haudenosaunee, who had a predatory [...] attitude towards their neighbors even {{at the best of}} times, constantly raiding neighboring peoples in [...] "mourning wars" [...] in search of captives who would become Iroquois, were determined to be the only middlemen between the Europeans and the other Indians who lived in the West, and quite consciously set about eliminating any rivals as such as the Wendat (Huron). By the 1620s, the Iroquois had become dependent upon iron implements, which they obtained by trading fur with the Dutch at Fort Nassau (modern Albany, New York). Between 1624-1628, the Iroquois drove out their neighbors, the Mahican, to allow themselves to be the one people in the Hudson river valley able to trade with the Dutch. By 1640, the Five Nations had exhausted the supply of beavers in Kanienkeh ("the land of the flint"-the Iroquois name for their homeland in what is now upstate New York), and moreover Kanienkeh lacked the beavers with the thick pelts that the Europeans favored and would pay <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>price</b> for, which were to be found further north in what is now northern Canada.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} liquidity in {{an order}} driven market. We only investigate <b>the</b> <b>best</b> limits in <b>the</b> limit order book, but also {{take into account}} the book behind these inside prices. When subsequent prices are close to <b>the</b> <b>best</b> ones and depth at them is substantial, larger orders can be executed without an extensive price impact and without deterring liquidity. We develop and estimate several econometric models, based on depth and prices in the book, {{as well as on the}} slopes of the limit order book. The dynamics of different dimensions of liquidity are analyzed: prices, depth at and beyond <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>prices,</b> as well as resiliency, i. e. how fast the different liquidity measures recover after a liquidity shock. Our results show a somewhat less favorable image of liquidity than often found in the literature. After a liquidity shock (in the spread or depth or in the book beyond <b>the</b> <b>best</b> limits), several dimension of liquidity deteriorate at the same time. Not only does the inside spread increase, and depth at <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>prices</b> decrease, also <b>the</b> difference between subsequent bid and ask prices may become larger and depth provided at them decreases. The impacts are both econometrically and economically significant. Also, our findings point to an interaction between different measures of liquidity, between liquidity at <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>prices</b> and beyond in the book, and between ask and bid side of the market...|$|R

40|$|Traders {{using the}} {{electronic}} limit order {{book in the}} foreign exchange market can watch the posted price and depth of <b>the</b> <b>best</b> quotes change over the day. The authors use a structural errorcorrection model to examine {{the dynamics of the}} relationship between <b>the</b> <b>best</b> bid <b>price,</b> <b>the</b> <b>best</b> ask <b>price,</b> and their associated depths. They incorporate measures of the market depth behind <b>the</b> <b>best</b> quotes as regressors. They report four main findings. First, <b>best</b> <b>prices</b> and their associated depths are contemporaneously related to each other. More specifically, an increase in the ask (bid) price is associated with a drop (rise) in the ask (bid) depth. This suggests that sell traders avoid the adverse-selection risk of selling in a rising market. Second, when the spread-the error-correction term-widens, the bid price rises and the ask price drops, returning the spread to its long-term equilibrium value. Further, <b>the</b> <b>best</b> depth {{on both sides of the}} market drops, due to increased market uncertainty. Third, <b>the</b> lagged <b>best</b> depth impacts <b>the</b> <b>price</b> discovery on both sides of the market, with the effect being strongest on the same side of the market. Fourth, changes in the depth behind <b>the</b> <b>best</b> quotes impact both <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>prices</b> and quantities, even though those changes are unobservable to market participants.
