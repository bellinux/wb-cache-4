5|$|Whereas bismuth is most {{available}} <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> byproduct, its sustainability is {{more dependent}} on recycling. Bismuth is mostly a byproduct of the smelting of lead, and also of tungsten and copper production. Recycling bismuth is difficult in many of its end uses, primarily because of scattering.|$|E

5|$|In 1881 Barlow sat {{as member}} of the Wind Pressure (Railway Structures) Commission {{established}} at {{the recommendation of the}} Tay Bridge report. He led the design of the replacement Tay Bridge (188287) with his son Crawford Barlow as engineer. The new design used large monocoque piers to support a double railway track. The old brick and masonry piers from the first bridge were retained as breakwaters for the new piers upstream. They can still be seen <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> forlorn reminder of the tragedy of 1879.|$|E
5|$|Burt was {{generous in}} life and honored after death. His {{charitable}} giving to Saginaw during his lifetime was extensive, including funding the City Auditorium, the Burt Manual Training School, a women’s hospital, a Salvation Army and a YWCA that later became Jacobson’s. The town of Burt, Michigan is named for him, as is Burt Street in Saginaw, which borders the same block as his former home. The Burt Opera House in Taymouth Township carries his name and is still in use <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> community center. Trips on the paddle steamer Wellington R. Burt were once a popular day excursion along the Saginaw River (1876–1891). Burt {{was inducted into the}} Saginaw Hall of Fame in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Cookbooks, or more specifically, recipe collections, {{compiled}} in the Middle Ages {{are among}} the most important historical sources for medieval cuisine. The first cookbooks began to appear {{towards the end of the}} 13th century. The Liber de coquina, perhaps originating near Naples, and the Tractatus de modo preparandi have found a modern editor in Marianne Mulon, and a cookbook from Assisi found at Châlons-sur-Marne has been edited by Maguelonne Toussaint-Samat. Though it is assumed that they describe real dishes, food scholars do not believe they were used as cookbooks might be <b>today,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> step-by-step guide through the cooking procedure that could be kept at hand while preparing a dish. Few in a kitchen, at those times, would have been able to read, and working texts have a low survival rate.|$|E

5|$|In {{the centre}} of York, in St Helen's Square, there is the York branch of Bettys Café Tea Rooms. Bettys founder, Frederick Belmont, {{travelled}} on the maiden voyage of the Queen Mary in 1936. He was so impressed by the splendour of the ship that he employed the Queen Mary's designers and craftsmen to turn a dilapidated furniture store in York into an elegant café in St Helen's Square. A few years after Bettys opened in York war broke out, and the basement 'Bettys Bar' became a favourite haunt {{of the thousands of}} airmen stationed around York. 'Bettys Mirror', on which many of them engraved their signatures with a diamond pen, remains on display <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> tribute to them.|$|E

It became an outdoor education centre in 1971. It continues <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> residential centre, operated since 1996 by Gwent Outdoor Education Service, a joint service supported by the four local authorities of Blaenau Gwent, Monmouthshire, Newport and Torfaen. It caters mainly for school and college students on organised visits, and hosts activities such as orienteering and archery, with other activities such as canoeing and caving at nearby sites.|$|E
5|$|Since iron was {{becoming}} cheaper and more plentiful, it {{also became a}} major structural material following {{the building of the}} innovative first iron bridge in 1778. This bridge still stands <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> monument to the role iron played in the Industrial Revolution. Following this, iron was used in rails, boats, ships, aqueducts, and buildings, as well as in iron cylinders in steam engines. Railways have been central to the formation of modernity and ideas of progress and various languages (e.g. French, Spanish, Italien and German) refer to railways as iron road.|$|E

5|$|The Western Chalukyas {{developed}} an architectural style known <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> transitional style, an architectural {{link between the}} style of the early Chalukya dynasty and that of the later Hoysala empire. Most of its monuments are in the districts bordering the Tungabhadra River in central Karnataka. Well known examples are the Kasivisvesvara Temple at Lakkundi, the Mallikarjuna Temple at Kuruvatti, the Kallesvara Temple at Bagali and the Mahadeva Temple at Itagi. This was an important period in the development of fine arts in Southern India, especially in literature as the Western Chalukya kings encouraged writers in the native language Kannada, and Sanskrit.|$|E
5|$|The main turbine and boiler {{building}} {{is now a}} locally listed building, standing <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> monument to the important role that Tyne and Wear played {{in the development of}} electrical supply. The building had been considered for the more protected Listed Building status, but the decision was taken in May 2004 not to promote it. Other early power stations in the area (such as those at Dunston and Wallsend) have all been entirely demolished. The Lemington station is partly still standing due to riverside sites becoming less important to industrial development, leading to the site never being redeveloped.|$|E
5|$|The new {{management}} linked {{the line with}} an existing coastal railway via Saltburn, running north of the Eston Hills, and closed the line west of Guisborough in 1873 after only twelve years of service, though part of the line continued in service until 1966 as a freight route for a brickworks and carried passengers to Eston between 1902 and 1929. The NER constructed four passenger stations at {{the eastern end of}} the line in the 1870s. These were closed between 1958–1964 along with the section of the line from Guisborough to Brotton, but the easternmost part of the line is still in use <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> mineral railway.|$|E

5|$|William Heaven was {{succeeded by}} his son the Reverend Hudson Grosset Heaven who, thanks to a legacy from Sarah Langworthy (née Heaven), was able to fulfill his life's {{ambition}} of building a stone church on the island. St Helen's was completed in 1896, and stands <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> lasting memorial to the Heaven period. It has been designated by English Heritage a Grade II listed building. He {{is said to have}} been able to afford either a church or a new harbour. His choice of the church was not however in the best financial interests of the island. The unavailability of the money for re-establishing the family's financial soundness, coupled with disastrous investment and speculation in the early 20th century, caused severe financial hardship.|$|E
5|$|Aleppo {{underwent}} major {{transformations in}} the Ayyubid period, specifically {{during the reign}} of az-Zahir Ghazi. Ayyubid architectural achievements focused on four areas: the citadel, the waterworks, fortifications, and the extramural developments. The total rebuilding of the city enclosure began when az-Zahir Ghazi removed the vallum of Nur ad-Din—which by then outlived its temporary need—and rebuilt the northern and northwestern walls—the most susceptible to outside attack—from Bab al-Jinan to Bab al-Nasr. He parceled out the building of the towers on this stretch of the wall to his princes and military officers; each tower was identified with a particular prince who inscribed his name into it. Later, az-Zahir Ghazi extended the eastern wall to the south and east, reflecting his desire to incorporate a dilapidated fortress, Qala'at al-Sharif, outside the city into Aleppo's enclosure. Bab Qinnasrin was completely rebuilt by an-Nasir Yusuf in 1256. This gate stands <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> masterpiece of medieval Syrian military architecture. Cumulatively, Ayyubid architecture left a lasting impression in Aleppo. The citadel was rebuilt, the water network was expanded, and streets and quarters were provided fountains and baths. In addition, dozens of shrines, mosques, madrasas, and mausoleums were built throughout the city.|$|E
5|$|Post {{is where}} {{mainstream}} music could have gone. While modern chart music hasn't gone there entirely, Björk {{opened up the}} space for a more enigmatic and less readily labelled style; she undoubtedly helped broaden the playing field. Modern music still, regularly, finds itself, like a dinosaur stuck in a tar pit, going nowhere and heading for extinction. Yet, there are pockets of air that artists like Björk - and those before her like Kate Bush - have pumped full of oxygen for the next generations of rare, raw and intense female talents - the Lordes and Sias of the world - to breath. In this way, the album title is a misnomer. Björk was a precursor rather than a late comer, less post than pre. Post stands <b>today</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> body of work that still informs the more marginal artistic fringes of modern music and reminds us how narrow and staid our world would be without outliers like Björk.|$|E
