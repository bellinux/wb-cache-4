5|$|Monitoring {{this from}} afar, and {{dissatisfied}} with Dohna's <b>timidity</b> in bringing Saltykov to battle, Frederick sent Carl Heinrich von Wedel to take command. Wedel arrived on 20 July {{and established a}} blocking position at Züllichau. This would prevent the Russians from entering Prussian territory and reaching the Oder. He wanted to attack the Russians at dawn the next day, but could not find an appropriately weak location in the Russian defenses.|$|E
5|$|Neville Longbottom is a plump, diffident boy, so forgetful {{that his}} {{grandmother}} {{gives him a}} Remembrall, although he cannot remember why. Neville's magical abilities are weak and appeared {{just in time to}} save his life when he was eight. Despite his <b>timidity,</b> Neville will fight anyone after some encouragement or if he thinks it is right and important.|$|E
5|$|Mobutu {{accused the}} MPLA, Cuban and Soviet governments of {{complicity}} in the war. While Neto did support the FNLC, the MPLA government's support came in response to Mobutu's continued support for Angola's FNLA The Carter Administration, unconvinced of Cuban involvement, responded by offering a meager $15million-worth of non-military aid. American <b>timidity</b> during the war prompted a shift in Zaire's foreign policy towards greater engagement with France, which became Zaire's largest supplier of arms after the intervention. Neto and Mobutu signed a border agreement on 22 July 1977.|$|E

60|$|Doubtless all small towns, in all countries, in all ages, Carol admitted, have a {{tendency}} to be not only dull but mean, bitter, infested with curiosity. In France or Tibet quite as much as in Wyoming or Indiana these <b>timidities</b> are inherent in isolation.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was by my {{wrestling with}} the champions of Talofa that I first {{interested}} her. It was by my prowess at swimming that I awoke her. And it was by a certain swimming deed that I won from her more than coquettish smiles and shy <b>timidities</b> of feigned retreat.|$|R
5|$|The modern Saluki has {{retained}} qualities of hunting hounds and may seem reserved to strangers. The often independent and aloof breed {{may be difficult}} to train. Training methods should always be gentle and patient. Salukis may bore easily and are not an ideal breed to leave unattended for long periods. The Saluki does not typically enjoy rough games or activities such as retrieving balls. Early socialization will help prevent <b>timidity</b> and shyness in later life. Given its hunting instincts, the dog is prone to chasing moving objects.|$|E
5|$|On {{a flight}} {{home from a}} {{business}} trip, the Narrator meets Tyler Durden, a soap salesman with whom he begins to converse after noticing the two share {{the same kind of}} briefcase. After the flight, the Narrator returns home to find that his apartment has been destroyed by an explosion. With no one else to contact, he calls Tyler, and they meet at a bar. After a conversation about consumerism, outside the bar, Tyler chastises the Narrator for his <b>timidity</b> about needing a place to stay. Tyler requests that the Narrator hit him, which leads the two to engage in a fistfight. The Narrator moves into Tyler's home, a large dilapidated house in an industrial area of their city. They have further fights outside the bar on subsequent nights, and these fights attract growing crowds of men. The fighting eventually moves to the bar's basement where the men form a club ("Fight Club") which routinely meets only to provide an opportunity for the men to fight recreationally.|$|E
5|$|The first Venetian {{operation}} {{was an attempt}} to blockade the Dardanelles in 1646. To interdict the supplies headed to the Ottoman forces in Crete, a force of 23 Venetian ships under Tommaso Morosini scoured the Aegean for Ottoman shipping, and attempted to capture the strategically important island of Tenedos at the entrance of the Dardanelles. The Kapudan Pasha Koca Musa led a fleet of 80 warships against the Venetians, but his fleet was driven back into the Dardanelles on 26 May. However, the blockading fleet was unable to stop the next exit of the Ottoman fleet on 4 June, when the lack of wind enabled the Ottoman galleys to evade the Venetian sailing ships. The Ottomans were thus able to land new troops and supplies on Crete unopposed. The efforts of the Venetian fleet to counter the Ottoman land operations in Crete likewise failed, through a combination of <b>timidity</b> on behalf of their commanders, the delays in payment for the crews, and the effects of a widespread plague.|$|E
60|$|The Conductor told me {{of another}} herdswoman from whom he had once asked his road while he was yet new to the country, and who fled from him, driving her beasts before her, until {{he had given up}} the {{information}} in despair. A tale of old lawlessness may yet be read in these uncouth <b>timidities.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Manchester Guardian responded differently: [...] "The obvious {{meaning of}} this {{resolution}} is youth's deep disgust with {{the way in which}} past wars for 'King and Country' have been made, and in which, they suspect, future wars may be made; disgust at the national hypocrisy which can fling over the <b>timidities</b> and follies of politicians, over base greeds and communal jealousies and jobbery, the cloak of an emotional symbol they did not deserve".|$|R
60|$|And {{there was}} the glory of {{mounting}} also. One by one the formidable mesas of calculations, conjugations, argumentations, fell below her feet, and Rose grew tall in intellectual grace. She had no mental <b>timidities.</b> Truth with her came first, or if not first, certainly she had little superstitious sentiment {{to stand in the}} way. She was still the same impatient soul as when she shook her little fist at the Almighty's lightning.|$|R
25|$|By mid-1933, the Great Depression and {{conservative}} leadership {{had left the}} AA with only 5,000 members and less than $30,000 in the bank. Union president Michael F. Tighe, 76, {{was referred to as}} 'Grandmother' due to his advanced age and <b>timidity.</b>|$|E
25|$|When she {{was three}} years old, Clara Barton was sent to school with her brother Stephen, where she excelled in reading and spelling. At school, she became close friends with Nancy Fitts; {{she is the only}} known friend Clara Barton had as a child due to her extreme <b>timidity.</b>|$|E
25|$|It {{was about}} the same time, 1792, that the unaccountable sadness of his life and his <b>timidity</b> moved the {{compassion}} of 24-year-old Renée-Françoise-Adélaïde Le Monnier, daughter of his friend, the astronomer Pierre Charles Le Monnier. She insisted on marrying him, and proved a devoted wife to whom he became warmly attached.|$|E
60|$|As I {{look back}} upon all that time--across a gulf of fifteen active years--I find I {{see it with}} an {{understanding}} judgment. I see {{it as if it}} were the business of some one else--indeed of two other people--intimately known yet judged without passion. I see now that this shock, this sudden immense disillusionment, did in real fact bring out a mind and soul in Marion; that for the first time she emerged from habits, <b>timidities,</b> imitations, phrases and a certain narrow will-impulse, and became a personality.|$|R
60|$|It seems {{strange that}} he should have been there to watch our going so carefully. Without wishing to treat with levity the just <b>timidities</b> of Imperialists all the world over, I may allow myself the {{reflection}} that a woman, practically condemned by the doctors, and a small boy not quite six years old could not be regarded as seriously dangerous even for the largest of conceivable empires saddled with the most sacred of responsibilities. And this good man, I believe, did not think so either.|$|R
60|$|The Hintock woods {{owned by}} Mrs. Charmond were {{presently}} left behind, and those into which she next plunged were divided from the latter by a bank, from whose top the hedge {{had long ago}} perished--starved for want of sun. It was with some caution that Grace now walked, though she was quite free {{from any of the}} commonplace <b>timidities</b> of her ordinary pilgrimages to such spots. She feared no lurking harms, but that her effort would be all in vain, and her return to the house rendered imperative.|$|R
25|$|Rubinstein warned his {{students}} continually {{to guard against}} <b>timidity,</b> not to stop at a difficult place in a composition but to leave it and press ahead. He also encouraged them to write in sketches with indications of whatever form in which that piece would be written and to avoid composing at the piano. Notable students include pianist Sandra Drouker.|$|E
25|$|The {{plan is a}} success, and Canute's {{previous}} <b>timidity</b> {{is replaced}} with a strong kingly spirit. The prince brings both Thorkell and the remnants of Askeladd's forces under his command, {{and returns to the}} Danish headquarters. He there confronts his father, who had resolved to murder Canute and give the right of succession to his brother Prince Harald. Canute successfully matches his father in a battle of wills and his life is spared, but Harald remains the king's heir. Together, Canute, Thorkell, and Askeladd devise a plot to assassinate the king and seize the crown.|$|E
25|$|The Confederates did not press {{an attack}} after Col. John A. Washington, of Lee's staff, was killed during a {{reconnaissance}} of the Union right. Reynolds was so {{confident in the}} face of such <b>timidity</b> that he dispatched two of his own regiments from Elk Water up the mountain road to relieve the supposedly besieged fortress garrison, but the arriving Union reinforcements were unnecessary. Lee called off the attack and, after maneuvering in the vicinity, withdrew to Valley Mountain on September 17. Reynolds, meanwhile, planned an offensive against the Confederate forces stationed at the Greenbrier River.|$|E
60|$|For {{the better}} part of an hour he did this, {{returning}} always to the door that would not open. Then he achieved a definite idea. Since the door would not open, and since Steward and Kwaque did not return, he would go in search of them. Once with this concept of action clear in his brain, without <b>timidities</b> of hesitation and irresolution, he trotted aft down the long hall. Going around the right angle in which it ended, he encountered a narrow flight of steps. Among many scents, he recognized those of Kwaque and Steward and knew they had passed that way.|$|R
60|$|He then {{proceeded}} to construct an extemporary fireplace of loose stones, and to put together chips and shavings for the fire,--in which work little Mara eagerly assisted; but the fire was crackling and burning cheerily long before Sally appeared with her clams, and so the Captain, {{with a pile of}} hemlock boughs by his side, sat on a stone feeding the fire leisurely from time to time with crackling boughs. Now was the time for Mara to make her inquiries; her heart beat, she knew not why, for she was full of those little <b>timidities</b> and shames that so often embarrass children in their attempts to get at the meanings of things in this great world, where they are such ignorant spectators.|$|R
60|$|And {{there was}} more that passed through her mind--sensations of {{tiredness}} and loneliness; trampling squadrons and shadowy armies of vague feelings and vaguer prompting; and deeper and dimmer whisperings and echoings, the flutterings of forgotten generations crystallized into being and fluttering anew and always, undreamed and unguessed, subtle and potent, the spirit and essence of life that under a thousand deceits and masks forever makes for life. It was a strong temptation, just to ride with this man in the hills. It would be that only and nothing more, for she was firmly convinced that his way of life could never be her way. On the other hand, she was vexed by none of the ordinary feminine fears and <b>timidities.</b> That she {{could take care of}} herself under any and all circumstances she never doubted. Then why not? It was such a little thing, after all.|$|R
25|$|The term shyness may be {{implemented}} as a lay blanket-term {{for a family}} of related and partially overlapping afflictions, including <b>timidity</b> (apprehension in meeting new people), bashfulness and diffidence (reluctance in asserting oneself), apprehension and anticipation (general fear of potential interaction), or intimidation (relating to the object of fear rather than one's low confidence). Apparent shyness, as perceived by others, may simply be the manifestation of reservation or introversion, character traits which cause an individual to voluntarily avoid excessive social contact or be terse in communication, but are not motivated or accompanied by discomfort, apprehension, or lack of confidence.|$|E
25|$|Meade was {{hampered}} {{during the}} retreat and pursuit {{not only by}} his alleged <b>timidity</b> and his willingness to defer to the cautious judgment of his subordinate commanders, but because his army was exhausted. The advance to Gettysburg was swift and tiring, followed by the largest battle of the war. The pursuit of Lee was physically demanding, through inclement weather and over difficult roads much longer than his opponent's. Enlistments expired, causing depletion of his ranks, as did the New York Draft Riots, which occupied thousands of men that could have reinforced the Army of the Potomac.|$|E
25|$|After Maitland {{became ill}} in September, he was {{replaced}} in turn by Generals John Mackenzie, William Henry Clinton, James Campbell, and John Murray, 8th Baronet. The last-named general repulsed Suchet's attack at the Battle of Castalla on 13 April 1813, but the overcautious Murray withdrew after his victory. At the prompting of Wellington, Murray mounted a sea-borne attack in June. In the Siege of Tarragona, Murray's <b>timidity</b> {{caused him to}} pass up a chance to conquer the weakly defended port. Fearing relief efforts by Suchet and General of Division David-Maurice-Joseph Mathieu de La Redorte, he ordered a hasty retreat, needlessly abandoning 18 heavy siege cannons. Murray was immediately superseded by Lord Bentinck.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't remember, but I daresay you're right," [...] Miriam coldly meditated. [...] "What I accused you of {{then was}} {{probably}} simply what I reproach you with now--the germ {{at least of}} your deplorable weakness. You consider that we do awfully valuable work, and yet you wouldn't for the world let people suppose you really take our side. If your position was even at that time so false, so much the worse for you, that's all. Oh it's refreshing," [...] his formidable friend exclaimed after a pause during which Peter seemed to himself to taste the full bitterness of despair, so baffled and cheapened he intimately felt--"oh it's refreshing {{to see a man}} burn his ships in a cause that appeals to him, give up something precious for it and break with horrid <b>timidities</b> and snobberies! It's the most beautiful sight in the world." ...|$|R
60|$|His sensations habitually shaped {{themselves}} {{in accordance with}} those two permanent requirements of his nature, liking for adventure, and hatred of tyranny. The labourer who beat his wife, the shopman who sweated his 'hands,' the parson who consigned his parishioners to hell, the peer who rode roughshod--all were equally odious to him. He thought of people as individuals, and it was, as it were, by accident that he had conceived the class generalization which he had fired back at Miltoun from Mrs. Noel's window. Sanguine, accustomed to queer environments, and always catching at the moment as it flew, he had not to fight with the <b>timidities</b> and irritations of a nervous temperament. His cheery courtesy was only disturbed when he became conscious of some sentiment which appeared to him mean or cowardly. On such occasions, not perhaps infrequent, his face looked as if his heart were physically fuming, and since his shell of stoicism was never quite melted by this heat, a very peculiar expression was the result, a sort of calm, sardonic, desperate, jolly look.|$|R
60|$|My {{convictions}} crystallised {{more and}} more definitely upon this. The more of love and fine thinking the better for men, I said; the less, the worse. And upon this fresh basis I set myself to examine what I as a politician might do. I perceived I was at last finding an adequate expression for all that was in me, for those forces that had rebelled at the crude presentations of Bromstead, at the secrecies and suppressions of my youth, at the dull unrealities of City Merchants, at the conventions and <b>timidities</b> of the Pinky Dinkys, at the philosophical recluse of Trinity and the phrases and tradition-worship of my political associates. None of these things were half alive, and I wanted life to be intensely alive and awake. I wanted thought like an edge of steel and desire like a flame. The real work before mankind now, I realised once and for all, is the enlargement of human expression, the release and intensification of human thought, the vivider utilisation of experience and the invigoration of research--and whatever one does in human affairs has or lacks value as it helps or hinders that.|$|R
25|$|In 2006, he {{expressed}} {{his view of}} the Democratic Party::But what do I have to say about the Democratic Party? I’m ashamed, really, of how little leadership there has been. There has been just tremendous <b>timidity</b> {{on the part of the}} party, generally, although there have been a handful of exceptions. But, you know, we had one member of the United States Senate vote against the PATRIOT Act, the blank check that was given by Congress to this president, I think in total abrogation of the role of Congress under separation of powers and under the power to make war, to declare war. They gave that away to a president that didn’t have his facts straight and, I think, was manipulating the intelligence to sell this war.|$|E
25|$|After {{the defeat}} at Thacia, Sergius was {{relieved}} and Areobindus replaced him. At this time, the ambitious Byzantine dux of Numidia, Guntharic contacted the various Berber leaders {{in a bid}} to unseat Areobindus. Antalas was promised the rule of Byzacena, half the treasure of Areobindus and 1,500 Byzantine troops as his command. In order to increase pressure on Areobindus, the Berbers and the renegade followers of Stotzas approached Carthage. At the same time, Areobindus himself had secret contacts with another Berber leader, Cutzinas, leader of the Numidian Berbers. Cutzinas had promised to murder Antalas once battle was joined, but Guntharic revealed this plan to Antalas. In the event, due to Areobindus' <b>timidity,</b> a battle did not take place; in March Guntharic seized Carthage and murdered Areobindus.|$|E
25|$|Because of his Scottish nationalism, and {{criticism}} of the Labour Party's <b>timidity</b> and lack of socialist zeal, Graham has been effectively written out of Labour Party history, and the belief has been circulated that after his electoral defeat in 1892, he retired from politics until the late 1920s. This is entirely incorrect; in fact, between 1905 and 1914, Graham, while retaining the position of elder statesman, social commentator, and renowned world-traveller, became more militant, involving himself in many left wing causes and protests. There is {{evidence to suggest that}} he joined the hard-left British Socialist Party, and he was an associate of anarchists and a political assasin. Graham was also a vociferous anti-imperialist at the height of British jingoism, a high-profile supporter of the women's suffrage movement, and Home Rule for Ireland and India.|$|E
60|$|He {{had learned}} from Jacob Boehme and from old alchemist writers that {{imagination}} was the first emanation of divinity, 'the body of God,' 'the Divine members,' and he drew the deduction, which they did not draw, that the imaginative arts were therefore the greatest of Divine revelations, and that the sympathy with all living things, sinful and righteous alike, which the imaginative arts awaken, is that forgiveness of sins commanded by Christ. The reason, and by the reason he meant deductions from the observations of the senses, binds us to mortality because it binds us to the senses, and divides us from each other by showing us our clashing interests; but imagination divides us from mortality by the immortality of beauty, and binds us to each other by opening the secret doors of all hearts. He cried {{again and again that}} every thing that lives is holy, and that nothing is unholy except things that do not live--lethargies, and cruelties, and <b>timidities,</b> and that denial of imagination which is the root they grew from in old times. Passions, because most living, are most holy--and this was a scandalous paradox in his time--and man shall enter eternity borne upon their wings.|$|R

"War," [...] {{he said in}} {{his great}} whisper, putting his big hand on my {{shoulder}} but making no further attempt to arise, [...] "I'm going {{to put an end to}} war--to any sort of war! And all these things that must end. The world is beautiful, life is great and splendid, we had only to lift up our eyes and see. Think of the glories through which we have been driving, like a herd of swine in a garden place. The color in life--the sounds--the shapes! We have had our jealousies, our quarrels, our ticklish rights, our invincible prejudices, our vulgar enterprise and sluggish <b>timidities,</b> we have chattered and pecked one another and fouled the world--like daws in the temple, like unclean birds in the holy place of God. All my life has been foolishness and pettiness, gross pleasures and mean discretions--all. I am a meagre dark thing in this morning's glow, a penitence, a shame! And, but for God's mercy, I might have died this night--like that poor lad there--amidst the squalor of my sins! No more of this! No more of this!--whether the whole world has changed or no, matters nothing. WE TWO HAVE SEEN THIS DAWN! [...] ." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{now without}} in the {{twilight}} behold Mr. Hoopdriver, his cheeks hot, his eye bright! His brain is in a tumult. The nervous, obsequious Hoopdriver, to whom I introduced you some days since, has undergone a wonderful change. Ever since he lost that 'spoor' in Chichester, he has been tormented by the most horrible visions of the shameful insults that may be happening. The strangeness of new surroundings has been working to strip off the habitual servile from him. Here was moonlight rising over {{the memory of a}} red sunset, dark shadows and glowing orange lamps, beauty somewhere mysteriously rapt away from him, tangible wrong in a brown suit and an unpleasant face, flouting him. Mr. Hoopdriver for the time, was in the world of Romance and Knight-errantry, divinely forgetful of his social position or hers; forgetting, too, for the time any of the wretched <b>timidities</b> that had tied him long since behind the counter in his proper place. He was angry and adventurous. It was all about him, this vivid drama he had fallen into, and it was eluding him. He was far too grimly in earnest to pick up that lost thread and make a play of it now. The man was living. He did not pose when he alighted at the coffee tavern even, nor when he made his hasty meal.|$|R
