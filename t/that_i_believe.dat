25|$|There were {{selective}} {{portions of}} al-Fadl's testimony <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> was false, {{to help support}} the picture that he helped the Americans join together. I think he lied {{in a number of}} specific testimony about a unified image of what this organization was. It made al-Qaeda the new Mafia or the new Communists. It made them identifiable as a group and therefore made it easier to prosecute any person associated with al-Qaeda for any acts or statements made by bin Laden.|$|E
25|$|Yeah sure, we see {{ourselves}} as a metal band, but without boundaries and limitations to our sound. We do not necessarily belong to a certain subgenre within metal. We're just playing dark and heavy music and keeping an open mind to evolve and being true to ourselves. I'm proud to say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> KATATONIA sounds like no other band. We have eloquently avoided the gothic metal genre most bands tend to fall in when changing their sound from doom/death metal to something more rocking and melodic. We're leaning towards more of a contemporary alternative sound, free of all cheese and clichés.|$|E
25|$|That you say as {{a theologian}} that I am a universalist is evident, {{in the sense}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> that Jesus was sent into the world to save the sinners that we all are. This is what I {{understand}} Saint Paul to say when he mentions that sin has entered the world through one man, Adam, and spread to all men, and that he calls Jesus the second Adam through Whom redemption entered the world for all men, and even as he says 'all of creation,' that the redemption of Christ is the victory of God over the Fall. I believe that this great plan of salvation is universal, concerns not only all men but the universality {{of the world and}} that Jesus on the Cross has accomplished this Salvation, this reconciliation of men with God, that the 'chastisement' as Isaiah says is fallen upon Him to free men from the malediction of the Fall. This plan of God therefore seems to be collective, global, universal.|$|E

25|$|It {{is inconceivable}} that inanimate brute matter should, without the {{mediation}} of something else which is not material, operate upon and affect other matter, without mutual contact, as it must do if gravitation {{in the sense of}} Epicurus be essential and inherent in it. And this is one reason why I desired you would not ascribe 'innate gravity' to me. That gravity should be innate, inherent, and essential to matter, so that one body may act upon another at a distance, through a vacuum, without {{the mediation of}} anything else, by and through which their action and force may be conveyed from one to another, is to me so great an absurdity, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> no man who has in philosophical matters a competent faculty of thinking can ever fall into it. Gravity must be caused by an agent acting constantly according to certain laws; but whether this agent be material or immaterial, I have left to the consideration of my readers.|$|E
25|$|When such a {{complete}} convulsion has shaken the State, and hardly left any thing whatsoever, either in civil arrangements, {{or in the}} Characters and disposition of men's minds, exactly where it was, whatever shall be settled although in the former persons and upon old forms, will be in some measure a new thing and will labour under something of the weakness {{as well as other}} inconveniences of a Change. My poor opinion is that you mean to establish what you call 'L'ancien Régime,' If any one means that system of Court Intrigue miscalled a Government as it stood, at Versailles before the present confusions as the thing to be established, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> will be found absolutely impossible; and if you consider the Nature, as well of persons, as of affairs, I flatter myself you must be of my opinion. That was tho' not so violent a State of Anarchy as well as the present. If it were even possible to lay things down exactly as they stood, before the series of experimental politicks began, I am quite sure that they could not long continue in that situation. In one Sense of L'Ancien Régime I am clear that nothing else can reasonably be done.|$|E

500|$|Blyton's {{range of}} plots and {{settings}} {{has been described}} as limited and continually recycled. Responding to claims that her moral views were [...] "dependably predictable", Blyton commented that [...] "most of you could write down perfectly correctly all the things <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> in and stand for– you have found them in my books, and a writer's books are always a faithful reflection of himself". Many of her books were critically assessed by teachers and librarians, deemed unfit for children to read, and removed from syllabuses and public libraries.|$|E
500|$|Events took a {{different}} course. Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten, the Supreme Allied Commander, South East Asia Command (SEAC), had need of a new chief of staff owing to the poor health of Lieutenant-General Henry Pownall. Brooke turned down Mountbatten's initial request for either Lieutenant-General Archibald Nye or Lieutenant-General John Swayne. Brooke then offered Browning for the post, and Mountbatten accepted. Pownall considered that Browning was [...] "excellently qualified" [...] for the post, although he had no staff college training and had never held a staff job before. Pownall noted that his [...] "only reservation is <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> [...] is rather nervy and highly strung". For his services as a corps commander, Browning was mentioned in despatches a second time, and was awarded the Legion of Merit {{in the degree of}} Commander by the United States government.|$|E
500|$|Wenger praised his team's {{character}} and told reporters: [...] "We were very frustrated last year. We {{have shown a}} lot of strength {{to come back here}} – beating Liverpool and Newcastle on the way." [...] He was adamant Arsenal would win the league the following Wednesday: [...] "This team knows how to win. I said three or four months ago that we will win the championship and the FA Cup. They really want to do it. And we will do it." [...] The goalscorers Parlour and Ljungberg both agreed winning at any cost was most important on the day, after the misery of the 2001 final. Ranieri described the first half as tactical, but admitted once Arsenal had scored, Chelsea struggled to make a comeback. He justified his decision to include Hasselbaink, saying [...] "He is a great striker and a danger to the opposition." [...] Lampard credited Arsenal's mental strength: [...] "They can win when they are not playing particularly well. We need to find that consistency and if we can do <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> we will be up there with them soon." [...] He was pleased with his own performance against Vieira and hoped he did enough to be included in England's World Cup squad.|$|E

500|$|The band's {{follow-up}} single, [...] "Get Me to the World on Time", {{which put}} distorted sound effects to a psychedelic-tinged Bo Diddley beat, {{was released in}} May 1967. The song managed to chart at number 27 in the US and number 42 in the UK, and was the most electronically experimental composition by the group thus far. When {{it came time for}} The Electric Prunes to record songs for their first album, they were limited musically due to the predominate presence of Tucker and Mantz's (also Jill Jones) songwriting partnership, which composed the majority of the album's material. The group's debut album, The Electric Prunes possessed exotically-combined effects, and violin-like guitar riffs, mixed with a diverse, and somewhat uneven, selection of pop songs, with only [...] "Train For Tomorrow" [...] and [...] "Luvin'" [...] being penned by the band. Tracks such as the soft rock tune, [...] "Onie" [...] and [...] "Toonerville Trolley" [...] suggest inconsistency in an attempt to produce a commercially viable sound. Reflecting on the album, Tulin said, [...] "Consequently there are definitely songs <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> do not belong on the album and were, in fact, a waste of our time and energy. There were several other ideas we were working on, but [...] realized there was no use pursuing them because they too would have been 'too weird.'" ...|$|E
500|$|On 20 March 1976, Smith gave a {{televised}} speech including what became his most quoted utterance. [...] "I don't believe in majority rule ever in Rhodesia—not in 1,000 years," [...] he said. [...] "I repeat <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> in {{blacks and whites}} working together. If one day it is white {{and the next day}} it is black, I believe we have failed {{and it will be a}} disaster for Rhodesia." [...] The first sentence of this statement became commonly quoted as evidence that Smith was a crude racist who would never compromise with the black nationalists, even though the speech was one in which Smith had said that power-sharing with black Rhodesians was inevitable and that [...] "we have got to accept that in the future Rhodesia is a country for black and white, not white as opposed to black and vice versa". The [...] "not in 1,000 years" [...] comment was, according to Peter Godwin, an attempt to reassure the RF's right wing, which opposed any transition whatsoever, that white Rhodesians would not be sold out. In her 1978 biography of Smith, Berlyn comments that regardless of whether the statement was [...] "taken out of context, or whether his actual intent was misinterpreted", this was one of his greatest blunders as Prime Minister as it gave obvious ammunition to his detractors.|$|E
500|$|One {{method was}} by {{introducing}} overarching themes that individual episodes could be tied to, such as [...] "The Pattern" [...] in Season 1, providing information repeatedly about the larger plot {{over the course}} of several episodes or seasons. Abrams also created characters whose alliances to the larger narrative were clear, avoiding a similar problem that had occurred during the first and second seasons of Alias. [...] A final step taken was to script out all of the major long-running plot elements, including the show's finale, prior to full-time production. [...] Abrams contrasted this to the process used in Lost, where ideas like character flashbacks and the hatch from the second season were introduced haphazardly and made difficulties in defining when they should be presented to the viewers. Instead, with Fringe, they were able to create [...] "clearly defined goalposts" [...] (in Itzkoff's words) that could be altered as necessary with network and seasonal changes but always provided a clear target for the overarching plot. These approaches also allowed the team to introduce unique plot elements to be introduced in time that would have altered the show's fate if known at the start. Abrams stated that [...] "There are certain details that are hugely important <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe,</b> if shared, will destroy any chance of actually getting on the air." [...] Abrams noted that they are able to benefit from [...] "how open Fox as a network has been to a show that is embracing the weirdness and the long-term stories that we want to tell". During the third season, executive producer Jeff Pinkner noted that [...] "We have six to eight seasons worth of material. We see it as having certain chapters that would enrich the overall story, but aren't necessary to tell the overall story. God willing, the network allows us the time to tell our complete story." ...|$|E

500|$|IGN's Matt Fowler {{wrote in}} his review, [...] "At this point, {{it seems like the}} pattern {{when it comes to the}} ninth episode of a given season of Game of Thrones is tragic death, amazing battle, tragic death, amazing battle, and so on. And this being Season 6, it was time to land on a phenomenal clash of swords and shields - and 'Battle of the Bastards' {{certainly}} delivered." [...] He continued, [...] "Game of Thrones did not disappoint when it came to this season's great northern battle, as Jon and Sansa's differences were spectacularly highlighted in a savagely strong war chapter that saw House Stark overcome huge odds to reclaim their home. Plus, Daenerys got to soar, as her dragons quickly stopped a violent siege with fury and fire." [...] Fowler gave the episode a top score of 10. Jeremy Egner of The New York Times also praised the episode: [...] "As directed by Miguel Sapochnik, who also oversaw last season's terrific 'Hardhome' episode, the lengthy sequence was terrifying, gripping and exhilarating, sometimes all at once, a sweeping display of all the different ways one can die on the battlefield." [...] Egner called Ramsay's death an episode highlight ("Ramsay Bolton's demise was arguably the most eagerly anticipated death ever on Game of Thrones and the show handled it with flair, dispatching him in a poetic, canine-fueled fashion that was no less satisfying for being telegraphed early on"), and concluded about Daenerys's scene: [...] "Daenerys Stormborn had a few words for the slave masters who launched their attack last week. Those words included 'surrender or die' and 'thanks for the ships', as we saw another thrilling action sequence <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> reunited the dragon triplets for the first time since they were quite young." [...] Myles McNutt of The A.V. Club {{wrote in his}} review, [...] "This battle works as a climactic moment for Game of Thrones as a cultural event, selling us on the scale and ambition of the producers and their production teams, all who should be commended for the accomplishments from a technical perspective." [...] According to James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly, [...] "Was this the show's best episode? It's hard to immediately process that question. Maybe? Probably. It's almost certainly the most exciting hour and had the most jaw-dropping battle sequence we've seen yet on TV." ...|$|E
