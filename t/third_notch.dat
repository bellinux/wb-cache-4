6000|$|Antoine at once {{stepped forward}} with his Alpine axe, and, {{swinging}} it vigorously over his head, cut a deep notch on the sloping {{side of the}} neck of ice. Beyond it he cut a second notch. No man--not even a monkey--could have stood on the glassy slope which descended into the abyss at their side; but Antoine, putting {{one foot in the}} first notch, and the other in the second, stood as secure {{as if he had been}} on a flat rock. Again he swung his axe, and planted his foot in a <b>third</b> <b>notch,</b> swinging his axe the instant it was fixed for the purpose of cutting the fourth. Thus, cut by cut and step by step, he passed over to the block of ice aimed at. It was but a short neck. A few notches were sufficient, yet without an axe to cut these notches, the place had been absolutely impassable. It was by no means a [...] "dangerous" [...] place, according to the ideas of Alpine mountaineers, nevertheless a slip, or the loss of balance, would have been followed by contain death. Antoine knew this, and, like a wise guide, took proper precautions.|$|E

5000|$|In a July 2016 review, Flying {{magazine}} writer Pia Bergqvist generally {{praised the}} aircraft, but found fault with the flap mechanism and resulting pitch changes with flap deployment. She wrote, [...] "One thing {{that takes a}} bit of getting used to is the flap mechanism. Flaps are adjusted with a large handle in the upper left corner of the cockpit. The location of the handle {{makes it easy to}} access, and each flap setting is in a notch to prevent slippage. To get the first flap in position, you have to push slightly forward before grabbing the trigger to release the latch. For the second and <b>third</b> <b>notches,</b> however, you need to pull back before the handle will release. It took a few approaches {{to get used to the}} opposite action. The new slotted flap design allows for air from the underside of the wing to flow over the flap surface. With the additional lift, the pitch increases a great deal with each flap setting. president Randy Lervold advised me to fly with some nose-down trim before adding flaps. Without using that technique, retrimming was definitely required after each notch to prevent going too slow." ...|$|R

The biosensor has been realized by bonding the DMTL device with an acrylic fluidic channel. In order to demonstrate the sensing mechanism, the sensor is used to detect the small variation of the concentration of aqueous glucose solutions by measuring the electromagnetic resonant frequency shift of the device. It is observed from the results that the second notch of the reflection coefficient (S- 11) varies from 7. 66 to 7. 93 GHz and the <b>third</b> <b>notch</b> of the reflection coefficient varies from 15. 81 to 15. 24 GHz when the concentration of the glucose solution ranges from 0 to 347 mg/ml, which indicates that higher order notches have higher sensitivities if looking at the absolute change in frequency...|$|E
40|$|Compact microstrip-fed printed {{monopole}} antenna with triple band-notched characteristics is suggested for ultra-wideband (UWB) applications. The antenna is constructed {{of a conventional}} rectangular microstrip patch antenna with partial ground plane and T-shaped strip employed in the ground plane {{as well as an}} inverted Ω- and L-shaped slots incorporated within the radiated element. The notched functions are created by the inverted Ω- and L-shaped slots, which are realized for WiMAX (from 2. 69 to 4. 5 GHz) and WLAN (from 5. 49 to 6. 37 GHz). The T-shaped parasitic strip generates the <b>third</b> <b>notch</b> for the X-band uplink satellite communication (from 8. 15 to 9. 61 GHz). The measured operating - 10 dB bandwidth of the proposed antenna extends from 2. 39 to more than 18 GHz except at the notched bands. The prototype antenna has a total area of 20 × 20 × 1. 6 mm 3.

40|$|AbstractNotch {{signaling}} inhibits {{hair cell}} differentiation, based on studies on mice deficient in Notch signaling-related genes and its downstream genes. However, the precise mechanisms of this inhibition are unknown {{because it is}} difficult to control the timing and duration of the suppression of Notch signaling. Here, we developed a novel in vitro culture and analysis method for mouse fetal cochleae and examined the roles of Notch signaling by its reversible inhibition through the use of Notch signaling inhibitors of γ-secretase and TNF-alpha-converting enzyme. Notch inhibition with Notch signaling inhibitor treatment increases the number of cochlear hair cells, as observed in gene deletion experiments. We elucidated that this increase is regulated by the dichotomy between hair cells and supporting cells from common progenitors. We also propose other roles of Notch signaling in cochlear development. First, Notch signaling arrests the cell cycle of the cochlear epithelium containing putative hair cells and supporting cell progenitors because Notch inhibition with inhibitor treatment increases the number of 5 -bromo- 2 ′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) -positive cells that can differentiate into hair cells or supporting cells. Second, Notch signaling is required for the induction of Prox 1 -positive supporting cells. <b>Third,</b> <b>Notch</b> signaling is required for the maintenance of supporting cells...|$|E
40|$|The spondylocostal dysostoses (SCDs) are a {{heterogeneous}} group of vertebral malsegmentation disorders that arise during embryonic development by {{a disruption of}} somitogenesis. Previously, we had identified two genes that cause a subset of autosomal recessive forms of this disease: DLL 3 (SCD 1) and MESP 2 (SCD 2). These genes are important components of the Notch signaling pathway, which has multiple roles in development and disease. Here, {{we have used a}} candidate-gene approach to identify a mutation in a <b>third</b> <b>Notch</b> pathway gene, LUNATIC FRINGE (LFNG), in a family with autosomal recessive SCD. LFNG encodes a glycosyltransferase that modifies the Notch family of cell-surface receptors, a key step in the regulation of this signaling pathway. A missense mutation was identified in a highly conserved phenylalanine close to the active site of the enzyme. Functional analysis revealed that the mutant LFNG was not localized to the correct compartment of the cell, was unable to modulate Notch signaling in a cell-based assay, and was enzymatically inactive. This represents the first known mutation in the human LFNG gene and reinforces the hypothesis that proper regulation of the Notch signaling pathway is an absolute requirement for the correct patterning of the axial skeleton. <br /...|$|E
40|$|The Notch 3 gene was identified, at the {{beginning}} of 90 s, as the <b>third</b> mammalian <b>Notch</b> and was initially reported as being expressed in proliferating neuroepithelium. Since then, increasing evidence has demonstrated a number of structural and functional differences between Notch 3 and both Notch 1 and Notch 2, which exhibit the highest structural similarity among the four mammalian Notch receptors. Possibly due to its more restricted tissue distribution, targeted deletion of murine Notch 3 does not lead to embryonic lethality as is observed with targeted deletion of Notch 1 and Notch 2. However, genetic mutation, amplification and deregulated expression of Notch 3 have been correlated with the disruption of cell differentiation in transgenic mice and to development of diseases in mice and humans. This review discusses the possible relationships between the structural differences and the nonredundant roles that Notch 3 plays in the pathogenesis of the human disease cerebral autosomal-dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy and in the regulation of murine T-cell differentiation and leukemogenesis...|$|R

40|$|The Notch {{locus of}} Drosophila melanogaster {{is one of}} a small number of zygotically acting "neurogenic" genes {{involved}} in the correct segregation of neural from epidermal lineages during embryogenesis as well as in other postembryonic developmental events. We have generated antibody probes against three regions of the Notch protein to study the expression of Notch and begin a biochemical characterization of the protein. Consistent with predictions based on DNA sequence data, here we gather evidence showing that Notch encodes a large, glycosylated surface protein with an apparent molecular mass of 300 kD: (a) all three antibodies detect Notch on Western blots as a high molecular mass, primarily full-length product; (b) immunoelectron microscopy localizes the Notch protein to the cell membrane; and (c) lentil lectin column binding demonstrates that the protein is glycosylated, indicative of its surface protein nature. In general, the distribution of the Notch protein coincides with that of the Notch transcript determined previously by in situ hybridizations. Notch is expressed in a much wider range of tissue types than those disrupted in the neurogenic mutant, as determined by antibody localization. Early labeling in the blastoderm appears ubiquitous except for the pole cells, but as development proceeds some distinctive features emerge: stronger staining is seen within the germ band layer where neuroblast delamination occurs, and the developing embryonic nervous system shows pronounced axonal staining. In <b>third</b> instar larvae, <b>Notch</b> is expressed in imaginal disks and in the central nervous system. Based on these results, certain models for how Notch controls the neuroblast cell fate choice are eliminated. We discuss how Notch may function in this choice as well as in other lineage fate determinations...|$|R
