5|$|Malvern {{water is}} a natural spring water from the Malvern Hills {{on the border of}} the {{counties}} of Herefordshire and Worcestershire in England. The Hills consist of very hard granite and limestone rock. Fissures in the rock retain rain water, which slowly permeates through, escaping at <b>the</b> <b>springs.</b> <b>The</b> <b>springs</b> release an average of about 60 litres a minute and the flow has never been known to cease.|$|E
5|$|Hot springs {{are closely}} {{associated}} with fumaroles, which are vents in an active volcanic area releasing steam and hot gases, such as sulfur dioxide. In general, the water is rotating groundwater that comes into contact with rocks heated by magma and finds openings to the surface. The formation of <b>the</b> <b>springs</b> depends both on the rocks the water has passed through and the profusion of volcanic discharges mixed with the groundwater. Iron oxide, iron sulfides and other substances usually colour pools of boiling mud brilliant yellow, red, brown or green. Hot springs comprising significantly softened silica may deposit it to form siliceous sinter, whereas those comprising softened calcium carbonate deposit spongy-looking calcareous rock called tufa. Overflow of <b>the</b> <b>springs</b> can build masses, spires or stepped terraces of calcareous sinter or tufa.|$|E
5|$|During the Six-Day War in June 1967, Deir al-Balah's mayor Sulaiman al-Azayiza briefly led local {{resistance}} against the incoming Israeli Army until formally surrendering the city shortly thereafter. The Israeli authorities {{took control of}} <b>the</b> <b>springs,</b> an important irrigation source. This move combined with increasing competition from Israeli citrus farmers, damaged the local citrus industry. In 1982 the mayor was dismissed and the municipal council of Deir al-Balah was disbanded and replaced by an Israeli military-appointed administration. During {{the course of the}} Israeli occupation, Deir al-Balah's urban areas extended into lands designated for agriculture, {{largely as a result of}} building restrictions which hindered organized expansion.|$|E

5|$|Fox {{ran with}} an unusual gait, as he was {{required}} to hop-step on his good leg due to the extra time <b>the</b> <b>springs</b> in his artificial leg required to reset after each step. He found the training painful as the additional pressure he had to place on both his good leg and his stump led to bone bruises, blisters and intense pain. Fox found that after about 20minutes of each run, he crossed a pain threshold and the run became easier.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Arabs from Umm al-Fahm {{migrated}} to al-Lajjun {{to make use}} of its farmland. Gradually, they settled in the village, building their houses around <b>the</b> <b>springs,</b> especially next to the khan. When the massive mound at nearby Tall al-Mutasallim (ancient Megiddo) was excavated by German archaeologists in 1903, some of the inhabitants of Lajjun reused stones from the ancient structure that had been unearthed to build new housing.|$|E
5|$|Madison {{traveled}} to Blue Lick Springs for his health {{soon after the}} election, but {{was too weak to}} return to Frankfort for the inauguration. A Bourbon County justice of the peace administered the oath of office on September 5, 1816 at <b>the</b> <b>springs.</b> Madison's only official act of office was the appointment of Colonel Charles S.

40|$|A first {{end surface}} of a coiled {{compression}} spring at its relaxed length is machined to a plane transverse to <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> axis. <b>The</b> <b>spring</b> is then placed in a press structure having first and second opposed planar support surfaces, with <b>the</b> machined <b>spring</b> end surface bearing against the first support surface, <b>the</b> unmachined <b>spring</b> end surface bearing against a planar first {{surface of a}} lateral force compensation member, and an opposite, generally spherically curved surface of the compensation member bearing against the second press structure support surface. <b>The</b> <b>spring</b> is then compressed generally to its loaded length, and a circumferentially spaced series of marks, lying in a plane parallel to the second press structure support surface, are formed on <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> coil on which <b>the</b> second <b>spring</b> end surface lies. <b>The</b> <b>spring</b> is then removed from the press structure, and <b>the</b> second <b>spring</b> end surface is machined to the mark plane.

50|$|The {{third stage}} is heat treating, which {{prevents}} <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> from being too brittle to function. Heat treating involves placing <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> in an oven at high temperature for a predetermined amount of time, and then letting it cool slowly. The fourth stage is applying {{the finishing touches}} to <b>the</b> <b>spring,</b> which may include grinding (flattening the ends of <b>the</b> <b>spring),</b> shot peening (shooting tiny steel balls at <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> to harden <b>the</b> wire further), setting (permanently fixing the length and pitch of <b>the</b> <b>spring),</b> coating (electroplating or applying paint or rubber to the surface to prevent corrosion), and packaging.|$|R
50|$|An {{example is}} the action of a spring. An {{idealized}} spring exerts a force that {{is proportional to the}} amount of deformation of <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> from its equilibrium length, exerted in a direction to oppose the deformation. Pulling <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> to a greater length causes it to exert a force that brings <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> back toward its equilibrium length. The amount of force can be determined by multiplying <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> constant of <b>the</b> <b>spring</b> by <b>the</b> amount of stretch.|$|R
5|$|Many {{habitats}} in {{the monument}} support populations of snakes and lizards. Southern alligator and western fence lizards are common; others that live here include short-horned and common side-blotched lizards and western skinks. Garter and gopher snakes and western yellow-bellied racers frequent floodplains and canyon bottoms. Rattlesnakes, though venomous, are shy and usually flee before being seen. <b>The</b> <b>springs</b> and seeps {{in the park}} contain isolated populations of western toads, American spadefoot toads, Pacific tree frogs, and long-toed salamanders.|$|E
5|$|The North Atlantic {{oscillation}} is an atmospheric phenomenon {{affecting the}} weather in Western Europe. When the atmospheric pressure variations in the North Atlantic are large, <b>the</b> <b>springs</b> in Europe are warmer. This brings forward the northward migration of those bird species (including the goldcrest) that winter mainly within western or southern Europe. A general climatic change resulting in more frequent positive North Atlantic oscillation events has led to earlier spring migration of these short-distance migrants since the 1980s. The warmer spring weather brings on plant growth, thus preparing the habitat for returning migrants. The effect is greatest in western and central Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{mineral springs}} of the Borjomi valley were {{discovered}} over one thousand years ago. Seven large rock tubs discovered by archeologists {{dating back to}} the beginning of the 7th century attest to the availability and use of the spring waters, most likely for bathing purposes. <b>The</b> <b>springs</b> were abandoned before being rediscovered in the early 19th century. By that time, as a result of the incessant warfare, Borjomi and its environs had been depopulated and covered with impassable forests.|$|E

5|$|The palace was {{originally}} {{surrounded by a}} medieval deer park. When the walls were built, streams were diverted to form the moat as a reservoir. In the 1820s, the grounds within the walls were planted and laid out as pleasure grounds by Bishop George Henry Law, who created a reflecting pond near <b>the</b> <b>springs.</b> Parts of the buildings are still used as a residence by the current bishop, however much of the palace is now used for public functions and as a tourist attraction.|$|E
5|$|Bath Abbey {{was founded}} in the 7th century and became a {{religious}} centre; the building was rebuilt in the 12th and 16th centuries. In the 17th century, claims were made for the curative properties of water from <b>the</b> <b>springs,</b> and Bath became popular as a spa town in the Georgian era. Georgian architecture, crafted from Bath stone, includes the Royal Crescent, Circus, Pump Room and Assembly Rooms where Beau Nash presided over the city's social life from 1705 {{until his death in}} 1761. Many of the streets and squares were laid out by John Wood, the Elder, and in the 18th century the city became fashionable and the population grew. Jane Austen lived in Bath in the early 19th century. Further building was undertaken in the 19th century and following the Bath Blitz in World War II.|$|E

5|$|Fossil Springs, {{the source}} of about 80percent {{of the water in}} Fossil Creek, issues from several vents in close {{proximity}} to one another {{at the base of the}} Mogollon Rim. The rim is the southern edge of the Colorado Plateau. Water percolating through limestone layers in the rim becomes laden with dissolved carbon dioxide and calcium carbonate. When the water emerges at <b>the</b> <b>springs,</b> it begins to release carbon dioxide as a gas and calcium carbonate as travertine, a porous form of calcite often found around hot springs such as Mammoth Hot Springs in Yellowstone National Park. The release, affected by stream turbulence and other factors, does not occur all at once but continues downstream.|$|E
5|$|Homdong Khangtsang, also spelt ‘Kamcuns’ in Tibetan language, are {{the main}} {{dwelling}} units or dormitories which house the monks of the monastery; there are thirty-three Kamcuns surrounding the central courtyard. The size of the Kamcuns varied, depending {{on the strength of}} monks housed. Monks of the same village are housed together; however each monk is given a separate cell. Each Kamcun also has a prayer hall for exclusive study of Buddhist doctrine and also has annexed tea house. However, the main assembly hall here had minor images of Tsongkhapa, Choyi Gyeltsen, Shakhyamuni Buddha, Three Deities of Longevity, and two inner chapels – the Jampakhang with ‘speaking’ image of Tara (protector of <b>the</b> <b>springs</b> in Sera) and Lama Tubten Kunga (who renovated Sera Me) and Gonkhang chapel with the image of the protector deity Gyelchen Karma Trinle.|$|E
5|$|Much of the {{existing}} landscaping {{on the south lawn}} was carried out by Bishop George Henry Law in the 1820s. This included the incorporation of the remains of the roofless great hall and the construction of a raised rampart around the inside of the wall accessible from one of the towers. Bishop Law also created a grotto which he used to display fossils from Banwell Caves which were also part of his estate. A range of tress and shrubs were planted including: a black walnut, Lebanon cedar, catalpa and ginkgo. In the 1830s, Bishop Law had a pool created next to <b>the</b> <b>springs.</b> This acts as a mirror on a still day providing reflections of the east end of the cathedral in the water.|$|E
