The {{integrity}} of the laboratory that tested the sample was brought into question, with the ICC hiring an independent expert {{to find that the}} lab's outcome was not sustainable. Perera [...] had spent some of his own money on fighting the charges, including travelling to the UK to undergo further tests to clear his name. After being cleared, Perera said that [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> been much damage done to my reputation", after the media, fans and Sri Lankan Cricket Board stood by him. On July 6, ICC has agreed to support Sri Lanka Cricket and Kusal Perera's claim for costs and damages from the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA).|$|E
2500|$|... rom my {{knowledge}} of the IDF and from {{the extent to which}} I have been following the current operation, I don’t <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> ever been a {{time in the history of}} warfare when any army has made more efforts to reduce civilian casualties and deaths of innocent people than the IDF is doing today in Gaza... Hamas, the enemy they have been fighting, has been trained extensively by Iran and by Hezbollah, to fight among the people, to use the civilian population in Gaza as a human shield... Hamas factor in the uses of the population as a major part of their defensive plan. So even though as I say, Israel, the IDF, has taken enormous steps...to reduce civilian casualties, it is impossible, it is impossible to stop that happening when the enemy has been using civilians as human shields.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2013, the fan {{campaign}} Voices for Yes {{was launched}} {{to get the}} band into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The campaign was headed by two US political operators: John Brabender, senior media strategist for Republican Rick Santorum's 2012 US presidential campaign, and Tad Devine, who worked on Democrat John Kerry's 2004 presidential campaign and Al Gore's 2000 campaign. Also involved were former NBC president Steve Capus and former Director of the White House Office of Political Affairs Sara Taylor. On 16 October 2013, Yes failed to be inducted. In November 2013, Anderson expressed a wish to return to Yes {{in the future for}} a [...] "tour everybody dreams of", and cited Yes's nomination for inclusion into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a motive for a possible reunion. Howe, however, has stated his opinion of Anderson returning, asserting [...] "I'm not sure our mutual desire to achieve the same thing exists any more ... I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> to be some element of moving on." ...|$|E

2500|$|In March 2015, Loeb {{spoke on}} the ability for the series to {{crossover}} with the MCU films and the ABC television series, saying, [...] "As it is now, {{in the same way}} that our films started out as self-contained and then by the time we got to The Avengers, it became more practical for Captain America to do a little crossover into [...] and for Bruce Banner to appear at the end of Iron Man 3. We have to earn that. The audience needs to understand who all of these characters are and what the world is before you then start co-mingling in terms of where it's going." [...] In April, Cox stated that crossing over with the films is [...] "possible. I think there's a way that the worlds can merge. I think our show feels tonally and thematically a bit different from the Avengers movies, but it's all one universe and I feel like there's a way for Daredevil—and other characters, Luke Cage and street level crime characters—to fit into that universe. I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> to be a way, and I think it's about finding an autonomous tone for that [...] film". Cox also said that he is contractually obligated to appear in films if asked by Marvel.|$|E
2500|$|Since {{coming out}} as a lesbian, Bianca's romantic {{entanglements}} have consisted of sexual confusion, unrequited love, bad timing, and betrayal, including a short-lived romance with Lena Kundera (Olga Sosnovska) and an on-but-mostly-off-screen romantic relationship with Maggie Stone (Elizabeth Hendrickson). The pairing of Reese and Bianca finally allowed the character to be scripted into an on-screen committed relationship. The show had been criticized {{in the past for}} not giving Bianca a full-fledged on-screen romance. When asked by The Advocate if she felt Bianca's pairing with Reese, especially by bringing on a recognized name (Braun), would make a difference, Riegel replied, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>has</b> to be a difference." [...] She responded to the criticism about Bianca's lack of onscreen intimacy with past romantic partners. [...] "I don’t know if the criticism is entirely warranted," [...] she said. [...] "I know I was glad that the show’s priority was in giving me good stories, and I thought that they did go further than anyone else had ever gone, so I always thought that they should be commended." [...] Riegel added, however, that she knows the lack of onscreen intimacy between Bianca and the character's past romantic love interests left fans and herself unsatisfied. [...] "She never really got {{to have the kind of}} relationship that she deserved," [...] stated Riegel. Riegel said of Bianca's return this time, [...] "you’ll see a couple of things you haven’t seen in a while".|$|E
