25|$|Basil Hiley {{showed that}} the energy-momentum-relations in the Bohm model can be {{obtained}} directly from the energy-momentum tensor of quantum field theory and that the quantum potential is an energy term that is required for local energy-momentum conservation.

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} results obtained for Yang–Mills theory is asymptotic freedom. This result can be obtained by assuming that the coupling constant g is small (so small nonlinearities), as for high energies, and applying perturbation theory.

25|$|A {{classical}} {{field theory}} {{is a physical}} <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> predicts how one or more physical fields interact with matter through field equations.

25|$|In addition, general {{relativity}} {{is inconsistent with}} quantum mechanics, the physical <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> <b>describes</b> the wave–particle duality of matter, and quantum mechanics does not currently describe gravitational attraction at relevant (microscopic) scales. There {{is a great deal}} of speculation in the physics community as to the modifications that might be needed to both {{general relativity}} and quantum mechanics in order to unite them consistently. The speculative theory that unites general relativity and quantum mechanics is usually called quantum gravity, prominent examples of which include String Theory and Loop Quantum Gravity.|$|E

Although the theory is often introduced as an explanation of psychological group formation (which was one of its early goals), it is more accurately thought of as general analysis of the functioning of categorization processes in social perception and interaction that speaks to issues of individual identity as much as group phenomena.|$|E
500|$|The {{system of}} {{attraction}} and repulsion between quarks charged with {{different combinations of}} the three colors is called strong interaction, which is mediated by force carrying particles known as gluons; this is discussed at length below. The <b>theory</b> <b>that</b> <b>describes</b> strong interactions is called quantum chromodynamics (QCD). A quark, which will have a single color value, can form a bound system with an antiquark carrying the corresponding anticolor. The result of two attracting quarks will be color neutrality: a quark with color charge ξ plus an antiquark with color charge −ξ {{will result in a}} color charge of 0 (or [...] "white" [...] color) and the formation of a meson. This is analogous to the additive color model in basic optics. Similarly, the combination of three quarks, each with different color charges, or three antiquarks, each with anticolor charges, will result in the same [...] "white" [...] color charge and the formation of a baryon or antibaryon.|$|E
