5|$|After the Second World War, new {{government}} turned toward Soviet influence and the Stalinist monumentalism. The doctrine of Socialist realism in Poland, {{as in other}} countries of the People's Republics, was enforced from 1949 to 1956. It involved all domains of art, but its most spectacular achievements {{were made in the}} field of urban design. The guidelines for this new trend were spelled-out in a 1949 resolution of the National Council of Party Architects. Architecture was to become a weapon in establishing <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>social</b> order by the communists. The ideological impact of urban design was valued more than aesthetics. It aimed at expressing persistence and power. This form of architecture was implemented in the new industrial district of Nowa Huta with apartment blocks constructed according to a Stalinist blueprint, with repetitious courtyards and wide, tree-lined avenues.|$|E
5|$|Extraterrestrial {{technology}} could have profound {{impacts on the}} nature of human culture and civilization. Just as television provided a new outlet {{for a wide variety of}} political, religious, and social groups, and as the printing press made the Bible available to the common people of Europe, allowing them to interpret it for themselves, so an extraterrestrial technology might change humanity in ways not immediately apparent. Harrison speculates that a knowledge of extraterrestrial technologies could increase the gap between scientific and cultural progress, leading to societal shock and an inability to compensate for negative effects of technology. He gives the example of improvements in agricultural technology during the Industrial Revolution, which displaced thousands of farm laborers until society could retrain them for jobs suited to <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>social</b> order. Contact with an extraterrestrial civilization far more advanced than humanity could cause a much greater shock than the Industrial Revolution, or anything previously experienced by humanity.|$|E

5000|$|In {{his book}} Gramsci is Dead, {{published}} in 2005, Day attacked {{the notion of}} hegemony and demonstrated its wide-ranging influence on activist movements internationally. He decries the hegemony of hegemony which he argues characterizes the left. The central premise of the hegemony of hegemony is [...] "the assumption that effective social change can only be achieved simultaneously and en masse, across an entire national or supranational space". [...] He proposed an alternative model, finding {{its roots in the}} anarchist thought of German philosopher Gustav Landauer, which was based on the concept of affinity. Day uses the theory of affinity to explain <b>the</b> <b>Newest</b> <b>Social</b> Movements which he observes emerging as alternatives to the now old social movements (unions, political parties, etc.) and <b>New</b> <b>Social</b> Movements. He argues that <b>the</b> <b>newest</b> <b>social</b> movements are different from previous movements because they are using [...] "non-universalizing, non-hierarchical, non-coercive relationships based on mutual aid and shared ethical commitments" [...] to achieve changes.|$|R

25|$|Sailors {{had lost}} their trust in their officers, who tended to be {{suspicious}} of each other as well. Navy officers from the French Royal Navy of the Ancien Régime, the officiers rouges, openly despised <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>social</b> order {{brought about by the}} French First Republic, and were particularly frustrated by the lack of discipline generated by the philosophy of égalité, as highly detrimental to the organisation of the Navy. Nevertheless, some of these officers, the first of them Morard de Galles, were actually dedicated to the Republic and its egalitarian principles – all the more, in fact, since they hoped that the advent of the Republic would fill the authority void caused by the collapse of the monarchy. Others, such as Kerguelen or Lemarant-Boissauveur, had suffered humiliations from the naval establishment of the Ancien Régime, doubling the republican loyalty of their political convictions with personal resentment against the old order. Rear-admiral Landais would carry revolutionary fervour and suspicion to the point of denouncing Lelarge and Morard de Galles as suspect, and be considered as paranoid by Jeanbon Saint-André.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{offers an}} {{analysis}} of the Prague Food Not Bombs collective using the optics of <b>the</b> <b>newest</b> <b>social</b> movements as defined by Richard Day. Based both on theory and qualitative research, it enquires whether and how the group resists individualization, commodification, and excessive consumption in society. Using her experience of several years of field work, semi-structured and informal interviews, and her field notes, the author describes the collective in question, maps out its mechanisms and internal organization, illustrates the attitudes and tactics of the activists, and exposes the troubles and hurdles they face. She surveys the activists' attitudes to such concepts of <b>the</b> <b>newest</b> <b>social</b> movements as direct grassroot action, solidarity, decentralization, anti-authoritarianism, consensus, and pre-figurative politics, to see if the activists employ them in their resistance strategy. In more general terms, the author attempts at a (so far missing) insight into the Prague collective as a social resistance group and a chapter of the worldwide Food Not Bombs movement.

The fifteen-storey {{building}} that took {{about four years}} of planning and construction to complete opened its doors in September 2012. The Social Sciences Building that cost {{a grand total of}} $112.5 million provides students and faculty with an array of space for individual studying and group work. This building is the newest addition to the University of Ottawa with its green and sustainable architecture and facilities. This building is very different among the rest of the university’s buildings as its structure and characteristics are very eco-friendly. Some features that the building includes are: construction materials that were chosen due to their recycled content, a living wall that is five stories tall and composed of numerous plants that with act as an air filtration system, and a green roof. The green wall is the tallest living biofilter wall in North America. The wall is situated in the main agora of the Faculty of Social Science building and is visible from the outside. The green wall is a unique component of the building’s air handling system, for it is capable of treating a large quantity of air at a time, and it provides a source of humidity that doesn’t need to be artificially introduced.|$|E

500|$|In 1841, two {{factions of}} the United Fraternity split {{off from the}} {{literary}} society. [...] One of the new societies called itself Omega Phi and on May 10, 1842, obtained a charter as the Zeta chapter of Psi Upsilon. [...] The other faction to split from the United Fraternity organized itself on July 13, 1842, as Kappa Kappa Kappa, a local fraternity. More Greek organizations were founded, and by 1855, 64% of students, mostly upperclassmen, {{were members of the}} Greek letter societies on campus. [...] Initially, the original Greek letter societies would not extend invitations of membership to first year students. [...] Two separate Greek letter organizations were created exclusively for freshmen: Kappa Sigma Epsilon and Delta Kappa. [...] These societies would dissolve in 1883, when the fraternities of the upper classes began to pledge freshmen. A chapter of Phi Beta Kappa survived at Dartmouth, but by the 1830s had established its role as a strictly literary society by dropping requirements of secrecy for membership and activities. [...] <b>The</b> <b>new,</b> <b>social</b> Greek organizations distinguished themselves from Phi Beta Kappa and the previous literary societies in several ways. [...] The new fraternities were self-selective and exclusive. [...] Each organization developed its own secret rituals and procedures. [...] Most of the societies began to invest in creating their own meeting halls, either upstairs rooms in buildings on Main Street, or free-standing structures near campus. [...] There were 11 active Greek organizations at Dartmouth College in 1900.|$|E
