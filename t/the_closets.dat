5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{sitting on a}} couch in an apartment's living room, holding a {{heart-shaped}} locket in her hand. The next scene shows Clarkson in the bathroom where she fixes {{her face in the}} mirror, she opens the medicine cabinet and tossing all the pills in the medicine cabinet over her shoulder and messing all the bathroom items on the floor, squirting the toothpaste into the sink. When she gets to a container of birth control pills, she turns on the water in the sink, snaps the pills out, and drops them down the drain. Clarkson then starts to take other items; she throws a container of makeup powder spray in the air and smears a container of facial mud mask on the wall. During the chorus, Clarkson and her band perform the song for a dancing crowd in a club. After the first chorus, Clarkson walks into a room full of closets. She cuts up dresses, rifling through <b>the</b> <b>closets</b> and pulling out clothes, destroying them and singing in a pile of them. After the second chorus, she walks into a bedroom and begins to tear the pillow on the bed, filling the room with feathers. The scenes of Clarkson singing with her band then alternate with a montage of her destroying the apartment, breaks the glass window from the door, breaks the vase, television, clock, fridge, lights, microwave, phone, furniture and the chair. Later, Clarkson takes a framed photo of her ex-boyfriend with another girl in the living room, before pushing a tall CD rack over. She then smashes the framed photo through a glass table, breaking it in half. Having decimated the apartment, Clarkson walks out the door and down the hallway with a hat on her head, just as her ex-boyfriend appears with his girlfriend, walking arm in arm. Clarkson hides her face as she walks away from them. The final scene shows the couple seeing their damaged apartment in shock and the scene of the locket swinging.|$|E

25|$|Searching through <b>the</b> <b>closets</b> of Orthanc, King Elessar and {{his aides}} found the long lost first Elendilmir, a white star of Elvish crystal affixed to a fillet of mithril. Once owned by Elendil, the first King of Arnor, it was an emblem of royalty in the North Kingdom. After Elendil fell in the War of the Last Alliance, his eldest son Isildur ascended to the throne. On his journey back to the {{northern}} capital of Arnor, his retinue was ambushed by orcs. Isildur tried to escape by jumping into a river but was killed by arrows. Saruman may have found his body there, and taken the Elendilmir from it. A replica was made, which was used by Isildur's successors up to the re-establishment of the kingdom (reunited with Gondor) by Elessar. He thus used both, using {{one or the other}} on certain occasions.|$|E

5000|$|In late 20th-century America, <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> {{had become}} a central metaphor for {{grasping}} the history and social dynamics of gay life. The notion of <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> is inseparable from the concept of coming out. <b>The</b> <b>closet</b> narrative sets up an implicit dualism between being [...] "in" [...] or being [...] "out". Those who are [...] "in" [...] are often stigmatized as living false, unhappy lives. However, though many people would prefer to be “out” of <b>the</b> <b>closet,</b> there are numerous social, economic, familial, and personal repercussions that lead to them remaining, whether consciously or unconsciously, “in” <b>the</b> <b>closet.</b> <b>The</b> decision to come out or remain in <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> is considered a deeply personal one, and outing remains controversial in today’s culture.|$|R

500|$|Some pails were {{supplied}} with deodorants such as iron sulphate. [...] Manchester Corporation attempted {{to remove the}} smell of putrefaction by attaching cinder-sifters to their closets so that fine ash could be poured {{on top of the}} excrement. [...] The Goux system, invented in the 1860s by Pierre Nicholas Goux, a landowner near Paris, and widely used in France, overcame some of the more common problems associated with pail closets by lining the pail with an absorbent material. [...] The Rochdale Corporation experimented with Goux's design for several months but settled instead on a system which used smaller pails. [...] Goux's system did, however, find a home in Halifax, where it was used in more than 3,000closets after 1870. [...] The wooden pails used in Halifax were oval in cross-section (about 24 by 19inches) and 16inches deep. [...] Each was lined at the sides and bottom with a mixture of refuse, such as straw, grass, street sweepings, wool, hair, and even seaweed. [...] This lining, which was formed by a special mould and to which sulphate of lime was added, was designed to help remove the smell of urine, slow putrefaction and keep the excreta dry. [...] Pails were collected between 7am and 5:30pm. [...] Members of the public occasionally complained about the smell, which usually occurred when a pail was left to overflow, such as in winter 1875 when severe weather conditions prevented the horse-pulled collection wagons from reaching <b>the</b> <b>closets.</b>|$|E
500|$|John Anderson, of Variety, said [...] "to simply call it {{harrowing}} or unsparing doesn’t quite cut it," [...] having {{felt that}} the film is [...] "courageous and uncompromising, a shaken cocktail of debasement and elation, despair and hope." [...] Anderson cited Carey's performance as [...] "pitch perfect" [...] and Patton's role as Ms. Blu Rain as [...] "disarming." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly, praised Carey's performance, describing it as having been [...] "an authentically deglammed compassion" [...] and praised the film for 'capturing' [...] "how a lost girl rouses herself from the dead" [...] and for Daniels' showing [...] "unflinching courage as a filmmaker by going this deep into the pathologies that may still linger in <b>the</b> <b>closets</b> of some impoverished inner-city lives." [...] Gleiberman described the film as being a movie [...] "that makes you think, 'There {{but for the grace}} of God go I.' [...] It's a potent and moving experience, because by the end you feel you've witnessed nothing less than the birth of a soul" [...] and {{felt that the}} [...] "final scene of revelation" [...] between Sidibe's and Mo'Nique's characters was strong enough to be able to leave viewers [...] "tearful, shaken, [...] dazed with pity and terror." [...] He identifies how Daniels uses one of the rich scenes created by Fletcher to position Mo'Nique in a painful confrontation with Sidibe that results in a masterful and thought-provoking performance that delivers the final [...] "push" [...] needed by Sidibe: [...] "The more Precious tries to get away from her mother, the more she's pulled back".|$|E
500|$|The {{only known}} soft tissue remains, the Oxford head (specimen OUM 11605) and foot, {{belonged to the}} last known stuffed dodo, which was first {{mentioned}} {{as part of the}} Tradescant collection in 1656 and was moved to the Ashmolean Museum in 1659. It has been suggested that this might be the remains of the bird that Hamon L'Estrange saw in London, the bird sent by Emanuel Altham, or a donation by Thomas Herbert. Since the remains do not show signs of having been mounted, the specimen might instead have been preserved as a study skin. Many sources state that the museum burned the stuffed dodo around 1755 because of severe decay, saving only the head and leg. Statute 8 of the museum states [...] "That as any particular grows old and perishing the keeper may remove it into one of <b>the</b> <b>closets</b> or other repository; and some other to be substituted." [...] The deliberate destruction of the specimen is now believed to be a myth; it was removed from exhibition to preserve what remained of it. This remaining soft tissue has since degraded further; the head was dissected by Strickland and Melville, separating the skin from the skull in two halves. The foot is in a skeletal state, with only scraps of skin and tendons. Very few feathers remain on the head. It is probably a female, as the foot is 11% smaller and more gracile than the London foot, yet appears to be fully grown. The specimen was exhibited at the Oxford museum from at least the 1860s and until 1998, where-after it was mainly kept in storage to prevent damage. Casts of the head can today be found in many museums worldwide.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout Speak, Anderson {{represents}} Melinda's {{trauma and}} recovery symbolically. Barbara Tannert-Smith refers to Speak as a [...] "postmodern revisionary fairy tale" [...] {{for its use}} of fairy tale imagery. She sees Merryweather High School as the [...] "ideal fairy tale domain", featuring easily categorized characters—a witchy mother, a shape-shifting best friend, a beastly rapist. Mirrors, traditional fairy tale tools, signify Melinda's struggle with her shattered identity. After being raped, Melinda does not recognize herself in her reflection. Disgusted by what she sees, Melinda avoids mirrors. According to Don Latham, Melinda's aversion to her reflection illustrates acknowledgement of her fragmented identity. In fact, the only mirror Melinda can [...] "see herself" [...] in, is the three-way mirror in the dressing room. Rather than giving {{the illusion of a}} unified self, the three-way mirror reflects Melinda's shattered self. Likewise, Melinda is fascinated by Cubism, because it represents what is beyond the surface. Melinda uses art to express her voice. Her post-traumatic artwork illustrates her pain. The trees symbolize Melinda's growth. The walls of Melinda's closet are covered in her tree sketches, creating a metaphorical forest in which she hides from reliving her trauma. According to Don Latham, <b>the</b> <b>closets</b> in the story symbolize Melinda's queer coping strategies. Melinda uses the closet to conceal the truth.|$|E

50|$|Dr. Bianchon {{learned that}} Madame de Merret had a Spanish lover {{for a short}} period of her life. One day, Madame de Merret's husband {{returned}} early from a business trip when her lover was at the house.

Pressured by her suspicious husband, Madame de Merret swore upon a crucifix that there was no one in <b>the</b> <b>closet,</b> but threatened in turn to leave her husband if he were ever to open <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> out of suspicion. In response, Monsieur de Merret sent for a mason to wall up <b>the</b> <b>closet,</b> trapping <b>the</b> lover inside. Terrified, Madame de Merret passed along a message to the mason asking him to break a hole in the door when her husband was not looking before completely walling <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> off. <b>The</b> mason does that, and Madame de Merret catches a final glimpse of the maddened eyes of her lover through the hole. Once <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> was walled up completely, Madame and Monsieur de Merret stay in the bedroom for several days, listening to the muffled noise coming from <b>the</b> <b>closet.</b> Because of this traumatic experience, Madame de Merret declared her house off-limits upon her death.|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} I offer a geographer's reading of Brent Hartinger's American teen novel Geography Club. My {{intellectual}} {{aim is to}} extend work on the spatialities of <b>the</b> <b>closet,</b> especially those that appreciate both its fixity and fluidity in space. I do this by drawing out the spatial metonymy around closet space, alongside its metaphoric-material dimensions. Specifically, my reading focuses on four themes to achieve this aim: (a) the ubiquity of spatial language throughout the text, of which closet space is one part, (b) the materiality of <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> space in <b>the</b> narrative, (c) the metaleptic and synechdochal qualities of metonymy between <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> and <b>the</b> world, and (d) the placeless and fluidity as important signifiers of <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> in <b>the</b> main character's experience. These insights are not only meant to advance spatial understandings of <b>the</b> <b>closet</b> in more complex and dynamic ways, but also to prompt conversation between cultural studies, queer theory, and human geography...|$|R
