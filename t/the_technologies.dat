30|$|From Table  5, we {{can observe}} that the {{coefficients}} {{of the interaction}} item are nearly positive, namely <b>the</b> FDI <b>technology</b> spillover to <b>the</b> domestic industrial sector is positive. For the eastern domestic industrial sector, <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> spillover is significant in each technology gap level; when <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> gap is less than 1.254, <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> spillover is 0.150. When <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> gap is between 1.254 and 2.163, <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> spillover decreases to 0.117. When <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> gap exceeds 2.163, <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> spillover decreases to 0.086. Regarding the central domestic industrial sector, <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> spillover is also significant at each technology gap level. When <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> gap is less than 1.516, <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> spillover is 0.163. When <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> gap is between 1.516 and 2.694, <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> spillover decreases to 0.113. When <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> gap is over 2.694, <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> spillover rises to 0.222. Regarding the western domestic industrial sector, when <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> gap is less than 1.635, <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> spillover is 0.124. When <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> gap is between 1.635 and 2.714, <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> spillover is not significant and decreases to 0.075.

30|$|From Fig.  1, we {{can observe}} that <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> gap of <b>the</b> eastern region is smaller, between 0.97 and 2.32 generally; however, {{the central and}} western regions are larger, between 1.07 to 3.66 and between 1.00 to 3.88, respectively. In addition, with <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> gap increasing, <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> {{spillover}} is decreasing in the eastern and western domestic industrial sectors. When <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> gap approaches 3.88, <b>the</b> FDI <b>technology</b> spillover in <b>the</b> western domestic industrial sectors nears zero. We can call <b>the</b> FDI <b>technology</b> spillover a decreasing function of <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> gap. Furthermore, we find that, with <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> gap increasing, <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> spillover is decreasing; however, when <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> gap exceeds 2.09 approximately, <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> spillover is increasing gradually in the central domestic industrial sectors.

5|$|LIFE, {{short for}} Laser Inertial Fusion Energy, was a fusion energy effort run at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory between 2008 and 2013. LIFE {{aimed to develop}} <b>the</b> <b>technologies</b> {{necessary}} to convert the laser-driven inertial confinement fusion concept being developed in the National Ignition Facility (NIF) into a practical commercial power plant, a concept known generally as inertial fusion energy (IFE). Two designs were considered, operated as either a pure fusion or hybrid fusion-fission system. LIFE used the same basic concepts as NIF, but aimed to lower costs using mass-produced fuel elements, simplified maintenance, and diode lasers with higher electrical efficiency.|$|E
5|$|Second-generation {{technologies}} include {{solar heating}} and cooling, wind power, modern forms of bioenergy, and solar photovoltaics. These are now entering markets {{as a result}} of research, development and demonstration (RD) investments since the 1980s. Initial investment was prompted by energy security concerns linked to the oil crises of the 1970s but the enduring appeal of these technologies is due, at least in part, to environmental benefits. Many of <b>the</b> <b>technologies</b> reflect significant advancements in materials.|$|E
5|$|Synthetic nitrogen, {{along with}} mined rock phosphate, {{pesticides}} and mechanization, have greatly increased crop yields {{in the early}} 20th century. Increased supply of grains has led to cheaper livestock as well. Further, global yield increases were experienced later in the 20th century when high-yield varieties of common staple grains such as rice, wheat, and corn were introduced {{as a part of}} the Green Revolution. The Green Revolution exported <b>the</b> <b>technologies</b> (including pesticides and synthetic nitrogen) of the developed world to the developing world. Thomas Malthus famously predicted that the Earth would not be able to support its growing population, but technologies such as the Green Revolution have allowed the world to produce a surplus of food.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>technologies</b> of deep tube {{tunnelling}} {{and electric}} traction pioneered and proved by the C shaped {{the direction of}} subsequent underground railways built in London. The C demonstrated that an underground railway could be constructed without the need to purchase large and expensive tracts of land for the shallow cuttings of sub-surface steam operated railways. Instead, it became possible to construct a tunnel at deep level without adversely affecting conditions on the surface. The C thus encouraged {{the construction of a}} network of underground railways in London, far larger than might have been the case otherwise. The size and depth of the tunnels used on the deep tube lines, including the Northern line, does have drawbacks: the tunnels have a limited loading gauge and the lines suffer from overheating in the summer.|$|E
5|$|With the {{publication}} of Chariots of the Gods? in 1968, Erich von Däniken introduced the intervention theory to the general public. Von Däniken wrote that <b>the</b> <b>technologies</b> and religions of ancient civilizations were granted by extraterrestrials worshiped as gods. Von Däniken argued that only extraterrestrial intervention can explain the higher technological knowledge presumed to be essential {{for the production of}} ancient artifacts such as the Egyptian pyramids, Stonehenge and the Moai of Easter Island. Humans in ancient times considered this extraterrestrial high-tech to be supernatural and the aliens themselves to be 'gods'. One can find direct parallels to the messages that Vorilhon claimed to have received and written about in his books. Marie-Hélène Parent, ex-guide Raëlian priest, describes Sendy and Vorilhon meeting several times for drinks and conversation throughout the years of 1973 and 1974, prior to Vorilhon's claimed extraterrestrial encounter.|$|E
