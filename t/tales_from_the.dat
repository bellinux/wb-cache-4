5|$|In {{addition}} to her work in big-budget productions, Baker also appeared in small, independent films, such as Just Your Luck (1996) and Nowhere to Go (1997).

Fox), Murder, She Wrote and L.A. Law (both 1993); Chicago Hope (1995), and Roswell (1999). In 2000, she appeared in the Lifetime film Another Woman's Husband.

5|$|Jackson and Walsh {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} The Frighteners during the script-writing phase of Heavenly Creatures. Executive producer Robert Zemeckis hired the duo to write the script, with the original intention of Zemeckis directing The Frighteners as a spin-off film of the television series, <b>Tales</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Crypt. With Jackson and Walsh's first draft submitted in January 1994, Zemeckis believed the film {{would be better off}} directed by Jackson, produced by Zemeckis and funded/distributed by Universal Studios. The visual effects were created by Jackson's Weta Digital, which had only been in existence for three years. This, plus the fact that The Frighteners required more digital effects shots than almost any movie made until that time, resulted in the eighteen-month period for effects work by Weta Digital being largely stressed.|$|E

5|$|Peter Jackson and wife/co-writer Fran Walsh {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} The Frighteners in 1992, during the script-writing phase of Heavenly Creatures. Together, they wrote a three-page film treatment {{and sent it to}} their talent agent in Hollywood. Robert Zemeckis viewed their treatment with the intention of directing The Frighteners as a spin-off film of the television series, <b>Tales</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Crypt (which he helped produce). Zemeckis hired Jackson and Walsh to turn their treatment into a full-length screenplay in January 1993. The husband and wife duo completed their first draft for The Frighteners in early-January 1994. Zemeckis was so impressed with their script, he decided The Frighteners would work better directed by Jackson, executive produced by Zemeckis and funded/distributed by Universal Pictures. Universal greenlighted the film to commence pre-production on a $26 million budget in April 1994. The studio also granted Jackson and Zemeckis total artistic control and the right of final cut privilege.|$|E
5|$|Tomb of Horrors is an {{adventure}} module written by Gary Gygax for the Dungeons & Dragons (D) role-playing game. It was originally written for and {{used at the}} 1975 Origins1 convention. Gygax designed the adventure both to challenge the skill of expert players in his own campaign, and to test players who boasted of having mighty player characters able to best any challenge. The module, coded S1, {{was the first in}} the S-series, or special series of modules. Several versions of the adventure have been published, the first in 1978, and the most recent, for the fifth edition of D, in 2017 as one of the included adventures in <b>Tales</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Yawning Portal. The module also served as the basis for a novel published in 2002.|$|E
