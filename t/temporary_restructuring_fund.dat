40|$|Purpose/objective: The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to investigate the influence of the 2008 xenophobic events on the structure of earnings of street traders in inner-city Johannesburg and to provide recommendations to policymakers. Problem investigated: The xenophobic events of 2008 are well documented, but absent from the literature is the potential influence on the earnings of foreign street traders. This study investigates this influence through analysis of data from before and after the events. Design and methodology: The study applies an exploratory cross-sectional research design using data from three different samples. Mann-Whitney and Chi-squared measures are applied together with exploratory multiple linear regression analysis to generate insight into the relationships between earnings and differences by origin. Findings and implications: In 2009 the earnings structure of the sector changed. In 2008 and 2010, the earnings of foreign traders are higher, whereas in 2009 these traders earned less than local traders. It is argued that the xenophobic events might have resulted in a <b>temporary</b> <b>restructuring</b> of earnings. Originality or value of the research: This study makes a contribution through exploratory findings that document a change in the structure of earnings of foreign street traders. Conclusion: A change in the structure of earnings of foreign street traders occurred after the xenophobic events of 2008. Although association cannot ascribe causality, it is argued that this change may be related to these events. </p...|$|R

40|$|Addressing the International Forum on Agriculture and Food in Cernobbio on October 25 th 2003, Commissioner Fischler {{outlined}} {{the basis for}} the Commission's tobacco-sector reform proposals. He noted that for 66 % of tobacco holdings in Italy 'current support will simply be transferred to the single farm payment and maintained at 100 %' and that for a further 23 % benefits will be maintained at 80 % of current levels under the single farm payment scheme. According to Commissioner Fischler this means that 'family employment, which represents some 80 % of the total workforce in the tobacco sector, will continue to benefit from public support'. It will allow farmers to continue to produce tobacco or to diversify into other sectors which may be more profitable. He maintained that it would not lead to land abandonment. The <b>restructuring</b> <b>funds</b> provided will also be made available for retraining of farmers, the creation of new rural employment opportunities and even early-retirement schemes. Commissioner Fischler maintained that the overall aim of the reform process was 'the phasing-out of tobacco subsidies, while putting in place measures to develop alternative sources of income and economic activity for tobacco growers'. Commission proposals for reform of the tobacco sector were also set out in some detail at the Commission-convened seminar on tobacco-sector reform which took place in Brussels on November 10 th 2003. Comment: The Commissioner's explanation makes clear {{the extent to which a}} reformed CAP is intended to maintain current levels of EU production through means which are more WTO compatible.

40|$|Background: This study {{analyzes}} {{the process of}} establishing and developing a cooperative vocational rehabilitation project with special focus on organizational and professional aspects. In the project, officials from the Swedish Social Insurance Agency and the Swedish Public Employment Service worked cooperatively with participants on long-term sick leave, youths with disability benefits, and people receiving social allowances. The officials used Motivational Interviewing (MI) as a method when meeting participants, {{and were able to}} offer flexible and tailored case management. The goal was to improve work ability and promote self-sufficiency. Methods: The process evaluation was carried out through continuous data collection throughout the project (2012 - 2014), resulting in a total of 28 individual interviews and 17 focus groups with officials and managers. The material was categorized through an inductive content analysis, and analyzed using social capital as a theoretical frame. Results: The evaluation points to how issues related to design, organization and management contributed to the project not reaching its goals, e. g. problems with recruitment of participants, the funding structure, and staffing problems on the managerial level. Still, officials reported positive effects of close cooperation, which was perceived as facilitating the case management by fostering a mutual understanding and access to resources and rehabilitation measures from more than one authority. Conclusions: Cooperative work combined with the use of MI and flexible case management seem to promote an increased trust between officials from different authorities and participants, which in the study is conceptualized as bonding and bridging social capital (between officials) and linking social capital (between officials and participants). The organizational problems combined with the relatively large differences in approaches between the project and regular practice obstructed implementation, where the authorities involved {{did not appear to be}} ready for implementing methodologies that require organizational <b>restructuring.</b> <b>Funding</b> Agencies|ESF; SSIA; SPES</p...|$|R
