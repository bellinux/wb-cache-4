25|$|Claiming {{continental}} European solidarity, de Gaulle again rejected British entry {{when they}} next applied {{to join the}} community in December 1967 under the Labour leadership of Harold Wilson.

Wilson said he <b>then</b> <b>gently</b> raised the spectre of the threat of a newly powerful Germany {{as a result of the}} EEC, which de Gaulle agreed was a risk. After de Gaulle left office the United Kingdom applied again and finally became a member of the EEC in January 1973.|$|E

500|$|Lockheed and the Army held a 13-minute {{demonstration}} [...] "first flight" [...] for {{the public}} at the Van Nuys Airport on 12 December 1967. During the flight, the Cheyenne demonstrated {{some of the new}} capabilities brought about by the thrusting propeller; the helicopter could slow down or accelerate without pitching the nose up or down, as well as being able to pitch the nose down or up at a hover, without causing the aircraft to accelerate forwards or backwards. The Cheyenne demonstrated a stationary hover in a 30-knot (35mph, 56km/h) crosswind, {{and at the end of}} the flight landed on its two forward landing gear, [...] "bowed" [...] to the audience and <b>then</b> <b>gently</b> set the tail landing gear down as it taxied to parking. [...] By March 1968, the AH-56 had established a flight envelope of 170knots (196 mph, 315km/h) in forward flight, 25knots (29mph, 46km/h) sidewards, and 20knots (23mph, 37km/h) rearwards.|$|E

500|$|The {{film was}} one of the first to use {{practical}} locations during shooting. According to Clarke, [...] "When we needed a scene in a bar, we went to Santa Monica and asked a guy how much money he would charge to let us come in and shoot scenes in his bar". Because Clarke also acted in the film, editor and co-writer Tom Boutross served as co-director. Boutross later [...] The main character's home in the film was located on Lafayette Boulevard in Los Angeles, which is no longer standing. The four-story rooming house was rented for 5â€“6 weekend days for $25 per day. The exterior shots of the character's house were shot in a different location around Glendale Hill. A scene in the film where a transformed McKenna graphically crushes a rat with his bare hands was not in the script, and was improvised while on location. The effect was accomplished by placing ketchup on the rat; Clarke would <b>then</b> <b>gently</b> squeeze the rat, making the ketchup ooze from his fingers. This scene was removed from prints that were released on television, but was later restored.|$|E

2500|$|In 134 BC, he {{was serving}} {{with the army}} at Numantia and his good {{services}} {{brought him to the}} attention of Publius Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus Africanus. Whether he arrived with Scipio Aemilianus or was already serving in the demoralized army that Scipio Aemilianus took over at Numantia is not clear. According to Plutarch, during a conversation after dinner, when the conversation turned to generals, someone asked Scipio Aemilianus where the Roman people would find a worthy successor to him. Aemilianus <b>then</b> <b>gently</b> tapped on Marius' shoulder, saying: [...] "Perhaps this is the man." [...] It would seem that even at this early stage in his army career, Marius had ambitions for a political career in Rome. He ran for election as one of the twenty-four special military tribunes of the first four legions who were elected (the rest were appointed by the magistrate who raised the legion). Sallust tells us that he was unknown by sight to the electors but was returned by all the tribes {{on the basis of his}} accomplishments.|$|E

Aguilera's vocals on the song span from G#3 to E5. Its instrumentation comes from bass, cello, contrabass, drums, guitar, piano, viola and violin. It starts with a piano opening backed by strings and, as noted by Bill Lamb of About.com, [...] "as the words work their way to a climax accented by percussion <b>then</b> <b>gently</b> fade away again leaving the listener in stunned silence from the beauty of the moment." [...] Lyrically, [...] "Hurt" [...] is an evocation of pain and guilt that accompanies the loss of a loved one.
