The hopes of a creative boom never materialized, as publishers were eager to exploit the lucrative pulp literature market (virtually nonexistent before) largely ignoring <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> <b>literature</b> establishment. This led to rather low confidence in domestic authors, and it was extremely {{hard to find a}} publisher ready to invest in a local writer.|$|E

A 2015 review assessed the energy payback time and EROI of solar photovoltaics. In this meta study, which uses an insolation of 1700nbsp&kWh/m2/year and a system lifetime of 30 years, mean harmonized EROIs between 8.7 and 34.2 were found. Mean harmonized energy payback time varied from 1.0 to 4.1 years. Crystalline silicon devices achieve on average an energy payback period of 2 years.|$|E

The research is aim to appraise <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> <b>literatures</b> and eventually set the research agenda. Past studies revealed that there are relationships between the four cognitions of psychological empowerment: meaning, self-determination, competence and impact cognitions with organizational commitment. Furthermore, the extant literature also encapsulates the relationships between psychological empowerment and the three dimensions of organizational commitment: affective, normative and continuance commitment. However, results from <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> <b>literatures</b> are shown to be inconsistent. The paper concludes with suggestions for educational leaders to focus on enhancing psychological empowerment of impact, meaning and competence cognitions in order to increase academic staff commitment within an organization. Successfully shaping the attitude of academics in private universities will lead to improvement of overall organizational performancePsychological Empowerment, Organizational Commitment...|$|R

According to labor economist Giovanni Peri, <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> <b>literature</b> {{suggests that there are}} no economic reasons why the American labor market could not easily absorb 100,000 Syrian refugees in a year. Refugees integrate more slowly into host countries' labor markets than labor migrants, in part due to the loss and depreciation of human capital and credentials during the asylum procedure.|$|E

2500|$|In her {{extensive}} {{review of}} <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> <b>literature,</b> Kalben {{concluded that the}} fact that women live longer than men was observed at least as far back as 1750 and that, with relatively equal treatment, today males {{in all parts of the}} world experience greater mortality than females. Kalben's study, however, was restricted to data in Western Europe alone, where demographic transition occurred relatively early. In countries such as Hungary, Bulgaria, India and China, males continued to outlive females into the twentieth century. [...] Of 72 selected causes of death, only 6 yielded greater female than male age-adjusted death rates in 1998 in the United States. With the exception of birds, for almost all of the animal species studied, males have higher mortality than females. Evidence suggests that the sex mortality differential in people is due to both biological/genetic and environmental/behavioral risk and protective factors.|$|E
