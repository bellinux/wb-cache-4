5|$|Francium coprecipitates {{with several}} caesium salts, such as caesium perchlorate, {{which results in}} small amounts of {{francium}} perchlorate. This coprecipitation {{can be used to}} isolate francium, by adapting the radiocaesium coprecipitation method of Lawrence E. Glendenin and Nelson. It will additionally coprecipitate with many other caesium salts, including the iodate, the picrate, the <b>tartrate</b> (also rubidium <b>tartrate),</b> the chloroplatinate, and the silicotungstate. It also coprecipitates with silicotungstic acid, and with perchloric acid, without another alkali metal as a carrier, which provides other methods of separation. Nearly all francium salts are water-soluble.|$|E

25|$|Less {{than half}} of the tartaric acid found in grapes is free standing, with the {{majority}} of the concentration present as potassium acid salt. During fermentation, these <b>tartrates</b> bind with the lees, pulp debris and precipitated tannins and pigments. While some variance among grape varieties and wine regions exists, generally about half of the deposits are soluble in the alcoholic mixture of wine. The crystallization of these <b>tartrates</b> can happen at unpredictable times, and in a wine bottle may appear like broken glass, though they are in fact harmless. Winemakers will often put the wine through cold stabilization, where it is exposed to temperatures below freezing to encourage the <b>tartrates</b> to crystallize and precipitate out of the wine, or electrodialysis which removes the <b>tartrates</b> via a membrane process.|$|R
25|$|Pasteur {{noticed that}} {{crystals}} of <b>tartrates</b> had small faces. Then he observed that, in racemic mixtures of <b>tartrates,</b> {{half of the}} crystals were right-handed and half were left-handed. In solution, the right-handed compound was dextrorotatory, and the left-handed one was levorotatory. Pasteur determined that optical activity related {{to the shape of}} the crystals, and that an asymmetric internal arrangement of the molecules of the compound was responsible for twisting the light. The (2R,3R)- and (2S,3S)- <b>tartrates</b> were isometric, non-superposable mirror images of each other. This was the first time anyone had demonstrated molecular chirality, and also the first explanation of isomerism.|$|R

Their hypothesis was that the calomel given to Napoleon became an overdose, which killed him and left extensive tissue damage behind. According to a 2007 article, the type of arsenic found in Napoleon's hair shafts was mineral, the most toxic, and according to toxicologist Patrick Kintz, this supported the conclusion that he was murdered.|$|E
5|$|Hipólito Vieytes {{was about}} to make a {{diplomatic}} mission to Britain, but Moreno requested that he should be given the appointment instead. Saavedra accepted immediately. He traveled to Britain with his brother Manuel Moreno and his secretary Tomás Guido, on the British schooner Fame. His health declined and there was no doctor on board, but the captain refused requests to land at some earlier port such as in Río de Janeiro (Brazil) or Cape Town (South Africa). The captain gave him an emetic in common use at that time, prepared with four grams of antimony potassium <b>tartrate.</b> Moreno had great convulsions as a consequence, and considered that in his state he could not have resisted more than the quarter of a gram. He died shortly afterwards. His body was wrapped in a Union Jack and thrown into the sea, after a volley of musketry.|$|E

25|$|Tartrate-resistant acid {{phosphatase}} (TRAP or TRAPase), also called {{acid phosphatase}} 5, <b>tartrate</b> resistant (ACP5), is a glycosylated monomeric metalloprotein enzyme expressed in mammals. It has a molecular weight of approximately 35kDa, a basic isoelectric point (7.6-9.5), and optimal activity in acidic conditions. TRAP is synthesized as latent proenzyme and activated by proteolytic cleavage and reduction. It is differentiated from other mammalian acid phosphatases by its resistance to inhibition by <b>tartrate</b> and molecular weight.|$|E
25|$|Oxycodone is {{marketed as}} various salts, most {{commonly}} as the hydrochloride salt. The free base conversion ratios of different salts are: hydrochloride (0.896), bitartrate (0.667), <b>tartrate</b> (0.750), camphosulphonate (0.576), pectinate (0.588), phenylpriopionate (0.678), sulphate (0.887), phosphate (0.763), and terephthalate (0.792).

2500|$|Some {{producers}} {{prefer not}} to thoroughly clarify and stabilize their wines, believing that the processes involved may diminish a wine's aroma, flavor, texture, color or aging potential. Wine experts such as Tom Stevenson note that they may improve wine quality when used with moderation and care, or diminish it when used to excess. Winemakers deliberately leave more <b>tartrates</b> and phenolics in wines designed for long aging in bottle {{so that they are}} able to develop the aromatic compounds that constitute bouquet. [...] The consumers of some wines, such as red Bordeaux and Port, may expect to see <b>tartrates</b> and sediment after aging in bottle.|$|R

25|$|As {{a complex}} {{chemical}} mixture {{dependent on the}} activity of microorganisms, wine can be unstable and reactive to changes in its environment. Once bottled, a wine may be exposed to extremes of temperature and humidity, as well as violent movement during transportation and storage. These may cause cloudiness, sedimentation and/or the formation of <b>tartrate</b> crystals; more seriously, they may also cause spoilage or the production of carbonic gas.|$|E
25|$|The wort also {{contains}} minerals. Sodium, Potassium, and Magnesium are most common. Potassium and also calcium can form salts with the tartaric acid: Potassium bitartrate and the neutral calcium <b>tartrate</b> at the pH of the wine. For these, when their solubility threshold is reached, they settle {{and contribute to}} de-acidify the wort. In the southern regions where acidity is sometimes a little lacking {{this may be a}} cause of failure of extra acidity.|$|E
25|$|Rivastigmine <b>tartrate</b> is a {{white to}} off-white, fine {{crystalline}} powder that is both lipophilic (soluble in fats) and hydrophilic (soluble in water). It comes {{in a variety of}} administrations including a capsule, solution and a transdermal patch. Like other cholinesterase inhibitors, it requires doses to be increased gradually over several weeks; this is usually referred to as the titration phase. Oral doses of rivastigmine should be titrated with a 3mg per day increment every 2 to 4 weeks.|$|E
50|$|Sediments in bottled {{wines are}} {{relatively}} rare, and usually signal a fine wine {{that has already}} spent some years in the bottle. So unaccustomed have modern consumers become that many (erroneously) {{view it as a}} fault. Many winemakers therefore take great pains to ensure that the great majority of wines made today (especially those designed to be drunk within their first few years) will remain free of sediment for this time. Wines designed for long bottle aging, on the other hand, frequently deposit crystals of <b>tartrates,</b> and in addition red wines deposit some pigmented tannins. Winemakers deliberately leave more <b>tartrates</b> and phenolics in wines designed for long aging in bottle so that they are able to develop the aromatic compounds that constitute bouquet.|$|R
25|$|In winemaking, {{clarification}} and stabilization are {{the processes}} by which insoluble matter suspended in the wine is removed before bottling. This matter may include dead yeast cells (lees), bacteria, <b>tartrates,</b> proteins, pectins, various tannins and other phenolic compounds, as well as pieces of grape skin, pulp, stems and gums. Clarification and stabilization may involve , filtration, centrifugation, flotation, refrigeration, pasteurization, and/or barrel maturation and racking.|$|R
5000|$|The {{name comes}} not from the popular fruit flavorings but {{from the fact that}} the acid in the mixture — which was then sourced from either citrus fruit (citric acid) or grapes (tartaric acid) — forms further salts such monosodium citrate in {{solution}} with the carbonates or <b>tartrates.</b> [...] "Fruit salt" [...] thus refers both to the fruit-derived salts formed in solution and metonymically to the mixture as a whole.|$|R
25|$|Most of the {{benefits}} associated with lees contact deals with the influence on the wine of the mannoproteins released during the autolysis of the yeast cells. Composed primarily of mannose and proteins, with some glucose, mannoproteins are often bound in the cell wall of yeast with hydrophobic aroma compounds that become volatilized as the cell wall breaks down. Not only does the release of mannoproteins impart sensory changes in the wine but they can contribute to <b>tartrate</b> and protein stability, help enhance the body and mouthfeel of the wine as well as decrease the perception of bitterness and astringency of tannins.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} salts of {{morphine}} are used, {{with the most}} common in current clinical use being the hydrochloride, sulfate, <b>tartrate,</b> and citrate; less commonly methobromide, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, lactate, chloride, and bitartrate and the others listed below. Morphine diacetate, which is another name for heroin, is a Schedule I controlled substance, {{so it is not}} used clinically in the United States; it is a sanctioned medication in the United Kingdom and in Canada and some countries in Continental Europe, its use being particularly common (nearly to the degree of the hydrochloride salt) in the United Kingdom. Morphine meconate is a major form of the alkaloid in the poppy, as is morphine pectinate, nitrate, sulphate, and some others. Like codeine, dihydrocodeine and other (especially older) opiates, morphine has been used as the salicylate salt by some suppliers and can be easily compounded, imparting the therapeutic advantage of both the opioid and the NSAID; multiple barbiturate salts of morphine were also used in the past, as was/is morphine valerate, the salt of the acid being the active principle of valerian. Calcium morphenate is the intermediate in various latex and poppy-straw methods of morphine production, more rarely sodium morphenate takes its place. Morphine ascorbate and other salts such as the tannate, citrate, and acetate, phosphate, valerate and others may be present in poppy tea depending on the method of preparation. Morphine valerate produced industrially was one ingredient of a medication available for both oral and parenteral administration popular many years ago in Europe and elsewhere called Trivalin (not {{to be confused with the}} current, unrelated herbal preparation of the same name), which also included the valerates of caffeine and cocaine, with a version containing codeine valerate as a fourth ingredient being distributed under the name Tetravalin.|$|E
