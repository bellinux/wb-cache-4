These capacities bring with them separation anxiety as the infant becomes more vulnerable away from mother. This newly acquired motor development parallels infants' intellectual curiosity, cognitive and language development as <b>they</b> <b>begin</b> <b>to</b> point and name, and jointly attend with mothers <b>to</b> their environment <b>beginning</b> by 9-10 months. Most parents welcome these explorations and this increased independence.
