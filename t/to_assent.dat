5|$|With Arundel's {{change of}} {{allegiance}} came {{a conflict of}} interest. In August 1321, a demand was made to the king that Hugh Despenser and his father, Hugh Despenser the elder, be sent into exile. The king, facing a rebellion in the Welsh Marches, {{had no choice but}} <b>to</b> <b>assent.</b> Arundel voted for the expulsion, but later he claimed that he did so under compulsion, and also supported their recall in December. Arundel had suffered personally from the rebellion, when Roger Mortimer seized his castle of Clun. Early in 1322, Arundel joined King Edward in a campaign against the Mortimer family. The opposition soon crumbled, and the king decided to move against Thomas of Lancaster, who had been supporting the marcher rebellion all along. Lancaster was defeated at the Battle of Boroughbridge in March, and executed.|$|E
5|$|When Article 5A {{is brought}} into force, the President will {{also be able to}} decline <b>to</b> <b>assent</b> to a bill seeking to amend the Constitution that has a direct or {{indirect}} effect of circumventing or curtailing his discretionary powers. In this case, the Cabinet may also advise the President to refer to the Tribunal {{the question of whether the}} bill indeed has this effect. If the Tribunal rules that the bill does not have this effect, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day immediately following the day when the Tribunal pronounces its opinion in open court. On the other hand, if the Tribunal decides to the contrary, the Prime Minister may opt to submit the bill to the electorate. If the bill is supported at a national referendum by not less than two-thirds of the total number of votes cast, the President is deemed to have assented to the bill on the day immediately following the day when the results of the referendum have been published in the Government Gazette.|$|E
25|$|Mahathir {{exercised}} {{caution in}} his first two years in power, consolidating his leadership of UMNO and, with victory in the 1982 general election, the government. In 1983, Mahathir commenced the first of a number of battles he would have with Malaysia's royalty during his premiership. The position of Yang di-Pertuan Agong, the Malaysian head of state, was due to rotate in to either the elderly Idris Shah II of Perak or the controversial Iskandar of Johor. Mahathir had grave reservations about the two Sultans. Both were activist rulers of their own states and Iskandar had only a few years earlier been convicted of manslaughter. Mahathir tried to pre-emptively limit the power that the new Agong could wield over his government, introducing to parliament amendments to the Constitution to deem the Agong <b>to</b> <b>assent</b> to any bill that had not been assented within 15 days of passage by Parliament. The proposal would also remove the power to declare a state of emergency from the Agong and placed it with the Prime Minister. The Agong at the time, Ahmad Shah of Pahang, agreed with the proposals in principle but baulked when he realised that the proposal would also deem Sultans <b>to</b> <b>assent</b> to laws passed by state assemblies. Supported by the Sultans, the Agong refused <b>to</b> <b>assent</b> to the constitutional amendments, which had by then passed both houses of Parliament with comfortable majorities. When the public became aware of the impasse, and the Sultans refused to compromise with the government, Mahathir took to the streets to demonstrate public support for his position in mass rallies. The press took the side of the government, although a large minority of Malays, including conservative UMNO politicians, and an even larger proportion of the Chinese community, supported the sultans. After five months, the crisis resolved, as Mahathir and the Sultans agreed to a compromise. The Agong would retain the power to declare a state of emergency, but if he refused <b>to</b> <b>assent</b> to a bill, the bill would be returned to Parliament, which could then override the Agong's veto.|$|E

25|$|Needing {{support to}} stay afloat, Khánh {{released}} a communiqué after the meeting, promising {{to revise the}} constitution, liberalise the press, permit protests and start special courts to look into past grievances.

50|$|The power <b>to</b> {{withhold}} royal <b>assent</b> <b>to</b> Bills is controversial.

Others, such as Professor Philip Joseph, believe the Governor-General does retain the power <b>to</b> refuse royal <b>assent</b> <b>to</b> Bills in exceptional circumstances - such as the abolition of democracy. A similar controversial power is the ability to refuse to make Orders and regulations advised by the Government or by individual Ministers.|$|R

25|$|In October, when {{schemes for}} marrying Mary to an English nobleman were under consideration, Knollys {{proposed}} that his wife's nephew, George Carey, might prove a suitable match. In November the inquiry into Mary's misdeeds which had begun at York, was reopened at Westminster, and Knollys {{pointed out that}} he needed a larger company of retainers to keep his prisoner safe from a possible attempt at rescue. In December he was directed by Elizabeth to induce Mary <b>to</b> <b>assent</b> to her abdication of the Scottish throne. In January 1569 he plainly told Elizabeth that, in declining to allow Mary either to be condemned or to be acquitted on the charges brought against her, she was inviting perils which were likely to overwhelm her, and entreated her to leave the decision of Mary's fate to her well-tried councillors. On 20 January orders arrived at Bolton to transfer Mary to Tutbury, where the Earl of Shrewsbury was {{to take charge of}} her. Against the removal the Scottish queen protested in a pathetic note to Knollys, intended for Elizabeth's eye, but next day she was forced to leave Bolton, and Knollys remained with her at Tutbury till 3 February. His wife's death then called him home. Mary blamed Elizabeth for the fatal termination of Lady Knollys' illness, attributing it to her husband's enforced absence in the north.|$|E
25|$|Leopold refused <b>to</b> <b>assent</b> to the treaty, as he {{considered}} that his allies had somewhat neglected his interests, {{but in the}} following month he came to terms {{and a number of}} places were transferred from France to Germany. The peace with France lasted for about four years and then Europe was involved in the War of the Spanish Succession. The king of Spain, Charles II, was a Habsburg by descent and was related by marriage to the Austrian branch, while a similar tie bound him to the royal house of France. He was feeble and childless, and attempts had been made by the European powers to arrange for a peaceable division of his extensive kingdom. Leopold refused to consent to any partition, and when in November 1700 Charles died, leaving his crown to Philippe de France, Duke of Anjou, a grandson of Louis XIV, all hopes of a peaceable settlement vanished. Under the guidance of William III a powerful league, a renewed Grand Alliance, was formed against France; of this the emperor was a prominent member, and in 1703 he transferred his claim on the Spanish monarchy to his second son, Charles. The early course of the war was not favorable to the Imperialists, but the tide of defeat had been rolled back by the great victory of Blenheim before Leopold died on 5 May 1705.|$|E

25|$|The Forty-Two Articles were {{intended}} to summarise Anglican doctrine, as it now existed under the reign of Edward VI, who favoured a Protestant faith. Largely the work of Thomas Cranmer, {{they were to be}} short formularies that would demonstrate the faith revealed in Scripture and the existing Catholic creeds. Completed in 1552, they were issued by Royal Mandate on 19 June 1553. The articles were claimed to have received the authority of a Convocation, although this is doubtful. With the coronation of Mary I and the reunion of the Church of England with the Catholic Church, the Articles were never enforced. However, after Mary's death, they became the basis of the Thirty-nine Articles. In 1563, Convocation met under Archbishop Parker to revise the articles. Convocation passed only 39 of the 42, and Elizabeth reduced the number to 38 by throwing out Article XXIX to avoid offending her subjects with Catholic leanings. In 1571, the Article XXIX, despite the opposition of Bishop Edmund Gheast, was inserted, to the effect that the wicked do not eat the Body of Christ. This was done following the queen's excommunication by the Pope Pius V in 1570. That act destroyed any hope of reconciliation with Rome and it was no longer necessary to fear that Article XXIX would offend Catholic sensibilities. The Articles, increased to Thirty-nine, were ratified by the Queen, and the bishops and clergy were required <b>to</b> <b>assent.</b>|$|E
25|$|Under {{letters patent}} dated 4 February 1867, the Straits Settlements were granted a colonial {{constitution}} {{in the usual}} form. The Governor of the Straits Settlements ruled {{with the help of}} an Executive Council and a Legislative Council. The Executive Council was made up of the Governor, the commanding officer of the troops in the Straits, and six senior officials (including the Colonial Secretary, Lieutenant-Governor of Penang, Attorney-General and Colonial Engineer). The Legislative Council, in which legislative authority was vested, consisted of the Executive Council and the Chief Justice (together known as the official members) and four unofficial members nominated by the Governor. As the unofficial members were outnumbered by the official members, they and the Governor (who had a casting vote) had effective control of the Council. Legislation was generally initiated by the Governor, and he had the power <b>to</b> <b>assent</b> to or veto bills. During legislative debates, official members were required to support the Governor but the unofficials could speak and vote as they wished. In 1924, the system was changed such that two unofficial members of the Legislative Council were nominated by the Governor to sit on the Executive Council. In addition, the number of members of the Legislative Council was increased to 26, with equal numbers of officials and unofficials. The Governor retained his casting vote. The Penang and European chambers of commerce each nominated one unofficial, while the Governor nominated the others on an ethnic basis: five Europeans including one each from Penang and Malacca, three Chinese British subjects, one Malay, one Indian and one Eurasian. This system remained in place until Singapore fell to the Japanese in 1942 during World War II.|$|E

500|$|The Synod {{still had}} no {{official}} confessional statement. The Church of Scotland and the Irish Synod of Ulster already required clergy {{to subscribe to the}} Westminster Confession. In 1729, the Synod passed the Adopting Act, which required clergy <b>to</b> <b>assent</b> to the Westminster Confession and Larger and Shorter Catechisms. However, subscription was only required for those parts of the Confession deemed an [...] "essential and necessary article of faith". Ministers could declare any [...] to their presbytery or the Synod, which would then decide if the minister's views were acceptable. While crafted as a compromise, the Adopting Act was opposed by those who favored strict adherence to the Confession.|$|E
500|$|Edward held Parliament on a {{reasonably}} regular basis throughout his reign. In 1295, however, {{a significant change}} occurred. For this Parliament, {{in addition to the}} secular and ecclesiastical lords, two knights from each county and two representatives from each borough were summoned. The representation of commons in Parliament was nothing new; what was new was the authority under which these representatives were summoned. Whereas previously the commons had been expected simply <b>to</b> <b>assent</b> to decisions already made by the magnates, it was now proclaimed that they should meet with the full authority (plena potestas) of their communities, to give assent to decisions made in Parliament. The King now had full backing for collecting lay subsidies from the entire population. Lay subsidies were taxes collected at a certain fraction of the moveable property of all laymen. Whereas Henry III had only collected four of these in his reign, Edward I collected nine. This format eventually became the standard for later Parliaments, and historians have named the assembly the [...] "Model Parliament".|$|E
500|$|In any case, {{the peace}} {{turned out to}} be of short duration. On 18 May 1803, {{slightly}} {{more than a year after}} the peace, war resumed. Napoleon was now intent on the destruction of Great Britain by culminating in an ambitious planned invasion. The Batavian Republic was to play a major supporting role in this. As the Franco-Batavian alliance's embodiment, the Staatsbewind was forced <b>to</b> <b>assent</b> to a Convention bringing the total of French and Batavian forces in the Netherlands to 35,000. In addition, 9,000 Batavian troops were earmarked for the proposed overseas expedition. Even more importantly, the Dutch were to supply, by December 1803, five ships-of-the-line, five frigates, 100 gun boats, and 250 flat-bottomed transport craft, capable of holding 60–80 men. In total the Dutch were meant to provide transport for 25,000 men and 2,500 horses; the major part of Napoleon's invasion [...] "armada", and all at Dutch expense. It was all a fantasy on Napoleon's part, but this did not diminish the real burden it imposed on the finances of the Republic, and on its economy.|$|E
5|$|The {{other two}} grounds relate to {{attempts}} by Parliament to circumvent or curtail the discretionary powers conferred on the President by the Constitution. Article 22H of the Constitution deals with attempts {{to alter the}} President's powers by introducing an ordinary bill. If this occurs, the President may exercise personal discretion <b>to</b> withhold <b>assent</b> <b>to</b> the bill. The Cabinet may, if it wishes, advise the President {{to refer to the}} Tribunal the question whether the bill in fact has the effect of circumventing or curtailing his discretionary powers.

500|$|In 1777, Antoine Lavoisier {{had written}} Mémoire sur la {{combustion}} en général, {{the first of}} what proved to be a series of attacks on phlogiston theory; it was against these attacks that Priestley responded in 1783. While Priestley accepted parts of Lavoisier's theory, he was unprepared <b>to</b> <b>assent</b> to the major revolutions Lavoisier proposed: the overthrow of phlogiston, a chemistry based conceptually on elements and compounds, and a new chemical nomenclature. Priestley's original experiments on [...] "dephlogisticated air" [...] (oxygen), combustion, and water provided Lavoisier with the data he needed to construct much of his system; yet Priestley never accepted Lavoisier's new theories and continued to defend phlogiston theory {{for the rest of his}} life. Lavoisier's system was based largely on the quantitative concept that mass is neither created nor destroyed in chemical reactions (i.e., the conservation of mass). By contrast, Priestley preferred to observe qualitative changes in heat, color, and particularly volume. His experiments tested [...] "airs" [...] for [...] "their solubility in water, their power of supporting or extinguishing flame, whether they were respirable, how they behaved with acid and alkaline air, and with nitric oxide and inflammable air, and lastly how they were affected by the electric spark." ...|$|E
2500|$|Before a bill officially becomes law, the President must assent to it.
