This use is closest to the goal and practice of Mrs. Reed, the original 6th grade teacher who had taken training with Dr. William Glasser on Reality Therapy for classroom teachers. The training led her to use the private written conversations to model the pragmatic, problem-solving perspective of Reality Therapy and to encourage students to <b>think</b> <b>through</b> issues and problems with her guidance. Of her writing with the students, she said, “I cannot think of any better way to learn so much about my students, myself, and my own teaching”.|$|E

According to the 12th-century historian William of Malmesbury, Gerbert got {{the idea of the}} computing device of the abacus from a Spanish Arab. The abacus that Gerbert reintroduced into Europe had its length divided into 27 parts with 9 number symbols (this would exclude zero, which was represented by an empty column) and 1,000 characters in all, crafted out of animal horn by a shieldmaker of Rheims. According to his pupil Richer, Gerbert could perform speedy calculations with his abacus that were extremely difficult for people in his day to <b>think</b> <b>through</b> in using only Roman numerals. Due to Gerbert's reintroduction, the abacus became widely used in Europe once again during the 11th century.|$|E

[...] Because of this, [...] "they pushed back and this jaw went back and forth quite a bit to help navigate where they wanted the tone on any given day". These different poses helped the two teams perfect the jaw scenes. [...] "From a marketing point of view, from all the test screenings they did", said Norby, [...] "there was a lot of work figuring out how to make this a scary film as well as a funny film."

John Szczepaniak praised its pacing and quality of writing, and considers the gameplay and plot to be sophisticated for its time.

Nintendo's successful [...] series of adventure games were also inspired by Portopia. USgamer compared it to the later Police Quest adventure games and CSI television series, as well as classic Sherlock Holmes novels.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to the aphorisms which conclude Dialectic of Enlightenment, Adorno put together a collection of aphorisms in honor of Horkheimer's fiftieth birthday that would later be published as Minima Moralia: Reflections from Damaged Life. These fragmentary writings, inspired by a renewed reading of Nietzsche, treated issues like emigration, totalitarianism, and individuality, as well as everyday matters such as giving presents, dwelling and the impossibility of love. In California, Adorno made the acquaintance of Charlie Chaplin and became friends with Fritz Lang and Hanns Eisler, with whom he completed a study of film music in 1944. In this study, the authors pushed for the greater usage of avant-garde music in film, urging that music be used to supplement, not simply accompany, the visual aspect of films. Additionally, Adorno assisted Thomas Mann on his novel Doctor Faustus after the latter asked for his help.

2500|$|In {{the book}} Intentional Interruption: Breaking Down Learning Barriers to Professional Practice, Steven Katz and Lisa Ain Dack {{identified}} six mental barriers to learning in PLCs: [...] "we don't <b>think</b> <b>through</b> all possibilities; {{we focus on}} confirming our hypotheses and not challenging them; we pay {{too much attention to}} things that are vivid; we consider ourselves to be exceptions; we hesitate to take action in a new direction; we don't want others to see our vulnerabilities". Katz and Dack opt for a psychological definition of learning: [...] "Learning is the process through which experience causes permanent change in knowledge or behaviour". It is the characteristic of permanence which raises the bar for all professional learning, because learning as permanent change is not easy or natural to achieve. Katz and Dack urge designers of professional learning to avoid the [...] "activity trap" [...] of assuming that participation in a protocol or process guarantees real learning has occurred or putting so much emphasis on the activity that learning is lost in the shuffle.|$|E

At the moment, I suspect it was this: I had done what I felt I had to do in jazz. I had decided it did not hold the deepest interest for me musically.

Also, the endless repetition of material in the Goodman band – playing the same tunes day after day and night after night – got to me.

[...] Shortly after, Toru finds out through a meeting with Noboru and Malta that Kumiko has apparently been spending time with another man and wants to end her relationship with Toru. Confused, Toru tries several things to calm himself and <b>think</b> <b>through</b> the situation: talking and taking up work with May Kasahara, hiding at the bottom of the well, and loitering around the city looking at people. Work with May involves tallying up people with some degree of baldness at a subway line for a wig company. While at the bottom of the well (of the abandoned house), Toru reminisces about earlier times with Kumiko, including their first date to an aquarium where they looked at jellyfish. He also experiences a dreamlike sequence where he enters a hotel room and speaks with a woman, and notices a strange blue mark on his cheek after he leaves the well. While loitering in the city, he spends most of the day sitting outside a donut shop and people-watching. Through this activity Toru encounters a well-dressed woman and also a singer he recognizes from his past, whom he follows and beats with a bat after getting ambushed by him.|$|E
2500|$|Cao Cao often praised Xun You and said, [...] "Gongda is {{intelligent}} but appears foolish; he is courageous but appears cowardly; he is resilient but appears weak.

2500|$|Prestige {{of colleges}} {{correlates}} with age, {{such that the}} oldest east-coast schools tend to have accumulated the most prestige {{by virtue of their}} longevity. There is widespread consensus that the fit between a student and a school is an important factor. Several reports suggest that [...] "fit should trump prestige every single time," [...] and that it is better for a school to match a student in terms of social, cultural, and academic qualities and not be chosen simply because of a school's prestige. Others see college admissions as essentially a choice between [...] "price and prestige". Elite colleges have been compared to designer labels, a valuable credential in the job market, and an entryway into top graduate schools. Some advisors specialize in helping students find a good fit—a suitable list of colleges—which helps students in the long run. They help students to explore their values and needs, and provide counseling to help both students and parents find a college or university program that helps students meet long-term goals. Questions include thinking about life goals, which activities a person likes best, and what style of learning works best for the student.
