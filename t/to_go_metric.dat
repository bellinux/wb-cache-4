5000|$|The 2000, 2003, and 2004 {{editions of}} the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices were {{published}} using both metric and American Customary Units. Metric signs, including speed signs in kilometers per hour, were displayed in the manual {{even though they were}} not normally used on the roads and there was no definite plan <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>metric.</b> For visual distinction, regulatory and advisory metric speed signs have black circles around the numbers followed by [...] "km/h" [...] and other regulatory metric signs have yellow plates reading [...] "METRIC" [...] in black on top of the main signs. Metric signs and metric measurements were removed for the 2009 edition and replaced with an appendix of metric conversion tables. This is in marked contrast to the position in the (largely metric) United Kingdom, where metric road signs are prohibited by law (except for those denoting widths and height restrictions, which include both metric and imperial units).Newer signs on state highways on the island of Kaua‘i in Hawai‘i also include distances in both miles and kilometers. Mile markers along highways on the Island of Hawaii will indicate both units whenever the whole kilometer corresponds approximately with the whole mile (e.g., 5 mi/8 km). In Houston, Texas, many speed limits have km/h signs underneath the MPH signs. These are located near both airports (Bush Intercontinental and Hobby) and in the Texas Medical Center. The U.S. territory of Puerto Rico generally uses American-style (MUTCD) signs with metric measurement on highways, displaying kilometer posts and distances in km, yet speed limit signs are in miles per hour. The Maine Turnpike has metric measurements on its highway signs in addition to customary measurements, partly to assist the large numbers of Canadian tourists who visit Maine's beaches.|$|E
40|$|The {{introduction}} of the metric system in Dutch medicine 1820 - 1880 The Netherlands went metric in 1820 and the medical sciences were supposed to follow suit, except for apothecaries weight, which {{was very close to}} the Anglo-Saxon variant and was not abolished before 1870. Doctors and pharmacists had opposed metric weights in pharmacy in 1820 because they were afraid of errors that could lead to loss of life. On the continent old local and Paris units were used in general medical science. It took many decades for the metric system to become predominant in trade and daily life. The same slow acceptance was reflected in the medical sciences. Before it began to make tentative inroads, the metric system was entirely ignored for at least 15 years by the Dutch medical professions. Articles and other texts in medical magazines illustrate this. The slow advance of metric was also hindered by international, especially German influences. The other European nations began <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>metric</b> from 1840 onwards and France was the first to do so. Under Napoleon Bonaparte France had reverted to old units for daily life and retail trade in 1812. When Germany, a nation with a profound influence on Dutch medical science, went metric in 1870, the ultimate collapse of the old units began. Their presence in magazines dwindled and branches of medical science such as obstetrics and ophtalmology went metric; the former changed slowly and without planning, the latter went metric after an international agreement in 1866...|$|E

In 1968, more than 75% of Australia's exports <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>metric</b> countries, and at that time it was noted that all countries except the United States were metric or were converting to the metric system.

They also noted that school pupils were widely familiar with the metric system because it had been taught in the schools for many years.|$|R
