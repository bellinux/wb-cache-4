They name themselves the First Druid Council. Brona, a rogue Druid, and his followers leave, taking the Ildatch with them; this magical tome controls their minds. 250 years later, Brona begins the First War of the Races when he convinces all Men to attack the other races. He almost succeeds in seizing rule of the Four Lands, but the tide turns, and the war ends with his defeat and disappearance. The Druids divide the Four Lands among the races and become reclusive, withdrawing to Paranor because of their shame at the betrayal by one of their own members.|$|E

5|$|All of the {{children}} attended the nearby George Street State School {{and one by one}} the brothers joined the Fitzroy Cricket Club as they reached their early teens. The club had a program whereby they gave a medal for every local school to award to the best cricketer in their ranks in that year. The successful student would then be given access <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> club's facilities. All of the Harvey brothers were recipients were of this medal. At Fitzroy, they came under the influence of former Victorian all-rounder Arthur Liddicut and the club's veteran captain Joe Plant. The Harveys had no formal coaching, and their father, although a regular presence at the club, chose to stay in the background as their respective careers developed. Horace did not advise his sons on how to bat, allowing them to formulate their own style and technique. According to the Harvey brothers, it was their mother who was vocal and extroverted, in contrast to their reserved father. The boys who failed to score runs were given kitchen duty and according to them, their parents never showed favouritism.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 75, Isaac {{moved to}} Beer-lahai-roi after his father died. When the land {{experienced}} famine, he removed to the Philistine land of Gerar where his father once lived. This land was still {{under the control of}} King Abimelech {{as it was in the}} days of Abraham. Like his father, Isaac also deceived Abimelech about his wife and also got into the well business. He had gone back <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wells that his father dug and saw that they were all stopped up with earth. The Philistines did this after Abraham died. So, Isaac unearthed them and began to dig for more wells all the way to Beersheba, where he made a pact with Abimelech, just like in the day of his father.|$|E

5|$|Following overhaul, Texas resumed duty {{with the}} Atlantic Fleet early in 1919. On 10 March, {{she became the}} first American {{battleship}} to launch an airplane when Lieutenant Commander Edward O. McDonnell flew a British-built Sopwith Camel off the warship. Later in 1919 Texass captain, Nathan C. Twining, successfully employed naval aircraft to spot the fall of shells during a main battery exercise. The results were that aircraft-borne gunfire spotters were significantly more accurate than shipboard spotters. In testimony to the Navy General Board, Lieutenant Commander Kenneth Whiting attested that the increase in gunfire effectiveness with air spotting was likely to be as great as 200%. As a result of these first experiments, the Navy would add floatplanes <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fleet's battleships and newer cruisers. In May 1919, Texas served as a plane guard and navigational aid for the successful attempt by Navy Curtiss NC flying boat NC-4 to become the first airplane to cross the Atlantic. On 26 July 1919 Texas entered the Pacific Ocean as part of the newly formed Pacific Fleet and she would spend the next five and half years as a part of Pacific Fleet. On 17 July the following year, she was designated BB-35 under the Navy's newly adopted alpha-numeric system of hull classification symbols.|$|E
5|$|Following the Spanish–American War, {{which gave}} Cuba its {{independence}} from Spain, many anarchists were dissatisfied with the conditions that persisted after independence. They cited conditions that were perpetuated by the new government, like suppression of labor movements, US occupations, and dissatisfaction with the school systems. By 1899, anarchist workers had reorganized themselves, under the Alianza de Trabajadores (Worker's Alliance). By September of this year, five of the groups organizers had been arrested, following a mason's strike which spread <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> construction trade. Around this time, anarchist organizer Errico Malatesta visited Cuba, giving speeches, and interviews to several periodicals, but was soon barred from further speaking engagements by civil governor Emilio Nuñez. Around 1902-03, anarchists and other labor organizers began to attempt to organize the sugar industry, then the largest industry in Cuba. But owners responded quickly, and two workers were murdered, and the crimes never solved.|$|E
5|$|For the box set release, Quatermass and the Pit was {{extensively}} restored. A {{process called}} VidFIRE was applied <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scenes originally broadcast live, restoring the fluid interlaced video look {{they would have}} had on transmission, but which was lost during the telerecording process. For the pre-filmed scenes, most of the high-quality original 35mm film inserts still existed, as they had been spliced into the 1959–60 compilation repeat version in place of the lower-quality telerecorded versions of the same sequences. As this compilation also survived in the BBC archives, these film sequences were able to be digitally remastered and inserted into the newly restored episodic version for the DVD release. The compilation used a separate magnetic soundtrack, and although the original had decayed a safety copy had survived. This yielded better sound quality than the optical soundtracks accompanying the original episodes, and was therefore the main source for the audio remastering except in the case of scenes that were not in the compilation, and in a few cases where faults on the magnetic tracks necessitated their replacement by the optical versions.|$|E

5|$|Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) {{dreams of}} a red light that leads him to the corpse {{of a young girl}} buried in a park in Manassas, Virginia. When he awakens, he heads to the park and finds the girl's skeleton. The girl was {{determined}} to have been murdered by John Lee Roche (Tom Noonan), a serial killer who murdered thirteen girls throughout the 1980s; his modus operandi was cutting a heart out of the clothes of each victim. Mulder had captured Roche by deducing that he committed the murders while traveling as a vacuum cleaner salesman. Roche's hearts were never found, although he confessed <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> murders.|$|E
5|$|From its {{beginnings}} in the 1930s, ski flying has developed its own distinct history and given rise <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sport's world records. The first hill {{designed specifically for}} ski flying was built in Slovenia in 1934, after which both Germany and Austria built their own hills in 1950. This was followed by Norway in 1966, the United States in 1970, and the Czech Republic in 1980. From the 1960s to 1980s, a friendly rivalry between the European venues saw world records being set regularly, together with hill upgrades and evolutions in technique to fly longer distances.|$|E
5|$|GTAW {{can be used}} {{on nearly}} all {{weldable}} metals, though it is most often applied to stainless steel and light metals. It is often used when quality welds are extremely important, such as in bicycle, aircraft and naval applications. A related process, plasma arc welding, also uses a tungsten electrode but uses plasma gas to make the arc. The arc is more concentrated than the GTAW arc, making transverse control more critical and thus generally restricting the technique to a mechanized process. Because of its stable current, the method {{can be used on}} a wider range of material thicknesses than can the GTAW process and it is much faster. It can be applied <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same materials as GTAW except magnesium, and automated welding of stainless steel is one important application of the process. A variation of the process is plasma cutting, an efficient steel cutting process.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the empty cenotaph, another new form of memorial, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, used the idea of burying one of the unidentified bodies from the war as a symbolic memorial <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lost soldiers. This idea had begun to emerge {{towards the end of}} the war, and was actively promoted by some British veterans' groups in 1919. Initially, however, it failed to gain traction with the government because of the success of the Whitehall Cenotaph, and a second memorial was felt to be unnecessary. Finally, in 1920, following lobbying by British cleric David Railton, Britain and France both decided to create a Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, choosing an unknown body and creating a special memorial around it; the tombs were inaugurated on Armistice Day. The choice of location for the French tomb proved controversial, however, and it was not finalised until the following year, when the body was laid to rest under the Arc de Triumph. The concept proved popular, and encouraged similar memorials in other countries.|$|E
