5|$|Joan Young, who was {{the only}} {{first-hand}} witness, is challenged in both articles. She came forward in 2004, claiming {{that she had seen}} someone push something over the side of a boat on Coniston Water. This testimony is challenged, because so much time has passed and the fact that her husband saw nothing. However, he claims to have been reading his paper at the time. Also, {{it has been said that}} Young was too far away to identify <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> boat, and that it couldn't have been Carol Park's body that was being dumped, as the Youngs were positioned so that the location Carol's body was found would have been visibly blocked by an island. The article even points out that Young described a boat that appeared to be a cruiser yacht. Despite the fact that Gordon did own a large yacht in 1997, in 1976 he owned only a 505 racing dinghy, which he sold later that year.|$|E

25|$|Patrick Hew {{used the}} Chinese Room {{argument}} to deduce requirements from military {{command and control}} systems {{if they are to}} preserve a commander's moral agency. He drew an analogy between a commander in their command center and <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Chinese Room, and analyzed it under a reading of Aristotleâ€™s notions of 'compulsory' and 'ignorance'. Information could be 'down converted' from meaning to symbols, and manipulated symbolically, but moral agency could be undermined if there was inadequate 'up conversion' into meaning. Hew cited examples from the USS Vincennes incident.|$|E
25|$|The insula {{is active}} during social {{decision}} making. Tiziana Quarto et al. measured emotional intelligence (EI) (the ability to identify, regulate, and process emotions {{of themselves and}} of others) of sixty-three healthy subjects. Using fMRI EI was measured in correlation with left insular activity. The subjects were shown various pictures of facial expressions and tasked with deciding to approach or avoid <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> picture. The results of the social decision task yielded that individuals with high EI scores had left insular activation when processing fearful faces. Individuals with low EI scores had left insular activation when processing angry faces.|$|E

25|$|Although often {{prevented}} and treatable if detected early, pressure ulcers can be {{very difficult}} to prevent in critically ill people, frail elders, individuals with impaired mobility such as wheelchair users (especially where spinal injury is involved). Primary prevention is to redistribute pressure by regularly turning the person. The benefit of turning to avoid further sores is well documented since at least the 19th century. In addition to turning and re-positioning <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bed or wheelchair, eating a balanced diet with adequate protein and keeping the skin free from exposure to urine and stool is very important.|$|E
25|$|The Werther effect {{not only}} predicts an {{increase}} in suicide, {{but the majority of}} the suicides will take place in the same or a similar way as the one publicized. The more similar <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> publicized suicide is to the people exposed to the information about it, the more likely the age group or demographic is to die by suicide. The increase generally happens only in areas where the suicide story was highly publicized. Upon learning of someone else's suicide, some people decide that action may be appropriate for them as well, especially if the publicized suicide was of someone in a similar situation as them.|$|E
25|$|The main {{activity}} in co-counselling involves participants arranging to meet regularly in pairs {{to give each}} other peer-to-peer counselling, in turn taking the role of counsellor and client, with equal amounts of time allocated to each. Co-counselling functions by giving people an opportunity to work on whatever issues they choose with the accepting support of another person, with whom they have no actual relationship. <b>The</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> role of counsellor acts as a facilitator to the client, sometimes as a third-party observer and sometimes as a second-party confidant. While co-counselling is sometimes practiced outside a formal organisation, formal co-counselling organisations have developed leadership and support structures, including trainings and retreats.|$|E

40|$|The Fecal {{microflora}} of 15 healthy elderly {{persons with}} a median age of 84 years {{in a rural area}} whose inhabitants tend to be long-lived (Yuzurihara-area, Uenohara, Yamanashi Prefecture) was compared with the microflora of individuals {{with a median}} age of 68 years in an urban area (Tokyo). The diet of <b>the</b> elderly <b>persons</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Yuzurihara area is characterized by a high intake of dietary fiber. Total numbers of anaerobic bacteria were significantly smaller <b>in</b> <b>the</b> elderly <b>persons</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Yuzurihara area than those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tokyo area. A significantly large number of bifidobacteria, but not of lecithinase-negative clostridia, was observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> elderly <b>persons</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Yuzurihara area. Large numbers and high incidences of bacilli and lecithinase-positive clostridia (mainly Clostridium perfringens) were found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> elderly <b>persons</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tokyo area. Twenty-five genera and over 81 species were isolated from <b>the</b> elderly <b>persons</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Yuzurihara area, and 25 genera and over 92 species were isolated from <b>the</b> elderly <b>persons</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tokyo area. Furthermore, significantly larger numbers of Bifidobacterium adolescentis and Fusobacterium mortiferum strains were found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Yuzurihara group, but significant reductions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bacteroides buccae-oris group, B. thetaiotaomicron, Bacteroides spp., C. coccoides, C. paraputrificum, and Clostridium spp. were observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same group. A significantly higher isolation rate of Bacillus subtilis was observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> elderly <b>persons</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tokyo area. <b>The</b> difference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fecal microflora between elderly <b>persons</b> <b>in</b> Yuzurihara and those <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Tokyo area might be due to a difference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> intake of dietary fiber...|$|R

25|$|The {{nature of}} nursing means that nursing ethics tends {{to examine the}} ethics of caring rather than 'curing' by {{exploring}} the everyday interaction between the nurse and the person in care. Early work to define ethics in nursing focused more on the virtues {{that would make a}} good nurse, which historically included loyalty to the physician, rather than the focus being on nurse's conduct in relation to <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nurse's care. In recent times, the ethics of nursing has also shifted more towards the nurse's obligation to respect the human rights and dignity of the patient and this is reflected in a number of professional codes for nurses, such as in the latest code from the International Council of Nurses.|$|E
25|$|Hold 'em is {{normally}} played using {{small and big}} blind betsâ€” forced bets by two players. Antes (forced contributions by all players) {{may be used in}} addition to blinds, particularly in later stages of tournament play. A dealer button is used to represent the player in the dealer position; the dealer button rotates clockwise after each hand, changing the position of the dealer and blinds. The small blind is posted by the player {{to the left of the}} dealer and is usually equal to half of the big blind. The big blind, posted by the player to the left of the small blind, is equal to the minimum bet. In tournament poker, the blind/ante structure periodically increases as the tournament progresses. After one round of betting is done, the next betting round will start by <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> small blind.|$|E

25|$|But then {{a mysterious}} {{person in a}} Krabby Patty-costume defeats {{all four of the}} {{restaurant}} managers, saves SpongeBob and takes him back to the Krusty Krab. It turns out that the Krusty Krab has gone downhill ever since Mr. Krabs fired SpongeBob and took over as the fry cook. Squidward reveals himself as <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> costume, and explains that as much as he hates SpongeBob (which SpongeBob himself acknowledges), he hates the smell of burning Krabby Patties even more, and both he and Mr. Krabs ask SpongeBob to be the fry cook again, with Mr. Krabs admitting that he made a huge mistake in firing SpongeBob in the first place. SpongeBob gladly accepts his old job as the fry cook, and puts the restaurant back on track, which brings back all the customers, even the four restaurant managers who fought over SpongeBob. At the end of the episode, Mr. Krabs reveals that he has installed a pay toilet that costs a nickel to use, thus making up the nickel that he previously lost by hiring SpongeBob.|$|E
25|$|In the LDS Church today, {{both men}} and women may enter a {{celestial}} marriage with only one living partner at a time. A man may be sealed to more than one woman. If his wife dies, he may enter another celestial marriage, and be sealed to both his living wife and deceased wife or wives. Many Mormons believe that all these marriages will be valid in the eternities and the husband will live together in the celestial kingdom as a family with all to whom he was sealed. In 1998, the LDS Church changed the policy and now also allows women to be sealed to more than one man. A woman, however, may not be sealed to more than one man at a time while she is alive. She may only be sealed to subsequent partners after she has died. Proxy sealings, like proxy baptisms, are merely offered to <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> afterlife. According to church teachings, the celestial marriage covenant, as with other covenants, requires the continued righteousness of the couple to remain in effect after this life. If only one remains righteous that person is promised a righteous eternal companion in eternity.|$|E
