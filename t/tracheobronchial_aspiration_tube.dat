40|$|We {{present a}} case of a 66 -year-old Caucasian man with acute {{respiratory}} distress. The patient had a history of multiple cerebrovascular accidents which resulted in left hemiplegia, swallowing problems, and aphasia. He was tentatively diagnosed with aspiration pneumonia.

However, the patient developed a Staphylococcus epidermidis sepsis and despite adequate antibiotic therapy, he eventually died. Dental prosthesis aspiration is a medical situation associated with a higher morbidity and mortality rate compared to ingested foreign bodies.

Laparoscopic hysterectomy surgery requires that the uterus be removed through a laparoscopic port. To achieve this, the Endoblend liquefies the uterus {{through the use of}} cutting blades. The Endoblend has a stem containing <b>aspiration</b> <b>tubes,</b> irrigation tubes and power transmission elements. A spinning blade is attached {{at the end of this}} stem for the purpose of liquefying previously separated tissues such that they can be removed from the abdominal cavity through the <b>aspiration</b> <b>tubes.</b> In order to effectively process the tissues, they must be placed with a sealed enclosure. This enclosure is at risk of being compromised by the spinning blades and therefore the need arises for a guard module to prevent this. The guard module must function to direct the tissue towards the blades and prevent any tearing of the enclosure. It must also be capable of fitting through a 15 mm laparoscopic port. A guard has been developed comprising of three Nitinol rings and an ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene fiber.

40|$|Background: Enteral {{nutrition}} (EN) tolerance {{is often}} monitored by aspirating stomach contents by syringe at prescribed intervals. No {{studies have been}} conducted to assess the most appropriate time interval for aspirating gastric tubes. We compared gastric <b>tube</b> <b>aspirations</b> every 4 hours (usual care) with a variable regimen (up to every 8 hours aspirations). Methods: This randomized controlled trial (RCT) enrolled patients who stayed {{in the intensive care unit}} (ICU) for > 48 hours, had a gastric tube, and were likely to receive EN for 3 or more days. Patients were randomized (computer-generated randomization) to either the control (every 4 hours) or intervention group (variable regimen). The primary outcome was number of gastric <b>tube</b> <b>aspirations</b> per day from randomization until EN was ceased or up to 2 weeks postrandomization. Results: Following Institutional Ethics Committee approval, 357 patients were recruited (control group, n = 179; intervention group, n = 178). No differences were found in age, sex, worst APACHE II score, or time to start of EN. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the intervention group had fewer <b>tube</b> <b>aspirations</b> per day (3. 4 versus 5. 4 in the control group, P <. 001).

This study documents the etiology, clinical presentation, treatment, and treatment results of suppurative pleuropulmonary disease at Queens Hospital Center, which serves {{a large segment of}} the urban poor, many of whom are black. Results indicate that contributory or antecedent etiologic factors include a history of prior disease (specifically pneumonia, lung abscess, obstructive lung disease, pulmonary neoplasia, and tuberculosis); a predisposition to constitutional or immunologic deficiencies (specifically, alcoholism, anemia/malnutrition, drug abuse, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome [AIDS]); conditions contributing to <b>tracheobronchial</b> <b>aspiration</b> (specifically, alcoholism and seizure disorders); and a miscellaneous group such as prior surgery, cardiovascular disease, and sepsis syndrome. The patients in this study were young with maximal incidence occurring in the third to fifth decades of life. Patients were predominantly male (75 %) and black (66 %). There were 18 deaths (23 %), with sepsis being the cause in 10 (56 %). Most surgical interventions were conservative, ie, bronchoscopies (48), thoracenteses (43), and tube thoracotomies (39). Thirty-one open thoracotomies were performed for drainage, decortication, or pulmonary resection. The surgical mortality was three cases or 5 % of the patients who underwent surgery.

40|$|Objective: {{to study}} the causes of acute intranatal hypoxia and reveal a {{relationship}} of placental changes to respiratory failure (RF) in newborn infants. Subjects and methods. The investigation included 252 neonates with the complicated course of an early neonatal period. Their gestational age was 26 weeks to 40 weeks, birth weight varied from 850 g to 4100 g. 95. 3 % of the newborn infants were born with a low Apgar score and RF, which required mechanical ventilation immediately after birth. The neonatal status was clinically evaluated; the values of blood gas composition and acid-base balance were recorded; the pathogen was discharged from the tracheobronchial tree; chest X-ray survey and placental morphological examination were performed. Results. The main cause of neonatal respiratory failure is chronic intrauterine hypoxia caused by placental inflammatory changes and fetal-placental blood circulatory disorders, which gives rise to preterm delivery, cerebral hemodynamic disorders, and neonatal amniotic fluid aspiration. Bacteriological examination of <b>tracheobronchial</b> <b>aspirations</b> showed that no microflora growth occured {{in the majority of}} the newborns acute intranatal hypoxia. Enterococcus faecalis and Staphylococcus epidermidis were isolated in 12. 3 % and 8. 7 %, respectively. Growth of в-hemolytic streptococcus was observed in 2. 8 % of cases. The rate of microbial association specific only for rate premature infants with neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (NRDS) was 4. 8 %. Conclusion. Placental changes causing fetal-placental circulatory disorders were ascertained to be responsible for acute intranatal and postnatal neonatal hypoxia. Placental inflammatory changes occurred in the majority of cases, as confirmed by bacteriological examinations of neonatal infants. Isolation of the varying microbial flora in infants with RF to a greater extent is, indicative of the infectious process occurring in the maternal body.

40|$|Between 1964 and 1979, a {{total of}} 1, 536 {{patients}} with carcinoma of the thoracic esophagus were treated at the authors' center. Of these, 142 patients with unresectable tumor underwent the Kirschner operation for palliation. In this operation, esophageal obstruction is bypassed by subcutaneous or retrosternal gastric esophagoplasty, and the thoracic esophagus defunctionalized by a long Roux-en-Y jejunal loop to the abdominal esophagus. Dysphagia is thus relieved and aspiration of esophageal and gastric contents into the respiratory tract avoided. Any patient who was not discharged from the hospital for any reason and eventually died in the hospital is counted as a mortality. The hospital mortality for these 142 patients was 41. 5 % (59 patients). In recent {{years there has been}} a reduction in mortality rate. The most common cause of death was progressive bronchopneumonia (72. 9 %). Leakage of anastomosis occurred in 67 patients (47. 2 %), but most healed on conservative treatment. The ability to eat normally was restored in 69 % of survivors, and another 28 % were able to tolerate a soft diet. Although temporary postoperative aspiration was occasionally encountered when the patient started oral feeding, once swallowing was established, <b>tracheobronchial</b> <b>aspiration</b> did not occur. The mean survival of the discharged patients was 5. 0 months. Malignant cachexia from growth of the primary tumor accounted for 61. 4 % of late deaths; metastatic disease, 10. 8 %; and cardiopulmonary insufficiency, the remainder. One patient is alive more than 5 years after operation, and presumably was cured by postoperative radiotherapy. Although the mortality rate of the Kirschner operation is substantial, other forms of treatment also have significant mortality rates but with less palliative potential. Therefore, we would recommend this operation for the palliation of unresectable carcinoma of the esophagus. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Once the R. equi in the mare feces were quantified and the total concentrations of R. equi determined, a colony immunoblot procedure was performed to detect {{the presence of the}} virulence-associated protein antigen on the isolates. This allowed for the proportion and concentration of virulent R. equi to be determined. Foals that were found to have ultrasonographic evidence of peripheral pulmonary abscessation or consolidation underwent aseptic trans-cutaneous <b>tracheobronchial</b> <b>aspiration.</b> Positive results of TBA were used to categorize foals as affected with R. equi pneumonia.

However, significant differences were not observed in either the fecal concentrations of total or virulent R. equi from dams of affected foals compared to dams of unaffected foals. No significant temporal changes in the fecal concentrations of R. equi were observed. It was concluded that dams of affected foals do not shed more R. equi in feces than do dams of unaffected foals, indicating that heavier shedding by particular mares does not explain infection in their foals.

40|$|A {{study of}} 720 autopsy cases from the Instituto Nacional de Neurologia, SSA (INN) and the Centro Hospitalario 20 de Noviembre ISSTE (CH 20 N) {{was made in}} order to {{investigate}} the frequency of aspiration in postmortem material of neurological cases. Aspiration occurred in 12. 5 % and 6. 5 %, respectively, of the cases under study. The clinical features of both groups were quite similar, and slight differences could {{not account for the}} uneven proportion of aspira-tion. When correlating {{the presence or absence of}} aspiration in both groups with and without the use of a gastric tube, a significant correlation was found between the use of a tube and the postmortem finding of <b>aspiration.</b> Gastric <b>tube</b> (tube feeding) increases the risk of aspiration six times. Our results support the view that opposes the early, indiscriminate and incautious use of tube feeding in the comatose patient.

40|$|Abstract Background Respiratory tract {{infections are}} common in {{intensive}} care units (ICU), with incidences reported from 10 to 65 %, and case fatality rates over 20 % in pneumonia. This {{study was designed to}} identify risk factors for the development of an early onset respiratory tract infection (ERI) and to review the microbiological profile and the effectiveness of first intention antibiotic therapy. Methods Case-control, retrospective clinical study of the patients admitted to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of our hospital, a teaching and tertiary care facility, from January to September 2000 who had a respiratory tract infection diagnosed in the first 5 days of hospital stay. Results Of the 385 patients admitted to our unit: 129 (33, 5 %) had a diagnosis of ERI and 86 patients were admitted to the control group. Documented aspiration (adjusted OR = 5, 265; 95 % CI = 1, 155 – 24, 007) and fractured ribs (adjusted OR = 12, 150; 95 % CI = 1, 571 – 93, 941) were found to be independent risk factors for the development of ERI (multiple logistic regression model performed with the diagnostic group as dependent variable and adjusted for age, sex, SAPS II, documented aspiration, non-elective oro-tracheal intubation (OTI), fractured ribs, pneumothorax and pleural effusion). A total of 78 organisms were isolated in 61 patients (47 %). The normal flora of the upper airway (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenza and Moraxella catharralis) accounted for 72 % of all isolations achieved, polimicrobian infections were responsible for 25 % of all microbiological documented infections. First intention treatment was, in 62 % of the patients, the association amoxacillin+clavulanate, being effective in 75 % of the patients to whom it was administered. The patients with ERI needed more days of OTI (6 vs 2, p Conclusion In this study documented <b>tracheobronchial</b> <b>aspiration</b> and fractured ribs were identified as independent risk factors for ERI. Microbiological profile was dominated by sensitive micro-organisms. The choice amoxacilin+clavulanate revealed to be a good option with an effectiveness rate of 77 % in the patients in whom it was used. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background {{and study}} aims: Capsule {{endoscopy}} {{may play a}} role in the evaluation of patients presenting with acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage in the emergency department. Patients and methods: We evaluated adults with acute upper gastrointestinal hemorrhage presenting to the emergency departments of two academic centers. Patients ingested a wireless video capsule, which was followed immediately by a nasogastric <b>tube</b> <b>aspiration</b> and later by esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). We compared capsule endoscopy with nasogastric <b>tube</b> <b>aspiration</b> for determination of the presence of blood, and with EGD for discrimination of the source of bleeding, identification of peptic/inflammatory lesions, safety, and patient satisfaction. Results: The study enrolled 49 patients (32 men, 17 women; mean age 58. 3  ±  19 years), but three patients did not complete the capsule endoscopy and five were intolerant of the nasogastric tube. Blood was detected in the upper gastrointestinal tract significantly more often by capsule endoscopy (15  / 18 [83. 3...|$|R
