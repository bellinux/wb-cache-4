[...] When asked about any possible influence from MGM's popular 1939 film adaptation of The Wizard of Oz, Lumet stated that [...] "there {{was nothing to be}} gained from [...] other than to make certain we didn't use anything from it.

500|$|Since Doofenshmirtz and Perry's actions tend {{to affect}} {{those of the}} boys, the choice to have future Candace's {{interference}} in the past greatly affect those of Doofenshmirtz and Perry's was considered the logical choice. Povenmire explained, [...] "They affect each other in ways <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>never</b> fully understand, but if you throw off that little balance of power of their [...] activities, all hell could break loose." [...] The song Doofenshmirtz sings, entitled [...] "It's Been a Charmed Life," [...] was well-praised by the production crew, who {{felt that it was}} considerably well-handled. The song centralized the irony surrounding Doofenshmirtz having everything go well for him, a theme completely different from that which is generally touched upon in the series.|$|E
500|$|On 24 April 1976, McCartney and Lennon were {{watching}} {{an episode of}} Saturday Night Live together at Lennon's home in the Dakota, when Lorne Michaels made a $3,000 cash offer for the Beatles to reunite. While they seriously considered going to the SNL studio a few blocks away, they decided it was too late. This was their last time together. VH1 fictionalised this event in the 2000 television film Two of Us. McCartney's last telephone call to Lennon, days before Lennon and Ono released Double Fantasy, was friendly; he said this about the call: [...] " [...] a consoling factor for me, because I do feel it was sad <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>never</b> actually sat down and straightened our differences out.

500|$|In {{a second}} paper {{presented}} in May 1914, Franck and Hertz {{reported on the}} light emission by the mercury atoms that had absorbed energy from collisions. They showed that the wavelength of this ultraviolet light corresponded exactly to the 4.9eV of energy that the flying electron had lost. The relationship of energy and wavelength had also been predicted by Bohr. Franck and Hertz completed their last paper together in December 1918. In it, they reconciled the discrepancies between their results and Bohr's theory, which they now acknowledged. In his Nobel lecture, Franck admitted that it was [...] "completely incomprehensible that we had failed to recognise the fundamental significance of Bohr’s theory, so much so, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>never</b> even mentioned it once". On 10 December 1926, Franck and Hertz were awarded the 1925 Nobel Prize in Physics [...] "for their discovery of the laws governing the impact of an electron upon an atom.".|$|E

500|$|White Dog's roots {{lie with}} a 1970 autobiographical novel written by Romain Gary {{of the same}} name. The story was {{purchased}} for use by Paramount in 1975, with Curtis Hanson selected to write the screenplay and Roman Polanski hired to direct. Before shooting commenced, Polanski was charged with statutory rape and fled the country, leaving the production in limbo. Over a span of six years, the project was given to various writers and producers, who all focused on the stray dog story from Gary's original work. Gary's activist wife was replaced in the script with a young, unmarried actress because Paramount wanted to contrast the dog's random attacks with a loving relationship between the protagonist and the dog. Paramount executives noted that they wanted a [...] "Jaws with paws" [...] and indicated that they wanted any racial elements to be downplayed. In one memo, the company noted: [...] "Given the organic elements of this story, it is imperative <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>never</b> overtly address through attitude or statement the issue of racism per se." ...|$|E
500|$|Another {{incentive}} for the show was to get more people to use the Internet. Sathe stated {{that it was an}} opportunity for younger people to bring the older members of their families onto the internet, and Yorke hoped that it would bring people onto the internet who had not used it before. Simon Nelson, BBC Vision controller of multiplatform and portfolio, said that this was an opportunity for the BBC to develop its expertise in drama production by exploiting the creative potential of the Internet to create a new online drama where few have succeeded. EastEnders: E20 primarily operates as a standalone series but also cross-references storylines of the main soap. According to Santer, the series also explores the stories of the soap's anonymous bystanders. He said, [...] "There are always other people [...] milling round the market and houses <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>never</b> go into. There are four or five parallels you could do. It will be nice to see well-known characters through strangers' eyes. Ian Beale may show up and he is just a strange, irritating man. Or they might ask: 'Who is that moody girl in the market?' And it will be Stacey Slater." ...|$|E

The answer is no one, because she’s Kim Poss-ib-le." [...] The same website also included the character in its article [...] "Disney Redheads: An Appreciation Post". Kim is also regarded as a fashion trendsetter, with Charmaine Simmons of Bustle crediting the character with popularizing [...] "all of the stylish looks <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>never</b> knew we'd {{be in love with}} over 10 years later", including crop tops, cargo pants and bodysuits. Also writing for Bustle, Sarah Freymiller penned, [...] "Her commitment to action is notable, even if she never wears a shirt longer than mid-lung, and she fights crime in her cheerleader uniform when she needs to." [...] Freymiller concluded, [...] "In the early 2000s, as Limited Too dominated the tween fashion scene, it was refreshing to see a girl decked out in functional black and army green attire." [...] The character's Kimmunicator ringtone is commonly associated with the series, and is also frequently imitated by fans. The Kimmunicator's inception preceded the creation of smartphones by several years. Upon Apple's release of the Apple Watch, several critics drew similarities between the real-life device and the Kimmunicator, especially when Kim's device was downsized to a wristwatch during the final season.|$|E

500|$|Impressed by {{the success}} of the first season of [...] on Fox, Warner Bros. {{assigned}} Alan Burnett to write a story for a full-length animated film. The original idea for the film was to have Batman being captured by his enemies at Arkham Asylum and be put on a trial by them, as they wanted to show that he was guilty of making them what they had become. The idea's concept, however, was considered [...] "too brainy", as it required Batman to be inmobile during a long time, so the idea was later used in the series' episode [...] "Trial", which was aired after the movie's release. Although the Joker does play a pivotal role in the film, it was Burnett's intention to tell a story far removed from the television show's regular rogues gallery. Burnett also cited he [...] "wanted to do a love story with Bruce because no one had really done it on the TV show. I wanted a story that got into his head." [...] In reality, the creative team had said that they originally didn't want to use the Joker in the film. Conversely, Paul Dini stated that the Joker was always part of the film from the beginning of its production. The writers were highly cautious of placing the Joker in the film as they did not want any connection to Tim Burton's 1989 film Batman, but writer Michael Reaves said, [...] "We then realized that we could make his appearance serve the story in a way <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>never</b> could in live-action." [...] In order to keep the Joker as a solo threat, Bruce Timm and Burnett convinced frequent Animated Series writer Paul Dini to not use Harley Quinn in the film for that reason. The same technique was previously [...] used in the episodes [...] "Joker's Wild" [...] and [...] "The Strange Secret of Bruce Wayne".|$|E
