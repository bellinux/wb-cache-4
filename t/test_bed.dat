5|$|Vulcan B.1 XA902 was {{withdrawn}} from RAF service after a landing accident in 1958. After rebuilding, it replaced VX770 as the Conway <b>test</b> <b>bed,</b> fitted with four RCo.11s.

5|$|Besides the Tu-142's {{military}} applications, a one-off Tu-142MP {{was used}} to test a new ASW suite. Another Tu-142 was converted to replace the Tu-95LL for the testing of turbojet engines. Designated Tu-142LL, the ASW equipment and armament were removed to allow an engine <b>test</b> <b>bed</b> to be carried under the belly. Some of the engines installed were the NK-25 for the Tu-22MZ, RD36-51A for the Tu-144D, and the NK-32 for the Tu-160.

5|$|In January 2015, Florida State University's Center for Advanced Power Systems has {{unveiled}} a new 24,000-volt direct current power test system, {{the most powerful}} of its kind available at a university research center throughout the world.

It has a 24,000-volt direct current with a capacity of 5 megawatts, making it the most powerful PHIL system of its kind at a university research center worldwide. To create the new system, the center put together four individual 6 kilovolt, 1.25 megawatt converters that can be arranged in any combination, in series or parallel connection, to form an extremely flexible <b>test</b> <b>bed</b> for medium voltage direct current (MVDC) system investigations.|$|E

The new brigade was assigned to the III Corps as a corps asset. 1st Squadron, 6th Cavalry Regiment, was transferred to the new brigade on 21 February 1975. The brigade served as a <b>test</b> <b>bed</b> for new concepts involving the employment of attack helicopters on the modern battlefield. In 1985-85, the brigade consisted of 1st Squadron, 6th Cavalry; 4th Squadron, 9th Cavalry Regiment (4-9 CAV); and 5th and 7th Squadrons, 17th Cavalry Regiment (5-17 CAV and 7-17 CAV), all flying attack helicopters.|$|E
5|$|Bruce McLaren Motor Racing {{was founded}} in 1963; Bruce McLaren was a factory driver for the Cooper motor racing team which competed in Formula One, {{the highest level of}} {{international}} single-seater competition. For two years the McLaren team had raced in the Tasman Series, a competition for single-seaters that ran during the Formula One world championship off-season, and in various sports car races. Bruce McLaren continued to race in Grands Prix (i.e. Formula One championship races) for Cooper, but by 1965 the team's performances were worsening and so he decided to build his own Formula One car to race the following year. Despite being a skilled engineer himself, McLaren enlisted Robin Herd to design the car. Herd was an aerospace engineer who had previously worked at the National Gas Turbine Establishment (NGTE) where he had been involved with the Concorde project. In September 1965 the M2A development car was completed. Powered by a 4.5 litre Oldsmobile V8 engine, it was used to test Herd's design ideas and Firestone's tyres. With McLaren still employed by Cooper, the McLaren team initially denied that they were building a Formula One competitor, claiming that the M2A was purely a tyre <b>test</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{test flights}} of the Su-27Ms, {{which began in}} 1988, {{engineers}} discovered that pilots failed to maintain active control of the aircraft at high angles of attack due to the ineffectiveness of flight control surfaces at low speeds. The decision was therefore made to install thrust-vectoring engines to the eleventh Su-27 (factory code T10M-11), which had been built by the Komsomolsk-on-Amur Aircraft Production Association in the country's Far East and was {{being used as a}} radar <b>test</b> <b>bed.</b> Following the airframe's completion in early 1995, the aircraft was delivered to the design bureau's experimental plant near Moscow, where engineers started installing the nozzles to the aircraft. Although Sukhoi had intended the Lyulka-Saturn AL-37FU to power the aircraft, the engine had not yet been flight cleared. Therefore the aircraft was temporarily fitted with the less-powerful AL-31FP engine, which was essentially an AL-31F engine that had the AL-100 vectoring nozzles of the AL-37FU. The aircraft was rolled out in May. Two months later, the temporary engines were replaced with AL-37FUs; its nozzles could only deflect 15 degrees up or down in the pitch axis, and can deflect together or differentially.|$|E
