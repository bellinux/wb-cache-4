40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of experimental work on both mechanical properties and durability of concrete or mortar incorporating silica fume. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> silica fume on the performance of hardened concrete or mortar. <b>The</b> <b>replacement</b> levels <b>of</b> silica fume that replaced cement in this work were 0 %, 5 %, 10 % and 15 %, respectively. The results of this study indicate that both mechanical properties and durability of concrete are greatly dependent on <b>the</b> <b>replacement</b> levels <b>of</b> silica fume. As <b>the</b> <b>replacement</b> level <b>of</b> silica fume increased, the mechanical properties including compressive and flexural strengths, and static modulus of elasticity were proportionally enhanced. Furthermore, it was found that silica fume had some beneficial effects on the resistances to both chloride ions penetration and sodium sulfate attack. However, it exhibited poo...|$|R

5|$|Whilst {{working on}} the Midland Railway's main line, Barlow {{established}} that <b>the</b> <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> sleepers was a larger {{part of the cost}} of track maintenance than <b>the</b> <b>replacement</b> <b>of</b> rails because the sleepers decayed more quickly than the rails wore-out and needed renewal more often. To remove the cost of providing and replacing sleepers, he developed and patented his own rail design in 1849. It had a wide flanged profile which could be laid directly on to track ballast without the need for sleepers, with just periodic tie-bars to maintain the correct gauge. Known as the Barlow rail, it was widely used, especially by the Great Western Railway.|$|E
