25|$|In 2003 the {{municipality}} of Tripoli signed {{the first and}} so far only management contract for water supply in Lebanon. This was done {{after four years of}} preparation that required passing a new law (Law 401) to allow public-private partnerships in water supply. The contract was awarded to the French company Ondéo‐Liban, a subsidiary of Suez Environnement, after a competitive bidding process. The cost of 20 million Euro was financed by the French Development Agency. The contract included the operation, maintenance, and installation of equipment, the organization of the billing system and collection of water tariffs, the management of human and financial resources, and the supervision of the construction of a tertiary water supply network and the expansion of a water treatment plant. The private company increased the billing efficiency from 30% to 60%, reduced water rationing, mapped the network, updated the customer inventory, computerized the accounting system and trained staff. Non-revenue water was reduced from 65% to 45% and the 10-year-long water rationing in the areas of Qalamoun, Qobbe and Abi Samra was eliminated, making Tripoli the only city in Lebanon that receives water 24 hours per day. Water quality and the customer service were also improved. However, cost recovery was not achieved despite an increase in tariffs because bill collection efficiency remained low. The company was unable to introduce metering, although 40,000 meters were acquired. The contract faced a number of challenges: According {{to a study by the}} French Institute for Public-Private Partnerships, <b>the</b> <b>supervisory</b> <b>committee</b> was composed of former employees of the public water company who were not convinced of the usefulness of private sector participation. Despite its achievements, the management contract ended in 2007 without being extended.|$|E

The broadside had this brief introduction: “The following song was written by Captain Lindley Miller, of the First Arkansas Colored Regiment. Captain Miller says the ‘boys’ sing the song on dress parade with an effect which can hardly be described, and he adds that ‘while it is not very conservative, it will do to fight with.’ Captain Miller is a son of the late ex-Senator Miller, of New Jersey.” [...] The song was also included in a collection of Union Army songs published in New York in 1864.|$|E

The measures proposed and the mandates given to the Commission and <b>the</b> <b>supervisory</b> <b>committees</b> constitute little more than short-term plumbing, lacking any long-term vision and a coherent institutional framework. The clearest example of this short-sightedness is the move to allow <b>supervisory</b> <b>committees</b> to take decisions by majority vote. Although this move is to be welcomed, it lacks any legal basis, as it concerns committees that are empowered to act merely in an advisory capacity, and whose advice can thus be ignored by member states, as some have already implied is their intention...|$|R
