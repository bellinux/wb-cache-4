5|$|Darwin <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> {{his diary}} {{published}} {{mixed in with}} FitzRoy's account, but his relatives including Emma and Hensleigh Wedgwood urged that it be published separately. On 30 December the question was settled by FitzRoy taking the advice of William Broderip that Darwin's journal should form the third volume of the Narrative. Darwin set to work reorganising and trimming his diary, and incorporating scientific material from his notes. He completed his Journal and Remarks (now commonly known as The Voyage of the Beagle) in August 1837, but FitzRoy was slower and the three volumes were published in August 1839.|$|E
25|$|In practice, however, no dispute from Tokelau {{has ever}} been litigated outside Tokelau. There has been a strong {{community}} feeling that disputes are matters for {{the community and the}} community alone. This has meant that, to date, community thinking has been opposed to any <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> a case decided in another village, let alone outside Tokelau.|$|E
25|$|Throughout Hasidic history, {{there have}} also been {{numerous}} cases of Rebbes that have been identified by their Hasidim as worthy of being the Messiah. These figures were not <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> been the actual Messiah, since the criteria that must be fulfilled by the Messiah have been clearly stipulated by Maimonodes. Followers hoped that it would be their leader who would be the Messiah and occasionally spoke of him as the Messiah.|$|E

The restriction cooperated and angled votes in favor of each other to reinforce their energy. Furthermore, PKR has exited from the shadow of Anwar while Anwar demonstrated his charm that effectively transformed the gathering into an ordinary political gathering and another constrain. Malaysia would have another face after the political tidal wave. The energy of BN coalition has declined {{and it needs to}} depend on Sabah, Sarawak and Southern Malaysia to keep up its decision control. There will be real authority changes in UMNO, MCA, MIC and Gerakan. What's more, the belief systems of BN coalition's segment parties must be balanced. Relinquishing racial segment would be an exit plan. With respect to the resistance, they won't not have the capacity to deal with to sudden triumph in the decisions, particularly for DAP and Keadilan who won control of states and extended their impacts in the Parliament ought to.|$|E

500|$|Cobain has said, [...] "The entire song {{is made up}} of {{contradictory}} ideas [...] It's {{just making}} fun of the <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> a revolution. But it's a nice thought." [...] Drummer Dave Grohl has stated he does not believe the song has any message, and said, [...] "Just seeing Kurt write the lyrics to a song five minutes before he first sings them, you just kind of find it a little bit hard to believe that the song has {{a lot to say about}} something. You need syllables to fill up this space or you need something that rhymes." ...|$|E

500|$|Hańska and Balzac were determined, however, and in 1845 {{she visited}} him in Paris with Anna and Jerzy. In April of the {{following}} year they visited Italy; Balzac joined them for a tour of Rome, and they proceeded to Geneva. Soon after he returned to Paris, she wrote {{with the news that}} she was pregnant. Balzac was overjoyed, certain that they would have a boy, and insisting on the name Victor-Honoré. The <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> a son, he wrote, [...] "stirs my heart and makes me write page upon page". To avoid scandal, he would have to marry Hańska in secret, {{to hide the fact that}} their child was conceived out of wedlock. In the meantime, Anna married Jerzy Mniszech on 13 October in Wiesbaden. Balzac served as a witness and wrote an announcement for the Paris newspapers, which offended Hańska's sister Alina.|$|E
500|$|Knowles {{commented on}} the song, [...] "It's energetic, {{aggressive}} and filled with hard beats". She explained that the album was completed in three weeks, which is the reason most of the record, including [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] sounds aggressive. She further clarified {{that she did not}} intend to write an angry song, [...] "Swizz's [...] had that tough vibe, like the guy had cheated, and I wanted to write something honest. If you're in a relationship, even if the man's cheating and you end up not wanting him, the thought of another woman benefiting from the lessons you taught him." [...] "Ring the Alarm" [...] features Knowles as the female protagonist impersonating a threatened woman involved in a love triangle. She is unwilling to allow another woman to profit from all the efforts she put on to make her lover a better man. Frances Romero of Time magazine noted that Knowles' anger is due to her man's wandering eye, her desire to leave, and the <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> to give him up to some unworthy woman.|$|E
500|$|Montagu {{considered}} {{that there would}} be a possible [...] "Roman Catholic prejudice against tampering with corpses", which could miss the documents stored in the corpse's pockets, so they added them to an official briefcase that would not be overlooked. To justify carrying documents in a briefcase, Major Martin was given two proof copies of the official pamphlet on combined operations written by the author Hilary Saunders – then on Mountbatten's staff – and a letter from Mountbatten to Eisenhower, asking him to write a brief foreword for the pamphlet's US edition. The planning team first <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> the handle clutched in the corpse's hand, held in place by rigor mortis, but the rigor would probably wear off and the briefcase would drift away. They therefore equipped Martin with a leather-covered chain, such as was used by bank and jewellery couriers to secure their cases against snatching. The chain unobtrusively runs down a sleeve to the case. To Montagu it seemed unlikely that the major would keep the bag secured to his wrist during the long flight from Britain, so the chain was looped around the belt of his trench coat.|$|E

It was just as {{they arrived at the}} golden cave that this difficulty presented itself to their minds.|$|R
500|$|He commented later: [...] "I took an {{appointment}} to the bench, as did a number of liberal judges, {{and we had to}} uphold the law of the country. It was a moral dilemma to do that, but the approach was that it was better to fight from inside than not at all. The moral dilemma came up when I had to apply the law." [...] He noted in 1992 that most South African judges [...] "applied such [...] laws without commenting upon their moral turpitude." [...] A number, including Goldstone, were more outspoken – a policy that he felt aided the credibility of the courts. There was a fine dividing line between applying moral standards and promoting political doctrines, but Goldstone believed that [...] "in my view, if a judge is to err, it should be on the side of defending morality." [...] He took the view that [...] "judges have a duty to act morally, and if they're dealing with laws which have an unjust effect, I think it's their duty – if they can, within the powers they've got legitimately – to interpret the laws and give judgments which will make them less harsh and less unjust." [...] Being a judge in apartheid-era South Africa was a challenge, but it had its rewards; [...] "I hated in the morning the <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> to do this for another day, [...] {{by the end of the}} day, I was exhilarated at the reaction and how important the work was." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{completion}} of the turnpike in April–May 1858, the Cape May Turnpike did not receive much profits. Even with tolls being collected and stock being bought, these could not offset the costs of repairs and maintenance. The roadbed was commonly washed away in storms and it was becoming a less used route as the [...] "Shunpike" [...] (now NJ 162/County Route 626) nearby was free to use, taking away traffic from the turnpike. Walters Miller, a big investor of the turnpike company, {{decided to leave the}} syndicate in favor of working towards railroads. Miller himself looked into the construction of railroads in the area, hiring William Cook, who engineered the Camden and Amboy Railroad into producing routes along the peninsula. Cook proposed three routes in 1852, one from the Camden waterfront to Cape May economic region, one through Millville and Bridgeton and a third through Salem. Although the rights for a railroad in the area by the New Jersey General Assembly had been allowed since 1832, there has been no progress on any railroad in Cape May County until 1863. That year, progress started on constructing the Camden and Atlantic Railroad using the first proposal by Cook in 1852. Jonathan Pitney of Absecon spent two years trying to obtain the charter from the General Assembly. In a letter to Richard Holmes, Pitney said the chances of getting the railroad charter and building it were [...] "good". Holmes, however, was cautious towards the railroad company investment, showing little <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> a railroad created that would compete with his struggling turnpike syndicate.|$|E
500|$|The Duke's {{influence}} at Court was {{ended by}} the death of George IV in June 1830 and the succession of the Duke of Clarence as William IV. Wellington wrote that [...] "The effect of the King's death will... be {{to put an end to}} the Duke of Cumberland's political character and power in this country entirely". King William lacked legitimate children (two girls having died in infancy) and Ernest was now heir-presumptive in Hanover, since the British heir-presumptive, Victoria, as a female could not inherit there. William realised that so long as the Duke maintained a power base at Windsor, he could wield unwanted influence. The Duke was Gold Stick as head of the Household Cavalry; William made the Duke's post responsible to the Commander in Chief rather than to the King, and an insulted Ernest, outraged at the <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> to report to an officer less senior than himself, resigned. King William again emerged triumphant when the new queen, Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen, wished to quarter her horses in the stables customarily used by the consort, but which were then occupied by Ernest's horses. Ernest initially refused the King's order to remove the horses, but gave in when told that William's grooms would remove them if Ernest did not move them voluntarily. However, Ernest and William remained friendly throughout the latter's seven-year reign. Ernest's house at Kew was too small for his family; the King gave the Duke and Duchess lifetime residence in a nearby, larger house by the entrance to Kew Gardens. Ernest opposed the Reform Act 1832, and was one of the [...] "diehard" [...] peers who voted against the bill on its final reading when most Tories abstained under threat of seeing the House of Lords flooded with Whig peers.|$|E

2500|$|George Burns {{himself said}} as much in an {{interview}} years later, adding that, surprisingly enough, no one ever <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> Allen say [...] "Good night, Gracie". [...] However, the former Burns and Allen head writer, Paul Henning, did use the [...] "say good night" [...] bit {{in at least one}} [...] episode of the Beverly Hillbillies ("The Richest Woman", aired January 5, 1966, two years before Laugh-In premiered.

2500|$|Blanche on the Lam {{opens in}} a court room with Blanche being accused of writing bad checks and being sentenced to thirty days in jail to teach her a lesson.

[...] She gave up better pay for the safety of her {{children}} and ended being unable to cover the checks she wrote, being accused of writing more bad checks than she had, and being sentenced to time in jail because of it.|$|E
2500|$|The quest group faces several challenges, {{including}} {{being caught}} in a whirlpool, encountering an island of carnivorous insects, and being betrayed by two shiners (fireflies) who were hired {{to provide them with}} light. Gregor himself begins to struggle with a new [...] "power" [...] that manifests when he is in battle. He is what the Underland creatures call a [...] "rager", a person who is overcome by a kind of [...] "battle-fury" [...] when they fight, making them completely deadly even without training. Gregor and his bond Ares's worst trouble, however, is when they and the remaining questers become separated from Luxa, Temp, and Boots during a fight with some serpents. The three missing are assumed dead, and Gregor finds himself emotionally frozen at the <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> lost his baby sister.|$|E

2500|$|Araki {{said he had}} a lot {{of readers}} asking him to bring older {{characters}} back. Although he is not a fan of bringing them back simply for nostalgia, he did not hesitate having Joseph return to save his daughter because it is completely true to the character. The author <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> Joseph drop out partway through due to his age, but ended up [...] "playing it by ear" [...] as serialization continued. He gave him the role of [...] "navigator", introducing the readers to the Joestar family, Dio, Hamon and Stands, and his own Stand being a support ability rather than offensive. Stands being a succession of the Hamon and Hamon being life energy that spreads across the body through breathing, Araki thought Joseph's Hermit Purple vines wrapping around his body were a visual representation of that.|$|E
2500|$|The {{day after}} Hunt's suicide, Pearson {{published}} his charges about how Republican Senators had threatened Hunt, but described Hunt's motives as complex: [...] "Two weeks ago {{he went to}} the hospital for a physical check and announced that he would not run again. It was no secret that he had been having kidney trouble for some time, but I am sure that on top of this, Lester Hunt, a much more sensitive soul than his colleagues realized, just could not bear the <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>having</b> his son's misfortunes become the subject of whispers in his re-election campaign." [...] In private, he confirmed that Hunt had no serious health problem and wrote in his diary that [...] "Unfortunately I am afraid that the morals charge against his son and the experience Hunt suffered was the main factor." ...|$|E
