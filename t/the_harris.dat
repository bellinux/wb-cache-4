Harris Theater for Music and Dance (also {{known as}} <b>the</b> <b>Harris</b> Theater for Music and Dance, <b>the</b> <b>Harris</b> & Harris Theater or, most commonly, <b>the</b> <b>Harris</b> Theater) is a 1,525-seat theater for the {{performing}} arts located along the northern edge of Millennium Park on Randolph Street in the Loop community area of Chicago in Cook County, Illinois, US. The theater, which is largely underground due to Grant Park-related height restrictions, was named for its primary benefactors, Joan and Irving Harris. It serves as the park's indoor performing venue, a complement to Jay Pritzker Pavilion, which hosts the park's outdoor performances.|$|E
5|$|Unlike most sports, college football's {{governing}} body, the NCAA, {{does not}} bestow a National Championship title.

Two additional polls are released midway through the season; <b>the</b> <b>Harris</b> Interactive Poll is released after the fourth week of the season and the Bowl Championship Series (BCS) Standings is released after the seventh week. <b>The</b> <b>Harris</b> Poll and Coaches Poll are factors in the BCS Standings.|$|E

5|$|In 1832 {{the island}} was leased to Colonel Tynte of Halswell House, who {{established}} an inn for sailors. The inn was run by <b>the</b> <b>Harris</b> family, using rum and tobacco bought from ships. They claimed that {{the island was}} outside {{the jurisdiction of the}} excise men until a court case in 1884. After <b>the</b> <b>Harris</b> family, the inn was run by Mr W.L. Davies, who offered fishing, shooting and boating holidays. To make landing on the island easier, a new pier was built close to the inn. In 1835 clergyman John Ashley from Clevedon voluntarily ministered to the population of the island and the neighbouring Flat Holm. Ashley created the Bristol Channel Mission in order to serve seafarers on the 400 sailing vessels which used the Bristol Channel. The mission would later become the Mission to Seafarers, which still provides ministerial services to sailors in over 300 ports.|$|E

Maija, devastated, decides God's will cannot be for Antti to spend his life behind bars, and she persuades him to go on the lam.|$|R

5|$|Baird's first {{press conference}} as a cabinet {{minister}} {{was held in}} July 1999, and was intended to highlight <b>the</b> <b>Harris</b> government's record in reducing the provincial welfare rolls. Baird told reporters that 15,000 people had left the system since the introduction of workfare, and used this figure {{to argue that the}} government's policy was a success. At the time, he lacked information on the number of workfare recipients who actually found jobs, and he also did not account for 40% of the welfare recipients who had been cut from the list. A number of media reports subsequently criticized both the principle and the implementation of workfare in Ontario.|$|E
5|$|In February 1835, Ohio passed {{legislation}} {{that set up}} county governments in the Strip. The county in which Toledo sat would, later in 1835, be named after incumbent Governor Robert Lucas, a move that further exacerbated the growing tensions with Michigan. Also, during this period, Ohio attempted to use its power in Congress to revive a previously rejected boundary bill that would formally set the state border to be <b>the</b> <b>Harris</b> Line.|$|E

However, after the loss to Virginia Tech, the Terps fell out of the rankings altogether. Maryland made one final poll appearance after the win over North Carolina, before losing to Florida State.|$|E

5|$|In {{the centre}} of the quad is <b>the</b> <b>Harris</b> Building, {{formerly}} Oriel court, a real tennis court where Charles I played tennis with his nephew Prince Rupert in December 1642 and King Edward VII had his first tennis lesson in 1859. The building was in use as a lecture hall by 1923, and after modernisation between 1991 and 1994, funded by Sir Philip and Lady Harris, contains accommodation, a seminar room and the college's main lecture theatre. The bronze plaque in the lobby commemorates Sir Philip's father, Captain Charles William Harris, after whom the building is named. The building was opened by John Major, then Prime Minister, on 10 August 1993.|$|E
5|$|In {{the fall}} of the 2006–07 season, <b>the</b> <b>Harris</b> Theater hosted the New York City Ballet for five days of {{performances}} that marked the company's first visit to Chicago in over 25years. This presentation grossed $2.3million and enticed 600 new donors to support the theater, which netted $800,000 for operations and rental subsidies for its resident troupes. This contributed to the theater's first year of profitability in fiscal year 2007; it had net income of $1.3million on revenues of $8.2million. In , Mikhail Baryshnikov made his first visit to Chicago as a performer in seven years, with two shows at the theater.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1986, the Huntington Development Corporation {{suggested}} that an off-track betting facility be constructed, however, the idea died after Governor Arch Moore vetoed an off-track betting bill that was critical to the project's success. In 1987, the Webb Companies presented {{a plan for a}} $110 million mixed-use complex called RiverCenter that would feature a 20-story office tower, an underground parking garage and a skyway to <b>the</b> <b>Harris</b> Riverfront Park. The project failed when two large tenants could not be found to anchor the project. In 1988, the city's grant to help develop the project was revoked.|$|E

Word of Antti's escape has reached the sheriff, who returns to <b>the</b> <b>Harri</b> farm to interrogate the Ostrobothnians and sniff out the fugitive's confederates; accompanying the sheriff is a scribe, a lay judge, and a bailiff. Kaappo {{is the first to}} be brought before the sheriff; intimidated and confused, the farmhand provides false testimony that he last saw Antti with Jussi. Kaisa, a motherly tenant of <b>the</b> <b>Harri</b> farm, provides far more resistance when she is questioned; her strategy of circumlocution enrages the sheriff and he orders her out. After Kaisa departs, the sheriff orders the scribe to retrieve Jussi; he draws his whip from the side of his boot, clearly itching for a fight.|$|R
5|$|Millennium Park {{is part of}} {{the larger}} Grant Park. The pavilion, which has a {{capacity}} of 11,000, is Grant Park's small event outdoor performing arts venue, and complements Petrillo Music Shell, the park's older and larger bandshell. Pritzker Pavilion is built partially atop <b>the</b> <b>Harris</b> Theater for Music and Dance, the park's indoor performing arts venue, with which it shares a loading dock and backstage facilities. Initially the pavilion's lawn seats were free for all concerts, but this changed when Tori Amos performed the first rock concert there on August 31, 2005.|$|E
5|$|On April 3, 1835, Jackson {{sent two}} representatives from Washington, D.C., Richard Rush of Pennsylvania and Benjamin Chew Howard of Maryland, to Toledo to {{arbitrate}} {{the conflict and}} present a compromise to both governments.

5|$|Stanley {{decided in}} 1901 {{to build and}} set up Stanley Technical Trades School, {{the first of its}} kind in the country. The school was {{designed}} to educate boys between the ages of 12 and 15 in general studies, as well as trade. It was made to Stanley’s own design and included an astronomy tower, and opened in 1907. When it was presented to the public in 1907, it had an endowment valued at £50,000. It was later renamed as Stanley Technical School (now Harris Academy South Norwood). The William F. Stanley Trust (originally The Stanley Foundation) was set up as a charitable Trust to assist with the management of the Stanley Technical Trades School. On 23 November 2006, Lady Harris (wife of Philip Harris, Baron Harris of Peckham, founder of <b>the</b> <b>Harris</b> Federation) and David Cameron (at the time, the leader of the Conservative Party and the Leader of the Opposition) placed a time capsule to recognise the contribution of Stanley to South Norwood. The capsule included a letter from Cameron, a copy of the speech given by William Stanley, on the opening of the Stanley Technical Trades School on 26 March 1907, two reference books (William Stanley the Man; William Stanley’s School), as well as artefacts from both Stanley Technical High School for Boys and <b>the</b> <b>Harris</b> Federation of schools.|$|E
