50|$|Although the {{language}} of the statute refers only <b>to</b> prior <b>orders</b> of removal, section 309(d)(2) of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 clarifies that any reference in law <b>to</b> an <b>order</b> of removal should be interpreted <b>to</b> include <b>orders</b> of exclusion and deportation. Thus, reinstatement of removal applies <b>to</b> <b>orders</b> of removal, deportation, and exclusion.|$|R

5|$|A Book of the Dead papyrus was {{produced}} <b>to</b> <b>order</b> by scribes. They were commissioned {{by people in}} preparation for their own funeral, or by the relatives of someone recently deceased. They were expensive items; one source gives {{the price of a}} Book of the Dead scroll as one deben of silver, perhaps half the annual pay of a labourer. Papyrus itself was evidently costly, as there are many instances of its re-use in everyday documents, creating palimpsests. In one case, a Book of the Dead was written on second-hand papyrus.|$|E
5|$|A typical {{session of}} the Senate begins with a call <b>to</b> <b>order</b> by the President of the Senate. After the call <b>to</b> <b>order,</b> the {{previous}} day's journal is approved, petitions are heard, and orders involving committee and leadership appointments or changes to the rules are presented. First, readings of legislation take place. Senators are then given leeway to introduce any visitors, often people observing its deliberations from the gallery above the Senate chamber. Then the Senators consider legislation. They begin with unfinished business from the previous session, then consider legislation and special orders with accompanying reports from committees. At {{the discretion of the}} presiding officer, the Senate may adjourn at any time, unless a majority of members present object to adjournment.|$|E
5|$|After {{considering}} the Royal Commission's recommendations the Dutch Government decided to purchase four battleships. All the ships {{were to be}} permanently stationed in the NEI, and none would be used in European waters. The ships were larger than those proposed by the commission, however. Idenburg opposed this decision, and unsuccessfully argued {{for at least a}} fifth battleship to be built. In October 1913 it was rumored that the Government was about <b>to</b> <b>order</b> the first ship, {{and that it would be}} paid for by a loan borne by NEI.|$|E

5|$|Although {{little is}} known about the life and career of Nerva before his {{accession}} as Emperor in 96, he appears to have been a highly adaptable diplomat, surviving multiple regime changes and emerging as one of the Flavians' most trusted advisors.

5|$|As Zimri-Lim advanced, {{a leader}} of the Banu-Simaal (Zimri-Lim's tribe) overthrew Yasmah-Adad, opening the road for Zimri-Lim who arrived a few months after Yasmah-Adad's escape, and married princess Shibtu the {{daughter}} of Yarim-Lim I a short time after his enthronement in c. 1776 BC. Zimri-Lim's ascension to the throne with the help of Yarim-Lim I affected Mari's status, Zimri-Lim referred to Yarim-Lim as his father, and the Yamhadite king was able <b>to</b> <b>order</b> Mari as the mediator between Yamhad's main deity Hadad and Zimri-Lim, who declared himself a servant of Hadad.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1948, the Soviet secret service took an {{interest}} in this area of medicine. One of those with overall responsibility for the Soviet secret police, pre-war Procurator General and State Prosecutor, the deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Andrey Vyshinsky, was the first <b>to</b> <b>order</b> the use of psychiatry as a tool of repression. Russian psychiatrist Pyotr Gannushkin also believed that in a class society, especially during the most severe class struggle, psychiatry was incapable of not being repressive. A system of political abuse of psychiatry was developed at the end of Joseph Stalin's regime.|$|E

5|$|As of April 1996, {{the option}} <b>to</b> <b>order</b> {{the seventh and}} eighth {{submarines}} was still under consideration, but was looked on unfavourably by the Department of Defence at the time, as the additional cost would require the diversion of funding from the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force, resulting in an imbalance in {{the capabilities of the}} Australian Defence Force. The option was cancelled outright by late 2001.|$|E
5|$|As the BBC {{broadcasting}} {{unit was}} about <b>to</b> <b>order</b> another batch of the monitor, {{it was found}} that the supplier had modified the drive units, meaning the LS3/5 design had to be fundamentally revised.

Modifications were made to adapt to the new drive units and deal with the altered resonance pattern, and the LS3/5 became the LS3/5A.|$|E

According <b>to</b> <b>orders,</b> all aircraft had to depart before midnight so that darkness would provide enough cover for their return flight. At around 24:00, Tzoganis' aircraft was ready to depart when the control tower announced the termination of all take offs. Strictly adhering <b>to</b> <b>orders,</b> Tzoganis turned back and shut down his engines. However, two of the following aircraft (Niki-14, piloted by Panayotis Limperopoulos and Niki-15, piloted by Evangelos Petroulakis) insisted on departing and took off at 00:20 and 00.23.|$|R

5|$|Criticism of the game's {{handling}} of ground combat upon its initial release prompted Paragon {{to issue an}} updated version 3.0 {{of the game in}} late 1990 which featured an enhanced combat system.

This update was made available without charge to everyone who had purchased an earlier version of the game.|$|E
