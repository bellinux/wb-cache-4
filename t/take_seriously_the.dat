25|$|During {{the first}} half of the Victorian era, there was a more or less {{negative}} view of women's styles of the 1795–1820 period. Some people would have felt slightly uncomfortable to be reminded that their mothers or grandmothers had once promenaded about in such styles (which could be considered indecent according to Victorian norms), and many would have found it somewhat difficult to really empathize with (or <b>take</b> <b>seriously)</b> <b>the</b> struggles of a heroine of art or literature if they were being constantly reminded that she was wearing such clothes. For such reasons, some Victorian history paintings of the Napoleonic wars intentionally avoided depicting accurate women's styles (see example below), Thackeray's illustrations to his book Vanity Fair depicted the women of the 1810s wearing 1840s fashions, and in Charlotte Brontë's 1849 novel Shirley (set in 1811–1812) neo-Grecian fashions are anachronistically relocated to an earlier generation.|$|E
25|$|With {{the capture}} of Bergen op Zoom, the French now had control of {{the entire length of}} the river Scheldt. The defeat caused a rift between the Dutch and British governments. It now dawned on the British that they had demanded too much of the {{military}} capability of the Dutch Republic and that its ability to resist the French had been exhausted. The Dutch on the other hand were furious about the fact that her allies were unwilling to relieve the city. The city was key to opening up the Dutch Republic and Hanover to a potential French invasion. Lowendal was made a Marshal of France for his exploit and the French now controlled the length of the Scheldt river. Along with the defeat at Lauffeld, the defeat at Bergen op Zoom forced the British to re-enter negotiations, and to <b>take</b> <b>seriously</b> <b>the</b> ongoing talks at the Congress of Breda, leading to a treaty in 1748.|$|E
25|$|At first, Generals Thomas and Sherman did not <b>take</b> <b>seriously</b> <b>the</b> {{prospect}} that Hood would actually invade Tennessee, with a Federal army about to burn {{its way through}} Georgia. However, as {{it became clear that}} this was Hood's destination, Thomas began to take action. Ordering Major General John M. Schofield to move to Columbia on the Duck River (about halfway between the Alabama line and Nashville), Thomas hoped to intercept Hood before he could seize this important crossing. Hood split his army into three columns for the march, with the 33rd and the rest of Cheatham's Corps in the westernmost one; they marched seventy miles through freezing rain, sleet and bitterly cold winds toward Mt. Pleasant, where the three columns reunited and continued in the direction of Columbia. Effectively screened by Forrest's cavalry, the Confederates reached Columbia just after the Federals had arrived and started to entrench. Bold maneuvers on the part of General Forrest, combined with artillery fire and effective demonstrations by the rest of Hood's army allowed them to cross the Duck River east of town, moving north toward Spring Hillfor once, the Army of Tennessee had been able to use the same basic tactic Sherman had used so well against them in Georgia. Amazingly, neither side reported any casualties in this battle, which had consisted almost entirely of feints and shelling.|$|E

500|$|At first highly acclaimed—it made an {{immediate}} and powerful impact on the poet John Keats, among others—then brutally criticised, Hazlitt's book {{lost much of its}} influence in the author's lifetime, only to re-enter the mainstream of Shakespearean criticism in the late nineteenth century. The first edition sold out quickly; sales of the second, in mid-1818, were at first brisk, but they ceased entirely in the wake of harshly antagonistic, personally directed, politically motivated reviews in the Tory literary magazines of the day. Although some interest continued to be shown in Hazlitt's work as an essayist, {{it was not until the}} end of the nineteenth century, long after Hazlitt's death, that significant interest was again shown in his interpretations of Shakespeare. In the twentieth century, the influential critic A.C. Bradley and a few others began to <b>take</b> <b>seriously</b> <b>the</b> book's interpretations of many of Shakespeare's characters. But then Hazlitt along with Bradley was censured for displaying faults of the [...] "character" [...] school of Shakespearean criticism, primarily that of discussing dramatic characters as though they were real people, and again Hazlitt's contributions to Shakespearean criticism were deprecated.|$|E
500|$|Noel Gallagher {{summed up}} his own {{perspective}} on the album's aesthetic {{in an interview with}} Rolling Stone in 1995; [...] "Whilst [...] is about dreaming of being a pop star in a band, What's the Story is about actually being a pop star in a band." [...] The album has a notable anthemic theme to its songs, differing from the rawness and edged rock of Definitely Maybe. The use of string arrangements and more varied instrumentation in songs such as [...] "Don't Look Back in Anger" [...] and [...] "Champagne Supernova" [...] was a significant departure from the band's debut. This style had first been implemented by the band on their fifth single, [...] "Whatever", released in December 1994. It was produced in conjunction with the London Symphony Orchestra, resulting in a much more pop-oriented and mellower sound; this would be the template that would come to define many of the songs on What's the Story. In the BBC documentary Seven Ages of Rock, former NME chief editor Steve Sutherland noted that [...] "with Morning Glory, [...] began to <b>take</b> <b>seriously</b> <b>the</b> notion of being the voice of a generation".|$|E

2500|$|In a French {{television}} {{debate in}} 2003 with Nicolas Sarkozy, Sarkozy accused Ramadan of defending the stoning of adulterers, a punishment supposedly warranted by {{a section of}} the Islamic penal code known as hudud. Ramadan replied that Sarkozy was wrong. He said that he opposed corporal punishments, stoning and the death penalty and that he is in favor of a moratorium on these practices to open the debate among Islamic scholars in Muslim-majority countries that enforce them. Many people, including Sarkozy, were outraged. Ramadan later defended his position arguing that, because it involved religious texts that Muslims <b>take</b> <b>seriously,</b> <b>the</b> law would have to be properly understood and contextualized. Ramadan argued that in Muslim countries, the simple act to [...] "condemn" [...] won't change anything, but with a moratorium, it could open the way for further debate. He thinks that such a debate can only lead to an abolition of these rules.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the wake}} of the Tiananmen {{massacre}} of 1989 and with the intensification of market reforms, literature and culture turned increasingly commercial and escapist. Wang Shuo (王朔), the so-called [...] "hooligan" [...] (痞子) writer, is the most obvious manifestation of this commercial shift, though his fiction is not without serious intent. Some writers, such as Yan Lianke 阎连科, continue to <b>take</b> <b>seriously</b> <b>the</b> role of literature in exposing social problems; his novel Dreams of Ding Village (丁庄梦) deals with the plight of HIV-AIDS victims. As in the May Fourth Movement, women writers came to the fore. Many of them, such as Chen Ran (陈然), Wei Hui (卫慧), Wang Anyi (王安忆), and Hong Ying (虹影), explore female subjectivity in a radically changing society.

2500|$|The {{objection}} that [...] "utilitarianism {{does not}} <b>take</b> <b>seriously</b> <b>the</b> distinction between persons" [...] came to prominence in 1971 {{with the publication}} of John Rawls' A Theory of Justice. The concept is also important in animal rights advocate Richard Ryder's rejection of utilitarianism, in which he talks of the [...] "boundary of the individual", through which neither pain nor pleasure may pass. However, a similar objection was noted in 1970 by Thomas Nagel (who claimed that consequentialism [...] "treats the desires, needs, satisfactions, and dissatisfactions of distinct persons {{as if they were the}} desires, etc., of a mass person"), and even earlier by David Gauthier, who wrote that utilitarianism supposes [...] "that mankind is a super-person, whose greatest satisfaction is the objective of moral action[...] [...] [...] But this is absurd. Individuals have wants, not mankind; individuals seek satisfaction, not mankind. A person's satisfaction is not part of any greater satisfaction." [...] Thus, the aggregation of utility becomes futile as both pain and happiness are intrinsic to and inseparable from the consciousness in which they are felt, rendering impossible the task of adding up the various pleasures of multiple individuals.|$|E

On her cabinet's advice, Clarkson subsequently dispatched Canadian soldiers to assist in the invasion of Afghanistan, and, in her role of representing the Queen as commander-in-chief of the Canadian Forces, visited in 2002 the Canadian troops serving in the Afghan theatre. This trip, plus similar ones she undertook during her tenure such as those to Kosovo to meet with Canadian troops, to the Persian Gulf to spend Christmas with members of the Armed Forces on a Canadian destroyer, and again to Afghanistan to spend New Year's with Canadian soldiers won her acclaim for being the first governor general since at least 1945 to <b>take</b> <b>seriously</b> <b>the</b> duties associated with the commander-in-chief title, which was credited for helping to boost pride in the Canadian Forces.|$|E
2500|$|Scholars {{consider}} the accounts in Luke and Matthew as explaining the birth in Bethlehem in different ways, giving separate genealogies of Jesus and probably not historical. While Géza Vermes and E. P. Sanders dismiss the accounts as pious fiction, Raymond E. Brown sees them {{as having been}} constructed from historical traditions which predate the Gospels. According to Brown, there is no uniform agreement among scholars on the historicity of the accounts, e.g., most of those scholars who reject the historicity of the birth at Bethlehem argue for a birth at Nazareth, a few suggest Capernaum, and other have hypothesized locations {{as far away as}} Chorazin. Bruce Chilton and archaeologist Aviram Oshri have proposed a birth at Bethlehem of Galilee, a site located seven miles from Nazareth at which remains dating to the time of Herod the Great have been excavated. Armand P.
