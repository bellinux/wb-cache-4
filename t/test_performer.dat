40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of the study is}} as follows: Identify steel compositions/microstructures suitable for construction of new pipeline infrastructure and evaluate the potential use of the existing steel pipeline infrastructure in high pressure gaseous hydrogen applications. The microstructures of four pipeline steels were characterized and tensile testing was conducted in gaseous hydrogen and helium at pressures of 5. 5 MPa (800 psi), 11 MPa (1600 psi) and 20. 7 MPa (3000 psi). Based on reduction of area, two of the four steels that performed the best across the pressure range were selected for evaluation of fracture and fatigue performance in gaseous hydrogen at 5. 5 MPa (800 psi) and 20. 7 MPa (3000 psi). The basic format for this phase of the study is as follows: Microstructural characterization of volume fraction of phases in each alloy; Tensile testing of all four alloys in He and H{sub 2 } at 5. 5 MPa (800 psi), 11 MPa (1600 psi), and 20. 7 MPa (3000 psi).

40|$|Since the {{discovery}} of mirror neurons in premotor and parietal areas of the macaque monkey, the idea that action and perception may share the same neural code has been of central interest in social, developmental, and cognitive neurosciences. A fundamental question concerns how a putative human mirror neuron system may be tuned to the motor experiences of the individual. The current study tested the hypothesis that prior motor experience modulated the sensorimotor mu and beta rhythms. Specifically, we hypothesized that these sensorimotor rhythms would be more desynchronized after active motor experience compared to passive observation experience. To test our hypothesis, we collected EEG from adult participants during the observation of a relatively novel action: an experimenter used a claw-like tool {{to pick up a}} toy. Prior to EEG collection, we trained one group of adults to perform this action with the tool (performers). A second group comprised trained video coders, who only had experience observing the action (observers). Both the performers and the observers had no prior motor and visual experience with the action. A third group of novices was also <b>tested.</b> <b>Performers</b> exhibited the greatest mu rhythm desynchronization in the 8 – 13 Hz band, particularly in the right hemisphere compared to observers and novices.

The recital opens with "Morceau symphonique" by Alexandre Felix Guilmant (1873 - 1911), French organist, composer and editor. With Charles Bordes and Vincent D'indy he founded the Schola Cantorum in 1894 and taught organ there. Two years later he took Widor???s organ class at the Paris conservatory. Guilmant???s position as a recitalist and composer is inseparable from the creation of cavaille-coll organs. The quality and range of these instruments helped Guilmant to popularize organ recitals. He composed numerous pieces, almost all of which are for organ or voices. In 1906 he was commissioned to write a trombone concerto for Graduate recitals at the paris conservatory.

40|$|Purpose: Drawing upon Sternberg's {{theory of}} mental self-government, this paper aims to {{investigate}} the thinking styles and workplace experiences of 152 human resource (HR) practitioners pursuing Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) membership. It seeks to explore whether their thinking styles complemented their jobs and consider the implications for the CIPD's notion of the "thinking performer". Design/methodology/approach: A two-part questionnaire, including the Thinking Styles Inventory-Revised II (Sternberg et al.) is completed by the research participants to identify their Type I (creativity-generating) and Type II (norm-favouring) thinking styles. Six focus group sessions are also conducted to gather insights about the participants' workplace experiences. Findings: On average, participants scored more highly on Type I thinking styles. Although this suggested their thinking styles {{are consistent with the}} "thinking performer" ideal, focus group participants doubted whether the creativity-generating attributes of Type I suited the reality of the HR function, which is described as being awash with rule bound behaviours. Particularly, this is the experience of junior staff, who felt unable to challenge senior management or contribute to the bigger picture. Correlation coefficients revealed that age, length of service with current organization and perceived autonomy at work are the most significant socialisation variables.

40|$|Includes {{recorded}} audio {{files in}} WAV and MP 3 formats, 99 : 40 in lengthThe recital program opens {{with one of}} Beethoven's middle period compositions which he entitled, Das Lebewohl Sonata, opus 81 a. The three descriptive movements, marked Das Lebewohl, Die Abwesenheit, and Das Wiedersehen, refer to the departure, absence, and return o Beethoven's student and friend, Archduke Rudolph of Austria. This is a very personal work describing Beethoven's deep sorrow and loneliness which ultimately finds relief in the joyous outburst of the last movement. Following Das Lebewohl Sonata are the Valses Nobles et Sentimentales by Ravel. This chain of valses contributes to the simpler and more economical style of writing used by some French composers who disliked compositions based strictly on virtuosity. In 1912, Ravel orchestrated the valses, creating the ballet, Adelaide. For the pianist these valses display a wonderful balance between rich chordal sonorities intertwined with simple lines of innermost expression. The {{second half of the}} recital opens with Aaron Copland's Piano Sonata. In ways similar to Beethoven's compositional style, Copland utilizes various short musical motifs to form this large intricate piano composition. The sonata makes considerable use of a three tone motif as did the first movement of Beethoven's Das Lebewohl Sonata. Structurally, this sonata embodies two slow and intensely serious outer movements separated by a scherzo which requires a swift, delicate touch and a sensitive approach to jazz-like rhythms. Concluding the program is Chopin's Ballade in F minor. This fourth Ballade, composed in 1842, shows Chopin's mastery of the art of expressive pianistic writing. Formally, the Ballade combines the variations of two main themes. While this Ballade is very lyrical and relaxed at the start, each variation becomes more technically and emotionally involved.

40|$|Tributyltin (TBT) is a pollutant, mainly {{introduced}} to the environment as a marine anti-fouling agent. The aim of this work was to assess and develop sustainable and cost-effective remediation technologies for TBT-contaminated dredged materials. For this purpose, analytical methods were developed for sediments and sediment leachates. For the sediments, a triple extraction followed by derivatisation and measurement by gas chromatography with pulsed flame photometric detection was employed, avoiding the lengthy concentration step of the organic layer. The TBT detection limit of ca 0. 04 mg Sn/kg in sediment was below the suggested limit of 0. 1 mg/kg for sea disposal of TBT-contaminated dredgings (OSPAR Commission). For the leachates, derivatisation and extraction into hexane was used. Also, a new procedure, {{with the potential for}} automation, was developed for the simultaneous analysis of multiple water samples, based on in situ extraction and derivatisation on C 18 solid phase extraction cartridges. No legislative limits existed for TBT in leachates, therefore the detection limits of ca 6 - 10 ng Sn/L achieved were regarded satisfactory, as they were below or similar to the EQS for coastal and estuarine waters or freshwaters (2 - 20 ng/L TBT). A pilot investigation was carried out on a dockyard to evaluate the use of X-Ray fluorescence as a screening method for the presence of TBT in sediments. Due to tin contamination such a technique was not suitable for the site examined. Incineration was found to remove TBT but it would incur very high costs. Ultrasonic destruction was not effective enough, even on TBT-spiked water solutions. Carbon products, pure clays, organically modified clays, zero valent iron, fly ash and cements were screened for their abilities to prevent TBT leaching, using a leaching <b>test.</b> The best <b>performer</b> was a powdered activated carbon product which, even mixed with cement that increases the leaching of TBT, delivered a TBT-free (< 5 ng Sn/L) leaching test result 33 days after the mixing.

40|$|Purpose: Medical {{students}} should develop scientific skills, of which some are laboratory skills. In many undergraduate medical science courses, laboratory skills assessments {{are based on}} written reports of tried and tested experiments. However, reporting an experiment {{is very different from}} being able to perform the experiment. Assessment drives learning, so observational assessments of student laboratory skills should {{have a positive impact on}} their development. Methods: We report a full year experience with the Objective Laboratory Skills Examination (OLSE), a new method adapted from the Objective Structured Clinical Examination (OSCE). The OLSE is used as a high stakes exam and consists on a series of experimental situations each consisting of a practical task (e. g. identifying which tube in a rack contains a suspension of eukaryotes) that the student completes in standard laboratory setting. The student performance is judged by a trained observer supported by checklists specific for each situation. We also present our experience with the Laboratory Skills Simulation Center, a pedagogical resource where students can practice skills and obtain feedback under close tutorial observational. Students who attend training sessions fill in a questionnaire at start and at the conclusion of the sessions, which requires a self-assessment of confidence on a '' 1 - 10 '' scale''. Results : The OLSE was well accepted by students and faculty, who find that the exam evaluates what it is intended to. Importantly, the analysis of our data shows that not all top performer students in written <b>tests</b> are top <b>performers</b> in OLSE suggesting the exam is targeting different competences. Importantly, student commitment in laboratory classes and skills training effort in class is higher after the introduction of OLSEs. As to the training sessions at the skills center, mean gains in confidence with the session are 1. 50 points with a standard deviation of 1. 20 (range is - 1 to 6). The percentage of students who ''recommend the session to colleagues'' is 99 %. Conclusions : The OLSE has face validity and a very powerful positive educational impact on courses. The Laboratory Skills Simulation Center is a resource that can boost students confidence in the laboratory. The combination of opportunities for formative observations and the need to pass summative assessments is a powerful catalyst for the development of the laboratory skills of medical students. </p...|$|R

This movement, set in the style of a the dance known as the sarabande, is the final movement of this partita, actually a set of five works in dance styles also including an allemande, acourante, a sarabande (different from the chaconne) and a gigue. Written during Bach's tenure at the court of Anhalt-Cothen, the Chaconne is a large set of variations on a four-note ground bass theme. Performed on this recital on the vibraphone, the chaconne is a cornerstone of the violin repertory, and <b>tests</b> the <b>performer</b> on the levels of patience, technique, endurance, musicality. Images, for four timpani, five cymbals, and large tam tam, is the first of two pieces by William Kraft (b. 1923) to be performed on this program and is representative of repertory from the twentieth century. this piece, composed in 1978, is set in four movements, each of which is dedicated to a different master of the timpani; Saul Goodman, Cloyd Duff, Vic Firth, and Fred Hinger. This work is unique in its original blending of the use of different special effects and techniques with lyrical and beautifully conceived textures and melodies. Due to its technical and musical demands, images stands as one of the premier pieces in the solo timpani repertory and well represents the graduate level of achievement. Encounters V also by Mr. Kraft, is scored for one percussionist and 'cello and was inspired by a poem by Carl Faber entitled In the Morning of the Winter sea, which reads as follows: This work, commissioned by the ford foundation for violoncellist Nathaniel Rosen, was premiered in new York by the composer and Mr. Rosen in 1976 and revised into its present state in 1982. The percussion part of the piece is written for vibraphone (played with bass bows, normal mallets, and specially made "cluster" mallets), three tams, five graduated drums, crotales, and car spring coil, while the 'cello part makes use of difficult harmonics, col legno, pizzicato and snap pizzicato techniques. Together these parts blend to from an eerie musical atmosphere reminiscent of Mr. Faber's poem. Also part of the modern repertory for percussion, the Duo for Two Marimbas by David Wheatley is a Three movement work composed in 1978 and scored for two percussionists playing two marimbas. the first movement features challenging four-mallet work and difficult mallet changes as the texture moves from boisterous septal chordal exclamations to softer, more lyrical textures and melodies. The second movements is a study in space and control as each player Navigates a very sparse musical landscape where texture is altered by changes in mallet type and hardness. The finale is an exciting two mallet movement based on quartal harmony. The final work of the recital is a piece of some importance to the continuing legacy of jazz music and specifically jazz drumming, music which exits only in the twentieth century. This piece was passed to Jazz drummer Max Roach aurally by Jonathan (Papa Jo) Jones, drummer with the early Count Basie Band, who composed this work. This aural transmission is a staple of the African tradition in jazz music. performed on the Hi-Hat alone,"this piece," says Mr. Roach,"teaches one how to do the most with the least.... The title of the piece is simply 'Papa Jo"...|$|R
