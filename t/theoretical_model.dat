5|$|According to {{a summary}} of the research, {{atmospheric}} water absorption in such an exoplanet renders it larger in appearance across one part of the infrared spectrum, compared to wavelengths in the visible spectrum. Barman took Knutson's Hubble data on HD 209458 b, applied to his <b>theoretical</b> <b>model,</b> and allegedly identified water absorption in the planet's atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|Based on the {{theories}} of his predecessors, Zhang Heng systematically developed the celestial sphere theory. An armillary constructed {{on the basis of}} his hypotheses bears a remarkable similarity to Ptolemy's earth-centered theory. However, Zhang Heng did not definitely propose a <b>theoretical</b> <b>model</b> like Ptolemy's earth-centered one. It is astonishing that the celestial model Zhang Heng constructed was almost a physical model of Ptolemy's earth-centered theory. Only a single step separates the celestial globe from the earth-centered theory, but Chinese astronomers never took that step.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the stresses in V-section band clamps by examining the correlation between experimental work and <b>theoretical</b> <b>models.</b> <b>Theoretical</b> <b>models</b> incorporating traditional beam-bending theories and allowing for friction were developed to calculate the stress distribution and displacements within the clamps. The <b>theoretical</b> <b>models</b> demonstrated that the normal manufacturing tolerances associated with this type of component, combined with the uncontrolled operating parameters, will produce a wide variation in working stresses. These <b>theoretical</b> <b>models</b> were validated using strain and displacement measurements from a test with a V-section band clamp positioned around rigid anges. The experimental results all fell within the range of stresses predicted by the <b>theoretical</b> <b>models.</b> The paper provides a knowledge base for the rational design of V-section band clamps...|$|R

5|$|In a 1970 paper, Glashow, John Iliopoulos and Luciano Maiani {{presented}} the so-called GIM mechanism {{to explain the}} experimental non-observation of flavor-changing neutral currents. This <b>theoretical</b> <b>model</b> required {{the existence of the}} as-yet undiscovered charm quark. The number of supposed quark flavors grew to the current six in 1973, when Makoto Kobayashi and Toshihide Maskawa noted that the experimental observation of CP violation could be explained if there were another pair of quarks.|$|E
5|$|On April 24, the {{astronomer}} David Charbonneau, {{who led the}} team that made the Hubble observations, cautioned that the telescope itself may have introduced variations that caused the <b>theoretical</b> <b>model</b> to suggest the presence of water.

5|$|Estimating {{the age and}} {{metallicity}} of cool {{stars is}} difficult due {{to the formation of}} diatomic molecules in their atmospheres, which makes the spectrum extremely complex. By fitting the observed spectrum to model spectra, it is estimated that Gliese 876 has a slightly lower abundance of heavy elements compared to the Sun (around 75% the solar abundance of iron). Based on chromospheric activity the star is likely to be around 6.5 to 9.9 billion years old, depending on the <b>theoretical</b> <b>model</b> used. However, the low rotational period of the star as well as its membership among the young disk population suggest that the star is between 0.1–5 billion years old.|$|E
