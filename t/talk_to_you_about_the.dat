2500|$|Senator Edwards, as we wrap up {{the foreign}} policy part of this, I do want to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Israeliâ€“Palestinian conflict. Today, {{a senior member of}} Islamic Jihad was killed in Gaza. There have been suicide bombings, {{targeted}} assassinations, mortar attacks, all of this continuing {{at a time when the}} United States seems absent in the peace-making process. What would your administration do? First of all, do you agree that the United States is absent? Maybe you don't. But what would your administration do to try to resolve that conflict? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Like to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{growth of}} real estate out beyond your Grantsville warehouse. I {{might be able to}} tip you off to a thing or two, possibly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dill, I want to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> {{time you}} {{were out in the}} South Seas," [...] said Dave, who could bear the {{suspense}} no longer. [...] "Now, please follow me closely, will you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|And he {{answered}} them and said, 'I will <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> {{all other things}} that are in heaven and on earth, but about God I will not <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you.</b> Neither now, nor at any time, will I <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> God.' ...|$|R

60|$|Of course. There are one or {{two things}} I'd like <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{must try}} to be brave," [...] she smiled up at him at length. [...] "And you are my trustee. Please bring those papers I laid down. I suppose I must <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> farm." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Elgood {{has been}} here this afternoon," [...] she said, [...] "from Sheffield. He is the {{secretary}} of the Union, you know. He is coming again to-morrow morning. He wants to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> boys' age limit." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look at {{her words}} to us," [...] said Priscilla. [...] "What {{business}} has she to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> credit {{of the family}} and abominable disgrace? You have held your head up in poverty, while she has been rolling in money." ...|$|E
60|$|The Khedive's {{mother has}} asked me <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> {{a man called}} Abdul Said.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know nothing," [...] Courtlaw {{answered}} hurriedly. [...] "Ask me nothing. I {{will not}} <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> Miss Pellissier or her affairs." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wetmore {{has been}} <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> me. He would {{sacrifice}} {{his best friend}} to a phrase. He spends his time making them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "At last, my dear guest," [...] Mr. Fentolin exclaimed, {{turning to}} Hamel, [...] "I {{am able to}} return to you. If you will drink no more wine, let us have our coffee in the library, you and I. I want to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Tower." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I want to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Flying Scud and Mr. Carthew," [...] I resumed. [...] "Come, {{you must}} have {{expected}} this. I am sure you know all; you are shrewd, and must have a guess that I know much. How are we to stand to one another? and how am I to stand to Mr. Carthew?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{funny thing}} is, I'm not at all. I {{ought to have}} known this would happen. I was a fool to bring you together. I know {{perfectly}} well that he's got every advantage over me; he's much jollier, and he's very handsome, he's more amusing, he can <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> things that interest you." ...|$|E
60|$|Jack. Bunbury! Well, I won't {{have him}} <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> Bunbury or about {{anything}} else. It {{is enough to}} drive one perfectly frantic.|$|R
60|$|MRS. CHEVELEY. Quite seriously. I want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> a great {{political}} and financial scheme, about this Argentine Canal Company, in fact.|$|R
6000|$|... "Speaking of the practical," [...] I said, [...] "there {{were three}} things I came <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about.</b> First and foremost, that cow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, brother, {{you are too}} bad," [...] said Miss Emily, as she bustled {{about her}} bonnet and shawl. [...] "Now, that's all made up out of whole cloth. Captain Broad called last week a Monday, to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> pews, and hardly spoke a word to me. You oughtn't to say such things, 'cause it raises reports." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{you will}} endure {{a host of}} children,' said Mr. Ashford, 'I should like it of all things,' said Guy. 'I want to make {{acquaintance}} very much,' {{and he put his}} hand on Robert's shoulder. 'Besides, I want to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> singing, and how we are to get rid of that fiddle without breaking James Robinson's heart.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Uncle Isham," [...] said she, {{after she}} had watched the process of turnip pulling for a few minutes, [...] "if you haven't {{anything}} else to do when you get through with this, you might come up to the house, and I will <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> flower beds, I suppose they ought to be made ready for the winter." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know that}} what I have <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> is of the utmost importance," [...] said Worthington. [...] "Let us say Saturday night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'll {{get them}} after supper. In the {{meanwhile}} there's something Tom Gallwey wants <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about.</b> Hadn't <b>you</b> better put up your horse?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come ashore; we want <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> {{something}} particular." [...] They saw the dinghy {{pulled up}} to the ship's side, then Atkins rowed ashore.|$|R
6000|$|... "I had {{an errand}} {{yesterday}} which I did not finish; {{that is why}} I am here again so soon. You will not think me too troublesome when I tell you that I came to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> injustice that has been shown towards Mr. Lydgate. It will cheer you--will it not?--to {{know a great deal}} about him, that he may not like to speak about himself just because it is in his own vindication and to his own honor. You will like to know that your husband has warm friends, who have not left off believing in his high character? You will let me speak of this without thinking that I take a liberty?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} makes it cost so. Provisions are cheap enough, and they say people live in as good style for a third less in London. There {{used to be a}} superstition that you could live for less in a flat, and they always <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> cost of a furnace, and a man to tend it and keep the snow shovelled off your sidewalk, but that is all stuff. Five hundred dollars will make up the whole difference, and more. You pay quite as much rent for a decent flat, and then you don't get half the room. No, if it wasn't for the stairs, I wouldn't live in a flat for an instant. But that makes all the difference." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I must confess," [...] he said, [...] "that I {{feel the}} deepest {{interest}} in what the Bishop has just said. I could not <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> military situation, even if I knew more than you do, {{which is not the}} case, but I think it is clear that we have reached something like a temporary impasse. There certainly seems to be no cause for alarm upon any front, yet, not only in London, but in Paris and even Rome, there is a curious uneasiness afoot, for which no one can, account which no one can bring home to any definite cause. In the same connection, we have confidential information that a new spirit of hopefulness is abroad in Germany. It has been reported to us that sober, clear-thinking men--and there are a few of them, even in Germany--have predicted peace before a month is out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly not!" [...] said Mrs. Jackson. [...] "I {{come here}} because my {{conscience}} tells me to. What I wish <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> concerns us all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come," [...] I said, [...] "what are {{the things}} <b>you</b> want me <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about,</b> {{and why are you}} tired of talking {{nonsense}} with Arthur?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're inhuman," [...] I answered. [...] "It's as useless <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> {{these things}} as to {{describe}} colours {{to a man}} who was born blind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's all right," [...] {{he began}} with a certain {{satisfaction}} in this rare opportunity for Machiavellian diplomacy, [...] "it's all fixed now. Rosey tumbled to it at once, partiklerly when I said you was bound to go. 'But wot makes Mr. Renshaw go, father,' sez she; 'wot makes everybody run away from the ship?' sez she, rather peart-like and sassy for her. 'Mr. Renshaw hez contractin' business,' sez I; 'got a big thing up in Sacramento that'll make his fortun','sez I--for I wasn't goin' to give yer away, don't ye see?' He had some business to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> ship,' sez she, lookin' at me under {{the corner of her}} pocket-handkerchief. 'Lots o' business,' sez I. 'Then I reckon he don't care to hev me write to him,' sez she. 'Not a bit,' sez I; 'he wouldn't answer ye if ye did. Ye'll never hear from that chap agin.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wos Jenny {{here when}} the lady come? Yes, she wos here when the lady come. Wot did the lady say to her? Well, I'll tell you wot the lady said to her. She said, 'You {{remember}} me as come one time to <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> young lady {{as had been}} a-wisiting of you? You remember me as give you somethink handsome for a handkercher wot she had left?' Ah, she remembered. So we all did. Well, then, wos that young lady {{up at the house}} now? No, she warn't up at the house now. Well, then, lookee here. The lady was upon a journey all alone, strange as we might think it, and could she rest herself where you're a setten for a hour or so. Yes she could, and so she did. Then she went--it might be at twenty minutes past eleven, and it might be at twenty minutes past twelve; we ain't got no watches here to know the time by, nor yet clocks. Where did she go? I don't know where she go'd. She went one way, and Jenny went another; one went right to Lunnun, and t'other went right from it. That's all about it. Ask this man. He heerd it all, and see it all. He knows." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lord Warburton {{had asked}} leave to bid good-bye to Pansy, but neither Isabel nor Osmond had made any motion to send for her. He had {{the air of}} giving out that his visit must be short; {{he sat on a}} small chair, as if it were only for a moment, keeping his hat in his hand. But he stayed and stayed; Isabel {{wondered}} what he was waiting for. She believed it was not to see Pansy; she had an impression that on the whole he would rather not see Pansy. It was of course to see herself alone--he had something to say to her. Isabel had no great wish to hear it, for she was afraid it would be an explanation, and she could perfectly dispense with explanations. Osmond, however, presently got up, like a man of good taste to whom it had occurred that so inveterate a visitor might wish to say just the last word of all to the ladies. [...] "I've a letter to write before dinner," [...] he said; [...] "you must excuse me. I'll see if my daughter's disengaged, and if she is she shall know you're here. Of course when you come to Rome you'll always look us up. Mrs. Osmond will <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> English expedition: she decides all those things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not just yet. I've {{several things}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about.</b> Sit down. That's right. Now cover up your poor little pink ankles, or you'll be catching----" ...|$|R
60|$|LORD AUGUSTUS. [Going to him.] My dear fellow, you mustn't go yet. I {{have a lot}} <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about.</b> And Cecil has {{something}} <b>to</b> show <b>you.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Greenwood," [...] she said, [...] "I really cannot <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>about</b> these things. My head is aching very badly, and I {{must ask}} <b>you</b> <b>to</b> go." ...|$|R
