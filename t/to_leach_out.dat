25|$|The {{staple foods}} then used by other American Indian tribes, corn and/or potatoes, would not grow without {{irrigation}} in the typically short three- to five-month wet season and nine- to seven-month dry seasons of California (see Mediterranean climate). Despite this, the natural abundance of California, {{and the environmental}} management techniques developed by California tribes over millennia, allowed for the highest population density in the Americas north of Mexico. Indians thrived by catching and eating deer, Tule elk, small game, fish, mollusks, grass seed, berries, insects, edible plants and roots, {{making it possible to}} sustain a subsistence hunter-gatherer economy without any agriculture. Without agriculture or migratory herds of animals or fish there are no known ways to support villages, towns or cities—small tribes and extended family groups are the typical hunter-gatherer grouping. A dietary staple for most Indian tribes in interior California was acorns, which were dried, shelled, ground to flour, roasted and soaked in water <b>to</b> <b>leach</b> <b>out</b> their tannin. The holes they ground into large rocks over centuries of use are still visible in many rocks today.|$|E

30|$|However, {{there is}} a {{decrease}} in the dechlorination efficiency of 2, 4 -DCP. Dechlorination efficiency is obtained as 95.8, 71.3, 54.3, and 37.5  % in four-cycles of dechloronation reaction. The decrease of dechlorination in consecutive cycles might be due <b>to</b> <b>leaching</b> <b>out</b> of the iron from the reagent. Reimpregnation of Fe 3 + ions onto MCM- 48 is also tried by soaking it in saturated FeCl 3 solution and NaBH 4 solution, respectively. Dechloronation of 2, 4 -DCP is repeated for four cycles with reimpregnated MCM- 48 after each usage of reagent. Dechlorination efficiency at the presence of reimpregnated MCM- 48 is obtained as 94.3, 87.6, 72.6, and 59.2  % in four cycles.|$|R
2500|$|Bisphenol A (BPA) is a {{chemical}} {{used to make}} plastics, and is frequently used to make baby bottles, water bottles, sports equipment, medical devices, and as a coating in food and beverage cans. [...] Scientists are concerned about BPA's behavioral effects on fetuses, infants, and children at current exposure levels because it can affect the prostate gland, mammary gland, and lead to early puberty in girls. BPA mimics and interferes with the action of estrogen—an important reproduction and development regulator. It leaches out of plastic into liquids and foods, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found measurable amounts of BPA in the bodies of more than 90 percent of the U.S. population studied. [...] The highest estimated daily intakes of BPA occur in infants and children. Many plastic baby bottles contain BPA, and BPA is more likely <b>to</b> <b>leach</b> <b>out</b> of plastic when its temperature is increased, as when one warms a baby bottle or warms up food in the microwave.|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} sodium and {{magnesium}} chlorides and sulphates on nitrogen metabolism of corn seedlings and their constituent parts have been studied. Treatment with all salts {{led to a}} decrease in the nitrogen content of the seedling as a whole, and the decrease became more pronounced with the increase of salt concentration, though these concentrations were too low to induce any osmotic action. The same trend of changes was noticed as regards nonprotein-N, whereas the opposite was recorded in reference to the changes; of protein-N. Higher concentrations of the salt solutions led <b>to</b> <b>leaching</b> <b>out</b> of more nonprotein-N than did lower concentrations. The study of the distribution of nitrogenous constituents among the different organs of the seedling showed that while the total-N content of the whole seedling decreased with the increase of salt concentration, the total-N content of the roots decreased markedly, and the total-N content of the tops decreased also but less whereas, the total-N content of the grains increased with the increase of salt concentration as compared with that in the control.

30|$|Another {{important}} top-down {{technique that}} is employed, {{especially for the}} fabrication of MXenes, is the etching process [22, 48].

It {{should be noted that}} etching is strongly dependent on reaction kinetics and different MXenes have their own specific etching times [87]. Also, if etching is done {{in the presence of a}} metal halide instead of pure HF, the halide atoms tend to intercalate in between the MXene sheets making their exfoliation even easier [88].|$|R
40|$|Ultra-thin Cd(₁ ₋ ₓ) Zn(ₓ) S/CdTe {{devices were}} {{produced}} by atmospheric pressure metal organic {{chemical vapour deposition}} (AP-MOCVD) with varying CdTe absorber thicknesses ranging from 1. 0 to 0. 2 mm and compared to baseline cells with total CdTe thickness of 2. 25 μ. The ultra-thin CdTe layers (≤ 1 μm) were intentionally doped with As to induce p-type conductivity in the absorber. Cell performance reduced with CdTe thickness, with the magnitude of photo-current generation loss becoming more significant for the very thin CdTe layers. The decline in cell performance was lower than the optically limited performance relating to a decrease in shunt resistance, Rsh, especially for the thinnest cells due to areas of incomplete CdTe coverage and large presence of pin-holes leading to micro-shorts. Incorporation of Zn into the CdS window layer improved cell performance for all devices except when 0. 2 μm thick CdTe was used. This improvement was markedly in the blue region owing to enhanced optical transparency of the window layer. External quantum efficiency (EQE) measurements showed a red-shift of the window layer absorption edge due <b>to</b> <b>leaching</b> <b>out</b> of Zn during the CdCl₂ treatment. Reduction of the CdCl₂ deposition time was demonstrated to recover the blue response of the ultra-thin cells...|$|R

50|$|The pith {{contains}} edible starch, and is {{used for}} making sago. Before use, the starch must be carefully washed <b>to</b> <b>leach</b> <b>out</b> toxins contained in the pith. Extracting edible starch from the sago cycad requires special care due to the poisonous nature of cycads. Cycad sago is used {{for many of the}} same purposes as palm sago. Sago is extracted from the sago cycad by cutting the pith from the stem, root and seeds of the cycads, grinding the pith to a coarse flour and then washing it carefully and repeatedly <b>to</b> <b>leach</b> <b>out</b> the natural toxins. The starchy residue is then dried and cooked, producing a starch similar to palm sago/sabudana. The cycad seed contains cycasin toxin and should not be eaten as it is possible for cycasin toxin to survive the most vigorous of repeated washings. Cycasin toxin can cause ALS, Parkinson's, prostate cancer and fibrolemellar hepatocellular carcinoma.|$|E

500|$|Supplements of {{potassium}} are {{most widely used}} in conjunction with diuretics that block reabsorption of sodium and water upstream from the distal tubule (thiazides and loop diuretics), because this promotes increased distal tubular potassium secretion, with resultant increased potassium excretion. A variety of prescription and over-the counter supplements are available. [...] Potassium chloride may be dissolved in water, but the salty/bitter taste make liquid supplements unpalatable. Typical doses range from 10mmol (400mg), to 20mmol (800mg).

40|$|Revised May 1993.. Facts and {{recommendations}} in this publication {{may no longer}} be valid. Please look for up-to-date information in the OSU Extension Catalog: [URL] State University researchers made a significant discovery in 1958. They found that the underlying cause of white muscle disease is a dietary deficiency of the trace element selenium (Se). There is a fairly clear-cut relationship between soil, plant, and animal factors. Certain soils, including some formed by volcanic action in the Northwest within the past 10, 000 years or so contain practically no selenium. As a result, plants grown in them are seriously selenium-deficient. This deficiency is passed on to animals eating these plants as fresh forage, hay, or silage as all or most of their diet. In addition to the amount of selenium in these volcanic soils, the supply is affected by intensive cropping practices. Irrigation tends <b>to</b> <b>leach</b> selenium <b>out</b> of the topsoil, and the application of some commercial fertilizers that result in higher crop yields reduces the percentage of selenium in the forage...|$|R

50|$|Ponding is the (typically) {{unwanted}} pooling of water, typically on a {{flat roof}} or roadway. Ponding water accelerates the deterioration of many materials, including seam adhesives in single-ply roof systems, steel equipment supports, and particularly roofing asphalt.

50|$|This is {{achieved}} in practice {{through a process}} called double leaching. The calcine is first leached in a neutral or slightly acidic solution (of sulfuric acid) in order <b>to</b> <b>leach</b> the zinc <b>out</b> of the zinc oxide. The remaining calcine is then leached in strong sulfuric acid <b>to</b> <b>leach</b> {{the rest of the}} zinc out of the zinc oxide and zinc ferrite. The result of this process is a solid and a liquid; the liquid contains the zinc and is often called leach product; the solid is called leach residue and contains precious metals (usually lead and silver) which are sold as a by-product. There is also iron in the leach product from the strong acid leach, which is removed in an intermediate step, in the form of goethite, jarosite, and haematite. There is still cadmium, copper, arsenic, antimony, cobalt, germanium, nickel, and thallium in the leach product. Therefore, it needs to be purified.|$|R
40|$|As part of {{a general}} study aiming to clarify the role of {{arabinoxylans}} (AX) in pasta processing and quality, AX were modified by the addition of endoxylanases during pasta processing. The influence on processing parameters and quality were determined. Pasta (800 g) was produced from two commercial semolinas (semA and semB) using dosages of Bacillus subtilis (XBS) and Aspergillus niger (XAN) endoxylanases of 0 - 0. 225 Somogyi units/g of semolina. Increased dosages resulted in a drop of extrusion pressure. The endoxylanase treatments had no great effect on the resulting pasta quality (color of dry products and surface condition, viscoelastic index, and resistance to longitudinal deformations of cooked products). High dosages of XAN and XBS resulted in high levels of solubilized AX (as an extra source of soluble dietary fiber) of low molecular weight which were expected <b>to</b> easily <b>leach</b> <b>out</b> during the cooking process of pasta.
