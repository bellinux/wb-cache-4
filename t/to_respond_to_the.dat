5|$|A {{few days}} after Babs struck the Philippines, then-Philippine {{president}} Joseph Estrada declared four provinces as a state of calamity and ordered the release of ₱200million (PHP) in emergency funds.

The Philippine Navy sent rubber boats to Bato, Catanduanes to help with relief there. The president ordered agencies to work together <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> disaster and for his Trade Secretary to watch for price gouging.

5|$|After {{reaching}} Australian waters, Sydney {{spent most}} of her time on fleet exercises and training cruises. In 1938, the cruiser was one of several RAN units prepared <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Munich crisis, but all ships stood down after the potential war was averted. From 17 to 19 April 1939, Sydney was one of eight warships involved in a joint forces trade protection exercise off the south-east Australian coast. In early August 1939, Sydney was in Darwin, prior to visiting the Netherlands East Indies. However, in response to the events which prompted the start of World War II, Sydney was ordered to sail to Fremantle on a war footing, where she arrived on 22 August.|$|E
5|$|Allied naval commanders {{decided to}} use battleships to conduct a series of attacks against Japanese coastal cities in mid-1945.

However, the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters had anticipated that the Allies would conduct bombardments and other operations with this goal, and decided to not attack naval forces operating off Japan. Instead, the aircraft would remain in reserve until Allied landing operations in the home islands began.|$|E

5|$|Coverage in Germany {{was more}} muted, with some {{newspapers}} strongly criticising {{those who had}} taken part, and no pictures published. In France, meanwhile, the greater level of press censorship ensured that the only word that spread of the truce came from soldiers at the front or first-hand accounts told by wounded men in hospitals. The press was eventually forced <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> growing rumours by reprinting a government notice that fraternising with the enemy constituted treason, and in early January an official statement on the truce was published, claiming it had happened on restricted sectors of the British front, and amounted {{to little more than}} an exchange of songs which quickly degenerated into shooting.|$|E

5|$|James Fleming {{has written}} {{about the use of}} the postmodern {{tradition}} in 1602, and how this is employed; as a means <b>to</b> <b>respond</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> post-9/11 world in which the comic was written; and to propose a new model of postmodernism better suited to the post-9/11 world. On the one hand, 1602 is clearly postmodern, depending as it does on the mixing of tropes of both Elizabethan fiction and contemporary comics. But Fleming focuses particularly on Gaiman's use of The Watcher as a witness that provides an epistemological grounding to the text - a grounding that, citing Brian McHale, Fleming argues is absent in traditional postmodern writing.|$|E
