5|$|At the 2001 UK census, {{there were}} 1,805,315 {{residents}} of Greater Manchester aged 16 to 74. The economic activity of <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>was</b> 40.3% in full-time employment, 11.3% in part-time employment, 6.7% self-employed, 3.5% unemployed, 5.1% students without jobs, 2.6% students with jobs, 13.0% retired, 6.1% looking after home or family, 7.8% permanently sick or disabled and 3.5% economically inactive for other reasons. The figures follow the national trend, although {{the percentage of}} self-employed people is {{below the national average}} of 8.3%. The proportion of unemployment in the county varies, with the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport having the lowest at 2.0% and Manchester the highest at 7.9%. In 2001, of the 1,093,385residents of Greater Manchester in employment, the industry of employment was: 18.4% retail and wholesale; 16.7% manufacturing; 11.8% property and business services; 11.6% health and social work; 8.0% education; 7.3% transport and communications; 6.7% construction; 4.9% public administration and defence; 4.7% hotels and restaurants; 4.1% finance; 0.8% electricity, gas, and water supply; 0.5% agriculture; and 4.5% other. This was roughly in line with national figures, except for the proportion of jobs in agriculture which is only {{about a third of the}} national average of 1.5%, due to the overwhelmingly urban, built-up land use of Greater Manchester.|$|E

25|$|The {{indigenous}} Australians or Aboriginal {{people had}} lived {{in what is now}} New South Wales for at least 50,000 years, making their living through hunting, gathering and fishing. The impact of European settlement on <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>was</b> immediate and devastating. They had no natural resistance to European diseases, and epidemics of measles and smallpox spread far ahead of the frontier of settlement, radically reducing population and fatally disrupting indigenous society. Although there was some resistance to European occupation, in general the indigenous people were evicted from their lands without difficulty. Dispossession, disease, violence and alcohol reduced them to a remnant within a generation in most areas.|$|E
25|$|The ancient Puebloan culture, {{also known}} as the Anasazi, {{occupied}} territory adjacent to the Fremont. The ancestral Puebloan culture centered on the present-day Four Corners area of the Southwest United States, including the San Juan River region of Utah. Archaeologists debate when this distinct culture emerged, but cultural development seems to date from about the common era, about 500 years before the Fremont appeared. It is generally accepted that the cultural peak of <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>was</b> around the 1200 CE. Ancient Puebloan culture is known for well constructed pithouses and more elaborate adobe and masonry dwellings. They were excellent craftsmen, producing turquoise jewelry and fine pottery. The Puebloan culture was based on agriculture, and the people created and cultivated fields of maize, beans, and squash and domesticated turkeys. They designed and produced elaborate field terracing and irrigation systems. They also built structures, some known as kivas, apparently designed solely for cultural and religious rituals.|$|E

[...] Their {{response to the}} increasing presence of <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>was</b> to enact tougher laws, and on 19 October 1658 a new law was passed in the Massachusetts colony that introduced capital punishment. [...] Quakers would be banished from the colony upon pain of death, meaning they would be hanged if they defied the law. [...] Dyer, Davis, Robinson and Stephenson were then brought to court, and then sentenced to [...] "banishment upon pain of death" [...] under the new law.

The Maritime Archaic period is best known from a mortuary site in Newfoundland at Port au Choix.|$|E

To quote Colin Irwin: [...] "They merged the familiar American folk style so popular in the early sixties with a distinctively home-grown Irish flavour; it was not Irish music but it was real and exciting, it had verve, imagination and style." [...] A distinctive aspect of the Sweeney's Men sound was Moynihan's introduction of the bouzoukioriginally a Greek instrumentinto Irish music, albeit with a different tuning: GDAD' (one octave lower than the open-tuned mandolin), instead of the modern Greek tuning of CFAD'.|$|E
2500|$|This text, {{which became}} known as the [...] "May 16 Notification" [...] (...) , {{summarized}} Mao's ideological justification for the Cultural Revolution.

[...] The only way to identify <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>was</b> through [...] "the telescope and microscope of Mao Zedong Thought." [...] While the party leadership was relatively united in approving the general direction of Mao's agenda, many Politburo members were not especially enthusiastic, or simply confused about the direction of the movement.
