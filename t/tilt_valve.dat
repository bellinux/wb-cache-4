40|$|A flow {{visualization}} {{study of}} prosthetic aortic and mitral heart valves {{in a model}} of the aorta and left heart An in vitro flow visualization study has been carried out on a range of aortic and mitral valve prostheses mounted in rigid, transparent models of the aorta and left ventricle.

The patterns were recorded by still photography and high speed cinematography. In the mitral region each <b>tilting</b> disc <b>valve</b> produced a large vortex which dominated the ventricular cavity. By contrast disc and ball valves each produced an annular vortex, and the bioprosthesis produced a central flow.

40|$|AbstractObjectives: To {{evaluate}} midterm {{results of}} mechanical valves in pulmonary position {{in patients with}} pulmonary regurgitation and right ventricular dysfunction {{as an alternative to}} bioprostheses. Patients: Mechanical <b>valves</b> (six <b>tilting</b> disc <b>valves</b> and two bileaflet valves) were implanted in eight patients previously operated on for tetralogy of Fallot (n = 7) and truncus arteriosus (n = 1), with severe right ventricular dysfunction caused by massive pulmonary regurgitation. Results: All patients survived prosthesis implantation and are currently well. At follow-up (3 months to 9 years), they do not show signs of valve failure, and right ventricular function has dramatically improved in all but one, who still shows moderate ventricular hypokinesia. Conclusion: After operative correction of congenital heart defects in selected patients who show severe dysfunction of the right ventricle caused by pulmonary regurgitation/stenosis, mechanical valves may represent an alternative to bioprosthetic valves. The selection of the valve type is still a matter of debate. However, according to literature data, complications seem to have occurred only in patients with bileaflet mechanical valves in the pulmonary position, whereas no thromboembolic episodes or valve failure is reported in subjects with <b>tilting</b> disc <b>valves</b> in the right ventricular outflow. <b>Tilting</b> disc <b>valves</b> might perform better in the right ventricular outflow than bileaflet valves.

The present prospective study was aimed at assessing platelet P-selectin expression, platelet-leukocyte conjugate formation and platelet microparticles and comparing biological, bileaflet and tilting disc valvular prostheses in aortic position. METHODS: Thirty-three patients were included (15 bioprostheses, 11 bileaflet and 7 <b>tilting</b> disc mechanical <b>valves).</b> Blood samples were analyzed by flow cytometry immediately before surgery, on postoperative day 8 (D 8) and 2 months after surgery (M 2).

At M 2, platelet activation had returned to the basic level observed prior to surgery in the bileaflet valve group whereas, it was still increased in the bioprosthesis group.

The effective orifice area is a less flow-dependent parameter than Doppler gradients {{that is used to}} assess prosthetic valve function. However, in vivo reference values show a pronounced spread of effective orifice area and smaller orifices than expected compared with the geometric area. Methods: Using Doppler echocardiography, we studied patients who received a bileaflet St Jude Medical valve (n = 75; St Jude Medical, Inc, St Paul, Minn) or a <b>tilting</b> disc Omnicarbon <b>valve</b> (n = 46; MedicalCV, Incorporated, Inver Grove Heights, Minn). The prosthetic valves were also investigated in vitro in a steady-flow model with Doppler and catheter measurements in the different orifices. The effective orifice area was calculated according to the continuity equation. Results: In vivo, there was a wide distribution with the coefficient of variation (SD/mean × 100 %) for different valve sizes ranging from 21 % to 39 % in the St Jude Medical valve and from 25 % to 33 % in the Omnicarbon valve. The differences between geometric orifice area and effective orifice area in vitro were 1. 26 ± 0. 41 cm 2 for St Jude Medical and 1. 17 ± 0. 38 cm 2 for Omnicarbon valves. The overall effective orifice areas and peak catheter gradients were similar: 1. 35 ± 0. 37 cm 2 and 25. 9 ± 16. 1 mm Hg for St Jude Medical and 1. 46 ± 0. 49 cm 2 and 24. 6 ± 17. 7 mm Hg for Omnicarbon. However, in St Jude Medical valves, more pressure was recovered downstream, 11. 6 ± 6. 3 mm Hg versus 3. 4 ± 1. 6 mm Hg in Omnicarbon valves (P =. 0001). Conclusions: In the patients, we found a pronounced spread of effective orifice areas, which can be explained by measurement errors or true biologic variations. The in vitro effective orifice area was small compared with the geometric orifice area, and we suspect that nonuniformity in the spatial velocity profile causes underestimation. The St Jude Medical and Omnicarbon valves showed similar peak catheter gradients and effective orifice areas in vitro, but more pressure was recovered in the St Jude Medical valve.

The best systolic and diastolic axial reconstructions were selected for coronary assessment. Each present coronary segment was scored for the presence of valve-related artefacts prohibiting coronary artery assessment. Scoring was performed in consensus by two observers. Results Eighty-two CT angiograms were performed on a 64 -slice (= 27) or 256 -slice (= 55) multidetector CT. Eighty-nine valves and five annuloplasty rings were present. Forty-three out of 1160 (3. 7 %) present coronary artery segments were non-diagnostic due to valve artefacts (14 / 82 patients). Valve artefacts were located in right coronary artery (15 / 43; 35 %), left anterior descending artery (2 / 43; 5 %), circumflex artery (14 / 43; 32 %) and marginal obtuse (12 / 43; 28 %) segments. All cobalt-chrome containing valves caused artefacts prohibiting coronary assessment. Biological and titanium-containing valves did not cause artefacts except for three specific valve types. Conclusions Most commonly implanted prosthetic heart valves do not hamper coronary assessment on multidetector CT. Cobalt-chrome containing prosthetic heart valves preclude complete coronary artery assessment because of severe valve artefacts. Key Points Most commonly implanted prosthetic heart valves do not hamper coronary artery assessment Prosthetic heart valve composition determines the occurrence of prosthetic heart valve-related artefacts Bjork-Shiley and Sorin <b>tilting</b> disc <b>valves</b> preclude diagnostic coronary artery segment assessmen...|$|R
