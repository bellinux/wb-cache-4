25|$|Sometimes <b>turbo</b> <b>lag</b> is {{mistaken for}} engine speeds that are below boost {{threshold}}. If engine speed is below a turbocharger's boost threshold rpm then {{the time needed}} for the vehicle to build speed and rpm could be considerable, maybe even tens of seconds for a heavy vehicle starting at low vehicle speed in a high gear. This wait for vehicle speed increase is not <b>turbo</b> <b>lag,</b> it is improper gear selection for boost demand. Once the vehicle reaches sufficient speed to provide the required rpm to reach boost threshold, {{there will be a}} far shorter delay while the turbo itself builds rotational energy and transitions to positive boost, only this last part of the delay in achieving positive boost is the <b>turbo</b> <b>lag.</b>|$|E
25|$|Smaller turbochargers {{have less}} <b>turbo</b> <b>lag</b> than larger ones, so often two small turbochargers are {{used instead of}} one large one. This {{configuration}} is popular in engines over 2,500 CCs and in V-shape or boxer engines.|$|E
25|$|Ball {{bearings}} {{designed to}} support high speeds and temperatures are sometimes {{used instead of}} fluid bearings to support the turbine shaft. This helps the turbocharger accelerate more quickly and reduces <b>turbo</b> <b>lag.</b> Some variable nozzle turbochargers use a rotary electric actuator, which uses a direct stepper motor to open and close the vanes, rather than pneumatic controllers that operate based on air pressure.|$|E
40|$|The new {{generation}} vehicles {{are designed with}} feasible engineering techniques by reducing their engine sizes and making them more power full and to maintain European standards thus by reduced engine there is an reduced power so the engines are equipped with the forced induction systems like turbo chargers and super chargers thus as an complete manually working turbo chargers gona work completely on a electric motor thus the <b>turbo</b> <b>lags</b> will be reduced drastically and doesn’t give any load to the engine thus our electric turbo works on the principle the electric motor fixed {{to the end of}} a impeller and as the motor runs their will a movement in the impeller and it starts blowing the air inside the combustion chamber. The rate of acceleration is equal to the power given to motor by a service battery. The main components of the Electronic powered turbo are inside air flow assembly DC motor, potentiometer, DC driver, and a set of wiring harness...|$|R
50|$|Trionic 8 calculates {{how much}} power the driver wants as early as {{possible}} to avoid <b>turbo</b> kick or <b>lag,</b> therefore making driving smooth. As the driver depresses the accelerator pedal, it acts on a pedal position sensor integrated in the pedal bracket. This information, {{in the form of a}} voltage, is connected to the ECM which converts the voltage value to a torque request from the driver.|$|R
25|$|Twin-turbo or {{bi-turbo}} designs {{have two}} separate turbochargers operating {{in either a}} sequence or in parallel. In a parallel configuration, both turbochargers are fed one-half of the engine’s exhaust. In a sequential setup one turbocharger runs at low speeds and the second turns on at a predetermined engine speed or load. Sequential turbochargers further reduce <b>turbo</b> <b>lag,</b> but require an intricate set of pipes to properly feed both turbochargers.|$|E
25|$|Turbocharger lag (<b>turbo</b> <b>lag)</b> is {{the time}} {{required}} to change power output in response to a throttle change, noticed as a hesitation or slowed throttle response when accelerating as compared to a naturally aspirated engine. This is due to the time needed for the exhaust system and turbocharger to generate the required boost which can also be referred to as spooling. Inertia, friction, and compressor load are the primary contributors to turbocharger lag. Superchargers do not suffer this problem, because the turbine is eliminated due to the compressor being directly powered by the engine.|$|E
25|$|With {{high-performance}} camshaft timing, {{exhaust valves}} in different cylinders can be {{open at the}} same time, overlapping {{at the end of}} the power stroke in one cylinder and the end of exhaust stroke in another. In twin-scroll designs, the exhaust manifold physically separates the channels for cylinders that can interfere with each other, so that the pulsating exhaust gasses flow through separate spirals (scrolls). With common firing order 1-3-4-2, two scrolls of unequal length pair cylinders 1-4 and 3-2. This lets the engine efficiently use exhaust scavenging techniques, which decreases exhaust gas temperatures and NOx emissions, improves turbine efficiency, and reduces <b>turbo</b> <b>lag</b> evident at low engine speeds.|$|E
2500|$|Fans {{deemed the}} PA {{one of the}} most {{beautiful}} diesels and an [...] "Honorary Steam Locomotive", as noted by Professor George W. Hilton in a book review in September, 1968 Trains Magazine. When accelerating, until the turbocharger came up to speed thick clouds of black smoke would pour from the exhaust stacks, due to <b>turbo</b> <b>lag.</b> Photographing a moving PA while smoking became a prime objective of railfans ...|$|E
2500|$|The Turbo 2 uses a {{turbo charger}} with a twin scroll design. The smaller primary chamber is {{engineered}} {{to cancel the}} <b>turbo</b> <b>lag</b> at low engine speeds. At higher revolutions the secondary chamber is opened, pumping out 33% more power than the naturally aspirated counterpart. The Turbo 2 also has an air-to-air intercooler which has a dedicated intake on the hood. [...] The intake is slightly offset toward {{the left side of}} the hood.|$|E
2500|$|ZX-14 (the {{horsepower}} {{figures are}} expressed {{at the rear}} wheel). The same engine would generate [...] with [...] of pressure. His analysis included {{a discussion of the}} benefits of a two-speed supercharger for this application, to provide more linear power delivery (as opposed to the intractable Japanese turbo bikes of the 1980s that suffered from <b>turbo</b> <b>lag).</b> Cameron also said Kawasaki patent documents suggested the engine would rely on evaporative cooling using port fuel injection, instead of a bulky intercooler.|$|E
2500|$|All R/Ts {{were built}} in Mexico. A total of 1,208 were sold in the U.S. in 1991 [...] 774 in red and 434 in white. An {{additional}} 191 were sold in the U.S. in 1992 [...] 92 red, 68 white, and 31 silver. The only discernible changes for 1992 were a lower first gear ratio for reduced <b>turbo</b> <b>lag,</b> woodgrain dashboard trim as used on the Chrysler LeBaron sedan, blacked out upper and lower grille inserts, clear rather than amber lenses for the front parking and turn signal lights, and a speedometer calibrated to [...] rather than [...]|$|E
2500|$|The City Turbo {{shared the}} 1231 cc (1.2L) CVCC [...] "ER" [...] engine with its more {{pedestrian}} siblings, but {{the addition of}} a turbocharger meant that [...] at 5,500rpm and [...] at 3,000rpm were available. Further changes to the engine included an aluminum/titanium alloy head and a magnesium valve cover to keep the weight down. The IHI RHB51 turbocharger, developed as a joint venture between Ishikawajima Heavy Industry and Honda, was lighter and smaller than most other turbos and could run at higher rpm. When combined with Honda's PGM-FI fuel injection and an 8-bit digital computer control unit, the end result was a very efficient engine with minimal <b>turbo</b> <b>lag.</b> 0–100km/h was possible in 8.6 seconds.|$|E
2500|$|The fifth {{generation}} CR-V {{was also}} launched in Thailand on March 24, 2017, and in Indonesia on April 27, 2017 at the 2017 Indonesia International Motor Show. Indonesian models {{went on sale}} on June 17, 2017. The ASEAN models (excluding Indonesia and Malaysia) are available with a 1.6-liter Honda i-DTEC turbodiesel option (producing 160 horsepower and 350Nm of torque) paired to a ZF 9HP transversely-mounted 9-speed automatic transmission. The i-DTEC turbodiesel engine has been revised from having a single variable-nozzle turbocharger in the earlier version to having two turbochargers - one for low RPMs {{and the other for}} high RPMs - to minimize <b>turbo</b> <b>lag.</b> It uses an aluminum cylinder head paired to an open-deck cylinder block, with shorter and thinner piston skirts to reduce mechanical friction to levels comparable to a petrol engine.|$|E
2500|$|... 1977 {{also saw}} two radical {{technical}} innovations {{that would change}} the future of Formula One. The purpose of Lotus's experimentation in 1976 was revealed with the Lotus 78, which brought ground effect to Formula One for the first time, using wing-profiled sidepods sealed to the ground by sliding lexan skirts. Generating radically increased downforce with significantly less drag, the Lotus 78s driven by Mario Andretti and Gunnar Nilsson won five Grands Prix in 1977. Renault unveiled the second when their RS01 made its first appearance powered by a 1.5-litre turbocharged engine, derived from their sportscar unit. Although supercharged engines were successful in the 1950s and the regulations allowing for turbocharged engines had existed for 11 years, no Formula One team had built one, feeling that the fuel consumption and <b>turbo</b> <b>lag</b> (boost lag) would negate its superior power. Motor engineer Bernard Dudot, who had observed the turbocharged Offenhauser engines used in Champ Car racing in the USA, pushed for this choice.|$|E
2500|$|The {{sequential}} twin turbocharged system, introduced on {{this series}} in 1992, {{was a very}} complex piece of engineering, developed {{with the aid of}} Hitachi and previously used on the exclusive to Japan Cosmo series (JC Cosmo=90–95). The system was composed of two turbochargers, one to provide boost at low RPM. The second unit was on standby until the upper half of the rpm range during full throttle acceleration. The first turbocharger provided [...] of boost from 1800rpm, and the second turbocharger was activated at 4000rpm to maintain [...] until redline. The changeover process occurred at 4500 rpm, with a momentary dip in pressure to , and provided semi-linear acceleration and a wide torque curve the throughout the entire rev range under [...] "normal operation". However, under performance driving the changeover process produced a significant increase in power and forced technical drivers to adjust their driving style to anticipate and mitigate any over-steer during cornering. Many owners modified their turbo control systems into a parallel system by removing the exhaust manifold Turbo Control Valve and the turbo coupling [...] "y-pipe" [...] Charge Control Actuator and valve in order to remove the changeover process and to simplify the control system for reliability. <b>Turbo</b> <b>lag</b> was greatly increased below 4500rpm, but smooth and linear boost could be obtained. The stock turbo control system used 4 control solenoids, 4 actuators, both a vacuum and pressure chamber, and several feet of preformed vacuum/pressure hoses all of which were prone to failure in part to complexity and the inherent high temperatures of the rotary engine.|$|E
2500|$|The sheer top-end {{power of}} the BMW engines (around [...] in {{qualifying}} trim, with around [...] for racing) ensured that the B186s were always competitive, {{as evidenced by the}} fact that the cars were usually amongst the fastest through the speed traps. Indeed, Berger set the highest top speed of the season at Monza with [...] (Fabi was second quickest on the straight, and also took the pole while Berger started third, the pair split by defending World Champion Alain Prost in his McLaren-TAG which was actually some [...] slower through the speed trap). However, the handling of the chassis did not match this in the first part of the season as the team struggled with the 'light switch' power delivery of the BMW engine. The handling was eventually sorted but the car was often not on the ultimate pace of the front runners. The cars were also unreliable due to a shortage of spare parts and the strain placed on the chassis by the enormous {{power of the}} BMW engine, and less competitive on slower circuits where the power did not count for as much and the <b>turbo</b> <b>lag</b> of the 4 cylinder engine made it slower on low down acceleration than the V6 turbos of Honda, TAG, Ferrari and Renault. The team was also initially disadvantaged by its partnership with the tyre supplier Pirelli, when most of the front running teams were running Goodyears, as neither it or fellow-Pirelli user Brabham had managed to complete many laps during pre-season testing; the Italian company mostly relying on data from the Ligier team.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Turbo</b> <b>lag</b> {{was noted}} {{as a problem}} with all four Japanese turbos of the 1980s by several critics. Motorcycle {{engineering}} expert and journalist Kevin Cameron has said that <b>turbo</b> <b>lag</b> is a critical problem with turbocharger applications on motorcycles: [...] "Unless you are a pure drag racer, most of your riding will be off-boost. The lower your compression ratio, the less snap your bike will have...don't expect your turbo bike to be much use in sportbike-type canyon racing." [...] Using a variable-geometry turbocharger can mitigate <b>turbo</b> <b>lag,</b> but {{has not yet been}} used in series production (the first mass market application was to late 1980s automobiles; see Variable-geometry turbocharger#History and examples of use).|$|E
50|$|Sequential {{turbocharger}} systems {{provide a}} way to decrease <b>turbo</b> <b>lag</b> without compromising ultimate boost output and engine power.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes <b>turbo</b> <b>lag</b> is {{mistaken for}} engine speeds that are below boost {{threshold}}. If engine speed is below a turbocharger's boost threshold rpm then {{the time needed}} for the vehicle to build speed and rpm could be considerable, maybe even tens of seconds for a heavy vehicle starting at low vehicle speed in a high gear. This wait for vehicle speed increase is not <b>turbo</b> <b>lag,</b> it is improper gear selection for boost demand. Once the vehicle reaches sufficient speed to provide the required rpm to reach boost threshold, {{there will be a}} far shorter delay while the turbo itself builds rotational energy and transitions to positive boost, only this last part of the delay in achieving positive boost is the <b>turbo</b> <b>lag.</b>|$|E
50|$|ALS {{was first}} used {{in the early days}} of {{turbocharged}} cars in Formula One racing circa mid to late 1980s, until fuel restrictions made its use unsuitable. Later it became a common feature in rally cars because of the increased <b>turbo</b> <b>lag</b> from the mandated restrictors at the intake manifold inlet. Due to the pressure drop across the restriction, the pressure ratio for a given boost level is much higher and the turbocharger must spin much faster to produce the same boost as when the engine operates without restriction. This increases <b>turbo</b> <b>lag</b> significantly compared to unrestricted turbochargers.|$|E
50|$|Smaller turbochargers {{have less}} <b>turbo</b> <b>lag</b> than larger ones, so often two small turbochargers are {{used instead of}} one large one. This {{configuration}} is popular in engines over 2,500 CCs and in V-shape or boxer engines.|$|E
50|$|The MA09ERT was {{the first}} series-charged engine {{available}} in Japan; series charging combines the increased low-speed torque of supercharging with the increased high-speed torque and power of turbocharging. The presence of the supercharger also mimizes the effects of <b>turbo</b> <b>lag.</b>|$|E
50|$|Writer Mick Walker has listed <b>turbo</b> <b>lag</b> {{along with}} other {{challenges}} like a higher center of gravity and heat transfer to rider due to turbocharger and associated exhaust plumbing. Bennett noted excessive weight and complexity in addition to weak bottom-end performance.|$|E
5000|$|The M12's major {{shortcoming}} as a Formula One {{engine was}} {{its lack of}} throttle response due to <b>turbo</b> <b>lag.</b> Unlike the V6 and V8 turbocharged engines which ran with twin turbos (one for each bank of cylinders), the inline-4 BMW engine, like the other 4 cylinder turbo engines used in F1 such as the Hart 415T and the Zakspeed 1500/4, only used a single turbocharger. The twin turbo setups of the [...] "V" [...] engines eliminated much of the <b>turbo</b> <b>lag.</b> However, with only a single turbo, the BMW M12 suffered from approximately 2 seconds of <b>turbo</b> <b>lag</b> meaning drivers often had to start accelerating through the apex of a corner. The power from the turbo was described by many (including Piquet and Berger) as coming on like a light switch which often induced power oversteer in BMW powered cars. This was a major reason that the BMW was generally seen at its most competitive at power circuits such as Kyalami, Imola, Paul Ricard, Silverstone, Hockenheim, the Österreichring and Monza. On tighter tracks such as street circuits like Monaco and Detroit which required greater acceleration and less top speed, the BMW powered cars often lagged behind their major rivals.|$|E
50|$|A {{naturally}} aspirated engine is an internal combustion engine in which air intake depends solely on atmospheric pressure and which does not rely on forced induction through a turbocharger or a supercharger. Many sports cars specifically use {{naturally aspirated}} engines to avoid <b>turbo</b> <b>lag.</b>|$|E
50|$|Fitted with a {{completely}} new and more powerful 3-litre V6 petrol engine, the S5 has direct injection {{as well as a}} twin-scroll turbocharger to reduce both weight, and cost. The turbocharger is mounted within the engine V and as a result has reduced <b>turbo</b> <b>lag</b> response times.|$|E
50|$|The Turbo IV was a {{turbocharged}} SOHC intercooled {{version with}} variable nozzle turbo (VNT) technology. This system reduced <b>turbo</b> <b>lag.</b> Used in the 1989 Shelby CSX, then regular production 1990 Dodge Shadows, Daytonas, and Chrysler LeBarons. Production on this engine {{was limited to}} around 1250 units..|$|E
50|$|Mercedes-Benz's AMG {{division}} {{provides the}} engine of the Huayra which is hand-built. The 5,980 cc, twin-turbo, 60° AMG M158 V12, has been designed {{at the request of}} Pagani to reduce <b>turbo</b> <b>lag</b> and improve response, realized with smaller turbos, a different intercooler configuration and re-programmed ECU settings.|$|E
5000|$|... 1973: The next mass-produced {{turbocharged}} car was the Paul Rosche developed BMW's 2002 Turbo, {{introduced at}} the 1973 Frankfurt motor show and featuring a 2.0 L four-cylinder engine. Due to excessive <b>turbo</b> <b>lag,</b> safety concerns and the 1973/1974 oil crisis, the 2002 Turbo was discontinued in 1974.|$|E
50|$|According to road testing {{performed}} by Car and Driver magazine, the GT2 suffers from hardly any <b>turbo</b> <b>lag.</b> Despite a 10-millimeter reduction in ride height from the 911 Turbo, the drag coefficient is slightly higher — 0.34 Cd vs. the Turbo's 0.33 — {{due to the}} fixed rear wing.|$|E
50|$|It is most {{commonly}} used in auto racing (simultaneous gas and brake keeps turbo pressure and reduces <b>turbo</b> <b>lag),</b> but is also used by some drivers for use with an automatic transmission or in some electric cars, as the left foot is not needed to operate a clutch pedal.|$|E
50|$|The TPH {{drivetrain}} featured {{an electric}} motor-generator sandwiched between the gasoline motor, which used the Miller cycle, and the automatic transmission. The electric motor {{was intended to}} reduce <b>turbo</b> <b>lag</b> and boost fuel economy, with an estimated consumption of 40 mpg on the EPA combined city/highway cycle. The B5-TPH used manganese lithium-ion batteries.|$|E
5000|$|The engine uses {{two small}} {{low-pressure}} turbochargers to minimise <b>turbo</b> <b>lag.</b> The boost pressure is 8.8 psi, because BMW's {{goal was to}} offer the same driving feel as with naturally aspirated engines. BMW's term for turbocharging is [...] "TwinPower Turbo", which has also been applied to the N55, which uses a single twin-scroll turbocharger.|$|E
50|$|A big {{advantage}} of the air-to-liquid setup is the lower overall pipe and intercooler length, which offers faster response (lowers <b>turbo</b> <b>lag)</b> , giving peak boost faster than most front-mount intercooler setups. Some setups have reservoirs that can hold ice, producing intake temperatures lower than ambient air, giving a {{big advantage}} (but of course, ice would need constant replacement).|$|E
50|$|Turbochargers are in {{many ways}} more suited to {{operation}} in diesel engines. The smaller speed range that Diesel engines work in (between 1000 and 5000 rpm for a passenger car, and as little as 500-3000 rpm for a larger unit in a commercial vehicle) mean that the turbocharger has to change speed less, reducing <b>turbo</b> <b>lag</b> and improving efficiency.|$|E
