50|$|Alpine Pearls is a {{cooperation}} {{which has}} been established in 2006 and formed of 25 tourism municipalities in six alpine countries.

The cooperation’s members fulfill strict quality criteria like town centers with reduced <b>traffic,</b> <b>transfer</b> services, environmentally friendly leisure time facilities, the guarantee of mobility without car and ecological minimum standards.

50|$|In {{the figure}} on the right, a route exists between node A and node Q via nodes C, F, K, and L. In {{the event of a}} fiber-optic cable failure between nodes F and K, the LTE (FT Series G or the ADM) in these two offices detects and sends alarm reports for this failure to their {{respective}} RNCs. Both RNCs age the alarm and send these reports to RAPID, located at the NOC. RAPID initiates a time window to ensure all related alarms generated from the RNCs of the affected nodes and the RNC of any other office whose traffic utilizes the F to K failed fiber optic cable. When this window times out, RAPID performs route computation, to establish a new backup path for the traffic between node A and node Q. Here it creates a new route through C, F, G, J, K, and L. This route computation is also done sequentially in order of priority for all the traffic between any two nodes in the network that utilize the same failed fiber-optic cable. Once the backup path for all the traffic going through nodes F and K has been computed, RAPID ensures that there is continuity or connectivity along the established back-up paths by sending a command to the RNCs located at A and Q, both of which in turn use the test signal generated by their respective RTE to check for continuity in the link. When the connectivity of this backup path has been verified, the traffic between nodes A and Q is transferred to this backup path by commanding the DACS IIIs to make the appropriate cross connections. RAPID performs a service verification test to verify that the service transfer was successful. If this test returns a positive result, then the service transfer was successful, else the service transfer was unsuccessful and needs to be repeated. This service or <b>traffic</b> <b>transfer</b> process is performed for all the traffic going through the affected fiber optic cable F-K.FASTAR restores as much of the affected traffic demand as the available protection capacity will allow.|$|E

We verify then the proposed algorithm by simulations, proposing a new shaping mechanism at the ingress nodes, the BLUE AQM, initially developed for congestion control...|$|E

30|$|Finally, since TCP <b>traffic</b> <b>transfers</b> require ACK packets {{to be sent}} back, the TCP {{throughput}} will {{be severely}} degraded when either the bandwidth of the uplink or downlink flows is too small. Therefore, each station must maintain a minimum guaranteed bandwidth for both uplink and downlink direction {{in order to allow}} a flow to grow in the future. In addition, if the queue holds the bandwidth consumption rate as much as the minimum guaranteed bandwidth, it also implies that this queue is likely to be greedy.|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} a Variable Structure System (VSS),in which the {{structure}} {{is determined by the}} dynamical response, is described and measurements and simulations on VSSs comprising electronic systems which display bursty chaotic or " intermittent " behaviour, and also on a network <b>traffic</b> <b>transfer</b> protocol, which is demonstrated to be a VSS in the same sense, are used to support the thesis that such bursty behaviour is common in such systems.

The studies of these simple electronic systems provide insight for cases where similar behaviour of a time series is observed in other complex systems; some other VSSs are listed and their properties are considered. </p...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} <b>traffic</b> <b>transfer</b> in wireless sensor networks (WSN). In such networks, the foremost challenge {{in the design of}} data communication techniques is that the sensor's transceiver circuitry consumes the major portion of the available power. Thus, due to stringent limitations on the nodes' hardware and power resources in WSN, data transmission must be power-efficient {{in order to reduce the}} nodes' power consumption, and hence to maximize the network lifetime while satisfying the required data rate. The transmit power is itself under the influence of data rate and source-destination distance. Thanks to the dense deployment of nodes in WSN, multi-hop communication can be applied to mitigate the transmit power for sending bits of information, i. e., gathered data by the sensor nodes to the destination node (gateway) compared to single-hop scenarios. In our approach, we achieve a reasonable trade-off between power-efficiency and transmission data rate by devising cooperative communication strategies through which the network traffic (i. e. nodes' gathered information) is relayed hop-by-hop to the gateway. In such strategies, the sensor nodes serve as data originator as well as data router, and assist the data transfer from the sensors to the gateway. We develop several data transmission schemes, and we prove their capability in transmitting the data from the sensor nodes at the highest possible rates allowed by the network limitations. In particular, we consider that (i) network has linear or quasi-linear topology, (ii) nodes are equipped with half-duplex radios, implying that they cannot transmit and receive simultaneously, (iii) nodes transmit their traffic at the same average rate. We compute the average data rate corresponding to each proposed strategy. Next, we take an information-theoretic approach and derive an upper bound to the achievable rate of <b>traffic</b> <b>transfer</b> in the networks under consideration, and analyze its tightness. We show that our proposed strategies outperform the conventional multi-hop scheme, and their average achievable rate approaches the upper bound at low levels of signal to noise ratio...|$|E
