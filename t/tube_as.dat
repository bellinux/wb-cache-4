5|$|Just {{like the}} many uses of plasma, {{there are several}} means for its generation, however, one {{principle}} is common to all of them: there must be energy input to produce and sustain it. For this case, plasma is generated when an electric current is applied across a dielectric gas or fluid (an electrically non-conducting material) {{as can be seen}} in the adjacent image, which shows a discharge <b>tube</b> <b>as</b> a simple example (DC used for simplicity).|$|E
5|$|For {{infants and}} young children, orotracheal {{intubation}} {{is easier than}} the nasotracheal route. Nasotracheal intubation carries a risk of dislodgement of adenoids and nasal bleeding. Despite the greater difficulty, nasotracheal intubation route is preferable to orotracheal intubation in children undergoing intensive care and requiring prolonged intubation because this route allows a more secure fixation of the <b>tube.</b> <b>As</b> with adults, {{there are a number}} of devices specially designed for assistance with difficult tracheal intubation in children. Confirmation of proper position of the tracheal tube is accomplished as with adult patients.|$|E
5|$|The {{case is a}} tubular {{structure}} made of silk, secreted from salivary glands {{near the mouth of}} the larva, and is started soon after the egg hatches. Various reinforcements may be incorporated into its structure, the nature of the materials and design depending on the larva's genetic makeup; this means that caddifly larvae can be recognised by their cases down to family, and even genus level. The materials used include grains of sand, larger fragments of rock, bark, sticks, leaves, seeds and mollusc shells. These are neatly arranged and stuck onto the outer surface of the silken <b>tube.</b> <b>As</b> the larva grows, more material is added at the front, and the larva can turn round in the tube and trim the rear end so that it does not drag along the substrate.|$|E

25|$|Currently {{available}} scanners typically use {{charge-coupled device}} (CCD) or {{contact image sensor}} (CIS) as the image sensor, whereas older drum scanners use a photomultiplier <b>tube</b> <b>as</b> the image sensor. Early color film scanners used a halogen lamp and a three-color filter wheel, so three exposures were needed to scan a single color image. Due to heating problems, the worst of them being the potential destruction of the scanned film, this technology was later replaced by non-heating light sources such as color LEDs.|$|E
25|$|There are no {{comparable}} La Tène style hollow torcs {{known from}} Ireland, although somewhat similar examples {{such as the}} Snettisham Torc are known from Britain in this period.

This {{was done in the}} first study of the hoard by Arthur Evans and his drawing can be seen here. The design matches other Irish pieces, and may have been a remodelling of a plainer British or Rhineland torc (the Rhineland is one possible source of the gold).|$|E

25|$|Difficulty in chewing and {{swallowing}} makes eating {{very difficult}} and {{increases the risk of}} choking or of aspirating food into the lungs. In later stages of the disorder, aspiration pneumonia can develop, and maintaining a healthy weight can become a significant problem that may require the insertion of a feeding <b>tube.</b> <b>As</b> the diaphragm and intercostal muscles of the rib cage that support breathing weaken, measures of lung function such as vital capacity and inspiratory pressure diminish. In respiratory-onset ALS, this may occur before significant limb weakness is apparent. Most people with ALS die of respiratory failure or pneumonia.|$|E
25|$|Inquiries {{that began}} with the Geissler tube {{continued}} as even better vacuums were produced. The most famous was the evacuated tube used for scientific research by William Crookes. That tube was evacuated by the highly effective mercury vacuum pump created by Hermann Sprengel. Research conducted by Crookes and others ultimately led to the discovery of the electron in 1897 by J. J. Thomson and X-rays in 1895 by Wilhelm Roentgen. But the Crookes <b>tube,</b> <b>as</b> it came to be known, produced little light because the vacuum in it was too good and thus lacked the trace amounts of gas that are needed for electrically stimulated luminescence.|$|E
25|$|A plasma is {{electrically}} conductive, and {{is subject}} to electric and magnetic fields. In a magnetic field, the electrons and nuclei orbit the magnetic field lines, confining them to the area defined by the field. A simple confinement system is a plasma-filled tube placed inside the open core of a solenoid. The plasma naturally tends to expand outwards to {{the walls of the}} <b>tube,</b> <b>as</b> well as move along it, towards the ends. The solenoid creates a magnetic field running down the centre of the tube, and prevents the plasma particles moving towards the sides. Unfortunately, this arrangement would not confine the plasma {{along the length of the}} tube, and the plasma would be free to flow out the ends.|$|E

25|$|Originally, the gauze was heated with a Bunsen burner; later, a wire grid was heated electrically. The heat {{transferred}} to {{the air in the}} tube sets it into near half-wave resonance if the gauze is placed below the midpoint of the <b>tube</b> <b>as</b> shown in the figure on the right. There is no theoretically optimum position, as the wave speed upward is c0+u, the convection speed, while the wave speed downward is c0−u. Without a convection flow, the midpoint and the lower tube end are the best locations for heat transfer. With convection, a compromise position halfway between the two points is normally chosen which depends on the amount of heat added. One characteristic length associated with frequency is tube length L.|$|E
25|$|Chamaenerion {{species are}} upright {{herbaceous}} perennials with either unbranched stems or, much less often, slightly branched stems. They either have a woody base or grow from rhizomes. The leaves are generally spirally arranged on the stems {{and are usually}} narrow, rarely ovate. The inflorescence is a simple or slightly branched raceme. Individual flowers have four petals that are rose-purple to pink, rarely white. The petals are free at the base rather than united in a floral <b>tube,</b> <b>as</b> in Epilobium. The lower petals are narrower than the upper ones, making the flower radially unsymmetric (zygomorphic). There are eight more-or-less equally sized stamens, and a long, four-lobed style. The fruit is a long, thin, four-chambered (loculicidal) capsule that splits to reveal the many seeds. The seeds have a tuft of hairs at one end.|$|E
25|$|Baird also {{demonstrated}} {{the use of}} the two-color <b>tube</b> <b>as</b> the basis for stereoscopic 3D television. In this use, the two color-filtered television cameras were separated to produce a measurable angle, and then broadcast normally. Viewers wore colored glasses to re-separate the images into the left and right eye, in a fashion identical to Anaglyph 3D movies. However, Baird also described a system using the ridged tube that eliminated the need for glasses. In this case the tube was rotated so the peaks ran vertically instead of horizontally and the red gun was removed. The guns formerly used for green and blue were now used for left and right images. The basic concept is identical to the lenticular printing system used on magazines and other printed materials to produce 3D images.|$|E

50|$|In {{spite of}} the BBC’s lukewarm {{reception}} of the experimental camera EMI persisted with the 4-tube concept, but now using Plumbicon <b>tubes,</b> <b>as</b> suggested by Wood although there was some delay before the work started. There were several reasons for the delay. Firstly, EMI’s board hesitated to provide the financial investment needed for the project. Secondly, there was indecision regarding where to place the work but, eventually, the Colour TV Department of the Research Labs. was chosen in preference to the Broadcast Equipment Division (the existing supplier of EMI's monochrome cameras and studio equipment). Thirdly, there was concern regarding the reliability of supply of Plumbicon <b>tubes,</b> <b>as</b> Philips was the only supplier. Fourthly, there were concerns regarding the variable quality standards of the early Plumbicon pick-up <b>tubes,</b> <b>as</b> some <b>tubes</b> were found to produce unstable pictures. Although most issues with tube quality were quickly resolved by Philips, there remained concerns regarding 'comet tails' and 'blooming'.|$|R
