5|$|After {{this the}} commandos came up against {{part of the}} Siegfried Line defences around Roermond. A short halt {{followed}} and during this time No. 6 Commando sent {{out a number of}} patrols mounted on <b>the</b> <b>tanks</b> of the 8th Hussars. In February, the snow thawed and the ground turned to mud which rendered <b>the</b> <b>tanks</b> useless and as a result the commandos carried out their patrols on foot.|$|E
5|$|Because of the ship's high profile, {{there were}} {{concerns}} about her stability {{in bad weather}} as she had {{a significant amount of}} weight mounted high in the ship; notably her catapults, cranes and anti-aircraft guns. To increase her stability, two lateral tanks were fitted with a pressurized butterfly valve connecting them so that water could flow between <b>the</b> <b>tanks</b> to counter her rolling motion. On trials in 1933, the system was judged successful as it deadened the ship's roll by 37-65%. However, maintenance of the system proved to be problematic as <b>the</b> <b>tanks</b> were difficult to access.|$|E
50|$|Depending on {{the size}} of the shell fired and chance, a shot may damage <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> to <b>the</b> point that the crew will abandon <b>the</b> <b>tank.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>tank's</b> hull has not been destroyed, <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> owner or <b>the</b> enemy may be able to repair <b>the</b> <b>tank.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{emergency}} {{pressure relief}} valve in <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> is called a hydrostatic {{pressure relief valve}}. It is designed to open if the pressure in <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> is dangerously high, thus releasing some vapour to the atmosphere to reduce the pressure in <b>the</b> <b>tank.</b> <b>The</b> release of a small quantity of vapour reduces the pressure in <b>the</b> <b>tank,</b> which causes some of the liquid in <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> to vaporise to re-establish equilibrium between liquid and vapour. The latent heat of vaporisation causes <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> to cool, which reduces pressure even further.|$|R

5|$|Fuel {{was carried}} in 14 bag tanks, {{four in the}} centre {{fuselage}} above and {{to the rear of}} the nosewheel bay and five in each outer wing. <b>The</b> <b>tanks</b> were split into four groups of almost equal capacity, each normally feeding its respective engine though cross-feeding was possible. The centre of gravity was automatically maintained by electric timers which sequenced the booster pumps on <b>the</b> <b>tanks.</b> B.2 aircraft could be fitted with one or two additional fuel tanks in the bomb-bay.|$|E
5|$|In August 1918, he {{was placed}} {{in charge of the}} U.S. 1st Provisional Tank Brigade (re-designated the 304th Tank Brigade on November 6, 1918). Patton's Light Tank Brigade was part of Colonel Samuel Rockenbach's Tank Corps, part of the American First Army. Personally {{overseeing}} the logistics of <b>the</b> <b>tanks</b> in their first combat use by U.S. forces, and reconnoitering the target area for their first attack himself, Patton ordered that no U.S. tank be surrendered. Patton commanded American-crewed Renault FT tanks at the Battle of Saint-Mihiel, leading <b>the</b> <b>tanks</b> from the front for much of their attack, which began on September 12. He walked in front of <b>the</b> <b>tanks</b> into the German-held village of Essey, and rode on top of a tank during the attack into Pannes, seeking to inspire his men.|$|E

25|$|There are {{a number}} of types of tank locomotive, based on the {{location}} and style of <b>the</b> water <b>tanks.</b> These include <b>the</b> side <b>tank,</b> <b>the</b> saddle <b>tank,</b> <b>the</b> pannier <b>tank,</b> <b>the</b> well <b>tank</b> and others.|$|R
50|$|One {{additional}} {{innovation is}} <b>the</b> way <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> enters and exits <b>the</b> battlefield. <b>The</b> <b>tank</b> is airdropped from above. But instead of <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> falling {{down from the}} sky, the battlefield appeared to come up towards <b>the</b> <b>tank.</b> When a stage was cleared, <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> would raise above the surface and then drop through a hatch in the ground. These methods of entering and leaving the levels, reinforce the player-tank-centric approach of the game.|$|R

5|$|The {{division}} used approximately 20 Tetrarchs {{during the}} British airborne landings in Normandy in June 1944. <b>The</b> <b>tanks</b> were successfully landed by glider, {{but they did}} not perform well. Several were lost in accidents, and those that did see action proved to be inferior in firepower and armour to the armoured fighting vehicles of the German forces. A few days after the beginning of the operation, <b>the</b> <b>tanks</b> were removed from direct engagement with German armour and used only to provide fire support. By August 1944, most of the Tetrarchs in action were replaced with Cromwell cruiser tanks, and the remainder were replaced by the M22 Locust in December 1944.|$|E
5|$|Air pollution, lack {{of proper}} waste {{management}} infrastructure and degradation of water bodies {{are the major}} environmental issues in Coimbatore. There is a sewage treatment plant at Ukkadam with the capacity to process 70 million litres of sewage water per day. Garbage is collected by the corporation and sewage is pumped into the water tanks and the Noyyal river through streams. This along with garbage dumping and encroachments has led to degradation of the water bodies and depletion in the groundwater table. <b>The</b> <b>tanks</b> are renovated by the city's environmental groups with their own fund-raising and the corporation. The corporation is responsible and involved in clearing encroachment of <b>the</b> <b>tanks.</b> Siruthuli, an environmental organisation founded by the city's industrial houses, undertakes de-silting of tanks and cleaning of the Noyyal river. Environment Conservation Group based {{out of the city}} is also involved in conservation of trees and wetlands, monitoring wildlife crime and conducting awareness sessions for students.|$|E
5|$|Apollo 11 {{landed with}} less fuel than other missions, and the astronauts {{encountered}} a premature low fuel warning. This was later {{found to be}} the result of greater propellant 'slosh' than expected, uncovering a fuel sensor. On subsequent missions, extra anti-slosh baffles were added to <b>the</b> <b>tanks</b> to prevent this.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tank</b> {{was based}} on the T-80's chassis, using a new turret, and was armed with a 152.4 mm rifled gun. In September 1990 <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> was {{completed}} and in 1991 underwent trials. The trials showed high stability and reliability of the gun and <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> itself. However, <b>the</b> absence of funding discontinued further work on <b>the</b> <b>tank's</b> improvement.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tank</b> is {{supported}} around its circumference by the equatorial ring which {{is supported}} by a large circular skirt which takes the weight of <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> down to <b>the</b> ships structure. This skirt allows <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> to expand and contract during cool-down and warm-up operations. During cool-down or warm-up <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> can expand or contract about 60 cm. Because of this expansion and contraction all piping into <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> comes in <b>the</b> top and is connected to the ships lines via flexible bellows.|$|R
25|$|Once in <b>the</b> <b>tank,</b> <b>the</b> wider cross {{sectional}} area of <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> reduces <b>the</b> downward superficial velocity of the mixture, allowing mineral-laden bubbles to disengage from the liquid and rise to the surface as they would in a conventional cell, where they form the froth. The velocity of the mixture discharging into <b>the</b> <b>tank,</b> and <b>the</b> large density differential {{between it and the}} remainder of the pulp in <b>the</b> <b>tank,</b> results in recirculating fluid patterns that keep the particles in <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> in suspension without requiring mechanical agitation.|$|R
5|$|At 22:30 the fog {{lifted and}} Kouma {{saw that a}} North Korean pontoon bridge was being laid across the river {{directly}} in front of his position. Kouma's four vehicles attacked this structure, and after about a minute of heavy fire the bridge collapsed, and the ponton boats used to hold the bridge in place were sunk. At 23:00 a small arms fight flared around the left side of A Company north of <b>the</b> <b>tanks.</b> This gunfire had lasted only two or three minutes when the A Company roadblock squads near <b>the</b> <b>tanks</b> received word by field telephone that the company was withdrawing to the original ridge positions and that they should do likewise.|$|E
5|$|Barkas and Ayrton {{went out}} onto the beach dunes to sit and think. Barkas {{recalled}} the sacked Jasper Maskelyne, a stage magician who had briefly worked for him, saying he needed his vanishing tricks now. Ayrton agreed, suggesting they use Sunshields to make <b>the</b> <b>tanks</b> seem to be trucks, and vice versa. By {{the end of that}} afternoon they had typed up a plan and presented it to de Guingand and Richardson. They proposed to create two dummy armoured brigades to deploy in the south. They would give the appearance of not being ready by making it seem <b>the</b> <b>tanks</b> had not moved from their forming-up areas (Murrayfield and Melting Pot). Dummy tanks would replace them there; while they would mimic trucks when they arrived in the forward Martello area.|$|E
5|$|Check's 1st Battalion was not {{attacked}} until 06:30 on July 24, {{shortly after}} daybreak {{in a heavy}} fog that allowed the North Koreans to approach {{very close to the}} US positions before they were observed. Two US infantry companies {{on either side of the}} road on low ridges held the forward positions. North Korean mortar fire fell on the men there, and then T-34 tanks appeared at the bend in the road and opened fire with their main cannons and machine guns as they approached. North Korean infantry followed <b>the</b> <b>tanks.</b> Although the two rifle companies stopped the North Korean infantry, <b>the</b> <b>tanks</b> penetrated their positions and fired into the battalion command post which was behind B Company. This tank fire destroyed several vehicles and killed the medical officer. A company commander knocked out one tank but was injured in the process.|$|E

5|$|Forty {{tanks of}} the 1st Brigade {{were to be}} used in the attack on the Third Army front, eight with XVIII Corps and sixteen each in VII Corps and VI Corps. When the blue line had been reached, four of the VII Corps tanks were to join VI Corps for its attack on the brown line. The black line (first objective) was not to be {{attacked}} by tanks, which were to begin the drive to the front line at zero-hour and rendezvous with infantry at the black line two hours later. <b>The</b> <b>tanks</b> were reserved for the most difficult objectives beyond the black line in groups of up to ten vehicles. Four tanks were to attack Neuville Vitasse, four against Telegraph Hill, four against The Harp and another four against Tilloy lez Mofflaines and two were to drive down the slope from Roclincourt west of Bois de la Maison Blanche. Once the blue line had fallen, <b>the</b> <b>tanks</b> still running were to drive to rally points.|$|E
5|$|Homarus gammarus is {{susceptible}} to the disease gaffkaemia, caused by the bacterium Aerococcus viridans.

5|$|However, the Germans {{launched}} a counterattack at 03:15 on 16 December, throwing in {{men from the}} 6th Parachute Regiment, sent by Herr to the 26th Panzer Division to relieve the exhausted 9th Panzergrenadier Regiment. These troops had arrived late that evening after a long journey. Supported by tanks, they attacked the right-hand New Zealand positions held by the 21st NZ Battalion, but were held off and had retired by daylight. Meanwhile, even before the German counterattack had been repelled, the 20th Regiment had attacked toward Orsogna with two squadrons of Sherman tanks. Under intense artillery and anti-tank fire, <b>the</b> <b>tanks</b> and infantry became separated and <b>the</b> <b>tanks</b> became a target rather than a threat.|$|E
5000|$|First {{restoration}} to <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> {{is done by}} King Parakramabahu I in the 12th century. <b>The</b> <b>tank</b> was renovated {{several times}} in the past as in the period of British Governor Sir William Henry Gregory (1872-1877 [...] and Sir Arthur Hamilton-Gordon (1883-1890). After the British rule in the country and in 1958, <b>the</b> <b>tank’s</b> bund was reconstructed connecting <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> with Balalu Wewa.|$|R
50|$|Direct {{expansion}} cooling cannot {{run when}} <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> is empty or the inside walls of <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> would freeze. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> is rapidly cooled as warm milk first enters <b>the</b> <b>tank,</b> and then <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> is cooled slowly just {{to maintain a}} low storage temperature. The rapid cooling during milking requires very large refrigeration compressors and condenser radiators to quickly expel heat from the milk, and is better suited for very large farming operations where three-phase electric power is available to operate the high-power cooling system.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{closure of}} the valve, the fluid {{continues}} to flow, passing into <b>the</b> surge <b>tank</b> causing <b>the</b> water level in <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> to rise. <b>The</b> level in <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> will continue to rise until the additional head due to the height of fluid in <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> balances <b>the</b> surge pressure in the pipeline. At this point the flow in <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> and pipeline will reverse causing the level in <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> to drop. This oscillation in tank height and flow will continue for some time but its magnitude will dissipate due {{to the effects of}} friction.|$|R
5|$|In 1917, {{during the}} battle of Cambrai, the Tank Corps adopted new tactics. Three tanks working {{together}} would advance in a triangle formation, with the two rear tanks providing cover for an infantry platoon. <b>The</b> <b>tanks</b> were to create gaps in the barbed wire for the accompanying infantry to pass through, then use their armament to suppress the German strong points. The effectiveness of tank–infantry co-operation was demonstrated {{during the battle}}, when Major General George Montague Harper of the 51st (Highland) Division refused to co-operate with <b>the</b> <b>tanks,</b> a decision that compelled them to move forward without any infantry support; the result was the destruction of more than 12 tanks by German artillery sighted behind bunkers.|$|E
5|$|In October 1944 {{however, the}} {{remaining}} Tetrarchs of the regiment {{were replaced by}} Locusts and eight were used during Operation Varsity in March 1945. <b>The</b> <b>tanks</b> did not perform well in action; several were damaged during the landing process and one was knocked out by a German self-propelled gun. Only two Locusts were able to reach their planned rendezvous point and go into action, occupying a piece of high ground along with an infantry company. <b>The</b> <b>tanks</b> were forced {{to withdraw from the}} position after several hours however, because they attracted artillery fire that caused the infantry to suffer heavy casualties. The Locust never saw active service with the British Army again and was classified as obsolete in 1946. A number of Locusts were used by foreign militaries in the post-war period however; the Belgian Army used Locusts as command tanks for their M4 Sherman tank regiments, and the Egyptian Army used several company-sized units of Locusts during the 1948 Arab–Israeli War.|$|E
5|$|Japanese light tanks, {{which had}} good buoyancy, were towed across the straits to Lim Chu Kang Road where {{they joined the}} battle at dusk. With {{reinforced}} troops and tanks advancing down Choa Chua Kang Road, the Australian troops were no match for <b>the</b> <b>tanks</b> and fled to the hills of Bukit Panjang. The 5th Division (Imperial Japanese Army) captured Bukit Timah village by the evening of 11 February.|$|E
50|$|ICS or batch {{collectors}} {{reduce heat}} loss by thermally insulating <b>the</b> <b>tank.</b> This {{is achieved by}} encasing <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> in a glass-topped box that allows heat from the sun to reach <b>the</b> water <b>tank.</b> <b>The</b> other walls of the box are thermally insulated, reducing convection and radiation. The box can also have a reflective surface on the inside. This reflects heat lost from <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> back towards <b>the</b> <b>tank.</b> In a simple way one could consider an ICS solar water heater as a water tank that has been enclosed in a type of 'oven' that retains heat from the sun as well as heat {{of the water in}} <b>the</b> <b>tank.</b> Using a box does not eliminate heat loss from <b>the</b> <b>tank</b> to <b>the</b> environment, but it largely reduces this loss.|$|R
