25|$|The mixed oak {{woodland}} habitat {{dominates the}} lower elevations with coast live oak, Douglas fir, California buckeye and bigleaf maple forming {{the majority of}} the canopy. The understory is sparse, particularly of the deep ravine areas such as Hood Creek riparian zones. Some toyon, poison oak and hollyleaf cherry are found beneath the canopy. At mid-level elevations there are also considerable numbers of <b>tanbark</b> oak and Pacific madrone contributing to the canopy.|$|E
25|$|Headwaters rise on {{the west}} facing slopes of the inner coast {{southern}} Mayacamas Mountains, where the highest peaks are Hood Mountain, elevation 2750feet (833m) and Bald Mountain, elevation 2729feet (826 m), {{each of which has}} views of the Pacific Ocean and the Sierra Nevada range. The headwaters cut through gorge and meadow of Sugarloaf Ridge State Park, which boasts 25miles (40kilometers) of self-guided trails and the Robert Ferguson Observatory. There is also a 25foot (eight meter) high waterfall, present only when fed by the winter rains but can persist until late May for high rainfall years such as 2006. In the 100 foot (30m) deep gorge into which the waterfall spills is a moist mixed forest habitat including California bay laurel, coast redwood, Douglas fir, big leaf maple, cherry holly, coffeeberry, and even <b>tanbark</b> oak. The understory features abundant ferns and boulder laden mosses. A prominent landform in this upper reach created by Sonoma Creek is Adobe Canyon. Locally part of this upper reach flow is sometimes called Adobe Creek. Tributaries near the headwaters include Mount Hood Creek and Graywood Creek.|$|E

25|$|This {{results in}} the boreal forest at higher {{elevations}} on the mountain having a notably higher proportion of paper birch and red spruce to balsam fir compared to Slide and other major Catskill peaks. These pioneering species are often found in areas regenerating themselves (red spruce is also found as an associate to hemlocks at lower elevations near Stony Clove Notch, reflecting the extensive <b>tanbarking</b> there).|$|R
50|$|The {{area was}} used by the Mahican and Esopus Indians {{primarily}} for hunting. Later it was heavily exploited by the Dutch, English, Irish and Germans; local industry included logging, bluestone quarrying, leather tanning, wintergreen and blueberry harvesting, trapping, fishing, and later, tourism. The old-growth hemlock and northern hardwood forests on the steep mountainsides and remote valleys were sufficiently inaccessible that they survived the logging, <b>tanbarking</b> and charcoal industries of the 18th and 19th centuries.|$|R
500|$|Rubroboletus pulcherrimus {{is found}} in western North America, from New Mexico and California to Washington, and may feasibly occur in British Columbia, Canada.

500|$|Tanning in Cullompton {{goes back}} to at least the sixteenth century and {{in the nineteenth century}} there were three tanneries: Crow Green, Lower King's Mill and Court Tannery. The tannery at Higher King's Mill was active between about 1830 and 1875 and {{employed}} 12 labourers in 1851 and 9 a decade later. Court Tannery was established by 1871 and had closed by 1906. It was located {{at the north end of}} the town behind Court House, which was the residence of the owners of the tannery. In 1871 it employed 21 men and was probably steam-powered. [...] A local tanner, James Whitby, along with George Bodley and John Davis patented an improved bark mill (used to grind bark for producing <b>tanbark</b> used in the tanning process).|$|E
500|$|With the {{exception}} of rocky alpine regions in the highest mountains, the Trinity River watershed is almost entirely forested. Mixed coniferous (fir and pine) forests dominate the landscape at elevations of up to [...] Common tree species include ponderosa pine, Jeffrey pine, Douglas fir, white fir, red fir, sugar pine, knobcone pine and incense cedar. The watershed also includes some hardwood forests, typically located along canyon bottoms and streams, which are home to black oak, madrone, <b>tanbark</b> oak, canyon live oak and bigleaf maple. Stands of Port Orford cedar are common along the upper Trinity River; Oregon white oak is widespread throughout lower elevations. There are also {{a small number of}} redwoods growing along the South Fork. Fir forests comprise almost 74percent of the forests in the Trinity River watershed; pine and hardwoods account for 13percent each. There are also limited amounts of chaparral, brush and grass/rangeland within the basin. Wildfires are common in the dry summers which receive little to no precipitation, aside from the occasional high elevation thunderstorm.|$|E
40|$|Filipinos {{whose main}} daily diet {{consists}} {{of fish and}} rice, are highly dependent on the coastal resources. The development of coastal resources in the Philippines has been traditionally exploitative in nature. Government policies, which dictated development in both the uplands and coastal areas, have been based mainly on abundant available resources without due consideration for sustainability. In the 1950 s, vast tracts of mangroves were awarded to concessionaires and logged over for firewood and <b>tanbarks.</b> Mangrove woods were the preferred fuel source in coastal villages and most bakeries because of its high heating value, but a greater volume was exported to Japan as firewood but reportedly became the source of rayon. In the 1960 s, the government adopted a policy aimed at increasing fish production by converting large areas of mangroves into fishponds for the culture of milkfish (Chanos chanos) and shrimps. Such policy was promoted by a government program, which classified mangrove timberland for fishpond development and opened loan windows in most government banks to finance fishpond development. It was only {{towards the end of}} the 1970 s when the government realized the fishery value of mangroves. A National Mangrove Committee was formed in the then Ministry of Natural Resources, and a Mangrove Forest Research Center was created under the Forest Research Institute of the Philippines. The former was charged with the formulation of policies/recommendations for the conservation and sustainable management of the remaining mangrove forests in the country, while the latter worked for the generation of technology for the rehabilitation, production and sustainable management of mangroves. Not surprisingly, this â€œdecade of awakeningâ€� was also significantly marked with an alarming decline in fish catch. The government then opened loans to fisherfolk for the purchase of motorized boats and improved fishing gear. The program ended with most fishers unable to payback their loans as their fish harvests and income continued to decline. The 1980 s and 1990 s were marked with significant efforts to rehabilitate destroyed mangroves and related coastal resources. In 1981, small islands indented by mangroves containing an aggregate area of 4, 326 hectares were declared Wilderness Areas under Presidential Proclamation No. 2151. Also in the same year, Presidential Proclamation No. 2152 was issued declaring the entire island of Palawan and some parcels of mangroves in the country containing an aggregate area of 74, 267 hectares as Mangrove Swamp Forest Reserves. In 1987, the Mangrove Forest Research Center was expanded to become nationwide in scope under the Freshwater and Coastal Ecosystems Section of the Ecosystems Research and Development Service of every regional office of the present Department of Environment and Natural Resources. Not long after, the Coastal Environment Program (CEP) and the Coastal Resource Management Project (CRMP) were launched in the regional offices of DENR in 1993 and in 1996, respectively. These programs promote community-based approaches to coastal resource management, making direct stakeholders partners of government in the sustainable development and management of mangroves, seagrass beds, coral reefs, and other coastal resources...|$|R
2500|$|<b>Tanbark</b> {{was used}} to {{manufacture}} tannic acid, necessary to the growing leather tanning industry located in Santa Cruz, and to preserve fish nets. The <b>tanbark</b> was harvested from the isolated trees inland, left to dry, corded, and brought out on mules or hauled out on [...] "go-devils". The go-devil was a wagon with two wheels on the front, while the rear had rails for pulling. Notley constructed a landing {{at the mouth of}} the Palo Colorado River like that at Bixby Landing to the south. The <b>tanbark</b> was loaded by cable onto waiting vessels anchored offshore at Notley's Landing. In 1889, as much as 50,000 cords of <b>tanbark</b> were hauled out from the Little Sur River and Big Sur River watersheds. A small village grew up around Notley's Landing from 1898 to 1907. [...] Near the start of the 20th century, the tan oak trees were becoming seriously depleted, which slowly led to the demise of the industries they had created.|$|E

2500|$|In 1916, the Eberhard and Kron Tanning Company of Santa Cruz {{purchased}} most of {{the remaining}} land from the original homesteaders. They brought <b>tanbark</b> timber out on mules and crude wooden sleds known as [...] "go-devils" [...] to Notleys Landing at the mouth of Palo Colorado Canyon, where it was loaded via cable onto ships anchored offshore. William Randolph Hearst was interested in preserving the uncut, abundant redwood forest, and on November 18, 1921, he purchased the land from the tanning company for about $50,000.|$|E
2500|$|Along with {{industries}} {{based on}} tanoak bark harvesting, gold mining, and limestone processing, {{the local economy}} provided more jobs and supported a larger population than it does today. From the 1860s through {{the start of the}} twentieth century, lumbermen cut down most of the readily accessible coast redwoods. Redwood harvesting further inland was always limited by the rugged terrain and difficulty in transporting the lumber to market. Pioneer William F. Notley {{was one of the first}} to harvest the bark of the <b>Tanbark</b> Oak from the Little Sur River canyon.|$|E

60|$|This was the {{inundation}} of the tan-bark {{with troops}} of pretty Shetland ponies of all ages, sizes, and colors.

It was no longer a solemnity of fashion, it was a sweet and kindly pleasure which every one could share, or every one who had ever had, or ever wished to have, a Shetland pony; the touch of nature made the whole show kin. I could not see that the freakish, kittenish creatures did anything to claim our admiration, but they won our affection by every trait of ponyish caprice and obstinacy. The small colts broke away from the small mares, and gambolled over the <b>tanbark</b> in wanton groups, with gay or plaintive whinnyings, which might well have touched a responsive chord in the bosom of fashion itself: I dare say it is not so hard as it looks. The scene remanded us to a moment of childhood; and I found myself so fond of all the ponies that I felt it invidious of the judges to choose among them for the prizes; they ought every one to have had the prize.|$|E
