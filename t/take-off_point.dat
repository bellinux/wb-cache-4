25|$|Vollenhoven {{hoped to}} publish a multi-volume history of philosophy, in {{cooperation}} {{with two of his}} former students, S. U. Zuidema and K. J. Popma. Many course notes had become syllabi between 1926 and 1948. In 1950 the first volume of the History of Philosophy appeared, covering the period of ancient philosophy prior to Plato and Aristotle. At first the work was well received. But despite its 600 pages, the book remained a grand torso. Several philosophers convened (H.J. Pos, Willem Jacob Verdenius, D. Loenen, Ms. C.J. de Vogel) to respond and together they aggressively criticized the book, particularly seizing on its ontological <b>take-off</b> <b>point</b> and problem-historical method. They also successfully advised against the federal funding of the second volume of this project. Vollenhoven was forced to seek other means. He was able to publish his problem-historical results in the philosophy articles he wrote for the Oosthoek encyclopedia, in its 4th and 5th editions.|$|E
500|$|Another {{attempt to}} deliver the Albacores and more Spitfires was made during Operation LB. As usual, Argus {{provided}} the air cover with a dozen Fulmars from 807 Squadron and Eagle ferried the Albacores and 17 Spitfires to their <b>take-off</b> <b>point</b> for Malta on 19 May. The Spitfires were flown off successfully, but the engines of the Albacores all began to overheat and {{they were forced to}} return to the carrier. Examination of the aircraft revealed that their air coolers had been set to [...] "Winter" [...] rather than [...] "Summer". One of the Fulmars was shot down by Vichy French Dewoitine D.520 fighters as it attempted to protect the crew of a Consolidated PBY Catalina flying boat that had been shot down earlier. By this time the ship's Vickers [...]50-calibre machine guns had been replaced by 13 Oerlikon 20mm light anti-aircraft guns.|$|E
500|$|Furious {{now had a}} new {{destination}} for her ferry trips and she transported 24 Hurricanes to Gibraltar on 25 April where they were transferred to [...] to be flown off for Malta. She sailed for a brief refit at Belfast immediately afterwards. While in Belfast she was hit by one small bomb and near-missed by two others during a German air raid in early May, but was only lightly damaged. The ship loaded another batch of 40 Hurricane IIs, plus nine Fulmars from 'X' Flight of 800 Squadron in Liverpool, and arrived back in Gibraltar on 18 May. Some of these fighters were moved to Ark Royal via planks between the flight decks of the carriers berthed stern to stern. This time she accompanied Ark Royal and the two carriers flew off their fighters from a position south of Sardinia. Furious loaded 48 more Hurricane IIs and arrived back in Gibraltar on 1 June {{where some of the}} fighters were transferred to Ark Royal. The two carriers departed Gibraltar on 4 June and flew off 44 of the 48 fighters. Furious returned to the Clyde for her biggest load of aircraft yet, 64 Hurricanes, leaving room for only nine Swordfish from 816 Squadron on this voyage. Upon her arrival on 25 June she transferred 22 Hurricanes to Ark Royal and that carrier flew them off to Malta the next day. Of the 42 Hurricanes left on Furious, 26 were moved to Ark Royal when she returned on 28 June. This time, however, both carriers sailed to deliver the fighters to their usual <b>take-off</b> <b>point</b> west of Sicily. The tenth of Furiouss aircraft to take off crashed into her island, killing 14 men and starting a serious fire on the flight deck. The blocked flight deck forced the remaining six Hurricanes to remain on board and they were returned to Gibraltar. Furious exchanged 816 Squadron for 818 from Ark Royal, then departed for home.|$|E
50|$|Another {{feature is}} that Collet d'Allevard {{is a first}} class {{paragliding}} site especially with its four official <b>take-off</b> <b>points</b> (Malatrait, Clos des Gentianes, Prérond, and Plagnes) each with different orientation.|$|R
5000|$|... "The Big Dipper" [...] is a 15 ft-deep cut in {{the ground}} which {{is used as a}} kind of half-pipe. From the top of the slope, riders can aim at a variety of <b>take-off</b> <b>points</b> on the other side, each of which {{provides}} differing amounts of [...] "air time".|$|R
5000|$|Kirkus Reviews {{praised the}} novel in 1962, commenting that the novel's [...] "well-drawn battle {{narrative}} provides <b>take-off</b> <b>points</b> {{for dozens of}} character studies, and the author describes emotional responses to battle, fear, death, homosexuality, along with detached, ironic comments on army organization and the workings of fate, luck and circumstance".|$|R
2500|$|A team of {{volunteer}} enthusiasts built a full-sized replica of British Army Aeroplane No 1 {{to commemorate the}} 100th anniversary of the first flight. It is on permanent display at the Farnborough Air Sciences Trust Museum in Farnborough. [...] The display is about three hundred metres from the <b>take-off</b> <b>point</b> of the historic flight.|$|E
2500|$|... "The real {{difficulty}} of the stunt lay not in the leap itself, since she had practiced this with the train stationary and it clearly presented no difficulties, but in the timing. What such stunts require is an inbuilt awareness {{of the speed of}} the moving object. During the course of a leap where a moving object is concerned, the spatial relationship between <b>take-off</b> <b>point</b> and landing point changes. It is quite possible to imagine a leap from a static <b>take-off</b> <b>point</b> on to the roof of a moving train in which the stuntman aims to land halfway along a carriage roof yet in fact-because of the speed of the train-lands in the gap between two carriages. It seems that in such a leap the safest place to aim at is the gap itself At least in that way one can guarantee to miss it. Helen Gibson had this sensitivity to spatial relationships between objects in motion, but it is certainly not a gift shared by all stuntmen." [...] Arthur Wise from Stunting In the Cinema, 1973.|$|E
50|$|When {{the runner}} makes the {{hand-off}} to the team’s paraglider, he must also run, {{this time with}} his whole equipment to the first <b>take-off</b> <b>point.</b> After descending by air to Moosalm, the paraglider runs to a second <b>take-off</b> <b>point,</b> descending to Leisach where the mountain biker is ready and waiting.|$|E
5000|$|Visually {{impaired}} athletes {{participate in}} running events {{with the help}} of a sighted guide, to whom they may be attached by a tether. Sound-emitting devices or a sighted [...] "caller" [...] are used to indicate target areas for throwing events, <b>take-off</b> <b>points</b> for jumping events, and other important locations for visually impaired competitors.|$|R
50|$|At lakes, fish ponds or gravel pits in the area, water <b>take-off</b> <b>points</b> were installed. In {{particularly}} endangered areas, special ponds were dug {{in order}} to provide rapid and efficient water collection by fire engines. Where there are no rivers for water collection, old heating oil tanks were used as water supply tanks each with between 20,000 and 100,000 litres of water in the ground.|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} be better {{equipped}} for future forest fires, metalled tracks were built exclusively for fire engines. At lakes, fish ponds or gravel pits in the area, water <b>take-off</b> <b>points</b> were installed. In addition new water storage ponds for firefighting {{were built in the}} Südheide. Where there are no rivers for water collection, old heating oil tanks were used as water supply tanks, each with between 20,000 and 100,000 litres of water in the ground.|$|R
50|$|The Jakobshorn {{is also a}} favoured <b>take-off</b> <b>point</b> for {{hang-gliders}} and snowkiters.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to hiking the Ben is occasionally {{used as a}} <b>take-off</b> <b>point</b> for paragliding.|$|E
50|$|Sabang: Sabang is the <b>take-off</b> <b>point</b> for Salomague Island. Members of the Saint Claire, a Roman Catholic {{religious}} congregation, {{have established}} {{a place in the}} barangay facing Salomague Island.|$|E
50|$|Due to its {{location}} {{on the edge of}} the Vienna Basin and its accessibility by car, there are 3 popular <b>take-off</b> <b>points</b> on the Hohe Wand for paragliders and hang gliders. The most popular of these is the eastern one, the Oststartplatz, the most challenging and the one most used by hang gliders is the southern one, the Südstartplatz; there is also the less used Almfrieden Startplatz. The Hohe Wand is especially suitable for flying due to its south-to-east wind situations and is also the local mountain for the Viennese.|$|R
40|$|A new surface {{technique}} for the conduction {{study of the}} lower intercostal nerves has been developed and applied to 30 normal subjects. The problem of the short available nerve segment of the intercostal nerves and the bizzare compound motor action potential (CMAP) of inconsistent latency while recording over the intercostal muscles, is overcome by applying recording electrodes over the rectus abdominis muscle and stimulating the nerves at two points at a fair distance away. With {{the use of multiple}} recording sites over the rectus abdominis, the motor points for different intercostal nerves were delineated. CMAP of reproducible latencies and waveforms with sharp <b>take-off</b> <b>points</b> were obtained. Conduction velocity of the intercostal nerves could be determined...|$|R
30|$|All {{data were}} {{processed}} and analysed using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 20.0 except relative expressions for RAGE which were analysed using REST-RG© Version 3. For parametric data, one-way ANOVA {{was used to}} make comparisons between groups followed by Post Hoc (Tukey) test while for non-parametric data, Kruskal–Wallis test was used followed by Mann–Whitney U test. To analyse the relative expressions of RAGE, <b>take-off</b> <b>points</b> and PCR reaction efficiencies of each sample were imported from ‘Comparative Quantitation’ feature of Rotor-Gene Q into the REST-RG© Version 3 where the expression ratios of target (treatment group) to calibrator (control group) were calculated. For all data analyses, a p value of ≤  0.05 was considered statistically significant.|$|R
50|$|The <b>take-off</b> <b>point</b> must {{be large}} enough to lay out and inflate the {{envelope}} and clear of obstructions such as power lines and poles, trees, and buildings to allow lift-off under the predicted wind conditions. Finally, the <b>take-off</b> <b>point</b> must be situated such that the predicted winds will move the balloon in the direction of suitable landing sites. Taking off from a location that is directly up wind of a hazard, such as a large body of water, a large metropolitan area, or a large uninterrupted forest, without sufficient fuel to pass over the hazard is not safe.|$|E
50|$|Given its {{metropolitan}} location, crowds are ferocious and competitive. Given {{the fact}} that waves start to break against the rock on a good day, and that a strong rip tide along the promontory creates a quick re-entry, the <b>take-off</b> <b>point</b> is very small.|$|E
50|$|Thanks to its views, the Orensberg is {{a popular}} {{destination}} for ramblers. It is accessible via a dense network of paths and the route to the top is signed. In addition the hill is a <b>take-off</b> <b>point</b> for paragliders and a destination for mountain bikers.|$|E
50|$|The bunker {{had its own}} well. In {{the well}} chamber was a pump that pumped the water into a tank. From there water was pumped into a {{pressure}} vessel {{in order to provide}} the necessary water pressure to the taps. There were <b>take-off</b> <b>points</b> in the kitchen, the sick bay, the command post, the hallways and the washroom. The bunker only had wash basins, there were no showers, in the toilets and in the engine room. In addition to the need for drinking water, water was needed to cool the diesel generator sets and there was also an automatic sprinkler system in the ammunition store. Waste water was collected in a pit from where it was pumped to the surface by an electric pumping system activated by a float.|$|R

50|$|The {{capacity}} {{provided by}} the EH-101 is of enormous importance and is currently possible to perform rescue missions {{at a distance of}} 400 nautical miles from the <b>take-off</b> <b>point.</b> Despite the large national SAR area of responsibility, the 751 Squadron has provided SAR support to neighboring countries, performing rescue missions in both Spanish and Moroccan Search and Rescue Regions.|$|E
50|$|In August 1913 a seventy five mile air race {{around the}} Midlands was {{arranged}} between Bentfield Hucks and Hamel. The <b>take-off</b> <b>point</b> for the contest was the Tally-Ho grounds, adjacent to Cannon Hill Park. Both aviators then flew anti-clockwise around the circuit, landing at Redditch recreation ground, Coventry, Nuneaton, Tamworth and Walsall and finishing at Edgbaston. Hamel {{won the race}} {{by a margin of}} just twenty seconds.|$|E
50|$|The {{running of}} steam {{locomotives}} required water {{as well as}} coal. As a result, the water supply of a Betriebswerk played an important role. In order to guarantee the supply, almost all Bahnbetriebswerk had their own railway waterworks. These waterworks were equipped with various systems for delivering water (pumps, pipes, water containers and <b>take-off</b> <b>points).</b> Many Bahnbetriebswerke had two different waterworks: one railway waterworks that provided water for the engines and a drinking waterworks that supplied water for the employees of the depot. When Betriebswerke were eventually connected to the regional water network, their drinking waterworks was usually closed down. The water was extracted from springs, wells and ponds and then cleaned. Industrial water for the running the steam locomotives {{had to have a}} high level of quality. As a result, the railway waterworks developed their own filtering systems, where the water for operations was made usable. Especially important were the salt content and the hardness of the water.|$|R
50|$|Gate {{factor is}} a scoring {{compensation}} for variable outdoor conditions. Aerodynamics and take-off speed are important variables that determine {{the value of}} a jump, and if weather conditions change during a competition, the conditions will not be the same for all competitors. The competitor receive or lose points if the inrun (or start gate) length is adjusted to provide optimal <b>take-off</b> speed. <b>Points</b> are added when the starting gate is moved up, and withdrawn when the gate is lowered.|$|R
50|$|On 4 August 1972, Douglas DC-3 N31538 of Mercer Airlines {{suffered}} an in-flight engine fire shortly after <b>take-off</b> from NAS <b>Point</b> Mugu on a cargo flight to Hollywood-Burbank Airport. The aircraft departed the runway {{in the emergency}} landing and was destroyed by the subsequent fire. All three people on board survived.|$|R
50|$|In {{projects}} with an uncertain {{supply of water}} due to annual variations in river discharge, water users at the top (the head users) of the irrigation system (i.e. near the system's <b>take-off</b> <b>point)</b> often have preference, to a certain extent, over users at the tail-end. Hence, the number of farmers {{that are able to}} grow an irrigated crop may vary from year to year according to the riparian water rights.|$|E
50|$|Pemanggil Island (Malay: Pulau Pemanggil) is {{an island}} in Mersing District, Johor, Malaysia. It sits 45 km east of Mersing, the <b>take-off</b> <b>point</b> to most islands off the Southern coast of Peninsular Malaysia. It is {{situated}} next to Tioman, requires a 4- to 5-hour ride by boat from Mersing. To get to Mersing itself takes 4½ hours by car or roughly 6 hours by coach from Kuala Lumpur.|$|E
50|$|Before a safe hot air balloon flight can begin, {{the pilot}} must check {{the weather and}} select a {{suitable}} <b>take-off</b> <b>point.</b> The current and forecast weather must have sufficient visibility for the pilot to see and avoid obstructions (little or no fog or low clouds) and sufficiently slow winds to allow {{take off and landing}} (less than 5 or 10 mph depending on skill and experience of pilot, passengers, and ground crew).|$|E
50|$|A notable {{spin-off}} of {{this technique}} was the A-90 Orlyonok ekranoplane, which was powered in flight by a massive Kuznetsov NK-12 turboprop (by far the most powerful ever built), and required two large turbofans embedded in the nose for <b>take-off,</b> whose ducts <b>pointed</b> permanently downwards under the wings to provide PAR thrust. These engines were shut down during flight to reduce fuel consumption.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{asks what}} low-income {{countries}} can expect from growth {{in terms of}} happiness. It interprets the set of available international evidence pertaining {{to the relationship between}} income growth and subjective well-being. Consistent with the Easterlin paradox, higher income is always associated with higher happiness scores, except in one case: whether growth in national income yields higher well-being is still hotly debated. The key question is whether the correlation coefficient is "too small to matter". The explanations for the small correlation between national income growth and subjective well-being over time appeal to the nature of growth itself (from negative side-effects, such as pollution), and to the psychological importance of relative concerns and adaptation. The available evidence contains two important lessons: income comparisons do seem to affect subjective well-being, even in very poor countries; however, adaptation may be more of a rich-country phenomenon. Our stand is that the idea that growth will increase happiness in low-income countries cannot be rejected {{on the basis of the}} available evidence. First, cross-country time-series analyses are based on aggregate measures, which are less reliable than those at the individual level. Second, development is a qualitative process involving <b>take-off</b> <b>points</b> and thresholds. Such regime changes are visible to the eye through the lens of subjective satisfaction measures. The case of Transition countries is particularly impressive in this respect: average life satisfaction scores closely mirrored changes in GDP for about the first ten years of the transition process, until the regime became more stable. The greater availability of subjective measures of well-being in low-income countries would greatly help in the measurement and monitoring of the different stages and dimensions of the development process. ...|$|R
