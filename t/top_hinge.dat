50|$|The McLaren F1, Alfa Romeo 33 Stradale, Saleen S7, Enzo Ferrari and its non road-going version;the FXX, Toyota Sera/EXY-10, and the Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren, among others, use {{butterfly}} doors. It {{was also}} a common feature for Group C and IMSA GTP/Camel Lights prototype racers as they incorporate teardrop tops which allows the driver {{to get in and}} out of the car more quickly than conventional and gullwing doors, especially in a cramped pitlane environment such as the pre-1991 Le Mans circuit. Since then, butterfly doors have been an adopted design of closed top sportscar racers, such as the Toyota GT-One, Bentley Speed 8 and more recently, the Peugeot 908 HDi FAP. The Toyota Sera, made between 1990 and 1995, was a limited-release car designed exclusively for the Japanese market which used this design. The Mercedes-Benz SLR McLaren Roadster was one of the few open top cars to use butterfly wing doors. This is made possible by having the doors hinged at the side of A-pillar instead of at top by the roof. The McLaren MP4-12C has a unique system where the butterfly doors do not use a <b>top</b> <b>hinge</b> meaning that the car can use frameless windows which allows for the car's upcoming convertible version to retain them.|$|E

40|$|Purpose To {{investigate}} {{the prevalence of}} anatomical and surgical findings and complications in maxillary sinus floor elevation surgery, and to describe the clinical implications. Patients and Methods One hundred consecutive patients scheduled for maxillary sinus floor elevation were included. The patients consisted of 36 men (36 %) and 64 women (64 %), {{with a mean age}} of 50 years (range, 17 to 73 years). In 18 patients, a bilateral procedure was performed. Patients were treated with a <b>top</b> <b>hinge</b> door in the lateral maxillary sinus wall, as described by Tatum (Dent Clin North Am 30 : 207, 1986). In bilateral cases, only the first site treated was evaluated. Results In most cases, an anatomical or surgical finding forced a deviation from Tatum's standard procedure. A thin or thick lateral maxillary sinus wall was found in 78 % and 4 % of patients, respectively. In 6 %, a strong convexity of the lateral sinus wall called for an alternative method of releasing the trapdoor. The same method was used in 4 % of cases involving a narrow sinus. The sinus floor elevation procedure was hindered by septa in 48 %. In regard to complications, the most common complication, a perforation of the Schneiderian membrane, occurred in 11 % of patients. In 2 %, visualization of the trapdoor preparation was compromised because of hemorrhages. The initial incision design, ie, slightly palatal, was responsible for a local dehiscence in 3 %.

40|$|Major {{advances}} {{have been observed}} {{during the last two}} decades in the field of seismic engineering with further refinements of performance-based seismic design philosophies and the subsequent definition of corresponding compliance criteria. Following the globally recognized expectation and ideal aim to provide a modern society with high (seismic) performance structures able to sustain a design level earthquake with limited or negligible damage, alternative solutions have been developed for high-performance, seismic resisting systems. In the last two decades, an alternative approach in seismic design has been introduced for precast concrete buildings in seismic regions with the introduction of “dry” jointed ductile systems also called “hybrid” systems based on unbonded post-tensioned rocking connections. As a result structural systems with high seismic performance capabilities can be implemented, with the unique capability to undergo inelastic displacement similar to their traditional monolithic counterparts, while limiting the damage to the structural system and assuring full re-centring capabilities (negligible residual or permanent deformations). The continuous and rapid development of jointed ductile connections for seismic resisting systems has resulted in the validation {{of a wide range of}} alternative arrangements, encompassed under the general umbrella of “hybrid” systems. This research provides a comprehensive experimental and analytical investigations of 2 - and 3 -Dimensional, 2 / 3 scaled, exterior beam-column joints subjected both uni and bi-directional (four clove) quasic-static loading protocols into the behaviour, modelling, design and feasibility of new arrangements for “dry” jointed ductile systems for use in regions of high seismicity. In order to further emphasize the enhanced performance of these systems, a comparison with the experimental response and observed damage of 2 -D and 3 -D monolithic beam-column benchmark specimens is presented. However, after a lot of attention given to the behaviour of the skeleton structure, more recently the focus of research in Earthquake Engineering has concentrated on the behaviour of the floor system within the overall 3 D behaviour of the building and the effects of beam elongation. The effects of beam elongation in precast frame systems have been demonstrated to be a potential source of un-expected damage, unless adequate detailing is provided in order to account for displacement incompatibilities between the lateral resisting systems and the floor. Two contributions to beam elongation are typically recognized: a) the material contribution due to the cumulative residual strain within the steel, and b) the geometrical contribution due to the presence of a neutral axis and actual depth of the beam. Regarding jointed ductile connections with re-centering characteristics, the extent of beam elongation is significantly reduced, being limited to solely the geometrical contribution. Furthermore, such effects could be minimized when a reduced depth of the beam is adopted due to the use of internal prestressing or external post-tensioning. However, damage to precast floor systems, resulting from a geometric elongation of the beam, has yet to be addressed in detail. In order to emphasize the enhanced performance in controlling and minimizing the damage of the structural elements via the use of the proposed advanced hybrid solutions, this research presents via experimental and analytical validation of two alternative and innovative solutions to reduce the damage to the floor using 2 and 3 -Dimensional, 2 / 3 scaled, exterior beam-column joints. The first approach consists of using standard precast rocking/dissipative frame connections (herein referred to as “gapping”) in combination with an articulated or “jointed” floor. This system uses mechanical devices to connect the floor and the lateral beams which can accommodate the displacement incompatibilities in the connection. The second approach to reduce the floor damage investigates the implementation of a “non-gapping” connection, also called non-tearing-floor connection, using a <b>top</b> <b>hinge</b> at the beam-column interface, while still relying on more traditional floor-to-frame connections (i. e. topping and continuous starter bars). Additionally, further refinements and constructability issues for the non gapping connection are investigated under the experimental and analytical validation of a major 2 -Dimensional, 2 / 3 scaled, two-story one-bay frame using non-tearing floor connections. Based on the non-tearing floor connections, a series of parametric analysis for beam-column joints and frames are carried out. Furthermore, the analysis and design of two prototype frames using different solutions is presented. The frames are subjected to cyclic adaptive pushover and inelastic time history analysis in order to investigate analytically the response characteristics of hybrid frames using non-tearing connections, as well as how the beam growth affects the frame response under earthquake loading. Computational models for hybrid PRESSS frames and a conventional reinforced concrete frames are developed and compared with the ones using non-tearing connections...|$|E
