Even the word Sarah he could not pronounce at first, but had to spell it, and I would pronounce it for him.|$|E
500|$|Meyer-Landrut {{decided to}} take part in the talent show Unser Star für Oslo (Our Star for Oslo), a newly created {{national}} television programme to select the German entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2010 in Oslo. The show was organised by public broadcaster ARD and private television station ProSieben, as well as entertainer, music producer and former Eurovision entrant Stefan Raab. Among 4,500 entrants, Meyer-Landrut was picked as one of the 20 contestants for the show. Asked about her motivation to apply, she stated, [...] "I like to test myself. I wanted <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> am perceived, and I wanted to hear what people with knowledge have to say about it. I personally can't judge myself at all." ...|$|E
500|$|Hoffman {{explained}} {{the key to}} his changeup was how he pinched the seam of the ball with his thumb and index finger as he released it. He threw the changeup with the arm speed used to throw a fastball, and the spin and movement of the ball looked the same to the batter. His changeup ranged from 73–76mph. Bruce Bochy, who managed Hoffman for over a decade with the Padres, said of Hoffman's changeup: [...] "He pitched so well off his fastball [...] couldn't just sit on it every pitch." [...] "You could be sitting on [...] and still not be successful with it", says former player Mark Sweeney. It was the arm action on the change up and the late sink just before it reached the plate that allowed Hoffman to stay successful over the years. With opponents flailing to slow down their swings, teammates nicknamed Hoffman's changeup The Bugs Bunny Pitch after a famous Bugs Bunny cartoon episode. [...] "Some [...] fool you. Some guys overpower you. Hoffman embarrasses you", said former rival and later teammate Mike Piazza. After striking out on a changeup to end the game against Hoffman, Dodger catcher Paul Lo Duca said, [...] "It's like it has a parachute on it." [...] As Hoffman lost velocity on his fastball throughout his career, he compensated by maintaining a notable speed differential between that pitch and his changeup. He initially kept the grip of his changeup a secret. [...] "I was a little weird about it", Hoffman said. [...] "I didn't like talking about how I threw the change. I didn't want people <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> gripped the ball. I thought I'd be giving away something to the hitters." [...] Later in his career, he posed for pictures of his grip, figuring everyone had seen it.|$|E

500|$|John Hotchkis was {{originally}} hired to compose the music but, {{when he fell}} ill, Anthony Hinds asked conductor John Hollingsworth to recommend a replacement. Hollingsworth suggested James Bernard, {{with whom he had}} worked on a number of BBC radio productions. Bernard sent Hinds a tape of the score of one of these productions, an adaptation of The Duchess of Malfi, and was duly hired. Bernard watched the film a number of times, stopping after each reel to make notes and discuss where the music would be needed. Val Guest was not involved in any of the music sessions; Anthony Hinds supervised Bernard and made the final decisions as to where the music should occur. Bernard composed the music at his piano and then worked out the orchestration, which was performed by the Royal Opera House Orchestra. Hollingsworth restricted the arrangement of the score to just the string and percussion sections: Bernard recalled, [...] "I had not written for film before and had only used strings for the BBC scores, so I think that John thought it would be better <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> got on with these two sections before letting me loose with a full orchestra". The score runs to 20 minutes and uses a rising and falling three-note semitone throughout. Bernard's biographer, David Huckvale, argues that Bernard's use of atonal strings {{to create a sense of}} menace predates Bernard Herrmann's score for Psycho (1960), which is usually cited as the first film to employ the technique. [...] Remarking on the effectiveness of the score, the film critic John Brosnan said, [...] "Of prime importance, is the contribution of the soundtrack, in this case supplied by James Bernard who never wrote a more unnerving, jangly score". Bernard went on to become Hammer's most prolific composer, scoring 23 Hammer films between 1955 and 1974. Several cues from The Quatermass Xperiment were released on CD in 1999 by GDI Records on a compilation titled The Quatermass Film Music Collection.|$|E
