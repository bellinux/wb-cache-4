The sound made by the Atlantean flying-fish vehicles posed a particular challenge.

40|$|The Darwinian {{revolution}} is generally {{taken to be}} one of the key events in the history of Western science. In recent years, however, the very notion of a scientific revolution has come under attack, and in the specific case of Charles Darwin and his Origin of Species there are serious questions about the nature of the change (if there was such) and the specifically Darwinian input. This article considers these issues by addressing these questions: Was there a Darwinian revolution? <b>That</b> <b>is,</b> was there a revolution at all? Was there a Darwinian revolution? <b>That</b> <b>is,</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> the specific contribution of Charles Darwin? Was there a Darwinian revolution? <b>That</b> <b>is,</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> the conceptual nature of what occurred on and around the publication of the Origin? I argue <b>that</b> there <b>was</b> a major change, both scientifically and in a broader metaphysical sense; <b>that</b> Charles Darwin <b>was</b> the major player in the change, although one must qualify the nature and the extent of the change, looking particularly at things in a broader historical context than just as an immediate event; and <b>that</b> the revolution <b>was</b> complex and we need the insights of rather different philosophies of scientific change to capture the whole phenomenon.

2500|$|A related {{problem is}} the {{partition}} problem, {{a variant of the}} knapsack problem from operations research. Some weights are put on a balance scale; each weight is an integer number of grams randomly chosen between one gram and one million grams (one metric ton).

(In case the sum of all the weights is an odd number of grams, a discrepancy of one gram is allowed.) If there are only two or three weights, the answer is very clearly no; although there are some combinations which work, the majority of randomly selected combinations of three weights do not. If there are very many weights, the answer is clearly yes.

2500|$|The Nazi {{woman had}} {{to conform to}} the German society desired by Adolf Hitler (Volksgemeinschaft), racially pure and {{physically}} robust. She did not work, living in the naturalization of motherhood and following the slogan of the former emperor William II of Germany: Kinder, Küche, Kirche, meaning [...] "Children, kitchen, church". In a document published in 1934, The Nine Commandments of the Workers' Struggle, Hermann Goering bluntly summarizes the future role of German women: [...] "Take a pot, a dustpan and a broom and marry a man". This was anti-feminism {{in the sense that the}} Nazis considered political rights granted to women (access to high-level positions for example) as incompatible with the nature of reproduction, the only role within which they could blossom and best serve the interests of the nation. Thus, Magda Goebbels declared in 1933: [...] "German women were excluded from three professions: the army, as elsewhere in the world; the government; and the judiciary. If a German girl must choose between marriage or a career, she will always be encouraged to marry, because <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> best for a woman". It is not possible to make a mental leap to the conservative and patriarchal societies that prevailed for example during the Second Empire; in effect, the totalitarian character of the regime moved away from the concept that had been made of women being put on a shelf by society. On the contrary, they were expected to participate at the ground level in the roles of mother and spouse. The fact that the regimentation of women (Bund Deutscher Mädel then Frauenschaft) being so organized, did not permit relegating women to what they could do in the 19th century. Without a doubt, a conservative electorate and a fringe part of the population very critical of the image of the emancipated woman from the 1920s found a certain satisfaction in the new regime. But the goals were different, asking each woman to take part in the building of the [...] "Reich of 1000 years". Female liberation found itself therefore necessarily limited, and Heide Schlüpmann stated conclusively in Frauen und Film, that the films of Leni Riefenstahl (the official film director of the regime) [...] "value quite a negation of female sexuality and only offer women a deceptive autonomy".|$|E
