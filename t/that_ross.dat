25|$|Chalmers again confronts Bullitt, {{demanding}} a signed admission <b>that</b> <b>Ross</b> died while in his custody. Bullitt refuses. A facsimile of Albert Renick's passport application arrives, showing {{the man they}} thought was Ross was actually Renick, a used car salesman from Chicago with no criminal record. Bullitt points out that Chalmers was duped by the real Ross, who used Chalmers to fake his own death by setting up Renick (similar in appearance to Ross) to die, then murdered the wife to complete the cover-up.|$|E

25|$|Delgetti discovers {{reservations}} for the Renicks on an evening flight to Rome. He and Bullitt head to San Francisco International Airport {{to look for}} the real Ross, who must be traveling as Renick. They stake out the Rome flight gate, only to find <b>that</b> <b>Ross</b> has switched to an earlier flight to London that is already taxiing toward takeoff. Chalmers shows up to lay claim to the real Ross, even though he is now wanted for murder, and is again rebuffed by Bullitt.|$|E
25|$|Bullitt and Delgetti investigate. Bullitt finds Weissberg, the {{cab driver}} who drove Ross to the hotel, and recreates Ross' journey {{when he arrived in}} town, {{learning}} that he made a long distance call from a phone booth. Bullitt's confidential informant, Eddy, reveals <b>that</b> <b>Ross</b> was caught stealing $2 million ($ million today) from the Chicago Mob and fled to San Francisco after escaping an attempted hit in Chicago. Meanwhile, Chalmers serves Bullitt's captain with a writ of habeas corpus to force him to make Bullitt give up Ross.|$|E
25|$|Douglasa {{plaintiff}} and {{defendant in}} several trials for civil or criminal libel. In 1913 {{he was charged}} with libelling his father-in-law. Also in 1913 he accused Arthur Ransome of libelling him in his book Oscar Wilde: A Critical Study. He saw this trial as a weapon against his enemy Ross, not understanding <b>that</b> <b>Ross</b> would not be called to give evidence. The court found in Ransome's favour. Douglas was bankrupted by the failed libel suit. Ransome did, however, remove the offending passages from the 2nd edition of his book.|$|E

However, a person serving as an elected public official in Nevada may not have his name listed on a law firm letterhead, and Goodman removed his name under protest after several newspaper articles noted the infraction.|$|E

Economically, however, the majority of Perot voters (57%) were middle class, earning between $15,000 and $49,000 annually, with {{the bulk of the}} remainder drawing from the upper middle class (29% earning more than $50,000 annually). Exit polls also showed <b>that</b> <b>Ross</b> Perot drew 38% of his vote from Bush, and 38% of his vote from Clinton, though it's generally considered that he aided Clinton in defeating Bush.|$|E
25|$|Bullitt and Delgetti {{face their}} superiors. They reveal <b>that</b> <b>Ross</b> {{is dead and}} that their only lead is phone records showing that Ross's call was to a Dorothy Simmons in a hotel in nearby San Mateo. It is Sunday; the detectives are given until Monday to follow up the lead. With his car out of commission, Bullitt gets a ride from Cathy in her Porsche 356. The detectives find Dorothy Simmons strangled to death. Cathy sees police rushing in and follows, fearing for Bullitt. Afterwards, horrified by the crime scene, she confronts him about his violent world, {{wondering}} whether she even really knows him.|$|E

25|$|While in prison, Wilde wrote Douglas a {{long and}} {{critical}} letter titled De Profundis, describing exactly what he felt about him, which Wilde was not permitted to send, but {{which may or may}} not have been sent to Douglas after Wilde's release: it was given to Robbie Ross, with the instructions to make a copy and send the original to Lord Alfred Douglas. Lord Alfred Douglas later said that he received only a letter from Ross with a few choice quotes, and didn't know there was a letter until it was referenced in a biography of Wilde's <b>that</b> <b>Ross</b> consulted on. Following Wilde's release (on 19 May 1897), the two reunited in August at Rouen, but stayed together only a few months owing to personal differences and the various pressures on them.|$|E
25|$|In late February, Gallinger {{was visiting}} {{his family in}} Port Colborne when he {{received}} a call to come to Toronto to be questioned concerning the Detroit gambler. On the train ride to Toronto, Gallinger made the decision he would deny everything to save his father the disgrace. In Toronto, {{the general manager of}} the Bruins, Art Ross, was questioning all the Boston players one-by-one. When it was his turn, Ross told Gallinger he knew he was involved, but Gallinger continued to insist on his innocence. Art Ross then personally approached Gallinger's father and proposed the idea of his son seeing a psychiatrist in Toronto. When his father told him of the idea, Gallinger refused. Years later, Gallinger stated that he regretted the decision as in retrospect he realized <b>that</b> <b>Ross</b> was {{looking for a way to}} defend him.|$|E
25|$|After the war, the two {{factions of}} the Cherokee tried to {{negotiate}} separately with the US government Southern Treaty Commission. The commissioner of Indian Affairs, Dennis N. Cooley, was persuaded to believe allegations by Stand Watie and Elias Cornelius Boudinot <b>that</b> <b>Ross</b> was a dictator {{who did not}} truly represent the Cherokee people. Even though his health was worsening, Ross left Park Hill, where he was staying with his niece, on November 9, 1865, to meet with President Andrew Johnson. Johnson instructed Cooley to reopen negotiations with the Cherokee and to meet only with the pro-Union faction, headed by John Ross. Ross died on August 1, 1866 in Washington, D.C. while still negotiating a final treaty with the federal government. However, Ross had by then persuaded Johnson to reject a particularly harsh treaty version favored by Cooley.|$|E

25|$|McLean's advice precipitated a split {{within the}} Cherokee {{leadership}} as John Ridge and Elias Boudinot began to doubt Ross's leadership. John Ridge introduced a resolution {{at the national}} council meeting in October, 1832 to send a delegation to Washington to discuss a removal treaty with President Jackson. The council rejected Ridge's proposal and instead selected Joseph Vann, John Baldridge, Richard Taylor and John Ross to represent the Cherokee. In February 1833, Ridge wrote Ross advocating that the delegation dispatched to Washington that month should begin removal negotiations with Jackson. Ridge and Ross did not have irreconcilable worldviews; neither believed that the Cherokee could fend off Georgian usurpation of Cherokee land. However, Ridge was furious <b>that</b> <b>Ross</b> had refused to consider Jackson's offer to pay the Cherokee $3,000,000 for all their lands in Georgia, Alabama and Tennessee.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} sites in Ireland during this period is Ross Island. A series of copper mines from here are the earliest known in Ireland, starting from around 2500 BC (O'Brien 2004). A comparison of chemical traces and lead isotope analysis from these mines with copper artifacts strongly suggests <b>that</b> <b>Ross</b> Island was the sole source of copper in Ireland between the dates 2500–2200 BC. In addition, two thirds of copper artifacts from Britain also display the same chemical and isotopic signature, strongly suggesting that Irish copper was a major export to Britain (Northover et al. 2001). Traces of Ross Island copper can be found even further afield; in the Netherlands it makes up 12% of analysed copper artifacts, and Brittany 6% of analysed copper artifacts After 2200 BC there is greater chemical variation in British and Irish copper artifacts, which tallies well with the appearance of other mines in southern Ireland and north Wales. After 2000 BC, other copper sources supersede Ross Island. The latest workings from the Ross Island mines is dated to around 1700 BC.|$|E
25|$|After the war, when serious {{consideration}} was {{being given to}} the production of the official history, Lieutenant General Alexander Godley, the commander of the NZEF, believed <b>that</b> <b>Ross</b> would be the best person to produce the history. However, Major General Alfred Robin, the commandant of the New Zealand Military Forces, held firm views of what should be communicated by an official history. He dictated an educational approach, considering the target audience to be students of military history. Journalistic and writing skills were second to the ability to understand and communicate military tactics and strategy, the lessons of which were to be imparted at the direction of the Imperial General Staff at the War Office. Hence, rather than Ross, Lieutenant Colonel Hugh Stewart, who had commanded a battalion in the New Zealand Division during the war, was favoured by Robin to write the official history. It was recognised that an accessible 'Popular History', aimed at a more general readership would be appropriate alongside the official history. Endorsed by the Minister of Defence James Allen, the Government approved the writing of this 'Popular History'. The Government's decision to produce a 'Popular History' was formally announced in June 1918.|$|E

25|$|Ross {{was known}} as a smart fighter with great stamina. He {{retained}} his title by decision against Sammy Fuller to finish 1933 and against Peter Nebo to begin 1934. Then he defended against former world champion Frankie Klick, against whom he drew in ten. Then came the first of three bouts versus Jimmy McLarnin. Ross vacated the light welterweight title to go after McLarnin's welterweight title and won by a 15-round decision, his third world championship. However, in a rematch a few weeks later, McLarnin beat Ross by a decision and recovered the title. After <b>that,</b> <b>Ross</b> went back down to light welterweight and reclaimed his title with a 12-round decision over Bobby Pacho. After beating Klick and Henry Woods by decision to retain that title, he went back up in weight for his third and last fight with McLarnin; he recovered the welterweight title by outpointing McLarnin again over 15 rounds. He won 16 bouts in a row after that, including three over future world middleweight champion Ceferino Garcia and one against Al Manfredo. His only two defenses, however, over that stretch were against Garcia and against Izzy Jannazzo, on points in 15 rounds.|$|E
25|$|Alexander Mackenzie {{mentioned}} the Wester Ross Macaulays in his 19th-century history of Clan Mackenzie. He {{stated that the}} predecessors of the Macaulays had been granted the lands of Loch Broom and Coigeach by Alexander II. A. Mackenzie stated that during the 13th century, Uilleam I, Earl of Ross was an instrumental force in regaining control from the Norse; {{and that he was}} naturally desirous to gain control of Eilean Donan to aid his cause. During this time, however, the fortress was under the control of Coinneach, the eponymous ancestor of Clan Mackenzie, who refused to hand over the fortress to the king. A. Mackenzie stated that Coinneach was supported by the natives of the district, including the Macaulays of Loch Broom. Much later the third chief of the Mackenzies, Coinneach, was captured by Leod Macgilleandrais, a relative and vassal of the Earl of Ross. The Mackenzie chief was then executed at Inverness in 1346; and the lands of Kinlochewe were handed over to Macgilleandrais as reward. A. Mackenzie stated that the son of the executed Mackenzie chief, Murchadh Dubh, was a close friend of Duncan Macaulay who possessed the lands of Loch Broom, and who also commanded Eilean Donan. According to A. Mackenzie, because Ross was determined to capture the young Mackenzie, Macaulay sent both Mackenzie and his own son to the protection of Mackenzie's relative, Macdougall of Lorne. Ross, however, was successful in capturing Macaulay's son, and had him put to death for Macaulay's part in holding Eilean Donan. A. Mackenzie stated that the actual killer of Macaulay's son was Macgilleandrais; and <b>that</b> <b>Ross</b> granted the lands of Loch Broom and Coigeach as reward for this deed. According to A. Mackenzie, Macgilleandrais's seat at Kinlochewe was situated in a convenient location for his military operations; as it lies exactly between Kintail and Loch Broom. A. Mackenzie continued that Macaulay managed to hold onto Eilean Donan despite several attacks. When Murchadh had grown and returned to his lands, he married Macaulay's daughter, and through her the Macaulays' lands ultimately passed {{into the hands of the}} Mackenzies.|$|E
25|$|The Nationals {{played their}} annual Independence Day contest at Nationals Park on July 4 against the {{division}} rival New York Mets, with Joe Ross starting {{for the home}} team. The Nationals won 11–4, marking yet another game for Ross in which he received run support in the double-digits: his seventh in 12 starts on the season to that point. The win was also Washington's 50th of the season. The next day's game was postponed due to rain, while the game {{on the day after}} that — the opener of a series at Nationals Park against Washington's top division rival, the Atlanta Braves — was delayed for more than three hours due to a thunderstorm in the forecast, which never materialized, prompting some criticism of the Nationals for unnecessarily pushing back the start time until 10:10 p.m. EDT. The July 6 game, which actually finished early in the morning of July 7 due to the late start, was a 5–2 Braves win. Starting center fielder Michael A. Taylor was lifted midway through the game with an oblique strain, which manager Dusty Baker announced after the game would send him to the 10-day disabled list, with outfielder Chris Heisey being activated from the disabled list in a corresponding move. The Nationals struck back that evening, mounting a ferocious ninth-inning rally in the July 7 game to come back from a three-run deficit and force extra innings. In the tenth inning, the shortstop Sánchez lined a slider from former National Ian Krol, pitching in relief for Atlanta, up the middle for his first career hit. Three at-bats later, Sánchez came around to score on second baseman Daniel Murphy's walk-off single over the head of left fielder Matt Kemp, and the Nationals won 5–4. In the July 8 game, though, the Nationals suffered their first shutout of the year, losing 13–0 as the Braves pummeled starter Stephen Strasburg, who exited the game in the third inning after being hit on the hip with a line drive comebacker; usual starter Tanner Roark, in his first relief appearance of the season; and Solis, still working his way back from injury. The Nationals defeated Atlanta 10–5 to earn a split of the four-game series on July 9, in their last game before the All-Star Break. Ross again received double-digit run support, for the eighth time in 13 starts to begin the season, but exited in the fourth inning after exhibiting a marked decrease in velocity and struggling with his command. The team announced several days later <b>that</b> <b>Ross</b> would undergo Tommy John surgery, forcing him to miss the remainder of the season and beyond.|$|E
