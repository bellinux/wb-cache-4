5|$|The Salton Trough {{is part of}} {{the complex}} plate {{boundary}} between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate where it undergoes a transition from the continental transform of <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> Fault system to the series of short spreading centers of the East Pacific Rise linked by oceanic transforms in the Gulf of California. The two main right–lateral strike-slip fault strands that extend across {{the southern part of the}} trough are the Elsinore Fault Zone/Laguna Salada Fault to the western side of the trough and the Imperial Fault to the east. The Imperial Fault is linked to <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> Fault through the Brawley Seismic Zone, which is a spreading center beneath the southern end of the Salton Sea.|$|E
5|$|At Lebec, California, {{just south}} of the {{epicenter}} of the July mainshock, <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> Fault comes together with the Garlock Fault, which is positioned at the northern border of the Mojave Desert. <b>The</b> <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> has been responsible for considerable seismic activity at its northern and southern sections, and traverses the area near the Transverse Ranges. The Kern Canyon Fault mirrors the path of the Kern River, and was thought to have a connection with the White Wolf Fault, but indicators observed following the July 21 earthquake demonstrated that the two are offset. The Owens Valley Fault, {{on the east side of}} the Sierran block, has been mapped and may possibly extend into area that was affected by the 1952 shocks. Other fault zones are present in the region, and have been of interest because they may have been responsible for minor earthquakes, but they are considered not as significant as the Kern Canyon, Owens Valley, and San Andreas Faults.|$|E
5|$|The Bay Area is {{well known}} for the {{complexity}} of its landforms that are the result of millions of years by the forces of plate tectonics, since the region is located {{in the middle of a}} meeting point between two plates. Nine out of eleven distinct assemblages have been identified in a single county, Alameda. Diverse assemblages adjoin in complex arrangements due to offsets along the many faults (both active and stable) in the area. As a consequence, many types of rock and soil are found in the region. The oldest rocks are metamorphic rocks that are associated with granite in the Salinian Block west of <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> fault. These were formed from sedimentary rocks of sandstone, limestone, and shale in uplifted seabeds. Volcanic deposits also exist in the Bay Area, left behind by the movement of <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> fault, whose movement sliced a subduction plate and allowed magma to briefly flow to the surface.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> Fault has offset Indian stone rings, {{its path}} is buried by sediments from Lake Cahuilla. During the Pleistocene, this fault was {{relatively}} inactive {{compared to the}} Imperial Fault and the San Jacinto Fault. Other faults that crossed the shores of Lake Cahuilla are the Extra fault zone, which divides a northern more stable basin from a southern basin that underwent tectonic extension and slightly slower sedimentation, the Coyote Creek Fault (whose movement rate has been estimated from displacement of Lake Cahuilla sediments and probably accelerated {{during the time of}} Cahuilla's highstand), the Superstition Mountain Fault which extends from the Coyote Creek fault, the San Jacinto Fault which runs parallel to part of Cahuilla's western shore, was last active in 820-1280, 1280, 1440-1637 and 1440-1640 and whose fault trace could be buried beneath sediments from Lake Cahuilla, and the Elmore Ranch fault which displays evidence of after-lake activity in the Superstition Hills. Faults on the lake floor include the Brawley Seismic Zone, potentially the Cerro Prieto Fault, the Imperial Fault, and the Kane Springs Faults. The Imperial Fault may have ruptured together with a rupture of <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> Fault during a highstand of Lake Cahuilla, and was last active during the 1940 Imperial Valley earthquake.|$|E
5|$|With the San Jacinto Fault Zone to the northwest, the Elsinore fault to the south-southwest, and the Imperial fault {{centered}} {{directly under}} the Imperial Valley, the area frequently encounters seismic activity, including moderate and damaging earthquakes. Other events in 1852, 1892, 1915, 1940, 1942, and 1987 have impacted the region.

5|$|The Mono–Inyo {{chain of}} craters lies in east-central California, roughly {{parallel}} to the eastern escarpment of the Sierra Nevada mountain range. Volcanism and seismic activity in eastern California {{are a result of}} two major geologic processes: northwest movement of the Pacific Plate with respect to the North American Plate along <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> Fault system near the coast, and east–west extension of the crust that formed the Basin and Range Province. In the Long Valley region, where the craters are located, basin and range extension encroaches onto the thick and stable crust of the Sierra Nevada.|$|E
5|$|The lake formed {{several times}} over during the Holocene when water from the Colorado River was {{diverted}} into the Salton Trough. This tectonic depression forms the northern basin of the Gulf of California, but it was separated from the sea proper by {{the growth of the}} Colorado River Delta. Such changes in river courses may have been caused by earthquakes among the numerous faults that cross the region, such as <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> Fault. Conversely, {{it is possible that the}} weight of the water itself triggered earthquakes. During its existence, Lake Cahuilla formed strandlines and various beach deposits such as gravel bars and travertine deposits.|$|E

40|$|Trough {{alter the}} state of stress by bending the {{lithosphere}} {{in response to the}} applied lake load and by varying the pore pressure magnitude within the crust. The recurrence interval of the lake is similar to the recurrence interval of rupture on <b>the</b> southern <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> and <b>San</b> Jacinto faults, both of which are partially covered by the lake at its highstand. Furthermore, four of the last five ruptures on <b>the</b> southern <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> fault have occurred near a time of substantial lake level change. We investigate the effect of Coulomb stress perturbations on local faults due to changing level of Lake Cahuilla to determine a possible role for the lake in affecting the timing of fault rupture. Coulomb stress is calculated with a three-dimensional model of an elastic plate overlying a viscoelastic half-space. Plate thickness and half-space relaxation time are adjusted to match observed vertical deformation since the last lake highstand. The lake cycle causes positive and negative Coulomb stress perturbations of 0. 2 – 0. 6 MPa on <b>the</b> southern <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> within <b>the</b> lake and 0. 1 – 0. 2 MPa on <b>the</b> southern <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> outside <b>the</b> lake. These Coulomb stress perturbations are comparable to stress magnitudes known to have triggered events at other faults along the North America-Pacific plate boundary...|$|R

5|$|Basin and Range-associated {{stretching}} {{of large}} parts of crust below southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico started around 16millionyears ago and the region is still spreading. This stretching began to affect the Death and Panamint valleys area by 3million years ago. Before this, rocks now in the Panamint Range were on top of rocks that would become the Black Mountains and the Cottonwood Mountains. Lateral and vertical transport of these blocks was accomplished by movement on normal faults. Right-lateral movement along strike-slip faults that run parallel to and {{at the base of}} the ranges also helped to develop the area. Torsional forces, probably associated with northwesterly movement of the Pacific Plate along <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> Fault (west of the region), is responsible for the lateral movement.|$|E

50|$|Studies of past {{earthquake}} traces on both <b>the</b> northern <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> Fault and <b>the</b> southern Cascadia {{subduction zone}} indicate a correlation in time {{which may be}} evidence that quakes on the Cascadia subduction zone may have triggered {{most of the major}} quakes on <b>the</b> northern <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> during at least the past 3,000 years or so.

5|$|Patterns of seismic {{activity}} detected by paleoseismology {{suggest that the}} filling of Lake Cahuilla might have triggered stress changes that caused earthquakes along <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> Fault and other faults when they were already close to rupture. Such lake-induced seismicity is known from reservoirs and referred to as induced seismicity. Alternatively, earthquakes could have caused course changes in the Colorado River that then caused the lake to flood or to dry up; paleoseismology in Coachella is consistent with this hypothesis. Some earthquakes such as the 1892 Laguna Salada earthquake caused large vertical displacements that could have triggered flooding. Conversely, tectonically driven uplift of the northern side of the Colorado River Delta tends to stabilize the present southward course of the river against diversions to the north.|$|E
5|$|The northernmost {{coastal area}} {{is one of}} California's most seismically active regions and, in a 50-year period, the area {{including}} the Mendocino Fracture Zone at the southern flank of the Gorda Plate generated about 25 percent of all seismic energy unleashed in the state. The Mendocino Triple Junction (strike-slip/strike-slip/trench) formed 29–30 mya at 31° N (west of present-day Baja California) when the Pacific-Farallon spreading center initially approached the subduction zone {{off the coast of}} western North America. Simultaneously, the Rivera Triple Junction shifted to the southeast to its current position at 23° N. Once the Pacific Plate and North American Plate connected the boundary became that of a transform fault (San Andreas) due to the northwestward motion of the Pacific Plate relative to the North American Plate. <b>The</b> <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> Fault continues to lengthen to the northwest and the southeast as the two triple junctions continue their transient motion.|$|E
