Composer Jerry Bock, a Pulitzer Prize and Tony Award recipient, chose the BMI Lehman Engel Musical Theater Workshop-developed musical himself to receive the award. It received nominations in 2011 for five Drama Desk Awards including Outstanding Musical, Outstanding Lyrics, and Outstanding Book of a Musical; in addition to nominations for a Lucille Lortel Award and a GLAAD Media Award.

25|$|On December 19, 1880, Billy the Kid, Charlie Bowdre, Tom Pickett, Billy Wilson and Tom O'Folliard rode into Fort Sumner. Lying in wait were deputy Garrett and his posse. Mistaking O'Folliard for the Kid, Garrett's men {{opened fire}} and killed O'Folliard; Billy the Kid {{and the others}} escaped unharmed. Three days later, Garrett's posse cornered the Kid and his companions at a spot called Stinking Springs. They killed one man and {{captured}} the others, including the Kid. On April 15, 1881, Billy <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>was</b> sentenced to hang by Judge Warren Bristol, but he escaped thirteen days later.|$|E
25|$|As Billy <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>was</b> reborn {{a romantic}} or tragic figure in {{literature}} and films of the 1920s–1940s; high culture began to turn its attention to his legend in the late 1930s. Lincoln Kirstein, co-founder with George Balanchine of the School of American Ballet, drew material from Burns' book to write the libretto for a ballet to be called Billy the Kid, performed by his new group, the Ballet Caravan. Composer Aaron Copland was commissioned to score the music, and Eugene Loring to do the choreography. The ballet premiered at the Chicago Civic Opera House on October 16, 1938, and has since become a repertory standard.|$|E

40|$|In {{a family}} context with {{endogenous}} timing, multiple public goods and alternative parental instruments, {{we show that}} the optimal timing for the sequential-action game played by rotten kids and a parent depends crucially on whether <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>are</b> homogeneous or heterogeneous. For homogeneous <b>kids,</b> <b>the</b> rotten <b>kid</b> theorem holds irrespective of the parental policy instrument, implying that it is optimal to let <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> to <b>be</b> action leaders. If <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>are</b> heterogeneous, however, parental leadership yields a first best outcome and, hence, it <b>is</b> optimal whenever <b>the</b> <b>kids</b> <b>are</b> economically dependent and agree on the tradeoff between public goods...|$|R

500|$|Losing a {{child is}} thought to have {{influenced}} Chaplin's work, as he planned a film which turned the Tramp into the caretaker of a young boy. For this new venture, Chaplin also wished to do more than comedy and, according to Louvish, [...] "make his mark on a changed world." [...] Filming on The Kid began in August 1919, with four-year-old Jackie Coogan his co-star. It occurred to Chaplin that it was turning into a large project, so to placate First National, he halted production and quickly filmed A Day's Pleasure. <b>The</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>was</b> in production for nine months until May 1920 and, at 68 minutes, it was Chaplin's longest picture to date. Dealing with issues of poverty and parent–child separation, The Kid {{is thought to have}} been influenced by Chaplin's own childhood {{and was one of the}} earliest films to combine comedy and drama. It was released in January 1921 with instant success, and, by 1924, had been screened in over 50 countries.|$|E
500|$|Bobby Orr {{displayed}} his hockey talents from {{an early}} age. Orr played his first organized hockey in 1953 at age five, in the [...] "minor squirt" [...] division, a year after getting his first skates and playing shinny. Although he was tiny and somewhat frail, he soon was able to skate faster than anyone his own age, speed he demonstrated in races around the rink and in games. Until he was ten years old, Orr played on the wing, as a forward. His coach, former NHL player Bucko McDonald moved Orr to defence. Although Orr played defence, McDonald encouraged Orr to use his talents as a stickhandler, skater and scorer to make offensive rushes. According to McDonald: [...] "I used to tell Doug <b>the</b> <b>kid</b> <b>was</b> in his natural position when he played defence. You didn't have to be genius to see that – honest. I don't think Doug agreed, but he accepted my decision." [...] Orr would later credit McDonald: [...] "Bucko taught me almost everything I know." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2005, then-Harvard {{assistant}} coach Bill Holden saw that Lin was [...] tall, which fit the physical attributes he was seeking, {{and he had}} a 4.2 grade point average in high school, which met Harvard's academic standards. But Holden was initially unimpressed with Lin's on-court abilities, and told Lin's high school basketball coach, Peter Diepenbrock, that Lin was a [...] "Division III player". Later that week, Holden saw Lin playing in a much more competitive game, driving to the basket at every opportunity with the [...] "instincts of a killer", and Lin became a top priority for him. Harvard coaches feared that Stanford, close to Lin's home, would offer Lin a scholarship, but it did not, and Lin chose to attend Harvard. [...] "I wasn't sitting there saying all these Division I coaches were knuckleheads," [...] Diepenbrock said. [...] "There were legitimate questions about Jeremy." [...] Joe Lacob, incoming Warriors owner and Stanford booster, said Stanford's failure to recruit Lin [...] "was really stupid. <b>The</b> <b>kid</b> <b>was</b> right across the street. [...] you can't recognize that, you've got a problem." [...] Kerry Keating, the UCLA assistant who offered Lin the opportunity to walk-on, said in hindsight that Lin would probably have ended up starting at point guard for UCLA.|$|E

2500|$|On July 14, 1881, Garrett visited Fort Sumner to {{question}} {{a friend of}} the Kid's about his whereabouts and learned he was staying with a mutual friend, Pedro Menard [...] "Pete" [...] Maxwell. Around midnight, Garrett went to Maxwell's house. <b>The</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>was</b> asleep {{in another part of the}} house, but woke up in the middle of the night and entered Maxwell's bedroom, where Garrett was standing in the shadows. The Kid did not recognize the man standing in the dark. He asked him, repeatedly, [...] "¿Quién es?" [...] (Who is it?), and Garrett replied by shooting at him twice. The first shot hit the Kid in the chest just above the heart, killing him.|$|E
2500|$|When he {{was still}} alive, [...] "Billy the Kid" [...] had already become a nationally known figure whose exploits, real and imaginary, were {{reported}} in the National Police Gazette and the large newspapers of the eastern United States. After his death on July 14, 1881, all of New York City's papers ran his obituary, and within days, newspapers around the United States were printing exaggerated and romanticized accounts of Billy the Kid's short career. In the fifteen or so dime novels about his criminal career published between 1881 and 1906, <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>was</b> an outlaw antihero, customarily depicted as a badman with superior gunslinging skills, or even as a demonic agent of Satan who delighted in murder.|$|E
2500|$|Following Billy the Kid's death, writers quickly {{went to work}} {{producing}} {{books and}} articles that made a folk hero out of Billy the Kid, while making Garrett seem like an assassin. Garrett attempted to counter these writers by publishing a book of his own in 1882. The Authentic Life of Billy, <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>was</b> largely ghost-written by Garrett's friend Marshall Ashmun [...] "Ash" [...] Upson (1828–1894). A failure when originally released, an original copy of the Pat Garrett-Ash Upson book became a rare commodity; in 1969 the original 1882 edition of the Garrett-Upson book was described by Ramon F. Adams as being [...] "exceedingly rare." [...] Twentieth century editions of Garrett's Authentic Life of Billy, the Kid (with alterations to the original title) appeared in 1927, 1946 and 1964.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the first}} In Your House pay-per-view, Razor Ramon and the 1–2–3 Kid had been {{scheduled}} against the WWF Intercontinental Champion [...] Jeff Jarrett and his Roadie but as <b>the</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>was</b> unable to wrestle due to the Kid's (legit) neck injury, the match was changed to a Handicap match, which Ramon won. After the match, an unknown man, later revealed as Savio Vega, attacked both Jarrett and The Roadie before being escorted backstage. During a match between Vega and Jarrett on Raw, Roadie pushed Vega into guest commentator Shawn Michaels, who in turn shoved the Roadie away and later on attacked both Roadie and Jarrett. At the same time, Jarrett also focused on his music career. On the July 1, 1995 episode of Superstars of Wrestling, Jarrett's music video, [...] "With My Baby Tonight", premiered for the first time. The music video played over again at forthcoming WWF shows during July 1995.|$|E
2500|$|On March 1, 1879, after {{previous}} {{efforts to}} restore order in Lincoln County had failed, Wallace ordered the arrest of those responsible for local killings. One of the outlaws was William Henry McCarty, Jr. (alias William H. Bonney), better known as Billy the Kid. On March 17, 1879, Wallace secretly met with the Kid, who had witnessed {{the murder of a}} Lincoln County lawyer named Chapman. Wallace wanted the Kid to testify in the trial of Chapman's accused murderers, but the Kid had killed others and wanted Wallace's protection from the outlaw gang and amnesty for his crimes. During their meeting, the pair arranged for the Kid to become an informant in exchange for a full pardon of his previous crimes. Wallace supposedly assured the Kid that he would be [...] "scot free with a pardon in your pocket for all your misdeeds." [...] On March 20, the Kid agreed to testify against others involved in Chapman's murder. Wallace arranged for the Kid's arrest and detention in a local jail to assure his safety. After the Kid testified in court on April 14, the local district attorney revoked Wallace's bargain and refused to set the outlaw free. The Kid escaped from jail and returned to his criminal ways, which included killing additional men. <b>The</b> <b>Kid</b> <b>was</b> shot and killed on July 14, 1881 by Sheriff Pat Garrett, who had been appointed by local ranching interests who had tired of his rustling their herds. In the meantime, Wallace had resigned from his duties as territorial governor on March 9, 1881, and was waiting for a new political appointment.|$|E
