50|$|The DT200R shares similar engine {{cases with}} the ATV BLASTER - But the Blaster is not crank case {{induction}} like the DT200R. Both DT200R & Blaster crank shafts are compatible, the DT200R piston doesn't have port's like the Blaster, but the Blaster piston {{can be used}} with the DT200R. In the Blaster version & some of the DT200WR versions the oil pump is not installed, <b>blanking</b> <b>plug</b> is fitted over the oil pump drive.|$|R
5000|$|Suspension: Front {{suspension}} was conventional coil-spring/wishbone layout with an {{anti-roll bar}} and rack-and-pinion steering, on a detachable front cross member. Rear suspension was a high-pivot swing axle with concentric coil-spring/telescopic dampers sitting atop the swing tubes which Renault called trumpet casings. With {{the exception of}} the trunnion arms in the <b>transaxle</b> <b>housing,</b> there was no fore-aft 'location' of the rear suspension. The pressed engine/transaxle/suspension mounting member was detachable from the main body structure. 61 percent of the Dauphine's weight was carried by the rear wheels.|$|R
5000|$|Overall {{the design}} {{was smaller than}} the M113, and {{considerably}} less [...] "boxy," [...] more in keeping with contemporary European designs like the FV432. The small size meant {{there was no room}} for a transverse transmission in the front of the vehicle, so a rear-drive was used with a drive shaft and <b>transaxle</b> <b>housed</b> under the cargo section. These required boxy protrusions into the cargo area, and the transaxle in particular, mounted just in front of the doors, was a major tripping hazard. Additionally, the drive shaft was extremely noisy in operation.|$|R

An investigation showed fibres had become trapped inside the connector {{which would have}} caused a leak. Measurement of the plug and connector shows the secondary seal around the pins and sockets to be marginal. Care to avoid debris being trapped and better tools to aid tightening the connector will avoid {{a repeat of the}} problem...|$|R

50|$|However, {{the voice}} emitter and exhale valve cover {{is smaller than}} that of the S10, as are the lenses. The FM12 has an overall lower profile than the S10 and sits closer to the wearer's face. The FM12's {{drinking}} tube is also longer {{than that of the}} S10, making drinking easier while wearing the mask. The FM12 also has an inner mask to prevent fogging of the lenses. The 'ridge' present {{around the edge of the}} S10 is also absent from the FM12.The main noticeable difference between the FM12 and the S10 is the ability of some FM12's to mount 2 filters to the mask simultaneously, as was done by the SBS in the Gulf War. When only 1 filter is fitted to a mask that has the ability to accept 2 filters, a <b>blanking</b> <b>plug</b> must be used.|$|R
50|$|Breaking {{with the}} {{classical}} tradition of symmetry, the proscenium-style main entry {{is located on}} the corner of the site. The building’s two-story monumental entry at the corner accomplished several objectives: it connected the building with the Civic Center’s master plan axis; it gave the building an identity within the performing arts complex, from the Van Ness Avenue perspective where the Opera and Symphony faced; and it avoided orienting the main entry towards the Opera <b>House’s</b> <b>blank</b> rear wall.|$|R

[...] (What happened in Bydgoszcz?) and [...] "Pogotowie strajkowe w całym kraju" [...] (Country-wide strike alert). The censor had removed a section regarding the strike alert; hence the workers in the printing <b>house</b> <b>blanked</b> out an official propaganda section. The right-hand page also includes a hand-written confirmation of that decision by the local [...] "Solidarność" [...] Trade Union.|$|R
5000|$|An HSD {{transaxle}} {{contains a}} {{planetary gear set}} that adjusts and blends the amount of torque from the engine and motor(s) as it’s needed by the front wheels. It is a sophisticated and complicated combination of gearing, electrical motor-generators, and computer-controlled electronic controls. One of the motor-generators, MG2, {{is connected to the}} output shaft, and thus couples torque into or out of the drive shafts; feeding electricity into MG2 adds torque at the wheels. The engine end of the drive shaft has a second differential; one leg of this differential is attached to the internal combustion engine and the other leg is attached to a second motor-generator, MG1. The differential relates the rotation speed of the wheels to the rotation speeds of the engine and MG1, with MG1 used to absorb the difference between wheel and engine speed. The differential is an epicyclic gear set (also called a [...] "power split device"); that and the two motor-generators are all contained in a single <b>transaxle</b> <b>housing</b> that is bolted to the engine. Special couplings and sensors monitor rotation speed of each shaft and the total torque on the drive shafts, for feedback to the control computer.|$|R
5000|$|The M47TUD20 {{introduced}} new common failure points. Chief {{among these}} {{was a new}} 'swirl flap' mechanism embedded in the inlet manifold. This consisted {{of a number of}} butterfly valves within each individual inlet tract, which are secured to an actuating rod via two small screws. It has become clear that over time these screws can come loose via vibration etc. When this happens they can end up being drawn into the respective cylinder, causing significant damage to piston, cylinder head and valves. If unlucky further damage can be caused to the turbo if the screw then makes its way through the exhaust valve into the manifold and subsequently into the turbo. These failures have occurred in such quantity that a number of specialist BMW magazines have featured articles on the problem including information on how to remove the swirl flaps. [...] For those who wish to perform some preventive maintenance on the M47TUD20 engine, there are companies who supply and/or fit <b>blanking</b> <b>plugs</b> to allow the removal of these swirl flaps altogether. BMW addressed the problem by introducing stronger swirl flaps and larger diameter spindles - made from plastic - in 2006.|$|R

2500|$|Internally {{the rotor}} is cooled and {{lubricated}} by engine sump {{oil and the}} aforementioned trochoid pump. Engine oil is filtered by an easily accessible car-type oil filter on the lower {{right side of the}} cases. The filter includes an internal bypass valve in case of blockage. Further lubrication specifically for the tip, corner and side seals is provided by oil from a tank located under the seat. An engine-driven metering pump sends oil from this external tank into the carburetor at a ratio of around 100:1. Metering of the oil quantity is mechanically controlled by cables from the throttle grip. The metering pump also provided lubrication for the final drive chain. A second line is routed from the metering pump and around the bike, ending just above the drive chain behind the sprocket cover. This feature was also disconnected on the [...] "A" [...] models by a simple <b>blanking</b> <b>plug</b> at the metering pump. The gearbox is separated from the engine sump and has its own oil supply. Suzuki marketed its own brand of rotary oil but also approved at least two other oils for use in its rotary engine. Shell Super 10-20-50 and Castrol GTX were both endorsed lubricants.|$|R
50|$|Hewland Mk.III of 1962 {{became the}} first product for the public, which {{utilised}} the magnesium alloy case of the Beetle <b>transaxle</b> to <b>house</b> 5 pairs of bespoke straight-cut constant mesh spur gears with dog rings operated by custom-made brass shift forks. Gear selector shaft was located in the nose housing, unmodified as in the Beetle set up, facing rear-ward {{at the tail end}} of the box in the front-side-back position on a midship engine racing cars. The elimination of synchromesh parts provided the space for an additional pair of gears for the 5th speed.|$|R

6000|$|I {{forget what}} answer I made to this--I was given {{up to two}} other reflections. The first of these was that if the old lady lived in such a big, {{imposing}} house {{she could not be}} in any sort of misery and therefore would not be tempted by a chance to let a couple of rooms. I expressed this idea to Mrs. Prest, who gave me a very logical reply. [...] "If she didn't live in a big house how could it be a question of her having rooms to spare? If she were not amply lodged herself you would lack ground to approach her. Besides, a big house here, and especially in this quartier perdu, proves nothing at all: it is perfectly compatible with a state of penury. Dilapidated old palazzi, if you will go out of the way for them, are to be had for five shillings a year. And as for {{the people who live in}} them--no, until you have explored Venice socially as much as I have you can form no idea of their domestic desolation. They live on nothing, for they have nothing to live on." [...] The other idea that had come into my head was connected with a high blank wall which appeared to confine an expanse of ground on one side of the <b>house.</b> <b>Blank</b> I call it, but it was figured over with the patches that please a painter, repaired breaches, crumblings of plaster, extrusions of brick that had turned pink with time; and a few thin trees, with the poles of certain rickety trellises, were visible over the top. The place was a garden, and apparently it belonged to the house. It suddenly occurred to me that if it did belong to the house I had my pretext.|$|R
60|$|But Mr Arthur {{found the}} <b>house</b> so <b>blank</b> and dreary, {{and was so}} unwilling to assist at another implacable {{consignment}} of his mother's enemies (perhaps himself among them) to mortal disfigurement and immortal ruin, that he announced his intention of lodging at the coffee-house where {{he had left his}} luggage. Mr Flintwinch taking kindly to the idea of getting rid of him, and his mother being indifferent, beyond considerations of saving, to most domestic arrangements that were not bounded by the walls of her own chamber, he easily carried this point without new offence. Daily business hours were agreed upon, which his mother, Mr Flintwinch, and he, were to devote together to a necessary checking of books and papers; and he left the home he had so lately found, with depressed heart.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was to design the urban town <b>house</b> in <b>blank</b> space on Krizova street. The blank space is {{situated}} {{on the edge of}} the Mendel's square, an important transportation node of the city Brno. Spatial and conceptual solutions of the house is based on urban studies of Mendlel's square and its surroundings. The house is designed on a long parcel, which in the urban environment is equivalent to about four houses. Therefore, the house is divided vertically to keep the urban scale. At the same time at both ends it is directly connected to the existing buildings, therefore, different height levels of each mass are designed. Parterre of the house is commercial, as is the same for neighboring houses, in the other floors modern large single deck and maisonettes are designed...|$|R
60|$|High on the sun-scorched {{hillside}} {{above the}} steamy littoral of the Caribbean Sea the Spanish-Indian town of Rio Frio lay sweltering {{in the heat}} of afternoon. The flat-topped, white houses surrounding the plaza reflected a dazzling glare, and the heat shimmered mercilessly upon the rough paving-stones. Flakes of plaster had fallen from the buildings; a few of them were mere ruins, relics of a past age; for the town had been built when conquistadores from Spain first plunged into the tropic forest to search for El Dorado. Here and there dilapidated green lattices shaded upper windows, and nearer the ground narrow openings were guarded by rusty iron bars; but some of the <b>houses</b> showed <b>blank</b> outer walls, and the plaza had rather an Eastern than an American look. Spain has set upon the New World the stamp the Moors impressed on her.|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to provide an environmental enrichment device (shape target) to determine if it improved the Harbor Seal’s visibility in the underwater viewing windows when <b>housed</b> at the <b>Blank</b> Park Zoo. One male harbor seal (Phoca vitulina) 3 -years of age weighing 39 kg was used. Testing occurred Saturday through Tuesday over 6 consecutive weeks between 1300 and 1330 h. Live observations were collected continuously by one observer. Latency, frequency, and duration were measured. All data is presented descriptively. During baseline the Seal had no interest in the window. Upon presenting the “X” target, he approached quickly and interacted well. However by week 5, the seal’s interest to approach took longer but once the seal targeted he spent more time interacting with the device. Within the context of this study, the use of novel target enrichment for the seal showed promise in causing the seal to be more active towards the target and he was more visible in the underwater viewing windows...|$|R
