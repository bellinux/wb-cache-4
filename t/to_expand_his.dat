5|$|For Seiken Densetsu 3, Kikuta was {{assisted}} by a sound programmer, Hidenori Suzuki, which {{allowed him to}} compose over three {{times the amount of}} music he had created for Secret of Mana. The move to the PlayStation for Soukaigi allowed Kikuta to focus on creating live music for the soundtrack, rather than tweaking the synthesizer instruments to make the music files fit in the game cartridge as he had to for the Super Nintendo. He used the added audio processing power <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> <b>his</b> musical creativity, including pieces such as songs in unintelligible Thai and Malaysian by Japanese singers. The game itself, however, was not a success, and Kikuta decided that he wanted more direct control over the next project he worked on.|$|E
