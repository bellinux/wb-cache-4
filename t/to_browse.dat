Some studies state diplodocid necks were less flexible than previously believed, because the structure of the neck vertebrae would not have allowed the neck to bend far upwards, and that sauropods like Apatosaurus were adapted to low browsing or ground feeding.|$|E

5|$|A full-grown Scelidosaurus {{was rather}} small {{compared}} to most later non-avian dinosaurs, {{but it was a}} medium-sized species in the Early Jurassic. Some scientists have estimated a length of 4metres (13ft). In 2010, Gregory S. Paul gave a body length of 3.8 metres (12.5ft) and a weight of 270 kilogrammes. Scelidosaurus was quadrupedal, with the hindlimbs longer than the forelimbs. It may have reared up on its hind legs <b>to</b> <b>browse</b> on foliage from trees, but its arms were relatively long, indicating a mostly quadrupedal posture. A trackway from the Holy Cross Mountains of Poland shows a scelidosaur like animal walking in a bipedal manner, hinting that Scelidosaurus may have been more proficient at bipedalism than previously thought.|$|E
40|$|Overbrowsing by {{ungulates}} is a {{major cause}} of poor aspen stand regeneration across North America and Eurasia. In general, factors driving ungulate browser preferences include concentrations of plant secondary compounds and the nutritional composition (non structural carbohydrates, protein and minerals) of foliage. While each of these phytochemical factors has been shown to independently inﬂuence ungulate preference, the relative impact of each factor is unknown, as no study to date has examined them simultaneously. Plant ﬁtness depends not only on the capacity of plants <b>to</b> resist <b>browsing,</b> but also on their capacity <b>to</b> tolerate <b>browsing</b> once it has occurred. Little is known of aspen tolerance <b>to</b> <b>browsing,</b> which inﬂicts a different form of damage than insect herbivory. We employed multiple aspen genotypes, replicate trees of which were subjected to different soil nutrient treatments, to investigate: (i) the effects of aspen genotype, nutrient treatment and genotype 9 nutrient interactions on susceptibility <b>to</b> <b>browsing</b> by white-tailed deer, (ii) the phytochemical basis for the patterns observed in (i), and (iii) the effects of genotype, soil nutrients and their interaction on short-term tolerance <b>to</b> deer <b>browsing.</b> Aspen genotypes varied markedly in their vernal susceptibility <b>to</b> deer <b>browsing.</b> Genetic variation in early season levels of non-structural carbohydrates (sugars), protein and multiple macro- and trace minerals had the strongest inﬂuence on tree susceptibility <b>to</b> <b>browsing.</b> In contrast, levels of phytochemical defences had minimal effects, although the range of levels expressed in this study was small. Soil nutrient availability did not signiﬁcantly inﬂuence deer preference. The extent of browsing affected post-browse tolerance across genotypes. Soil nutrient treatment had little differential effect on tolerance, and, for the most part, genotypes did not display differential tolerance <b>to</b> <b>browsing,</b> regardless of which soil nutrient treatment they experienced. Synthesis. Genetic variation for susceptibility <b>to</b> <b>browsing</b> indicates that ungulate browsers have the potential to be agents of selection in aspen populations. In contrast with previous studies in aspen highlighting the importance of phytochemical defences in shaping preferences of browsing mammals, our results indicate that the nutritional composition of foliage (sugars, protein and mineral concentrations) can have sizable effects on preference. The observed lack of inﬂuence of soil nutrient availability on tree browsing tolerance contrasts with predictions of the limiting resource model, the prevailing model for plant tolerance...|$|R

5|$|Brachiosaurus is {{the first}} dinosaur seen by the park's visitors. It is inaccurately {{depicted}} as chewing its food, and standing up {{on its hind legs}} <b>to</b> <b>browse</b> among the high tree branches. According to artist Andy Schoneberg, the chewing was done to make the animal seem docile, in a way it resembled a cow chewing its cud. The dinosaur's head and upper neck was the largest puppet without hydraulics built for the film. Despite scientific evidence of their having limited vocal capabilities, sound designer Gary Rydstrom decided to represent them with whale songs and donkey calls to give them a melodic sense of wonder. Penguins were also recorded {{to be used in the}} noises of the dinosaurs.|$|E

There are also concerns with cybercriminals possibly hijacking the Links, or renaming their personal wireless networks to the same name as LinkNYC's network, in order to steal LinkNYC users' data. In addition, prior to September 2016, the tablets of the Links could be used <b>to</b> <b>browse</b> the Internet.

40|$|Birds in {{woodland}} can {{be affected}} by increasing deer populations through changes to vegetation structure and potential impacts on foraging resources; these effects need to be better understood. Effects of deer browsing are reported from a replicated split-plot exclusion experiment in English coppiced woodland. All stages of growth were examined up to eight years after felling. We used standardised mist-netting (totaling 1920 h) to sample birds in breeding and post-breeding periods. Deer browsing strongly altered vegetation structure by reducing canopy cover and shrub layer foliage density. However deer did not affect invertebrate density per unit of foliage, providing no evidence of an ungulate-mediated plant chemical response affecting forage quality for invertebrate herbivores. At avian guild level, significantly more ground and understorey foraging birds were captured where deer were excluded, and negative responses <b>to</b> <b>browsing</b> were more marked for pooled migrants than pooled residents. At the species level, especially pronounced negative effects were evident for dunnock (Prunella modularis) and garden warbler (Sylvia borin); approximately five times more dunnocks were captured in deer exclosures than in browsed vegetation. We also detected negative responses <b>to</b> <b>browsing</b> by nightingale (Luscinia megarhynchos) and long-tailed tit (Aegithalos caudatus). No significant positive responses <b>to</b> <b>browsing</b> were detected. For some species the use of young re-growth increased post breeding relative to the breeding period, including a marked shift by pooled residents that involved {{a disproportionate number of}} juveniles. Previous studies in North America have shown that, through vegetation modification, ungulate activity can alter woodland bird assemblages; as far as we are aware this is the first experimental demonstration of effects in Europe, and at low <b>to</b> moderate <b>browsing</b> intensity typical of the wider landscape scale...|$|R
