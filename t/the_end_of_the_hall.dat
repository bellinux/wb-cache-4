25|$|The home's {{interior}} features 16th, 17th, and 18th century French and English details. The {{building is}} heated by an oil-burning, hot air furnace and contains an Otis passenger elevator and freight elevator. The passenger elevator is wood-paneled and the freight elevator measures 5x4feet (1.5x1.2m) in diameter. The flooring consists {{of black and}} white marble squares and the walls are plastered to simulate limestone. In {{the back of the house}} is a five-bay entrance hall and staircase. The library entrance is located on the right side of the hallway and two reception rooms and a lavatory are located on the left side. Near <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> are service rooms, service elevator, dining room (now the ambassador's office), and a breakfast room. A lavatory is located beneath the main staircase. At <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> are two parlors and a large drawing room.

500|$|On the {{south-west}} side of {{the court}} is the hall, a 16th-century design incorporating an earlier hall on the same site. [...] wide, the hall was originally [...] high, with a roof made of Irish oak, lit and ventilated by a cupola in the middle. A large oriel window lit <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> occupied at dinner by the earls of Worcester, which by the time Raglan was built would have been used only for larger formal occasions. Originally, the hall would have been fitted with carved wooden panelling and a minstrel's gallery.|$|E
500|$|In 1873–79 Burges {{undertook}} a redecoration of the College's Hall. The funds {{needed for the}} Hall were raised by an appeal in which the decorated wooden panels on the walls were individual gifts, incorporating the crests and shields of the donors. In some cases, {{where there were no}} known crests or shields, those of former members were substituted and Burges made several painted imitations of marbling on wood. The large window at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hall</b> was also filled with the armorial bearings for which room had not been found in the panels. A fireplace was also inserted on the dais [...] Almost all of Burges's work in the Hall was lost in a redevelopment of the 1960s in which Wyatt's designs were reinstated, although the fireplace was removed to Knightshayes Court and the East Window, above the high table, was restored circa 2009.|$|E

500|$|In November 1987 Harrison {{released}} the platinum album Cloud Nine. Co-produced with Jeff Lynne of Electric Light Orchestra, the LP included Harrison's rendition of James Ray's [...] "Got My Mind Set on You", which went to {{number one in}} the US and number two in the UK. The accompanying music video received substantial airplay, and another single, [...] "When We Was Fab", a retrospective of the Beatles' career, earned two MTV Music Video Awards nominations in 1988. Recorded at his estate in Friar Park, Harrison's slide guitar playing featured prominently on the album, which included several of his long-time musical collaborators, including Clapton, Jim Keltner, and Jim Horn, who recalled Harrison's relaxed and friendly demeanour during the sessions: [...] "George made you feel at home, in his home... He once had me sit on a toilet and play my soprano sax, and they miked it at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> for a distant sound. I thought they were kidding... Another time he stopped me {{in the middle of a}} sax solo and brought me 3 p.m. tea—again I thought he was kidding." [...] Cloud Nine reached number eight and number ten on the US and UK charts respectively, and several tracks from the album achieved placement on Billboards Mainstream Rock chart – [...] "Devil's Radio", [...] "This Is Love" [...] and [...] "Cloud 9".|$|E
500|$|Mac Sledge finds {{redemption}} {{largely through}} his relationship and eventual marriage with Rosa Lee. This {{is in keeping}} with the motif of fidelity common in the works of Foote, inspired, said the writer, by his marriage to Lillian Vallish Foote. He told The New York Times that she [...] "kept me goin'. She never lost faith, and that's a rare thing. I don't know now how we got through it, but we got through it." [...] The lyrics of [...] "If You'll Hold the Ladder", which Mac performs with his new country band {{in the second half of}} the film, suggest what love has done for him. He sings of someone holding the ladder for him as he climbs to the top; this is symbolic of Rosa's love and guidance, which has allowed Sledge to improve himself and build a new life. The desultory romances that defined his past are represented by the more promiscuous lyrics of Dixie Scott's songs, such as those of [...] "The Best Bedroom in Town": [...] "The best part of all / the room at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> / That's where you and me make everything alright ... We celebrate the happiness we've found / Every night in the best bedroom in town". His storming out of her concert symbolizes his rejection of that earlier life. In contrast, Rosa Lee sings the humble church hymn, [...] "Jesus, Savior, Pilot Me". In a related way, the film emphasizes the importance of the woman's role in domestic life—although Mac takes on the role of patriarch in his new family setting, it is only through the support and care of Rosa Lee that he is able to settle into this role. Sociologist Norman K. Denzin points out that Tender Mercies embodies many of the ideas of recovery from addiction that are part of the twelve-step program used by Alcoholics Anonymous. Both the film and the support group's program advocate the idea of hitting rock-bottom, making a decision to stop drinking, dealing with the past and adopting a spiritual way of life.|$|E
2500|$|The Low German house first emerged {{towards the}} end of the Middle Ages. Only a few years ago a Hallehuis was {{discovered}} in the Dutch province of Drenthe, the frame of which can be dated to 1386. In 2012 a [...] "hallehuis" [...] was discovered in Best, in the Dutch provincie of North Brabant, which dates back to 1262 and is still in use as a stable. The living part of the farm itself is built in recent times, in 1640 at the earliest, but probably around 1680. The farm is an official monument. The oldest surviving houses of this type in Germany date to the late 15th century (e.g. in Schwinde, Winsen Elbe Marsh 1494/95). Regional differences arose due to the need to adapt to local farming and climatic conditions. [...] The design also changed over time and was appropriate to its owner's social class. From the outset, and for a long time thereafter, people and animals were accommodated in different areas within a large room. Gradually the living quarters were separated from the working area and animals. The first improvements were separate sleeping quarters for the farmer and his family at the rear of the farmhouse. Sleeping accommodation for farmhands and maids was created above (in Westphalia) or next to (in Lower Saxony and Holstein) the livestock stalls at the sides. Finished linen, destined for sale, was also stored in a special room. As the demand for comfort and status increased, one or more rooms would be heated. Finally the stove was moved into an enclosed kitchen rather than being in a Flett or open hearth at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall.</b>|$|E
