25|$|The {{most common}} disease of pignut hickory from Pennsylvania southward is a <b>trunk</b> <b>rot</b> caused by Poria spiculosa. Cankers vary {{in size and}} {{appearance}} depending on their age. A common form develops around a branch wound and resembles a swollen, nearly healed wound. On large trees these may become prominent burl-like bodies having several vertical or irregular folds in the callus covering. A single trunk canker near the base {{is a sign that}} the butt log is badly infected, and multiple cankers are evidence that the entire tree may be a cull.|$|E
50|$|It is {{predicted}} {{that climate change}} will impact the prevalence of aspen <b>trunk</b> <b>rot</b> through changing moisture conditions. One effect of climate change is expected increases in temperature. This will result in lower soil moisture levels because of increased transpiration and evaporation. This will cause moisture stress in the trees, making them more vulnerable to aspen <b>trunk</b> <b>rot.</b> Also with less moisture, wind-borne spore dispersal will be impacted. In warmer and drier climates the spread of disease through windborne spores may increase.|$|E
50|$|Aspen <b>trunk</b> <b>rot</b> is {{the most}} common stem decay of aspen in North America. It is {{especially}} common in the Rocky Mountains and in Colorado. Aspen <b>trunk</b> <b>rot</b> prevalence varies with age and soil conditions. In regions where aspen grow quickly and mature early, decay also advances rapidly and early in the tree’s life. It kills these trees by directly growing into and killing older sapwood. There is a higher percentage of incidence with dry, shallow soils and less incidence with deep soils with adequate moisture.|$|E
5000|$|Asplenium serratum is an epiphytic or lithophytic fern {{that grows}} on eroded limestone, tree <b>trunks,</b> <b>rotting</b> stumps, and fallen logs.|$|R
50|$|These beetles are nocturnal, {{and their}} feeding {{behaviour}} is unknown. Adult stag beetles worldwide have mouthparts suited to feeding on liquids. Geodorcus helmsi {{has been seen}} feeding on sappy exudations on tree <b>trunks.</b> <b>Rotting</b> wood, tree roots or humus {{are the most common}} food sources for stag beetle larvae, and G. ithaginis lives in an environment of enriched humus.|$|R
50|$|Ectemnius species {{excavate}} nest tunnels {{in pieces}} of dead wood such as stumps, fallen tree <b>trunks,</b> <b>rotting</b> logs and sometimes building timbers or posts {{with the help}} of the mandibles. Nesting aggregations can be large and dense, and sometimes more than one female has been recorded using a common nest entrance. In Central Europe, the brood is supplied with Diptera from several different families.|$|R
50|$|Aspen <b>trunk</b> <b>rot</b> affects {{only living}} aspen and {{occasionally}} {{a variety of}} poplar trees. Trembling Aspen Populus tremuloides and Large-tooth Aspen Populus grandidentata are two major hosts of <b>trunk</b> <b>rot.</b> In all infected species, the most obvious sign of rot is a conk on the stem of the tree. A conk is the woody fruiting body of the fungus that forms a triangular shape. Conks are perennial and can survive for up to twenty years. They form about {{five years after the}} initial infection. As the decay progresses, rot within the heartwood occurs. The rot appears as a yellowish-white spongy material with black zone lines surrounding it. The main body of rot occurs in the trunk and stem but basal rot can occur as well. The decayed wood has a distinct wintergreen aroma that signifies <b>trunk</b> <b>rot.</b> At the initial stages, the decay may appear discolored but continue to be hard and firm while at later stages, the rot may becomes brownish and the tree may lose structural strength and snap due to a wind gust or other damaging factor. Aspen <b>trunk</b> <b>rot</b> affects older (50-60 years) trees more than younger trees. Older trees tend to have more wounds and damage. Phellinus tremulae can maintain a resting state for 20 years, so older trees have a greater chance of being infected. Older trees become diseased and die more quickly than younger trees. Stem wounds also increase the opportunities for infection no matter the age of the tree. In order to diagnose aspen <b>trunk</b> <b>rot,</b> conks are the first sign to look for. Perennial conks with concentric growth rings indicate severe decay because each growth ring signifies a season of disease. It takes many years to build up the concentric rings to indicate severe decay. The conks can appear to have a triangular shape and the lower surface is covered in pores. Knots and stem wounds/scars also indicate decay within the aspen tree while cavities and cracks display the inner decay. Aspen <b>trunk</b> <b>rot</b> is a white rotter because the lignin is broken down within the tree, giving the diseased trunk a white appearance.|$|E
50|$|In England and officially in Canada, it {{is known}} as the sterile conk <b>trunk</b> <b>rot</b> of birch. However, It is {{commonly}} referred to by its anglicized Russian name, Chaga, in North America.|$|E
50|$|Phellinus tremulae is {{a species}} of polypore fungus in the family Hymenochaetaceae that grows on Populus tremula and on {{trembling}} aspen in Canada.

5000|$|A related {{example is}} where the {{parasitoid}} plant is not strictly a parasite in the normal sense, but nonetheless exploits the host's resources of space, support and light. The best-known are the so-called [...] "strangler figs". Some of them grow on and around {{the trunk of the}} host tree and squeeze or starve it of light until, after perhaps decades, it dies. The strangler eventually replaces the host utterly as the original <b>trunk</b> <b>rots</b> within the stems of the strangler, leaving a hollow framework.|$|R

5000|$|Red {{ring rot}} {{is common in}} North America. The {{pathogen}} Phellinus pini is widely spread in the temperate zone in the Northern Hemisphere. [...] It infects {{a wide range of}} coniferous trees, including jack pine, lodgepole pine, Sitka and white spruce, Douglas-fir, balsam and true fir, western hemlock, and tamarack. It attacks both heartwood and sapwood and causes white pocket <b>trunk</b> <b>rot.</b>|$|E
50|$|Abortiporus is a genus of {{fungi in}} the family Meruliaceae. The widely {{distributed}} genus contains three species. Species in the genus grow on the wood of hardwoods and conifers, either alone or around the stumps and living trees. It causes a white rot in dead wood and a white <b>trunk</b> <b>rot</b> in living wood. The genus was circumscribed in 1904 by William Alphonso Murrill.|$|E
50|$|Aspen <b>trunk</b> <b>rot</b> is a {{fungal disease}} that causes stem decay heart rot of living aspen trees. The {{pathogen}} that causes this disease is the fungus Phellinus tremulae. Most {{of the symptoms}} of this disease are internal, with the only external signs of a diseased aspen being fruiting bodies called conks. A single conk found on an aspen can indicate advanced decay of up 82% of the tree volume. Internal decayed wood of freshly cut aspens is spongy, yellow/white colored, surrounded by black zones of discoloration, and contains a distinct wintergreen smell. The fungus is spread via airborne spores released from the fruiting body which can infect through dead branches, branch stubs, or wounds in the tree. Although no direct management control is known, harvesting aspen stands that have been damaged or harvesting stands before decay becomes advanced minimizes tree loss. Aspen wood is white, malleable but strong, and heat tolerant and therefore has many commercial uses including matches, packing paper, lumber, plywood, pulp, and animal beds. Aspen trees diseased with aspen <b>trunk</b> <b>rot</b> decrease the economic value of the lumber.|$|E
25|$|The Index of Plant Diseases in the United States lists 133 fungi and 10 {{other causes}} of {{diseases}} on Carya species (4,9). Most of the fungi are saprophytes, {{but a few}} are damaging to foliage, produce cankers, or cause <b>trunk</b> or root <b>rots.</b>|$|R
50|$|Boomslangs are oviparous, {{and produce}} up to 30 eggs which are {{deposited}} in hollow tree <b>trunks</b> or <b>rotting</b> logs. The eggs {{have a relatively}} long (three months on average) incubation period. Male hatchlings are grey with blue speckles, and female hatchlings are a pale brown. They attain their adult coloration after several years. Hatchlings are approximately 20 cm in length and pose no threat to humans, but are dangerously venomous {{by the time they}} reach a length of about 45 cm and a girth as thick as an adult's smallest finger.|$|R
50|$|Hypholoma fasciculare, {{commonly}} known as the sulphur tuft, sulfur tuft or clustered woodlover, is a common woodland mushroom, often in evidence when hardly any other mushrooms are to be found. This saprophagic small gill fungus grows prolifically in large clumps on stumps, dead roots or <b>rotting</b> <b>trunks</b> of broadleaved trees.|$|R
50|$|Another {{possible}} {{management strategy}} {{would be to}} use the fungus Phoma etheridgei as an inhibitory agent against Phellinus tremulae. In {{a study published in}} the Canadian Journal of Botany the occurrence of black galls on aspen trees produced by Phoma etheridgei resulted in a significant decrease or absence of infection by Phellinus tremulae. Further studies on using the antifungal compounds produced by Phoma etheridgei to control aspen <b>trunk</b> <b>rot</b> may play a key role in controlling Phellinus tremulae.|$|E
50|$|Mockernut hickory is {{extremely}} sensitive to fire {{because of the}} low insulating capacity of the hard, flinty bark. Mockernut {{is not subject to}} severe loss from disease. The main fungus of hickory is Poria spiculosa, a <b>trunk</b> <b>rot.</b> This fungus kills the bark, which produces a canker, causes heart rot and decay, and can seriously degrade the tree. Mineral streaks and sapsucker-induced streaks also degrade the lumber. In general, the hard, strong, and durable wood of hickories makes them relatively resistant to decay fungi. Most fungi cause little, if any, decay in small, young trees.|$|E
50|$|It is also {{important}} to note the potentially positive ramifications of this fungus. P. pini and other <b>trunk</b> <b>rot</b> fungi serve an important role in forest ecosystems as disturbance agents, and {{play a key role in}} accelerating stand development. P. pini and other forest pathogens have been shown to be instrumental in facilitating Douglas-fir growth in the western US. Additionally, decayed trees, rotting from the inside-out, serve as important habitat to cavity-nesting birds and mammals. In the southeastern United States, this fungus is important for the nesting of the red-cockaded woodpecker.|$|E

30|$|P. nicotianae causes {{seedling}} blight {{of golden}} palm and also attacks California fan palm, causing <b>trunk</b> and collar <b>rots.</b> The disease appears to begin from wounds caused by leaf removal {{at or near}} the soil line. Although this disease can be reproduced by inoculations of the lower trunk, the bud and the entire stem are eventually rotted on some plants. Thus, P. nicotianae should also be considered as a possible cause of bud rots.|$|R

50|$|In Gardner, Massachusetts, {{there is}} a Camperdown Elm on Parker Street {{in the front yard}} of a former store now {{currently}} a private residence, towering over the peak of the two-story building with a trunk circumference of over 9 feet. The tree has not been touched for decades and is infested with leaf miners and borers; {{there is a}}lso a significant amount of <b>trunk</b> <b>rot</b> and large missing limbs. As of late June 2010, a local resident, Nate Thibault, has taken action to create a restoration plan for the tree. The tree's age is undetermined but believed to have reached its maturity.|$|E
50|$|On July 29, 2011, half of {{the tree}} fell due to <b>trunk</b> <b>rot</b> from ants after being hit by lightning.

The tree's fate was uncertain at the time, and officials were pessimistic about its chances of survival, but it {{was found to be}} alive. The tree was further damaged in July 2016 due to strong winds. The event caused a major increase in Internet traffic to the Mansfield and Richland County Convention and Visitors Bureau website and general interest in the Shawshank Trail. The remaining portions of the tree were cut down on April 9, 2017, by the property's current owner.|$|E
50|$|The {{silhouette}} of a gnarled tree trunk opposes the diagonals of the rocks and river, forcing the eye back into the scene. Here the twisted and <b>rotting</b> <b>trunk</b> is used, as it often is in Cole's work, as a symbol for the savage (untamed) wilderness and all its dangers. The funnel-shaped cloud that appears above the tree leads the eye up into the forbidding clouds of the sky, {{over the top and}} to the left, where the downward arc of the clouds forces it back down again into the river.|$|R
50|$|Tyromyces galactinus is {{a species}} of poroid fungus in the family Polyporaceae. Found in North America, is a plant {{pathogen}} that causes a white rot in broad-leaved trees.

The type was collected near Waynesville, Ohio, where it was found growing on <b>rotting</b> <b>trunks.</b> Although originally placed in genus Tyromyces by Russian mycologist Appollinaris Semenovich Bondartsev in 1953, the name is invalid as it did not confirm to the rules for naming species. Josiah Lincoln Lowe transferred the fungus to Tyromyces validly in 1975.|$|R
40|$|A {{survey of}} 140 {{vineyards}} in different production areas of Spain was conducted from 1999 to 2001 to identify pathogenic grapevine wood fungi. Fungal infected vines showed esca and decline symptoms, consisting mainly of reduced growth of canes and shoots, yellowing and necrotic spotting of leaves, sectorial and central brown necrosis of the <b>trunk,</b> soft <b>rotted</b> tissues and discoloured xylem {{at the base}} of the vines. Several fungi were consistently found associated with these symptoms: Botryosphaeria obtusa (isolated from 61. 4 % of all vineyards studied), Phaeoacremonium aleophilum (26. 4 %), Cylindrocarpon spp. (20 %), Phaeomoniella chlamydospora (18. 6 %) and Fomitiporia punctata (15 %) were the main fungi found. Less frequently isolated species were: Botryosphaeria dothidea (6. 4 %), Eutypa lata (2. 1 %), and Stereum hirsutum (1. 4 %). The association of these fungi and their role in esca disease and grapevine declines, as well as in the decline of young grapevines in Spain are discussed...|$|R
50|$|Phellinus tremulae spreads through {{airborne}} basidiospores. Sporulation {{occurs in}} late winter, early spring, and continues with moist {{weather in the}} summer. Spores germinate sexually in fresh wounds only (<1 week old) and conks are produced by the fungus body after 5 years of infection. The conks produce the basidiospores on the underside and setae surround the basidia for protection. Phellinus tremulae has spherical spores with four basidiospores per basidium and generative, skeletal hyphae. Compared to other species in the genus Phellinus, the setae are large and the basidiospores are much smaller. Within the tube layers, mycelium crowd the space. The infection of aspen <b>trunk</b> <b>rot</b> is localized, but decay can spread 2-3 meters {{above and below the}} infection site.|$|E
50|$|Aspen tree wood {{has many}} {{commercial}} uses {{due to its}} soft yet strong and heat tolerant wood. Some of these uses include matches, building material where low flammability is key, packing paper, plywood, and animal bedding {{due to lack of}} irritant phenols in the wood. Because infected trees lose an average of 70% wood volume to the fungus after being infected, Phellinus tremulae causes a lot of economic damage. For example, plywood should be decay free without any discoloration as this downgrades the product. Phellinus tremulae creates decay and discoloration and therefore results in enormous amounts of waste at the mill. Harvesting aspens with <b>trunk</b> <b>rot</b> is more costly because decay-free trees can be scattered over vast areas in the forest and determining if a tree is infected can be challenging without first cutting down the tree. The high moisture content found in trees infected with Phellinus tremulae increases the shipping costs if dried as it would be with uninfected trees. In order to combat these increased shipping costs, 15% more drying time is required to reduce the moisture content.|$|E
50|$|There is {{no direct}} known control for aspen <b>trunk</b> <b>rot.</b> There are {{management}} steps to preserve healthy stands of aspen. As a rule older stands contain a {{greater amount of}} decayed heartwood than young stands. Maintaining healthy stands and preventing mechanical and fire damage reduces the likelihood of disease. This is because trees with open wounds, frost cracks or conks {{are more susceptible to}} the fungus. This makes it hard to prevent because {{it can be difficult to}} prevent wounds on the tree. To reduce the impact that causing wounds can have, it is recommended that development of recreation areas not be in aspen stands because they could become more susceptible to decay and disease following injury caused by humans. It is also recommended that partial cutting to thin and remove defective trees not be used as a management technique because residual stands often deteriorate within 5 years. Instead the goal should be to maintain uniform, well-stocked stands and harvest the whole stand before the decay becomes excessive.|$|E
5000|$|The story {{continues}} around 1727. Tom Walker, a greedy, selfish miser of a man, cherishes money {{along with}} his shrewish and equally greedy wife.

Old Scratch appears as a lumberjack or a woodsman chopping trees, each with a prominent and wealthy colonialist's name branded on the <b>trunk.</b> One <b>rotted</b> and soon-to-fall tree has the name of a deacon who grew wealthy [...] "trading" [...] with the Indians. Another fallen trunk has that of a wealthy seaman rumored to be a pirate.

40|$|Lichenophanes varius (Illiger, 1801) is a Turanic-European-Mediterranean species. In most of European countries, {{this species}} is {{protected}} {{at different levels}} and it is classified as “NT” (Near Threatened) in the IUCN European Red List of Saproxylic Beetles. In Italy, it is classified as “EN” (Endangered). Its larvae are saproxylophagous and develop in branches and <b>rotting</b> <b>trunks</b> of many broadleaved tree genera. Nevertheless, this beetle seems to attack only wood which is already invaded by the mycelia of Biscogniauxia spp. (Pyrenomycetes, Xylariaceae). The Italian distribution and ecology of L. varius are updated {{on the basis of}} recent records; the species is recorded for the first time from Calabria, where it was reared from Quercus frainetto Ten. which represent a new host-plant record for this beetle. Finally, the authors discuss the possibility that global warming can promote a resurgence of attacks from the above mentioned phytopathogenic fungi in Italian forests and, therefore, this climatic change can also favour the populations of this red-listed beetle...|$|R
