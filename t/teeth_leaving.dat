25|$|Bigfoot proponents Grover Krantz and Geoffrey H. Bourne {{believed}} that Bigfoot {{could be a}} relict population of Gigantopithecus. All Gigantopithecus fossils were found in Asia, but according to Bourne, many species of animals migrated across the Bering land bridge and he suggested that Gigantopithecus might have done so, as well. Gigantopithecus fossils have not {{been found in the}} Americas. The only recovered fossils are of mandibles and <b>teeth,</b> <b>leaving</b> uncertainty about Gigantopithecus's locomotion. Krantz has argued that Gigantopithecus blacki could have been bipedal, based on his extrapolation of the shape of its mandible. However, the relevant part of the mandible is not present in any fossils. An alternative view is that Gigantopithecus was quadrupedal. The Gigantopithecus's enormous mass would have made it difficult for it to adopt a bipedal gait.|$|E

5000|$|Although their {{relationship}} with Dentsply can be terminated at will, the key dealers [...] "have a strong economic incentive to continue carrying Dentsply's teeth." [...] In one incident, current and potential customers of Atlanta Dental requested it to carry Vita teeth so as to have a local source {{instead of having to}} order directly from that West Coast manufacturer. But Dentsply advised Atlanta Dental that carrying Vita would cut off access to Dentsply teeth, which constituted over 90% of its tooth sales revenue. Atlanta Dental therefore chose not to add the Vita line. Other dealers tried selling other manufacturers' teeth, but Dentsply threatened to stop supplying its product to them, so they dropped the other lines. Because the volume of business done with Dentsply is so large in comparison to the business that violating Dentsply's exclusive dealing policy to take on another manufacturer's product would sacrifice, dealers comply with the policy. [...] "Criterion 6 imposes an 'all-or-nothing' choice on the dealers. The fact that dealers have chosen not to drop Dentsply teeth in favor of a rival's brand demonstrates that they have acceded to heavy economic pressure." [...] The court concluded that [...] "Dentsply's grip on its 23 authorized dealers effectively choked off the market for artificial <b>teeth,</b> <b>leaving</b> only a small sliver for competitors." [...] That is, Dentsply excluded competition by substantially raising rivals' costs to access ultimate customers.|$|E
50|$|There {{are many}} factors to why tooth disease and decay occur. When teeth aren’t cleaned or don’t get the proper care, food remains stuck between the teeth, {{and as the}} food {{decomposes}} on the tooth it generates acid that then decays the <b>teeth.</b> <b>Leaving</b> food in the teeth also causes more plaque growth. Due {{to the lack of}} education apparent in those areas, rural villagers don’t care for their teeth as often as needed. Another big reason for tooth disease is consuming foods and beverages that are high in sugar and starch which cause plaque to build up and spread very quickly over the teeth, thriving on the food remains. Soda products are especially bad for teeth, because they contain so much sugar and acid, and acid eats through anything including the enamel on teeth. Some symptoms of having tooth decay include: toothache, sensitivity, mild or sharp pain when eating or drinking sweets, hot or cold, or when biting down, visible holes or pits in the teeth, a bad taste in mouth, unexpected bad breath, loss of teeth, or have pain causing a person to avoid brushing or cleaning their teeth. In addition to these symptoms, this can become very painful causing tooth disease to interfere with daily living, such as attending school or work. As decay progresses, foods may become too painful to eat, and malnutrition may occur.|$|E
5000|$|When Talmadge {{was asked}} by a writer for Green Book {{magazine}} what sort of stories {{she wanted to do}} in 1920, she said: [...] "Although no less than sixty manuscripts are submitted to me every week, it is exceedingly difficult to get exactly the kind of comedy I especially want. I want comedies of manners, comedies that are funny because they delight one’s sense of what is ridiculously human in the way of little everyday commonplace foibles and frailties - subtle comedies, not comedies of the slap stick variety." [...] "I enjoy making people laugh. Secondly, because this type of work comes easiest and most naturally to me, I am not a highly emotional type. My sister could cry real tears over two sofa cushions stuffed into a long dress and white lace cap, to look like a dead baby, and she would do it so convincingly that 900 persons out front would weep with her. That is real art, but my kind of talent would lead me to bounce that padded baby up and down on my knee with absurd grimaces that would make the same 900 roar with laughter."You see, in my way, I take my work quite as seriously as my sister does hers - I would be just as in earnest about making the baby seem ridiculous as she would about making it seem real. I am not fitted to be a vamp type. There is nothing alluring, or exotic, or erotic, or neurotic about me. I could not pull the vamp stuff to save my life, but if I am assigned a vamp role in a comedy, and I had such a part in my fourth First National picture, In Search of a Sinner. I play it with all the seriousness and earnestness and sincerity with which a real vamp would play it, except that I, of course, over-emphasize all the characteristics of the vampire. I try to handle a comedy role {{much the same way that}} a cartoonist handles his pencils. If he is drawing the picture of the late Theodore Roosevelt, with a few strokes he emphasizes Teddy’s eye-glasses and <b>teeth,</b> <b>leaving</b> his ears and nostrils and the lines of his face barely suggestive. One must leave a great deal to the imagination on the screen, because in the span of one short hour we sometimes have to develop a character from girlhood to womanhood through three marriages and two divorces, and perhaps travel half way round the world besides; so, like the cartoonist, I try to emphasize the salient characteristics, which, of course, in my particular work, bring out the humorous side of the person I am portraying." ...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the effect of the application of fluoride products on the development of enamel caries in deciduous teeth. A total of 108 deciduous teeth were chosen for the study. Acid-resistant varnish was applied on the <b>teeth,</b> <b>leaving</b> only one area of 5 mm x 1 mm of dental enamel exposed. The teeth were allocated randomly to one of the following groups: 1) control - toothpaste without fluoride; 2) 1. 23 % fluoride gel; 3) Duraflur fluoride varnish; 4) Duraphat fluoride varnish; 5) Fluorniz fluoride varnish; 6) Fluorphat fluoride varnish; 7) varnish with Duofluorid; 8) 12 % silver fluoride diamine (Cariestop); 9) children's fluoride toothpaste (500 ppm). The tested products were applied on the teeth according to the manufacturer's recommendations and the teeth were stored in a moist environment for 24 hours. Each group of teeth was then subjected to a pH cycling model for 14 days, after which the teeth were cut through the center for an analysis of the depth of the carious lesion by polarized light microscopy. Comparisons were made between the treatments and the control group. The mean lesion depth values were 318 &# 956;m ± 39 (control), 213 &# 956;m ± 27 (fluoride gel), 203 &# 956;m ± 34 (Duraflur), 133 &# 956;m ± 25 (Duraphat), 207 &# 956;m ± 27 (Fluor-niz), 212 &# 956;m ± 27 (Fluorphat), 210 ± 28 (Duofluorid), 146 ± 31 (Cariestop) and 228 ± 24 (fluoride toothpaste). None of the products used here was able to completely prevent the formation of lesions. The highest cariostatic effect was achieved by fluoride varnish Duraphat and the lowest by the fluoride toothpaste...|$|E
50|$|Macroglossia may {{be caused}} by a wide variety of {{congenital}} and acquired conditions. Isolated macroglossia has no determinable cause. The most common causes of tongue enlargement are vascular malformations (e.g. lymphangioma or hemangioma) and muscular hypertrophy (e.g. Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome or hemihyperplasia). Enlargement due to lymphangioma gives the tongue a pebbly appearance with multiple superficial dilated lymphatic channels. Enlargement due to hemihyperplasia is unilateral. In edentulous persons, a lack of <b>teeth</b> <b>leaves</b> more room for the tongue to expand into laterally, which can create problems with wearing dentures and may cause pseudomacroglossia.|$|R

50|$|As the powered {{escape wheel}} rotates clockwise, the {{entrance}} tooth slides across the sloping impulse {{plane of the}} entrance pallet.

The wheel is said to be locked on the exit pallet.
