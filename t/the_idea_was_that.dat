5|$|The {{discovery}} of the AdS/CFT correspondence in late 1997 {{was the culmination of}} a long history of efforts to relate string theory to nuclear physics. In fact, string theory was originally developed during the late 1960s and early 1970s as a theory of hadrons, the subatomic particles like the proton and neutron that are held together by the strong nuclear force. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> each of these particles could be viewed as a different oscillation mode of a string. In the late 1960s, experimentalists had found that hadrons fall into families called Regge trajectories with squared energy proportional to angular momentum, and theorists showed that this relationship emerges naturally from the physics of a rotating relativistic string.|$|E
5|$|During the 1920s, many navies were {{pursuing}} the flotilla leader concept, building large destroyers {{similar to the}} World War I Royal Navy V and W-class destroyers. In the interwar French Navy, these ships were known as contre-torpilleurs, and were intended to operate with smaller destroyers, or as half-flotillas of three ships. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> such a half-flotilla could defeat an Italian light cruiser of the Condottieri class. The Navy of the KSCS decided to build three such flotilla leaders, ships that would {{have the ability to}} reach high speeds and with a long endurance. The long endurance requirement reflected Yugoslav plans to deploy the ships into the central Mediterranean, where {{they would be able to}} operate alongside French and British warships.|$|E
5|$|Operation Royal Flush was a {{military}} deception employed by the Allied Nations during the Second World War {{as part of the}} strategic deception Operation Bodyguard. Royal Flush was a political deception which expanded on the efforts of another Bodyguard deception, Operation Graffham, by emphasising the threat to Norway. It also lent support to parts of Operation Zeppelin via subtle diplomatic overtures to Spain and Turkey. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> information from these neutral countries would filter back to the Abwehr (German Intelligence). Planned in April 1944 by Ronald Wingate, Royal Flush was executed throughout June by various Allied ambassadors to the neutral states. During implementation the plan was revised several times to be less extreme in its diplomatic demands. Information from neutral embassies was not well trusted by the Abwehr; as a result, Royal Flush had limited impact on German plans through 1944.|$|E

5|$|The most {{promising}} {{but also the}} most challenging method of isotope separation was gaseous diffusion. Graham's law states {{that the rate of}} effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molecular mass, so in a box containing a semi-permeable membrane and a mixture of two gases, the lighter molecules will pass out of the container more rapidly than the heavier molecules. The gas leaving the container is somewhat enriched in the lighter molecules, while the residual gas is somewhat depleted. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> such boxes could be formed into a cascade of pumps and membranes, with each successive stage containing a slightly more enriched mixture. Research into the process was carried out at Columbia University by a group that included Harold Urey, Karl P. Cohen and John R. Dunning.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{most other}} self-extracting revolvers (such as the Webley service revolvers or the Smith & Wesson No. 3 Revolver), the Enfield Mk I/Mk II was {{complicated}} to unload, having an Owen Jones selective extraction/ejection system {{which was supposed}} to allow the firer to eject spent cartridges, whilst retaining live rounds in the cylinder. The Enfield Mk I/Mk II had a hinged frame, and when the barrel was unlatched, the cylinder would move forward, operating the extraction system and allowing the spent cartridges to simply fall out. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the cylinder moved forward far enough to permit fired cases to be completely extracted (and ejected by gravity), but not far enough to permit live cartridges (i.e., those with projectiles still present, and thus longer in overall length) from being removed in the same manner.|$|E
5|$|With these {{modifications}} {{complete and}} apparently working, the first completely free flight occurred on 12 November 1959. This test proved the nozzle control system unacceptable. The spoilers {{were intended to}} direct the air out over the top or bottom of the annular flap, out the bottom only during hover, but {{over the top and}} bottom during forward flight. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> when the flap was positioned in order to provide control, the lift would be lowered on one side and raised on the other. Lift was indeed lowered on one side, but sadly the lift did not improve on the other, so every control input resulted in a loss of altitude. After five flights, testing was temporarily halted on 5 December 1959, by which time the Avrocar had logged 18.5 hours of test time in total.|$|E

5|$|The German host {{was waiting}} for the Romans, {{probably}} drawn up on the crest of the hill, to give Chnodomar's men the advantage of the slope. The German left wing was held by Chnodomar and his cavalry. Demonstrating that he was well aware of the threat posed by the Roman heavy cavalry, Chnodomar had devised a stratagem. He interspersed lightly armed infantry among his cavalry. These were easy to conceal in the standing grain. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> in a mêlée, the foot soldiers would bring down the cataphracts by crawling along the ground and stabbing their horses in their underbellies, which were unprotected. The dismounted riders, weighed down by their armour, could then easily be despatched on the ground. The German right wing blocked the highway to Strasbourg, while in the woods beyond the highway were a substantial force of warriors hidden in ambush on Chnodomar's orders. The right wing was under his nephew Serapio (who was given his Greek name by his Hellenophile father). Although still a teenager, Serapio had already proved a military leader worthy of his uncle. The rest of the line was probably divided into pagi units under five major kings and ten petty kings.|$|E
5|$|The {{proximity}} fuze {{had been}} pioneered by Alan Butement. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> if a shell could explode {{when it was}} near an enemy aircraft, a near miss would be nearly as effective as a direct hit. The technical problem was to miniaturise a radar set, and make it sturdy enough to be fired from a gun barrel. The second problem had been solved by the Germans; a dud German bomb was salvaged that had valves that could withstand the acceleration. Plans {{were given to the}} Americans by the Tizard Mission, but work continued in Britain, where a team was established at Christchurch under Charles Drummond Ellis in February 1942. Work proceeded fitfully, and by 1943, production was still two years away. On a visit to the United States in November 1943, Cockcroft discussed adapting the American proximity fuze for British use with Merle Tuve. As a result, 150,000 fuzes for QF 3.7-inch AA guns were ordered on 16 January 1944. The fuzes arrived in time to engage the V-1 flying bombs in August 1944, shooting down 97 per cent of them. For his services, he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in June 1944.|$|E

25|$|Nechayev had {{a list of}} 387 {{people who}} were sent 560 parcels of {{leaflets}} for distribution April–August 1869. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the activists would be caught, punished and radicalized.

25|$|Swiss Re's {{low level}} plan met the {{planning}} authority's desire to maintain London's traditional streetscape with its relatively narrow streets. The {{mass of the}} Swiss Re tower was not too imposing. Like Barclays Bank's former City headquarters in Lombard Street, <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the passer-by in neighbouring streets would be nearly oblivious to the tower's existence until directly underneath it.|$|E
25|$|During {{the second}} world war Christchurch was again {{fortified}} against an expected invasion. The construction of pillboxes, gun emplacements and tank traps in and around the town, made Christchurch an 'anti-tank island'. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> an invasion by the German 6th Army from Cherbourg would be unable to link up east to west so long as the town was able to hold out.|$|E
25|$|To {{build the}} party, the DNC under Dean worked in {{partnership}} with state Democratic parties in bringing {{the resources of the}} DNC to bear in electoral efforts, voter registration, candidate recruitment, and other interlocking component elements of party building.

25|$|As {{well as his}} sketch {{designs for}} Britten's opera house, he also {{designed}} a memorial for Britten {{on the beach at}} Aldeburgh. It would have taken the form of a great timber baulk standing vertical on the beach. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> holes drilled in the timber would play notes from Britten's opera Peter Grimes whenever a storm of sufficient power struck. The design was not realised and Cadbury-Brown was not keen on the actual memorial by Maggi Hambling.|$|E
25|$|In 1930, England captain Douglas Jardine, {{together}} with Nottinghamshire's captain Arthur Carr and his bowlers Harold Larwood and Bill Voce, developed {{a variant of}} leg theory in which the bowlers bowled fast, short-pitched balls that would rise into the batsman's body, {{together with}} a heavily stacked ring of close fielders on the leg side. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> when the batsman defended against the ball, he {{would be likely to}} deflect the ball into the air for a catch.|$|E
