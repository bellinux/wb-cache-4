5000|$|The fender {{extension}} on the Apollo 17 LRV broke when accidentally bumped by Eugene Cernan with {{a hammer}} handle. Cernan and Schmitt <b>taped</b> the <b>extension</b> back in place, but due to the dusty surfaces, the tape did not adhere and the extension was lost after about one hour of driving, causing the astronauts to be covered with dust. For their second EVA, a replacement [...] "fender" [...] was made with some EVA maps, duct tape, {{and a pair of}} clamps from inside the Lunar Module that were nominally intended for the moveable overhead light. This repair was later undone so that the clamps could be taken inside for the return launch. The maps were brought back to Earth and are now on display at the National Air and Space Museum. The abrasion from the dust is evident on some portions of the makeshift fender.|$|R
5000|$|Then {{there is}} the Magnasync Nomad, a mechanically-coupled dual-system, circa 1960. It used split-16 reels (2.5" [...] diameter, 100) of {{magnetic}} tape, sprocketed for 16mm film. A camera (Bolex, Kodak Cine Special, B&H 70, Pathe Webo; and factory-modified Auricons or Arris) is docked {{to the top of}} the Nomad. A mechanical transmission interlock cable to the single frame-per=turn gear of the camera, and to the Nomad. The spring of the camera thus also turns the mag tape reels of the Nomad. Alternatively, a 24 fps sync electric motor docks to the Nomad, and turns the camera gears. A connected external amplifier and control handset connects to the Nomad. The <b>tape</b> drive had <b>extension</b> arms for larger 400 mag tape reels. It was a marvel of engineering from the ubiquitous vendor of editing suite 16mm and 35mm sync editing.|$|R
40|$|Ankle equinus is {{the most}} {{commonly}} identified impairment of individuals with spastic hemiplegia (SH). However, {{it is not clear}} how equinus at the ankle may contribute to gait deviations at other joints. The purpose of this study was to determine what compensatory gait deviations may occur as a result of an imposed, unilateral equinus constraint. Gait data were collected on 12 adult subjects with and without one ankle constrained in equinus using a unique <b>taping</b> method. Knee <b>extension</b> at initial contact, knee extension in mid stance, and hip extension at terminal stance were all found to be significantly reduced on the ipsilateral side as a result of the ankle constraint. On the unconstrained or contralateral side, subjects tended to adopt a foot-flat or toe-first initial contact pattern. This study suggests that stance phase limitations in both hip and knee extension in the gait of persons with hemiplegia are not necessarily caused by limited length of the involved side hamstrings and/or hip flexors, but rather that they can occur as the result of an ankle plantarflexor contracture alone. Deviations in the contralateral foot contact pattern can also occur secondary to unilateral equinus and should not be assumed to represent bilateral involvement...|$|R
5000|$|On March 19, {{confronted with}} the [...] "unbelievability" [...] of the crime {{reconstruction}} in León XIII, Carcaño requested to recant and make yet another statement before the examining magistrate. This time, Carcaño {{said that he had}} been drinking, smoking and taking drugs with Del Castillo and [...] "El Cuco" [...] at León XIII. Around midnight, the two males attempted to have sex with Del Castillo, and when she resisted, they beat her and took her to the bedroom, where they threatened her with a navaja and Carcaño raped her, followed by [...] "El Cuco". Afterward, they tied her to the bed with insulating <b>tape</b> and an <b>extension</b> cord. Carcaño punched her hard enough to make her bleed, and they strangled her together. The body was disguised with two trash bags, moved out of the apartment on a wheelchair previously used by Carcaño's dead mother, and thrown in the dumpster while [...] "El Cuco" [...] disposed of the navaja on a sewer. Though autorities were not entirely convinced by this version, it explained the finding of the navaja in the sewer in front of the apartment, the presence of Del Castillo's blood and DNA of both Carcaño and [...] "El Cuco" [...] in the bedroom, the finding of cells belonging to both Carcaño and Del Castillo in the wheelchair's handlers, and the testimony of a neighbor who had met Carcaño {{when he returned to the}} building with the empty wheelchair.|$|R
40|$|Background To {{examine the}} intra and inter-rater {{reliability}} of lumbar {{flexion and extension}} measurements attained using three landmarking methods for dual inclinometry. Methods This was a repeated measures reliability study. Convenience sampling was used to obtain forty volunteer subjects. Two assessors measured a series of lumbar flexion and extension movements using the J-Tech™ dual inclinometer. Three different landmarking methods were used: 1) straight palpation of PSIS and L 1, 2) palpation of PSIS and {{the site of the}} nearest 5 cm interval point closest to L 1 and 3) location of PSIS and 15 cm cephalad. Upon landmarking, adhesive tape was used to mark landmarks and the inclinometer was placed on sites for three trials of flexion and <b>extension.</b> <b>Tape</b> was removed and landmarks were relocated by the same assessor (intra-rater) for an additional three trials; and this process was repeated by a second assessor (inter-rater). Reliability was determined using intra-class correlation coefficients. Results Reliability within a set of three repetitions was very high (ICCs[*] 3 ̆e[*] 0. 90); intra-rater reliability after relocating landmarks was high (ICCs[*] 3 ̆e[*] 0. 80); reliability between therapists was moderate to high (0. 60 [*] 3 ̆e[*]ICCs[*] 3 ̆c[*] 0. 76). Assessment of flexion and extension movements by straight palpation of bony landmarks as in the Straight palpation of PSIS and L 1 method (ICC: Flexion 0. 60; Extension 0. 74) was found to be marginally less reliable than the other two landmarking measurement strategies (ICC: Flexion 0. 66; Extension 0. 76). Conclusion All three methods of land marking are reliable. We recommend the use of the PSIS to 15 cm cephalad method as used in the modified-modified Schobers test as it is the simplest to perform and aligns with current clinical practice...|$|R
40|$|Setting up {{self-help}} groups in Nigeria CUE: In Nigeria, {{as in other}} parts of Africa, there has been in recent years, a huge drift of people from rural to urban areas. Young people in particular are moving in search of amenities like piped water and electricity, and in the hope of finding work. This movement is having negative effects, both by putting more pressure on the cities, and by draining rural areas of their most productive members. To address the problem, the government in Nigeria, assisted by many non-government organisations, has implemented a campaign that is supporting young people in setting up {{self-help groups}}. Adamu Umar Kuyello spoke to Mrs Sara Auta of the Extension and Rural Youth programme, and to Yahaya Usman, a member of a youth organisation in Kaduna state, about the effectiveness of the programme. He began by asking Mrs Auta how the programme is dealing with the problem of rural-urban drift. IN:		?We have realised this problem ? OUT:		? more income for our benefit. DUR?N	 4 ? 01 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Yahaya Usman describing the success achieved by his self-help group in Kaduna state, Nigeria. Transcript Auta	We have realised this problem. And the sole aim of this programme is to organise the youth into viable groups, so that they can get involved in productive activities that can make them reside in the rural areas, and use what they have, so that they can earn a living in the rural areas instead of moving to the cities, where there are no available white collar jobs. Kuyello	Presently what are your various existing youth organisations? Auta	Presently we have youth that are involved in farming. There are both dry season farming activities and wet season farming activities. When we organise them, we encourage them to pick an activity that they are already used to, and activity that they can handle without much problem or difficulty. We have youth groups that are involved in livestock production. We have youth groups that are involved in other income generating activities, like processing of fruits into different snacks and drinks, especially the women, the young girls. We don?t force them to do what we want them to do, but we make sure that we advise them on things that they can actually do, and see the gain, and see the profit, to earn an income {{so that they can be}} self reliant, instead of moving to the cities where there are no white collar jobs available for them. Kuyello	Maybe you have one or two more words to add to these youth so that they can utilise any opportunity given to them? Auta	The youth have the energy, they have the resources. And they are the ones that can actually move this country forward, if given the right guidance and the right opportunity. Usman	We formed this organisation in the year 1991, eleven years ago. We had about thirty members when we formed this group, but now we are more than fifty. Kuyello	What are some of the basic activities that you perform in your organisation? Usman	My own, I belong to a maize group which we started in 1996 with the Sasakawa project. Formerly we were planting maize at random, with large spacing so when this project came now, we were told that the spacing should be limited to such a number, and ridging should be closer. So thereby we gain a lot of ridges, and a lot of stands in our maize plots. Formerly we used to get about 15 bags per hectare, but when this project started we getting around not less than thirty to forty bags per hectare, which doubled the ration of what we were getting before. And also in the dry season we go into dry season farming. Kuyello	What types of crops do you plant in the dry season? Usman	We plant tomato, onion, pepper, carrot, cabbage, lettuce, and cucumber. Kuyello	All these types of activities are meant to prevent youth movement from the rural to the urban centres. How do you see this your organisation helping in this drive? Usman	Well we do a large production now. We usually sell it out to the market, whereby we get a lot of money, and thereby we buy a lot of things for the incoming dry season, and also, even some of us buy implements, machines and all these things, which will prevent us from going to the urban centres. Kuyello	And probably you would like to have a word or two for the other youth organisations? Usman	They should try to work hard, and look at avenues whereby they can go into more production of this, like our maize project that we are doing now. More youth should come in, because at least now when you go to the urban centre there aren?t any white collar jobs, so it is better for us to go into all this production so that we can get more income for our benefit. End of <b>tape.</b> A government <b>extension</b> programme in Nigeria is helping young people to set up self-help groups. Through these young people become engaged in a variety of income-generating activities, including agriculture and food processing.
