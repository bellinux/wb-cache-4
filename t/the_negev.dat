5|$|When <b>the</b> <b>Negev</b> forces {{reached the}} coastal road, they {{realized}} {{that they could not}} continue on their vehicles, which could not travel in the sand dunes {{to the west of the}} road. The vehicles were therefore left with a platoon to the south of Isdud to block a possible Egyptian retreat. The other soldiers continued on foot into the sand dunes in an attempt to flank the Egyptian positions. On the second try, <b>the</b> <b>Negev</b> forces successfully captured several key points in the village, and destroyed a cannon. Nahum Sarig, <b>the</b> <b>Negev</b> Brigade commander, later wrote that the lack of intelligence on the enemy prevented the Israeli force from continuing its assault, while the Egyptians had time to regroup.|$|E
5|$|The IDF's City of Training Bases, under {{construction}} near Beersheba, hopes to bring thousands of soldiers (mostly officers, senior NCOs and other staff) {{to live in}} <b>the</b> <b>Negev,</b> including Arad. According to Orli Yehezkel, CEO of the Ministry for the Development of <b>the</b> <b>Negev</b> and Galilee, said NIS 4.5 million will be invested in Arad, including a subsidy of NIS 1,000 per family per month for two years for families of soldiers wishing to move to Arad.|$|E

2500|$|The {{origin of}} <b>the</b> word <b>negev</b> is from <b>the</b> Hebrew root {{denoting}} 'dry'. In the Bible, <b>the</b> word <b>Negev</b> {{is also used}} for the direction 'south'; some English-language translations use the spelling [...] "Negeb".|$|R
5|$|In {{accordance}} with the 7 March 2007 decision taken by the Ministry for the Development of <b>the</b> <b>Negev</b> and Galilee to move the national archive of Israel from Jerusalem to Arad, a museum is planned, which will display various gifts given to Israeli politicians over the years.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to {{his work at the}} Hebrew University, Joshua Prawer was involved in the creation of other Israeli institutions of higher learning, namely Ben-Gurion University of <b>the</b> <b>Negev</b> and especially the University of Haifa, where he was the first dean and academic chairman in the years 1966-8.|$|E
5|$|Although {{unpalatable}} when consumed raw, when boiled {{the leaves}} of Tephrosia apollinea and numerous other plants are used to make hot drinks by the Bedouin in parts of Sinai and <b>the</b> <b>Negev.</b> But herbal doctors in Oman warn that Tephrosia apollinea can be potentially harmful to humans, and as of 1993 {{it had not been}} fully analyzed chemically to assess the wider impact it could have on health.|$|E
50|$|On November 17, 2014, Gnacadja {{was awarded}} the Jeffery Cook Prize in Desert Architecture at the International Drylands, Deserts and Desertification Conference {{organized}} by Ben-Gurion University of <b>the</b> <b>Negev’s</b> Blaustein Institutes for Desert Research (BIDR).|$|R

50|$|An {{important}} {{geological survey}} was conducted in 1944-1945. The survey included 2,450 samples spread over 2.7 million dunams (2,700 km2). It concluded, among other things, that most of <b>the</b> <b>Negev's</b> soil was deeper than 2 m and of the loess type.|$|R
5|$|Hillel Omer, {{poet and}} writer. Born in the kibbutz in 1926. Served as a scout during the Battle of Mishmar HaEmek, and later {{served in the}} Palmach and fought {{in the south of}} the country with <b>the</b> <b>Negev</b> Brigade. Left the kibbutz in 1954 to Jerusalem. Died in 1990 and is buried in the kibbutz.|$|E
5|$|Holland {{suggests}} {{that under the}} reign of Arab Emperor Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan, even though {{only a small percentage}} of the inhabitants of the Empire was Muslim, Mecca was intentionally yet erroneously portrayed as Muhammad's home and the birthplace of Islam in order to provide the religion with Arabian origins. Holland argues that in doing so, the faith was dissociated from the Jewish or Christian heritage that would have been self evident at a location in <b>the</b> <b>Negev.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ir Ovot {{is located}} {{south of the}} Dead Sea and {{southeast}} of Dimona in the Arabah valley, an arid plain located below <b>the</b> <b>Negev</b> plateau {{and south of the}} Jordan Rift Valley within the larger Great Rift Valley. The settlement abuts the Ein Hatzeva bloc of agricultural villages {{on the opposite side of}} Highway 90 near the Jordanian border, and is within the boundaries of the Arava Regional Council.|$|E
50|$|In <b>the</b> {{southern}} <b>Negev</b> Desert speleothems did {{not grow}} between 185-140 kya (MIS 6), 110-90 (MIS 5.4-5.2), nor after 85 kya nor {{during most of}} the interglacial period (MIS 5.1), the glacial period and Holocene. This suggests that <b>the</b> southern <b>Negev</b> was arid to hyper-arid in these periods.|$|R
50|$|Of the {{remaining}} 11%, 10% live in Bedouin communities in <b>the</b> northwestern <b>Negev.</b> <b>The</b> Bedouin city of Rahat {{is the only}} Arab city in the Southern District {{and it is the}} third largest Arab city in Israel.|$|R
50|$|The railway line {{south of}} the station is being {{extended}} to Beersheba, which will also enable rail service to the towns of Sderot, Ofakim and Netivot in <b>the</b> northern <b>Negev.</b> <b>The</b> new line is expected to open in stages by 2016.|$|R
5|$|It {{has been}} well {{documented}} in sources in Egypt and Sudan. In 1866 the Pharmaceutical Journal stated that it was found as a contaminant in Alexandrian senna, being found in cultivated fields in the valleys to the east and south of Assouan, in the Elephantine Islands, opposite Assouan, along the Nile, and Edfou and Hermonthis. In Israel it grows in the Judean desert, the Dead Sea Valley, <b>the</b> <b>Negev</b> hills and Eilat.|$|E
5|$|Tephrosia apollinea {{is known}} to be toxic to goats. Although it has been used in Oman to treat bronchitis, cough, earache, nasal {{congestion}} and wounds and bone fractures, as of 1993 its wider impact on humans had not been assessed. It {{can be used to make}} indigo dyes, and the leaves and those of other plants are used to make hot drinks by the Bedouin in parts of Sinai and <b>the</b> <b>Negev.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year the Muslims launched an offensive into the Arabah south of Lake Tiberias, taking Al Karak. Other raids penetrated into <b>the</b> <b>Negev</b> reaching {{as far as}} Gaza. The Battle of Yarmouk in 636 resulted in a crushing defeat for the larger Byzantine army; within three years, the Levant had been lost again. By the time of Heraclius's death in Constantinople, on February 11, 641, most of Egypt had fallen as well.|$|E

5|$|Ben Ammi Ben-Israel {{established}} the African Hebrew Israelites of Jerusalem in Chicago, Illinois, in 1966, {{at a time}} when black nationalism was on the rise {{as a response to the}} Civil Rights Movement. In 1969, after a sojourn in Liberia, Ben Ammi and about 30 Hebrew Israelites moved to Israel. Over the next 20 years, nearly 600 more members left the United States for Israel. As of 2006, about 2,500 Hebrew Israelites live in Dimona and two other towns in <b>the</b> <b>Negev</b> region of Israel, where they are widely referred to as Black Hebrews. In addition, there are Hebrew Israelite communities in several major American cities, including Chicago, St. Louis, and Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|Four {{motorized}} {{companies from}} <b>the</b> <b>Negev</b> Brigade left Be'er Tuvia. They {{set up a}} position of 4.2 inch mortars and medium machine guns about midway between Isdud and Beit Daras, to shell Isdud from the southeast. A reinforced company also left Be'er Tuvia and took up positions between Hill 69 and the military base near Nitzanim to cut off Egyptian reinforcements coming from Majdal. The 57th Battalion (consisting of Irgun veterans) left Hatzor to assault Isdud from the northeast. The 53rd Battalion {{was accompanied by a}} reinforced platoon of 44 soldiers from the temporary 58th Battalion (a new recruit unit), which made its way to Nitzanim in order {{to be replaced by a}} more experienced platoon from the 53rd.|$|E
5|$|The {{main points}} of historiographical dispute {{about the battle}} are {{whether or not the}} Egyptians were {{planning}} to advance northward toward Tel Aviv, and whether or not the battle was one of the turning points of the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. On June 18, after the first truce of the war took effect, Nahum Sarig said in a staff meeting, attended by the Minister of Defense, that at the time the Egyptian plans were not clear, but that now their plans were to penetrate <b>the</b> <b>Negev.</b> Ben Gurion, on the other hand, noted in his diary that the Egyptians were set on taking Tel Aviv and advancing north. In 1958, Major General Yitzhak Rabin addressed the issue; he felt that the Egyptian stop at Isdud was the result of technical difficulties, following fifteen days of continuous movement, including battles along the way. This, Rabin thought, along with ground and aerial counterattacks, eventually delayed their drive on Tel Aviv. Later, he said, the Egyptians tried to make contact with the Jordanian forces at Latrun and, after a failed pincer movement, tried to cut <b>the</b> <b>Negev</b> off from Israel. According to Israeli historian Reuven Aharoni, the battle's glorification and idealization suited the sentimental needs of the Israeli people. He believes that there is still no definite {{answer to the question of}} whether or not the Egyptians planning to drive on to Tel Aviv.|$|E

50|$|The {{origin of}} the river is in the Paran Desert of the Sinai Peninsula, and it flows into the estuary of Nahal HaArava. Water flow exists only during flash floods. This is the {{drainage}} basin's largest river, with an area of thousands of square kilometers, creating broad planes that separate <b>the</b> <b>Negev's</b> high north and the Eilat mountains of the south.|$|R
50|$|The plan aims to {{increase}} the population of Beersheba, <b>the</b> <b>Negev's</b> largest city. One of the main projects undertaken there is the Be’er Sheva River Walk, creating a 900 acre park inspired by San Antonio’s River Walk. The plan includes green spaces, an amphitheater for events, a lake for boating and promenades for strolling. The JNF supported cleanup of the riverbed.|$|R
5|$|Beersheba was {{developed}} by the Ottoman Empire from a camel-trading centre on the northern edge of <b>the</b> <b>Negev,</b> halfway between the Mediterranean and the Dead Sea. It was on the railway line which ran from Istanbul to Hafir el Auja (the main Ottoman desert base during the raid on the Suez Canal in 1915 until the EEF advance to Rafa outflanked it), and which was damaged beyond repair in May 1917 during an EEF raid. Beersheba's hospital, army barracks, railway station (with water tower), engine sheds, large storage buildings, and a square of houses, were well-designed and strongly-constructed stone buildings, with red tiled roofs and a German beer garden. The inhabitants of the region from Beersheba northwards varied; the population was mainly Arabs belonging to Sunni Islam, with some Jewish and Christian colonists.|$|E
5|$|Despite Negev's achievements, {{they were}} also given an order to retreat, as the Israeli command {{did not wish to}} fight in broad daylight. The {{retreating}} forces {{had no choice but to}} use a route similar to the ones they came from, which slowed down their movement. Most of the machine guns that they had brought had broken down in the sandy environment, and could not provide them with cover. They were also carrying a multitude of wounded soldiers. Muhammad Naguib decided to use the armored vehicles in his operational reserve against the retreating forces, fearing a possible cut-off from the rest of the Egyptian forces in Palestine. According to Simha Shiloni, commander of <b>the</b> <b>Negev</b> Beasts battalion, the Israelis, especially the wounded, thought that all was lost when this happened. However, the vehicles stopped eventually as they got bogged down in the sands, and the troops made it back to Nitzanim. Sixteen Israeli soldiers were killed in the retreat.|$|E
5|$|On Hill 69 and {{the coastal}} road, the 53rd Battalion intercepted and engaged a {{contingent}} of Egyptian reinforcements from Majdal. After the battles, the 53rd Battalion reported that at 03:00, they had been ready to ambush possible reinforcements, and at 06:00, an Egyptian convoy of two armored vehicles and 4 other vehicles {{made their way to}} Isdud. They were hit by Israeli mines, operated by Avraham Schwarzstein's platoon (see Battle of Nitzanim), and only two vehicles made it out and back to Majdal. At 09:00 the general retreat order was given, and after reaching Nitzanim, Schwarzstein's platoon set out to assist <b>the</b> <b>Negev</b> forces' retreat, helping carry the 20-so casualties. The forces on Hill 69 retreated only at noon to Be'er Tuvia.|$|E
