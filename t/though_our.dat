The album {{was released on}} 13 February 2012 by Virgin Records, following Sandé's winning of the Critic's Choice Award at the BRIT Awards 2012. <b>Though</b> <b>Our</b> Version of Events is her first release, Sandé {{has been active in}} the industry since 2009, most notable appearing on singles by Chipmunk ("Diamond Rings") and Wiley ("Never Be Your Woman"). The album features R, soul and pop music.|$|E
25|$|Dougga was in {{any case}} an early and {{important}} human settlement. Its urban character {{is evidenced by the}} presence of a necropolis with dolmens, the most ancient archaeological find at Dougga, a sanctuary dedicated to Ba'al Hammon, neo-Punic steles, the mausoleum, architectural fragments and a temple dedicated to Masinissa, the remains of which were found during archaeological excavations. Even <b>though</b> <b>our</b> knowledge of the city before the Roman conquest remains very limited, recent archaeological finds have revolutionised the image that we had of this period.|$|E

[...] When asked about any possible influence from MGM's popular 1939 film adaptation of The Wizard of Oz, Lumet stated that [...] "there {{was nothing to be}} gained from [...] other than to make certain we didn't use anything from it. They made a brilliant movie, and even <b>though</b> <b>our</b> concept is different – they're Kansas, we're New York; they're white, we're black, and the score and the books are totally different – {{we wanted to make sure}} that we never overlapped in any area." ...|$|E

2500|$|Ganzfried {{ruled that}} a scroll of Esther with open {{portions}} is invalid, but added that [...] "some authorities validate it" [...] (Keset HaSofer 28:5). When discussing these authorities in his additional notes, Ganzfried cites a list open parashot found in the book Orhot Hayyim, and concludes: [...] "And even <b>though</b> <b>our</b> custom {{is that all of}} these are closed, it nevertheless seems that if some or all of these are open one may read from the scroll with a blessing." [...] These have been listed in the chart below under at [...] "OH" [...] under Keset HaSofer, and they are very similar to what is found in the Tiberian masoretic codices.|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} Lisa Miller Hughes (Eileen Fulton) {{was used}} as the basis to create a primetime spinoff soap Our Private World, (CBS's attempt to duplicate the success of rival network ABC's Peyton Place), with Lisa leaving Oakdale and moving to Chicago, where she married wealthy John Eldridge, but had an affair with his brother Thomas. [...] <b>Though</b> <b>Our</b> Private World only lasted a few months, and Fulton returned to As the World Turns in early 1966, after taking a few months off, remnants of Lisa's time on Our Private World were resurrected 26 years later, when it was revealed in 1992 that Lisa had had a son off-camera, hitherto unknown to viewers, before returning to As the World Turns in 1966. [...] Her son Scott Eldridge tracked her down as an adult, and remained on As the World Turns for several years.|$|E
2500|$|... "We knew {{we could}} have played better in that Test [...] The {{fact that we had}} got so close to the Blacks proved we were close to them in ability, and {{when it came to the}} third Test in Wellington, we had a sense of giving {{everything}} to salvage our reputation. New Zealand had not won a Test match against Australia in Wellington since 1982. Not so long ago, you might think, but let me tell you, that is a lifetime by New Zealand's standards. And what happened that day really angered me. We played as <b>though</b> <b>our</b> lives depended on it; we tackled them as though they were demons; we knocked them back and we kept at them, mercilessly hounding them when they had possession and flattening them in some shuddering tackles. Not surprisingly, it won us the Test, but immediately apparent was the question: why the hell hadn't we played like that in the first two Tests?" ...|$|E

2500|$|At {{the time}} of the Marburg Colloquy, Suleiman the Magnificent was besieging Vienna with a vast Ottoman army. Luther had argued against {{resisting}} the Turks in his 1518 Explanation of the Ninety-five Theses, provoking accusations of defeatism. He saw the Turks as a scourge sent by God to punish Christians, as agents of the Biblical apocalypse that would destroy the antichrist, whom Luther believed to be the papacy, and the Roman Church. He consistently rejected the idea of a Holy War, [...] "as <b>though</b> <b>our</b> people were an army of Christians against the Turks, who were enemies of Christ. This is absolutely contrary to Christ's doctrine and name". On the other hand, in keeping with his doctrine of the two kingdoms, Luther did support non-religious war against the Turks. In 1526, he argued in Whether Soldiers can be in a State of Grace that national defence is reason for a just war. By 1529, in On War against the Turk, he was actively urging Emperor Charles V and the German people to fight a secular war against the Turks.|$|E
2500|$|Pindar's {{strongly}} individual genius {{is apparent}} in all his extant compositions but, unlike Simonides and Stesichorus for example, he created no new lyrical genres. He was however innovative in {{his use of the}} genres he inheritedfor example, in one of his victory odes (Olympian 3), he announces his invention of a new type of musical accompaniment, combining lyre, flute and human voice (<b>though</b> <b>our</b> knowledge of Greek music is too sketchy to allow us to understand the full nature of this innovation). Although he probably spoke Boeotian Greek he composed in a literary language that tended to rely more on the Doric dialect than his rival Bacchylides, but less insistently than Alcman. There is an admixture of other dialects, especially Aeolic and epic forms, and an occasional use of some Boeotian words. He composed 'choral' songs yet {{it is by no means}} certain that they were all sung by choirsthe use of choirs is testified only by the generally unreliable scholiasts. Scholars at the Library of Alexandria collected his compositions in seventeen books organized according to genre: ...|$|E
2500|$|Brown and {{the free}} {{settlers}} were optimistic that they could bring Kansas into the union as a slavery-free state. After the winter snows thawed in 1856, the pro-slavery activists began a campaign to seize Kansas on their own terms. Brown was particularly affected by the sacking of Lawrence in May 1856, in which a sheriff-led posse destroyed newspaper offices and a hotel. Only one man, a Border Ruffian, was killed. Preston Brooks's caning of anti-slavery Senator Charles Sumner in the United States Senate also fueled Brown's anger. A pro-slavery writer, Benjamin Franklin Stringfellow, of the Squatter Sovereign, wrote that [...] " [...] are determined to repel this Northern invasion, and make Kansas a Slave State; <b>though</b> <b>our</b> rivers should be covered {{with the blood of}} their victims, and the carcasses of the Abolitionists should be so numerous in the territory as to breed disease and sickness, we will not be deterred from our purpose". Brown was outraged by both the violence of the pro-slavery forces, and what he saw as a weak and cowardly response by the antislavery partisans and the Free State settlers, whom he described as [...] "cowards, or worse".|$|E

2500|$|Causal {{determinism}} is [...] "the {{idea that}} every event is necessitated by antecedent events and conditions {{together with the}} laws of nature". However, causal determinism is a broad enough term to consider that [...] "one's deliberations, choices, and actions will often be necessary links in the causal chain that brings something about. In other words, even <b>though</b> <b>our</b> deliberations, choices, and actions are themselves determined like everything else, {{it is still the}} case, according to causal determinism, that the occurrence or existence of yet other things depends upon our deliberating, choosing and acting in a certain way". Causal determinism proposes that there is an unbroken chain of prior occurrences stretching back to the origin of the universe. The relation between events may not be specified, nor the origin of that universe. Causal determinists believe that {{there is nothing in the}} universe that is uncaused or self-caused. Historical determinism (a sort of path dependence) can also be synonymous with causal determinism. Causal determinism has also been considered more generally as the idea that everything that happens or exists is caused by antecedent conditions. In the case of nomological determinism, these conditions are considered events also, implying that the future is determined completely by preceding eventsa combination of prior states of the universe and the laws of nature. Yet they can also be considered metaphysical of origin (such as in the case of theological determinism).|$|E
