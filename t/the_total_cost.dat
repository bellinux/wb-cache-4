5|$|In 1945, a B-29 bomber cost $782,000. It cost $32,000 {{to upgrade}} an {{aircraft}} to Silverplate configuration, so <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>cost</b> of a Silverplate bomber was $814,000. <b>The</b> <b>total</b> <b>cost</b> of the 65 wartime Silverplate B-29s was therefore $53 million.

30|$|The first factor, {{geographical}} {{spread of}} the customers, is statistically significant. For clustered customers, <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>costs</b> increase with 11 % on average when allowing customers to select a delivery time window. <b>The</b> percentage of <b>total</b> <b>costs</b> increase is calculated by dividing the additional costs of allowing customers to choose a delivery time window by <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>costs</b> of <b>the</b> basic scenario. For randomly spread customers, <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>costs</b> increase with 24 % on average. When customers are clustered the increase in costs is less than when customers are randomly spread because when customers are spread more randomly probably more distance is needed to travel to another customer with a close delivery time window.|$|R

30|$|For each {{number of}} {{customers}} (50, 100 and 150), 30 instances are generated with clustered customers and 30 instances are generated with randomly spread customers. These instances are first solved for the basic scenario in which customers {{do not have the}} possibility to choose a preferred time window for delivery. These results are <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>costs</b> of <b>the</b> basic scenario. To calculate the additional costs of allowing customers to choose a delivery time window, <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>costs</b> of <b>the</b> basic scenario are subtracted from <b>the</b> <b>total</b> <b>costs</b> found when solving the instances for the different factor levels of the two experimental designs.
