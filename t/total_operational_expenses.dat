40|$|This {{research}} {{purpose to}} analyze production efficiency of Islamic banking industry in Indonesia, especially Sharia Commercial bank (BUS) and Sharia Business Unit. Efficiency is a parameter for measuring banking performance. There are 9 Islamic banks which used as samples {{of this research}} and {{divided into two groups}} of banks, 3 BUS and 6 UUS. This Research use Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) methods to measure the efficiency of Indonesian banking in BUS and UUS. The result of SFA that appear {{in the form of a}} score between 0 - 1, closer to 1 it means a bank more efficient. Variables were chosen based on the intermediation analysis. Input variables in this research are <b>total</b> deposits, <b>operational</b> <b>expenses,</b> and other <b>operational</b> <b>expenses,</b> and the output variable is total financing as the main product of Islamic banking. In order To know the difference of efficiency level of each bank, we used independent sample t- test. The analysis using SFA showing that during 2005 - 2009 the efficiency of BUS and UUS always increase with the average efficiency 0. 976207 for BUS and 0. 969280 for UUS. This is showing that BUS in Indonesia better than UUS in efficiency with the BUS efficiency more optimum in total financing during 2005 - 2009. The average of BUS efficiency and UUS position in 0, 9 of efficiency range level show that BUS and UUS in Indonesia has reach the efficiency level even not until the full of efficiency or 1. Based on the panel to know the impact of input variables to output variable found that <b>total</b> deposits and <b>operational</b> <b>expenses</b> has positif and significant impact to total financing, while other <b>operational</b> <b>expenses</b> has positif impact but not significant to total financing. Finding of independent sample t-test analysis showing that there is no difference in efficiency level between BUS and UUS...|$|R

40|$|Since {{the past}} many years the marine fishery sector of Kerala {{has been and}} {{continues}} {{to be one of the}} major sources of fish. The trend shows that the consumption of fish is on a rise and there has been an unceasing increase of issues pertaining to food secunty in terms of spiraling of the fish prices as well as non-availability of fish. With the decrease in catch per unit effort of fish resources, there is a critical requisite to identify new fishery resources to sustain the fish food security of the country. The marine fishing sector has witnessed vast technological developments in both harvest and post-harvest fisheries during the last few decades. Deep-sea shrimp fishing operations in Kerala started in 1999 with its initial phase registering high landings, but dropped down considerably in the subsequent years. This study was carried out to analyze the economic evaluation of deep-sea shrimp fishery of Kerala. The study was conducted in Sakthikulangara (Kollam District), Vypin and Cochin Fisheries Harbours (Ernakulum District) along the Kerala coast during the period August 2010 - May 2011. The primary data on craft and gear, capital investment, fixed cost, operational cost, catch, species composition and revenue were collected from 90 deep-sea shrimp trawlers. The results indicated that the operational cost for deep-sea shrimp trawlers was very huge when compared to coastal trawlers. The average operational qsts for deep-sea shrimp trawlers targeted for Red ring was Rs. 209391 and the net operating income was Rs. 94163 per trip, whereas, in the case of other deep-sea shrimps the average operating costs and net operating income were Rs. 146737 and Rs. 55870, respectively. Of the <b>total</b> <b>operational</b> cost, <b>expense</b> incurred on fuel was the most significlirt factor contributing 55 percent followed by crew share (22 percent) and ice (7 percent). The study suggests that concerted efforts are required for the sustenance of the sector, which would indisputably contribute additional fish landings for the State and would ensure fish food security...|$|R

40|$|Microfinance {{institutions}} (MFIs) {{are seeing}} high growth in their industry, but faces challenges {{when it comes}} to financial viability. The Norwegian savings banks have one of the world’s most efficient banking systems and have focused on cost-efficiency over a period of 50 years. We examine the possibilities for MFIs being more efficient by learning from Norwegian savings banks. We employ a large dataset of 473 MFIs from 77 different countries spanning 15 years, and 81 Norwegian savings banks spanning 20 years. We find that both industries statistically improve their efficiency with time by reducing <b>operational</b> <b>expenses</b> in percent of total assets. As the <b>operational</b> <b>expenses</b> decrease with time, we additionally test the effect of the MFIs’ age in relation to this decrease. Our panel regressions show that the age of an MFI affect neither <b>operational</b> <b>expenses,</b> nor portfolio yield. This result provides reasons to believe that age does not affect the <b>operational</b> <b>expenses.</b> Further, we find differences in the financial statements and ratios, whereas Norwegian savings banks tend to be more stable, while MFIs are converging towards them. Lastly, we find that technology, domestic cooperation and alliances are the primary actions contributing to the low cost structure in Norway, and that MFIs can learn from this...|$|R
40|$|The {{planning}} of today's telecommunication networks {{is a very}} complex task, because the users and the demanded services as well as the costs to deploy and operate the network are evolving over time. Because of this reason, forecasts are made, which are inaccurate in nature. The dynamic and uncertain character of the input parameters needs {{to be taken into account}} during the network planning process. This PhD dissertation studies some important techno-economic aspects of the planning process, focusing on optical telecommunication networks, which form the basis of a lot of core networks of important telecom operators. Concerning the dynamic character of network traffic and equipment costs, our research compares the use of single period planning, anticipated planning and multi-period planning and their relation with investment selection techniques. Concerning the uncertain character of traffic demand and equipment costs, the well-known techniques using safety margins is evaluated and the use of Real Options thinking (originating from a stock option valuation technique) is illustrated. Furthermore, a lot of attention is given to the development of a cost model for a network operator, paying special attention to <b>operational</b> <b>expenses.</b> An activity-based cost model allows to quantify the <b>operational</b> <b>expenses</b> of the network operator. Therefore, different operational processes like maintenance, repair, service provisioning and pricing/billing are distinguished. The process-based operational expenditures together with the continuous costs of infrastructure (costs for floor space rental, energy consumption, etc.) constitute the <b>total</b> <b>operational</b> expenditures for the telecom operator. Finally, we indicate how the suggested cost models can be applied in a liberalized telecom market...|$|R
