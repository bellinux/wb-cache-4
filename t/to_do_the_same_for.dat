A curiosity of the match was that Liverpool had no number 10 shirt and Leeds had no number 11. Phil Boersma and Eddie Gray both wore number 12.|$|E

Before 1812, while Illinois had a first-grade territorial status, Edwards had vast powers to appoint county and local officials; however, he made it his practice to consider local opinion {{as much as he}} could when making appointments, often giving weight to petitions signed by local residents. He attempted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>for</b> militia officers for a time, letting the men of a unit elect their leaders, but he soon abandoned this policy as impractical.|$|E

The other Australian units were withdrawn earlier by sea and the intention had been <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>for</b> the 2/13th in October 1941, but the convoy scheduled to take the 2/13th out of Tobruk had been repelled by an Axis air attack and the British later asked for the battalion, less its advanced party which had already been evacuated, to remain for the subsequent break out attempt.|$|E
25|$|Ralea's {{energies}} {{were also}} drawn into administrative disputes and professional rivalries. Alongside Brătianu, he fought to obtain Oțetea a permanent {{seat at the}} University of Iași, {{at the expense of}} PNȚ colleague Ioan Hudiță. He tried <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>for</b> Rosetti, but was met with the stiff opposition of linguist Giorge Pascu. Hudiță was particularly vexed by these maneuvers, and, in 1934, asked for a formal inquiry by Parliament, and even for a formal review of Ralea's own 1926 appointment. More privately, Hudiță also claimed that Ralea was having affairs with his female students, and even with younger girls who presented to Ralea for their baccalaureate examination. Such criticism did not dissuade Ralea. In 1937, he also managed to obtain an Iași University chair for Călinescu, in controversial circumstances.|$|E
25|$|Facial {{expressions}} {{can provide}} rapid {{feedback on the}} progress of a dialog between two humans, and soon may be able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>for</b> humans and robots. Robotic faces have been constructed by Hanson Robotics using their elastic polymer called Frubber, allowing a large number of facial expressions due to the elasticity of the rubber facial coating and embedded subsurface motors (servos). The coating and servos are built on a metal skull. A robot should know how to approach a human, judging by their facial expression and body language. Whether the person is happy, frightened, or crazy-looking affects the type of interaction expected of the robot. Likewise, robots like Kismet and the more recent addition, Nexi can produce a range of facial expressions, allowing it to have meaningful social exchanges with humans.|$|E

500|$|Initial {{sales were}} slow, {{because at the}} time {{electronics}} retailers provided low-cost lamp cords to consumers for free or at low prices and audiophiles didn't believe audio cables made a difference in the sound.

500|$|According to {{engineer}} Ryan Hewitt, the track contains [...] "four distinct drum sounds created by old school tape editing." [...] The song was recorded [...] "part-by-part, committing to different sounds by changing relative levels, EQ, and compression throughout," [...] and the engineers would slightly move microphones used to record Barker's drum kit to tailor the natural ambience {{of the home}} it was recorded in.

Coincidentally, Ganesan's first exposure to acting was when he saw a street play on Kattabomman’s life titled Kambalaththaar Kooththu. Krishnasamy completed writing the script in a month's time. The play was launched in Salem on 29 August 1957. Ganesan had invested close to [...] for the sets and costumes. On seeing the play, B. R.

As most of his human colleagues become Combine soldiers, he realizes that Henderson has no immediate intention <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>for</b> him, citing his incompetence. Demanding to become one with the Combine, Frohman willingly sets off to Nova Prospekt, an alien security and detention installation, for invasive surgery to convert him. Meanwhile, he selects Ravenholm as a residence where he can commute to and from City 17, but lacks proper transport with which to get there. After a failed attempt to reach Ravenholm using Dr. Isaac Kleiner's teleporter leaves him stuck in a [...] server for a week, he seeks Ravenholm by foot instead. Traveling through City 17's canals, Frohman arrives, badly injured and dazed, at Black Mesa East, the headquarters of the human resistance, where he is welcomed as a helper. His stay there is cut short because he causes trouble in the base, and also irritatingly overuses the gravity gun. He is fooled into leaving the base, and finally heads toward and reaches Ravenholm.|$|E

His son, John Grundy, Jr., took over after the death of his father in 1748, and spent nearly £10,000 on bank repairs between then and 1764. He rebuilt Perry's sluice soon after 1750, with taller doors and a set of tide gates to prevent the tide moving upstream, and rebuilt the navigation lock in 1754. After 1764, Thomas Hogard became the surveyor of works, but Grundy continued to act as a consultant engineer.|$|E
