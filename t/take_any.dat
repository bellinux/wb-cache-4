5|$|In 1915, after {{most of his}} {{students}} in Trieste were conscripted {{to fight in the}} First World War, Joyce moved to Zurich.

Under Wałęsa's leadership, Solidarity decided to pursue a peaceful solution, and the pro-violence faction never attained any substantial power, nor did it <b>take</b> <b>any</b> action.|$|E

Bragg held an ineffective siege against Chattanooga, {{but refused to}} <b>take</b> <b>any</b> further action as the Union forces there were reinforced by Ulysses S.

Bragg retaliated by reducing Buckner to division command and abolishing the Department of East Tennessee.|$|E
5|$|As of June 2017, Emirates has 48 orders {{outstanding}} {{but due to}} lack {{of space}} in Dubai Airport, it deferred 12 deliveries by one year and will not <b>take</b> <b>any</b> in 2019-20 before replacing its early airliners from 2021: there are open production slots in 2019 and Airbus reduced its production rate at 12 per year for 2017-18. The real backlog is much smaller than the official 107 with 47 uncertain orders: 20 commitments for the A380-specialized lessor Amedeo which commits to production only once aircraft are placed, eight for Qantas which wants to keep its fleet at 12, six for Virgin Atlantic which does not want them anymore and three ex Transaero for finance vehicle Air Accord.|$|E
5|$|Bridges {{and other}} key points were {{prepared}} for demolition at short notice by preparing chambers filled with explosives. A Depth Charge Crater was a site in a road (usually at a junction) prepared with buried explosives that could be detonated to instantly form a deep crater as an anti-tank obstacle. The Canadian pipe mine (later known as the McNaughton Tube after General Andrew McNaughton) was a horizontally bored pipe packed with explosives– once in place this {{could be used to}} instantly ruin a road or runway. Prepared demolitions had the advantage of being undetectable from the air—the enemy could not <b>take</b> <b>any</b> precautions against them, or plot a route of attack around them.|$|E

5|$|During 18 August 1940, Luftwaffe units flew a {{total of}} 970 sorties over Britain: some 495 by medium bombers, 460 by fighters and 15 by {{reconnaissance}} units. Of this total, about 170 of the bomber sorties were flown {{on the night of}} 17/18 August; the remainder were flown during the daylight hours on 18 August. Less than half of the available (or serviceable) aircraft on the Luftflotte 2 and Luftflotte 3 order of battle were involved in the action that day, so {{it was clear that the}} Luftwaffe was not greatly extended in providing forces for the offensive. Luftflotte 5 did not <b>take</b> <b>any</b> part in the fighting, although its reconnaissance aircraft were active over England and Scotland.|$|E
5|$|During the 17 May 1992 Fairchild air show, Holland {{was again}} the command pilot of the B-52 aerial-demonstration flight. During the demonstration, Holland's {{aircraft}} again violated several safety regulations, including several low-altitude, steep turns {{in excess of}} 45° of bank and a high pitch angle climb, estimated at over 60° nose high which Holland finished with a wingover maneuver. The new wing commander, Colonel Michael G. Ruotsala, apparently took no action. One week later, the new DO, Colonel Capotosti, on his own initiative warned Holland that if he violated any more safety regulations, Capotosti would ground him (remove him from flying status). Capotosti did not document his warning to Holland or <b>take</b> <b>any</b> other kind of formal action.|$|E

Weston has thus far refused to <b>take</b> <b>any</b> medications voluntarily. His lawyers helped enable this, {{in order to protect}} him from the death penalty. In May 2001, a federal judge authorized doctors to treat Weston involuntarily. A panel from a federal appeals court ruled in July 2001 that Weston could be forced to take the drugs which he was forced to do for 120 days. He remains in the Butner facility indefinitely.|$|E

The {{killing of a}} student demonstrator and Sukarno's order for the disbandment of KAMI in February 1966 further galvanised public opinion against the president. On 11 March 1966, the appearance of unidentified troops around Merdeka Palace during a cabinet meeting (which Suharto had not attended) forced Sukarno to flee to Bogor Palace (60km away) by helicopter. Three Suhartoist generals, Major-General Basuki Rahmat, Brigadier-General M Jusuf, and Brigadier-General Amirmachmud went to Bogor to meet Sukarno. There, they Persuaded and secured a presidential decree from Sukarno (see Supersemar) that gave Suharto authority to <b>take</b> <b>any</b> action necessary to maintain security.|$|E

They were upset at having missed the chance to fight their old enemies, and so on August 10, General Scott sent 100 of them after a part of the British Band that had escaped. Indian agent Samuel C. Stambaugh, who accompanied them, urged the Menominees not to <b>take</b> <b>any</b> scalps, but Chief Grizzly Bear insisted that such a prohibition could not be enforced. The group tracked down about ten Sauks, only two of whom were warriors. The Menominees killed and scalped the warriors, but spared the women and children.|$|E

5|$|On 16 May, tens of {{thousands}} of university students demanding Suharto’s resignation, occupied the grounds and roof of the parliament building. Upon Suharto's return to Jakarta, he offered to resign in 2003 and to reshuffle his cabinet. These efforts failed when his political allies deserted him by refusing to join the proposed new cabinet. According to Wiranto, on 18 May, Suharto issued a decree which provided authority to him to <b>take</b> <b>any</b> measures to restore security; however, Wiranto decided not to enforce the decree to prevent conflict with the population. On 21 May 1998, Suharto announced his resignation, upon which vice-president Habibie assumed the presidency in accordance with the constitution.|$|E
