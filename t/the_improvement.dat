5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>improvements,</b> <b>the</b> Court observed, were {{received}} by the taxpayer [...] "as {{a result of a}} business transaction," [...] namely, the leasing of the taxpayer's land. It was not necessary to the recognition of gain that <b>the</b> <b>improvements</b> be severable from the land. All that had to be shown was that the taxpayer had acquired valuable assets from his lease in exchange for the use of his property. The medium of exchange—whether cash or in kind, and whether separately disposable or [...] "affixed"—was immaterial as far as the realization criterion was concerned. In effect, <b>the</b> <b>improvements</b> represented rent, or rather a payment in lieu of rent, which was taxable to the landlord regardless of the form in which it was received.|$|R
