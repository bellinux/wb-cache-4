25|$|Between {{the major}} {{excavations}} by Kempinski {{and the ongoing}} Tel Kabri Archaeological Project, two separate minor excavations were conducted by Dina Shalem and Howard Smithline. In 1999, Shalem headed up a salvage excavation ahead of a construction project on the Mandate period road running through the tel. Her team worked in Area D and came across EB architecture, {{as well as some}} Chalcolithic sherds and a possible surface from that period. In 2004, the Israeli telecommunications company, Cellcom, was laying down new <b>telephone</b> <b>cable</b> near Area E, and Smithline was asked to conduct a salvage excavation before the work started. He used {{this as an opportunity to}} investigate further the Iron Age aspects of the site. His team did not make any new discoveries, but did add to the collection of Iron Age I (1,200–1,000 BC) and Iron Age II (1,000–586 BC) pottery from the site.|$|E
25|$|The major {{economic}} {{activity in the}} parish is agriculture and the parish encompasses several large farms. Most agriculture centres around dairying, with arable crops such as potato and cauliflower being farmed {{as well as some}} raising of pigs and sheep. As with much of Cornwall, fishing is an important source of income and employment. Many smaller crabbers and landline fishermen operate from the various coves and harbours on the rocky shore. Before its closure {{at the turn of the}} millennium the transatlantic <b>telephone</b> <b>cable</b> station, and telecommunications educational facility, run by Cable and Wireless at Porthcurno provided further employment opportunities in the neighbouring parish of St Levan. Its central location in west Penwith and proximity to popular tourist attractions such as the Minack Theatre, Land's End and the Blue Flag beach at Sennen Cove, mean that St Buryan enjoys a healthy income from visitors, both day trippers and those renting accommodation, during the summer months.|$|E

The advance would begin up a short rise to the near edge of the Steenbeek Valley, then up the steep rise from the valley floor between Hell and Sloping Roof Farms to Four Huns, Chest and Middle Farms on the main ridge, with Lumm Farm on the left flank of the objective. Artillery emplacements for the 25th divisional artillery and 112th Army Field Brigade were built and the Guards Division field artillery was placed in concealed forward positions.

500|$|Nominal {{impedance}} {{first started}} to be specified {{in the early days}} of telecommunications. [...] At first amplifiers were not available and when they did become available they were expensive. [...] It was consequently necessary to achieve maximum power transfer from the cable at the receiving end in order to maximise the lengths of cables that could be installed. [...] It also became apparent that reflections on the transmission line would severely limit the bandwidth that could be used or the distance that it was practicable to transmit. [...] Matching equipment impedance to the characteristic impedance of the cable reduces reflections (and they are eliminated altogether if the match is perfect) and power transfer is maximised. [...] To this end, all cables and equipment {{started to be}} specified to a standard nominal impedance. [...] The earliest, and still the most widespread, standard is 600 Ω, originally used for telephony. [...] It has to be said that the choice of this figure had more to do with the way telephones were interfaced into the local exchange than any characteristic of the local <b>telephone</b> <b>cable.</b> [...] Telephones (old style analogue telephones) connect to the exchange through twisted pair cabling. [...] Each leg of the pair is connected to a relay coil which detect the signalling on the line (dialling, handset off-hook etc.). [...] The other end of one coil is connected to a supply voltage and the second coil is connected to ground. [...] A telephone exchange relay coil is around 300 Ω so the two of them together are terminating the line in 600 Ω.|$|E
2500|$|The decibel {{originates}} from {{methods used}} to quantify signal loss in telegraph and telephone circuits.

2500|$|Campbell was {{struggling}} {{to set up a}} practical demonstration over a real telephone route with the budget he had been allocated. [...] After considering that his artificial line simulators used lumped components rather than the distributed quantities found in a real line, he wondered if he could not insert the inductance with lumped components instead of using Stone's distributed line. [...] When his calculations showed that the manholes on telephone routes were sufficiently close together to be able to insert the loading coils without the expense of either having to dig up the route or lay in new cables he changed to this new plan. [...] The very first demonstration of loading coils on a <b>telephone</b> <b>cable</b> was on a 46-mile length of the so-called Pittsburgh cable (the test was actually in Boston, the cable had previously been used for testing in Pittsburgh) on 6 September 1899 carried out by Campbell himself and his assistant.

2500|$|A common {{application}} of loading coils {{is to improve}} the voice-frequency amplitude response characteristics of the twisted balanced pairs in a <b>telephone</b> <b>cable.</b> [...] Because twisted pair is a balanced format, half the loading coil must be inserted in each leg of the pair to maintain the balance. [...] It is common for both these windings to be formed on the same core. [...] This increases the flux linkages, without which the number of turns on the coil would need to be increased.|$|E
