5|$|The well-studied CAS {{proteins}} BCAR1 and NEDD9 {{have important}} roles in cancer and other pathological conditions, which have been addressed in many studies and reviews. EFS has attracted less study. However, the conserved functional properties of EFS relevant to cellular adhesion and migration, and RTK signaling, suggest changes in activity of this protein may also be relevant to cancer and other disease states, influencing prognosis and <b>therapeutic</b> <b>response.</b> The changes in EFS expression and post-translational modification {{in the context of}} disease discussed below are summarized in Table 2.|$|E
25|$|People with {{narcolepsy}} can {{be substantially}} helped, but not cured. Treatment is {{tailored to the}} individual, based on symptoms and <b>therapeutic</b> <b>response.</b> The time required to achieve optimal control of symptoms is highly variable and may take several months or longer. Medication adjustments are frequently necessary, and complete control of symptoms is seldom possible. While oral medications are the mainstay of formal narcolepsy treatment, lifestyle changes are also important.|$|E
25|$|However, “there is no {{evidence}} that the pathophysiology or <b>therapeutic</b> <b>response</b> is substantially different for hypersomnia with or without SOREMPs on the MSLT.” Given this currently understood overlap of idiopathic hypersomnia and narcolepsy, the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-V) is also updating its classification of the primary hypersomnias. It reclassifies narcolepsy without cataplexy as major somnolence disorder (MSD). Additionally, MSD will encompass all syndromes of hypersomnolence not explained by low orexin concentrations, including idiopathic hypersomnia (with and without long sleep time) and long sleepers (people requiring >10hours sleep/day).|$|E

25|$|The {{presence}} of HPV within the tumour has been realised {{to be an}} important factor for predicting survival since the 1990s. Tumor HPV status is strongly associated with positive <b>therapeutic</b> <b>response</b> and survival compared with HPV-negative cancer, independent of the treatment modality chosen and even after adjustment for stage. While HPV+OPC patients have a number of favourable demographic features compared to HPV-OPC patients, such differences account for only about ten per cent of the survival difference seen between the two groups. Response rates of over 80% are reported in HPV+ cancer and three-year progression free survival has been reported as 75–82% and 45–57%, respectively, for HPV+ and HPV- cancer, and improving over increasing time. It is likely that HPV+OPC is inherently less maligant than HPV-OPC, since patients treated by surgery alone have a better survival after adjustment for stage. In one study, less than 50% of patients with HPV-OPC were still alive after five years, compared to more than 70% with HPV+OPC and an equivalent stage and disease burden.|$|E
500|$|Because NEDD9 {{serves as}} a {{scaffolding}} molecule for other signaling proteins that play significant roles in cancer development, the effects of NEDD9 overexpression in supporting metastasis could in theory be mitigated by inhibition of its downstream targets. In one study, deletion of Nedd9 in MMTV-neu mammary tumors increased their sensitivity to inhbitiors of FAK and SRC. NEDD9 depletion sensitizes breast tumor cell lines to the Aurora A inhibitor alisertib. [...] Consideration of NEDD9 as a biomarker for <b>therapeutic</b> <b>response</b> is a promising research direction.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2013 the FDA {{released}} the observational notes from an inspection of Burzynski {{as a principal}} investigator that took place between January and March 2013. Among the findings were “ to comply with protocol requirements related to the primary outcome, <b>therapeutic</b> <b>response</b> , for 67% of study subjects reviewed during the inspection,” admitting patients who failed to meet inclusion criteria, failing to stop treatment when patients had severe toxic reactions to antineoplastons, and failure to report all adverse events. Further, the FDA told Burzynski, [...] "You failed to protect the rights, safety, and welfare of subjects under your care. Forty-eight (48) subjects experienced 102 investigational overdoses between January 1, 2005 and February 22, 2013 [...] There is no documentation {{to show that you}} have implemented corrective actions during this time period to ensure the safety and welfare of subjects.” The FDA also observed that Burzynski had denied patients informed consent by not informing them of extra costs that they might incur during treatment and that he could not account for his stock of the investigational drug. Lastly, the FDA observed: [...] "Your [...] tumor measurements initially recorded on worksheets at baseline and on-study treatment [...] studies for all study subjects were destroyed and are not available for FDA inspectional review", meaning {{that there was no way}} for the FDA to verify either initial tumor sizes or effects that the antineoplastons may have had.|$|E
2500|$|Pharmacogenomics aims {{to develop}} {{rational}} means to optimize drug therapy, {{with respect to}} the patients' genotype, to ensure maximum efficacy with minimal adverse effects. [...] Through the utilization of pharmacogenomics, it is hoped that pharmaceutical drug treatments can deviate from what is dubbed as the [...] "one-dose-fits-all" [...] approach. Pharmacogenomics also attempts to eliminate the trial-and-error method of prescribing, allowing physicians to take into consideration their patient's genes, the functionality of these genes, and how this may affect the efficacy of the patient's current or future treatments (and where applicable, provide an explanation for the failure of past treatments). Such approaches promise the advent of precision medicine and even personalized medicine, in which drugs and drug combinations are optimized for narrow subsets of patients or even for each individual's unique genetic makeup. Whether used to explain a patient's response or lack thereof to a treatment, or act as a predictive tool, it hopes to achieve better treatment outcomes, greater efficacy, minimization of the occurrence of drug toxicities and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). For patients who have lack of <b>therapeutic</b> <b>response</b> to a treatment, alternative therapies can be prescribed that would best suit their requirements. In order to provide pharmacogenomic recommendations for a given drug, two possible types of input can be used: genotyping or exome or whole genome sequencing. Sequencing provides many more data points, including detection of mutations that prematurely terminate the synthesized protein (early stop codon).|$|E

The two experimental groups received tokens during phases of contingent reinforcement for 2 ̆ 2 <b>Therapeutic</b> <b>Responses</b> 2 ̆ 2 and under a yoked-control phase of non-contingent token reinforcement; the sequence of these phases was the major difference between the two experimental groups.

Results clearly supported the hypotheses that <b>therapeutic</b> <b>responses</b> did occur significantly more frequently and for longer durations in both the experimental groups in the following predicted directions: (1) under conditions of contingent token reinforcement as compared to conditions of non-contingent token reinforcement and to baseline and extinction phases; (2) in both of the experimental groups as compared to the control group.
