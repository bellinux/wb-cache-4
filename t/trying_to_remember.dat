25|$|One of {{the reasons}} there are textual {{problems}} {{is that there was}} no copyright of writings at the time. As a result, Shakespeare and the playing companies he worked with did not distribute scripts of his plays, for fear that the plays would be stolen. This led to bootleg copies of his plays, which were often based on people <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> what Shakespeare had actually written.|$|E
25|$|Spatial {{memory is}} a person’s {{knowledge}} of the space around them, and their whereabouts in it. It also encompasses all memories of areas and places, {{and how to get}} to and from them. Spatial memory is distinct from object memory and involves different parts of the brain. Spatial memory involves the dorsal parts of the brain and more specifically the hippocampus. However many times both types of memory are used together, such as when <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> where you put a lost object. A classic test of spatial memory is the Corsi block-tapping task, where an instructor taps a series of blocks in a random order and the participant attempts to imitate them. The amount of blocks they can tap before performance breaks down on average is called their Corsi span. Spatial memory is always being used whenever a person is moving any part of their body; therefore it is generally more vulnerable to decay than object memory is.|$|E

The play in which he starred, You Never Can Tell, transferred to the Haymarket Theatre that December having made its debut at the Theatr Clwyd in Wales earlier that year. It was the second time the actor had appeared in the play, the first being back in Bristol fifty years previously when he starred as the youthful lead, Valentine. This time he was cast as William, the elderly waiter, a part which he considered to be [...] "a real hell to play", partly because of the many meals he had to serve up on stage, whilst at the same time <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> the complex script. [...] He enjoyed the play immensely and was thrilled at its successful run.

500|$|The Avatar Meher Baba Charitable Trust, {{established}} by Meher Baba in 1959, maintains his tomb and pilgrimage facilities, {{as well as}} a free school and dispensary, a cataract clinic, and a veterinary clinic. The Trust follows the charter left for it by Meher Baba in his lifetime, but does not act as spiritual authority over groups. Likewise, the Trust does not engage in propaganda, promote creeds or dogmas, or seek converts. Baba discouraged evangelizing, stating, [...] "I need no propaganda or publicity." [...] Rather, he encouraged his followers to [...] "let your life itself be my message of love and truth to others" [...] and to [...] "spread my message of Love and Truth as far and wide as possible". Followers of Meher Baba have no established rituals. Many do, however, perform practices of choice such as pujas, aartis, prayers, music, plays, viewing films of Baba and so forth, but the choice is personal. The primary focus for followers is living a life Meher Baba would approve of, for example, refraining from the use of psychedelic drugs, including marijuana, and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> God with love.|$|E
