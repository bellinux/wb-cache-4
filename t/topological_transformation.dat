It introduces a new methodology, called “Splitting MAT”, which integrates into masses-interactions modelling. This methodology enables modelling topological discontinuities not on an interaction element, but directly on a mass element. The principles of the Splitting MAT method are presented and then illustrated through various models featuring <b>topological</b> <b>transformations</b> due to large physics based deformations.

40|$|AbstractWe {{introduce}} {{the notion of}} computational network (CN) which is a general model of an arbitrary (finite or infinite) system of parallel synchronized processors (systolic network). Our basic and very useful tools are <b>topological</b> <b>transformations</b> of the space-time diagrams (unrollings) of computations on CN. We show that the <b>topological</b> <b>transformations</b> on unrollings {{can be used to}} design systolic networks, to give simple proofs of their correctness, and to demonstrate the equivalence of different networks. For example, we usedthe transformation technique to give a concise proof of a strengthened version of Leiserson's and Saxe's Retiming lemma and Systolic Conversion Theorem. As a practical application we show the correctness of a simple algorithm for distributed sorting on a systolic ring. Many other examples are given...|$|R

40|$|Surfaces are {{described}} as a two-dimensional random froth, the dual of the "fisherman's net". Its geometry and fluctuations are seen as local, elementary <b>topological</b> <b>transformations</b> (dissociation and motion of dislocations and disclinations). These transformations are the "collisions" responsible for statistical equilibrium of the structure, characterized by observable relations (Aboav. Lewis).

40|$|An advection-diffusion {{model has}} been set up to {{describe}} normal grain growth. In this model grains are divided into different groups according to their topological classes (number of sides of a grain). <b>Topological</b> <b>transformations</b> are modelled by advective and diffusive flows governed by advective and diffusive coefficients respectively, which are assumed to be proportional to topological classes. The ordinary differential equations governing self-similar time-independent grain size distribution can be derived analytically from continuity equations. It is proved that the time-independent distributions obtained by solving the ordinary differential equations have the same form as the time-dependent distributions obtained by solving the continuity equations. The advection-diffusion model is extended to describe the stagnation of normal grain growth in thin films. Grain boundary grooving prevents grain boundaries from moving, and the correlation between neighbouring grains accelerates the stagnation of normal grain growth. After introducing grain boundary grooving and the correlation between neighbouring grains into the model, the grain size distribution is close to a lognormal distribution, which is usually found in experiments. A vertex computer simulation of normal grain growth has also been carried out to make a cross comparison with the advection-diffusion model. The result from the simulation did not verify the assumption that the advective and diffusive coefficients are proportional to topological classes. Instead, we have observed that <b>topological</b> <b>transformations</b> usually occur on certain topological classes. This suggests that the advection-diffusion model can be improved by making a more realistic assumption on <b>topological</b> <b>transformations.</b> (author) SIGLEAvailable from British Library Document Supply Centre-DSC:DXN 053106 / BLDSC - British Library Document Supply CentreGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

30|$|As Figure 2 shows, PLS is {{executed}} {{twice for}} this concrete application. During the fast PLS, <b>topological</b> <b>transformations</b> are enabled so the active contours can be merged or split. This operation {{is needed to}} improve accuracy to remove isolated regions generated by the erosions required for the initial contour estimation. In this stage, the inflated potential is the main responsible of the evolution because the contour {{is far from the}} real vessels location and the rest of potentials are too weak to carry out this task. The aim of this stage is to evolve the contour to get it close to the vessels. It is called fast because a small number of iterations are needed. During the second PLS iteration, the slow PLS, <b>topological</b> <b>transformations</b> are disabled. The external potential is now in charge of the guidance of the contour evolution and the internal potential prevents the evolution through small cavities or discontinuities in the vessels topology. The accuracy of the result depends deeply on this stage, so a higher number of iterations are needed (slow evolution). Between both stages, a hole-filling operation is included in order to meet greater accuracy, removing isolated holes inside the active contours.|$|R
40|$|Abstract A {{variety of}} {{modeling}} frameworks {{have been proposed}} and utilized in complex systems studies, including dynamical systems models that describe state transitions on a system of fixed topology, and self-organizing network models that describe <b>topological</b> <b>transformations</b> of a network with little attention paid to dynamical state changes. Earlier network models typically assumed that <b>topological</b> <b>transformations</b> are caused by exogenous factors, such as preferential attachment of new nodes and stochastic or targeted removal of existing nodes. However, many real-world complex systems exhibit both of these two dynamics simultaneously, and they evolve largely autonomously based on the system’s own states and topologies. Here we show that, by using the concept of graph rewriting, both state transitions and autonomous topology transformations of complex systems can be seamlessly integrated and represented in a unified computational framework. We call this novel modeling framework “Generative Network Automata (GNA) ”. In this chapter, we introduce basic concepts of GNA, its working definition, its generality to represent other dynamical systems models, {{and some of our}} latest results of extensive computational experiments that exhaustively swept over possible rewriting rules of simple binary-state GNA. The results revealed several distinct types of the GNA dynamics. ...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Several {{studies suggest}} that the {{image-based}} approach to object recognition can be extended to basic level recognition, {{but it is not clear}} yet how basic level recognition is achieved. It seems that the shapes of category members on the basic level can be aligned by rather simple topological (warping) transformations — for most biological and many artifact categories. This study was motivated by the hypothesis that basic level recognition involves analog <b>topological</b> <b>transformation</b> processes — in order to achieve an alignment of stimulus representation and object representation. Two research questions were investigated: (1) Does categorization performance depend on the amount of <b>topological</b> <b>transformation?</b> (2) If systematic effects can be detected, are these effects caused by analog transformation processes? Methods: Images from 16 biological and 14 artifact categories were scanned. On the basis of two members of a category, with morphing software new exemplars were produced as intermediate morphs at specific transformational distances. In every trial two backward masked images were presented sequentially (sequential matching task). The transformational distance between the two images was varied. Subjects had to decide by key press whether both images belonged to the same basic level category or not. Results: The predictions were confirmed by the data: Both RTs and error rates increased with increasing amount of <b>topological</b> <b>transformation</b> between two objects of the same category. Furthermore, RTs are sequentially additive, which is evidence that the <b>topological</b> <b>transformation</b> traverses intermediate points in the transformational path. Conclusions: Taken together, the data indicate that basic level recognition relies on time-consuming and error-prone <b>topological</b> <b>transformation</b> processes, which have an analog nature. The results support a model of basic level recognition that is based on analog (image-like) representations and analog transformation processes...|$|E

40|$|The {{investigation}} {{objects are}} the <b>topological</b> <b>transformation</b> groups. The basic {{attention has been}} given to the problem on the characterization of the G-spaces owing to what the injective objects of the different equivariant categories have been subjected to the detailed investigation. The characterization of the Menger's m-dimensional universal compacts with free action of the zero-dimensional group has been obtained; the properties of such compacts have been studied, and also their connection with the Hilbert - Smith hypothesis has been determined. The characteristic criterion of the varieties modelled by an equivariant Hilbert's cube has been determined; the West problems about these varieties have been solved. Theorems about describing the injective objects of the different equivariant categories have been proved.

40|$|International audienceAnimation of <b>topological</b> <b>transformations,</b> such as fractures, cracks, tears, {{crumbles}} or fragmentations, is a {{new challenge}} in Computer Graphics and Animation. We propose {{a new way to}} model and animate topological changes, allowing the programmer to design any type of topological changes and animation mapping. This model is based on organizing the complex modeling activity into three clearly defined simpler sub-activities: 1) point-based animation, which enables a wide variety of possible temporal phenomena; 2) topological-based modeling, which makes it possible to manage a wide variety of shapeindependent topologies and topological transformations; 3) free, non predetermined, association between both, and 4) final output of an animated geometrical model exhibiting any complex behavior. We experimented the proposed method by modeling tearing effects on deformable garments, on rifts and crack effects on 3 D objects, and finally by modeling imaginary and paradoxical <b>topological</b> <b>transformations</b> associated with realistic Physics-based animation. Besides improving the consistency and the robustness of the modeling process of such complex phenomena, our aim is also to offer a user-centered programming environment to the Computer Graphics and Animation programmers and designers, to enlarge their modeling and experimentation abilities, and to stimulate their creativity...|$|R

40|$|Two discoveries {{demonstrate}} that hexagon type spatial rigid bar structures built of tetrapod shaped superelements {{are the best}} for solving of optimal lattice and optimal two dimensional multiscale tessellation problems. Unexplored, however, remain the <b>topological</b> <b>transformations</b> and multiscale tessellation possibilities of regular spatial lattices space in analogy to the 2 dimensional transformations considered so far. Therefore this article concentrates specifically on derivation of hexagon type spatial lattices and the multiscale tessellation compatibility possibilities of the spatial lattice cells obtained. In {{order to determine the}} shapes of the regular spatial hexagonal lattices, two choices are available. The first one is to apply <b>topological</b> <b>transformations</b> to spheres, placed at regular points in space. The second one is to search for all unique combinations of the superelements. However, both of the approaches ask for proof that all possible lattice configurations have been found. A combined approach is to use the 2 dimensional hexagonal lattice {{as a starting point for}} expanding to three dimensions. This yields two unique spatial hexagon type cell analogues and, consequently, two lattice variants. Considering multiscale tessellation possibility of the lattices, an examination of multiscaled lattice cell vertex coincidence reveals that repeating patterns do exist for the second lattice variant...|$|R
