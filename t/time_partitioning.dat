40|$|Trends in {{incidence}} or {{mortality rates}} over a specified time interval are usually {{described by the}} conventional annual per cent change (cAPC), under the assumption of a constant rate of change. When this assumption does not hold over the entire time interval, the trend may be characterized using the annual per cent changes from segmented analysis (sAPCs). This approach assumes that the change in rates is constant over each <b>time</b> <b>partition</b> defined by the transition points, but varies among different <b>time</b> <b>partitions.</b> Different groups (e. g. racial subgroups), however, may have different transition points and thus different <b>time</b> <b>partitions</b> over which they have constant rates of change, making comparison of sAPCs problematic across groups over a common time interval of interest (e. g. the past 10 years). We propose a new measure, the average annual per cent change (AAPC), which uses sAPCs to summarize and compare trends for a specific time period. The advantage of the proposed AAPC is that it {{takes into account the}} trend transitions, whereas cAPC does not and can lead to erroneous conclusions. In addition, when the trend is constant over the entire time interval of interest, the AAPC has the advantage of reducing to both cAPC and sAPC. Moreover, because the estimated AAPC is based on the segmented analysis over the entire data series, any selected subinterval within a single <b>time</b> <b>partition</b> will yield the same AAPC estimate—that is it will be equal to the estimated sAPC for that <b>time</b> <b>partition.</b> The cAPC, however, i...|$|R

40|$|Background: One major {{challenge}} in understanding how biodiversity is organized is finding out whether communities of competing species are shaped exclusively by species-level differences in ecological traits (niche theory), exclusively by random processes (neutral theory of biodiversity), or by both processes simultaneously. Communities of species competing for a pulsed resource are a suitable system for testing these theories: due to marked fluctuations in resource availability, the theories yield very different {{predictions about the}} timing of resource use and the synchronization of the population dynamics between the competing species. Accordingly, we explored mechanisms that might promote the local coexistence of phytophagous insects (four sister species of the genus Curculio) competing for oak acorns, a pulsed resource. Methodology/Principal Findings: We analyzed the <b>time</b> <b>partitioning</b> of the exploitation of oak acorns by the four weevil species in two independent communities, and we assessed the level of synchronization in their population dynamics. In accordance with the niche theory, overall these species exhibited marked <b>time</b> <b>partitioning</b> of resource use, both within a given year and between different years owing to different dormancy strategies between species, as well as distinct demographic patterns. Two of the four weevil species, however, consistently exploited the resource during the same period of the year, exhibited a similar dormancy pattern, and did not show any significant difference in their population dynamics. Conclusions/Significance: The marked <b>time</b> <b>partitioning</b> of the resource use appears as a keystone of the coexistence o...|$|E

40|$|<b>Time</b> <b>partitioning</b> is {{a crucial}} {{property}} for integrated moduIar avionics architectures, particularly those in which applications of different criticalities run on the same processor. In a time-partitioned operating system, the scheduler is responsible for ensuring that the actions of one thread cannot affect other threads ' guaranteed access to CPU execution time. However, {{the large number of}} variables affecting application execution interleavings makes it difficult and costly to verify <b>time</b> <b>partitioning</b> by traditional means. We believe that automated model checking is a promising technique for verifying the correct design of partitioning algorithms. Our experience with modeling the DEOS scheduler shows that expressive models can be produced at a reasonable cost. Using automated model checking can increase design assurance by allowing coverage of a larger range of execution interleavings than can feasibly be covered by traditional testing. Furthermore, model checking can decrease development and testing costs by finding design errors early in the development cycle...|$|E
40|$|Copyright © 2013 National Academy of SciencesMany animals {{regulate}} {{their activity}} over a 24 -h sleep–wake cycle, concentrating their peak periods of activity {{to coincide with}} the hours of daylight, darkness, or twilight, or using different periods of light and darkness in more complex ways. These behavioral differences, which are in themselves functional traits, are associated with suites of physiological and morphological adaptations with implications for the ecological roles of species. The biogeography of diel <b>time</b> <b>partitioning</b> is, however, poorly understood. Here, we document basic biogeographic patterns of <b>time</b> <b>partitioning</b> by mammals and ecologically relevant large-scale patterns of natural variation in “illuminated activity time” constrained by temperature, and we determine how well the first of these are predicted by the second. Although the majority of mammals are nocturnal, the distributions of diurnal and crepuscular species richness are strongly associated with the availability of biologically useful daylight and twilight, respectively. Cathemerality is associated with relatively long hours of daylight and twilight in the northern Holarctic region, whereas the proportion of nocturnal species is highest in arid regions and lowest at extreme high altitudes. Although thermal constraints on activity have been identified as key to the distributions of organisms, constraints due to functional adaptation to the light environment are less well studied. Global patterns in diversity are constrained by the availability of the temporal niche; disruption of these constraints by the spread of artificial lighting and anthropogenic climate change, and the potential effects on <b>time</b> <b>partitioning,</b> are likely to be critical influences on species’ future distributions.

Certain signals, including substance P, the complement anaphylatoxins C 3 a and C 5 a, and endothelin 1, induced human MCs rapidly to secrete small and relatively spherical granule structures, a pattern consistent with the secretion of individual granules. Conversely, activating MCs with anti-IgE increased the <b>time</b> <b>partition</b> between signaling and secretion, which {{was associated with a}} period of sustained elevation of intracellular calcium and formation of larger and more heterogeneously shaped granule structures that underwent prolonged exteriorization.
