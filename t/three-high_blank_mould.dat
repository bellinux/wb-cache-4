25|$|In {{the press}} and blow process, the parison is formed by a long metal plunger which rises up and presses the glass out, in order to fill the ring and <b>blank</b> <b>moulds.</b>|$|R
2500|$|In both methods, {{a stream}} of molten glass, at its plastic {{temperature}} (...) , is cut with a shearing blade to form a solid cylinder of glass, called a gob. The gob is of predetermined weight just sufficient to make a bottle. Both processes start with the gob falling, by gravity, and guided, through troughs and chutes, into the <b>blank</b> <b>moulds,</b> two halves of which are clamped shut and then sealed by the [...] "baffle" [...] from above.|$|R

25|$|The forming {{machines}} {{hold and}} move the parts that form the container. The machine consist of basic 19 mechanisms in operation to form a bottle and generally powered by compressed air (high pressure - 3.2 bar and low pressure - 2.8 bar), the mechanisms are electronically timed to coordinate all movements of the mechanisms. The most widely used forming machine arrangement is the individual section machine (or IS machine). This machine has a bank of 5–20 identical sections, each of which contains one complete set of mechanisms to make containers. The sections are in a row, and the gobs feed into each section via a moving chute, called the gob distributor. Sections make either one, two, three or four containers simultaneously. (Referred to as single, double, triple and quad gob). In the case of multiple gobs, the shears cut the gobs simultaneously, and they fall into the <b>blank</b> <b>moulds</b> in parallel.|$|R
40|$|The {{narrow neck}} press and blow (NNPB) process was {{introduced}} to gain better control over glass distribution in the container. The improved control over glass distribution has enabled significant reduction in glass weight of up to 33 % without adversely affecting the mechanical performance of the container. A key component in the above process is the plunger, used to form the cavity in the parison during the forming stage. The function of the plunger is to evenly distribute the glass within the <b>blank</b> <b>mould</b> cavity and to aid the removal of thermal energy from the internal surface of the parison. Whilst there has been considerable attention given {{to the requirements of}} the glass, e. g. viscosity, gob weight, temperature and homogeneity, there has been little attention given to the plunger material, cooling system design and the plunger operating environment. The work presented here gives an overview of some of the problems associated with the NNPB process and the research being conducted at the University of Northumbria in collaboration with a major European glass container producer...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} demand on high quality optical systems with complex geometries, low tolerances {{and a low}} installation space necessitates new replicative production systems for complex optical glass elements. The technology precision <b>blank</b> <b>moulding</b> shows promising properties to comply with these demands on an industrial bulk production. Due to the required high surface quality and low surface roughness of produced optical elements, moulding dies must have comparable low roughness and defect-free surfaces. To reduce wear and chemical interaction with the hot glass, moulding dies are often coated with a thin sputtered physical vapour deposition (PVD) coating. The objective of this research work was to analyze the diffusion behaviour inside different indu-strially used low-Tg (transformation point) glasses and their interaction with three different noble metal coating systems during an application oriented heating test. Therefore, three differ-ent PtIr coating systems with different interlayers (50 nm nickel as reference, 20 nm chromium, without interlayer) were deposited and tested in combination with six different industrially used low-Tg glasses. Using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) a diffusion of the light alkali an...|$|R
40|$|Incremental Sheet Forming (ISF) is {{a method}} {{developed}} to form a desired surface feature on sheet metals in batch production series. Due {{to a lack of}} dedicated programming system to execute, control and monitor the whole ISF, researchers tried to utilize programming systems designed for chip making process to suits for ISF. In this work, experiments were conducted to find suitability and quality of ISF parts produced by using manual CNC part programming. Therefore, ISF was carried out on stainless steel sheets using Computer Numerical Control (CNC) milling machines. Prior to running the experiments, a ball-point shaped tool made of bronze alloy was fabricated due to its superior ability {{to reduce the amount of}} friction and improve the surface quality of the stainless steel sheet metal. The experiments also employed the method of forming in negative direction with a <b>blank</b> <b>mould</b> and the tool which helped to shape the desired part quickly. The programming was generated using the MasterCAM software for the CNC milling machine and edited before transferring to the machine. However, the programming for the machine was written manually to show the differences of output date between software programming and manual programming. From the results, best method of programming was found and minimum amount of contact area between tool and sheet metal achieved...|$|R
25|$|This {{technique}} {{is related to}} the origin of glass as a substitute for gemstones. By borrowing techniques for stone and carved gems, artisans were able to produce a variety of small containers from blocks of raw glass or thick <b>moulded</b> <b>blanks,</b> including cameo glass in two or more colours, and cage cups (still thought by most scholars to have been decorated by cutting, despite some debate).|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the development of whole column detection (WCD) for liquid chromatography (LC). The WCD uses electrochemical techniques for detecting the analytes passing through the separation column. Electrode array for in-column electrochemical detection (ICED) is fabricated along the separation column to enable whole column separation monitoring and allow better understanding on the affinity of particular analyte to the stationary and mobile phases. Numerical models were built to understand the feasibility and differences of electrochemical detection within an unpacked and packed column. From the simulated results, the surface area of the electrode was not hindered by the presence of the particles in flow condition. An electrochemical microfluidic device has been successfully fabricated on PET (polyethylene terephthalate) substrate using the reverse imprinting technique. The photolithographically produced gold metal electrode lines were imprinted into the PET substrate using a <b>blank</b> <b>mould</b> and produced an inlaid electrode array with overall step residue within 40 nm. The semi-cured thermoset polyester channel was irreversibly thermal bonded on the PET substrate. The devices were able to tolerate pressure in excess of 90 bars. The PET column was packed with 5 μm C 18 silica beads to perform reverse phase chromatography separation. The array was electrochemically characterised using standard redox probes in both stagnant conditions and under flow. Both numerical modelling and experimental data show improved sensitivity under flow and a limiting current which scaled linearly with cubic root of volume flow rate. Isocratic and gradient mode chromatographic separations of neurotransmitters and metabolites: serotonin, dopamine, adrenaline, 5 - HIAA and DOPAC were conducted in the fabricated device. Separation progress was electrochemically detected at multiple locations along the column. Whole column assessment on separation efficiency and column packing efficiency monitoring were conducted using the ICED. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|The {{stability}} of the casting process and the wear of the mould {{as well as the}} quality of the product depend strongly on the mould design. This is particularly true when considering the production of beam <b>blanks.</b> If the <b>mould</b> is too tight, thermal contraction can generate considerable contact forces between the product and the mould on the inner surfaces of the flanges. If it is not tight enough, the thermal coupling between the mould and the beam blank is not sufficient to allow the solidification of a skin of the required thickness upon exit from the mould. A finite element model was developed to assist in the mould design. This model takes both the thermal and mechanical interaction between the mould and the product into account. The effect of solidification is implicitly included in the (thermal) finite element formulation while the ferro-static pressure is applied by the means of a specially developed element. The model was applied to a medium gage beam blank cast at ProfilARBED Differdange. The skin thickness as well as the localisation of the wear of the mould predicted by the model are in good agreement with observations made in industrial practice. ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{both cases}} {{solution}} {{is affected by}} means of pressure steam in the jacketed portion of the kettle. When the solution is substantially clear it is slowly added, a pail at a time (3 gallons) {{by means of a}} 2 quart dipper, to the heated stearic acid as prepared in 1. The oil burner is kept on during this operation {{in order to keep the}} temperature of the mixture fairly constant at 360 degrees F. Care must be exercised in adding this [...] "Saponifying" [...] solution so that excess foaming is prevented. After all the solution has been added the resulting [...] "formula wax" [...] is heated to 400 degrees F. and maintained at this temperature for four hours, at which time a sample is removed, a congealing point determined, (see under [...] "tests"), and any addition made of stearic acid or sodium carbonate solution for correction, and the mixture held without additional heat for 10 hours. It is then heated again to bring the temperature up to 400 degrees F and allowed to cool gradually, usually overnight. When the temperature has again been reduced to 350 degrees F the wax is pumped by means of a Kinney pump into 10 gallon pails from which the wax is poured into shallow pans containing approximately 50 lbs of the wax per pan. After the material has cooled to room temperature it is removed from the pans and stacked. [...] 3. Into a 200-gallon cast iron cauldron heated by and oil burner of the household type, (or as required at present by war conditions, heated by bituminous coal) are placed 500 to 900 labs of [...] "formula wax". Note: The amount of [...] "formula wax" [...] to make up a batch various according to the amount of scrap wax which is to be added to the cauldron. Scrap wax represents commercial wax of which [...] "formula wax" [...] is a part. To the amount of [...] "formula wax placed in the cauldron are added 19½% Paraffin (133 degrees-135 degrees F., usual source Standard Oil of New Jersey) and 2% stearine pitch (M. P. 40 Degrees Centigrade). This mixture, consisting of [...] "formula wax", paraffin and stearine pitch, represents commercial wax. Finally, commercial scrap wax of the composition given above in added until the total weight of the mixture is approximately 1,600 lbs. This mixture is usually heated beginning at 12 midnight and carried through until the temperature is 410-415 degrees F. at 8 a.m. Note; This may be regarded as standard procedure, although at the present time (Dec., 1943) this has been modified so that only Sunday nights is this done. On other days of the week except Saturday the kettles are started at 6 A.M. This method was adopted due to man shortages which necessitated starting the molding operation later in the day.) At this time a congealing point is taken and the necessary adjustments made (see under [...] "tests") after which the mixture is transferred to a closed agitating tank by means of a Kinney pump, the latter forced the hot material through a 2" [...] pipe. [...] 4. To the mixture in the agitation tank there is added 3/10 percent Johns-Manville # 503 Filter Aid. The temperature is maintained at 375 degrees F. by means of a ring gas burner, at the bottom of the tank. At this temperature the wax is supplied by a Worthington pump at 30 lbs to a one square foot Shriver press whose head and follower are steam jacketed and which has 7 sections. The effluent from this press passes through a second Shriver press which has 2 sections of one square foot each. The mixture from the outlet here finally passes though a 1" [...] pipe which has a 100 × 150 mesh Monel, metal screen held in its cross sections by means of a union, into one of four 75 gallon aluminum kettles[...] These kettles are protected by conical hoods to prevent dust particles being carried into the body of the wax. After allowing the wax to remain at 330 degrees F. for three hours it is ready to be poured into the <b>blank</b> <b>moulds.</b> The temperature is maintained by gas burners beneath the kettles and controlled automatically by Partlow Corp. thermostatic controls. [...] 5. By means of a pot with 2 spouts the moulds are filled with molten wax. The pot has a capacity of about five pounds (slightly less than 2 quarts and is specially designed of aluminum and made by Theodore Walter, Newark N.J... The molding table revolves at the rate of 6 blanks per minute, approximately, and the size of the pouring pot spout is only sufficient to permit the hot wax to flow into the molds at a rate slightly faster than the speed of the molds which rotate past a given point around the table. [...] The blanks are extracted at a temperature of 200-205 degrees F. and place on boards which hold 30 blanks. These boards when filled move by gravity down a conveyor. The length of time on the conveyor is about two hours after which time they are sufficiently cool and hard to be put into production boxes holding 63 blanks. The boxes are placed in racks for the following day's production. Into each production box there is placed a semi-finished cylinder, which has been edged and reamed and which conforms to a standard internal diameter at 70 degrees F of 1.826 [...] " [...] at the thin end. The purpose of this is to permit the edging operation to take place on the un-finished blank at any temperature by adjusting the machine to conform to the standard. Thus, in each production box, there is a total of 63 unfinished cylinders. One day's production is held at least 34 hours before further processing. 6. The blanks are first reamed. The reamer consists of a twisted tapered and eight fluted tool. The blanks are forced on the reamer by hand to a stop. The position of the stop is adjusted so that sufficient material will be removed from both ends of the blanks when the blank is edged in the next operation. The reamer revolves at approximately 300 RPM. 7. The edging operation consists in placing a reamed blank on a tapered mandrel and by means of two special cutters working in unison the ends of the blank are formed to conform in couture to a standard template. A second gauge is used to insure proper length (6⅛"). IN each case the edged blank must rest on a tapered mandrel gauge in exactly the same position as the standard blank which is in the production box. The usual procedure is to make the necessary adjustments of the knives of the first blank which is edged so that is conforms to the standard, and then continue the operation on the rest of the blanks in the production box at the identical position of the first blank. Note; since there are 63 blanks for each standard blank it will be observed that every 63rd cylinder is checked mandrel gauge. The accuracy of the method and the facility with which it is done depend on the care and skill of the operator. This is the most critical of all the operations. The edging machine revolves at 2,200 RPM. 8. Following the edging operation is the stamping. This consists in applying a hot printing die to the thick end of the cylinder as it is placed accurately in a vertical position under the die. The heating of the die is done by means of a resistance wire coiled within a hollow torus near the under edge of the circular die. The coiled wire is connected to a source of current and the latter is adjusted by means of a rheostat. The heated died has raised lettering and makes and impression on the end surface of the wax cylinder. The depressed positive lettering on the cylinder is filled with a thick paste of zinc carbonate, the excess of which is brushed or wiped off after drying. [...] 9. The cylinders are next shaved on a ganged shaving machine consisting of a rough shaving knife free from [...] "blinds" [...] and [...] "lines", accurate concentricity and a minimum of taper. These factors depend on the tension of the driving belt, tension upon the rotating mandrel between centers and the position and sharpness of the knives. The speed of the mandrel is around 2,200 RPM. 10. The finished cylinders are placed in boxes which contain 16 pegs and run down a conveyor. At a point on this conveyor the cylinders are held and brushed on the inside to remove wax shavings and dust. [...] 11. Cylinders are inspected, packed and placed in the stock room for a minimum of thirty days before shipping. [...] 12. The reinforcing liners are made as follows: Crinoline cloth of specifications given under [...] "Tests", are cut into a trapezoid (Paper Products Dept.) base length 6¼, altitude 5⅝" [...] top length 5¾". A pack of these are placed in a vise edgewise and thinned glue, one part Le Pages Glue, one part water, brushed onto one slant edge. A liner is then wrapped a tapered mandrel of such size as to fit no too snugly on the molding core. The liner is held on the mandrel by means of two jaws actuated by a foot lever and the lapped edges of the liner glued by means of a gas iron held for an instant along the line of the lap. J.W.
