5|$|The delegates {{also agreed}} with Madison that the {{executive}} function {{had to be}} independent of the legislature. In their aversion to kingly power, American legislatures had created state governments where the executive was beholden <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>legislature,</b> and by the late 1780s this was widely seen as being a source of paralysis. The Confederation government was the ultimate example of this.|$|E
5|$|Among Scott's first acts as {{governor}} was appointing Jesse Bledsoe as Secretary of State. Bledsoe delivered Scott's first address <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> on December 13, 1808.

His physical condition continued to worsen throughout his term {{as governor}}.|$|E

He won the canvass, defeating Democrat Matthew Flournoy 38,587 to 30,491. In his first address <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>legislature,</b> he outlined an ambitious agenda of reforms, including the establishing a public school system, strengthening the office of state auditor, and combating an increase in crime. Believing that banks should be held to their responsibilities, he insisted that the state banks not suspend specie payments. He also strongly believed in the rights of slave owners, and encouraged Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois to cooperate in returning escaped slaves.|$|E
5|$|Earp improbably testified {{during the}} {{preliminary}} hearing after the gunfight at the O.K. Corral that he and Behan had made a deal. If Earp withdrew his application <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>legislature,</b> Behan agreed to appoint Earp as undersheriff. Behan received the appointment in February 1881, but did not keep {{his end of the}} bargain, and instead chose Harry Woods, a prominent Democrat, as undersheriff. Behan testified at first that he had not made any deal with Earp, although he later admitted he had lied. Behan said he broke his promise to appoint Earp because of an incident that occurred shortly before his appointment.|$|E
5|$|He {{was married}} to Catherine Coffee from 1830 until her death after childbirth. On October 8, 1832, Palmer became a United States citizen.

5|$|In 1823, {{the state}} {{legislature}} chose Rowan and Henry Clay to represent the defendant in a second rehearing of Green v. Biddle before the U.S. Supreme Court. The case, which involved the constitutionality of laws passed by the General Assembly relating to land titles granted in Kentucky when the state was still a part of Virginia, was of interest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>legislature.</b> The Supreme Court, however, refused the second rehearing, letting stand their previous opinion that Kentucky's laws were {{in violation of the}} compact of separation from Virginia.|$|E
5|$|In 1825, Clark {{was chosen}} to fill the congressional seat vacated by Henry Clay's {{elevation}} to Secretary of State. He served until 1831, but did not seek re-election that year. He became active in organizing the Whig Party in Kentucky and was rewarded for his efforts by being chosen as the party's nominee for governor in 1836. He won the election and laid out an ambitious platform <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>legislature,</b> which acted on only part of it. Clark's most significant accomplishment as governor was securing {{the creation of a}} state board of education and the establishment of public schools in every county in the state. Clark died in office in 1839. His estate, Holly Rood, was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974.|$|E
5|$|In 1868, he {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>legislature,</b> representing Multnomah County in the Oregon House of Representatives as a Democrat. While in the legislature, he worked {{to get a}} $30,000 government subsidy to purchase and operate a large steam tugboat {{at the mouth of}} the Columbia River. This vessel was used to pilot ships across the Columbia Bar and thus improved maritime commerce for Portland. In 1870, he sold two blocks of land in downtown to the City of Portland, which would become the Plaza Blocks between Third and Fourth avenues at Main Street.|$|E

He was not a candidate for reelection in 1938, but in 1940 he ran again and was elected along with Finnerty and Samuel Rose. After that term ended, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Shepard recorder of deeds in Washington, D.C., a position he held until 1951. At that time, Shepard and Mary McLeod Bethune were the only two black people in government service in the nation's capital.|$|E
5|$|In December 1817, Edwards, {{responding}} to a movement for statehood led by his ally Daniel Pope Cook, recommended <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> that Illinois apply for admission to the Union. He also recommended that a census first be taken of the territory, a standard practice, but the legislature rejected this. Legislators, particularly those opposed to slavery, feared that any delay would allow Missouri to apply for statehood before Illinois, and that since Missouri was a slave state, this would cause so much turmoil in Congress that it would delay Illinois' admission even longer.|$|E
5|$|In James Monroe's annual address <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> in December 1822, {{he called}} on Congress to report on how to best deal with the Seminoles that {{inhabited}} the recently acquired territory of Florida. As chair of the Committee on Indian Affairs, Metcalfe delivered the report on February 21, 1823. His committee found that, {{under the terms of}} the Adams-Onis Treaty that transferred control of Florida to the United States from Spain, the Seminoles were to be accorded the same privileges as U.S. citizens. Accordingly, the committee recommended that each Seminole family be given a land grant. They hoped that this would help break the tribal loyalties of the Seminoles and expedite their amalgamation into white society. The committee's report was largely ignored.|$|E
25|$|Recognizing {{its debt}} <b>to</b> Jouett, <b>the</b> <b>legislature</b> passed a {{resolution}} on June 15 <b>to</b> honor him. <b>The</b> <b>legislature</b> resolved <b>to</b> give Jouett a pair of pistols and a sword in gratitude.

50|$|The Government of India Act 1919 {{expanded}} <b>the</b> membership <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>legislatures.</b> <b>The</b> Liberals entered <b>the</b> new <b>legislatures</b> {{and attempted}} <b>to</b> make <b>the</b> reforms succeed {{so as to}} advance India far toward full self-government. They tried <b>to</b> persuade <b>the</b> British that Indians were a loyal opposition and well prepared for self-government, and trying also to build Indian self-respect and prove that revolutionary upheaval was unnecessary as well as dangerous. They urged for further constitutional reform, asking for an expanded Indian role in both provincial and central government. However, they had a minority position in <b>the</b> <b>legislatures</b> and hence were weakened.|$|R
5000|$|However, as {{neither side}} felt strong enough <b>to</b> force <b>the</b> issue militarily at that time, the Georgian-Abkhaz {{antagonism}} had largely been relegated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>legislatures</b> by July 1990, making Abkhazia {{a field of}} [...] "war of laws" [...] until the armed hostilities broke out in August 1992.|$|R
