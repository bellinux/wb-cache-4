5|$|The British {{soldiers}} marched out {{and laid}} {{down their arms}} in between the French and American armies, while many civilians watched. At this time, the troops {{on the other side}} of the river in Gloucester also surrendered. The British soldiers had been issued new uniforms hours before the surrender and until prevented by General O'Hara some <b>threw</b> <b>down</b> their muskets with the apparent intention of smashing them. Others wept or appeared to be drunk. In all, 8,000 troops, 214 artillery pieces, thousands of muskets, 24 transport ships, wagons and horses were captured.|$|E
5|$|The French assault {{began at}} the same time, but they were halted by the abatis, which was {{undamaged}} by the artillery fire. The French began to hack at the abatis and a Hessian sentry came out and asked who was there. When there was no response, the sentry opened fire as did other Hessians on the parapet. The French soldiers fired back, and then charged the redoubt. The Germans charged the Frenchmen climbing over the walls but the French fired a volley, driving them back. The Hessians then took a defensive position behind some barrels but <b>threw</b> <b>down</b> their arms and surrendered when the French prepared a bayonet charge.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall removed Emmett for a duck at {{the start}} of the second innings, {{bringing}} his tormentor Edrich to the crease. Bradman advised Lindwall not to bowl any bouncers at Edrich, fearing that it would be interpreted as retaliation and lead to a negative media and crowd reaction. However, Miller did retaliate with a series of bouncers, earning the ire of the crowd. He struck Edrich on the body before Bradman intervened and order him to stop. Edrich and Washbrook settled and put together a 124-run partnership in only 138 minutes. This was aided by the Australian fielders, who twice dropped Washbrook at long leg and once in the slips cordon. Edrich struck eight boundaries and brought up his fifty with a six, but was immediately run out by Morris, who <b>threw</b> <b>down</b> the stumps from cover. Toshack removed Compton for a duck, leaving England at 125/3. Crapp joined Washbrook and helped see off the new ball, as England reached 174 at the close without further loss, with Washbrook unbeaten on 85.|$|E

5|$|On Monday 4 February, William {{bought some}} rope {{at the local}} grocer's shop, and {{spent the rest of}} the day observing cases at the Sheriff Court from the public gallery. He was later {{reported}} to have listened attentively to the proceedings. On 7 February, he attended the court sessions again. On 10 February, he visited his acquaintance, Walker, who lent him a newspaper that featured a woman's suicide by hanging. Walker asked Bury to look up any news of Jack the Ripper, at which Bury <b>threw</b> <b>down</b> the newspaper with a fright. That evening, he walked into the Dundee Central Police Station on Bell Street and reported his wife's suicide to Lieutenant James Parr. He said they had been drinking heavily the night before her death, and he had woken in the morning to find his wife's body on the floor with a rope around her neck. Bury had not summoned a doctor, but had instead cut the body and concealed it in one of the packing cases brought from London. Bury told Parr that his actions were now preying on his mind, and he was afraid that he would be arrested and accused of being Jack the Ripper.|$|E

25|$|On March 15, Herrera’s platoon was {{advancing}} along {{a wooded}} road near the French town of Mertzwiller when it ran into two German machine-gun emplace-ments. Caught in a deadly crossfire {{between the two}} guns, the GIs dived for cover. Fearing that his comrades would be cut to pieces, Herrera stood up and ran toward the closest enemy position, firing his rifle from the hip. He tossed two grenades at the machine-gun nest; the concussion knocked the Germans down. Then he was on them, and all eight soldiers <b>threw</b> <b>down</b> their weapons and surrendered to him.|$|E
25|$|On the Kerry coast, {{he built}} a currach-like boat of wattle, covered it with hides tanned in oak bark {{softened}} with butter, set up a mast and a sail. He and {{a small group of}} monks fasted for forty days, and after a prayer upon the shore, embarked {{in the name of the}} Trinity. The account is characterized by a great deal of literary license and contains references to hell where “great demons <b>threw</b> <b>down</b> lumps of fiery slag from an island with rivers of gold fire” and “great crystal pillars.” Many now believe these to be references to the volcanic activity around Iceland, and to icebergs.|$|E
25|$|The {{generals and}} staff {{officers}} had to reform Bartlett's brigade and deploy {{the men at}} right angles to the Confederate line so they would not be trapped if the Confederates managed a counterattack. Chamberlain rushed two regiments to help. Together, these units put the Confederates to flight, taking about 1,500 prisoners and several battle flags. Bartlett and Chamberlain reorganized 150 to 200 stragglers and put them back into the battle. Chamberlain saw Colonel Gwyn's battle flag to the rear and asked Gwyn to have his brigade assist Chamberlain's men, which Gwyn did. Suddenly confronted by a large number of Confederates, Chamberlain feared being caught in a cross-fire when the Confederates suddenly <b>threw</b> <b>down</b> their arms and surrendered.|$|E

25|$|Kellermann quickly formed {{his eight}} regiments in four lines, with Lorcet's two light cavalry regiments {{in the first}} line and the six dragoon regiments in the three {{supporting}} lines. Storming forward, the 3,000 horsemen burst through Anglona's cavalry and crashed into the Spanish right-center. The attack broke up all of Losada's and part of Belveder's formations. About 2,000 Spaniards <b>threw</b> <b>down</b> their muskets and surrendered, the rest fled across the bridge. The French also seized a battery of artillery. Del Parque was unable to bring up his other two divisions because the span was packed with panicked soldiers. Instead, he deployed them along the river to cover the retreat of the others.|$|E

In the Super Six stage, he came in against New Zealand at 84–7. He and Michael Bevan again saved Australia with his highest score of 64 as Australia put up a winning total batting first. In the semi-final against Sri Lanka, he bowled tightly conceding 0–18 in 10 overs but his pressure caused the spectacular run out of Aravinda de Silva as he picked up spun around and <b>threw</b> <b>down</b> the stumps to prevent a tight single off his own bowling.

There was a fierce struggle, the Spanish could not get out of the trap; some were killed under the walls and the rest were soon speedily driven back. As they did so the Spanish were assailed on their retreat by an ambush on the dyke and the rest were hunted into the waters. They were utterly routed; a great number were killed or wounded and several high-ranking officers were taken prisoner.|$|E
