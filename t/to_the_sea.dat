5|$|When sandhoppers (such as Talitrus saltator) {{are taken}} up a beach, they easily {{find their way}} back down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea.</b> It {{has been shown that}} this is not simply by moving {{downhill}} or towards the sight or sound of the sea. A group of sandhoppers were acclimatised to a day/night cycle under artificial lighting, whose timing was gradually changed until it was 12 hours out of phase with the natural cycle. Then, the sandhoppers were placed on the beach in natural sunlight. They moved away from the sea, up the beach. The experiment implied that the sandhoppers use the sun and their internal clock to determine their heading, and that they had learnt the actual direction down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea</b> on their particular beach.|$|E
5|$|According to Meek, Pokhlebkin and the Soviet Union are dead, yet Borshchland lives on. Recipes, like birds, ignore {{political}} boundaries....

5|$|Although {{juvenile}} {{and adult}} J.lagostoma are almost exclusively terrestrial, the larvae are marine and planktonic. In order to release their offspring, the adults therefore have to migrate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sea,</b> {{as seen in}} other land crabs, such as the Christmas Island red crab, Gecarcoidea natalis. In {{most members of the}} family Gecarcinidae, migration coincides with the rainy season, which reduces the risk of desiccation; migration in J.lagostoma occurs from January until March, while the period of highest rainfall is from March to May.|$|E
50|$|The {{device is}} moored by a mid-water buoy, which is fixed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>seabed</b> by four spread mooring lines which are {{anchored}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sea-bed by pile or gravity anchors. The buoy design is also {{unique in that}} it encompasses a geo-fixed part that is anchored <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>seabed</b> and a rotating part that is linked to Evopod by a rigid yoke. The turbine drag forces are therefore transmitted through a bearing system linking the fixed and rotating parts of the buoy. A slip ring power export swivel {{is located in the}} buoy so that twist is not imparted into the umbilical cable that takes the power from <b>the</b> midwater buoy <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>seabed.</b> A subsea power export cable links <b>the</b> umbilical’s <b>seabed</b> connection point <b>to</b> <b>the</b> shore.|$|R
