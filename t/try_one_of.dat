500|$|The {{idea for}} a film version of the 1817 Austen novel Persuasion began with the English {{producer}} Fiona Finlay, who had wanted to create an adaptation for several years. The novel had last been adapted by ITV in a 1971 serial starring Ann Firbank. Finlay felt that the [...] "very romantic" [...] story was one [...] "everyone can relate to. There's something very touching about long-lost love". She approached the writer Nick Dear about adapting it for television; Finlay had enjoyed his contributions to theatre, particularly his play about William Hogarth, The Art of Success. Dear first suggested they <b>try</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Austen's other works—either Sense and Sensibility or Pride and Prejudice—but agreed to adapt Persuasion after reading it. Dear considered the novel—the author's last completed work—a maturer story than the others.|$|E

At a race in Schleiz during 1937, Meier had the opportunity to <b>try</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the new supercharged BMWs during practice.

[...] The BMW team persuaded Meier to continue and he finished the practice session with fourth fastest time, but did not start the race as he was not officially entered by the BMW works team. After replacing Otto Ley in the BMW team for the 1938 season, Meier began 1938 by winning the Eilenriede Race at Hanover, setting race and lap records after a poor start which had left him in last place".|$|E
