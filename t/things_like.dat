5|$|During {{the mission}} status briefing, Jennifer Wiseman, Chief of Exoplanet and Stellar Astrophysics for Goddard Space Flight Center, {{noted that the}} repair of STIS was a major victory for both the mission and the science community, as {{that part of the}} {{telescope}} performed unique functions, helping scientists understand the materials planets are composed of, and looking at <b>things</b> <b>like</b> the motion of stars around black holes.|$|E
5|$|Horny. I'm feeling really horny about it. And very smug … I'm in that mode now, so {{hopefully}} I'll stay {{in it for}} a while … I've got a {{few more}} things planned—at least a couple more albums, some EPs, <b>things</b> <b>like</b> that. Some more dance-y things I did about 10 years ago. Experimental things, noise things, weird things. Shitloads of stuff. They're all pretty much ready to go.|$|E
5|$|Living <b>things</b> <b>like</b> orchids, hummingbirds, and the peacock's tail have {{abstract}} designs with {{a beauty}} of form, pattern and colour that artists struggle to match. The beauty that people perceive in nature has causes at different levels, {{notably in the}} mathematics that governs what patterns can physically form, and among living things in the effects of natural selection, that govern how patterns evolve.|$|E

5|$|WhitePages started {{developing}} {{features for}} business users around 2010. WhitePages Pro {{is used for}} <b>things</b> <b>like</b> verifying {{the identity of a}} sales lead, find fake form data in online forms and to check form data from consumers making a purchase against common indicators of fraud, like shipping to a mailbox at an unoccupied building. In 2016, advertising on WhitePages.com was turned off in favor of selling monthly subscriptions that give users unlimited background checks and other records.|$|E
5|$|On {{the train}} Sameer meets Suraj Prakash (Satish Shah), who makes him {{think that he}} is a thief by asking him where he keeps {{important}} <b>things</b> (<b>like</b> money) in his luggage. Sameer stays awake all night to avoid being robbed, while Suraj sleeps after conning Sameer into guarding his luggage. Suraj admits this to Sameer the next morning at the station. Sameer learns that Suraj is a security guard at his resort, and puts him on night guard duty for three months. This puts a crimp in Suraj's marriage and, although he apologises, Sameer is adamant.|$|E
5|$|The Simpson {{family are}} busy {{preparing}} for Bart's birthday party. Homer sees a commercial on television for a prank microphone called the Superstar Celebrity Microphone {{that can be}} used to tap into localized AM radio systems and instantly decides to buy one for Bart. Subsequently, Bart experiences a crushingly disappointing birthday party when all his gifts turn out to be useless <b>things</b> <b>like</b> a cactus, a label maker, and a new suit. At first, he is also disappointed by the microphone, but later finds a use for it in creating practical jokes, such as tricking Ned's boys Rod and Todd into believing that God is talking to them, listening in on Lisa and Janey's conversations about boys, and persuading Homer that Martians are invading the Earth.|$|E

5|$|The film's {{special effects}} were {{supervised}} by RKO department head Vernon L. Walker. Welles pioneered several visual effects to cheaply shoot <b>things</b> <b>like</b> crowd scenes and large interior spaces. For example, {{the scene in}} which the camera in the opera house rises dramatically to the rafters, to show the workmen showing a lack of appreciation for Susan Alexander Kane's performance, was shot by a camera craning upwards over the performance scene, then a curtain wipe to a miniature of the upper regions of the house, and then another curtain wipe matching it again with {{the scene of the}} workmen. Other scenes effectively employed miniatures to make the film look much more expensive than it truly was, such as various shots of Xanadu.|$|E
5|$|The {{organisation}} {{of society}} depends on means of production. Literally, those <b>things,</b> <b>like</b> land, {{natural resources and}} technology, necessary {{for the production of}} material goods and the relations of production. In other words, the social relationships people enter into as they acquire and use the means of production. Together, these compose the mode of production and Marx distinguished historical eras in terms of distinct modes of production. Marx differentiated between base and superstructure, with the base (or substructure) referring to the economic system and superstructure, to the cultural and political system. Marx regarded this mismatch between (economic) base and (social) superstructure as a major source of social disruption and conflict.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} combat, the game allows players {{to create and}} {{customise}} their own move combos in the Combo Lab, which uses four categories of fighting moves called Pressens. This is done by chaining them together, made possible through earning PMP (Procedural Mastering Power), with a limit of four combos being active at any one time. The Pressen moves are Regen (healing), Power (damage), Chain (duplication and doubling of previous moves) and Cooldown (regeneration of S-Pressen energy). There are 50,000 possible Pressen combinations. Five S-Pressen moves will {{be made available to}} the player {{over the course of the}} game: the moves enable them to do <b>things</b> <b>like</b> stun groups of enemies, move at high speed and land more hits, or turn hostile robots into allies which then self-destruct. Players also have access to projectile-based weapons like the Spammer and Junk Bolt.|$|E

5|$|The Han Chinese {{believed}} that three realms of Heaven, Earth, and Mankind were inextricably linked {{and subject to}} natural cycles; if man could understand these cycles, they could understand the hidden secrets of the three realms. One cycle was yin and yang, which corresponded to yielding and hard, shade and sunlight, feminine and masculine, and the Moon and Sun, respectively, while it was thought to govern the three realms and changing of seasons. The five phases was another important cycle where the elements of wood (mu 木), fire (huo 火), earth (tu 土), metal (jin 金), and water (shui 水) succeeded each other in rotation and each corresponded with certain traits of the three realms. For example, the five phases corresponded with other sets of five like the five organs (i.e. liver, heart, spleen, lungs and kidneys) and five tastes (i.e. sour, bitter, sweet, spicy, and salty), or even <b>things</b> <b>like</b> feelings, musical notes, colors, planets, calendars and time periods.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene with}} Peter in the hypnotherapist's office was censored from television, as Peter {{discusses}} his genitals and reproductive organs. When Peter {{comes to the}} realization that Francis is not his real father and when Stewie dreams about being tortured by Lois, a harp sound can be heard; MacFarlane comments that even small <b>things</b> <b>like</b> that take {{a lot of work to}} produce. The alcohol bottles being pushed by the airplane that Peter and Brian are traveling on were animated by computer, as is the taxi driving along the street. On the DVD commentary, MacFarlane notes that the scene would not have looked good without computer aid. He said it makes the animations seem more realistic than without a computer. The two men circling each other for fifty years and waiting for the other to throw the first punch was not broadcast for television.|$|E
5|$|The {{series is}} {{distinguished}} by its art style, which emulates manga and anime. According to Baba, the character designs are created once the main character's story, personality, and environment {{are determined by}} the rest of the production team. Beyond that, the artist is allowed to use their imagination, though they can be asked to alter <b>things</b> <b>like</b> costume details, and facial expressions. One of the main designers for the series is manga artist Kōsuke Fujishima. He was first brought in to design the characters for Phantasia, and has since designed for multiple entries including Abyss and Xillia. Another designer, Mutsumi Inomata, first designed for the series with Destiny, and has contributed designs for multiple entries including Eternia, Rebirth and Xillia. A third regular artist is Daigo Okumura, who designed characters for Vesperia and Xillia 2, as well as Dawn of the New World. Other designers to work on the series include Kazuto Nakazawa (Legendia), Kouichi Kimura (Xillia 2), and Minoru Iwamoto (Zestiria). The art design for each game's world and characters has ranged between a cel-shaded anime style (Vesperia) to a more realistic style (Xillia 2). Skit character images are also directly inspired by anime art. The art style for each title is determined by the theme and story decided upon by the developers.|$|E
