My dear father: AMERICAN HORSE:- I {{want to tell you}} something, and it makes me feel very glad. You tell me that my brother is married and that makes me feel very glad. My cousins, and brothers, and I are all very well, at this Carlisle School. We would like to see you again. I am always happy here, but lately I sometimes feel bad, because you tell me that my grandfather is getting very old. Tell me how my brothers are. I would like to see my brother's wife's picture. Tell my brother Two-Dogs to write to me again. Miss Hyde's father died two weeks ago, and I am very sorry. I remember all of my friends. If you don't answer my letter soon, I'll feel bad. I don't always answer your letter soon, but it is because I can not write. As soon as I get so that I can write myself, I will write as often as I can. Tell Brave Bull that Dora (Her Pipe) has been a little sick, but is most well now. Tell if my grandfather is well. If he gets sick tell me. You wrote to my cousin Robert and told him that you had a house to live in, and lots of pigs and cows and such things, and I was very glad. You've got a white man's house to live in now and I am anxious to learn all that I can, so that I can come home by and by and live with you. I hear that they have a big school out there and it makes me very glad. If you can, come again, and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can come again, when. I {{want to tell you that}} some more girls and boys came here. Twenty-five. Fifteen of them are girls. There are a great many of us here now, and Capt. Pratt is very kind to us. That is all I want to say now. Give my love to all of my friends. Your daughter, Maggie Stands-Looking." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Two hours, anyway. Well, you needn't <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't want to, but it's {{quite easy}} to see that {{something}} is worrying you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right! I'll believe {{anything}} that Lightfoot <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{say it is}} true," [...] declared Peter, who greatly admires his cousin, Jumper. [...] "Now <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> about those rags, Lightfoot. Please do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It seems incredible--even impossible. I do {{not mean}} any harm by it, but would <b>you</b> mind <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are any over eighteen?--that is to say, will you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> how old you are?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What is it for, then? I shall keep smacking until <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me.</b> Gad! <b>if</b> <b>you</b> weren't drunk, I'd half {{kill you}} here to-night.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] said Jake. [...] "There's {{nothing more}} {{to be done in}} the meantime, but you'd better <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> find out {{anything}} else." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Prithee, truce {{with this}} nonsense, Wildrake," [...] said Everard, [...] "and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are sober {{enough to hear}} {{a few words of}} sober reason?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{wish you}} would <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can. The state of a married woman is honest at any rate, let her husband be who he may." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Tom, have <b>you</b> {{anything}} to <b>tell</b> <b>me?</b> <b>If</b> ever <b>you</b> loved <b>me</b> in your life, and have anything concealed from every one besides, {{tell it to}} me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> sir, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> please," [...] he continued, [...] "what {{brings out}} his Majesty's ship Drake this fine morning? Going a little airing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes--yes. If {{there are}} any of them you would care to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> instead--just <b>if</b> <b>you</b> want to, mind--just <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are in a hole or anything?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never {{mind about}} that, sir. If {{you want to}} do a {{friendly}} thing in return, <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> know what has become of Miss de Sor." ...|$|E
6000|$|So he said, ‘Oh, venerable mothers, {{wisdom is}} the {{daughter}} of old age. You therefore should know many things. <b>Tell</b> <b>me,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can, the path to the Gorgon.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think, Lady Marrabel," [...] Saton said slowly, [...] "that you can <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will. I {{think that}} you will tell me. I {{think that you}} must!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, please stop! please stop!" [...] shrieked {{the poor}} boy in his agony. [...] "I'll do {{everything}} <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> to, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> won't strike <b>me</b> again!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Will you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what it means?" [...] {{his wife}} repeated. [...] "Or why <b>you</b> didn't <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> before, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> meant {{to give your}} play to that creature?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ma, pray don't sit {{staring at}} me in that {{intensely}} aggravating manner! <b>If</b> <b>you</b> see a black on my nose, <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> so; <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't, leave <b>me</b> alone.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come hither, ye unhanged whelp," [...] said Jekyl, [...] "and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{know the}} old gentleman that passed down the walk just now--yonder he is, still in sight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Think of all that," [...] he added, [...] "and then <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> {{believe that}} a {{stronger}} motive {{for the murder of}} such an enemy could well be found." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Margaret, {{come over}} here and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't think we might cut down this elm, tear the stump out by the roots, and throw it into the ravine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{been working}} here {{nearly two years}} now under you. I wanted to ask <b>you</b> to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> frankly <b>if</b> <b>you</b> think it worth while for me to continue." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have got}} to submit to arrest and stand trial," [...] said Sergeant Brown. [...] "There are no two ways about it. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> won't submit quietly we'll have to fight. But let <b>me</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> fight it will go hard with you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir Julien," [...] she asked, [...] "I beg of <b>you</b> to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> this. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> do {{not know}} who I am, why have you {{mentioned}} Herr Freudenberg's name to me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You say it," [...] he {{answered}} with a grave bow; [...] "but <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will, {{how did you find}} your way to a land whither visitors do not wander?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I presume, Mr. Vine," [...] he said, [...] "that you are {{not here}} to poke fun at us. <b>Tell</b> <b>me,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> please, what {{document}} it is to which you refer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well. Now <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> or {{your husband}} have signed any agreement--any papers, I mean, giving this man {{a right to}} claim the child {{as one of his}} performers?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then why can't you say something? I want a man's {{opinion of}} our prospects. Good gracious, how you fidget! Put {{yourself}} in Romayne's place, and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> this. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> had left Stella--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But why? What's {{the matter}} with you? You're an {{excellent}} chap, sound in wind and limb, and didn't <b>you</b> once <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> that, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> married, you came into a pretty sizeable bit of money?" ...|$|R
30|$|I {{had always}} lived at home; I {{wanted to live}} away from home… I wanted to do {{something}} extra, and to do it on my own, without anybody to help me or someone to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> ‘Call <b>me</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> have a problem’… It’s a test… You say to yourself: ‘OK, but are you actually capable of doing something on your own?’ (Mirco).|$|R
6000|$|... 'Doctor,' said I, 'you {{have been}} {{throughout}} my good angel, and your advice is a command. But <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> please, {{something of the}} family with which I am to reside.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No {{trace of}} Ferrari has been {{discovered}} in England,' she said. 'Have you any news of him? And will you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> (<b>if</b> <b>you</b> have heard anything), in mercy to his wife?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You said {{yesterday}} that you had been with Mr Slow, and that you had something to <b>tell</b> <b>me.</b> <b>If</b> <b>you</b> still wish to tell me anything, perhaps you can do so now." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now {{came again}} {{the voice of}} Agnes: [...] "Oh, Mr. Cuthbert, are you truly there? Are you crushed? Are you wounded? Are you nearly frozen? Are <b>you</b> starved? <b>Tell</b> <b>me</b> quickly <b>if</b> <b>you</b> are yet safe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] he said. [...] "You needn't <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{anything}}. There isn't {{anything in}} the world that could change me to you--nothing that <b>you</b> could <b>tell</b> <b>me!</b> Sometime, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> must--if you wish; but not now. I've been too miserable, and now I'm so happy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Captain Fortunio? He is well {{named for}} a soldier of fortune. My brother, no doubt, will have family matters to <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> of. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> will step below, Monsieur le Capitaine, and drink a health or so while you wait, I shall be honoured." ...|$|R
