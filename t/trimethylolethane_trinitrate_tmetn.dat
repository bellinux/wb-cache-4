50|$|<b>Trimethylolethane</b> <b>trinitrate</b> (<b>TMETN),</b> {{also known}} as metriol trinitrate (METN, MTN, METRTN) or nitropentaglycerin, is a nitrate ester. It is a high {{explosive}} similar to nitroglycerin. It is a transparent oily liquid, colorless to light brown. It is odorless. It is used in some solid propellants and smokeless powders as a plasticizer. Its chemical formula is CH3-C(CH2-O-NO2)3.|$|E

5000|$|Plasticizers. Improve the {{mechanical}} {{properties of the}} propellant particles. For composite rocket propellants, dioctyl adipate, isodecyl pelargonate, and dioctyl phthalate are often used. Plasticizers can also be other energetic materials (common in smokeless powders), e.g. nitroglycerine, butanetriol <b>trinitrate,</b> dinitrotoluene, <b>trimethylolethane</b> <b>trinitrate,</b> diethylene glycol dinitrate, triethylene glycol dinitrate, bis(2,2-dinitropropyl)formal, bis(2,2-dinitropropyl)acetal, 2,2,2-trinitroethyl 2-nitroxyethyl ether, and others.|$|R
50|$|TME is an {{intermediate}} {{in the production}} of alkyd and polyester resins, powder coating resins, synthetic lubricants based on polyol esters, stabilizers for plastics, plasticizers, and pigment coatings based on titanium dioxide. Trimethylolethane based resins have superior weatherability and resistance to alkali and heat. Trimethylolethane is used in some phase change materials. The typical composition is then 63 wt.% TME with 37 wt.% water. The mixture has melting point of 29.8 °C and heat of fusion 218 kJ/kg. Nitration of <b>trimethylolethane</b> gives <b>trimethylolethane</b> <b>trinitrate,</b> an explosive, monopropellant, and energetic plasticizer.|$|R
40|$|Cast cure, {{extrusion}} cast, {{and paste}} extrudable explosives {{have not been}} designed for transferring through long tortuous paths or into fine three dimensional shapes. To allow the crystalline explosive to flow a lubricating fluid is required. The energetic liquid ethane <b>trinitrate</b> (<b>TMETN)</b> {{was used as the}} lubricant to maximize the explosive energy. TMETN is a liquid nitrate ester which requires stabilization with conventional free radical stabilizers such as 2 - nitrodiphenylamine, methyl-nitroanaline, or ethyl centrylite. Since these injection moldable explosives are expected to cure in place, a polyesterurethane binder based on polymeric isocyanate of hexamethylene diisocyanate and polycaprolactone polyols is dissolved in TMETN. The solubility of the polymer precursors in TMETN also reduces the energetic liquids sensitivity. The latent cure catalyst Dabco T- 131 was used to minimize shrinkage associated with thermal expansion, reduce cost associated with oven cures, to give 4 - 6 hour potlife and overnight cure to handling strength. The product RX- 08 -HD is a new, low-viscosity, injection moldable explosive that can be extruded into complex, void-free shapes. Combined with appropriate design and other aspects of weaponization, RX- 08 -HD has produced outstanding results...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{evaluate}} the effect of several types of plasticizers on the glass–rubber transition temperatures (Tg) of polyester-based polyurethane binders, using dynamic mechanical analysis (DMA). The polyester polyol commercially named Desmophen® 2200 (D 2200 ®) has been investigated for use as binder for composite propellant applications due to its good ballistic properties and also due to its potential glass–rubber transition temperature when mixed with polar energetic plasticizers. Therefore, {{it is important to}} evaluate the behavior of D 2200 ® with different energetic plasticizers. In the present work, this inert polar binder was mixed individually with several different plasticizers and cured with a polyisocyanate commercially named Desmodur® N 3400. The plasticizers used were: nitrate ester methyl trimethylol ethane <b>trinitrate</b> (<b>TMETN),</b> N-(n-butyl) -N-(2 -nitroxyethyl) nitramine (Bu-NENA), bis-(2, 2 -dinitropropyl) formal and bis-(2, 2 -dinitropropyl) acetal mix 1 : 1 (BDNPF-A), nearly monodispersed low molar mass azido-terminated glycidyl azide polymer (GAP-A), ethylene glycol bis-(azidoacetate) (EGBAA) and 1, 2 -bis-(2 -azidoethoxy) ethane (TEGDA) or BATEG, bis-azido-triethylene glycol, in an amount of 35 mass/%. The cured elastomers were characterized using torsion DMA at several frequencies, and the loss factor curves were described with exponentially modified Gaussian (EMG) distribution functions. Increasing deformation frequency in DMA increases Tg, and an apparent activation energy was correlated with plasticizer performance. The plasticizer ability to decrease Tg follows the order: TEGDA > butyl-NENA > GAP-A > EGBAA > BDNPF-A > TMETN. The ability of each energetic plasticizer could be related to its molecular structure, as well as to its molar mass and interaction possibilities with the polymer chains...|$|R
