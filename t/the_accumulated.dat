5|$|Another {{opponent}} to {{the project}} was the Action Committee Against a Hasty Construction of the Triangle Link, who wanted to delay the decision until after the 1991 municipal elections {{to ensure that the}} municipal councils had backing in the public. Gisle Tjong was another opponent, who stated that the risk in the project was large and that it was uncertain how long the tolls would last: they could just as well last 60 as 15 years. Instead, he wanted to use advanced tolls and fuel fees, place the income in the bank and then pay the whole fixed link with <b>the</b> <b>accumulated</b> funds. Most of the opposition against the project was from Stord, while in Bømlo there was overwhelming support. However, in southern Bømlo there were concerns that they would lose their ferry, as they would have a much longer rout to Haugesund via the Triangle Link. Some also stated that it was necessary to keep a ferry for people with fear of tunnels.|$|E
5|$|At the Norman conquest, most English cathedrals {{were already}} richly endowed, and as major centres of Norman power {{they were then}} able to acquire further lands {{formerly}} held by dispossessed English landowners. Furthermore, the development of tithe as a compulsory tax on agricultural production resulted in greatly increased incomes for incumbent clergy. Although all cathedrals gathered donations from worshippers and pilgrims; in practice major building campaigns were largely, or entirely, funded from <b>the</b> <b>accumulated</b> wealth of the bishop and the chapter clergy. The availability of finance largely determined the speed of construction for major projects. When money was readily available, cathedral works could proceed with great speed. At Winchester, during the Norman period, an entire cathedral of unprecedented size was built from scratch in less than 20 years.|$|E

5|$|During {{the evening}} of June24, Hurricane Celia {{intensified}} into a powerful Category5 storm, further solidifying it as the strongest of the 2010 Pacific hurricane season. At its peak, the cyclone attained winds of 160mph (260km/h) along with a minimum pressure of 921mbar (hPa; 27.2inHg). This ranks it as the second-strongest June hurricane on record, {{as well as the}} eleventh-strongest in the basin, and the second known Category5 to develop during the month on record. The strongest and first known storm of this intensity in June was Hurricane Ava in 1973. Additionally, it also marked the first time on record that two consecutive seasons featured Category5 hurricanes, with Hurricane Rick in October 2009 reaching this intensity, the second time two consecutive seasons had a category 5 hurricane was when hurricanes Marie and Patricia formed in 2014 and 2015 respectively. In the National Hurricane Center's monthly tropical weather summary for June 2010, it was stated that <b>the</b> <b>accumulated</b> cyclone energy (ACE) for the month was the highest on record, most of which is attributed to Hurricane Celia.|$|E

5|$|On {{the surface}} of the white dwarf, the accreted gas will become {{compressed}} and heated. At some point <b>the</b> <b>accumulated</b> gas can reach the conditions necessary for hydrogen fusion to occur, producing a runaway reaction that will drive a portion of the gas from the surface. This would result in a (recurrent) nova explosion—a cataclysmic variable star—and the luminosity of the white dwarf rapidly would increase by several magnitudes for a period of several days or months. An example of such a star system is RS Ophiuchi, a binary system consisting of a red giant and a white dwarf companion. RS Ophiuchi has flared into a (recurrent) nova on at least six occasions, each time accreting the critical mass of hydrogen needed to produce a runaway explosion.|$|E

5|$|The 2007 Pacific {{hurricane}} season was a below-average Pacific {{hurricane season}}, featuring one major hurricane. The season officially started on May15 {{in the eastern}} Pacific and on June1 in the central Pacific, and ended on November 30; these dates conventionally delimit the period during which most tropical cyclones form in the region. The first tropical cyclone of the season, Alvin, developed on May27, while the final system of the year, Kiko, dissipated on October23. Due to unusually strong wind shear, activity fell short of the long-term average, {{with a total of}} 11 named storms, 4 hurricanes, and 1 major hurricane. At the time, 2007 featured the second-lowest value of <b>the</b> <b>Accumulated</b> cyclone energy (ACE) index since reliable records began in 1971.
