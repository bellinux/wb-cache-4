5|$|Coursed mud {{construction}} {{is one of}} the oldest approaches to building walls. Moist mud is formed by hand to make the base of a wall, and allowed <b>to</b> <b>dry.</b> More mud is added and allowed <b>to</b> <b>dry</b> to form successive courses until the wall is complete. With puddled mud, a hand-made mud form is filled with wetter mud and allowed <b>to</b> <b>dry.</b>|$|E

40|$|Although {{considerable}} {{progress has}} been made in enhancing the use and interpretation of free ring shrinkage test, little is known about the impact of the test procedure, the specimen geometry, the surface area-to-volume (S/V) ratio exposed <b>to</b> <b>drying,</b> and the boundary conditions (sealing configuration) on the measured shrinkage. This paper highlights recent findings illustrating the influence of the test procedure, the S/V ratio exposed <b>to</b> <b>drying,</b> the geometry of specimen, and the boundary conditions. A series of experimental results are presented from free shrinkage on ring test specimens to illustrate that the test procedure can significantly influence the measured free shrinkage. A second series of experimental results are presented from specimens with different geometries and S/V ratio exposed <b>to</b> <b>drying</b> <b>to</b> illustrate that <b>drying</b> shrinkage is dependent on both the specimen geometry and the surface exposed <b>to</b> <b>drying.</b> Test results further show that, even for the same S/V ratio exposed <b>to</b> <b>drying,</b> shrinkage is strongly dependent on the specimen’s geometry and boundary conditions...|$|R

5|$|After the cyclone has passed, devastation often continues. Standing {{water can}} cause the spread of disease, and {{transportation}} or communication infrastructure may have been destroyed, hampering clean-up and rescue efforts. Nearly two million people have died globally due to tropical cyclones. Despite their devastating effects, tropical cyclones are also beneficial, by potentially bringing rain <b>to</b> <b>dry</b> areas and moving heat from the tropics poleward. Out at sea, ships {{take advantage of their}} known characteristics by navigating through their weaker, western half.|$|E

5|$|By 1983, {{concerns}} {{with the leadership}} of the Battleship Texas Commission led to the decision by the State Legislature to turn over control of the ship to the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department (TPWD). The legislature abolished the commission effective 31 August 1983, and TPWD assumed operational control the next day. One of the first actions by TPWD was to hire a firm of naval architects to survey the ship in order to assess the deterioration and make recommendations as to what actions should be taken to preserve the ship. The survey revealed that the ship's watertight integrity was badly compromised, the hull was open to the sea in many places, and many compartments were full of standing rain water. The architects determined that the ship needed to go <b>to</b> <b>dry</b> dock for major repairs to the hull and to keep rain water from coming through the porous concrete deck. As part of this plan, serious consideration was given to protecting sensitive fabrics and restoring the interior of the ship. After a five-year-long fund-raising campaign, $15 million was collected <b>to</b> <b>dry</b> dock the ship and complete necessary repairs.|$|E

5|$|Golden jackals are {{extremely}} harmful to fur-bearing rodents, such as coypu and muskrats. Coypu can be completely extirpated {{in shallow water}} bodies. During 1948–1949 in the Amu Darya, muskrats constituted 12.3% of jackal faecal contents, and 71% of muskrat houses were destroyed by jackals. Jackals also harm the fur industry by eating muskrats caught in traps or taking skins left out <b>to</b> <b>dry.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{production}} of active dried starter cultures can be influenced at several {{levels in the}} production process. In this paper the following process factors are discussed: osmotic stress during growth and cell density prior <b>to</b> <b>drying.</b> Contradicting results are {{reported in the literature}} on the influence of osmotic stress during growth on the residual activity after drying. The combined approach in which two process factors were studied at a time resulted in an explanation for the discrepancy in earlier work. The cell density prior <b>to</b> <b>drying</b> had an important influence on the glucose fermenting activity after drying. Residual activities ranging from 0. 10 to 0. 83 were achieved using initial cell densities between 0. 025 and 0. 23 g of cell/g of sample, respectively. The drying tolerance of cells grown with osmotic stress of 1 M NaC 1 was low (residual activity = 0. 06) and was not related to the cell density prior <b>to</b> <b>drying.</b> The influence of osmotic stress during growth on the drying tolerance of Lactobacillus plantarum was dependent on the cell density prior <b>to</b> <b>drying...</b>|$|R
