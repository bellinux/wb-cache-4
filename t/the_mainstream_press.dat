5|$|In {{both the}} 2008 and 2006 United States House of Representatives elections, Kilroy was {{involved}} in close elections for Ohio's 15th congressional district. She lost in 2006 after an election that required the counting of absentee ballots and election recounts. However, after the incumbent retired, she won a similarly close election in 2008. In both cases, she was behind after the Election Day vote tabulations, but made up significant ground with belated absentee ballot voting results. The 2010 election race was widely followed in <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> <b>press</b> as a race that the Republicans were targeting.|$|E
5|$|First {{emerging}} in New York City in 2011, the Occupy movement was an international protest movement against {{social and economic}} inequality, its primary goal being to make the economic structure and power relations in society more favorable to the underclasses. Different local groups have different foci, but among the prime concerns is the claim that large corporations and the global financial system control {{the world in a}} way that disproportionately benefits a minority, undermines democracy and is unstable. It was widely seen as a reaction to the 2008–2012 global recession, an economic crisis that had led to high unemployment across the western world, and was also inspired by the Arab Spring, in which popular protest movements overthrew the governments of several countries in the Arab world. Chomsky became a supporter for the Occupy movement, joining protesters at some of their camps and advocating their cause in <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> <b>press.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gandhi's arrest lasted two years, as he {{was held}} in the Aga Khan Palace in Pune. During this period, his long time {{secretary}} Mahadev Desai died of a heart attack, his wife Kasturba died after 18 months' imprisonment on 22 February 1944; and Gandhi suffered a severe malaria attack. While in Jail, he agreed to an interview with Stuart Gelder, a British journalist. Gelder then composed and released an interview summary, cabled it to <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> <b>press,</b> that announced sudden concessions Gandhi was willing to make, comments that shocked his countrymen, the Congress workers and even Gandhi. The latter two claimed that it distorted what Gandhi actually said on a range of topics and falsely repudiated the Quit India movement.|$|E

25|$|In 1985, Yronwode and the {{cartoonist}} Trina Robbins co-wrote Women and the Comics, {{a book on}} {{the history}} of female comics creators. As the first book on this subject, its publication was noted both by <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> <b>press</b> and the fan press.|$|E
25|$|In {{the process}} of writing and {{releasing}} Voices, Patrick Kroupa stepped out from behind Lord Digital. Instead of status in the hacker underground and notoriety in a sub-culture, Kroupa was being written about as the Jim Morrison of cyberspace and receiving accolades from <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> <b>press.</b>|$|E
25|$|Opponents of {{the legalization}} of {{same-sex}} marriage sometimes characterize it as redefining marriage or redefined marriage, especially in the United States. The term homosexual marriage is generally used by organisations opposed to same-sex marriage such as the Family Research Council in the United States; that term is rarely used in <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> <b>press.</b>|$|E
50|$|Early on, Lifshitz was {{attacked}} in <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> Soviet <b>press</b> {{because of his}} criticisms of Modernist art; {{towards the end of}} his career he was honoured by <b>the</b> <b>mainstream,</b> and yet strongly disliked by the Soviet non-conformist artists.|$|R

25|$|Too Tough to Care is an 18-minute {{educational}} film produced in 1964 to undermine teenage resistance to anti-smoking education.

The film garnered attention in both <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> <b>press</b> as well as academic journals.|$|E
25|$|In May 2012 right-wing {{journalist}} Andrew Breitbart publicized an edited {{video of}} a speech at a NAACP-sponsored Georgia event by USDA worker Shirley Sherrod. <b>The</b> <b>mainstream</b> <b>press</b> repeated his words without criticism, and the organization itself added their own words without properly checking what had happened. The NAACP president and CEO has since apologized.|$|E
25|$|The Triumph of the Moon {{was well}} {{received}} in both academia and <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> <b>press.</b> Various academics {{working in the}} fields of Pagan studies, the history of western esotericism and the history of magic have praised it as an influential study that helped to legitimise the historical investigation of alternate and occult religious movements. An academic anthology edited by Dave Evans and Dave Green was later published in its honour, entitled Ten Years of Triumph of the Moon (2009).|$|E

25|$|No longer playing rather obscure {{progressive}} rock, nor {{the classic}} and hard rock of its Baltimore competitor WIYY, HFS was now formatted more towards a younger set of fans {{who were more}} apt to listen to Green Day and Fuel than less mainstream artists such as Fugazi or Lou Reed. The station played much of the alternative hits that were touted by <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> <b>press</b> and MTV, turning off many old-school HFS listeners, but in turn gaining many listeners in the 18-24 age demographic.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the term}} acid house became more widely used, {{participants}} at acid house-themed {{events in the}} UK and Ibiza made the psychedelic drug connotations a reality by using club drugs such as ecstasy and LSD. The association of acid house, MDMA, and smiley faces was observed in New York City by late 1988. This coincided with an increasing level of scrutiny and sensationalism in <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> <b>press,</b> although conflicting accounts about the degree of connection between acid house music and drugs continued to surface.|$|E
25|$|When the U.S. {{military}} first {{acknowledged the}} abuse in early 2004, {{much of the}} United States media once again showed little initial interest. On January 16, 2004, the United States Central Command informed the media that an official investigation had begun involving abuse and humiliation of Iraqi detainees {{by a group of}} U.S. soldiers. On February 24, it was reported that 17 soldiers had been suspended. The military announced on March 21, 2004, that the first charges had been filed against six soldiers. None of these stories received significant coverage in <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> <b>press.</b>|$|E

25|$|In July 1910 Germans in Omaha rallied {{with other}} {{immigrant}} organizations {{across the city}} to create the National German-American Alliance. At least 54 social, farming and cultural organizations from around Omaha were represented at the first meeting. This alliance brought together many German organizations around Omaha in July 1911 at the city's annual Sängerfest, which was a dance and rally for more than 5,000 attendees. By masking political objectives within a German cultural event, National German-American Alliance leaders were able to openly politicize the event without scrutiny from <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> <b>press.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some {{publications}} that oppose same-sex marriage, such as WorldNetDaily and Baptist Press, have an editorial style policy of placing the word marriage in scare quotes ("marriage") {{when it is}} used in reference to same-sex couples. In the United States, <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> <b>press</b> has generally abandoned this practice. Cliff Kincaid of the conservative Accuracy in Media argued for use of quotation marks {{on the grounds that}} marriage was a legal status denied same-sex couples by most U.S. state governments. Same-sex marriage supporters argue that the use of scare quotes is an editorialization that implies illegitimacy.|$|E
25|$|However, Sperlich {{notes that}} Chomsky has been vilified by {{corporate}} interests, particularly in <b>the</b> <b>mainstream</b> <b>press.</b> University departments devoted {{to history and}} political science rarely include Chomsky's work on their syllabuses for undergraduate reading. Critics have argued that despite publishing widely on social and political issues, Chomsky has no expertise in these areas; to this he has responded that such issues are not as complex as many social scientists claim and that almost everyone is able to comprehend them, {{regardless of whether they}} have been academically trained to do so or not.|$|E
