40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 98 - 120) Entrepreneurs {{in education}} {{have altered the}} services and the delivery of services that the public expects to receive from <b>traditional</b> <b>school</b> <b>systems.</b> Many current innovations require teachers to be more entrepreneurial. Research indicates that entrepreneurial characteristics that contribute to success in other professions may predict success for entrepreneurs in education. Yet, most personality profiles of teachers reveal they do not share entrepreneurs??? risk taking propensities. Thus, promising educational innovations may not be realized because there are insufficient numbers of entrepreneurial teachers to implement them. This quantitative study of 729 California teachers adapted an Entrepreneurial Orientation instrument, widely used in management research, to determine whether teachers in charter, traditional public, and private schools differ along scales of innovativeness, proactiveness, and risk taking. Data from this sample revealed non-significant differences in innovativeness; significantly higher scores among <b>traditional</b> public <b>school</b> teachers and female teachers in proactiveness...|$|R

This {{article examines the}} effects of the most significant of these market-based reforms: charter schools.

Some critics, however, fear that charter schools pose a threat to the <b>traditional</b> public <b>school</b> <b>system.</b> Their central concern, generally referred to as “cream-skimming,” is that the educational choice system created by charter schools privileges those students and parents whose race, class, or educational background afford them a better position to navigate the market for schools. This article will contend that the threat of cream-skimming currently appears unsubstantiated. Additionally, it will posit that charter schools may actually become allies with district schools, potentially aiding in efforts to increase educational funding.
