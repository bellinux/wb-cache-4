40|$|AbstractThe {{government}} wants two tasks to be performed. In each task, unobservable effort can be exerted by a wealth-constrained private contractor. If the government faces no binding budget constraints, it is optimal <b>to</b> <b>bundle</b> <b>the</b> tasks. The contractor {{in charge of}} both tasks then gets a bonus payment {{if and only if}} both tasks are successful. Yet, if the government has only a limited budget, it may be optimal to separate the tasks, so that there are two contractors each in charge of one task. In this case, high efforts in both tasks can be implemented with smaller bonus payments...|$|R

40|$|The {{analytical}} {{literature on}} commodity <b>bundling</b> explains <b>the</b> practice of selling {{two or more}} differentiated products in a single package as a surrogate for direct price discrimination.
