40|$|In recent years, the {{tendency}} in some {{sectors of the}} fishing industry has been to use thicker and stiffer twines {{in the manufacture of}} netting material. This increases the mesh’s resistance to opening and, consequently, reduces the selective performance of fishing gears.

40|$|The {{trend in}} recent years has been that the amount of wild catch is stagnating. In this {{perspective}} the selectivity of fishing gear has become an important issue. The aim of the present work has been to develop a three-dimensional model for the flow in front and inside a net structure, such as a trawl, to be able to predict and calculate selectivity of net structures. A net consist of twines which connect in knots and make up a mesh. The diameter of a <b>twine</b> <b>can</b> be from 1 [mm] in net cages up to a few centimeters in the front part of a trawl. And similar the size of the mesh can be from 1 [cm] up to the order of a meter. Typical Reynolds number range, related to the diameter of a twine, is O(10 2 − 10 4). An examination of numerical results for the drag force on plane net structure demonstrates a strong dependency of the drag force on a net structure with both the geometry, in terms of Solidity ratio, and the Reynolds number. And in particular a non-uniform relation between the drag force and the Solidity ratio. It is evident that for increasing Solidity ratios, flow interaction will become increasingly significant. The physical design of the knot part contributes largely to this flow interaction. The net structure is divided into discrete elements. The twines are modeled as separate cylinders between knots and the knots are modeled as separate spheres. Typically the total number of twines in a trawl could be in the order of 10 6 and it is thus impractical to model every single twine. It is assumed that for a given Reynolds number, keeping the Solidity ratio constant, the total drag on the trawl will be independent on the actual diameter and mesh opening of the net. First each of these different elements is modeled as a set of source distributions and single point sources. The influence from the net on the fluid flow is then calculated by representing the wake generated by each element as source distributions along the structural element. To determine the strength of these sources the principle of Lagally is applied. Then a set of equations is obtained, describing the relation between the fluid velocity and the source strength at every element. Based on this approach, a method is presented to calculate the drag force on net structures with high solidity. The method uses appropriate drag coefficients related to the geometry of the twines and the knots and account for the change in the inflow due to the presence of the net structure and at the same time changes the geometry of the net structure due to the load. Secondly the interaction between the net elements, due to the physical generation of a wake flow behind each individual element of the net, has been studied using a time-averaged wake model. Modifications are applied to the far-field mean velocity deficit mode by Schlichting (1968). This to better describe the the near-field behavior and the added effect of the wake from many individual cylindrical elements. It is shown that the wake model by Blevins (1990) can be used. The method is verified against experiments, as means of calculating the drag on plane nets as a function of Reynolds number, Solidity ratio and angle of attack and gives reasonable good agreement. During the experiments some interesting three-dimensional effects regarding the flow around cylinders were discovered. Negative lift forces occurring on the downstream cylinder in a staggered arrangement is explained as interactions due to upstream generated vortices. To create a three-dimensional method where the inflow on each of the cylinders is corrected due to the presence of all the other cylinders, these two models are added together. Further, a structural analysis of the net structure, using a FEM method, is included in the model. A more complete description of the problem is obtained by combining the change in the inflow due to the presence of the net structure, with a correction of the shape and geometry due to the drag load. Results from numerical simulation of different kinds of net structures, show that the elasticity in the net structure has a significant influence on the resulting geometry and calculated results. Further, the numerical results for net cages have been compared to experimental results. Good agreement between the numerical results and the experimental result is seen. Also the resulting geometry from the experimental results was recreated satisfactory using the present method. For three-dimensional cone shaped net structures, in contrast to net panels and net cages, the presented numerical results do not indicate a large influence on the drag force due to changes in geometry. The agreement between the numerical and experimental results for fluid velocity in front and inside of a three-dimensional net structure, compared to experimental results, was reasonably good. Quantitatively the results do not match exactly, but the characteristics of the flow are recreated. Further, based on the numerical results for the fluid velocity, pressure field in front of a cone is presented. The relative pressure gradient is shown to be minimal, and it is not likely than any fish will detect this change in pressure field neither by direct pressure sensing nor by any sound created from any shed vortices. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E

60|$|Hanburya Mexicana.--The young internodes and {{tendrils of}} this {{anomalous}} {{member of the}} family, revolve {{in the same manner}} and at about the same rate as those of the Echinocystis. The stem does not <b>twine,</b> but <b>can</b> ascend an upright stick by the aid of its tendrils. The concave tip of the tendril is very sensitive; after it had become rapidly coiled into a ring owing to a single touch, it straightened itself in 50 m. The tendril, when in full action, stands vertically up, with the projecting extremity of the young stem thrown a little on one side, so as {{to be out of the}} way; but the tendril bears on the inner side, near its base, a short rigid branch, which projects out at right angles like a spur, with the terminal half bowed a little downwards. Hence, as the main vertical branch revolves, the spur, from its position and rigidity, cannot pass over the extremity of the shoot, in the same curious manner as do the three branches of the tendril of the Echinocystis, namely, by stiffening themselves at the proper point. The spur is therefore pressed laterally against the young stem in one part of the revolving course, and thus the sweep of the lower part of the main branch is much restricted. A nice case of co-adaptation here comes into play: in all the other tendrils observed by me, the several branches become sensitive at the same period: had this been the case with the Hanburya, the inwardly directed, spur-like branch, from being pressed, during the revolving movement, against the projecting end of the shoot, would infallibly have seized it in a useless or injurious manner. But the main branch of the tendril, after revolving for a time in a vertical position, spontaneously bends downwards; and in doing so, raises the spur-like branch, which itself also curves upwards; so that by these combined movements it rises above the projecting end of the shoot, and can now move freely without touching the shoot; and now it first becomes sensitive.|$|R

40|$|Marine {{fish farming}} is an {{important}} and growing industry. Fouling organisms that grow on the net cages and other structural components of the fish farms are a substantial problem for the industry. The overall {{aim of this study}} is to increase the understanding of how the bio fouling influence the hydrodynamic forces on the nets. More specifically the focus is on hydroid growth, and the use of models of net twine with artificial hydroid fouling. The models that were used ar made of two 1. 5 mm steel rods that are twisted together, with short pieces of 0. 32 mm multifilament fishing line fixed between them, similar to a test tube brush. The twisted steel rods were replicating a 3 mm twine, with the fishing lines acting as evenly distributed hydroid growth. Previously drag tests had been done with one and two of these models, with two parallel twines with variyng distance, and also a cross configuration. In the present study the goal was to investigate possible interaction effects between twines, by using various configurations with a higher number of twines; and also make small net sections and estimate the drag increase due to bio fouling. 16 twine models were made, and tests were done with a single twine; and 2, 4, 6 and 8 parallel twines; and also crossing twines, with the same numbers of twines in each direction. In total 18 different configurations were tested, with twine spacings of 12 mm and 24 mm. The experiments were done in a towing tank, with the twine models fixed in a frame, orthogonally to the direction of travel. The drag force was measured on the frame, and the contribution from the frame itself was subtracted from the total force to find the drag on the twine models. Then the drag coefficients were calculated and plotted in various diagrams to visualise any trends. All the configurations were tested at a range of velocities from 0. 05 m/s to 1. 4 m/s. Most of the results were consistent, except for the two lowest velocities (0. 05 m/s and 0. 1 m/s) were the precision error was significant. It was found that the drag coefficient for the fouled twine models were decreasing with increasing current velocity. At 0. 1 m/s (Re = 300) the drag coefficients were between 3. 5 and 4. 0, while for 1. 4 m/s (Re = 4200) they were approximately 3. 0. This is probably either because of deflection of the hydroids at higher velocities, or because the hydroids themselves have a smaller diameter, and hence are in a lower Reynolds number range (from Re = 32 to Re = 448), where the drag coefficient is dependent on the velocity. The variations in drag coefficients between the different model configurations were small, there were some consistent trends, but the magnitude were insignificant. This means that the interaction effects between the twines are relatively small, and it is likely that data from tests with few <b>twines</b> <b>can</b> be extrapolated to net panel applications. The drag coefficients for the net sections in the middle of the cruciform configurations were calculated. For the net sections with 12 mm spacing the results were inconclusive, while for 24 mm spacing the net drag coefficient varied between 0. 66 and 0. 59 for different velocities. This is twice as high as empirical data for a similar clean net. Several possibilities for further work were identified during the work with the thesis. One is to do more similar experiments, both with equivalent models to verify the results, and with either more or less hydroids, to study the influence of the amount of fouling. Another is to try to quantify the bending stiffness of real hydroids compared to the stiffness of the hydroid models (fishing line). The mechanical properties of real hydroids and the hydroid replicas have only been compared qualitatively in previous studies, so quantifying these would be useful both for validation of the models, and for improving them. Further investigations of the drag coefficient of the hydroid stems independently, with regards to the Reynolds number dependency of the drag coefficients of the whole models, would also be interesting...|$|R
60|$|I have {{described}} the above case in some detail, because, as far as I have seen, it is rare to find any special adaptations with twining plants, in which respect they differ much from the more highly organized tendril-bearers. The Solanum dulcamara, as we shall presently see, <b>can</b> <b>twine</b> only round stems which are both thin and flexible. Most twining plants are adapted to ascend supports of moderate though of different thicknesses. Our English twiners, as far as I have seen, never twine round trees, excepting the honeysuckle (Lonicera periclymenum), which I have observed twining up a young beech-tree nearly 4.5 inches in diameter. Mohl (p. 134) found that the Phaseolus multiflorus and Ipomoea purpurea could not, when placed {{in a room with}} the light entering on one side, twine round sticks between 3 and 4 inches in diameter; for this interfered, in a manner presently to be explained, with the revolving movement. In the open air, however, the Phaseolus twined round a support of the above thickness, but failed in twining round one 9 inches in diameter. Nevertheless, some twiners of the warmer temperate regions can manage this latter degree of thickness; for I hear from Dr. Hooker that at Kew the Ruscus androgynus has ascended a column 9 inches in diameter; and although a Wistaria grown by me in a small pot tried in vain for weeks to get round a post between 5 and 6 inches in thickness, yet at Kew a plant ascended a trunk above 6 inches in diameter. The tropical twiners, on the other hand, can ascend thicker trees; I hear from Drs. Thomson and Hooker that this is the case with the Butea parviflora, one of the Menispermaceae, and with some Dalbergias and other Leguminosae. {19} This power would be necessary for any species which had to ascend by twining the large trees of a tropical forest; otherwise they would hardly ever be able to reach the light. In our temperate countries it would be injurious to the twining plants which die down every year if they were enabled to twine round trunks of trees, for they could not grow tall enough in a single season to reach the summit and gain the light.|$|R
40|$|First {{and second}} {{trimester}} gestational age assessment in twins can be reliably done using singleton crown rump length and head circumference charts, respectively. It is logical {{to use the}} biometry of the bigger twin for this purpose as pathological largeness is an unlikely event in early pregnancy. Chorionicity determines the pregnancy outcome of twin pregnancy. Use of first trimester ultrasound markers; number of placental masses lambda and 'T' sign is highly sensitive and specific for the determination of chorionicity. Orientation of the fetuses in twin pregnancy is vital for consistent growth assessment and invasive procedures. Routinely, twins are labelled according to the relative position of the gestational sac which they contain in relation to maternal cervix. However, considerable number of fetuses changes their presenting and birth order in subsequent scan and at birth respectively. Therefore, {{it is wise to}} label twins according to their relative position within the uterus by either left! right (lateral orientation) or top/ bottom (vertical orientation). It has long been recognised that monoamniotic (MA) twins carry very high perinatal morbidity and mortality. Because of this presumed high perinatal mortality, MA twins tend to deliver early. Cord entanglement has been attributed mostly for these losses; however, cord entanglement is a universal finding in MA pregnancies if it has been systematically evaluated by ultrasound. Moreover, most of the pregnancy losses in MA twins are secondary to structural anomalies, twin reverse arterial perfusion (TRAP) and conjoint <b>twining</b> which often <b>can</b> be diagnosed in early ultrasound scan. Once these attributed fetal causes (structural anomalies, TRAP and conjoined twining) have been excluded, fetal survival in MA twins is similar to monochorionic diamniotic twins (MCDA). It is difficult to support a policy for differential timing of delivery in MA and MCDA twin pregnancies. Early pregnancy growth variation has been thought to be valuable in predicting late pregnancy complications. But predictive ability of CRL discrepancy and subsequent fetal loss or birthweight discordance is poor. There is no difference in CRL discordance in dichorionic diamniotic (DCDA) and MCDA twins. However, in depth analysis of CRL discrepancy and specific MCDA complications revealed that selective fetal growth restriction (sFGR) can be reliably screen during fist trimester by CRL discrepancy. If the discrepancy is ~ 7 % the sensitivity would be > 90 % for subsequent development of sFGR in MCDA twins. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

This {{is the case with}} the simpler kinds, which simply curl round an object of moderate thickness, whatever its nature may be. {36} But the genus Bignonia shows us what diversity of action there may be between the tendrils of closely allied species. In all the nine species observed by me, the young internodes revolve vigorously; the tendrils also revolve, but in some of the species in a very feeble manner; and lastly the petioles of nearly all revolve, though with unequal power. The petioles of three of the species, and the tendrils of all are sensitive to contact. In the first-described species, the tendrils resemble in shape a bird's foot, and they are of no service to the stem in spirally ascending a thin upright stick, but they can seize firm hold of a twig or branch. When the stem twines round a somewhat thick stick, a slight degree of sensitiveness possessed by the petioles is brought into play, and the whole leaf together with the tendril winds round it. In B. unguis the petioles are more sensitive, and have greater power of movement than those of the last species; they are able, together with the tendrils, to wind inextricably round a thin upright stick; but the stem does not twine so well. B. Tweedyana has similar powers, but in addition, emits aerial roots which adhere to the wood. In B. venusta the tendrils are converted into elongated three-pronged grapnels, which move spontaneously in a conspicuous manner; the petioles, however, have lost their sensitiveness. The stem of this species <b>can</b> <b>twine</b> round an upright stick, and is aided in its ascent by the tendrils seizing the stick alternately some way above and then contracting spirally. In B. littoralis the tendrils, petioles, and internodes, all revolve spontaneously. The stem, however, cannot twine, but ascends an upright stick by seizing it above with both tendrils together, which then contract into a spire. The tips of these tendrils become developed into adhesive discs. B. speciosa possesses similar powers of movement as the last species, but it cannot twine round a stick, though it can ascend by clasping the stick horizontally with one or both of its unbranched tendrils. These tendrils continually insert their pointed ends into minute crevices or holes, but as they are always withdrawn by the subsequent spiral contraction, the habit seems to us in our ignorance useless. Lastly, the stem of B. capreolata twines imperfectly; the much-branched tendrils revolve in a capricious manner, and bend from the light to the dark; their hooked extremities, even whilst immature, crawl into crevices, and, when mature, seize any thin projecting point; in either case they develop adhesive discs, and these have the power of enveloping the finest fibres.|$|R
40|$|The Walanae Fault Zone {{is a major}} tectonic {{structure}} with prominent geomorphic feature linearly extending over 150 km in NW-SE direction throughout the south arm of Sulawesi. The Walanae fault system comprises of two parallel faults, namely West (WWF) and East Walanae Fault (EWF) which develop along the eastern margin of the Western Mountains Range and the western margin of Bone Mountains, respectively. The geomorphic trace of EWF can {{be recognized as a}} distinct line of slope transformation between Bone Mountains and Walanae Depression, around which Oligocene to Plioscene volcano-sedimentary rocks are intensely deformed (van Leeuwen et al. 2010). Therefore it can be considered that activity of EWF have played a major role of Neogene and Quaternary structural development in this region. The motion of EWF assumed predominance of the sinistral strike-slip {{on the basis of the}} shear sense of neighboring major faults, represented by Masupu fault (Coffield et al. 1993; Guritno et al. 1996). However, the timing and sense of fault motion and related deformations during Neogene and Quaternary have not been little known, as well as the status of recent activity of EWF is not established. The aim of this study is to clarify stress states associated with the activity of the East Walanae Fault and its contribution to the tectonics in South Sulawesi during Neogene and Quaternary. We carried out peleostress analysis using multiple-inversion method from the data both fault-slip and calcite twins. We also suggest possibility of a recent activity of EWF by radiocarbon dating. Fault-slip and calcite twin data were collected in volcano-sedimentary rocks of the Middle Eocene-Middle Miocene of Salokalupang Formation and sedimentary rocks of Middle Miocene-Pliocene of Walanae and Taccipi Formations around the fault zone. Twin lamellae and c-axis orientation of calcite were measured in three mutually perpendicular thin sections for each sample under an optical microscope using universal stage. Determination of paleostress tensor was performed with MIM software (Yamaji et al. 2010). Because the strata in which fault-slip and calcite twin data were collected are highly tilted by folding, the data has been untilted using the software ???KUT??? by Tomita and Yamaji (2003). Both fault-slip and calcite twin data yield consistent stress states through the studied area, predominance of E-W to NE-SW trending ??? 1 with highly to intermediately plunging ??? 3. These stress states could activate EWF as a reverse fault and account for deformation structures and geomorphologic features around the trace of the fault. A minor component of NW-SE to NNE-SSW trending ??? 1 may be a record of strike-slip movement in early tectonic stage. The bedding tilt test suggest that most of meso-scale faults and calcite twins were activated before or early stage of folding. Based on the morphology and percentage of <b>twined</b> grain, it <b>can</b> be estimated that strata around EWF deformed at approximately 1 - 2 km in depth. The activity of EWF is probably consequence of collision of Banda micro continent to the Western Sulawesi since late Miocene. The late Quaternary radiocarbon ages (3050 cal BP and 3990 cal BP) of soils sheared indicate present activity of the EWF...|$|R
6000|$|Now {{stop before}} you condemn her utterly. Because Lady Maria had had, and overcome, a foolish {{partiality}} for her young cousin, was that {{any reason why}} she should never {{fall in love with}} anybody else? Are men to have the sole privilege of change, and are women to be rebuked for availing themselves now and again of their little chance of consolation? No invectives can be more rude, gross, and unphilosophical than, for instance, Hamlet's to his mother about her second marriage. The truth, very likely, is, that that tender, parasitic creature wanted a something to cling to, and, Hamlet senior out of the way, twined herself round Claudius. Nay, we have known females so bent on attaching themselves, that they <b>can</b> <b>twine</b> round two gentlemen at once. Why, forsooth, shall there not be marriage-tables after funeral baked-meats? If you said grace for your feast yesterday, is that any reason why you shall not be hungry to-day? Your natural fine appetite and relish for this evening's feast, shows that to-morrow evening at eight o'clock you will most probably be in want of your dinner. I, for my part, when Flirtilla or Jiltissa were partial to me (the kind reader will please to fancy that I am alluding here to persons of the most ravishing beauty and lofty rank), always used to bear in mind that a time would come when they would be fond of somebody else. We are served a la Russe, and gobbled up a dish at a time, like the folks in Polyphemus's cave. 'Tis hodie mihi, cras tibi: there are some Anthropophagi who devour dozens of us, the old, the young, the tender, the tough, the plump, the lean, the ugly, the beautiful: there's no escape, and one after another, as our fate is, we disappear down their omnivorous maws. Look at Lady Ogresham! We all remember, last year, how she served poor Tom Kydd: seized upon him, devoured him, picked his bones, and flung them away. Now it is Ned Suckling she has got into her den. He lies under her great eyes, quivering and fascinated. Look at the poor little trepid creature, panting and helpless under the great eyes! She trails towards him nearer and nearer; he draws to her, closer and closer. Presently there will be one or two feeble squeaks for pity, and--hobblegobble--he will disappear! Ah me! it is pity, too. I knew, for instance, that Maria Esmond had lost her heart ever so many times before Harry Warrington found it; but I like to fancy {{that he was going to}} keep it; that, bewailing mischance and times out of joint, she would yet have preserved her love, and fondled it in decorous celibacy. If, in some paroxysm of senile folly, I should fall in love to-morrow, I shall still try and think I have acquired the fee-simple of my charmer's heart;--not that I am only a tenant, on a short lease, of an old battered furnished apartment, where the dingy old wine-glasses have been clouded by scores of pairs of lips, and the tumbled old sofas are muddy with the last lodger's boots. Dear, dear nymph! Being beloved and beautiful! Suppose I had a little passing passion for Glycera (and her complexion really was as pure as splendent Parian marble); suppose you had a fancy for Telephus, and his low collars and absurd neck;--those follies are all over now, aren't they? We love each other for good now, don't we? Yes, for ever; and Glycera may go to Bath, and Telephus take his cervicem roseam to Jack Ketch, n'est-ce pas? ...|$|R
