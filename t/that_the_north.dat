5|$|In 2000, {{two studies}} of DNA samples {{from each of}} the whale populations {{concluded}} the northern and southern populations of right whale should be considered separate species. What some scientists found more surprising was the discovery <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Pacific and North Atlantic populations are also distinct, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Pacific species is more closely related to the southern right whale than to the North Atlantic right whale. The authors of one of these studies concluded that these species have not interbred for between 3million and 12million years.|$|E
5|$|At 13:30 Gay {{ordered the}} 8th Cavalry Regiment to {{withdraw}} its men off Ka-san.

However, Holley could not reach anyone in D Company, 8th Engineer Combat Battalion.|$|E
5|$|By 1958, Lê Duẩn {{ranked second}} only to Hồ in the party hierarchy, {{although}} Trường Chinh remained powerful. Lê Duẩn was a party man and never held a post in the government. He made a brief, secret visit to South Vietnam in 1958, writing a report, The Path to Revolution in the South, in which he stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Vietnamese had {{to do more to}} assist the southern fighters. The Central Committee decided to initiate the revolution in January 1959.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, a North Shore Towers {{resident}} {{noticed a}} zip code error when making an online purchase. After further investigation in 2001, {{it was determined}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Shore Towers {{was one of four}} zip codes that were mistakenly charged a Nassau County sales tax of 8.5% instead of the New York City sales tax of 8.25% because the zip codes cross the city line. Residents argued that New York City should receive their tax dollars and not Nassau County. This error was corrected by late 2001.|$|E
5|$|In late 1953, the United States Senate Committee on Government Operations, led by Joseph McCarthy, {{conducted}} {{an investigation of}} up to 1,800 reported incidents of war crimes allegedly committed throughout the Korean War. The Chaplain–Medic massacre {{was one of the}} first to be investigated, and it was here that the incident got its name. Buttrey, the lone survivor of the executions, was called to testify before the committee, and the U.S. Government concluded <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Korean army violated the terms of the Geneva Convention, and condemned its actions.|$|E
5|$|Scholars {{have also}} seen the novel as expressing the values and ideas of the Free Will Movement. In this view, the {{character}} of George Harris embodies the principles of free labor, while the complex character of Ophelia represents those Northerners who condoned compromise with slavery. In contrast to Ophelia is Dinah, who operates on passion. During {{the course of the}} novel Ophelia is transformed, just as the Republican Party (three years later) proclaimed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> must transform itself and stand up for its antislavery principles.|$|E

5|$|Skeptics argue <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> American Union {{exists only}} as a {{proposal}} contained in one of a thousand academic and/or policy papers published each year that advocate all manner of idealistic but ultimately unrealistic approaches to social, economic and political problems. Most of these are passed around in their own circles and eventually filed away and forgotten by junior staffers in congressional offices. Some of these papers, however, become touchstones for the conspiracy-minded and {{form the basis of}} all kinds of unfounded xenophobic fears especially during times of economic anxiety.|$|E
5|$|The next day, American M24 tanks {{attacked}} the roadblock behind the 2nd Battalion {{four times in}} an attempt to break it, but all were unsuccessful, and Lieutenant Colonel Eugene J. Field, the 2nd Battalion commander, was wounded at the roadblock. Palmer sent the 1st Battalion, 5th Cavalry Regiment, and the 16th Reconnaissance Company toward the cut-off battalion. By 12:00, North Korean troops were attacking the 99th and 61st Field Artillery Battalions which were supporting the 2nd Battalion, 8th Cavalry Regiment, indicating <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Korean infiltration had been extensive by that point.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} North Korean forces {{committed}} to the region is not known, however later research suggests <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Korean 6th Division committed at least a battalion to the fight, {{and it is likely}} that an entire regiment was ordered to advance on the Notch and Masan. This would put the range of North Korean forces involved in the battle between 500 and 2,000.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} {{became quite}} tense {{with each of}} the sides making threats and refusing to meet with each other. Maga threatened <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>north</b> would secede if his victory was not validated, and Apithy threatened that his base of Porto-Novo would join with Nigeria. Ethnic tensions increased with these threats and with mass migration of people back to their traditional ethnic territories. Many inside the country considered Dahomey to be close to civil war.|$|E
5|$|The {{terrestrial}} globe is significant in conjecturing that North America {{is separated from}} Asia, unlike the globe of Monachus.

5|$|Although Artigas was {{defeated}} by the Luso-Brazilian armies, his allies Estanislao López and Francisco Ramírez continued hostilities against Buenos Aires for its inactivity against the invasion. Pueyrredón called the Army of the Andes and the Army of the North (led by Belgrano) to aid Buenos Aires in the conflict. Guido noted to San Martín that if both armies did <b>that,</b> <b>the</b> <b>north</b> of Argentina and Chile would be easily reconquered by the royalists. San Martín also knew {{that most of the}} soldiers of the Army of the Andes would not be willing to aid Buenos Aires in the civil war, as most were from other provinces or from Chile. San Martín had doubts as well about the projected arrival of a large military expedition from Spain, as the absolutist restoration of Ferdinand VII had met severe resistance in Spain. San Martín finally kept the Army in Chile when Belgrano's lieutenant Viamonte signed an armistice with López; he thought that the conflict had ended.|$|E
5|$|Although the British were victorious {{over the}} French in the war, King George III's {{government}} felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> American colonies were not paying their way, since little direct tax {{revenue from the}} colonies was received. The Sugar Act of 1764 had its greatest effect in New England and did not cause widespread objection. The Stamp Act the following year affected all 13 colonies, as it required revenue stamps to be used on papers required in trade and in the law. When word of passage of the Stamp Act reached Williamsburg, the House of Burgesses passed the Virginia Resolves, asserting that Virginians had {{the same rights as}} if they resided in Britain, and that they could only be taxed by themselves or their elected representatives. The Resolves were mostly written by a fiery-spoken new member for Louisa County, Patrick Henry.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak {{announced}} in October 1976 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Coast Hiawatha {{would be the}} second train, after the Empire Builder, to receive the new bi-level Superliner coaches, then on order from Pullman Standard. In the end the train was cancelled before the Superliners entered long-distance service. In the spring of 1977 Amtrak added seven hours to the schedule, increasing it to 52 hours 30 minutes. The change was prompted by new speed restrictions on Amtrak trains after a rash of derailments involving the new EMD SDP40F diesel locomotives. In September Amtrak eliminated the off-day ChicagoSt. Paul service, leaving the North Coast Hiawatha with three trips a week. Amtrak reduced the Empire Builder to quad-weekly service as well. The Twin Cities Hiawatha returned as a daytime service between Chicago and Minneapolis.|$|E

5|$|Another {{interpretation}} was <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Vietnamese {{were planning}} to work both ends against the middle. This strategy {{has come to be}} known as the Option Play. If the NVA could take Khe Sanh, all well and good for them. If they could not, they would occupy the attention of as many American and South Vietnamese forces in I Corps as they could to facilitate the Tet Offensive. This view was supported by a captured (in 1969) North Vietnamese study of the battle. According to it, the NVA would have taken Khe Sanh if they could, but there were limits to the price they were willing to pay. Their main objectives were to inflict casualties on US troops and to isolate them in the remote border regions.|$|E
5|$|During the Confederate {{incursion}} {{into the}} North in mid-1863 {{that culminated in}} the Battle of Gettysburg, Confederates twice sent parties to Stevens's Caledonia Forge. Stevens, who had been there supervising operations, was hastened away by his workers against his will. General Jubal Early looted and vandalized the Forge, causing a loss to Stevens of about $80,000. Early said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> {{had done the same}} to southern figures, and that Stevens was well known for his vindictiveness towards the South. Asked if he would have taken the congressman to Libby Prison in Richmond, Early replied that he would have hanged Stevens and divided his bones among the Confederate states.|$|E
5|$|Earlier in the day, {{at about}} 2:30pm, South Vietnamese Colonel Trinh Tieu, Chief of the ARVN 2nd Brigade in II Corps, {{discovered}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>North</b> Vietnamese 316th Infantry Division {{had moved into}} positions south of Ban Me Thuot from their base in Laos. To stop them from advancing any further, Phu ordered his soldiers to destroy every bridge connected to Highway 14. By the time Phu’s order was carried out, elements of the North Vietnamese 316th Infantry Division had engaged in clashes with the South Vietnamese for more than 10 hours. By 5pm the North Vietnamese 8th Battalion, 149th Regiment, {{in combination with the}} 198th Special Forces Regiment, tried but failed to capture Hoa Binh airfield, which was defended by one South Vietnamese ranger battalion.|$|E
50|$|As given above, all the {{formulas}} for <b>the</b> ellipsoid assume <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Northing</b> on <b>the</b> Transverse Mercator projection {{starts from}} zero at the Equator, {{as it does}} in the northern-hemisphere UTM projection.

50|$|Usually {{associated}} with a map projection is a natural origin, e.g., at which the ellipsoid and flat map surfaces coincide.
