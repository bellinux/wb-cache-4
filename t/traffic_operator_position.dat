50|$|TOPS - <b>Traffic</b> <b>Operator</b> <b>Position</b> System is a {{computerized}} operator telephone switchboard designed by Bell-Northern Research Labs for the SP-1 4 Wire Switch {{in the early}} 1970s and still widely used today by toll and directory-assistance operators. The terminals known as 'TOPS Positions' are usually connected to Nortel DMS-100 and DMS-200 telephone switches.|$|E
50|$|The Class 5 switch {{system for}} <b>Traffic</b> <b>Operator</b> <b>Position</b> System (TOPS) enables the {{definition}} of up to 255 unique s of calls to operators—and up to 255 unique profiles defining the responsibilities of operators and teams, that is, the queues from which they can draw calls. This technology was first introduced in the DMS 200/300. Previously, only four queues were available, all straight-line models, forecasted with Erlang distribution algorithms and table look-ups. Now, {{a vast array of}} queues were available, with variable grades of service, served by multiple queues of operators in both primary and secondary capacity. The lookup tables were no longer capable of forecasting for this complex queueing environment.|$|E
5000|$|The special {{requirements}} of placing calls to locations outside main Canadian/United States points meant that these calls were handled by special operators in locations where connections could be monitored to other countries. The technology to automate these connections through [...] "regular" [...] <b>operator</b> <b>traffic</b> <b>positions</b> {{began to develop}} in the 1960s (see Bell Laboratories Record 42:7, July-August 1964). As {{the decade of the}} 1970s progressed, North American customers who were served by electronic offices began to be able to directly dial to an increasing number of international points, a service known as IDDD (International Direct Distance Dialing), (service between ESS offices in New York and London began on March 1, 1970). However, since points could not be connected until equipment in both countries was converted to electronic switching, implementation to many locations took some time, and while the majority of calls began to be connected via automated systems by the 1990s - after the termination of the five-level hierarchy - the majority of countries were still connected via manual intervention until the beginning of the 21st century.|$|R

40|$|The use of CCTV cameras {{has been}} in {{continuous}} expansion for the past 30 years in the transportation industry. As the use of CCTV cameras {{in the field of}} traffic and roadway monitoring continuously expands, systems are beginning to meet with limitations. In the San Francisco Bay Area, <b>Traffic</b> <b>Operators</b> at the Caltrans Traffic Management Center deal with several hundred cameras and monitor hundreds of miles of highways and expressways. This is the reason why Caltrans and MTC have decided to test a video-base incident detection system in order to quickly and efficiently warn <b>Traffic</b> <b>Operators</b> of incidents occurring on the roads. A video-based incident detection system was deployed on 8 existing PTZ cameras monitoring the San Mateo-Hayward Bridge in the San Francisco Bay. The self-learning system image processing algorithm analyses movement and automatically warns <b>Traffic</b> <b>Operators</b> of any vehicle stopped within the field of view of a given camera. The test showed that the system proved to be efficient in detecting accidents or incidents on traffic lanes and also in detecting vehicles pulled-over on the shoulder. The system showed little sensitivity to traffic conditions, night/day, weather conditions and disturbances such as vibrations of the camera...|$|R

40|$|Residues 2, 6, 8 and 10 of Mnt {{repressor}} are {{the major}} determinants of operator DNA binding and recognition. Here, we investigate the interaction of wild-type Mnt and mutants bearing the Arg 2 [...] Lys, His 6 [...] Ala, Asn 8 [...] Ala and Arg 10 [...] Lys mutations with operator DNA modified by methylation or by symmetric base substitutions. The wild-type pattern of methylation interference is altered in specific ways {{for each of the}} mutant proteins. In addition, some of the mutant proteins show a 'loss of contact' phenotype with specific mutant operators. Taken together, these and previous results predict the following contacts between side chains in the Mnt tetramer and operator DNA: Arg 2 recognizes the guanines at <b>operator</b> <b>positions</b> 10 and 12; His 6 contacts the guanines at <b>operator</b> <b>positions</b> 5 and 17; Asn 8 contacts <b>operator</b> <b>positions</b> 4, 7, 15 and 18; Arg 10 contacts the guanines at <b>operator</b> <b>positions</b> 8 and 14.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{the question of}} wh- questions French and the link betweensyntax and pragmatics in this language. French, contrary to all Germanic and most Romance languages, does not use pitch accent to indicate focus domains, but rather a combination of prosodic phrasing and syntactic reformulation. Following a brief discussion of the historical reasons for this situation, the paper examines data from five corpora of oral and written contemporary French and draws {{up a list of}} functional properties {{for each of the four}} basic wh-question forms. A formal analysis is provided, based on the relationship between ground and focus in wh-questions, and the theory of wh-doubling developed for Northern Italian dialects by Poletto & Pollock (2004, 2006). In this analysis two distinct <b>operator</b> <b>positions</b> are available in French, as in other Romance languages: a higher, disjunction <b>operator</b> <b>position,</b> and a lower, restriction <b>operator</b> <b>position.</b> French exploits both positions, alternating between syntactic forms depending on how the question fits into the thematic development of the context...|$|R
