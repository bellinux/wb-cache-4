In his Tōno Monogatari, Kunio Yanagita records a number of beliefs from the Tōno area about women being accosted and even {{impregnated}} by kappa.

25|$|The grace, strength, {{and safety}} of his marking, {{especially}} at full-back, has seldom been matched; and the consistent beauty, length, and accuracy of his drop kicking was wonderful <b>to</b> <b>behold.</b> He was a tough, tenacious, and fearless footballer, able to play through injury and, {{on at least one}} occasion, played with a broken bone in his arm (Hogan, 1996, p.224). Although predominantly a right foot kick, he could kick well with either foot.|$|E

If {{this was the case}} during the period, the cashel of Aileach would have been quite a sight <b>to</b> <b>behold</b> for the local population and the fact that a ringfort of its magnitude was even built shows the importance of its occupants.

25|$|Apart {{from the}} Indian Buddhist traditions {{in the form}} of Viharas seen {{in various parts of the}} country, Tibetan Buddhist monasteries have also made a lasting impact in Karnataka with the influx of {{refugees}} from Tibet who were settled in Bylakuppe. One of the famous monasteries is the Namdroling monastery, built as per traditional Tibetan architecture, which is located in Bylakuppe near Kushalnagar in Kodagu in Karnataka. This spectacular Tibetan Golden Temple is a major tourist spot in the area. It is termed the ‘Charming mini Tibet near Madikeri’. Tibetan refugees have both recreated their lifestyle as well as adapted to the local conditions around the monasteries. Huge golden statues, bright coloured wall paintings all around, gigantic dragons on the pillars in a high and big hall are a sight <b>to</b> <b>behold.</b>|$|E

25|$|After {{an end to}} {{the season}} which many {{believed}} would only spur City on, however, the following season failed to capitalise on any of the gains made in the first two full seasons of Mancini's reign. The transfer window saw virtually no players join the club until {{the last day of the}} season, when a last-minute burst of activity saw four different players all join in the space of around 10 hours. The free-flowing football of the previous season was suddenly rare <b>to</b> <b>behold,</b> and while City rarely seemed likely to drop below second in the table, they posed little title challenge all season. In the UEFA Champions League, the club was eliminated at the group stage for a second successive season, in a result which seemed to confirm Mancini's reputation as far better at managing in domestic games than European, while a second FA Cup final in three seasons ended in a 1–0 defeat to relegated Wigan Athletic. The loss resulted in Mancini's dismissal, ostensibly as he had failed to reach his targets for the season but with many in the press suggesting a break-down of relations between Mancini and his players but also between the Italian and his board-level superiors, while a refusal to promote young players was also cited. In his place was appointed the Chilean Manuel Pellegrini, who boasted a far more impressive Champions League record but less of a reputation for trophy-winning.|$|E

Among the items that were bought with his money were two big bronze candelabras; a silver menorah that [...] "arrived miraculously on the 1st Tevet [...] precisely in time to light the last eight Hanukah candles" [...] and an iron door made under the holy ark for safe-keeping of the candlestick. He also earmarked funds towards the building of an [...] "artistically wrought iron fence around the roof under the upper windows so {{that there be a}} veranda on which may stand all our brethren who go up in pilgrimage <b>to</b> <b>behold</b> our desolate Temple, and also a partition for the womenfolk on the Feast of Tabernacles and Simchat Torah".|$|E

500|$|... "Losing My Religion" [...] became R.E.M.'s {{biggest hit}} in the U.S., peaking at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100. The single stayed on the chart for 21 weeks. It charted at number 19 on the UK Singles Chart, and peaked at No. 16 and No. 11 in Canada and Australia, respectively. Mills said years later, [...] "Without 'Losing My Religion', Out of Time would have sold two or three million , instead of the ten [...] or so it did.

[...] The success of [...] "Losing My Religion" [...] and Out of Time broadened R.E.M.'s audience beyond its original college radio-based fanbase.

500|$|Although Mimi later {{claimed that}} she had bought Lennon's first guitar, it was {{actually}} his mother, after Lennon had pestered her incessantly for weeks. Julia insisted that the £5 instrument had to be delivered to her house and not to her sister's. The two sisters first saw Lennon perform with the Quarrymen at the Woolton St. Peter's Church fête {{on the afternoon of}} 6 July 1957. Julia (who knew that her son would be performing) heard music coming from the field behind the church (now the site of the Bishop Martin School), and pulled Mimi along with her to listen. Lennon saw his aunt coming through the crowd and comically changed the words of a song to feature her name: [...] "Oh-oh, here comes Mimi down the aisle now..." [...] Mimi related two versions of what she thought that day after seeing Lennon on stage: [...] "I was horrified <b>to</b> <b>behold</b> John in front of a microphone", and [...] "as pleased as Punch to see him up there".|$|E

When people praised her {{diamonds}} at the ball, Taylor would make a show of pretending that they were praising the Ping Pong diamond and not its much larger counterparts. Burton wrote in his diary that [...] "Elizabeth's delight in it is a joy <b>to</b> <b>behold</b> and a very quaint thing to witness is the obvious pleasure that other people take in her wearing it.

It really is something <b>to</b> <b>behold</b> in IMAX 3D," [...] concluding that [...] "after being shown only 15 minutes of incredible preview footage, IMAX 3D is the definitive format to see the film." [...] Britt Hayes for Screen Crush felt the footage was [...] "dizzying" [...] and [...] "far weirder and wilder than [...] trailers are letting on," [...] though {{felt it was a}} bit difficult [...] "to judge some of what was shown out of context (especially earlier scenes)". Regarding the same sequence where the Ancient One sends Strange through the multiverse, Hayes said, [...] "Seth Rogen's comedic drug trip sequences have nothing on the psychedelic visuals employed here.

[...] Despite being more interested in the romantic aspirations of the show's characters, Jennifer Godwin of E! remarked that [...] "the Lost mythology is a miracle <b>to</b> <b>behold.</b> [...] It's grandiose, compelling, gaspworthy and, despite what the haters would have you believe, altogether satisfying".
