25|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, Thomas Midgley, Jr. {{improved}} {{the process of}} synthesis and led the effort to use CFC as refrigerant to replace ammonia (NH3), chloromethane (CH3Cl), and sulfur dioxide (SO2), which are toxic but were in common use. In searching for a new refrigerant, requirements for the compound were: low boiling point, low toxicity, and to be generally non-reactive. In a demonstration for the American Chemical Society, Midgley flamboyantly demonstrated all these properties by inhaling a breath of the gas and using it <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>out</b> a candle in 1930.|$|E

25|$|Even when Attewell {{became the}} MCC's chief bowler and {{increased}} his aggreagte of wickets to around 150 from 1889 to 1892, {{he did not}} cement his Test spot, and improving pitches and a severe shortage of support bowling caused Attewell's average <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>out</b> to 21 in 1893 – and his record of 111 wickets at 17.54 in 1894 was disappointing given how much the pitches helped a bowler of his type. Although for the following three years Attewell did remarkably well on all pitches considering Nottinghamshire had no other bowlers even approaching county standard, the great strength of English bowling meant he was not considered for a Test match after 1891. In 1898, Attewell's tireless bowling at last seemed to lose some of its sting, and he failed to reach 100 wickets {{for the first time}} in a decade. The extremely dry summer of 1899 showed Attewell's capacity to bowl and bowl all day really was no more: he took only 29 wickets at the extremely high (even on such pitches) cost of 34.62 – in county matches he took just 19 wickets for 38.73 each.|$|E

Lieutenant Charles Leslie Falkiner of Shannon, {{the leader of the}} boarders who had rushed the maindeck, restored order by threatening <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>out</b> the brains of the next person to fire.

500|$|Moran {{cared for}} Poe at the for-profit Washington College Hospital on Broadway and Fayette Street. He was denied any {{visitors}} and was confined in a prison-like room with barred windows {{in a section}} of the building reserved for drunk people. Poe is said to have repeatedly called out the name [...] "Reynolds" [...] on the night before his death, though no one has ever been able to identify the person to whom he referred. One possibility is that he was recalling an encounter with Jeremiah N. Reynolds, a newspaper editor and explorer who may have inspired the novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket. Another possibility is Henry R. Reynolds, one of the judges overseeing the Fourth Ward Polls at Ryan's Tavern, who may have met Poe on Election Day. Poe may have instead been calling for [...] "Herring", as the author had an uncle-in-law in Baltimore named Henry Herring. In later testimonies Moran avoided reference to Reynolds but mentioned a visit by a [...] "Misses Herring". He also claimed he attempted to cheer up Poe during {{one of the few times}} Poe was awake. When Moran told his patient that he would soon be enjoying the company of friends, Poe allegedly replied that [...] "the best thing his friend could do would be <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>out</b> his brains with a pistol".|$|E
500|$|Despite its {{encapsulation}} {{of their}} concert repertoire {{under the leadership}} of guitarist and composer Barrett, the long, improvisational, freeform structure of the piece is not particularly representative of the group's recorded output. As drummer Mason states in his book , live versions of the song featured many sections that did not appear on the album, and would often last more than 20 minutes. During the band's days playing in residence at London underground clubs such as the UFO (Underground Freak Out), the song usually opened their show. It occupied other positions, including the encore, until it was retired from the band's setlist in 1970. The song had first appeared in live performances in the autumn of 1966. During one performance of the song, at a gig organized by Hoppy Hopkins, Pink Floyd managed <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>out</b> the power of a venue. Hopkins called it [...] "Very cold, very dirty but very nice." [...] After recording session for Piper were over, Pink Floyd played a 30-minute version of [...] "Interstellar Overdrive". Pink Floyd were filmed performing the song for Granada Television's Scene Special documentary, in January 1967 at the UFO Club. A late-Barrett era rendition was recorded live in Rotterdam in November 1967, at the Hippy-Happy Fair. The song was later replaced by [...] "Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun" [...] as {{the main part of the}} band's set lists, after Barrett left the band. A version of [...] "Interstellar Overdrive" [...] was cut from the Ummagumma live album.|$|E

500|$|The main flag weighed about 50 pounds (23kg), {{and it took}} 11 men {{to raise}} it onto a 90-foot (27-meter) flagpole. [...] The result was an {{enormous}} American flag {{that could be seen}} for several miles from the Fort. [...] On October 27, 1813 a receipt was given to Pickersgill and her niece Eliza Young in the amount of $405.90 for the larger flag, and $168.54 for the smaller one (which was also used at Fort McHenry as a storm flag). [...] The small flag may have been flying when the British initially attacked Fort McHenry during the Battle of Baltimore on September 13, because of the inclement weather that night with the driving rainstorm (which would have made the woolen bunting material soggy and too heavy <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>out</b> in any breeze). [...] However, it was Pickersgill's large flag that was flying over the fort at daybreak on September 14, 1814, after the British had ceased firing on the fort. [...] A diary entry from a British sub-altern on board ship and recently returned from the North Point battlefield, George Glebe, described that sunny morning when the Americans at the distant fort [...] "fired their ("wake-up") morning gun salute and raised a splendid ensign" [...] over the battlements. While negotiating a prisoner exchange aboard a British ship, Francis Scott Key saw the flag, and this inspired him to pen the words to the poem [...] "The Defence of Fort McHenry" [...] that later became the National Anthem of the United States in 1931.|$|E
500|$|Two {{hundred years}} after Johnson's death, the posthumous {{diagnosis}} of Tourette syndrome became widely accepted. The condition was unknown during Johnson's lifetime, but Boswell describes Johnson displaying signs of Tourette syndrome, including tics and other involuntary movements. According to Boswell [...] "he commonly held {{his head to}} one side... moving his body backwards and forwards, and rubbing his left knee in the same direction, with the palm of his hand... e made various sounds" [...] like [...] "a half whistle" [...] or [...] "as if clucking like a hen", and [...] "... all this accompanied sometimes with a thoughtful look, but more frequently with a smile. Generally when he had concluded a period, {{in the course of a}} dispute, by which time he was a good deal exhausted by violence and vociferation, he used <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>out</b> his breath like a Whale." [...] There are many similar accounts; in particular, Johnson was said to [...] "perform his gesticulations" [...] at the threshold of a house or in doorways. When asked by a little girl why he made such noises and acted in that way, Johnson responded: [...] "From bad habit." [...] The diagnosis of the syndrome was first made in a 1967 report, and Tourette sundrome researcher Arthur K. Shapiro described Johnson as [...] "the most notable example of a successful adaptation to life despite the liability of Tourette syndrome". Details provided by the writings of Boswell, Hester Thrale, and others reinforce the diagnosis, with one paper concluding: ...|$|E
500|$|According to Vig, Not Your Kind of People evokes ambient vibes of Garbage's {{first two}} albums, Garbage and Version 2.0: [...] "There's lots of {{elements}} of things we've always loved: noisy guitars, big electronic beats, atmospheric film moments", {{adding that the}} band [...] "wanted to make a record sound like something {{that we want to}} hear when we're driving the car." [...] While the record was reminiscent [...] "vibe-wise" [...] of the band's early work, the production aimed for a rawer sound, instead of cleaning up the sound through computers, to [...] "capture a performance" [...] and [...] "sound kind of trashy and for the songs <b>to</b> <b>blow</b> <b>out</b> a little bit." [...] Vig said, [...] "we tried to leave a lot of the performance raw on this album. A lot of the songs, we sort of throw paint at the wall and some of it sticks and some of it drips off." [...] He explained that the group avoided reinventing themselves: [...] "We wanted to just embrace exactly who we are and what we like to do and just sort of update it sonically for 2012. For better or worse, when we approach a song, it's going to end up sounding like Garbage. I think we have a strong sonic identity, and I think that's an asset these days." [...] Manson similarly noted that what mattered most was the record sounding authentic to who they are as a band. Manson considered that while the record recalled the band's classic sound [...] "it fits in with radio programming right now"; She said that they are interested in also reaching a new generation and, regarding their distinct sound, [...] "We don't sound like anyone else on the radio. Much to our surprise there hasn't been another band like ours since we came off the road." ...|$|E
