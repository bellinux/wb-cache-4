50|$|These sharks feed at night, {{preying on}} small fish and invertebrates. They have small teeth {{that can be}} used for {{grasping}} or crushing prey. Soft prey is grasped when the tips of the teeth sink into the flesh, but the teeth pivot backwards when biting hard prey. This protects the <b>tooth</b> <b>tip</b> and allows the flattened front surface of the teeth to form a continuous plate for crushing crabs.|$|E

50|$|Many finer {{details of}} the skull link Gerobatrachus with modern amphibians. Gerobatrachus has a row of very small pedicellate teeth, a feature shared with modern amphibians. Pedicellate teeth are {{characterized}} by two layers of hardened dentine, one at the tooth base and one at the <b>tooth</b> <b>tip,</b> surrounding a middle layer of softer, uncalcified dentine. The palate, which in other amphibians bears many distinguishing characteristics, is poorly preserved in Gerobatrachus. The preserved portion lacks the large palatal teeth commonly found in other temnospondyls. The vomer bone is much shorter in length {{than it is in}} other amphibamids, but similar in proportion to living amphibians. As in most frogs, the palatine bone forms a narrow strip {{along the side of the}} palate. Gerobatrachus possesses another modern amphibian characteristic at the back of the skull, a widened bone called the parasphenoid basal plate. Many of the features that link Gerobatrachus with modern amphibians are also seen in other amphibamids. For example, the amphibamids Amphibamus, Doleserpeton, Eoscopus, and Platyrhinops also have large otic notches; Amphibamus, Doleserpeton, and Tersomius also have pedicellate teeth; and Amphibamus and Doleserpeton also have a wide parasphenoid plate.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Due to the {{simplified}} {{tooth profile}} and the complicated load distribution along the contact line, the traditional analytic method cannot satisfy the accuracy requirement while car-rying out addendum {{modification of the}} helical gears. To overcome this disadvantage, a new way based on cross-section method is presented to calculate the deformation of helical <b>tooth</b> <b>tip.</b> First, the tooth is divided into copies of cross-section along face width and the moment of inertia for each section is calculated. Also, the load is distributed according to length of the contact line, {{and the effect of}} deflected load is taken into account as well. Based on these works, a general formula of helical <b>tooth</b> <b>tip</b> deformation is deduced. Then, this formula is applied to calculate the adden-dum modification width ac. In addition, considering that <b>tooth</b> <b>tip</b> modification will shorten the meshing line, three models used to control length of the remaining meshing line are proposed and addendum modification height hc is defined accordingly. Finally, an instance is given to verify the good agreement between results of this study and those of a finite element model. Apart from this, engineering application of this method is provided...|$|E

30|$|As the {{position}} of the load moves from the start point of meshing to the <b>tooth</b> <b>tip,</b> the bending moment increases with respect to unit-concentrated load, and the bending stress of the tooth root increases correspondingly.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{single layer}} modular permanent magnet machines with either wound or unwound teeth with tooth tips. The structures with wound teeth having tooth tips {{are suitable for}} modular machines with slot number higher than pole number {{to compensate for the}} drop in winding factor due to the flux gaps in alternate stator teeth, accordingly to maintain or even to increase their average torques. However, the structures with unwound teeth having tooth tips are suitable for modular machines with slot number lower than pole number to increase the winding factor and hence to further improve the machine performance. The phase back-EMF, on-load torque, iron and copper losses as well as efficiency have been calculated using finite element analysis for different slot/pole number combinations, and for different flux gap and <b>tooth</b> <b>tip</b> widths. It is found that by properly choosing the flux gap and <b>tooth</b> <b>tip</b> widths, both the on-load torque performance and the efficiency can be optimized for the investigated machines with different slot/pole number combinations. Experiments have been carried out to validate the finite element results...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Method to {{investigate}} the elastic deformation of a flexspline in harmonic driver was developed under assembly force from wave generator and transmission force. Shell element and tapered beam element were applied to model the flexspline cone and the teeth on the flexspline respectively. Forced displacement of the flexspline in assembly state was imposed by contact analysis between the flexspline and wave generator. According to experimental distribution of tangential forces in transmission state, applying forces at the <b>teeth</b> <b>tips</b> on the flexspline in mesh state, deformation distribution under transmission torque loading was obtained. Simulations of assembly state and transmission state were realized in ANSYS software. In three sections of tooth ring vertical to the axis, the deformation distributions of the flexspline under specified displacement in assembly state were compared with the theory results. Deformation between <b>tip</b> of <b>tooth</b> and neutral layer in assembly state and in transmission state were compared respectively. The deformation results agreed well with the theory results in assembly state, while difference was found in tangential displacement on <b>tooth</b> <b>tips</b> in transmission state, which may influence mesh property evidently under transmission loading...|$|R
40|$|Within {{a gearbox}} the {{majority}} of transmission losses {{can be attributed to}} bearing losses, meshing losses, or losses due to windage/churning. In this paper the commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code Fluent 6. 2. 16 is applied in a two-dimensional study of windage power loss (WPL) from a single spur gear rotating in air. By comparing CFD data to published experimental data appropriate grid density and modelling parameters are identified. The model is used to investigate how peripheral shrouding affects WPL and whether WPL can be reduced through minor modifications to <b>tooth</b> <b>tip</b> geometry. Non-dimensional shroud spacings (ratio of gap to gear PCD) of between 0. 005 and 0. 05 were investigated at shaft speeds between 5000 and 20 000 r/min. Although CFD data compared reasonably well to experimental data, trends were not reproduced and an optimum shroud could not be identified. A full three-dimensional study is recommended. Modifying the <b>tooth</b> <b>tip</b> by adding a small chamfer on the leading edge reduced WPL by 6 per cent. A small fillet increased total WPL by a similar amount suggesting that WPL may increase as a gear wears. This preliminary study suggests further work in this area would be beneficial...|$|E
40|$|Two {{concepts}} {{relating to}} gear dynamics were studied. The {{first phase of}} the analysis involved the study of the effect of the speed of a moving load on the dynamic deflections of a gear tooth. A single spur gear tooth modelled using finite elements was subjected to moving loads with variable velocities. The <b>tooth</b> <b>tip</b> deflection time histories were plotted, from which it was seen that the <b>tooth</b> <b>tip</b> deflection consisted of a quasistatic response with an oscillatory response superimposed on it whose amplitude was dependent on the type of load engagement. Including the rim in the analysis added flexibility to the model but did not change the general behavior of the system. The second part of the analysis involved an investigation to determine the effect on the dynamic response of the inertia of the gear tooth. A simplified analysis using meshing cantilever beams was used. In one case, the beams were assumed massless. In the other, the mass (inertia) of the beams was included. From this analysis {{it was found that the}} inertia of the tooth did not affect the dynamic response of meshing cantilever beams...|$|E

A large scale water test facility and a commercial CFD computer program were used to investigate labyrinth seals with rub grooves of actual size and shape found in aircraft engines. The 2 -D test rig cases focused on the effect of tooth position and operating condition for the standard geometry. The computed cases considered tooth axial and radial position, different operating conditions, and several geometric dimensions. This investigation also compares the leakage of the standard geometry to that of a modified convex wall geometry. The test facility is a 33 times enlargement of the actual seal. The pressure drop leakage rate and flow visualization digital images for the standard geometry seal were measured at various Reynolds numbers and at nine different tooth positions. The discharge coefficient and a dimensionless pressure drop number were used to plot the leakage data {{to make it easier for}} seal designers to predict the leakage of labyrinth seals. The experimental visualization results show for a given Reynolds number that the closer the labryinth tooth gets to the step the deeper the throughflow jet penetrated into the seal cavity. The decrease of the <b>tooth</b> <b>tip</b> clearance also has a similar effect. Specifically the smaller the <b>tooth</b> <b>tip</b> clearance the deeper the flow path penetrated into the seal cavity. The experimental measurements show that the <b>tooth</b> <b>tip</b> axial position, as well as the minimum-tooth clearance, affect the leakage. A significant improvement in leakage was generally observed when the minimum-distance tooth clearance occurs across the entire tip of the tooth. This occurs only at the most upstream tooth position tested. Similarly, the computed results show that the tooth axial position affects the seal leakage. It was also found that the leakage of the modified convex wall geometry was significantly less than that of the standard geometry...|$|E

40|$|Steel {{manufacturers}} and stockholders prefer bandsawing for cutting off raw materials {{compared to other}} techniques as it enjoys competitive advantages of higher accuracy of cut, better surface finish, lower kerf loss, better straightness of cut, long tool life and high metal removal rate. Along with the geometries of the bandsaw tooth, bandsaw cutting edge condition (e. g., edge sharpness and burr) significantly affects the cutting performance of a bandsaw. Currently the production of bandsaw is largely done by milling operation due to the scale of manufacturing and the economics of milling compared to other processes (e. g., grinding). Ideally, the bandsaw teeth should possess sharp cutting edges with no burr. In general, two types of burr are commonly seen in the bandsaw teeth manufactured by milling operation namely <b>tooth</b> <b>tip</b> burr and side burr. Current research undertaken at Northumbria University in collaboration with a major bandsaw producer {{is focused on the}} mechanism of burr formation in the bandsaw teeth. This paper briefly outlines the factors affecting the burr formation in bimetal (High Speed Steel edge wire and soft steel backing material) bandsaw teeth manufactured by milling process and suggests the necessary steps to be considered for manufacturing burr free bandsaw with sharp cutting edges. The investigation showed that flank wear in the milling cutter has a major influence on the side burr formation in the bandsaw teeth, whereas <b>tooth</b> <b>tip</b> burr was influenced by both flank wear and ''V'' type notch wear found at the crossover point on the flank face. It was also concluded that TiN coating on the milling cutter could control the burr formation in bandsaw teeth to some degree...|$|E
30|$|The ISO {{standards}} {{specify a}} symmetric form and a pressure angle of 20 ° for a standard rack tool. However, as the pressure angle increases past 20 °, the bending strength {{can be expected}} to increase because of the increase in the tooth root thickness, and the contact pressure strength {{can be expected to}} increase because of the larger profile radius of curvature. Furthermore, although a pressure angle sufficiently greater than the limit of the <b>tooth</b> <b>tip</b> cannot be achieved, this can be solved by making the pressure angle {{on each side of the}} tooth asymmetric. Unidirectional torque transfer is the principal factor in general gearing, so there may be some issues with the strength on the low-pressure side being weaker.|$|E

A large-scale flow visualization test facility is used to conduct an experimental investigation into the leakage resistance and flow characteristics of worn labyrinth seals. Wear in labyrinth seals is a consequence of contact between the rotating and stationary components of the seal, due to thermal expansion, centrifugal growth, and rotordynamic vibration. The test facility is a large-scale, 2 -D planar design, using water as the working fluid. Externally adjustable seal elements, constructed from plexiglass, simulate both straight-through and stepped labyrinth seals. Plexiglass attachments are used to simulate worn <b>teeth</b> <b>tips</b> and rub-grooves in the opposing surface. Two flow visualization methods are used to digitally record flow patterns in the labyrinth seal, and selected images are extracted and enhanced using a computer. Both worn and unworn labyrinth seals are tested over a range of Reynolds numbers, step heights, clearances, and axial offset distances. For all small clearance geometries, the throughflow "pinching" effect, which causes a high speed throughflow and increased turbulence dissipation, heavily outweighs most throughflow trajectory effects in the labyrinth chamber. At larger clearances, other effects contribute to the performance of a seal. One effect is throughflow penetration into the rub-groove cavity of a worn seal, caused by the vena contracts as the throughflow approaches the tooth clearance. If rub-groove penetration occurs, the throughflow trajectory angle into the downstream labyrinth cavity is sometimes altered. The throughflow trajectory angle is another important effect, because it determines if the throughflow directly approaches the downstream tooth, leading to carry-over, or if it approaches at a large angle, giving a larger vena contracts velocity. Another important effect is the presence of large, highspeed recirculation zones in the labyrinth cavity, which lead to greater turbulence. In nearly all cases, a geometry with worn <b>teeth</b> <b>tips</b> performs worse than its counterpart with unworn <b>teeth</b> <b>tips,</b> due to the nozzling effect of the worn teeth. Similarly, for nearly all medium and large clearance cases, a geometry with a rub-groove performed worse than its unworn counterpart. Finally, in general, a seal's leakage resistance coefficient is decreased by increasing the width of the rub-groove...|$|R
