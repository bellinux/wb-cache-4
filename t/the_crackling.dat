25|$|Last week, Frank Hawks {{shuttled}} to East Aurora, N. Y. to {{show off}} his polliwog to a prospect, Sportsman J. Hazard Campbell. He landed neatly on the polo field in a nearby estate at about 5 p.m., climbed out, chatted awhile with Prospect Campbell and a cluster of friends. Presently he and Campbell took off smartly, cleared a fence, went atilt between two tall trees, and passed from sight. Then there was a rending crash, a smear of flame, silence. Half a mile the fearful group raced from the polo field. From <b>the</b> <b>crackling</b> wreck they pulled Frank Hawks; from beneath a burning wing, Prospect Campbell — both fatally hurt. The ship that could not stub its toe aground had tripped on overhead telephone wires.|$|E

500|$|..... {{we turned}} off the dusty French road, through a gateway and into a meadow beside the {{buildings}} of a farm. I saw {{with one of the}} nastiest feelings I have ever had in my life two heavy machine guns inside the meadow ... pointing at the head of our column. The guns began to spit fire ... for a few seconds the cries and shrieks of our stricken men drowned <b>the</b> <b>crackling</b> of the guns. Men fell like grass before a scythe ... I felt a searing pain and pitched forward ... my scream of pain mingled with the cries of my mates, but even before I fell into the heap of dying men, the thought stabbed my brain 'If I ever get out of here, the swine that did this will pay for it.' ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the other}} hand, the future Sentinels would {{resemble}} [...] "giant versions of Mystique" [...] {{to show how}} their technological development was based on studying the shapeshifting mutant's DNA. Thus their design is sleek and feminine, with a body covered in mechanical scales that move {{during the process of}} adapting to a mutant's attack, while also featuring angular and dark faces to enhance the intimidation. The future robots would feature what Singer described as [...] "biomechanical technology to transform to adapt to other mutants, to take on their physicality and some of their powers to use against mutantkind", which the director imagined to be fueled by nanotechnology and [...] "the ability to really change things almost at a molecular level". The Sentinels' heads would also open up as an extra weapon, and for straighter combat the robots could create blades and spikes out of their limbs. <b>The</b> <b>crackling</b> sound of the robots' scales was made by rubbing riveted belts on shale rocks.|$|E
500|$|Rolling Stone named [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] as {{the third}} best song of 2011. The writer concluded, [...] "Brit {{delivers}} the Apocalypse Now of Eurotrash electrotrance disco songs, as that throbbing pulse builds to a pure drop-the-bomb chorus. And that 'whoa-ho-ho' choir sounds like Cher leading an aircraft carrier full of gay sailors." [...] The song was also named {{as the third}} best single of 2011 by Billboard, and commented that it is [...] "Britney's most immediate single since 'Toxic'." [...] Sam Lansky of PopCrush considered [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] the best pop song of 2011, writing, [...] "2011 was already Year of the Spears by January, when Britney Spears' 'Hold It Against Me' topped the charts — but [...] had something even better up her sleeve, <b>the</b> <b>crackling</b> dancefloor barnstormer 'Till the World Ends,' penned by rowdy popstrel Kesha and produced by monster hitmaker Dr. Luke. It's a gargantuan party song with provocative lyrics (“This kitten got your tongue tied in knots,” anyone?), throbbing synths, and a thrillingly euphoric hands-in-the-air chant-along chorus — and there wasn't a more exuberant pop song this year." [...] Digital Spy also considered the track as the best song of 2011, naming it [...] "Britney's best track since 'Toxic'" [...] and commenting, [...] "judging from its chart position, it's also her most underrated hit." [...] The Village Voices Pazz & Jop annual critics' poll ranked [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] as the seventh best song of 2011, tied with Lana Del Rey's [...] "Video Games". [...] "Till the World Ends" [...] was voted by readers as the Best Song of the 2010s on Billboard.|$|E
40|$|Background. <b>The</b> <b>crackles</b> in {{patients}} with interstitial pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) {{can be difficult to}} distinguish from those heard {{in patients}} with congestive heart failure (CHF) and pneumonia (PN).

We studied 39 patients with IPF, 95 with CHF and 123 with PN using a 16 -channel lung sound analyzer.

2500|$|Part 1 was {{released}} worldwide in November 2010 to commercial success along with generally positive reviews, {{some of which}} reflected on Yates' directing style. The Dallas Morning News affirmed that [...] "David Yates' fluid, fast-paced direction sends up <b>the</b> <b>crackling</b> tension of a thriller" [...] and The New York Times analysed Yates' approach to J. K. Rowling's character development by saying that he has [...] "demonstrated a thorough, uncondescending sympathy for her characters, in particular the central trio of Ron Weasley, Hermione Granger and Harry Potter himself." [...] The film was praised for its [...] "dark" [...] atmosphere and its loyalty to the source material, but it was criticised for its slow middle act, the handling of exposition, and the somewhat disjointed pacing.|$|E
2500|$|Signaling {{from her}} new target gave {{executive}} officer Lieutenant Commander Roger Keithly at the conn a final check on the target's bearing, and Tunny released a salvo of six torpedoes from her bow tubes at the large carrier. Her surprise attack completed, Tunny immediately dove amidst the cacophony of depth charges and churning screws. The depth charges rocked the submarine but did no damage; and <b>the</b> <b>crackling</b> and grinding noises heard throughout the ship, {{as well as on}} sonar, led those on board the submarine to believe that their [...] "fish" [...] had found their mark. In all this noise and confusion, Tunny unobtrusively slipped away to the north. Later, examination of Japanese records showed that this attack was ruined by prematures and duds, and that damage to the enemy had been minor. However, the skill and daring with which the raid was conducted remained an example of excellence and prompted the Commander, Submarine Force, Pacific Fleet, to commend Tunnys commander for his actions on this patrol as [...] "an illustrious example of professional competence and military aggressiveness." ...|$|E
2500|$|They {{took the}} three {{children}} {{to the home of}} William Starck, a neighbor, for immediate care. Starck's daughter, Anna Starck Benjamin, who was 4½ years old at the time, remembered [...] "the sound of Hazel's outstretched arms as they brushed against the furniture as they brought her into the house, and took her into my parents' bedroom. <b>The</b> <b>crackling</b> sound as that of frozen laundry brought in off the clothes line in winter. Then I remember the crying, so much crying." [...] They worked over Hazel for hours, trying to revive her, but without success. Hazel's mother, Blanche, was brought to the Starck house after the searchers found the children and sat in a chair, rocking back and forth, while they tended to {{the three children}}. Throughout the night when the children were missing, she had been kept company by neighbors. At one point, she drifted off to sleep, and said later that her daughter had come to her in a dream. In the dream, Hazel said, [...] "I was cold, Mama, but I'm not anymore." ...|$|E

2500|$|Tesla coils {{were also}} used as {{dramatic}} props in early mystery and science fiction motion pictures, starting in the silent era. <b>The</b> <b>crackling,</b> writhing sparks emanating from the electrode of a giant Tesla coil became Hollywood's iconic symbol of the [...] "mad scientist's" [...] lab, recognized throughout the world. This was probably because the eccentric Nikola Tesla himself, with his famous high voltage demonstrations and his mysterious Colorado Springs laboratory, {{was one of the}} main prototypes from which the [...] "mad scientist" [...] stock character originated. Some early films in which Tesla coils appeared were Wolves of Kultur (1918), The Power God (1926), Metropolis (1927), Frankenstein (1931) and its many sequels such as Son of Frankenstein (1939), The Mask of Fu Manchu (1932), Chandu the Magician (1932), The Lost City (1935), and The Clutching Hand (1936) and many later films and television shows. By the 1980s, effects like high voltage sparks were being added to movies by CGI as visual effects in post-production, eliminating the need for dangerous high voltage Tesla coils on sets.|$|E
2500|$|Variable {{resistors}} {{can also}} degrade {{in a different}} manner, typically involving poor contact between the wiper and {{the body of the}} resistance. This may be due to dirt or corrosion and is typically perceived as [...] "crackling" [...] as the contact resistance fluctuates; this is especially noticed as the device is adjusted. This is similar to crackling caused by poor contact in switches, and like switches, potentiometers are to some extent self-cleaning: running the wiper across the resistance may improve the contact. Potentiometers which are seldom adjusted, especially in dirty or harsh environments, are most likely to develop this problem. When self-cleaning of the contact is insufficient, improvement can usually be obtained through the use of contact cleaner (also known as [...] "tuner cleaner") spray. <b>The</b> <b>crackling</b> noise associated with turning the shaft of a dirty potentiometer in an audio circuit (such as the volume control) is greatly accentuated when an undesired DC voltage is present, often indicating the failure of a DC blocking capacitor in the circuit.|$|E
