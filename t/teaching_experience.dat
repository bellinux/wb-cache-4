In 1827 he followed {{with the second}} volume, Lærebog i Mathematiken. Anden Deel (Textbook in Mathematics. Part Two), consisting of a further 155 pages. He used his own <b>teaching</b> <b>experience</b> as the background for his writing; mainly abstract, {{the purpose of the}} books was to instill logical thinking. For instance, in the field geometry, it enticed readers to envisage a figure instead of putting it to paper. The books became widely used, and were reprinted in four and five volumes respectively.|$|E
5|$|In 1949, Baxter {{heard that}} the New South Wales University of Technology {{was looking for a}} {{professor}} of chemical engineering. He applied, and was offered the job. Baxter and his family packed their belongings and sailed to Australia on the ocean liner Orcades, arriving in Sydney on 16 January 1950. They bought a house in Enfield, where Baxter would reside {{for the rest of his}} life. At the time the university was located in temporary accommodation on the grounds of the Sydney Technical College campus in Ultimo. Baxter became the head of a new School of Chemical Engineering that was created on his arrival, but he initially had only one full-time staff member as most of the instruction was carried out by part-time staff. Although he had no previous <b>teaching</b> <b>experience,</b> he turned out to be a good, well-organised lecturer, and he worked closely with his first postgraduate students, whose research was into fields that Baxter had been involved with in England.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} 198 pre-service teachers' intrinsic and extrinsic motivation for becoming teachers {{and focused on}} the distinction between adaptive motives, which promote lasting and effective engagement, and maladaptive motives, which promote superficial engagement. We examined the relationships with teacher self-efficacy, the quality of the teacher training programme, classroom <b>teaching</b> <b>experiences</b> and the time pre-service teachers expect to spend in the profession. The analyses indicated that female pre-service teachers and pre-service teachers with higher prior ability showed more intrinsic adaptive motives. Intrinsic adaptive motives were positively related {{to the quality of the}} teacher training programme and the classroom <b>teaching</b> <b>experiences.</b> Pre-service teachers with positive <b>teaching</b> <b>experiences</b> indicated greater teacher self-efficacy. Pre-service teachers with extrinsic maladaptive motives indicated having had negative <b>teaching</b> <b>experiences</b> and they intended to remain in the profession for shorter periods.

The relationship of these sources and learners’ outcomes are under question; therefore, this study investigated the relationships among sources of teacher pedagogical beliefs, <b>teaching</b> <b>experiences,</b> and student outcomes. The researchers classified these sources into two categories “Experienced Pedagogical Beliefs” and “Educational Pedagogical Beliefs”. To conduct this study, 150 Iranian ELT instructors had been chosen randomly. Their students’ scores were also used in data analysis. A beliefs’ questionnaire and interview were employed to elicit instructors’ sources of pedagogical beliefs.

The research population comprised 126 teachers of Years IV, V, and VI. The sample, consisting of 95 people, was selected by using the proportionate stratified random sampling technique. The data were collected through a questionnaire, and a test. The data on attitudes mathematics, educational backgrounds, motivation, and <b>teaching</b> <b>experiences</b> were collected through a questionnaire, and those on understanding of basic concepts in mathematics through a multiple choice test. The validity of the questionnaire on attitudes, and motivation was assessed through an item analysis and the reliability by the internal consistency using the split-half technique analyzed by the Spearman-Brown formula. The validity and reliability of the test of understanding of basic concepts n mathematics were assessed by iteman. The data were analyzed by path analysis. The results of the descriptive regression analysis show that of teachers of Years IV, V, and VI in Boja District, Kendal Regency is in general in the good category (mean = 53. 42), the attitudes mathematics in the good category, 62. 11 % of teachers with DII PGSD educational backgrounds, motivation in the very good category, and 46, 80 % more than 10 years <b>teaching</b> <b>experiences.</b> The results of the analysis show that the attitudes mathematics give a contribution of 0, 218 the educational backgrounds gives a contribution of 0, 318, the motivation gives a contribution of 0, 495, and the <b>teaching</b> <b>experiences</b> gives a contribution - 0, 030 {{to the understanding of}} basic concepts in mathematics.

25|$|In the Indian {{education}} system, a teacher’s {{success is}} loosely defined. It is either {{based on a}} student’s success or based on the years of <b>teaching</b> <b>experience,</b> both of which do not necessarily correlate to a teacher’s skill set or competencies. The management of an institution could thereby be forced to promote teachers based on the grade level they teach or their seniority, {{both of which are}} often not an indicator of a good teacher. This means that either a primary school teacher is promoted to a higher grade, or a teacher is promoted to take up other roles within the institution such as Head of Department, coordinator, Vice Principal or Principal. However, the skills and competencies that are required for each of them vary and a great teacher may not be a great manager. Since teachers do not see their own growth and success in their own hands, they often do not take up any professional development. Thus, {{there is a need to}} identify a framework to help a teacher chart a career path based on his/her own competency and help him/her understand his/her own development.|$|E

[...] At the same time, she wrote hundreds of tracts, novels and other works for children and the poor, increasing her popularity in both the United States and Britain. The History of Henry Milner (1822) was one of Sherwood's most successful books; children sent her fan mail, begging her to write a sequel—one sent her [...] "ornamental pens" [...] with which to do so.

They have fire. They take walks. They drive. They have pets and holidays." [...] It suited what Hillenburg liked for a show, [...] "something that was fantastic but believable." [...] He also wanted his series to stand out from most popular cartoons of the time exemplified by buddy comedies such as The Ren & Stimpy Show (19911995). As a result, he decided to focus on one main character: the weirdest sea creature that he could think of. This led him to the sponge: [...] "I wanted to do a show about a character that was an innocent, and so I focused on a sea sponge because it's a funny animal, a strange one."

During the school's inaugural year, the school newspaper, The Sugar Beet, was established. In 1913, the high school was accredited by the North Central Association. In 1916, the Garden City School Board set a minimum teaching standard of one year of college and two years of <b>teaching</b> <b>experience</b> for all staff members, and a year later, the high school was accredited by the U.S. Military Academy.
