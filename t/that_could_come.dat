In the arguments that followed, the good <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> about by using the money from such a scheme was frequently overshadowed by a vision of the restraints and penalties levied on the motorist.|$|E
25|$|A later study {{questioned}} {{the attitudes of}} adolescents. When asked about abstinence, many girls reported they felt conflicted. They were trying to balance maintaining a good reputation with trying to maintain a romantic relationship and wanting to behave in adult-like ways. Boys viewed having sex as social capital. Many boys believed that their male peers who were abstinent would not as easily climb the social ladder as sexually active boys. Some boys said that for them, the risks that may come from having sex were {{not as bad as}} the social risks <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> from remaining abstinent.|$|E

500|$|Lincoln {{returned}} to practicing law in Springfield, handling [...] "every {{kind of business}} <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> before a prairie lawyer". Twice a year for 16 years, 10 weeks at a time, he appeared in county seats in the midstate region when the county courts were in session. Lincoln handled many transportation cases {{in the midst of}} the nation's western expansion, particularly the conflicts arising from the operation of river barges under the many new railroad bridges. As a riverboat man, Lincoln initially favored those interests, but ultimately represented whoever hired him. In fact, he later represented a bridge company against a riverboat company in a landmark case involving a canal boat that sank after hitting a bridge. In 1849, he received a patent for a flotation device for the movement of boats in shallow water. The idea was never commercialized, but Lincoln is the only president to hold a patent.|$|E
500|$|California was {{produced}} by John Feldmann and recorded at his studio, Foxy Studios, in Woodland Hills, California between January and March 2016. Feldmann, initially the frontman of the band Goldfinger, became better known for his production work with artists such as 5 Seconds of Summer and All Time Low. Barker {{was the first to}} reach out to Feldmann about producing, as the two were good friends. He had known the members of Blink-182 for over two decades, as the group had previously performed shows with Goldfinger. He is the first new producer to work with Blink-182 since the death of the band's longtime producer, Jerry Finn, who last worked with the band in 2003. Feldmann [...] "worshipped" [...] Finn and his approach to producing. [...] "I never thought there'd be anybody <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> even close to replacing Jerry, and John is really the closest that we've come to someone who could fill that capacity," [...] said Hoppus.|$|E

Chibnall wanted [...] "Cold Blood" [...] in particular to be about the mistakes people make under pressure, and conflict <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> out of protecting a family. The episode is also connected to the series' story arc, as the crack in the universe returns {{at the end of the}} episode. [...] "The Hungry Earth" [...] and [...] "Cold Blood" [...] were filmed in October and November 2009, with scenes in [...] "Cold Blood" [...] shot in Llanwynno, Wales, Cardiff's Temple of Peace, Plantasia, and an array of locations and sets for parts of the Silurian city, which the production team did not want to look like a cave. The episode was watched by 7.49 million viewers in the United Kingdom and received mixed reviews from critics. Some reviewers were disappointed by the plot and characteristics of the Silurians, but the emotional ending was widely praised.|$|E
500|$|A {{favorable}} review from musicOMH's Daniel Paton described Vol. 3s [...] "unpredictable {{and challenging}} but frequently awe-inspiring terrain" [...] {{and gave the}} album four-and-a-half stars out of five. No Ripcord reviewer Stephen Wragg was less impressed, rating it a seven out of ten, but offered that the album was [...] "stacked with jaw-dropping moments, underpinned by seismic emotional shifts." [...] Mark Richardson, writing for Pitchfork Media, awarded Vol. 3 8.1 out of 10.0 and noted Stetson’s [...] "impressive achievement" [...] before concluding that [...] "the result is a sound <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> only from one person on earth." [...] Spin magazine's Richard Gehr described the music as [...] "peerless at conveying isolation, loneliness, and alienation" [...] and scored the album eight out of ten. Rob Young of The Wire praised the album's [...] "extraordinary aural illusionism", noting that Stetson's playing technique finds [...] "timbres in the saxophone's tubing that are rarely brought out." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{opens with}} [...] "Roar", a midtempo synth-driven power pop track. Musically, it {{contains}} elements of arena rock and glam rock, while lyrically {{it is an}} empowerment anthem. Comparisons were established between [...] "Roar" [...] and [...] "Brave" [...] by Sara Bareilles. [...] "Legendary Lovers", a bhangra-based song, deals {{with the ideas of}} karma and infinity. [...] "Birthday" [...] was described by Perry as her own attempt at [...] "writing something Mariah Carey would have put on her first record". Musically, it is a [...] "fluffy" [...] pop song that is primarily styled in the genre of disco. [...] "Walking on Air", the album's second promotional single, is an early 1990s-inspired deep house-Eurodance-disco song, inspired heavily by CeCe Peniston and Crystal Waters. It was produced by Klas Åhlund and Max Martin. [...] "Unconditionally", Perry's personal favorite song on the album and second official single, is a [...] "soaring" [...] power ballad with an [...] "epic chorus". Jason Lipshutz from Billboard noted that the song includes a [...] "woodblock percussion" [...] as well as [...] "a dramatic bass line" [...] and deemed it the album's [...] "most mature offering". Furthermore, he called it [...] "an ode to love that looks past all flaws" [...] and stated that the song acts as a [...] "compellingly grounded predicate" [...] to the title track from Teenage Dream. Perry herself described the song as a song about unconditional love <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> in all forms, including those from relationships, from parent-to-child, and from sibling-to-sibling.|$|E

500|$|In January 1966, Wilson {{commenced}} recording {{sessions for}} the Beach Boys' forthcoming album Pet Sounds, which {{was largely a}} collaboration with lyricist Tony Asher. When the other Beach Boys returned from a three-week tour of Japan and Hawaii, they were presented with {{a substantial portion of}} a new album, with music that was in many ways a jarring departure from their earlier style. [...] According to various reports, the group fought over the new direction. Brian remembers that Carl was enthused with the album, but neither their brother Dennis nor Love were, while Asher recalls that Dennis, Love, and Al Jardine [...] "certainly" [...] expressed frustration with the new music and its lyrics. Love said: [...] "When it got to that period of Brian's life that's when he started doing a lot of drugs. We were touring a lot and we'd come back in and do an album like Pet Sounds, for instance, and some of the words were so totally offensive to me that I wouldn't even sing 'em because I thought it was too nauseating." [...] One of his specific points of objection was the original lyrics of [...] "I Know There's an Answer", then known as [...] "Hang On to Your Ego", a reference to the ego deaths associated with psychedelics. Brian also believed that the band was worried about him separating from the group, and that they [...] "resisted" [...] the increasing number of vocal roles he had given to himself. Love wrote that he [...] "would have liked to have had a greater hand in some of the songs and been able to incorporate more often my 'lead voice,' which we'd had so much success with". Dennis denied that the band disagreed with Brian's direction on Pet Sounds, calling the rumors [...] "interesting," [...] that there was [...] "not one person in the group <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> close to Brian's talent," [...] and that he [...] "couldn't imagine who" [...] would have resisted Brian's leadership.|$|E

2500|$|The {{present day}} Filipinos had {{retained}} the belief of {{life after death}} from their ancestors. Which {{is why it is}} only customary for the present day Filipino to also honor the dead through different practices. Most prominent practice of honoring the dead is by holding a wake as way for the loved ones to properly mourn the death of one that is dear to them. Most Filipino Christians hold the wake at the funeral homes but others also hold them at their own household wherein the wake would be held for three to seven days and the family members would be required to either black or white during the procession. [...] Unlike their Christian brethren, the Filipino Muslims are required to bury the dead 24 hours after the time of death. This custom dates back during the time where the spread of disease was prominent, the Muslims prompted to bury the corpse as soon as possible for sanitary reasons such as avoiding the widespread disease <b>that</b> <b>could</b> <b>come</b> from the rotting corpse.

2500|$|Roberts co-wrote {{every song}} on the album, with the {{exception}} of The Korgis song [...] "Everybody's Got to Learn Sometime" [...] which she covered for the record.

In an interview with Rolling Stone Roberts was questioned on her concept for the record, where she stated that she wished to avoid a record produced under guidelines of regular pop music. She found that producing an [...] "electro" [...] record helped her produce an innovative record, she found that after working with the Girls Aloud producer Xenomania that she was used to [...] "breaking pop rules" [...] something which she continued with during the production of Cinderella's Eyes.
