In September 1799, he {{was present at the}} Second Battle of Zürich when Masséna's Army of Helvetia and Army of the Danube crushed Alexander Rimsky-Korsakov's Russian force; he {{actively}} harried <b>the</b> <b>fleeing</b> Russians. He later fought at the Battle of Messkirch in 1800.|$|E
5|$|At 00:16, Scott {{ordered his}} ships {{to turn to}} a heading of 330° {{in an attempt to}} pursue <b>the</b> <b>fleeing</b> Japanese ships. Scott's ships, however, quickly lost sight of Gotō's ships, and all firing ceased by 00:20. The American {{formation}} was beginning to scatter, so Scott ordered a turn to 205° to disengage.|$|E
5|$|Herodotus {{tells us}} that, on seeing {{the outcome of}} the battle hung in the balance, the {{disarmed}} Samians had joined in {{on the side of the}} allies, doing what they could. This inspired the other Ionian contingents to turn on the Persians as well. At which stage in the battle this happened is not clear; the Samians were presumably not in the main battle line (being disarmed), so it may have been after the Persians retreated to the camp. Meanwhile, the Milesians who were guarding the passes of Mycale also turned on the Persians. At first they misdirected <b>the</b> <b>fleeing</b> Persian contingents so that they ended up back amongst the Allied troops; then, perhaps seeing {{the outcome of the}} battle was certain, they began killing <b>the</b> <b>fleeing</b> Persians.|$|E

5|$|It is <b>the</b> <b>fleeing</b> Troilus whom swift-footed Achilles catches, {{dragging}} {{him by the}} hair from his horse. The young prince takes refuge in the nearby temple. But the warrior follows him in, and beheads him at the altar before help can arrive. The murderer then mutilates the boy's body. The mourning of the Trojans at Troilus' death is great.|$|E
5|$|The Ottoman wars instigated great {{demographic}} changes. Croats migrated towards Austria and {{the present-day}} Burgenland Croats are direct descendants of these settlers. To replace <b>the</b> <b>fleeing</b> Croats, the Habsburgs {{called on the}} Orthodox populations of Bosnia and Serbia to provide military service in the Croatian Military Frontier. Serb migration into this region peaked during the Great Serb Migrations of 1690 and 1737–39.|$|E
5|$|William's {{disposition}} of his forces implies {{that he planned}} to open the battle with archers in the front rank weakening the enemy with arrows, followed by infantry who would engage in close combat.

5|$|Following the Battle of Inchon and {{subsequent}} Second Battle of Seoul, the North Korean Army was largely defeated, and the 19th Infantry {{was one of}} the units of the Eighth United States Army which pursued <b>the</b> <b>fleeing</b> North Koreans north of the 38th Parallel with the intention of reuniting the country. However, beginning in October 1950, the People's Republic of China conducted the First Phase Offensive, a surprise attack against the advancing United Nations forces, which were unprepared to counter the offensive. By early November, Red Cloud and his unit had advanced to the Ch'ongch'on River.|$|E
5|$|In October 1899, he saw {{his first}} combat action when he led 300 Marines to take the town of Noveleta, from Filipino rebels known as Insurrectos. In the initial moments of the assault, his first {{sergeant}} was wounded. Butler briefly panicked, but quickly regained his composure and led his Marines in pursuit of <b>the</b> <b>fleeing</b> enemy. By noon the Marines had dispersed the rebels and taken the town. One Marine had been killed and ten were wounded. Another 50 Marines had been incapacitated by the humid tropical heat.|$|E
5|$|In {{the battles}} of Modrica and Meçad 7,000 Ottoman forces were left {{dead on the}} {{battlefield}} along with thousands of horses. The Albanians had suffered 1,000 casualties themselves and, in their exhaustion, they refused to pursue <b>the</b> <b>fleeing</b> Ottoman forces. Hamza Pasha and his staff were ransomed to the sultan. Raimon d'Ortafà reported Skanderbeg's victory to Alfonso who received it with great exuberance. Skanderbeg's victory over a ruler even more powerful than Murad came as a great surprise to the Albanians. Skanderbeg's reputation among his allies was redeemed and the Dukagjini opted for a reconciliation.|$|E

5|$|Late at night, the Royalist generals reached York, {{with many}} routed troops and stragglers. The Governor of York, Sir Thomas Glemham, allowed {{only those who}} were part of the {{garrison}} (in effect, only a few officers who had participated in the battle as volunteers) into the city, in case Parliamentarian cavalry entered the city on the heels of <b>the</b> <b>fleeing</b> Royalists.

5|$|On January 3, Brigadier General Hugh Mercer of the Continental Army {{clashed with}} two regiments {{under the command}} of Lieutenant Colonel Charles Mawhood of the British Army. Mercer and his troops were overrun, and Mercer was mortally wounded. Washington sent a brigade of militia under Brigadier General John Cadwalader to help them. The militia, on seeing the flight of Mercer's men, also began to flee. Washington rode up with {{reinforcements}} and rallied <b>the</b> <b>fleeing</b> militia. He then led the attack on Mawhood's troops, driving them back. Mawhood gave the order to retreat and most of the troops tried to flee to Cornwallis in Trenton.|$|E

5|$|Rostislav was {{actively}} engaged in World War I until {{the collapse of the}} Black Sea Fleet in the beginning of 1918. She was the first Russian ship to fire on enemy targets on land during World War I, the first to be hit by a German airstrike, and the first to destroy a submarine, albeit a Russian one. In April 1918 <b>the</b> <b>fleeing</b> Bolsheviks abandoned Rostislav in Sevastopol. A year later the British occupation forces permanently disabled her engines. The White forces used the ship as a towed floating battery, then scuttled her in the Strait of Kerch in November 1920.|$|E
5|$|The Mirabello group {{engaged the}} Austro-Hungarian cruisers at 07:00, but were heavily outgunned, and instead {{attempted}} to shadow <b>the</b> <b>fleeing</b> cruisers. At 07:45, Rear Admiral Acton's ships encountered the destroyers Csepel and Balaton. After 20 minutes, the Italian destroyers {{were able to}} close {{the distance to the}} Austro-Hungarian ships; the two groups engaged in a short artillery duel before a shot from Csepel struck Aquila and disabled the ship's boilers. By this time, the Austro-Hungarian destroyers were under the cover of the coastal batteries at Durazzo, and were able to make good their escape.|$|E

5|$|Trigg was {{appointed}} to the Virginia Land Court Commission in 1779, charged with settling land titles in Kentucky. He then settled in Kentucky himself. In 1782, a raiding party of Shawnee Indians led by British and Loyalist officers attacked Bryan Station, but were driven off. Kentucky militia companies then pursued <b>the</b> <b>fleeing</b> invaders. Trigg commanded half of the men, Daniel Boone the other. Ignoring Boone's warnings of a trap, the militiamen charged into an Indian ambush at Blue Licks. Trigg and many others, including Boone's youngest son, were killed. Trigg's body was later found cut into pieces.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{casualties}} of the Army of the North were not substantial, {{it was left}} demoralized and disbanded. Goyeneche pursued <b>the</b> <b>fleeing</b> patriots, and captured Huaqui after his victory. The inhabitants of Upper Peru welcomed the royalists back, so the army had to quickly leave those provinces. However, the resistance of Cochabamba prevented the royalists from proceeding to Buenos Aires. Castelli moved to the post of Quirbe, and received orders to return to Buenos Aires for trial. However, {{by the time he}} was notified, new orders had been issued: Castelli should be confined at Catamarca, while Saavedra himself took charge of the Army of the North. Saavedra was deposed as soon as he left Buenos Aires, and was confined to San Juan. The First Triumvirate, which had commenced governing by then, required Castelli to return.|$|E
5|$|As the {{invasion}} began, the Germans pursued <b>the</b> <b>fleeing</b> Red Army, leaving a security vacuum. Reports surfaced of Soviet guerrilla {{activity in the}} area, with local Jews immediately suspected of collaboration. Heydrich ordered his officers to incite anti-Jewish pogroms in the newly occupied territories. Pogroms, {{some of which were}} orchestrated by the Einsatzgruppen, broke out in Latvia, Lithuania, and Ukraine. Within the first few weeks of Operation Barbarossa, 40 pogroms led to the deaths of 10,000 Jews, {{and by the end of}} 1941 some 60 pogroms had taken place, claiming as many as 24,000 victims. However, SS-Brigadeführer Franz Walter Stahlecker, commander of Einsatzgruppe A, reported to his superiors in mid-October that the residents of Kaunas were not spontaneously starting pogroms, and secret assistance by the Germans was required. A similar reticence was noted by Einsatzgruppe B in Russia and Belarus and Einsatzgruppe C in Ukraine; the further east the Einsatzgruppen travelled, the less likely the residents were to be prompted into killing their Jewish neighbours.|$|E
