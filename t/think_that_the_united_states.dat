40|$|Based {{on media}} coverage, one would <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> {{were in a}} modern day {{literacy}} crisis thanks particularly to new digital technologies such as videogames. Recent publications include books with titles such as “the collapse of literacy {{and the rise of}} violence in the electronic age ” (Sanders, 1995) 1. Survey experts report that videogames are now “the fourth most dominant medium, displacing print media ” (Mandese, 2004). Meanwhile, news reports quote researchers as stating, “students will be doing more and more bad things if they are playing games and not doing other things like reading aloud [italics added]” (Wearden, 2001) 2. This concern about videogames somehow replacing literacy activities is perhaps best summed up in a recent New York Times editorial by Solomon (2004), who states that electronic activities – videogames given as the quintessential example – are “torpid, ” “by and large invite inert reception, ” and are one of the primary causes behind the “closing of the American book ” (Weber, 2004).

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{claim that}} video games are {{replacing}} literacy activities that is bandied {{about in the}} American mainstream press is based not only on unspecified definitions of both ‘games ’ and ‘literacy’ but also on a surprising lack of research on what children actually do when they play video games. In this article, the author examines some of the practices that comprise game play {{in the context of}} one genre of video games in particular – massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs). Based on data culled from a two-year online cognitive ethnography of the MMOG Lineage (both I and II), the author argues that forms of video game play such as those entailed in MMOGs are not replacing literacy activities but rather are literacy activities. In order to make this argument, the author surveys the literacy practices that MMOGamers routinely participate in, both within the game’s virtual world (e. g. social interaction, in-game letters) and beyond (e. g. online game forums, the creation of fan sites and fan fiction). Then, with this argument in place, she attempts to historicize this popular contempt toward electronic ‘pop culture ’ media such as video games and suggest a potentially more productive (and accurate) framing of the literacy practices of today’s generation of adolescents and young adults. Based on media coverage, one would <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> were in a modern-day literacy crisis, thanks particularly to new digital technologies such as video games.

40|$|Greenhouse gas {{reductions}} {{would cost}} some nations {{much more than}} others and benefit some nations far less than others. Significant reductions would impose especially large costs on the United States, and recent projections suggest that the United States has relatively less to lose from climate change. In these circumstances, what does justice require the United States to do? Many people believe that the United States is required to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions beyond the point that is justified by its own self-interest, simply because the United States is wealthy, and because the nations most at risk from climate change are poor. This argument from distributive justice is complemented by an argument from corrective justice: The existing 'stock' of greenhouse gas emissions owes {{a great deal to}} the past actions of the United States, and many people <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> should do a great deal to reduce a problem for which it is largely responsible. But there are serious difficulties with both of these arguments. Redistribution from the United States to poor people in poor nations might well be desirable, but if so, expenditures on greenhouse gas reductions are a crude means of producing that redistribution: It would be much better to give cash payments directly to people who are now poor. The argument from corrective justice runs into the standard problems that arise when collectivities, such as nations, are treated as moral agents: Many people who have not acted wrongfully end up being forced to provide a remedy to many people who have not been victimized. The conclusion is that while a suitably designed climate change agreement {{is in the interest of}} the world, a widely held view is wrong: Arguments from distributive and corrective justice fail to provide strong justifications for imposing special obligations for greenhouse gas reductions on the United States. These arguments have general implications for thinking about both distributive justice and corrective justice arguments in the context of international law and international agreements.

40|$|This {{is quite}} a {{remarkable}} book. It consists of six lectures delivered at the Williamstown Institute of Politics by a distinguished Englishman-lectures in which he undertakes, in a broad sweep, to analyze and explain,the legal relations between belligerents and neutrals in time of war, and -to propose possible solutions for the present conflict of views. Recognizing what {{he claims to be}} confusion and uncertainty in the subject {{and the fact that the}} United States and Great Britain seem to entertain different views upon it, he undertakes to discuss the policies and justifications which led to the adoption of the British practices in the late war and indicates how far these might be modified in the future. Without once explaining to the reader the underlying reasons for the whole structure of maritime law in this respect, namely, the distinction between combatant and non-combatant and the necessity for a working compromise between belligerent military and neutral trading privileges, he presents what in the main must be regarded as a defense of the British practices in the late war as the natural and presumably lawful outcome of the 2 ̆ 2 logic 2 ̆ 2 of the existing rules-practices which the British Government, during the War, did not venture to excuse on any other ground than that of retaliation for enemy illegality. He freely admits that Great Britain by these measures-which in fact ultimately wiped out any neutral rights-controlled the trade of the world; but he suggests that she would not resort to these extremes in an ordinary war, but only in an extraordinary war (p. 49). He intimates that the solution of the question of freedom of the seas in the future lies in a distinction to be made between just wars and unjust wars-the 2 ̆ 2 just 2 ̆ 2 belligerent to have a fairly free hand which neutrals shall concede, the 2 ̆ 2 unjust 2 ̆ 2 belligerent to be greatly restricted. Presumably if one cannot tell which is the 2 ̆ 2 just 2 ̆ 2 side-and that would be in most cases-the objective law shall prevail. Lord Percy is not impressed with the practicality of League wars against aggressors or with the possibility of abolishing the status of neutrality. He admits that the conflict (which he occasionally seems to consider, though it is believed incorrectly, one between the continental view and the Anglo-Amerlcan view) must be settled before a new war breaks out. But he concedes that an international conference would not be appropriate because it would probably make matters worse, and suggests that the better mode of procedure would be for private groups of experts, first an Anglo-American group, endowed with a statesmanlike outlook, to undertake drafts of proposed rules to be submitted for consideration to governmental bodies and public opinion, in order thus to accomplish the desired end with the least friction.

40|$|The {{dramatic}} Republican {{loss of the}} House and Senate {{has been}} widely interpreted as {{a critique of the}} Bush administration’s international strategy, leading to the departure of Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld and UN Ambassador John Bolton. However elections are a blunt instrument, raising questions about what Americans do not like about US international strategy. Is it simply that Americans are frustrated about the situation in Iraq, or do Americans differ with other aspects of US strategy? What international problems would they emphasize? Which policies would they change? The Bush administration came into office with an apparent determination to be less constrained than previous administrations when it comes to using military force. Do Americans believe {{that there has been a}} change in the world’s perception of US readiness to use military power? If so, do they think this has helped or hurt US security? What do Americans think has been the effect of the United States’ invasion of Iraq? In 2003, PIPA found a large majority assumed that the war in Iraq decreased the likelihood that Iran and other problem countries would try to acquire weapons of mass destruction. What do they think now? How do Americans feel about how the United States is dealing with Iran? The Iranian government claims to be enriching uranium solely for its nuclear energy program, while others in the international community, including the United States and the United Nations Security Council, suspect that Iran is seeking to develop nuclear weapons. The Bush administration has resisted entering into talks with Iran until it first stops enriching uranium. Do Americans believe this is the best approach? Do Americans think that threats of air strikes will dissuade Iran from enriching uranium? Do they see air strikes as a viable military option? Do Americans <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> should be willing to negotiate a compromise with Iran? How do Americans feel about how the United States is dealing with Iraq? The Iraq Study Group has released its report calling for engaging Iran and Syria, holding an international conference and gradually drawing down US forces. Is American public opinion in line with these proposals? How do Americans feel about how the United States is dealing with North Korea? Do Americans feel that the United States should be willing to offer security guarantees or provide aid if North Korea gives up its nuclear weapons? To address these and other questions WorldPublicOpinion. org conducted a poll with a nationwide sample of 1, 326 Americans, Nov. 21 - 29. It was developed in conjunction with the conference, “Leveraging U. S. Strength in an Uncertain World”, to be held by the Stanley Foundation Dec. 7 at the Ronald Reagan Building, 1300 Pennsylvania Ave., Washington, D. C. The poll was designed by the Program on International Policy Attitudes at the University of Maryland.

[...] Many <b>think</b> <b>that</b> increasing <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States' welfare state generosity would lower the working poverty rate.

Furthermore, although Western European economies' growth rates can be lower than the US's from time to time, their growth rates tend to be more stable, whereas the US's tends to fluctuate relatively severely.

I will admit <b>that</b> <b>the</b> motives of the investigation may have been excellent, and probably were; my criticism bore mainly on matters of form and also on the point of efficiency. In that respect I have nothing to retract. The Senators of the Commission had absolutely no knowledge and no practice to guide them in the conduct of such an investigation; and this fact gave an air of unreality to their zealous exertions. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> even in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> States there is some regret that this zeal of theirs was not tempered by a large dose of wisdom. It is fitting that people who rush with such ardour to the work of putting questions to men yet gasping from a narrow escape should have, I wouldn't say a tincture of technical information, but enough knowledge of the subject to direct the trend of their inquiry. The newspapers of two continents have noted the remarks of the President of the Senatorial Commission with comments which I will not reproduce here, having a scant respect for the [...] "organs of public opinion," [...] as they fondly believe themselves to be. The absolute value of their remarks was about as great as the value of the investigation they either mocked at or extolled.
