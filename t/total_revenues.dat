5000|$|The {{fact that}} a {{monopoly}} has a downward-sloping demand curve means {{that the relationship between}} <b>total</b> <b>revenue</b> and output for a monopoly is much different than that of competitive companies. <b>Total</b> <b>revenue</b> equals price times quantity. A competitive company has a perfectly elastic demand curve meaning that <b>total</b> <b>revenue</b> is proportional to output. Thus the <b>total</b> <b>revenue</b> curve for a competitive company is a ray with a slope equal to the market price. A competitive company can sell all the output it desires at the market price. For a monopoly to increase sales it must reduce price. Thus the <b>total</b> <b>revenue</b> curve for a monopoly is a parabola that begins at the origin and reaches a maximum value then continuously decreases until <b>total</b> <b>revenue</b> is again zero. <b>Total</b> <b>revenue</b> has its maximum value when the slope of the <b>total</b> <b>revenue</b> function is zero. The slope of the <b>total</b> <b>revenue</b> function is marginal revenue. So the revenue maximizing quantity and price occur when MR = 0. For example, assume that the monopoly’s demand function is P = 50 − 2Q. The <b>total</b> <b>revenue</b> function would be TR = 50Q − 2Q2 and marginal revenue would be 50 − 4Q. Setting marginal revenue equal to zero we have ...|$|R
