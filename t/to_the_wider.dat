5|$|Due to {{uncertainty}} {{over whether the}} object would be classified as a planet or a minor planet, because different nomenclature procedures apply to these different classes of objects, the decision on what to name the object {{had to wait until}} after the August 24, 2006, IAU ruling.

5|$|During the 20th century both choral and organ musical {{components}} {{developed to}} a high standard and were integral to the liturgy at St James'. In addition, music was offered <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wider</b> community {{in the form of}} recitals, often in ways that elucidate the liturgy and take advantage of church acoustics and sacred settings. Weekday recitals, such as the organ recitals given in 1936 of music by Bach, continued in addition to the music played on Sundays.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, Heathen organisations {{emerged in the}} United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, and Iceland, largely {{independently}} from each other. This has been partly attributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wider</b> growth of the modern Pagan movement during the 1960s and 1970s, {{as well as the}} development of the New Age milieu, both of which encouraged the establishment of new religious movements intent on reviving pre-Christian belief systems. Further Heathen groups then emerged in the 1990s and 2000s, many of which distanced themselves from overtly political agendas and placed a stronger emphasis on historical authenticity than their 1960s and 1970s forebears.|$|E

5|$|On 9 January 2011, Bristol East MP Kerry McCarthy {{gave her}} {{support to the}} idea of a public DNA {{screening}} process if the police found it useful. The Avon and Somerset Constabulary had conducted mass DNA screening during the 1995 investigation into the disappearance of Louise Smith. McCarthy suggested that the screening process should be extended beyond Clifton <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wider</b> Bristol area. DNA that had been found on Yeates' body was tested for a potential profile. Detectives also began tracking the movements of several hundred registered sex offenders living within their jurisdiction to determine the individuals' whereabouts on 17 December.|$|E
5|$|Since the Mantra-Rock Dance {{brought the}} Hare Krishna {{movement}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wider</b> {{attention of the}} American public, Prabhupada's increased popularity attracted {{the interest of the}} mainstream media. Most notably, he was interviewed on ABC's The Les Crane Show and lectured on the philosophy of Krishna consciousness on a KPFK radio station program hosted by Peter Bergman. Prabhupada's followers also spoke about their activities on the San Francisco radio station KFRC.|$|E
5|$|The A354 road is {{the only}} land access to Portland, via Ferry Bridge, {{connecting}} to Weymouth and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wider</b> road network at the A35 trunk road in Dorchester.

Formerly a branch line railway, connecting to the South West Main Line near Weymouth railway station, also crossed to the island. The corridor is now a cycle path connecting Fortuneswell with Weymouth and a wider network of traffic-free cycle paths.|$|E

5|$|The intense {{international}} exchange produced several cosmopolitan humanist scholars, including Francisco de Holanda, André de Resende and Damião de Góis, {{a friend of}} Erasmus who wrote with rare independence on the reign of King Manuel I. Diogo and André de Gouveia made relevant teaching reforms via France. Foreign news and products in the Portuguese factory in Antwerp attracted the interest of Thomas More and Dürer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wider</b> world. There, profits and know-how helped nurture the Dutch Renaissance and Golden Age, especially after {{the arrival of the}} wealthy cultured Jewish community expelled from Portugal.|$|E
5|$|The post-colonial {{discourse}} {{presented in}} Orientalism, also influenced post-colonial theology and post-colonial biblical criticism, by which method the analytical reader approaches a scripture {{from the perspective}} of a colonial reader.

Another book in this area is Postcolonial Theory (1998), by Leela Gandhi, explains Post-colonialism to how it can be applied <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wider</b> philosophical and intellectual context of history.|$|E

5|$|Troop cars saw service through 1947, {{after which}} many were {{sold by the}} U.S. Army Transportation Corps to the railroads and {{subsequently}} converted into mail cars, express service boxcars, or refrigerator cars, while others remained in sleeper configuration for use in maintenance of way (MOW) service as bunk cars for the maintenance workers.

5|$|As a {{registered}} charity, Stonyhurst {{is obliged to}} provide benefits <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wider</b> community {{under the terms of}} the Charities Act 2006. As such, the College is home to the local Catholic parish church, which receives worshippers from Hurst Green every day. Its sports facilities, including the swimming pool and all-weather pitch are available for public use; the latter was used for competitors training for the London 2012 Olympic Games. Much of the estate has public access; in particular the gardens and tea house are visited during the summer months, whilst the college plays host to tours, antiques fairs, food festivals, music concerts, conferences and weddings. The school has relationships with several state schools, arranging shared activities with their pupils, in particular those serving special needs children. In addition, the school makes available some places to pupils offered on scholarship, bursaries or free of charge; almost a third of current pupils receive financial support for their places.|$|E
5|$|Carr Hill {{performs}} {{poorly in}} comparison <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wider</b> borough {{in terms of}} economic activity and opportunity. Some 42% of children in the ward live in poverty, the second-highest figure in Gateshead. The adult unemployment rate is 7%, compared to 5% borough-wide, the joint third-highest figure in Gateshead. Youth unemployment is 10%, also the joint third-highest in the borough. The income of residents is £24,000; £3,000 below the regional median. Carr Hill has only 70 VAT-registered businesses, compared to a borough average of 230. Only 2.6% of residents are self-employed, compared to 4.5% of the borough and 8.3% nationally. Overall, Carr Hill falls within the most deprived 20% of regions in England according to the Index of Multiple Deprivation in 2010.|$|E

5|$|Each {{successive}} rank {{gave its}} holder greater pensions and legal privileges. The highest rank, of full marquess, {{came with a}} state pension and a territorial fiefdom. Holders of the rank immediately below, that of ordinary marquess, received a pension, but had no territorial rule. Officials who served in government belonged <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wider</b> commoner social class and were ranked just below nobles in social prestige. The highest government officials could be enfeoffed as marquesses. By the Eastern Han period, local elites of unattached scholars, teachers, students, and government officials began to identify themselves {{as members of a}} larger, nationwide gentry class with shared values and a commitment to mainstream scholarship. When the government became noticeably corrupt in mid-to-late Eastern Han, many gentrymen even considered the cultivation of morally grounded personal relationships more important than serving in public office.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to inflicting significant casualties on Indonesian forces, the successful Australian ambushes on the Sungei Koemba, and later at Kindau, in May and June allowed 3 RAR {{to dominate the}} border area, while also providing early warning of Indonesian incursions into Sarawak. Following these actions Major General George Lea, the British Director of Operations, ordered a short pause in offensive operations in order to observe the effects. Indonesian mortar attacks on company bases in the 3 RAR area of operation, which had been heavy throughout May and June, ceased soon afterwards. Following the resumption of Claret operations the Australian battalion later followed this up with another profitable mission at Babang on 12 July, contributing <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>wider</b> success of the British-Commonwealth forces in slowly asserting control on the war.|$|E

The Candlestick Park concert {{at the close of}} the 1966 U.S. tour marked the end of a four-year period dominated by touring and concerts, including nearly sixty U.S. appearances, and over one thousand four hundred internationally. The Beatles, from the end of their 1966 U.S. tour until their break-up in 1970, gave no further commercial concerts, instead devoting their efforts to creating new material in the recording studio.|$|E
