5|$|Most ionic {{compounds}} {{are very}} brittle. Once {{they reach the}} limit of <b>their</b> <b>strength,</b> they cannot deform mealleably, because the strict alignment {{of positive and negative}} ions must be maintained. Instead the material undergoes fracture via cleavage. As the temperature is elevated (usually close to the melting point) a ductile–brittle transition occurs, and plastic flow becomes possible by the motion of dislocations.|$|E

5|$|The {{scattered}} {{nature of}} the airborne landings caused some confusion among the German high command. At the LXII Corps headquarters, several reports of the landings exaggerated <b>their</b> <b>strength,</b> causing the Germans to believe they were faced with a far greater force. Also, 600 dummy paratroops that had landed {{to the north and}} west of Toulon, as part of the Allied deception plan, convinced the Germans another landing had taken place there.|$|E
5|$|Although the Battle of Pelagonia has {{frequently}} {{been described as}} a decisive turning point, Michael VIII Palaiologos' gains were rapidly reversed and his rivals quickly regained <b>their</b> <b>strength,</b> with both the Epirotes and Manfred of Sicily reclaiming most of the territories they had lost. Nevertheless, the effects of the battle were not wholly undone: Palaiologos' victory, gained with the assistance of John Doukas, not only prevented the Epirote–Latin league of 1259 from taking Thessalonica and much of Nicaea's European domains, but also provided a valuable breathing space in the lead-up to the eventual recovery of Constantinople in 1261, which led to the re-establishment of the Byzantine Empire under the Palaiologan dynasty.|$|E

5|$|Egypt {{invaded the}} newly {{declared}} State of Israel on May 15, 1948. <b>Their</b> <b>strength</b> was approximately one division, commanded by Major General Ahmed Ali al-Mwawi. Their advance was three-pronged: The main column moved north through what is today the Gaza Strip and attacked Kfar Darom, another column went east toward Beersheba, {{and a third}} attacked kibbutz Nirim. On May 17, a small force split off from Beersheba to link up with more Egyptian forces at Auja al-Hafir, on May 19 the main column attacked Yad Mordechai, and on May 20, the main force in Beersheba set out to link with the Jordanian Arab Legion in Hebron.|$|E
5|$|French tirailleurs {{occupied}} the dominant positions, especially {{one on a}} knoll overlooking {{the square of the}} 27th. Unable to break square to drive off the French infantry {{because of the presence of}} French cavalry and artillery, the 27th had to remain in that formation and endure the fire of the tirailleurs. That fire nearly annihilated the 27th Foot, the Inniskillings, who lost two-thirds of <b>their</b> <b>strength</b> within that three or four hours.|$|E
5|$|Intense {{tropical}} cyclones pose {{a particular}} observation challenge, {{as they are}} a dangerous oceanic phenomenon, and weather stations, being relatively sparse, are rarely available {{on the site of}} the storm itself. In general, surface observations are available only if the storm is passing over an island or a coastal area, or if there is a nearby ship. Real-time measurements are usually taken in the periphery of the cyclone, where conditions are less catastrophic and its true strength cannot be evaluated. For this reason, there are teams of meteorologists that move into the path of tropical cyclones to help evaluate <b>their</b> <b>strength</b> at the point of landfall.|$|E

It was {{a chance for the}} Australian bowlers to gain a psychological advantage, with Len Hutton, Denis Compton and Bill Edrichthree of England's first four batsmenall playing. Australia won by an innings to give an indication of <b>their</b> <b>strength.</b>|$|E
5|$|Over {{the next}} five days, the ROK 31st Regiment was {{involved}} in a bitter struggle with the Chinese defenders underground. The PVA 45th Division had also infiltrated small units into UN positions every night to resupply the trapped units and to evacuate the wounded, causing heavy casualties among the Chinese logistics and medical units. As there was no battalion level combat between October 20 and October 29, the Chinese were able to gather <b>their</b> <b>strength</b> for a decisive blow.|$|E
5|$|Plasticity: The synapses between {{parallel}} {{fibers and}} Purkinje cells, and the synapses between mossy fibers and deep nuclear cells, are both susceptible to modification of <b>their</b> <b>strength.</b> In a single cerebellar module, input from {{as many as}} a billion parallel fibers converges onto a group of less than 50 deep nuclear cells, and the influence of each parallel fiber on those nuclear cells is adjustable. This arrangement gives tremendous flexibility for fine-tuning the relationship between the cerebellar inputs and outputs.|$|E

5|$|The Abbasids {{were unable}} to exploit their success due to the {{internal}} instability of the Caliphate. Likewise, the Byzantines preferred to focus <b>their</b> <b>strength</b> against the ongoing conquest of Sicily by the Aghlabids. Thus, a Byzantine embassy was sent to Baghdad in 845, which was warmly received. The Abbasids reciprocated with an embassy to Constantinople, where the two states agreed on a truce and a prisoner exchange, which {{was held at the}} river Lamos on 16 September 845. A winter raid by the Arab governor of Tarsus shortly after failed disastrously, after which the Arab-Byzantine frontier remained quiet for six years.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure of}} Coastal Command to acquire any {{tangible}} results prompted the Admiralty to complain to the Air Ministry on 5 November 1940. In December {{it was agreed}} that 15 of the planned new 100 RAF squadrons be given to Coastal Command. These were to be operational by 1941. In the interim, four aircraft were to be given to each of the squadrons to bolster <b>their</b> <b>strength,</b> while a further Beaufort fighter and Beaufort torpedo bomber squadron were also made available.|$|E

Every two turns lasts one in-game day and units are available to enter combat phases once a day is finished.|$|E
