40|$|In a {{previous}} paper the authors presented {{a model of}} assessing portfolios, the Cognitive Model for Assessing Portfolios (CMAP), as a lens to view, think about, and make decisions about portfolio projects. Two projects in which the CMAP has been used are described. One is an authentic assessment project in mathematics and science by the Educational Testing Service in Atlanta (Georgia), {{and the other is}} the reform of assessments in the Wyoming (Michigan) school district. The clear focus of <b>the</b> <b>Atlanta</b> <b>project</b> is on student outcomes. The entire project is systematically designed to produce outcomes that can be summarized 2. ross individuals and groups. The focus of the Michigan project is far more diverse, with generally defined outcomes and a more general assessment design. Atlanta represents a positivist and psychometric model of assessment while Wyoming (Michigan) represents a constructivist point of view, with the portfolio seen as a learning environment. Portfolio assessment is better suited to the constructivist model, in that efforts to apply the positivist model to portfolios invariably impose meanings that are different from those created by the learner.

40|$|A MASTERS OF PUBLIC HEALTH CAPSTONE PROJECT: GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEMS ANALYSIS OF WALKABILITY DATA FOR <b>THE</b> <b>ATLANTA</b> BELTLINE COMMUNITIES By MICHALE HAIA KANCHIK July 21, 2017 INTRODUCTION: As a {{means of}} combating the growing obesity {{epidemic}} in the United States, public health experts are promoting the building of walkable communities. Using walkability data initially collected for <b>the</b> CDC’s <b>Atlanta</b> Beltline <b>Project,</b> this study will examine select features of the built environment {{and their relationship to}} active people. This capstone is seeking to explore factors present in the built environment that are related to physical activity AIM: Using <b>the</b> <b>Atlanta</b> Beltline <b>Project’s</b> segment-level walkability data, this capstone will aim to deliver a micro-scale analysis of pedestrian walkability features. The author believes that completing a spatial analysis of the data, will allow developing a tangible product that will further enhance and benefit the works of <b>the</b> CDC’s <b>Atlanta</b> Beltline <b>Project.</b> In addition, by utilizing Geographic Information Systems (GIS), this capstone hopes to deliver valuable information on the physical environments and walkability patterns that most currently portray Atlanta Beltline segments. METHODS: Methods used in this study include an extensive review of existing literature, descriptive analysis of environmental attributes, mapping, and spatial analysis using Geographic Information Systems (GIS) technology. RESULTS: Overall, Atlanta Beltline segments with a bus stop exhibited the highest presence of active people (26. 3 percent). Beltline segments that had broken/boarded windows/vacant buildings/homes demonstrated the second highest presence of active people (21. 21 percent). Streets with trees for shade had the lowest presence for active people (17. 99 percent). Substantial differences in the presences of active people were found when making a comparison between the control (Westside) and experimental (Southside) Beltline communities. Study findings are all based on the descriptive nature of the analysis performed, and as a result, do not intend to demonstrate statistical significance. DISCUSSION: Study findings indicate that the presence of certain built environment features may promote walkability along <b>the</b> <b>Atlanta</b> Beltline communities.

We are motivated by <b>the</b> 4 D <b>Atlanta</b> <b>project</b> at Georgia Tech, which aims to create a system that takes a collection of historical imagery of a city and infers a 3 D model parameterized by time. Here {{it is necessary to}} recover, from historical imagery, metric and semantic information about buildings that might no longer exist or have undergone extensive change. Current approaches to automated 3 D model reconstruction typically recover only geometry, and a systematic approach that allows hierarchical classification of structural elements is still largely missing. We extract metric and semantic information from images of facades, allowing us to decode the structural elements in them and their inter-relationships, thus providing access to highly structured descriptions of buildings. Our method is based on constructing a Bayesian generative model from stochastic context-free grammars that encode knowledge about facades. This model combines low-level segmentation and high-level hierarchical labelling so that the levels reinforce each other and produce a detailed hierarchical partition of the depicted facade into structural blocks.

40|$|The primary {{intent of}} this study is to examine the impact of {{governmental}} regulations on Small Business Enterprises located at the Campbellton Plaza. Campbellton Plaza is one of the fourteen commercial districts in Atlanta which has been targeted for revitalization by <b>the</b> City of <b>Atlanta.</b> <b>The</b> <b>project</b> is a joint venture operated by Southwest Economic Development Corporation, the Citizens and Southern National Bank, <b>the</b> <b>Atlanta</b> Economic Development Corporation, Georgia State University Small Business Program and the Bureau of Planning.

Although this study is confined to the Campbellton Plaza, it is hoped that the study will contribute to a better understanding of the impacts of the governmental regulations on small business in general by the readers of this paper.

40|$|During <b>the</b> <b>Atlanta</b> Supersite <b>Project,</b> four {{particle}} mass spectrometers were operated {{together for}} the first time: NOAA's Particle Analysis by Laser Mass Spectrometer (PALMS), University of California at Riverside's Aerosol Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (ATOFMS), University of Delaware's Rapid Single-Particle Mass Spectrometer II (RSMS-II), and Aerodyne's Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (AMS). Although these mass spectrometers are generally classified as similar instruments, they clearly have different characteristics due to their unique designs. One primary difference is related to the volatilization/ionization method: PALMS, ATOFMS, and RSMS-II utilize laser desorption/ionization, whereas particles in the AMS instrument are volatilized by impaction onto a heated surface with the resulting components ionized by electron impact. Thus mass spectral data from the AMS are representative of the ensemble of particles sampled, and those from the laser-based instruments are representative of individual particles. In addition, the AMS instrument cannot analyze refractory material such as soot, sodium chloride, and crustal elements, and some sulfate or water-rich particles may not always be analyzed with every laser-based instrument. A main difference among the laser-based mass spectrometers is that the RSMS-II instrument can obtain size-resolved single particle composition information for particles with aerodynamic diameters as small as 15 nm. The minimum sizes analyzed by ATOFMS and PALMS are 0. 2 and about 0. 35 μm, respectively, in aerodynamic diameter. Furthermore, PALMS, ATOFMS, and RSMS-II use different laser ionization conditions. Despite these differences the laser-based instruments found similar individual particle classifications, and their relative fractions among comparable sized particles from Atlanta were broadly consistent. Finally, the AMS measurements of the nitrate/sulfate mole ratio were highly correlated with composite measurements (r^ 2 = 0. 93). In contrast, the PALMS nitrate/sulfate ion ratios were only moderately correlated (r^ 2 ∼ 0. 7) ...|$|R
