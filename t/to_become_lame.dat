40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to investigate transitions between foot conformation, lameness and footrot in sheep. Data came from one lowland flock of approximately 700 ewes studied for 18 months. Multilevel multistate analyses of transitions between good and poor foot conformation states in ewes, and lame and non-lame states in ewes and lambs were conducted. Key results were that the longer sheep had feet in good conformation, the more likely they were to stay in this state; similarly, the longer a ewe was not lame the more likely she was not <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>lame.</b> Ewes with poor foot conformation were more likely <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>lame</b> (OR: 1. 83 (1. 24 - 2. 67)) and to be > 4 years (OR: 1. 50 (1. 09 - 2. 05)). Ewes with footrot were less likely to move to good foot conformation (OR: 0. 48 (0. 31 - 0. 75)) and were more likely <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>lame</b> (OR: 3. 81 (2. 60 - 5. 59)). Ewes lame for > 4 days and not treated with parenteral antibacterials had a higher risk of developing (OR: 2. 00 (1. 08 - 3. 61)), or remaining in (OR: 0. 49 (0. 29 - 0. 95)) poor foot conformation compared with ewes never lame. Treatment of ewes lame with footrot with parenteral antibacterials increased the probability of transition from a lame to a non-lame state (OR: 1. 46 (1. 05 - 2. 02)) and these ewes, even if lame for > 4 days, were not more likely to develop poor foot conformation. The risk of a ewe becoming lame increased when at least one of her offspring was lame (OR: 2. 03 (1. 42 - 2. 92)) and when the prevalence of lameness in the group was ≥ 5 % (OR: 1. 42 (1. 06 - 1. 92)). Lambs were at increased risk of becoming lame when they were male (OR: 1. 42 (1. 01 - 2. 01)), single (OR: 1. 86 (1. 34 - 2. 59)) or had a lame dam or sibling (OR: 3. 10 (1. 81 - 5. 32)). There were no explanatory variables associated with lambs recovering from lameness. We conclude that poor foot conformation in ewes increases the susceptibility of ewes <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>lame</b> and that this can arise from untreated footrot. Treatment of ewes lame with footrot with parenteral antibacterials leads to recovery from lameness and prevents or resolves poor foot conformation which then reduces the susceptibility to further lameness with footrot...|$|E
30|$|Horse {{models of}} {{osteoarthritis}} {{are considered to}} be particularly useful because the articular cartilage of horses and subchondral bone thickness are the closest to those of humans out of any of the animals commonly used in research [54]. Horse models have several other advantages. The large size of the joint allows OA to be induced via arthroscopic surgery. Further arthroscopies can be performed at a later time to observe changes over time in the joint [54]. The most commonly used model to induce OA in horses is arthroscopically created osteochondral fragment-exercise model. This model, which was developed by McIlwraith et al. is considered to be better than other horse models of OA because it induces progressive OA without creating instability, which is common in other models and often causes the horse <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>lame</b> [54].|$|E
40|$|Feet {{and legs}} issues {{are some of}} the main causes for sow removal in the US swine industry. More timely {{lameness}} detection among breeding herd females will allow better treatment decisions and outcomes. Producers will be able to treat lame females before the problem becomes too severe and cull females while they still have salvage value. The objective {{of this study was to}} compare the predictive abilities and accuracies of weight distribution and gait measures relative to each other and to a visual lameness detection method when detecting induced lameness among multiparous sows. Developing an objective lameness diagnosis algorithm will benefit animals, producers and scientists in timely and effective identification of lame individuals as well as aid producers in their efforts to decrease herd lameness by selecting animals that are less prone <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>lame.</b> In the early stages of lameness, weight distribution and gait are impacted. Lameness was chemically induced for a short time period in 24 multiparous sows and their weight distribution and walking gait were measured in the days following lameness induction. A linear mixed model was used to determine differences between measurements collected from day to day. Using a classification tree analysis, it was determined that the mean weight being placed on each leg was the most predictive measurement when determining whether the leg was sound or lame. The classification tree’s predictive ability decreased as the number of days post-lameness induction increased. The weight distribution measurements had a greater predictive ability compared with the gait measurements. The error rates associated with the weight distribution trees were 29. 2 % and 31. 3 % at 6 days post-lameness induction for front and rear injected feet, respectively. For the gait classification trees, the error rates were 60. 9 % and 29. 8 % at 6 days post-lameness induction for front and rear injected feet, respectively. More timely lameness detection can improve sow lifetime productivity as well as animal welfare...|$|E

5000|$|Luxating patellas (slipping kneecaps) {{are another}} common defect {{considered}} to be genetic in Yorkies, although {{it may also be}} caused by an accidental fall. Weak ligaments and tendons in the knee or malformed (too shallow) patellar grooves, allow the patella to slip out of its groove sideways.

Over time, the patellar ridges can become worn down, making the groove even more shallow and causing the dog <b>to</b> <b>become</b> increasingly <b>lame.</b> [...] Surgery is the main treatment option available for luxating patellas, although it is not necessary for every dog with the condition. The severity of luxating patellas are on a scale of 1-4, with 4 being the most severe. Many dogs will not develop past a stage 1 or 2.|$|R
40|$|Lameness {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} endemic diseases of cattle, particularly in the dairy sector. It has a significant impact on health and welfare and leads to a range of production losses. This article reviews the English language peer reviewed literature on the impacts of lameness in cattle on measures of health and production. There is a wealth of evidence from around the world demonstrating that lameness reduces milk yield. The extent of the reductions identified is difficult to summarise, however when losses have been calculated across a whole lactation, most are between 270 and 574 kg. It is noteworthy that there is now strong evidence that lameness is a disease of high milk production i. e. high yielding animals are more likely <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>lame.</b> The impacts of lameness on nutrition and body condition appear complex. Overall the literature suggests that lameness leads to a reduction in the time spent feeding. A positive correlation between low body condition score and lameness has been demonstrated in a range of studies. Historically it was considered that lame cows lost weight as a consequence of the largely negative impacts of disease, on nutrition. Increasingly, evidence is appearing which suggests that the association between body condition score and lameness may in fact be the other way around i. e. high yielding cows which loose body condition during periods of negative energy balance become lame. The effect of lameness on fertility, measured in studies from around the world, is unequivocal. Lameness has substantial negative effects on fertility performance and reproductive parameters across a wide range of areas. Evidence on the association between lameness and culling is mixed. The majority of published work suggests that animals which suffer from lameness are more likely to be culled, although the converse has also been demonstrated. A review of the literature in this area demonstrates just how substantial the negative effects of lameness are on cattle health and production. The impacts are wide ranging and significant from both a welfare and an economic performance perspective. Further work is urgently required to control this important and prevalent condition...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this dissertation was to evaluate multiple approaches to incorporating sow longevity or lifetime sow productivity into a selection program. Sow longevity can be selected for using indicator traits, such as structural soundness and lameness. In the first study, objective measurements to detect sow lameness were examined. Lameness was chemically induced {{for a short time}} period in multiparous sows and their weight distribution and walking gait were objectively measured in the days following lameness induction. Using a classification tree analysis, it was determined that the mean weight being placed on each leg was the most predictive measurement when determining whether the leg was sound or lame after injection. The weight distribution measures had a greater predictive ability compared to the walking gait indicators. These measures could be used to select sows that are less likely <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>lame</b> and be removed from the breeding herd. While reducing the lameness instances in a herd would improve sow longevity, direct selection for longevity would be desirable. In the second study, genetic correlations between purebred and crossbred sow longevity were estimated. Most genetic improvement programs are based on an assumed relationship between purebred performance in a nucleus herd and their relatives 2 ̆ 7 crossbred performance in a commercial herd; however, this study found that there was little to no genetic correlation between purebred and crossbred sow longevity for this population. While longevity is heritable at both the nucleus and commercial levels, results from this study indicate that little improvement would be made in crossbred longevity if selection relies solely on purebred information. One way to select for sow longevity would be to estimate purebred genomic breeding values using records from a related crossbred population. A spreadsheet for estimating the total costs associated with incorporating genome-enabled selection into a swine breeding program was developed as the final part of this dissertation. This tool will aid producers in estimating the economic viability of incorporating genome-enabled selection into their specific breeding program. Based on the results from these projects, it is recommended that a commercial test herd be implemented as part of a selection program to improve longevity or sow productive lifetime. If a genetic company can succeed in improving sow longevity through an effective breeding program, production efficiency and profitability can be improved for commercial swine operations...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{reported}} associations between lameness and body condition score (BCS) in dairy cattle, however the impact {{of change in the}} dynamics of BCS on both lameness occurrence and recovery is currently unknown. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate in a longitudinal study the effect of change in BCS on the transitions from the non-lame to lame, and lame to non-lame states. A total of 731 cows with 6889 observations from 4 UK herds were included in the study. Mobility score (MS) and body condition score (BCS) were recorded every 13 - 15 days from July 2010 until December 2011. A multilevel multistate discrete time event history model was built to investigate the transition of lameness over time. There were 1042 non-lame episodes and 593 lame episodes of which approximately 50 % (519 / 1042) of the non-lame episodes transitioned to the lame state and 81 % (483 / 593) of the lame episodes ended with a transition to the non-lame state. Cows with a lower BCS at calving (BCS Group 1 (1. 00 - 1. 75) and Group 2 (2. 00 - 2. 25)) had a higher probability of transition from non-lame to lame and a lower probability of transition from lame to non-lame compared to cows with BCS 2. 50 - 2. 75 i. e. they were more likely <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>lame</b> and if lame, they were less likely to recover. Similarly, cows who suffered a greater decrease in BCS (compared to their BCS at calving) had a higher probability of becoming lame and a lower probability of recovering in the next 15 days. An increase in BCS from calving was associated with the converse effect i. e. a lower probability of cows moving from the non-lame to the lame state and higher probability of transition from lame to non-lame. Days of lactation, months of calving and parity was associated with both lame and non-lame transitions and there was evidence of heterogeneity among cows in lameness occurrence and recovery. This study suggests loss of BCS and increase of BCS could influence the risk of becoming lame and the chance of recovery from lameness. Regular monitoring and maintenance of BCS on farms could be a key tool for reducing lameness. Further work is urgently needed in this area to allow a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms behind these relationships...|$|E
