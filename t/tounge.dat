40|$|Language {{is crucial}} {{when it comes}} to {{developing}} knowledge. Agreat deal of research around the world shows that the mother <b>tounge</b> is of significant importance to students acquiring a second language. However, there is a difference of opinion as to how the taeching ouught to be carried out. In many places, innspections have relvealed major inadequacies in the welcoming of the students. Newcomers do not always receive the education they are entitled to. In this essay, I have investigated how a number of teachers work with students with other mother <b>tounge</b> than Swedish. I aim to find out how the interviewed teachers think think {{about the importance of the}} mother <b>tounge</b> in the language development in second-language learners. Is it possible to work together with the teachers of the mother <b>tounge</b> and, if so, how is this cooperation organised? Furthermore, I would like to study how teachers plan their pedagogical work in the classroom and how the students progress is made visible. I would like to connect the answers with previous research. The result of my study shows that the teachers wish for an increased cooperation with teachers of the mother <b>tounge</b> an despite the teachers intentions to provide the second-learners with a good education, there are still areas that need to be developed...|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} nature of Einstein’s Theory of Relativity which is {{deeply rooted in the}} German {{language}} and values. Similarly, the earlier critics of the theory, Whitehead and Iqbal are shown to be deeply rooted by their respective mother <b>tounges</b> and value systems: the English language and Anglo-Christian values, and the Urdu language and the Indo-Islamic values. Then we prove that the concept of time base on Malay etimology can be used to constructively criticize the Relativity Theory, hence to establish a new potential source of improvement of the Western Relativity Theory. With this finding, it is hoped that the theory would not only become more acceptable by the Malays, but can also hopefully become an alternative to the current Relativity Theor...|$|R
40|$|Auditory word {{recognition}} {{is often described}} as a linear process of lexical access. Commonly, however, the perceptual evidence is ambiguous (mishearings, slip of the <b>tounges,</b> etc.), and requires additional compensatory and re-evaluatory processing. We used a lexical decision task in an electroencephalography (EEG) study and manipulated lexico-semantic access by parametrically varying the factor “wordness”: Stimuli were three-syllabic German words (“real”), pseudowords derived by only exchanging the core vowel in the second syllable (“recoverable” pseudowords), and pseudowords derived by scrambling entire syllables (“opaque” pseudowords). While listeners performed the lexical decision very accurately (accuracy for all conditions > 95 %), time-locked potentials (ERPs) at the third syllable revealed successive peak delay and amplitude height of the following negative deflection (N 400) dependent on wordness; the N 400 response to opaque pseudowords was strongest and peaked latest. At and after stimulus offset, alpha power (9 [...] 13 Hz) was suppressed as a monotonic function of wordness (real < recoverable < opaque) with stronger suppression indicating less effort in lexico-semantic access. Simultaneously, however, theta power (3 [...] 5 Hz) was most enhanced for recoverable pseudowords; they closely resemble a word, but also provide contradicting perceptual evidence (the altered vowel). This led to response conflict and increase in cognitive control. Accordingly, source localisation indicated that theta power changes emerged from the dorsal Anterior Cingulum (dACC). The results show that auditory word comprehension requires a cascade of evoked (N 400) and induced (alpha, theta) brain processes, which reflect success, effort, and conflict in lexical access...|$|R

40|$|The sound {{generation}} {{mechanism of}} reed organ pipes {{is a complex}} physical phenomenon. The reed pipe consists of three main parts: the boot, the block with the shallot and the <b>tounge</b> and the resonator. When the pipe is played air ows through the bore and the <b>tounge</b> is forced into motion by the pressure forces acting on it. Under playing conditions the motion becomes periodic {{by means of an}} aerodynamic-acoustic feedback loop. The pitch of the pipe is determined by the coupling of two oscillating systems, the vibrating reed and the acoustic resonator-shallot system. The strength of the coupling varies in a wide range for different pipe ranks. Trumpet pipes are characterized by strong interaction between the resonator and the reed, whereas in case of stops such as the Vox Humana the coupling is weak typically. In both cases, the resonator has a great effect on the timbre of the pipe. In case of weak coupling the resonator acts as a filter, which can reinforce or suppress certain harmonic partials in the pipe sound. Discussions with organ builder partners in the framework of a European project have shown that there are no common rules for the design of reed pipe resonators. Also measurements prove that design rules of thumb applied currently in practice do not fully exploit the capabilities of the resonator. Thus, the aim of our research is to achieve an optimal scaling of reed pipe resonators, which can lead to cost and effort reduction in practice. In this contribution a methodology is presented, which combines a one-dimensional analytic model with three-dimensional finite element simulation in order to predict the acoustic behavior of reed pipe resonators. The proposed method is validated by means of comparisons with measurements and it is shown that the technique is capable of calculating the eigenfrequencies of the resonator accurately...|$|E

40|$|Rehabilitation {{of major}} resections {{of the tongue}} has always posed a serious problem. This paper {{presents}} the feasibility and rationale of rehabilitating partial glossectomies {{by the use of}} the pectoralis major myocutaneous fl ap and the fabrication of a “new tongue ” by the use of this fl ap. The criteria for these techniques in benign and malignant tumors of the tongue are outlined. The segmental innervation of the pectoralis major muscle from a variety of three to fi ve nerve branches permits the development of a skin-muscle fl ap that may be transposed with its nerve supply intact or totally denervated, depending upon the status of the hypoglossal nerves and tongue in the operative fi eld. This presents the possibility of transposing a skin-muscle fl ap into a glossal wound with a completely intact nerve supply where the new fl ap is under constant instruction in its new physiologic environ-ment. It also presents the possibility of neurotization of the denervated section of the muscle fl ap by axones from the intact segment of tongue. A third possibility is the fabrication of a “new tongue ” by the transfer of the hypo glossal nerves into the denervated segment of the peripheral aspect of the myocutaneous fl ap. This variety and combi-nation of rehabilitative techniques introduces a new phase into the rehabilitation of the tongue The <b>tounge</b> is the most essential organ in the oral cavity. It is re-sponsible for moving the blous for food or liquid through the oral cavity into the mesopharynx. It assists in molding and beautify-ing the human voice. It is essentially a mass of highly specialized muscle, covered with epithelium, nourished by a rich blood su-plly through the lingual arteries, and contains the sensibilities of taste and contact. Although the <b>tounge</b> has an astounding capaci-ty for adaption after injury or resection, there are well-recognized circumstances that may cause severe crippling. Its physiologic essentiality is matched by a strong emotional interest {{on the part of the}} surgeon in preserving its integrity.

40|$|International audienceThe Unruly Tongue in Early Modern England is a {{scholarly}} edition of three early modern treatises on the unruly tongue: Jean de Marconville, A Treatise of the Good and Evell <b>Tounge</b> (ca. 1592), William Perkins, A Direction for the Government of the Tongue according to Gods worde (1595), and George Webbe, The Araignement of an unruly Tongue (1619). “The tongue can no man tame” says the Bible (James 3 : 8), and yet these texts try {{to tame the}} tongues of men and tell them how they should rule this little but essential organ and avoid swearing, blaspheming, cursing, lying, flattering, railing, slandering, quarrelling, babbling, jesting, or mocking.

I have reached the conclusion in my examination that it is important to raise the impor-tance of language comprehension within math-education. It is crucial that teachers need to create different kinds of working patterns and methods that are adapted accordingly to the learning-ability of the pupils. Thus, teachers also need to show great consideration to the cul-tural backgrounds, expectations, attitudes and feelings of their pupils...|$|E

40|$|The {{proprioceptive}} innervation of the <b>tounge</b> {{has been}} investigated in the Cynamolgus monkey by silver impregnation methods following unilateral section of lingual, hypoglossal, and cervical nerves. Muscle spindles were constantly present in the intrinsic and extrinsic muscles. They varied greatly in number, averaged half the length of lumbrical spindles, and showed an unusual arrangement of chain fibre nuclei. Other, inconstant proprioceptors included tendon endings, Ruffini endings, Pacinian corpuscles, paciniform and lamellated endings. Topologically, the endings other than spindles were extra-muscular, so that the overall pattern of proprioceptive innervation resembled that of skeletal muscle in general. Lingual nerve section was without apparent effect on the proprioceptors. Section of the hypoglossal nerve at its point of entry into the tongue caused severe depletiion of ipsilateral proprioceptors and of fusimotor nerves. In the anterior tongue there was evidence of transmedian overlap by efferent and afferent axons contained in the hypoglossal nerve. Hypoglossal section at the skull base caused degeneration of fusimotor nerves but not of proprioceptors. Section of (a), the connexion of C 2 -C 3 ventral rami with the hypoglossal, together with section of (b), the ramus descendens hypoglossi, coused depletion of lingual proprioceptors; again there was evidence of transmedian overlap. Procedures (a) or (b) alone had a lesser effect.

The third granuloma comprised of a suppurative small necrotizing ulceration of the mucosa containing vegetable cells and a granuloma in the underlaying submucosa containing filamentous bacteria typical for necrobacillosis. Outbreaks of necrobacillosis, affecting the mouth and digestive organs, in connection with supplementary feeding, appears to be of multifactorial genesis.

40|$|Introduction: Siwak (Salvadora persica), an oral {{cleansing}} tool {{which came}} from ancient Arab has Islamic cultural values. Many researches concluded that siwak contains antibacterial agent which has function to kill bacteria causing oral malodor (halitosis). Objective: The {{purpose of this study}} was to analyze halitosis parameters change which consisted of Volatile Sulfur Compounds (VSC), Bleeding on Probing (BOP) and tongue coating after using siwak at 11 - 13 year old students in Tapak Sunan Boarding School. Materials and methods: This study used experimental research method and 25 students in the age group of 11 - 13 year old became subjects of this study. Halitosis parameters measurements were taken before and after using 10 days siwak usage and through dental health education.  OralChroma and organoleptic score were used to measure the VSC. Probing on six sites of gingival sulculs of each tooth was used to measured BOP. Classification of <b>tounge</b> coating was performed by observing the presence of white coating on the tongue surface. Statistical analysis was performed using Paired-t Test with p< 0. 05 as the level of significance. Results: Approximately 75 % reduction of total VSC concentration was observed after siwak usage. Number of subjects with score 1 in organoleptic assessment for halitosis was also increased by 36 %. Followed by reduction of BOP and tongue coating score by 57. 7 % and 26 % respectively. Statistical analysis of those parameters showed significant differences before and after siwak usage. Conclusion: Siwak usage sucessfully decreased all halitosis parameters of the 11 - 13 years old students in Tapak Sunan Boarding School. DOI: 10. 14693 /jdi. v 17 i 2. 45 </p...|$|E

In reading L 2, Indonesian students get difficulties because foreign languge is different with their mother <b>tounge.</b> Therefore, reading strategies are needed. This study is aimed at finding out the kinds of reading strategies, the most frequently used reading strategy, and the significant difference of reading strategy between science and social students of SMA Brawijaya Smart School Universitas Brawijaya Malang. This study used descriptive quantitative approach dealing with survey research. The data of the study were collected by using questionnaire named Survey of Reading Strategies (SORS) designed by Mokhtari and Sheorey (2002). The sample of this study are the students of XI IPA 1 and XI IPS 2. The results revealed that the use of overall reading strategies for science fell into high level. It means that science students usually used reading strategiesduring reading process, it might be very important strategies for science students. While, the use of overall reading strategies for social fell into medium, means that they sometimes used reading strategies during reading process. Social students consider that reading strategies are important to do during reading process. Specifically, both science and social favored problem solving strategies as the most USAge, followed by support reading strategies and global reading strategies. In addition, there is significant difference of reading strategies between science and social students. Regarding the importance of reading strategy, the students have to applyreading strategies in reading process, so they will get a lot of knowledge fromreading and they can compete in International school.
