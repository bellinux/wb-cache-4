50|$|As with {{motion picture}} cameras, the {{intermittent}} {{motion of the}} gate requires that there be loops {{above and below the}} gate in order to serve as a buffer between the constant speed enforced by the sprockets above and below the gate and the intermittent motion enforced at the gate. Some projectors also have a sensitive <b>trip</b> <b>pin</b> above the gate to guard against the upper loop becoming too big. If the loop hits the pin, it will close the dousers and stop the motor to prevent an excessively large loop from jamming the projector.|$|E
5000|$|In 1559, Taqi al-Din {{invented a}} six-cylinder 'Monobloc' pump. It was a hydropowered water-raising machine {{incorporating}} valves, suction and delivery pipes, piston rods with lead weights, <b>trip</b> levers with <b>pin</b> joints, and cams on the axle of a water-driven scoop-wheel. His 'Monobloc' pump could also create a partial vacuum, which was formed [...] "as the lead weight moves upwards, it pulls the piston with it, creating vacuum which sucks the water through a non return clack valve into the piston cylinder." ...|$|R
5000|$|The police find Stan's body; {{to their}} amazement, {{he is still}} alive. Some time later, Ursula and Stan return {{to the house to}} visit Pin. Ursula tells him that she's going on a <b>trip</b> with Stan. <b>Pin</b> {{inquires}} as to whether she's heard from Leon. Ursula replies [...] "No." [...] Pin says that he misses him a great deal. Ursula agrees, it is revealed that she is talking to Leon, who has taken Pin's persona. When the dummy was destroyed, Leon had a psychotic break, which left only the Pin side of his personality to completely take over which also means that Leon has also become a real, life-size version of Pin.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the theoretical methodology, conceptual demonstration, and validation of a fully automated computer {{program for the}} inverse design and optimization of internal convectively cooled three-dimensional axial gas turbine blades. A parametric computer model of the three-dimensional internal cooling network was developed, including the automatic generation of computational grids. A boundary element computer program was written to solve the steady-state non-linear heat conduction equation inside the internally cooled and thermal barrier-coated turbine blade. A finite element algorithm was written to model an arbitrary network of internal coolant passages for the calculation of the internal heat transfer coefficients, pressure losses, local flow rates, the effects of centrifugal pumping, heating of the coolant fluid, and forced convection from the thermal model of the solid to the coolant fluid. The heat conduction and internal flow analyses were iteratively coupled {{to account for the}} heat balance between the blade and the coolant fluid. The computer-automated design and optimization system was demonstrated on the second highpressure turbine blade row of the Pratt & Whitney F 100 engine. The internal cooling configuration and local heat transfer enhancements (boundary layer <b>trip</b> strips and <b>pin</b> fins) inside the three-dimensional blade were optimized for maximum cooling effectiveness and durability against corrosion and thermomechanical fatigu...|$|R
