In groups, students discuss the answers to carefully crafted questions that lead them to consider the general ideas in question and to construct their own understanding of important course concepts.

Good work is rewarded with commendations, award of certificates of merit and achievement, early promotion to a higher grade, positive reports from teachers to parents, and selection for overseas visits. For behaviour there is a merit and demerit point system. Poor conduct may result in a student being placed on report, with daily feedback to parents and the Principal; denial of privileges such as free time during break periods; and [...] "time out" [...] periods. Demerit points require attendance at a weekly [...] "formal reflection" [...] session. Male students who persistently misbehave receive corporal punishment {{in the form of a}} caning. Students who accumulate 10 or more demerit points, and make no effort to improve, face strokes of the cane (boys) or suspension (girls).

40|$|Abstract :In {{this paper}} we promote the {{integration}} of form-focused grammar teaching with a communicative approach to language learnÂ­ing. After discussion of several principles of L 2 acquisition and their pedagogic implications, we recommend a four-stage lesson plan which helps the teacher {{to focus on a}} communicative function while presenting a specific grammatical structure. In the proposed lesson structure, teachers are encouraged <b>to</b> <b>guide</b> <b>student.</b> Exploration, disÂ­covery, and application of grammatical information during specific lesson stages. This type of lesson should pave the way for students to do more than master practice worksheets. One of the greatest benÂ­efits of this type of lesson is that it gives teachers the confidence to integrate a grammatical focus into their language lessons without violating the essence of communicative approach...|$|E

The context for our discussion is classroom-based assessment with judgment of student learning by teachers, and the use of criteria and standards <b>to</b> <b>guide</b> <b>student</b> performance and self-improvement. We demonstrate that the underlying rationale for this discussion is located at the convergence of five theoretical or paradigmatic approaches in assessment and learning. As an exemplar we provide the discourse of a student with a history of learning difficulties as he engages with and constructs meaning within the criteria and standards of a performance assessment task, in order to examine his own performance and how to improve...|$|E

40|$|Abstract- Although team-based {{projects}} {{have become a}} popular practice in colleges with focus on helping students learn subjects collaboratively and effectively, the current education paradigm mainly adopts ad hoc collaboration practices. There lacks a quantitative methodology for enabling appropriate and scientific approaches to guide the educational community in teaching and transforming educational practices to support the development, implementation, and improvement of state-of-the-art collaborative-learning practices on campuses. This paper presents a new computational model and framework to quantitatively explore the collaboration-based behavioral dynamics of student teams {{and its impact on}} team performance. More specifically, a suite of mathematical models in the form of computations, structural equation modeling, and principal component analysis are created to describe and analyze a variety of learning circumstances, aimed at generating rules of thumb <b>to</b> <b>guide</b> <b>student</b> teams to retune collaborative practices in a proactive and realtime manner for improved performance...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{architectural}} concept for developing agent-based simulations called Simulation Plugin Interface (SPI); furthermore, a simulation framework called Easy Agent Simulation (EAS) {{based on the}} proposed architecture is presented. The SPI introduces an intermediate layer between the simulation engine and the simulation model.

This includes visualization, probes, statistics calculations, logging, scheduling, API to other programming languages, etc. The architecture is particularly suitable <b>to</b> <b>guide</b> <b>student</b> programmers with low experience to well-structured and reusable simulation components. The SPI architecture is not bound to the EAS Framework, but can be implemented as an extension to most state-of-the-art simulation frameworks. In a comparative study, the EAS framework is compared to the agent simulation frameworks NetLogo and MASON, using the well-known “Stupid Model ” as a test scenario. ...|$|E
