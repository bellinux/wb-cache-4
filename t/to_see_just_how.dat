25|$|Confronted {{with the}} {{challenge}} of showing 3-dimensional gameplay on 2-dimensional advertisements, the company partnered with Blockbuster and NBC in a coordinated effort. A $5 million campaign promoted NBC's fall lineup alongside the Virtual Boy. American viewers were encouraged via television advertisements on NBC to rent the console for US$10 at a local Blockbuster. This made it affordable for a large number of gamers to try the system, and produced 750,000 rentals. Upon returning the unit, renters received a coupon for $10 off the purchase of a Virtual Boy from any store. 3,000 Blockbuster locations were included in the promotion, which consisted of a sweepstakes with prizes including trips to see the taping of NBC shows. The popular rental system proved harmful to the Virtual Boy's long-term success, allowing gamers <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> un-immersive the console was. By mid-1996, Blockbuster was selling its Virtual Boy units at $50 each. Taken as a whole, the marketing campaign was commonly thought of as a failure.|$|E

VanDerWerff criticized Darren McGavin's appearance in the episode, calling it a [...] "glorified cameo", and noted that his character function as the [...] "kind of old man who stands on his porch and yells about the good old days to the neighborhood kids." [...] He did however, call the shot of the [...] "writhing tentacle in the overhead lamp" [...] the [...] "one good thing" [...] in the episode. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode one-and-a-half stars out of five, writing that the episode's [...] "laughs aren't clever, and the scares are silly".|$|E

40|$|Mammalian {{development}} involves significant {{interactions between}} offspring and mother. But is this interaction a carefully coordinated effort by two {{individuals with a}} common goal [...] offspring survival? Or is it an evolutionary battleground (a central idea {{in our understanding of}} reproduction). The conflict between parents and offspring extends to an offspring's genes, where paternally inherited genes favor demanding more from the mother, while maternally inherited genes favor restraint. This "intragenomic conflict" (among genes within a genome) is the dominant evolutionary explanation for "genomic imprinting. " But a new study in PLOS Biology provides support for a different perspective: that imprinting might facilitate coordination between mother and offspring. According to this "coadaptation theory," paternally inherited genes might be inactivated because maternally inherited genes are adapted to function harmoniously with the mother. As discussed in this article, the growth effects associated with the imprinted gene Grb 10 are consistent with this idea, but it remains <b>to</b> be <b>seen</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> general the pattern is...|$|R

40|$|The Work Choices {{legislation}} {{represents a}} concerted attempt to tilt {{the balance of}} labour regulation in favour of employers. It does this {{by allowing them to}} offer agreements that reduce or eliminate award or statutory entitlements, by making it harder for both workers and unions to contest management decisions, and by sidelining the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. It also seeks to 'move towards' a national system of regulation by providing that the majority of employers will be exclusively subject to federal rather than State regulation, at least for some purposes. Yet for all the radical nature of many of the changes, this is not the 'big bang' it might have been. Many features of the old arbitration system have been retained and there are genuine compromises at the heart of some of the changes. It also remains <b>to</b> be <b>seen</b> <b>just</b> <b>how</b> quickly employers will move to exploit the opportunities the new legislation offers, given its complexity, opposition from unions, and indeed the natural pragmatism or conservatism of many managers — and whether this will prompt further intervention by a government that appears uncomfortable with leaving it to employers to make their own choices.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to design, {{implement}} and analyse a hybrid genetic algorithm for solving the MAX- 3 SAT problem. The problem is a well known NP-complete decision problem. Solving this type of problems is highly motivated by its practical use in industry. The main field of 3 SAT solver application ranges from integrated circuit delay optimization <b>to</b> FPGA routing. <b>See</b> section 1. 9 for details on practical applications of the MAX- 3 SAT solver. The idea behind this hybrid genetic algorithm, is <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>just</b> when and <b>how</b> much of local search can still prove beneficial to the overall solution quality. In the results section 4. 4, we have shown that this algorithm performs best when the local search is applied periodically and with our best run results (presented in section 4. 6) we {{came very close to}} a similar implementation described in [14]. Our best average run time on the biggest test instances was trailing behind aforementioned article by about 30 percent. The reason, why our average running time is fairly close to the aforementioned imple- mentation, lies in exploiting parallelism. We used a simple parallelization technique of local searching, which is described in section 4. 2. Moreover, our solution quality - that is the number of unsatisfied clauses, was pretty much as good as the one reported in [14]. Ours was worse by only 0, 6 percent. It is {{important to point out that}} we used exactly the same test instances as used in [14]. ...|$|R

6000|$|He had abstained {{for several}} reasons from saying {{some of these things}} to Bellegarde.

Madame Dandelard was a little Italian lady who had married a Frenchman who proved to be a rake and a brute and the torment of her life.

She was always looking for an apartment, and visiting, inquiringly, those of other people. She was very pretty, very childlike, and she made very extraordinary remarks.
