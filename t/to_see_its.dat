Tourism activity is only allowed in selected areas of Corbett Tiger Reserve so that people get an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>its</b> splendid landscape and the diverse wildlife. In recent years {{the number of people}} coming here has increased dramatically. Presently, every season more than 70,000 visitors come to the park.|$|E
5|$|Following the Egyptian mania that {{gripped the}} country after the {{discovery}} of King Tut's tomb in 1922, Harvey's Pyramid project sparked {{a lot of interest}} and was widely reported throughout the U.S. Tens of thousands of people came to Monte Ne during the 1920s <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>its</b> progress. Harvey continued to raise funds from events held at the amphitheater, such as conventions.|$|E
5|$|It {{was decided}} by the family that a new and far grander house would be built, using the money that the Wrights had earned through their inventions and business. Called affectionately Hawthorn Hill, {{building}} had begun in the Dayton suburb of Oakwood, Ohio, while Wilbur was in Europe. Katharine and Orville oversaw the project in his absence. Wilbur's one known expression upon {{the design of the}} house was that he have a room and bathroom of his own. The brothers hired Schenck and Williams, an architectural firm, to design the house, along with input from both Wilbur and Orville. Wilbur did not live <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>its</b> completion in 1914.|$|E

5|$|The Theatre Royal, {{which was}} {{established}} in 1744, produces an annual pantomime which attracts loyal audiences {{from around the country}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>its</b> veteran star, Berwick Kaler. The Grand Opera House and Joseph Rowntree Theatre also offer a variety of productions. The city is home to the Riding Lights Theatre Company, which as well as operating a busy national touring department, also operates a busy youth theatre and educational departments. York is also home to a number of amateur dramatic groups. The Department of Theatre, Film and Television and Student Societies of the University of York put on public drama performances.|$|E
5|$|To this dreadful monster the effluvium of {{the weasel}} is fatal, {{a thing that}} has been tried with success, for kings have often desired <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>its</b> body when killed; so true is it that it has pleased Nature {{that there should be}} nothing without its antidote. The animal is thrown into the hole of the basilisk, which is easily known from the soil around it being infected. The weasel destroys the basilisk by its odour, but dies itself in this {{struggle}} of nature against its own self.|$|E
5|$|Bradley Meek, {{writing for}} THEM Anime, gave the series 3/5 stars. He praised {{the way the}} series {{maintained}} its horror-based atmosphere in between the action sequences. He greatly enjoyed the horror and action aspects, but felt that the character-driven segments in early episodes threatened to drag down the whole experience due to mundane content and poor characters. Talking about the anime's second half, {{he said that it}} drastically altered the pace and content to the point that viewers might be put off with its conscious bending of the rules of handling characters and viewers alike—Meek was ultimately angry at the series' brutal ending, but it also left him eager <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>its</b> movie conclusion.|$|E

5|$|In July 1997, violent clashes {{occurred}} between factional forces separately allied to FUNCINPEC and the CPP, leading to Ranariddh's ouster {{from his position}} as First Prime Minister. Ranariddh subsequently returned from exile in March 1998, and led the party to the 1998 general elections, which was won by CPP with FUNCINPEC as the first runner-up. Subsequently, FUNCINPEC joined CPP again, this time as a junior partner in a coalition government. Ranariddh was appointed as the President of the National Assembly, a post which he held until 2006 when he was ousted from FUNCINPEC by the party's former secretary-general Nhek Bun Chhay. At the same time, FUNCINPEC continued <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>its</b> share of voters and seats in the national assembly drop over the general elections of 2003, 2008 and 2013, with the party failing to win a single seat in the National Assembly at the 2013 general elections. In January 2015, Ranariddh returned to FUNCINPEC, and was re-appointed as the party's president.|$|E
5|$|From {{the work}} of Heaviside (1887) it had become clear that the {{performance}} of telegraph lines, and most especially telephone lines, could be improved {{by the addition of}} inductance to the line. George Campbell at AT implemented this idea (1899) by inserting loading coils at intervals along the line. Campbell found that as well as the desired improvements to the line's characteristics in the passband there was also a definite frequency beyond which signals could not be passed without great attenuation. This was a result of the loading coils and the line capacitance forming a low-pass filter, an effect that is only apparent on lines incorporating lumped components such as the loading coils. This naturally led Campbell (1910) to produce a filter with ladder topology, a glance at the circuit diagram of this filter is enough <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>its</b> relationship to a loaded transmission line. The cut-off phenomenon is an undesirable side-effect as far as loaded lines are concerned but for telephone FDM filters it is precisely what is required. For this application, Campbell produced band-pass filters to the same ladder topology by replacing the inductors and capacitors with resonators and anti-resonators respectively. Both the loaded line and FDM were of great benefit economically to AT and this led to fast development of filtering from this point onwards.|$|E

The house was sold for building materials in 1739, and much of its fabric survives, having {{been used in the}} contemporary construction of West Country buildings.|$|E
25|$|Whiskers also aid in hunting.

A cat whose whiskers have been damaged may bite the wrong part of its prey, indicating that they provide cats with detailed information about the shape and activity of its prey.|$|E

25|$|After Huxley {{the most}} {{important}} influence on his thought was August Weismann, the German zoologist who rejected Lamarckism, and wholeheartedly advocated natural selection as the key force in evolution {{at a time when}} other biologists had doubts.

Lankester {{was one of the first}} <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>its</b> importance: his full acceptance of selection came after reading Weismann's essays, some of which he translated into English.|$|E
