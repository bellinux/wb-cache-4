2500|$|In 2008, Platinum MC Hammer was {{released}} by EMI Records. The compilation consists of 12 tracks from Hammer's previous albums, with a similar playlist as former [...] "greatest hits" [...] records (with the exception of including a remix of [...] "Hammer Hammer, <b>They</b> <b>Put</b> <b>Me</b> <b>In</b> A Mix" [...] which includes rap lyrics that [...] "They Put Me In A Mix" [...] originally did not). An import {{was released}} by Capitol Records.|$|E
2500|$|During {{his early}} career (80s and early 90s), Hammer would tour, perform and record with his hype man 2 Bigg MC or Too Big (releasing {{a song in}} which he claimed [...] "He's the King of the Hype"). This duo {{introduced}} the [...] "shiny suit" [...] (and popularized Hammer pants) to mainstream America, as seen in videos such as [...] "(Hammer Hammer) <b>They</b> <b>Put</b> <b>Me</b> <b>In</b> A Mix", in which Hammer also claimed Too Big was the [...] "King of Hype", who was in an unspoken competition with Flavor Flav (hype man for Public Enemy) {{during the height of}} their careers.|$|E

2500|$|Lane {{was born}} in Austin, Texas, in April 1928. [...] When he was three months old, he was {{abandoned}} by his birth parents, a prostitute and pimp. He was found, covered in newspapers, in a dumpster. Lane later recalled, [...] "My father was called Texas Slim. I never saw him - I don't know if he's the one that told my mother to throw me away. A pimp told my mother I had to go. <b>They</b> <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> a trash can and took off. Some people heard me crying. They {{thought it was a}} cat." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dany Roth of blastr.com was {{impressed}} by the show's costume designs, stating that they are [...] "possibly the best on TV right now. Each costume {{tells the story of the}} world, of the people, of the specific character." [...] He said that, like Mad Max, The 100 [...] "understands that the Grounders are repurposing tools and clothing from a time long dead. But the costumes are far from uniform. The people who lived on the ark, the people who live in the forest, the people who live in a frozen tundra, they all dress differently.", and although [...] "there's fashion here that makes the clothes exciting", it is the clothes that tell the story. [...] "I've said this many times before and I'll say it again here," [...] he added, [...] "a good costume makes a good actor a great one. Costumes make a show's world real." [...] Maureen Ryan of Variety, formerly of The Huffington Post, stated that the [...] "most enduring image of Lexa is one of her sitting on a throne made of intertwined branches, her enigmatic eyes looking out from a face half-covered in elaborate war paint." [...] Debnam-Carey said, [...] "I'm lucky <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> such a badass costume and makeup. It's funny, we did a whole day of tests with that makeup. We were like, 'Should we do this? Should we do tears? Should we do the bindi?'" [...] She collaborated with Rothenberg on the makeup and wardrobe for her character, and both collaborated with viewers on fan versions of the designs.|$|E
6000|$|... "In course, Father John; I {{was only}} {{on my way}} to Carrick when I called here. In truth, I wanted a kind word from you before <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> that horrid place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "These private {{committees}} in a merry meeting," [...] said Wildrake, [...] "are a solecism <b>in</b> breeding. <b>They</b> always <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> {{mind of the}} cursed committees at Westminster.--But shall we roost before we rouse the night-owl with a catch?" ...|$|R
60|$|If {{the fellow}} saw me there our chances of escape might quickly go glimmering, for I knew that <b>they</b> would <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> irons if <b>they</b> had the {{slightest}} {{conception of the}} wonderful agility which my earthly muscles gave me upon Mars.|$|R

6000|$|... "No, I thank you," [...] {{said the}} second mate again. [...] "Take him yourself--he's yours by good rights--I don't want him." [...] And so <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> the chief mate's division, {{that is the}} {{larboard}} watch.|$|E
6000|$|... "Psha;--promised! If <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> a witness-box {{of course}} I must tell. When {{you come to}} this kind of work, {{promises}} don't go for much. I don't know that they ever do. What is a broken promise?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "On the whole, I do {{not like}} it," [...] she observes, laying the glossy fabric upon the counter. [...] "But, Adam, it is very strange. What can these things mean? Surely I ought to know; yet <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> a perfect maze." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{believe that}} is true, and it proves what a free country this is--does it not? Mr. Wilson's {{democracy}} is the kind that won't allow people to express their opinions, unless they agree with him. If I say I will stand by the American constitution, <b>they</b> will <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> jail." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Few {{would believe}} our story; {{and those that}} did would wonder at me,--not love me as you do. <b>They</b> would <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> a cage, and make a show of me; and I should be so miserable I should die. So don't tell who I am, will you?" [...] said Lorelei earnestly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was with}} the gang {{quarrying}} stones, and a mass of rock fell upon it. I {{have been in the}} infirmary for weeks, and I own that the Christian dogs treated me well. A slave has his value, you see. I am nearly cured now, but I shall never walk well again. I expect <b>they</b> will <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> one of their accursed galleys." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have seen}} you before," [...] he said. [...] "I saw {{you in the}} arena at the Mahars' city of Phutra when the thipdars dragged the tarag from you and your mate. I never {{understood}} that. Afterward <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> the arena with two warriors from Gombul." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I {{am ready}} to go {{anywhere}} and to tell every one when you like," [...] Ruth said. [...] "Do not look so pitiful, Mary. I am sure I shall be much happier, whatever happens, even if <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> prison, now that I have {{made up my mind}} to do what is right." ...|$|E
60|$|The gallery {{contains}} {{a vast number}} of Poussin's pictures; <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> mind of the color of objects in dreams,--a strange, hazy, lurid hue. How noble are some of his landscapes! What a depth of solemn shadow is in yonder wood, near which, by the side of a black water, halts Diogenes. The air is thunder-laden, and breathes heavily. You hear ominous whispers in the vast forest gloom.|$|E
60|$|The {{first piece}} of service <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>me</b> upon <b>in</b> this new command was as {{difficult}} as any they could think of, {{and that was to}} manage the prisoners; which, however, I cheerfully undertook, as you shall hear presently. But the immediate consultation was yet of more consequence; and that was, first, which way we should go; and secondly, how to furnish ourselves for the voyage with provisions.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have just}} {{returned}} from Paris; the first time I have been out; and, {{had it not been}} for you,' she added, 'I should not have been here to-night. I think <b>they</b> would have <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> prison.' ...|$|R
500|$|By {{this time}} Conn and Stafford {{were not on}} {{speaking}} terms and it fell to Tom Smythe, Stafford's son, to mediate between the two. Stafford built a new office suite at the Gardens for Conn, and the feud was over. After Stafford was charged in 1971 with fraud and became ill with a stomach ulcer, Conn was with him in hospital when he died. According to Conn, Stafford's last words to him were [...] "see dad, I told you <b>they</b> wouldn't <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> jail." ...|$|R
60|$|Six men-at-arms {{he chose}} {{out to do}} his bidding; and while the gates were cleared of the throng, and {{trumpets}} were sounding, and church bells were rung backwards, for an alarm, I was dragged, with many a kick and blow, over the drawbridge, up the stairs of the tower, and so was thrown into a strong room beneath the battlements. There <b>they</b> <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> bonds, gave me of their courtesy a jug of water and a loaf of black bread by me, and then, taking my dagger, my sword, and all that was in my pouch, they left me with curses.|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> {{another part}} of the barn and laid me on a stuffy sort of pallet, which was not made of cloth of gold, or Persian shawls, but was merely the unpretending sort of thing I have seen in the negro {{quarters}} of Arkansas. There was nothing whatever in this dim marble prison but five more of these biers. It was a very solemn place. I expected that the spiced odors of Araby were going to steal over my senses now, but they did not. A copper-colored skeleton, with a rag around him, brought me a glass decanter of water, with a lighted tobacco pipe in the top of it, and a pliant stem a yard long, with a brass mouth-piece to it.|$|E
6000|$|After my sentence, I came {{to spend}} the rest of my [...] "natural life" [...] in the prison of San Quentin. I proved incorrigible. An incorrigible is a terrible human being--at least such is the {{connotation}} of [...] "incorrigible" [...] in prison psychology. I became an incorrigible because I abhorred waste motion. The prison, like all prisons, was a scandal and an affront of waste motion. <b>They</b> <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> the jute-mill. The criminality of wastefulness irritated me. Why should it not? Elimination of waste motion was my speciality. Before the invention of steam or steam-driven looms three thousand years before, I had rotted in prison in old Babylon; and, trust me, I speak the truth when I say that in that ancient day we prisoners wove more efficiently on hand-looms than did the prisoners in the steam-powered loom-rooms of San Quentin.|$|E
6000|$|... "Listen," [...] he said. [...] "These {{people have}} come to <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> Metzger's place. There would be no {{difficulty}} about that. Already I have received a message from the House of Laws. Bah! I have no stomach to sit in council with tradesmen and citizens, to have my will questioned, to rule only by a casting vote. These modern forms of government are vile. They would make me President of their Republic--I, a Reist of Theos, whose forefathers ruled the land with sword and fire. <b>They</b> would <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> the place of Metzger, the merchant--Metzger, who would have sold his country to the Russians. I say no!" ...|$|R
60|$|Twice {{they had}} me before the full Board of Directors. I was {{alternately}} bullied and cajoled. Their attitude resolved itself into two propositions. If I delivered up the dynamite, they {{would give me a}} nominal punishment of thirty days in the dungeon and then make <b>me</b> a trusty <b>in</b> the prison library. If I persisted in my stubbornness and did not yield up the dynamite, then <b>they</b> would <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> solitary {{for the rest of my}} sentence. In my case, being a life prisoner, this was tantamount to condemning me to solitary confinement for life.|$|R
6000|$|Sproatly laughed. [...] "I have," [...] he answered. [...] "As I {{told the}} Company's Western {{representative}} some time ago, {{a man who}} could sell patent medicine to the folks round here could do a good trade in anything. He admitted that my contention sounded reasonable, but I didn't wear store clothes then, and he seemed very far from sure of me. Anyway, he gave me a show, and now I've got two or three complimentary letters from the Company. They've added a few dollars to my salary, and hint that it's possible <b>they</b> may <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> charge of an implement store." ...|$|R
60|$|Down {{and down}} we went, {{crossing}} great rivers by ford and ferry, until the hills flattened {{themselves and the}} country became {{a long stretch of}} level, broken by the forests only; and I saw many things I had not thought were on the earth. Once in a while I caught glimpses of great red houses, with stately pillars, among the trees. <b>They</b> <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> mind of the palaces in Bunyan, their windows all golden in the morning sun; and as we jogged ahead, I pondered on the delights within them. I saw gangs of negroes plodding to work along the road, an overseer riding behind them with his gun on his back; and there were whole cotton fields in these domains blazing in primrose flower,--a new plant here, so my father said. He was willing to talk on such subjects. But on others, and especially our errand to Charlestown, he would say nothing. And I knew better than to press him.|$|E
6000|$|But {{when the}} reason of old establishments is gone, it is absurd to {{preserve}} {{nothing but the}} burden of them. This is superstitiously to embalm a carcass not worth an ounce of the gums {{that are used to}} preserve it. It is to burn precious oils in the tomb; it is to offer meat and drink to the dead: not so much an honor to the deceased as a disgrace to the survivors. Our palaces are vast inhospitable halls. There the bleak winds, there [...] "Boreas, and Eurus, and Caurus, and Argestes loud," [...] howling through the vacant lobbies, and clattering the doors of deserted guardrooms, appall the imagination, and conjure up the grim spectres of departed tyrants,--the Saxon, the Norman, and the Dane,--the stern Edwards and fierce Henrys,--who stalk from desolation to desolation, through the dreary vacuity and melancholy succession of chill and comfortless chambers. When this tumult subsides, a dead and still more frightful silence would reign in this desert, if every now and then the tacking of hammers did not announce that those constant attendants upon all courts in all ages, jobs, were still alive,--for whose sake alone it is that any trace of ancient grandeur is suffered to remain. These palaces are a true emblem of some governments: the inhabitants are decayed, but the governors and magistrates still flourish. <b>They</b> <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> mind of Old Sarum, where the representatives, more in number than the constituents, only serve to inform us that this was once a place of trade, and sounding with [...] "the busy hum of men," [...] though now you can only trace the streets by the color of the corn, and its sole manufacture is in members of Parliament.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{learned from}} some {{attendant}} that, at least, my Brother was not dead. The King now came back. We all ran to kiss his hands; but me he no sooner noticed than rage and fury took possession of him. He became {{black in the}} face, his eyes sparkling fire, his mouth foaming. 'Infamous CANAILLE,' said he; 'darest thou show thyself before me? Go, keep thy scoundrel of a Brother company!' And so saying, he seized me with one hand, slapping me on the face with the other,'--clenched as a fist (POING),--'several blows; one of which struck me on the temple, so that I fell back, and should have split my head against {{a corner of the}} wainscot, had not Madame de Sonsfeld caught me by the head-dress and broken the fall. I lay on the ground without consciousness. The King, in a frenzy, was for striking me with his feet; had not the Queen, my Sisters, and the rest, run between, and those who were present prevented him. They all ranked themselves round me, which gave Mesdames de Kamecke and Sonsfeld time to pick me up. <b>They</b> <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> a chair in the embrasure of a window; threw water on my face to bring me to life: which care I lamentably reproached them with, death being a thousand times better, in the pass things had come to. The Queen kept shrieking, her firmness had quite left her: she wrung her hands, and ran in despair up and down the room. The King's face was so disfigured with rage, it was frightful to look upon. The little ones were on their knees, begging for me,"--[Wilhelmina, i. 265-267.]--poor little beings, what a group: Amelia, the youngest girl, about six; Henri, in his bits of trousers, hardly over four!--For the rest, I perceive, this room was on the first or a lower floor, and such noises were very audible. The Guard had turned out at the noise; and a crowd was collecting to see and hear: [...] "Move on! Move on!" ...|$|E

5000|$|The Chainsmokers {{happened}} to be in New York and I was working on some stuff at a studio nearby, and they were like, 'Can you please come? We're finishing this song. It needs a little something; we don't know what it is. Can you just come sing some background or something?' So I came in and just layered some of Drew's parts and sang those different parts that you can hear on the song. They were like, 'All right, sick, the song's done now.' It was awesome. <b>They</b> just <b>put</b> <b>me</b> <b>in</b> the booth and were like, 'Do whatever you want,' and it turned out how it did." ...|$|R
5000|$|F. W. Bourne wrote a {{biography}} of Bray, entitled A King's Son, which after its first publication in 1871, went through many editions, under several titles, for over a hundred years.
