5000|$|A month later, on 27 April 1955, Israel's 7th Independence Day, Ben-Gurion gave {{a speech}} in Ramat Gan Stadium during the main event of the Israel Defense Forces parade. The speech was {{primarily}} {{a response to the}} anti-Israeli declarations made in the Bandung Conference (the founding conference of the Non-Aligned Movement), which took place a few days earlier. In the concluding sentence, he stated: [...] "Our future does not depend on what the goyim the international community will say, but rather on what the Jews <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>will</b> do."This sentence also became a winged word (often in a different translation: [...] "It does not matter what the Gentiles will say, but rather what the Jews will do").|$|E
50|$|IDF spokespersons often {{reported}} that scores of demoralized Hamas fighters had been observed deserting. This strengthened <b>the</b> <b>Israeli</b> <b>will</b> {{to continue and}} undermined the confidence in Hamas in Gaza.|$|R

5000|$|While Miller is {{recovering}} in hospital, he is told what happened {{while he was}} unconscious. Josef warns him not to tell anyone the story. He does disclose that with Roschmann (code-named [...] "Vulkan") in Argentina, West German authorities (at the urging of <b>the</b> <b>Israelis)</b> <b>will</b> shut down his industrial facility that was producing rocket guidance systems for the Egyptian army. ODESSA's plan throughout the novel - to obliterate the State of Israel by combining German technological know-how with Egyptian biological weapons - has been thwarted. In addition, Miller's information reaches the public and badly embarrasses the West German authorities {{enough for them to}} arrest and prosecute a large number of ODESSA members (though the book notes that ODESSA continues to exist and usually succeeds in keeping former SS members from facing justice).|$|E
5000|$|According to declassified {{transcripts}} of a United States National Security Council meeting on 2 June 1967, CIA Director Richard Helms interrupted Secretary of State Dean Rusk with [...] "reliable information" [...] - contrary to Rusk's presentation - that the Israelis would {{attack on a}} certain day and time. Rusk shot back: [...] "That is quite out of the question. Our ambassador in Tel Aviv assured me only yesterday that everything was normal." [...] Helms replied: [...] "I am sorry, but I adhere to my opinion. <b>The</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>will</b> strike and their object will be {{to end the war}} in their favor with extreme rapidity." [...] President Lyndon Johnson then asked Helms for the source of his information. Helms said: [...] "Mr. President, I have it from an allied secret service. The report is absolutely reliable." [...] Helms' information came from the BND.|$|E
5000|$|Sate' Nour Al-Din, {{columnist}} for the Lebanese pro-Syrian daily Al-Safir wrote: [...] "... This operation was exemplary: Erez crossing is the crossing of daily humiliation and insult to thousands of Palestinians. Her timing was precise: This {{is a response to}} the Israeli boast that the Palestinian {{is on the verge of}} collapse and submission under the weight of the war of annihilation. Its results were ideal: four killed and 10 wounded, Israeli military personnel specializing in humiliating Palestinian workers seeking a crust of bread." [...] Nour Al-Din, however, took issue with the use of a young mother for such an operation, writing that, [...] "in the past and in the present, political Palestinian logic has prevented, prohibited, or simply objected to turning to such a final 'weapon'" [...] and that such an action would, [...] "send several negative messages - one of which was that the members and youths of the movement cannot get past the Israeli fortifications and military positions, and that no path remains to them but to deceive the Israeli soldiers in this 'intelligent' way. will result only in greater Israeli violence, particularly against Palestinian women, and <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>will</b> not be deterred from killing the children of the Shahida, Reem..." ...|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Israeli</b> F-35s <b>will</b> {{be based}} at Nevatim Airbase in the Negev. The {{decision}} {{was based on}} operational, environmental, infrastructure and training considerations, {{as well as the}} IDF's strategic vision to transfer some of its bases to the region.|$|R
40|$|The Adjusted Winner {{procedure}} (AW) is {{a conflict}} resolution mechanism developed by Steven Brams and Alan Taylor. They claim that their procedure is unique because it produces dispute solutions that are envy-fee, efficient and equitable*. Their procedure provides the parties with a settlement {{that is based on}} subjective utility, which means that the parties will receive the portion of the issue(s) they value most. In this thesis I use the AW procedure on the conflict between Israel and Palestine. I define the territorial issues in the conflict, and present the two sides’ different positions on the different issues. The territorial issues are defined as: the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, settlements, Jerusalem, borders and natural resources. Then I present how the AW procedure can produce a solution that meets the fair division criteria. Four different solutions to the territorial conflict are presented. The results for outcome 1 and 2 is that <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>will</b> win on the issues of the West Bank, water and settlements, while the Palestinians will win on the issue of borders and the Gaza Strip. The issue of Jerusalem has to be split or shared between the two parties {{as a result of the}} equitability adjustment. The results in outcome 3 show what can happen when the parties try to be strategic in their allocation of points. In this scenario <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>will</b> win on the issues of the West Bank and water. The Palestinians will win on the issues of Borders, the Gaza Strip and settlements. Also in this scenario the issue of Jerusalem has to be split or shared between the two parties as a result of the equitability adjustment. In outcome 4 the issues of borders, the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, are lumped together as one issue called borders. In this case <b>the</b> <b>Israelis</b> <b>will</b> win on the issues of settlements, Jerusalem and water, while the Palestinians will win on the issue of borders. In this scenario there is no need for an equitability adjustment. _______________ *Envy-freeness is defined as a division “in which every person thinks he or she received the largest or most valuable portion of something – based on their own valuation – and hence does not envy anyone else” (Brams and Taylor 1999 : 2). A settlement is efficient “if there is no other allocation that is better for some party without being worse for another party”. They define equitability as “both parties think they receive the same fraction of the total, as each of them value values the different items” (Brams and Taylor 1999 : 14 - 15) ...|$|E
