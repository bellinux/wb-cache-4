40|$|Dr. Rasmussen] Welcome to Defining Moments in MMWR History. I 2 ̆ 019 m your host, Dr. Sonja Rasmussen, Editor-in-Chief of the MMWR. On June 5, 1981, MMWR {{published}} {{a report of}} Pneumocystis pneumonia in five previously healthy young gay men in Los Angeles, California. This report was later acknowledged as the first {{published a}}ccount of what would become known as human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, or AIDS.

40|$|Welcome to {{the inaugural}} issue of Rejecta Mathematica! <b>Thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> {{for what we}} hope will be a unique and {{interesting}} experiment. For those unfamiliar with our mission, Rejecta Mathematica is an open access, online journal that publishes only papers that have been rejected from peer-reviewed journals in the mathematical sciences. In addition, every paper appearing in Rejecta Mathematica includes an open letter from its authors discussing the paper’s original review process, disclosing any known flaws in the paper, and stating {{the case for the}} paper’s value to the community. Since starting this endeavor, the questions we’ve been asked most often are “Why are you doing this? ” and “Is it a joke? ” While we are not above admitting that we have had a few good laughs in this process, we hope that this issue will serve as definitive proof that Rejecta Mathematica is not a joke. Despite the central role that peer review (and even rejection) must play in the scientific process [1], we believe there are several reasons why this project can make a positive and valuable contribution to the mathematical sciences research community. First, there is ample evidence that in the traditional review process, significant (eve...|$|E

This {{year you}} will hear diverse talks from the HCIL’s faculty, staff, and {{students}} on cutting-edge research which focus on three important areas of HCI work: collaboration, search, and visual interfaces. In addition, new this year, we will also be previewing five HCI books that have been either authored or edited {{in the past year}} by our lab’s faculty. Following these talks, we will continue the long-standing tradition of welcoming you to our lab for demos and posters (and of course birthday cake) ! We hope you will be staying the next day as well, May 29, 2009, to enjoy a wide variety of tutorials and workshops topics that range from usability testing, to designing for people who learn differently. The Human-Computer Interaction lab has a long, rich history of transforming the experience people have with new technologies. From understanding user needs, to developing and evaluating those innovative technologies, the lab’s faculty, staff, and students have been leading the way in HCI research and teaching. We believe it is critical to understand how the needs and dreams of people can be reflected in our future technologies. To this end, the HCIL develops advanced user interfaces and design methodology. Our primary activities include collaborative research, publications, and the sponsorship of open houses, workshops and symposiums...|$|E
40|$|Today’s {{hearing is}} the first in a two-part series that will examine the issues {{surrounding}} the treatment of migrants by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. And the first of the series, this hearing today, we will have two panels, which will primarily focus on the issue of detention. I would like to begin by thanking our witnesses: Mr. John Torres, Mr. Richard Seiter, Ms. Michelle Brane´, Ms. Christina Fiflis, and Mr. Michael Cutler. And <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> today to discuss these important issues. With the end of the ‘‘catch and release’’ program, the Department of Homeland Security faces a daunting challenge: how to deal with hundreds, perhaps thousands, of migrants that have been detained in recent enforcement actions. But the challenge is not only for law enforcement. It is also a humanitarian challenge. Our goal must not only be to detain migrants, but also to make sure that their detention is humane. And at the same time, we must explore alternatives to detention that meet our law enforcement goals and that may provide more humane conditions for these detainees. Recently, reports have signaled that detention conditions and the treatment of detainees in administrative immigration detection have not been acceptable. I have found these reports very disturbing, and so have many of my colleagues. And I hope that this hearing will shed some light on the situation and lead to action points by which we can improve the conditions of these detainees. And I am particularly interested in learning more about the Immigration and Customs Enforcement standards for care and custody of these detainees. These standards need to include a guarantee for detainees to be treated humanely and, of course, to have access to counsel. It is also critical that the subcommittee {{gain a better understanding of}} how ICE and their detention contractors work together to meet these minimum standards. In addition, I am looking forward to hearing about alternatives to detention that can appropriately monitor individuals but ensure that they show up to all the necessary hearings. As a nation, we must be committed to treating detainees appropriately, with respect for their dignity as fellow human beings and in accordance with our laws, our traditions, and, quite frankly, the idea of this great country. Recent reports indicate that we have some work to do before we achieve all of this, and I hope this hearing gives us some sense of the progress that we have made on these issues...|$|E

40|$|A region. A route. A response. — Welcome to {{the first}} edition of North; a new {{publication}} produced by students and staff from the Photography Department at the University of Central Lancashire, Preston. North is intended to be a showcase of photographic activity from North West England and a decisive challenge to the traditional degree show model that relies on gallery display as a default. At UCLan we pride ourselves on offering an open environment for early career practitioners to explore topics and approaches to visual communication however they choose. Our resistance to pursuing a ‘UCLan Style’ {{can be seen in the}} eclectic range of work featured in North produced by final year undergraduate students. This approach is only possible through the community of practice that has been developed by the combined efforts and diverse interests of an active and committed team of staff. Technical expertise, research informed teaching and contemporary industry links support the work of all students whilst simultaneously generating original work, as can be seen here in the portfolios of John Van Aitken and Brian J Morrison. Preston may not be top of the list of recognised photography cities,yet it is precisely this anonymity that can give people the space to engage with photography and develop their personal voice with the medium. Jamie Hawkesworth and Ayesha Jones are two recent alumni that used their time of study to work out what it is they wanted to do with photography and are now recognised at an international level. <b>Thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> us; North is just the starting point of an archive of the future...|$|R

40|$|Message {{from the}} President <b>Thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> {{me in this}} look back {{over the past year}} at the University of New Mexico. It was a year filled with activity, {{accomplishment}} and challenge, and this is our opportunity to reflect back on that year. In 2000 - 2001 we engaged in a University-wide strategic planning process that called on the energies and talents of hundreds of individuals- faculty, staff, students and members of our broader community. The plan, which will be completed in Fall 2001, will serve as our roadmap for the future and will guide our efforts to capitalize on the opportunities and {{to meet the challenges of}} the next several years. This process has encouraged us to examine closely our mission and our values, who we are and what we aspire to become. It has given us reason to be proud of our past and cause to think seriously about how we must change in the future. While this was a year for looking ahead, it was also a year of significant accomplishment. For example, we launched a comprehensive set of programs designed to enrich the academic and social experiences of our undergraduate students. We began the implementation of Freshman Learning Communities where small cohorts of students study and learn together in a common set of courses under the guidance of a senior faculty scholar. We reorganized our advisement systems, we undertook the construction or renovation of student-centered facilities on campus, and we created new support systems to enhance student academic success. It was a year in which our support of faculty, staff and students was our highest priority. Through the support of the New Mexico Legislature, faculty and staff received significant salary increases. A new health benefits plan for graduate assistants was implemented. Our "Staff as Students" program enabled more than 40 staff members to obtain UNM degrees. And, a Center for Scholarship in Teaching and Learning was established to assist faculty in their efforts to develop more effective teaching skills. Finally, this was a year in which UNM dramatically expanded its role in the local community and throughout the state. Never before has the University been as active or as visible in meeting its public responsibility as it was in 2000 - 2001. From its active participation in economic development initiatives, to its involvement in K- 12 educational improvement efforts, to its significant leadership role in health care delivery, UNM demonstrated its ability to help the state meet its most pressing social challenges. And, as UNM took on a more visible role in supporting the state's citizens, the support for UNM was returned in kind. This year, annual giving to the University rose to a record 35. 3 million dollars, a 40 % increase over just two years ago. All told, it has been a gratifying and successful year. However, we cannot allow our past accomplishments to mask the continued challenges facing this University. Neither will we allow these challenges to dominate our thinking and diminish out pride in what the University has achieved. So we will savor our successes and continue to move forward. As always, we <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> sharing our dreams and for supporting the University of New Mexico. Sincerely, William C. Gordon, PresidentUniversity of New Mexic...|$|R

Why don’t we begin by talking {{a little bit about your}} family background. What did your grandparents and your parents do in the Fort Worth area? 2 GOODE: Well, one of my grandfathers was a Baptist preacher. The other grandfather was an active Baptist layman. It so happens that my birthday and their birthdays were all on July thirty-first; an unusual coincidence. So I’m named after both of them: Richard and Benjamin. I don’t use the middle name much, but that’s my middle name. When I was born, my father was a small farmer. He had a varied career. Later, he was a carpenter and small contractor, and we always lived around in that area. My father was born in East Texas; my mother was born in Georgia. And that’s the family history. I was the only one of my immediate family—I had two older sisters—to attend college. Neither my parents nor my older sisters did. GARDNER: Your grandfather who was a preacher, was he a pastor of a church? GOODE: I think he was at various times, but not when I remember him. He was—well, he was essentially retired when I remembered him. My great-grandfather, by the way, was born in the eighteenth century. GARDNER: Is that right? GOODE: In 1786. GARDNER: Was that also in Texas...|$|R
