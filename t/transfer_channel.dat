WMAL-TV was separated first from its radio sisters when ABC purchased WMAL-AM-FM in March 1977.

In April 1977, Allbritton negotiated a deal to trade the station to Combined Communications Corporation in return for KOCO-TV in Oklahoma City, but called off the deal due to last-minute complications despite receiving FCC approval. Allbritton instead sold the Washington Star to Time Inc. in January 1978, and retained WJLA-TV and the Lynchburg and Charleston television stations for what would eventually become Allbritton Communications.|$|E
50|$|As {{the mold}} disk is turning, the first {{elevator}} simultaneously rises to its upper {{position and the}} space bands and matrices are vertically aligned {{in preparation for the}} second transfer. The matrices have a series of teeth in a V-shaped notch on top, and as the transfer is completed, the matrices slide onto the second elevator bar which carries the matrices by these V-shaped notches. The space bands, having no such notches, remain in the second <b>transfer</b> <b>channel</b> and are soon gathered by two levers and pushed back into the space band box. While the space bands are being pushed into their box, the second elevator continues rising towards the distributing mechanism {{at the top of the}} machine, which returns the molds to their proper places in the magazine. At the top of the machine, a lever (the distributor shifter) moves left to get in position to push the incoming line of matrices off the second elevator and into the distributor box. This mechanism feeds the matrices at precise intervals such that they travel between three rotating screws. Each matrix is carried along a notched bar between the three screws until the notches on the bar and matrix match, whereupon the matrix drops down into its proper channel in the magazine.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{separate}} the HC-emissions from two-stroke engines into short-circuit losses and emissions due to incomplete combustion, Laser Induced Fluorescence (LIF) measurements were performed on the exhaust gases just outside the exhaust ports of two engines of different designs. The {{difference between the two}} engines was the design of the <b>transfer</b> <b>channels.</b> One engine had "finger" <b>transfer</b> <b>channels</b> and one had "cup handle" <b>transfer</b> <b>channels.</b> Apart from that they were similar. The engine with "finger" <b>transfer</b> <b>channels</b> was earlier known to give more short-circuiting losses than the other engine, and that behavior was confirmed by these measurements. Generally, the results show that the emission of hydrocarbons has two peaks, one just after exhaust port opening and one late in the scavenging phase. The spectral information shows differences between the two peaks and it can be concluded that the latter peak is due to short-circuiting and the earlier due to incomplete combustion. The flow outside the exhaust port was measured with Laser Doppler Velocimetry (LDV). These measurements confirm the occurrence of two emission peaks...|$|R

It is found that when the transfer reactions are explicitly included in the calculations the imaginary part of the input $p + $ 6 He optical model potential has to be reduced by 52 percent while its real part enhanced by 15 percent in order to fit the elastic-scattering data. The effect of <b>transfer</b> <b>channels</b> on the real part of this potential is somewhat weaker than that of 6 He breakup reported previously.

40|$|The {{conventional}} {{rotor spinning}} unit generates flow vortices in the <b>transfer</b> <b>channel</b> upstream region which affect the fiber configuration and consequently yarn properties. Geometry and spinning parameters such as <b>transfer</b> <b>channel</b> length, inlet width, rotor outlet pressure, opening roller speed, and diameter {{were found to}} be key parameters influencing airflow characteristics. To reduce the flow vortices in the upper stream region, modifications of the <b>transfer</b> <b>channel</b> were proposed, and their airflow fields were analyzed using computational fluid dynamics. Three designs were studied: a round <b>transfer</b> <b>channel</b> inlet, a bypass channel for extra air supply, and one with both the bypass and the round inlet. Analysis of airflow revealed that the design with both round <b>transfer</b> <b>channel</b> inlet and a bypass proved to be very effective in properly directing the flow and minimizing vortices. The design was also characterized by smoother velocity streamlines and maximum mass flow across the <b>transfer</b> <b>channel.</b> A conventional rotor spinning unit was modified in which a round <b>transfer</b> <b>channel</b> inlet corner and a bypass channel were utilized to conduct the experimental tests. Three sets of yarn samples were produced using the conventional and modified rotor spinning units under different rotor speed conditions. Yarn properties were tested. Properties such as tenacity, CVm%, and thin and thick places of the spun yarns produced by the new design improved compared to that of the conventional yarn.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we examine the}} knowledge-Transfer Channels of the {{universities}} and public research institutes in Jena. The empirical study {{is based on a}} survey of 297 personal interviews with researchers of both types of organisations. Our study focuses on three questions: (a) The importance and multitude of existing <b>transfer</b> <b>channels,</b> (b) their geographic distribution and (c) the importance of face-to-face contacts. With regard to the first question the analysis reveals some shortcomings of the usual channels considered in many empirical studies. Above all, informal <b>transfer</b> <b>channels</b> play an important role and in addition the multitude of <b>transfer</b> <b>channels</b> at hand turns out to be large. These outcomes suggest a very cautious interpretation of the claimed influences of transfer mechanisms like patents, joint publications and so on. As to the regional distribution of the linkages our results confirm the relevance of geographical proximity. A substantial part of the relevant transfer co-operations concentrate on the city and region. Finally, we examine the idea that 'distance matters' is due to the necessity of face-to-face contacts. By means of asking the researchers directly we found the puzzling result, that knowledge-transfer rests significantly upon personal contacts, but that this does not imply a bias towards geographical proximity.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} an overview of knowledge transfer and explains the factors that enable or impede absorption capacity and knowledge transfer in the MENA countries, with particular reference to the case of Egypt. We employ the conceptual framework used in the international literature on absorption capacity and international knowledge <b>transfer</b> <b>channels</b> including FDI, international trade, ICT, education, human capital mobility and university-industry linkage, and we examine the factors that enable or impede absorption capacity and knowledge <b>transfer</b> <b>channels</b> in the MENA region and Egypt respectively. One interesting element in our study is that we present a systematic framework for the factors that enable or impede knowledge transfer in Egypt and the MENA region. We find that the factors hindering absorption capacity and knowledge transfer are related to institutions, infrastructure, macroeconomic environment, higher education and training, goods market efficiency and labour market efficiency, financial market development, technological readiness and capacity for innovation. Our results are consistent with the stylized facts in the MENA literature regarding the impediment factors hampering the transfer of knowledge in the MENA region. Our results are also in line with the stylized facts in the international literature regarding the interaction and linkage between the different knowledge <b>transfer</b> <b>channels.</b> The major policy implication from our findings is that knowledge transfer is facilitated by supporting the linkages between the different knowledge <b>transfer</b> <b>channels</b> within this systematic framework. Knowledge transfer through utilization of FDI is facilitated by the sound institutions for the provision of sufficiently qualified labour, ICT infrastructure, opening up to international trade, good university-industry cooperation, R&D and innovation capacity.
