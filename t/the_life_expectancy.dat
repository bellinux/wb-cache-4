5|$|Christchurch {{has one of}} {{the oldest}} populations in the country with {{significant}} proportion of residents wealthy senior citizens. The percentage of the population aged over 65 in Christchurch is 30.4%, almost double the national average of 16.5%. Highcliffe on the borough's eastern boundary possesses the highest percentage of elderly residents in the entire United Kingdom at 69%. The Office for National Statistics predicted that by 2031, the percentage of residents over 65 will rise to 37.9. In 2005, <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> of female residents was 83.4 years and male residents 79.7 years.

5|$|A {{large-scale}} {{slave trade}} with English privateers was begun. <b>The</b> <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> of slaves was much higher in North America than further south, because of less disease and better food and treatment, {{leading to a}} rapid increase {{in the numbers of}} slaves.

But {{by the turn of the}} 18th century, African slaves were replacing indentured servants for cash crop labor, especially in southern regions.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> in Bahrain is 73 {{for males}} and 76 for females. Compared to many {{countries}} in the region, the prevalence of AIDS and HIV is relatively low. Malaria and tuberculosis (TB) do not constitute major problems in Bahrain as neither disease is indigenous to the country. As a result, cases of malaria and TB have declined in recent decades with cases of contractions amongst Bahraini nationals becoming rare. The Ministry of Health sponsors regular vaccination campaigns against TB and other diseases such as hepatitis B.|$|E
5|$|In a {{laboratory}} experiment, the average lifespan {{for a male}} Campbell's dwarf hamster in captivity was 278 days and for a female was 356 days. In a different experiment, hamsters kept in captivity born in the summer lived {{for an average of}} 2.0–2.5 years. Young hamsters provided widely varied diets early in life are less likely to suffer digestive problems as they mature, but this is not always possible in the wild due to lack of food; this causes <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> of captive hamsters to be greater than that of wild hamsters.|$|E
5|$|Open-air cages {{installed}} in the Monkey House resulted in a dramatic improvement in <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> of its residents, but the potential for expansion and improvement after the First World War was limited by the post-war economy. Rising labour costs and minimal profits resulted in the gardens' increasing dilapidation. The zoo began to be neglected after the sale of Belle Vue in 1925, but it was rejuvenated by the appointment of Gerald Iles as zoo superintendent in 1933. A new Gibbon Cage and Monkey Mountain were created and the Reptile House was extended.|$|E

5|$|The {{decision}} to continually retain or return gifted experts (Experten) to front line battle proved extremely costly, {{resulting in the}} death in combat {{of many of the}} earlier experts and aces. This, coupled with the acute shortage of well trained pilots and the fact that by 1943 they were facing a better equipped and well-trained enemy, meant <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> of even the most gifted was tragically short. Author John Weal says that, although other Geschwaderkommodore would end up dying in combat, nothing would showcase the changing fortunes of Luftwaffe fighter forces than the death of Walter Oesau.|$|E
5|$|Although Kirchner {{was known}} to have health problems, his death was unexpected, and had {{a great impact on}} the {{politics}} of Argentina. Kirchner died at an early age, while still being a highly influential figure in politics, despite not being president at the time. Presidents Manuel Quintana, Roque Sáenz Peña and Roberto María Ortiz died in office, but none of them had a political clout comparable to that of Kirchner. President Juan Perón had a similar power and died in office, but his death was not unexpected, as he had already reached <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> of the time. Other figures of the history of Argentina who achieved great political clout, such as José de San Martín, Juan Manuel de Rosas, Julio Argentino Roca, Carlos Pellegrini and Hipólito Yrigoyen, all died when they were already retired from politics, or even abroad.|$|E

5|$|Infant {{mortality}} is often high among ruffed lemurs, {{but can also}} be highly variable. In some seasons, as many as 65% are unable to reach three months of age, possibly due to falls and related injuries, although in some seasons infant {{mortality is}} as low as 0%. For those that do survive to adulthood, sexual maturity is attained at 18 to 20 months in females and 32 to 48 months in males. Sexual maturity may take longer to reach in the wild compared to captivity. For females, the inter-birth interval, or time between successive offspring, is typically one year, and in captivity, females can remain reproductively active {{until the age of}} 23. <b>The</b> <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> for both species of ruffed lemur is estimated at 36 years in captivity.|$|E
5|$|On 28 July 1943, {{strike and}} bomber {{production}} {{was to be}} scaled down, and fighter and bomber destroyer production given priority. On 3 August 1943, Milch contradicted this and declared that this increase in fighter production would not affect production of the Ju 87, Ju 188, Ju 288 and Ju 290. This was an important consideration as <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> of a Ju 87 had been reduced (since 1941) from 9.5 months to 5.5 months to just 100 operational flying hours. On 26 October, General der Schlachtflieger Ernst Kupfer reported the Ju 87 could no longer survive in operations and that the Focke-Wulf Fw 190F should take its place. Milch finally agreed and ordered the minimal continuance of Ju 87 D-3 and D-5 production for a smooth transition period.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the opening}} of the Evergreen Point Floating Bridge in 1963, several {{proposals}} from local governments have requested the construction of a parallel span or additional pontoons to increase capacity and add infrastructure for rapid transit and bicyclists. Daily traffic crossing the bridge rose from 17,400 cars in 1964 to nearly 100,000 in 1987, making the bridge the worst traffic bottleneck in the state of Washington. By the late 1990s, the bridge was carrying twice as much traffic as it was designed to handle, and calls from Eastside cities and companies for a replacement bridge intensified. WSDOT engineers also determined that sections of the bridge would fail during a large earthquake or a major windstorm, and that the bridge was nearing the end of its life expectancy, necessitating a total replacement. The bridge underwent a major rehabilitation in 1999, including a seismic retrofit and increased resistance to stronger sustained winds, to extend <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> to 20 to 25 years.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} <b>the</b> active <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> (ALE) of residents aged 65 and older from a city of Tohoku District in Japan based on changes in their Activities of Daily Living (ADL) over the course of three years, taking into account the ADL functional recovery rate. Methods : According to the method of Andrei Rogers, et al., the survey was conducted twice using a questionnaire covering questions as to ADL independence. <b>The</b> <b>life</b> table was prepared based on the transition probability of ADL by age for the subject populations to determine <b>the</b> average <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> and ALE. Results : Among the independent persons surveyed first, <b>the</b> average <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> was 18. 7 and 23. 5 years for 65 -year-old males and females, respectively. When the ADL functional recovery rate was taken into account, the ALE stood at 17. 2 and 20. 7 years for males and females at the age of 65, respectively. Assuming that the difference between <b>the</b> average <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> and ALE represents the duration of dependence, it was calculated to be 1. 5 and 2. 8 years for 65 -year-old males and females, respectively. Conclusion : Comparison of <b>the</b> average <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> and ALE with other areas already reported revealed that the inhabitants of the city studied had a long average <b>life</b> <b>expectancy</b> and ALE, and a comparatively short duration of dependence...|$|R
