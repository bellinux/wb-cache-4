50|$|These cables use two {{parallel}} bus wires which carry electricity {{but do not}} create significant heat. They are encased in a semi-conductive polymer. This polymer is loaded with carbon; as the polymer element heats, it allows less current to flow. The cables are manufactured and then irradiated and by varying both the carbon content and the dosage then different tape with different output characteristics can be produced. There is then an inner jacket which separates the bus wires from the grounding braid. In commercial and industrial cables, an additional outer jacket of rubber or Teflon is applied. The benefits of this cable are the ability <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> <b>length</b> in the field, It is more rugged but not necessarily more reliable than series or zone heaters, it cannot over-heat itself so in theory it can be crossed, but it is bad practice to install tape in this way. Self-regulating heating cables have a specific maximum exposure temperature based {{on the type of}} polymer which is used to make the heating core which means that if they are subject to high temperatures then the tape can be damaged beyond repair. Also self-limiting tapes are subject to high inrush currents on starting up similar to an 'induction' motor so a higher rated contactor is required.|$|E

5000|$|The shafts are {{manufactured}} in various lengths {{and some are}} designed <b>to</b> be <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> <b>length.</b> Shafts are generally made from plastics, nylon polymers, or metals such as aluminium and titanium; and can be rigid or flexible. Longer shafts provide greater stability and allow a reduction in flight size which in turn can lead to closer grouping; but they also shift the weight towards the rear causing the dart to tilt backwards during flight,requiring a harder, faster throw. A longer shaft will however make the dart less responsive and increase the chance of [...] "wobbling".|$|R
50|$|Once {{manufactured}} {{the tops}} need only <b>to</b> be <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> <b>length,</b> mitered, fitted for assembly, and end capped (only {{if it is}} a visible finished end). A very specific machine for cutting the postform countertop is manufactured by only a few companies, it is commonly called a Cutting Station, Top Saw, or simply Miter Saw. This machine accurately <b>cuts</b> the countertop <b>to</b> field dimensions, making it easy for the installer to make the final scribe <b>cuts</b> on-site <b>to</b> complete the work. Sink cut outs can be made either in the field or at the installers shop.|$|R
50|$|Quill systems predate {{threadless}} systems. With {{the advent}} of threadless stems, manufacturers {{no longer need to}} provide a range of threaded forks for a given model; all threadless system forks are made with the same length steerer tube (long). The steerer tubes are then <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> <b>length</b> <b>to</b> fit upon installation. Unthreaded forks often require less labor to swap than threaded forks.|$|R
5000|$|A Lally {{column is}} a round {{thin-walled}} structural steel column oriented vertically {{to provide support}} to beams or timbers stretching over long spans. The steel shell of a Lally column is filled with concrete, which carries {{a share of the}} compression load, and helps prevent local buckling of the shell. The advantage of a Lally column over conventional structural steel is the ability <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> it <b>to</b> <b>length</b> on a construction site with simple hand tools such as a plumber’s pipe cutter or a reciprocating saw. Lally columns are generally not as strong or durable as conventional structural steel columns. The term [...] "lally column" [...] is sometimes incorrectly used in reference to other types of prefabricated steel columns.|$|R

5000|$|Peco Streamline is for {{the more}} {{experienced}} modeller. The range includes {{a wider variety of}} points and crossings, at different radii. Most of these are available with 'live' (metal) or insulating (plastic) frogs. The [...] "Electrofrog" [...] points require more complex wiring, to avoid short-circuits, but are designed to give more reliable operation of locomotives. There are no other rigid track components. Plain track is supplied in 3 foot (914 mm) lengths (2 foot for Z gauge), <b>to</b> be <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> <b>length</b> as required. It is flexible (laterally), allowing the modeller to use it for straight track or any radius curve, to suit the needs of the model. The Streamline range is supplied with different types of rail, identified by code numbers indicating the height of the rail in thousands-of-an-inch. For 00/H0 track, 'Code 100' rail is the original type, and is designed for older ready-to-run models. 'Code 83' is designed to be compatible with North American track systems. 'Code 75' is designed for 'fine-scale' models, with smaller wheel flanges, to give a more-scale appearance. N gauge Streamline track comes in code 80 and code 55.|$|R

5000|$|Branded the Lifeguard, Wayne's new conventional-style {{school bus}} design used the company's {{roll-forming}} presses to make single steel stampings that extended {{the entire length}} of the bus body. The concept was that by reducing the number of joints, the number of places where the body could be anticipated to separate in a catastrophic impact was reduced in a like amount. The [...] "Lifeguard" [...] design reduced overall body weight, the number of fasteners used, and man-hours required for assembly. However, the roll-form presses were very large, requiring special equipment to handle the finished panels. A more practical problem was the panels had <b>to</b> be <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> exact <b>length</b> for each bus body order, which varied with seating capacities and from state-to-state specifications. This created a marketing disadvantage as the Wayne factory required greater manufacturing lead time than in the past whereas the previous technology allowed for more interchangeability and customization in orders.|$|R
60|$|In {{the room}} from which this cheerful blaze proceeded, he beheld a girl seated on a willow chair, and busily {{occupied}} {{by the light of}} the fire, which was ample and of wood. With a bill-hook in one hand and a leather glove, much too large for her, on the other, she was making spars, such as are used by thatchers, with great rapidity. She wore a leather apron for this purpose, which was also much too large for her figure. On her left hand lay a bundle of the straight, smooth sticks called spar-gads--the raw material of her manufacture; on her right, a heap of chips and ends--the refuse--with which the fire was maintained; in front, a pile of the finished articles. To produce them she took up each gad, looked critically at it from end <b>to</b> end, <b>cut</b> it <b>to</b> <b>length,</b> split it into four, and sharpened each of the quarters with dexterous blows, which brought it to a triangular point precisely resembling that of a bayonet.|$|R

The issues is taking the raw bag material used for harvest and cutting it <b>to</b> a specified <b>length.</b> The material comes on a 2000 ft. spool and needs <b>to</b> be <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> a <b>length</b> of 54 in. Using an existing but out dated machine, a bench mark was made that the new design must be 10 % more efficient for the customer to invest money into building the machine. Using mechanical machine design and computer designing software the machine was designed to the customer specifications. The design was a free standing steel frame, powered by an electric motor with a v-belt pulley system to transfer the power. The design featured safety improvement as well a reduction in size. The overall design was an improvement from the current machine being used because {{it was able to}} be moved and disassembled easily. By adjusting speed the machine rotated at and cutting process the new machine was estimated to be at least 10 % and had the potential to be 25 % more efficient. By guaranteeing an improved efficiency the machine was built entirely at Central Washington University and tested with a final efficiency was 20 % over the current machine used.

500|$|In ancient Greece, long male {{hair was}} a symbol of wealth and power, while a shaven head was {{appropriate}} for a slave. The ancient Greeks had several gods and heroes who wore their hair long, including Zeus, Achilles, Apollo, and Poseidon. Greek soldiers are said to have worn their hair long in battle. Such warriors considered it a sign of aristocracy and are said to have combed it openly in order to show off. [...] Also, in order to keep enemies from getting a hold of it in battle, they were known <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> the front short, but leave it long in the back, where it was more out of reach. A widely held alternative interpretation of the conventional belief is that they kept it long, and simply tied it back in a style known as a ponytail in order to keep it out of their enemies' reach. The ponytail method allowed warriors, who often traveled to battle with a minimal amount of equipment in order to avoid excessively heavy loads over long marches, to keep their hair manageable with a small piece of string to hold their pony tail in place and a knife <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> the back <b>to</b> <b>length</b> with one simple slice. Around the sixth century, however, the Greek men shifted to shorter hairstyles, {{with the exception of the}} Spartans. Women in the culture remained with the longer style, which for them showed freedom, health, and wealth, as well as good behavior. In men, it was considered a sign of false pride by this time.|$|R
40|$|As an {{alternative}} to conventional tubing instrumentation for measuring airflow, designers and technicians at the NASA Glenn Research Center have been fabricating packaging components and assembling a set of unique probes using commercial-off-the-shelf microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) integrated circuits (computer chips). Using MEMS as {{an alternative}} has some compelling advantages over standard measurement devices. Sensor technologies have matured through high-production usage in industries such as automotive and aircraft manufacturers. Currently, MEMS are the choice in applications such as tire pressure monitors, altimeters, pneumatic controls, cable leak detectors, and consumer appliances. Conventional instrumentation uses tubing buried in the model aerodynamic surfaces or wind tunnel walls. The measurements are made when pressure is introduced at the tube opening. The pressure then must travel the tubing for lengths ranging from 20 to hundreds of feet before reaching an electronic signal conditioner. This condition causes {{a considerable amount of}} damping and requires measurements to be made only after the test rig has reached steady-state operation. The electronic MEMS pressure sensor is able to take readings continuously under dynamic states in nearly real time. The use of stainless steel tubing for pressure measurements requires many tubes <b>to</b> be cleaned, <b>cut</b> <b>to</b> <b>length,</b> carefully installed, and delicately deburred and spliced for use. A cluster of a few hundred 1 / 16 -in. - (0. 0625 -in. -) diameter tubes (not uncommon in research testing facilities) can be several inches in diameter and may weigh enough to require two men to handle. Replacing hard tubing with electronic chips can eliminate much of the bulk. Each sensor would fit on the tip of the 1 / 16 -in. tubing with room to spare. The P 592 piezoresistive silicon pressure sensor (Lucas NovaSensor, Fremont, CA) was chosen for this project because of its cost, availability, and tolerance to extreme ambient conditions. The chip is 1 mm square by 0. 6 mm thick (0. 039 by 0. 023 in.) with 0. 12 -mm (0. 005 -in.) wire connection tabs. Three MEMS chips were used to build the first type of flow-angularity probe. This MEMS probe will be demonstrated as {{an alternative to}} a standard tube type "Cobra Probe" now used routinely in wind tunnel and aeronautical hardware applications. The response time and accuracy would allow the probe to be translated on an actuator across a flow field, yielding precision dynamic measurements not possible with conventional instrumentation. The low profile, the minimal power requirement, the rugged construction, and the moderate cost all contribute to making MEMS sensors the enticing choice instrument in future research measurement needs. The MEMS probe efforts are a continuation of work initiated by Brian Willis, without whose foresight and efforts this project would never have been realized. This task was funded through cooperation with the NASA Electronic Parts and Packaging (NEPP) program at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory...|$|R
