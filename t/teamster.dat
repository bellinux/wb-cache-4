By now, it was well into October, and the Donner {{families}} split off to make better time. Two wagons in the remaining group became tangled, and John Snyder angrily beat the ox of Reed's hired <b>teamster</b> Milt Elliott. When Reed intervened, Snyder turned the whip on him. Reed retaliated by fatally plunging a knife under Snyder's collarbone.|$|E
5|$|In 1942 {{there was}} some {{pioneering}} {{in the development and}} use of contour banks, the equipment required a team 4 horses or two Clydesdales, a <b>teamster</b> and two labourers. Through the 1950s Avondale had monitored its sheep flocks as part of the research into Dwalganup strain of clover as a livestock feed and its effect on ewe fertility. On into the 1960s and 1970s Avondale was involved with the breeding and trial of various cereal crops for use within Western Australia. Since the early 1980s Avondale has focused on environmental and sustainable farming along with farm income supplemental alternatives like marron farming.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, workers' pay {{averaged}} between $11 and $18 per hour, {{depending on}} the position. With workweeks averaging between 70 and 84 hours per week, the problem for many workers became {{what to do with}} so much extra money. <b>Teamster</b> Jerry Thornhill, a typical worker, wrote to Money magazine, asking for advice. Thornhill detailed a pay rate of $57,000 per year at a time when members of Congress earned $42,500 annually, professional football players averaged $40,000, and U.S. vice president Nelson Rockefeller earned $62,500. The large amounts of money in the pipeline camps and a lack of entertainment caused frequent gambling games that sometimes involved tens of thousands of dollars. Instead of gambling, other workers saved their money for monthlong vacations to Hawaii or other warm climates, then returned to work with no money remaining.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Teamsters</b> Union {{was by far}} {{the largest}} and most notable {{contributor}} of workers to the pipeline project. <b>Teamsters</b> worked in the transportation and supply aspects of the project. All trucks were driven by <b>Teamsters,</b> supply warehouses were run by <b>Teamsters,</b> and the buses that transported workers from camps to job sites were run by <b>Teamsters.</b> <b>Teamsters</b> Local 959, with more than 23,000 employees at its peak, {{was by far the}} most dominant labor force on the pipeline project. There were frequent allegations of corruption by <b>Teamsters</b> on the project, and the Anchorage Daily News won a Pulitzer Prize for a 15-part series on the rise of Local 959 and its influence on state politics. Repeated allegations of links to organized crime were never backed up by evidence, but two <b>Teamsters</b> leaders were murdered in 1976 while investigating drug activity on the pipeline project. <b>Teamsters</b> workers strongly denied any involvement with organized crime, and pointed to the fact that 80 percent of the <b>Teamsters</b> in the project had college degrees or professional and management experience.|$|R

Luken withdrew the dairy workers from the <b>Teamsters</b> Union and testified against Hoffa before the United States Senate.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Teamsters</b> were vitally {{important}} to the labor movement, for a strike or sympathy strike by the <b>Teamsters</b> could paralyze the movement of goods throughout a city and bring a strike into nearly every neighborhood. It also meant that <b>Teamsters</b> leaders were able to demand bribes {{in order to avoid}} strikes, and control of a <b>Teamsters</b> local could bring organized crime significant revenues. During Shea's presidency, the entire <b>Teamsters</b> union was notoriously corrupt. Noted labor historian John R. Commons famously concluded that during this time, the <b>Teamsters</b> were less a union and more a criminal organization.|$|R

25|$|<b>Teamster</b> union {{officials}} have also complained about layoffs within Facilities that {{have resulted in}} massive district demotions and layoffs. <b>Teamster</b> representative, Connie Oser, has alleged that district staff have been removed while consultant contracts have been continuously and repeatedly approved by the board, consultant employees shuffled between companies, {{and the use of}} Agency CM, which enables tracking of consultants, difficult.

This claim cannot be verified since the use of Agency CM contracts.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Teamsters</b> {{quickly became}} {{the target of the}} EA. The <b>Teamsters</b> were one of the largest unions in Chicago. But since the <b>Teamsters</b> {{controlled}} the city's transportation network, the union's support was also {{critical to the success of}} any other union's job action. In early 1904, the <b>Teamsters</b> aligned all their contracts to expire simultaneously on May 1, 1905. The EA then passed a resolution on June 16, 1904, declaring that no employer would sign a contract with the <b>Teamsters</b> after May 1, 1905.|$|R

25|$|Tension on the New York piers was mounting. ILA loyalists {{and many}} other longshormen were at best {{suspicious}} of the IBL, which they viewed as a machine of the Waterfront Commission and a scab unionâ€”an organization of workers perceived as having a role in strike breaking. By early March1954, the storm finally hit when <b>Teamster</b> boss David Beck was perceived as betraying the ILA by refusing to cross an IBL picket line. News spread and on piers up and down Manhattan, ILA longshoremen refused to touch <b>Teamster</b> deliveries. Gangs of longshoremen walked off the docks in a wildcat strike.|$|E

In mid-1907, a group of {{dissident}} <b>teamsters,</b> the United <b>Teamsters</b> of America, had formed as a dual union and was seeking to organize members. Tobin pleaded for Samuel Gompers, president of the AFL, to intervene and bring about unity. Although Gompers worked hard at healing the rift, he was unsuccessful. When unity proved unworkable, Gompers denounced the United <b>Teamsters</b> as a dual union, declared their organizing practices deceptive, used {{the power of the}} AFL to promote the <b>Teamsters</b> as the only [...] "legitimate" [...] union for drivers, and ordered all local and regional AFL bodies to refuse to affiliate or cooperate with the United <b>Teamsters.</b> The tactics worked, and the United <b>Teamsters</b> soon faded away.|$|R

25|$|Presser quickly {{established}} his {{control over the}} Teamsters during his first six months in office.

Presser also strengthened the union's research and lobbying shops and established the Titan System, a computer networking system which established email communication throughout the union for the first time. He also began a major lobbying effort, particularly against a proposed labor racketeering bill.|$|E
25|$|The strike {{also gave}} the Communist League, later renamed the Workers Party of America, a strong {{position}} in Local 574, and in other <b>Teamster</b> locals within the metropolitan area of Minneapolis. Trotskyist strength grew to over 100 members. This gave leadership to the Trotskyists through the various unions they led within the Central Labor Council. As mentioned below, through organizing the first area-wide contract for any union outside of rail, the Trotskyists established locals of their party where ever there were <b>Teamster</b> locals, from South Dakota to Iowa to Colorado. The party was later driven out of that local by prosecutions under the Smith Act and a trusteeship imposed by Tobin in the early 1940s.|$|E
