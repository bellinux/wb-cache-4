25|$|From 1883 to 1959 inclusive, Yorkshire {{always had}} an amateur club captain. The extent of {{leadership}} given by <b>these</b> <b>gentlemen</b> {{has long been a}} subject of discussion. Hawke and Sellers are generally held to have been autocratic and decisive, but in fact both relied heavily on sound professional advice. At the other extreme, Wilfred Rhodes is supposed to have been the de facto captain from 1920 to 1930, but it was Major Arthur Lupton who restored discipline to the side when a row erupted between Yorkshire and Middlesex in 1924.|$|E

Say to one of <b>these</b> <b>gentlemen,</b> by way of experiment, if you please, that you believe occasions may occur where x squared + px is not altogether equal to q, and, having made him understand what you mean, get out of his reach as speedily as convenient, for, beyond doubt, he will endeavor to knock you down.|$|E
25|$|The {{publication}} of the book was the means of putting Booth at once into communication with the author and his wife, who begged her to visit them in Switzerland; and it subsequently brought about a correspondence with most of those European sympathizers with the North who handled a pen, such as Augustin Cochin, Edouard Laboulaye, Henri Martin, Edmond de Pressense, Conte du Montalembert, Monseigneur Dupanloup, and others, — men of all shades of religious and political belief at home, but united in the hatred of slavery, and in sympathy for the cause in whose success its extinction was involved. <b>These</b> <b>gentlemen</b> vied {{with each other in}} sending her advance-sheets of their boots, and numerous articles, letters, and pamphlets to meet the question of the day, which she swiftly translated, publishing them without money and without price, in the daily journals, and through the avenues afforded by the Union League Club. In return, she kept these noble Frenchmen accurately informed of the progress of events, and sent them such publications as could be of service.|$|E

25|$|Admiral Byng had {{commanded}} the British fleet sent to relieve Menorca in 1756, {{but after a}} brief and indecisive engagement, he drew off and allowed the island to fall to the French. Incensed, the British public demanded an investigation. Byng was arrested, and tried by court martial for having breached the Articles of War. Though Byng was acquitted of cowardice or disaffection, he {{was found guilty of}} failing to do his utmost, which carried a mandatory death sentence. Byng was brought aboard Monarch, which by then was anchored at Portsmouth under Captain John Montagu. Montagu recorded in the ship's log for 14 March 1757: These 24 hours very squally, with showers of wind and rain; Admiral Byng's Co. as before; at 7 A.M. his Coffin came on board; at 10 A.M. all the Ships' Boats, manned and armed, came to attend his Execution; hard gales, lowered down the lower yards: at noon all hands were called up to attend his execution; he was shot on the larboard side of the Quarter Deck by six Marines, attended by Lieut. Clark, the Marshal, and Mr. Muckings; <b>these</b> <b>gentlemen</b> went ashore after the execution was over.|$|E
25|$|He visited France and, {{while in}} Paris, spent several {{days at the}} Musée du Louvre. In Rome he sketched antiquities, sculptures and {{paintings}} at the Vatican Museums and other galleries, before carrying on to Naples, Pompeii, Bari and then Corfu. While in Italy, Barry met Charles Lock Eastlake, an architect, William Kinnaird and Francis Johnson (later a professor at Haileybury and Imperial Service College) and Thomas Leverton Donaldson. With <b>these</b> <b>gentlemen</b> he visited Greece, where their itinerary covered Athens, which they left on 25 June 1818, Mount Parnassus, Delphi, Aegina, then the Cyclades, including Delos, then Smyrna and Turkey, where Barry greatly admired the magnificence of Hagia Sophia. From Constantinople he visited the Troad, Assos, Pergamon and back to Smyrna. Whilst in Athens, Barry met David Baillie, who was taken with Barry's sketches and offered to pay him £200 a year plus any expenses to accompany him to Egypt, Palestine and Syria in return for Barry's drawings of the countries they visited. The major sites of the Middle East that they visited included Dendera, the Temple of Edfu, Philae – {{it was here that}} he met his future client William John Bankes on 13 January 1819) – then Thebes, Luxor and Karnak, then back to Cairo and Giza with its pyramids.|$|E
25|$|On 11 November 1940, Order-in-Council PC 6647 was passed. This order {{authorized}} {{the formation of}} the Air Cadet League of Canada and set forth the responsibilities of the civilian body and of the RCAF. On 9 April 1941, the Air Cadet League of Canada was granted a Dominion Charter authorizing it to operate as a charitable, non-profit corporation. An administrative headquarters was established in Ottawa, and the stage was set for a concentrated appeal for sponsors and volunteers throughout the provinces. In the early part of 1941, a national board of key men was chosen and it {{met for the first time}} in Ottawa on 2 June of that year. One of the first acts of the national directors was to appoint an outstanding chairman in each of the nine provinces. The provincial chairmen in turn, set up their committees and <b>these</b> <b>gentlemen</b> travelled widely, talking to public-minded citizens and recruiting local sponsorship for the squadrons. The organization of squadrons proceeded through the fall months of 1941 and by the end of the year there were 79 squadrons affiliated across the country. By May 1942, there were 135 squadrons and 10,000 cadets. One year later, 315 squadrons with 23,000 cadets.|$|E

500|$|Gandhi's views {{came under}} heavy {{criticism}} in Britain {{when it was}} under attack from Nazi Germany, and later when the Holocaust was revealed. He told the British people in 1940, [...] "I {{would like you to}} lay down the arms you have as being useless for saving you or humanity. You will invite Herr Hitler and Signor Mussolini to take what they want of the countries you call your possessions... If <b>these</b> <b>gentlemen</b> choose to occupy your homes, you will vacate them. If they do not give you free passage out, you will allow yourselves, man, woman, and child, to be slaughtered, but you will refuse to owe allegiance to them." [...] George Orwell remarked that Gandhi's methods confronted 'an old-fashioned and rather shaky despotism which treated him in a fairly chivalrous way', not a totalitarian Power, 'where political opponents simply disappear.' ...|$|E
500|$|The {{first act}} of the new rulers of Syria was to {{establish}} the twenty-man National Council for the Revolutionary Command (NCRC), composed of twelve Ba'athists and eight Nasserists and independents. On 9 March, the NCRC ordered Salah al-Din al-Bitar, one of the Ba'ath Party founders, to form a government, and to implement {{the policies of the}} NCRC. Later, six civilians were given membership in NCRC, three Ba'athists (Aflaq, al-Bitar and Mansur al-Atrash) and three Nasserists. However, this did not change the balance of power, and the officers still controlled the country. From the beginning, the military committee members formed state policies behind the backs of other NCRC members – when the civilian leadership found out, [...] al-Atrash said: [...] "Why do not <b>these</b> <b>gentlemen</b> speak? May I suggest they appoint a liaison officer to communicate their views to us?" [...] From that day, Umran gave the civilians a faint idea of what the committee members were planning.|$|E

500|$|Caxias {{tried to}} secure {{support from the}} {{traditional}} saquarema leadership. They attempted, however, to use him as a figurehead and to further their own agendas. He commented to Paranhos: [...] "I see what you meant, {{with respect to the}} bizarre behavior of <b>these</b> <b>gentlemen,</b> who do not wish to govern the country, when they are invited to do so, because they prefer to govern the Government. They are completely mistaken about me, since I am not disposed to serve them as a hobbyhorse." [...] Lacking support in parliament, Caxias' cabinet resigned on 24 May 1862 after losing its majority in the Chamber of Deputies (the national legislature's lower house). PedroII asked members of the Liga Progressista (Progressive League)—a new party consisting of moderate Conservatives and Liberals—to form a new cabinet. Barely a month later, Caxias' only son died at age 14 of unknown causes. There was a small consolation at the end of 1862 when, on 2 December, he was made brevet marechal de exército (army marshal), the highest rank in the Brazilian army.|$|E
500|$|Vermont Representative Frederick G. Fleetwood {{addressed}} the committee. O'Reilly had indicated that coins were being requested for local celebrations, and Fleetwood {{stressed the importance}} in American history {{of the events that}} were being commemorated. Vestal and others supported a ban on the committee passing further commemorative coin bills, but wanted the Vermont bill to pass. [...] For one thing, as Massachusetts' Robert M. Leach noted, President Calvin Coolidge was a Vermonter by birth. The Treasury officials were willing to support striking a medal rather than a coin, but as Illinois' Morton D. Hull pointed out, the sellers preferred a coin that could be spent if there was an unsold surplus, over a medal that could not. Leach's attitude toward approving more commemorative coins was typical: [...] "I believe we have been going too fast, and I believe at some time we ought to quit it, but I dislike quitting on <b>these</b> <b>gentlemen</b> representing the State of Vermont this morning." [...] Vestal issued a report the same day, stating that the committee was against more commemorative coin issues, but that the Bennington issue should pass because of the national importance of the events of 1777, and because the issue of 40,000 was relatively small.|$|E

2500|$|Her {{writings}} {{brought her}} little money, yet they secured her fame and many friends, first {{among them the}} Abbé Grégoire, with whom she carried on an extensive correspondence. [...] The quality of her scholarship also earned her the respect and friendship of several prominent Boston intellectuals, most notably William Smith Shaw and Joseph Stevens Buckminster. [...] These men would soon establish the Anthology Society, precursor to the Boston Athenæum, and become Adams’s lifelong allies and patrons, establishing in 1809 a modest annuity that would keep her out of poverty. It was through the sponsorship of <b>these</b> <b>gentlemen</b> that aided her in preparing her History of the Jews (1812).|$|E
2500|$|On 9 May 1728 Mr Carnegie of Lour, {{residing}} in the burgh of Forfar, was burying his daughter.

After the funeral, <b>these</b> <b>gentlemen</b> adjourned to a tavern, and drank a good deal. Carnegie of Finhaven got extremely drunk. Lyon of Bridgeton was not so intoxicated, but the drink made him [...] "rude and unmannerly" [...] towards Finhaven.

Together, <b>these</b> <b>gentleman</b> mavericks, who were all unusually creative in their approach to warfare, planned most of the most spectacular acts of sabotage of the Second World War. Their missions included Operation Josephine B, Operation Postmaster, Operation Chariot, Operation Anthropoid, Operation Gunnerside, the destruction of the Peugeot factory at Sochaux and many smaller (but vitally important) missions conducted in the weeks prior to the Normandy landings.|$|R
2500|$|When Briton and Tagus {{arrived in}} Valparaiso on 21 May, the Phoebe and Cherub had already {{captured}} Essex following the Battle of Valparaiso. The four British ships left port on 26June 1814 arriving at Paita further {{up the coast}} of Peru on 2July. They left the same night and continued northwards close to the shore then anchored {{near the mouth of}} the Tumbes River on the border with Ecuador."It was on this place a boat belonging to the Phoebe was upset, which occasioned the death of Lieut. Jago, and the Purser, but whether they were drowned or eaten by the Alligators is uncertain.

2500|$|The Encyclopædia Iranica {{entry for}} Dhalla – {{written by the}} son of a {{contemporary}} of Dhalla's with whom the Head Priest was at loggerheads for many years – summarizes Dhallas's position as [...] "embroiled in the problem of proselytizing [...] that plagued the community; even though he held liberal views in the matter, he always sided with the orthodox majority." [...] Dhalla himself merely acknowledged that [...] "in replying to questions concerning ceremonies and conventions I do not give my personal opinion as a thinking individual or as a humble scholar or as a reformist, because I have no authority to do so. I am the Head Priest of a [...] that is 75% conservative and of a performing priest-class that is 99% orthodox. <b>These</b> <b>gentlemen</b> consider the later [...] as authentic law-books on customs and conventions, hence my replies are perforce based mainly in conformity with their teachings." ...|$|E
2500|$|An area of {{questioning}} involved {{the book of}} Genesis, including questions such as if Eve was actually created from Adam's rib, where did Cain get his wife, {{and how many people}} lived in Ancient Egypt. Darrow used these examples to suggest that the stories of the Bible could not be scientific and should not be used in teaching science with Darrow telling Bryan, [...] "You insult every man of science and learning in the world because he does not believe in your fool religion." [...] Bryan's declaration in response was, [...] "The reason I am answering is not {{for the benefit of the}} superior court. It is to keep <b>these</b> <b>gentlemen</b> from saying I was afraid to meet them and let them question me, and I want the Christian world to know that any atheist, agnostic, unbeliever, can question me anytime as to my belief in God, and I will answer him." ...|$|E
