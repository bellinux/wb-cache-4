5|$|Heading {{into the}} game, Georgia Tech had the 11th best rushing defense in FBS football. <b>That</b> <b>defense</b> was led {{statistically}} by linebacker Philip Wheeler, {{considered by many}} to be one of the nation's best blitzing linebackers. In the days leading up to the championship game, Wheeler was named to the Rivals.com All-America team. In addition, Wheeler was a second-team All-ACC selection and a two-time ACC Defensive Player of the Week.|$|E
5|$|Leading <b>that</b> <b>defense</b> was cornerback DeAngelo Hall, a second-team All-America {{selection}} and first-team All-Big East selection {{who was also}} a semifinalist for the Jim Thorpe Award, given annually to the best defensive back in college football. Hall finished the regular season with 54tackles and 1interception. Hall was also a threat returning kicks. During the regular season, he returned 30punts for 434yards and 2touchdowns.|$|E
5|$|Taylor v. Illinois, , is a United States Supreme Court {{decision}} {{in which the}} Court held <b>that</b> <b>defense</b> witnesses can be prevented from testifying under certain circumstances, even if that hurts the defense's case. Taylor was the first case to hold {{that there is no}} absolute bar to blocking the testimony of a surprise witness, even if that is an essential witness for the defendant, a limitation of the broad right to present a defense recognized in Washington v. Texas.|$|E

5|$|Virginia Tech's defense, meanwhile, was No. 2 {{nationally in}} rushing defense and No. 3 in total defense. During the 11games {{of the regular}} season, Tech allowed an average of just 3.34yards per play, the second-lowest total allowed in Tech {{football}} history. The most important player on <b>that</b> <b>defense</b> was Tech lineman Bruce Smith, who accumulated 52tackles and 16sacks during the regular season. On December 6, Smith received the Outland Trophy, an award given to the top interior defensive lineman as voted by American sportswriters. Among defensive backs, the Hokies were led by Ashley Lee, who caught seven interceptions during the season.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1956 NBA draft, Auerbach {{had already}} {{set his sights}} on {{defensive}} rebounding center Bill Russell. Via a draft-day trade that sent Macauley and rookie Cliff Hagan to the rival St. Louis Hawks, he acquired a center in Russell, who would go on {{to become one of the}} greatest basketball players of all time. In the same draft, Auerbach picked up forward Tom Heinsohn and guard K.C. Jones, also two future Hall-of-Famers. Emphasizing team play rather than individual performances, and stressing <b>that</b> <b>defense</b> was more important than offense, Auerbach drilled his players to play tough defense and force opposing turnovers for easy fast-break points. Forward Tom Sanders recalled that the teams were also regularly among the best-conditioned and toughest squads.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 {{a private}} {{security}} guard {{with a pistol}} pursued on foot two men whom he believed tried to steal scrap metal. The men climbed on a railway embankment and started throwing rocks down at the guard who thereafter shot ten rounds in their direction, mortally wounding {{one of them in}} the head. The guard was first convicted of murder by the Municipal Court in Prague and given a sentence of 7 years imprisonment. The decision was changed by the High Court in Prague to conviction of intentional infliction of bodily harm resulting in death (i.e. manslaughter) and a sentence of five years imprisonment. The guard was finally exonerated by the Supreme Court in Brno which considered his action legitimate self-defense, noting <b>that</b> <b>defense</b> must be clearly more intensive than attack in order to be successful, and that the stones and bricks being thrown presented grave danger to the man's life.|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{shareholder}} wealth effects of takeover defenses {{by developing a}} model in which takeovers facilitate the implementation of technological innovations. In the rational expectations equilibrium of the model with explicit contracts, we show <b>that</b> takeover <b>defenses</b> are deployed to insure employees' firm-specific skills and <b>that</b> <b>defenses</b> dominate severance payments as an insurance mechanism because the latter distort the incentives of employees to exert effort. However, takeover defenses also result in managerial entrenchment. Managers of firms with weak boards choose takeover defenses which maximize their benefits of control, rather than shareholder wealth: golden parachutes serve to align managerial and shareholder preferences. ...|$|R

5|$|The book {{describes}} Bush as largely {{leaving the}} management of the war to Generals George Casey and John Abizaid and deferring to their judgment based on Bush's perception of Lyndon Johnson's micromanagement during the Vietnam War. As the generals' strategy of drawing down U.S. forces and transferring control to the Iraqis begins to fail, the book argues, Bush grows more disillusioned and sought other ideas. The book alleges that, nevertheless, the President delayed serious investigation because of his fear that leaked reports would hurt the Republican Party's chances in the 2006 congressional elections. It states <b>that</b> <b>Defense</b> Secretary Donald Rumsfeld refused to consider resigning unless the Republicans lost control of either the House of Representatives or the Senate.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth rate}} hypothesis, {{also known as}} the {{resource}} availability hypothesis, states <b>that</b> <b>defense</b> strategies are determined by the inherent growth rate of the plant, which is in turn determined by the resources available to the plant. A major assumption is that available resources are the limiting factor in determining the maximum growth rate of a plant species. This model predicts that the level of defense investment will increase as the potential of growth decreases. Additionally, plants in resource-poor areas, with inherently slow-growth rates, tend to have long-lived leaves and twigs, and the loss of plant appendages may result in a loss of scarce and valuable nutrients.|$|E
5|$|Combat {{received}} a polarized response; critics alternately called the battles deep and satisfying or shallow and repetitive. Reviewers considered the combat mechanics to be simplistic while allowing for complex tactics, {{and others said}} that the requirement to actively defend against enemy attacks and enhance offense kept fights engaging. Others also praised the combat but considered the mechanics to be robust and elaborate, presenting a solid role-playing combat system concealed under the intentionally simplistic visuals. Some reviewers said {{that a lack of}} depth made combat gradually become repetitive; they said that even when combat is funny and engaging, {{by the end of the}} game the battles can become routine. Joystiq stated <b>that</b> <b>defense</b> was more interesting than offense because it relied on time-sensitive reactions to creative enemy attacks such as Al Gore giving a presentation. Destructoid said there are too few powers available for offense for the game to remain interesting for long. GameSpot found combat was too easy and lacking in challenge because of an abundance of supplement items such as health packs that were found more frequently than they were used, and powerful abilities that quickly subdued opponents. Others disagreed, stating that the variety offered in combat, such as character abilities, allies, weapons, armor, and upgrades, ensured it always felt fun. The effects of the enhancements were sometimes considered to be confusing, and typically relying on simply equipping the highest level item available. Joystiq said the special characters that can be summoned during battle were extreme in terms of power and entertainment value.|$|E

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of defense mechanisms {{represents one of}} the most promising fields in the psychodynamic-oriented empirical research on personality disorders (PDs). This study examines the association between DSM-IV PDs and defense mechanisms. We evaluated a sample of 50 adult outpatients seeking personality assessment and psychotherapeutic treatment. PDs have been assessed using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Personality Disorder, version 2. 0. Defense mechanisms have been evaluated by a group of trained clinical psychologists and psychiatrists (interrater reliability from. 61 to. 95) using Perry's Defense Mechanism Rating Scale. Our results support the hypothesis <b>that</b> some <b>defense</b> mechanisms underlie PDs and <b>that</b> <b>defenses</b> call for further attention as we assess PDs...|$|R

25|$|Island nations, {{such as the}} United Kingdom or Japan, and {{continental}} {{states with}} extensive coasts, such as the United States, have utilized a significant naval presence to forestall an invasion of their country, rather than fortifying their border areas.
