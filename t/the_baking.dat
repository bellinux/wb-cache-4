5|$|In direct {{opposition}} to the immense productivity that she displayed in the early 1860s, Dickinson wrote fewer poems in 1866. Beset with personal loss as well as loss of domestic help, Dickinson {{may have been too}} overcome to keep up her previous level of writing. Carlo died during this time after providing sixteen years of companionship; Dickinson never owned another dog. Although the household servant of nine years, Margaret O Brien, had married and left the Homestead that same year, it was not until 1869 that her family brought in a permanent household servant, Margaret Maher, to replace the old one. Emily once again was responsible for chores, including <b>the</b> <b>baking,</b> at which she excelled.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>baking</b> {{techniques}} varied over time. In the Old Kingdom, heavy pottery molds {{were filled}} with dough and then set in the embers to bake.

25|$|In making injera, teff flour {{is mixed}} with water and allowed to ferment for several days, as with sourdough starter. As {{a result of this}} process, injera has a mildly sour taste.

Unusual for a yeast or sourdough bread, the dough's {{viscosity}} allows it to be poured onto <b>the</b> <b>baking</b> surface, rather than rolled out.|$|E

25|$|The siege {{continued}} {{throughout the}} summer of 117, but the years of constant campaigning in <b>the</b> <b>baking</b> eastern heat had taken their toll on Trajan, who suffered a heatstroke.

25|$|According to the Book of Chronicles, the Kohathite clan had {{charge of}} <b>the</b> <b>baking</b> and setting {{in order of}} the bread, {{suggesting}} that there were secret extra requirements in preparing the bread, known only to the Kohathites.

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>baking</b> of matzo is labor-intensive, as only 18–22 {{minutes is}} {{permitted}} between {{the mixing of}} flour and water to the conclusion of baking and removal from the oven. Consequently, {{only a small number}} of matzos can be baked at one time, and the chabura members are enjoined to work the dough constantly so that it is not allowed to ferment and rise. A special cutting tool is run over the dough just before baking to prick any bubbles which might make the matza puff up; this creates the familiar dotted holes in the matzo.|$|E
25|$|Dextrins can be {{produced}} from starch using enzymes like amylases, as during digestion {{in the human body}} and during malting and mashing, or by applying dry heat under acidic conditions (pyrolysis or roasting). The latter process is used industrially, and also occurs on the surface of bread during <b>the</b> <b>baking</b> process, contributing to flavor, color and crispness. Dextrins produced by heat are also known as pyrodextrins. The starch hydrolyses during roasting under acidic conditions, and short-chained starch parts partially rebranch with α-(1,6) bonds to the degraded starch molecule. See also Maillard Reaction.|$|E
25|$|Seurat uses {{a variety}} of means to suggest <b>the</b> <b>baking</b> heat of a summer’s day at the riverside. A hot haze softens {{the edges of the}} trees in the middle-distance and washes out colour from the bridges and {{factories}} in the background—the blue of the sky at the horizon is paled almost to whiteness. A shimmering appearance at the surface of Bathers at Asnières subtly reinforces this saturating heat and sunlight. Writing about these effects, the art historian Roger Fry reported his view that, “no one could render this enveloping with a more exquisitely tremulous sensibility, a more penetrating observation or more unfailing consistency, than Seurat”.|$|E

Aged 35, he recorded a duck in the first innings against Andhra and was absent hurt in the second, as his team succumbed to an innings defeat. Besides his young brother, Anandan, several others members of Raghavan's family represented what is now Kerala at first-class level, including his son, A. P. M. Gopalakrishnan, and two nephews, brothers P. M. K. Raghunath and P. M. K. Mohandas. Outside of playing cricket, the family have been prominent in <b>the</b> <b>baking</b> trade in Kerala.|$|E
