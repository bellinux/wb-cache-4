40|$|Abstract—The ruling span {{concept is}} widely used to {{calculate}} sags and tensions for new overhead transmission lines and for up-grading existing lines. It provides satisfactory results for a level line with relatively uniform spans at any temperature, or for any span length of a level line at low temperature. The ruling span concept may result in an unacceptable error if {{it is used to}} calculate sags and tensions in a line segment with significantly unequal spans at high temperature. This paper presents a method to calculate sags and tensions of multi-span line segments at different temperatures based on the rotational stiffness of suspension insulator strings. A simple equation, based on the parabolic approximation, is derived to calculate changes in the span lengths and conductor sags and tensions. The method follows the ruling span concept but relaxes the Fundamental assumption of the ruling span method. The accu-racy of the method is compared with the more complex, nonlinear, finite element method.

5000|$|Epoxy {{is either}} {{any of the}} basic {{components}} or the cured end products of epoxy resins, {{as well as a}} colloquial name for the epoxide functional group. [...] Epoxy resins, also known as polyepoxides, are a class of reactive prepolymers and polymers which contain epoxide groups. Epoxy resins may be reacted (cross-linked) either with themselves through catalytic homopolymerisation, or {{with a wide range of}} co-reactants including polyfunctional amines, acids (and acid anhydrides), phenols, alcohols and thiols. These co-reactants are often referred to as hardeners or curatives, and the cross-linking reaction is commonly referred to as curing. Reaction of polyepoxides with themselves or with polyfunctional hardeners forms a thermosetting polymer, often with high mechanical properties, temperature and chemical resistance. Epoxy has a wide range of applications, including metal coatings, use in electronics / electrical components/LED, high <b>tension</b> electrical <b>insulators,</b> paint brushes manufacturing, fiber-reinforced plastic materials and structural adhesives.|$|R

For this Purpose in this paper the GIS 132 KV substation model is studied[1]. In GIS 132 KV with opening and closing the disconnect switch, the VFTO fast transient overvoltage with few nanoseconds forehead time is occurred[7]. This waves is released during the phase conductors and its caused <b>tension</b> in <b>insulators</b> and electrical equipment such as transformers. Transient electromagnetic field has been created, by these waves penetrates to environment by holes between GIS compartments and causes {{the effect on the}} electrical equipment and cables. These overvoltages have range about a few hundred MHz frequencies. In this substation the compartments transient voltage and its maximum amplitude at different points for different switching performance is calculated [2]. In this paper the simulations have been conducted with the EMTP software and simulation results are presented...|$|R
40|$|High <b>tension</b> <b>insulators</b> are {{generally}} built of several porcelain discs in series, the discs being connected by galvanized steel hardware. When alternating voltage is impressed across such a string the voltage is not distributed symmetrically because the charging current {{is not the}} same through the string. There is capacitance from each connector to the next, from each connector to the ground and to the line wire, as well as capacitance from one connector to one which is not adjacent. If the voltage impressed is direct and all the units or discs are exactly alike, then such an air insulator string would have across each unit the same value of voltage. A certain leakage current flows through each insulator, and the d. c. voltage across each unit will be the leakage current multiplied by the resistance of each unit. In the transmission of high-voltage direct current, such as the Thury system found in Europe, high-tension porcelain insulators can be used to insulate the line from the ground. Such insulators are exposed to changing weather conditions of humidity and temperature. Also, these insulators on account of being subjected to mechanical stresses, electrical stresses, and repeated temperature cycles, depreciate in resistance, become faulty, and unless detected may interfere with the operation of the transmission system. If the resistance of the insultors forming the string, and the effect produced on the resistance by temperature, humidity, etcetera, are known then it is possible to predict to a certain degree of approximation what service the insulators can give. Besides determining the condition of such insulators, a knowledge of the resistance would give a basis for comparing different types of insulators, and likewise would furnish a means for arriving at the voltage distribution of different makes and types and the uniformity with which a given type could be expected to run. In the investigation carried out, the results of which are tabulated below, particular attention was given to the determination of the surface and interior resistance, and the effect of change of temperature and humidity on the electrical resistance of various types and makes of high-tension porcelain insulators. The humidity effect is not an internal one, but manifests itself by changing the surface of the insulator so that a greater freedom is given to the flow of current over the surface between the cap and the pin of the insulator...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to study dynamic effects of ice shedding on overhead transmission lines using a reliable numerical model. Overhead transmission lines are subjected to various static and dynamic loads. Ice shedding from the conductors is one of the dynamic loads occurring in cold regions. This phenomenon happens when glaze ice formed on the cables suddenly falls under certain temperature and wind conditions. In extreme instances, clashing and breakage of insulator and conductors are potential consequences of these dynamic forces. Maximum vertical cable jumps and drops in unloaded and loaded spans, and axial cable stresses are particular concerns. The main assumptions and limitations of the proposed numerical model are discussed in detail, with appropriate stiffness, mass, damping, and ice-shedding load modelling. A nonlinear finite-element model using a commercial software (ADINA) was used to carry out simulations of 21 different ice-shedding scenarios varying the number of successive spans involved, the amount of ice accreted on the cables, different elevations of the central support, partial and sub-span ice shedding and the configuration and sequence of the shedding in adjacent spans. The analysis of the results focuses on the peak cable <b>tensions</b> generated, the <b>insulator</b> string swings and the maximum transient in-span cable displacements. Some of the results are compared with the design procedures used at Hydro-Quebec, which is based on static analysis...|$|R
