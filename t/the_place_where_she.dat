5|$|Lisa {{dreams that}} it is December 1944 and that Marge is a soldier in World War II. Due to Marge being taken {{suddenly}} for overseas deployment while buying a Christmas tree the previous year, Lisa has sworn to never see another Christmas tree until Marge returns home safely. However, during Christmas of 1944, the family gets a telegram saying that Marge is missing in action. After hearing the news, Lisa runs away to <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> had last seen her mother, the Christmas Tree Farm. The owner of the place says that Marge paid for a tree the previous year but never picked it up. Lisa, believing the tree to be a symbol that Marge is alright, takes it home and decorates it together with Homer and Bart. Marge is then seen assassinating Adolf Hitler with an MP40 {{in a movie theater}} in France as he watches a propaganda film. When she walks away from the scene, the theater explodes behind her.|$|E

25|$|As {{a matter}} of course in the Royal Navy, all captains who lost ships were tried by Courts-Martial. And so Belcher was tried by court-martial for abandoning the four {{seaworthy}} vessels, as were Resolutes captain, Henry Kellett; Intrepid 's commander, Francis Leopold McClintock; and Pioneer 's commander, Sherard Osborn. All were acquitted. Belcher, however, never received another commission and was scorned by the officers of his Court-Martial when they returned his sword to him in complete silence. Resolute continued to move slowly eastward in the pack ice, and one year later in the autumn of 1855 she was 1200 miles away from <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> had been abandoned. In September 1855 an American whaler named James Buddington, from New London, CT saw Resolute adrift in the pack ice off Cape Walsingham in Davis Strait. He split his crew and sailed her back to New London, arriving home on Christmas Eve. Buddington's ship, George Henry, had preceded Resolute, and many were beginning to wonder if Buddington was still alive. The British government waived all claims to the ship upon learning of its arrival in New London.|$|E
500|$|In May 1553 Mary's second {{youngest}} brother, Guildford Dudley, {{was married}} to Edward's favourite cousin, Lady Jane Grey. According to Lady Jane it was Mary Dudley who, on 9July 1553, called upon her to bring her to Syon House, <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> was informed she was Queen of England according to King Edward's will. After Mary I's triumph within a fortnight and the arrest and execution of the Duke of Northumberland, the Sidneys were in a precarious situation. Like {{the rest of the}} Dudley family, Mary Dudley was attainted and suffered the consequences in her legal status. Henry Sidney's three sisters, however, were favourite ladies of Queen Mary, which may have saved his career. In early 1554 he went with an embassy to Spain to plead with England's prospective king consort, Philip, for the pardon of his brothers-in-law John, Ambrose, Robert, and Henry. John Dudley, the eldest brother, died days after his release in October 1554 at Penshurst Place in Kent, the Sidneys' manor house granted to them by Edward VI in 1552. Philip Sidney, Mary Dudley's first child, was born there in November 1554 and named after his godfather, the King. His godmother, the widowed Duchess of Northumberland, died in January 1555. She left her daughter 200 marks as well as a cherished clock [...] "that was the lord her father's, praying her to keep it as a jewel." ...|$|E

The character of Helen Graham was probably inspired by Anna Isabella Milbanke, the wife of George Byron. Like Anna, Helen firstly believed that reforming her husband's behaviour was her religious obligation. Despite disillusionment, both women retained their Universalist faith.|$|E

The book is set some 20 years after the time period depicted in Mockingbird, when Scout returns as an adult from New York to visit her father in Maycomb, Alabama. It alludes to Scout's view of her father, Atticus Finch, as the moral compass ("watchman") of Maycomb, and, according to the publisher, how she finds upon her return to Maycomb, that she [...] "is forced to grapple with issues both personal and political as she tries to understand her father's attitude toward society and her own feelings about <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> was born and spent her childhood." ...|$|E
2500|$|Burton {{was born}} Richard Walter Jenkins Jr. on 10 November 1925 {{in a house}} at 2 Dan-y-bont in Pontrhydyfen, Neath Port Talbot, in Wales. He was the twelfth of {{thirteen}} children born to Richard Walter Jenkins Sr. (1876-1957), and Edith Maude Jenkins (née Thomas; 1883-1927). Jenkins Sr., called Daddy Ni by the family, was a coal miner, while his mother worked as a barmaid at a pub called the Miner's Arms, which was also <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> met and married her husband. According to biographer Melvyn Bragg, Richard is quoted saying that Daddy Ni was a [...] "twelve-pints-a-day man" [...] who sometimes went off on drinking and gambling sprees for weeks, and that [...] "he looked very much like me". He remembered his mother to be [...] "a very strong woman" [...] and [...] "a religious soul with fair hair and a beautiful face".|$|E
2500|$|There are no {{documentary}} {{sources to}} confirm the exact year of her death—probably 1405—or of <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> was buried. [...] Portuguese historian Joze Barbosa, in his work Catalogo das Rainhas de Portugal, said that she died on 27 April 1386 in Tordesillas {{and that she was}} buried in a convent in Valladolid, without specifying which one. However, there is evidence that Leonor was still alive in 1390 when her son-in-law, King John I of Castile, in the Cortes that were held that year in Guadalajara, included her in the expenses of his household. In the same year, after the death of the Castilian monarch, Leonor left Tordesillas and settled in Valladolid. In his last will executed in July 1385, King John I entrusted his son, the future Henry III of Castile, with the responsibility of always honoring his wife Beatrice and his mother-in-law Leonor Teles. When Henry III executed his will on 4 December 1406, he mentioned Beatrice but not Leonor and, consequently, it can be assumed that she had already died.|$|E

2500|$|Raonaid {{spent the}} evening of 3 September {{socialising}} in Scotts pub on Georges Street, Dún Laoghaire, a place she knew well. She had just finished her shift in the boutique at 9:00pm. It was to be <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> was last seen alive. She left at approximately 11.20pm, planning to meet friends again later, and started the 15-minute walk home. It is believed that she argued with a man described as being in his mid 20s an estimated 25 minutes after leaving the pub in the laneway between Silchester Road and her home in Silchester Park. Witnesses heard a female voice expressing a cry of [...] "leave me alone", [...] "go away" [...] or something similar. [...] "Fuck off" [...] was also heard. This {{was followed by a}} scream. Raonaid was stabbed four times in the side, chest and shoulder with a one-and-a-half-inch sharp knife while in Silchester Crescent. Her murderer escaped and Raonaid staggered 200 feet before she collapsed and died from her injuries. Her body was found by her sister Sarah 50 yards from her home, at 12:20am on the morning of Saturday 4 September. Raonaid was not sexually assaulted nor were her possessions stolen.|$|E

Maggie worked as a cashier for Oak Park Hospital. Griffin has four older siblings: Kenny, Joyce, Gary, and John. Griffin {{described}} herself during her early years as [...] "a kid who needed to talk, all the time." [...] She would often visit her neighbors, the Bowens, to tell them stories about her family; she has referred to those visits as her first live shows and <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>she</b> learned [...] "the power of juicy material." [...] After most of her siblings had moved, Griffin often spent hours {{alone in the house}} and developed a binge eating disorder. She explained that even though eating disorders were not very well known at that time, she knew her eating behavior was aberrant and always threw the garbage away in the neighbor's can. In her 2009 autobiography Official Book Club Selection, Griffin confessed that she [...] "still suffers [...] " [...] but has learned to [...] "deal with them." [...] In the same book, Griffin discussed her eldest brother, Kenny, who was a drug addict and homeless at various times, and revealed that she was [...] "afraid of him until the moment he died" [...] due to his violent, abusive nature. Griffin states that Kenny would climb into bed with her when he was 30 and she was 7 and [...] "whisper" [...] into her ears; Kathy refused to speak to him or {{be in the same room}} as him for years but didn't tell her parents until she was in her twenties, at which point he openly admitted pedophilia to their parents.|$|E
