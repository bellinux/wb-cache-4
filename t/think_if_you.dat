At first it was painful to watch all those things but now I take it as {{constructive}} criticism or I don't bother to look at it.|$|E
500|$|Bolton defender Alan Stubbs was {{confident}} Bolton could cause Liverpool problems: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> look round the team {{we have got}} good quality everywhere and that's why we are doing so well, we have also got good players in reserve who {{can come in and}} do a job. We have played together {{for a long time and}} we are strong both mentally and physically this year. And if the forwards have not been scoring, the midfield and wingers have." ...|$|E
500|$|In another memo, Steinbeck {{noted that}} the pathos of Suzy being a prostitute had given much of the {{dramatic}} tension to the scene in which Doc rejects Suzy, and later, her rejection of him. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will finally bring {{the theme of this}} play into the open, but wide open, you will have solved its great weakness and have raised it to a high level... If this is not done, I can neither believe nor take Pipe Dream seriously." ...|$|E

500|$|She {{was aware}} {{from the outset}} that her {{circumstances}} would make her vulnerable to [...] "ladies who lunch"-style remarks (sometimes made against women, married to wealthy, high-profile men, who engage in charitable activities), but said, [...] "People who criticise these women are probably giving into cynicism, and I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> get cynical about life, you lose the real meaning of it." [...] In 2007, she {{became a member of}} the board of directors for Chernobyl Children's Project International, a role that would give her a voice in the organisation's policy making. In 2009, she staged a public abseil of the 17-storey Elysian Tower in Cork to raise funds for the organisation.|$|E
500|$|In his {{response}} to the controversy generated by the removal of Confederate monuments as highlighted by the August, 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, Barkley stated, [...] "I’ve never thought about those statues a day in my life. I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> asked most black people to be honest, they ain’t thought a day in their life about those stupid statues. What we as black people need to do: We {{need to worry about}} getting our education, we need to stop killing each other, we need {{to try to find a}} way to have more economic opportunity and things like that. Those things are important and significant. You know, I’m wasting time and energy [...] screaming at a neo-Nazi, or [...] ‘Man, you’ve got to take this statue down.'” ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Phil Klemmer and John Enbom and {{directed}} by Harry Winer, marking both Klemmer and Enbom's eleventh writing credit, and Winer's third directing credit for the series. Klemmer and Enbom initially thought {{that they would be}} unable to write the episode because they didn't know very much about American football—so they tried to make the episode less about football. Enbom stated, [...] "Rob just sort of handed [...] down. I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> play strict attention, you'll find it isn't as footbally as an episode about a football player could possibly be. And I think that's why." [...] The episode did not have the budget to hire a full football team, so several scenes were devoid of extras, including when Veronica meets one of the football players and when she breaks into the locker room.|$|E

500|$|According to Variety magazine, {{the script}} for Hannibal was: [...] "quite {{faithful}} to the Harris blueprint; fans of the tome may regret the perhaps necessary excision of some characters, most notably Mason Verger's muscle-bound macho sister Margot, {{as well as the}} considerable fascinating academic detail, but will basically feel the book has been respected (yes, even the climactic dinner party is served up almost intact, with the only surprise twists saved for its wake)." [...] Time Out noted: [...] "The weight-watchers script sensibly dispenses with several characters to serve a brew that's enjoyably spicy but low on substance. So much story is squeezed into 131 minutes that little time's left for analysis or characterization." [...] Producer Dino De Laurentiis was asked why some characters, notably Jack Crawford, were left out of the film: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> get a book which is 600 pages, you have to reduce it to a script of 100 pages. In two hours of film, you cannot possibly include all the characters. We set ourselves a limit, and cut characters which weren't so vital." ...|$|E
500|$|Several of the opera's novel features, {{including}} the use of a large amateur orchestra, and specifically its use of handbells, posed problems for Britten's publishers, Boosey & Hawkes. Ernst Roth made enquiries about the availability of handbells to the firm Mears & Stainbank (the bell foundry based in Whitechapel, London), and then wrote to Britten urging him to prepare an alternative, simplified version of Noye's Fludde for publication, since the rarity of handbells in the scale of E flat made the original score, in his view, impractical. Britten resisted such a proposal: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> consider a performance of this work in a big church with about fifty or more children singing, you will agree that the orchestra would sound totally inadequate if it were only piano duet, a few strings and a drum or two." [...] Britten suggested, rather, that Boosey & Hawkes should invest in a set of E flat handbells to hire for performances; or, that the handbells music could be simply cued in the piano duet part.|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{the course}} of the show, Val was often played up as the good girl character. When asked about whether Val was a weak character, Van Ark said: [...] "God, no. No she wasn’t. For the very reason that she went through so much and landed on both feet. She was strong in a {{realistic}} kind of way. I do remember that TV Guide did a quote that the three of us can be compared to Earth, Wind and Fire. Michele was the Earth, I was the Wind and Donna was the Fire. I think that really captured it." [...] Van Ark was later asked about who she saw Val as today. She said, [...] "Of course the dysfunctional elements would come out. Why even bother otherwise? But of course they would persevere and still be together after all. I think Valene was headed to, and my sister’s like this, after years of doing everything for her husband and her children, Valene was going to further her achievements in the professional world. I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> saw Valene today she’d be much more accomplished as a writer and would be very successful overall." [...] The actress also said: ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the season}} opener at #12 California, he caught one pass for 28yards and made two rushing {{attempts}} for 16yards. Against Division I FCS James Madison, Smith caught eight passes for 80yards, rushed twice for 22yards and a touchdown, and returned four kickoffs 127yards, including one 81-yard touchdown return. Despite the strong statistical performance, head coach Ralph Friedgen said, [...] "To be honest with you, I was kind of expecting more out of Torrey. I've {{got a lot of}} faith in him. I'm not surprised at all about the return yards. But I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> asked Torrey, he has high expectations for himself, too." [...] Smith agreed with the criticism, and acknowledged that in his second season as a wide receiver, he had room for improvement. He recorded five catches for 165yards and two touchdowns in the Middle Tennessee game, and caught four passes for 112yards against Rutgers. He led the team with three receptions for 64yards and a 29-yard touchdown against Clemson, and became the first player in the nation to reach 1,000all-purpose yards on the season. Against Wake Forest, Smith returned six kickoffs 194yards and caught a career-high ten passes for 70yards and a touchdown. For his performance, he was named the Atlantic Coast Conference Specialist of the Week. Wake Forest head coach Jim Grobe said, [...] "This kid is probably a better receiver [...] He catches the ball better, he's got great foot speed. He can hurt you running the ball or catching it. Everywhere you look, he's a problem." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 2013, Feige {{said that}} [...] "in an ideal world" [...] {{releases}} each year would include one film {{based on an}} existing character and one featuring a new character, saying it's [...] "a nice rhythm" [...] in that format. While not always the case, as evident by the 2013 releases of Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World, he said it is [...] "certainly something to aim for." [...] Feige expanded on this in July 2014, saying, [...] "I don't know that we'll keep to [...] every year", but we're doing that in 2014 and 2015, [...] "so I {{think it would be}} fun to continue that sort of thing." [...] In February 2014, Feige stated that Marvel Studios wants to mimic the [...] "rhythm" [...] that the comic books have developed, by having the characters appear in their own films, and then come together, much like [...] "a big event or crossover series," [...] with Avengers films acting as [...] "big, giant linchpins." [...] After the reveal of multiple release dates for films through 2019 in July 2014, Feige stated, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> look at some of those dates that we've announced, we're going to three in a few of those years. Again, not because there's a number cruncher telling us to go to three, do more than two pictures a year, but because of the very reason just laid out: it is about managing [...] franchises, film to film, and when we have a team ready to go, why tell them to go away for four years just because we don't have a slot? We'd rather find a way to keep that going." [...] After the titles were revealed in October 2014, Feige said, [...] "The studio's firing on all cylinders right now ... which made us comfortable for the first time ... to increase to three films a year [...] instead of just two, without changing our methods." ...|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Michael Parkinson broadcast on ITV1 on 4 March 2006, Blair referred {{to the role of}} his Christian faith in his {{decision to go to war}} in Iraq, stating that he had prayed about the issue, and saying that God would judge him for his decision: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> have faith about these things, you realise that judgement is made by other people... and if you believe in God, it's made by God as well." ...|$|E

2500|$|For {{approximately}} {{the first two}} weeks of Joplin's stay at the Landmark, she did not know Caserta was in Los Angeles. Joplin learned of Caserta's presence at the Landmark from a heroin dealer who made deliveries there. Joplin begged Caserta for heroin, and when Caserta refused to provide it, Joplin reportedly admonished her by saying, [...] "Don't <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can get it, I can't get it." [...] Within a few days, Joplin became a regular customer of the same heroin dealer.|$|E
2500|$|Child-safety {{advocate}} Marc Klaas {{has come}} out publicly in support of Perverted-Justice and the work they do, suggesting that they go {{from city to city}} with their efforts. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were to take this 'Dateline' piece {{and turn it into a}} regular program, where Perverted-Justice and Chris Hansen or somebody else were to go from city to city to city on a weekly basis, you would create a real deterrent effect that would put some fear into the minds of these perverts." ...|$|E
2500|$|Senator Charles Schumer (D-NY) stated {{shortly after}} the {{meetings}} that [...] "I <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> were to hold the vote today, she would not get a majority, either in the Judiciary Committee or on the floor." [...] However, Specter, the committee chairman, rejected the notion that Miers' nomination was shaky. He said that most senators {{were waiting for the}} hearings before making up their mind. [...] "There are no votes one way or another," [...] he said on CBS' Face the Nation. On October 19, 2005, Specter and Leahy announced their intent to begin confirmation hearings for Miers on November 7, 2005.|$|E

2500|$|Cole's game {{incorporates}} an attacking {{approach to}} his play, which supports his teams' forward play. As a youth, he [...] "always liked scoring goals and attacking", but grew {{to love the}} role of defending, as being a left-back was the only opportunity of breaking into the seniors. Prior to his inclusion in the Arsenal first team, Cole studied the conduct of fellow defender Nigel Winterburn to improve his play; Winterburn concurrently offered pointers to improve his positioning. He modelled his game on Brazilian Roberto Carlos: [...] "He's got natural talent, but I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> train hard enough you can be nearly as good as that." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I think I'm a chameleon. I think it's {{something}} that I possibly inherited early on {{as a child}} {{going back and forth}} between two families. I know that whether it's right or wrong, I have an ability to sort of fit into a lot of different situations and make people feel relatively comfortable in a wide range without giving up all my moral values. I think that same chameleonlike quality can transfer into films. I <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can remember the reason you got involved with {{it in the first place}} and try to keep that impulsive, instinctive feeling even when you're being beaten down or exhausted or waylaid, you'll be successful." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tony Kubek {{initially}} {{had trouble}} {{adjusting to the}} world of broadcasting. Although he had a lot to say, he was gangling, he tended to stutter, and he talked too fast. Gowdy soon suggested to Kubek that he should work in the off-season to improve his delivery. Kubek bought a tape recorder and took to reading poetry aloud for 20 minutes a day. In 1968, Kubek wowed as a World Series field reporter. Pee Wee Reese, who was soon fired by NBC (and replaced by Kubek as the top analyst) said of Kubek [...] "He wormed his way around, but I wasn't bitter. I just <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't have anything to say, you should shut your mouth." ...|$|E
