5|$|In the {{first-class}} {{season of}} 1940–41, with the proposed England tour and the Sheffield Shield competition both cancelled {{because of the}} war, Ring played half a dozen first-class matches for Victoria, achieving little with his bowling, but making 72 when promoted to No 3 batsman as a nightwatchman against South Australia at Adelaide and following <b>that</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> 60 against Queensland at Brisbane.|$|E
5|$|After {{getting married}} in the offseason, Gromek entered the 1946 Cleveland Indians season {{as one of the}} four primary {{starting}} pitchers alongside Allie Reynolds, as well as Bob Feller and Red Embree who had returned from the war. Gromek started the season by pitching in the home opener against Detroit. In a 7–0 loss, the Tigers allowed two hits, one of which was a single by Gromek, who allowed five runs in six innings. After losing his first three games of the season, he won his next three in May, which included two complete game shutouts against the Athletics and Browns. He followed <b>that</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a four-game losing streak, which went through the end of June. After his June 28th win, however, Gromek fell in a slump, and Indians management reduced his role to that of a part-time starter who would only see action in a few innings at a time. Gromek lost seven straight games between June 28 and September 10 before breaking the streak in his second-to-last appearance of the season, a 4–2 victory against the Yankees. Gromek finished the season with a 5–15 record and a 4.33 ERA in 29 games.|$|E
5|$|Gromek {{started the}} 1944 season in Cleveland's bullpen. On May 16, {{he entered a}} game against the Senators in the first inning after starter Allie Reynolds had already allowed three runs. From there, Gromek held the Senators {{scoreless}} on just two hits, bringing his ERA for the season down to 0.57 (1 earned run in 15.2 innings). Though the Indians still lost the game, it convinced Boudreau to try Gromek as a starter. On May 21, Gromek made his first start of the season in the second game of a doubleheader with the A's. Through the first six innings, Gromek held the A's scoreless on four hits. Meanwhile, back-to-back home runs by Roy Cullenbine and Pat Seerey in the fourth inning gave Cleveland a 2–0 lead. A seventh-inning error by third baseman Ken Keltner allowed two unearned runs to tie the score, and a wild pitch the following inning allowed the winning run to score. On July 2, after spending June as a reliever, Gromek earned his first win of the season against the Washington Senators after being placed back in the starting rotation, and did not allow a hit until the eighth inning in a 6–3 win; he remained a starter {{for the rest of the}} season. On July 14 against the St. Louis Browns, Gromek pitched 14 innings to earn the complete game 3–2 victory over Bob Muncrief, who also pitched all 14 innings for St. Louis. He followed <b>that</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a complete game shutout against the New York Yankees, and 1–0 loss in which Gromek allowed two hits against the Boston Red Sox. He ended the season winning six of his final seven decisions, finishing the year with a 10–9 record with a 2.56 ERA, and had a league leading 7.1 hits per nine innings.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} season, Christopher {{was part}} of an optimistic 1945 Athletics team, so much so that coach Earle Mack felt that Christopher, Black, Newsom and Jesse Flores were the best quartet of starting pitchers in the league. He spent most of spring training holding out for a new contract, which was eventually agreed on in the middle of March. He missed the first couple weeks of the season due to injury, and won his season debut on April 18, a 12-inning shutout against the Senators. He followed <b>that</b> <b>up</b> <b>with</b> a victory over the Boston Red Sox, allowing only one earned run in his first 21 innings of the season. In mid-June, Christopher had won ten games, which not only led the league, but was more than the seven the rest of the Athletics pitching staff had combined. On July 21, Christopher {{was part of}} a 24-inning game against the Tigers that ended in a 1–1 tie; he went 13 innings in the game while Joe Berry pitched the other 11. Although Christopher had a strong start to the season, he struggled during the second half. He lost seven straight games over a two-month period before winning another on August 19 against the Tigers. He finished the year with a 13–13 record and a 3.17 ERA. He was selected to the American League All-Star team, however the game was canceled as a result of World War II.|$|E
