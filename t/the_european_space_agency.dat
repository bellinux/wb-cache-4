JUICE is proposed to be launched in 2022. ISRO will launch the first Indian mission to Jupiter in 2022 or 2023 through Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III.|$|E
5|$|As 241Am has {{a roughly}} similar {{half-life}} to 238Pu (432.2 years vs. 87 years), {{it has been}} proposed as an active element of radioisotope thermoelectric generators, for example in spacecraft. Although americium produces less heat and electricity – the power yield is 114.7mW/g for 241Am and 6.31mW/g for 243Am (cf. 390mW/g for 238Pu) – and its radiation poses more threat to humans owing to neutron emission, <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> is considering using americium for its space probes.|$|E
5|$|At 4p.m. PDT on May 22, <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> and Italian Space Agency {{arranged}} for a call to Endeavour by Pope Benedict XVI. During his call—prompted by {{the discovery of a}} gash in the Shuttle's fuselage—the Pope extended his blessing to Kelly's wife, Gabrielle Giffords, who had undergone skull surgery earlier in the week. The event marked the first time a Pope spoke to astronauts {{during the course of a}} mission.|$|E

5|$|On 20 {{missions}} (1983–98) the Space Shuttle carried Spacelab, {{designed in}} cooperation with <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> (ESA). Spacelab was not designed for independent orbital flight, but remained in the Shuttle's cargo bay as the astronauts entered and left it through an airlock. Another famous series of missions were the launch and later successful repair of the Hubble Space Telescope in 1990 and 1993, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Several other Venus flybys {{took place}} in the 1980s and 1990s that {{increased}} the understanding of Venus, including Vega 1 (1985), Vega 2 (1985), Galileo (1990), Magellan (1994), Cassini–Huygens (1998), and MESSENGER (2006). Then, Venus Express by <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> (ESA) entered orbit around Venus in April 2006. Equipped with seven scientific instruments, Venus Express provided unprecedented long-term observation of Venus's atmosphere. ESA concluded that mission in December 2014.|$|E

5|$|The Cassini–Huygens {{spacecraft}} reached Saturn on July 1, 2004, {{and began}} the process of mapping Titan's surface by radar. A joint project of <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> (ESA) and NASA, Cassini–Huygens proved a very successful mission. The Cassini probe flew by Titan on October 26, 2004, and took the highest-resolution images ever of Titan's surface, at only , discerning patches {{of light and dark}} that would be invisible to the human eye.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} {{contract with}} ESRO lasted until 1 July 1974, when their low-Earth orbit program terminated. NTNF proposed closing Tromsø Telemetry Station as the remaining customers {{did not provide}} sufficient revenue to keep operations viable. Norway also declined to join <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> (ESA), which resulted in little hope in ESA choosing to cooperate with a Norwegian earth station. NTNF also looked into outright selling the station to ESA, but the offer was turned down. Kongsfjord Telemetry Station was closed in 1974.|$|E

5|$|India, Japan, China, the United States, and <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> each sent lunar orbiters, and {{especially}} ISRO's Chandrayaan-1 {{has contributed to}} confirming the discovery of lunar water ice in permanently shadowed craters at the poles and bound into the lunar regolith. The post-Apollo era has also seen two rover missions: the final Soviet Lunokhod mission in 1973, and China's ongoing Chang'e 3 mission, which deployed its Yutu rover on 14 December 2013. The Moon remains, under the Outer Space Treaty, free to all nations to explore for peaceful purposes.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of space travel gave scientists {{the opportunity to}} study the comet at close quarters, and several probes were launched to do so. The Soviet Vega 1 started returning images of Halley on 4 March 1986, and the first ever of its nucleus, and made its flyby on 6 March, followed by Vega 2 making its flyby on 9 March. On 14 March, the Giotto space probe, launched by <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency,</b> made the closest pass of the comet's nucleus. There were also two Japanese probes, Suisei and Sakigake. The probes were unofficially known as the Halley Armada.|$|E

5|$|The discoveries Cassini {{has made}} at Enceladus have {{prompted}} studies into follow-up mission concepts, including a flyby plume sample-return mission by NASA, a probe flyby (Journey to Enceladus and Titan or JET) to analyze plume contents in-situ, a lander by the German Aerospace Center {{to study the}} habitability potential of its subsurface ocean (Enceladus Explorer), and two astrobiology-oriented mission concepts (the Enceladus Life Finder and Life Investigation For Enceladus). <b>The</b> <b>European</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> (ESA) is also assessing concepts to send a probe to Enceladus in a mission to be combined with studies of Titan: TandEM (Titan and Enceladus Mission).|$|E
5|$|Customers {{with their}} own {{installations}} include the European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT), the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> (ESA) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). The station also reads and distributes data from the Japanese Hinode solar research satellite. The facility has seen a large increase in smaller customers after 2004, when the Svalbard Undersea Cable System started providing a fiber Internet connection. Concessions for downloading are only issued to civilian satellites, yet some data has been indirectly used by armed forces. There is a disagreement as to whether this constitutes a breach of the Svalbard Treaty.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} solar missions to date has been the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, jointly built by <b>the</b> <b>European</b> <b>Space</b> <b>Agency</b> and NASA and launched on 2 December 1995. Originally intended to serve a two-year mission, a mission extension through 2012 was approved in October 2009. It has proven so useful that a follow-on mission, the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), was launched in February 2010. Situated at the Lagrangian point between Earth and the Sun (at which the gravitational pull from both is equal), SOHO has provided a constant view of the Sun at many wavelengths since its launch. Besides its direct solar observation, SOHO has enabled the discovery {{of a large number of}} comets, mostly tiny sungrazing comets that incinerate as they pass the Sun.|$|E
