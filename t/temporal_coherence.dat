50|$|In optics, <b>temporal</b> <b>coherence</b> is {{measured}} in an interferometer such as the Michelson interferometer or Mach-Zehnder interferometer.

The resulting interference visibility (e.g. see Figure 4) gives the <b>temporal</b> <b>coherence</b> at delay τ. Since for most natural light sources, the coherence time is much shorter than the time resolution of any detector, the detector itself does the time averaging. Consider the example shown in Figure 3. At a fixed delay, here 2τc, an infinitely fast detector would measure an intensity that fluctuates significantly over a time t equal to τc.

50|$|<b>Temporal</b> <b>coherence</b> is {{the measure}} of the average {{correlation}} between the value of a wave and itself delayed by τ, at any pair of times. <b>Temporal</b> <b>coherence</b> tells us how monochromatic a source is.

The delay over which the phase or amplitude wanders by a significant amount (and hence the correlation decreases by significant amount) is defined as the coherence time τc. At a delay of τ=0 the degree of coherence is perfect, whereas it drops significantly as the delay passes τ=τc. The coherence length Lc is defined as the distance the wave travels in time τc.|$|E

5000|$|SLEDs are optical sources with {{a rather}} wide optical bandwidth. In that they differ from both lasers, {{that have a}} very narrow spectrum, and white light sources, that exhibit a much larger {{spectral}} width.

Some applications take advantage of the low <b>temporal</b> <b>coherence</b> of SLEDs sources to achieve high spatial resolution in imaging techniques. The coherence length, Lc, is a quantity frequently used to characterize the <b>temporal</b> <b>coherence</b> of the light source. It is related to the path difference between the two arms of an optical interferometer over which the light wave is still capable to generate an interference pattern.

40|$|As an {{important}} and challenging problem in computer vision and graphics, keypoint-based object tracking is typically formulated in a spatio-temporal statistical learning framework. However, most existing keypoint trackers are incapable of effectively modeling and balancing the following three aspects in a simultaneous manner: <b>temporal</b> model <b>coherence</b> across frames, spatial model consistency within frames, and discriminative feature construction. To address this issue, we propose a robust keypoint tracker based on spatio-temporal multi-task structured output optimization driven by discriminative metric learning. Consequently, <b>temporal</b> model <b>coherence</b> is characterized by multi-task structured keypoint model learning over several adjacent frames, while spatial model consistency is modeled by solving a geometric verification based structured learning problem. Discriminative feature construction is enabled by metric learning to ensure the intra-class compactness and inter-class separability. Finally, the above three modules are simultaneously optimized in a joint learning scheme. Experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of our tracker. Comment: Accepted by AAAI- 1...|$|R

40|$|Resting-state {{functional}} MRI (RS-fMRI) is {{a widely}} used method for inferring connectivity between brain regions or nodes. As with task-based fMRI, the spatial specificity of the connectivity maps can be distorted by the strong biasing effect of the BOLD signal in macroscopic veins. In RS-fMRI this effect is exacerbated by the <b>temporal</b> <b>coherences</b> of physiological origin between large veins that are widely distributed in the brain. In gradient echo based EPI, used {{for the vast majority}} of RS-fMRI, macroscopic veins that carry BOLD-related changes exhibit a strong phase response.

Here, we employ this approach to suppress macrovascular venous contributions in high-field whole-brain RS-fMRI data sets, resulting in significant changes to both the spatial localization of the networks and the correlations between the network nodes. These effects were observed at both the individual and group analysis level, suggesting that venous contamination is a confounding factor for RS-fMRI studies even at relatively low image resolutions.

50|$|The Michelson {{spectrograph}} {{is similar}} to the instrument used in the Michelson-Morley experiment. Light from the source is split into two beams by a half-silvered mirror, one is reflected off a fixed mirror and one off a movable mirror, which introduces a time delay—the Fourier-transform spectrometer is just a Michelson interferometer with a movable mirror. The beams interfere, allowing the <b>temporal</b> <b>coherence</b> of the light to be measured at each different time delay setting, effectively converting the time domain into a spatial coordinate. By making measurements of the signal at many discrete positions of the movable mirror, the spectrum can be reconstructed using a Fourier transform of the <b>temporal</b> <b>coherence</b> of the light. Michelson spectrographs are capable of very high spectral resolution observations of very bright sources.The Michelson or Fourier-transform spectrograph was popular for infra-red applications at a time when infra-red astronomy only had single-pixel detectors.
