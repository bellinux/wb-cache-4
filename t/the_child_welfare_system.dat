5|$|Despite {{the shift}} in policy from {{educational}} assimilation to integration, the removal of Indigenous children from their families by state officials continued {{through much of the}} 1960s and 70s. The removals were the result of the 1951 addition of Section 88 to the Indian Act, which allowed for the application of provincial laws to Indigenous peoples living on reserves in instances where federal laws were not in place. The change included the monitoring of child welfare. With no requirement for specialized training regarding the traditions or lifestyles of the communities they entered, provincial officials assessed the welfare of Indigenous children based on Euro-Canadian values that, for example, deemed traditional diets of game, fish and berries insufficient and grounds for taking children into custody. This period resulted in the widespread removal of Indigenous children from their traditional communities, first termed the Sixties Scoop by Patrick Johnston, the author of the 1983 report Native Children and <b>the</b> <b>Child</b> <b>Welfare</b> <b>System.</b> Often taken without the consent of their parents or community elders, some children were placed in state-run child welfare facilities, increasingly operated in former residential schools, while others were fostered or placed up for adoption by predominantly non-Indigenous families throughout Canada and the United States. While the Indian and Northern Affairs estimates that 11,132 children were adopted between 1960 and 1990, the actual number may be as high as 20,000.|$|E

40|$|The {{dissertation}} explores <b>the</b> Swedish <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> officer <b>system</b> (barnavårdsmannainstitutionen) using {{gender as}} an analytical tool. <b>The</b> <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> officer <b>system</b> {{was a public}} program designed to support single mothers and monitor <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> of <b>children</b> born out of wedlock. The study concentrates on {{the first half of}} the 20 th century, and particularly covers the introduction of this system in 1917 / 18 and the changes it underwent in 1938, after an income maintenance law (bidragsförskott) for children of unwed mothers was introduced. In 1917, Sweden was one of the first countries in Europe to introduce legislation that formalized men’s obligations towards children born out of wedlock. Consequently, state officials, called <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> officers, were required to perform mandatory investigations of paternity. Their task was also to make sure that fathers provided economic support and mothers carried out sufficient care. The 1938 income maintenance law was one of the social policy initiatives of the 1930 s. Single mothers were assured payment from <b>the</b> state for <b>child</b> support and <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> officers then sought to reclaim the money from the absent father. The history of <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> officer <b>system</b> is used as a case to investigate the power dynamics of gender and class, and the relationship between the state, the social work professionals and the individual citizen, concurrent with the birth of the Swedish welfare state. The political debates, the institutional arrangements and the practices connected to this policy area have been analyzed. Thus, politicians, social workers and unwed mothers and fathers are all brought into focus. An analytical point of departure is that the welfare state ”does gender”, i. e. that the welfare state regulates and directs the relation between men and women. However, the state is also treated as a complex and changeable entity, where state and welfare policy also functions as a means to change gender relations. Thus, the study argues that the introduction of <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> officer <b>system</b> opened up a new public arena for women – as politicians, social workers and as mothers – in which they were able to renegotiate the meaning of gender and their relation to the state. Prevalent ideas of gender were questioned and challenged in the public sphere of politics and labor as well as in the private sphere of the family. The study consists of a number of empirical chapters in which this social bureaucracy is scrutinized from various perspectives. <b>The</b> <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> officer <b>system</b> is analyzed both on a national and local level. The latter is done through a case study of the local work in Stockholm. Gender was a vital component to all these levels...|$|R

40|$|Introducing {{continental}} European {{approaches to}} UK <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> practice raises {{a problem of}} comparison: {{to what extent are}} the problems and issues similar to or different from one country compared to another. Social pedagogues trained in continental Europe and working in English residential care services often encountered the phrase ‘our young people are worse’ from their English colleagues, with the implication that the social pedagogic approach was not suitable for the client group. This paper examines two propositions: (1) that in the context of introducing the continental European approach of social pedagogy into children's residential care services in England, young people are ‘different’ in England compared to other European countries and (2) that the placement options and practices for young people living away from their birth parents in continental European countries differ from those in England. Using data from a five nation study of young people from public care backgrounds, the paper argues that while family backgrounds are remarkably similar there are marked differences in <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>systems</b> that might account for the perception that young people in care are ‘worse’ in England...|$|R
