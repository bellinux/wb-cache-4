40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we study}} <b>the</b> fuzzy <b>reasoning</b> {{based on a}} new fuzzy rough set. First, we define a broad family of new lower and upper {{approximation}} operators of fuzzy sets between different universes using a set of axioms. Then, based on the approximation operators above, we propose <b>the</b> fuzzy <b>reasoning</b> based on <b>the</b> new fuzzy rough set. By means of <b>the</b> above fuzzy <b>reasoning</b> based on <b>the</b> new fuzzy rough set, for a given premise, we can obtain <b>the</b> fuzzy <b>reasoning</b> consequence expressed by the fuzzy interval constructed by the above two approximations of fuzzy sets. Furthermore, through the defuzzification of the lower and upper approximations, {{we can get the}} corresponding two values constructing the interval used as <b>the</b> fuzzy <b>reasoning</b> consequence after defuzzification. Then, from the above interval, a suitable value can be selected as <b>the</b> final <b>reasoning</b> consequence so that some special constraints are satisfied as possibly. At last, we apply <b>the</b> fuzzy <b>reasoning</b> based on <b>the</b> new fuzzy rough set to the scheduling problems, and numerical computational results show that <b>the</b> fuzzy <b>reasoning</b> based on <b>the</b> new fuzzy rough set is more suitable for the scheduling problems compared with <b>the</b> fuzzy <b>reasoning</b> based on <b>the</b> CRI method and the III method...|$|R

5|$|Although {{the first}} two Uranian moons were {{discovered}} in 1787, they were not named until 1852, a year after two more moons had been discovered. The responsibility for naming was taken by John Herschel, son of the discoverer of Uranus. Herschel, instead of assigning names from Greek mythology, named the moons after magical spirits in English literature: the fairies Oberon and Titania from William Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, and the sylphs Ariel and Umbriel from Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock (Ariel is also a sprite in Shakespeare's The Tempest). <b>The</b> <b>reasoning</b> was presumably that Uranus, as god {{of the sky and}} air, would be attended by spirits of the air.|$|E
5|$|Aurion {{takes its}} doors, windows, roof panels, body sides (except front quarters) from the Camry XV40. However, the other panels are unique {{from the regular}} Camry. This {{component}} sharing also means that Aurion has the same wheelbase, front and rear axle tracks, and interior dimensions. Interior design also largely parallels the Camry. Notable differences include the redesigned upper dashboard portion and restyled centre console, plus the substitution of the Australian Camry's hand-operated parking brake with a foot-operated equivalent (as shared with the Camry for Japan and North America). <b>The</b> <b>reasoning</b> behind this component sharing strategy was to reduce costs and to allow the car to be built alongside the Camry, thus simplifying the manufacturing process.|$|E
5|$|Finally in 1859, Marx {{published}} A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, {{his first}} serious economic work.

In A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, Marx accepts the labour theory of value as advocated by David Ricardo, but whereas Ricardo drew a distinction between use value and value in commodities, Ricardo always {{had been unable to}} define the real relationship between use value and value. <b>The</b> <b>reasoning</b> Marx laid out in his book clearly delineated the true relationship between use value and value. He also produced a truly scientific theory of money and money circulation in the capitalist economy, thus A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy created a storm of enthusiasm when it appeared in public and the entire edition of the book was sold out quickly.|$|E

40|$|Deontic {{reasoning}} {{has been}} studied in two subfields of psychology: the cognitive and moral reasoning literatures.

5|$|Following Nixon, the Democratic Party's state {{convention}} {{instituted a}} rule that only whites could vote in its primary elections; the Court unanimously upheld this rule as constitutional in Grovey v.

Classic (1941), the Court ruled that primary elections were {{an essential part of the}} electoral process, undermining <b>the</b> <b>reasoning</b> in Grovey. Based on Classic, the Court in Smith v. Allwright (1944), overruled Grovey, ruling that denying non-white voters a ballot in primary elections was a violation of the Fifteenth Amendment. In the last of the Texas primary cases, Terry v. Adams (1953), the Court ruled that black plaintiffs were entitled to damages from a group that organized whites-only pre-primary elections with the assistance of Democratic party officials.|$|E

Smith was a notoriously reticent and shy individual that only granted one interview during his lifetime, in which he relayed only information pertaining to racing matters. Consequently, much of the published biographical information on Pittsburgh Phil's early life, his rise to fame and <b>the</b> <b>reasoning</b> behind his methods on the track comes from interviews with his nephew, James McGill, who was a close confidant in the ten years preceding George Smith's death.|$|E

5|$|In 1173, Saladin sent Turan-Shah {{to conquer}} Yemen and the Hejaz. Muslim writers Ibn al-Athir and later al-Maqrizi wrote that <b>the</b> <b>reasoning</b> behind {{the conquest of}} Yemen was an Ayyubid fear that should Egypt fall to Nur al-Din, they could seek refuge in a faraway territory. In May 1174, Turan-Shah conquered Zabid from a Kharijite dynasty and {{executed}} its leader Mahdi Abd al-Nabi, and later that year Aden {{was taken from the}} Shia Banu Karam tribe. Aden became the principal maritime port of the dynasty in the Indian Ocean and the principal city of Yemen, although the official capital of Ayyubid Yemen was Ta'iz. The advent of the Ayyubids marked the beginning of a period of renewed prosperity in the city which saw the improvement of its commercial infrastructure, the establishment of new institutions, and the minting of its own coins. Following this prosperity, the Ayyubids implemented a new tax which was collected by galleys.|$|E
5|$|In 1392, King Richard II of England {{created the}} first in a {{succession}} of Ireland kings of arms. It is unknown why such an office was called into being. Froissart notes the creation of Chandos le Roy d'Ireland, but does not give any clues as to <b>the</b> <b>reasoning.</b> It does, however, fit into the general English policy in Ireland at the time. Richard II sought to re-establish English control in those areas where the native Irish had reasserted their independence. The appointment {{can be seen as a}} necessary part of the preparations for the appointment of the Duke of Gloucester as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1392. Richard intended Gloucester to lead a major military campaign, and such a campaign would have necessitated the involvement of heralds to marshal arms and provide advice and evidence in case of heraldic disputes.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, the {{outbreak}} of the Korean War and Britain's heavy involvement in this conflict led to a flurry of orders being issued; the need for capable modern interceptors was felt to be so pressing that the RAF was willing to consider accepting interim fighter aircraft while more capable fighters would continue to be pursued. In particular, the RAF felt that a pair of proposed fighter aircraft from Hawker Aircraft and Supermarine were of high importance and thus placed orders for these proposed fighters 'off the drawing board' in 1950. <b>The</b> <b>reasoning</b> behind these two aircraft being ordered in 1950 was intended to serve as an insurance policy in the event of either one of these projects failing to produce a viable aircraft; these two aircraft would later become known as the Supermarine Swift and the Hawker Hunter respectively.|$|E
