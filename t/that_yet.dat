5|$|Meanwhile, a young {{traveller}} named Bartz, {{resting in}} the woods near Tycoon, witnesses a meteorite plunge to the planet's surface just outside the castle. Bartz promptly investigates, discovering Lenna lying unconscious from attack. After rescuing her, they discover {{an old man in}} the debris with partial amnesia named Galuf. Lenna explains that she had been {{on her way to the}} Wind Shrine after her father. Galuf suddenly recalls that it was his original destination as well, opting to accompany her. Though the trio part ways, Bartz soon encounters Lenna and Galuf again assaulted by monsters in a quaking valley. The three travel together, finding all land routes blockaded by the upheavals caused by the meteorite's fall. Exploring an underground cavern, they encounter a den of pirates and their leader, Faris. With the help of the pirate captain, the group makes its way to the Wind Shrine to discover the shattered Crystal, but no sign of the missing king. The shards react to their presence, however, and an image of Tycoon appears, explaining to them that they must protect those Crystals <b>that</b> <b>yet</b> remain.|$|E

5|$|The U.K. {{government}} attempted several {{measures to}} revive the London foreign exchange market, the most notable of which were implemented on September 5 to extend the previous moratorium through October and allow the Bank of England to temporarily loan funds to be paid back upon {{the end of the}} war in an effort to settle outstanding or unpaid acceptances for currency transactions. By mid-October, the London market began functioning properly as a result of the September measures. The war continued to present unfavorable circumstances for the foreign exchange market, such as the London Stock Exchange's prolonged closure, the redirection of economic resources to support a transition from producing exports to producing military armaments, and myriad disruptions of freight and mail. The pound sterling enjoyed general stability throughout World War I, in large part due to various steps taken by the U.K. government to influence the pound's value in ways <b>that</b> <b>yet</b> provided individuals with the freedom to continue trading currencies. Such measures included open market interventions on foreign exchange, borrowing in foreign currencies rather than in pounds sterling to finance war activities, outbound capital controls, and limited import restrictions.|$|E
5|$|Andriamampandry {{tried on}} several {{occasions}} to warn Andriamasinavalona {{of the danger of}} administering the kingdom in this way. In one instance, he placed a hen {{in the middle of a}} room, then set one red rooster free in each corner. The roosters attacked one another viciously, leaving the king speechless. On another day, the elder brought four eagles to the king in a basket. When the basket was opened, the eagles flew wildly about the room, creating havoc. Andriamampandry warned the king that his realm would be no better off once his four sons got a taste of power. Andriamasinavalona recognized the danger but could not bear to choose which among his sons should be excluded from having a part in the decision-making responsibilities of the kingdom, so ignored the elder's advice. Finally Andriamampandry decided to give the king a very explicit warning. Andriamasinavalona had gathered his people in Andohalo to give a speech, when Andriamampandry set a bull loose into the crowd. In the panic that ensued, numerous people were gored or trampled to death, several pregnant women miscarried, and the gathering dispersed in chaos. The king demanded to know who had loosed the bull so that he may be executed, but when Andriamampandry took responsibility he warned the king <b>that</b> <b>yet</b> more blood would be spilled before the earth would be quenched. He then criticized the king for his concern over the relatively few deaths at the gathering, in light of the number of people who would die as a consequence of his division of Imerina. He further predicted that the prince at Ambohimanga would unite Imerina and lead it back to greatness. Andriamasinavalona reportedly had no response to give Andriamampandry, but instead hung his head in shame.|$|E

This was challenged unsuccessfully to An Bord Pleanála, however subsequently no funding arrived from government, and the planning permission was allowed to lapse.

25|$|After his Kansas convictions, Robinson faced {{additional}} {{murder charges}} in Missouri, {{based on the}} evidence discovered in that state. Missouri is far more aggressive in its pursuit of capital punishment convictions, and Robinson's attorneys were anxious to avoid a trial there. (Kansas has not executed anyone since reinstating its death penalty statute in 1994.) Chris Koster, the Missouri prosecutor, insisted as a condition of any plea bargain that Robinson lead authorities to the bodies of Lisa Stasi, Paula Godfrey and Catherine Clampitt. Robinson, who has never cooperated in any way with investigators, refused; but Koster still faced pressure to make a deal because his case was not technically airtight. (Among other issues, there was no unequivocal evidence that any of the murders had actually been committed within his jurisdiction.) Robinson, on the other hand, faced pressure to plead guilty to avoid an almost certain death sentence in Missouri, and failing <b>that,</b> <b>yet</b> another capital murder trial back in Kansas.|$|E

25|$|Parma's dismal winless run {{extended}} to 8 games as {{they lost to}} Napoli by three goals to one. Parma opened the scoring through Raffaele Palladino, but Napoli hit back with three goals in a second half <b>that</b> <b>yet</b> again saw a Parma player sent off; {{this time it was}} Daniele Galloppa. Parma finally ended their winless streak and boosted their survival chances on 20 March 2011, overcoming fellow relegaton battlers Sampdoria with a solitary goal midway through the second half. The following week, a 2–1 defeat at home to Bari in a match that Parma dominated was enough to see head coach Pasquale Marino lose his job with Parma two points clear of the relegation zone. He was replaced by Franco Colomba, who was signed on a 14-month deal and had been out of a job since the previous summer, two days later. Colomba's first match in charge, a tricky trip to Rome to face Champions League qualification-chasing Lazio ended in defeat by two goals to nil, a goal coming in each half. On 16 April, national and continental and world champions Internazionale paid a visit to the Tardini, as Parma recorded a historic two-goal victory with goals from Juventus loanees Giovinco and Amauri. The next week, a second consecutive 2–0 win – their first in Udine since 2001 – over ten-man Udinese thanks to two Amauri goals boosted Parma's chances of salvation, but other relegation candidates' result meant the club remained just three points clear of the relegation zone. Parma faced Europe-chasing Palermo on 1 May and recorded yet another win at home. Two early first-half goals saw Parma lead 2–0 before a second half Palermo goal put Parma on edge. Two minutes from time, Antonio Candreva restored Parma's two-goal lead and confirmed Parma's first three-game winning streak of the season. Six points clear of the relegation zone with just three games remaining, Parma looked to have secured their participation in Serie A for the following season. Parma then travelled to meet Bologna in the Emilian Derby the following weekend, with both sides knowing that three points would secure their Serie A status for the season to come. The match ended goalless and results in other matches meant that relegation could not be ruled out at the final whistle, but a late goal in a later game saw Genoa defeat Sampdoria in the Derby della Lanterna, confirming Parma's place in next year's Serie A. Parma celebrated their safety in style in the Stadio Ennio Tardini the week after with a win over injury-hit bitterest rivals Juventus, the only goal of the game coming from the man on loan from Juventus, Sebastian Giovinco, who had scored two goals in the reverse fixture and secured Colomba's fourth win in six games. The season ended in a low-key affair away to Cagliari. Valeri Bojinov opened the scoring for Parma before a Rolf Feltscher own goal levelled the scoreline, as Parma finished the league season in twelfth position.|$|E
