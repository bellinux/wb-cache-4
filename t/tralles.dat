5|$|After the Nika Revolt {{destroyed}} much of {{the city}} of Constantinople in 532, including the churches of Hagia Sophia ("Holy Wisdom") and Hagia Irene ("Holy Peace"), Justinian had the opportunity to rebuild. Both had been basilica plan churches and both were rebuilt as domed basilicas, although the Hagia Sophia was rebuilt on a much grander scale. Built by Anthemius of <b>Tralles</b> and Isidore of Miletus in Constantinople between 532 and 537, the Hagia Sophia has been called the greatest building in the world. It is an original and innovative design with no known precedents in the way it covers a basilica plan with dome and semi-domes. Periodic earthquakes in the region have caused three partial collapses of the dome and necessitated repairs. The precise shape of the original central dome completed in 537 was significantly different from the current one and, according to contemporary accounts, much bolder.|$|E
5|$|Although polytheism {{had been}} {{suppressed}} {{by the state}} {{since at least the}} time of Constantine in the 4th century, traditional Greco-Roman culture was still influential in the Eastern empire in the 6th century. Philosophers such as John Philoponus drew on neoplatonic ideas in addition to Christian thought and empiricism. Nevertheless, Hellenistic philosophy began to be gradually supplanted by or amalgamated into newer Christian philosophy. The closure of the Platonic Academy in 529 was a notable turning point. Hymns written by Romanos the Melodist marked the development of the Divine Liturgy, while the architects Isidore of Miletus and Anthemius of <b>Tralles</b> worked to complete the new Church of the Holy Wisdom, Hagia Sophia, which was designed to replace an older church destroyed during the Nika Revolt. Completed in 537, the Hagia Sophia stands today as one of the major monuments of Byzantine architectural history. During the 6th and 7th centuries, the Empire was struck by a series of epidemics, which greatly devastated the population and contributed to a significant economic decline and a weakening of the Empire.|$|E

Potential shape reconstructed in this way can be substituted then by some approximation, so that the output spectrum obtained by solving the Schrödinger equa-tion with such approximated potential, differs only slightly from the input one.

40|$|Topology of {{symplectic}} manifolds is nowadays {{a subject}} of intensive development. The simplest examples of such manifolds are Kähler manifolds and an important property of the latter is their formality. Thus, a possible way of constructing symplectic manifolds with no Kähler structure is to find such ones which are not formal. M. Fernández und V. Muñoz considered in this decade {{the question of the}} geography of non-formal compact manifolds. Given a positive integer m and a natural number b, they showed whether or not there are m-dimensional non-formal compact manifolds with first Betti number b. The aim of this thesis is to answer the same question for compact symplectic manifolds. After setting the scene in the first chapter, this is done in the second one - except for the six-dimensional case with b = 1. The third chapter deals with solvmanifolds, especially with those of dimension {{less than or equal to}} six, because I hoped to find the missing example among them, and in fact there is a six-dimensional symplectic solvmanifolds which is non-formal and satisfies b = 1. Besides formality, compact Kähler manifolds have even odd-degree Betti numbers and they satisfy the so-called Hard Lefschetz condition. To end Chapter 3, I deal with relations between this three properties for symplectic solvmanifolds. I am able to give an answer to two questions that had remained open in an article of R. Ibáñez, Y. Rudiak, A. <b>Tralle</b> and L. Ugarte. Furthermore, in the last chapter I prove a result that allows an easy computation of the higher homotopy groups of a class of spaces containing all nilpotent ones. Without giving a proof, St. Halperin stated it in the introduction of his book Lectures on Minimal Model...|$|R
40|$|This {{volume is}} a {{follow-up}} to the INdAM workshop "New perspectives in differen- tial geometry" that took place on 16 - 20 November 2015 : [URL] The editors are deeply grateful to the Istituto Nazionale di Alta Matematica "Francesco Severi" (INdAM) for generously sponsoring and hosting the event in Rome, and to the Institute's President, Giorgio Patrizio, for his steadfast support. We are indebted to Diego Conti and Caterina Stoppato for the invaluable hard work in organising the workshop, and to Graziano Gentili and Andrew Swann for playing a key role on the scientific committee. We {{would also like to}} thank wholeheartedly the conference speakers: Ilka Agricola, Adrián Andrada, Vestislav Apostolov, John Armstrong, Fiammetta Battaglia, Roger Bielawski, Fran Burstall, Vicente Cortés, Johann Davidov, Paul Gauduchon, Marisa Fernández, Nigel Hitchin, Claude LeBrun, Thomas Madsen, Stefano Marchiafava, Vicente Muñoz, Paolo Piccinni, Uwe Semmelmann and Luis Ugarte. On the occasion of the workshop we celebrated the 60 th birthday of Simon Salamon, a worldwide leading scholar at the forefront of research in differential geometry whose extensive body of work centres around Riemannian and com- plex manifolds defined with reference to the action of a Lie group. The unique contributions appearing in this book focus on a variety of cutting-edge topics revolving around Salamon's interests: quaternionic and octonionic geometry, twistor spaces, almost-complex manifolds, harmonic maps, exceptional holonomy, Einstein metrics, spinors, homogeneous spaces and nilmanifolds, special geometries in dimensions 5, 6, 7 and 8, conformal geometry, moduli spaces, gauge theory, 4 - manifolds, symplectic manifolds and integrable systems. Simon Salamon is Professor of Geometry at King's College, London, and previously worked at Politecnico di Torino, Imperial College and Oxford University. The workshop was widely attended by his colleagues, friends and former students from all over the world, and this volume represents both a fitting tribute to a trailblazing force in the field and a compelling testimony to the profound and longstanding impact that Salamon has on the mathematical community. Heartfelt thanks go to the authors who accepted the invitation to publish here: Fiammetta Battaglia, Giovanni Bazzoni, Indranil Biswas, Fran Burstall, Vicente Cortés, Andrew Dancer, Johann Davidov, Malte Dyckmanns, Marisa Fernández, Paul Gauduchon, Claude LeBrun, Andrea Loi, Jason Lotay, Thomas Madsen, Andrei Moroianu, Vicente Muñoz, Antonio Otal, Paolo Piccinni, Simon Salamon, Stefan Suhr, Andrew Swann, Aleksy <b>Tralle,</b> Luis Ugarte, Raquel Villacampa, Dan Zaffran and Fabio Zuddas.

25|$|In the 6th century, the Byzantine-Greek {{mathematician}} and architect Anthemius of <b>Tralles</b> (most {{famous as}} co-architect of the Hagia Sophia), experimented with effects {{related to the}} camera obscura. Anthemius had a sophisticated understanding of the involved optics, as demonstrated by a light-ray diagram he constructed in 555 CE.|$|E
25|$|Anthemius of <b>Tralles</b> (ca. 474 – ca. 534), a {{professor}} of geometry and architecture, authored many influential works on mathematics {{and was one of}} the architects of the famed Hagia Sophia, the largest building in the world at its time. His works were among the most important source texts in the Arab world and Western Europe for centuries after.|$|E
25|$|In ancient Greek sources, {{the name}} of the city is given as Anthea and Euanthia. During the Seleucid period, it {{received}} the name Antiochia (Greek: Αντιόχεια). At other times it was also called Seleucia ad Maeandrum and Erynina. In Roman and Byzantine times, it was known as <b>Tralles</b> (in Latin) or Tralleis (Τραλλεῖς in Ancient Greek), {{and was one of the}} largest Aegean cities in antiquity.|$|E
25|$|Byzantine {{scientists}} {{preserved and}} continued {{the legacy of}} the great Ancient Greek mathematicians and put mathematics in practice. In early Byzantium (5th to 7th century) the architects and mathematicians Isidore of Miletus and Anthemius of <b>Tralles</b> used complex mathematical formulas to construct the great “Hagia Sophia” temple, a magnificent technological breakthrough for its time and for centuries afterwards due to its striking geometry, bold design and height. In late Byzantium (9th to 12th century) mathematicians like Michael Psellos considered mathematics as a way to interpret the world.|$|E
25|$|Phlegon of <b>Tralles</b> {{said he was}} invoked to {{ward off}} ghosts, and Pseudo-Apollodorus {{reported}} several events involving Hermes. He participated in the Gigantomachy in defense of Olympus; was given the task of bringing baby Dionysus {{to be cared for}} by Ino and Athamas and later by nymphs of Asia, followed Hera, Athena and Aphrodite in a beauty contest; favored the young Hercules by giving him a sword when he finished his education and lent his sandals to Perseus. The Thracian princes identified him with their god Zalmoxis, considering his ancestor.|$|E
25|$|Macrobius relates that Janus was {{supposed}} to have shared a kingdom with Camese in Latium, in a place then named Camesene. He states that Hyginus recorded the tale on the authority of a Protarchus of <b>Tralles.</b> In Macrobius Camese is a male: after Camese's death Janus reigned alone. However Greek authors make of Camese Janus's sister and spouse: Atheneus citing a certain Drakon of Corcyra writes that Janus fathered with his sister Camese a son named Aithex and a daughter named Olistene. Servius Danielis states Tiber (i.e., Tiberinus) was their son.|$|E
25|$|Another Byzantine treatise, that of {{the thirteenth}} century doctor Nicholas Myrepsos, {{remained}} the principal pharmaceutical code of the Parisian medical faculty until 1651, while the Byzantine tract of Demetrios Pepagomenos (thirteenth century) on gout was translated and published in Latin by the post-Byzantine humanist Marcus Musurus, in Venice in 1517. Therefore, {{it could be argued}} that previous misrepresentations about Byzantium being simply a 'carrier' of Ancient Medical knowledge to the Renaissance are wrong. It is known, for example, that the late twelfth-century Italian physician (Roger of Salerno) was influenced by the treatises of the Byzantine doctors Aëtius and Alexander of <b>Tralles</b> as well as Paul of Aegina.|$|E
25|$|Photography is {{the result}} of {{combining}} several technical discoveries. Long before the first photographs were made, ancient Han Chinese philosopher Mo Di from the Mohist School of Logic was the first to discover and develop the scientific principles of optics, camera obscura, and pinhole camera. Later Greek mathematicians Aristotle and Euclid also independently described a pinhole camera in the 5th and 4th centuries BCE. In the 6th century CE, Byzantine mathematician Anthemius of <b>Tralles</b> used a type of camera obscura in his experiments. Both the Han Chinese polymath Shen Kuo (1031–95) and Arab physicist Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen) (965–1040) independently invented the camera obscura and pinhole camera, Albertus Magnus (1193–1280) discovered silver nitrate, and Georg Fabricius (1516–71) discovered silver chloride. Shen Kuo explains the science of camera obscura and optical physics in his scientific work Dream Pool Essays while the techniques described in Ibn al-Haytham's Book of Optics are capable of producing primitive photographs using medieval materials.|$|E
25|$|In {{anticipation}} of the battle, Antiochus set up an entrenched camp protecting the approach to Sardis and his fleet base at Ephesus. According to both Livy and Appian, he posted his 16,000 strong phalanx, armed in the Macedonian fashion in the center in brigades (taxeis) of 1,600 men, 50 men wide and 32 men deep. He ordered intervals to be formed among the taxeis in which he placed 2 elephants each. On the right wing, next to the phalanx, he arrayed 1,500 Gallograecian infantry, 3,000 Galatian mail clad cavalry (cataphracti) and 1,000 agema cavalry, his royal household guards. Behind them he kept 16 elephants in reserve. Next to the agema, he placed a cavalry corps Livy calls argyraspides, 200 or 1,200 Dahae horse archers, 3,000 Cretan and Trallean light infantry, 2,500 Mysian bowmen, Cyrtian slingers and Elymaean archers. On the left, Antiochus arrayed another 1,500 Gallograecian infantry, according to Appian men from the tribes of the Tectosagi, the Trocmi and the Tolistoboii, 2,000 Cappadocians similarly armed and a miscellaneous force of 2,700. Next to them, he posted 1,000 heavy horsemen, the Companions, 3,000 more cataphracti and probably another 1,000 men of the agema. In front of them, he placed the scythed chariots and a unit of dromedary, camel-borne Arab archers. His left wing was completed with a corps of Tarentines, 2,500 Gallograecian cavalry, 1,000 newly enlisted Cretans, 1,500 Carians and Cilicians similarly armed, and {{the same number of}} <b>Tralles.</b> Then came 4,000 peltasts, Pisidians, Pamphylians and Lydians, next to these Cyrtian and Elymaean troops equal in number to those on the right wing, and finally sixteen elephants a short distance away. Antiochus retained command of the horse on the right wing in person; his son Seleucus and his nephew Antipater commanded the left. Philip, the master of the elephants, commanded the phalanx, and Mendis and Zeuxis the skirmishers.|$|E
500|$|The 2nd century AD author Lucian {{wrote that}} during the Siege of Syracuse (c. 214–212BC), Archimedes {{destroyed}} enemy ships with fire. Centuries later, Anthemius of <b>Tralles</b> mentions burning-glasses as Archimedes' weapon. The device, sometimes called the [...] "Archimedes heat ray", was used to focus sunlight onto approaching ships, causing them to catch fire. In the modern era, similar devices have been constructed and may {{be referred to as}} a heliostat or solar furnace.|$|E
500|$|Until the Enlightenment era, {{the crucifixion}} {{darkness}} story was often used by Christian apologists {{because they believed}} {{it was a rare}} example of the biblical account being supported by non-Christian sources. When the pagan critic Celsus claimed that Jesus could hardly be a God because he had performed no great deeds, [...] the third-century Christian commentator Origen responded, in Against Celsus, by recounting the darkness, earthquake and opening of tombs. As proof that the incident had happened, he referred to a description by Phlegon of <b>Tralles</b> of an eclipse, accompanied by earthquakes felt {{in other parts of the}} Empire during the reign of Tiberius (probably that of 29 CE).|$|E
500|$|Justinian was a {{prolific}} builder; the historian Procopius bears witness to his activities in this area. Under Justinian's patronage the San Vitale in Ravenna, which features two famous mosaics representing Justinian and Theodora, was completed. Most notably, {{he had the}} Hagia Sophia, originally a basilica-style church that had been burnt down during the Nika riots, splendidly rebuilt according to a completely different ground plan, under the architectural supervision of Isidore of Miletus and Anthemius of <b>Tralles.</b> According to Procopius, Justinian stated {{at the completion of}} this edifice, [...] "Solomon I have outdone thee" [...] (in reference to the 1st Jewish temple).

2500|$|An early bishop Polybius (fl. ca. 105) is attested by {{a letter}} from Saint Ignatius of Antioch to the church at <b>Tralles.</b> The city was officially Christianized, {{along with the rest}} of Caria, early after the {{conversion}} of Constantine, at which time the see was confirmed. Among the recorded bishops are: Heracleon (431), Maximus (451), Uranius (553), Myron (692), Theophylactus (787), Theophanes and Theopistus both ninth century, and John (1230). The Catholic Church includes this bishopric in its list of [...] titular sees as <b>Tralles</b> in Asia, distinguishing it from the see of <b>Tralles</b> in Lydia.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to surgery, pharmaceuticals {{were also a}} common way to cure sickness. Alexander of <b>Tralles</b> wrote of over six hundred drugs {{that he used to}} try and cure illnesses.

2500|$|According to Strabo <b>Tralles</b> {{was founded}} by the Argives and Trallians. Along {{with the rest of}} Lydia, the city fell to the Persian Empire. After its success against Athens in the Peloponnesian War, Sparta unsuccessfully sought to take the city from the Persians, but in 334 BC, <b>Tralles</b> {{surrendered}} to Alexander the Great without resistance and therefore was not sacked. Alexander's general Antigonus held the city from 313 to 301 BC and later the Seleucids held the city until 190 BC when it fell to Pergamon. From 133 to 129 BC, the city supported Aristonicus of Pergamon, a pretender to the Pergamene throne, against the Romans. [...] After the Romans defeated him, they revoked the city's right to mint coins.|$|E

2500|$|Construction of the {{new church}} began shortly before that of Hagia Sophia, built from 532 to 537.

However, the building is quite different in architectural detail from the Hagia Sophia and the notion that it was but a small-scale version has largely been discredited.|$|E
2500|$|Fires {{started by}} the Nika rioters {{consumed}} Constantine's basilica of Hagia Sophia (Holy Wisdom), the city's principal church, which lay {{to the north of}} the Augustaeum. Justinian commissioned Anthemius of <b>Tralles</b> and Isidore of Miletus to replace it with a new and incomparable Hagia Sophia. This was the great cathedral of the Orthodox Church, whose dome was said to be held aloft by God alone, and which was directly connected to the palace so that the imperial family could attend services without passing through the streets. The dedication took place on 26 December 537 in the presence of the emperor, who exclaimed, [...] "O Solomon, I have outdone thee!"
