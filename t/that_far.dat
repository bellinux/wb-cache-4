5|$|As {{the team}} with the best regular season record, the Presidents' Trophy winner is {{guaranteed}} home-ice advantage in all four rounds of the Stanley Cup playoffs, provided they advance <b>that</b> <b>far.</b> However, it does not guarantee that success; only eight of these winners have gone on to win the Stanley Cup. Three other teams reached the Stanley Cup Finals, but failed to win. The last team to win both the Presidents' Trophy and the Stanley Cup in the same season was the 2012–13 Chicago Blackhawks. The only team to accomplish this more than once is the Detroit Red Wings.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} President Reagan {{had given his}} first speech on the epidemic, some six years into his presidency, 36,058 Americans had been {{diagnosed}} with AIDS and 20,849 had died of it. By the end of 1989, the year Reagan left office, 115,786 people {{had been diagnosed with}} AIDS in the United States, and more than 70,000 of them had died of it. It has been suggested <b>that</b> <b>far</b> fewer would have died, both then and in the decades that followed, if the Reagan administration had applied the same determination in combatting AIDS as the Ford administration had applied to fighting Legionnaires' disease.|$|E

5|$|Mike Brown {{counters}} {{these claims}} by saying <b>that,</b> <b>far</b> from not having cleared their orbits, the major planets completely control {{the orbits of}} the other bodies within their orbital zone. Jupiter may coexist {{with a large number}} of small bodies in its orbit (the Trojan asteroids), but these bodies only exist in Jupiter's orbit because they are in the sway of the planet's huge gravity. Similarly, Pluto may cross the orbit of Neptune, but Neptune long ago locked Pluto and its attendant Kuiper belt objects, called plutinos, into a 3:2 resonance, i.e., they orbit the Sun twice for every three Neptune orbits. The orbits of these objects are entirely dictated by Neptune's gravity, and thus, Neptune is gravitationally dominant.|$|E
5|$|Ruth soon {{realized}} that Fuchs had deceived him, and {{had no intention of}} making him manager or giving him any significant off-field duties.

As it turned out, both Fuchs and Ruppert had known all along that Ruth's non-playing positions were meaningless.|$|E
5|$|The Belgians and French {{remained}} {{confused about}} {{what was expected of}} each other if or when, hostilities commenced. The Belgians were determined to hold the border fortifications along the Albert Canal and the Meuse, without withdrawing, until the French Army arrived to support them. Gamelin was not keen on pushing his Dyle plan <b>that</b> <b>far.</b> He was concerned that the Belgians would be driven out of their defences and would retreat to Antwerp, as in 1914. In fact, the Belgian divisions protecting the border were to withdraw and retreat southward to link up with French forces. This information was not given to Gamelin.|$|E

5|$|The Presidents' Trophy {{winner is}} {{guaranteed}} home-ice advantage {{in all four}} rounds of the Stanley Cup playoffs, provided the team advances <b>that</b> <b>far.</b> However, it does not guarantee that success, as only eight of all the Presidents' Trophy winners {{have gone on to}} win the Stanley Cup in their respective years, leading to a popular superstition that the Trophy may be cursed. In addition, six Presidents' Trophy winners have been eliminated in the preliminary round of the playoffs, with first-round upsets being common in the NHL compared to other major professional sports.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, in 1962, {{the club}} won the Southern League {{title for the}} second {{successive}} season and {{was elected to the}} Football League Fourth Division, occupying the vacant place left by bankrupt Accrington Stanley. Two successive eighteenth-place finishes followed, before promotion to the Third Division was achieved in 1965. A year before the promotion, Oxford became the first Fourth Division club to reach the sixth round of the FA Cup, but have not progressed <b>that</b> <b>far</b> in the competition since. Oxford won the Third Division title in 1967–68, their sixth season as a league club, but after eight years of relative stability the club was relegated from the Second Division in 1975–76.|$|E
5|$|After {{defeating}} the Hyksos, Ahmose began campaigning in Syria and Nubia. A campaign during his 22nd year reached Djahy in the Levant and perhaps {{as far as}} the Euphrates, although the later Pharaoh Thutmose I is usually credited with being the first to campaign <b>that</b> <b>far.</b> Ahmose did, however, reach {{at least as far as}} Kedem (thought to be near Byblos), according to an ostracon in the tomb of his wife, Ahmose-Nefertari. Details on this particular campaign are scarce, as the source of most of the information, Ahmose, son of Ebana, served in the Egyptian navy and did not take part in this land expedition. However, it can be inferred from archaeological surveys of southern Canaan that during the late 16th century BC Ahmose and his immediate successors intended only to break the power of the Hyksos by destroying their cities and not to conquer Canaan. Many sites there were completely laid waste and not rebuilt during this period—something a Pharaoh bent on conquest and tribute would not be likely to do.|$|E

5|$|As the Cardiff team bus {{arrived at}} the stadium, the fans threw leeks at the vehicle. The team had adopted a black cat for the occasion, which Ferguson had found {{wandering}} astray prior to their earlier match with Bolton and decided {{it was a good}} omen. He found the owners of the animal, who agreed to let the club keep the cat in return for two final tickets if they progressed <b>that</b> <b>far.</b> Police reinforcements were required at Empire Stadium, as at 1pm {{a large number of people}} had gathered outside the ticket office in a threatening manner. A large number of fake tickets had been sold to members of the crowd, and the stewards were refusing to allow them entry.|$|E
5|$|Evolves environments {{are based}} on Earth's as the design team {{wanted to create a}} world that felt {{believable}} for players and had regions that made geological sense after an early concept design was found to be too extreme. As a result, the design team drew inspiration from real-world landscapes. The design team wanted Evolve to be set in lush forests so that Hunters and Monsters could hide from each other. The design team tried using the Source game engine to create a forest landscape but they ultimately failed. The design team then researched Crytek's CryEngine, which powers games like Far Cry and Crysis. As the design team felt <b>that</b> <b>Far</b> Cry and Crysis set new standards for in-game environments, they decided to utilize CryEngine for Evolve. Evolves maps were designed to be dark and mysterious, so that the various characters can hide from each other, as well as presenting a sense of surprise when players are ambushed.|$|E
5|$|General Carleton {{arrived in}} Trois-Rivières {{late in the}} action. A {{detachment}} of British forces led by Major Grant had taken control of a bridge over the Rivière-du-Loup, a critical crossing for the Americans retreating along {{the north shore of}} the Saint Lawrence. Carleton ordered Grant to withdraw, allowing most of the Americans to escape, either because {{he did not want to}} deal with large numbers of prisoners or because he wanted to demoralize the Americans further. A significant number of Americans did not make it <b>that</b> <b>far,</b> and were captured. These included General Thompson and seventeen of his officers. It was not until June 13 that the British finished rounding up the stragglers. In all, 236 captives were taken. Brendan Morrissey says that about 30 Americans were killed in the battle, while Howard Peckham gives a figure of 50 Americans killed.|$|E

5|$|Hambleton {{assigned}} {{himself as}} navigator on the older EB-66C, which was configured to gather signals intelligence. The newer EB-66E was tasked with jamming surface-to-air missile (SAM) radar guidance systems so their missiles could not accurately target the aircraft. The EB-66's {{mission was to}} troll for missiles, let them lock on to their aircraft, and then execute a SAM break, a violent turn and dive designed to throw off the pursuing missile. The SA-2 {{was the size of}} a telephone pole and carried a proximity fused warhead that was lethal within about , but their guidance systems failed at about 2 Gs, while the EB-66 could achieve 5 Gs in its avoidance maneuver. The crew had successfully pulled a SAM break more than 100 times. The presence of North Vietnamese surface-to-air missiles south of the DMZ had been tracked by Hambleton, but not everyone agreed they were present <b>that</b> <b>far</b> south.|$|E
5|$|Harmon thought <b>that</b> <b>Far</b> Cry 4 was an {{improvement}} over Far Cry 3, but {{he thought that the}} game felt and played too similarly to Far Cry 3, and he added that the game was unambitious. Bertz thought that Ubisoft Montreal's vision for Far Cry 4 is not as bold as its predecessors, and also thought that the experience delivered by Far Cry 4 did not stray far away from Far Cry 3. Tan also noted that the game's open world design felt not only similar to Far Cry 3, but also other Ubisoft franchises like Assassin's Creed and Watch Dogs. Evans-Thirlwell thought that the experience offered by Far Cry 4 was hollow as it had failed to innovate or reinvent its wheel. Dyer thought that the game was not ambitious, but the experience delivered was still gratifying and rewarding.|$|E
5|$|He {{begins the}} section with an {{analysis}} of the temporal opening found in the skull of many extant birds. After a thorough comparison, he rejects the notion, which was common at the time, that this temporal opening was homologous with the supratemporal fenestra in reptiles. Instead, he concludes that it is a recent feature. Next he makes some observations on the wing structure of modern nestling birds. He finds that some species of extant birds have claws on their first and second fingers when very young, and some, like the hoatzin, will even use these temporary claws to climb about, including in the branches of trees. He also discovers <b>that</b> <b>far</b> more nestlings have a nonfunctional claw on the first digit, and some adult birds do as well.|$|E
