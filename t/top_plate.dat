25|$|Buildings were {{constructed}} using both poteaux-en-terre and poteaux-sur-sole techniques. In poteaux-en-terre construction, wooden posts are placed vertically into the ground. The gaps remaining between the posts {{were filled with}} a mixture of mud or clay and Spanish moss or hay. The mixture can be supplemented with small rocks. The walls are bound by a <b>top</b> <b>plate</b> and protected with plaster or siding. In poteaux-sur-sole construction, the floor of the building is elevated {{through the use of a}} bottom sill. The sill was formed by laying the wooden members directly on the ground. The elevation of the floor provided an airspace that minimized damage from moisture and insects. Since the conditions of the site were damaging against wooden structures, the poteaux-sur-sole structures would have been advantageous since their sill members could be more easily replaced than the wooden posts of a poteaux-en-terre structure. Exterior trenches suggest that palisade fences were used around some of the buildings.|$|E

500|$|A {{fusible plug}} {{operates}} as a safety valve when dangerous temperatures, rather than dangerous pressures, are reached in a closed vessel. In steam engines [...] the fusible plug is screwed into the crown sheet (the <b>top</b> <b>plate)</b> of the firebox, typically extending about an inch (25mm) into the water space above. Its purpose is {{to act as a}} last-resort safety device in the event of the water level falling dangerously low: when the top of the plug is out of the water it overheats, the low-melting-point core melts away and the resulting noisy release of steam into the firebox serves to warn the operators of the danger before the top of the firebox itself runs completely dry, which could result in catastrophic failure of the boiler. The temperature of the flue gases in a steam engine firebox can reach 1000°F (550°C), at which temperature copper, from which historically most fireboxes were made, softens to a state which can no longer sustain the boiler pressure and a severe explosion will result if water is not put into the boiler quickly and the fire removed or extinguished. The hole through the plug is too small to have any great effect in reducing the steam pressure and the small amount of water, if any, that passes through it is not expected to have any great impact in quenching the fire.|$|E

2500|$|For the {{detailed}} {{design of the}} girders Stephenson secured {{the assistance of the}} distinguished engineer William Fairbairn,an old friend of his father and described by Stephenson as [...] "well known for his thorough practical knowledge in such matters". Fairbairn began a series of practical experiments on various tube shapes and enlisted the help of Eaton Hodgkinson [...] "distinguished as the first scientific authority on the strength of iron beams" [...] It became apparent from Fairbairn's experiments that- without special precautions - the failure mode for the tube under load would be buckling of the <b>top</b> <b>plate</b> in compression, the theoretical analysis of which gave Hodgkinson some difficulty. When Stephenson reported to the directors of the railway in February 1846, he attached reports by both Hodgkinson and Fairbairn. From his analysis of the resistance to buckling of tubes with single top plates, Hodgkinson believed that it would require an impracticably thick (and therefore heavy) <b>top</b> <b>plate</b> to make the tubes stiff enough to support their own weight, and advised auxiliary suspension from link chains. However, Fairbairn's experiments had moved on from those covered by Hodgkinson's theory to include designs in which the <b>top</b> <b>plate</b> was stiffened by 'corrugation' (the incorporation of cylindrical tubes). The results of these later experiments he found very encouraging; whilst it was still to be determined what the optimum form of the tubular girder should be [...] "I would venture to state that a Tubular Bridge can be constructed of such powers and dimensions as will meet, with perfect security, the requirements of railway traffic across the Straits" [...] although it might require more materials than originally envisaged and the utmost care would be needed in its construction. [...] He believed it would be 'highly improper' to rely upon chains as the principal support of the bridge. Under every circumstance, I am of opinion that the tubes should be made sufficiently strong to sustain not only their own weight, but in addition to that load 2000 tons equally distributed over the surface of the platform, a load ten times greater than they will ever be called upon to support.|$|E
2500|$|A violin {{generally}} {{consists of}} a spruce top (the soundboard, {{also known as the}} <b>top</b> <b>plate,</b> table, or belly), maple ribs and back, two endblocks, a neck, a bridge, a soundpost, four strings, and various fittings, optionally including a chinrest, which may attach directly over, or to the left of, the tailpiece. A distinctive feature of a violin body is its hourglass-like shape and the arching of its top and back. The hourglass shape comprises two upper bouts, two lower bouts, and two concave C-bouts at the waist, providing clearance for the bow. The [...] "voice" [...] or sound of a violin depends on its shape, the wood it is made from, the graduation (the thickness profile) of both the top and back, the varnish that coats its outside surface and the skill of the luthier in doing all of these steps. The varnish and especially the wood continue to improve with age, making the fixed supply of old well-made violins built by famous luthiers much sought-after.|$|E
2500|$|Metal balls {{start as}} a wire. The wire is sheared to give a pellet with a length {{approximately}} {{the size of the}} desired ball [...] (OD). This pellet is then headed into a rough spherical shape. Next, the balls are then fed into a machine that de-flashes them. The machine does this by feeding the balls between two heavy cast iron or hardened steel plates, called rill plates. One of the plates is held stationary while the other rotates. The <b>top</b> <b>plate</b> has an opening to allow balls to enter and exit the rill plates. These plates have fine circumferential grooves that the balls track in. The balls are run through the machine long enough so that each ball passes through many of these grooves, which ensures each ball is the same size, even if a particular groove is out of specification. The controllable machine variables are the amount of pressure applied, the speed of the plates, and how long the balls are left in the machine.|$|E

2500|$|The {{original}} towers for the 1940 Tacoma Narrows Bridge featured four deep, box-shaped struts (two {{below the}} roadway and two above), {{as well as}} being tapered from being [...] wide at the base to [...] at the top. The new towers of the replacement span were to be the same width both at the bottom and the top, and were to feature a deep X-bracing system with three -deep single X-brace struts below the road deck and a series of three double-X brace struts of varying depths above the roadway (top being , middle being , and the bottom being [...] ). Tower construction began January 1, 1949, and progressed rapidly. Work went ahead of schedule and by April 1949, the [...] steel cable saddles were prepared for lifting. On April 13, 1949, the north cable saddle on the east tower was bolted into place on a set of shims to allow workers to rivet the <b>top</b> <b>plate</b> into place. Then, disaster struck. That morning, an earthquake measuring 7.1 rattled the Puget Sound region. The earthquake caused the towers to sway [...] from vertical, causing the cable saddle to shear its bolts and fall off the tower [...] The saddle fell [...] below. It missed the pedestal, and plunged straight through a barge, to a final resting spot [...] {{below the surface of the}} Narrows, [...] away from the pedestal. The resulting impact sank the barge, taking a compressor and numerous other tools with it. Divers soon located the cable saddle in a deep hole during a slack tide (the only time divers could operate, and slack tides only occurred at night). After a three-day delay, it was raised to the surface, repaired (the impact bent a corner on it), and reinstalled. The earthquake delayed completion of both the east and west towers on the bridge. After the earthquake's aftershocks subsided, work resumed, and by July 17 both towers were announced as being completed.|$|E
