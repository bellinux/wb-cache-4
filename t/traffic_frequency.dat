Treatments {{included}} {{a combination of}} four different traffic frequencies (3, 7, 14, and 20 passes of a rubber skidder) and three levels of slope ( 20 %.) The results showed that dry bulk density, rut depth and soil displacement increased {{with the increase of}} <b>traffic</b> <b>frequency</b> and slope, but floor coverage decreased. Within each traffic treatment soil compaction raised with the increase of skid trail slope, so that significant differences in dry bulk density were observed between slope of 20 %. Bulk density has become quite close to the critical value after 14 cycles. With increase of the skidder cycles from 14 to 20, bulk density remained approximately constant. We observed soil displacement on the treatments with 7 cycles: rutting on the treatments started with 7 cycles and slope of> 20 %. Soil disturbance increased significantly on slopes with> 20 % inclination with a dry bulk density of 1100 kg m- 3 after 3 cycles compared to 830 kg m- 3 on slopes 20 % (437. 6 kg/ha) was significantly (p 20 % may be associated with increasing load on the rear axle combined with slipping on steep slope trail...|$|E

40|$|Harvest traffic {{with heavy}} {{equipment}} causes damage to forest soils. Whereas increased soil {{damage has been}} reported with increasing harvest equipment traffic and on increasing slope gradients, {{it is unclear how}} much soil damage is caused by different directions of skidding. We examined the effects of <b>traffic</b> <b>frequency,</b> skid trail slope and skidding direction on the dry bulk density and total porosity of skidding trail soil in an Iranian temperate forest. The studied treatments included combinations of three different traffic frequencies (3, 7, and 12 passes of a rubber-tired skidder), three levels of slope (20 %) and two skidding directions (uphill and downhill). The impact on soil properties was greatest during the skidder initial passes. On steep slopes, only three skidder passes were required to cause substantial increases in soil bulk density relative to control plots, regardless of skidding direction. Independently of the <b>traffic</b> <b>frequency</b> and trail slope, uphill skidding caused substantially greater increases in dry bulk density and greater decreases in soil porosity than did downhill skidding. Total porosity was significantly lower on steep slopes than on gentle slopes regardless of traffic intensity and skidding direction. In general, fewer uphill skidder passes were required to achieve substantial soil disturbance than was the case for downhill skidding, possibly because skidders move more slowly when travelling upwards and uphill skidding places greater loads on the skidder rear axle...|$|E

40|$|Skidding {{operations}} induce {{changes in}} soil physical properties, {{which have the}} potential to impact soil sustainability and forest productivity. Our objective was to investigate the effects of <b>traffic</b> <b>frequency,</b> trail slope, and soil moisture content on soil compaction, total porosity and rut depth. Treatments included a combination of three different traffic intensities (3, 7, and 14 passes), three levels of slopes (20 %), and two levels of soil moisture content (18 % and 32 %). Soil bulk density and total porosity were measured as 0. 75 g cm - 3 and 71 %, respectively, along the undisturbed area. The results show that bulk density, total porosity and rut depth on skid trails were significantly affected by <b>traffic</b> <b>frequency,</b> skid trail slope and soil moisture content. As the skidder passed, skid trail slope and soil moisture content increased, increasing significantly the average bulk density. Bulk density draws near the critical value after 7 and 14 passes, respectively, at higher and lower soil water content. At each moisture content, the increase of slope > 20 % caused a significant increase of the average bulk density. Total porosity on the skid trail was measured from minimum 45 % (14 passes and slope > 20 %) to maximum 58 % (3 passes and slope 20 %) to maximum 68 % (3 passes and slope < 10 %) at lower soil moisture content. Rut depth was recorded at 7 and 14 passes at high and low soil water content, respectively, and it increased with the slope. The results show that slope and moisture content had strong effects on soil disturbance...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} factors regulating the distribution of invasive plants in Wenzhou, we used route-checking and fixed-plot sampling to evaluate the distribution of invasive species and associated agro-type, topographical and anthropological factors. Relationships between the distribution of invasive plants and the environmental factors were assessed using canonical correspondence analysis (CCA). Analysis of vari-ance {{was used to test}} for differences in species composition and abundances of the invasive plants among different parts of the region, and to explore the major factors responsible for the differences. Our investiga-tions showed: (1) 64 invasive plant species from 28 families and 51 genera were found in Wenzhou. More than 70 % of those species were either annual or biennial dicotyledonous, and 68. 8 % of them were of Ameri-can origin. (2) The number of invasive plant species differed among the 11 investigated counties of the re-gion, among which Yueqing County had the highest number of species (51 spp.), followed by Cangnan (43 spp.), while Dongtou had the fewest (27 spp.). (3) The distribution of exotic invasive plants in Wenzhou was most affected by <b>traffic</b> <b>frequency,</b> the degree of settlement, and landform type. (4) The distribution of com-mon eurychoric species was not affected strongly by any single environmental factor. The distribution of rare species with limited distributions, however, was affected significantly by both <b>traffic</b> <b>frequency</b> and landform; (5) Human activities played an important role during the initial stage of the invasion for the success-fully invaded plants. Environmental factors were critical to the invading plants during the establishment stage of the invasion, while their biological characteristics had the major effect on their successful spread and on the extent of the damage they would cause in the areas they invaded...|$|E

40|$|Significant {{testing was}} {{performed}} on cores recovered from the trafficked and un-trafficked portions of a typical Australian airport runway surface approximately two years after paving. The relative density, aggregate orientation, resilient modulus, wheel tracking and interface shear resistance were measured and statistically compared. Interface shear resistance included strength, modulus and work/energy measurements. With {{the exception of the}} interface’s shear modulus, traffic was found to have a statistically significant impact on all parameters compared. Aircraft traffic triggered a substantial change in the asphalt’s structure. This evolution of the asphalt structure resulted in a measurable improvement in the surface layer’s resilient modulus and interface shear strength. Being typical of airport asphalt used throughout Australia, the measured effects of traffic are expected to be representative of all Australian airport asphalts. Further investigation is needed to determine the rate of evolution of asphalt structure as a function of <b>traffic</b> <b>frequency...</b>|$|E

Many lives are lost and huge amount of property damage occurs due to accidents. In 2011 only, 121618 people lost their lives in road accident in India. From 2001 to 2011, the decade data shows the fatalities has been increased by 5. 8 % and the number of persons injured by 2. 5 %.

40|$|Arable {{areas are}} {{commonly}} susceptible to alien plant invasion because they experience dramatic environmental influences and intense anthropogenic activity. However, the limited reports on relevant factors in plant invasion of croplands have addressed single {{or a few}} invasive species and environmental factors. To elucidate key factors affecting plant invasions in croplands, we analyzed the relationship between 11 effective factors and changes in composition of alien plants, using field surveys of crop fields in Anhui Province conducted during 1987 - 1990 (historical dataset) and 2005 - 2010 (recent dataset), when rapid urbanization was occurring in China. We found {{that in the past}} few decades, the dominance and richness of alien plant populations approximately doubled, despite differences among the 4 regions of Anhui Province. Among the 38 alien invasive plant species observed in the sites, the dominance values of 11 species increased significantly, while the dominance of 4 species decreased significantly. The quantity of chemical fertilizer and herbicide applied, population density, agricultural machinery use, <b>traffic</b> <b>frequency,</b> and annual mean temperature were significantly related to increased richness and annual dominance values of alien plant species.
