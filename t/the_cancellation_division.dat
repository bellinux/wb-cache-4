Promoted teams tend to move up to Dorset & Wilts 2 North.

40|$|The {{adaptive}} filters {{in active}} noise control (ANC) systems differ from other common adaptive filters {{in the existence of}} <b>the</b> <b>cancellation</b> path, which is the transfer function between the outputs of the adaptive control filters and <b>the</b> error sensors. <b>Cancellation</b> paths {{play a critical role in}} {{active noise control}} systems, and the corresponding adaptive algorithms usually require the information of <b>the</b> <b>cancellation</b> paths for updating the control filters. The most commonly used filtered-x LMS algorithm takes into account <b>the</b> <b>cancellation</b> paths by filtering the reference signal with an estimate of <b>the</b> <b>cancellation</b> path transfer functions. For many ANC applications, <b>the</b> <b>cancellation</b> path modelling must be carried out online to maintain the stability of the system, and one modelling method obtains <b>the</b> <b>cancellation</b> path information by injecting uncorrelated signal into <b>the</b> <b>cancellation</b> path. This paper will introduce the filtered- x LMS algorithm embedded with this online cancellation path modelling and the direction search LMS algorithm, which is one of the ANC algorithms that do not need an explicit model of <b>the</b> <b>cancellation</b> path. In <b>the</b> direction search LMS algorithm, the standard LMS algorithm is adopted to update the adaptive filter coefficients directly with the reference signal by automatically choosing a proper update direction based on the monitoring of the excess noise power. The performance of the two typical adaptive ANC algorithms, one with and one without cancellation path modelling, will be compared in terms of noise reduction level, tracking speed, computation load and robustness...|$|R
