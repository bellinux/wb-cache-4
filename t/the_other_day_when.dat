500|$|In a May 8, 2008 {{report on}} the recent actions of Anonymous against Scientology, CNN {{reporter}} Kareen Wynter commented: [...] "Legal experts say the church may be facing its biggest challenge yet – trying to protect its image, in a loosely policed medium seen by millions of people. In a July 2008 interview with Entertainment Weekly, Alan Moore {{had this to say}} about the use of the Guy Fawkes motif, adopted from his comic V for Vendetta: [...] "I was also quite heartened <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> <b>when</b> watching the news to see that there were demonstrations outside the Scientology headquarters over here, and that they suddenly flashed to a clip showing all these demonstrators wearing V for Vendetta [...] masks. That pleased me. That gave me a warm little glow." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the many}} accolades he had received, Winters {{remained}} humble about his service. During the interview {{segment of the}} miniseries Band of Brothers, Winters quoted a passage from a letter he received from Sergeant Mike Ranney, [...] "I cherish the memories of a question my grandson asked me <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> <b>when</b> he said, 'Grandpa, were you a hero in the war?' Grandpa said 'No...but I served in a company of heroes'." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It {{certainly}} is one dandy place," [...] remarked Jack to <b>the</b> <b>others</b> one <b>day</b> <b>when</b> {{they were coming}} {{up to the house}} from the river, each with a fair-sized string of fish to his credit.|$|R
6000|$|... "And she’s kept {{house for}} me for twenty-five years," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Truefitt; [...] "and the surprising thing {{to me is the}} way the years have gone. I didn’t realize it until I found an old photograph of hers <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> taken <b>when</b> she was twenty. Men don’t change much." ...|$|R

"I {{went to the}} meeting, {{memorial}} and luncheon at the Academy and my {{mind and}} heart was with you two in Hollywood, knowing you both were thinking of the <b>day</b> and <b>the</b> many <b>other</b> <b>days</b> <b>when</b> you and Lorado Taft were the distinguished members.

6000|$|... "No, thank you, I'll begin myself. Do you remember, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day,</b> <b>when</b> we were here, {{and were}} talking of the {{difference}} in peoples' pride?" ...|$|E
60|$|Third Friar. Colman fainted <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> <b>when</b> {{he was at}} his meditation. He says it is a great labour {{to follow}} one thought always.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, but you have," [...] Sheldon said quickly. [...] "You {{were telling}} me a lie of that order only <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day.</b> You {{remember}} <b>when</b> you were going up the lantern-halyards hand over hand? Your face was the personification of duplicity." ...|$|R
60|$|It {{is a third}} {{property}} of trading-men to see that their clerks do not divert the dealings of the master to their own benefit. It was <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> only, <b>when</b> their Governor and Council taxed the Company's investment with a sum of fifty thousand pounds, as an inducement to persuade only seven members of their Board of Trade to give their honor that they would abstain from such profits upon that investment, as they must have violated their oaths, if they had made at all.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was quite}} enough for me," [...] broke in the Left Bower, [...] "when <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day,</b> you {{remember}} <b>when,</b> {{he proposed to}} us white men to settle down to plain ground sluicing, making 'grub' wages just like any Chinaman. It just showed his idea of the Lone Star claim." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir James," [...] he said, [...] "I was {{wondering}} <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> <b>when</b> was the exact {{date of the}} earliest public ascription of Waverley to Scott." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Faith, nor I," [...] {{said her}} husband. [...] "But she is willing, {{provided}} {{she can have}} the child. She said so only <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> <b>when</b> I talked o't!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Uncle Fritz {{knows what}} I like. Yes, these are {{magnificent}} kites, {{and we were}} wishing we had some <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> <b>when</b> you were flying yours, weren't we, girls?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Shore I knowed you'd plunk him," [...] said Jim {{very much}} pleased. [...] "I shot one <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> same way, <b>when</b> he was feedin' off a dead horse. Now thet's a fine skin. Shore you cut through once or twice. But he's only half lofer, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> half in plain coyote. Thet {{accounts}} fer his feedin' on dead meat." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are {{no longer}} a child, Ruth, and if you go on meeting young Forester down at the pool, people will be {{beginning}} to talk. Of course I know that you are a good girl, and would never for a moment think of taking up with George Forester. Every one knows what sort of young fellow he is; he never does a day's work on the farm, and he is {{in and out of the}} 'Carne Arms' at all hours. He associates with the worst lot in the village, and it was only <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> that <b>when</b> <b>the</b> parson tried to speak to him seriously, he answered him in a way that was enough to make one's hair stand on end." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The French burnt {{the village}} because the guerillas had killed {{a party of}} theirs in it, and they killed all the people, and then carried off the mules and horses, and took us to drive some of them. That was four months ago. We had to drive till <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> at Tamanes, <b>when</b> our men beat the French; our mules were taken, and, as {{they did not want}} us as drivers we had nothing to do but to come on in hopes that the kind English would give us food." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, my dear--and with you. It comes {{more or less}} to {{the same}} thing; and it's what you didn't tell me <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> <b>when</b> I put you the question." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day,</b> <b>when</b> I {{had been}} dozing, I caught myself calling {{out that he}} was {{whistling}} 'Johnny Cope' so loud that he would be heard in the shop." ...|$|E
60|$|MINNIE. We spotted Bert because he's {{with the}} Marines, at that {{place where they}} put a crimp in the Huns <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> <b>when</b> {{they were going to}} walk into Paris.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{expected}} me to know about his absurd drill, Tregellis, and I had other things to think of, as you may suppose. I had no difficulty in taking my right place on parade, for there was a trooper with a red nose on a flea-bitten grey, and I had observed that my post was always immediately in front of him. This saved {{a great deal of}} trouble. <b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>day,</b> however, <b>when</b> I came on parade, I galloped up one line and down <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> but <b>the</b> deuce a glimpse could I get of that long nose of his! Then, just as I was at my wits' end, I caught sight of him, alone at one side; so I formed up in front. It seems he had been put there to keep the ground, and the major so far forgot himself as to say that I knew nothing of my duties." ...|$|R
2500|$|When {{assessing}} {{a person}} for benzodiazepine dependence, asking specific questions rather than questions based on concepts is recommended by experts as the best approach of getting a more accurate diagnosis. For example, asking persons if they [...] "think about the medication at times of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>other</b> than <b>when</b> they take the drug" [...] would provide a more meaningful answer than asking [...] "do {{you think you are}} psychologically dependent?". The [...] is one questionnaire used to assess and diagnose benzodiazepine dependence.|$|R
50|$|Rick's {{aircraft}} arrives but he {{runs away}} from the hangar where Nell is waiting. While writing a letter {{to be given to}} him, Nell sees Rick enter the cafeteria and runs in after him. Without him realizing it she takes over for the waitress and makes him the chocolate malt he orders, just the way she did back in Youngstown, where her family had a malt shop. They drink the malt together, and they forgive each <b>other.</b> <b>The</b> next <b>day,</b> <b>when</b> Rick is finally shipped out, Nell is there to kiss him goodbye.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Why, just fancy, <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> <b>when</b> Uncle Thomas fetched {{him in his}} brougham because I {{was coming}} home, there he sat at luncheon and would not eat a scrap of meat.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{knows it}} now," [...] said Johnny; [...] "I went {{to say good-bye}} to her <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day,</b> <b>when</b> I {{thought she was going to}} be married. I could not help telling her then." ...|$|E
6000|$|Daddy seized his elder boy {{and shook}} him playfully. [...] "I heard {{what you said}} to Miss Cregan <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day.</b> <b>When</b> she asked you what an acre was you said 'About the size of Daddy.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>The</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> (confided Reginald), <b>when</b> I {{was killing}} {{time in the}} {{bathroom}} and making bad resolutions for the New Year, {{it occurred to me that}} I would like to be a poet. The chief qualification, I understand, is that you must be born. Well, I hunted up my birth certificate, and found that I was all right on that score, and then I got to work on a Hymn to the New Year, which struck me as having possibilities. It suggested extremely unusual things to absolutely unlikely people, which I believe is the art of first-class catering in any department. Quite the best verse in it went something like this-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought that}} it had been given to me by my friend the dean. I {{remember}} well that I was in his library at Barchester, and I was somewhat provoked in spirit. There were lying on the floor hundreds of volumes, all glittering with gold, and reeking with new leather from the binders. He asked me to look at his toys. Why should I look at them? There was a time, but <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> it seemed, <b>when</b> he had been glad to borrow from me such treasures as I had. And {{it seemed to me that}} he was heartless in showing me these things. Well; I need not trouble you with all that." ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{an element}} of {{selfishness}} in Hannah's mania for keeping busy, for doing all their housework and cooking herself. She {{could not bear to}} have her daughters interfere; perhaps {{she did not want to}} give herself time to think. Her affection for Edward, such as it was, her loyalty to him, was the logical result of a conviction ingrained in early youth that marriage was an indissoluble bond; a point of views once having a religious sanction, no less powerful now that--all unconsciously--it had deteriorated into a superstition. Hannah, being a fatalist, was not religious. <b>The</b> beliefs of <b>other</b> <b>days,</b> <b>when</b> she had donned her best dress and gone to church on Sundays, had simply lapsed and left--habits. No new beliefs had taken their place....|$|R
6000|$|... "But, father, we {{can walk}} there very easily," [...] said Rollo. [...] "There {{is a nice}} path along {{the bank of the}} river. I saw it <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day,</b> <b>when</b> I was down below the bridge." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Put {{down your}} hat, Mr. Longmore," [...] she said, [...] "and be polite for once. You {{were not at}} all polite <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> <b>when</b> I asked you that {{friendly}} question {{about the state of}} your heart." ...|$|E
6000|$|Susy aged eleven, Jean three.--Susy said <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> <b>when</b> she [...] saw Jean {{bringing}} a cat {{to me of}} her own motion, [...] "Jean has found [...] out already that mamma loves morals and papa loves cats." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is a shame!" [...] {{the woman}} said, {{as she watched}} them; [...] "I don't mind <b>the</b> <b>other</b> things, but I never liked this. I wonder who the poor little chap is. By the way he talked when he first came, about his home and his nurse and horses and carriages, his friends must be rich people. Bill has never {{understood}} why {{they wanted to get}} rid of him; but I suppose that he was in somebody's way, and, as he never speaks of his father and mother, but only of those two girls and his grandfather, who seems to have been an invalid, I expect that he must have lost his father and mother before he can remember. Well, he will be right enough here; I should miss him dreadful if he were to go away; he seems to have taken the place of my little Billy. And Bill takes to him, too, wonderfully. He said <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> that <b>when</b> <b>the</b> boy grew up he would buy a barge, a new one of the best kind, and that some day it should be the boy's own. So he won't do so bad, after all." ...|$|R
60|$|Some hostesses, of course, {{will forgive}} anything, even unto pavonicide (is {{there such a}} word?), {{as long as one}} is nice-looking and {{sufficiently}} unusual to counterbalance some of the others; and there are others--the girl, for instance, who reads Meredith, and appears at meals with unnatural punctuality in a frock that's made at home and repented at leisure. She eventually finds her way to India and gets married, and comes home to admire the Royal Academy, and to imagine that an indifferent prawn curry is for ever an effective substitute for all that we have been taught to believe is luncheon. It's then that she is really dangerous; but at her worst she is never quite so bad as the woman who fires Exchange and Mart questions at you without the least provocation. Imagine <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day,</b> just <b>when</b> I was doing my best to understand half the things I was saying, being asked by one of those seekers after country home truths how many fowls she could keep in a run ten feet by six, or whatever it was! I told her whole crowds, as long as she kept the door shut, and the idea didn't seem to have struck her before; at least, she brooded over {{it for the rest of}} dinner.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to Liō, the strip only has one other major character, Liō's unnamed father. He is frequently {{shown to be}} the subject of Liō's pranks, and sometimes he has to get his son out of difficult situations. When he watched a news report of an alien invasion, he gave Liō a spanking for apparently having piloted the alien ship and parking it in the backyard (dated at 2007/02/09). On <b>the</b> <b>other</b> hand, one <b>day</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> boy came home from school dejected because a drawing he created had horrified the faculty, Dad proudly hung up the piece of art on the refrigerator, giving his son much-needed comfort and joy (dated 2009/03/15). Quite often, father and son prove that they really love each other, no matter what.|$|R
