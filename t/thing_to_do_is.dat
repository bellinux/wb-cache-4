Probably the sensible <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> bite the bullet, take it down and build a new stand, but it means 18 to 24 months without revenue {{and the people in}} that stand tend to be {{the people who have been}} the supporters for many generations.|$|E

He {{noted that}} by rearranging equipment—and often keeping the same setup for around just five minutes—it {{allowed him to}} explore more writing possibilities; he said [...] "that will achieve some sort of purpose, so the way I've wired it together becomes the track in itself." [...] James also explained that when composing the [...] "logical <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> not change anything and just do another one using {{the same set of}} sounds", but during Syros recording sessions he would often [...] "get bored and swap things out".|$|E

500|$|Others {{have noted}} {{that the lack of}} {{coverage}} is not simply a media issue. Peter Fahy, the spokesman on race issues for the Association of Chief Police Officers said: [...] "A lot of police officers and other professionals feel almost the best <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to try and avoid [...] for fear of being criticised. This is not healthy". Montague suggests the lack of police appeals in cases involving white victims may be a cause of the lack of media coverage. Evidence of this was seen in the Parker case, with the police initially appearing keen to dismiss the possible racist aspect of the murder, stating [...] "there was {{no reason to believe that}} the attack was racially motivated".|$|E
500|$|Betty Elms (Naomi Watts) is {{the bright}} and talented {{newcomer}} to Los Angeles, described as [...] "wholesome, optimistic, determined {{to take the}} town by storm", and [...] "absurdly naïve". Her perkiness and intrepid approach to helping Rita {{because it is the}} right <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> reminiscent of Nancy Drew for reviewers. Her entire persona at first is an apparent cliché of small-town naïveté. But it is Betty's identity, or loss of it, that appears to be the focus of the film. For one critic, Betty performed the role of the film's consciousness and unconscious. Naomi Watts, who modeled Betty on Doris Day, Tippi Hedren and Kim Novak, observed that Betty is a thrill-seeker, someone [...] "who finds herself in a world she doesn't belong in and is ready to take on a new identity, even if it's somebody else's". This has also led one theorist to conclude that since Betty had naïvely, yet eagerly entered the Hollywood system, she had become a [...] "complicit actor" [...] who had [...] "embraced the very structure that" [...] destroyed her. In an explanation of her development of the Betty character, Watts stated: ...|$|E
500|$|... 2003 {{marked a}} {{significant}} {{turning point in}} Sarsgaard's career, when he starred in the feature film Shattered Glass. He depicted journalist Charles Lane, the lead editor of The New Republic. Shattered Glass {{is based on the}} real events of journalist Stephen Glass' career at The New Republic during the mid-1990s and his fall when his widespread journalistic fraud is exposed. During promotion of the film, Sarsgaard noted of his portrayal of Lane: [...] "I just wanted to get his perspective on the actual events. [...] I think that I tried to have some respect for myself and that way you're respecting the real person you're playing. I've done it a number of times. And it's always a little bit confusing. The best <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> just to ignore the fact, I think, that you're playing somebody who is a real life character." [...] According to the San Diego Union-Tribune, [...] "Peter Sarsgaard is appealingly level, a stolid straight-shooter as Lane". A reviewer from the Chicago Tribune noted that Sarsgaard plays Lane with [...] "great subtlety and grace". The newspaper concluded with, [...] "The character doesn't seethe with personal resentment; when he does a slow burn, he conveys a much deeper sense of a man's value system being violated past the breaking point." [...] Sarsgaard's performance in the film earned him his first Golden Globe Award nomination and an Independent Spirit Award nomination.|$|E

A reversal of the third ictus (as shown above) is normally preceded by at least a slight intonational break, which [...] "deaf heaven" [...] does not allow. Peter Groves calls this a [...] "harsh mapping", and recommends that in performance [...] "the best <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to prolong the subordinated S-syllable ... {{the effect of this}} is to throw a degree of emphasis on it".|$|E

Upon graduation, Hill was called up for the army in 1964 but childhood asthma saw him ruled ineligible. This forced him to think about {{what he wanted to do}} for a career.

He would not have proceeded if he did not feel that he could convict." [...] Sharpton continued that the case parallels [...] "Abner Louima, who was raped and sodomized in a bathroom."

According to SoundScan, [...] "Apologize" [...] is the most legally downloaded song in US digital history with sales of over 4.3 million digital downloads in the US alone. It is also the second best-selling song of the decade. OneRepublic's debut album, Dreaming Out Loud, includes both the song's original version and version with Timbaland, and was released on November 20, 2007 on Timbaland's Mosley Music Group imprint via Interscope Records. The band had previously been signed to Columbia Records, and their album was due to be released in 2006, but this did not occur. Tedder explained, [...] "Crap happened. People got fired. Labels merged and politics abounded". Subsequently, the band was released from their deal with Columbia, and they were signed by Timbaland in the summer of 2006 becoming the first rock band to be signed to Mosley Music Group. Tedder has commented on the success of his band's hit single, [...] "Apologize": [...] "The toughest <b>thing</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> write a hit song, but we had a hit song before we had an album...
