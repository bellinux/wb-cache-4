5|$|Most antbirds have proportionately large, heavy bills. Several genera of antshrike have a {{strongly}} hooked <b>tip</b> <b>to</b> the bill, and all antbirds have a notch or 'tooth' {{at the tip}} of the bill which helps in holding and crushing insect prey. The two genera of bushbirds have upturned chisel-like bills.|$|E

5|$|In preparation, Beauchamp {{packed a}} change of clothes, a black mask, and a knife with poison on the <b>tip,</b> <b>to</b> {{be used as the}} murder weapon. Finding all the inns filled when he arrived at Frankfort, he took lodging at the {{residence}} of Joel Scott, warden of the state penitentiary. Between nine and ten o'clock that evening, Beauchamp went to Sharp's home. Dressed in disguise, he carried his usual clothes and buried them along the bank of the Kentucky River for retrieval following the murder. Discovering that Sharp was not home, Beauchamp looked for him in the city, finding him at a local tavern. He returned to Sharp's house to wait for him, and saw him return at midnight.|$|E
5|$|In the South Atlantic Bight, {{both sexes}} mature at a fork length (from snout <b>tip</b> <b>to</b> caudal fin fork) of around , {{corresponding}} to ages of 4.3 years {{for males and}} 4.5 years for females. In the Gulf of Mexico, both sexes mature at a fork length of around , corresponding to ages of 5.4 years for males and 6.6 years for females. The maximum lifespan has been calculated as 19 years in South Atlantic Bight and 16.5 years in the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|The {{preferred}} habitats of the Bengal slow loris range across tropical and subtropical regions, {{and include}} evergreen and semi-evergreen rainforests with forest edges and continuous, dense canopies. It {{can also be}} found in bamboo groves. It prefers habitats with larger diameter, tall trees with a large crown depth (defined as the length along the main axis from the tree <b>tip</b> <b>to</b> the base of the crown); these areas are typically associated with greater food abundance, and decreased risk of predation. Because of its preference for dense forests, it acts as a good indicator of the ecosystem's health.|$|E

5|$|A {{plate of}} hard horny tissue {{at the tip}} of the beak of all birds in the family Anatidae (ducks, geese and swans). This shield-shaped structure, which {{sometimes}} spans the entire width of the beak, is often bent at the <b>tip</b> <b>to</b> form a hook. It serves different purposes depending on the bird's primary food source. Most species use their nails to dig seeds out of mud or vegetation, while diving ducks use theirs to pry molluscs from rocks. There is evidence that the nail may help a bird to grasp things; species which use strong grasping motions to secure their food (such as when catching and holding onto a large squirming frog) have very wide nails. Certain types of mechanoreceptors, nerve cells that are sensitive to pressure, vibration or touch, are located under the nail.|$|E
5|$|The design {{proposed}} by Handley Page {{in response to}} B.35/46 was given the internal designation of HP.80. To achieve the required performance, Handley Page's aerodynamicist Dr. Gustav Lachmann and his deputy, Godfrey Lee developed a crescent-shaped swept wing for the HP.80; the sweep and chord of the wing decreased in three distinct steps from the root to the <b>tip,</b> <b>to</b> ensure a constant limiting Mach number across the entire wing and consequently a high cruise speed. Early work on the project included tailless aircraft designs, which would have used wing-tip vertical surfaces instead; however as the proposal matured a high-mounted, full tailplane was adopted instead. The profile and shaping of the crescent wing was subject to considerable fine-tuning and alterations throughout the early development stages, particularly to counter unfavourable pitching behaviour in flight.|$|E
5|$|The nasals make {{up most of}} the crest. Brown {{assumed that}} they {{extended}} from the beaks' <b>tip</b> <b>to</b> the highest spot along the crest and that, unlike those in other genera, the nasals meet in the centre and are not separated in front by an ascending premaxillary process. Brown however, mistook the praemaxillae for the nasals; the snout is actually largely formed by them and they do separate the nasals. Brown also thought that on the top and back of the crest, the whole external face is covered by the frontals. Again he made a mistake: what he assumed to be the frontals are in fact the nasals. The nasals end {{at the back of the}} squamosals in a hooked, short process. The prefrontals also make up part of the crest; however, Brown mistook the lower upper branch of the praemaxilla for the prefrontal. The actual prefrontal, triangular in shape, is located at the side of the crest base; it was by Brown seen as a part of the frontal. The real frontals, largely internal to the crest base structure, are not visible from the side.|$|E

5|$|The plumage of {{an adult}} bald eagle is evenly dark brown with a white head and tail. The tail is {{moderately}} long and slightly wedge-shaped. Males and females are identical in plumage coloration, but sexual dimorphism {{is evident in the}} species, in that females are 25% larger than males. The beak, feet and irises are bright yellow. The legs are feather-free, and the toes are short and powerful with large talons. The highly developed talon of the hind toe is used to pierce the vital areas of prey while it is held immobile by the front toes. The beak is large and hooked, with a yellow cere. The adult bald eagle is unmistakable in its native range. The closely related African fish eagle (H. vocifer) (from far outside the bald eagle's range) also has a brown body, white head and tail, but differs from the bald in having a white chest and black <b>tip</b> <b>to</b> the bill.|$|E
5|$|While {{historically}} {{thought of}} as simple leathery structures composed of skin, research has since shown that the wing membranes of pterosaurs were highly complex dynamic structures suited to an active style of flight. The outer wings (from the <b>tip</b> <b>to</b> the elbow) were strengthened by closely spaced fibers called actinofibrils. The actinofibrils themselves consisted of three distinct layers in the wing, forming a crisscross pattern when superimposed on one another. The function of the actinofibrils is unknown, as is the exact material from which they were made. Depending on their exact composition (keratin, muscle, elastic structures, etc.), {{they may have been}} stiffening or strengthening agents in the outer part of the wing. The wing membranes also contained a thin layer of muscle, fibrous tissue, and a unique, complex circulatory system of looping blood vessels.|$|E

25|$|Dip-pen {{nanolithography}} is {{a process}} that uses an atomic force microscope to transfer molecules on the <b>tip</b> <b>to</b> a substrate. Initially the tip is dipped into a reservoir with an ink. The ink on the tip evaporates and leaves the desired molecules attached to the tip. When the tip is brought into contact with the surface a water meniscus forms between the tip and the surface resulting in the diffusion of molecules from the <b>tip</b> <b>to</b> the surface. These tips can have radii in the tens of nanometers, and thus SAM molecules can be very precisely deposited onto a specific location of the surface. This process was discovered by Chad Mirkin and co-workers at Northwestern University.|$|E
