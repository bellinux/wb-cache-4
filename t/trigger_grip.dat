5000|$|The Gun, Machine, Vickers, [...]5-inch, Mk. II {{was used}} in tanks, the earlier Mark I having been the {{development}} model. This entered service in 1933 and was obsolete in 1944. Firing either single shot or automatic it had a pistol type <b>trigger</b> <b>grip</b> rather than the spades of the 0.303 in (7.7 mm) cartridge.|$|E
5000|$|Riku the story's protagonist, is {{a high-school}} student {{who lives with}} his father (absent {{for most of the}} story) and stepmother, Shizuru. He was in love with Shizuru's younger sister, Amane, but she is presumed dead two years ago in a fire. After sustaining, {{at the start of the}} series, a fatal wound from a Kanshu, Neene turns Riku into a special Kanshu that can retain his own {{consciousness}} as long as he has a Jinki. His Jinki, gained through Youhei's sacrifice, takes the form of a chainsaw-like sword with <b>trigger</b> <b>grip.</b> Despite his desperate efforts to keep Neene out of harm's way and public knowledge, F.L.A.G eventually sets its sights on the young hybrid and puts Riku under custody, only for the two of them to escape with the director as hostage. After the source of infection take Neene he has disappeared. He reappeared in the battle of the rubble tower only to disappear for three months in the aftermath, reappearing in a cocoon of light. In his Jinki form, Riku retains his white hair and markings from his kanshu transformation; due to multiple sightings, the online community has started to call [...] "Suraga". He is an extremely strong Jinki user, able to damage Kagomari while others can not touch them.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{predictability}} of load magnitude on anticipatory and triggered grip-force adjustments were studied as nine normal subjects used a precision grip to lift, hold, and replace an instrumented test object. Experience with a predictable stimulus {{has been shown}} to enhance magnitude scaling of triggered postural responses to different amplitudes of perturbations. However, this phenomenon, known as a central-set effect, has not been tested systematically for grip-force responses in the hand. In our study, predictability was manipulated by applying load perturbations of different magnitudes to the test object under conditions in which the upcoming load magnitude was presented repeatedly or under conditions in which the load magnitudes were presented randomly, each with two different pre-load grip conditions (unconstrained and constrained). In constrained conditions, initial grip forces were maintained near the minimum level necessary to prevent pre-loaded object slippage, while in unconstrained conditions, no initial grip force restrictions were imposed. The effect of predictable (blocked) and unpredictable (random) load presentations on scaling of anticipatory and <b>triggered</b> <b>grip</b> responses was tested by comparing the slopes of linear regressions between the imposed load and grip response magnitude. Anticipatory and <b>triggered</b> <b>grip</b> force responses were scaled to load magnitude in all conditions. However, regardless of pre-load grip force constraint, the gains (slopes) of grip responses relative to load magnitudes were greater when the magnitude of the upcoming load was predictable than when the load increase was unpredictable. In addition, a central-set effect was evidenced by the fewer number of drop trials in the predictable relative to unpredictable load conditions. Pre-load grip forces showed the greatest set effects. However, grip responses showed larger set effects, based on prediction, when pre-load grip force was constrained to lower levels. These results suggest that anticipatory processes pertaining to load magnitude permit the response gain of both voluntary and <b>triggered</b> rapid <b>grip</b> force adjustments to be set, at least partially, prior to perturbation onset. Comparison of anticipatory set effects for reactive torque and lower extremity EMG postural responses triggered by surface translation perturbations suggests a more general rule governing anticipatory processes...|$|R

50|$|In Romania the rifles are {{manufactured}} to conform with certain United States firearms regulations including Title 18, Chapter 44, of the United States Code, which defines laws for manufacturing and importing firearms such as semi-automatic only fire. Century Arms modifies the weapon with upgraded fire control groups (i.e. <b>trigger),</b> pistol <b>grips,</b> and plastic folding or collapsible stocks manufactured by TAPCO of Georgia.|$|R
50|$|The Webley-Fosbery is a recoil-operated revolver. It {{has three}} {{functional}} sections: the barrel and cylinder section, {{the lock and}} hammer action, and the frame which houses the <b>trigger,</b> recoil spring, <b>grip,</b> and safety.|$|R
50|$|The Bushmaster ACR rifle is gas operated, {{semi-automatic}} rifle of modular design. It utilizes an aluminum alloy upper receiver, with polymer pistol <b>grip,</b> <b>trigger,</b> and magazine housing (lower receiver) unit which {{is attached to}} the upper receiver using cross-pins.|$|R
50|$|The Tubb 2000's barrel can {{be changed}} by the end-user, {{allowing}} the same rifle to support various calibers. Adjustable or user-changeable features include stock, sights, hand <b>grip,</b> <b>trigger.</b> It includes a quiet shock absorbing stock instead of a loud muzzle brake.|$|R
5000|$|The SIG Sauer P238 is {{a compact}} [...]380 ACP caliber, single-action pistol {{announced}} by SIG Sauer at the 2009 SHOT Show. It is modelled after the classic M1911, {{similar to the}} Colt Mustang pistol, with a classic SIG Sauer scalloped slide and finger relief under the <b>trigger</b> guard. <b>Grip</b> panels are fluted polymer making this an all-metal frame firearm in competition with plastic-framed pistols {{in the same class}} like the Ruger LCP and the Kel-Tec P-3AT.|$|R
50|$|The {{military}} standard PA-63 version {{sports a}} two-tone polished aluminum frame with black slide, <b>grips,</b> <b>trigger</b> and hammer assembly. While unusual for military issue in that a reflective polish was used, it was chosen {{due to its}} relative cheapness as well as quicker build time.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{slightly}} larger {{version of the}} SIG Sauer P238 (.380 ACP) pistol. Trigger pull is listed at 7.5 to 8.5 lb. A finger relief exists under the <b>trigger</b> guard. <b>Grip</b> panels are one of three kinds of wood, Hogue G-10 Extreme composite, or rubber wrap around in the [...] "Sport" [...] model. The frame is metal, unlike many other subcompact 9 mm handguns. The frame for all P938 models is anodized aluminum alloy, and the slide is stainless steel either bare or with SIG's Nitron coating.|$|R
50|$|An {{attempt to}} make the M73 useful as a {{flexible}} infantry gun saw the weapon fitted with sights and a pistol <b>grip</b> <b>trigger</b> as the Machine Gun, 7.62-MM, M73C. Equally unpopular, very few of these weapons were produced. Sources claim that it saw limited use in Vietnam.|$|R
50|$|The gun's entire upper {{assembly}} (barrel, cylinder and frame) {{are mounted}} on rails {{on the lower}} frame, which houses the <b>trigger,</b> hammer, and <b>grip,</b> and recoils 1/2 of an inch, or 12.7mm, on firing. The rearward motion of the upper assembly cocks the hammer, and the cylinder is rotated on the forward stroke.|$|R
50|$|On 16 January 2017, Campbell {{was arrested}} in {{connection}} to {{the shooting death of}} Ronald McPhatter. McPhatter was working at the time as the bodyguard for rapper Roland Collins (Troy Ave.) at an Irving Plaza concert for fellow rapper Clifford Joseph Harris Jr. (T.I.) Campbell was indicted on charges of being a felon in possession of a firearm and receiving a gun through interstate commerce. Authorities allege that Campbell's DNA was found on the <b>trigger,</b> hand <b>grip</b> and magazine of the 9-millimeter Kel-Tec semiautomatic handgun that was used in the shooting in the venue's green room.|$|R
50|$|Both were bullpup-style weapons; the {{magazine}} and chamber are placed behind the <b>trigger</b> and pistol <b>grip,</b> leading to a shorter overall length (by about 20%) and a better ratio between barrel length and weapon length (the overall length of the EM-2 is 9.5 inches less than the U.S. M14, but its barrel is 2.5 inches longer).|$|R
50|$|This was a Sten Mk.III entirely {{encased in}} a wooden body, with the only {{external}} metal parts being the trigger, barrel, magazine and cocking handle. The <b>trigger</b> and pistol <b>grip</b> were {{in line with the}} magazine. The reasons for its creation are likely an experiment into increasing the comfort and handling of the weapon in freezing temperatures.|$|R
5000|$|The LCRx {{includes}} the friction-reducing cam for the smooth trigger pull, but the LCRx has an exposed hammer {{that can be}} cocked allowing the revolver to be fired in single or double action. All the other features of the LCR [...]38 Special are also present in the LCRx including the polymer <b>grip,</b> <b>trigger</b> housing, and fluted stainless steel cylinder.|$|R
5000|$|The Smith & Wesson SW99 is a {{joint venture}} between Walther, who {{produces}} a modified receiver in Germany, and Smith & Wesson, who fabricates the slides and barrels in the United States. Magazines can be interchanged between the two models, but the pistols are considered to be two separate types, and are easily distinguished from each other by the <b>trigger</b> guard, <b>grip</b> and slide design. The SW99 is also available in [...]45 ACP, while the P99 is not. The P99 was developed and introduced prior to the SW99. Walther introduced a color-coding system to denote the difference between early generation SW99 and P99 magazines, with the latest generation being bright blue.|$|R
50|$|California Makes {{it illegal}} to sell Airsoft/BB guns to anyone under 18 without their parent's {{permission}} and all airsoft guns are required to be fitted with an orange blaze barrel for sale and transport. Since 2016, the state will also require all airsoft guns to have fluorescent coloration over the <b>trigger</b> guard and <b>grip</b> (with additional requirements for rifles or long guns).|$|R
50|$|In western movies, the characters' gun belts {{are often}} worn {{low on the}} hip and outer thigh, with the holster cut away around the pistol's <b>trigger</b> and <b>grip</b> for a smooth, fast draw. This type of holster is a Hollywood anachronism. Fast-draw artists can be {{distinguished}} from other movie cowboys because their guns will often be tied to their thigh. Long before holsters were steel-lined, they were soft and supple for comfortable all-day wear. A gunfighter would use tie-downs to keep his pistol from catching on the holster while drawing. Most of the time, gunfighters would just hide their pistols in their pockets, which was faster and more practical. Other gunfighters would use Bridgeport rigs that gave a faster and easier draw.|$|R
5000|$|Introduced at the 2010 SHOT Show, the P226 E2 at {{the time}} was a {{significant}} update to the P226 line. 'E2' (pronounced 'E-squared'), or otherwise known as [...] "Enhanced Ergonomics", is SIG Sauer's attempt to make the large frame gun more ergonomic for persons with small and medium-sized hands. A reduced grip size and reduced reach trigger bring the trigger face back more than 13 mm, thus potentially allowing better trigger manipulation and control for a greater number of shooters. Other standard features include the Short Reset <b>Trigger,</b> aggressive <b>grip</b> finish texture, and a new wrap-around, one-piece grip panel configuration. The gun was discontinued from the P226 model lineup at the end of 2010 but the E2-style grip system has been adopted on and carried over to other P226 variants.|$|R
50|$|A special {{muzzle brake}} was added that could absorb up to 40% of the recoil energy and an elastic butt stock with {{lamellar}} spring was non-rigidly {{attached to the}} receiver. The acoustics of the rifle were also improved by adding a sound suppressor. The other main improvements made to the SVU over the SVD include replacement of the butt stock, pistol <b>grip,</b> <b>trigger</b> and the mounting for the sight; and shortening the barrel by 100 mm achieved perfect balance for the weapon.|$|R
50|$|The Walther PPQ {{is not a}} true new design. It shares its {{engineering}} {{principles and}} main features with the Walther P99QA variant of the P99 pistol that was introduced in 1996. Many modifications compared to the Walther P99QA like the re-designed <b>grip,</b> <b>trigger</b> guard and slide with forward (big) serrations made their combined appearance in 2008 in the Walther P99 RAD, a P99 variant made in Poland and marketed as a military sidearm proposition and the Walther P99Q police pistol.|$|R
50|$|This {{has changed}} with the {{introduction}} of DA only, DAK, and SA only models. The DA only and DAK models do not have a de-cocking lever or safety, and the SA only models only feature an M1911 style external safety. SIG has also introduced the SAS (SIG Anti-Snag) model—which is dehorned, has no accessory rail, and is designed for concealed carry—and the Elite model, which includes the new short-reset <b>trigger,</b> a beavertail <b>grip,</b> front strap grip checkering, and front slide cocking serrations.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a bright}} flash, and a flake of plaster fell from the wall close behind Appleby’s shoulder, {{but even as the}} brown fingers {{tightened}} on the <b>trigger</b> again Harper <b>gripped</b> the young officer. He hove him bodily off his feet, and there was a yell from the Sin Verguenza as he flung him upon the grizzled sergeant. The man staggered, and the pair went down heavily in the corner. Then Harper, who tore one of his comrade’s rifles away from him, stood in front of them.|$|R
50|$|The overall weapon has a {{cylindrical}} body. It {{made the}} front of the air vents for cooling trunk. A tubular casing in a shop, serving also as the front handle, <b>trigger</b> and pistol <b>grip.</b> There is also a safety/selector switch, which can be translated into two points: first - for self-shooting, second - for the automatic. The barrel may be fitted with a silencer. There are several versions of weapons: pistol-machine gun under the bullet and the 38 ACP rifle with a wooden butt th of 9 mm bullets parabellum and the 38 ACP.|$|R
5000|$|A variant {{known as}} the FN Mle 1930 was {{developed}} in 7.65×53mm Belgian Mauser by FN Herstal and adopted by the Belgian Army. The Mle 1930 is basically a licensed copy of the Colt Automatic Machine Rifle, Model 1925 (R 75). The Mle 1930 had a different gas valve and a mechanical rate-reducing fire control mechanism designed by Dieudonne Saive, housed in the <b>trigger</b> guard/pistol <b>grip</b> housing. Some of these FN rate reducer mechanisms and pistol grip housings were later purchased by Springfield Armory for evaluation and possible adoption on a replacement for the M1918. The weapon also had a hinged shoulder plate and was adapted for use on a tripod mount. In 1932, Belgium adopted {{a new version of}} the FN Mle 1930 allocated the service designation FN Mle D (D—Demontable or [...] "removable") which had a quick-change barrel, shoulder rest and a simplified take-down method for eased cleaning and maintenance. The Mle D was produced even after World War II in versions adapted for [...]30-06 Springfield and NATO-standard 7.62×51mm ammunition.|$|R
50|$|The Remington Model 51 uses an {{internal}} hammer and features a single-action trigger. A unique combination lever {{on the rear}} of the grip-frame acts as a safety, bolt hold-open device and bolt release. This is in addition to the grip safety, magazine safety disconnect, and relatively heavy <b>trigger</b> pull. The <b>grips</b> are held on with spring-tensioned studs rather than screws. Not a single screw is used in the entire pistol. Pedersen was greatly concerned with human engineering and developing a comfortable grip angle for his pistol while not sacrificing the slim profile. Field stripping the pistol is cumbersome but not overly complicated and is mastered with practice.|$|R
50|$|Around 1993, an {{engineer}} and computer aided design (CAD) guru named Sandy Strayer joined Tripp Research, Inc. Tripp and Strayer revolutionized the 1911 market by designing a modular hi-capacity 1911 frame for IPSC shooters. While Para Ordnance already had a hi-capacity 1911 frame on the market, {{it was made of}} steel. The modular frame made use of a fiber-reinforced plastic which combined the <b>trigger</b> guard, <b>grip,</b> and integral magazine well. It used a proprietary grip which attached to the upper portion of the frame (a metal part that comprised the dust cover and frame rails). The result was that the modular frame weighed less than half of what the steel frame weighed. Further, while the Para frame feels notably larger than a standard 1911 in the hand, the STI feels similar to a regular 1911 since the grips are molded into the plastic of the frame rather than screwed to the outside. Tripp and Strayer were listed as the co-patent holders on the modular frame. Soon after the modular frame was introduced, the company name changed to STI (Strayer-Tripp, Inc.) and Strayer was given an equity stake in the new company.|$|R
50|$|After {{activating}} {{the power}} {{supply to the}} missile electronics, the gunner waits for electricity supply and gyros to stabilize, puts the sights on target and tracks it smoothly with the launch tube's iron sights, and pulls the <b>trigger</b> on the <b>grip</b> stock. This activates the seeker electronics and the missile attempts to lock onto the target. If the target is producing a strong enough signal and the angular tracking rate is within acceptable launch parameters, the missile alerts the gunner that the target is locked on by illuminating a light in the sight mechanism, and producing a constant buzzing noise. The operator then has 0.8 seconds to provide lead to the target while the missile's on-board power supply is activated and the throw-out motor ignited.|$|R
50|$|The M240H (formerly {{designated}} as the M240E5) is an improvement of the M240D, the M240H features a rail-equipped feed cover, an improved flash suppressor, and has been configured {{so that it can}} be more quickly converted to infantry standard using an Egress Kit. The M240H has an overall length of 41.6 in (1056.6 mm) with a 21.7 in (551.2 mm) barrel and weighs 26.3 lb empty, and has a rate of fire of 550-650 rounds per minute (RPM). The M240H entered service in 2004 on U.S. Army helicopters. It is equipped with dual spade <b>grips</b> and thumb-activated <b>trigger</b> systems, and can be quickly converted for dismounted infantry use via an egress components kit that includes a bipod and conventional pistol <b>grip</b> <b>trigger</b> module.|$|R
5000|$|The Remington MSR is a {{manually}} operated bolt-action weapon with a rotary locking bolt. To facilitate caliber change, the bolt {{is equipped with}} removable bolt heads, with bolt faces matched for appropriate calibers. Bolt heads have three radial locking lugs. The MSR rifle is built upon an aluminum alloy [...] "chassis", which hosts a compact receiver, adjustable <b>trigger</b> unit, pistol <b>grip,</b> and fully adjustable side-folding buttstock. The quick-change barrels are free-floated inside the tubular handguard which is provided {{with a number of}} user-installable Picatinny type accessory rails. The top of receiver also is fitted with monolithic Picatinny rail used to install sighting equipment (telescope sights or night vision sights). Additional equipment includes detachable folding bipod, and a quick-detachable suppressor which installs over the specially designed muzzle brake.|$|R

This type of holster is a Hollywood anachronism. Fast-draw artists can be {{distinguished}} from other movie cowboys because their guns will often be tied to their thigh. Long before holsters were steel-lined, they were soft and supple for comfortable all-day wear. A gunfighter would use tie-downs to keep his pistol from catching on the holster while drawing. Most of the time, gunfighters would just hide their pistols in their pockets and waistbands. Wild Bill Hickok popularized the butt-forward holster type, which worked better on horseback. Other gunfighters would use bridgeport rigs that gave a faster and easier draw. Revolvers were a popular weapon to gunfighters who were horsemen, cowboys, and lawmen because of their concealability and effectiveness on horseback. The Winchester rifle was also a popular weapon among gunfighters. Dubbed the [...] "Gun that Won the West", it was widely used during the settlement of the American frontier. Shotguns were also a popular weapon for [...] "express messengers" [...] and guards, especially those on stagecoaches and trains who {{were in charge of}} overseeing and guarding a valuable private shipment.|$|R
