5|$|Like other jays, {{this species}} is likely {{extremely}} intelligent. Similar species {{are known to}} use ants to keep their feathers clean, store seeds and nuts for later consumption, and use <b>their</b> <b>toes</b> to hold food. However, due to its secretive nature, these characteristics {{have not yet been}} observed in the species.|$|E
5|$|Most vertebrates—the amphibians, the {{reptiles}} {{and some}} mammals such as humans and bears—are plantigrade, {{walking on the}} whole of the underside of the foot. Many mammals, such as cats and dogs, are digitigrade, walking on <b>their</b> <b>toes,</b> the greater stride length allowing more speed. Digitigrade mammals are also often adept at quiet movement. Some animals such as horses are unguligrade, walking on the tips of <b>their</b> <b>toes.</b> This even further increases their stride length and thus their speed. A few mammals, namely the great apes, are also known to walk on their knuckles, at least for their front legs. Giant anteaters and platypuses are also knuckle-walkers. Some mammals are bipeds, using only two limbs for locomotion, which can be seen in, for example, humans and the great apes. Bipedal species have a larger field of vision than quadrupeds, conserve more energy and have the ability to manipulate objects with their hands, which aids in foraging. Instead of walking, some bipeds hop, such as kangaroos and kangaroo rats.|$|E
5|$|Pugs' {{legs are}} strong, straight, of {{moderate}} length, and are set well under. Their shoulders are moderately laid back. Their ankles are strong, their feet are small, <b>their</b> <b>toes</b> are well split-up, and their nails are black. The lower teeth normally protrude further than their upper, {{resulting in an}} under-bite.|$|E
50|$|In the film, Doyle robbed {{an armored}} truck {{and got his}} toe shot off while escaping. That {{sequence}} is entirely fictional; no member of the Sun Gym gang actually robbed an armored truck or had <b>their</b> <b>toe</b> shot off.|$|R

50|$|Social {{grooming}} in {{this species}} only occurs between mothers and infants, removing dead skin and parasites by scratching with <b>their</b> <b>toe</b> claws and licking their fur, avoiding their faces. Faces are cleaned by rubbing on branches {{and it is}} to reinforce social bonds.|$|R
5|$|Temperatures Rising {{returned}} to the ABC network on July 18, 1974 after a six-month hiatus. Its new time slot, Thursday nights at 8:00 PM, had previously been occupied by Chopper One, an adventure series. The situations presented this time around included Dr. Mercy saving {{the life of a}} popular country music singer (Dick Gautier), and setting up a surveillance system so that staff would be kept on <b>their</b> <b>toes.</b>|$|E
5|$|Arboreal frogs have pads {{located on}} the ends of <b>their</b> <b>toes</b> to help grip {{vertical}} surfaces. These are not suction pads, the surface consisting instead of columnar cells with flat tops with small gaps between them lubricated by mucous glands. When the frog applies pressure, the cells adhere to irregularities on the surface and the grip is maintained through surface tension. This allows the frog to climb on smooth surfaces, but the system does not function efficiently when the pads are excessively wet.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{perching}} bird. Any bird of {{the order}} Passeriformes, which includes {{more than half of}} all bird species. A notable feature of passerines compared to other orders of Aves is the arrangement of <b>their</b> <b>toes,</b> three pointing forward and one back, which facilitates perching. Sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds, the passerines form one of the most diverse terrestrial vertebrate orders, with over 5,000 identified species. The order has roughly twice as many species as Rodentia, the largest order of mammals. There are more than 110 families of passerine birds, the second-most of any tetrapods (after Squamata, the scaled reptiles).|$|E

5000|$|Both sexes have a {{white spot}} on the wing bow. They have {{feathered}} legs, especially in the cold season, for protection against cold. <b>Their</b> <b>toe</b> rows of small, elongated horn tacks provide a snowshoe effect {{that led to the}} German family name [...] "Rauhfußhühner", literally translated as [...] "rough feet chickens".|$|R

5|$|Maine Coons {{have several}} {{physical}} adaptations for survival in harsh winter climates. Their dense water-resistant fur is longer and shaggier on their underside and rear for extra protection {{when they are}} walking or {{sitting on top of}} wet surfaces of snow or ice. Their long and bushy raccoon-like tail is resistant to sinking in snow, and can be curled around their face and shoulders for warmth and protection from wind and blowing snow and it can even be curled around their backside like an insulated seat cushion when sitting down on a snow or ice surface. Large paws, and especially the extra-large paws of polydactyl Maine Coons, facilitate walking on snow and are often compared to snowshoes. Long tufts of fur growing between <b>their</b> <b>toes</b> help keep the toes warm and further aid walking on snow by giving the paws additional structure without significant extra weight. Heavily furred ears with extra long tufts of fur growing from inside help keep their ears warm.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{member of}} the family Equidae was the Hyracotherium, which lived between 45 and 55million years ago, during the Eocene period. It had 4toes on each front foot, and 3toes on each back foot. The extra toe on the front feet soon disappeared with the Mesohippus, which lived 32 to 37million years ago. Over time, the extra side toes shrank in size until they vanished. All that remains of them in modern horses is a set of small vestigial bones on the leg below the knee, known informally as splint bones. Their legs also lengthened as <b>their</b> <b>toes</b> disappeared until they were a hooved animal capable of running at great speed. By about 5million years ago, the modern Equus had evolved. Equid teeth also evolved from browsing on soft, tropical plants to adapt to browsing of drier plant material, then to grazing of tougher plains grasses. Thus proto-horses changed from leaf-eating forest-dwellers to grass-eating inhabitants of semi-arid regions worldwide, including the steppes of Eurasia and the Great Plains of North America.|$|E
5|$|The {{reproductive}} behaviour {{of the king}} vulture in the wild is poorly known, and much knowledge has been gained from observing birds in captivity, particularly at the Paris Menagerie. An adult king vulture sexually matures when it is {{about four or five}} years old, with females maturing slightly earlier than males. The birds mainly breed during the dry season. King vultures mate for life and generally lay a single unmarked white egg in its nest in a hollow in a tree. To ward off potential predators, the vultures keep their nests foul-smelling. Both parents incubate the egg for the 52 to 58 days before it hatches. If the egg is lost, it will often be replaced after about six weeks. The parents share incubating and brooding duties until the chick is about a week old, after which they often stand guard rather than brood. The young are semi-altricial—they are helpless when born but are covered in downy feathers (truly altricial birds are born naked), and their eyes are open at birth. Developing quickly, the chicks are fully alert by their second day, and able to beg and wriggle around the nest, and preen themselves and peck by their third day. They start growing their second coat of white down by day 10, and stand on <b>their</b> <b>toes</b> by day 20. From one to three months of age, chicks walk around and explore the vicinity of the nest, and take their first flights at about three months of age.|$|E
500|$|ExxonMobil's in situ {{technology}} (ExxonMobil Electrofrac) uses electrical heating {{with elements}} of both wall conduction and volumetric heating methods. It injects an electrically conductive material such as calcined petroleum coke into the hydraulic fractures created in the oil shale formation which then forms a heating element. [...] Heating wells are placed in a parallel row with a second horizontal well intersecting them at <b>their</b> <b>toe.</b> [...] This allows opposing electrical charges to be applied at either end.|$|R
50|$|The {{auditing}} {{and security}} engineering abilities have {{allowed it to}} obtain the Evaluation Assurance Level (EAL) 6 rating by the National Security Agency (NSA). The Target of Evaluation (TOE) Architecture in the Security Target for the evaluation excludes components such as those for file system and networking, from {{the definition of the}} TOE, focusing almost solely on the core kernel. Other operating systems, such as Windows or Linux, though evaluated at lower levels of assurance, generally include these abilities within <b>their</b> <b>TOE.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 1880 the American stage mentalist Washington Irving Bishop {{published}} a book revealing how mediums would use secret codes as the trick for their clairvoyant readings. The Seybert Commission {{was a group of}} faculty at the University of Pennsylvania who in 1884-1887 exposed fraudulent mediums such as Pierre L. O. A. Keeler and Henry Slade. The Fox sisters confessed to fraud in 1888. Margaret Fox revealed that she and her sister had produced the [...] "spirit" [...] rappings by cracking <b>their</b> <b>toe</b> joints.|$|R

50|$|In some senses, {{the process}} of {{diagnosis}} is always a matter of assessing {{the likelihood that a}} given condition is present in the patient. In a patient who presents with haemoptysis (coughing up blood), the haemoptysis is very {{much more likely to be}} caused by respiratory disease than by the patient having broken <b>their</b> <b>toe.</b> Each question in the history taking allows the medical practitioner to narrow down their view of the cause of the symptom, testing and building up their hypotheses as they go along.|$|R
2500|$|Modern Spiritualism {{had been}} {{initiated}} in 1848 in Hydeville, New York, by the Fox sisters, Katie and Margaret, aged 11 and 15, and had survived even their 1888 confession that forty years earlier they {{had caused the}} [...] "spirits'" [...] telegraph-like tapping sounds by snapping <b>their</b> <b>toe</b> joints. Spiritualist [...] "mediums" [...] in America and Europe claimed to communicate through tapping sounds with spirits of the dead, eliciting their secrets and conjuring up voices, music, noises and other antics, and occasionally working [...] "miracles" [...] such as levitation.|$|R
50|$|The Grand Prix offered step-in convenience; to put {{the binding}} on, the skier {{inserted}} <b>their</b> <b>toe</b> under the Nevada II, then stepped down at the heel. The sole of their boot would catch a small plate or rod extending {{from the bottom of}} the binding, rotating it until it flipped up to lie vertically behind the skier's leg. During this motion the roller would catch the sole of the boot and lock it into position. Like the Nevada toe, a strong force rotating the boot, this time forward, would cause the binding to release.|$|R
25|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief and artistic renditions, which depict the species as green, coquís {{commonly}} have a gray or gray-brown coloration. Unlike many frogs, coquís do not possess swimming membranes between their digits, and are not adapted to swimming. However, like all tree frogs, they possess small pads on the tips of <b>their</b> <b>toes</b> which help them adhere to moistened or slippery surfaces.|$|E
25|$|A pointe shoe {{is a type}} of shoe worn by ballet dancers when {{performing}} pointe work. Pointe {{shoes were}} conceived in response to the desire for dancers to appear weightless and sylph-like and have evolved to enable dancers to dance en pointe (on the tips of <b>their</b> <b>toes)</b> for extended periods of time. They are manufactured in a variety of colors, most commonly in shades of light pink.|$|E
25|$|After her {{appearance}} in All About Eve, Bates co-starred in Cheaper by the Dozen, and its sequel Belles on <b>Their</b> <b>Toes,</b> with Jeanne Crain and Myrna Loy. In 1951, she landed a role opposite MacDonald Carey and Claudette Colbert in the comedy Let's Make It Legal. She co-starred with Donna Reed as the love interests of Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis in the 1953 hit comedy The Caddy.|$|E
50|$|Toe tufts are {{commonly}} found on cats with medium to long coats. Clumps of fur that stick {{out at least}} 1-2 cm beyond the paw pad can be considered tufts. In addition to soft paw pads, toe tufts help a cat to silently stalk its prey by muffling excess noise. However, outdoor cats tend to lose <b>their</b> <b>toe</b> tufts due to excessive abrasion on the rougher outdoor surfaces. This is in distinct contrast to indoor cats who {{spend most of their}} time walking on carpet or smooth floors.|$|R

Mounting casualties (at least 100,000 since 1960, according to the novel) have sapped the German military, despite Hitler's statement (quoted in the novel) about a perpetual war to keep the German people on <b>their</b> <b>toes.</b> Dead German soldiers are returned to Germany {{in the middle of}} the night.|$|E
25|$|Tinamous prefer thick {{branches}} {{on which}} to roost as they do not clutch the branch with <b>their</b> <b>toes,</b> but rest on it with folded legs. They will reuse the same locations and avoid defecating nearby to avoid advertising the roost site to predators. The smaller forest species, along with the steppe tinamous, will roost on the ground, sometimes in the shelter of a bush. They will also use the same location repeatedly; known examples are the elegant crested and ornate tinamous.|$|E
25|$|As dance progressed {{into the}} 19th century, the {{emphasis}} on technical skill increased, as did the desire to dance en pointe {{without the aid of}} wires. When Marie Taglioni first danced La Sylphide en pointe, her shoes were nothing more than modified satin slippers; the soles were made of leather and the sides and toes were darned to help the shoes hold their shapes. Because the shoes of this period offered no support, dancers would pad <b>their</b> <b>toes</b> for comfort and rely on the strength of their feet and ankles for support.|$|E
50|$|For {{the most}} part, Pacific tree frogs are nocturnal, {{but they have}} been spotted during the day. These frogs {{spend a lot of time}} hiding under rotten logs, rocks, long grasses, and leaf litter, where they are very {{difficult}} to see unless they move. When they hunt, <b>their</b> <b>toe</b> pads allow them to climb on vegetation and other surfaces where they are to ambush their prey. Much of their diets consists of spiders, beetles, flies, ants, and other insects and arthropods; they can and do eat insects that are almost as large as they are, and will expand their bodies slightly to accommodate these meals.|$|R
50|$|Fringe-toed lizards are lizards of {{the genus}} Uma in the {{subfamily}} Phrynosomatinae, native to deserts of North America. They are adapted for life in sandy deserts with fringe-like scales on <b>their</b> hind <b>toes</b> hence <b>their</b> common name.|$|R
40|$|The Problem: Drop foot is the {{inability}} of an individual to lift their foot because of reduced or no muscle activity around their ankle. The major causes of drop foot are severing of the nerve, stroke, cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis. There are two common complications from drop foot. First, the individual cannot control the falling of their foot after heel strike, so that it slaps the ground on every step. This {{is referred to as}} slap foot. The second complication is {{the inability}} to clear <b>their</b> <b>toe</b> during swing. This causes the person to drag <b>their</b> <b>toe</b> on the ground throughout swing. Motivation: There three major motivations for this work. The first is the development of a method of helping millions of individuals with lower leg disabilities. The current project will be able to provide assistance to those with permanent disabilities, such as cerebral palsy, as well as those in rehabilitation. The creation of a tool to study the mechanics of normal and pathological human gait is a second driving factor. By placing this device on normal individuals, it is possible to see how they respond to external disturbances and analyze the human motor control system. Finally, laying down the first step to develop a full bio-suit or full body orthosis that would allow anyone, including paraplegics to walk normally. Previous Work: The assistive devices for this pathology are Ankle Foot Orthoses (AFO). The standard AFO is a rigid polypropylene structure that prevents any ankle motion. Several studies have analyzed other designs tha...|$|R
