25|$|Fujiyama {{inadvertently}} attracted {{attention in}} 2000 after an article {{was published in}} the journal Neurology. The article discussed the possible relationship between riding roller coasters and the occurrence of subdural hematomas. The primary case study cited by the authors was a woman who had reported severe headaches after riding several roller coasters at Fuji-Q Highland (including Fujiyama). Upon investigation, it was discovered <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> did in fact have a subdural hematoma. Subsequent research, however, has maintained that this risk remains low and is not unique to this particular coaster.|$|E
25|$|Now imagine <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> {{grows up}} and has {{children}} with a brown-haired man who also has a Bb genotype. Her eggs will be a mixture of two types, one sort containing the B allele, and one sort the b allele. Similarly, her partner will produce a mix of two types of sperm containing {{one or the other}} of these two alleles. When the transmitted genes are joined up in their offspring, these children have a chance of getting either brown or red hair, since they could get a genotype of BB = brown hair, Bb = brown hair or bb = red hair. In this generation, there is therefore a chance of the recessive allele showing itself in the phenotype of the children—some of them may have red hair like their grandfather.|$|E

25|$|The thirteenthfourteenth-century Chronicle of Mann {{reveals that}} Guðrøðr's mother, Affraic, was a {{daughter}} of Fergus, Lord of Galloway (died 1161). Several contemporary sources concerning Fergus' descendants suggest that {{he was married to}} an illegitimate daughter of Henry I, and <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> was the mother of at least some of his offspring, including Affraic herself. Although the union between Guðrøðr's parents is not dated in contemporary sources, it appears to have been arranged in the 1130s or 1140s. The marital alliance forged between Óláfr and Fergus gave the Crovan dynasty valuable familial-connections with the English Crown, {{one of the most powerful}} monarchies in western Europe. As for Fergus, the union bound Galloway more tightly to a neighbouring kingdom from which an invasion had been launched during the overlordsship of Magnús. The alliance with Óláfr also ensured Fergus the protection of one of Britain's most formidable fleets, and further gave him a valuable ally outwith the orbit of the Scottish Crown.|$|E
25|$|Lucas could {{possibly}} {{be involved in the}} murders of two young unidentified people found in Sumter County, South Carolina in 1976. Lucas stated that he had been in South Carolina {{on the day of the}} crime. Lucas is also suspected in the death of another unidentified victim, the New Castle County Jane Doe, who was discovered in June 1977. He had described a crime scene similar to the one <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> was found. Yet another unidentified victim was discovered in 1980, that of the Walker County Jane Doe. It was initially believed that Lucas was responsible for both her murder and sexual assault. However, a bite mark on the girl's shoulder has not been confirmed to match Lucas's dental charts. Lucas confessed to the murder of a young woman found in 1981 in Corona, California that had been buried near a freeway, citing he had met her in the town of Riverside.|$|E
25|$|The {{portrait}} of Aline was painted in tempera on linen, as {{were those of}} the two girls. It has a height of 40cm and a width 32.5cm. Below the painted cloth, scraps of linen pressed onto the mummy's face were used to provide an even surface, so that the portrait is nearly flat. Some of the portraits were painted before {{the death of their}} subject, but in Aline's case, where it is actually painted {{on the end of the}} mummy wrapping, it appears to have been produced after death, perhaps based on a previously prepared portrait. As is common for mummy portraits, the painting produces the impression of three-dimensional depth, a relatively recent feature in Egyptian art and due to Graeco-Roman influences. Frontal depictions of human faces had also been unusual throughout most of the history of Egyptian art. The wavy hairstyle with a central parting is painted simply, but carefully. The small ringlets above the forehead are striking. The face appears full, but not fat. It conveys the impression <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman,</b> who belonged to the middle or upper levels of Egyptian society, had led a good life. Her simple jewellery is carefully painted. The depiction of the necklace made of gilded plaster, added to the portrait. Aline wears a white tunica or chiton, thin lilac bands (clavus) run across her shoulder. The colours are warm. The sad, wistful gaze is typical of mummy portraits. Altogether, it is a masterful {{portrait of}} a middle-aged woman.|$|E

It has long been her defining characteristic. If it occasionally makes her into a caricature, it has also unquestionably established {{that she would have}} an abortion in this circumstance." [...] Talking about Yang's abortion in the eighth season, Rhimes explained she intended Yang to have an abortion already in the second season but changed it with an ectopic pregnancy at the suggestion of one of her writers because [...] "that was so much more interesting, story-wise". As for the abortion in the eighth season, Rhimes commented: [...] "I really wanted Cristina Yang to stay true to who Cristina Yang is. And I feel like that is a character who has never really wanted to be a mother. The idea <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> would have a child that she did not want and resented for ruining her career and resented Owen for making her have [...] would have been hideous.

500|$|Another {{source of}} the musical is the eighth story, [...] "Our Heroine", which is thematically paired with the 12th, [...] "A Boar's Tooth", as both involve American {{encounters}} with local cultures. [...] "Our Heroine" [...] tells of the romance between Navy nurse Nellie Forbush, from rural Arkansas, and a wealthy, sophisticated planter, [...] Frenchman Emile De Becque. [...] After {{falling in love with}} Emile, Nellie (who is introduced briefly in story #4, [...] "An Officer and a Gentleman") learns that Emile has eight daughters, out of wedlock, with several local women. Michener tells us that [...] "any person... who was not white or yellow was a nigger" [...] to Nellie, and while she is willing to accept two of the children (of French-Asian descent) who remain in Emile's household, she is taken aback by the other two girls who live there, evidence that the planter had cohabited with a darker Polynesian woman. To her great relief, she learns <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> is dead, but Nellie endangers her relationship with Emile when she is initially unable to accept Emile's [...] "nigger children." [...] Nellie overcomes her feelings and returns to spend her life with her plantation owner.|$|E

500|$|Hill {{started to}} {{participate}} in climbing competitions in the mid-1980s, but {{one of her first}} significant accomplishments was in 1979. She became the first person to free climb Ophir Broke in Ophir, Colorado, which has a difficulty rating of 5.12d and was the hardest route ever climbed by a woman at that time. It was the hardest crack climb in Colorado at the time and there were only one or two harder ones in Yosemite. Long was amazed by her feat. He has said [...] "that's when I knew for certain <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> had extraordinary talent". The regional guidebook credits Long with the first free ascent of the route; Hill speculates {{the reason for this is}} that at the time she was an unknown climber and known only as Long's partner and protege. In her autobiography, Hill explains that it was during this climb that she realized it is not a person's size or strength but ability to be creative on the rock that is important: [...] "The big lesson for me... was to realize that despite what appeared to be a limitation due to my small stature, I could create my own method of getting past a difficult section of rock. John's size and power enabled him to make long reaches and explosive lunge moves that were completely out of my range. I, on the other hand, often found small intermediate holds that John couldn't even imagine gripping... Short or tall, man or woman, the rock is an objective medium that is equally open for interpretation by all." ...|$|E
500|$|On October 18, 2016, an {{anonymous}} woman sued Michael Jackson's Estate, MJJ Productions and MJJ Ventures, alleging {{she had been}} sexually-abused by Jackson when she was 12-15, from 1986-1989 in Jackson's Encino home, hotels, the [...] "Smooth Criminal" [...] set, the [...] "Moonwalker" [...] movie set, {{in the back of}} his limousine, his Neverland Ranch, and an apartment/condo he nicknamed [...] "The Hideout". She provided letters, love notes allegedly written by Jackson, multiple gifts apparently given by Jackson, a jacket he supposedly gave to her after an Album photo-shoot, checks given to her from 1990-1993 totaling $920,000 sent from Michael Jackson, MJJ Ventures, and MJJ Productions—coming directly from Jackson's back-accounts, and a 1993 Santa Barbara PD letter alleging that the Police Department concluded she [...] "knew all about Child Abuse" [...] to come in and speak to them, regarding their investigation. Her complaint alleges that she never considered her emotional/psychological injuries to be a result of her sexual activities with Jackson until she reflected on those experiences for the first time in September 2016, and that even if she had wanted to she could not possibly come forward earlier because she was threatened with physical harm if she ever told anyone, told that she would get in trouble with law enforcement and go to jail if she did, and that Jackson made her promise not to tell anyone. A lawyer for the Businesses dismissed the allegations saying, [...] "This is yet another attempt to hit the lottery by suing the estate of Michael Jackson more than seven years after Michael's death and close to 30 years after these incidents supposedly occurred. We believe this claim was created from whole cloth and is without any merit. It's also no coincidence <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>woman</b> is represented by the same attorneys involved in two other frivolous claims against the estate." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the phone}} call, Saccà expresses words of impassioned {{political}} support to Berlusconi and criticises the behaviour of Berlusconi's allies. Berlusconi urges Saccà to broadcast a telefilm series which was strongly advocated by his ally Umberto Bossi.

After the publication of these wiretaps, Berlusconi has been accused by other politicians and by some journalists of political corruption through the exploitation of prostitution. Berlusconi said, in his own defence: [...] "In the entertainment world everybody knows that, in certain situations in RAI TV you work only if you prostitute yourself or if you are leftist. I have intervened on behalf of some personalities who are not leftists and have been completely set apart by RAI TV."
