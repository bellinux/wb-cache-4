500|$|The Frighteners was {{released}} in the United States in 1,675 theaters, and opened at #5, earning $5,565,495 during its opening weekend, averaging $3,335 per theater. The film eventually grossed a worldwide total of $29,359,216. The Frighteners ended up being a box office disappointment, mostly due to competition from Independence Day; in interviews conducted years after The Frighteners release, Jackson commented he was disappointed by Universal's ubiquitous marketing campaign, including a poster which [...] "didn't tell you anything about the picture", which he believed was the primary reason the film was not a financial success. Additionally, the film opened {{on the same day}} the Atlanta Summer Olympics began; when Jackson realized this and told the studio, they answered [...] "'We don't think so; our research indicates that's not the case...' And I just <b>thought</b> <b>how</b> the hell do they know? There had only ever been three Olympic Games held in the United States in one hundred years!" [...] Jackson acknowledged The Frighteners tone made it hard to pigeon-hole and sell, and his experience on the film made him understand the importance of marketing.|$|E

If you hate it, {{you can take it}} off'. It was just like that, casual and cool." [...] Annie from the London Community Gospel Choir provided the female background vocals throughout the song. Madonna also mentioned that new versions would be [...] "coming out, but just not yet". Describing the song as [...] "one of [...] more mellow productions", Madonna composed [...] "Living for Love" [...] as a break-up song, commenting, [...] "lots of people write about being in love and being happy or they write about having a broken heart and being inconsolable. But nobody writes about having a broken heart and being hopeful and triumphant afterwards. So I <b>thought,</b> <b>how</b> can I do this? I didn't want to share the sentiment of being a victim. This scenario devastated me, but it just made me stronger". She complemented saying that [...] "Living for Love" [...] was [...] "kind of like the old me and the new me all mixed in together".|$|E
500|$|Collins first {{performed}} with Sting at Wembley, {{and together they}} performed [...] "In the Air Tonight", [...] "Against All Odds", [...] "Long Long Way to Go" [...] and [...] "Every Breath You Take", accompanied by saxophonist Branford Marsalis. After Collins finished performing, he flew on Concorde to the Live Aid show in Philadelphia. On the plane, he met Cher, and convinced {{her to be a}} part of the event. Once there he met Robert Plant, who had asked him if he would perform with him, Jimmy Page and Tony Thompson in a Led Zeppelin [...] "reunion" [...] of sorts. He first played drums on [...] "Layla", [...] "White Room" [...] and [...] "She's Waiting" [...] for friend Eric Clapton. Then, Collins performed [...] "Against All Odds" [...] and [...] "In the Air Tonight", and finished the night playing drums for Led Zeppelin's aforementioned act. The band has claimed that the performance was unspectacular, and critics place the blame on Collins. However, Collins says that [...] "I would pledge to my dying day that it wasn't me," [...] and that Thompson was racing through some of the performance. Collins later remarked, [...] "... I remember in the middle of the thing, I actually <b>thought,</b> <b>How</b> do I get out of here?" [...] Stephen Williams of Newsday commented that Collins' performance of [...] "In the Air Tonight" [...] in Philadelphia [...] "was one of the more moving moments of the day". Live Aid raised $69 million in its effort. Collins later recalled the event as [...] "extraordinary".|$|E
500|$|When {{asked about}} Barris's claim {{of being a}} CIA assassin, Clooney commented, [...] "I don't know how much I {{believed}} it. I didn't want to officially ask him, because I didn't want him to say, 'I made it up.' I wanted {{to tell the story}} and I <b>thought</b> <b>how</b> interesting, if it was all made up, why someone as wealthy and as successful as Chuck Barris would have to do that. I thought that was an interesting person to explore, and that's {{what we wanted to do}} with the film." [...] (Barris had already admitted he had made the story up in a 1984 interview promoting the book; he wrote the story in large part because he had been exiled from television over the controversy surrounding one of his shows, 3's a Crowd. In the same interview, Barris noted that he had applied for work with the CIA in the early 1960s but never actually entered the agency; Confessions of a Dangerous Mind was the product of Barris imagining how he could have done both at the same time.) Clooney acknowledged that his upbringing with father Nick Clooney had a great bearing on his choice of depicting the 1960/70s game shows. [...] "My father had a game show when I was growing up called The Money Maze. I know what those sets look like. I showed the guy how to do cue cards. I grew up on them," [...] the director reflected, [...] "and knew what it looked like and smelled like. And I know something about some of the trappings of fame, so I thought I had a unique take on it." ...|$|E

[...] "I wanted my villain to have a 'mask,' but {{be able to talk}} and taunt and threaten. So I thought of him being burned and scarred." [...] He also felt the killer should use something other than a knife, which was too common. [...] "So I <b>thought,</b> <b>How</b> about a glove with steak knives?

2500|$|In 1969, Haggard {{released}} [...] "Okie From Muskogee," [...] with lyrics ostensibly {{reflecting the}} singer's {{pride in being}} from Middle America where people are conventionally patriotic, don't smoke marijuana, don't take LSD, don't protest by burning draft cards or otherwise challenge authority. In the ensuing years, Haggard gave varying statements regarding whether he intended the song as a humorous satire or a serious political statement in support of conservative values. In a 2001 interview, Haggard called the song a [...] "documentation of the uneducated that lived in America at the time." [...] However, he made several other statements suggesting that he meant the song seriously. On the Bob Edwards Show, he said, [...] "I wrote it when I recently {{got out of the}} joint. I knew {{what it was like to}} lose my freedom, and I was getting really mad at these protesters. They didn't know anything more about the war in Vietnam than I did. I <b>thought</b> <b>how</b> my dad, who was from Oklahoma, would have felt. I felt I knew how those boys fighting in Vietnam felt." [...] In the country music documentary series Lost Highway, he elaborated: [...] "My dad passed away when I was nine, and I don't know if you've ever thought about somebody you've lost and you say, 'I wonder what so-and-so would think about this?' I was drivin' on Interstate 40 and I saw a sign that said '19 Miles to Muskogee.' Muskogee was always referred to in my childhood as 'back home.' So I saw that sign and my whole childhood flashed before my eyes and I thought, 'I wonder what dad would think about the youthful uprising that was occurring at the time, the Janis Joplins.... I understood 'em, I got along with it, but what if he was to come alive at this moment? And I thought, what a way to describe the kind of people in America that are still sittin' in the center of the country sayin', 'What is goin' on on these campuses?'" [...] In the American Masters documentary about him, he said, [...] "That's how I got into it with the hippies.... I thought they were unqualified to judge America, and I thought they were lookin' down their noses at something that I cherished very much, and it pissed me off. And I thought, 'You sons of bitches, you've never been restricted away from this great, wonderful country, and yet here you are in the streets bitchin' about things, protesting about a war that they didn't know any more about than I did. They weren't over there fightin' that war any more than I was." ...|$|E

Results from 3 scenario studies indicate that counterfactual content overlapped primarily with <b>thoughts</b> of <b>how</b> an outcome might have been prevented (preventability ascriptions) rather than with <b>thoughts</b> of <b>how</b> it might have been caused (causal ascriptions). Counterfactuals and preventability ascriptions focused mainly on controllable antecedents, whereas causal ascriptions focused mainly on antecedents that covaried with the target outcome over a focal set of instances. Contrary to current theorizing, causal ascriptions were unrelated to counterfactual content (Study 3). Results indicate that the primary criterion used to recruit causal ascriptions (covariation) differs from that used to recruit counterfactuals (controllability) ...|$|R
