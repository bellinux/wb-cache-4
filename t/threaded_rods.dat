If the outer nut is torqued more than the inner nut, the inner nut may loosen up.|$|E

5000|$|The Snowboard Shelf - The {{contestant}}s {{must take}} four snowboards {{and build a}} shelf out of them. Each contestant is given at random one of five different shelf designs, which they must follow. Angela's shelves are assembled with <b>threaded</b> <b>rods,</b> Cory's shelves are ceiling mounted, Simon's shelves are a corner unit that is supported with <b>threaded</b> <b>rods</b> {{on one side and}} a board on the other, Deen's a [...] "pagoda-style" [...] unit, and Matt's design is a more conventional shelf supported by wood and dado joints on both sides. Cory is initially frustrated with the fact that his shelves run perpendicular to how the ceiling joists are run. He uses one snowboard as strapping, but hanging the other three snowboards causes him to get frustrated and fail. Angela fails after trying to notch the room's baseboards with a chainsaw near an electrical outlet in order to make room for the lowest shelf, though her shelf is also not attached to the wall. Deen, after staring at a [...] "dry fit" [...] for some time and not noticing that one shelf bows as a result, manages to fix his error and finish his shelf without Doug's assistance. As for Matt, he uses his snowboards upside down for his shelves, which promptly earns him a fail when his shelves start to bow under a weight test. Simon had arguably the most complicated design, but he manages, with Joey's assistance, to guide it to a pass.|$|E

50|$|Most {{motorcycles}} of {{this period}} tensioned the primary chain by drawing or rotating the gearbox backwards on a hinge with <b>threaded</b> <b>rods,</b> this was known as pre-unit construction. The first A7 had a fixed gearbox, bolted {{to the back of}} the crankcase, and an internal tensioner for the duplex primary chain. This gave it the appearance of unit construction and pioneered the system later used in unit-construction engines such as the BSA C15, BSA B40, Triumph 3TA and so on. However, in 1954 a re-design reverted to the older system. The electrics (as was universal for larger British motorcycles of the period) consisted of two independent systems, the very reliable and self-contained Lucas magneto, with a dynamo generator to charge the battery and provide lights. Carburation was a single Amal remote float Type 6 until 1955 when it was upgraded to a 376 Monobloc.|$|E
