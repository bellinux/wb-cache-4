Krusty is encouraged by them into making a comeback, and they inform him that they met an agent that can help him out. However, when <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>go</b> to Annie's office, Annie instantly recognizes Krusty and angrily slams the door before he {{gets a chance to}} enter. It is revealed that Annie was the one who discovered Krusty, became his first agent, and was responsible for his rise to success. They also had a romantic relationship together. However, once he achieved fame, Krusty fired Annie and replaced her with a more acclaimed agent, and as a result their relationship ended. Back in the present, he begs her to take him back as a client, and she eventually accepts.|$|E

500|$|Probably in {{many respects}} most of the songs [...] are [...] But in more of an {{unconscious}} way. I don't really think about telling personal stories when I'm writing music. It just comes.

500|$|In Pinafore, Sullivan {{exploits}} minor keys for comic effect, {{for instance}} in [...] "Kind Captain, I've important information". Further, he achieves a musical surprise when he uses the subdominant minor in [...] "Sorry her lot". The musicologist Gervase Hughes {{was impressed with the}} introduction to the opening chorus which includes [...] "a rousing nautical tune... in a key of no nonsense, C major... a modulation to the mediant minor, where to our surprise a plaintive oboe gives us the first verse of [...] "Sorry her lot" [...] in 2/4 [...] After this closes on the local dominant B major the violins (still in 2/4) introduce us to Little Buttercup... meeting her under these conditions one would hardly expect her to blossom out later as a queen of the waltz." [...] He continues, [...] "the bassoon and basses... assert vigorously who is the Captain of the Pinafore... in the improbable key of A flat minor.... Buttercup makes a last despairing attempt to make herself heard in D flat minor, but the others have never known that such an outlandish key existed. So in a flash <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>go</b> back to C major on a good old 6/4".|$|E
500|$|With Interview magazine, Madonna {{explained}} her inspirations {{behind the}} songs and the music of Hard Candy. She said that [...] "probably in many respects most of the songs [...] are [...] But in more of an unconscious way. I don't really think about telling personal stories when I'm writing music. It just comes. And {{then a lot of}} times, six months later, eight months later, I go, 'Oh, that's what I wrote that song about.' But that's when I play the song for lots of people and <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>go,</b> 'Oh, I can totally relate to that.'" [...] "Candy Shop" [...] is the opening track of the album. Produced by Williams, the song uses the word candy as a metaphor for sex. Williams said, [...] "We were just in a studio, [...] and [...] was like, 'Look, give me some hot shit.' I was looking at her like, 'She's saying hot shit?' She was like, 'What?' And I'm like, 'OK.' So we just worked and made it." [...] The first single from the album, [...] "4 Minutes", was initially known as [...] "4 Minutes to Save the World". The song's development was motivated by a sense of urgency to save the planet from destruction, and how people can enjoy themselves in the process. According to Madonna, the song inspired her to produce the documentary I Am Because We Are. The song features vocals by Timberlake and Timbaland. An uptempo dance song with an urban, hip hop style, it also incorporates Timbaland's bhangra beats. The instrumentation used in the song includes brass, foghorns and cow bells. The song's lyrics carry a message of social awareness, inspired by Madonna's visit to Africa and the human suffering she witnessed.|$|E

2500|$|It was the Panchatantra {{that served}} {{as the basis for the}} studies of Theodor Benfey, the pioneer in the field of {{comparative}} literature. His efforts began to clear up some confusion surrounding the history of the Panchatantra, culminating in the work of Hertel ( [...] , , [...] ) and [...] Hertel discovered several recensions in India, in particular the oldest available Sanskrit recension, the Tantrakhyayika in Kashmir, and the so-called North Western Family Sanskrit text by the Jain monk Purnabhadra in 1199 CE that blends and rearranges at least three earlier versions. Edgerton undertook a minute study of all texts which seemed [...] "to provide useful evidence on the lost Sanskrit text to which, it must be assumed, <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>go</b> back", and believed he had reconstructed the original Sanskrit Panchatantra; this version is known as the Southern Family text.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{their work}} is {{visually}} impressive and often controversial {{as a result of}} its scale, the artists have repeatedly denied that their projects contain any deeper meaning than their immediate aesthetic impact. The purpose of their art, they contend, is simply to create works of art for joy and beauty and to create new ways of seeing familiar landscapes. Art critic David Bourdon has described Christo's wrappings as a [...] "revelation through concealment." [...] To his critics Christo replies, [...] "I am an artist, and I have to have courage... Do you know that I don't have any artworks that exist? [...] <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>go</b> away when they're finished. [...] Only the preparatory drawings, and collages are left, giving my works an almost legendary character. I think it takes much greater courage to create things to be gone than to create things that will remain." ...|$|E
2500|$|Parker {{gradually}} introduced Transcendentalist {{ideas into}} his sermons. He tempered his radicalism with diplomacy and discretion, however. “I preach abundant heresies,” {{he wrote to}} a friend, “and <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>go</b> down—for the listeners {{do not know how}} heretical they are.” For years he had wrestled with the factuality of the Hebrew Scriptures, and by 1837 he was wishing “some wise man would now write a book…and show up the absurdity of…the Old Testament miracles, prophecies, dreams, miraculous births, etc.’” He was hardly alone. “‘What shall we do with the Old Testament?’ asked James Walker in 1838. ‘That question is of such frequent recurrence among laymen as well as clergymen, that any well-considered attempt to answer it, or supply the means of answering it, is almost sure of hearty welcome." [...] Questions regarding biblical realism and meaning, and the answers clergy increasingly found through the German-based higher criticism, formed the basis of liberal Christianity as it emerged and developed throughout the nineteenth century.|$|E
2500|$|Upon his return, Reavis visited New York {{to renew}} his acquaintances with various {{political}} and business leaders. [...] Showing his recently acquired documents to these luminaries netted Reavis several useful endorsements. [...] James Broadhead, who in 1884 believed the claim would be denied, followed his examination [...] by proclaiming, [...] "The Peralta claim has been submitted to Mr. Conkling, Mr. Ingersoll and Mr. Hurd who have pronounced it good. [...] I have {{associated with them}} in the case and my opinion coincides with theirs. [...] Mr. J. Addison Reavis is the gentleman who is pushing the claim and his is a man of remarkable energy and persistence." [...] Roscoe Conkling in turn stated [...] "I can say, however, that having been consulted ... and having made a somewhat careful examination of the ancient papers and other papers produces, of which there are many, and on the facts and history of the case, I find <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>go</b> to show Mrs. Reavis to be the person she believes herself to be, namely the lineal descendant of the original grantee." [...] In addition to the endorsement, Conkling introduced Reavis to Robert G. Ingersoll. [...] Ingersoll was so impressed by Peralta papers that he agreed to represent Reavis in his efforts to have the new claim confirmed.|$|E

2500|$|People, Montag {{described}} Superficial as [...] "a fun, empowering {{mix that}} you could really dance to." [...] Montag later described the album to MTV as [...] "...different.

Some are a little bit edgier, but <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>go</b> together in some way. It's like a group of rocks. They're all rocks, but they're so different." [...] The first song, [...] "Look How I'm Doing", is described as a [...] "kiss off to a former flame", while [...] "Blackout" [...] ( [...] written by Taylor Momsen [...] ) is an ode to Montag's husband, Spencer Pratt. [...] "Turn Ya Head" [...] {{has been described as a}}n uptempo track with [...] "electronic" [...] influences. The song has also been described as [...] "urban pop". [...] "Fanatic" [...] is an uptempo song with [...] "an 80's feel", and has been compared to works by Kylie Minogue. Title track [...] "Superficial" [...] sees Montag singing about her public image, over a [...] "dancefloor" [...] beat, while aiming at Montag's critics. [...] "More Is More" [...] has been described as a [...] "club hit", as well as [...] "loud and intense." ...|$|E
2500|$|However {{influential}} Malfatti's debut {{into the}} Modernist art scene was in Brazil, her later pieces of work seem {{to revert to}} an older and more serene style. No longer are her pieces shocking or with as intense of a mixture of Cubism and Impressionism. Her painting O Canal e a Ponta done in the 1940s {{is not nearly as}} stunning in style or character as The Idiot. The brush-strokes are much smaller and identical in relation to one another. <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>go</b> in the same direction, merely seen as a transitory means for color to be expressed. Malfatti's color palette is much less stunning as well. Although the colors in the painting are still lovely, they lack the vivid contrast which makes The Idiot so memorable. Instead of playing off of opposite colors, O Canal e a Ponta is one swell of deep shades that vary slightly from light reflections. The painting is still beautiful, it is simply much more traditional. The style is much more reminiscent of a toned down expressionism and does not utilise any qualities of Cubism which made her first pieces so planarly abstract. Even the subject matter is much more traditional and [...] "European". It is a very tranquil setting of a bridge over a river with two trees on its sides a set of houses down the way and a serene sky. It is very harmonious but lacking in zest which would make her painting unique.|$|E
2500|$|Arriving in the Underworld, Emma is {{contacted}} by Neal Cassidy, who warns to turn back, advice Emma chooses to ignore. She {{and the others}} later discover that the Underworld is for those with unfinished business, and they decide to help others move on, while they search for Hook. With the help of Hook's ex-girlfriend Milah, Emma manages to retrieve Hook from Hades's captivity. However, she is unable to split her heart, as Hades has decided that she, Regina, and Snow are to remain behind for freeing the souls of Prince Henry, Hercules, and Megara. It is discovered {{that the only way}} they would have a chance to return to the [...] "Overworld" [...] with Hook is by overthrowing Hades. In order to defeat Hades, Emma and Hook receive help from Hook's brother Liam; however, it is soon discovered that Liam betrayed them after being blackmailed by Hades. Fortunately, Henry agrees to help undo Liam's work by using his powers as the Author. Later, when Emma and Hook try to perform the heartsplit, they are informed by Hades that Hook's body has been dead for too long and is decaying, making him unable to come back to life. When Emma and Hook go into the depths of the Underworld to find ambrosia, something that would save Hook, they are faced with a True Love test, which they pass when Emma chooses Hook over her own heart, only to realize that Hades had tricked them and destroyed the ambrosia, and Hook tells Emma to leave him in the Underworld, as time is running out for her to go through the open portal. Emma objects, saying that she came to the Underworld to save Hook, and she wasn't leaving without him. Hook eventually gets her to say her goodbyes and she does, only to find out that Hades had trapped her and her family in the library using magic. Emma and Regina work together to use their own magic to counteract it. <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>go</b> through the portal, and while Emma has second thoughts about leaving Hook, she is persuaded to go by her father. When they get back to Storybrooke, Zelena is informed by Regina and Robin that Hades tried to trap them in the Underworld, but she brushes off the information and is upset with her sister. She talks to Hades about having the life she wants, which is just a simple picket fence life. However, Hades wants a whole kingdom. Robin and Regina break into the mayor's house, where Zelena and Hades are, trying to get Robin's daughter back from Zelena. Emma, distraught and unable to grieve Hook's death, tries to break down the protection spell surrounding the house, but Zelena uses her magic to stop her. Hades is about to use the Olympian Crystal to [...] "end" [...] Regina, but Robin steps in front of her, taking the blow, which kills him. Hades tries to pressure Zelena into killing Regina, but she stabs Hades instead.|$|E
