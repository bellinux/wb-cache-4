5|$|Arriving in 1986, {{the crew}} finds their ship's power drained. Hiding their ship in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park using its {{cloaking}} device, the crew split up to accomplish several tasks: Admiral James T. Kirk and Spock attempt to locate humpback whales, while Montgomery Scott, Leonard McCoy, and Hikaru Sulu construct a tank {{to hold the}} whales <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> {{a return to the}} 23rd century. Uhura and Pavel Chekov are tasked to find a nuclear reactor, whose energy leakage will enable their ship's power to be restored.|$|E
5|$|Phineas and his stepbrother Ferb {{learn from}} their friend Baljeet that a tool <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> their latest project {{has yet to be}} invented. They and their friend Isabella borrow the time machine on display at the local museum to travel twenty years into the future. Once they arrive, Isabella stays behind with the time machine while the boys enter their sister Candace's backyard, where her sons Fred and Xavier are sitting under a tree doing nothing. The boys {{convince}} their future nephews to be active and in return are given the tool they need. As they leave, Candace spots them and it brings back upsetting memories of never being able to bust the boys. She takes her mother Linda to the museum where the boys leave, right before Linda can see them.|$|E
5|$|The {{geographic}} {{distribution of}} malaria within large regions is complex, and malaria-afflicted and malaria-free areas are often found {{close to each}} other. Malaria is prevalent in tropical and subtropical regions because of rainfall, consistent high temperatures and high humidity, along with stagnant waters in which mosquito larvae readily mature, providing them with the environment <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> continuous breeding. In drier areas, outbreaks of malaria have been predicted with reasonable accuracy by mapping rainfall. Malaria {{is more common in}} rural areas than in cities. For example, several cities in the Greater Mekong Subregion of Southeast Asia are essentially malaria-free, but the disease is prevalent in many rural regions, including along international borders and forest fringes. In contrast, malaria in Africa is present in both rural and urban areas, though the risk is lower in the larger cities.|$|E

25|$|The IPEC's work to {{eliminate}} child labour {{is an important}} facet of the ILO's Decent Work Agenda. Child labour not only prevents children from acquiring the skills and education <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> a better future, it also perpetuates poverty and affects national economies through losses in competitiveness, productivity and potential income.|$|E

25|$|Coral reefs support many {{symbiotic}} relationships. In particular, zooxanthellae provide {{energy to}} coral {{in the form}} of glucose, glycerol, and amino acids. Zooxanthellae can provide up to 90% of a coral’s energy requirements. In return, as an example of mutualism, the corals shelter the zooxanthellae, averaging one million for every cubic centimeter of coral, and provide a constant supply of the carbon dioxide <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> photosynthesis.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{secondary}} plot about another scientist seeking to undermine Murray's work. This {{comes into play}} as Santiago and Murray attempt to source the equipment <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> their experiment. Ultimately and perhaps predictably, the entire scheme ends up in danger of falling apart and that's when the creativity in the film shines. The character work and script development keep the characters moving along their dramatic arch in a funny and unique way.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, {{due to a}} lack {{of action}} by all the state governments, the Supreme Court ordered the state governments to report to it why the reform {{measures}} outlined were not implemented. After being questioned in front of the judges of the Supreme Court, the state governments are finally starting to reform the police forces and give them the operational independence <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> fearless and proper law enforcement. Tamil Nadu Police has been in the forefront of application of the new referendum.|$|E

25|$|Mosquito {{mouthparts}} {{are very}} specialized, {{particularly those of}} the females, which in most species are adapted to piercing skin and then sucking blood. Apart from bloodsucking, the females generally also drink assorted fluids rich in dissolved sugar, such as nectar and honeydew, to obtain the energy <b>they</b> <b>need.</b> <b>For</b> this, their blood-sucking mouthparts are perfectly adequate. In contrast, male mosquitoes are not bloodsuckers; they only drink sugary fluids. Accordingly, their mouthparts do not require {{the same degree of}} specialization as those of females.|$|E
25|$|They did, however, {{find some}} of his equipment. Two tanks known to belong to McDaniel were found near the {{entrance}} to the cave. But this discovery struck some searchers as inconsistent with Ben's supposed intent to explore the cave he was technically not permitted to enter. Most cave divers place their extra air tanks, which <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> decompression, at points along their route so they can follow them out, not {{at the entrance to the}} cave. And when tested, the tanks were found to contain just air, not the specialized gas mix Ben would have been likely to use had he been researching cave diving as his parents said he had been.|$|E
25|$|Returning to New York in 2016 with Nardole, whom {{he removed}} from Hydroflax's body and rebuilt, the Doctor investigates Harmony Shoals, a {{multinational}} research company. They encounter a news reporter, Lucy Fletcher, who {{is conducting a}} similar investigation. The group discovers that it is being secretly run {{by a group of}} living alien brains that transplant themselves into any living creature <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> their plans. They witness the killing of the company's owner, Mr Brock, for his body. Tracked down by Dr Sim, an employee the brains already took over, the group is suddenly rescued by a masked superhero named the Ghost, who afterwards transports Lucy close to her home. Returning to her apartment before her, the Ghost transforms back into Grant, who works for Lucy as a nanny. He is shocked to find the Doctor and Nardole waiting for him, having tracked him down via the gemstone fused inside his body.|$|E
50|$|The {{principal}} {{reason for}} Germany's invasion of Norway was {{its dependence on}} Swedish iron ore, which during the winter was shipped primarily from Narvik. By securing access to Norwegian ports, the Germans could more easily obtain the supply of iron ore <b>they</b> <b>needed</b> <b>for</b> their war effort.|$|R

25|$|The People's Republic of China {{is by far}} {{the largest}} {{producer}} of coal in the world, producing over 2.8 billion tons of coal in 2007, or approximately 39.8 percent of all coal produced in the world during that year. For comparison, the second largest producer, the United States, produced more than 1.1 billion tons in 2007. An estimated 5 million people work in China's coal-mining industry. As many as 20,000 miners die in accidents each year. Most Chinese mines are deep underground and do not produce the surface disruption typical of strip mines. Although there is some evidence of reclamation of mined land for use as parks, China does not require extensive reclamation and is creating significant acreages of abandoned mined land, which is unsuitable for agriculture or other human uses, and inhospitable to indigenous wildlife. Chinese underground mines often experience severe surface subsidence (6–12 meters), negatively impacting farmland because it no longer drains well. China uses some subsidence areas for aquaculture ponds but has more than <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> that purpose. Reclamation of subsided ground is a significant problem in China. Because most Chinese coal is for domestic consumption, and is burned with little or no air pollution control equipment, it contributes greatly to visible smoke and severe air pollution in industrial areas using coal for fuel. China's total energy uses 67% from coal mines.|$|E
2500|$|In August 2013, Ros-Lehtinen, {{chair of}} the House Middle East and South Asia subcommittee, told the Miami Herald she raised the issue while leading a congressional {{delegation}} to Israel, stressing to Israeli officials the importance of them providing the Wultz family what <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> their lawsuit.

Many Mexican species lose their carnivorous leaves, and sprout succulent leaves, or die back to onion-like [...] "bulbs" [...] to survive the winter drought, at which point they can survive in bone-dry conditions. The moisture <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> growing can be supplied by either a high groundwater table, or by high humidity or high precipitation. Unlike many other carnivorous plants that require sunny locations, many butterworts thrive in part-sun or even shady conditions.|$|E

2500|$|The {{differences}} between Romans and Goths in Ostrogothic Ravenna were never as clearly defined {{as they were}} along religious lines. The Goths followed the Arian branch of Christianity, while the Romans practiced Orthodoxy. Both considered the other to be heretics. Theodoric, however, was the keystone in maintaining order amongst the peoples that he ruled, commanding respect and fear in equal measure from both Romans and Goths alike. Upon his taking of power the Orthodox bishops and leaders of Ravenna were allowed to keep their posts, but not had to enter into power sharing with Arian counterparts. In his Variae Cassiodorus has letters he penned for Theodoric that show his toleration as well as protection of the Orthodox Church. In one such letter Theodoric had Cassiodorus write, this time to Faustus, a Roman prefect, saying [...] "'The Defensores of the Holy Church of Milan want to be enabled to buy as cheap as possible the things which <b>they</b> <b>need</b> <b>for</b> the relief of the poor; {{and they say that}} we have bestowed this favor on the Church of Ravenna.
