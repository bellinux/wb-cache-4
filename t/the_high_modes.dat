40|$|The two {{dimensional}} incompressible Navier-Stokes equation on D_δ := [0, 2 πδ] × [0, 2 π] with δ≈ 1, periodic boundary conditions, and viscosity 0 < ν≪ 1 is considered. Bar and dipoles, two explicit quasi-stationary solutions of the system, evolve {{on the time}} scale O(e^-ν t) and {{have been shown to}} {{play a key role in}} its long-time evolution. Of particular interest is the role that δ plays in selecting which of these two states is observed. Recent numerical studies suggest that, after a transient period of rapid decay of <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>modes,</b> the bar state will be selected if δ≠ 1, while the dipole will be selected if δ = 1. Our results support this claim and seek to mathematically formalize it. We consider the system in Fourier space and formally project it onto an eight-dimensional center manifold consisting of the lowest eight Fourier modes. It is shown that, for all δ≈ 1, there is an initial time period in which <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>modes</b> decay at the rapid rate O(e^-t/ν), while the low modes evolve at the slower O(e^-ν t) rate. Moreover, the value of δ controls the behavior of the asymptotic ratio of the low modes, thus determining the likelihood of observing a bar state or dipole after an initial transient period. The results for the ODE are proven using energy estimates and invariant manifolds and are further supported by formal asymptotic expansions. Comment: 26 pages, 2 figure...|$|E
40|$|Using {{a central}} {{difference}} scheme, {{it is necessary}} to add an artificial viscosity in order to reach a steady state.

40|$|This article {{proposes a}} new {{approach}} based on finite-horizon parameterizing manifolds (PMs) {{for the design of}} low-dimensional suboptimal controllers to optimal control problems of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) of parabolic type. Given a finite horizon [0,T] and a low-mode truncation of the PDE, a PM provides an approximate parameterization of the uncontrolled high modes by the controlled low ones so that the unexplained high-mode energy is reduced, in an L^ 2 -sense, when this parameterization is applied. Analytic formulas of such PMs are derived by application of the method of pullback approximation of the high-modes (Chekroun, Liu, and Wang, 2013, [URL] These formulas allow for an effective derivation of reduced ODE systems, aimed to model the evolution of the low-mode truncation of the controlled state variable, where the high-mode part is approximated by the PM function applied to the low modes. A priori error estimates between the resulting PM-based low-dimensional suboptimal controller u_R^∗ and the optimal controller u^* are derived. These estimates demonstrate that the closeness of u_R^∗ to u^* is mainly conditioned on two factors: (i) the parameterization defect of a given PM, associated respectively with u_R^∗ and u^*; and (ii) the energy kept in <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>modes</b> of the PDE solution either driven by u_R^∗ or u^* itself. The practical performances of such PM-based suboptimal controllers are numerically assessed for various optimal control problems associated with a Burgers-type equation.

This article {{proposes a}} new {{approach}} {{for the design of}} low-dimensional suboptimal con-trollers to optimal control problems of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) of parabolic type. The approach fits into the long tradition of seeking for slaving relationships between the small scales and the large ones (to be controlled) but differ by the introduction of a new type of manifolds to do so, namely the finite-horizon parameterizing manifolds (PMs). Given a finite horizon [0, T] and a low-mode truncation of the PDE, a PM provides an approximate parameterization of <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>modes</b> by the controlled low ones so that the unexplained high-mode energy is reduced — in a mean-square sense over [0, T] — when this parameterization is applied.

30|$|Distinction between mode types {{is quite}} artificial, when we study thermoelastic waves in {{anisotropic}} plates, as the equation for thermal and elastic wave modes, i.e., quasi-longitudinal and quasi-transverse and shear horizontal modes, will generally be coupled with quasi-thermal modes. Also, for wave propagation {{in the direction}} of symmetry, some wave types revert to pure modes, leading to a simpler characteristic equation of lower order. A consequence of thermoelastic anisotropy in media is the loss of pure wave modes for general propagation direction. At low wave number limits, modes are found to highly influence and they vary with the thermal relaxation times. At relatively low values of the wave number, little change is seen in these values. As the wave number increases, other high modes appear; one of the modes seems to be associated with quick change in the slope of the mode. It is also observed that with changes in thermal relaxation times, lower modes have more influence whereas a small variation is noticed in <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>modes.</b> From these figures, it is observed that at low wave number limits, although wave speed modes are dispersive, but are different from the coupled case. Thus, in generalized thermoelasticity, at low values of the wave number, only the lower modes get affected and the little change is seen at relatively high values of the wave number. The low-value region of the wave number is found to be of more physical interest in generalized thermoelasticity. Further, since high wave number limits have no effect in generalized thermoelasticity, then the second sound effects are short lived.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, we {{investigate}} the feasability of using <b>higher</b> <b>modes</b> in seismic interferometry. This {{is done by}} a theoretical and computation analysis of the approximations involved, development of a method of stacking noise traces, and analysis of a small array {{in the northern part}} of <b>the</b> Netherlands. <b>Higher</b> <b>modes</b> are unambiguously present in ambient noise, and can thus be used to improve vertical resolution in the subsequent inversion procedure. The practical issue in their use, remains the problem of distinguishing them from spurious events/noise, and even distinghuising <b>higher</b> <b>modes</b> from <b>the</b> fundamental <b>mode,</b> since at <b>high</b> frequencies they can be in close proximity in a time-frequency diagram. <b>Higher</b> <b>modes</b> can furthermore be lost in the data due to: -their small amplitude compared to the fundamental mode. -intermodal cross-terms that occur with imperfect distributions, but occur even in the case of a perfectly surrounding integration surface. However, if noise is generated in a large band-like distribution (or very far away) the cross-terms should pose no problem. - source-source correlation terms. The signal to noise ratio is much smaller for <b>higher</b> <b>modes.</b> <b>The</b> exact instantaneous phase takes much longer to converge to the true solution than the envelope, implying larger uncertainty for phase velocity measurements. -incoherent noise not associated to wave propagation, or local effects. Directional noise shows much faster convergence for <b>higher</b> <b>modes,</b> again at least for station paths inline in this direction. Also in our data, the noise is strongly directional. It can be argued that <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> <b>mode</b> information would not be retrieved if this were not <b>the</b> case. <b>The</b> <b>higher</b> <b>mode</b> has a different origin from the dominant secondary microseism. The TF-phase weighted stack is a powerful tool to denoise the retrieved seismograms. It is possible to measure the group velocity from the phase stack directly. To retrieve <b>higher</b> <b>modes,</b> <b>the</b> phase stack provides an easy to use, additional tool. Most information remains in relative few TF-stacks from long displacement traces. Verification with additional information was essential for a robust estimate of the 1 D S-velocity structure beneath Annerveen, The Netherlands. As an average for <b>the</b> region, <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> <b>mode</b> information gives additional constraint on the deeper sedimentary layers. The tomographic images seem to correlate with the main geological features, but for <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> <b>modes</b> <b>the</b> amount of interstation paths that can be reliably measured is not large enough. This is due to interference with the fundamental mode in the group velocity images and the limited directionality. The choice of a substantial spread in interstation distances led to a broad frequency range of analysis, but also limited the number of measurements per frequency. A recommendation for future studies is to use a strict 1 -D configuration along the prevalent noise direction. The advantages are the large possible frequency bandwidth, and the possibility to use and invert <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> <b>modes...</b>|$|R
