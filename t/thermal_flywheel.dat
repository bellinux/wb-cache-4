40|$|A {{structure}} of calorimeter provides a calorimetric head (1) comprising a calorimetric cell (10) suitable for receiving a sample holding container (20) containing a sample (25) to examine. The cell (10) is arranged {{according to a}} first shield (3), or active shield. Outside the active shield (3) a second shield (4), or dynamical shield is present, which comprises a cylindrical hollow body arranged around the active shield (3) for all its length {{in order to provide}} a space (5) of determined size. Outside the active shield a thermal bath is present (not shown) at a temperature lower than the first and the second shield (3, 4). The dynamic shield (4) allows an effective adjustment of the heat flux through the active shield (3) during calorimetric measures by limiting the heat flux same. In fact, in operative conditions the dynamic shield acts as <b>thermal</b> <b>flywheel</b> and keeps constant the heat flux coming from the active shield (3). More in detail, the presence of the dynamic shield (4) ensures the reduction of the temperature gradient on the active shield (3) and then on the cell (10) containing the sample (20).

40|$|Poly-generation {{of various}} energy {{carriers}} from {{biomass is a}} cost effective option to initiate production of transport fuels from lignocellulosic biomass. Traditionally, the routs for this option have been trough greenfield gasification reactors. Here, on the other hand, the infrastructure of existing boilers is used for introduction of the gasification technology, which lowers cost and minimizes risks. The concept is based on adding a gasifier to existing fluidized bed boilers. An evaluation indicates the possibility of producing between 25 to 50 % of syngas, based on fuel input, without reducing the power output of the boiler. The process uses the <b>thermal</b> <b>flywheel</b> of the fluidized bed {{as a means to}} devolatilise the biomass. Only in Sweden there are around 100 fluidized bed boilers, which are potentially appropriate to be retrofitted with the proposed concept, whereof around 40 are large enough to give a low risk option for production of transport fuels within the present energy infrastructure. To demonstrate the concept, the Chalmers 12 MWth circulating fluidized bed boiler will be retrofitted according to this concept, resulting in co-generation of around 2 MWth product gas. The gas will be used temporarily for production of heat and electricity. The unit will, however, be prepared {{in such a way that}} the gas in a later stage can produce any Fischer-Tropsch fuel or synthetic natural gas. The retrofit is planed for the summer of 2007 and the plant is planned to be in operation in October 2007. This paper presents and discusses an evaluation of the concept...|$|E
40|$|Phase Change Materials (PCM’s) are characterised {{by a large}} thermal {{capacity}} and by melting temperatures close to those associated with human comfort. Thanks to the “artificial inertia” they can give a building, {{they can be used}} in components such as wallboards, floors, etc. in order to: -	store free heat gains during winter days and release energy during the night; -	reduce overheating risks in summer, especially in well-insulated Structure / Envelope constructions (Str/En) with poor {{thermal capacity}} (lightweight construction), thanks to the peak-shaving effect; -	store off-peak energy – both in winter and summer – in order to have, during the day, a warm / cool surface that contributes to irradiative comfort in winter / summer. An extensive experimental campaign was set up in Ancona (I) and Gävle (S) during the EU-FP 5 -funded research called C-TIDE (Changeable Thermal Inertia Dry Enclosures), involving Politecnico di Milano, Università Politecnica delle Marche, BMG and three SME. Different configurations were studied and tested on site, allowing to understand the potential for integration of hydrated salt PCM’s in lightweight floors and internal partitions. The experimental campaign included: -	prototyping a specific packaging system based on aluminium pouches (the “PCM blanket”); -	testing the blanket – both in wall and floors – in experimental boxes with controlled temperature conditions; -	testing the implication of sandwiching the blanket in a traditional plasterboard wall {{from the point of view}} of assembly procedures, time, everyday use, etc. The results, which were supported by mathematical modelling using the FDM method, show a good potential for integration of PCM’s in light plasterboard components.

40|$|As in air-firing, oxy-fired {{combustion}} {{using the}} Circulating Fluidized Bed (CFB) technology may offer advantages {{in that the}} CFB technology provides high fuel flexibility, in-furnace reduction of SOx emissions and a relatively smooth distribution of the extracted heat flux. Furthermore, the <b>thermal</b> <b>flywheel</b> induced by the solids flow {{and the possibility of}} heat extraction in the solids recirculation system (i. e. outside the furnace) represent a potential to achieve high oxygen concentrations while limiting the temperature level. Allowing such higher oxygen concentrations would imply significantly more compact (and thus less costly) furnaces than those used in air combustion. The present work summarizes the current status of an ongoing project which has the aim to assess the oxyfuel CFB technology by means of pilot testing and modeling. The pilot testing is carried out in a 5 MW oxyfuel CFB pilot plant (representing the largest oxy-fired CFB unit running at present date). The model is an extended version of a model for air-fired CFB combustion developed over the last six years by the authors and validated for utility-scale units. Considering that the model has previously undergone an extensive validation against data from air-fired large-scale boilers, the model is expected to represent a useful tool for the assessment, design and scale-up of oxyfuel boilers once validated with measurements from the 5 MW oxyfuel unit,. An obvious application of the model is in the dimensioning and designing heat extraction surfaces. High oxygen concentrations require more heat extraction in the solids recirculation system, which is allowed by means of increased external circulation of solids. Such increased solids circulation can be established with modifications to the furnace design and a change in operating conditions and/or solids properties...|$|E
40|$|Foster Wheeler Development Corporation {{is working}} under DOE {{contract}} No. DE-FC 26 - 00 NT 40972 {{to develop a}} partial gasification module (PGM) that represents a critical element of several potential coal-fired Vision 21 plants. When utilized for electrical power generation, these plants will operate with efficiencies greater than 60 % while producing near zero emissions of traditional stack gas pollutants. The new process partially gasifies coal at elevated pressure producing a coal-derived syngas and a char residue. The syngas {{can be used to}} fuel the most advanced power producing equipment such as solid oxide fuel cells or gas turbines or processed to produce clean liquid fuels or chemicals for industrial users. The char residue is not wasted; it {{can also be used to}} generate electricity by fueling boilers that drive the most advanced ultra-supercritical pressure steam turbines. The unique aspect of the process is that it utilizes a pressurized circulating fluidized bed partial gasifier and does not attempt to consume the coal in a single step. To convert all the coal to syngas in a single step requires extremely high temperatures ({approx} 2500 to 2800 F) that melt and vaporize the coal and essentially drive all coal ash contaminants into the syngas. Since these contaminants can be corrosive to power generating equipment, the syngas must be cooled to near room temperature to enable a series of chemical processes to clean the syngas. Foster Wheeler's process operates at much lower temperatures that control/minimize the release of contaminants; this eliminates/minimizes the need for the expensive, complicated syngas heat exchangers and chemical cleanup systems typical of high temperature gasification. By performing the gasification in a circulating bed, a significant amount of syngas can still be produced despite the reduced temperature and the circulating bed allows easy scale up to large size plants. Rather than air, it can also operate with oxygen to facilitate sequestration of stack gas carbon dioxide gases for a 100 % reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The amount of syngas and char produced by the PGM can be tailored to fit the production objectives of the overall plant, i. e., power generation, clean liquid fuel production, chemicals production, etc. Hence, PGM is a robust building block that offers all the advantages of coal gasification but in a more user friendly form; it is also fuel flexible in that it can use alternative fuels such as biomass, sewerage sludge, etc. The PGM consists of a pressurized circulating fluidized bed (PCFB) reactor together with a recycle cyclone and a particulate removing barrier filter. Coal, air, steam, and possibly sand are fed to the bottom of the PCFB reactor and establish a relatively dense bed of coal/char in the bottom section. As these constituents react, a hot syngas is produced which conveys the solids residue vertically up through the reactor and into the recycle cyclone. Solids elutriated from the dense bed and contained in the syngas are collected in the cyclone and drain via a dipleg back to the dense bed at the bottom of the PCFB reactor. This recycle loop of hot solids acts as a <b>thermal</b> <b>flywheel</b> and promotes efficient solid-gas chemical reaction...|$|E
