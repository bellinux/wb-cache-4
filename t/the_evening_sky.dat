However, since both the date and the azimuth of this event change continuously, a solar interpretation of this orientation is much more likely.|$|E
25|$|Diwali {{is one of}} {{the seven}} most {{important}} festivals of Telangana and Andhra Pradesh and mainly it is celebrated with name Deepavali. It is very popular with children who celebrate Diwali because of the excitement of bursting firecrackers. Special shops to sell firecrackers are set up in all towns, cities and bigger villages. Some areas host local stage story telling called Hari Katha. Some areas may put a huge Narakasura dummy made with fireworks. This will be burst by a person dressed as Lord Krishna or, more accurately, a costume of Satyabhama, the consort of Lord Krishna, who actually killed the demon Narakasura; an event that is celebrated as Diwali for generations. <b>The</b> <b>evening</b> <b>sky</b> of Diwali is a colourful sight to watch.|$|E

500|$|Covering 220.8 square {{degrees and}} hence 0.535% of the sky, Pyxis ranks 65th of the 88 modern constellations by area. Its {{position}} in the Southern Celestial Hemisphere means that the whole constellation is visible to observers south of 52°N. It is most visible in <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> <b>sky</b> in February and March. A small constellation, it is bordered by Hydra to the north, Puppis to the west, Vela to the south, and Antlia to the east. The three-letter abbreviation for the constellation, as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922, is 'Pyx'. The official constellation boundaries, as set by Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of eight sides (illustrated in infobox). In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between [...] and , while the declination coordinates are between −17.41° and −37.29°.|$|E
500|$|Lying {{directly}} {{south of}} Gemini's bright stars Castor and Pollux, Canis Minor {{is a small}} constellation bordered by Monoceros to the south, Gemini to the north, Cancer to the northeast, and Hydra to the east.

It appears prominently in the southern sky during the Northern Hemisphere's winter. The constellation boundaries, as set by Eugène Delporte in 1930, are defined by a polygon of 14 sides. In the equatorial coordinate system, the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between [...] and , while the declination coordinates are between [...] and [...] Most visible in <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> <b>sky</b> from January to March, Canis Minor is most prominent at 10 PM during mid-February.

500|$|The {{scenario}} {{was written}} by Takashi Hasegawa, who had written for multiple series entries since Tales of Eternia; Koki Matsumoto, who had written the scenario of Tales of Legendia; Hideo Baba, who had previously done work on Tales of Rebirth; and Takaaki Okuda, a newcomer to the series. The game's title, meant to be indicative of the games' theme of justice, was derived from [...] "Vesper", a name referring to the planet Venus. Its general meaning was to depict the protagonists and their ship as a newly-born star shining on the land, similar to Venus in <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> <b>sky.</b> The logo was also design to convey this, and the term [...] "Vesperia" [...] was used in-game for the party's airship. The game's main protagonist, Yuri Lowell, was created {{to be a more}} mature, evolved protagonist than Kyle Dunamis in Tales of Destiny 2 or Luke fon Fabre in Abyss. His role was to facilitate the growth of the other characters, and {{to have a sense of}} justice that did not take account of the law. Veteran Tales character designer, Kōsuke Fujishima, was brought in to design the main characters. Fujishima found designing Yuri difficult, while Flynn proved one of the easiest designs. One of the intentions for Flynn and Yuri was for their designs to contrast with each other. A main character not designed by Fujishima was Repede, who was designed by the art director Daigo Okumura.|$|E

Its now-famous opening lines, comparing <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> <b>sky</b> to [...] "a patient etherised upon a table", were considered shocking and offensive, especially at a time when Georgian Poetry was hailed for its derivations of the nineteenth century Romantic Poets.|$|E
2500|$|... "Here Comes the Moon" [...] {{is a song}} by English {{musician}} George Harrison {{from his}} 1979 album George Harrison. Harrison wrote the song while on holiday on the Hawaiian island of Maui in February 1978. His inspiration for the composition was {{the appearance of the}} moon in <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> <b>sky,</b> just as the sun was setting. Although the lyrics focus on this natural occurrence rather than on the symbolism it suggests, in the manner of Harrison's Beatles track [...] "Here Comes the Sun", the song is seen as a sequel to that similarly titled piece.|$|E

When Galileo, having seized what the moon and stars could quickly offer, had turned his telescope on the next brightest object in <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> <b>sky,</b> Jupiter, early in January, Venus was visible in the predawn sky. For a Copernican, Venus was in a critical part of its orbit, past maximum elongation, approaching superior conjunction, and thus exhibiting a shape incompatible with the Ptolemaic system. As we have seen, however, Jupiter had offered something quite different, an incomparable present to the grand duke, and Galileo had not paused to look further.|$|E

Reports described the object lighting up <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> <b>sky</b> with a blazing trail and hitting {{the ground with a}} loud crash, leaving a burning crater claimed to be around [...] wide and from [...] up to [...] deep.

Maimonides claimed that this blue was the colour of [...] "the clear noonday sky"; Rashi, the colour of <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> <b>sky.</b> According to several rabbinic sages, blue is the colour of God's Glory.

2500|$|The monsoon {{can begin}} any time from mid-June to late July, {{with an average}} start date around July 3. It {{typically}} continues through August and sometimes into September.

Large areas of the city do not have storm sewers, so monsoon rains flood the main thoroughfares, usually for no longer than a few hours. A few underpasses in Tucson have [...] "feet of water" [...] scales painted on their supports to discourage fording by automobiles during a rainstorm. Arizona traffic code Title 28-910, the so-called [...] "Stupid Motorist Law", was instituted in 1995 to discourage people from entering flooded roadways.

2500|$|In lines 9-12, {{the poet}} {{attempts}} {{to quell the}} torment of day and night by using flattery. In line 9, when the poet writes [...] "when I tell the day, to please him thou art bright", 'him' {{is indicative of the}} day while 'thou' is the beloved. Another example of flattery can be observed in line 10, when the poet assures day that he is not dull [...] "because the beloved’s brightness makes him beautiful, gracing him." [...] Furthermore, when <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> <b>sky</b> appears grim and starless, the poet uses flattery by telling him that evening is [...] "gilded by the beloved." [...] In lines 11 and 12, the word [...] "'night', not 'evening', is required by logic, but 'even' is imposed by rhyme" [...] – a proclamation that [...] "the evening star is the brightest star in the sky." [...] Furthermore, the poet again attempts to appease his torturers in line 11 by referring to night as 'swart-complexioned'. The poet's adulation is counterfeit, as he knows that a starless night is unattractive, but this admission enables Shakespeare to [...] "insert into the poem a flash of praise of the beloved, whose brightness graces a dull day and gilds a dull evening." ...|$|E
