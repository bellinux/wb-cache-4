50|$|One {{of the key}} {{concerns}} of older adults is the experience of memory loss, especially as {{it is one of}} the hallmark symptoms of Alzheimer's disease.

Research has revealed that individuals' performance on memory <b>tasks</b> <b>that</b> rely on frontal regions declines with age. Older adults tend to exhibit deficits on <b>tasks</b> <b>that</b> involve knowing the temporal order in which they learned information; source memory <b>tasks</b> <b>that</b> require them to remember the specific circumstances or context in which they learned information; and prospective memory <b>tasks</b> <b>that</b> involve remembering to perform an act at a future time.

Typically, children younger than one year old search for the object under Location A, where the object was previously hidden. However, after their first birthday, {{children are}} capable of mentally switching to locate the object in Location B, demonstrating flexibility. Researchers have agreed that the A-not-B task is a simple <b>task</b> <b>that</b> effectively measures cognitive flexibility during infancy.|$|E
5|$|The Peace of Philocrates {{eventually}} {{broke down}} as hostilities reignited between Athens and Macedonia. Demosthenes, an Athenian statesman who was partially responsible for engineering the peace treaty, delivered {{a series of}} speeches encouraging his fellow Athenians to oppose Philip II. The Macedonian hegemony over Greece was secured by their victory over a Greek coalition army led by Athens and Thebes, at the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC. In the aftermath the federation of Greek states known as the League of Corinth was established, which brought these former Greek adversaries and others into a formal alliance with Macedonia. The League of Corinth elected Philip as strategos (i.e. commander-in-chief) for a planned invasion of the Achaemenid Empire of Persia. However, Philip was assassinated before he could begin the campaign, a <b>task</b> <b>that</b> instead fell to his son and successor, Alexander the Great.|$|E

5|$|The {{effects of}} the fire that {{destroyed}} the priory in 1289 {{can be seen in}} scorched paving between the surviving pillars. It was thought the church had been completely rebuilt, but excavations in the 1980s show that a substantial amount of the less damaged west end was reused which resulted in a distinct inconsistency between the two ends, which were constructed in different architectural styles. Rebuilding was a major <b>task</b> <b>that</b> took several generations and was probably not completed {{until the end of the}} 14th century. It is unclear how much of the second priory survived the fire. Where the priory was rebuilt, its builders reused as much as possible; the core of the surviving eastern gable wall is full of fragments from the destroyed second priory.|$|E
5|$|Work {{immediately}} began on constructing the abbey church, a <b>task</b> <b>that</b> took many decades. It was a conservative design, {{heavily influenced by}} the thoughts of St. Bernard and the order's early churches in its homeland of Burgundy. It was cruciform in shape with an aisled nave of seven bays, a short, square east end, and transepts each with two side chapels. The eastern parts of the church were built first, and were likely finished in 1232, {{at which point the}} abbey received a royal donation of oak to build choir stalls. The remainder was probably completed by mid-century.|$|E
5|$|Although musically precocious, Tchaikovsky {{was educated}} {{for a career}} as a civil servant. There was scant {{opportunity}} for a musical career in Russia at that time and no system of public music education. When an opportunity for such an education arose, he entered the nascent Saint Petersburg Conservatory, from which he graduated in 1865. The formal Western-oriented teaching he received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary nationalist movement embodied by the Russian composers of The Five, with whom his professional relationship was mixed. Tchaikovsky's training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood. From this reconciliation he forged a personal but unmistakably Russian style—a <b>task</b> <b>that</b> did not prove easy. The principles that governed melody, harmony and other fundamentals of Russian music ran completely counter to those that governed Western European music; this seemed to defeat the potential for using Russian music in large-scale Western composition or for forming a composite style, and it caused personal antipathies that dented Tchaikovsky's self-confidence. Russian culture exhibited a split personality, with its native and adopted elements having drifted apart increasingly since the time of Peter the Great. This resulted in uncertainty among the intelligentsia about the country's national identity—an ambiguity mirrored in Tchaikovsky's career.|$|E

5|$|In 1978, the Australian {{government}} decided to purchase two passenger jets for strategic transport, primarily to mitigate what it {{saw as the}} risk of terrorist attack inherent in carrying VIPs on commercial flights. Its attempts to procure one Boeing 727 each from domestic carriers Ansett and TAA were unsuccessful but, in December, Qantas agreed to sell the government two Boeing 707s for $14.5 million. Purchasing big jets for VIPs was controversial, but the 707s were also intended for general long-range transport, being capable of carrying cargo or up to 160 passengers. The first {{was transferred to the}} RAAF in March 1979, and its inaugural Air Force flight took place on 22April. Located at RAAF Base Richmond, New South Wales, the 707s were initially operated by No.37 Squadron. They were formed into No.33 Flight under the command of Wing Commander J.D.

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of this failure, the Belgians were asked to fall back to the Yser river and protect the Allied left flank and rear areas. The King's aide, General Overstraten said that such a move could not be made and {{would lead to the}} Belgian Army disintegrating. Another plan for further offensives was suggested. The French requested the Belgians withdraw to the Leie and the British to the French frontier between Maulde and Halluin, the Belgians were then to extend their front to free further parts of the BEF for the attack. The French 1st Army would relieve two more divisions on the right flank. Leopold was reluctant to undertake such a move because it would abandon all but a small portion of Belgium. The Belgian Army was exhausted and it was an enormous technical <b>task</b> <b>that</b> would take too long to complete.|$|E

Housemates were instructed to nominate two fellow housemates for eviction each week. This compulsory vote was conducted in the privacy of the Diary Room and housemates were not allowed to discuss the nomination process or influence the nominations of others. On Day 68, Big Brother changed the rules to allow housemates to discuss nominations until further notice. The two or more housemates who gathered the most nominations per week faced a public vote and the housemate receiving the most votes was evicted from the House on the Friday and interviewed by Davina McCall. Housemates could voluntarily leave the House at any time and those who broke the rules could have been ejected by Big Brother.|$|E

If more challenging tasks provide more accurate information about ability, people who care about and who are risk averse over their perception of their ability will choose <b>tasks</b> <b>that</b> are not sufficiently challenging. Moderate overestimation of ability and overestimation of the precision of initial information leads people to choose <b>tasks</b> <b>that</b> raise expected output (and utility); however, extreme overconfidence leads people to undertake <b>tasks</b> <b>that</b> are excessively challenging.
