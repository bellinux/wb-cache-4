25|$|In solid timber work it {{is common}} <b>to</b> <b>counterbore</b> {{a hole in the}} frame or carcase member to conceal the head of the screw. This also allows more of the body of the screw to {{penetrate}} the adjacent member for greater traction. After the screw has been driven into the joint, the counterbore can be filled with an appropriately sized piece of dowel or a wooden plug cut from an offcut of the same timber using a plug cutter.|$|E
2500|$|The {{pocket holes}} require two {{drilling}} operations to be completed. The first is <b>to</b> <b>counterbore</b> the pocket hole itself, which houses the screw head within the member. This hole is stopped 1/4" [...] (5mm) {{or so from}} the edge of the frame member. The second step is to drill a pilot hole concentric with the pocket hole which extends through the edge of the member. The pilot hole allows the screw to pass through the member and into the adjoining member. This two stage drilling operation may be performed with two different sized drill bits, however there are special stepped bits available to perform the operation in a single pass. The drilling operation is often facilitated by a pocket hole jig which allows the user to drill the pocket hole at the correct angle and to the correct depth.|$|E

50|$|For a spotface, {{material}} {{is removed from}} a surface to make it flat and smooth, usually for a fastener or a bearing. Spotfacing is usually required on workpieces that are forged or cast. A tool referred <b>to</b> as a <b>counterbore</b> is typically used to cut the spotface, although an endmill may also be used. Only enough {{material is}} removed to make the surface flat.|$|R
25|$|A {{step drill}} bit is a drill bit {{that has the}} tip ground down to a {{different}} diameter. The transition between this ground diameter and the original diameter is either straight, <b>to</b> form a <b>counterbore,</b> or angled, <b>to</b> form a countersink. The advantage to this style is that both diameters have the same flute characteristics, which keeps the bit from clogging when drilling in softer materials, such as aluminum; in contrast, a drill bit with a slip-on collar {{does not have the}} same benefit. Most of these bits are custom-made for each application, which makes them more expensive.|$|R
40|$|Lean {{combustion}} limits {{were determined}} for a premixed prevaporized propane air mixture with flat plate flame stabilizers. Experiments {{were conducted in}} a constant area flame tube combustor utilizing flameholders of varying percentages of blockage and downstream counterbores. Combustor inlet air velocity at ambient conditions was varied from 4 to 9 meters per second. Flameholders with a center hole and four half holes surrounding it were tested with 63, 73, and 85 percent blockage and counterbore diameters of 112 and 125 percent of the thru hole diameter, in addition <b>to</b> the no <b>counterbore</b> configuration. Improved stability was obtained by using counterbore flameholders and higher percentages of blockage. Increases in mixture velocity caused the equivalence ratio at blowout to increase in all cases...|$|R

5000|$|The cutters {{most often}} used to cut spotfaces are {{counterbore}} cutters and endmills. In manual machining especially, the former is useful because its pilot guides the cutter into the correct location (established by the bolt hole), and its cutting lips are perpendicular to the hole axis with no relief angle, meaning that a plunging cut, moving in only the Z-axis, will leave a flat surface. In contrast, most general-purpose endmills have a relief angle such that a plunging cut (Z-axis-only toolpath) will leave a very slightly convex surface. But in CNC machining this is irrelevant, because the flat spotface is left by circular interpolation of the endmill as it traces a circular toolpath in the XY plane. Zero-angle cutters obviate this, functioning similarly <b>to</b> the traditional <b>counterbore</b> cutters of manual machining but needing no pilot. Spot facing of larger planar surfaces sometimes employs face mills.|$|R
