25|$|The FLDS traces {{its claim}} to spiritual {{authority}} to accounts, starting with a statement published in 1912 by Lorin C. Woolley, of a purported 1886 divine revelation to then-LDS Church President John Taylor. <b>They</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> 1886 revelation as precluding validity of the 1890 Manifesto against new plural marriages by church members, issued by Wilford Woodruff, whom the LDS Church recognizes as Taylor's successor. After the formal abandonment of plural marriage by the LDS Church, many members around Short Creek and elsewhere continued, and even solemnized, plural marriages. In 1904, the LDS Church issued the Second Manifesto and eventually excommunicated those who continued to solemnize or enter into new plural marriages.|$|E
25|$|Extensive {{destruction}} {{was caused}} to commercial enterprises and to public infrastructure. According to Palestinian industrialists, 219 factories were destroyed or severely damaged during the Israeli military operation. Of the three per cent of industrial capacity {{that was still}} operating after the 18-month Israeli blockade, much has now been destroyed. The biggest Palestinian food-processing plant, Alweyda was devastated, as were both Abu Eida, the largest ready-mixed concrete producer, with four factories demolished, and the Al Badr flour mills, with the biggest storage facilities in the Strip. All three had close and long-standing contact with Israeli partner firms and suppliers. The owners stated that <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> {{as part of an}} economic war to make Gaza dependent on Israel.|$|E
25|$|Public {{institutions}} in the U.S. have also drawn fire for accommodating Islam {{at the expense of}} taxpayers. The University of Michigan–Dearborn and a public college in Minnesota have been criticized for accommodating Islamic prayer rituals by constructing footbaths for Muslim students using tax-payers' money. Critics said this special accommodation, which is made to satisfy the needs of Muslims alone, is a violation of Constitutional provisions separating church and state. Along the same constitutional lines, a San Diego public elementary school is being criticized for making special accommodations, specifically for American Muslims, by adding Arabic to its curriculum and giving breaks for Muslim prayers. Some critics said exceptions have not been made for any religious group in the past, and <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> as an endorsement of Islam.|$|E

2500|$|Few mathematicians are {{typically}} concerned on a daily, working basis over logicism, formalism {{or any other}} philosophical position. Instead, their primary {{concern is that the}} mathematical enterprise as a whole always remains productive. Typically, <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> as insured by remaining open-minded, practical and busy; as potentially threatened by becoming overly-ideological, fanatically reductionistic or lazy. Such a view was expressed by the Physics Nobel Prize laureate Richard Feynman: ...|$|E
2500|$|Parents {{with the}} {{perspective}} of autism as a disorder (which is called the [...] "pro-cure perspective" [...] in the autism rights movement) believe that therapy {{with the intent of}} extinguishing stereotypically autistic behavior is in their children's best interests; <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> as a treatment that will reduce their children's suffering. These critics say ABA gives autistic children the best chance of success in adulthood, as they either do not believe it is possible that adult society could accommodate autistic people (who have not been trained by ABA to exhibit neurotypical behavior at all times) or they do not believe it is desirable to do so.|$|E

[...] It is largely on this basis that they justified their continued operation as the Socialist Party of Great Britain: they claim that they were expelled from [...] "The Socialist Party", not [...] "The Socialist Party of Great Britain".

2500|$|Its {{supporters}} often {{refer to}} their beliefs as 'socialism from below', a term {{which has been}} attributed to Hal Draper. This concept can also {{be traced back to the}} rules of the First International which stated: [...] "the emancipation of the working classes must be conquered by the working classes themselves." [...] <b>They</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> as distinguishing themselves from other socialist groups, particularly both from reformist parties such as the Labour Party (described as a 'capitalist workers' party') and from various forms of what they disparagingly term 'Stalinism'—forms of socialism usually associated with the former Soviet Bloc and the old Communist Parties. These are seen as advocating socialism from above. In contrast Cliff argued: [...] "The heart of Marxism is that the emancipation of the working class is the act of the working class. The Communist Manifesto states: 'All previous historical movements were movements of minorities, or in the interest of minorities. The proletarian movement is the self-conscious, independent movement of the immense majority, in the interest of the immense majority.'"

2500|$|FACTNet has {{maintained}} a relatively low news profile since 1999, occasionally cited for speaking out against topics they consider important. [...] The 2000 film Battlefield Earth starring John Travolta stirred up controversy because {{it was based on}} a book by L. R. Hubbard, the founder of the Church of Scientology, and Travolta was a well-known Scientologist. [...] The Guardian reported on FACTnet's claims that the film was a proselytism piece for Scientology, noting: [...] "FACTnet suggested that subliminal messages had been cunningly inserted by Scientologists to win over new converts to join the church." [...] The makers of the film asserted that {{it had nothing to do}} with the Church of Scientology, but The New York Times reported on FACTnet's assertions that: [...] "..the film was secretly financed by Scientology, and that Scientology plans recruiting efforts to coincide with the movie's release." [...] Sociology professor James Richardson did not agree with FACTnet's claims, stating: [...] "I seriously doubt that someone is going to go out and join Scientology just because <b>they</b> <b>see</b> <b>this</b> movie." [...] In 2002, after Lawrence Wollersheim won an US$8.7 million judgement against the Church of Scientology, FACTnet posted a statement from him on the site, quoting: [...] "The cult that vowed it would never pay me one thin dime has now paid over 86 million thin dimes." [...] FACTNet spoke out in support of an episode of the TV show South Park, awarding their staff the [...] "FACTNet Person(s) of the Year for 2005" [...] for the satirical episode on Scientology, [...] "Trapped in the Closet". [...] In 2006, FACTnet director Wollersheim was consulted for the 48 Hours story on the death of Scientologist Elli Perkins, [...] "Scientology - A Question of Faith." [...] Wollersheim was quoted in the piece, stating: [...] "Scientology. They are the worst example of mind control in a religious setting that has ever existed". The program also noted that the Church of Scientology characterizes him as a [...] "liar and a fraud," [...] and asserts that most of its members live happy and fulfilled lives.|$|E
