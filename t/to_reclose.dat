Drawing on longitudinal administrative records spanning four decades, we first present discouraging historical evidence showing that labor migrants from low-income source countries tend to have unstable employment careers with marked overrepresentation in welfare programs. This pattern extends to post-accession labor migrants from Eastern Europe, who quickly experience high rates of unemployment. The article discusses possible avenues for making the welfare state "migration robust.

He had, like Maxwell, forgotten <b>to</b> <b>reclose</b> the breast-valve, but, unlike the more experienced diver, he had failed to discover his omission. He became flurried and anxious, and getting, more and more confused, fumbled nervously at his helmet to ascertain that all was right there.

In additiony, the cooling between each short circuit is taken into account. The results of the proposed method are compared to the results given by the method of the IEC 60865 - 1 standard.

30|$|In the post-event {{analysis}} of the September 8 th blackout, phase measurement unit (PMU) data proved extremely valuable in constructing {{the sequence of events}} and validating simulation results. However, PMUs did not play a part in observing system behaviors in real time. For instance, tripping of the H–NG line led to the increase of phase angle difference between voltages of the two terminals. Post-event simulation showed that this angle difference exceeded APS’s synchro-check relay setting of 60 degrees and re-dispatch of a significant amount of generation was required to reduce this difference to the acceptable value. Without situational awareness of the real-time value of this phase angle difference, WECC and California Independent System Operator(CAISO)were informed by APS that the line could be quickly reconnected. If PMUs were used to monitor the voltage angle difference between two ends of the tripped line, the time required <b>to</b> <b>reclose</b> the H–NG line would not have been wrongly estimated and WECC probably would have taken action to reduce loading on Path 44 to prevent its automatic tripping.|$|E

The performance of the ELCBA is investigated by detecting the earth leakage current to the grounding system (TN).  The prototype is designed and simulated by using Proteus software.

A third study investigates the effect of package resealability across multiple consumption occasions and reveals that the resealability feature limits the volume consumed on each occasion (conditional on consumption incidence) while it does not accelerate consumption frequency, resulting in a lower total consumed volume of palatable, energy-dense snacks over a six-day period.

40|$|Accumulating {{evidence}} suggests that the kinetics of release from single secretory vesicles can be regulated and that quantal size can be modified during fast kiss-and-run fusion. Multiple pathways for vesicle retrieval have been identified involving clathrin and dynamin. It has been unclear whether dynamin could participate in a fast kiss-and-run process <b>to</b> <b>reclose</b> a transient fusion pore and thereby limit vesicle release. We have disrupted dynamin function in adrenal chromaffin cells by expression of the amphiphysin Src-homology domain 3 (SH 3) or by application of guanosine 5 ′-[γ-thio]triphosphate (GTPγS), and have monitored single vesicle release events, evoked by digitonin and Ca 2 +, by using carbon-fiber amperometry. Under both conditions, there was an increase in mean quantal size accompanying an increase in the half-width of amperometric spikes and a slowing of the fall time. These data suggest the existence of a dynamin-dependent process that can terminate vesicle release under basal conditions. Protein kinase C activation changed release kinetics and decreased quantal size by shortening the release period. The effects of phorbol ester treatment were not prevented by expression of the amphiphysin SH 3 domain or by GTPγS suggesting the existence of alternative dynamin-independent process underlying fast kiss-and-run exocytosis...|$|E

40|$|The {{inadvertent}} {{opening of}} a pressure relief valve results in a reactor coolant inventory decrease {{and a decrease in}} reactor coolant system pressure. A pressure relief valve, as defined in ANSI B 95. 1 - 1972 (Ref. 1), is a pressure relief device which is designed <b>to</b> <b>reclose</b> and prevent further fluid flow after normal condi-tions have been restored. The effect of the pressure decrease is to decrease the neutron flux (via moderator density feedback). In a pressurized water reactor (PWR), a reactor trip occurs due to low reactor coolant system (RCS) pressure. In a boiling water reactor (BWR), the pressure relief valve discharges into the suppression pool. Normally there is no reactor trip in a BWR. The pressure regulator senses the RCS pressure decrease and partially closes the turbine control valves (TCV) to stabilize the reactor at a lower pressure. The reactor power settles out at nearly the initial power level. The coolant inventory is maintained by the feedwater control system using water from the condensate storage tank via the condenser hotwell.

40|$|Conventional {{recloser}} {{stresses the}} circuit with current fault {{every time they}} reclose into a fault. After clearing a fault, a conventional recloser simply <b>recloses</b> the interrupters <b>to</b> continuously test {{the presence of the}} fault. If the fault is still there, the interrupters are tripped again. Then, after a time delay, the interrupters are reclosed. During reclosing operation of Automatic Recloser, including the faster recloser one, powerful transient processes occurs and significant amount of energy is feeding the fault, resulting in system-damaging and voltage sags. Replacing conventional recloser with PulseCloser one minimizes these effects and creates the possibility <b>to</b> use multiple <b>reclosing</b> even when traditional autoreclosing can not be allowed. PulseCloser Technology drastically reduces overcurrent stress on the system. Once the PulseCloser interrupts a fault, it sends the impulses to intelligently tests for current fault before reclosing. The relative let-through energy of a pulseclosing operation is typically less than 2 % of a conventional reclosing operation. Pulseclosing is superior <b>to</b> conventional <b>reclosing.</b> It greatly reduces stress on system components as well as voltage sags experienced by customers’ upstream fault. This paper analyzes transient processes during simulation of operation of traditional recloser and PulseCloser type. Simulations are performed using ATP software.

DESIGN: Retrospective interventional case series. METHODS: SETTING: Institutional. PATIENTS: Thirty-six patients with primary failed closure or reopened holes after primary vitrectomy. INTERVENTION: Fluid-gas excahnge with 15 % perfluoropropane (C 3 F 8) or 20 % sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6) was performed <b>to</b> <b>reclose</b> the hole under topical anesthesia. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The hole closure rate and type, pre- and postexchange best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and complication rates were assessed. RESULTS: Thirty-two eyes (89 %) achieved anatomic success from 1 - 3 weeks after the fluid-gas exchange. Twenty-two eyes (61 %) achieved type 1 closure, 10 eyes (28 %) achieved type 2 closure, and 4 eyes (11 %) did not achieve closure. The BCVA for type 1 closure improved significantly from logarithm of the minimal angle of resolution (logMAR) 1. 66 ± 0. 41 to 0. 84 ± 0. 41, with a P value <. 001. The BCVA for type 2 closure improved from logMAR 1. 77 ± 0. 41 to 1. 52 ± 0. 41, with a P value of. 05. All patients with an unclosed hole after fluid-gas exchange had a stage IV macular hole before the primary vitrectomy and a hole size larger than 1000 mm. The complication related to fluid-gas exchange procedure was transient high intraocular pressure, which responded well to topical antiglaucoma medications. There were 2 retinal detachment cases following the exchange; surgery to reattach the retina was performed, with visual acuity recovery. CONCLUSION: Outpatient fluid-gas exchange is an effective treatment option for eyes with open holes following vitrectomy...|$|E
40|$|Evaporation is the {{consequence}} of slow plasma heating near the tops of streamers where the plasma is only weakly contained by the magnetic field. The form it takes is the slow opening of field lines {{at the top of}} the streamer and transient formation of new solar wind. It was discovered in polytropic model calculations, where due to the absence of other energy loss mechanisms in magnetostatic streamers, its ultimate endpoint is the complete evaporation of the streamer. This takes, for plausible heating rates, weeks to months in these models. Of course streamers do not behave this way, for more than one reason. One is that there are losses due to thermal conduction to the base of the streamer and radiation from the transition region. Another is that streamer heating must have a characteristic time constant and depend on the ambient physical conditions. We use our global Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model with thermal conduction to examine a few examples of the effect of changing the heating scale height and of making ad hoc choices for how the heating depends on ambient conditions. At the same time, we apply and extend the analytic model of streamers, which showed that streamers will be unable to contain plasma for temperatures near the cusp greater than about 2 xl 0 (exp 6) K. Slow solar wind is observed to come from streamers through transient releases. A scenario for this that is consistent with the above physical process is that heating increases the near-cusp temperature until field lines there are forced open. The subsequent evacuation of the flux tubes by the newly forming slow wind decreases the temperature and heating until the flux tubes are able <b>to</b> <b>reclose.</b> Then, over a longer time scale, heating begins to again refill the flux tubes with plasma and increase the temperature until the cycle repeats itself. The calculations we report here are first steps towards quantitative evaluation of this scenario...|$|E
