On National Road 555 between Straume, the municipal center of Fjell, and Storavatnet, where National Road 555 becomes a motorway, there are long queues during rush hour. The Norwegian Public Roads Administration has proposed a four-lane motorway along National Road 555 from Stoavatnet to Straume. <b>This</b> <b>will</b> <b>require</b> a new crossing across Knarreviksundet. Such a motorway extension is estimated to cost between NOK3 and 4 billion, {{and the government has}} allocated NOK400 million in National Transport Plan 2010–2019 for the project. It is presumed that most of the project will be financed as a toll road.|$|E
25|$|In September 2011, the Israeli {{government}} {{approved a}} five-year economic development plan called the Prawer Plan. One of its implications is a relocation of some 30.000-40.000 Negev Bedouin from areas not {{recognized by the}} government to government-approved townships. <b>This</b> <b>will</b> <b>require</b> Bedouins to leave ancestral villages, cemeteries and communal life as they know it.|$|E

Currently, only 68 R160As (8313-8380) have been retrofitted with CBTC equipment for operation on the L service alongside trains of CBTC-equipped R143 cars. However, 1486 R160s, 309 sets (250 five-car units, and 59 four-car units) are {{planned to be}} retrofitted with CBTC for Queens Boulevard service by June 2020. <b>This</b> <b>will</b> <b>require</b> many cars currently maintained at Coney Island Yard to be retrofitted as well.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} {{modernization}} of the New York City Subway, the MTA has plans to upgrade much of the system with communications-based train control (CBTC) technology, which will control the speed and starting and stopping of subway trains. The CBTC system is mostly automated and uses a moving block system – which reduces headways between trains, increases train frequencies and capacities, and relays the trains' positions to a control room – rather than a fixed block system. <b>This</b> <b>will</b> <b>require</b> new rolling stock to be built for the subway system, as only newer trains can use CBTC systems.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, the United Kingdom Government {{agreed to}} an overall European Union target of {{generating}} 20% of the European Union's energy supply from renewable sources by 2020. Each European Union member state was given its own allocated target; for the United Kingdom it is 15%. This was formalised in January 2009 {{with the passage of}} the EU Renewables Directive. As renewable heat and fuel production in the United Kingdom are at extremely low bases, RenewableUK estimates that <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>require</b> 35–40% of the United Kingdom's electricity to be generated from renewable sources by that date, to be met largely by 33–35 GW of installed wind capacity.|$|E

25|$|Facilitation is a {{significant}} ecological process that produces community-level effects through individual interactions. By improving dispersal, increasing access to resources, and providing protection from stress, predation, and competition, facilitation can impact community structure, diversity, and invasibility. Incorporation of facilitation into such classic theories as natural selection and niche separation should be a goal of current and future ecologists. <b>This</b> <b>will</b> <b>require</b> further research into the mechanisms of facilitation {{at the level of}} individuals, and the impacts of facilitation at the level of population, community, and ecosystem. Continued study of positive species interactions will serve to improve our understanding of processes and application of theories.|$|E
25|$|If the {{blocking}} or nailing is inadequate, each beam can be laid flat by the {{shear forces}} {{applied to the}} building. In this position they lack most of their original strength and the structure may further collapse. As part of a retrofit the blocking may be doubled, especially at the outer edges of the building. It may be appropriate to add additional nails between the sill plate of the perimeter wall erected upon the floor diaphragm, although <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>require</b> exposing the sill plate by removing interior plaster or exterior siding. As the sill plate may be quite old and dry and substantial nails must be used, {{it may be necessary}} to pre-drill a hole for the nail in the old wood to avoid splitting. When the wall is opened for this purpose it may also be appropriate to tie vertical wall elements into the foundation using specialty connectors and bolts glued with epoxy cement into holes drilled in the foundation.|$|E

[...] The stadium issue generated significant press and raised concerns over the team's long-term viability given that the Argonauts losses have been estimated anywhere from $2 to $6 million annually. While various stadium rumours swirled over the course of David Braley's tenure (including building a new facility) it became increasingly clear that a move to a renovated BMO Field was the only viable option.|$|E
