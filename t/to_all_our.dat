500|$|Producing {{the first}} video {{proved to be}} a {{difficult}} task for Jackson. State authorities unsuccessfully tried to ban the singer filming in Salvador (Pelourinho) and in Rio de Janeiro. Officials in the state of Rio feared images of poverty might affect tourism and accused Jackson of exploiting the poor. Ronaldo Cezar Coelho, the state secretary for Industry, Commerce and Tourism demanded editing rights over the finished product, stating, [...] "I don't see why we should have to facilitate films that will contribute nothing <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>our</b> efforts to rehabilitate Rio's image". Some were concerned that scenes of poverty and human rights abuses would affect their chances of hosting the Olympics in 2004. Others supported Jackson's wish to highlight the problems of the region, arguing that the government were embarrassed by their own failings.|$|E

500|$|Morris {{first came}} across {{the story of the}} Volsungs, [...] "the grandest tale that ever was told" [...] as he later called it, as a young man, when he read a summary of it in Benjamin Thorpe's Northern Mythology, which became a {{favourite}} book of his. In his The Earthly Paradise (1868–70) he included a versification of the story of Sigurd's daughter Aslaug, which he may have taken from Thorpe. In 1868 he began to learn Old Norse from the Icelandic scholar Eiríkr Magnússon, and embarked with him on a series of collaborative translations from the Icelandic classics. In 1870 they published Völsunga Saga: The Story of the Volsungs and Niblungs, with Certain Songs from the Elder Edda, claiming uncompromisingly in the preface that [...] "This is the Great Story of the North, which should be <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>our</b> race what the Tale of Troy was to the Greeks".|$|E
500|$|... 1972 was {{the least}} active year for the Who since they had formed. The group had {{achieved}} great commercial and critical success with the albums Tommy and Who's Next, but were struggling {{to come up with}} a suitable follow up. The group recorded new material with Who's Next collaborator Glyn Johns in May 1972, including [...] "Is It In My Head" [...] and [...] "Love Reign O'er Me" [...] which were eventually released on Quadrophenia, and a mini-opera called [...] "Long Live Rock – Rock Is Dead", but the material was considered too derivative of Who's Next and sessions were abandoned. In an interview for Melody Maker, guitarist and bandleader Pete Townshend said [...] "I've got to get a new act together… People don't really want to sit and listen <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>our</b> past". He had become frustrated that the group had been unable to produce a film of Tommy or Lifehouse (the abortive project that resulted in Who's Next), and decided to follow Frank Zappa's idea of producing a musical soundtrack that could produce a narrative in the same way as a film. Unlike Tommy, the new work would be grounded in reality and tell a story of youth and adolescence that the audience could relate to.|$|E

'To establish pictorial space', write Metzinger and Gleizes, 'we must have recourse to tactile and motor sensations, indeed <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>our</b> faculties. It is our whole personality, contracting or dilating, that transforms the plane of the picture. Since in reaction this plane reflects the viewer's personality back upon his understanding, pictorial space may be defined as a sensible passage between two subjective spaces'.|$|E

2500|$|By 1880, a {{new middle}} class had arisen in India and spread thinly across the country. Moreover, {{there was a}} growing {{solidarity}} among its members, created by the [...] "joint stimuli of encouragement and irritation." [...] The encouragement felt by this class came from its success in education {{and its ability to}} avail itself of the benefits of that education such as employment in the Indian Civil Service. It came too from Queen Victoria's proclamation of 1858 in which she had declared, [...] "We hold ourselves bound to the natives of our Indian territories by the same obligation of duty which bind us <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>our</b> other subjects." [...] Indians were especially encouraged when Canada was granted dominion status in 1867 and established an autonomous democratic constitution. Lastly, the encouragement came from the work of contemporaneous Oriental scholars like Monier Monier-Williams and Max Müller, who in their works had been presenting ancient India as a great civilisation. Irritation, on the other hand, came not just from incidents of racial discrimination {{at the hands of the}} British in India, but also from governmental actions like the use of Indian troops in imperial campaigns (e.g. in the Second Anglo-Afghan War) and the attempts to control the vernacular press (e.g. in the Vernacular Press Act of 1878).|$|E

[...] Buchanan continued, [...] "I think it's given us a fresh energy again. I think the one thing we wanted to do was come back with something different."

2500|$|Reading [...] the Midrash {{told that}} the people {{realized}} that they had spoken against Moses and prostrated themselves before him and beseeched him to pray to God on their behalf. The Midrash taught that then [...] immediately reports, “And Moses prayed,” to demonstrate the meekness of Moses, who {{did not hesitate to}} seek mercy for them, and also to show the power of repentance, for as soon as they said, “We have sinned,” Moses was immediately reconciled to them, for one who {{is in a position to}} forgive should not be cruel by refusing to forgive. In the same strain, [...] reports, “And Abraham prayed to God; and God healed” (after Abimelech had wronged Abraham and asked for forgiveness). And similarly, [...] reports, “And the Lord changed the fortune of Job, when he prayed for his friends” (after they had slandered him). The Midrash taught that when one person wrongs another but then says, “I have sinned,” the victim is called a sinner if the victim does not forgive the offender. For in [...] Samuel told the Israelites, “As for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the Lord in ceasing to pray for you,” and Samuel told them this after they came and said, “We have sinned,” as [...] indicates when it reports that the people said, “Pray for your servants [...] [...] [...] for we have added <b>to</b> <b>all</b> <b>our</b> sins this evil.” ...|$|E
