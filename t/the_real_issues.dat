25|$|Not {{long after}} {{declaring that the}} fight was off, Arum {{had a change of}} heart and offered Mayweather a 24-hour take-it-or-leave-it {{deadline}} to accept Team Pacquiao's terms for drug testing. Top Rank sent out a press release explaining their position on Mayweather's request for random Olympic-style drug testing. In it, Arum said Pacquiao was willing to submit to as many random urine tests requested, but as far as random blood tests were concerned, he was only willing to subject himself to 3 tests—one in January, one 30 days from the bout (no later than February 13) and one immediately after the fight: Let's be very clear on <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>issues</b> we differ on. It's not about being tested....It's about who does the testing and the scheduling of the procedures....The major issue related to the testing rests with which independent agency will administer these tests. The United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) cannot do it because they will not amend its procedures to accommodate the blood testing schedule we have outlined. USADA, under its guidelines, would have the right to administer random blood tests as many times as they want up to weigh-in day and that is ludicrous.|$|E

500|$|The U.S. population's {{perception}} of Black Lives Matter varies considerably by race. According to a September 2015 poll on race relations, {{nearly two-thirds of}} African Americans mostly agree with Black Lives Matter, while 42% of white Americans are unsure or {{do not have an}} opinion about Black Lives Matter. Of white people surveyed, 41% thought that Black Lives Matter advocated violence, and 59% of whites thought that Black Lives Matter distracted attention from <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>issues</b> of racial discrimination. By comparison, 82% of black people polled thought that Black Lives Matter was a nonviolent movement, and 26% of blacks thought that Black Lives Matter distracted attention from <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>issues</b> of racial discrimination. On the question of whether [...] "Black Lives Matter" [...] was mostly a movement or mostly a slogan, 46% of whites and 67% of blacks thought that it is mostly a movement. A similar poll in June 2016 found that 65% of black American adults supported Black Lives Matter and 40% of white American adults support it. Fifty-nine percent of black Americans thought that Black Lives Matter would [...] "be effective, in the long run, in helping blacks achieve equality" [...] and 34% of white Americans thought so. A 2017 Harvard-Harris survey found that 35% of whites and 83% of blacks have a favorable view of the movement.|$|E
500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} were {{generally}} mixed. Ramsey Isler of IGN noted his enjoyment of Dan Quagmire's character traits: [...] "I'll give the writing team credit for this little plot twist, as I'm sure we were all expecting the elder Quagmire {{to be even more}} of a womanizer than his son." [...] Regarding the episode's treatment of LGBT issues, Jason Hughes of TV Squad stated, [...] "there's a gold mine of material to dig into for satire and comedy; comedy which will likely offend as many people as <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>issues</b> do." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club called the scenes between Quagmire and his father [...] "surprisingly well-done" [...] while noting, [...] "the scenes where the mockery seemed a little too mean-spirited were definitely out of the show's worst sections of its toolkit". Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number ten on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of [...] "yukyukyuks" [...] and praised Brian's line of 'Hey... I fucked your dad' after Quagmire attacks him, describing it as [...] "amazing".|$|E

2500|$|The {{project was}} also opposed {{in a report}} by Dr Paul Mees, then of the Urban Planning Program, University of Melbourne, who {{concluded}} it was [...] "an expensive distraction from <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>issues.</b> The problems of overcrowding, late running and cancellations are actually a result of poor timetabling and management, not of infrastructure limitations. The problems could be solved quickly and inexpensively if the real problems were dealt with forcefully."

25|$|Such {{a stance}} of {{dividing}} blood into major components and minor fractions rather than either accepting all blood or requiring all blood components {{to be poured}} out onto the ground has led to criticism from {{organizations such as the}} Associated Jehovah's Witnesses for Reform on Blood. Witnesses respond that blood as the fluid per se is not <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>issue.</b> They say <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>issue</b> is respect and obedience regarding blood, which they perceive as being God's personal property. Members are allowed to eat meat that still contains small traces of blood remaining. Once blood is drained from an animal, the respect has been shown to God and then a person can eat the meat. Jehovah's Witnesses view of meat and blood is therefore different from the Jewish view that goes to great lengths to remove even minor traces of blood.|$|R

2500|$|After his losing mayoral campaign, Chavous became what The Washington Post {{called a}} [...] "frequent critic" [...] {{of the new}} mayor, Anthony A.

Chavous was an early supporter of Councilmember Carol Schwartz's tax cut package in March 1999, which became law in May. Chavous also led a nine-month effort to reconstitute and reform the D.C. Board of Education. [...] After a long battle with Mayor Williams and other Council members, the Council approved a plan {{to reduce the size}} of the board, and make four of the nine members subject to mayoral appointment (with Council confirmation). Voters were asked to approve the [...] "hybrid" [...] board, which they did so in a close vote in June 2000. According to The Washington Post, the bruising school board battle helped and hindered Chavous politically. While his allies said it showed he could tackle tough problems, dissenters argued that Chavous avoided <b>the</b> <b>real</b> <b>issues</b> (lack of money for schools and crumbling infrastructure). Chavous blamed the lengthy legislative process on unnamed individuals who he said did not engage in good faith in the process, but critics argued that Chavous never engaged in the kind of political hardball that was needed to move the reform bill along faster. Larry Gray, legislative chairman of the D.C. Congress of PTAs, blamed Chavous for deep cuts in the school budget during the past four years, failures in the teacher certification program, and significant delays in getting technology into the classroom.|$|E
