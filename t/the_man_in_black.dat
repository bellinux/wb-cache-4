The series was developed to capitalise on the popularity of The X-Files and Mission: Impossible.

Richard, however, refuses to go inside and instead shows Locke's body to Ben. Bram (Brad William Henke) and his team from Flight 316 enter the statue with Ben. <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> transforms into the Smoke Monster and easily kills Bram and his men, but spares Ben. <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> then tells Ben what Locke's final thoughts were, and explains that his own true goal is to return home. <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> finds this ironic because Locke wanted desperately to stay and live on the island. Outside, Richard sees the fireworks from the temple. <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> then confronts Richard, who realizes who the man is, but <b>the</b> <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> quickly knocks him out and announces that he is disappointed in the Others as he carries Richard into the jungle.|$|E
25|$|On {{the way to}} {{the heart}} of the Island, Jack's group {{encounters}} the Man in Black's group. Jack tells <b>the</b> <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> that he is going to kill him, and together with Desmond, they travel {{to the heart of the}} Island. Jack believes that Desmond can kill <b>the</b> <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> because he thinks Jacob brought him back not as bait but as a weapon. Desmond tells Jack that destroying the island and killing <b>the</b> <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> do not matter because he is going down to the heart of the island and leaving for another place. Jack and <b>the</b> <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> lower Desmond down to the heart of the island and he reaches a chamber, leading to a glowing pool with an elongated stone at its center. Immune to the pool's electromagnetic energy, Desmond manages to remove the giant stone stopper in the center of the pool. However, the light goes out and the pool dries up, setting about the destruction of the island which <b>the</b> <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> predicted. A result of Desmond's act is an unforeseen side-effect of making <b>the</b> <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> mortal again. During a prolonged fight, <b>the</b> <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> stabs Jack in the same spot where his appendix was taken out and almost kills him when Kate shoots <b>the</b> <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black</b> in the back, allowing Jack to kick him off the cliff to his death. The island continues to crumble and Jack realizes that he has to restore the light of the heart of the Island. He tells Kate to get Claire Littleton (Emilie De Ravin) on the plane and leave the island in case he fails.

2500|$|Season 6, the final, follows two timelines.

Having assumed the form of John Locke, the Smoke Monster seeks to escape the island and forces a final war between the forces of good and evil. The second timeline, called [...] "flash-sideways" [...] narrative, follows the lives of the main characters in a setting where Oceanic 815 never crashed, though additional changes are revealed as other characters are shown living completely different lives than they did. In the final episodes, a flashback to the distant past shows the origins of the island's power and of the conflict between Jacob and <b>the</b> <b>Man</b> <b>in</b> <b>Black,</b> who are revealed to be twin brothers, with Jacob desperate to keep his brother from leaving the island after he is transmogrified by the power of the island and becomes the Smoke Monster.

The Man in Black's mission since the beginning of the series: kill all of the candidates, thereby allowing him to leave the island once and for all. The ghost of Jacob appears to the last-of-the-surviving candidates, and Jack is appointed as the new protector. Jack catches up with <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>In</b> <b>Black,</b> who says that he wants to go to the [...] "heart of the island" [...] to turn it off and, therefore, finally leave the island. They reach the place, but after doing this, <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>In</b> <b>Black</b> becomes mortal. <b>The</b> <b>Man</b> <b>In</b> <b>Black</b> is killed by Kate, but Jack is seriously injured. Hurley, one of the survivors, becomes the new caretaker of the island.

Jack returns to the [...] "heart of the island" [...] and turns it on again, saving it. Hurley, as the new protector, asks Ben to help him in his new job, which he agrees. After having saved the island, Jack dies peacefully in the same place in which he woke up when he arrived on the island.
