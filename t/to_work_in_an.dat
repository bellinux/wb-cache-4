5|$|Around {{the time}} of the {{armistice}} which ended the war, Baker's engagement with Scott was broken off; Scott then began a relationship with an American diplomat in Paris, Philander Cable. Missing his fiancee and the excitement of the war, he felt directionless; he dreaded going back <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> office and considered himself a sportsman rather than a businessman. Though he was scheduled to return to the United States in December, Baker requested and was refused an extension of his time in France.|$|E
5|$|During {{his years}} of exile in Siberia, Piłsudski met many Sybiraks, {{including}} Bronisław Szwarce, who had almost become {{a leader of the}} January 1863 Uprising. He was allowed <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> occupation of his own choosing, and earned his living tutoring local children in mathematics and foreign languages (he knew French, German and Lithuanian in addition to Russian and his native Polish; he would later learn English). Local officials decided that as a Polish noble he was not entitled to the 10-ruble pension received by most other exiles.|$|E
5|$|The system, {{then known}} as RDF 1.5, would require {{a large number of}} {{ground-based}} transmitters <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> operational setting. Moreover, good reception was only achieved when the target, interceptor, and transmitter were roughly in a line. Due to these limitations, the basic concept was considered unworkable as an operational system, and all effort moved to designs with both the transmitter and receiver in the interceptor aircraft.|$|E

5|$|While Carlito was {{recovering}} from an injury, {{he was involved in}} a comical angle with SmackDown!'s general manager, Theodore Long. The storyline consisted of Carlito being forced to do demeaning chores around the arena, such as selling hot dogs, removing snow from parking lots with a shovel and mopping floors. As a result of these actions, Carlito created a petition in support of Long’s destitution, but was unsuccessful. On March 26, 2005, Colón performed {{for the first time in}} six months as Carlito, in a match against his younger brother Eddie Colón during an event in Caguas, Puerto Rico arriving to the stadium in a helicopter and under a massive standing ovation of the thousands of fans gather that night. Carlito made his WrestleMania debut in a non-wrestling role at WrestleMania 21, in which he interrupted an edition of Rowdy Roddy Piper's Piper's Pit, with Stone Cold Steve Austin as the special guest. This event led to an angle in the World Wrestling Council, where Piper and Carlito were booked to wrestle a match on Friday Madness, a special event presented by the company, which Piper won. Following WrestleMania, Carlito created an interview segment entitled Carlito’s Cabana. Carlito then entered a feud with The Big Show after a spot where Show refused an offer <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> enforcer role for Carlito.

The major permanent extant landmark of Expressionism is Erich Mendelsohn's Einstein Tower in Potsdam. By 1925 most of the leading architects of Expressionism such as; Bruno Taut, Erich Mendelsohn, Walter Gropius, Mies van der Rohe and Hans Poelzig, along with other Expressionists in the visual arts, had turned toward the Neue Sachlichkeit (New Objectivity) movement, a more practical and matter-of-fact approach which rejected the emotional agitation of expressionism. A few, notably Hans Scharoun, continued <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> expressionist idiom.|$|E
25|$|Similarly {{to other}} groups of {{immigrant}} Jews who made aliyah to Israel, the Ethiopian Jews have faced obstacles in their integration to Israeli society. Initially the main challenges of the Ethiopian Jewish community in Israel were {{due in part to}} communication difficulties (most of the population could not read or write in Hebrew, and much of the veteran population could not hold a simple conversation in the Hebrew language), discrimination in certain areas of the Israeli society, manifestations of racism from some parts of the Israeli society. Unlike Russian immigrants, many of whom arrive with job skills, Ethiopians came from a subsistence economy and were ill-prepared <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> industrialized society.|$|E

25|$|At last in May 1833 a Bill for the Abolition of Slavery in the Colonies was introduced. This {{was enacted}} later that year. The {{date for the}} {{termination}} of slavery was 1 August 1834, but slaves had to endure a further six-year 'apprenticeship' before they were granted full freedom. The planters ruthlessly abused this provision. A new law {{was passed by the}} Jamaican House of Assembly to thwart the intention behind the Act. This Jamaican legislation prevented emancipation by compelling former slaves <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> apprenticeship scheme under which the proceeds of their work were to be used to buy out inflated apprenticeship values of £60, £80, or £90 or higher, as set by their former owners. Knibb and others opposed these abuses, so that Parliament brought forward the date for full emancipation from 1840 to 1838.|$|E

500|$|Mechanical-electrical analogies {{are used}} to {{represent}} the function of a mechanical system as an equivalent electrical system by drawing analogies between mechanical and electrical parameters. [...] A mechanical system by itself can be so represented, but analogies are of greatest use in electromechanical systems {{where there is a}} connection between mechanical and electrical parts. [...] Analogies are especially useful in analysing mechanical filters. [...] These are filters constructed of mechanical parts but designed <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> electrical circuit through transducers. [...] Circuit theory is well developed in the electrical domain in general and in particular there is a wealth of filter theory available. [...] Mechanical systems can make use of this electrical theory in mechanical designs through a mechanical-electrical analogy.|$|E
