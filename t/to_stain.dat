5|$|Ruthenium is a {{component}} of mixed-metal oxide (MMO) anodes used for cathodic protection of underground and submerged structures, and for electrolytic cells for such processes as generating chlorine from salt water. The fluorescence of some ruthenium complexes is quenched by oxygen, finding use in optode sensors for oxygen. Ruthenium red, 6+, is a biological stain used <b>to</b> <b>stain</b> polyanionic molecules such as pectin and nucleic acids for light microscopy and electron microscopy. The beta-decaying isotope 106 of ruthenium is used in radiotherapy of eye tumors, mainly malignant melanomas of the uvea. Ruthenium-centered complexes are being researched for possible anticancer properties. Compared with platinum complexes, those of ruthenium show greater resistance to hydrolysis and more selective action on tumors.|$|E
5|$|Under a light microscope, {{the spores}} {{are seen to}} be smooth, {{elliptical}} to oblong in shape, with dimensions of 3–5 by 2–3µm. The basidia (the spore-bearing cells) are 4-spored, and have a narrow club-shape with dimension of 18–22 by 3.5–4.5µm. The gill cystidia are seen <b>to</b> <b>stain</b> blue when cotton blue dye and lactate are applied. The cap cuticle is made of an approximately 100µm thick layer of gelatinous hyphae that are about 2–4µm thick. The gelatinous hyphae are only present on the cap surface, not {{the surface of the}} stem; these local differences in cell structure explain the ease with which the scales are sloughed off the cap, but not the stems of the fruit bodies. The macroscopic and microscopic characteristics of the mycelia of this species grown in culture have been described in detail.|$|E

5|$|Variety subreticulatus, like variety boralis, has a {{generally}} darker coloration than the two-colored bolete, but varies {{much more than}} either. When fresh the coloration of the cap varies from a rose red, red, rose pink, dark red, and purple red. With age it changes to a cinnamon red or a rusty rose color, with yellowing toward the margin. The pore surface {{is similar to that}} of the main speciesyellow when fresh and with age changing to a dull ochre yellow; the bruising coloration is blue but is much lighter and sometimes not appearing <b>to</b> <b>stain</b> when bruised at all. The spore print is olive brown. The distribution of variety subreticulatus is very similar to the distribution of the two-colored bolete in North America, and appears north to eastern Canada and south to Florida, and west to Wisconsin.|$|E

25|$|As Glyn Uzzell noted, “Zahawi {{rejects the}} use of glazes, feeling that they can {{disguise}} the artist’s intention with a superficially enhancing gloss.

25|$|Since {{fluorescence}} emission differs in wavelength (color) {{from the}} excitation light, an ideal fluorescent image shows only {{the structure of}} interest that was labeled with the fluorescent dye. This high specificity led to {{the widespread use of}} fluorescence light microscopy in biomedical research. Different fluorescent dyes can be used <b>to</b> <b>stain</b> different biological structures, which can then be detected simultaneously, while still being specific due to the individual color of the dye.|$|E
25|$|It is {{also used}} <b>to</b> <b>stain</b> {{copolymers}} preferentially, the best known example being block copolymers where one phase can be stained so as to show the microstructure of the material. For example, styrene-butadiene block copolymers have a central polybutadiene chain with polystyrene end caps. When treated with OsO4, the butadiene matrix reacts preferentially and so absorbs the oxide. The presence of a heavy metal is sufficient to block the electron beam, so the polystyrene domains are seen clearly in thin films in TEM.|$|E

25|$|Since the 20th century, nylon {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{materials}} for the construction of carpets. Both nylon 6 and nylon 6-6 are used. Nylon can be dyed topically or dyed in a molten state (solution dying). Nylon can be printed easily and has excellent wear characteristics. Due to nylon's excellent wear-resistance, it is widely used in industrial and commercial carpeting. In carpets, nylon tends <b>to</b> <b>stain</b> easily because of the dye sites which exist on the fibre. These dye sites need to be filled in order to give nylon carpet any type of stain resistance. As nylon is petroleum-based it varies in price with the price of oil.|$|E
25|$|In biology {{methylene}} blue {{is used as}} a dye for a number of different staining procedures, such as Wright's stain and Jenner's stain. Since it is a temporary staining technique, {{methylene blue}} {{can also be used to}} examine RNA or DNA under the microscope or in a gel: as an example, a solution of methylene blue can be used <b>to</b> <b>stain</b> RNA on hybridization membranes in northern blotting to verify the amount of nucleic acid present. While methylene blue is not as sensitive as ethidium bromide, it is less toxic and it does not intercalate in nucleic acid chains, thus avoiding interference with nucleic acid retention on hybridization membranes or with the hybridization process itself.|$|E

A few male mods went against gender norms by using eye shadow, eye-pencil or even lipstick. Mods chose scooters over motorbikes partly because they were a symbol of Italian style and because their body panels concealed moving parts and made them less likely <b>to</b> <b>stain</b> clothes with oil or road dust.

25|$|One of the {{disadvantages}} of copper is its propensity <b>to</b> <b>stain</b> light-colored building materials, such as marble or limestone. Green staining is particularly visible on light-colored surfaces. Lead-coated copper {{can result in}} a black or gray stain that may blend well with lighter building materials. Staining can be reduced by collecting runoff in gutters and directing it away from the building via downspouts or by designing drip edges to help reduce the amount of copper laden moisture that comes into contact with material below. Coating the adjacent surface of the porous material with a clear silicone sealant also reduces staining. Staining may not develop in areas of rapid run-off due to the short dwell time of water on the copper.|$|E
25|$|A rosé wine {{incorporates}} some of {{the color}} from the grape skins, {{but not enough to}} qualify it as a red wine. It may be the oldest known type of wine, as it is the most straightforward to make with the skin contact method. The pink color can range from a pale orange to a vivid near-purple, depending on the varietals used and wine-making techniques. There are three primary ways to produce rosé wine: skin contact (allowing dark grape skins <b>to</b> <b>stain</b> the wort), saignée (removing juice from the must early in fermentation and continuing fermentation of the juice separately), and blending (uncommon and discouraged in most wine growing regions). Rosé wines can be made still, semi-sparkling, or sparkling, {{with a wide range of}} sweetness levels from dry Provençal rosé to sweet White Zinfandels and blushes. Rosé wines are made from a wide variety of grapes all over the world.|$|E
25|$|Live {{cells in}} {{particular}} generally lack sufficient contrast {{to be studied}} successfully, since the internal structures of the cell are colorless and transparent. The most common way to increase contrast is <b>to</b> <b>stain</b> the different structures with selective dyes, but this often involves killing and fixing the sample. Staining may also introduce artifacts, which are apparent structural details that are caused by the processing of the specimen and are thus not legitimate features of the specimen. In general, these techniques make use of differences in the refractive index of cell structures. It is comparable to looking through a glass window: you (bright field microscopy) don't see the glass but merely the dirt on the glass. There is a difference, as glass is a denser material, and this creates a difference in phase of the light passing through. The human eye is not sensitive to this difference in phase, but clever optical solutions have been devised to change this difference in phase into a difference in amplitude (light intensity).|$|E
