5|$|Mutiny of the Matoika is {{the common}} name for the events in July 1920 {{involving}} {{a large portion of}} the Olympic team of the United States while on board the U.S. Army transport ship , headed to Antwerp for the 1920 Summer Olympics. Princess Matoika was a last-minute substitute for another ship and, according to the athletes, did not have adequate accommodations or training facilities on board. Near the end of the voyage, the athletes published a list of grievances and demands and distributed copies of the document to the United States Secretary of War, the American Olympic Committee (AOC) members, and the press. The incident received wide coverage in American newspapers at the time and was still being discussed in the popular press years later. The event was not a mutiny in the <b>traditional</b> <b>sense,</b> but has been called that since the mid-1930s.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we explore the use of {{stochastic}} approaches for opportunistic access based on models of primary user activity. We focus in particular on a scenario where the secondary user does not perform <b>traditional</b> <b>sensing</b> at all, but relies only on statistical information of primary transmissions. Using techniques from the theory of alternating renewal processes we show that, for different primary user constraints, simple sta-tistical transmission schemes exist based on selecting sufficiently low transmission probability for the secondary user. We describe the general framework for deriving the required results, and give a detailed case study assuming that the primary transmitter activity patterns follow exponential distributions. The results for the exponential case show that limited but stable capacity {{can be achieved by}} the secondary user for any primary activity level. We also discuss the possible usage scenarios for such statistical approaches, focusing on situations in which <b>traditional</b> <b>sensing</b> is challenging due to high level of dynamics in the environment.

Most <b>traditional</b> <b>sensing</b> schemes assume that whether the authorized users exist maintains independent between two adjacent detection periods, and the probabilities of active state and idle state remain the same. This processing strategy can greatly simplify the sensing algorithms; however, it also results in a suboptimal sensing performance.|$|R

Although he was not physically handsome in the <b>traditional</b> <b>sense,</b> he tended to dominate every social and professional situation due to his enthusiasm, intelligence and charisma. As a result of his much-publicized divorce from Blair and his later marriage to Elswyth, he was also known for his stormy relationships with women.|$|E
5|$|Given {{that the}} Parliament does not form the {{government}} in the <b>traditional</b> <b>sense</b> of a Parliamentary system, its politics have developed along more consensual lines rather than majority rule of competing parties and coalitions. Indeed, for much of its life it has been dominated by a grand coalition of the European People's Party and the Party of European Socialists. The two major parties tend to co-operate to find a compromise between their two groups leading to proposals endorsed by huge majorities. However, this does not always produce agreement, and each may instead try to build other alliances, the EPP normally with other centre-right or right wing Groups and the PES with centre-left or left wing Groups. Sometimes, the Liberal Group is then in the pivotal position. There are also occasions where very sharp party political divisions have emerged, for example over the resignation of the Santer Commission.|$|E

Determining when to adjust {{a process to}} control impurity formation, or halt production and destroy end products should be an automatic task using experts’ knowledge, data (audio and chemical spectral footprints), adaptive models and algorithms, and different scales (data and models). Integrated sensing and processing (ISP) optimizes sensing systems that integrate the traditionally independent units of sensing, signal processing, communication and targeting. By employing ISP, computational complexity within <b>traditional</b> <b>sensing</b> system is substantially reduced through determining efficient low-dimensional representations of those sensing problems that were originally posed in high-dimensional settings by <b>traditional</b> <b>sensing</b> architecture. An ISP-based imaging spectrometer produces detector signals directly correlated to desired sample information, obviating the need for post-collection chemometrics and converting data directly to knowledge. We apply ISP techniques to novel acoustic spectral sensors designed and created {{as part of this}} project. The ISP is reprogrammable on demand. It uses data libraries that are created offline. The creation is expensive computationally, but it makes the use of the sensor easy. We have to use high performance computing facilities to quickly generate new or modified libraries...|$|R
5|$|Major {{cities and}} {{regional}} rivalry {{played an important}} role in the wars. The disappearance of a central, imperial authority—and in some cases of even a local, viceregal authority (as in the cases of New Granada and Río de la Plata)—initiated a prolonged period of balkanization in many regions of Spanish America. It was not clear which political units which should replace the empire, and there were no new national identities to replace the <b>traditional</b> <b>sense</b> of being Spaniards. The original juntas of 1810 appealed first, to a sense of being Spanish, which was counterposed to the French threat; second, to a general American identity, which was counterposed to the Peninsula lost to the French; and third, to a sense of belonging to the major cities or local province, the patria in Spanish. More often than not, juntas sought to maintain a province's independence from the capital of the former viceroyalty or captaincy general as much as from the Peninsula itself. Armed conflicts broke out between the provinces over the question of whether some cities or provinces were to be subordinate to others as they had been under the crown. This phenomenon was particularly evident in South America. This rivalry also leads some regions to adopt the opposite political cause to that chosen by their rivals. Peru seems to have remained strongly royalist in large part because of its rivalry with Río de la Plata, to which it had lost control of Upper Peru when the latter was elevated to a viceroyalty in 1776. The creation of juntas in Río de la Plata allowed Peru to regain formal control of Upper Peru for the duration of the wars.|$|E

40|$|AbstractRejoining {{fragmented}} marble {{structural members}} of the Acropolis of Athens monuments is achieved by inserting threaded titanium bars into holes pre-drilled {{in the body of}} the members. Then the holes are filled with liquid cementitious material. This study aims to investigate the extraction of the bars from the marble volume (pull-out) in an effort to enlighten the mechanisms activated before and during the phenomenon. The study is implemented experimentally. The main problem hard to overcome was the fact that the weak link of the marble-cement-titanium complex, which is the marble-cement interface, is inaccessible for <b>traditional</b> <b>sensing</b> techniques. In this context innovative techniques were employed (Acoustic Emission and Pressure Stimulated Currents), which can detect failure and damages at the interior of the complex. <b>Traditional</b> <b>sensing</b> techniques were used in parallel mainly for calibration / validation reasons. The specimens, prepared by experienced personnel of the Parthenon’s worksite, were prisms made of Dionysos marble. Threaded titanium bars were inserted into through holes filled with a liquid cement paste. The quantities recorded during the tests were the load, the displacement, the bar’s axial strain and relative slip with respect to the marble, the electrical signals emitted and the acoustic emissions produced. Conclusions are drawn concerning correlations between the above quantities. The data gathered were then used to validate numerical models which will be used for parametric analyses...|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{displacement}} sensing or estimation is {{an important}} task for reliably assessing the condition of civil infrastructure such as bridges and buildings, because the structural displacement describes {{the behavior of a}} structure and indicates structural safety according to the design limit. However, it is difficult to directly measure the displacement of a bridge structure due to the inaccessibility of a reference point especially when bridges are built over a highway, a river or the sea. As an alternative, an indirect displacement estimation using two different types of measurements such as strain and acceleration (i. e., multimetric data) has been developed. While the approach has been seen as promising, the combination of the <b>traditional</b> <b>sensing</b> system based on wired sensors and the multimetric data-based algorithm is inappropriate or impractical in real-world applications of the approach. This paper proposes a new displacement sensing system by incorporating wireless sensor technology with the multimetric data-based algorithm, which can address the difficulties and issues found in the <b>traditional</b> <b>sensing</b> system to realize a practical means of measuring displacement in full-scale bridges. The proposed wireless displacement sensing system enables (a) time-synchronized acceleration and strain measurement, (b) high-precision strain sensing and (c) improved applicability due to the wireless communication as well as the previous two features. The effectiveness of the proposed system is experimentally verified in laboratory and full-scale experiments. close 0...|$|R
