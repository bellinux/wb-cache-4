More than seventy years after the test, residual radiation at the site is about ten times higher than normal background radiation in the area.

The U.S. Department of Energy estimates that the lifetime cancer risk from inhaling 5,000 plutonium particles, each about 3µm wide, to be 1% over the background U.S. average. Ingestion or inhalation of large amounts may cause acute radiation poisoning and possibly death. However no human being {{is known to have}} died because of inhaling or ingesting plutonium, and many people have measurable amounts of plutonium in their bodies.|$|E

25|$|Medical X-rays are a {{significant}} source of man-made radiation exposure. In 1987, they accounted for 58% of exposure from man-made sources in the United States. Since man-made sources accounted for only 18% of the <b>total</b> <b>radiation</b> exposure, most of which came from natural sources (82%), medical X-rays only accounted for 10% of total American radiation exposure; medical procedures as a whole (including nuclear medicine) accounted for 14% of <b>total</b> <b>radiation</b> exposure. By 2006, however, medical procedures in the United States were contributing much more ionizing radiation than {{was the case in the}} early 1980s. In 2006, medical exposure constituted nearly half of the <b>total</b> <b>radiation</b> exposure of the U.S. population from all sources. The increase is traceable to the growth in the use of medical imaging procedures, in particular computed tomography (CT), and to the growth in the use of nuclear medicine.|$|E

40|$|The <b>total</b> dose <b>radiation</b> and {{annealing}} {{responses of}} the back transistor of Silicon-On-Insulator (SOI) pMOSFETs have been studied by comparing {{with those of the}} back transistor of SOI nMOSFETs fabricated on the same wafer. The transistors were irradiated by 60 Co γ-rays with various doses, and the front transistors are biased in a Float-State and Off-State, respectively, during irradiation. The <b>total</b> dose <b>radiation</b> {{responses of the}} back transistors are characterized by their threshold voltage shifts. The results show that the <b>total</b> dose <b>radiation</b> response of the back transistor of SOI pMOSFETs, similar to that of SOI nMOSFETs, depends greatly on their bias conditions during irradiation. However, with the Float-State bias, rather than the Off-State bias, the back transistors of SOI pMOSFETs reveal a much higher sensitivity to <b>total</b> dose <b>radiation,</b> which is contrary to those of SOI nMOSFETs. In addition, it is also found that the <b>total</b> dose <b>radiation</b> effect of the back transistor of SOI pMOSFETs irradiated with Off-State bias, {{as well as that of}} the SOI nMOSFETs, exhibits an increasing trend as the channel length decreases. The annealing response of the back transistors after irradiation at room temperature without bias, characterized by their threshold voltage shifts, indicates that there is a relatively complex annealing mechanism associated with channel length and type, bias condition during irradiation. In particular, for all the transistors irradiated with Off-State bias, their back transistors show an abnormal annealing effect during early annealing.

25|$|Which peak to use {{depends on}} the application. The {{conventional}} choice is the wavelength peak at 25.0% given by Wien's displacement law in its weak form. For some purposes the median or 50% point dividing the <b>total</b> <b>radiation</b> into two halves may be more suitable. The latter {{is closer to the}} frequency peak than to the wavelength peak because the radiance drops exponentially at short wavelengths and only polynomially at long. The neutral peak occurs at a shorter wavelength than the median for the same reason.|$|E
25|$|Technetium-99m {{has several}} {{features}} {{that make it}} safer than other possible isotopes. Its gamma decay mode can be easily detected by a camera, allowing the use of smaller quantities. And because technetium-99m has a short half-life, its quick decay into the far less radioactive technetium-99 results in relatively low <b>total</b> <b>radiation</b> dose to the patient per unit of initial activity after administration, as compared to other radioisotopes. In the form administered in these medical tests (usually pertechnetate), technetium-99m and technetium-99 are eliminated from the body within a few days.|$|E
25|$|Subsequent to surgery, {{radiotherapy}} {{becomes the}} mainstay of treatment for people with glioblastoma. It is typically performed along with giving temozolomide (TMZ). A pivotal clinical trial {{carried out in the}} early 1970s showed that among 303 GBM patients randomized to radiation or nonradiation therapy, those who received radiation had a median survival more than double those who did not. Subsequent clinical research has attempted to build on the backbone of surgery followed by radiation. On average, radiotherapy after surgery can reduce the tumor size to 107 cells. Whole-brain radiotherapy does not improve when compared to the more precise and targeted three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy.

However, the background radiation from cosmic rays increases with altitude, from 0.3mSv per year for sea-level areas to 1.0mSv per year for higher-altitude cities, raising cosmic radiation exposure to a quarter of <b>total</b> background <b>radiation</b> exposure for populations of said cities. Airline crews flying long distance high-altitude routes can be exposed to 2.2mSv of extra radiation each year due to cosmic rays, nearly doubling their <b>total</b> ionizing <b>radiation</b> exposure.|$|R
25|$|Radioiodine (radioactive iodine-131) was {{developed}} in the early 1940s at the Mallinckrodt General Clinical Research Center. This modality is suitable for most patients, although some prefer to use it mainly for older patients. Indications for radioiodine are failed medical therapy or surgery and where medical or surgical therapy are contraindicated. Hypothyroidism may be a complication of this therapy, but may be treated with thyroid hormones if it appears. The rationale for radioactive iodine is that it accumulates in the thyroid and irradiates the gland with its beta and gamma radiations, about 90% of the <b>total</b> <b>radiation</b> being emitted by the beta (electron) particles. The most common method of iodine-131 treatment is to administer a specified amount in microcuries per gram of thyroid gland based on palpation or radiodiagnostic imaging of the gland over 24 hours. Patients who receive the therapy must be monitored regularly with thyroid blood tests to ensure they are treated with thyroid hormone before they become symptomatically hypothyroid.|$|E

2500|$|In 1860, {{still not}} knowing of Stewart's {{measurements}} for selected qualities of radiation, Kirchhoff {{pointed out that}} it was long established experimentally that for total heat radiation, of unselected quality, emitted and absorbed by a body in equilibrium, the dimensioned <b>total</b> <b>radiation</b> ratio , has one and the same value common to all bodies, that is, for every value of the material index [...] Again without measurements of radiative powers or other new experimental data, Kirchhoff then offered a fresh theoretical proof of his new principle of the universality {{of the value of the}} wavelength-specific ratio [...] at thermal equilibrium.

2500|$|There are {{two main}} Van Allen belts – the inner belt and the outer belt – and a {{transient}} third belt. The inner belt is the more dangerous one, containing energetic protons. The outer one has less-dangerous low-energy electrons (Beta particles). The Apollo spacecraft passed through the inner belt {{in a matter of}} minutes and the outer belt in about [...] hours. The astronauts were shielded from the ionizing radiation by the aluminum hulls of the spacecraft. Furthermore, the orbital transfer trajectory from Earth to the Moon through the belts was chosen to lessen radiation exposure. Even Dr. James Van Allen, the discoverer of the Van Allen radiation belts, rebutted the claims that radiation levels were too harmful for the Apollo missions. Plait cited an average dose of less than 1rem (10mSv), which is equivalent to the ambient radiation received by living at sea level for three years. The <b>total</b> <b>radiation</b> received on the trip was about the same as allowed for workers in the nuclear energy field for a year and not much more than what Space Shuttle astronauts received.|$|E

Groups, including Beyond Nuclear and the Tillamook Estuaries Partnership, challenged these predictions on the basis of continued isotope releases after 2011, leading to a demand for more recent and comprehensive measurements as the radioactivity made its way east. These measurements were taken by a cooperative group of organizations under the guidance of a marine chemist with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, and it was revealed that <b>total</b> <b>radiation</b> levels, of which only a fraction bore the fingerprint of Fukushima, were not high enough to pose any direct risk to human life and in fact were far less than Environmental Protection Agency guidelines or several other sources of radiation exposure deemed safe.
