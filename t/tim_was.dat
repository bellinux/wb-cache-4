5|$|Although Weston and Stafford {{had known}} each other since their {{introduction}} at the King Sisters' party, they did not become romantically involved until 1945, when Weston traveled to New York to see Stafford perform at La Martinique. They were married in a Roman Catholic ceremony on February 26, 1952, before which Stafford converted to Catholicism. The wedding was conducted at St Gregory's Catholic Church in Los Angeles by Father Joe Kearney, a former guitarist with the Bob Crosby band who left the music business, trained as a priest and served as head of the Catholic Labor Institute. The couple left for Europe for a combined honeymoon and business trip: Stafford had an engagement at the London Palladium. Stafford and Weston had two children: <b>Tim</b> <b>was</b> born in 1952, and Amy in 1956. Both children followed their parents into the music industry.

Meanwhile, <b>Tim</b> <b>was</b> commended for his passion, determination and business knowledge, but the interviewers considered him to be naive and were concerned that stepping up to run one of Sir Alan's businesses would be a step too far, while Paul was deemed the weakest of the candidates, mostly due to his short temper and background in businesses that had very little relation to anything Sir Alan did.|$|E

Paul and Young were ejected from their Chevrolet Cobalt by the storm's sub-vortex, while <b>Tim</b> <b>was</b> still buckled in the passenger's seat.

A Doppler on Wheels-based analysis of how the tornado impacted these teams revealed that they were hit by an intense internal sub-vortex. Overall, the tornado was responsible for eight fatalities and 151 injuries.
