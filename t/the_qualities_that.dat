All these qualities come together in his most famous painted works, the Mona Lisa, the Last Supper, and the Virgin of the Rocks.|$|E

In recognition for his contribution to the club's success, McAllister was named as number 32 in the 100 Players Who Shook The Kop survey.|$|E
25|$|Swift's satire {{offers no}} resolutions. While he ridicules {{any number of}} foolish habits, he never offers the reader a {{positive}} set of values to embrace. While this type of satire became more common as people imitated Swift, later, Swift is quite unusual in offering the readers no way out. He does not persuade to any position, but he does persuade readers from an assortment of positions. This is one of <b>the</b> <b>qualities</b> <b>that</b> has made the Tale Swift's least-read major work.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before he}} had propounded the atomic theory, Dalton had {{attained}} a considerable scientific reputation. In 1803, he was chosen to give a series of lectures on natural philosophy at the Royal Institution in London, and he delivered another series of lectures there in 1809–1810. Some witnesses reported that he was deficient in <b>the</b> <b>qualities</b> <b>that</b> make an attractive lecturer, being harsh and indistinct in voice, ineffective {{in the treatment of}} his subject, and singularly wanting in the language and power of illustration.|$|E

25|$|In their {{attempts}} to assert control in India, the British faced fierce resistance in some regions while easily conquering others. British officials sought 'martial races' accustomed to hunting, or from agricultural cultures from hilly or mountainous regions {{with a history of}} conflict. Others were excluded due to their 'ease of living' or branded as seditious agitators. The doctrine of 'martial races' postulated that <b>the</b> <b>qualities</b> <b>that</b> make a useful soldier are inherited and that most Indians, {{with the exception of the}} specified groups, did not have the requisite traits that would make them warriors.|$|E
25|$|Stanley McCandless {{was perhaps}} the first to define {{controllable}} qualities of light used in theater. In A Method for Lighting the Stage, McCandless discusses color, distribution, intensity and movement as <b>the</b> <b>qualities</b> <b>that</b> can be manipulated by a lighting designer to achieve the desired visual, emotional and thematic look on stage. The McCandless Method, outlined in that book, is widely embraced today. The method involves lighting an object on the stage from three angles—2 lights at 45 degrees {{to the left and}} right, and one at 90 degrees (perpendicular {{to the front of the}} object).|$|E

It was, and still is believed, that <b>the</b> <b>qualities</b> <b>that</b> made the best interpreters were not just a perfect understanding of two or more languages, but more importantly a broad sense of culture, encyclopædic knowledge, inquisitiveness, as well as a naturally calm disposition.|$|E

500|$|Garfield had not {{actually}} written a speech, and {{was nervous about}} speaking in front of such a large crowd. Before heading to Chicago, Sherman told Garfield that Garfield's speech should stress Sherman's [...] "courageous persistence in any course he had adopted." [...] Garfield started his speech by emphasizing his overwhelming pride {{for his role in}} the convention. Garfield then listed <b>the</b> <b>qualities</b> <b>that</b> a president should possess and stressed the importance of party unity. [...] It wasn't until near his conclusion that he mentioned Sherman by name. Many reports of Garfield's speech describe it as enthusiastic, eloquent, and well received.

When Grey Beaver tied the thong around his neck, and passed {{the end of the}} thong into Beauty Smith's keeping, White Fang knew that it was his god's will for him to go with Beauty Smith. And when Beauty Smith left him tied outside the fort, he knew that it was Beauty Smith's will that he should remain there. Therefore, he had disobeyed the will of both the gods, and earned the {{consequent}} punishment. He had seen dogs change owners in the past, and he had seen the runaways beaten as he was being beaten. He was wise, and yet in the nature of him there were forces greater than wisdom. One of these was fidelity. He did not love Grey Beaver, yet, {{even in the face of}} his will and his anger, he was faithful to him. He could not help it. This faithfulness was a <b>quality</b> of <b>the</b> clay <b>that</b> composed him. It was <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>that</b> was peculiarly <b>the</b> possession of his kind; <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>that</b> set apart his species from all other species; <b>the</b> <b>quality</b> <b>that</b> has enabled <b>the</b> wolf and the wild dog to come in from the open and be the companions of man.|$|R

500|$|In June 1822, Mary Shelley {{suffered}} a miscarriage {{that left her}} depressed and irritable. After the conflicts this caused in her marriage, Percy Shelley developed strong feelings for Jane. He was particularly taken by her musical gifts and skill as a housewife. Shelley saw Jane as an ideal or even utopian woman, the embodiment of <b>the</b> <b>qualities</b> <b>that</b> he had always sought in a woman. This attraction and the close quarters in which the couples lived caused what {{has been described as}} [...] "an extraordinary and mounting tension within the isolated household". Though she was flattered by the attention, Jane was careful not to reciprocate openly in order to avoid arousing her husband's suspicions. She was successful in her attempts to prevent Edward from suspecting infidelity on her part.|$|E
