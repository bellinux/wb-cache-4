5|$|Advanced COPD {{leads to}} high {{pressure}} on the lung arteries, which strains the right ventricle of the heart. <b>This</b> <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> referred to as cor pulmonale, and leads to symptoms of leg swelling and bulging neck veins. COPD is more common than any other lung disease {{as a cause of}} cor pulmonale. Cor pulmonale has become less common since the use of supplemental oxygen.|$|E
5|$|Wigan lies on {{the meeting}} point of two primary A roads, the A49 and A577 which link to the M6, M61 {{motorway}} and M58 motorway. Increased traffic in recent years, encouraged by retail development, has resulted in very congested main roads {{for most of the}} day. <b>This</b> <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> linked to the town's geography, with river valleys and railway lines impeding road improvement.|$|E

5|$|About 1.2billion {{people in}} {{developing}} nations lack clean, safe water because most household and industrial wastes are dumped directly into rivers and lakes without treatment. This contributes to the rapid increase in waterborne diseases in humans. Out of India's 3119 towns and cities, just 209 have partial treatment facilities, and only 8 have full wastewater treatment facilities (WHO 1992). 114 cities dump untreated sewage and partially cremated bodies directly into the Ganges River. Downstream, the untreated water is used for drinking, bathing, and washing. <b>This</b> <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> typical of many rivers in India {{as well as other}} developing countries.|$|E
5|$|Hemoglobin is a tetramer {{with four}} oxygen binding sites. The binding of carbon {{monoxide}} {{at one of these}} sites increases the oxygen affinity of the remaining three sites, which causes the hemoglobin molecule to retain oxygen that would otherwise be delivered to the tissue. <b>This</b> <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> described as carbon monoxide shifting the oxygen dissociation curve to the left. Because of the increased affinity between hemoglobin and oxygen during carbon monoxide poisoning, little oxygen will actually be released in the tissues. This causes hypoxic tissue injury. Hemoglobin acquires a bright red color when converted into carboxyhemoglobin, so poisoned cadavers and even commercial meats treated with carbon monoxide acquire an unnatural reddish hue.|$|E
5|$|One complication—unintentional and unrecognized {{intubation}} of the esophagus—is both common (as frequent as 25% in {{the hands}} of inexperienced personnel) and likely to result in a deleterious or even fatal outcome. In such cases, oxygen is inadvertently administered to the stomach, from where it cannot be taken up by the circulatory system, instead of the lungs. If <b>this</b> <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> not immediately identified and corrected, death will ensue from cerebral and cardiac anoxia.|$|E

5|$|Some {{photovoltaic}} systems, such as rooftop installations, {{can supply}} power directly to an electricity user. In these cases, the installation can be competitive when the output cost matches the price {{at which the}} user pays for his electricity consumption. <b>This</b> <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> sometimes called 'retail grid parity', 'socket parity' or 'dynamic grid parity'. Research carried out by UN-Energy in 2012 suggests areas of sunny countries with high electricity prices, such as Italy, Spain and Australia, and areas using diesel generators, have reached retail grid parity.|$|E
5|$|Tiller {{effect is}} the {{expression}} {{used to describe}} how handlebars that extend far behind the steering axis (head tube) act like a tiller on a boat, in that one moves the bars to the right in order to turn the front wheel to the left, and vice versa. <b>This</b> <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> commonly found on cruiser bicycles, some recumbents, and some motorcycles. It can be troublesome when it limits the ability to steer because of interference or the limits of arm reach.|$|E
5|$|When {{the price}} {{elasticity}} {{of demand for}} a good is perfectly elastic (Ed is − ∞), any increase in the price, no matter how small, will cause the quantity demanded for the good to drop to zero. Hence, when the price is raised, the total revenue falls to zero. <b>This</b> <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> typical for goods that have their value defined by law (such as fiat currency); if a 5 dollar bill were sold for anything more than 5 dollars, nobody would buy it, so demand is zero.|$|E
50|$|Recently, new {{legislation}} has been enacted forbidding private hospitals to refuse treatment {{to patients with}} insufficient funds in case of life-threatening emergencies. The law also determines that the healthcare costs in <b>this</b> <b>situation</b> <b>are</b> to be paid by the SUS.|$|R

5|$|A problem {{faced by}} Unicamp, {{and other public}} {{universities}} in Brazil, is the high dependency on economic conditions, that directly impact tax earnings, {{while most of the}} expenses, payroll specially, are indexed to inflation. While not as critical as in similar universities (at the University of São Paulo payroll accounted for over 106% of the total funding available in 2014), Unicamp currently faces a funding crisis, with total funding expected to decrease in real terms while payroll, which takes around 85% of total university funding, is expected to increase in line with inflation. <b>This</b> <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> aggravated by the long-running trend of raising staff salaries above inflation {{as a response to the}} annual strikes led by the workers' union, STU.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the local}} {{television}} {{stations in the}} city, TVR Cluj (public) and One TV (private) broadcast regionally, while the others are restricted to the metropolitan area. Napoca Cable Network is available through cable, and broadcasts local content throughout the day. Other stations work as affiliates of national TV stations, only providing the audience with local reports {{in addition to the}} national programming. <b>This</b> <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> mirrored in the radio broadcasting companies: except for Radio Cluj, Radio Impuls and the Hungarian-language Paprika Rádió, all other stations are local affiliates of the national broadcasters. Casa Radio, situated on Donath Street, is one of the modern landmarks of the media and communications industry; it is, however, not the only one: Palatul Telefoanelor ("the telephone palace") is also a major modernist symbol of communications in the city centre.|$|E
5|$|The archetypal {{example of}} <b>this</b> <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> antithrombin, which circulates in plasma in a {{partially}} inserted relatively inactive state. The primary specificity determining residue (the P1 arginine) points toward {{the body of}} the serpin and is unavailable to the protease. Upon binding a high-affinity pentasaccharide sequence within long-chain heparin, antithrombin undergoes a conformational change, RCL expulsion, and exposure of the P1 arginine. The heparin pentasaccharide-bound form of antithrombin is, thus, a more effective inhibitor of thrombin and factor Xa. Furthermore, both of these coagulation proteases also contain binding sites (called exosites) for heparin. Heparin, therefore, also acts as a template for binding of both protease and serpin, further dramatically accelerating the interaction between the two parties. After the initial interaction, the final serpin complex is formed and the heparin moiety is released. This interaction is physiologically important. For example, after injury to the blood vessel wall, heparin is exposed, and antithrombin is activated to control the clotting response. Understanding of the molecular basis of this interaction enabled the development of Fondaparinux, a synthetic form of Heparin pentasaccharide used as an anti-clotting drug.|$|E

5|$|The {{continued}} {{retreat of}} glaciers {{will have a}} number of different quantitative effects. In areas that are heavily dependent on water runoff from glaciers that melt during the warmer summer months, a continuation of the current retreat will eventually deplete the glacial ice and substantially reduce or eliminate runoff. A reduction in runoff will affect the ability to irrigate crops and will reduce summer stream flows necessary to keep dams and reservoirs replenished. <b>This</b> <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> particularly acute for irrigation in South America, where numerous artificial lakes are filled almost exclusively by glacial melt. Central Asian countries have also been historically dependent on the seasonal glacier melt water for irrigation and drinking supplies. In Norway, the Alps, and the Pacific Northwest of North America, glacier runoff is important for hydropower.|$|E
5|$|Weaker tornadoes, and {{at times}} even {{stronger}} tornadoes, can occasionally lift, meaning their circulation ceases to affect the ground. The result is an erratic and discontinuous linear damage path, leading to the term skipping tornado. These discontinuities tend to occur over areas larger than the small neighborhoods where the house-skipping effect is observed, except possibly {{at the time of}} the birth and organization of the tornado. <b>This</b> <b>situation</b> <b>is</b> not commonly observed and the term is now rarely applied. Typically, when one tornado weakens and another forms, the process of successive parent mesocyclones forming and decaying is known as cyclic tornadogenesis, thus leading to a series of tornadoes spawned by the same supercell. This series of tornadoes is known as a tornado family.|$|E
