50|$|Yaw is {{induced by}} a {{moveable}} rudder-fin. The {{movement of the}} rudder changes the size and orientation of the force the vertical surface produces. Since the force is created at a distance behind the centre of gravity, this sideways force causes <b>a</b> <b>yawing</b> moment then <b>a</b> <b>yawing</b> motion. On <b>a</b> large aircraft there may be several independent rudders on the single fin for both safety and to control the inter-linked yaw and roll actions.|$|R
50|$|The {{yaw rate}} can be {{measured}} with accelerometers in the vertical axis. Any device intended to measure the yaw rate is called <b>a</b> <b>yaw</b> rate sensor.|$|R
50|$|A simple {{alternative}} to the balance indicator is <b>a</b> <b>yaw</b> string, which allows the pilot to simply view the string's movements as rudimentary indication of aircraft balance.|$|R
30|$|A {{combination}} of two bending axes (a pitch axis orthogonal to the shaft axis and <b>a</b> <b>yaw</b> axis, or vice versa) [7, 8, 9, 12, 13, 19, 20].|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>yaw</b> damper is <b>a</b> device used on many {{aircraft}} (usually {{jets and}} turboprops) to damp (reduce) the rolling and yawing oscillations {{known as the}} Dutch roll mode. It consists of yaw-rate sensors and a processor that provides a signal to an actuator connected to the rudder. The use of <b>a</b> <b>yaw</b> damper helps provide a better ride for passengers by preventing the uncomfortable yawing and rolling oscillation. On some aircraft it is mandatory for the yaw damper to be operational at all times during flight above a specified altitude.|$|R
40|$|A spinner {{anemometer}} {{can be used}} {{to measure}} the yaw misalignment and flow inclination experienced by a wind turbine. Previous calibration methods used to calibrate a spinner anemometer for flow angle measurements were based on measurements of a spinner anemometer with default settings (arbitrary values, generally k 1,d  [*]=[*]  1 and k 2,d  [*]=[*]  1) and <b>a</b> reference <b>yaw</b> misalignment signal measured with <b>a</b> <b>yaw</b> position sensor. The yaw position sensor is normally present in wind turbines for control purposes; however, such a signal is not always available for a spinner anemometer calibration. Therefore, <b>an</b> additional <b>yaw</b> position sensor was installed prior to the spinner anemometer calibration. An innovative method to calibrate the spinner anemometer without <b>a</b> <b>yaw</b> positions sensor was then developed. It was noted that a non-calibrated spinner anemometer that overestimates (underestimates) the inflow angle will also overestimate (underestimate) the wind speed when there is <b>a</b> <b>yaw</b> misalignment. The new method leverages the non-linearity of the spinner anemometer algorithm to find the calibration factor  F α by an optimization process that minimizes the dependency of the wind speed on the yaw misalignment. The new calibration method was found to be rather robust, with F α  values within ± 2. 7  % of the mean value for four successive tests at the same rotor position...|$|R
5000|$|The roller <b>yaw</b> bearing is <b>a</b> common {{technical}} <b>yaw</b> bearing solution {{followed by}} many wind turbine manufacturers as it offers low turning friction and smooth {{rotation of the}} nacelle. The low turning friction permits the implementation of slightly smaller yaw drives (compared to the gliding bearing solution), {{but on the other}} hand requires <b>a</b> <b>yaw</b> braking system.|$|R
2500|$|Following flights {{revealed}} a propensity to [...] "Dutch roll" [...] - <b>an</b> alternating <b>yawing</b> and rolling motion. Boeing already had {{experience with this}} on the B-47 Stratojet and B-52 Stratofortress and had developed <b>a</b> <b>yaw</b> damper system on the B-47 that could be adapted to the Dash 80. Other problems were found with the engines and brakes, the latter once failing completely on landing causing the aircraft to overshoot the runway.|$|R
40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} <b>a</b> <b>yaw</b> {{stability control system}} for a vehicle. At least one yaw rate sensor (5) is arranged to generate a signal indicative of the vehicle <b>yaw</b> rate. <b>A</b> controller is responsive to <b>a</b> <b>yaw</b> rate error. The controller is arranged to activate yaw angle control part (1) of the controller, {{in response to a}} body-force-disturbance being detected by at least one body-force-disturbance detection unit (7), and to start performing control of the yaw angle error in order to obtain a correction of the vehicle yaw angle resulting from the body-force-disturbance, and input to the system for performing vehicle yaw stability control operations (6) a signal to perform <b>a</b> body-force-disturbance <b>yaw</b> stability control operation for eliminating the vehicle yaw angle resulting from the body-force-disturbance and returning the vehicle to a pre body-force-disturbance heading...|$|R
50|$|The vertical/Z axis, or <b>yaw</b> axis, is <b>an</b> {{imaginary}} line running vertically {{through the}} ship and through its centre of gravity. <b>A</b> <b>yaw</b> motion is <b>a</b> side-to side {{movement of the bow}} and stern of the ship.|$|R
60|$|It was {{as large}} as a silver dollar, that yaw, and it took all of three weeks to heal. There were times when Charmian could not walk because of the hurt of it; and there were times upon times when she {{explained}} that abaft the ankle-bone was the most painful place to have <b>a</b> <b>yaw.</b> I explained, in turn, that, never having experienced <b>a</b> <b>yaw</b> in that locality, I was driven to conclude the hollow of the instep was the most painful place for yaw-culture. We left it to Martin, who disagreed with both of us and proclaimed passionately that the only truly painful place was the shin. No wonder horse- racing is so popular.|$|R
50|$|The <b>yaw</b> {{drive is}} <b>an</b> {{important}} component of the horizontal axis wind turbines' yaw system. To ensure the wind turbine is producing the maximal amount of electric energy at all times, the yaw drive is used to keep the rotor facing into the wind as the wind direction changes. This only applies for wind turbines with a horizontal axis rotor. The wind turbine is said to have <b>a</b> <b>yaw</b> error if the rotor is not aligned to the wind. <b>A</b> <b>yaw</b> error implies that a lower share of the energy in the wind will be running through the rotor area. (The generated energy will be proportional the cosine of the yaw error).|$|R
5000|$|Roll rate generates fin lift causing <b>a</b> <b>yawing</b> {{moment and}} also {{differentially}} alters the lift on the wings, thus affecting the induced drag contribution of each wing, causing <b>a</b> (small) <b>yawing</b> moment contribution. Positive roll generally causes positive [...] values unless the empennage is anhedral or fin {{is below the}} roll axis. Lateral force components resulting from dihedral or anhedral wing lift differences has little effect on [...] because the wing axis is normally closely aligned with the center of gravity.|$|R
50|$|The second {{lateral motion}} is an oscillatory {{combined}} roll and yaw motion called Dutch roll, {{perhaps because of}} its similarity to an ice-skating motion {{of the same name}} made by Dutch skaters; the origin of the name is unclear. The Dutch roll may be described as <b>a</b> <b>yaw</b> and roll to the right, followed by a recovery towards the equilibrium condition, then an overshooting of this condition and <b>a</b> <b>yaw</b> and roll to the left, then back past the equilibrium attitude, and so on. The period is usually on the order of 3-15 seconds, but it can vary from a few seconds for light aircraft to a minute or more for airliners. Damping is increased by large directional stability and small dihedral and decreased by small directional stability and large dihedral. Although usually stable in a normal aircraft, the motion may be so slightly damped that the effect is very unpleasant and undesirable. In swept-back wing aircraft, the Dutch roll is solved by installing <b>a</b> <b>yaw</b> damper, in effect a special-purpose automatic pilot that damps out any yawing oscillation by applying rudder corrections. Some swept-wing aircraft have an unstable Dutch roll. If the Dutch roll is very lightly damped or unstable, the <b>yaw</b> damper becomes <b>a</b> safety requirement, rather than a pilot and passenger convenience. Dual yaw dampers are required and <b>a</b> failed <b>yaw</b> damper is cause for limiting flight to low altitudes, and possibly lower Mach numbers, where the Dutch roll stability is improved.|$|R
25|$|Trials {{were carried}} out on the USS New Mexico, with the {{controller}} controlling the angular velocity (not angle) of the rudder. PI control yielded sustained yaw (angular error) of ±2°. Adding the D element yielded <b>a</b> <b>yaw</b> error of ±1/6°, better than most helmsmen could achieve.|$|R
50|$|<b>A</b> <b>yaw</b> damper is <b>a</b> {{transverse}} mounted {{shock absorber}} {{used to prevent}} railcars and locomotives from swaying excessively from side to side. Yaw dampers prevent locomotives and passenger railcars from striking station platforms as they roll past them and reduce the gap that must be left between the railroad vehicle and the platform.|$|R
40|$|Results are {{presented}} of calculations {{of the three}} dimensional steady transonic flow over <b>a</b> finite <b>yawed</b> wing. The full potential flow equation is solved in a transformed coordinate system which permits the boundary conditions to be satisfied exactly. The correct differential properties are enforced by rotating the difference scheme to conform with the flow direction, and fast convergence is assured by simulating a time dependent equation designed to settle quickly to a steady state. Computed lift drag ratios {{are consistent with the}} results of wind tunnel tests of <b>a</b> <b>yawed</b> wing conducted by R. T. Jones (1972). ...|$|R
50|$|Sparring (loba) <b>takes</b> {{place in}} <b>a</b> 5-6.5 metres square. Matches are divided {{primarily}} by age {{but also by}} weight. A dre (equal to 12 points) is awarded for proper form and technique to permitted targets. If a move is executed effectively but slightly incorrectly, a dha (6 points) is awarded. Matches are light-contact, so <b>a</b> <b>yaw</b> (3 points) may be awarded if the competitor performs a move correctly but stops short of making contact. Using excessive force, even to legal scoring areas, results in a penalty or disqualification.|$|R
50|$|Aircraft on {{the ground}} have a natural {{pivoting}} point on an axis through the main landing gear contact points the effects of toe in/toe out. As most of the side area of an aircraft will typically be behind this pivoting point, any crosswind will create <b>a</b> <b>yawing</b> moment tending to turn {{the nose of the}} aircraft into the wind.|$|R

50|$|T. pallidum pertenue {{has been}} {{identified}} in non-human primates (baboons, chimpanzees, and gorillas) and studies show that experimental inoculation of human beings with a simian isolate causes yaws-like disease. However, no evidence exists of crosstransmission between human beings and primates, but {{more research is needed}} to discount the possibility of <b>a</b> <b>yaws</b> animal reservoir in non-human primates.|$|R

The YF-12 had been wrecked in a 1966 landing accident. This Blackbird was seemingly not quite straight and had <b>a</b> <b>yaw</b> at supersonic speeds. It was nicknamed [...] "The Bastard".|$|R
40|$|With many Tidal Energy Conversion (TEC) devices at {{full scale}} {{prototype}} stage {{there are two}} distinct design groups for Horizontal Axis Tidal Turbines (HATTs). Devices with <b>a</b> <b>yaw</b> mechanism allowing the turbine to always face into the flow, and devices with blades that can rotate through 180 ° to harness a strongly bi-directional flow. As marine turbine technology verges on the realm of economic viability this paper reveals the performance of Cardiff University's concept tidal turbine with its support structure either upstream or downstream and with various proximities between the rotating plane of the turbine and its support stanchion. Through the use of validated Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) modelling this work shows the optimal proximity between rotor plane and stanchion as well as establishing, in the given context, the use of <b>a</b> <b>yaw</b> mechanism to be superior to a bi-directional system from a performance perspective...|$|R
40|$|A {{humanoid}} robot includes a torso, {{a pair of}} arms, a neck, a head, a wrist joint assembly, and a control system. The arms and the neck movably extend from the torso. Each of the arms includes a lower arm and a hand that is rotatable relative to the lower arm. The wrist joint assembly is operatively defined between the lower arm and the hand. The wrist joint assembly includes <b>a</b> <b>yaw</b> axis and <b>a</b> pitch axis. The pitch axis is disposed in a spaced relationship to the yaw axis such that the axes are generally perpendicular. The pitch axis extends between the yaw axis and the lower arm. The hand is rotatable relative to the lower arm about each of the yaw axis and the pitch axis.

The objective of the control is to track the lane centerline. The first controller uses the sensor output which is <b>a</b> combination of <b>yaw</b> and lateral error. The second controller achieves tracking objective by providing <b>a</b> <b>yaw</b> rate to the vehicle so as to keep the lateral error dynamics stable.

50|$|The {{asymmetric}} flow {{around a}} ship {{induced by the}} vicinity of banks causes pressure differences (Bernoulli's principle) between port and starboard sides. As a result, a lateral force will act on the ship, mostly directed towards the closest bank, as well as <b>a</b> <b>yawing</b> moment pushing her bow towards {{the centre of the}} waterway. The squat effect increases due to the decreased blockage.|$|R
50|$|The torque {{vectoring}} rear axle differential is designed and manufactured by Magna Powertrain, {{and is being}} offered on Audi A4, A5, A6 and their derivatives (including RS models). The Sport Differential selectively distributes torque to the rear axle wheels thereby generating <b>a</b> <b>yaw</b> moment, which improves handling and also stabilizes the vehicle when it oversteers or understeers, thereby increasing safety.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two types}} of yaw dampers: series yaw dampers and {{parallel}} yaw dampers. The servo actuator of <b>a</b> parallel <b>yaw</b> damper will actuate the rudder independently of the rudder pedals while the servo actuator of <b>a</b> series <b>yaw</b> damper is clutched to the rudder control quadrant and will result in pedal movement when the system commands the rudder to move.|$|R
5000|$|Gliding yaw bearing - Electric yaw drive: The nacelle {{is mounted}} on a {{friction}} based gliding bearing and the azimuth rotation is achieved via a plurality of powerful electric drives. The need for <b>a</b> <b>yaw</b> brake is eliminated and {{depending on the size}} of the yaw system (i.e. size of the wind turbine) the gliding bearing concept can lead to significant cost savings.|$|R
40|$|Off-surface smoke flow {{visualization}} {{and extensive}} pressure measurements were obtained on the forebody of the NASA F- 18 High Alpha Research Vehicle equipped with actuated forebody strakes. Test points at alpha = 50 deg. {{were examined in}} which only one strake was deflected or in which both strakes were deflected differentially. The forebody pressures were integrated to obtain forebody yawing moments. Results showed that small single strake deflections can cause <b>an</b> undesirable <b>yawing</b> moment reversal. At alpha = 50 deg., this reversal was corrected by deploying both strakes at 20 deg. initially, then differentially from 20 deg. to create <b>a</b> <b>yawing</b> moment. The off-surface flow visualization showed {{that in the case}} of the small single strake deflection, the resulting forebody/strake vortex remained close to the surface and caused accelerated flow and increased suction pressures on the deflected side. When both strakes were deflected differentially, two forebody/strake vortices were present. The forebody/strake vortex from the larger deflection would lift from the surface while the other would remain close to the surface. The nearer forebody/strake vortex would cause greater flow acceleration, higher suction pressures and <b>a</b> <b>yawing</b> moment on that side of the forebody. Flow visualization provided a clear description of the strake vortices fluid mechanics...|$|R

As he crossed the Pacific coast of North America, the tracking station at Guaymas, Mexico, informed Mercury Control in Florida that <b>a</b> <b>yaw</b> thruster was causing attitude control problems. Glenn later recalled, this problem [...] "was to stick {{with me for the}} rest of the flight." ...|$|R
50|$|Vertical axis wind {{turbines}} (VAWT) {{do not need}} <b>a</b> <b>yaw</b> system since their vertical rotors can face the wind from any direction and only their self rotation gives the blades a clear direction of the air flow.
