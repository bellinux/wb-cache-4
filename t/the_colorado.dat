5|$|For a short stretch, <b>the</b> <b>Colorado</b> {{watershed}} {{meets the}} drainage basin of the Snake River, {{a tributary of}} the Columbia River, in the Wind River Range of western Wyoming. Southwest of there, the northern divide of <b>the</b> <b>Colorado</b> watershed skirts the edge of the Great Basin, bordering on the closed drainage basins of the Great Salt Lake and the Sevier River in central Utah, and other closed basins in southern Utah and Nevada. To the west in California, <b>the</b> <b>Colorado</b> River watershed borders on those of small closed basins in the Mojave Desert, the largest of which is the Salton Sea drainage north of <b>the</b> <b>Colorado</b> River Delta. On the south, the watersheds of the Sonoyta, Concepción, and Yaqui rivers, all of which drain to the Gulf of California, border that of <b>the</b> <b>Colorado.</b>|$|E

5|$|The entire Colorado Plateau {{then started}} to uplift from near sea level to several {{thousand}} feet (over a kilometer) in elevation.

Whatever the order of events were, the High Plateaus region of <b>the</b> <b>Colorado</b> Plateau were by now nearly complete.|$|E

50|$|May 26 is Infantry Day in Bolivia in {{recognition}} of the Colorados' bravery throughout the whole battle of Tacna, led by regimental commander Colonel Ildefonso Murguia Anze and regimental drummer Juan Pinto.

(Rotos, be shaken, because <b>the</b> <b>Colorados</b> of Bolivia have come!) and formed a gallant defense alongside their Peruvian allies.

5|$|As {{recently}} as the Cretaceous period 100million years ago, much of western North America was still part of the Pacific Ocean. Tectonic forces from the collision of the Farallon Plate with the North American Plate pushed up the Rocky Mountains between 75 and 50million {{years ago in a}} mountain-building episode known as the Laramide orogeny. <b>The</b> <b>Colorado</b> first formed as a west-flowing stream draining the southwestern portion of the range, and the uplift also diverted the Green River from its original course to the Mississippi River west towards <b>the</b> <b>Colorado.</b> About 30 to 20million years ago, volcanic activity related to the orogeny led to the Mid-Tertiary ignimbrite flare-up, which created smaller formations such as the Chiricahua Mountains in Arizona and deposited massive amounts of volcanic ash and debris over the watershed. <b>The</b> <b>Colorado</b> Plateau first began to rise during the Eocene, between about 55 and 34million years ago, but did not attain its present height until about 5million years ago, about when <b>the</b> <b>Colorado</b> River established its present course into the Gulf of California.|$|E
5|$|As the 1950s began, {{demand on}} <b>the</b> <b>Colorado</b> River – which forms {{the border of}} California and Arizona and {{provided}} most of Southern California's water – was moving toward unsustainable levels. The Bureau of Reclamation restarted its surveys of the Trinity River basin {{as part of a}} larger proposal to move water from northern to southern parts of the state, and compensate for the shortages on <b>the</b> <b>Colorado.</b> The United Western Investigation, in 1951, proposed the damming of nearly every river in the North Coast region of California, chiefly the Trinity, Klamath and Eel. The Ah Pah Dam would have flooded the canyons of the Klamath and Trinity Rivers to form the largest reservoir in California. These grandiose plans culminated in the Pacific Southwest Water Plan of 1964, which sought to comprehensively link the water systems of California and the rest of <b>the</b> <b>Colorado</b> River Basin. One of the key projects was an aqueduct to transport North Coast water to the Imperial Valley, reducing its reliance on water from <b>the</b> <b>Colorado</b> River. However, with the exception of the upper Trinity River project, none of these dam and diversion projects were ever realized.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} Whitewater River and local washes were {{considered}} {{the primary source}} of these sands, which would have been transported to the Algodones area by longshore drift. This would imply a minimum age of 160,000 years. Later <b>the</b> <b>Colorado</b> River was identified as the main source of these sediments, potentially with some contribution from local drainages. At prevailing winds, most of the sediments from <b>the</b> <b>Colorado</b> would have been transported to the Cerro Prieto area and possibly carried by wind to the Gran Desierto de Altar.|$|E
50|$|The Battle of Manantiales {{was fought}} in southwestern Uruguay {{as part of}} the {{internal}} conflict between the Blancos and <b>the</b> <b>Colorados</b> that had been going on intermittently since the country's independence.

5|$|Drainage of <b>the</b> <b>Colorado</b> Plateau was {{significantly}} altered by {{the opening of}} the Gulf of California. Rifting tore Baja California Peninsula northwestward from the Mexican mainland starting some 10 to 5mya. The ancestral Colorado River responded to the regional downwarping by taking a shortcut to the sea by flowing into the new gulf. This significantly decreased the distance from the river's headwaters and its delta at the sea. Water in <b>the</b> <b>Colorado</b> and its tributaries moved faster as a result and cut down deeper, creating the canyonland topography.|$|E
