The recursive system identification methods are used to replace the previous Batch Least Squares (BLS) method in the algorithm.

40|$|To {{reach the}} {{millimeter}} {{satellite laser ranging}} accuracy the Portable- Pico Event Timer [1, 2] has been upgraded in 2002. The main objectives of the upgrade were to achieve a timing jitter below 3 psec, to decrease the temperature and temporal drift of an entire device and to enable {{the operation of the}} Portable Calibration Standard based on an upgraded P-PET at the stations equipped with the multi kHz lasers. Within the upgrade, the P-PET has been equipped with the recent models of the Thales (Dassault) timing and frequency synthesis <b>modules</b> providing <b>timing</b> resolution of 1. 2 psec with the timing jitter below 2. 5 psec per channel. The new input board has been constructed, providing the advanced gating and arming options. This upgrade, together with the built in software modifications, gives to P-PET the possibility to cooperate with the high repetition rate laser ranging systems. The maximum rate is 100 P-PET measurements per second. If the laser system under test is operating at repetition rate higher than 100 Hz, the P-PET samples the measurements with the repetition rate of 100 measurements per second. The repetition rate of the laser system under test may be as high as 2 MHz. The timing linearity self test option has been included into the P-PET. In the self test operation mode, the lowest 12 bits of the epoch (corresponding to the interval 0 - 5 nsec) is output from both the <b>timing</b> <b>modules.</b> The dependence of the measured interval in the “cable ranging test ” on the reading of one of the <b>timing</b> <b>modules</b> gives an estimate of the <b>timing</b> <b>modules</b> linearity within the 5 nsec window.

Subsequently a BAW (Bulk Acoustic Wave) resonator can be further associated over the quartz resonator to form a MEMS-based freely programmable oscillator for stable clock generation, covering a large frequency range between 1 and 50 MHz. The principal fabrication processes include the implementation of Through-Silicon Vias (TSV) in active CMOS wafers, temporary wafer bonding for thin wafer handling and wafer bonding for metallic sealing under vacuum and formation of electrical interconnects. The components were packaged by chip to wafer assembly onto active CMOS wafers with TSVs and subsequent wafer to wafer bonding with a corresponding cavity cap wafer for vacuum encapsulation.

40|$|Abstract—Advanced {{fluorescence}} {{measurements on}} single molecules demand single-photon detectors with high-quantum detection efficiency, low noise, and high time resolution. We {{have developed a}} compact (82 60 30 mm) and versatile single-photon <b>timing</b> <b>module</b> (SPTM), based on a planar epitaxial single photon avalanche diodes (SPAD) working with a monolithic integrated active quenching and active reset circuit (i-AQC) and cooled by a Peltier element. The main operating parameters are computer controlled via RS- 232 interface and the photon counting rate can be continuously monitored. The photon detection efficiency is 45 % at 500 nm with cooling at 15 C, the dark counting rate is 5 c/s with SPAD operating at 5 V excess bias voltage, 10 c/s operating at 10 V. The time resolution obtained with tightly focused illumination has 60 -ps full-width at half-maximum. Comparative tests with the SPTM prototype and with an advanced commercially available photon counting module confirmed that the time resolution and sensitivity of the SPTM {{make it possible to}} resolve and measure even short lifetime components of a single molecule.

In general, blocked errors are saved in the data memory. The data memory thus enables the FPM to issue advisory messages even though the error was committed {{in the past and}} is not active anymore. However, a delayed submission makes only sense within a restricted time period after the detection. The filtering therefore also eliminates errors which are considered inactive for too long without writing these to the data memory.|$|E

40|$|On-chip signal {{extraction}} and characterization {{structures are}} slowly becoming a necessary component of any complex integrated circuit design. The increased {{integration of the}} modern System On a Chip has necessitated {{the development of these}} alternate test strategies {{to address the issue of}} device node access and signal integrity. The process of extracting a signal in an analog form across a chip boundary can often compromise its true nature, as these new systems stretch performance limits. The aim of this thesis is to introduce two circuits for on-chip sub-nanosecond signal capture. The emphasis is placed on providing gigahertz rate effective sampling resolutions to provide a progressive characterization solution for the ever increasing operating speed of integrated circuits. The first circuit presented is a hardware implementation of an undersampling algorithm that extends the operation of a pre-existing mixed-signal test-core to the capture of periodic signals with a bandwidth much greater than the sample rate of the system. This hardware unit comprises of a specialized <b>timing</b> <b>module</b> based on a Delay Locked Loop with tap selection circuitry. The effective sampling resolution of the system is limited by the intrinsic gate delay of the technology the <b>timing</b> <b>module</b> is implemented in. The second circuit presented is a specialized jitter measurement device. This device is based on a Vernier Delay Line Time-to-Digital converter, and can provide resolutions well below a gate delay. Special emphasis was given to jitter measurement, since it is an issue that is often difficult to address adequately in the testing of many complex circuits. Both the aforementioned circuits were implemented in a 0. 35 mum CMOS process, and results demonstrating their successful operation are presented...|$|E
