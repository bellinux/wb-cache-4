5|$|A {{compound}} {{in the milk}} of the tammar wallaby called AGG01 has <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a new and powerful antibiotic. AGG01 is a protein, and in laboratory tests {{has proven to be}} 100 times more effective than penicillin. It has killed over 99% of the pathogenic bacteria, (both Gram-positive and Gram-negative), that it was incubated with, including Salmonella, Proteus vulgaris and Staphylococcus aureus. It also killed one species of fungus. Subsequent analysis of the genome has led to the discovery of several cathelicidin peptides, which could also be used as antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} species of Cyathus produce {{metabolites}} with biological activity, and novel chemical structures that are specific to this genus. For example, cyathins are diterpenoid compounds produced by C.helenae, C.africanus and C.earlei. Several of the cyathins (especially cyathins B3 and C3), including striatin compounds from C.striatus, show strong antibiotic activity. Cyathane diterpenoids also stimulate nerve growth factor synthesis, and have <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> developed into therapeutic agents for neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease. Compounds named cyathuscavins, isolated from the mycelial liquid culture of C.stercoreus, have significant antioxidant activity, as do the compounds known as cyathusals, also from C.stercoreus. Various sesquiterpene compounds have also been identified in C.bulleri, including cybrodol (derived from humulene), nidulol, and bullerone.|$|E
5|$|Cabbage {{has been}} linked to {{outbreaks}} of some food-borne illnesses, including Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium botulinum. The latter toxin has been traced to pre-made, packaged coleslaw mixes, while the spores were found on whole cabbages that were otherwise acceptable in appearance. Shigella species are able to survive in shredded cabbage. Two outbreaks of E.coli in the United States have been linked to cabbage consumption. Biological risk assessments have concluded that there is the potential for further outbreaks linked to uncooked cabbage, due to contamination at many stages of the growing, harvesting and packaging processes. Contaminants from water, humans, animals and soil have <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> transferred to cabbage, and from there to the end consumer.|$|E

While the surf did rise somewhat, the waves were significantly lower than the heights experienced during Pauline. The U.S. Coast Guard received a report of an overdue sailing vessel en route to the Hawaiian Island group. However, it is unknown if Pauline or Rick affected the boat's course.|$|E

Janikowski also handled kickoffs, kicking the ball so hard that 57 of his 83kickoffs were touchbacks.

At Backlash, Edge defeated Chris Benoit in a Last Man Standing match to end the feud. Several weeks after, Edge was then paired with Lita, his real-life girlfriend at the time, in an angle in which she betrayed her storyline husband Kane, by costing him a number-one contender match for the World Heavyweight Championship. Edge faced even more scorn from fans due to this relationship, which lasted over a year. The next week, Edge received his World Heavyweight Championship match against Batista, which he lost. Edge started a feud with Kane leading to several matches between them including one at Vengeance, when Edge lost to Kane.

5|$|From the Tech 32-yard line, Davis {{threw an}} {{incomplete}} pass then connected on a 21-yard pass to Jarvis {{for a first}} down. After an incomplete pass, Davis threw another pass to Jarvis, who caught it at the four-yard line. Facing third down, Davis attempted another pass. The ball was tipped {{into the air and}} caught by Virginia Tech defender Brent Warren. The Hokies resumed running down the clock with short rushes by Evans, who advanced the ball to the 13-yard line with 3:05 remaining in the game. Boston College used its allotted second-half timeouts to stop the clock and preserve time for a late scoring drive. In a strategic move, Tech coach Frank Beamer ordered an intentional safety rather than attempt a punt from the Tech end zone. Any such kick has <b>the</b> <b>potential</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> blocked for a defensive touchdown. Thus, an intentional safety gives the defense two points while denying them the slight chance to score seven. The score cut Virginia Tech's lead to 30–12 with 3:05 remaining, but the limited time remaining meant Tech's lead would be sufficient to win the game without a series of unlikely events.|$|E

Once the season began, Miller's second year salary became fully guaranteed. On December 27, 2013, Miller scored a career-high 9 points against the New Orleans Pelicans. With Wilson Chandler suffering from a groin injury, Miller made his first NBA career start on January 9, 2014 against the Oklahoma City Thunder with Kevin Durant as his defensive assignment. The game was nationally televised. Miller matched his career high with 9 points, while Durant scored 30, but Denver won 10188. In his second start in the following game against Orlando on January 11, Miller achieved his first NBA double double with career highs of 16 points and 11 rebounds. Miller again served in the starting lineup on February 10 but this time in the backcourt when point guard Ty Lawson was injured and starting shooting guard Randy Foye shifted over to replace him. In late March, when Wilson Chandler missed several games, Miller moved into the starting lineup. On April 6, Miller, who was still starting in place of Chandler, scored a career-high 19 points in an overtime contest against Houston.|$|E
