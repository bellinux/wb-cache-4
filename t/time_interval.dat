5|$|The Lancian <b>time</b> <b>{{interval}}</b> was {{the last}} interval before the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event that eliminated non-avian dinosaurs. Edmontosaurus {{was one of the}} more common dinosaurs of the interval. Robert Bakker reports that it made up one-seventh of the large dinosaur sample, with most of the rest (five-sixths) made up of the horned dinosaur Triceratops. The coastal plain Triceratops–Edmontosaurus association, dominated by Triceratops, extended from Colorado to Saskatchewan.|$|E

5|$|By the 1860s {{railways}} in East Anglia were {{in financial}} trouble, and most lines were leased to the ECR. Although the companies wished to amalgamate {{they could not}} obtain government agreement until 1862, when the Great Eastern Railway (GER) was formed. In common with most railways, signalling was fairly basic and trains were separated by <b>time</b> <b>interval.</b> As traffic levels increased {{there was a need}} to improve signalling and in 1869 the GER introduced absolute block working between Fenchurch Street, Gasworks Junction and Bow Junction, opening signal boxes at all locations.|$|E

5|$|In low-duty cycle echolocation, bats can {{separate}} their calls and returning echoes by time. They have to time their short calls to finish before echoes return. This {{is important because}} these bats contract their middle ear muscles when emitting a call, so they can avoid deafening themselves. The <b>time</b> <b>interval</b> between the call and echo allows them to relax these muscles, so they can clearly hear the returning echo. The delay of the returning echoes provides the bat {{with the ability to}} estimate the range to their prey.|$|E
5|$|In 1996, Dodson raised two {{objections}} to Horner's hypothesis. Firstly, {{the possession of}} just one pair of main spikes seemed more basal than the presence of three pairs, as with Styracosaurus albertensis. This suggested {{to him that the}} Einiosaurus-Achelousaurus lineage was a separate branch within the Centrosaurinae. Secondly, he was concerned that Einiosaurus and Achelousaurus were a case of sexual dimorphism, one type being the males, the other the females. This would be suggested by the short geological <b>time</b> <b>interval</b> between the layers their fossils had been found in, which was estimated by him at about 250,000 years. But if the hypothesis were true, it would be perhaps the best example of fast evolution in the Dinosauria.|$|E
5|$|Kulintang {{belongs to}} the larger unit/stratum of “knobbed gong-chime culture” {{prevalent}} in Southeast Asia. It {{is considered one of}} the region’s three major gong ensembles, alongside the gamelan of western Indonesia and piphat of Thailand, Burma, Cambodia and Laos, which use gongs and not wind or string instruments to carry the melodic part of the ensemble. Like the other two, kulintang music is primarily orchestral with several rhythmic parts orderly stacked one upon another. It is also based upon the pentatonic scale. However, kulintang music differs in many aspects from gamelan music, primarily in the way the latter constructs melodies within a framework of skeletal tones and prescribed <b>time</b> <b>interval</b> of entry for each instruments. The framework of kulintang music is more flexible and time intervals are nonexistent, allowing for such things as improvisations to be more prevalent.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{capability}} {{of an individual}} to produce force rapidly is important for performance of sporting activities and to stabilize a joint to protect against injury. Rate of torque development (RTD) and contractile impulse (CI) {{may be more effective}} than peak torque in assessing rapid torque production. The relationship between RTD and CI at different <b>time</b> <b>intervals</b> is unknown. Methods: Forty-seven individuals completed isometric strength testing for knee extension, hip extension, and plantarflexion. Pearson product-moment correlation coefficients were calculated between RTD and CI for each of the following time intervals: 0 - 25, 0 - 50, 0 - 100, 0150, 0 - 200, 0 - 250, and 0 - 300 ms. Results: There was a strong relationship between RTD and CI for all <b>time</b> <b>intervals</b> for the knee extensors and plantar flexors. There was a strong relationship between RTD and CI for the hip extensors for <b>time</b> <b>intervals</b> up to 0 - 200 ms and a moderate relationship for <b>time</b> <b>intervals</b> 0 - 250 and 0 - 300 ms. Conclusion: RTD and CI may be equally effective in characterizing explosive force production in the knee extensors and plantar flexors for all <b>time</b> <b>intervals</b> and in the hip extensors for earlier <b>time</b> <b>intervals.</b> CI may be more effective for the later <b>time</b> <b>intervals</b> for the hip extensors...|$|R

5|$|Semaphore signals {{were used}} on the very first railway lines, but only a bare minimum were {{provided}} as the <b>time</b> <b>interval</b> system being relied upon instead. The first interlocking of signals to protect trains was provided in 1874, as before this time conflicting moves could be made. The design of the signals also progressed, with the disc type siding signals first introduced in 1885, and the lower quadrant somersault type main line signals adopted in 1887, {{both of which are}} still in use today. Green was not adopted as the All Right colour until 1898, with white being used before this time. Red was the usual colour of all signal arms, until yellow was chosen as the colour for distant signals in 1926, with full adoption made in 1930. Colour light signals first appeared in 1918, and by 1924 they were the standard for new installations.|$|E
5|$|The crested newts are {{believed}} to have originated in the Balkans and radiated in a brief <b>time</b> <b>interval</b> between 11.5 and 8 mya: First, the Balkan–Asian group (the Anatolian, Balkan and southern crested newt) branched off from the other crested newts, probably in a vicariance event caused by the separation of the Balkan and Anatolian land masses. The origin of current-day species is not fully understood so far, but one hypothesis suggests that ecological differences, notably in the adaptation to an aquatic lifestyle, may have evolved between populations and led to parapatric speciation. Alternatively, the complex geological history of the Balkan peninsula may have further separated populations there, with subsequent allopatric speciation and the spread of species into their current ranges.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} mining {{temporal}} association rules from temporal dataset {{is to find}} association between items that hold within certain <b>time</b> <b>intervals</b> but not throughout the dataset.

5|$|The safeworking of trains between {{stations}} on {{the early}} lines was <b>time</b> <b>interval</b> working, where a train {{would be allowed to}} leave a given time after the train before it. With heavier traffic this method became unsafe, with Staff and Ticket working on single lines adopted from 1873, and telegraph block working from 1878 on double lines. Both of these systems ensured that only one train would be in a section of track at one time. Telegraphic block working was then replaced with Winters Block working between 1883 and 1888, a system that is a predecessor of the Double line Block system which is still used today. Later years saw variations made to the Staff and Ticket system, with busier lines provided with Electric Staff working which provided greater safely when more trains ran.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} about {{detecting}} and segmenting interrelated events which occur in challenging videos with motion blur, occlusions, dynamic backgrounds, and missing observations. We argue that holistic reasoning about <b>time</b> <b>intervals</b> of events, and their temporal constraints {{is critical in}} such domains to overcome the noise inherent to low-level video representations. For this purpose, our first contribution is the formulation of probabilistic event logic (PEL) for representing temporal constraints among events. A PEL knowledge base consists of confidence-weighted formulas from a temporal event logic, and specifies a joint distribution over the occurrence <b>time</b> <b>intervals</b> of all events. Our second contribution is a MAP inference algorithm for PEL that addresses the scalability issue of reasoning about {{an enormous number of}} <b>time</b> <b>intervals</b> and their constraints in a typical video. Specifically, our algorithm leverages the spanning-interval data structure for compactly representing and manipulating entire sets of <b>time</b> <b>intervals</b> without enumerating them.
