5|$|The {{interior}} room, {{like the}} exterior, is oriented east-west. The most prominent decorative element inside is the hand graining detail {{on the wood}} surfaces. An elevated gallery lines the north wall facing <b>the</b> <b>pews</b> which are bisected by 3½ ft (1.1 m) tall, 5 in (13cm) wide beaded board partition. <b>The</b> <b>pews,</b> partition, door, and window trim are all hand grained. The interior walls are covered with 6 in (15cm) pine wainscotting. The original iron stoves have been replaced with oil-burning stoves, set into the original flues.|$|E
5|$|The nave, {{which is}} aisleless, was {{formerly}} known as the Capel Hir (Long Chapel). <b>The</b> <b>pews</b> in the nave are by Seddon and are of pitch pine with pegged tenon joints. The stonework is almost all nineteenth century to the nave south wall, less so elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|The stalls and pews in the crossing, by Seddon, {{are similar}} to <b>the</b> <b>pews</b> in the nave (being of pitch pine with pegged tenon joints) but are more ornate, with open-arcaded front kneelers and two reading desks with triple pointed arches to the fronts and {{scrolled}} tops to the uprights.|$|E

5|$|Plans {{for the new}} chapel {{were drawn}} up by J.H.Perkins, a local school master, with seating for 2,500. In 1859 a {{colonnade}} {{was added to the}} front of the chapel, with a window and cornice above. This was designed by Staffordshire architect Robert Scrivener. Further alterations were made in 1887, including the extension of the minister's vestry, replacement of the windows and renewal and restoration of <b>the</b> <b>pews.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>pews</b> and the {{elevated}} pulpit {{date from the}} 19th century. The church has some marble memorials on the walls, dating from the 18th century, and a 15th-century octagonal font. A 1937 survey by the Royal Commission on Ancient and Historical Monuments in Wales and Monmouthshire noted a bier from 1746, an oak communion table from about 1700, and an inscribed Elizabethan silver cup. Paraffin lamps are used to light the church, {{since there is no}} electricity connection.|$|E
5|$|There are stone benches {{along the}} north and south walls of the nave. Many of <b>the</b> <b>pews,</b> which dated from the 18th century, were vandalised or stolen after the church was made redundant. Replacements were made by a local {{craftsman}} as part of the restoration project carried out in 1999 and 2000 by the Friends of Friendless Churches.|$|E

5|$|The bronze lectern {{was given}} to the College in 1654. The black and white marble paving dates from 1677–78. Except for <b>the</b> <b>pews</b> on the west, dating from 1884, the panelling, stalls and screens are all 17th-century, as are the altar and carved communion rails. Behind the altar is Bernard van Orley's The Carrying of the Cross — a companion-piece to this {{painting}} is in the National Gallery of Scotland. The organ case dates from 1716; originally designed by Christopher Schreider for St Mary Abbots Church, Kensington, it was acquired by Oriel in 1884.|$|E
5|$|The pulpit {{has some}} 19th-century oak {{panelling}} and reuses some ornate 17th-century panel {{work that is}} decorated with pictures of cherubs, dragons, dogs and lions' heads. <b>The</b> <b>pews</b> are made of pine; the choir stalls also have some carved oak panels that may date from the 17th century. A reading desk from the 19th century reuses material from the 14th and 17th centuries, depicting a lion, a griffin and angels. The church also has an eight-sided sandstone font decorated with a carved cross.|$|E
5|$|In April 1883, Baith Israel, Beth Elohim, and Temple Israel, Brooklyn's three leading synagogues, {{attempted}} an amalgamation.

Mosche and the rabbi of Temple Israel were to split the offices of rabbi and cantor: Baith Israel, at the time, had no rabbi.

5|$|In April 1883, Baith Israel, Beth Elohim, and Temple Israel, Brooklyn's three leading synagogues, {{tried to}} merge; Beth Elohim and Temple Israel had both been {{formed in the}} 1860s by dissenters from Baith Israel. This was the third such attempt; the {{previous}} two had failed when the members could not agree on synagogue ritual. The combined congregation, which would purchase new premises, would have 150 members (only heads of households were considered members at that time). Members would be refunded half the purchase price of <b>the</b> <b>pews</b> in their existing buildings.

5|$|Around 1670, {{the church}} was refurbished, a gallery was built at {{the western end of}} the nave, and the carved reredos and a large wooden Royal coat of arms, now at the west end of the nave, were {{acquired}} at the same time. An inspection report {{at the end of the}} 18th century commented on the dirty transept walls, and the need to install the equivalent of a cattle grid to keep pigs out of the churchyard. Rich crimson hangings in the church had earlier attracted the attention of a thief. The increasing congregation led to the replacement of <b>the</b> <b>pews</b> and the construction of galleries down both sides of the building in 1829, but a more extensive rebuilding was undertaken in 1878–80, by James Piers St Aubyn. The galleries were removed and the two outer aisles were added during this period, a chapel was converted to a vestry and improvements were made to the Hastings Chapel. The cost of these works has been estimated as between £16,000 and more than £18,000. Later developments included the expenditure of £13,000 between 1963 and 1968 to combat deathwatch beetles found during rewiring, improvements to the heating system, and a rededication in 1974, the quincentenary of the church.|$|E
5|$|No major {{alterations}} {{have been}} made since the Reformation in the 1530s and 1540s, {{but there have been}} many changes to the interior to accommodate various phases of Church of England worship. Among these are an oven used for baking communion bread in the south east corner of the north chapel. During the Civil War, considerable damage was done including the destruction of nearly all of the medieval stained glass. William III of England worshipped in the church following his landing in the Glorious Revolution of 1689. By the early 19th century, all the medieval furnishings, except the Norman font had disappeared. New pews were made and the west galleries were added in 1808-11. The latest restoration that has left the church interior visible today, took place in the late 19th century; it was more sympathetic to the church's architectural character than many Victorian restorations. At this time, the central section of the west gallery was removed to reveal the great west window and the organ was relocated to the south transept. <b>The</b> <b>pews</b> date from around 1900 and have attractive carved bench-ends. The church has been designated by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building.|$|E

The altar was moved closer to <b>the</b> <b>pews</b> and placed on a raised concrete platform, and the baptismal font moved to the rear of the church. <b>The</b> <b>pews</b> themselves were widened and their backs reclined further to make them more comfortable to sit in.|$|E
