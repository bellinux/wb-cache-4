5|$|The poem, {{written in}} free verse in 206 lines, uses {{many of the}} {{literary}} techniques associated with <b>the</b> <b>pastoral</b> elegy. It {{was written in the}} summer of 1865 during a period of profound national mourning {{in the aftermath of the}} assassination of President Abraham Lincoln on April 14, 1865. Despite the poem being an elegy to the fallen president, Whitman neither mentions Lincoln by name nor discusses the circumstances of his death. Instead, Whitman uses a series of rural and natural imagery including the symbols of the lilacs, a drooping star in the western sky (Venus), and the hermit thrush, and employs the traditional progression of <b>the</b> <b>pastoral</b> elegy in moving from grief toward an acceptance and knowledge of death. The poem also addresses the pity of war through imagery vaguely referencing the American Civil War (1861–1865) which ended only days before the assassination.|$|E

5|$|A villanelle (also {{known as}} villanesque) is a nineteen-line poetic form {{consisting}} of five tercets {{followed by a}} quatrain. There are two refrains and two repeating rhymes, with {{the first and third}} line of the first tercet repeated alternately until the last stanza, which includes both repeated lines. The villanelle {{is an example of a}} fixed verse form. The word derives from Latin, then Italian, and is related to the initial subject of the form being <b>the</b> <b>pastoral.</b>|$|E
5|$|Ann Eliza Bleecker's {{pastoral}} poems exemplified a {{new style}} of American poetry, and, due to her experience of the American Revolutionary tumult, {{a new sense of}} national identity. These poems, written in <b>the</b> <b>pastoral</b> tradition, conveyed both the beauty of the colonial New York countryside and the horrific impact of war, suffering, death, and destruction. Because Bleecker was writing from the interesting perspective of a terrified young mother, her articulate depictions of the Revolutionary War are still read by historians today.|$|E

West Semitic names started to be attested in Mari since the second kingdom era, and by the middle Bronze-Age, the west Semitic Amorite tribes became the majority of <b>the</b> <b>pastoral</b> groups in the middle Euphrates and Khabur valleys. Amorite names started to be observed in the city {{toward the end of the}} Shakkanakku period, even among the ruling dynasty members.|$|E
6000|$|One {{characteristic}} of <b>the</b> <b>Pastorals</b> has been universally allowed--the peculiar softness of the versification, which was considered by Pope {{to be an}} essential quality of this species of composition. He told Spence that he had scarce ever bestowed more labour in tuning his lines.[15] He must have had less facility when he was learning the art than when he was thoroughly practised in it; and since authors are apt to estimate the result {{by the amount of}} toil it has cost them, the greater pains he expended upon his early efforts may have been the reason that [...] "he esteemed <b>the</b> <b>Pastorals</b> as <b>the</b> most correct in the versification, and musical in the numbers, of all his works." [...] He certainly went forwards in some of his later pieces. Windsor Forest, and the Epistle of Eloisa to Abelard, are finer specimens of melody than <b>the</b> <b>Pastorals.</b> <b>The</b> poetic harmony displayed by Pope in his youth refuted an axiom which Dryden propounded in his lines to the memory of Oldham.|$|R

The centre of his capital city consisted of mostly farmland, with small settlements—mostly wooden, temporary and ad hoc—on either side.

By 1944, the church which they had envisioned after their meeting with Gandhi became a reality when they, along with Fisk, opened the Church for the Fellowship of All Peoples. It was the first interracial, non-denominational church in the United States.

5|$|In his {{published}} score Monteverdi lists around 41 {{instruments to}} be deployed, with distinct groups of instruments used to depict particular scenes and characters. Thus strings, harpsichords and recorders represent <b>the</b> <b>pastoral</b> fields of Thrace with their nymphs and shepherds, while heavy brass illustrates the underworld and its denizens. Composed {{at the point}} of transition from the Renaissance era to the Baroque, L'Orfeo employs all the resources then known within the art of music, with particularly daring use of polyphony. The work is not orchestrated as such; in the Renaissance tradition instrumentalists followed the composer's general instructions but were given considerable freedom to improvise.|$|E
5|$|Instrumentally, the {{two worlds}} {{represented}} within the opera are distinctively portrayed. <b>The</b> <b>pastoral</b> world of the fields of Thrace {{is represented by the}} strings, harpsichords, harp, organs, recorders and chitarroni. The remaining instruments, mainly brass, are associated with the Underworld, though there is not an absolute distinction; strings appear on several occasions in the Hades scenes. Within this general ordering, specific instruments or combinations are used to accompany some of the main characters—Orpheus by harp and organ, shepherds by harpsichord and chitarrone, the Underworld gods by trombones and regal. All of these musical distinctions and characterisations were in accordance with the longstanding traditions of the Renaissance orchestra, of which the large L'Orfeo ensemble is typical.|$|E
5|$|The Anglo-Saxons {{produced}} extensive {{poetry in}} Old English, {{some of which}} was written down {{as early as the}} 9th century, although most surviving poems were compiled in the 10th and early 11th century.

Old English was also used for academic and courtly writing from the 9th century onwards, including translations of popular foreign works, including <b>The</b> <b>Pastoral</b> Care.|$|E

5|$|The Arabization of the Ayyubid ruling {{families}} differed starkly {{from the}} ranks of their armies, which lacked cultural cohesion, with Turks and Kurds dominating the cavalry and nomadic Turcomans and Arabs filling the ranks of the infantry. These groups typically settled in <b>the</b> <b>pastoral</b> areas outside of the cities, the centers of cultural life, and as such they were relatively isolated from the Arabic-dominant urban environment. This isolation allowed them to preserve their traditions. It is thought that Saladin spoke Turkish to his military commanders. Like their Fatimid predecessors, the Ayyubid rulers of Egypt maintained a substantial force of mamluks (military slaves). By {{the first half of the}} 13th century mamluks were mostly drawn from Kipchak Turks and Circassians and there is strong evidence that these forces continued to speak Kipchak Turkish.|$|E

5|$|From {{the late}} seventeenth music became less an {{accomplishment}} of the gentle classes and increasingly a skill pursued by professionals. It was enjoyed in otherwise silent concert rooms {{rather than as}} incidental entertainment in the houses of royalty and nobles. The German flute was probably introduced into Scotland {{towards the end of}} the seventeenth century. The Italian style of classical music was probably first brought to Scotland by the Italian cellist and composer Lorenzo Bocchi, who travelled to Scotland in the 1720s, introducing the cello to the country and then developing settings for Lowland Scots songs. He possibly had a hand in the first Scottish Opera, <b>the</b> <b>pastoral</b> The Gentle Shepherd, with libretto by Allan Ramsay. Music in Edinburgh prospered through the patronage of figures including the merchant Sir John Clerk of Penicuik, who was also a noted composer, violinist and harpiscordist. The growth of a musical culture in the capital was marked by the incorporation of the Musical Society of Edinburgh in 1728.|$|E
