5|$|Charles himself took a main column {{along the}} high road, a {{causeway}} that passed by Saulgau, to attack Lefebvre on points between Hoßkirch and Ostrach. In this deployment of his force, Charles sought <b>to</b> <b>dislodge</b> {{the center of}} the French line from its position in Ostrach, separating the wings from the main body of force and overcoming both separately.|$|E
5|$|Flocks {{of birds}} appear {{to engage in}} play; one routine {{involves}} a bird perching atop a tall tree, pole or spire, and others swooping, tumbling or diving and attempting <b>to</b> <b>dislodge</b> it. A successful challenger is then challenged in its turn by other birds in the flock.|$|E

5|$|After Taft and Leale opened Lincoln's {{shirt and}} found no stab wound, Leale located the gunshot wound behind the left ear. He found the bullet too deep to be removed, but was able <b>to</b> <b>dislodge</b> a clot, after which Lincoln's {{breathing}} improved; he learned that regularly removing new clots maintained Lincoln's breathing. As actress Laura Keene cradled the President's head in her lap, he pronounced the wound mortal.|$|E
5|$|Corals are {{collected}} for the aquarium trade, {{and this may}} be done with little care for the long-term survival of the reef. Fishing among reefs is difficult and trawling does much mechanical damage. In {{some parts of the world}} explosives are used <b>to</b> <b>dislodge</b> fish from reefs, and cyanide may be used for the same purpose; both practices not only kill reef inhabitants indiscriminately but also kill or damage the corals, sometimes stressing them so much that they expel their zooxanthellae and become bleached.|$|E
5|$|From 5000 to 2000 BC, Bandkeramik {{cultures}} predominated. In addition, remains {{from the}} Dnieper-Donets culture {{were found in}} Belarus and parts of Ukraine. Cimmerians and other pastoralists roamed through the area by 1,000 BC, and by 500 AD, Slavs had taken up residence, which was circumscribed by the Scythians who roamed its outskirts. Invaders from Asia, among whom were the Huns and Avars, swept through c. 400–600 AD, but were unable <b>to</b> <b>dislodge</b> the Slavic presence.|$|E
25|$|Fernández de La Cueva {{repaired}} {{and expanded}} the armada of Barlovento (coast guard) {{so that it}} could attack pirates. He devoted much of the armed forces <b>to</b> <b>dislodging</b> the English and Dutch from the coast of the Seno Mexicano (Gulf coast). He sent reinforcements and supplies to Saint Augustine, Florida, which was besieged by the English. He confiscated the property of the English and Dutch, and used the proceeds to fend off their incursions. He worked to protect the newly established Jesuit missions in California.|$|R

50|$|Harper {{came close}} <b>to</b> <b>dislodging</b> Given on {{numerous}} occasions, {{most notably in}} the 1998-99 season. Harper played in the 1999 FA Cup Final, when Newcastle lost 2-0 to Manchester United. Then-manager Ruud Gullit appeared to see Harper worthy of playing over Given. However, {{at the start of}} the 1999-2000 season, Gullit resigned and Harper again became second choice goalkeeper, although he did enjoy another brief period of first team action for part of the season when Given was injured. When Given returned from injury, Harper was once again used as the back-up goalkeeper.|$|R
5|$|His {{opportunity}} came on 16 September 1915, when he {{was accepted}} by the Russian Army as a volunteer. He {{was assigned to the}} 116th Reserve Battalion and sent to Akhaltsikhe for basic training. With his training complete in December, he joined the 2nd Caucasus Frontier Regiment of the Russian Expeditionary Corps, which was sent <b>to</b> <b>dislodge</b> the Ottoman Turks in Persia. Bagramyan participated in several battles in Asadabad, Hamedan and Kermanshah, the Russian victories here sending Ottoman forces reeling toward Anatolia.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), a major {{national}} political party, forged an electoral {{alliance with the}} Shiv Sena <b>to</b> <b>dislodge</b> the Congress in the Maharashtra Legislative Assembly elections. In 1999, several members left the Congress to form the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP) but later allied with the Congress {{as part of an}} alliance known as the Democratic Front. Currently, other parties such as Maharashtra Navnirman Sena (MNS), Samajwadi Party (SP), Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP), and several independent candidates also contest elections in the city.|$|E

Psychological warfare {{was used in}} an attempt <b>to</b> <b>dislodge</b> him, including blaring rock music, and turning a nearby field into a helicopter landing zone. After ten days of Operation Nifty Package, Noriega surrendered on January 3, 1990. He was detained as a prisoner of war, and later taken to the United States.|$|E
5|$|The Germans soon intervened {{to assist}} Italy. Hitler sent German forces to Libya in February, {{and by the}} end of March the Axis had {{launched}} an offensive which drove back the Commonwealth forces which had been weakened to support Greece. In under a month, Commonwealth forces were pushed back into Egypt with the exception of the besieged port of Tobruk that fell later. The Commonwealth attempted <b>to</b> <b>dislodge</b> Axis forces in May and again in June, but failed on both occasions.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure of}} the siege marked the {{beginning}} of Muhammad's undoubted political ascendancy in the city of Medina. The Meccans had exerted their utmost strength <b>to</b> <b>dislodge</b> Muhammad from Medina, and this defeat caused them to lose their trade with Syria and much of their prestige with it. Watt conjectures that the Meccans at this point began to contemplate that conversion to Islam would be the most prudent option.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the earthquake, {{multiple}} phone lines were down, and scattered power outages affected about 54,000 households. Moreover, at least 70 underground 11,000 volt cables sustained some degree of damage, contributing to the outages. The shaking ruptured local water mains, resulting in widespread flooding that affected several streets. Furthermore, officials ordered the closure of bridges in the area as a precautionary measure; one bridge was reported to have succumbed to the strong ground motions. Days after its occurrence, a small electrical fire ignited in a control panel at Christchurch Hospital due <b>to</b> <b>dislodged</b> wiring as a result of ongoing aftershocks.|$|R

Fred Speller attempted a comeback, appearing twice for the first team in September 1893, but the injury received against Darwen effectively proved the end of his football career.|$|E
5|$|After a {{hard but}} {{inconclusive}} fight during which Admiral Brézé was killed, the French fleet withdrew to Toulon leaving {{the sea to}} the Spanish, who decided not to pursue them to relieve Orbetello. The land forces disembarked by Count of Linhares a few days later, however, failed <b>to</b> <b>dislodge</b> the French lines, and the siege could be undertaken until 24 July, when another Spanish army led by the Marquis of Torrecuso and the Duke of Arcos, which {{had come from the}} Kingdom of Naples across the Papal States, defeated the besieging French troops, forcing them to retreat with heavy losses.|$|E
5|$|Commodore Hopkins {{came under}} {{scrutiny}} from Congress over matters unrelated to this action. He had violated his written orders by sailing to Nassau instead of Virginia and the Carolinas, {{and he had}} distributed the goods taken during the cruise to Connecticut and Rhode Island without consulting Congress. He was censured for these transgressions, and dismissed from the Navy in January 1778 after further controversies, including the fleet's failure to sail agayn (a number of its ships suffered from crew shortages, and also became trapped at Providence by the British occupation of Newport late in 1776). American forces were not strong enough <b>to</b> <b>dislodge</b> the British garrison there, which was also supported by British ships using Newport as a base.|$|E

5|$|In early 1863, Major General James Longstreet {{was given}} {{command of the}} Confederate Department of North Carolina and Southern Virginia. His {{objectives}} were to defend Richmond from attack from the southeast, forage for supplies in Union controlled southeastern Virginia and <b>to</b> <b>dislodge</b> the Union garrison at Suffolk. Longstreet began the Siege of Suffolk on April 11, 1863. The 6th Massachusetts occupied {{a position on the}} right of the Union defensive siege lines at a location called Fort Nansemond by the bank of the Nansemond River. For 22 days, the regiment engaged in frequent exchanges of fire with opposing forces though no significant assault was made by the Confederates.|$|E
5|$|In the 1974 federal election, it {{succeeded in}} having Hall {{elected to the}} Australian Senate with a primary vote of 10 per cent in South Australia. It built upon this in the 1975 state election, gaining almost {{a fifth of the}} total vote and an {{additional}} member. However, the non-Labor parties narrowly failed <b>to</b> <b>dislodge</b> the incumbent Dunstan Labor government. That result, together with internal weaknesses, led in 1976 to the LM's being re-absorbed into the LCL, which by then had become the South Australian Division of the Liberal Party of Australia. The non-Labor forces again failed at the 1977 state election but succeeded in winning government for one term at the 1979 state election.|$|E
5|$|In the {{resulting}} battle, both sides lost numerous warships in two extremely destructive surface engagements at night. Nevertheless, the U.S. succeeded in turning back {{attempts by the}} Japanese to bombard Henderson Field with battleships. Allied aircraft also sank most of the Japanese troop transports and prevented {{the majority of the}} Japanese troops and equipment from reaching Guadalcanal. Thus, the battle turned back Japan's last major attempt <b>to</b> <b>dislodge</b> Allied forces from Guadalcanal and nearby Tulagi, resulting in a strategic victory for the U.S. and its allies and deciding the ultimate outcome of the Guadalcanal campaign in their favor.|$|E

40|$|Westinghouse Hanford Corporation {{has been}} {{pursuing}} strategies {{to break up}} and retrieve the radioactive waste material in single shell storage tanks at the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, by working with non-radioactive ``saltcake`` and sludge material that simulate the actual waste.

Additionally, the application of these higher volumes of water might successfully be applied through commercially available tooling using methods similar to those used in the deslagging of large utility boilers. NMW Industrial Services, Inc., has proposed a trial consisting of three approaches each <b>to</b> <b>dislodging</b> both the solid (saltcake) simulant and the sludge simulant...|$|R
