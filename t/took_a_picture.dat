5|$|The 1999 {{collapse}} of Bonfire was witnessed {{by thousands of}} people around the world. The Texas A Department of Computer Science set up a camera aimed at the Bonfire site that <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> every 10minutes and posted it on the Internet. On the day of the collapse over 29,000 visitors visited the web page, at a time when only 20 million people worldwide had Internet access.|$|E
5|$|Adrienne's head {{is split}} open by a {{swinging}} pendulum blade in one death scene, an effect that took several hours to set up. A fake head was created from a model cast of actress Victoria Morsell's head, with pumps installed to pump fake blood into it, and strings attached {{to either side}} {{so it could be}} pulled apart. The crew only had one head model, so they had to keep putting it back together and reusing it over and over for each take. After filming was completed, the crew put the head back together and <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of Morsell with it.|$|E
5|$|During the 1993 {{run for the}} {{national}} title, Smith used a method that was introduced to him {{at a conference in}} Switzerland. At the conference, Smith was presented a tape by a lecturer who used doctored images to achieve his goal of losing weight. The photos showed the lecturer what he would look like if he were thinner as motivation to reach his weight-loss goals. Smith <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of the scoreboard from the 1982 Championship, modified it to read 1993 and erased the name Georgetown, leaving that space blank. He proceeded to place copies of the doctored photo in all of the players' lockers.|$|E

5000|$|A {{separate}} but often related distinction is between [...] and release priority - whether the camera will <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> {{when the subject}} is out of focus or not. In focus priority, the camera will only <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> when the subject is in focus (as detected by the AF system), while in release priority, the camera will <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> whenever the shutter is pressed. Release priority is particularly used of fast-moving subjects, {{which may not be}} perfectly in focus, or by experienced photographers, who wish to override the camera's judgment of whether the scene is in focus.|$|R

Her photographs include different views of native villages, urban areas, and the Egyptian pyramids, among other subjects.

5|$|Hepburn {{was known}} for being {{fiercely}} private, and would not give interviews or talk to fans for much of her career. She distanced herself from the celebrity lifestyle, uninterested in a social scene she saw as tedious and superficial, and she wore casual clothes that went strongly against convention {{in an era of}} glamour. She rarely appeared in public, even avoiding restaurants, and once wrestled a camera out of a photographer's hand when he <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> without asking. Despite her zeal for privacy, she enjoyed her fame, and later confessed that she would not have liked the press to ignore her completely. The protective attitude thawed as she aged; beginning with a two-hour-long interview on The Dick Cavett Show in 1973, Hepburn became increasingly open with the public.|$|E
5|$|Mansfield's {{publicity}} antics {{are another}} recurring theme in popular culture. On the season 32 episode of Saturday Night Live hosted by Alec Baldwin (with musical guest Christina Aguilera), {{one of the}} commercial bumpers has Alec Baldwin PhotoShopped into the famous picture of Sophia Loren staring at Mansfield's chest at Romanoff's in Beverly Hills. It was a direct reference to publicity stunt of Mansfield in April 1957 intended to deflect attention from Loren during a dinner party in the Italian star's honor. Photographs of the encounter were published around the world. The most famous image showed Loren raising a contemptuous eyebrow at the American actress who, sitting between Loren and her dinner companion, Clifton Webb, had leaned over the table, allowing her breasts to spill over her low neckline and exposing one nipple. The photo of Sophia Loren sitting next to Jayne Mansfield and regarding her cleavage inspired other photographers too. In 1993, Daniela Federici created an homage with Anna Nicole Smith as Mansfield and New York City DJ Sky Nellor as Loren for a Guess Jeans campaign. Later, Mark Seliger <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> named Heidi Klum at Romanoff's with Heidi Klum in a reproduction of the restaurant set. The meeting between Mansfield and Anton LaVey, the founder and high priest of the Church of Satan, was a much publicized and oft quoted event of her life, {{as well as the}} history of the Church.|$|E

25|$|Sultana {{spent two}} days {{traveling}} upriver, fighting {{against one of the}} worst spring floods in the river's history. At some places, the river overflowed the banks and spread out three miles wide. Trees along the river bank were almost completely covered, until only the very tops of the trees were visible above the swirling, powerful water. On April 26, Sultana stopped at Helena, Arkansas, where photographer T.W. Bankes <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of the grossly overcrowded vessel. Near 7:00 P.M., Sultana reached Memphis, Tennessee, and the crew began unloading 120 tons of sugar from the hold. Near midnight, Sultana left Memphis, went a short distance upriver to take on a new load of coal and then started north again.|$|E
25|$|As a result, Interpol, the {{international}} law enforcement agency, issued a light blue notice against Modi {{to be arrested}} on Indian soil.

In the post, he referred to Noble as his “brother”. The incident caused significant media backlash within India as many began to {{raise questions about the}} connection between men with criminal reputations like Modi and international law enforcement. Yet Noble, who served as the head of Interpol from 2000 to 2014, denied any knowledge of Modi's criminal activities despite evidence that Modi was on an Interpol watch list for some time.|$|E

A photographer <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of a document Dehaene had {{with him when he}} arrived at the palace. The document reportedly stated that the state reform should not be an issue during the formation whereas the issue of Brussels-Halle-Vilvoorde should be included in a coalition agreement, and that all elections (federal, regional and European) should coincide in 2009. On Tuesday August 28, King Albert received Willy Claes (SP.A), Gérard Deprez (MR), Jos Geysels (Groen!), Philippe Busquin (PS), Charles-Ferdinand Nothomb (Humanist Democratic Centre) and José Daras (Ecolo). The following day, the King received three more ministers of State: Raymond Langendries (Humanist Democratic Centre), Herman De Croo (Open VLD) and Louis Michel (MR).|$|E

French-Canadian journalist William Reymond received {{a copy of the}} photograph via the Internet, anonymously, apparently a copy of a tweet originating from the Ottawa Police of the cellphone picture.
