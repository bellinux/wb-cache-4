We focus on the <b>top</b> <b>stories</b> identification task, and take an approach that does not require the headlines of <b>top</b> <b>stories</b> to be known beforehand. We explore the feasibility of a so-called blogs to news approach: given a date and a set of blog posts, identify the main topics for that date. This approach is more general than just finding <b>top</b> <b>stories,</b> but it can still be applied to the task of headline ranking. Results show that this general approach, applied to the task at hand, is among the top performing approaches in this year’s TREC. ...|$|R
