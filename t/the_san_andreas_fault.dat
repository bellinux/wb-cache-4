5|$|The Salton Trough {{is part of}} {{the complex}} plate {{boundary}} between the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate where it undergoes a transition from the continental transform of <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> <b>Fault</b> system to the series of short spreading centers of the East Pacific Rise linked by oceanic transforms in the Gulf of California. The two main right–lateral strike-slip fault strands that extend across {{the southern part of the}} trough are the Elsinore Fault Zone/Laguna Salada Fault to the western side of the trough and the Imperial Fault to the east. The Imperial Fault is linked to <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> <b>Fault</b> through the Brawley Seismic Zone, which is a spreading center beneath the southern end of the Salton Sea.|$|E
5|$|The Bay Area is {{well known}} for the {{complexity}} of its landforms that are the result of millions of years by the forces of plate tectonics, since the region is located {{in the middle of a}} meeting point between two plates. Nine out of eleven distinct assemblages have been identified in a single county, Alameda. Diverse assemblages adjoin in complex arrangements due to offsets along the many faults (both active and stable) in the area. As a consequence, many types of rock and soil are found in the region. The oldest rocks are metamorphic rocks that are associated with granite in the Salinian Block west of <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> <b>fault.</b> These were formed from sedimentary rocks of sandstone, limestone, and shale in uplifted seabeds. Volcanic deposits also exist in the Bay Area, left behind by the movement of <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> <b>fault,</b> whose movement sliced a subduction plate and allowed magma to briefly flow to the surface.|$|E
5|$|To {{the west}} of <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> <b>Fault,</b> the {{southern}} edge of the Transverse Ranges has been in a state of contraction during the Quaternary Period, with active reverse faulting that has uplifted San Gabriel Mountains. The west-striking (and range-bounding) Sierra Madre–Cucamonga Faults, as well as the San Cayetano Fault and Santa Susana Faults all exhibit a component of left-lateral strike-slip motion and share a similar trend.|$|E

5|$|With the San Jacinto Fault Zone to the northwest, the Elsinore fault to the south-southwest, and the Imperial fault {{centered}} {{directly under}} the Imperial Valley, the area frequently encounters seismic activity, including moderate and damaging earthquakes.

5|$|Near Cape Mendocino, the Mendocino Triple Junction {{is an area}} {{of active}} {{seismicity}} where three tectonic plates come together.

5|$|The Mono–Inyo {{chain of}} craters lies in east-central California, roughly {{parallel}} to the eastern escarpment of the Sierra Nevada mountain range. Volcanism and seismic activity in eastern California {{are a result of}} two major geologic processes: northwest movement of the Pacific Plate with respect to the North American Plate along <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> <b>Fault</b> system near the coast, and east–west extension of the crust that formed the Basin and Range Province. In the Long Valley region, where the craters are located, basin and range extension encroaches onto the thick and stable crust of the Sierra Nevada.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> <b>Fault</b> has offset Indian stone rings, {{its path}} is buried by sediments from Lake Cahuilla. During the Pleistocene, this fault was {{relatively}} inactive {{compared to the}} Imperial Fault and the San Jacinto Fault. Other faults that crossed the shores of Lake Cahuilla are the Extra fault zone, which divides a northern more stable basin from a southern basin that underwent tectonic extension and slightly slower sedimentation, the Coyote Creek Fault (whose movement rate has been estimated from displacement of Lake Cahuilla sediments and probably accelerated {{during the time of}} Cahuilla's highstand), the Superstition Mountain Fault which extends from the Coyote Creek fault, the San Jacinto Fault which runs parallel to part of Cahuilla's western shore, was last active in 820-1280, 1280, 1440-1637 and 1440-1640 and whose fault trace could be buried beneath sediments from Lake Cahuilla, and the Elmore Ranch fault which displays evidence of after-lake activity in the Superstition Hills. Faults on the lake floor include the Brawley Seismic Zone, potentially the Cerro Prieto Fault, the Imperial Fault, and the Kane Springs Faults. The Imperial Fault may have ruptured together with a rupture of <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> <b>Fault</b> during a highstand of Lake Cahuilla, and was last active during the 1940 Imperial Valley earthquake.|$|E
5|$|Tectonics-based {{events will}} {{continue}} to occur well into {{the future and the}} surface will be steadily reshaped by tectonic uplift, extrusions, and erosion. Mount Vesuvius can be expected to erupt about 40 times over the next 1,000 years.

2500|$|Geologically, {{the valley}} of Dzungarian Gate {{was created by the}} active [...] strike-slip Dzungar fault system.

5|$|The lake formed {{several times}} over during the Holocene when water from the Colorado River was {{diverted}} into the Salton Trough. This tectonic depression forms the northern basin of the Gulf of California, but it was separated from the sea proper by {{the growth of the}} Colorado River Delta. Such changes in river courses may have been caused by earthquakes among the numerous faults that cross the region, such as <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> <b>Fault.</b> Conversely, {{it is possible that the}} weight of the water itself triggered earthquakes. During its existence, Lake Cahuilla formed strandlines and various beach deposits such as gravel bars and travertine deposits.|$|E
5|$|Basin and Range-associated {{stretching}} {{of large}} parts of crust below southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico started around 16millionyears ago and the region is still spreading. This stretching began to affect the Death and Panamint valleys area by 3million years ago. Before this, rocks now in the Panamint Range were on top of rocks that would become the Black Mountains and the Cottonwood Mountains. Lateral and vertical transport of these blocks was accomplished by movement on normal faults. Right-lateral movement along strike-slip faults that run parallel to and {{at the base of}} the ranges also helped to develop the area. Torsional forces, probably associated with northwesterly movement of the Pacific Plate along <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> <b>Fault</b> (west of the region), is responsible for the lateral movement.|$|E
5|$|Patterns of seismic {{activity}} detected by paleoseismology {{suggest that the}} filling of Lake Cahuilla might have triggered stress changes that caused earthquakes along <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> <b>Fault</b> and other faults when they were already close to rupture. Such lake-induced seismicity is known from reservoirs and referred to as induced seismicity. Alternatively, earthquakes could have caused course changes in the Colorado River that then caused the lake to flood or to dry up; paleoseismology in Coachella is consistent with this hypothesis. Some earthquakes such as the 1892 Laguna Salada earthquake caused large vertical displacements that could have triggered flooding. Conversely, tectonically driven uplift of the northern side of the Colorado River Delta tends to stabilize the present southward course of the river against diversions to the north.|$|E

5|$|The {{region has}} {{considerable}} vertical relief in its landscapes {{that are not}} in the alluvial plains leading to the bay or in inland valleys. The topography, and geologic history, of the Bay Area can largely be attributed to the compressive forces between the Pacific Plate and the North American plate.

The Santa Cruz Mountains along the San Francisco Peninsula and the Marin Hills in Marin County follow <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> <b>fault,</b> The Berkeley Hills, San Leandro Hills and their southern ridgeline extension through Mission Peak roughly follow the Hayward fault, and the Diablo Range, which includes Mount Diablo and Mount Hamilton and runs along the Calaveras fault.|$|E
5|$|At Lebec, California, {{just south}} of the {{epicenter}} of the July mainshock, <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> <b>Fault</b> comes together with the Garlock Fault, which is positioned at the northern border of the Mojave Desert.

The Kern Canyon Fault mirrors the path of the Kern River, and was thought to have a connection with the White Wolf Fault, but indicators observed following the July 21 earthquake demonstrated that the two are offset. The Owens Valley Fault, {{on the east side of}} the Sierran block, has been mapped and may possibly extend into area that was affected by the 1952 shocks. Other fault zones are present in the region, and have been of interest because they may have been responsible for minor earthquakes, but they are considered not as significant as the Kern Canyon, Owens Valley, and San Andreas Faults.|$|E

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{uncertainties}} in {{estimates of the}} geologic slip rate along the Mission Creek strand of <b>the</b> southern <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> <b>fault</b> where it offsets an alluvial fan (T 2) at Biskra Palms Oasis in southern California. We provide new estimates {{of the amount of}} fault offset of the T 2 fan based on trench excavations and new cosmogenic 10 Be age determinations from the tops of 12 boulders on the fan surface. We present three alternative fan offset models: a minimum, a maximum, and a preferred offset of 660 m, 980 m, and 770 m, respectively. We assign an age of between 45 and 54 ka to the T 2 fan from the 10 Be data, which is significantly older than previously reported but is consistent with both the degree of soil development associated with this surface, and with ages from U-series geochronology on pedogenic carbonate from T 2, described in a companion paper by Fletcher et al. (this volume). These new constraints suggest a range of slip rates between ∼ 12 and 22 mm/yr with a preferred estimate of ∼ 14 – 17 mm/yr for the Mission Creek strand of <b>the</b> southern <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> <b>fault.</b> Previous studies suggested that the geologic and geodetic slip-rate estimates at Biskra Palms differed. We find, however, that considerable uncertainty affects both the geologic and geodetic slip-rate estimates, such that if a real discrepancy between these rates exists for <b>the</b> southern <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> <b>fault</b> at Biskra Palms, it cannot be demonstrated with available data...|$|R

5|$|The northernmost {{coastal area}} {{is one of}} California's most seismically active regions and, in a 50-year period, the area {{including}} the Mendocino Fracture Zone at the southern flank of the Gorda Plate generated about 25 percent of all seismic energy unleashed in the state.

Simultaneously, the Rivera Triple Junction shifted to the southeast to its current position at 23° N.

Well-located low-level seismicity (Md < = 3. 0) has occurred persistently within this block throughout the recording interval (1969 to 1995), {{with the highest}} levels of activity occurring along or directly adjacent to (within- 5 km) the bounding faults and falling off toward the long axis of the bay. The total seismic moment release within the interior of the Bay block since 1969 is equivalent to one ML 3. 8 earthquake, one to two orders of mag-nitude lower than activity along and within 5 km of the bounding faults. Focal depths of reliably located events within the Bay block are generally less than 13 km with most seismicity in the depth range of 7 to 12 km, similar to focal depths along both the adjacent portions of <b>the</b> <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> and Hayward <b>faults.</b> Focal mechanisms for M d 2 to 3 events within the Bay block mimic focal mechanisms along <b>the</b> adjacent <b>San</b> <b>Andreas</b> <b>fault</b> zone and in the East Bay, suggesting that Bay block is respondin...|$|R
