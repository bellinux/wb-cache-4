40|$|In this paper, {{we suggest}} an {{approach}} <b>to</b> <b>recovering</b> behavior-related, preference-choice network information from observational data.

To address the unknown nature of the sampling model in recovering behavior related network information, we use the Cressie-Read (CR) family of divergence measures and the corresponding information theoretic entropy basis, for estimation, inference, model evaluation, and prediction. Examples are included to clarify how entropy based information theoretic methods are directly applicable <b>to</b> <b>recovering</b> the behavioral network probabilities in this fundamentally underdetermined ill posed inverse recovery problem...|$|R
