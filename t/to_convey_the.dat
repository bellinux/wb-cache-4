5|$|At 23:00 on 30 March, with {{a strong}} wind from the south, Guillaume Tell sailed from Valletta, Decrés hoping to use the cover of {{darkness}} to escape the British blockade. Dixon had deployed his ships around the island, with Valletta watched by the frigate HMS Penelope under Captain Henry Blackwood. At 23:55, Blackwood's lookouts spotted Guillaume Tell and the captain gave chase, ordering the brig HMS Minorca under Commander George Miller <b>to</b> <b>convey</b> <b>the</b> message to Dixon, whose ships were just visible in the distance. Blackwood also attempted to signal his discovery to his commanding officer as Penelope gave chase.|$|E

The concept was contributed by Keiji Inafune, who wished <b>to</b> <b>convey</b> <b>the</b> idea of surviving in a world verging on human extinction. The developers first {{came up with the}} robots, whose anatomical design problems would later be solved by the insertion of cores – essentially robot souls – to explain their propulsion. Writer Joseph Staten resolved to create a simple story to enhance an emotional backdrop more grounded in complexity.|$|E
5|$|Flight Unlimited was {{the first}} self-published game {{released}} by Looking Glass Technologies. It was intended to establish the company as a video game publisher and to compete with flight simulator franchises such as Microsoft Flight Simulator. Project leader Seamus Blackley, a particle physicist and amateur pilot, conceived the game in 1992. He felt that other flight simulators failed <b>to</b> <b>convey</b> <b>the</b> experience of real flight, and he reacted by coding a simulated atmosphere for Flight Unlimited based on real-time computational fluid dynamics. Aerobatic pilot Michael Goulian endorsed the game and assisted the team in making it more true to life.|$|E
5|$|McKinley {{initially}} {{appeared to}} be recovering, but took {{a turn for the}} worse on September 13 as his wounds became gangrenous, and died early the next morning; Vice President Theodore Roosevelt succeeded him. Roosevelt was hiking near the top of Mt. Marcy, in New York State's Adirondack region, when a runner located him <b>to</b> <b>convey</b> <b>the</b> bad news. After McKinley's murder, for which Czolgosz was put to death in the electric chair, the United States Congress passed legislation to officially charge the Secret Service with the responsibility for protecting the president.|$|E

Pillars were made to resemble English lampposts, and Western lighting, chairs and tableware were also used. <b>To</b> <b>convey</b> <b>the</b> culture and feel of the time, the buildings were made to look obsolete and worn out. Apart from historical references, Mak also created a glass house which was used in a scene in the film.|$|E

5|$|This {{section was}} named after a song by The Smiths. The motorboat driven by David Beckham arrived with the Olympic Flame via the Limehouse Cut and the Lee Navigation. Steve Redgrave lit his torch from that on the boat, and carried it into the stadium through an honour guard of 500 of the {{construction}} workers who had built the Olympic Park. He passed the flame on to a team of seven young people, each nominated by a famous British Olympian <b>to</b> <b>convey</b> <b>the</b> Games' aim to 'inspire a generation'. Six of the team were athletes, and the seventh was a volunteer young ambassador.|$|E
5|$|After the service, some people—regular {{faithful}} or visitors—may ask {{to consult}} a healer {{in one of}} the small rooms of the temple—although the desservant who lives in the apartment adjacent to the temple is always available to receive suffering persons. During these consultations, both are standing before Antoine's image: the patient expresses for a few minutes the request that he wishes to obtain, and the healer prays, sometimes while touching the consultant's shoulder or hand, presumably <b>to</b> <b>convey</b> <b>the</b> fluid. The healer's work is said to put again the consultant in the love of God that will allow him to find himself the spiritual journey leading to healing. For this purpose, the healer has to discover the origin of the consultant's problem, which is, in Antoinist beliefs, always linked to a person's own history, and to understand that he should bear the consequences of what was done in a preceding life.|$|E
5|$|Although Buffy and {{her friends}} deal with death every week, often in very gruesome and fantastic ways, in this episode they are bewildered by the natural death of Joyce Summers, the {{divorced}} mother of Buffy and her sister Dawn and occasionally a mother figure to their friends. They struggle to comprehend what the loss means {{to each of them}} and to the group. Buffy must begin to face her life and her duties as the Slayer without parental support and comfort. The episode was stripped of all music—a regular staple of the Buffy series—and disorienting effects were included <b>to</b> <b>convey</b> <b>the</b> sense of displacement and loss associated with the death of a close family member.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from the}} {{question}} of who would represent the Earth as a whole, contact could create other international problems, such as the degree of involvement of governments foreign to the one whose radio astronomers received the signal. The United Nations discussed various issues of foreign relations immediately before the launch of the Voyager probes, which in 2012 left the Solar System carrying a golden record in case they are found by extraterrestrial intelligence. Among the issues discussed were what messages would best represent humanity, what format they should take, how <b>to</b> <b>convey</b> <b>the</b> cultural history of the Earth, and what international groups should be formed to study extraterrestrial intelligence in greater detail.|$|E
5|$|Around 1925, {{having had}} little success in Batavia, Andjar moved to Padang, {{where he was}} a {{reporter}} for the daily Sinar Soematera. At the same time, he worked with the city's Padangsche Opera, writing stage plays. In contrast to the standard musical theatre of the time, bangsawan, he promoted a more natural style, using dialogue instead of song <b>to</b> <b>convey</b> <b>the</b> story; he referred to this as toneel, based on the Dutch word for theatre. Among the works he wrote for the Padangsche Opera were adaptations of Melati van Agam, a 1923 work by Swan Pen, and Sitti Nurbaya, a 1922 novel by Marah Roesli. These works were well received.|$|E

He also used a handheld camera during some of the busier meeting scenes in Miranda's office, to better convey the flow of action, and slow motion for Andrea's entrance into the office following her makeover. A few process shots were necessary, mainly to put exterior views behind windows on sets and in the Mercedes where Miranda and Andrea are having their climactic conversation.|$|E

This conveys a predicative possessive reading.|$|R

5|$|Cameron's {{inspiration}} for the film came from his fascination with shipwrecks; he felt a love story interspersed with the human loss would be essential <b>to</b> <b>convey</b> <b>the</b> emotional impact of the disaster. Production began in 1995, when Cameron shot footage of the actual Titanic wreck. The modern scenes on the research vessel were shot on board the Akademik Mstislav Keldysh, which Cameron had used as a base when filming the wreck. Scale models, computer-generated imagery, and a reconstruction of the Titanic built at Playas de Rosarito in Baja California were used to re-create the sinking. The film was partially funded by Paramount Pictures and 20th Century Fox. It was the most expensive film ever made at the time, with a production budget of $200million.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{the stylistic}} {{blueprint}} of Debut, Post {{is considered an}} important exponent of art pop and {{is known for its}} eclecticism, mainly incorporating electronic and dance styles—such as techno, trip hop, IDM and house—but also ambient, jazz, industrial and experimental music. A reflection of Björk's new life in London, Post features songs she wrote after moving to England and was intended <b>to</b> <b>convey</b> <b>the</b> fast pace and urban culture of the city, deviating from the themes of its predecessor, which focused on the compositions the singer had written in Iceland. It also centres on the contemporary styles of British underground club culture, with which the singer had established close ties.|$|E
5|$|In Goddess-oriented worship, Vimala (Bimala) is {{regarded}} as the presiding goddess of the Purushottama (Puri) Shakti Pitha. Jagannath, a form of the god Vishnu/Krishna (Krishna is generally regarded as an avatar of Vishnu), is worshipped as the Pitha's Bhairava. This is a departure from the usual tradition of Bhairava as a form of Shiva. So, in this temple complex, Vishnu–one of the Hindu trinity–is equated with Shiva, another of the trinity; this is interpreted <b>to</b> <b>convey</b> <b>the</b> oneness of God. In this regard, Vimala - generally associated with Shiva's consort - is also considered as Lakshmi, the consort of Vishnu. Conversely, Tantrics consider Jagannath as Shiva-Bhairava, rather than a form of Vishnu.|$|E
