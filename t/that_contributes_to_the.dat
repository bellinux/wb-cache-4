5|$|The {{thermal wind}} {{relation}} {{does not explain}} why the winds are organized into tight jets, rather than distributed more broadly over the hemisphere. One factor <b>that</b> <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> creation of a concentrated polar jet is the undercutting of sub-tropical air masses by the more dense polar air masses at the polar front. This causes surface low pressure and higher pressure at altitude. At high altitudes, lack of friction allows air to respond freely to the steep pressure gradient with low pressure at high altitude over the pole. This results {{in the formation of}} planetary wind circulations that experience a strong Coriolis deflection and thus can be considered 'quasi-geostrophic'. The polar front jet stream is closely linked to the frontogenesis process in midlatitudes, as the acceleration/deceleration of the air flow induces areas of low/high pressure respectively, which link to the formation of cyclones and anticyclones along the polar front in a relatively narrow region.|$|E

25|$|It is the {{disagreement}} amongst {{the advocates of}} different approaches to problems or solutions which hinders the formation of any consensual strategy and the mobilization of adequate resources. That is why the Encyclopedia uses an approach that is as general and minimally structured as is feasible without losing coherence and utility. The intent is first to contribute to clarify the nature, extent, and interrelationships of problems and solutions. Even the distinction between problems and solutions is not always clear. For instance, housing {{an increasing number of}} people is a solution that may aggravate the problem of urban overcrowding, and the death of individuals is a problem <b>that</b> <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> solution of reducing ecological impact of overpopulation.|$|E
25|$|With {{abundant}} water, a grapevine {{will produce}} shallow root systems and vigorous growths of new plant shoots. This {{can contribute to}} a large, leafy canopy and high yields of large grape berry clusters {{that may not be}} sufficiently or physiologically ripe. With insufficient water, many of the vine's important physiological structures, including photosynthesis <b>that</b> <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> development of sugars and phenolic compounds in the grape, can shut down. The key to irrigation is to provide just enough water for the plant to continuing function without encouraging vigorous growth of new shoots and shallow roots. The exact amount of water will depend on a variety of factors including how much natural rainfall can be expected as well as the water retaining and drainage properties of the soil.|$|E
25|$|The {{endothelium}} {{of blood}} vessels produces an extensive range of substances that influence blood flow and, in turn, is affected by changes in the blood and the pressure of blood flow. For example, local nitric oxide and endothelin, which are secreted by the endothelium, are the major regulators of vascular tone and blood pressure. In patients with essential hypertension, the balance between the vasodilators and the vasoconstrictors is upset, which leads {{to changes in the}} endothelium and sets up a “vicious cycle” <b>that</b> <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> maintenance of high blood pressure. In patients with hypertension, endothelial activation and damage also lead to changes in vascular tone, vascular reactivity, and coagulation and fibrinolytic pathways. Alterations in endothelial function are a reliable indicator of target organ damage and atherosclerotic disease, as well as prognosis.|$|E

25|$|Salary {{disparities between}} men and women may {{partially}} be explained by differences in negotiation tactics used by men and women. Although men and women are equally likely to initiate in a salary negotiation with employers, men will achieve higher outcomes than women by about 2% of starting salary Studies have indicated that men tend to use active negotiation tactics of directly asking for a higher salary, while women tend to use more of an indirect approach by emphasizing self-promotion tactics (e.g. explaining the motivation to be a good employee). Other research indicates that early-childhood play patterns may influence the way men and women negotiate. Men and women tend to view salary differently in terms of relative importance. Overall level of confidence in a negotiation may also be a determinant of why men tend to achieve higher outcomes in salary negotiations. Finally, the awareness of this stereotype alone may directly cause women to achieve lower outcomes as one study indicates. Regardless of the cause, the outcome yields a disparity {{between men and}} women <b>that</b> <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> overall wage gap observed in many nations.|$|E
25|$|Another factor <b>that</b> <b>contributes</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{ability of}} an acid {{to lose a}} proton is the {{strength}} of the bond between the acidic hydrogen and the atom that bears it. This, in turn, is dependent {{on the size of the}} atoms sharing the bond. For an acid HA, as the size of atom A increases, {{the strength of the}} bond decreases, meaning that it is more easily broken, and the strength of the acid increases. Bond strength is a measure of how much energy it takes to break a bond. In other words, it takes less energy to break the bond as atom A grows larger, and the proton is more easily removed by a base. This partially explains why hydrofluoric acid is considered a weak acid, while the other hydrohalic acids (HCl, HBr, HI) are strong acids. Although fluorine is more electronegative than the other halogens, its atomic radius is also much smaller, so it shares a stronger bond with hydrogen. Moving down a column on the periodic table, atoms become less electronegative but also significantly larger, and the size of the atom tends to dominate its acidity when sharing a bond to hydrogen. Hydrogen sulfide, H2S, is a stronger acid than water, even though oxygen is more electronegative than sulfur. Just as with the halogens, this is because sulfur is larger than oxygen and the H—S bond is more easily broken than the H—O bond.|$|E
