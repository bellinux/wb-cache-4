50|$|In 1713, Sir Christopher Wren {{purchased}} the estate as his country residence. While he is buried at St Paul's Cathedral, {{his wife and}} family are buried at Wroxall. His coat of arms is displayed {{on the south side}} of the present cathedral. In 1861 the Dugdale family {{purchased the}} estate and had the present Mansion House built after demolishing the previous house. The church was also internally renovated by the architect who designed the house. His name was Ryland. He later wrote a History of Wroxall Abbey (1903). Much of <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>contained</b> <b>here</b> is described in this publication. A girls' school, the Wroxall Abbey Girls School, was founded in the Mansion House in 1936, when the proprietors of the School leased 27 acres of the property, including the church. Ministers continued to be appointed during this period. The school closed together with the church in 1995.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{graduate}} project {{was to develop a}} guidebook, or manual, which explains how to build a library collection for an alternative high school library. <b>The</b> library collection <b>information</b> <b>contained</b> <b>here</b> is for Central Academy, a new alternative high school in Joint School District No. 2 in Meridian, Idaho. A school library is an essential component in promoting literacy in the school. As both a librarian and a reading teacher I see the connection between literacy and libraries; there are many components of library collection development that reading professionals should consider such as interest level, reading level, lexile score, and content. This project entailed surveying staff and students at the school to determine areas of need and interest for the new library. It also included consulting with district personnel to determine a budget and time frame for the project. Library materials were gathered based on thorough searching of the collection databases of three vendors: Delaney, Follett, and Perma-Bound. After a list was created, the director of district library services edited the lists and provided suggestions for improvement. The books were then ordered over the summer, added to the catalog, and shelved prior {{to the beginning of the}} school year...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the fifth}} {{of a series of}} monographs {{sponsored}} by the Russell Sage Foundation dealing with certain established or emerging professions in the United States. Earlier publications in the series have concerned social work, engineering, nursing, and medical care. The 2 ̆ 2 philosophy and method of procedure 2 ̆ 2 of these studies have been to view the professions 2 ̆ 2 primarily in relation to their effectiveness in meeting public needs, 2 ̆ 2 and thereafter with respect to their success in satisfying professional and group interests. The author is thus well-experienced in analyzing occupations and has a judicious and fair-minded approach to her subject. The result is, as indeed its sponsorship promised, an objective and readable account of our profes- sion seen through the eyes of an unusually well-informed layman. In general, <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>here</b> <b>contained</b> should not be news to a lawyer who has made any attempt to keep abreast of developments in the law. It is, however, an excellent summary for the lay reader. And while the author is restrained [...] certainly too much so to make her book exciting reading [...] in forming and presenting her own judgments, nevertheless the showing here made of what the lawyers are doing, and perhaps even more of what they are not doing, deserves serious thought, and perhaps some disturbing reflections, on the-part of both those within and those without the profession...|$|R

Describing the necessary tools and how to create and use them, the authors compose the task into modules, placing equal emphasis on the action and data aspects of compilation. Attribute grammars are used extensively to provide a uniform treatment of semantic analysis, competent code generation and assembly. The authors also explain how intermediate representations can be chosen automatically on the basis of attribute dependence. Thus, all aspects of the subject are presented in terms of a uniform model subject to automation. This approach imparts a vivid understanding of the compilation and the decisions that must be made when designing a compiler. From the back page of the printed book.
