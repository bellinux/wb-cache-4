25|$|In direct {{contrast}} to German philosophy, which descends from heaven to earth, here we ascend from earth to heaven. That is <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>we</b> do not {{set out from}} what men say, imagine, conceive, nor from men as narrated, thought of, imagined, conceived, in order to arrive at men in the flesh. We set out from real, active men, and {{on the basis of}} their real life process we demonstrate the development of the ideological reflexes and echoes of this life process. The phantoms formed in the human brain are also, necessarily, sublimates of their material life process, which is empirically verifiable and bound to material premises. Morality, religion, metaphysics, all the rest of ideology and their corresponding forms of consciousness, thus no longer retain the semblance of independence. They have no history, no development; but men, developing their material production and their material intercourse, alter, along with this, their real existence, their thinking, and the products of their thinking. Life is not determined by consciousness, but consciousness by life.|$|E
25|$|I {{turned to}} Walter and said, “This movie is {{somewhat}} weirder than we thought.”... We just didn’t anticipate what {{the combination of}} elements was going to be. We had a very conscious design concept of the movie, but I think we didn’t fully grasp how strong it would be, {{in terms of the}} combination of elements. In a way, I think Streets of Fire was about expanding The Warriors concept to a bigger stage. But when expanding it to a bigger scale, it changed. The movie’s bigness of size—compositionally—changed the meaning of things and made it more of a fairy tale... The Warriors, it was bewoven with a unique sense of realism. The fact that they made a deal with real gangs to be extras in the film. There was a true Godardian dialectic going on between artifice and reality. It’s a very real-world film, in some respects, but it’s very artificial at the same time... We did that again, but we put the emphasis on the artifice. And we didn’t fully…I want <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>we</b> had too much integrity. We went further with that, perhaps, than we should have. I don’t know. I can’t put everything together about what didn’t work, but the most damaging thing is that we didn’t have the right actor for Tom Cody. Maybe if we’d had Tom Cruise, we might have had a success. But our commitment to be stylized was thorough and conscious and maybe too extreme for the mainstream audience.|$|E

It was a magnificent final. We knew that they could score goals but that we could also. We needed to keep going but after 63 games it was really difficult." [...] Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard also praised West Ham, stating: [...] "West Ham were brilliant, they gave us a really good game {{but we had a}} never-say-die attitude and we stuck in there, our best chance was on penalties as we did not have any energy left." [...] Due {{to the nature of the}} comeback, the match has come to be regarded as The Gerrard Final, teammate Peter Crouch summed up the effect Gerrard had on the match: [...] "When the injury-time board went up we thought our chance had gone, but it is always good to have a player like Steven Gerrard in your team."

[...] In response to concerns about working with the Ugandan government, Invisible Children explained that they [...] "do not defend any of the human rights abuses perpetrated by the Ugandan government or the Ugandan army". They added that the reason why they are working with the Ugandan army even though Kony is no longer in Uganda is that the army is [...] "more organized and better equipped than that of any of the other affected countries (DRC, South Sudan, CAR) to track down Joseph Kony" [...] and that they want all of the governments in the region to work together to arrest Kony.

Dogmeat though, despite being a definite tabula rasa, sits in a different category altogether and is the only computer game character that we’d reload and repeat significant portions of a game for, just so he could stand a better chance of survival." [...] In 2009, Michael Fiegel of The Escapist called Dogmeat possibly the most beloved character of the Fallout universe, writing that [...] "in an uncaring wasteland ... Dogmeat is a moral compass: Though your needle might swing towards good or evil, his center always holds strong provided you protect him." [...] Steve and Larson of ScrewAttack ranked Dogmeat as the tenth best gaming pet in 2011.

500|$|In 1813 the United States was at {{war with}} Great Britain, and Baltimore was {{preparing}} for an eventual attack as the fleet of the British Royal Navy had complete maritime control of the Chesapeake Bay. [...] Major George Armistead, the U.S. Army commander of the Infantry and Artillery units that defended Fort McHenry in Baltimore, felt that the fort was prepared for an attack, except it lacked a flag. [...] In {{a letter to the}} head of the Maryland Militia and military commander for Baltimore, Major General Samuel Smith, he wrote, [...] "We, sir, are ready at Fort McHenry to defend Baltimore against invading by the enemy. [...] That is <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>we</b> are ready except that we have no suitable ensign to display over the Star Fort and it is my desire to have a flag so large that the British will have no difficulty seeing it from a distance." [...] A delegation consisting of Armistead, Smith, Brig. General John Stricker, and Commodore Joshua Barney, Pickersgill's brother-in-law, visited with Pickersgill, and discussed the particulars of the desired flag. [...] They commissioned Pickersgill to make two flags, [...] "one American ensign, 30 X 42 feet, first quality bunting" [...] and another flag 17 by 25 feet." [...] A task as large as the making of these flags was beyond the capability of one person to complete, and Pickersgill not only drew on members of her own household for help, but also contracted labor from the immediate neighborhood. In early summer 1813, she began the job with the assistance of her daughter, Caroline, her two nieces, Eliza Young and Margaret Young, a free African American apprentice, Grace Wisher, and likely her elderly mother, Rebecca Young. [...] An additional unnamed African American who boarded in the house is also listed as helping in some sources, as were additional local seamstresses who were hired during the summer. Often working late into the evening, until midnight at times, Pickersgill's team was able to complete the job in six weeks. [...] Pickersgill's daughter, in an 1876 letter to Georgiana Armistead Appleton, the daughter of Major Armistead (later breveted a lieutenant colonel), wrote these particulars about the flag: ...|$|E
