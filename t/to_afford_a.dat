Jeremi was able <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> <b>a</b> sizable private army of several thousands, and through the threat of it he was often able to force his neighbours to a favourable settlement of disputes. Soon after his return from the Russian front, he participated {{on the side of the}} Dowmont family in the quarrel over the estate of Dowmontów against another magnate, Samuel Łaszcz, located on his lands; soon after the victorious battle against Łaszcz he bought the lands from the Dowmonts and incorporated them into his estates.|$|E
5|$|Export is {{a special}} resource, only {{available}} to the three Asian civilizations, and is used to hire foreign troops and research technologies from the consulate, where the player can choose a foreign ally or, for the Japanese, isolationism. Export is generated automatically when the villagers are gathering, but its gather rate is much slower than other resources, making it challenging <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> <b>a</b> large foreign army. Export Rate / Experience points are also generated by other means (like sacred cows for Indians) and are specific to each clan.|$|E
5|$|For the exterior, Burges re-used some of {{his earlier}} unexecuted plans, the overall design from the Crimea Memorial Church and St John's Cathedral, Brisbane, the {{elevations}} from Lille Cathedral. The main problem of the building was its size. Despite the prodigious efforts of its fundraisers, and despite Burges exceeding the original budget, Cork was still unable <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> <b>a</b> really large cathedral. Burges overcame this obstacle by using the grandeur of his three-spired exterior to offset the lesser scale of {{the remainder of the}} building.|$|E

5|$|Simpson {{immersed}} {{himself in}} the world of cycling, writing letters asking for advice. Naturalised Austrian rider George Berger responded, travelling from London to Harworth to help him with his riding position. In late 1955, Simpson ran a red light in a race and was suspended from racing for six months by the BLRC. During his suspension he dabbled in motorcycle trials, nearly quitting cycling but unable <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> <b>a</b> new motorcycle necessary for progress in the sport.|$|E
5|$|The {{music for}} Uru: Ages Beyond Myst and Myst V: End of Ages was {{composed}} by Tim Larkin, {{who had gotten}} involved in the series doing sound design for Riven. Larkin stepped away from his background as a jazz composer and musician to create music with less structure and without a definite beginning and end. Larkin created different music depending on the location, giving each setting and Age a distinctive tone. For End of Ages, Larkin was unable <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> <b>a</b> full orchestra to perform his score, so he combined individual instrumentation {{with an array of}} synthesizers.|$|E

5|$|Hogg and {{his family}} {{subsequently}} lived a mostly quiet and stable life together. At times their finances were strained, although they were able <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> <b>a</b> cook and a maid. Hogg enjoyed spending time with his children and paid particular attention to their education. He taught his daughter Prudentia Greek and Latin, but discouraged her from becoming a Bluestocking. Hogg also tried to convince Jane to study Greek, but was unsuccessful. Henry Cleveland, Jane's nephew, moved into their household after leaving the military. Hogg then accepted Henry {{as a member of}} the family. Gardening had always been a hobby of Hogg's, and in his later years he often spent time maintaining his gardens with Jane.|$|E
5|$|In 1952, the {{two couples}} {{discovered}} that Red House {{was up for}} sale, and as architects {{with an interest in}} Morris, they recognised its historic value. By this point, the Red House had been empty for 18 months, after Thomas Hills and his family had left in 1951, and had fallen into a state of dilapidation. Deciding to share the property between themselves, they were able <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> <b>a</b> mortgage {{with the aid of a}} loan from Toms' father-in-law; he only agreed to provide the loan if the house was owned in Toms' name, and thus the Hollambys became Toms' tenants. The two families then moved in with their six children, and a seventh was born soon after. They camped in the house's grounds while carrying out a project of renovation.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1960–61 NBA season, Robertson {{made himself}} {{eligible}} for the 1960 NBA draft. He was drafted by the Cincinnati Royals as a territorial pick. The Royals gave Robertson a $33,000 signing bonus, {{a far cry from}} his childhood days when he was too poor <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> <b>a</b> basketball. In his rookie season, Robertson averaged 30.5 points, 10.1 rebounds and 9.7 assists (leading the league), almost averaging a triple-double for the entire season. He was named NBA Rookie of the Year, was elected into the All-NBA First Team – which would happen in each of Robertson's first nine seasons – and made the first of 12 consecutive All-Star Game appearances. In addition, he was named the 1961 NBA All-Star Game MVP following his 23-point, 14-assist, 9-rebound performance in a West victory. However, the Royals finished with a 33–46 record and stayed in the cellar of the Western Division.|$|E

5|$|Seven Halo soundtracks {{have been}} released. The Halo Original Soundtrack {{contains}} most of Combat Evolveds music.

The engine allows for the mood, theme, and duration of music played to change according to gameplay. <b>To</b> <b>afford</b> <b>a</b> more enjoyable listening experience, O'Donnell rearranged portions of the music of Halo into standalone suites, which follow the narrative course of the game. The soundtrack also contains music not used in the game, including {{a variation on the}} Halo theme that was first played at Halos debut at Macworld 1999.|$|E

25|$|The Type 118 was a Bristol private venture, {{designed}} to provide a multi-role machine capable of acting as a fighter, bomber, reconnaissance or casualty-extraction aircraft for foreign air forces unable <b>to</b> <b>afford</b> <b>a</b> range of more specialised aircraft. The variety of roles required a two-seater and the need for high-altitude performance for the photo-reconnaissance role, for example, called for supercharging. Since the Bristol Jupiter radial engine design was ageing, the newer Bristol Mercury seemed a natural choice of powerplant. The first prototype was to have a supercharged Bristol Jupiter XFA engine, with the Mercury V installed in the second machine which was labelled the Type 118A.|$|E
