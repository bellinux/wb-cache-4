40|$|Background: Thallium- 201 {{myocardial}} perfusion scan is {{a commonly}} utilized {{method for detection}} of coronary artery disease. Although this technique is generally reliable, results can be inconclusive in some cases. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess whether candidates for coronary angiogram could be better identified with the addition of an electrocardiographic (ECG) -gated myocardial perfusion scan to a <b>thallium</b> <b>scan.</b> Method: A total of 512 patients with suspected coronary artery disease were included in this study and received a <b>thallium</b> <b>scan.</b> In 69 patients, the results were borderline, and 32 of these 69 patients also received an ECG-gated scan and underwent coronary angiogram within one month. Results: We found that 21 of the 32 patients who underwent coronary angiogram had significant coronary artery disease. However, when an ECG-gated perfusion scan was also performed, 25 of the 32 patients had abnormal regional wall motion following the stress test. Twenty-one of these 25 patients were found to have significant coronary artery disease. Statistical analysis revealed that the ECG-gated perfusion scan in combination with the <b>thallium</b> <b>scan</b> was significantly more accurate than the <b>thallium</b> <b>scan</b> alone in borderline cases of myocardial perfusio...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{predictive}} {{accuracy of}} thallium imaging for {{the diagnosis of}} restenosis after angioplasty was evaluated in 121 patients who had undergone a successful procedure. Patients were evaluated three times over a 1 year follow-up period for symptoms, elertrocardiographic (ECG) changes during exercise {{and the presence of}} reversible ischemia on exercise thallium imaging. At initial evaluation (4 to 6 weeks after angioplasty), 104 patients (86 %) were asymptomatic. Of the 17 patients with chest pain symptoms, 9 had reversible ischemia on thallium imaging and all had restenosis. Of the 104 asymptomatic patients, 26 (25 %) had a positive <b>thallium</b> <b>scan</b> (reversible ischemia) and this sign identified a high risk group. Evidence of restenosis was present by 6 months in 22 (85 %) and by 1 year in 25 (96 %) of these 26 patients. The largest group of patients manifested symptoms by the second evaluation (between 3 and 6 months after angioplasty). Of 28 patients with symptoms and a positive <b>thallium</b> <b>scan</b> at this evaluation, 26 had restenosis; on initial evaluation, 22 of these 26 patients had no symptoms but had had a positive thallium study. Ten of the 65 patients in the asymptomatic group had a positive <b>thallium</b> <b>scan,</b> but the scans of this group were not as predictive for recurrent symptoms as were those of the same group at initial evaluation. The 74 patients who had a negative <b>thallium</b> <b>scan</b> at 3 to 6 months with or without associated symptoms had a low likelihood of developing restenosis or symptoms. By the 1 year evaluation, only five additional patients became symptomatic and four of those had previously been identified as having a positive thallium study. Nineteen patients continued to have chest pain symptoms with a negative <b>thallium</b> <b>scan.</b> Fifteen of these had repeat catheterization and only one had restenosis. In this clinical study, sequential thallium imaging provided an accurate prediction of which patients would develop restenosis and the time course it would follow. Thallium imaging identified high and low risk patients after angioplasty and was superior to symptoms or ECG changes in the evaluation of patients...|$|E

40|$|Coronary {{artery disease}} occurs {{commonly}} {{in patients with}} aortic aneurysms and is {{a major cause of}} morbidity and mortality. The role of screening and intervention for cardiac disease prior to aneurysm repair is controversial. The outcome after cardiac screening with <b>thallium</b> <b>scanning</b> and/or angiography in 102 consecutive patients undergoing aortic aneurysm repair was documented. Significant coronary artery disease was found in 34 (33 %) patients and two patients had either coronary artery bypass or angioplasty prior to aneurysm repair. There was no cardiac mortality after aneurysm repair and the overall mortality on an intention-to-treat basis was 2 %. There was good correlation between prior history of cardiac events, electrocardiography (ECG) and the results of screening with <b>thallium</b> <b>scanning</b> and angiography, There was no correlation between cardiac history, ECG and the incidence of cardiac events in the postoperative period. Significant coronary artery disease was found in 33 % of patients without a cardiac history or abnormal ECG. Cardiac screening with <b>thallium</b> <b>scanning</b> confirmed a high incidence of significant coronary disease in patients with aortic aneurysm. In this study, cardiac intervention followed by expedient aneurysm repair in 20 patients was associated with zero mortality. The short-term benefit of such a policy is difficult to prove and its main advantage may be better long-term survival. (C) 1999 The Society for Cardiovascular Surgery.

40|$|HE {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether a stereotactic biopsy is useful in differentiating tumor recurrence from radiation necrosis in patients with irradiated glioma. After optimum surgical and radiation treatments in a patient with glioma, clinical or radiographic evidence of progression may develop because of tumor recurrence, radiation necrosis, both entities, or rarely, a radiation-induced neoplasm. It is important to differentiate among these possibilities, because subsequent therapy and prognosis are guided by the cause of progression. 2, 5, 29, 31, 48, 50, 60, 75, 79 Tumor recurrence cannot be differentiated from radionecrosis clinically or with computerized tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance (MR) imaging.

40|$|Cardiovascular {{disease is}} the leading cause of death in {{surgical}} patients and because of this a number of strategies have been utilised to attempt to predict the cardiac risk of surgery. Theoretically, accurate pre-operative risk stratification would allow patients at low risk to have their surgery expedited efficiently, whilst those at higher risk could have a change made to their treatment plan such as peri-operative cardiac optimisation or in some cases, modification of the operative procedure. Despite this rationale, no guidelines currently exist in the United Kingdom for the management of the surgical patient at high cardiac risk. This may partly reflect the limited methods of risk stratification currently available. Clinical scoring systems are simple and inexpensive but limited by their predictive value. Trans-thoracic echocardiography provides prognostic information but is inconsistent, adding little to clinical information alone. The most accurate methods of pre-operative cardiac risk prediction at the present time are dobutamine stress echocardiography and dipyridamole <b>thallium</b> <b>scanning.</b> However they are expensive, time consuming and have shown poor positive predictive ability, even in high risk cohorts...|$|R
40|$|Eight {{normotensive}} {{patients with}} electrocardiographic criteria for {{left ventricular hypertrophy}} with giant negative T waves were studied with Thallium- 201 imaging and M-mode echocardiography. In all the patients <b>Thallium</b> <b>scanning</b> demonstrated increased thickness of the left ventricular walls. In five of the above cases areas of increased uptake were noted in the apical region which had increased thickness {{as compared to the}} rest of the left ventricular wall. Echocardiography showed in one subject obstructive hypertrophic myocardiopathy and in another two asymmetric septal hypertrophy. In the remaining patients there was always present septal and posterior wall hypertrophy. Reliable echocardiograms of the apex were done in five subjects and in these hypertrophy was noted. The results of the two techniques were compared and correlated clinically and with the literature. The authors conclude in agreement with other studies that the picture of electrocardiographic left ventricular hypertrophy with giant negative T waves is indicative of hypertrophic myocardiopathies.

40|$|Exercise thallium- 201 {{perfusion}} scans and gated equilibrium blood pool scans {{were performed}} in 120 catheterized {{patients with a}} chest pain syndrome. Eighty-six patients had coronary artery disease and 34 patients did not. The effects of gender, propranolol, exercise level, exercise ischemia, history of typical angina, history of previous myocardial infarction, electrocardiographic Q waves, number of diseased vessels and extent of coronary artery obstruction on diagnostic accuracy were evaluated. The overall sensitivity and specificity of thallium scans were 76 and 68 %, respectively, and those of gated blood pool scans 80 and 62 % (p = not significant). Propranolol decreased the specificity of thallium scans (propranolol = 42 %; no propranolol = 87 %, p < 0. 05). Thallium scans and anginal history were less sensitive for detecting coronary disease in women (men: thallium = 79 %; angina = 77 %; women: 54 and 46 %, respectively; p < 0. 05). Exercise level did not significantly affect the diagnostic accuracy of either scan. Thallium and gated scans were both highly sensitive (95 %) in detecting disease in 20 patients with a prior myocardial infarction, angina and a positive electrocardiogram. The sensitivity of the <b>thallium</b> <b>scan</b> signifi- cantly decreased {{as the number of}} diseased vessels decreased. Both thallium and gated scans were less frequently positive in patients with atypical angina or no Q waves, but were not significantly influenced by electrocardiographic ischemia. The sensitivity and specificity of both scans were low in 57 patients with the combination of atypical angina, no history of infarction and equivocal stress electrocardiogram (thallium = 61 and 63 %, respectively; gated = 61 and 67 %). When stress <b>thallium</b> <b>scan</b> evaluation included the electrocardiogram and <b>thallium</b> <b>scan</b> interpretation, the diagnostic accuracy was 81 %. When all the information from gated scans (wall motion, ejection fraction, pulmonary blood volume) was combined for final gated scan evaluation, the diagnostic accuracy was 83 %. When electrocardiographic data were added to all three gated scan variables, diagnostic accuracy was 77 %. In conclusion, thallium perfusion and gated blood pool scans have reasonable diagnostic accuracy for coronary artery disease in a group of patients with a moderately high prevalence of disease. However, combined variables from each test are needed to provide reliable diagnostic accuracy...|$|E

40|$|Medical imaging market {{consists}} of several billion tests per year worldwide. Out of these, {{at least one}} third are cardiovascular procedures. Keeping in mind that each test represents a cost, often a risk, and a diagnostic hypothesis, we can agree that every unnecessary and unjustifiable test is one test too many. Small individual costs, risks, and wastes multiplied by billions of examinations per year represent an important population, society and environmental burden. Unfortunately, the appropriateness of cardiac imaging is extra-ordinarily low {{and there is little}} awareness in patients and physicians of differential costs, radiological doses, and long term risks of different imaging modalities. For a resting cardiac imaging test, being the average cost (not charges) of an echocardiogram equal to 1 (as a cost comparator), the cost of a CT is 3. 1 x, of a SPECT 3. 27 x, of a Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance imaging 5. 51 x, of a PET 14. 03 x, and of a right and left heart catheterization 19. 96 x. For stress cardiac imaging, compared with the treadmill exercise test equal to 1 (as a cost comparator), the cost of stress echocardiography is 2. 1 x and of a stress SPECT scintigraphy is 5. 7 x.

The thallium defect, expressed as a numerical value in arbitrary units, was smaller after early revascularization (within 4 hr of the onset of symptoms, n = 10) than in the controls: 397 +/- 232 vs 2779 +/- 972 for anterior infarction (p less than. 001) and 475 +/- 511 vs 1454 +/- 960 for inferior infarction (p less than. 05). The patients undergoing revascularization late (4 to 5 hr after the onset of symptoms, n = 3) had thallium defects comparable {{to those in the}} controls. Regional ejection fraction of the involved left ventricular segment was higher after early revascularization (41 +/- 9 % vs 21 +/- 8 % for anterior infarction, p less than. 005; 67 +/- 14 % vs 51 +/- 11 % for inferior infarction, p less than. 01). Global ejection fraction was higher after early revascularization in patients with anterior infarction (57 +/- 10 % vs 37 +/- 9 %, p less than 0. 02), but not in those with inferior infarction (60 +/- 11 % vs 54 +/- 8 %, p greater than. 05). After late revascularization, regional and global ejection fraction were comparable to those in controls. In selected patients, early reperfusion of acutely ischemic myocardium by ECABS can limit size of infarction and preserve left ventricular function, but time constraints may be severe. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|ObjectivesWe {{sought to}} {{determine}} the role of preoperative predictors, particularly ischemia, on preoperative <b>thallium</b> <b>scanning</b> (PTS) and coronary revascularization on low-level and conventional troponin elevations after major vascular surgery. BackgroundPostoperative cardiac troponin (cTn) elevations have recently been shown to predict both short- and long-term mortality after vascular surgery. MethodsThe perioperative data, including PTS and subsequent coronary revascularization, continuous perioperative 12 -lead ST-segment trend monitoring, cTn-I and/or cTn-T, and creatine kinase-MB fraction {{in the first three}} postoperative days, were prospectively collected in 501 consecutive elective major vascular procedures. ResultsModerate to severe inducible ischemia on PTS was associated with a 49. 0 % incidence of low-level (cTn-I > 0. 6 and/or cTn-T > 0. 03 ng/ml) and 22. 4 % conventional (cTn-I > 1. 5 and/or cTn-T > 0. 1 ng/ml) troponin elevation. In contrast, patients with preoperative coronary revascularization had 23. 4 % and 6. 4 % low-level and conventional troponin elevations, respectively, similar to patients without ischemia on PTS. By multivariate logistic regression, ischemia on PTS was the most important predictor of both low-level and conventional troponin elevations (adjusted odds ratios [ORs] 2. 5 and 2. 7, p = 0. 02 and 0. 04, respectively), whereas preoperative coronary revascularization predicted less troponin elevations (adjusted ORs 0. 35 and 0. 16, p = 0. 045 and 0. 022, respectively). Postoperative ischemia (> 10 min), the more so prolonged (> 30 min) ischemia was the only independent predictor of troponin elevation if added with the preoperative predictors to the multivariate analysis (ORs 15. 8 and 22. 8, respectively; p < 0. 001). ConclusionsTroponin elevations occur frequently after vascular surgery. They are strongly associated with postoperative ischemia, predicted by inducible ischemia on PTS, and reduced by preoperative coronary revascularization...|$|R
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{relation}} between extent of ischemia and the magnitude of hemodynamic changes, 25 patients (5 with normal coronary arteries and 20 with significant coronary obstructive disease) were studied with rapid atrial pacing and thallium scintigraphy {{at the time of}} cardiac catheterization. Hemodynamic variables were measured before, during and after maximal pacing. Thallium was injected intravenously during maximal pacing and scans in three standard views were obtained immediately in the catheterization laboratory, with delayed scans obtained 4 hours after the cessation of pacing. The three <b>thallium</b> <b>scans</b> were each subdivided into five segments, and a thallium score was obtained {{on the basis of the}} total number of segments that were hypoperfused. Each patient was assigned a total thallium score corresponding to thallium defects at maximal pacing, as well as a redistributed thallium score corresponding to the difference between thallium score at maximal pacing and that 4 hours later. With pacing, patients with normal coronary arteries demonstrated no significant change in baseline hemodynamic variables, whereas patients with coronary artery disease exhibited a decrease in cardiac index, an increase in systemic vascular resistance, a widening of arteriovenous oxygen difference, an increase in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure and mean pulmonary artery pressure during maximal pacing and an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure immediately after pacing. There was a significant correlation (Spearman rank r = 0. 64, p < 0. 01) between redistributed thallium score and an increase in left ventricular end-diastolic pressure in the postpacing period. Moreover, there was an even higher correlation (Spearman rank r = 0. 90, p < 0. 001) between total thallium score and the postpacing increase in end-diastolic pressure. It is concluded that in patients with coronary artery disease the magnitude of pacing-induced hemodynamic changes reflects both the amount of myocardial tissue at ischemic jeopardy and the total mass of hypoperfused myocardium during maximal pacing stress...|$|R

A multicentre epidemiological study {{to detect the}} prevalence of mvo car dial ischaemia in hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) was performed in 188 asymptomatic male hypertensives (131 treated). The mean age was 55 (range 40 - 82) years with blood pressure (BP) ^ 160 / 100 mmHg or a systolic BP ^ 180 mmHg. The participants were screened with echocardiography, and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), defined as LV mass index (LVMl) > 130 g. m~ 2, was found in 127 (68 %), of whom 95 were on antihypertensive treatment. Patients with LVH underwent a maximal bicycle ergometer exercise test and significant ST depression, indicating possible stress-induced ischaemia. was found in 29 men (23 %). These subjects were subjected to exercise thallium- 201 scintigraphy, which was normal in 14 but showed reversible perfusion defects in 15. Thus, a high prevalence of L VH (70 %) was detected in male hypertensives selected onlv on age and BP.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Cardiovascular {{disease is}} one of the main causes of death in {{developed}} and Third World countries. According to the statement of the World Health Organization, it is predicted that death due to heart disease will rise to 23 million by 2030. According to the latest statistics reported by Iran’s Minister of health, 3. 39 % of all deaths are attributed to cardiovascular diseases and 19. 5 % are related to myocardial infarction. The aim of this study was to predict coronary artery disease using data mining algorithms. Methods: In this study, various bioinformatics algorithms, such as decision trees, neural networks, support vector machines, clustering, etc., were used to predict coronary heart disease. The data used in this study was taken from several valid databases (including 14 data). Results: In this research, data mining techniques can be effectively used to diagnose different diseases, including coronary artery disease. Also, for the first time, a prediction system based on support vector machine with the best possible accuracy was introduced.

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] Patients with {{exercise}} induced ventricular tachycardia {{associated with a}} "clinically normal" heart may have an abnormality of the regional distribution of the cardiac sympathetic nerve supply. In this study the regional distribution of the myocardial nerve supply in patients with ventricular tachycardia (VT) and control subjects was examined by [123] meta-iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scanning. PATIENTS AND DESIGN [...] Eight patients {{with exercise}} induced VT and seven patients with VT unrelated to exercise with "clinically normal" hearts were studied and compared with a control group of six subjects with atrioventricular reentrant tachycardia not related to exercise and eight patients with angiographically normal left ventricular function and normal coronary anatomy who had <b>thallium</b> <b>scans</b> without evidence of ischaemia or fixed perfusion deficits. METHODS [...] Single photon emission computed tomography gamma scanning was performed in patients three hours after intravenous injection of MIBG. The left ventricular MIBG uptake data was processed into bull's-eye target plots. The inferior portion of the scan frequently showed artefact due to uptake of MIBG in the liver or spleen and was not used for statistical analysis. Asymmetry of uptake {{was defined as a}} ratio of uptake exceeding 1. 25 in the upper quadrants (posterior (anterolateral free wall) /anterior (anteroseptal region)) of the MIBG scan. RESULTS [...] Patients with VT had a higher proportion of asymmetrical MIBG scans (47 %) than subjects in the control groups (0 %) and this was particularly obvious in the patients with exercise induced VT (62. 5 %). This suggests that patients with VT may have relative denervation in the septal portion of the left ventricle leading to an imbalance of the sympathetic supply to the myocardium and locally imbalanced sympathetic or parasympathetic interactions. Considerable evidence from animal experiments suggests that imbalance of the sympathetic supply to the myocardium is important in the genesis of ventricular arrhythmia. CONCLUSIONS [...] These results support the hypothesis that selective denervation of the human myocardium may be an important mechanism in the genesis of VT in "clinically normal" hearts...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to evaluate the}} prognostic value {{of an increase in}} fluorine (F) - 18 deoxyglucose uptake compared wilh clinical, angiographic and stress thallium findings in patients with myocardial infarction. Background. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging using F- 18 deoxyglucose has been applied to assess tissue viability in patients with coronary artery disease. We hypothesized that patients with a myocardial segment with augmented F- 18 deoxyglucose uptake are at high risk for a future cardiac event. Methods. One hundred fifty-eight consecutive patients with myocardial infarction referred for F- 18 deoxyglucose PET and stress <b>thallium</b> <b>scans</b> were studied. Follow-up was obtained in 84 patients at a mean interval of 23 months to investigate prognostic implications of radionuclide studies. Results. Seventeen patients had a cardiac event during the follow-up interval. Univariate analysis showed that an increase in F- 18 deosyglucose uptake was the best predictor of a future cardiac event (p = 0. 0006), followed by the number of stenosed vessels (p = 0. 008). In the multivariate analysis, when an increase in F- 18 deoxyglucose uptake was entered into the model, only angiographic variables had an independent value, whereas no other radionuclide variables showed value. Among patients who did not show redistribution, a future cardiac event was observed more often in patients with than in those without an increase in F- 18 deoxyglucose uptake (p < 0. 05). Conclusions. Thus, an increase in F- 18 deoxyglucose uptake seemed to be the best predictor of a future cardiac event among all clinical, angiographic and redionuclide variables in this study of stable patients with myocardial infarction. Even when a stress thallium- 201 scan does not show redistribution, those patients who have an increase in F- 18 deoxyglucose uptake in a PET study may be at risk for a future cardiac event, and these patients may need aggressive treatment to prevent a future cardiac event...|$|R
