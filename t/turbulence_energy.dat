50|$|Kraichnan {{developed}} his turbulence theories over many decades {{and was one}} of the prominent American theorists in this area. From 1967 onwards, he maintained that for two-dimensional <b>turbulence</b> <b>energy</b> does not only dissipate itself from large scales (determined by the size of obstacles in the flow) to smaller ones as it does in three dimensions, but conversely that smaller fluctuations can increase in size. This theory is called the inverse Energy Cascade, and it is especially applicable to oceanography and meteorology, since flows on the surface of the earth are approximately two-dimensional. The theory was tested and confirmed in the 1980s by data gathered from weather balloons.|$|E
50|$|Vortex {{stretching}} is at {{the core}} of the description of the <b>turbulence</b> <b>energy</b> cascade from the large scales to the small scales in turbulence. In general, in turbulence fluid elements are more lengthened than squeezed, on average. In the end, this results in more vortex stretching than vortex squeezing. For incompressible flow—due to volume conservation of fluid elements—the lengthening implies thinning of the fluid elements in the directions perpendicular to the stretching direction. This reduces the radial length scale of the associated vorticity. Finally, at the small scales of the order of the Kolmogorov microscales, the turbulence kinetic energy is dissipated into heat through the action of molecular viscosity.|$|E

The Reynolds stress criterion was selected for the convergence of the model as it is a good representation of the range of turbulent dynamics in the wake of a wind turbine. The description demonstrates that the <b>turbulence</b> kinetic <b>energy</b> production and the flux of <b>turbulence</b> kinetic <b>energy</b> are accurately rebuilt with approximately 1 % of the total resultant orthogonal modes. Structures associated with the top-tip of the rotor blade reconstruct with fewer modes than those associated with the bottom-tip of the rotor or the nacelle.

50|$|Rotationality : Turbulent flows have non-zero {{vorticity}} and {{are characterized}} by a strong three-dimensional vortex generation mechanism known as vortex stretching. In fluid dynamics, they are essentially vortices subjected to stretching associated with a corresponding increase of the component of vorticity in the stretching direction—due to the conservation of angular momentum. On the other hand, vortex stretching is the core mechanism on which the <b>turbulence</b> <b>energy</b> cascade relies to establish the structure function. In general, the stretching mechanism implies thinning of the vortices in the direction perpendicular to the stretching direction due to volume conservation of fluid elements. As a result, the radial length scale of the vortices decreases and the larger flow structures break down into smaller structures. The process continues until the small scale structures are small enough that their kinetic energy can be transformed by the fluid's molecular viscosity into heat. This is why turbulence is always rotational and three dimensional. For example, atmospheric cyclones are rotational but their substantially two-dimensional shapes do not allow vortex generation and so are not turbulent. On the other hand, oceanic flows are dispersive but essentially non rotational and therefore are not turbulent.|$|E
40|$|New {{regulations}} {{in the second}} edition of NORSOK Standard C- 004, released in May 2013, {{require the use of}} a Reynolds stress transport model for numerical simulations of turbulence above helidecks on the Norwegian continental shelf. To ensure safe flying conditions, maximum bounds are given on the standard deviation of the vertical velocity component above the helideck. Two Reynolds stress transport models, as well as simpler models based on the <b>turbulence</b> <b>energy,</b> are compared in numerical simulations of structure induced turbulence on a simplified offshore rig with a helideck, using the computational fluid dynamics package STAR-CCM+. In addition to helideck simulations, three test cases are simulated for validation and verification with experimental measurements, DNS, and simulations by others. The Reynolds stress transport models do not outperform the <b>turbulence</b> <b>energy</b> transport models in the validation and verification simulations. The vertical Reynolds stress component is typically underestimated compared to experimental measurements, while the <b>turbulence</b> <b>energy</b> transport models typically overestimate the vertical Reynolds stress component. The same tendencies are found in the helideck simulations, the predicted magnitude of the vertical Reynolds stress component is smaller with the Reynolds stress transport models. The turbulence criteria in NORSOK Standard C- 004 could have been based on the <b>turbulence</b> <b>energy</b> instead of the standard deviation of the vertical velocity component. The <b>turbulence</b> <b>energy</b> is half the sum of the velocity variances, hence it includes turbulence in all directions. Calculations of the <b>turbulence</b> <b>energy</b> are less sensitive to the modeling of redistribution in Reynolds stress transport models and the constitutive relation in <b>turbulence</b> <b>energy</b> transport models.

40|$|We {{formulate}} {{and implement}} the Euler equations with SGS dynamics and provide numerical tests of an SGS <b>turbulence</b> <b>energy</b> model that predicts the turbulent pressure of unresolved velocity fluctuations {{and the rate}} of dissipation for highly compressible turbulence. We test closures for the <b>turbulence</b> <b>energy</b> cascade by filtering data from high-resolution simulations of forced isothermal and adiabatic turbulence. Optimal properties and an excellent correlation are found for a linear combination of the eddy-viscosity closure that is employed in LES of weakly compressible turbulence and a term that is non-linear in the Jacobian matrix of the velocity. Using this mixed closure, the SGS <b>turbulence</b> <b>energy</b> model is validated in LES of turbulence with stochastic forcing. It is found that the SGS model satisfies several important requirements: 1. The mean SGS <b>turbulence</b> <b>energy</b> follows a power law for varying grid scale. 2. The root mean square (RMS) Mach number of the unresolved velocity fluctuations is proportional to the RMS Mach number of the resolved turbulence, independent of the forcing. 3. The rate of dissipation and the <b>turbulence</b> <b>energy</b> flux are constant. Moreover, we discuss difficulties with direct estimates of the turbulent pressure and the dissipation rate on the basis of resolved flow quantities that have recently been proposed. In combination with the energy injection by stellar feedback and other unresolved processes, the proposed SGS model is applicable to a variety of problems in computational astrophysics. Computing the SGS <b>turbulence</b> <b>energy,</b> the treatment of star formation and stellar feedback in galaxy simulations can be improved. Further, we expect that the turbulent pressure on the grid scale affects the stability of gas against gravitational collapse. Comment: 19 pages, 16 figures, submitted to A&...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. To achieve {{transient}} flow characteristics at exit of nozzle orifice on {{gasoline direct injection}} engine, two phase Euler-Euler schemes was used to simulate the internal flow of the swirl nozzle. Different flow characteristics were calculated in the simulation. Different kinds of nozzle configuration were studied. Cavitaion and swirl flow occured in the nozzles. Injection hole configuration matters more than area variation of swirl tangential slot to discharge coefficient of the studied nozzle. Discharge coefficient changes a little along the injection hole length. The area of the swirl tangrntial slot plays an important throttling action in nozzle internal flow. Smaller area of swirl tangential slot generates larger degree cavitation but smaller mean injection velocity. <b>Turbulence</b> kinetic <b>energy</b> changes with the time of cavitation and swirl field occurring and the nozzle configuration.

Near the sea surface, the rate of viscous dissipation of <b>turbulence</b> kinetic <b>energy,</b> ϵ, exhibited a range of behaviors under different forcing conditions. Sometimes, ϵ was closely balanced by the wind stress production of <b>turbulence</b> kinetic <b>energy.</b> At other times, ϵ was greatly enhanced relative to wind stress production and exhibited an exponential depth deny. In these instances, simple scaling laws predicted for turbulence near a solid surface severely underestimate turbulent mixing near the ocean surface.
