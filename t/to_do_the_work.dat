5|$|As {{part of a}} {{drive to}} beautify the coinage, five {{denominations}} of US coins had received new designs between 1907 and 1909. In 1911, Taft administration officials decided to replace Charles E. Barber's Liberty Head design for the nickel, and commissioned Fraser <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>work.</b> They were impressed by Fraser's designs showing a Native American and an American bison. The designs were approved in 1912, but were delayed several months because of objections from the Hobbs Manufacturing Company, which made mechanisms to detect slugs in nickel-operated machines. The company was not satisfied by changes made in the coin by Fraser, and in February 1913, Treasury Secretary Franklin MacVeagh decided to issue the coins despite the objections.|$|E
5|$|Giampaolo Caruso led {{the group}} into Ans and towards the {{climb to the}} finish. At {{the foot of the}} climb, Daniel Moreno, Caruso's teammate, {{attacked}} and built a small gap ahead of the group. The group did not initially chase him, as all the other riders looked for Valverde <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>work.</b> Eventually Valverde did start to chase Moreno and caught him at the final bend. He opened his sprint from a long way out, with Joaquim Rodríguez (Katusha) right behind him. Rodríguez slowed as they approached the line, however, and Valverde took the victory. Julian Alaphilippe came around Rodríguez in the final metres to take second place.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, Speer {{surrendered}} {{his position}} as Tessenow's assistant and moved to Mannheim. His father gave him a job as manager of the elder Speer's properties. In July1932, the Speers visited Berlin to help out the Party prior to the Reichstag elections. While they were there, his friend, Nazi Party official Karl Hanke, recommended the young architect to Joseph Goebbels to help renovate the Party's Berlin headquarters. Speer agreed <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>work.</b> When the commission was completed, Speer returned to Mannheim and remained there as Hitler took office in January1933.|$|E

5|$|On 10 January, Seeadler {{departed}} for Bombay, where her boilers were repaired {{in a major}} overhaul. Workers from the Kaiserliche Werft in Kiel were sent <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>work.</b> Seeadler was back in service by May, and on 18 May she departed Bombay, arriving in East Africa on 31 May. Cormoran was meanwhile detached from East Africa and allowed to continue to the Pacific. The {{rest of the year}} was uneventful for Seeadler, though she became briefly involved in political developments in East Africa. The British Jameson Raid into the Transvaal in December 1895 threatened some 15,000 German nationals in the Transvaal, along with the investment of 500million gold marks in the country. The German governor considered ordering Seeadler to contribute a landing force to protect the German consul in Pretoria, the capital of the Transvaal, but the defeat of the Jameson Raid rendered the plan redundant. Seeadler nevertheless remained in East Africa while tensions cooled. In mid-February 1896, she went to Cape Town for her yearly overhaul.|$|E
5|$|What Lawrence {{needed to}} develop the idea was capable {{graduate}} students <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>work.</b> Edlefsen left to take up an assistant professorship in September 1930, and Lawrence replaced him with David H. Sloan and M. Stanley Livingston, who he set to work on developing Widerøe's accelerator and Edlefsen's cyclotron, respectively. Both had their own financial support. Both designs proved practical, and by May 1931, Sloan's linear accelerator was able to accelerate ions to 1 MeV. Livingston had a greater technical challenge, but when he applied 1,800V to his 11-inch cyclotron on January 2, 1931, he got 80,000-electron volt protons spinning around. A week later, he had 1.22 MeV with 3,000 V, more than enough for his PhD thesis on its construction.|$|E
5|$|Both Acts were {{unusual in}} that they gave the bodies powers to borrow money, but did not create the {{companies}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>work.</b> Nor were the financial arrangements clearly laid down, and both groups resorted to issuing shares to fund the improvements, although they were not actually empowered to do so. In October 1730, the two groups decided to amalgamate, but a 1731 Act to formalise the agreement and legalise the issuing of shares was defeated because it also included powers to make further changes to the river, including the section below Barnby Dun. Finally an Act of 1733 created The Company of the Proprietors of the Navigation of the River Don, with powers {{to create a new}} cut from Bromley Sands above Rotherham to Ickles Dam. The problems presented by the river below Wilsick House, including shallows and fords at Bramwith and Stainforth, and bridges on the Dutch River that were difficult to navigate, resulted in the proprietors trying again to obtain powers to improve the lower river in 1737, but again the petition was defeated in a parliamentary committee. Work continued, and it appears that Aldwarke was the head of navigation for some years, but Rotherham was reached in 1740.|$|E

5|$|Chris befriends Lucy Robinson (Melissa Bell) and {{she asks}} him to father her child, to which Chris replies {{that he needs}} time to decide. Chris meets Nate Kinski and they arrange to go a picnic for their first date. Chris is shocked when Nate attacks a drunk guy for harassing Paige Smith (Olympia Valance), but Susan Kennedy (Jackie Woodburne) convinces him to give Nate a second chance. When Chris asks Nate to open up about {{his time in the}} army and Afghanistan, Nate gets {{physical}} with him. Nate promises that it will not happen again and asks Chris not to push him about opening up until he is ready. During Georgia and Kyle's joint hen and bucks night, Chris is punched by an unseen assailant and he hits his head. Kyle and Georgia find him and he is rushed to hospital, and placed in an induced coma. Josh later confesses to punching Chris. When Chris wakes up, he struggles to remember words and his right side is weakened. Chris is allowed leave from the hospital to attend Georgia and Kyle's wedding. After he is discharged from hospital, Nate becomes Chris's carer. Chris decides to return to work at the garage but is unable <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> and is sent home. Chris later suffers a seizure and is admitted to hospital. He is forced to quit his job as he can no longer handle the workload due to his injuries. Josh's mother, Terese (Rebekah Elmaloglou), offers Chris a job as a trainee manager at Lassiter's Hotel, which Nate persuades him to accept.|$|E
25|$|Christian {{theology}} and political thinking {{until after the}} Enlightenment considered treason and blasphemy as synonymous, as it challenged {{both the state and}} the will of God.

25|$|Early {{superheterodyne}} receivers used IFs {{as low as}} 20kHz, {{often based}} on the self-resonance of iron-cored transformers. This made them extremely susceptible to image frequency interference, but at the time, the main objective was sensitivity rather than selectivity. Using this technique, {{a small number of}} triodes could be made <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> that formerly required dozens of triodes.|$|E

In this book, 21 of his watercolor illustrations lavished the text. His commissioned work for books such as this or for the writings of other authors, oddly, seem to be {{some of his most}} imaginatively inspired watercolor. In The Orange-Robed Boy, Kingman's influence of a free and open composition sometimes appeared, but if the text was in Burmese and the theme he was illustrating was of a strong traditional bent, he might reach back to the techniques of Traditional painting <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>works.</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{division}} of labor remade. The pin factory organization of labor describes the organization of work as if labor were a machine. But we can make machines to do this work. We should then innovate in those areas where we don't yet {{know how to make}} the machine <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>work.</b> Production should be one of collective learning and permanent innovation.|$|E
25|$|Ore {{processing}} was {{the work}} of independent Washing Masters, who took a bargain {{for a year or more}} to carry out a particular job, and were paid a price per ton of lead smelted. They then hired boys and young men <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>work.</b> This system lasted until 1855, when the last of the washing contracts were made. After that the company took control of the operation and paid weekly wages to the washers. Contracts continued for smelting as well as carting and smith work.|$|E
25|$|Ariel {{is widely}} viewed as a male character, {{although}} this view has wavered over the years, especially in the Restoration, when, for the most part, women played the role. Ariel has also been involved, though lightly, {{in the debate over}} the colonialist nature of the play, as scholars have tried to determine how he compares to the more rebellious Caliban in terms of service to the European Prospero. Whenever Caliban desired not to obey the command of Prospero, Ariel would persuade him <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>work,</b> either by using magical powers or by using force.|$|E

25|$|In 1907 the Archaeological Institute of America gave Hewett an {{additional}} platform, by establishing the School of American Archaeology, later the School of American Research, in Santa Fe. Hewett's friend Alice Fletcher, {{by then the}} doyenne of American archaeology, {{was one of the}} prime backers of the School; Hewett became its first director, a position he would hold until his death in 1946. The School would provide Hewett not only with a mouthpiece, but also a base for his increasingly professional (if still controversial) research activities and students and collaborators <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} {{hoped that}} private shipyards {{would be able}} to build the ships on a fixed-cost basis. This {{turned out not to be}} the case; the shipbuilding industry was less enthusiastic than anticipated. Moreover, none of the shipyards being considered for the work had the facilities to build the fast ferries. BC Ferries had no choice but <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> itself on a cost-plus basis. It would have to act as project manager and assume the risk of the fast ferries. Catamaran Ferries International (CFI), a wholly owned subsidiary of BC Ferries, was incorporated in March 1996 to carry out the work and construction started later that year.|$|E
25|$|The popes, {{and also}} the Senate when it coined money, appear to have used the {{imperial}} mint of Rome, which was on {{the slope of the}} Campidoglio, not far from the Arch of Septimius Severus; but in the fifteenth century the mint was near the bank of Santo Spirito. Finally, in 1665, Alexander VII moved it {{to the rear of the}} apse of St. Peter's. Bernini invented for it a machine <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> more rapidly, and Francesco Girardini furnished a very sensitive balance; so that the mint of Rome was technically the most perfect one of those times. In 1845 Pius IX equipped it with the most modern appliances.|$|E
