5|$|In 2010, {{the office}} of Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott {{investigated}} Trump University. No lawsuit was brought, but after exchanging communications with investigators that included requests from the investigators for customer lists and internal documents, Trump University closed its operations in the state. <b>These</b> <b>had</b> included newspaper advertising, free presentations, and three-day seminars.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, a huge {{building}} project centred around Coronation Square (named for the 1953 Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II) {{with hundreds of}} council houses built to satisfy post-war demand. The residents of many of <b>these</b> <b>had</b> moved from houses in central and east Reading that fell short of sanitation requirements of the Public Health Act 1875, were compulsorily purchased and later demolished.|$|E

5|$|The Jadovno camp site {{remained}} unexplored {{after the}} war due to {{the depth of the}} gorges where bodies were disposed of and {{the fact that some of}} <b>these</b> <b>had</b> been filled with concrete by Yugoslavia's Communist authorities. Additional sites containing the skeletal remains of camp victims were uncovered in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The battle {{had lasted}} less than 90 minutes {{and the last}} episode of the {{infantry}} fight no more than fifteen minutes. Only seven Prussian battalions had engaged with the enemy, and <b>these</b> <b>had</b> expended five to fifteen rounds per man.|$|E
5|$|The launch was {{the first}} to use a newly {{developed}} high-performance motor for the solid rocket boosters, which gave approximately 7% greater thrust, and the second-last to use the original standard-mass steel casings for the boosters. <b>These</b> <b>had</b> been replaced by a thinner case, saving some , on STS-6 and STS-7, but because of safety concerns the next two flights used the conventional cases.|$|E

5|$|Two temples {{dating to}} Late Chikanel times had masonry-walled {{superstructures}} {{that may have}} been corbel-vaulted, although this has not been proven.

5|$|With {{the rise}} of Afrikaner {{nationalism}} in South Africa during {{the early part of}} the 20th century, Scouting was viewed with suspicion by many Afrikaners because of its English roots, and rival Afrikaans organisations including the Voortrekkers were established. <b>These</b> <b>had</b> a strong social and political aim. Negotiations about an amalgamation of both movements in the years 1930 to 1936 were not successful.|$|E
5|$|After the {{presentation}} {{and discussion of}} the many proposals, a governmental commission was set up on 15 October 1910. It included Columbano Bordalo Pinheiro (painter), João Chagas (journalist), Abel Botelho (writer) and two military leaders of 1910: Ladislau Pereira and Afonso Palla. This commission ultimately chose the red-and-green of the Portuguese Republican Party, delivering an explanation based on patriotic reasons, which disguised the political significance behind the choice, as <b>these</b> <b>had</b> been the colours present on the banners of the rebellious during the republican insurrection of 31 January 1891, in Porto, and during the monarchy-overthrowing revolution, in Lisbon.|$|E
5|$|Although Morgan {{had been}} ordered to {{eradicate}} piracy from Jamaican waters, he continued his friendly relations with many privateer captains, and invested in some of their ships. Zahedieh estimates that there were 1,200 privateers operating in the Caribbean at the time, and Port Royal was their preferred destination. <b>These</b> <b>had</b> a welcome in the city if Morgan received the dues owed to him. As Morgan was {{no longer able to}} issue letters of marque to privateer captains, his brother-in-law, Robert Bindloss, directed them to the French governor of Tortuga to have a letter issued; Bindloss and Morgan received a commission for each one signed. Morgan was not entirely friendly to pirates and privateers; in 1681 he ordered an attack on Dutch buccaneer Jacob Evertson, capturing many of his crew (though Evertson escaped) and advertising the capture publicly.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the central}} and local governments kept an {{enormous}} number of records about land property in order to assess taxes, it became common practice in the Tang for literate and affluent people to create their own private documents and signed contracts. <b>These</b> <b>had</b> their own signature and that of a witness and scribe in order to prove in court (if necessary) that their claim to property was legitimate. The prototype of this actually existed since the ancient Han dynasty, while contractual language became even more common and embedded into Chinese literary culture in later dynasties.|$|E
5|$|Any German {{invasion}} of Britain {{would have to}} involve the landing of troops and equipment somewhere on the coast, and the most vulnerable areas were {{the south and east}} coasts of England. Here, Emergency Coastal Batteries were constructed to protect ports and likely landing places. They were fitted with whatever guns were available, which mainly came from naval vessels scrapped {{since the end of the}} First World War. These included 6inch (152mm), 5.5inch (140mm), 4.7inch (120mm) and 4inch (102mm) guns. <b>These</b> <b>had</b> little ammunition, sometimes as few as ten rounds apiece. At Dover, two 14inch (356mm) guns known as Winnie and Pooh were employed. There were also a few land based torpedo launching sites.|$|E
5|$|As {{members of}} the Uand U1classes, rebuilds were used mainly on mixed-traffic as well as {{secondary}} passenger duties on lines between the main routes. They were used all over the Southern Railway network, but were little-used over the steep track gradients west of Exeter. The smaller-wheeled Nclass was preferred amongst crews for the same duties, as high-speed running was rare away from the main lines in the West Country. Heavier passenger work was allocated to Bulleid's Unrebuilt Light Pacifics, which were within weight restrictions in this area. The 21 rebuilt locomotives entered British Railways service in 1948. From 1955 a few were given replacement frames at overhaul: <b>these</b> <b>had</b> a shallower curve between the front buffer beam and the smokebox.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of the Domesday Book in 1086 there were two mills in Dunster. One which was called the Lower Mill was {{on the site of the}} present mill. In the 17th century there were both malt and oats mills but by 1721 one of <b>these</b> <b>had</b> been {{converted}} to a fulling mill. The present mill, which was built around 1780 and replaced the two former mills. In 1940 a bakery was added. The mill ground corn until World War II and then animal feed until it closed in 1962.|$|E
5|$|Both {{teams had}} won the UEFA Champions League before; Manchester United had three titles, while Barcelona had two. The most recent of <b>these</b> <b>had</b> come only the season before, when Manchester United beat Chelsea on {{penalties}} in the Luzhniki Stadium in Moscow. They won the first of their European Cups in 1968, beating Benfica 4–1 at Wembley Stadium, while their second was achieved in 1999 via a last-gasp 2–1 win over Bayern Munich at Barcelona's home ground, the Camp Nou. Barcelona's first European Cup was won as recently as 1992, when they beat Sampdoria 1–0 after extra time at Wembley; their only other title came in 2006 with a 2–1 win over another English side, Arsenal. Prior to 2009, unlike Barcelona, Manchester United had never lost a European Cup final; Barcelona had lost three – in 1961, 1986 and 1994, to Benfica, Steaua București and Milan respectively.|$|E
5|$|By the 1930s <b>these</b> <b>had</b> {{fallen into}} disuse, and the locks were {{dismantled}} in 1933. The Forth and Clyde Canal closed {{at the end}} of 1962, and by the mid-1970s the Union Canal was filled in at both ends, rendered impassable by culverts in two places and run in pipes under a housing estate. The British Waterways Board (BWB) came into existence on 1 January 1963, the day the Forth and Clyde Canal was closed, with the objective of finding a broad strategy for the future of canals in the United Kingdom.|$|E
