25|$|Films about {{athletics}} are overwhelmingly {{focused on}} running events: the 1962 film <b>The</b> <b>Loneliness</b> <b>of</b> the Long Distance Runner (based {{on the book}} of the same name) explores cross country running as a means of escape. Chariots of Fire, {{perhaps one of the most}} well-known athletics films, is a fictionalised account of Eric Liddell and Harold Abrahams's chase for sprint gold medals at the 1924 Olympics. Track and field has been the subject of American films such as Personal Best (1981) and Across the Tracks (1991). Biopics are found within the genre, including Prefontaine (regarding Steve Prefontaine) and Jim Thorpe – All-American (1951) featuring Burt Lancaster as Thorpe. Documentaries are also common with examples such as 2007 film Spirit of the Marathon, which follows runners' preparations for the 2005 Chicago Marathon.|$|E
25|$|Poetry {{and cruelty}} of life were harmonically {{combined}} {{in the works}} that Vittorio De Sica wrote and directed together with screenwriter Cesare Zavattini: among them, Shoeshine (1946), The Bicycle Thief (1948) and Miracle in Milan (1951). The 1952 film Umberto D. showed a poor old man with his little dog, who must beg for alms against his dignity in <b>the</b> <b>loneliness</b> <b>of</b> the new society. This work is perhaps De Sica's masterpiece {{and one of the}} most important works in Italian cinema. It was not a commercial success and since then it has been shown on Italian television only a few times. Yet it is perhaps the most violent attack, in the apparent quietness of the action, against the rules of the new economy, the new mentality, the new values, and it embodies both a conservative and a progressive view.|$|E

In the late 1960s and early 1970s he established himself with roles in major British films including Oh! What a Lovely War (1969), Battle of Britain (1969) and The Go-Between (1971). In The Go-Between, he played the part of Lord Hugh Trimingham, for which he won a BAFTA award for Best Supporting Actor. His acting ability also {{brought him to the}} attention of director Fred Zinnemann, who was looking for an actor who was not well-known and could be believable as the assassin in the film The Day of the Jackal (1973).

Between 1964 and 1966, he starred in two series of the ABC Weekend Television/ITV production Redcap, playing the hard-nosed military policeman Sergeant John Mann.

In 1967 he appeared in the Granada TV/ITV series, Inheritance, alongside James Bolam and Michael Goodliffe, as well as appearing in TV plays such as The Talking Head and episodes of series such as Budgie, where he played against type (opposite Adam Faith) as an effeminate failed playwright with a full beard and a Welsh accent.|$|E

40|$|Background: There is a {{large body}} of {{research}} focusing on <b>the</b> experiences <b>of</b> <b>loneliness</b> <b>of</b> older adults, yet little is known about <b>the</b> <b>loneliness</b> experiences <b>of</b> older adults with lifelong disability. In this paper, the authors present some findings from a larger qualitative study on <b>the</b> <b>loneliness</b> experiences <b>of</b> older people with cerebral palsy. Method: Seven older adults with cerebral palsy participated in in-depth interviews. Analysis of the interviews identified overarching themes and recurrent topics in the data. These topics were coded and then grouped under the overarching themes. Results: Six themes were identified. All participants agreed that the themes of communication and social networks are most important when considering loneliness. In this paper, the participants' discussion of these two themes and their related topics are presented. Conclusions: The results demonstrate the need to provide support and training in communication to older people with cerebral palsy who experience communication difficulty, as well as to their communication partners. They also indicate the need for policy development to assist older adults with cerebral palsy to develop and maintain their social networks and form relationships that are rewarding and enriching. 13 page(s...|$|R

500|$|FiringSquad said Freelancers {{multiplayer}} mode encapsulated the [...] "best {{and worst}} of [...] in a nutshell": although players can move their characters anywhere, group with others for missions, and trade ships and equipment, they have very little else {{to do in the}} unchanging virtual galaxy.

[...] Furthermore, IGN thought it was meaningless to amass wealth and higher-grade equipment when they cannot be transferred to other servers.

500|$|Keable {{returned}} to the UK in 1914 {{as a result of}} illness, precipitated perhaps by the rigour of service upon which Weston insisted in Zanzibar.

Instead, he made two attempts to enlist for armed service during the First World War; ill health thwarted both, so he {{returned to}} Africa for mission work, becoming rector of three parishes (including Leribe, Basutoland), under the diocese of the Bishop of Bloemfontein. He published some ten devotional works and works on missionary practice during this time, including <b>The</b> <b>Loneliness</b> <b>of</b> Christ, and a book of verse titled Songs of the narrow way. The damaging effects of the illness he had suffered were compounded by an assault while in the field: accounts vary, with some friends recalling that Keable received a blow to the head from a [...] "powerful native", and others describing a gunshot wound to the thigh, inflicted by a (probably drunk or deranged) Mosutu.

500|$|Gaiman began {{incorporating}} {{elements of}} the Kirby Sandman series in issue No. 11 (December 1989), including the changes implemented by Roy Thomas. Joe Simon and Michael Fleisher had treated the character, who resembled a superhero, as the [...] "true" [...] Sandman. The Thomas and Gaiman stories revealed that the character's existence was a sham created by two nightmares who had escaped to a pocket of the Dreaming. Brute and Glob would later attempt this again on Sanderson Hawkins, sidekick to Wesley Dodds, the Golden Age Sandman. Gaiman gave Jed Walker a surname and made him related to several new characters. The Thomas Sandman was Hector Hall, who married the already-pregnant Fury in the Dreaming in Infinity, Inc. No. 51. It was explained that Dr. Garrett Sanford, the 1970s Simon and Kirby version of the Sandman, had gone insane from <b>the</b> <b>loneliness</b> <b>of</b> the Dream Dimension and taken his own life. Brute and Glob put the spirit of Hector Hall, which had been cast {{out of his own}} body into Sanford's body, and it eventually began to resemble Hall's. Fury, in her civilian guise as Lyta Hall was the only superhero recurring character in the series. Even at that, her powers had come to her via the Fury Tisiphone, and the Furies, under the euphemism, [...] "the Kindly Ones", a translation of [...] "Eumenides", a name they earned during the events of Aeschylus's Oresteia trilogy, are major characters in the series.|$|E
