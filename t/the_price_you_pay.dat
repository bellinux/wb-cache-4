40|$|Before the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the {{landscape}} of the individual market looked much different than it does today, particularly for those in less than perfect health. For the most part, what state you lived in determined how easily you could purchase a health plan, <b>the</b> <b>price</b> <b>you</b> would <b>pay,</b> and what the plan would cover. Rules for insurers in the individual market varied from state to state, but in most states, if you had a pre-existing condition, you could be denied coverage, pay more, or have coverage for your pre-existing condition excluded from your health plan. As Congress debates repeal of the ACA and its protections for people with pre-existing conditions, many policymakers have called for greater state flexibility in insurance regulation than currently exists under the ACA. It therefore is helpful to understand the range of consumer protections in the states before the ACA, and why the ACA included the insurance reforms it did.

30|$|Because {{often the}} goal of the {{forecast}} is focused both on accuracy and robustness, the most optimal choice for the jump-off rates must give the most accurate as well as the most robust forecast. For each country in our analysis, there was no option of the jump-off rates that guaranteed accuracy and robustness at the same time. Thus, there always has to be a trade-off between accuracy and robustness. Therefore, we recommend looking into developing a choice for the jump-off rates that is both accurate and robust. Our four recommendations for determining the best choice for the jump-off rates that give both an accurate and robust forecast are as follows: (1) Because the accuracy of the forecast decreases distinctly with the averaging of more observed years as jump-off rates, whereas the robustness of the forecast stayed approximately the same, it is preferable to use an average using as few years as possible to improve the accuracy with a robust forecast. (2) Using the observed values instead of the model values in case the model fits the data well does not improve accuracy and deteriorates the robustness. Thus, in the case the model fits well, it is best to use the model values as jump-off rates and not the observed values as is often done by force of habit. (3) The further ahead, the less accurate the forecast gets. This means that <b>the</b> relative <b>price</b> <b>you</b> <b>pay</b> for more robustness is lower for a forecast further in the future. If the forecast further in the future is of more importance than the short-term forecast, there should be a greater value attached to the robustness of the forecast, and thus the best option for the most robust forecast can be selected. (4) In line with the previous recommendations, to best unite the results for robustness and accuracy, we would recommend interpolation (see Appendix 6 for an example). Robustness is more important for the long-term forecast (for instance, from 5  years in the future) {{as a result of the}} increasing uncertainty with duration. For the first few years, accuracy would be more relevant because data for these years will be available quickly. Our recommendation would be to start with a forecast using a jump-off rate that is the most accurate in the first year. Subsequently, make a forecast that is most robust in, say, the fifth year of the forecast period. Between the two forecast, each year, more weight should be given to the most robust forecast, i.e. we recommend interpolating from the most accurate forecast to the most robust forecast. By interpolating between the two forecasts, both accuracy in the first year of the forecast and robustness of the forecast 5  years ahead is obtained.|$|R
