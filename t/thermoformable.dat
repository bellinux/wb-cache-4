5000|$|The {{most basic}} {{material}} for the forming web is polyvinyl chloride (PVC). The principal advantages of PVC are the low cost and the ease of thermoforming. The main disadvantages are the poor barrier against moisture ingress and oxygen ingress. In the case of blister packaging the PVC sheet does not contain any plasticizer and is {{sometimes referred to as}} Rigid PVC or RPVC. In the absence of plasticizers, PVC blisters offer structural rigidity and physical protection for the pharmaceutical dosage form. On the other hand, the blister cavity must remain accessible by the push-through effect and the formed web may not be too hard to collapse when pressed upon; for this reason the PVC sheet thickness is typically chosen between 200µ to 300µ depending on the cavity size and shape. Most PVC sheets for pharmaceutical blisters are 250µ or 0.250 mm in thickness. Typical values for the Water Vapor Transmission Rate (WVTR or MVTR) of a 250µ PVC film are around 3.0 g/m2/day measured at 38 °C/90% RH and the Oxygen Transmission Rate (OTR) is around 20 mL/m2/day. In order to overcome the lack of barrier properties of PVC film, it can be coated with PVDC or laminated to PCTFE or COC to increase the protective properties. Multi-layer blister films based on PVC are often used for pharmaceutical blister packaging, whereby the PVC serves as the <b>thermoformable</b> backbone of the structure. Also, the PVC layer can be colored with pigments and/or UV filters. The European Pharmacopoeia (Ph Eur) references the requirements for PVC blister packs for pharmaceutical primary packaging in the monograph EP 3.1.11 [...] "MATERIALS BASED ON NON-PLASTICISED POLY(VINYL CHLORIDE) FOR CONTAINERS FOR DRY DOSAGE FORMS FOR ORAL ADMINISTRATION". In order to be suitable for pharmaceutical blister packs, the PVC formulation also needs to comply with the US Pharmacopoeia <661>; EU food legislation; US 21.CFR and Japanese food contact requirements.|$|E
40|$|A common {{misconception}} in the thermoforming {{community is}} that, prior to conducting a thermoforming simulation, significant material testing must be completed {{to develop a}} complex visco-elastic material model.

40|$|In resin {{transfer}} molding, {{the fabrication}} of the fiber preform {{is critical to}} both part quality and production efficiency. The deformation induced by preforming introduces porosity and permeability variations which affect mold filling, and may result in defects (tears and wrinkles) in the preform. In this study we develop an experimental method for determining the formability of <b>thermoformable</b> random-fiber mats, and provide a mathematical framework for expressing the results. We characterize formability of random-fiber mats using a forming limit diagram, similar to the diagrams used for sheet metal. This diagram maps the combinations of principal stretch ratios # 1 and # 2 that cause the material to fail. The maximum load during constant-rate extension provides the failure criterion in forming limit tests. The experiments combine uniaxial and constrained tests. The uniaxial tests reveal behavior when the sample is free to contract in the lateral direction, and also helps determine the strains that cause wrinkling in the sheet. The constrained tests give data when lateral contraction is prohibited. Biaxial data is acquired by conducting a sequence of two constrained tests on a single sample, rotating the sample by 90 degrees between the tests. Forming limit data is presented for CertainTeed's U 750 <b>thermoformable</b> random-fiber mat. The results are expressed mathematically in a formability function W(# 1,# 2), in which the forming limits are incorporated through a quadratic penalty function. This type of data {{can be used in}} an ideal forming theory to determine the feasibility of forming any given shape from a random-fiber mat. # Present address: Exxon Production Research Company, Houston, Texas 77252. + To whom correspondence should be addressed.

40|$|ABSTRACT: A <b>thermoformable</b> {{thermoplastic}} composite sheet product is described. The sheet consists of aligned discontinuous reinforcing fibers in a thermoplastic resin. It is drawable to 50 % or more axial draw ratio and has mechanical properties close {{to those of}} straight continuous fiber composite sheets. Development and preservation of fiber alignment enables the achievement of high fiber volume fraction (FVF) and mechanical properties. In general, tensile modulus and strength are 90 % or better of continous fiber composites at the same FVF. Fatigue and creep properties are also comparable. This paper details the mechanical and formability characteristics of the sheets and presents various applications that show the processing advantages of this advanced composite sheet concept over straight continuous fiber or woven fabric sheets. 1...|$|E

40|$|Polymer {{composites}} {{are formed}} as random or anisotropic fibre dispersions, sheets with long fibre felted or woven fabrics and laminates of such sheets. A thermoset polymer in liquid form {{is mixed with}} the fibres and then cured. Thermoplastics must be intermingled with the fabric and the matrix phase united by melting of the thermoplastic and compaction of the composition. The composite sheets are <b>thermoformable</b> {{by virtue of the}} thermoplastic matrix phase.

These composites are less uniform than typical thermoset resin composites where fibres are wet with a liquid resin that is then solidified by chain extension and crosslinking. Typical characterisation and mechanical performance tests are available to investigate and optimise the composites. Finite element analysis (FEA) enables a theoretical approach to understanding of the structure-property relationships and confirmation of interpretation of measured properties.

40|$|The {{design and}} {{realization}} of lightweight shields to reduce radiated emissions and electromagnetic interference (EMI) with sensitive electronic apparatus and systems {{is a challenge}} for electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) engineers. Techniques that are currently used to improve the shielding performances of light materials such as plastics and composites are: the insertion of conducting meshes in the substrate [1, 2], the use of conducting additives and fillers prior to injection molding [3, 4] {{and the use of}} conducting coatings [5 - 8]. Among these techniques the use of conducting coatings allows the realization of lightweight shields. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to demonstrate that thin coatings of conducting material, having thickness of a few micrometers, can provide good shielding performances in the radio-frequency range, up to a few gigahertz.

Applications of the innovative shielding concept are in different fields, when the requirement of light weight is a stringent constraint in the design of the shields.

40|$|International audienceOne of {{the most}} {{important}} areas of research on microfluidic technologies focuses on the identification and characterisation of novel materials with enhanced properties and versatility. Here we present a fast, easy and inexpensive microstructuration method for the fabrication of novel, flexible, transparent and biocompatible microfluidic devices. Using a simple hot press, we demonstrate the rapid (30 s) production of various microfluidic prototypes embossed in a commercially available soft thermoplastic elastomer (sTPE). This styrenic block copolymer (BCP) material is as flexible as PDMS and as <b>thermoformable</b> as classical thermoplastics. It exhibits high fidelity of replication using SU- 8 and epoxy master molds in a highly convenient low-isobar (0. 4 bar) and iso-thermal process. Microfluidic devices can then be easily sealed using either a simple hot plate or even a room-temperature assembly, allowing them to sustain liquid pressures of 2 and 0. 6 bar, respectively. The excellent sorption and biocompatibility properties of the microchips were validated via a standard rhodamine dye assay as well as a sensitive yeast cell-based assay. The morphology and composition of the surface area after plasma treatment for hydrophilization purposes are stable and show constant and homogenous distribution of block nanodomains (similar to 22 degrees after 4 days). These domains, which are evenly distributed on the nanoscale, therefore account for the uniform and convenient surface of a "microfluidic scale device".

40|$|As {{composites}} gain wider {{acceptance in}} {{all sectors of}} the economy, new methodologies must be developed to increase their cost effectiveness in manufacturing. The neoteric Resin Infusion between Double Flexible Tooling (RIDFT) process is undergoing modifications to improve its cost-effectiveness by developing methodologies for in-mold coating and the incorporation of UV curing. In-mold coating is desired by the composites industry since it eliminates the current paint process, which is not only laborious and time consuming, but expensive, and presents safety issues. Two methodologies (paint films and coinfusion) for implementing in-mold coating were investigated. It was demonstrated that <b>thermoformable</b> paint films {{could be used to}} produce coated RIDFTed components. Coinfusion was also successfully implemented. This work also investigated the feasibility of designing and incorporating a Cure on Demand system into the RIDFT process, using ultraviolet (UV) light for the curing of composite laminates.

UV-cured laminates were produced {{at a fraction of the}} time required to produce catalyst-cured laminates. Mechanical and material characterization tests were performed on each of the UV-cured laminates produced. The results were referenced against those obtained for laminates produced using a catalyst curing system to determine their overall quality.

By using special <b>thermoformable</b> polymer films with anchored biomolecules micro structured scaffolds, e. g. curved and µ-patterned substrates, can be fabricated. Here, we present a novel strategy for the fabrication of µ-patterned scaffolds based on the “Substrate Modification and Replication by Thermoforming” (SMART) technology: The surface of a poly lactic acid membrane, having a low forming temperature of 60 °C and being initially very cell attractive, was coated with a photopatterned layer of poly(L-lysine) (PLL) and hyaluronic acid (VAHyal) to gain spatial control over cell adhesion. Subsequently, this modified polymer membrane was thermoformed to create an array of spherical microcavities with diameters of 300  µm for 3 D cell culture. Human hepatoma cells (HepG 2) and mouse fibroblasts (L 929) were used to demonstrate guided cell adhesion. HepG 2 cells adhered and aggregated exclusively within these cavities without attaching to the passivated surfaces between the cavities. Also L 929 cells adhering very strongly on the pristine substrate polymer were effectively patterned by the cell repellent properties of the hyaluronic acid based hydrogel. This is the first time cell adhesion was controlled by patterned functionalization of a polymeric substrate with UV curable PLL-VAHyal in thermoformed 3 D microstructures...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to systematically investigate strategies to endow fiber-based materials with toughness and formability. Bio-based polymers and green treatments were applied to develop 3 D packaging structures. Formability, the material's ability for three-dimensional shaping, was achieved by plastic deformations in paper structures that were defect-free in terms of appearance and functionality. A set of methods to improve paper toughness was explored, including: (a) combined mechanical treatment of fibers in aqueous dispersions of high- and low-solids content, (b) in-plane compression of paper webs followed by unrestrained drying and (c) chemical modification of fiber joints by protein spraying. The mechanical treatment of fiber suspensions at elevated temperature and high solids content induced permanent fiber deformations, including kinks and curls, which {{are associated with the}} formation of microcompressions and dislocations. In turn, they increased the extensibility but compromised the axial stiffness of single fibers. Simultaneously, shrinkage of fibers and paper webs were promoted. In contrast, the low-consistency treatment straightened the fibers while their deformations were partly preserved. Fiber bonding was promoted by fibrillation. The application of gelatin affected the strength of fiber joints and improved their deformation ability, making strong fiber webs. The drying shrinkage was also increased. The fiber network was subjected to in-plane compressive treatment and drying shrinkage, which led to fiber buckling and network compression. The role of proteins as compatibilizers and eco-friendly dispersants in composites comprising cellulose nanofibrils (CNF) and <b>thermoformable</b> polylactide (PLA) was also investigated. The combination of mechanical and protein treatment of fibers and their structures improved paper extensibility, from 5 % to 29 %. Moreover, tray-like shapes were possible with a level of out-of-plane deformation that has not been recorded before for thermoforming with a fixed blank. Overall, this thesis provides fundamental and practical knowledge about the role of several factors contributing to paper toughness and formability. The suggested modification strategies to improve paper toughness are compatible with modern papermaking and conversion processes and can be implemented easily and economically...|$|E
