5|$|After {{the first}} four episodes of Supernatural aired in 2005, the WB decided {{to pick up the}} series for a full season of 22episodes. During <b>those</b> <b>first</b> episodes, the series was ranked third in males aged 18–34 and 12–34. It also posted an {{increase}} of 73% in males aged 18–49 from the year before, although it only gained 4% in total viewers, and retained 91% of viewers from its lead-in, Gilmore Girls. Supernaturals first season averaged about 3.81million American viewers. According to Special Forces Soldier Master Sergeant Kevin Wise at a 2007 Supernatural convention, the DVDs most requested by armed forces personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan were the first two seasons of the series.|$|E

Shut up, watch and listen. For me there were a number of the 'old and bold' who fitted that requirement. It wasn't until later in my service that I learned that most of them, as newly 'badged' members to a squadron, had picked Lofty.|$|E
5|$|Cleveland {{finished}} the 1947 {{season with a}} 12–1–1 win-loss-tie record and beat the New York Yankees to win its second straight AAFC championship. While the team was successful in <b>those</b> <b>first</b> two years of existence, head coach Paul Brown made numerous roster changes before the 1948 season. He brought in linebacker Alex Agase and defensive tackle Chubby Grigg via a trade with the Chicago Rockets. Tommy James, a defensive back who stayed with the team through the 1955 season, came from the National Football League's Detroit Lions. Defensive back Warren Lahr also joined the team but did not play in 1948 after breaking a leg in the preseason.|$|E

5|$|Construction of {{the station}} was {{complicated}} {{by the need to}} keep the line open: trains ferrying materials were unable to stay on-site for long, and frequently had to switch from one track to the other, necessitating trips to nearby Montpelier railway station, where the nearest crossover points were located. The station finally opened on 12 April 1897. The first train was the 7am service: 94 tickets were issued to Clifton Down, and an estimated 550 passengers bought tickets from the station the same day. Some local writers were sceptical, claiming that many of <b>those</b> <b>first</b> day passengers were not new passengers, but would previously have travelled from Montpelier or Clifton Down. Construction took nine months, and cost £2,000.|$|E
5|$|Since cats were venerated {{in ancient}} Egypt, they were {{commonly}} {{believed to have}} been domesticated there, but there may have been instances of domestication as early as the Neolithic from around 9,500 years ago (7,500 BC). A genetic study in 2007 concluded that all domestic cats are descended from Near Eastern wildcats, having diverged around 8,000 BC in the Middle East. A 2016 study found that leopard cats were undergoing domestication independently in China around 5,500 BC, though this line of partially domesticated cats leaves no trace in the domesticated populations of today. A 2017 study confirmed that domestic cats are descendants of <b>those</b> <b>first</b> domesticated by farmers in the Near East around 9,000 years ago.|$|E
5|$|Suggestions {{have been}} made that wings may have evolved {{initially}} for sailing {{on the surface of}} water as seen in some stoneflies. An alternative idea is that it drives from directed aerial gliding descent—a preflight phenomena found in some apterygote, a wingless sister taxa to the winged insects. The earliest fliers were similar to dragonflies with two sets of wings, direct flight muscles, and no ability to fold their wings over their abdomens. Most insects today, which evolved from <b>those</b> <b>first</b> fliers, have simplified to either one pair of wings or two pairs functioning as a single pair and using a system of indirect flight muscles.|$|E

40|$|In Germany {{the life}} {{satisfaction}} of <b>those</b> in <b>first</b> marriages traces the following average course. Starting from a baseline of life satisfaction in noncohabiting years {{one or more}} years prior to marriage, those who cohabit prior to marriage have an increase in life satisfaction significantly above the baseline. In the year of marriage and that immediately following, the life satisfaction of <b>those</b> in <b>first</b> marriages, prior cohabitors and noncohabitors combined, increases to a value even further above the baseline, significantly higher than for premarital cohabitors. Thereafter, life satisfaction of <b>those</b> in <b>first</b> marriages drops, but remains significantly above the baseline, {{at the same level}} as for premarital cohabitors. Compared with the population generally, <b>those</b> in <b>first</b> marriages are selective with regard to a number of socioeconomic characteristics, but not in regard to personality traits. <b>Those</b> whose <b>first</b> marriage ends in separation or divorce have a life satisfaction trajectory in the years before and during marriage not significantly different from that described above, but separation or divorce reduces this group’s life satisfaction to the original baseline value. This group differs significantly from the first marriage population as a whole in its selectivity – lower socioeconomic status and personality traits less conducive to marriage. The roots of prospective dissolution thus apparently lie in this group’s distinctive socioeconomic and personality traits, and not in a disparate course of life satisfaction {{in the first years of}} marriage.

The Braves concluded the series by surrendering four homers in a 13-4 loss to the Giants.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of Elizabeth's reign Bourne was kept away from London by illness and official duties, and he is only mentioned once as present in the Parliament.

Although Queen Elizabeth expressed herself content with his service, on his refusal to take the Oath of Supremacy, which four Somerset justices were commissioned on 18 October 1559 to administer, his deprivation of office quickly followed.|$|E
25|$|Sultan Selim III (reigned 1789–1807) had {{recognized}} the need to reform and modernize the Ottoman Empire, specifically the military, along European lines to ensure that his state could compete.

Consequently, Selim III was deposed and ultimately killed in 1808.

25|$|Those nations {{who managed}} to {{maintain}} their ownership of good lands often farmed successfully. Indigenous people living near the Cowichan and Fraser rivers, and those from Saskatchewan managed to produce good harvests. Since 1881, <b>those</b> <b>First</b> Nations {{people living in the}} prairie provinces required permits from Indian Agents to sell any of their produce. Later the government created a pass system in the old Northwest Territories that required indigenous people to seek written permission from an Indian Agent before leaving their reserves for any length of time. Indigenous people regularly defied those laws, as well as bans on Sun Dances and potlatches, in an attempt to practice their culture.|$|E

In fact, Jenkins' body was retrieved from an area near the aft torpedo tube on March 24. It was sent home to his family in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The newspapers often got names wrong, reporting that an Edison or Tennis was among the dead (when no persons with <b>those</b> <b>first</b> or last names were among the crew).|$|E

Other sorties were flown over Communist China, the RB-57D's operational ceiling being well above that of Chinese MiG-15s. The Eielson-based aircraft conducted ELINT around the Kamchatka Peninsula of the Soviet Union. On 15 Dec 1956 three aircraft overflew Vladivostok.|$|E
