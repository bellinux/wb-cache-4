That is why we consider the study as being useful to managers, members, shareholders, and all business partners to form the economic decisions. The purpose of this financial analysis is to examine critically the accounting and financial information ofered by the companies to assess their performance and their financial position (Laurence Le Gallo). The financial position of firms is assessed based on the financial structure and financial balance. In a same time the financial balance is approached from a static perspective based on the: net situation, working capital, necessary of working capital, net treasury. The present analyses deals with financial balance in a static manner based on these four indicators listed. The sources of data for the analysis of financial balance are offered mainly in the financial statement. This document has been used data from a company that is engaged in the carriage of goods. Analysis was made over a period of five years. The present analysis showed that financial balance is influenced by the way that <b>the</b> <b>shareholders</b> <b>loans</b> to <b>the</b> company are treated by including them in long-term debt or short-term.

40|$|Using a 1977 {{article by}} Robert Clark as the {{starting}} point, this article attempts to shed {{new light on the}} question of whether and when <b>shareholder</b> <b>loans</b> to her company should be either equitably subordinated or, as courts have done in a few recent cases, recharacterized as equity. In its emphasis on the particular issue of <b>shareholder</b> <b>loans,</b> <b>the</b> article has a narrower compass than Clark’s article, which uses a four-part typology to explore the relationship among fraudulent conveyance law, equitable subordination, veil piercing and dividend restrictions. But the article also expands Clark’s analysis in several respects. The most important adjustment involves the general Nonhindrance ideal, which we use to identify a crucially important form of interference with the rights of creditors that Clark does not himself consider directly. Part 1 of the article very briefly describes the 1939 Supreme Court case that served as a well-spring for equitable subordination doctrine in general, and for subordination of <b>shareholder</b> <b>loans</b> in particular. Part 2 then focuses on a series of recent decisions that have wrestled with <b>the</b> question whether <b>shareholder</b> <b>loans</b> should be recharacterized as equity contributions. Recharacterization doctrine is closely related to equitable subordination, but most courts view it as a separate development. Part 2 suggests that much of the confusion in the cases could be eliminated by disentangling two issues, whether the status of a loan is ambiguous (which raises issues of Truth, in terms of Clark’s typology) and whether it was likely to destroy value that would otherwise go to creditors (the Nonhindrance concern); and by distinguishing bankruptcy recharacterization from the tax characterization cases that seem to have spawned the new doctrine. Part 3 then concludes by briefly considering the German and Austrian approaches to these same issues, which focus on capitalization and creditworthiness. The most important, and initially counterintuitive, implication comes in Part 2 : whereas US courts have treated security interests as a badge of legitimacy in assessing <b>shareholder</b> <b>loans,</b> secured loans are actually the most worrisome form of shareholder investment. These security interests, we argue, should be disallowed...|$|R

40|$|LL. M. (Corporate Law) Jurisdictions employ several legal {{methods to}} {{regulate}} <b>loans</b> made by <b>shareholders</b> to companies. This dissertation explores the legal mechanisms employed by Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom {{as well as}} Australia that align to {{the recommendations of the}} United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) in respect of <b>shareholder</b> <b>loans</b> and seeks to answer the question whether South Africa should adopt similar mechanisms. German law complies fully with the UNCITRAL recommendations by providing for the automatic subordination of shareholder claims in respect of loans as well as the avoidance of repayments and security interests made and registered within a certain period of the commencement of insolvency proceedings. German law also contains avoidance provisions specific to transactions between the debtor and a shareholder that cause detriment to a third-party creditor and general avoidance provisions which provide for certain presumptions to apply in the case of transactions concluded between the company and a <b>shareholder.</b> In <b>the</b> United States the doctrine of equitable subordination is legislated and applies in the event that the debtor is thinly-capitalised and mismanaged and legislative provision is made for the avoidance of preference transactions concluded between a creditor and a debtor, which provide for a longer avoidance period {{in the case of a}} transaction concluded with a shareholder. In addition to full legislative compliance with the UNCITRAL recommendation relating to <b>shareholder</b> transactions, <b>the</b> wide powers given to the courts to uphold bankruptcy legislation is codified and led to the development of the doctrine of recharacterization, which entails <b>shareholder</b> <b>loans</b> being treated as equity contributions in certain circumstances. The United Kingdom does not contain legal provisions relating to <b>the</b> subordination of <b>shareholder</b> claims and thus does not comply fully with the UNCITRAL recommendations relating to <b>shareholder</b> <b>loans.</b> However, it does provide specifically for a longer avoidance period in respect of preference transactions involving shareholders and certain presumptions to be applied in the case of transactions concluded between the debtor company and a shareholder...|$|R

40|$|Corporate {{directors}} have a fiduciary duty {{to make decisions}} {{in the best interests}} of <b>the</b> <b>shareholders.</b> This aspect of fiduciary duty is often called <b>the</b> <b>shareholder</b> primacy norm. Legal scholars generally assume that <b>the</b> <b>shareholder</b> primacy norm is a major factor considered by boards of directors of publicly traded corporations in making ordinary business decisions and that changing <b>the</b> <b>shareholder</b> primacy norm would have an effect on the substance of those decisions. This Article challenges this view and argues that <b>the</b> <b>shareholder</b> primacy norm was never equipped to mediate conflicts between shareholders and nonshareholder constituencies of a corporation. The origins and development of <b>the</b> <b>shareholder</b> primacy norm suggest that it was introduced into corporate law to perform a much different and somewhat surprising function: <b>the</b> <b>shareholder</b> primacy norm was first used by courts to resolve disputes among majority and minority shareholders, and over time this use of <b>the</b> <b>shareholder</b> primacy norm evolved into the modern doctrine of minority oppression. This application of <b>the</b> <b>shareholder</b> primacy norm seems incongruous today because minority oppression cases involve conflicts among shareholders, not conflicts between shareholders and nonshareholders. Nevertheless, when early courts employed rules requiring directors to act in the interests of all <b>shareholders</b> (not just <b>the</b> majority <b>shareholders),</b> they were creating <b>the</b> <b>shareholder</b> primacy norm. Once used to resolve minority oppression cases, <b>the</b> <b>shareholder</b> primacy norm easily found its way into cases involving publicly traded corporations because courts did not routinely distinguish closely held corporations from publicly traded corporations until the middle of this century. But the application of <b>the</b> <b>shareholder</b> primacy norm to the ordinary business decisions of publicly traded corporations is muted by the business judgment rule. As a result, even though <b>the</b> <b>shareholder</b> primacy norm is closely associated with debates about the social responsibility of publicly traded corporations, it 2 ̆ 7 s impact on the ordinary business decisions of such corporations is extremely limited...|$|R
