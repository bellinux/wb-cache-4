5|$|By 1951, the {{laboratory}} {{had come up}} with the Teller-Ulam design, and <b>thermonuclear</b> tests were conducted during Operation Greenhouse. Tensions between Bradbury and Edward Teller over the degree of priority given to <b>thermonuclear</b> weapons development {{led to the creation of}} a second nuclear weapons laboratory, the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|For Green Granite, Penney {{proposed}} a design based on radiation implosion and staging. There would be three stages, {{which he called}} Tom, Dick and Harry. Tom, the primary stage, would be a fission bomb. It would produce radiation to implode a secondary, Dick, another fission service. In turn, it would implode Harry, a <b>thermonuclear</b> tertiary. Henceforth, the British designers would refer to Tom, Dick and Harry rather than primary, secondary and tertiary. They still had only vague ideas about how a <b>thermonuclear</b> weapon would work, and whether one, two, or three stages would be required. Nor was there much more certainty about the boosted designs, with no agreement on whether the boosting <b>thermonuclear</b> fuel was best placed inside the hollow core, as in Orange Herald, or wrapped around it, as in Green Bamboo. Keith Roberts and John Ward studied the detonation waves in a <b>thermonuclear</b> detonation, {{but there was an}} incomplete understanding of radiation implosion.|$|E
5|$|Lithium hydride {{containing}} lithium-6 {{is used in}} <b>thermonuclear</b> weapons, {{where it}} serves as fuel for the fusion stage of the bomb.|$|E
5|$|After a {{star has}} {{finished}} generating energy through <b>thermonuclear</b> fusion, it evolves {{into a more}} compact, degenerate state. During this process {{the dimensions of the}} star are significantly reduced, which can result in a corresponding increase in angular velocity.|$|E
5|$|British {{knowledge}} of <b>thermonuclear</b> weapons {{was based on}} work done at the Los Alamos Laboratory during the war. Two British scientists, Bretscher and Fuchs, had attended the conference on the Super (as it was then called) there in April 1946, and Chadwick had written a secret report on it in May 1946. The Classic Super design was unsuccessful. Fuchs and John von Neumann had produced an ingenious alternative design, for which they filed a patent in May 1946. This was tested in the American Operation Greenhouse George test in May 1951, but was also found to be unworkable. There was also some intelligence about Joe 4 derived from its debris, which was provided to Britain under the 1948 Modus Vivendi. Penney established three megaton bomb projects at Aldermaston. Orange Herald, under Bryan Taylor, a large boosted fission weapon; Green Bamboo an interim <b>thermonuclear</b> design similar to Soviet Layer Cake used in Joe 4 and the American Alarm Clock; and Green Granite, a true <b>thermonuclear</b> design. Orange Herald {{would be the first}} British weapon to incorporate an external neutron initiator.|$|E
5|$|Carey Sublette of Nuclear Weapon Archive {{argues that}} Ulam {{came up with}} the {{radiation}} implosion compression design of <b>thermonuclear</b> weapons, but that on the other hand Teller has gotten little credit for being the first to propose fusion boosting in 1945, which is essential for miniaturization and reliability and is used in all of today's nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{imposing}} {{dimensions and}} a maximum takeoff weight of over 60,000lb (27,000kg), the F-4 has {{a top speed of}} Mach2.23 and an initial climb rate of over 41,000ft/min (210m/s). The F-4's nine external hardpoints have a capability of up to 18,650 pounds (8,480kg) of weapons, including air-to-air and air-to-surface missiles, and unguided, guided, and <b>thermonuclear</b> weapons. Like other interceptors of its day, the F-4 was designed without an internal cannon.|$|E
5|$|In {{his later}} years, Teller became {{especially}} {{known for his}} advocacy of controversial technological solutions to both military and civilian problems, including a plan to excavate an artificial harbor in Alaska using <b>thermonuclear</b> explosive in what was called Project Chariot. He was a vigorous advocate of Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.|$|E
5|$|With his {{doctorate}} in hand, Agnew returned to Los Alamos as a National Research Foundation Fellow, {{and worked on}} weapons development in the Physics Division. In 1950, {{he was assigned to}} the <b>thermonuclear</b> weapons project, and was project engineer for the Castle Bravo nuclear test at Bikini Atoll in 1954. He became head of the Weapon Nuclear Engineering Division in 1964.|$|E
5|$|After the war ended, Creutz {{accepted}} {{an offer to}} come to the Carnegie Institute of Technology, where he became the head of its Physics Department and its Nuclear Research Center in 1948. In 1955 he returned to Los Alamos to evaluate its <b>thermonuclear</b> fusion program for the Atomic Energy Commission. While there he {{accepted an}} offer to become Vice President for Research and Development and the Director of its John Jay Hopkins Laboratory for Pure and Applied Science at General Atomics. Under his leadership, General Atomics developed TRIGA, a nuclear reactor for universities and laboratories.|$|E
5|$|Another key {{aspect of}} SIM Lite's mission was {{determining}} {{the upper and}} lower limits of star's masses. Today, scientists understand that there are limits to the how small or large a star can be. Objects that are too small lack the internal pressure to initiate <b>thermonuclear</b> fusion, which is what causes a star to shine. These objects are known as brown dwarfs and represent {{the lower end of the}} stellar mass scale. Stars that are too large become unstable and explode in a supernova.|$|E
5|$|In 1955 and 1956, Creutz {{spent a year}} at Los Alamos {{evaluating}} its <b>thermonuclear</b> fusion {{program for}} the Atomic Energy Commission. While there he was approached by Frederic de Hoffmann, who recruited him to join the General Atomics division of General Dynamics. He moved to La Jolla, California, as its Vice President for Research and Development, and was concurrently the Director of its John Jay Hopkins Laboratory for Pure and Applied Science from 1955 to 1967. He was {{also a member of}} the Advisory Panel on General Science at the Department of Defense from 1959 to 1963.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s Bradbury {{oversaw the}} {{development}} of <b>thermonuclear</b> weapons, although a falling out with Edward Teller over the priority given to their development {{led to the creation}} of a rival nuclear weapons laboratory, the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory. In later years, he branched out, constructing the Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility to develop the laboratory's role in nuclear science, and during the Space Race of the 1960s, the laboratory developed the Nuclear Engine for Rocket Vehicle Application (NERVA). The Bradbury Science Museum is named in his honor.|$|E
5|$|Ripley {{discovers that}} Burke sent the colonists to {{investigate}} the derelict spaceship where the Nostromo crew first encountered the eggs, believing he could become wealthy by recovering alien specimens for use as biological weapons. She threatens to expose him, but Bishop informs the group of a greater danger: The power plant was damaged by the dropship crash and will soon explode {{with the force of}} a 40-megaton <b>thermonuclear</b> weapon. He volunteers to crawl through several hundred meters of piping conduits to reach the colony's transmitter and remotely pilot the Sulacos remaining dropship to the surface.|$|E
5|$|The energy {{generation}} of the Sun is based upon <b>thermonuclear</b> fusion of hydrogen into helium. This occurs in the core region of the star using the proton–proton chain reaction process. Because there is no convection in the solar core, the helium concentration builds up in that region without being distributed throughout the star. The temperature {{at the core of}} the Sun is too low for nuclear fusion of helium atoms through the triple-alpha process, so these atoms do not contribute to the net {{energy generation}} that is needed to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium of the Sun.|$|E
5|$|Whether the {{information}} Fuchs passed {{relating to the}} hydrogen bomb would have been useful is still debated. Most scholars agree with Hans Bethe's 1952 assessment, which concluded {{that by the time}} Fuchs left the <b>thermonuclear</b> program in mid-1946, too little was known about the mechanism of the hydrogen bomb for his information to be useful to the Soviet Union. The successful Teller-Ulam design was not devised until 1951. Soviet physicists later noted that they could see as well as the Americans eventually did that the early designs by Fuchs and Edward Teller were useless.|$|E
5|$|With the {{discovery}} {{during the latter}} half of the 20th century of more objects within the Solar System and large objects around other stars, disputes arose over what should constitute a planet. There were particular disagreements over whether an object should be considered a planet if it was part of a distinct population such as a belt, or if it was large enough to generate energy by the <b>thermonuclear</b> fusion of deuterium.|$|E
5|$|A {{white dwarf}} star in a close binary system can {{accumulate}} material from its companion until it ignites and blows off in a <b>thermonuclear</b> explosion, known as a nova. These stars generally brighten by 7 to 16 magnitudes. Nova Circini 1926, also known as X Circini, was observed at magnitude 6.5 on 3 September 1926, before fading and fluctuating between magnitudes 11.7 and 12.5, during 1928, and magnitude 13, in 1929. Nova Circini 1995 (BY Circini) reached an maximum apparent magnitude of 7.2 in January 1995. BW Circini is a low mass X-ray binary system, comprising a black hole of around 8 solar masses and a yellow G0III-G5III subgiant star. X-ray outbursts were recorded in 1987 and 1997, and possibly 1971–72.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Szilard {{switched}} to biology. He invented the chemostat, discovered feedback inhibition, and {{was involved in}} the first cloning of a human cell. He publicly sounded the alarm against the possible development of salted <b>thermonuclear</b> bombs, a new kind of nuclear weapon that might annihilate mankind. Diagnosed with bladder cancer in 1960, he underwent treatment using a cobalt-60 treatment that he had designed. He helped found the Salk Institute for Biological Studies, where he became a resident fellow. Szilard founded Council for a Livable World in 1962 to deliver “the sweet voice of reason” about nuclear weapons to Congress, the White House, and the American public. He died in his sleep {{of a heart attack in}} 1964.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{a number}} of {{different}} drivers were considered, but the introduction of the laser a few years later provided the first obvious solution with the right combination of features. The desired energies were well beyond {{the state of the art}} in laser design, so LLNL began a laser development program in the mid-1960s to reach these levels. Each increase in energy led to new and unexpected optical phenomena that had to be overcome, but these were largely solved by the mid-1970s. Working in parallel with the laser teams, physicists studying the expected reaction using computer simulations adapted from <b>thermonuclear</b> bomb work developed a program known as LASNEX that suggested Q of 1 could be produced at much lower energy levels, in the kilojoule range, levels that the laser team were now able to deliver.|$|E
5|$|During World War II {{he worked}} on the Manhattan Project, {{developing}} the mathematical models behind the explosive lenses used in the implosion-type nuclear weapon. After the war, he served on the General Advisory Committee of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, and later as one of its commissioners. He was a consultant to a number of organizations, including the United States Air Force, the Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory, the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, and the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Along with theoretical physicist Edward Teller, mathematician Stanislaw Ulam, and others, he worked out key steps in the nuclear physics involved in <b>thermonuclear</b> reactions and the hydrogen bomb.|$|E
5|$|During {{the later}} stages of World War II, the entire Cold War, {{and to a}} lesser extent afterwards, {{uranium-235}} has been used as the fissile explosive material to produce nuclear weapons. Initially, two major types of fission bombs were built: a relatively simple device that uses uranium-235 and a more complicated mechanism that uses plutonium-239 derived from uranium-238. Later, a much more complicated and far more powerful type of fission/fusion bomb (<b>thermonuclear</b> weapon) was built, that uses a plutonium-based device to cause a mixture of tritium and deuterium to undergo nuclear fusion. Such bombs are jacketed in a non-fissile (unenriched) uranium case, and they derive more than half their power from the fission of this material by fast neutrons from the nuclear fusion process.|$|E
5|$|Epsilon Eridani's K-type {{classification}} {{indicates that}} the spectrum has relatively weak absorption lines from absorption by hydrogen (Balmer lines) but strong lines of neutral atoms and singly ionized calcium (Ca II). The luminosity class V (dwarf) is assigned to stars that are undergoing <b>thermonuclear</b> fusion of hydrogen in their core. For a K-type main-sequence star, this fusion {{is dominated by the}} proton–proton chain reaction, in which a series of reactions effectively combines four hydrogen nuclei to form a helium nucleus. The energy released by fusion is transported outward from the core through radiation, which results in no net motion of the surrounding plasma. Outside of this region, in the envelope, energy is carried to the photosphere by plasma convection, where it then radiates into space.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{detonation}} of {{the first}} Soviet fission bomb in August 1949, Fermi, along with Isidor Rabi, wrote a strongly worded report for the committee, opposing {{the development of a}} hydrogen bomb on moral and technical grounds. Nonetheless, Fermi continued to participate in work on the hydrogen bomb at Los Alamos as a consultant. Along with Stanislaw Ulam, he calculated that not only would the amount of tritium needed for Teller's model of a <b>thermonuclear</b> weapon be prohibitive, but a fusion reaction could still not be assured to propagate even with this large quantity of tritium. Fermi was among the scientists who testified on Oppenheimer's behalf at the Oppenheimer security hearing in 1954 that resulted in denial of Oppenheimer's security clearance.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Second World War, Fred Hoyle worked on the problem of how the various observed elements in the universe were produced. In 1946 he proposed that a massive star could generate the necessary <b>thermonuclear</b> reactions, and the nuclear reactions of heavy elements were responsible for the removal of energy necessary for a gravitational collapse to occur. The collapsing star became rotationally unstable, and produced an explosive expulsion of elements that were distributed into interstellar space. The concept that rapid nuclear fusion was the source of energy for a supernova explosion was developed by Hoyle and William Fowler during the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Loper {{returned}} to the United States to become Chief of the Joint Photo and Survey Section of the Joint Chiefs of Staff's Joint Intelligence Group in 1948. The next year he was appointed as an Army member of the Military Liaison Committee of the United States Atomic Energy Commission. He wrote a report which {{became known as the}} Loper Memorandum, which was influential in the decision to develop <b>thermonuclear</b> weapons. He was Deputy Commander of Joint Task Force 3, which was responsible for the conduct the Operation Greenhouse nuclear tests in the Pacific. In 1951 became Chief of the Armed Forces Special Weapons Project, but was forced to retire after he suffered a heart attack in 1953. He subsequently served as Chairman of the Military Liaison Committee from 2 August 1954 to 14 July 1961.|$|E
5|$|Marburger's {{tenure as}} Director {{was the longest}} {{in the history of}} that post. After the September 11 attacks, he helped to {{establish}} the DHS Directorate for Science and Technology within the new Department of Homeland Security. He has been called a central player opposing new restrictions of international scientific exchanges of people and ideas after the attacks. He later was responsible for reorienting the nation's space policy after the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster, and played an important part in the nation's re-entry into the International <b>Thermonuclear</b> Experimental Reactor program. Marburger was also known for his support of the emerging field of science of science policy, which seeks to analyze how science policy decisions affects a nation's ability to produce and benefit from innovation.|$|E
5|$|NASA has speculated on the {{feasibility}} of mining the atmospheres of the outer planets, particularly for helium-3, an isotope of helium that is rare on Earth and could {{have a very high}} value per unit mass as <b>thermonuclear</b> fuel. Factories stationed in orbit could mine the gas and deliver it to visiting craft. However, the Jovian system in general poses particular disadvantages for colonization because of the severe radiation conditions prevailing in Jupiter's magnetosphere and the planet's particularly deep gravitational well. Jupiter would deliver about 36Sv (3600rem) per day to unshielded colonists at Io and about 5.4Sv (540rems) per day to unshielded colonists at Europa, which is a decisive aspect {{due to the fact that}} already an exposure to about 0.75Sv over a period of a few days is enough to cause radiation poisoning, and about 5Sv over a few days is fatal.|$|E
5|$|Negotiations {{initially}} {{focused on}} a comprehensive ban, but this was abandoned due to technical questions surrounding the detection of underground tests and Soviet concerns over the intrusiveness of proposed verification methods. The impetus for the test ban was provided by rising public anxiety over the magnitude of nuclear tests, particularly tests of new <b>thermonuclear</b> weapons (hydrogen bombs), and the resulting nuclear fallout. A test ban was also seen {{as a means of}} slowing nuclear proliferation and the nuclear arms race. Though the PTBT did not halt proliferation or the arms race, its enactment did coincide with a substantial decline in the concentration of radioactive particles in the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|On 21 May 1956, a B-52B (52-0013) {{dropped a}} Mk-15 nuclear bomb over the Bikini Atoll {{in a test}} code-named Cherokee. It was the first air-dropped <b>thermonuclear</b> weapon. From 24 to 25 November 1956, four B-52Bs of the 93rd BW and four B-52Cs of the 42nd BW flew nonstop around the {{perimeter}} of North America in Operation Quick Kick, which covered 15,530miles (13,500nmi, 25,000km) in 31 hours, 30 minutes. SAC noted the flight time could have been reduced by 5 to 6 hours had the four inflight refuelings been done by fast jet-powered tanker aircraft rather than propeller-driven Boeing KC-97 Stratofreighters. In a demonstration of the B-52's global reach, from 16 to 18 January 1957, three B-52Bs made a non-stop flight around the world during Operation Power Flite, during which 24,325miles (21,145nmi, 39,165km) was covered in 45 hours 19 minutes (536.8 smph) with several in-flight refuelings by KC-97s.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before his}} death, {{when he was}} already quite ill, von Neumann headed the United States government's top secret ICBM committee, and it would {{sometimes}} meet in his home. Its purpose was {{to decide on the}} feasibility of building an ICBM large enough to carry a <b>thermonuclear</b> weapon. Von Neumann had long argued that while the technical obstacles were sizable, they could be overcome in time. The SM-65 Atlas passed its first fully functional test in 1959, two years after his death. The feasibility of an ICBM owed as much to improved, smaller warheads as it did to developments in rocketry, and his understanding of the former made his advice invaluable.|$|E
5|$|The {{nucleus of}} the lithium atom verges on instability, since the two stable lithium {{isotopes}} found in nature have among the lowest binding energies per nucleon of all stable nuclides. Because of its relative nuclear instability, lithium is less common {{in the solar system}} than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements even though its nuclei are very light: it is an exception to the trend that heavier nuclei are less common. For related reasons, lithium has important uses in nuclear physics. The transmutation of lithium atoms to helium in 1932 was the first fully man-made nuclear reaction, and lithium deuteride serves as a fusion fuel in staged <b>thermonuclear</b> weapons.|$|E
5|$|Under Cockcroft's direction, AERE {{took part}} in {{frontier}} fusion research in the post-war years, including the ZETA program. Sir George Paget Thomson began research in nuclear fusion at Imperial College London in 1946. This was subsequently transferred to the Associated Electrical Industries Laboratory at Aldermaston, under Allibone's direction. Research independently began at Oxford University under Peter Thonemann. In 1951, Cockcroft arranged for the Oxford group {{to be transferred to}} Harwell. Cockcroft approved the construction of ZETA (Zero Energy <b>Thermonuclear</b> Assembly) by the Thonemann's Harwell group, and the smaller Sceptre by Allibone's AEI group. James L. Tuck's group at the Los Alamos Laboratory was also researching fusion, and Cockcroft struck an agreement with the Americans that they would release their results together, which was done in 1958. Despite Cockcroft's perennial optimism that a breakthrough was imminent, fusion power remained an elusive goal.|$|E
5|$|A re-think was required. Cook had the unenviable task of {{explaining}} {{the failure to}} the government. Henceforth, he would take a tighter grip on the hydrogen bomb programme, gradually superseding Penney. The scientists and politicians considered abandoning Green Granite. The Minister of Defence, Duncan Sandys, queried Cook on the imperative to persist with <b>thermonuclear</b> designs, given that Orange Herald satisfied most military requirements, and the tests were very expensive. Cook replied that megaton-range fission bombs represented an uneconomical use of expensive fissile material; {{that they could not}} be built to produce yields of more than a megaton; and that they could not be made small enough to be carried by aircraft smaller than the V-bombers, or on missiles. Sandys was not convinced, but he authorised further tests, as did the Prime Minister, now Harold Macmillan following Eden's resignation {{in the wake of the}} Suez crisis. The earliest possible date was November 1957 unless the Operation Antler tests were cancelled; but the Foreign Office warned that a moratorium on nuclear testing might come into effect in late October.|$|E
5|$|Before {{accretion}} {{of material}} pushes a white dwarf {{close to the}} Chandrasekhar limit, accreted hydrogen-rich material on the surface may ignite in a less destructive type of <b>thermonuclear</b> explosion powered by hydrogen fusion. These surface explosions can be repeated {{as long as the}} white dwarf's core remains intact. This weaker kind of repetitive cataclysmic phenomenon is called a (classical) nova. Astronomers have also observed dwarf novae, which have smaller, more frequent luminosity peaks than the classical novae. These are thought to be caused by the release of gravitational potential energy when part of the accretion disc collapses onto the star, rather than through a release of energy due to fusion. In general, binary systems with a white dwarf accreting matter from a stellar companion are called cataclysmic variables. As well as novae and dwarf novae, several other classes of these variables are known, including polars and intermediate polars, both of which feature highly magnetic white dwarfs. Both fusion- and accretion-powered cataclysmic variables have been observed to be X-ray sources.|$|E
5|$|For {{at least}} a portion of its life, a star shines due to <b>thermonuclear</b> fusion of {{hydrogen}} into helium in its core, releasing energy that traverses the star's interior and then radiates into outer space. Almost all naturally occurring elements heavier than helium are created by stellar nucleosynthesis during the star's lifetime, and for some stars by supernova nucleosynthesis when it explodes. Near {{the end of its}} life, a star can also contain degenerate matter. Astronomers can determine the mass, age, metallicity (chemical composition), and many other properties of a star by observing its motion through space, its luminosity, and spectrum respectively. The total mass of a star is the main factor that determines its evolution and eventual fate. Other characteristics of a star, including diameter and temperature, change over its life, while the star's environment affects its rotation and movement. A plot of the temperature of many stars against their luminosities produces a plot known as a Hertzsprung–Russell diagram (H–R diagram). Plotting a particular star on that diagram allows the age and evolutionary state of that star to be determined.|$|E
