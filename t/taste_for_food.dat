It explores the question of East German tastes from two angles: West German fantasies about the inadequacies of the GDR’s food system, and East German nutritionists’ unsuccessful struggles to regulate popular tastes. In particular, it focuses on the moment when popular taste was seen as a serious problem by the GDR state—during the rise of the obesity epidemic in the 1970 s and 1980 s...|$|E

Once a generalized model is achieved, a person's tastes are brought to life through perspective-based applications, which afford the exploration of someone else's perspective through interactivity and play. The thesis describes model acquisition systems implemented for each of the five aesthetical realms. (cont.) The techniques of 'reading for affective themes' (RATE), and 'culture mining' are described, along with their enabling technologies, which are commonsense reasoning and textual affect analysis. Finally, six perspective-based applications were implemented to illuminate a range of real-world beneficiaries to person modeling-virtual mentoring, self-reflection, and deep customization. by Xinyu Hugo Liu.

40|$|Ayurveda, {{manoeuvres}} mankind to head {{a healthy}} life in order to pursue four-fold bliss. With a view to combat physical and mental annoyances, classics have explicated two-fold therapeutic modalities; langhana/depletion and brihmana/nourishing. Upavasa /fasting is one among ten depletion therapies explained. It is envisioned at all three levels of Ayurvedic therapies- rational/objectively planned, psychological, and spiritual. Fasting is reckoned to be refraining from all forms of food intake for a given period, under supervision of a qualified physician. Acharya Charaka advocates fasting in diseases of milder intensity, in those due to aama (metabolic toxin), after purificatory procedures. Fasting person should avoid beautifying oneself, day sleep, sexual acts, and feasting prior and ulterior to fasting. Fasting is contraindicated in very young, elderly, emaciated, pregnant lady, and shortly after strenuous exercise. The principle avers that fasting kindles metabolic/digestive fire which, in absence of food, brings about paachana of vitiated doshas, thereby riposting health. Sound fasting ensues proper elimination of excretory wastes, clear belch, sweat, and <b>taste</b> <b>for</b> <b>food.</b> Benefits of fasting include lucidity of sense organs, lightness of body and mind, control of diseases, and enthusiasm. Yoga Shastra describes fasting with respect to three levels of food: physical, impressions, and associations and a means to unite three bodies: astral, physical, and causal. Ayurveda thus advocates fasting depending upon the dosha, agni, vaya, kala, and bala of the individual, as a preventive as well as therapeutic modality...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to define and compare {{structures}} related to food cultures, on a so called public food school and a regular public school. We are focused on identifying food cultures and discourses of taste and distaste for specific foods among pupils on the two schools - in consequence of the food culture the students strive for. In correlation we are set on identifying dominating discourses for both the schools as institutions and the food culture which they in hand strive to achieve. Furthermore {{the objective of this}} project is to learn whether it is attempted to reproduce specific cultural structures and how this is done. By utilizing observations on Katrinedals Skole and Ørestad Skole the sub-field between the two schools is studied through a Bourdieu-inspired analysis in the search of reproductive structures in food culture. The food cultures are identified through the different capitals, emphasizing the cultural and social capitals. It is learned that “working class food” is especially popular among the students, whereas the institutions seek to civilize the pupils into a <b>taste</b> <b>for</b> <b>food</b> of higher cultural capital. In addition a health discourse is categorized in a bioscientific aspect among the teachers but aspect is different from the pupils on particularly Katrinedals Skolen as many pupils are very aware of not becoming fat. Above all the food structures, as of the institutions, are reproduced and sought implemented through symbolic violence, although it only seems to have an effect on Ørestad Skole...|$|E

40|$|Este artigo trata de algumas mudanças nos hábitos alimentares na cidade de São Paulo entre o final do século XIX e o começo do século XX. Novos restaurantes, cafés e padarias foram criados juntamente com novas exigências de higiene na produção e na venda de alimentos. Ao mesmo tempo, os costumes à mesa foram modificados de acordo com as diferenças entre homens e mulheres. Desde então, por um lado houve a invenção de uma identidade gastronômica considerada típica dos paulistanos, mas atribuída, sobretudo aos homens de prestígio na cidade. Por outro, a valorização do gosto pela gastronomia ocorreu na mesma época em que começou a aumentar a exigência de regimes para emagrecer e um maior controle do peso corporal. This paper explores {{some changes}} in the eating habits of people who lived in the city of São Paulo between {{the late nineteenth and early}} twentieth centuries. New restaurants, coffee shops and {{bakeries}} were created along with renewed hygiene requirements for the production and sale of food. At the same time habits at the table during meals were modified according to male and female differences and taste. Since that period there was on the one hand, the invention of a gastronomic style, very typical of São Paulo's citizens, although it may be referred mainly to the elite or rich classes. On the other hand, the development of a peculiar <b>taste</b> <b>for</b> <b>food</b> occurred at the same time that diets to lose weight became increasingly popular together with a higher control over body weight...|$|E

40|$|This paper uses a novel {{approach}} to investigate how food consumption in Japan may change as Japanese consumers become more westernised in their <b>tastes</b> and preferences <b>for</b> <b>food.</b> It is widely believed that as food prices in Japan fall to international levels and as Japanese consumers become more westernised in their <b>taste</b> and preferences <b>for</b> <b>food,</b> their meat consumption patterns, in particular, will approach those of western countries. The approach undertaken in this paper involves a comprehensive survey of Japanese expatriates in Los Angeles, California, regarding their food consumption habits. The findings are interesting as they {{shed some light on}} the changing nature of food consumption of accultured Japanese faced with competitive food prices. The results indicate that although household meat consumption of Japanese expatriates have changed, it remains debatable, however, that their food consumption habits will approach those of western consumers in the foreseeable future. The findings have important implications <b>for</b> <b>food</b> marketeers in Japan and elsewhere, particularly as further liberalisation of food import in that country gains momentum...|$|R

40|$|From 1880 {{until the}} {{enforcement}} of Prohibition in 1920, depictions of food consumption evolved as a newly significant genre of American art. As restaurant dining became increasingly popular and the social norms governing food changed rapidly, the dining table functioned as a space for the negotiation of class, ethnicity, and identity. In the contexts of increased immigration, shifting class structures, and tumultuous urban environments, depictions of food consumption served essential sociocultural functions. Artists and viewers utilized depictions of food to justify and internalize difference, often working to combat change. The proliferation and diversification of food imagery during this period is evidence of changing <b>tastes,</b> <b>for</b> both <b>food</b> and imagery. Depictions of restaurant dining, food labor, ethnic restaurants, and other venues <b>for</b> <b>food</b> consumption served as spaces for the negotiation of change {{and the performance of}} class, identity, and status...|$|R
