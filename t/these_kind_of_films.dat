The 1980 s were an era of major transformations: increased immigration and transit across the border, the rise of globalization, military defense build-up, the waning of the Cold War, and the US-backed wars in Central America. It was a time troubled by the recent past of the Vietnam War, Watergate, assassinations of public figures, and the revolution in social attitudes wrought by the civil rights era, feminism, gay and lesbian rights, and by the health care crises related to HIV/AIDS and Medicare/Medicaid. Hollywood border <b>films</b> are symptoms <b>of</b> this cultural morass; they stage immigrant disruptions to national identity in story lines drawn from a cinematic repertoire of “American ” good guys: vigilantes, cowboys, and buddy cops.

40|$|Polymeric isoporous {{membranes}} {{have many}} interesting properties leading to various specific applications in different fields. However, such structures also have one main drawback, namely their poor solvent stability, {{which should be}} improved to extend the range of their possible applications. Therefore, this project {{will focus on the}} enhancement of solvent stability of polymeric isoporous membranes by UV cross-linking. Stable isoporous films were obtained by creating honeycomb membranes from star polystyrene (PS) and its derivatives. The star PS was synthesized by Atom Transfer Radical Polymerization (ATRP) method and was then functionalized with methacrylate groups. The isoporous films made from these materials maintained the honeycomb structures after curing by UV light and immersion in chloroform. The crosslinking of PS under UV light exposure rather than the cross-linking of the methacrylates groups was responsible for the solvent stability of these membranes. To further investigate the effect of specific end-groups on the film stability, PEG 2 k-G 3 -PCL 30 linear-dendritic-linear hybrid polymers and its derivatives with allyl, acrylate, methacrylate end-groups were employed to cast films. Functionalized PEG 2 k-G 3 -PCL 30 linear-dendritic-linear hybrid isoporous films were cross-linked by UV-induced thiol-ene reactions and allyl reactions. However, no significant increase in the solvent stability <b>of</b> <b>these</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>films</b> was observed.

40|$|The {{results and}} discussions {{in this thesis}} are based on my studies about selfassembled thiol layers on gold, platinum, silver and copper surfaces. <b>These</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> layers are two-dimensional, one {{molecule}} thick and covalently organized at the surface. They are {{an easy way to}} modify surface properties. Self-assembly is today an intensive research field because of the promise it holds for producing new technology at nanoscale, the scale of atoms and molecules. <b>These</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>films</b> have applications for example, in the fields of physics, biology, engineering, chemistry and computer science. Compared to the extensive literature concerning self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) on gold, {{little is known about the}} structure and properties of thiolbased SAMs on other metals. In this thesis I have focused on thiol layers on gold, platinum, silver and copper substrates. These studies can be regarded as a basic study of SAMs. Nevertheless, an understanding of the physical and chemical nature of SAMs allows the correlation between atomic structure and macroscopic properties. The results can be used as a starting point for many practical applications. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and synchrotron radiation excited high resolution photoelectron spectroscopy (HR-XPS) together with time-offlight secondary ion mass spectrometry (ToF-SIMS) were applied to investigate thin organic films formed by the spontaneous adsorption of molecules on metal surfaces. Photoelectron spectroscopy was the main method used in these studies. In photoelectron spectroscopy, the sample is irradiated with photons and emitted photoelectrons are energy-analyzed. The obtained spectra give information about the atomic composition of the surface and about the chemical state of the detected elements. It is widely used in the study of thin layers and is a very powerful tool for this purpose. Some XPS results were complemented with ToF-SIMS measurements. It provides information on the chemical composition and molecular structure of the samples. Thiol (1 -Dodecanethiol, CH 3 (CH 2) 11 SH) solution was used to create SAMs on metal substrates. Uniform layers were formed on most of the studied metal surfaces. On platinum, surface aligned molecules were also detected in investigations by XPS and ToF-SIMS. The influence of radiation on the layer structure was studied, leading to the conclusion that parts of the hydrocarbon chains break off due to radiation and the rest of the layer is deformed. The results obtained showed differences depending on the substrate material. The influence of oxygen on layer formation was also studied. Thiol molecules were found to replace some of the oxygen from the metal surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Much of {{the current}} {{philosophy}} <b>of</b> <b>film</b> literature follows Walter Benjamin’s optimistic account and sees film {{as a vehicle for}} screening philosophical thought experiments, and offering new perspectives on issues that (may) have relevance to everyday life. If <b>these</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>films</b> allow for philosophical thinking, then they are like other so-called ‘high’ artworks in that they encourage social, political and economic critique of social norms. Yet, most popular films that are digested in large quantities are not of a high aesthetic or moral quality. Theorists who conceive of cinema as a means of thinking must firstly reply to the objections that most films simply do not encourage active, intelligent, imaginative participation. Prior to the publication of Deleuze’s cinema books, theorists such as T. W. Adorno feared the advent of the Hollywood Studio film as akin to Nazi propaganda. Dismissed as elitist, their concern was that mass produced and distributed artworks portrayed the depicted social norms as immutable reality. If the imagination cannot enter and engage with the messages depicted through the filmic medium, i. e. through montage or similar ‘shock’ techniques, then viewers cannot critique the moral and social status quo screened; instead, they simply receive it, and it is reinforced. If we consider how passive cinematic viewers are, voyeuristically ensconced in a darkened theatre, we can see the concern here. If only some films allow for critique of social, political and economic norms in society, and these films are attended by those viewers who are already critical viewers, then how is film more generally a tool for thinking? If we are to honestly discuss the filmic medium, we must acknowledge the Hollywood blockbusters that stifle imaginative engagement with their narratives and often depict stereotypes. I argue that we need to read Adorno alongside Benjamin, in order to acknowledge the positive as well as negative attributes <b>of</b> <b>films.</b> In doing this we see the need to focus on the critical attitude of the viewer, as well as the moral messages <b>of</b> the <b>film,</b> particularly when we consider what the majority of consumers willingly ingest uncritically. Adorno and Benjamin both offer a historical account of art whereby their aesthetics require audience reception and are linked to experience. The way art is tied to human experience and the world of sensory perception is through language. Language allows the communication of ideas or referents which convey meaning via signs that contain some <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> ‘truth’ {{in the form of a}} cognitive component that must be interpreted.

40|$|In {{addition}} to the well-known properties of diamond-like-carbon (DLC) coatings, the surface tension is a new criterion to characterize <b>these</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thin <b>films.</b> To influence the surface tension of DLC-coatings, their structure was modified by the incorporation of different elements like fluorine or silicon into the matrix of the amorphous network. Furthermore, the surface tension can be strongly influenced by the deposition parameter.

Using fluorinated hydrocarbons an almost PTFE-like coating with a surface tension of 22 mN/m was realized. Since halogenous monomers are very controversial it is wishful to find other reactive gases for modifying the surface tension on the basis of amorphous hydrocarbon layers. First investigations with silicon containing monomers point out the possibility to prepare hard coatings with a surface tension al so comparable to PTFE but with a much better micro-hardness of about 15 GPa instead of 6 GPa for fluorinated thin films or 0. 3 GPa for PTFE, respectively.

It is known that doping the DLC-matrix with fluorine causes a decrease of the surface energy to 20 mN/m. Fluorine-containing DLC-coatings with such low surface energies exhibit a similar behaviour like PTFE. The chemical instability of DLC-coatings with a high fluorine content as well as the environmental discussions about fluorine-containing hydrocarbons have shown the necessity for a new approach to <b>these</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> thin <b>films.</b> This paper presents the variation of the wettability of DLC by modifying it with silicon and the influence of oxygen in silicon-modified DLC.

When using DMF as the solvent, the efficiency is only 2. 8 %, while the efficiency of the cell obtained based on GBL can reach 10. 1 %. SEM and HRTEM are employed to study the morphology and crystallinity <b>of</b> <b>these</b> two <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> perovskite <b>films.</b> The perovskite film prepared using solvent DMF shows a rough capping layer consisting of strip-like perovskite crystals, and the filling of meso-TiO 2 is poor. Compared with DMF, the GBL perovskite film shows a better capping layer structure consisting of large perovskite domains, and the filling of meso-TiO 2 is improved as well. This great difference in capping layer morphology and meso-TiO 2 filling is one reason for the different performance. Besides morphology, different defect concentrations in <b>these</b> two <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> perovskite <b>films</b> are another crucial issue. By Combined XRD and UV techniques, the mechanisms how perovskite precipitats from DMF and GBL solutions can be disclosed. In DMF, because of its low spoiling point of 153 degrees C, most of DMF solvent volatilize by spin-coating, and an intermediate MOF structure of PbI 2 : MAI: xDMF is formed. During thermal annealing, the unstable MOF structure breaks down and a large amount of dislocations form in perovskite films, which highly restrict the charge transport. However, the spoil point of GBL (206 degrees C) is higher than that of DMF, which makes it hard to be fully volatilized by spin-coating. During the following thermal treatment, the solubility of perovskite is lowered with increasing temperature. So perovskite crystallites precipitate from the GBL first and then gradually grow up with the volatilization of the excess solvent. We finally find that coordination between the solvent and the PbI 2 plays a big role on the morphology and the crystallinity of the solution-processed perovskite film, and this is responsible for the difference of the device performance...|$|R
40|$|Some {{academic}} {{critics are}} making claims about audience reactions {{and responses to}} American Gothic literature and film {{in order to provide}} arguments about this particular genre. In presenting their predictions about audience behaviors, however, these critics typically fail to test the accuracy of their theories by providing any empirical evidence regarding the ways in which actual readers and viewers are impacted by these texts. This exploratory study, then, offers a preliminary method for measuring demonstrable audience responses to American Gothic literature and film in order to illuminate whether or not some of these critical theories about audience reactions are verifiable. More explicitly, this provisional study surveyed the reactions of a specific set of readers and viewers to this genre 2 ̆ 7 s texts by collecting empirical data about their attitudes towards <b>these</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> literary and <b>film</b> narratives. While {{the results of this study}} are not generalizable to a larger population because the survey was administered to a convenience sample, such results are still valid. Moreover, they have provided the researcher with a number of ways to refine both the research methodology and the instrument utilized to collect data in this study in order to gain a better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of behavioral claims being made by cultural critics about this particular narrative genre. ...|$|R
5000|$|However, on May 8, 2007, {{during an}} {{interview}} by NPR radio host Diane Rehm, Mr. Breathed responded to an e-mail question regarding the existence of Opus: The Last Christmas by saying, Uh, the better question is, 'Is there an Opus movie going to come out?' {{and the answer is}} 'no.' And, now I can say it's all for the better. Uh, the Weinstein brothers at Miramax tried for five years to develop an Opus movie, their first animated film, and it was, let me just say, it probably wasn't destined to be, as ... as it probably shouldn't. And the problem with developing <b>these</b> <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> movies and <b>films</b> is that inevitably they discover that a property as idiosyncratic as a comic strip doesn't translate well unless you have the confidence of bringing the creator in and factoring him into the creation of the movie. They never, never do that. Yeah, um, they just don't trust us. So without that control there probably shouldn't be an Opus movie. In a June 2007 interview with Salon.com, Breathed confirmed that the Miramax feature was [...] "dead", but left the door open for an independently produced Opus film: There'll only be a movie if I'm writing it, which will probably keep him off the big expensive screen ... probably just as well.|$|R
