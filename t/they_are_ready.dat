5|$|Birth control also {{improves}} child {{survival in}} the developing world by lengthening the time between pregnancies. In this population, outcomes are worse when a mother gets pregnant within eighteen months of a previous delivery. Delaying another pregnancy after a miscarriage however does not appear to alter risk and women are advised to attempt pregnancy in this situation whenever <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready.</b>|$|E
5|$|North of this station, two {{additional}} tracks are {{located within the}} right-of-way. One of the tracks is used to allow for Rockaway Park Shuttle trains to relay and {{to go back into}} service to the Rockaways, while the other track is called the Far Rockaway Test Track. The latter of the two tracks is used to test new subway cars to make sure that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> for acceptance into New York City Transit's fleet of subway cars.|$|E
5|$|Cats {{are ready}} to go to new homes at about 12 weeks of age, when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> to leave their mother. They can be surgically sterilized (spayed or castrated) as early as 7 weeks to limit {{unwanted}} reproduction. This surgery also prevents undesirable sex-related behavior, such as aggression, territory marking (spraying urine) in males and yowling (calling) in females. Traditionally, this surgery was performed at around six to nine months of age, but it is increasingly being performed prior to puberty, at about three to six months. In the US, about 80% of household cats are neutered.|$|E

5|$|From {{the moment}} the egg is hatched, the male {{macaroni}} penguin cares for the newly hatched chick. For about 23 to 25 days, the male protects its offspring and helps to keep it warm, since {{only a few of}} its feathers have grown in by this time. The female brings food to the chick every one to two days. When they are not being protected by the adult male penguins, the chicks form crèches to keep warm and stay protected. Once their adult feathers have grown in at about 60 to 70days, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> to go out to sea on their own.|$|E
5|$|In {{many groups}} of crustaceans, the fertilised eggs are simply {{released}} into the water column, while others have developed a number of mechanisms for {{holding on to the}} eggs until <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> to hatch. Most decapods carry the eggs attached to the pleopods, while peracarids, notostracans, anostracans, and many isopods form a brood pouch from the carapace and thoracic limbs. Female Branchiura do not carry eggs in external ovisacs but attach them in rows to rocks and other objects. Most leptostracans and krill carry the eggs between their thoracic limbs; some copepods carry their eggs in special thin-walled sacs, while others have them attached together in long, tangled strings.|$|E
5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} the Starfleet and Maquis crew of the {{starship}} USS Voyager after they were stranded in the Delta Quadrant far {{from the rest of}} the Federation. In this episode, Voyager encounters a swarm of space-borne lifeforms, which mistake the vessel for a member of their species. The presence of the aliens induce a premature mating cycle in Kes (Jennifer Lien), causing her and Neelix (Ethan Phillips) to question whether or not <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> to have children.|$|E

5|$|Selling and {{purchasing}} fresh false morels {{is legal}} in Finland, {{where it is}} highly regarded. However, the mushrooms are {{required by law to}} be accompanied with a warning that they are poisonous and legally prescribed preparation instructions. False morels are also sold prepared and canned, in which case <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> to be used. Official figures from the Finnish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry report a total amount of false morels sold in Finland of 21.9tonnes in 2006 and 32.7tonnes, noted as being above average, in 2007. In 2002, the Finnish Food Safety Authority estimated annual consumption of false morels to be hundreds of tonnes in plentiful years. In Finnish cuisine, false morels may be cooked in an omelette, or gently sautéed in butter in a saucepan, flour and milk added to make a bechamel sauce, or pie filling. Alternatively, more fluid can be added for a false morel soup. Typical condiments added for flavour include parsley, chives, dill and black pepper.|$|E
5|$|Steiner, Mitchell, and Hill feel <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> to present, {{but at the}} event, Blanchard places acid on {{the machine}} when {{everyone}} is unaware, causing an explosion. The funding for Steiner's project is ended instantly, however, Mitchell later discovers that the device has been tampered with. Steiner goes to Blanchard's house, where Lembach and Latham are having dinner. He presents the men with the evidence that his machine was deliberately tampered with, and Lembach allows him to have another chance. Steiner decides to try to project himself to Lembach's house, and, with help from his secretary, Sheila (Tracey Crisp), he begins the procedure. However, right then, Mitchell and Hill return to the laboratory.|$|E
5|$|The {{life cycle}} of D.sayi begins with copulation, which {{normally}} takes place shortly after the female has moulted, while her exoskeleton is still soft. Spawning occurs within hours or days of copulation, and the eggs are brooded on the female's pleopods (swimmerets) until <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> to hatch. Females have been found carrying eggs from April to October; {{in a study of}} crabs caught at Gloucester Point, Virginia in 1978, females were observed to carry between 686 and 14,735 eggs. The number of eggs increases with carapace width according to a power law; extrapolation of the power law suggests that the largest D.sayi females are capable of carrying over 32,000 eggs each.|$|E

5|$|Some frogs {{protect their}} {{offspring}} inside their own bodies. Both {{male and female}} pouched frogs (Assa darlingtoni) guard their eggs, which are laid on the ground. When the eggs hatch, the male lubricates his body with the jelly surrounding them and immerses himself in the egg mass. The tadpoles wriggle into skin pouches on his side, where they develop until they metamorphose into juvenile frogs. The female gastric-brooding frog (Rheobatrachus sp.) from Australia, now probably extinct, swallows her fertilized eggs, which then develop inside her stomach. She ceases to feed and stops secreting stomach acid. The tadpoles rely on the yolks of the eggs for nourishment. After six or seven weeks, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> for metamorphosis. The mother regurgitates the tiny frogs, which hop away from her mouth. The female Darwin's frog (Rhinoderma darwinii) from Chile lays up to 40 eggs on the ground, where they are guarded by the male. When the tadpoles are about to hatch, they are engulfed by the male, which carries them around inside his much-enlarged vocal sac. Here they are immersed in a frothy, viscous liquid that contains some nourishment to supplement what they obtain from the yolks of the eggs. They remain in the sac for seven to ten weeks before undergoing metamorphosis, after which they move into the male's mouth and emerge.|$|E

25|$|Female gray langurs do {{not make}} it obvious {{that they are in}} estrous. However, males are still somehow able to deduce the {{reproduction}} state of females. Females signal that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> to mate by shuddering the head, lowering the tail, and presenting their anogenital regions. Such solicitations do not always lead to copulation. When langurs mate, they are sometimes disrupted by other group members. Females have even been recorded mounting other females.|$|E

25|$|The {{offspring}} {{remain in}} the fresh water until <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready</b> to migrate to the ocean as smolts. In a few years, the surviving adults return, climb the fish ladder, and reach their spawning ground to continue the life cycle. Of the millions of young fish born, only a relative few survive to adulthood. Causes of death include natural predators, commercial and sport fishing, disease, low stream flows, poor water quality, flooding, and concentrated developments along streams and lakes.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} states are less {{integrated}} into the EU than others. In most cases this is because those states have gained an opt-out from a certain policy area.

Most states outside the Eurozone are obliged to adopt the euro when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>ready,</b> but Denmark and the United Kingdom have obtained the right to retain their own independent currencies.|$|E
