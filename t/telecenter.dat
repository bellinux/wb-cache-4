25|$|Also called e-{{volunteering}} {{or online}} volunteering, virtual volunteering is a volunteer who completes tasks, {{in whole or}} in part, offsite from the organization being assisted. They use the Internet and a home, school, <b>telecenter</b> or work computer, or other Internet-connected device, such as a PDA or smartphone. Virtual volunteering is also known as cyber service, telementoring, and teletutoring, as well as various other names. Virtual volunteering is similar to telecommuting, except that instead of online employees who are paid, these are online volunteers who are not paid.|$|E

Yet, in most developing countries where <b>telecenters</b> strive to be demand-driven, universities are seldom perceived as relevant to <b>telecenters</b> sustainability. Focusing especially on Africa and using the nomenclature of the New Partnership for African Development, this paper examines the mutual benefits that universities and <b>telecenters</b> could gain from a stronger relationship, and lays out the kinds of steps that might be taken to build a partnership.

40|$|Telecommuting is a Transportation Demand Management {{strategy}} to partially or completely replace the daily commute with telecommunication technologies. Research {{has revealed that}} telecommuting can be effectively done from special places provided for this purpose called <b>telecenters.</b> In telecenter-based telecommuting, trip lengths are shortened due {{to change in the}} location of work places. Thus suitable locations of <b>telecenters</b> {{play an important role in}} increasing the beneficial impacts of telecommuting in the transportation systems. In this research, a mathematical optimization model for finding optimal location and capacity of <b>telecenters</b> is proposed. This model is a bi-objective linear program, and a Fuzzy Goal Programming method with a preemptive structure is used to solve it. Telecommuting demand is classified into three groups of telecommuters and a priority structure that assigns the higher priority class to the closer <b>telecenters</b> is also incorporated into the model. The proposed model is implemented in a case study of finding optimal location of <b>telecenters</b> for government employees in Tehran (capital of Iran) metropolitan area. The base model is solved and its sensitivity to different parameters has been analyzed based on which, an optimal model is selected. The solution of this model is an optimal pattern for distribution of telecommuting capacities and yields the most system-wide benefits fro...|$|R
40|$|In {{different}} parts of the world, <b>telecenters</b> have been in use to make people get benefit from information and communication technologies (ICT). In those centers disadvantaged people can access internet and use electronic services offered in a broad range. And rural inhabitants are among these disadvantaged people. <b>Telecenters</b> are required in rural areas not only to make people utilize ICT but also to contribute rural development. Electronic services bring about many opportunities for citizens in both daily and professional life. With the use of them, it is possible to raise living standards and increase productivity. ICT has a special importance for rural areas as ICT-supported implementations help people in rural areas reach information, services and markets that are hardly accessible in traditional ways. Therefore, rural <b>telecenters</b> are established and electronic services meeting rural requirements are served through them. In general the biggest challenge for <b>telecenters</b> is their sustainability. In rural areas this problem gets even bigger as demand for such services are relatively lower {{because of the lack of}} awareness and motivation. Thus they need to be carefully designed to ensure their sustainability and efficient use. For sure, their sustainability mostly rests on the electronic services offered to rural inhabitants through these centers. However, to ensure efficient use of them and also to serve everyone in the area, their location, number and capacity gain utmost importance, too. Regarding the low demand and the difficulty to sustain <b>telecenters</b> in rural areas, the best approach is to establish those centers in only select hub settlements to be reached easily from the villages in close vicinity. In this study, optimization methods were used to determine the location of those rural <b>telecenters.</b> Three location optimization problems as set covering, p-center and p-median were defined and then solved. In the set covering problem the number of the centers was minimized given a maximum travel distance from origin to destination, in the p-center problem the maximum distance between the destination and the village served from there was minimized given the number of <b>telecenters</b> required and in the p-median problem total travel distance in the area was minimized again given the number of <b>telecenters.</b> While each of the three models aims to serve all the villages in the area, their results differ reflecting the priority of that approach...|$|R

40|$|It {{is known}} that first year Information Systems {{students}} have different levels of computer literacy when they enter the university. This is specifically the case in South Africa, where large numbers of students come from disadvantaged educational backgrounds.

The use of cooperative learning and information technology may enable the lecturers and students {{to cope with the}} demands of a first year course in Information Systems. The planning of <b>telecenters</b> using cooperative learning techniques is, however, crucial for the success of such an endeavor.
