5|$|A {{snowflake}} {{consists of}} roughly 1019 water molecules, which {{are added to}} its core at different rates and in different patterns, depending on the changing temperature and humidity within the atmosphere that the snowflake falls through {{on its way to}} <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>As</b> a result, snowflakes vary among themselves, while following similar patterns.|$|E
5|$|According {{to local}} geologists, the exact {{source of the}} spring remains unknown, but it is {{believed}} that its origin may be southwest of its actual location, possibly at Bukit Timah. Hot springs are formed when underground water comes into contact with hot rock masses. The resulting high pressure causes the water to seep upwards through cracks, forcing itself out of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>as</b> a spring.|$|E

5|$|Built in the {{vicinity}} of an older church, the Church of St Demetrius is a crossed-dome stone building. According to several legends, the church was dug into <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>as</b> the Ottomans conquered Bulgaria, so that it may be protected from desecration.

5|$|Immature fruit {{bodies are}} spherical—somewhat {{resembling}} puffballs with pointed beaks—and are partially or completely buried in <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>As</b> the fungus matures, the outer layer of tissue (the exoperidium) splits into {{four to eight}} pointed segments that spread outwards and downwards, lifting and exposing the spherical inner spore sac. The spore sac contains the gleba, a mass of spores and fertile mycelial tissue that when young is white and firm, but ages to become brown and powdery. Often, a layer of the exoperidium splits {{around the perimeter of}} the spore sac so that it appears to rest in a collar or saucer. Atop the spore sac is a small pointed beak, the peristome, which has a small hole from which spores may be released.|$|E
5|$|In 335 BC, Alexander {{fought against}} the Thracian tribe of the Triballi at Haemus Mons and along the Danube, forcing their {{surrender}} on Peuce Island. Shortly thereafter, the Illyrian king Cleitus of the Dardani threatened to attack Macedonia, but Alexander took the initiative and besieged the Dardani at Pelion (in modern Albania). When Thebes had once again revolted from the League of Corinth and was besieging the Macedonian garrison in the Cadmea, Alexander left the Illyrian front and marched to Thebes, which he placed under siege. After breaching the walls, Alexander's forces killed 6,000 Thebans, took 30,000 inhabitants as prisoners of war, and burned the city to <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>as</b> a warning that convinced all other Greek states except Sparta not to challenge Alexander again.|$|E

5|$|In late 1944, the Luftwaffe Operation Bodenplatte {{with the}} aim of {{crippling}} Allied tactical air forces based in the Low Countries, and thus reviving the bogged-down progress of the Wehrmacht during the Battle of the Bulge. The operation was launched on New Year's Day, 1945. JG 1 participated in this action with orders to destroy as many enemy aircraft on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>as</b> possible. Although a large number of allied aircraft were destroyed, the Luftwaffe lost a large number of pilots that were irreplaceable.|$|E
5|$|In the ground, they dig for {{earthworms}} and grubs, {{and they}} search for beetles, cicada, crickets, flies, weta, spiders, caterpillars, slugs and snails on the ground. They will also feed on berries and seeds. To find prey, the great spotted kiwi use their scenting skills or feel vibrations {{caused by the}} movement of their prey. To do the latter, a kiwi would stick its beak into the ground, then use its beak to dig into <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>As</b> they are nocturnal, they do not emerge until thirty minutes after sunset to begin the hunt. Kiwis will also swallow small stones, which aid in digestion.|$|E
5|$|On the {{opposite}} side of the ball, Virginia Tech quarterback Al Clark completed seven of his 14 passes for 71 yards and an interception. Clark's greatest success came on the ground, however, as he rushed nine times for 55 yards and a touchdown. Most of Virginia Tech's offense came on <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> <b>as</b> Clark was surpassed in the rushing game by Shyrone Stith, who carried the ball 10 times for 71 yards and a touchdown. Fellow Tech running back Lamont Pegues scored two touchdowns and carried the ball 15 times for 41 yards.|$|E

5|$|One {{method is}} to use <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>as</b> a heat sink by drawing air through {{underground}} pipes. This is often done to provide a source of cool air for a building {{by means of a}} ground-coupled heat exchanger (also known as Earth tubes), wherein condensation is typically regarded as a significant problem. A major problem with such designs is that the underground tubes are subject to contamination and difficult to keep clean. Designs of this type require air to be drawn through the pipes by a fan, but the power required may be provided (or supplemented) by a wind turbine.|$|E
5|$|The Football Association chose St Andrew's to {{host the}} 1907 FA Cup {{semifinal}} between The Wednesday and Woolwich Arsenal; Wednesday won 3–1, {{and went on to}} win the tournament. This was the first FA Cup tie to be played at <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> <b>as</b> Birmingham had lost their opening match away from home. Three more semifinals took place at St Andrew's before the Second World War, in 1911, 1924 and 1934. The club bought the freehold of the ground in 1921 for a price believed to be less than £7,000 (£ today). In the 1930s, roofs were erected over the Kop and Railway End terraces, and in February 1939, the ground attendance record, variously recorded as 66,844 or 67,341, was set at the fifth-round FA Cup tie against Everton.|$|E

5|$|The {{brain was}} {{slightly}} sigmoidal (S-shaped), without much {{expansion of the}} cerebral hemispheres, more like a crocodile than a bird. This {{is in keeping with}} the overall conservatism of non-coelurosaurian theropod brains. Acrocanthosaurus had large and bulbous olfactory bulbs, indicating a good sense of smell. Reconstructing the semicircular canals of the ear, which control balance, shows that the head was held at a 25° angle below horizontal. This was determined by orienting the endocast so that the lateral semicircular canal was parallel to <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> <b>as</b> it usually is when an animal is in an alert posture.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} {{was set in}} a dystopian future {{controlled}} by Cyber-cops (referred to as such by director Brett Leonard.) It depicted an individual who records the Cyber-cops beating a man, only to be noticed and attacked himself. His camera is destroyed and the Cyber-cops leave him unconscious on <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> <b>as</b> they are busy trying to put down a riot elsewhere in the city. Alone, his camera equipment lands on him and is absorbed into his body, causing him to dramatically morph into a cyborg. The cyborg then joins the riot, leading the rebels to victory.|$|E
5|$|The {{neutral zone}} {{that had been}} {{allocated}} to Belgian fans was largely occupied by Juventus supporters, {{many of whom were}} from the local Italian community.

At approximately 7p.m., missiles began to be thrown between the two sets of fans; because the stadium was crumbling, fans could pick stones up and throw them across the divide.|$|E
