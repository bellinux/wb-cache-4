50|$|Rentcharges {{provided}} a regular income for landowners who {{were prepared to}} release land for development, the original builder, {{or in some cases}} a third party. The payments due are typically between £2 to £5 per annum, which are no longer a significant burden due to past inflation. Sometimes the land was released without a capital sum being paid with the rentcharge being the only payment. Once imposed, a rentcharge continues <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> all the <b>land</b> even when the land is later divided and sold off in plots. In such cases one terre-tenant can be made responsible for paying the whole rent. That person is then left to collect the appropriate portion from the other terre-tenants whose land is subject to the rentcharge.|$|R
50|$|Bolivia has had past {{newspaper}} advertisements {{that claimed}} to have land, animals and peasants for sale. The peasants weren't necessarily slaves but placed in their social class and obligated to work due <b>to</b> their <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> the <b>land</b> they lived and farmed. This sort of social interaction is based mainly on the people's strong belief of tradition and to uphold {{the actions of the}} past. In 1971 Ernesto Laclau addressed the argument of whether Latin America was either under a social system of feudalism or capitalism. He determined that the social system was extremely different from the capitalistic system in Europe and America, so therefore Latin America would be more closely related to have a Feudalism approach to social interaction.|$|R
50|$|Neuberger {{surfaced}} in England two years later, unwillingly assisting Lady Hester Stanton who wanted <b>to</b> magically <b>bind</b> the <b>land</b> <b>to</b> herself. Harry Sullivan {{was present at}} the time, having been stranded there when the TARDIS inexplicably left without him- later implied to have been drawn off-course by its damaged future self-, Harry joining forces with the amnesic Eighth Doctor to thwart Hester's plans. The Fourth Doctor and Sarah returned for Harry, but not before Neuberger, desiring a mate, bit him. What happened to Harry next is unclear, due to various manipulations of time being done by the Council of Eight (Sometime Never...). While some of these manipulations were undone, it is unclear whether Harry's infection was one of them. However, given the character's subsequent history in other tie-in fiction, it can be assumed that his condition was eventually cured or at least controlled.|$|R

50|$|IF3 is {{not universally}} {{found in all}} {{bacterial}} species but in E. coli it {{is required for the}} 30S subunit <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> the initiation site in mRNA. In addition, it has several other jobs including the stabilization of free 30S subunits, enables 30S subunits <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> mRNA and checks for accuracy against the first aminoacyl-tRNA. It also allows for rapid codon-anticodon pairing for the initiator tRNA <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> quickly <b>to.</b> IF3 is required by the small subunit to form initiation complexes, but has to be released to allow the 50S subunit <b>to</b> <b>bind.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{structure}} of 7 {{out of the}} 15 domains has been determined, using X-ray crystallography, {{and they seem to}} share a similar fold. The CI-MPR exists mainly as a dimer in the membrane. Domains 3, 5 and 9 have been found <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> mannose 6-phosphate. Domains 3 and 9 can <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> mannose 6-phosphate with high affinity. Domain 5 only binds Man-6-phosphate with a weak affinity. However domain 5 has also been shown <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> the phosphodiester, Man-phosphate-GlcNAc. This is a safety mechanism for the cell - it means it is able <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> lysosomal enzymes that have escaped the action of the enzyme that removes the GlcNAc residue. Combining these 3 domains allows the CI-MPR <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> a wide range of phosphorylated glycan structures. Domain 11 <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> IGF-II.|$|R

40|$|AbstractFragments of the 25 OkDa SI subunit of the Clostridium thermocellum {{cellulosome}} {{were obtained}} by protease-induced or spontaneous degradation. All detectable fragments, down to a mass of about 30 kDa, retained the ability <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> 125 I-labelled endoglucanase CelD, one of the catalytic subunits of the cellulosome. Several fragments were able <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> both <b>to</b> cellulose and to CElD. However, some fragments that could still <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> CelD {{did not have the}} ability <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> <b>to</b> cellulose. Therefore, S 1, a putative scaffolding protein of the cellulosome, is likely to carry two separate types of domains, one of which <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> cellulose, while the other type <b>binds</b> <b>to</b> the various catalytic subunits of the complex...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} group B streptococcal strains of various serotypes, Ia, Ib, Ic, II, and III were {{examined}} {{for their ability}} <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> human IgG and IgA. No strains of group B streptococci were found <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> IgG, but many strains possessing the Ibc protein antigen(s) were found <b>to</b> <b>bind</b> {{a significant amount of}} IgA.

40|$|AbstractThe {{interaction}} of inorganic phosphate with native and nucleotide-depleted F 1 -ATPase was studied.
