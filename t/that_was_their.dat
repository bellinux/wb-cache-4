Not long into their apprenticeships, Hawkpaw and Mothpaw see other kits from the nursery pretending to be Tigerstar and kill everybody. They ask Sasha why they acted like that about him. Sasha tells them the truth about him and makes them promise again that <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>their</b> little secret.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, {{the club}} {{followed}} Salisbury and {{stepped up to}} the Western League. This proved to be quite a different challenge—whereas before they had only competed against local teams in league competition, they now faced opposition from teams as far afield as Avon, Somerset and Devon as well as the reserve teams of league clubs such as Bristol Rovers, Bristol City and Torquay United. They generally fared well, only failing to finish in {{the top half of the}} table twice during their time at this level. Their first season in the Western League saw the club reach the first round proper of the FA Cup for the only time in their history after defeating Hendon 5–4 in a fourth qualifying round replay. On 3 November, Fourth Division side Gillingham came to the Walled Meadow and won 1–0 in front of 3484 spectators, a figure which would remain as the club's largest attendance for a home game. In the league Andover finished fourth, but <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>their</b> highest placing until 1969–70 when they finished as runners-up.|$|E

25|$|Ska {{arose in}} Jamaican studios {{in the late}} 1950s, {{developing}} from American R, mento and calypso music. Ska {{is characterized by a}} quarter note walking bass line, guitar and piano offbeats, and a drum pattern with cross-stick snare and bass drum on the backbeat and open hi-hat on the offbeats (with nothing on beats one and three). It is also notable for its jazz-influenced horn riffs. Jamaica gained its independence in 1962, and ska became the music of choice for Jamaican youths seeking music <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>their</b> own.

25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} renowned of the {{electric}} trams that operated in Sydney were the O and P class trams, known {{at the time as}} the footboard cars, after the surrounding footboard that conductors precariously balanced upon. These were later known as toastrack trams for their crossbench wooden seating layout. They had a seating capacity of 80 and a crush capacity of 150, and it was this capacity <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>their</b> selling point for Sydney's crowded system. They were commonly coupled together to run as double trams. 626 O class and 258 P class trams were constructed from 1908, and some remained in service until 1960.|$|E

Winning two of their first three games, against Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and Durham, they looked {{well on the way}} to the quarter-finals, {{although}} the fight would be difficult against Lancashire, to whom they lost their fourth match.

In the County Championship, however, they were defeated by a triple century from Somerset's skipper Graeme Smith, which sent them further down the Division Two tables.

25|$|Prior to the 2002 season Dallas drafted safety Roy Williams {{with the}} 8th overall pick. The season started out low as the Cowboys {{lost to the}} {{expansion}} Houston Texans 19–10 on Week 1. By far the highlight of 2002 was on October 28, when during a home game against the Seattle Seahawks, Emmitt Smith broke the all-time NFL rushing record previously held by Walter Payton. Their Thanksgiving Day win over the Redskins was their 10th consecutive win against Washington. However, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>their</b> final win of 2002: Dallas lost their next 4 games to finish with another last place 5–11 record. The losing streak was punctuated with a Week 17 20–14 loss against Washington. That game was Smith's last game as a Cowboys player: he was released during the offseason. Campo was immediately fired as head coach {{at the conclusion of}} the season.|$|E
25|$|The Fourth Crusade in {{agreement}} for funds attempted {{to help the}} deposed emperor Alexius IV regain his throne. After taking Constantinople, returning Alexius IV to the throne, the revolt against and death of Alexius IV, the Crusaders were left without payment. On 12 April 1204, the crusaders inflicted a severe sacking on Constantinople for three days, during which many ancient and medieval Roman and Greek works were either stolen or destroyed. Despite their oaths {{and the threat of}} excommunication, the Crusaders ruthlessly and systematically violated the city's holy sanctuaries, destroying, defiling, or stealing all they could lay hands on; nothing was spared. It was said that the total amount looted from Constantinople was about 900,000 silver marks. The Venetians received 150,000 silver marks <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>their</b> due, while the Crusaders received 50,000 silver marks. A further 100,000 silver marks were divided evenly up between the Crusaders and Venetians. The remaining 500,000 silver marks were secretly kept back by many Crusader knights.|$|E

This angered Russo and later that day Russo exploded during a close-door meeting with management. According to Russo, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>their</b> worst fight ever.

Yet another draw came when they drew with Aldershot Town 1–1 at home. <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>their</b> last draw for a while as they went on a six-game unbeaten run. Starting with a 1–3 away win at Lincoln City then playing at home beating Nuneaton Town 4–0, they were 3–0 up after 30 minutes. The Gulls {{then went on to}} win two away games winning 0–2 in both of them. First winning at Chester then Grimsby (manager Chris Hargreaves' home town). The next game was a home game that was looking to be a 0–0 draw until the 90th minute when can The Gulls captain Luke Young scored an incredible 35 yard free kick to give Torquay the 3 points. A 2–0 win at home against Dover followed, however this was {{to be the end of}} Torquay's 10 game unbeaten run and an indifferent run-in would see United end the season in 13th position.|$|E
