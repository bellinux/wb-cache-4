5|$|Kristen LaMoreaux, {{another student}} of the University of Pittsburgh, focused on the {{emplacement}} of trachyte lava flows and domes. In 2006, LaMoreaux analyzed jointing patterns at Ornostay Bluff, a viscous series of trachyte lava flows on the western lava plateau of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex. LaMoreaux also examined <b>trachytic</b> lava flows from Koosick Bluff and Triangle Dome, a <b>trachytic</b> lava dome which last erupted during the Pleistocene period. Other studies by LaMoreaux determined criteria for understanding how lava flow thickness {{may or may not}} be an indication that the progress of a lava flow was impeded by an ice barrier, resulting in an unusually thick lava flow.|$|E
5|$|The {{field has}} erupted andesite. Such a {{limited range of}} {{composition}} is typical for Austral Volcanic Zone volcanoes, which only feature andesite and dacite. Lava domes feature columnar joints. The surface texture of the rocks is <b>trachytic</b> to porphyritic.|$|E
5|$|Andesite at Slag Hill {{consists}} of 70% dark brown volcanic glass with varied degrees of <b>trachytic</b> texture in the plagioclastic matrix {{and less than}} 5% of the andesite comprises vesicular textures. Plagioclase, hornblende and augite are mostly in form as phenocrysts and comprise 1% to 10% of the andesite. Orthoclase crystals are found occasionally and they likely represent xenocrysts.|$|E
5|$|At Ring Mountain, {{andesite}} comprises 70% brown {{volcanic glass}} and vesicular textures {{as much as}} 15%. The plagioclastic matrix is <b>trachytic.</b> Augite, biotite, plagioclase and hornblende occur as microphenocrysts and comprise 1% to 7% of the andesite. Small qualities of quartz are common and occur as microxenocrysts. Microxenocrysts of orthoclase likely exist in andesite at Ring Mountain.|$|E
5|$|Little Ring Mountain at the {{northern}} end of the field contains at least 70% brown volcanic glass with isolated phenocrysts of plagioclase. Vesicular textures are up to 5%, suggesting that the lava erupted subaerially. Probable xenocrysts of quartz have been identified at the volcano. At least one xenolith fragment has been found in loose rubble at the volcano and included several quartz xenocrysts and polycrystalline quartz xenoliths in a glassy matrix with <b>trachytic</b> plagioclase.|$|E
5|$|The {{andesite}} lava of Ember Ridge comprises 55% brownish-green {{volcanic glass}} with a <b>trachytic</b> matrix of plagioclase. About 35% of Ember Ridge andesite contains phenocrysts of hornblende, augite, plagioclase and orthopyroxene and exist as isolated crystals and clots. A feature south of Ember Ridge, unofficially known as Betty's Bump, comprises andesite with phenocrysts of plagioclase, augite and olivine. Dark brown volcanic glass composes the Betty's Bump andesite {{as much as}} 20%. The relationship of Betty's Bump with Ember Ridge is unclear but it likely represents a separate volcanic feature due to its topographic isolation.|$|E
5|$|Chira Endress, {{a student}} of Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, United States, focused on a section of glaciogenic sediments {{immediately}} beneath the same Ice Peak trachyte lava flow sampled and described by Jeff Hungerford during his 2006 studies. Endress ettempted {{to determine if the}} sediments were deposited immediately before the lava flow was emplaced, or if {{they are likely to be}} much older. Endress has quantified the mineralogy of clasts and sand-sized particles from samples in the sediment, and has determined that the mineralogy of several of the <b>trachytic</b> clasts is very similar to that in the overlying lava flow, including the minerals clinopyroxene, magnetite, alkali feldspar, and aenigmatite. Endress has also found small lenses of pristine basaltic glass, which could have derived from the Pillow Ridge subglacial mound near Mount Edziza.|$|E
5|$|Each volcano type {{produced}} by the Anahim hotspot has its own unique life cycle of growth and erosion. Volcanic cones have their origins from tephra accumulating around vents during Strombolian eruptions. They are composed of trachyte, trachyandesite, basalt, phonolite, basanite {{and to a lesser}} extent phonotephrite. In contrast, lava domes are formed mainly by viscous <b>trachytic</b> magma that erupted effusively onto the surface and then piled up thick around vents. Most of these features were formed by a single volcanic eruption and are therefore monogenetic. However, in some cases several eruptions occurred at a single locus to create larger, polygenetic centres (e.g. Satah Mountain, Baldface Mountain, Nazko Cone). Once activity has declined, erosion reduces them into volcanic remnants such as lava plugs.|$|E
5|$|Several rock types {{with varying}} {{chemical}} compositions make up Level Mountain. Ankaramites and alkali basalts {{are the primary}} volcanic rocks comprising the basal shield. Alkali basalts form columnar jointed lava flows, vesicular lava flows, dikes and scoria while ankaramites are present as dark-coloured lava flows with several columnar cooling units. Trachybasalts, phonolites, trachytes, peralkaline trachytes, pantellerites, comendites and rhyolites form the overlying stratovolcano and domes. They comprise dikes, welded tuffs, pitchstones, volcanic plugs, laccoliths and flows. Trachybasalts are {{in the form of}} two textural types; phenocryst-rich lava flows and fragmental flow agglomerates. Phonolites are vesicular and pumiceous in nature, although phonolites with <b>trachytic</b> texture are also present. Trachytes and peralkaline trachytes are the primary volcanic rocks in the Level Mountain Range. Comendite lava flows appear to have erupted fluidly, forming lava tubes. Rhyolites are in the form of stubby lava flows and domes.|$|E
25|$|The cone of Nemrut {{was further}} formed by mobile dark <b>trachytic</b> lavas, which {{gradually}} filled Bitlis gorge to {{a distance of}} 80km from the volcanic center. Lava flows reached a width of 200 m and had a thickness of 5–30 meters. Consequent deposits from basalt and <b>trachytic</b> lavas finalized a pronounced cone with a height of about 4400-4500 m.|$|E
25|$|Upper Volcanic Complex, {{represents}} the main sub-aerial activity composed of three main stratigraphic units, that include basaltic to <b>trachytic</b> flows with interbedded pyroclastic deposits {{in the first}} two layers, and a more recent unit of exclusively pyroclastic deposits.|$|E
25|$|In the Boundary Ranges {{of northwestern}} British Columbia, Hoodoo Mountain began its {{formation}} at least 100,000years ago mostly under glacial ice of the Cordilleran Ice Sheet. More than 90% of Hoodoo Mountain was formed during this eruptive period and interlayed peralkaline phonolitic and <b>trachytic</b> lava flows and hyaloclastites {{are the main}} volcanics comprising the volcano. On the northern flank of Hoodoo Mountain lies the smaller Little Bear Mountain, a tuya which also formed in the Pleistocene epoch.|$|E
25|$|Fissural Zone: Connecting {{the eastern}} portion of Santa Bárbara, the western {{frontier}} of Pico Alto and Guilherme Moniz exist a grouping of fissural volcanoes and basaltic cones (Hawaiian and Strombolian), {{the youngest of}} which formed about 15,000 years ago. The only historical eruptions occurred in 1761, along a fissure on the eastern face of Santa Bárbara, and in 1867 and between 1998–2000 from submarine vents off the western coast (Serreta). The groupings of volcanic structures on the island are aligned along a northwest-southwest and west-northwest-east-southeast orientation that extends to the submarine vents/volcanoes towards the eastern basin of Graciosa, including geomorphological alignments of smaller volcanic structures (including both basaltic and <b>trachytic</b> cones).|$|E
500|$|Two [...] thick tephra {{deposits}} {{are situated}} between sand, silt, mud and gravel in the Dease Lake and Finlay River areas. They both range in composition from phonolitic to <b>trachytic</b> and {{are high in}} iron(II) oxide, indicating that the tephras were likely extruded from a single volcano. Radiocarbon dating of terrestrial plant macrofossils directly overlying the youngest tephra deposit suggests an early Holocene age for this volcanic material. Because Level Mountain has received little scientific study and it is debated {{on whether or not}} Holocene volcanic rocks are present, the volcano is a possible source for these tephra deposits along with Hoodoo Mountain, Heart Peaks and the Mount Edziza complex.|$|E
500|$|Souther's {{studies in}} 1992 {{highlighted}} {{the importance and}} size of the region, and proposed that numerous subglacial eruptions emplaced lava in a sub-ice or ice-contact environment. More recent studies have worked on Souther's contributions with more detailed studies which are funded by colleges and universities. Since colleges and universities started studying the Mount Edziza volcanic complex, it has been an extremely important volcano for subglacial volcanism because its ice-contact lavas record evidence of ice existence and thickness in an area for which there is very little data on ice conditions before the Illinoian Stage of glaciation, which preceded the last glacial, or [...] "Wisconsin", period. Several areas of possible basaltic and <b>trachytic</b> ice-contact products were studied in detail on the western flank of the Mount Edziza volcanic complex, in order to approve their ice-contact nature, and to eventually better constrain former ice existence and thickness. Its lava plateau has also been an important cultural resource. In 2006, Jeff Hungerford, a student of the University of Pittsburgh in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, United States, focused on fieldwork on the region surrounding Edziza's Tennena Cone, located immediately west of Ice Peak which formed subglacially during the early Holocene period when this area had remnants of glacial ice from the last ice age. Hungerford's studies in 2006 focused on subglacial volcanism, sampling pillow lavas to be used for degassing studies aimed at determining ice thicknesses during a subglacial eruption, and describing coeval glaciogenic sediments immediately underlying pillow lavas at the distal end of the lava flows. Hungerford also worked on describing glaciogenic sediments immediately underlying lava flows from Ice Peak adjacent to Tennena Cone, which may preserve a record of a one-million-year-old ice sheet.|$|E

2500|$|Cinco Picos Volcanic Complex: {{the oldest}} on Terceira (defined by the Serra do Cume), which {{completed}} its main sub-aerial activity by about 370–380,000 years ago. Collapse {{of the upper}} part of the stratovolcanic edifice formed an enormous [...] caldera about 370,000 years ago. Post-caldera eruptions of basalt from cinder cones on and near the caldera floor and <b>trachytic</b> pyroclastic flow and pumice fall deposits from younger volcanoes west of Cinco Picos have refilled much of the caldera producing an almost-uninterrupted fertile plain.|$|E
2500|$|Igneous Rocks.--Above {{a height}} of [...] the country {{consists}} of bedded traps belonging to two distinct and unconformable groups. The lower (Ashangi group) consists of basalts and dolerites often amygdaloidal. Their relation to the Antalo limestones is uncertain, but Blanford considers them to be not later in age than the Oolite. The upper (Magdala group) contains much <b>trachytic</b> rock of considerable thickness, lying perfectly horizontally, and giving rise {{to a series of}} terraced ridges characteristic of central Ethiopia. They are interbedded with unfossiliferous sandstones and shales.|$|E
2500|$|The Anaga massif (Macizo de Anaga), at {{the northeastern}} {{end of the}} island, has an {{irregular}} and rugged topographical profile where, despite its generally modest elevations, the Cruz de Taborno reaches a height of [...] Due {{to the age of}} its material (5.7million years), its deep erosive processes, and the dense network of dikes piercing the massif, its surface exposes numerous outcroppings of both phonolitic and <b>trachytic</b> origin. A large number of steep-walled gorges are present, penetrating deeply into the terrain. Vertical cuts dominate the Anagan coast, with infrequent beaches of rocks or black sand between them; the few that exist generally coincide with the mouths of gorges.|$|E
2500|$|Heart Peaks {{is one of}} {{the four}} volcanoes in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province {{suggested}} to have erupted the Finlay tephras. These are situated throughout northwestern British Columbia and likely extend east into the Canadian Rockies. In the Finlay River and Dease Lake areas, two tephra deposits are situated between sand, silt, mud and gravel. They are both phonolitic to <b>trachytic</b> in composition and high in iron(II) oxide, indicating that the tephras were possibly erupted from a single volcano. Regional plant macrofossils immediately overlying the youngest Finlay tephra deposit are [...] and [...] radiocarbon years old. This indicates that the Finlay tephras are Early Holocene in age and were deposited shortly after the regional Fraser Glaciation retreated.|$|E
2500|$|The roughly {{trapezoidal}} {{island is}} formed by a complex volcano immediately {{southwest of the}} Campi Flegrei area at {{the western side of}} the Bay of Naples. The eruption of the <b>trachytic</b> Green Tuff ignimbrite about 56,000years ago was followed by caldera formation. The highest point of the island, Monte Epomeo (788m), is a volcanic horst consisting of a Green Tuff ignimbrite deposit that was submerged after its eruption and then uplifted. Volcanism on the island has been significantly affected by tectonism that formed a series of horsts and grabens; at least [...] of uplift has formed as a result of resurgent doming during the past 33,000years. Many small monogenetic volcanoes were formed around the uplifted block. Volcanism during the Holocene produced a series of pumiceous tephras, tuff rings, lava domes, and lava flows. The latest eruption of Ischia, in 1302, produced a spatter cone and the Arso lava flow, which reached the NE coast.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most active}} {{volcanic}} {{region of the}} northern Pacific Northwest is called the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province (sometimes called the Stikine Volcanic Belt). It contains more than 100 young volcanoes and several eruptions known to have occurred within the last 400 years. The last eruptions within the volcanic belt was about 150 years ago at The Volcano in the Iskut-Unuk River Cones volcanic field. The most voluminous and most persistent eruptive center within the belt and in Canada is Level Mountain. It is a large shield volcano that covers an area of [...] southwest of Dease Lake and north of Telegraph Creek. The broad dissected summit region consists of <b>trachytic</b> and rhyolitic lava domes and {{was considered to be}} dotted with several minor basaltic vents of postglacial age, although considered Holocene activity to be uncertain. The Mount Edziza volcanic complex is perhaps the most spectacular volcanic edifice in British Columbia. It is the second largest persistent eruptive center within the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province and is flanked with numerous young satellite cones, including the young, well-preserved Eve Cone. There are some indications that Level Mountain and Mount Edziza volcanic complex may be between 11 and 9 million years old.|$|E
2500|$|At {{least five}} volcanoes have had seismic {{activity}} since 1985, including the Mount Edziza volcanic complex (eight events), Castle Rock (two events), Hoodoo Mountain (eight events), Crow Lagoon (four events) and The Volcano (five events). Seismic data {{suggests that these}} volcanoes still contain living magma chambers, indicating possible future eruptive activity. Although the available data does not allow a clear conclusion, these observations are further indications that some Northern Cordilleran volcanoes are potentially active and that their associated hazards may be significant. The seismic activity correlates both with some of Canada's most youthful volcanoes and with long-lived volcanoes {{with a history of}} significant explosive activity, such as Hoodoo Mountain and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex. To date, Edziza and Hoodoo pose the greatest threats in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province. A large pumice deposit scattered throughout the Edziza complex highlights one of the significant volcanic hazards associated with the complex, including the possibility of a large explosive eruption. This large pumice deposit indicates that the Mount Edziza volcanic complex has a history of producing not only fluid and passive basaltic lava flows, but also more silica-rich <b>trachytic</b> and rhyolitic lava flows and explosive eruptions. The silica-rich compositions are similar to those associated with the most catastrophic eruptions on Earth. [...] A large explosive eruption at the Edziza complex could produce an eruption column that would affect parts of the Pacific Northwest. Similarly, high eruption columns from Hoodoo Mountain would disrupt air traffic between Canada, Alaska and Asia. The flat summit of Hoodoo Mountain is also covered by an ice cap more than [...] thick. An eruption from Hoodoo's summit would cause considerable melting of the ice cap to create large floods and lahars, which would have significant effects on adjacent river valleys. This includes the Iskut River just on the southern flank of Hoodoo Mountain, which is the host for a large amount of salmon, logging operations and a large mining and mineral exploration camp. Edziza and Hoodoo Mountain are two of the three most hazardous volcanoes in Western Canada that have been active in the past 10,000 years, the other being Mount Meager in the Garibaldi Volcanic Belt of southwestern British Columbia which produced a large-scale eruption 2,350years ago that sent ash as far as central Alberta.|$|E

60|$|As we {{have seen}} that {{crystals}} of feldspar, in the instance described by Von Buch, sink in obsidian, in accordance with their known greater specific gravity, we might expect to find in every <b>trachytic</b> district, where obsidian has flowed as lava, that it had proceeded from the upper or highest orifices. This, according to Von Buch, holds good in a remarkable manner both at the Lipari Islands and on the Peak of Teneriffe; at this latter place obsidian has never flowed from a less height than 9,200 feet. Obsidian, also, appears to have been erupted from the loftiest peaks of the Peruvian Cordillera. I will only further observe, that the specific gravity of quartz varies from 2.6 to 2.8; and therefore, that when present in a volcanic focus, it would not tend to sink with the basaltic bases; and this, perhaps, explains the frequent presence, and the abundance of this mineral, in the lavas of the <b>trachytic</b> series, as observed in previous parts of this volume.|$|E
60|$|Our path {{skirted the}} Estancia de los Alemanos, about 300 yards {{higher than the}} English, and zig-zagged sharply up the pumice-slope. The talus now narrowed; the side-walls of dark <b>trachytic</b> blocks {{pinching}} it in. At this grisly hour they showed the quaintest figures--towers and pinnacles, needles and tree-trunks, veiled nuns and monstrous beasts. Amongst them were huge bombs of obsidian, and masses with translucent, vitreous edges that cut like glass. Most of them contained crystals of felspar and pyroxene.|$|E
60|$|On our right, {{or to the}} north-north-east of the Pike, rose La Fortaleza, alias the Golliada del Cedro. The abrupt wall had salient and {{re-entering}} angles, {{not unlike}} the Palisades of the Hudson River, with intercalated strata and a smooth glacis at the base, except between the east and north-west, where the periphery has been destroyed. It is apparently basalt, as we may expect in the lower levels before reaching the <b>trachytic</b> region. The other notable features were Monte Tigayga, with its vertical cliff, trending northwards to the sea; the gap through which the Orotava lava-bed burst the crater-margin; the Llano de Maja ('Manja' in Berthelot), a strip of Las Canadas, and the horizontally striated Peak of Guajara (8,903 feet).|$|E
60|$|These beds {{occur within}} the <b>trachytic</b> district, {{at the western}} base of Green Mountain, under which they dip at a high inclination. They are only {{partially}} exposed, being covered up by modern ejections; from this cause, I was unable to trace their junction with the trachyte, or to discover whether they had flowed as a stream of lava, or had been injected amidst the overlying strata. There are three principal beds of obsidian, of which the thickest forms {{the base of the}} section. The alternating stony layers appear to me eminently curious, and shall be first described, and afterwards their passage into the obsidian. They have an extremely diversified appearance; five principal varieties may be noticed, but these insensibly blend into each other by endless gradations.|$|E
60|$|The {{margin of}} the island is formed by a rude circle of great, black, stratified, ramparts of basalt, dipping seaward, and worn into cliffs, which are often nearly perpendicular, and vary in height from {{a few hundred feet}} to two thousand. This circle, or rather horse-shoe shaped ring, is open to the south, and is {{breached}} by several other wide spaces. Its rim or summit generally projects little above the level of the adjoining inland country; and the more recent feldspathic lavas, sloping down from the central heights, generally abut against and overlap its inner margin; on the north-western side of the island, however, they appear (judging from a distance) to have flowed over and concealed portions of it. In some parts, where the basaltic ring has been breached, and the black ramparts stand detached, the feldspathic lavas have passed between them, and now overhang the sea-coast in lofty cliffs. The basaltic rocks are of a black colour and thinly stratified; they are generally highly vesicular, but occasionally compact; some of them contain numerous crystals of glassy feldspar and octahedrons of titaniferous iron; others abound with crystals of augite and grains of olivine. The vesicles are frequently lined with minute crystals (of chabasie?) and even become amygdaloidal with them. The streams are separated from each other by cindery matter, or by a bright red, friable, saliferous tuff, which is marked by successive lines like those of aqueous deposition; and sometimes it has an obscure, concretionary structure. The rocks of this basaltic series occur nowhere except near the coast. In most volcanic districts the <b>trachytic</b> lavas are of anterior origin to the basaltic; but here we see, that a great pile of rock, closely related in composition to the <b>trachytic</b> family, has been erupted subsequently to the basaltic strata: the number, however, of dikes, abounding with large crystals of augite, with which the feldspathic lavas have been injected, shows perhaps some tendency to a return to the more usual order of superposition.|$|E
60|$|Springing from boulder to boulder, {{an exhilarating}} {{exercise}} for a time, over a 'surface of horrible roughness,' as Prof. Dana says of Hawaii, we halted {{to examine the}} Cueva de Hielo, whose cross has long succumbed to the wintry winds. The 'ice-house' in a region of fire occupies a little platform like the ruined base of a Pompey's Pillar. This is the table upon which the neveros pack their stores of snow. The cave, a mere hole in the <b>trachytic</b> lava, opens to the east with an entrance some four feet wide. The general appearance {{was that of a}} large bubble in a baked loaf. Inside we saw a low ceiling spiky with stalactites, possibly icicles, and a coating of greenish ice upon the floor. A gutter leads from the mouth, showing signs of water-wear, and the blocks of trachyte are so loaded with glossy white felspar that I attempted to dust them before sitting down.|$|E
60|$|These five varieties, {{with many}} {{intermediate}} ones, pass and repass into each other. As the compact varieties are quite {{subordinate to the}} others, the whole may be considered as laminated or striped. The laminae, to sum up their characteristics, are either quite straight, or slightly tortuous, or convoluted; they are all parallel to each other, and to the intercalating strata of obsidian; they are generally of extreme thinness; they consist either of an apparently homogeneous, compact rock, striped with different shades of grey and brown colours, or of crystalline feldspathic layers in {{a more or less}} perfect state of purity, and of different thicknesses, with distinct crystals of glassy feldspar placed lengthways, or of very thin layers chiefly composed of minute crystals of quartz and augite, or composed of black and red specks of an augitic mineral and of an oxide of iron, either not crystallised or imperfectly so. After having fully described the obsidian, I shall return to the subject of the lamination of rocks of the <b>trachytic</b> series.|$|E
60|$|Whatever may {{be thought}} of the {{explanation}} here advanced of the laminated structure of the rocks of the <b>trachytic</b> series, I venture to call the attention of geologists to the simple fact, that in a body of rock at Ascension, undoubtedly of volcanic origin, layers often of extreme tenuity, quite straight, and parallel to each other, have been produced;--some composed of distinct crystals of quartz and diopside, mingled with amorphous augitic specks and granular feldspar,--others entirely composed of these black augitic specks, with granules of oxide of iron,--and lastly, others formed of crystalline feldspar, in {{a more or less}} perfect state of purity, together with numerous crystals of feldspar, placed lengthways. At this island, there is reason to believe, and in some analogous cases, it is certainly known, that the laminae have originally been formed with their present high inclination. Facts of this nature are manifestly of importance, with relation to the structural origin of that grand series of plutonic rocks, which like the volcanic have undergone the action of heat, and which consist of alternate layers of quartz, feldspar, mica and other minerals.|$|E
60|$|The {{upper half}} of the {{sedimentary}} mass, under the basaltic lava, consists of innumerable zones of perfectly white bright green, yellowish and brownish, fine-grained, sometimes incoherent, sedimentary matter. The white, pumiceous, <b>trachytic</b> tuff-like varieties are of rather greater specific gravity than the pumiceous mudstone on the coast to the north; some of the layers, especially the browner ones, are coarser, so that the broken crystals are distinguishable with a weak lens. The layers vary in character in short distances. With {{the exception of a}} few of the Ostrea Patagonica, which appeared to have rolled down from the cliff above, no organic remains were found. The chief difference between these layers taken as a whole, and the upper beds both at the mouth of the river and on the coast northward, seems to lie in the occasional presence of more colouring matter, and in the supply having been intermittent; these characters, as we have seen, very gradually disappear in descending the valley, and this fact may perhaps be accounted for by the currents of a more open sea having blended together the sediment from a distant and intermittent source.|$|E
60|$|In {{the clear}} winter-air we could {{distinctly}} trace the bold contour {{of the upper}} heights tipped by the central haystack, El Nublo, a giant <b>trachytic</b> monolith. We passed Confital Bay, whose 'comfits' are galettes of stone, and gave a wide berth to the Isleta and its Sphinx's head. This rocky peninsula, projecting sharply from the north-eastern chord of the circle, is outlined by a dangerous reef, and drops suddenly into 130 fathoms. Supported on the north by great columns of basalt, it is the terminus of a secondary chain, trending north-east--south-west, and meeting the Cumbre, or highest ground, whose strike is north-west--south-east. Like the knuckle-bone of the Tenerife ham it is a contorted mass of red and black lavas and scoriae, with sharp slides and stone-floods still distinctly traceable. Of its five eruptive cones the highest, which supports the Atalaya Vieja, or old look-out, now the signal-station, rises to 1,200 feet. A fine lighthouse, with detached quarters for the men, crowns another crater-top to the north. The grim block wants water at this season, when the thinnest coat of green clothes its black-red forms. La Isleta {{appears to have been}} a burial-ground of the indigenes, who, instead of stowing away their mummies in caves, built detached sepulchres and raised tumuli of scoriae over their embalmed dead. As at Peruvian Arica, many remains have been exposed by modern earthquakes and landslips.|$|E
60|$|At Port Desire {{there is}} an {{extensive}} formation of the claystone porphyry, stretching at least twenty-five miles into the interior: it has been denuded and deeply worn into gullies before being covered up by the tertiary deposits, through which it here and there projects in hills; those north of the bay being 440 feet in height. The strata have in several places been tilted at small angles, generally either to N.N.W. or S.S.E. By gradual passages and alternations, the porphyries change incessantly in nature. I will describe {{only some of the}} principal mineralogical changes, which are highly instructive, and which I carefully examined. The prevailing rock has a compact purplish base, with crystals of earthy or opaque feldspar, and often with grains of quartz. There are other varieties, with an almost truly <b>trachytic</b> base, full of little angular vesicles and crystals of glassy feldspar; and there are beds of black perfect pitchstone, as well as of a concretionary imperfect variety. On a casual inspection, the whole series would be thought to be of the same plutonic or volcanic nature with the <b>trachytic</b> varieties and pitchstone; but this is far from being the case, as much of the porphyry is certainly of metamorphic origin. Besides the true porphyries, there are many beds of earthy, quite white or yellowish, friable, easily fusible matter, resembling chalk, which under the microscope is seen to consist of minute broken crystals, and which, as remarked in a former chapter, singularly resembles the upper tufaceous beds of the Patagonian tertiary formation. This earthy substance often becomes coarser, and contains minute rounded fragments of porphyries and rounded grains of quartz, and in one case so many of the latter as to resemble a common sandstone. These beds are sometimes marked with true lines of aqueous deposition, separating particles of different degrees of coarseness; in other cases there are parallel ferruginous lines not of true deposition, as shown by the arrangement of the particles, though singularly resembling them. The more indurated varieties often include many small and some larger angular cavities, which appear due to the removal of earthy matter: some varieties contain mica. All these earthy and generally white stones insensibly pass into more indurated sonorous varieties, breaking with a conchoidal fracture, yet of small specific gravity; many of these latter varieties assume a pale purple tint, being singularly banded and veined with different shades, and often become plainly porphyritic with crystals of feldspar. The formation of these crystals could be most clearly traced by minute angular and often partially hollow patches of earthy matter, first assuming a FIBROUS STRUCTURE, then passing into opaque imperfectly shaped crystals, and lastly, into perfect glassy crystals. When these crystals have appeared, and when the basis has become compact, the rock in many places could not be distinguished from a true claystone porphyry without a trace of mechanical structure.|$|E
