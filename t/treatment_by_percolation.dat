40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to valorize the bottom ash {{generated}} by the thermal power plant in the cardboard manufacturing wastewater <b>treatment</b> <b>by</b> infiltration <b>percolation</b> process and to study the purifying effect of the crushed bottom ashes used instead of the fly ash which is already recycled in the cement industry. For this purpose, different coastal sands of the area of the city of El Jadida, combined with bottom ash (by-products of a local power plant), are used to filter wastewater from a cardboard manufacturing plant. The chemical and mineralogical composition of bottom ash are produced respectively by X-ray fluorescence and X-ray diffraction. The wastewater samples were collected during a complete cycle of production of the cardboard. The heavy metals content before and after filtration was obtained by atomic emission spectrometry, with inductively coupled plasma (ICP-AES). The main parameters analyzed were: total suspended solids (TSS), organic matter COD, BOD 5, the potential hydrogen pH and heavy metals (iron, zinc and arsenic). The results are very conclusive and respect the essence of control required by Moroccan regulations (law 1606 - 06) related to discharges from the papermaking and cardboard industry...|$|R

Various computer models that have been proposed are reviewed and related to the experimental and theoretical framework. While some conductor properties can be well described <b>by</b> <b>percolation</b> theory and models, we argue that a conceptual gap exists between experiment and theory. This gap has to be bridged by finding relations between electromagnetic and statistical parameters. We derive various such relations and compare them with recent simulation data. In particular, we suggest a new scaling law between the two fundamental variables current and probability.

60|$|From {{the facts}} now given we may {{conclude}} that castings ejected on our Chalk Downs suffer some loss <b>by</b> the <b>percolation</b> of their finer matter into the chalk.

Besides the loss caused <b>by</b> <b>percolation,</b> some fine earth is certainly washed down the sloping grass-covered surfaces of our Downs. The washing-down process, however, will be checked in the course of time; for although I do not know how thin a layer of mould suffices to support worms, yet a limit must at last be reached; and then their castings would cease to be ejected or would become scanty.|$|R
