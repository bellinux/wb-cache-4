25|$|A {{variety of}} other themes in the novel besides {{censorship}} have been suggested. Two major themes are resistance to conformity and control of individuals via technology and mass media. Bradbury explores how the government is able to use mass media to influence society and suppress individualism through book burning. The characters Beatty and Faber point out <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>population</b> is to blame. Due to their constant desire for a simplistic, positive image, books must be suppressed. Beatty blames the minority groups, who would take offense to published works that displayed them in an unfavorable light. Faber went further to state that <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>population</b> simply stopped reading on their own. He notes that the book burnings themselves became a form of entertainment to the general public.|$|E

50|$|Controversy {{has long}} existed over the {{classification}} of Zamia in Florida; at one extreme all <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>populations</b> {{have been included in}} a broadly defined Zamia pumila and at the other several species have been recognized under various names (e.g., Z. augustifolia, Z. floridana, Z. silvicola, and Z. umbrosa). The Flora of North America treats all of <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>populations</b> as Z. integrifolia. Genetically, the differences between populations cannot be explained by habitat variability. Studies conducted by Ward showed that five different Florida populations of Z. integrifolia with identical cultivation produced distinct leaf morphology, suggesting that there may be too much genetic diversity amongst these Florida Z. integrifolia, not to mention geographically isolated populations, to consider them a single species.|$|R
