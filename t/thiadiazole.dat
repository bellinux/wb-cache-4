Faced with this global threat it is crucial to better {{understand}} the physiology of the causative organism, Mycobacterium Tuberculosis, in order to develop efficient therapeutic strategies. PKnB from Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a crucial receptor-like protein kinase involved in signal transduction. M. tuberculosis PKnB is a trans-membrane Ser/Thr protein kinase (STPK) highly conserved in Gram-positive bacteria and apparently essential for Mycobacterial viability. We have attempted with the help of virtual screening and docking approaches to expound the extent of specificity of protein kinase B towards different classes of <b>Thiadiazoles</b> (an anti-tubercular agent).

50|$|One Italian {{research}} group discovered through digital screening that commercially available <b>thiadiazole</b> derivatives displayed moderate inhibitory action on both Abl and Src kinases. Using a 1,3,4 thiadiazol core and trying different groups or molecules on the benzene rings, several different substances with inhibitory properties were produced.

5000|$|Infections {{of seeds}} and roots are {{initiated}} {{by both the}} mycelia and spores of Py. ultimum. Two spore types are made, depending on the strain. Py. ultimum is a species complex that includes var. ultimum and var. sporangiiferum. [...] The major distinguishing feature is that sporangia and zoospores (swimming spores) are produced only rarely by Py. ultimum var. ultimum. Both species make oospores, which are thick-walled structures produced by sexual recombination. Both species are self-fertile (homothallic), which means that a single strain can mate with itself. In addition to oospores, Py. ultimum var. ultimum also makes hyphal swellings which germinate in a manner resembling sporangia to form plant-infecting hyphae. One important ecological difference between {{the different types of}} spores is that sporangia and zoospores are short-lived, while the thick-walled oospores can persist for years within soil, surviving even winter freezes. Mycelia and oospores in soil can infect seeds or roots. This leads to wilting, reduced yield, and ultimately plant death. Common signs of a Pythium infection include stunting of the plants, brown coloration of root-tips, and wilting of the plant during the warm part of the day. Management of disease is challenging but focuses on sanitation, fungicides, and biological control. Fungicides include mefenoxam, <b>thiadiazole,</b> etridiazole, propamocarb, dimethomorph, and phosphonates. Biological control agents include the bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Streptomyces griseoviridis, and the fungi Candida oleophila, Gliocladium catenulatum, Trichoderma harziamum, and Trichoderma virens. [...] Effective resistance in the plant host is generally not available. Sanitation is very important since the pathogen can be easily introduced into pasteurized soil or even soil-free potting mixes on dirty tools or pots. Especially in greenhouses, fungus gnats may also help move the pathogen from place to place.|$|E
