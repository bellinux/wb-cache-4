5|$|The ethnic {{diversity}} of the American AG is increasing; however, its constituency is still largely white. From 1990 to 2000, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> decline in white AG churches while ethnic churches, mainly Hispanic, were responsible {{for much of the}} denomination's numerical growth. In 2010, the AG reported 61.1 percent of its adherents as white, 20.4 percent as Hispanic, 9.1 percent as black, 4.1 percent as Asian/Pacific Islander, and 1.6 percent as Native American. The remaining 3.7 percent were listed as other/mixed.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{featured}} several returning guest stars, including Randy Oglesby, Tucker Smallwood, Josette DiCarlo and Sean McGowan. Additional {{sets were}} {{required for the}} scenes at the Xindi Council, while the sets for Degra's ship had been created for an earlier episode. Although most scenes were filmed between February 12 and 23, the scenes featuring the Sphere-Builders were filmed {{in conjunction with the}} following episode on February 26. Two reviewers praised the episode, and it was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Special Visual Effects. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> increase in ratings with the episode earning a 3.4/5% audience share, translating into approximately 3.35 million viewers.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Kristy in 2006 was a {{relatively}} long-lived tropical cyclone in the 2006 Pacific hurricane season. It developed on August30 from a tropical wave off the southwest coast of Mexico, and quickly intensified to attain hurricane status, reaching peak winds of 80mph (130km/h). Subsequently, Kristy weakened from cooler waters and increased wind shear from Hurricane John to its northeast. Steering currents weakened, and turning to a southerly drift, it weakened to a tropical depression by September2. The next day it briefly regained tropical storm status, only to again deteriorate to depression status. After turning to the west, Kristy encountered marginally favorable conditions and attained tropical storm status for a third time, though unfavorable conditions caused it to dissipate on September9. The storm never affected land, although initially <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> threat to Clarion Island. Within the National Hurricane Center area of warning responsibility east of 140°W, Hurricane Kristy was the longest-lasting tropical cyclone of the season.|$|E

5|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> {{delay in}} {{the start of the}} game as some of the glass needed to be fixed. Once the game was under way it took just 1:50 before the Crunch's Jon Mirasty and the Senators' Jeremy Yablonski engaged in the first fight in Outdoor Classic history. Mirasty had {{previously}} stated {{that he was going to}} be involved in the first outdoor fight. The physical play continued and minutes later at the 3:29 mark Paul Baier and Mike Radja were given matching roughing minor penalties. Not long after the matching minors Mike Blunden made a pass to Alexandre Picard to send him on a breakaway. Picard became the first player to score in an Outdoor Classic when he beat Senators' goaltender Mike Brodeur putting the Crunch up 1–0. The score remained the same at the end of a penalty-filled first period. Eight total penalties were called on the two clubs through the first 20 minutes of the game.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, {{a boxing}} venue was opened in a {{military}} facility known as Cuartel de Ballajá; a fight card was organized weekly. Legislator Lorenzo Coballes Gandía redacted a proposal to legalize boxing, which was signed by governor Horace Mann Towner in May 1927. Consequently, the Primera Comisión Atlética de Boxeo (The First Athletic Boxing Commission) was created; this became the first organization dedicated to sanctioned boxing in Puerto Rico. Estadio Universal (Universal Stadium) became the first venue to organize legal boxing cards. The first event featured a fight between Enrique Chaffardet and Al Clemens as the main event, which was declared a draw by the judges. New stadiums were built in Bayamón, Caguas, Mayagüez, Ponce, Aguadilla and San Juan. The first Puerto Rican to win a world championship was Sixto Escobar, who won it on June 26, 1934. During the 1960s and 1970s, {{there was an increase}} in the number of pugilists who achieved this recognition. Including Wilfred Benítez who on March 6, 1976, became the youngest world champion in history at 17 years old. This tendency continued during the following two decades, reaching its peak between the 1980s and 1990s. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> decline in the 1990s. Félix Trinidad was Puerto Rico's most notable champion during this period. The 2000s brought another increase, as over a dozen boxers won world championships.|$|E

25|$|Auburn Barron-Lutzross {{conducted}} {{an experiment in}} which listeners ranked female speakers {{on a scale from}} “least likely to be a lesbian” to “most likely to be a lesbian”. She found that lesbian speakers were judged as sounding more lesbian than straight speakers. Bisexual speakers patterned with lesbians, although <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> difference between them which was near statistical significance. Listeners in this experiment also ranked speakers on a scale from masculine to feminine. They perceived the straight speakers as significantly more feminine than the lesbian speakers, and the bisexual speakers as slightly more feminine.|$|E
25|$|Newfoundland went decimal in 1865, {{but unlike}} the Province of Canada, New Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, it decided to adopt a unit based on the Spanish dollar {{rather than on the}} U.S. dollar, and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> {{difference}} between these two units. The U.S. dollar was created in 1792 {{on the basis of the}} average weight of a selection of worn Spanish dollars. As such, the Spanish dollar was worth slightly more than the U.S. dollar, and likewise, the Newfoundland dollar, until 1895, was worth slightly more than the Canadian colonial dollar.|$|E

25|$|From early 2002 {{to early}} 2005, the {{exchange}} rate was fairly stable (varying within a band of 4770–4990 manat per US dollar). Starting {{in the spring of}} 2005 <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> but steady increase {{in the value of the}} manat against the US dollar; the reason most likely being the increased flow of petrodollars into the country, together with the generally high price of oil on the world market. At the end of 2005, one dollar was worth 4591 manat. Banknotes below 100 manat had effectively disappeared by 2005, as had the qəpik coins.|$|E
25|$|The {{director}} of the Finnish National Archives, Karl August Bomansson (1827–1906) made the first significant study on the arms of Finland in modern times. He restored {{the appearance of the}} arms in 1886, so that it closely resembled the Uppsala lion. However, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> deviation on how the lion tramples on the saber, and the arched crown with the imperial eagle in the von Köhne version was replaced with a crown similar to that of a German princely crown. This version of the arms was subsequently used {{in the early years of}} Finnish independence.|$|E
25|$|In {{the four}} years of 2000 to 2004, the city had a high of 90 homicides per 100,000 inhabitants.

Among the three major cities in Colombia, Cali has the least investment in security. In 2006 the budget for security in Medellín was {{more than four times}} higher than in Cali, and in Bogota (which is 3.5 times more populous) the budget was more than 7 times higher. In 2008 the rate of homicides was 66 per 100,000 inhabitants; in 2010 it was 80 per 100,000 inhabitants; in 2011 it increased again before dropping in 2012.|$|E

25|$|When {{analysing}} the Dutch model, both disadvantages and advantages can {{be drawn}} when comparing the results with other countries. On a moral argument, tolerating soft drugs {{can be seen as}} the defeat of the government against hedonism. Additionally, decades of growing and perfecting cannabis and hashish has resulted in increased levels of the main active hallucinogenic constituent tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), as levels have doubled, making the derived products more powerful, and therefore requiring less to achieve the desired effect. The coffee shop will lose its license if it caught selling to minors. Though <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> increase of use at the beginning, the rates balanced out some years later. The presence of coffee shops does not translate in public urge for experimentation. In fact, most people that did not consume drugs before the enhancement of the policy continue not to use them.|$|E
25|$|There was {{no change}} {{after the first}} two matches as Gloucestershire beat Glamorgan in two days and Middlesex won the {{difficult}} encounter at Derby. It all went wrong for Gloucestershire at Dean Park, Bournemouth where stubborn Hampshire batting forced a draw while Middlesex were defeating Surrey with some ease. This gave Middlesex a twenty-point lead and only two matches each to be played. Middlesex's victory over the bottom team Northants settled it, especially as Gloucestershire surprisingly lost to Sussex by nine wickets. Even so, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> sting in the tail as Middlesex then lost their final match to a determined Lancashire by 64 runs while Gloucestershire rallied to defeat Essex. The final table showed Middlesex winning by twenty points, {{on the face of}} it a handsome margin, but in reality it was a much closer contest than the figures would suggest.|$|E
25|$|When {{the fifteen}} round format was first {{introduced}} in September 2001, {{the composition of the}} rounds was different from that used by the programme today. The three sections each had five rounds, four letters rounds and one numbers round in each of the first two sections, with three letters rounds, one numbers round and the conundrum in the third section. This meant that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>slight</b> imbalance, whereby one contestant made the letters sections for six rounds, but had the choice of the numbers selection just once, whereas the other contestant chose letters five times and numbers twice. The dictionary corner guest's spot was immediately before the first advertising break, and Susie Dent's Origin of Words spot preceded the second numbers game shortly before the second break. The change to the present format was made on 25 March 2013, three weeks into the second section of Series 68, to comply with Channel 4's decision {{to increase the amount of}} adverts and alter the times when they occur during the programme, therefore reducing Countdown's actual show length from 36 to 35 minutes.|$|E
