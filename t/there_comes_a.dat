500|$|Asked what Masood's {{reactions}} are over Zainab's abuse, Nitin says: [...] "Masood tells Denise, 'It's just {{another one of}} Zainab's dramas', but then <b>there</b> <b>comes</b> <b>a</b> point where he sees bruises on Zainab. Then Masood becomes very concerned for Zainab in a very genuine way. It also might reignite something {{between the two of}} them as well, as they have to work together to solve these problems." [...] The scenes showing Masood and Denise race to the café where Kamil was raised 8.26 million viewers. BBC Three's repeat screening later secured 781k viewers at 10pm.|$|E
500|$|Nixon {{finally got}} a call from Eisenhower at 10pm, Pacific time, Sunday night. Eisenhower {{expressed}} a reluctance to see him leave the ticket, and felt that he should have a chance to make his case to the American people. Nixon enquired if the general would {{be able to make a}} decision on whether to keep him as the running mate immediately after the broadcast, and when Eisenhower equivocated, he angrily burst out: [...] "General, <b>there</b> <b>comes</b> <b>a</b> time in matters like this when you've either got to shit or get off the pot." [...] Eisenhower replied that it might take three or four days to gauge public reaction.|$|E

500|$|In autumn 1928, {{an early}} frost reduced farm incomes by between ten and 25 percent. [...] Farmers began {{to demand the}} {{extension}} of the Debt Adjustment Act over the entire province, along with more radical measures. [...] Citing the example of R. W. Barritt, a farmer near Mirror who had lost his farm at the end of 1928 to Canada Permanent Mortgage Corporation despite diligent efforts to pay off his debt, they demanded legislation that would spread the burden of failed crops between debtor and creditor, rather than leaving it all on farmers. [...] Brownlee rejected such calls: [...] "Unless we are to say that individuals or companies who lend money in this Province in good faith must wait indefinitely for repayment, whatever may be the contract or agreement at the time, <b>there</b> <b>comes</b> <b>a</b> limit {{to the extent to which}} the Government is justified in interfering".|$|E
500|$|Smith {{said that}} he {{believed}} {{that he would be}} remiss in his duty if he allowed Rhodesia to continue to [...] "drift in its present paralysing state of uncertainty", and that following Britain's abandonment of the Federation his government was determined that [...] "the same will never be allowed to happen here". He claimed that UDI did not mark [...] "a diminution in the opportunities which our African people have to advance and prosper in Rhodesia", described [...] "racial harmony in Africa" [...] as part of his agenda and condemned black nationalist activities as attempts to [...] "blackmail the British government into... handing the country over to irresponsible rule". He then attempted to assuage fears that economic sanctions might destroy the economy, and asked Rhodesians to stand firm: [...] "The mantle of the pioneers has fallen on our shoulders... In the lives of most nations <b>there</b> <b>comes</b> <b>a</b> moment when a stand has to be made for principles, whatever the consequences. This moment has come to Rhodesia... the first Western nation {{in the last two decades}} to say 'so far and no further'." [...] He concluded with an assertion that the declaration of independence was [...] "a blow for the preservation of justice, civilisation and Christianity".|$|E
500|$|Moore is {{particularly}} known for playing troubled women, and specializes in [...] "ordinary women who suppress powerful emotions". Oliver Burkeman of The Guardian writes that her characters are typically [...] "struggling {{to maintain a}} purchase on normality {{in the face of}} some secret anguish or creeping awareness of failure". Suzie Mackenzie, also of The Guardian, has identified a theme of [...] "characters in a state of alienation... women who have forgotten or lost themselves. People whose identity is a question." [...] Her performances often include small hints at emotional turmoil, until <b>there</b> <b>comes</b> <b>a</b> point when the character breaks. The journalist Kira Cochrane has identified this as a [...] "trademark moment" [...] in many of her best films, while it has led Burkeman to call her the [...] "queen of the big-screen breakdown". [...] "When she does finally crack," [...] writes journalist Simon Hattenstone, [...] "it's a sight to behold: nobody sobs from the soul quite like Moore." [...] Ben Brantley of The New York Times has praised Moore's ability to subtly reveal the inner-turmoil of her characters, writing that she is [...] "peerless" [...] in her [...] "portraits of troubled womanhood." [...] When it comes to more authoritative roles, Brantley believes she is [...] "a bit of a bore". [...] "Emotional nakedness is Ms. Moore's specialty," [...] he says, [...] "and it's here that you sense the magic she is capable of." ...|$|E

500|$|Bridges re-joined Conference National side Kettering Town on 1 August 2011, {{signing a}} two-year {{deal with the}} club. He joined Kettering on a free transfer, having been out of {{contract}} at Stevenage — [...] "I got injured at {{the back end of}} last season and I was out of contract and because of all the deals that needed to be sorted at Stevenage, I wasn't a priority and I had to wait. <b>There</b> <b>comes</b> <b>a</b> time when you can't wait any longer and I needed to sort my future out so here we are". Bridges made his Kettering Town debut in a 2–0 away win at Lincoln City on 10 September 2011, the club's first away victory of the season. After making just five appearances for Kettering, Bridges was transfer-listed by new manager Mark Stimson on 29 September. Despite being transfer-listed due to Kettering's financial problems, Bridges continued to play in the first-team, and he scored his first goal for the club in a 2–2 draw against Ebbsfleet United, scoring from close range to give the club an initial one-goal lead. Bridges scored once again in a 2–1 home defeat to Grimsby Town on 26 November 2011, scoring in injury-time to half the deficit. Bridges was forced to take training following the departure of Stimson, with only six other Kettering players turning up to train due to unpaid wages. Despite the off-field problems, he remained ever-present {{for the remainder of the}} season, playing 38 times in all competitions, and scoring his third and final goal of the campaign in a 1–1 home draw with Barrow in April 2012. Kettering were relegated, finishing bottom of the league, and faced a further relegation due to entering a Company Voluntary Arrangement. Bridges had one year remaining on his contract at Kettering, but left in July 2012, calling the campaign the [...] "worst of his career".|$|E

2500|$|The {{desire to}} find Shakespearean memorabilia {{everywhere}} properly generates a corresponding skepticism. [...] Yet <b>there</b> <b>comes</b> <b>a</b> point {{when so many}} coincidences that cumulatively fit together so well begin to grow to something of great constancy: a point when mere coincidence begins to seem the less likely hypothesis. It is evident that Vere and Gilbertson memorialised something; it becomes difficult not to believe, despite all necessary scepticism, that that something includes Shakespeare.|$|E
2500|$|He {{wrote of}} an apostle who didn't have the easiest time being a Christian. [...] "Now Paul! Did he {{live in the}} favor of the mighty so that it could commend his {{teaching}}? No, he was a prisoner! Did the wise hail his teaching so that their reputation could guarantee its truth? No, to them it was foolishness. Was his teaching capable of quickly supplying the individual with a supranatural power, did it offer itself for sale to people through legerdemain? No, it had to be acquired slowly, appropriated in the ordeal that began with the renunciation of everything." [...] Would Paul have become a Christian if he knew what was in store for him? Each single individual has a future and <b>there</b> <b>comes</b> <b>a</b> time when a decision is made that can have long-lasting effects. Paul wrote about his own experiences in his epistles and Kierkegaard thought this was a legitimate way to preach about Christianity. But he stressed indirect communication.|$|E
2500|$|Still, a {{happy ending}} is needed, and the Chairman asks the {{audience}} to choose two lovers from among the remaining cast members. The two chosen members declare their love, and then reprise [...] "Perfect Strangers". Just then, <b>there</b> <b>comes</b> <b>a</b> noise from the crypt, and a very-much-alive Edwin Drood appears, ready to tell all what really happened {{on the night of}} his disappearance ("The Writing On The Wall"). What happened was that when Drood was attacked, he was only stunned when he fell and not killed. Jasper dragged him to a crypt where he left him. When Drood woke, he escaped and fled from Cloisterham, only returning so that he could find out who wanted him dead. He sings to the audience, eventually joined {{by the rest of the}} cast, imploring them to hold on to life for as long as they possibly can and telling them that 'holding on to life is all.' The mystery is solved, and the show concludes as the cast sings to the audience to read the writing on the wall.|$|E

2500|$|Asemic {{writing is}} a wordless open {{semantic}} form of writing. The word asemic means [...] "having no specific semantic content," [...] or [...] "without the smallest unit of meaning." [...] With the non-specificity of asemic writing <b>there</b> <b>comes</b> <b>a</b> vacuum of meaning, which is left for the reader to fill in and interpret. All of {{this is similar to}} the way one would deduce meaning from an abstract work of art. Where asemic writing differs from abstract art is in the asemic author's use of gestural constraint, and the retention of physical characteristics of writing such as lines and symbols. Asemic {{writing is a}} hybrid art form that fuses text and image into a unity, and then sets it free to arbitrary subjective interpretations. It may be compared to free writing or writing for its own sake, instead of writing to produce verbal context. The open nature of asemic works allows for meaning to occur across linguistic understanding; an asemic text may be [...] "read" [...] in a similar fashion regardless of the reader's natural language. Multiple meanings for the same symbolism are another possibility for an asemic work, that is, asemic writing can be polysemantic or have zero meaning, infinite meanings, or its meaning can evolve over time. Asemic works leave for the reader to decide how to translate and explore an asemic text; in this sense, the reader becomes co-creator of the asemic work.|$|E
2500|$|Chris is {{questioned}} by the police about the accident. Summer and Natasha later admit that they blame Andrew for the crash and he is slowly pushed out of the group. Sophie's condition starts to improve, but she faces [...] "a long recovery" [...] and is sent away to Sydney to receive treatment. The hand injury Rhys sustained forces him to cancel an impending trip to Japan. His girlfriend, Vanessa Villante (Alin Sumarwata) persuades him to have his injured hand examined {{and he has to}} undergo minor surgery. Rhys later has some tests performed on his hand and is told that he only has a five per cent chance of a full recovery. Barber revealed [...] "He is devastated - becoming a surgeon {{is the most important thing}} to him and he has no plan B. This is a guy who manipulated himself into the surgical programme, it means that much to him." [...] The crash also affects on Andrew's future when he is diagnosed with epilepsy. Andrew begins displaying [...] "worrying neurological symptoms" [...] including; dizziness, severe headaches and black outs. Smith told Brygel [...] "To start with Andrew just ignores the symptoms. He blames them on the crash. He doesn't want to delve into things. But <b>there</b> <b>comes</b> <b>a</b> point where he can't ignore the symptoms anymore." [...] Despite being urged to tell his family and friends about the diagnosis, Andrew tries to deal with it by himself. When Ed eventually wakes up, Natasha [...] "wastes no time" [...] in telling him how she really feels about him and they share a kiss. All About Soap's Claire Crick asked [...] "Could this tragedy finally being them together properly?" ...|$|E
