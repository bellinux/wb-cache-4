5|$|Following her re-election, Roberts was {{nominated}} for the post of House Minority Caucus Chair, but lost the caucus' vote for the post to Rep. Amy Stephens. After losing the vote, Roberts publicly lamented the lack of rural representation in legislative leadership and alleged <b>that</b> <b>Republican</b> lawmakers were threatened with primaries if they voted for her leadership bid.|$|E
5|$|Despite initial {{indications}} otherwise, Mathias {{announced on}} September 27, 1985, {{that he would}} not seek a fourth term. His announcement concerned Republican party officials in the state, who feared that local Republicans had poorer election chances without Mathias {{at the top of the}} ticket. At the national level, Mathias' announcement came shortly after news <b>that</b> <b>Republican</b> Paul Laxalt of Nevada would be retiring as well. The departure of two Republican senators from swing or Democratic-leaning states was treated by Republican party leaders as a poor sign of the party's chances in the upcoming elections. Linda Chavez won the Republican primary for the Senate seat, and she lost the general election to Democrat Barbara Mikulski.|$|E
5|$|He had {{restored}} American {{credit and}} assumed state debt; created a bank, a mint, a coast guard, a customs service, and a diplomatic corps; introduced the first accounting, tax, and budgetary procedures; maintained peace {{at home and}} abroad; inaugurated a navy, bolstered the army, and shored up coastal defenses and infrastructure; proved that the country could regulate commerce and negotiate binding treaties; protected frontier settlers, subdued Indian uprisings, and established law and order amid rebellion, scrupulously adhering all the while to {{the letter of the}} Constitution... Most of all he had shown a disbelieving world <b>that</b> <b>republican</b> government could prosper without being spineless or disorderly or reverting to authoritarian rule.|$|E

5|$|During the U.S. Senate {{election}} in 1940, United States Attorney Maurice Milligan (Jacob Milligan's brother) and former governor Lloyd Stark both challenged Truman in the Democratic primary. Truman was politically weakened by Pendergast's imprisonment for income tax evasion the previous year; the senator had remained loyal, having claimed <b>that</b> <b>Republican</b> judges (not the Roosevelt administration) {{were responsible for}} the boss's downfall. St. Louis party leader Robert E. Hannegan's support of Truman proved crucial; he later brokered the deal that put Truman on the national ticket. In the end, Stark and Milligan split the anti-Pendergast vote in the Senate Democratic primary and Truman won by a total of 8,000 votes. In the November election, Truman defeated Republican Manvel H. Davis by 51–49 percent.|$|E
5|$|Elsewhere, French {{public opinion}} was {{strongly}} {{in favour of}} the outcome of the conference, the only criticism coming from the far left <b>that</b> <b>Republican</b> ships would not receive direct protection. The German mood was restrained, where the press were satisfied by the Soviet exclusion from patrols. In Spain, the Republicans– on the verge of disaster– were largely in favour, and the Nationalists strongly against. The Republicans praised the improved safety of the shipping routes, but were somewhat unhappy that belligerent rights had not been granted to both sides. The Nationalists made several complaints, including one over the route recommended to shipping, but none of these resulted in changes to the agreement. The agreement was welcomed by other members of the League of Nations. Italian historians tend to downplay the importance of the Nyon Conference, often seeing it as a mere extension of the Non-Intervention Committee.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} the nomination, Kemp became the ticket's spokesman for minorities and the inner-city. Due to {{agreement on the}} self-help policy that Louis Farrakhan has endorsed in many fora including the Million Man March, Kemp in a sense aligned himself with Farrakhan. However, Farrakhan was perceived as being anti-Semitic, and Kemp was considered an ally of Republican Jews. This issue necessitated some political sidestepping. As the nominee, Kemp at times overshadowed Dole. In fact, more than once, Kemp was described {{as if he was}} the Presidential nominee. In addition to having overshadowed Dole, despite the negative ad campaigns that the ticket used, Kemp was a very positive running mate who relied on a pep rally type of campaign tour full of football-related metaphors and hyperbole. Although some enjoyed Kemp's style, referring to him as the Good Shepherd, his detractors, such as U.S. News & World Report writer Steven V. Roberts, criticized the extensive use of recounting stories of passing balls relative to the use of recounting stories of passing bills. During the campaign, Kemp expressed the opinion <b>that</b> <b>Republican</b> Party leaders did not stand behind the ticket wholeheartedly. Despite Kemp's voice on minority issues, Colin Powell's support and polls that showed about 30% of blacks identified themselves as conservatives on issues such as school prayer, school vouchers and criminal justice, the Republicans were unable to improve upon historical support levels from African-American voters.|$|E

During the 1928 presidential election, Bilbo helped Al Smith to carry the state by a large margin; he spread stories <b>that</b> <b>Republican</b> Herbert Hoover had socialized with a black woman, so voters should vote against him.|$|E
25|$|Calls from Sinn Féin led the IRA to {{commence}} disarming {{in a process}} that was monitored by Canadian General John de Chastelain's decommissioning body in October 2001. However, following the collapse of the Stormont power-sharing government in 2002, which was partly triggered by allegations <b>that</b> <b>republican</b> spies were operating within Parliament Buildings and the Civil Service, the IRA temporarily broke off contact with General de Chastelain.|$|E
25|$|In September, he {{qualified}} for all 50 state ballots. On October 1, {{he announced his}} intention to re-enter the presidential race. He said <b>that</b> <b>Republican</b> operatives had wanted to reveal compromising photographs of his daughter, which would disrupt her wedding, {{and he wanted to}} spare her from embarrassment. He campaigned in 16 states and spent an estimated $12.3 million of his own money. Perot employed the innovative strategy of purchasing half-hour blocks of time on major networks for infomercial-type campaign advertisements; this advertising garnered more viewership than many sitcoms, with one Friday night program in October attracting 10.5 million viewers.|$|E
50|$|The Mexican American Studies {{course was}} first brought under attack after the Deputy Superintendent of Public Education {{gave a speech}} trying to tell the {{students}} <b>that</b> <b>Republicans</b> don't hate Latinos after an allegation was made <b>that</b> <b>Republicans</b> did. The students {{walked out of the}} speech, and Tom Horne, the Superintendent, blamed the rudeness of the students on the teachers from their Mexican American Studies courses. He called for removal of the courses. When his call was not answered, he made an effort for a bill to be put into law banning Mexican American Studies courses.|$|R

25|$|Of the 105 {{seats in}} Ireland, twenty-five were uncontested {{for a number}} of reasons, not least that the IPP and Sinn Féin had been finding common ground in the {{immediately}} previous period. In some cases it was because there was a certain winner in Sinn Féin. British government propaganda formulated in Dublin Castle and circulated through a censored press alleged <b>that</b> <b>republican</b> militants had threatened potential candidates to discourage non-Sinn Féiners from running. For whatever reason, in the 73 constituencies in which Sinn Féin candidates were elected 25 were returned unopposed (17 were in Munster). The uncontested constituencies that Sinn Féin won subsequently showed high levels of support for republican candidates.|$|E
25|$|From autumn 1937, all T-26 tank {{crews were}} Spanish. In summer 1938, the Republican Army had two {{armoured}} divisions, formed with Soviet help. Turrets from irreparable T-26 and BT-5 tanks and from BA-6 armoured cars were mounted on Chevrolet 1937s and other armoured cars developed and {{produced by the}} Republicans. It should be noted <b>that</b> <b>Republican</b> armour and infantry often suffered from cooperation problems throughout the war. T-26 tanks often attacked enemy trenches or defense positions in the narrow streets of Spanish towns without support, where they met strong resistance. Nationalist infantry, the Moroccans especially, defended courageously despite heavy casualties, throwing hand grenades and gasoline bombs, which are dangerous to tank engines.|$|E
25|$|On March 30, Critz {{received}} {{the endorsement of}} the Pennsylvania AFL-CIO. The next day, Burns {{received the}} endorsement of Minnesota Governor Tim Pawlenty. Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich campaigned for Burns on April 22, while Vice President Joe Biden campaigned for Critz on April 23. On April 26, Burns received the endorsement of former Governor of Alaska and 2008 vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin; while on April 28, Critz received {{the endorsement of the}} United Steelworkers. On May 3, 2010, Burns announced <b>that</b> <b>Republican</b> U.S. Senator Scott Brown of Massachusetts would campaign with him in Washington, Pennsylvania on May 14. The same day, Critz announced that Democratic Governor Joe Manchin of West Virginia would join him at a campaign event.

50|$|Still {{desiring}} to be elected, Gray {{met with}} the Indiana Attorney General and Secretary of State to determine legality of electing a Lieutenant Governor during a midterm election. They both agreed {{that it would be}} legal, so the Secretary of State set forth an announcement that an election for the office would take place in the 1886 mid-term election. Gray hoped <b>that</b> a <b>Republican</b> would be elected, hoping <b>that</b> <b>Republicans</b> would support his bid for the Senate knowing <b>that</b> a <b>Republican</b> would succeed him as governor. Democrats and Republicans each put forward a candidate, and Republican candidate Robert S. Robertson won the election.|$|R

500|$|On 1 October 1933, Socialist left leader Largo Cabellero {{spoke out}} against Lerroux's Republicans, {{suggesting}} the reform programme of the government, and thus {{the basis for the}} Republic itself, was under threat. He warned that if the government itself were the threat, the Socialists would have to withdraw support for it. The following day another Socialist leader, Indalecio Prieto, declared that the Socialists would no longer participate in government, which precipitated its collapse. Alcalá Zamora, who became President in 1931, now requested <b>that</b> <b>Republican</b> Martínez Barrio form a new [...] government. Socialist opposition on both constitutional and ideological grounds meant the PSOE withheld its support for the Barrio government, which was formed on 8 October, but called for fresh elections to be held on 19 November 1933.|$|E
