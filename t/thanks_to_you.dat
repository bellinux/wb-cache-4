500|$|Christian {{is desperate}} to find Aaron and locates his home {{address and phone}} number. Aaron's mother informs him that [...] "Thanks to you, my son took a razor to his wrists; <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> I have lost my son." [...] Believing that Aaron is dead, Christian spends {{the next few days}} {{thinking}} continually about Aaron. Julie discovers an entry about Christian's feelings in his cellphone journal and uses it as the basis for her new song. Christian travels to the Davis home in Idaho, where he tearfully returns Aaron's watch to his mother. During an encounter with Julie, she hesitantly shows him her new video, which upsets Christian, realizing that part of the lyrics came from his personal journal without his consent. Julie tells Christian that she hoped something good would come from it.|$|E
500|$|As Lee {{continued}} his offensive at Gaines's Mill to the east, McClellan played a passive role, taking no initiative {{and waiting for}} events to unfold. He kept two thirds of his army out of action, fooled again by Magruder's theatrical diversionary tactics. That night, he decided to withdraw his army to a safer base, well below Richmond, on {{a portion of the}} James River that was under control of the Union Navy. In doing so, he may have unwittingly saved his army. Lee had assumed that the Union army would withdraw to the east toward its existing supply base and McClellan's move to the south delayed Lee's response for at least 24 hours. But McClellan was also tacitly acknowledging that he would {{no longer be able to}} invest Richmond, the object of his campaign; the heavy siege artillery required would be almost impossible to transport without the railroad connections available from his original supply base on the York River. In a telegram to Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, reporting on these events, McClellan blamed the Lincoln administration for his reversals. [...] "If I save this army now, I tell you plainly I owe no <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> or to any other persons in Washington. You have done your best to sacrifice this army." [...] Fortunately for McClellan, Lincoln never saw that inflammatory statement (at least at that time) because it was censored by the War Department telegrapher.|$|E

For {{as long as the}} winter lasts, {{for as long as the}} centers exist, faced with their brothers dying in poverty, all mankind must be of one will: the will to make this situation impossible. I beg of you, let us love one another enough to do it now. From so much pain, let a wonderful thing be given unto us: the shared spirit of France. Thank you! Everyone can help those who are homeless. We need, tonight, and at the latest tomorrow, five thousand blankets, three hundred big American tents, and two hundred catalytic stoves. Bring them quickly to the Hôtel Rochester, number ninety-two, la Boetie Street. The rendez-vous for volunteers and trucks to carry them: tonight at eleven, in front of the tent on Montagne Sainte-Geneviève. <b>Thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> no man, no child, will sleep on the asphalt or on the waterfronts of Paris tonight.|$|E

6000|$|... "Glory be to God on high!" [...] sang these rude mariners, with hearts {{softened}} by their escapes, dangers, and success, speaking as one man, though modulating their tones to the solemn harmony {{of a religious}} rite--"and on earth peace, good will toward men. We praise thee, we bless thee, we worship thee, we glorify <b>thee,</b> we give <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>thee</b> for thy great glory! O Lord God! Heavenly King! God the Father Almighty!"

2500|$|The {{night of}} June 27, McClellan ordered his entire army to {{withdraw}} to a secure base at Harrison's Landing on the James River. His actions have puzzled military historians ever since. The Union army {{was in a}} good position, having withstood strong Confederate attacks while only deploying one of its five corps in battle. Porter had performed well against heavy odds. Furthermore, McClellan was aware that the War Department had created a new Army of Virginia and ordered it {{to be sent to}} the Peninsula to reinforce him. But Lee had unnerved him, and he surrendered the initiative. He sent a telegram to the Secretary of War that included the statement: [...] "If I save this Army now I tell you plainly that I owe no <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> or any other persons in Washingtonyou have done your best to sacrifice this Army." [...] (The military telegraph department chose to omit this sentence from the copy given to the Secretary.) ...|$|E

Thy own mother knew that, when she took thy {{children}} from thee and cursed thee on her death-bed for thy sins and for thy shame! Thy sons were honest, God-fearing men, but 'tis no <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>thee.</b> Thou alone hast heaped shame upon their dead father's name and hast contrived to wreak ruin on the sons who knew thee not." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Such charity {{as you are}} offering," [...] he cried, [...] "is corruption. <b>You</b> {{are going}} <b>to</b> {{dispense}} things for their carnal welfare, and you do nothing for their immortal souls.

60|$|On the morrow morning, accordingly, our Thirteen set forth; {{or rather}} our Prior and Eleven; for Samson, as general {{servant of the}} party, has to linger, {{settling}} many things. At length he too gets upon the road; and, 'carrying the sealed Paper in a leather pouch hung round his neck; and froccum bajulans in ulnis' (<b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>thee,</b> Bozzy Jocelin), 'his frock-skirts looped over his elbow,' showing substantial stern-works, tramps stoutly along. Away across the Heath, not yet of Newmarket and horse-jockeying; across your Fleam-dike and Devil's-dike, no longer useful as a Mercian East-Anglian boundary or bulwark: continually towards Waltham, and the Bishop of Winchester's House there, for his Majesty is in that. Brother Samson, as purse-bearer, has the reckoning always, when there is one, to pay; 'delays are numerous,' progress none of the swiftest.|$|R

"Now <b>thanks</b> <b>to</b> <b>thee,</b> Hilda, for that," [...] {{said the}} hermit heartily; [...] "not that I boast of being sure to {{accomplish}} what I undertake, yet I never offer to attempt what I have not some reasonable hope {{of being able}} to do. But it is not strange that this old warrior should doubt of the courage or capacity of one who preaches the gospel of peace. Nevertheless, when I was a youth I fought in the army of the great Thorfin, and was somewhat expert {{in the use of the}} bow. It is possible that some of my ancient skill may remain, and I am willing to use it in a good cause.
