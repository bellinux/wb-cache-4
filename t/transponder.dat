5|$|Countries were {{reluctant}} to release information collected from military radar because of sensitivity about revealing their capabilities. Indonesia has an early-warning radar system, but its air traffic control radar did not register any aircraft with the <b>transponder</b> code used by Flight 370, despite the aircraft possibly having flown near, or over, {{the northern tip of}} Sumatra. Indonesian military radar tracked Flight 370 earlier when en route to waypoint IGARI before the <b>transponder</b> is thought to have been turned off, but did not provide information on whether it was detected afterwards. Thailand and Vietnam also detected Flight 370 on radar before the <b>transponder</b> stopped working. The radar position symbols for the <b>transponder</b> code used by Flight 370 vanished after the <b>transponder</b> is thought to have been turned off. Thai military radar detected an aircraft that might have been Flight 370, but it is not known what time the last radar contact was made. The signal did not include identifying data. The flight was also not detected by Australia's conventional or its long-range JORN over-the-horizon radar system, which has an official range of 3,000km, the latter not being in operation {{on the night of the}} disappearance.|$|E
5|$|Homing transponders {{are similar}} to IFF systems in general terms, but used shorter pulses. When a signal was {{received}} from the radar, the <b>transponder</b> responded with a short pulse on the same frequency, the original radar pulse would not be reflected {{so there was no}} need to lengthen the signal as in the case of IFF. The pulse was sent to the Mk. IV's display and appeared as a sharp blip. Depending on the location of the <b>transponder</b> relative to the aircraft, the blip would be longer on the left or right of the azimuth display, allowing the operator to guide the aircraft to the <b>transponder</b> using exactly the same methods as a conventional aircraft intercept.|$|E
5|$|Light goods {{vehicles}} without transponders {{are assessed}} an additional Video Toll. Motorcycles are not charged a video toll {{because there is}} rarely a reasonable place to mount a <b>transponder.</b>|$|E

5|$|<b>Transponder</b> systems used on {{the ground}} provide the ability to home in on the transponder's location, a {{technique}} that was widely used with the Mk. IV, {{as well as many}} other AI and ASV radar systems.|$|E
50|$|This {{satellite}} carries 32 <b>transponders</b> in Ku band/FSS & Ku band/BSS. The spacecraft utilizes Astrium's Eurostar E2000+ {{platform to}} carry 22 C-band <b>transponders</b> (including eight 52 W moderate power <b>transponders)</b> and 12 Ku band <b>transponders.</b>|$|R
50|$|Turksat 2A {{satellite}} {{carries a}} payload of 34 high-powered <b>transponders</b> consisting of 22 33 MHz fixed-beam <b>transponders</b> and 12 36 MHz <b>transponders</b> with two steerable beams.|$|R
50|$|The {{satellite}} {{was built}} by Orbital Sciences using their GEOstar-2 bus. It has 24 C band circular polarized <b>transponders</b> covering the Americas and Western Europe, and 15 linear polarized Ku band <b>transponders</b> covering Latin America. The satellite has 32 C band <b>transponders</b> and 19 Ku band <b>transponders</b> in total to provide for redundancy. Both antennae are 2.5m x 2.7m.|$|R
5|$|Unlike {{most other}} toll highways, Highway 407 {{features}} no toll booths. Rather, {{a system of}} cameras and transponders allows for automatic toll collection. It {{is one of the}} earliest examples of a highway to exclusively use open road tolling. Highway407 is otherwise designed as a normal freeway; interchanges connect directly to surface streets. A radio antenna detects when a vehicle with a <b>transponder</b> has entered and exited the highway, calculating the toll rate. For vehicles without a <b>transponder,</b> an automatic number plate recognition system is used. In both cases, monthly statements are mailed to users. The automatic number plate recognition system is linked to several provincial and U.S. state motor vehicle registries.|$|E
5|$|With a SunPass or E-Pass <b>transponder,</b> a $1.75 toll {{is charged}} at a toll gantry north of Marigold Avenue {{to cross the}} RCMB and an {{additional}} $0.50 toll is charged between Marigold Avenue and KOA Street; the tolls using the pay-by-plate billing system are $1.95 and $0.70, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, some of {{the science}} {{instruments}} and components had their own embedded microprocessor-based control systems. The MATs (Multiple Access <b>Transponder)</b> components, MAT-1 and MAT-2, utilize Hughes Aircraft CDP1802CD microprocessors. The Wide Field and Planetary Camera (WFPC) also utilized an RCA 1802 microprocessor (or possibly the older 1801 version). The WFPC-1 {{was replaced by the}} WFPC-2 during Servicing Mission 1 in 1993, which was then replaced by the Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) during Servicing Mission 4 in 2009.|$|E

5|$|Alvarez made {{numerous}} professional {{contributions to}} aviation. During World War II {{he led the}} development of multiple aviation-related technologies. Several of his projects are described above, including Ground Controlled Approach (GCA) {{for which he was}} awarded the Collier Trophy in 1945. He also held the basic patent for the radar <b>transponder,</b> for which he assigned rights to the U.S. government for $1.|$|E
5|$|Based on its observations, the NTSB {{recommended}} to the FAA that design changes be implemented {{to improve the}} noticeability of TCAS annunciation, and that the FAA advise pilots of all aircraft to become {{more familiar with the}} details of this accident, potential loss of <b>transponder</b> and/or TCAS function, and how to recognize them.|$|E
5|$|Lt. Phillips {{received}} {{permission from}} his superiors {{to fly the}} F-4B with an inoperative <b>transponder.</b> As the fighter proceeded to NAS Fallon in Nevada, the oxygen leak worsened until the system was disabled completely, and the pilot was instructed to fly at low altitude. The Phantom II departed NAS Fallon at 5:16p.m. following a flight plan routing across the Fresno, Bakersfield, and Los Angeles air corridors.|$|E

5|$|The Su-25 {{often has}} radios {{installed}} for air-to-ground and air-to-air communications, including an SO-69 identification-friend-or-foe (IFF) <b>transponder.</b> The aircraft's self-defence suite includes various measures, such as flare and chaff dispensers capable of launching up to 250 flares and dipole chaff. Hostile radar uses are guarded against via an SPO-15 radar warning receiver.|$|E
5|$|The {{collision}} {{occurred at}} 16:56:54 BRT at FL370, {{and it was}} confirmed that neither Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS) system had activated or alerted its respective crew, nor did any crew see the oncoming traffic visually or initiate any evasive action prior to the collision. While both planes were equipped with TCAS, it was later determined that the Embraer's <b>transponder</b> had ceased operating almost an hour earlier, at 16:02, rendering both planes unable to automatically detect each other.|$|E
5|$|The first {{combination}} {{flew through}} poor weather conditions {{and managed to}} reach Norway and fly towards its objective. During the flight over Norway the Rebecca receiver, {{which was supposed to}} pick up the <b>transponder</b> signal from the Eureka beacons being used by the Norwegian SOE agents, developed a mechanical problem and was unable to pick up the signal. This left the aircrew with only map-reading available to locate the landing zone, but the poor weather made this almost impossible.|$|E
5000|$|The Anik B {{satellite}} had twelve C-band <b>transponders</b> {{like the}} Anik As, {{with an additional}} six [...] <b>transponders.</b>|$|R
25|$|MEASAT 1 {{had five}} {{high-power}} <b>transponders</b> in Ku band for the direct-to-user service, powered by 112-watt traveling-wave tube amplifiers. The regional service to Malaysia was provided on 12 <b>transponders</b> in C band, using 12-watt solid state amplifiers. MEASAT-2 had 11 active <b>transponders</b> in Ku band. Eight of these use 95-watt traveling-wave amplifiers, and three have 62 watts. MEASAT-2 also had six active <b>transponders</b> in C band, powered by 12-watt solid-state amplifiers.|$|R
50|$|Launching of the {{spacecraft}} is planned for 2019. It {{will be in a}} geosynchronous orbit positioned at 42° East with an expected on-orbit life time of at least 15 years. It will consist of 16 Ku band <b>transponders,</b> additionally 4 in reserve as well as two active and one in reserve X band <b>transponders.</b> The Ku band <b>transponders</b> will have a bandwidth of 7.3-18.1 GHz for uplink and 11.7-12.75 GHz downlink bandwidth. Each of the Ku band <b>transponders</b> will have a minimum power of 140 W and the X band <b>transponders</b> at least 150 W each.|$|R
5|$|Dein in the {{meantime}} pursued an offer from a television consortium, funded by the Swiss Bank Corporation (SBC). They intended to create a football-only channel, available on the Astra satellite <b>transponder.</b> The Observer believed {{that in addition to}} broadcasting league matches, SBC would offer a selection of top clubs fees for airing matches against their European counterparts. Dein was impressed by the proposal – financier Chris Akers forecasted profits of up to £50 million – so he forwarded it to Parry. Although he too was impressed, SBC's offer eventually failed because of sponsorship doubts.|$|E
5|$|Sprint was {{the primary}} weapon of Nike-X as {{originally}} conceived; {{it would have been}} placed in clusters around the targets being defended by the MAR system. Each missile was housed in an underground silo and was driven into the air before launch by a gas-powered piston. The missile was initially tracked by the local MSR, which would hand off tracking to the MAR as soon as it became visible. A <b>transponder</b> in the missile could respond to signals from either the MAR or MSR for accurate tracking.|$|E
5|$|In June 2004, Fletcher's {{aircraft}} {{caused a}} security scare that triggered a brief evacuation of the U.S. Capitol and Supreme Court building. Shortly after takeoff {{en route to}} memorial services for former president Ronald Reagan, the <b>transponder</b> on Fletcher's plane malfunctioned, leading officials at Reagan National Airport to report an unauthorized aircraft entering restricted airspace. Two F-15 fighters were dispatched to investigate, and Fletcher's plane was escorted to its destination by two Blackhawk helicopters. The plane, a 33-year-old Beechcraft King Air, was the oldest of its model still in operation. An investigation by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) found that the crew of Fletcher's plane maintained radio contact with air traffic officials and received clearance to enter the restricted air space. The investigation determined that miscommunication by air traffic controllers sparked the panic, and {{in the aftermath of}} the incident, the FAA adopted policies to prevent future errors of a similar nature.|$|E
