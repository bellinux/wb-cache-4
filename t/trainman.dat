500|$|William S. Andrews of Syracuse was a 69-year-old judge, {{noted for}} his scholarship, {{who had been}} on the Court of Appeals since 1917. The son of Charles Andrews, a former Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, William Andrews is best remembered today because he wrote an opinion in Palsgraf. In that dissent, he was joined by Judges Frederick E. Crane and John F. O'Brien. Andrews began with a brief recitation of facts: that a {{railroad}} employee had negligently dislodged the package, the contents of which the <b>trainman</b> was unaware, and the subsequent explosion broke the scale and injured the plaintiff, [...] "an intending passenger". Andrews noted the fundamental difference among the judges concerning the law of negligence: whether there must be a duty to the plaintiff, the breach of which injured her, and whether, when there is an act that is a threat to the safety of others, the doer of it should be [...] "liable for all its proximate consequences, even where they result in injury to one who would generally be thought to be outside the radius of danger". Andrews believed that if there was a negligent act, the proximate cause of injury to the plaintiff, that should establish liability.|$|E

6000|$|The six-foot {{drivers were}} {{hammering}} {{their way to}} San Bernardino and the Mohave wastes, but this was no grade for speed. That would come later. The heat of the desert followed {{the heat of the}} hills as they turned east to the Needles and the Colorado River. The car cracked in the utter drought and glare, and they put crushed ice to Mrs. Cheyne's neck, and toiled up the long, long grades, past Ash Fork, toward Flagstaff, where the forests and quarries are, under the dry, remote skies. The needle of the speed-indicator flicked and wagged to and fro, the cinders rattled on the roof, and a whirl of dust sucked after the whirling wheels. The crew of the combination sat on their bunks, panting in their shirt-sleeves, and Cheyne found himself among them shouting old, old stories of the railroad that every <b>trainman</b> knows, above the roar of the car. He told them about his son, and how the sea had given up its dead, and they nodded and spat and rejoiced with him; asked after [...] "her, back there," [...] and whether she could stand it if the engineer [...] "let her out a piece," [...] and Cheyne thought she could. Accordingly the great fire-horse was [...] "let out" [...] from Flagstaff to Winslow, till a division superintendent protested.|$|E
60|$|I do {{not know}} what polite offers from him had already brought out the thanks in which our speech bewrayed us; but at our outlandish accents they at once became easier. They became frankly at home with themselves, and talked in their Andalusian patter with no fear of being understood. I might, indeed, have been far apter in Spanish without {{understanding}} their talk, for when printed the Andalusian dialect varies as far from the Castilian as, say, the Venetian varies from the Tuscan, and when spoken, more. It may then be reduced almost wholly to vowel sounds, and from the lips of some speakers it is really no more consonantal than if it came from the beaks of birds. They do not lisp the soft c or the z, as the Castilians do, but hiss them, and lisp the s instead, as the reader will find amusingly noted in the Sevillian chapters of The Sister of San Sulpice, which are the most charming chapters of that most charming novel. At the stations there were sometimes girls and sometimes boys with water for sale from stone bottles, who walked by the cars crying it; and there were bits of bright garden, or there were flowers in pots. There were also poor little human flowers, or call them weeds, if you will, that suddenly sprang up beside our windows, and moved their petals in pitiful prayer for alms. They always sprang up on the off side of the train, so that the trainmen could not see them, but I hope no <b>trainman</b> in Spain would have had the heart to molest them. As a matter of taste in vegetation, however, we preferred an occasional effect of mixed orange and pomegranate trees, with their perennial green and their autumnal red. We were, in fact, so spoiled by the profusion of these little human flowers, or weeds, that we even liked the change to the dried stalk of an old man, flowering at top into a flat basket of pale-pink shrimps. He gave us our first sight of sea-fruit, when we had got, without knowing it, to Seville Junction. There was, oddly enough, no other fruit for sale there; but there was a very agreeable-looking booth {{at the end of the}} platform placarded with signs of Puerto Rico coffee, cognac, and other drinks; and outside of it there were wash-basins and clean towels. I {{do not know}} how an old woman with a blind daughter made herself effective in the crowd, which did not seem much preoccupied with the opportunities of ablution and refection at that booth; but perhaps she begged with her blind daughter's help while the crowd was busy in assorting itself for Cadiz and Seville and Malaga and Cordova and other musically syllabled mothers of history and romance.|$|E
40|$|Operational {{testing of}} {{railroad}} <b>trainmen</b> on federal government safety rules {{is a daily}} occurrence on every railroad in the United States. This constant testing and resulting discipline distracts <b>trainmen</b> from the task at hand, causing a loss of focus {{which could lead to}} injury or accidents. Using the social construction framework, this research sought to gain an understanding of <b>trainmen</b> 2 ̆ 7 s perception on how operational testing impacts their workplace safety, as well as how they perceive the U. S. federal government influences regulation and discipline. This phenomenological study investigated a segment of railroad employees, the <b>trainmen,</b> because they are operationally tested more than other employees. A representative sample of <b>trainmen</b> (n = 20), managers (n = 7), retirees (n = 4), and U. S. federal government officials (n = 4) who oversee railroad safety, were interviewed using a semistructured interview protocol. The transcribed interviews were analyzed for patterns and trends of safety and testing outcomes. The software analysis provided frequencies of qualitative features in the participants 2 ̆ 7 responses such as stressor words and fear of discipline. Government reports regarding incident rates across U. S. railroads demonstrated that private rail companies are about equal in their incident rates. Considering incidents occur equally, the interviewees indicated that some companies test more frequently than others. This study concluded that excessive operational testing does not positively impact safety nor reduce incidents, but creates a potential for distraction among <b>trainmen.</b> By taking the opinion of employees into consideration, railway managers can create a safer work environment, as well as a more coherent and less stressful workplace for their employees...|$|R

40|$|Background : Subjective hearing {{symptoms}} {{experienced by}} the locomotive <b>trainmen</b> is one indication of their health problems, particularly related to the hearing that occurs due to noise. The high intensity and long-term exposure noise {{experienced by the}}m and the unavailability of ear plug for them may cause their subjective hearing symptoms. Method : A survey research using cross-sectional design was implemented in this study. One hundred and six locomotive <b>trainmen</b> were selected using simple random sampling technique. The data were analyzed by mean of univariate and bivariate statistics such as chi-square statistic. Results : The results showed that two of four independent variables {{were significantly associated with}} subjective hearing symptoms. These were the length of exposure (p-value: 0. 018) and intensity noise (p-value: 0. 018). Conclusion : The locomotive <b>trainmen</b> suffered from subjective hearing symptoms.
