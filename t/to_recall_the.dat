5|$|Remember Last Night? is a 1935 American mystery comedy film {{directed}} by James Whale. The film, {{based on the}} novel The Hangover Murders, is about the investigation of the murder of {{one of a group of}} friends. The survivors are unable <b>to</b> <b>recall</b> <b>the</b> events of the night of the murder because they were all too drunk. Remember Last Night? features an ensemble cast headed by Edward Arnold, Constance Cummings, and Robert Young.|$|E

5|$|There {{were two}} annual festivals in the city.

Both celebrations were instituted by Adud al-Dawla on the model of the holiday of Nowruz, the Iranian New Year.|$|E
5|$|Alexios was {{replaced}} as commander by John Tarchaneiotes, first cousin of Andronikos II, and {{disappeared from the}} scene for 30 years. His successors proved greatly inferior, and by 1323, Byzantine possessions in Asia had been greatly reduced. At that point, Patriarch Jesaias urged Andronikos <b>to</b> <b>recall</b> <b>the</b> aged general. A desperate Andronikos agreed and pardoned Alexios in 1324. Alexios was tasked with relieving the isolated exclave of Philadelphia, which had been long under siege {{and was ready to}} fall. He was given no army, but, according to the Byzantine chroniclers, the mere news of Alexios's approach, and the respect in which the Turks held him, was enough for the siege to be lifted. Alexios was appointed governor of the city, a position he retained until 1327.|$|E
5|$|Charles Domery (later {{also known}} as Charles Domerz) was born in Benche, Poland, in around 1778. From the age of 13, Domery had an unusually large appetite. He was one of nine brothers, all of whom Domery said {{suffered}} from the same condition. Domery recalled {{that his father was}} a hearty eater and generally ate his meat half-boiled, but was too young <b>to</b> <b>recall</b> <b>the</b> quantity. The only illness Domery was aware of in the family was an outbreak of smallpox in his youth, which was survived by all the family.|$|E

5|$|Grand Theft Auto III was {{initially}} released in Australia with an MA15+ classification. After re-reviewing the game, the Office of Film and Literature Classification (OFLC) banned it, {{due to its}} depiction of sexual content and violence to prostitutes. This prompted distributor Take-Two Interactive {{to appeal to the}} OFLC, who reaffirmed the banned status on 11 December 2001, after reanalysing the game and seeking the professional opinion of a forensic psychologist. This prompted Take-Two <b>to</b> <b>recall</b> <b>the</b> game in Australia, and Rockstar to make appropriate changes to the game; a modified version was re-released with an MA15+ classification in January 2002, removing all instances of sexual acts with prostitutes.|$|E
5|$|Harp and Mayer {{conducted}} an experiment using a lesson about lightning strikes. The effect of lightning strikes on airplanes was added as a seductive detail. In {{six out of}} six experiments, learners who studied the base lesson without the seductive details about the strikes on airplanes demonstrated they were {{three times more likely}} <b>to</b> <b>recall</b> <b>the</b> structurally important details. They also performed much better on a problem-solving task than learners whose lessons included the seductive details. Harper and Mayer suggested seductive details do their damage when learners are consolidating and organizing new information by forming knowledge structures ill-suited for later recall.|$|E
5|$|Later populist {{attempts}} to introduce similarly broad-reaching redistributive legislation enlisted {{the support of}} Gaius Marius, a great general, which was then elected to a string of unprecedented consecutive consulships, which also violated Roman law, which mandated a decade between consulships, further weakening the primarily norms-based constitution. The attempts <b>to</b> <b>recall</b> <b>the</b> general Sulla led to his marching on Rome in 88BC, installing two new consuls and forcing major reforms of the constitution at sword-point, before leaving a campaign in the East. This further strengthened the precedent that the Republic's constitution was malleable.|$|E
5|$|Financial {{donations}} {{were also}} an issue. Bloomberg and Broad donated $350,000 and $250,000, respectively, {{to support the}} Senators. The Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee also spent $250,000 <b>to</b> oppose <b>recall.</b> <b>The</b> NRA spent over $108,000 <b>to</b> support <b>the</b> <b>recall</b> efforts.

5|$|On May 7, 2009, {{a second}} motion <b>to</b> <b>recall</b> <b>the</b> bill from committee, {{initiated}} by Senator Les Ihara, Jr., was successful after 10Democrats {{voted in favor}}. The Senate Democratic Leadership, Democrats opposed to civil unions, and Senate Republicans {{voted in favor of}} an amendment to the bill that added language reaffirming the distinction between civil unions and marriage and allowing same-sex and opposite-sex couples to enter civil unions. The amendment was adopted, which killed the bill, as a revised version required renewed approval by the Hawaii House of Representatives and the Legislature adjourned May 8, 2009. Senate President Hanabusa stated the issue would not be taken up again before 2010.|$|E
5|$|Theophilos now {{undertook}} {{a serious effort}} to relieve Sicily: he assembled a large army and placed it {{under the command of}} his son-in-law, the Caesar Alexios Mousele. Mousele arrived in Sicily in spring 838, in time to relieve the fortress of Cefalù from a Muslim attack. Mousele scored a number of successes against Muslim raiding parties but, back in Constantinople, his enemies launched accusations of contacts with the Arabs and designs on the throne. Furthermore, the death of his infant wife, Maria, cut his link to Theophilos, and the Emperor sent the archbishop of Syracuse, Theodore Krithinos, <b>to</b> <b>recall</b> <b>the</b> Caesar to Constantinople in 839.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{noticing that}} his bar was empty, the present-day Moe {{arrives at the}} Simpsons' home and begins <b>to</b> <b>recall</b> <b>the</b> events of that day. He remembers that while they sat by a fire that night, they saw a near-meltdown at the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant. The next day, {{they go to the}} old quarry for a swim, and Homer jumps in, only to find that there was no water but only mud. However, Homer recalls that there was no water in the quarry because {{something}} was blocking the inlet pipe. When Homer unblocks it, he finds a rotting corpse in it, causing him to scream.|$|E

5|$|When the First World War broke out, the East Asia Squadron {{consisted}} of Scharnhorst, Gneisenau, Emden, Nürnberg, and Leipzig. At the time, Nürnberg was {{returning from the}} west coast of the United States, where Leipzig had just replaced her, and Emden was still in Tsingtao. On 6 August 1914, Scharnhorst, Gneisenau, the supply ship Titania, and the Japanese collier Fukoku Maru were still in Ponape. Von Spee had issued orders <b>to</b> <b>recall</b> <b>the</b> light cruisers, which had been dispersed on cruises around the Pacific. Nürnberg joined von Spee that day, after which Spee moved his ships to Pagan Island in the Northern Mariana Islands, a German possession in the central Pacific.|$|E
5|$|After tricking {{his wife}} Marge {{into believing that}} {{the model for the}} Burly paper towel {{corporation}} Chad Sexington would have dinner with the Simpsons, Homer takes the family to the Pimento Grove to watch live performers as compensation. One of the acts is a hypnotist called Mesmerino. Homer volunteers, and Mesmerino hypnotizes him into thinking he is twelve years old again. As Homer starts to reminisce, he starts screaming incessantly all through the night. The next day, Homer's co-workers Lenny and Carl bring him home early from work, still screaming. They finally manage to calm him down with some Yaqui tea. He starts <b>to</b> <b>recall</b> <b>the</b> events leading up to the scream-inducing incident. In a flashback, Homer, Lenny, and Carl are hiking in the woods and are confronted by a young Fat Tony, but they are saved by a young Moe.|$|E
5|$|Finally, at the 30 Rock studios, after overhearing Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) impersonating Elmo from Sesame Street while Pete was {{encouraging}} {{his son to}} do better with his potty training, Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) compares Pete's relationship with his wife to that of Samson and Delilah. While working late at night in his office, Tracy enters with Grizz (Grizz Chapman) and Dot Com (Kevin Brown) {{and a couple of}} other people, which turns into a party. Pete is still working, while Tracy's entourage enjoy themselves. Tracy encourages Pete to loosen up, and asks one of the women, Vicki (April Lee Hernández), to look after him. Pete finally loosens up and begins to give in to Vicki's temptations, but NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) sets him straight, telling him <b>to</b> <b>recall</b> <b>the</b> day that he got married.|$|E

5|$|In 1640 Charles {{attempted}} {{again to}} enforce his authority, opening a second Bishops' War. He recalled the English Parliament, {{known as the}} Short Parliament, but disbanded it after it declined to vote a new subsidy and was critical of his policies. He assembled a poorly provisioned and poorly trained army. The Scots moved south into England, forcing a crossing of the Tyne at Newburn {{to the west of}} Newcastle-upon-Tyne, then occupying the city and eventually most of Northumbria and Durham. This gave them a stranglehold on the vital coal supply to London. Charles was forced to capitulate, agreeing to most of the Covenanter's demands and paying them £830 a month to support their army. This forced him <b>to</b> <b>recall</b> <b>the</b> English Parliament, known as the Long Parliament, which, in exchange for concessions, raised the sum of £200,000 to be paid to the Scots under the Treaty of Ripon. The Scots army returned home triumphant. The king's attempts to raise a force in Ireland to invade Scotland from the west prompted a widespread revolt there and as the English moved to outright opposition that resulted in the outbreak of the English Civil War in 1642, he was facing rebellion in all three of his realms.|$|E
5|$|Initially, {{their two}} assaults across the Fontanone stream near Marengo village were repelled, and General Jean Lannes {{reinforced}} the French right. Bonaparte realised the true position and issued orders at 11:00 am <b>to</b> <b>recall</b> <b>the</b> detachment under Général de Division (GdD) Louis Desaix, while moving his reserve forward. On the Austrian left, Ott’s column had taken Castel Ceriolo, and its advance guard moved south to attack Lannes’s flank. Melas renewed the main assault and the Austrians broke the central French position. By 2:30 pm the French were withdrawing and Austrian dragoons seized the Marengo farm. Bonaparte had by then arrived with the reserve, but Berthier’s troops {{began to fall}} back on the main vine belts. Knowing Desaix was approaching, Bonaparte was anxious about a column of Ott’s soldiers marching from the north, so he deployed his Consular Guard infantry to delay it. The French then withdrew steadily eastward toward San Giuliano Vecchio as the Austrians formed a column to follow them in line with Ott’s advance in the northern sector.|$|E
5|$|On February 23, 1991, {{at about}} 8:23 PM, a fire {{began on the}} 22nd floor of the {{building}}. It was a Saturday night and {{there were only three}} people in the building at the time, an engineer and two security guards. Workers had been refinishing woodwork in a vacant office earlier in the day and workers left a pile of rags soaked in linseed oil on the floor. The linseed oil oxidized and generated enough heat to ignite the rags, which then set fire to other solvents nearby. Smoke detectors did not cover the entire floor {{and by the time the}} fire alarm went off the fire was already well established. After the fire alarm sounded in the building the engineer went up to the 22nd floor to investigate. When the elevator reached the 22nd floor the engineer found heavy smoke and heat that prevented him from reaching the elevator controls he needed to return to the lobby. The engineer escaped after radioing to a security guard in the lobby <b>to</b> <b>recall</b> <b>the</b> elevator using fire safety controls there. The second security guard was on the 30th floor when the alarm went off and used the stairwell to get to the ground floor.|$|E
