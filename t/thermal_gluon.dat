40|$|We {{calculate}} the effective Lagrangian for {{a magnetic field}} in spinor, scalar and vector QED. Connections are then made to $SU(N_C) $ Yang [...] Mills theory and QCD. The magnetization and the corresponding effective charge are obtained from the effective Lagrangian. The renormalized vacuum magnetization {{will depend on the}} renormalization scale chosen. Regardless of this, the effective charge decreasing with the magnetic field, as in QCD, corresponds to anti- screening and asymptotic freedom. In spinor and scalar QED on the other hand, the effective charge is increasing with the magnetic field, corresponding to screening. Including effects due to finite temperature and density, we comment on the effective charge in a degenerate fermion gas, increasing linearly with the chemical potential. Neglecting the tachyonic mode, we find that in hot QCD the effective charge is decreasing as the inverse temperature, in favor for the formation of a quark-gluon plasma. However, including the real part of the contribution from the tachyonic mode, we find instead an effective charge increasing with the temperature.

40|$|Electric and {{magnetic}} screenings of the <b>thermal</b> <b>gluons</b> are studied {{by using the}} background expansion method in a gluodynamic model with dimension- 2 gluon condensate. At low temperature, the electric {{and magnetic}} gluons are degenerate.

The electric screening mass changes rapidly with temperature when $T>T_ 0 $, and the Polyakov loop expectation value rises sharply around $T_ 0 $ from zero in the vacuum to a value around 0. 8 at high temperature. This suggests that the color electric deconfinement phase transition is driven by electric gluons. It is also observed that the magnetic screening mass keeps almost the same as its vacuum value, which manifests that the magnetic gluons remains confined.

In the vanishing light-quark mass limit, we find κ_^ LO∝α_s^ 2 T eB in the leading order that arises from screened Coulomb scatterings with (1 + 1) -dimensional LLL quarks, while κ_∥ gets no contribution from the scatterings with LLL quarks due to kinematic restrictions.

Based on a schematic approach, we find that the calculated suppression of the ϒ(2 S) and ϒ(3 S) states relative to ϒ(1 S) is consistent with the CMS result, but allows for additional suppression mechanisms.

This potential is non-spherical, but axially symmetric about the direction of v. We solve the Schrodinger equation for the relative motion of the quarks in this potential, and use the bound-state wavefunction as the initial state for the dissociation of the meson. The meson lifetime is thus determined as a function of v and T, and conclusions are drawn concerning the possibility of detection of the meson in a high-energy heavy-nucleus collision.

40|$|Within {{a simple}} thermal model we {{estimate}} possible multiplicities of glueballs in central Au+Au collisions {{in a broad}} range of bombarding energies. Assuming the glueball mass in the region 1. 5 – 1. 7 GeV, the model predicts on average 0. 6 – 1. 5 glueballs per event at the energy GeV. Glueballs are probably the most interesting particles predicted by the QCD but not established experimentally yet. Their mass is estimated in the range 1. 5 – 1. 7 GeV but uncertainty is introduced by the mixing with the states (see recent discussion in Ref. [1]). We think that relativistic heavy-ion collisions might be a right tool to produce and study these exotic particles. If the quark–gluon plasma is indeed produced in such collisions, then a significant fraction, more than 30 %, of its entropy should be represented by <b>thermal</b> <b>gluons.</b> If these gluons survive until the hadronization stage, they will inevitably form glueballs as two-gluon bound states. Analyses of experimental data on hadron production in relativistic heavy-ion collisions show [2, 3] that ratios of hadron multiplicities are well reproduced within a simple thermal model. It is assumed that all hadrons are formed in an equilibrated system characterized by a certain volume and the temperature. Following Refs. [2, 4] we introduce a strangeness suppression factor accounting for deviations from chemical equilibrium for hadrons, containing nonzero number of strange quarks and antiquarks. In our previous paper [5] we have used this model to predict possible yields of exotic baryonia. In this paper we apply the same model with the same parameters to estimate expected yields of glueballs, assuming that they are in thermal equilibrium with other hadrons. In order to eliminate unknown volume we consider the ratio of the glueball multiplicity to the multiplicity of mesons.
