Two-thirds of agricultural GDP is produced on the Pacific coastal strip, a region totally dependent on irrigation due to low rainfall. High-value crops and irrigation technology have had a major impact on the coast's rural development. In 2001, rural poverty in the region was 5.2%.

30|$|Corn used in {{the alcohol}} {{industry}} has led <b>to</b> <b>record</b> <b>prices</b> of over $ 8 per bushel in 2011, the demand has stimulated the planting of corn crops over the Corn Belt, and {{it is estimated that}} close to 90 million acres were planted in 2011 (USDA, 2011). Ethanol production from corn requires substantial amount of water (Mubako and Lant, 2008), part of it is consumed by evaporation from cooling towers and evaporators during distillation. For example, some ethanol plants in the US use from 3.5 to 6 gallons of water per gallon of ethanol produced (Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, 2006). Modern ethanol plants employ expensive water treatment technologies allowing unconsumed process water to be recycled within the plant, or discharged to freshwater sources (Huffaker, 2010). Mishra and Yeh (2010) estimated that the water requirement (gal/gal EtOH) to produce ethanol from corn was 2.72 and 4.11 for dry and wet milling respectively. Water demands of biorefineries, while modest compared with the irrigation demands of biofuel crops, could substantially affect local water users.|$|E

The food audits will assist the Chippewa Health Improvement Partnership (CHIP), the Nutrition Coalition of Chippewa County, and Burnett County to determine if interventions are needed to increase availability. In August, 2011 and December, 2011, establishments were audited in Chippewa County and Burnett County. The establishments included farmers ’ markets, convenience stores, and grocery stores. A walk-through was completed <b>to</b> <b>record</b> <b>prices</b> and availability of fruits, vegetables, skim and 1 % milk, and organic fruits and vegetables. Burnett County had cheaper milk prices in the winter and Chippewa County had a wider range of 1 % milk prices in the summer. There were a limited amount of fruits and vegetables offered at the farmers ’ markets and convenience stores in Chippewa County. In Burnett County, more fruits and vegetables were available in the winter. In Chippewa County, all vegetables surveyed were available in both seasons and more varieties of fruit were available in summer. There were price differences for many fresh fruits and vegetables between summer and winter. The number and prices of organic fruits and vegetables in Burnett County remained the same from summer to winter, except russet (Idaho) potatoes. More organic fruits and vegetables were available in the summer in Chippewa County. All of the organic fruits and vegetables were more 3 expensive than the same non-organic varieties, except for oranges.

40|$|Context]: In Spain, {{the release}} of farm-reared {{partridges}} to hunt is increasingly used, despite being thought to affect sustainability of wild stocks and to reduce the need of natural habitats for game. [Aims]: To explore the market value as a possible incentive for current management, we evaluated within {{a segment of the}} red-legged partridge hunting market whether the use of farm-reared birds (as opposed to wild stock) or the naturalisation of landscapes are affecting the hunt market price. [Methods]: We considered estates that sell individual hunting days and contacted buyers through advertisements. We gathered all advertisements for the 2010 season in four top hunting magazines and two websites, and conducted a telephone survey <b>to</b> <b>record</b> <b>price</b> and associated characteristics of hunts. We looked for relationships between price and the characteristics of sold hunts, using general linear models. [Key results]: Hunts varied largely in price, but neither restocking nor naturalisation of the landscape explained price variation, at least within our sample of estates. The absence of price difference between wild or released partridges could be reflecting the current difficulty to distinguish both kinds of products in the market. [Conclusions]: Market forces alone might not be promoting the public interest of the sustainable use of wild stocks versus industrial hunting based on farm-reared birds. [Implications]: If promoting conservation and sustainable use of wild stocks is considered a major goal of official institutions in charge of biodiversity conservation and game management, they should promote reliable ways of identifying estates selling wild or restocked partridges, and they should also evaluate benefits and costs associated with hunting farm-reared birds relative to wild birds, so as to help internalise these costs and benefits if necessary. A study of the determinants of hunter demands would also help explain variation in supply and market prices.
