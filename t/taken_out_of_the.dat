5|$|According to Pfälzner, a final burial stage can be noticed, {{which he}} calls the {{quaternary}} burial. Tomb VII, which most probably contained remains <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> royal hypogeum, seems to have worked as a storage for the remains of individuals whose Kispu cycle came to an end; very few bowls were found in that tomb. The Kispu was important for demonstrating {{the legitimacy of the}} king, thus it needed to be public and visible to a large crowd; Pfälzner suggests that hall A in the royal palace was the place for the public Kispu and that the antechamber of the royal hypogeum was dedicated for private Kispu that included only the king and the spirits of his ancestors.|$|E

5|$|According to The Pride of the Yankees, the 1942 {{film about}} Gehrig's life, Pipp asked {{out of the}} game because he was {{experiencing}} double vision from being hit in the head two days prior. By 1953, Pipp reported to The New York Times that he was <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lineup due to being hit in the head by a pitch thrown by Charlie Caldwell during batting practice. However, while Pipp was hit in the head by a pitch from Caldwell and was hospitalized, this event occurred on July 2, a month after Pipp's benching.|$|E
5|$|Against Georgia, most critics thought Maryland faced {{its first}} true test. In the first quarter, the Terrapins {{took a quick}} 14–0 lead and held the Bulldogs to six {{offensive}} plays, two of which were punts. In the second quarter, Georgia quarterback Zeke Bratkowski led his team to two consecutive touchdown drives, and the score was 21–13 in favor of Maryland at halftime. Two minutes into the third quarter, Faloney intercepted a Bratkowski pass and returned it for a touchdown. Bratkowski was <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game after numerous sacks by Stan Jones and Bob Morgan. The 40–13 final result {{would be the most}} points the Terrapins allowed during the entire season.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} {{to look through the}} history of biology from the ancient Greeks onwards and discover anticipations of almost all of Charles Darwin's key ideas.

5|$|On April 23, 2017, Miller was <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{game after}} being {{diagnosed}} with an apparent elbow injury. The next day, on April 24, Miller {{was put on the}} 10-day disabled list. After MRI tests, it was revealed that Miller's right elbow was diagnosed with a strained flexor strain and a partially torn UCL. On April 29, Miller announced that he would have Tommy John surgery, therefore ending his 2017 season. He officially underwent the surgery on May 10. Miller started four games, with a 2-2 record and 4.09 ERA in 22 innings. Due to Swanson's top prospect status, Inciarte's All-Star nod, Miller's extremely underwhelming 2016 season and Miller's season-ending injury in 2017, the trade has been panned as one of the worst in recent memory.|$|E

It may also be set aside for next Christmas Eve, to be placed on the fire immediately before the new badnjak, as a symbol of continuity. In Kosovo, a part of the badnjak is preserved and burned again on New Years Day and Epiphany.|$|E

5|$|Parseghian {{quickly turned}} things around in 1964, re-establishing {{a sense of}} {{confidence}} and team spirit that had been lost under Kuharich and Devore. Practices were carefully planned and organized {{with the help of}} a coaching staff that consisted of three assistants from Northwestern and four former Notre Dame players. Parseghian listened to players' concerns about the program and addressed them. He updated the team's offense by favoring passing and bringing in smaller and quicker players. A rule change allowing unlimited substitutions starting in 1964 helped make this strategy successful; fast-running receivers could now be <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game and rested as others replaced them.|$|E

During a game against the Detroit Tigers on July 1, Wilson blew a save for a second straight game and was <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game by Bruce Bochy. Upon entering the dugout, Wilson took out his frustrations by throwing a Gatorade cooler and smashing it with a bat. The Giants still won the game 4–3 as Jeremy Affeldt got the save.

5|$|Although never {{losing its}} significance, the cathedral {{subsequently}} suffered centuries of virtual neglect. In 1441 it was restored as catholicosate and remains as such to this day. Since then the Mother See of Holy Etchmiadzin {{has been the}} administrative headquarters of the Armenian Church. Etchmiadzin was plundered by the Safavids in 1604, when relics and stones were <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cathedral to New Julfa {{in an effort to}} undermine Armenians' attachment to their land. Since then the cathedral has undergone a number of renovations. Belfries were added {{in the latter half of}} the seventeenth century and in 1868 a sacristy was constructed at the cathedral's east end. Today, it incorporates styles of different periods of Armenian architecture. Diminished during the early Soviet period, Etchmiadzin revived again in the second half of the twentieth century, and under independent Armenia.|$|E
5|$|Entering the 2002 playoffs as {{the eighth}} seed {{for the second}} {{consecutive}} year, the Canucks faced the Presidents' Trophy-winning Detroit Red Wings in the opening round. With 32- and 34-save performances from Cloutier, Vancouver won the first two games of the series. In game three, the Canucks and Red Wings were tied with a minute remaining in the second period when Red Wings defenceman Nicklas Lidström scored on Cloutier with a slapshot from centre ice. The goal was observed by the media as {{a turning point in the}} series for both Cloutier and the Canucks as a team. The Red Wings won game three, as well as the next three contests to eliminate the Canucks in six games; Cloutier was <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game in the first period of the next two contests in favour of backup Peter Skudra.|$|E
5|$|His {{first and}} only major league {{appearance}} came against the Milwaukee Brewers on 17 September 1982. The first two batters he faced were Paul Molitor and Robin Yount, both future Hall of Famers, {{one of only a}} few players in history to do so. Partway through the first inning, he felt a twinge in his shoulder; not wanting to leave his first game early, he pitched through it, and allowed five runs in the first. Partway through the third, after three more runs allowed, Wever was <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game. He pitched for 2⅔ innings and had eight earned runs, two strikeouts, and three wild pitches. Entering the 1983 season, Wever was projected to be the fifth starter in the Yankees' starting rotation. Because of continued pain in his shoulder, he instead spent the season with the AAA Columbus Clippers, where he went 14 with a 9.78 ERA in seven appearances.|$|E

5|$|In the Trojans' {{first home}} {{game of the}} season they faced the Arkansas Razorbacks, led by eighth–year head coach Houston Nutt and quarterback Robert Johnson. Bush opened the scoring for the Trojans with a 76-yard rush. The Razorbacks {{answered}} with a touchdown pass by Johnson, however, Leinart scored three touchdowns, two passing and one rushing, {{before the end of the}} quarter. In the second quarter the Razorbacks were able to kick a field goal before the Trojans scored two more touchdowns on a rush by LenDale White and a third pass by Leinart. Going into the half the Trojans led 42–10. In the third quarter, White rushed for his second touchdown and Leinart threw a fourth before the Trojan starters were <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game. Booty threw his second touchdown of the season in the fourth quarter before backup quarterback Alex Mortensen threw a touchdown for the Razorbacks. Third-string Trojan quarterback Mike McDonald threw a 4-yard touchdown to end the game, giving the Trojans a 70–17 win and a 24-game winning streak.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{population}} of the city was massacred during the sack; Theodosios writes that among the notables alone, over 4,000 were killed. The Arab commander, Abu Ishaq, had the commanding patrikios executed a week later, while the seventy men left with him along with other prisoners were reportedly <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city and beaten to death with stones and clubs. One of the defenders, Niketas of Tarsos, who during the siege had insulted Muhammad daily, was taken apart and tortured to death. Only a few Mardaites from the Peloponnese along with some soldiers of the garrison were able to escape and, reaching Greece, inform admiral Adrianos of the events. The city itself was pillaged and practically destroyed. According to Ibn al-Athir, the Arabs remained there for about two months after the sack, before returning to their base, leaving the city in ruins. Ibn al-Athir also claims that a Byzantine squadron appeared before the city, but that it was driven off after a battle in which the Byzantines lost four ships.|$|E
5|$|Pollet {{started the}} game by {{retiring}} the first three Brooklyn hitters.

After National League MVP Musial struck out, Enos Slaughter singled and Whitey Kurowski walked to load the bases. Joe Garagiola, Sr. brought in a run before being tagged out to end the inning with the score 1–0. In the second inning, Carl Furillo reached base on an error by Pollet. Pee Wee Reese singled, but Furillo was out at second. Another groundout brought the Cardinals back up, and the Dodgers got all three batters quickly out to end the inning. In the top of the third, Howie Schultz hit a home run on the first pitch he saw, tying the score at 1–1. After three more outs, St. Louis came back up to bat. Moore flied out, then Musial walked, and Slaughter singled. Musial scored on Kurowski's hit while Slaughter was called out, and after two more singles, the latter bringing in Kurowski, Branca was <b>taken</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game.|$|E
