5|$|There {{is little}} {{documented}} history of Ashby-de-la-Zouch before the Norman Conquest, although Roman coins {{were found in}} the area, and the town's name has both Saxon and Danish elements.

5|$|But the Parthian Empire, {{weakened}} by internal strife and wars with Rome, {{was soon to}} be followed by the Sassanid Empire. Indeed, shortly afterward, Ardashir I, the local Iranian ruler of Persis (modern Fars Province, Iran) from Estakhr began subjugating the surrounding territories in defiance of Arsacid rule. He confronted Artabanus V at the Battle of Hormozdgān on 28 April 224AD, perhaps at a site near Isfahan, defeating him and establishing the Sassanid Empire. There is evidence, however, <b>that</b> <b>suggests</b> Vologases VI continued to mint coins at Seleucia as late as 228AD.|$|E
5|$|Even though Lanley {{succeeds in}} winning over {{almost the entire}} town, his salesmanship fails to {{convince}} Marge, who is frustrated with the town's purchase because she (correctly) believes the monorail is unsafe and that Lanley is a conman. While watching TV, Homer sees an advertisement <b>that</b> <b>suggests</b> he attend Lanley's institute of monorail conducting, which is a transparent effort to make even more money from the con. Homer immediately decides to enroll. After a three-week course, Lanley selects Homer at random from among his classmates to be the monorail conductor.|$|E

5|$|In Roman Britain Cumbria was the {{territory}} of the Carvetii. As the site of the western part of Hadrian's Wall, it was of strategic importance. The north of the county is rich in archaeological evidence from the period, but nothing is known <b>that</b> <b>suggests</b> any Roman habitation in the Keswick area, other than finds that point to the existence of one or more Roman highways passing the vicinity of the present-day town. Such nearby settlements as can be traced from the era of the Romans and the years after their departure seem to have been predominantly Celtic. Many local place names from the period, including that of the River Derwent, are Celtic, some closely related to Welsh equivalents.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} any {{acknowledgement}} of the mutual existence between the scriptores, only Flavius Vopiscus (ostensibly writing in 305 or 306) refers {{to any of the}} other authors (specifically Trebellius Pollio, Julius Capitolinus and Aelius Lampridius). None of the other five demonstrate any awareness of the existence of any of their 'colleagues'. However, these references cause difficulties when these authors also address Constantine in their dedications, as Vopiscus was also doing. For instance, Capitolinus mostly addresses Diocletian, but in the Albinus, Maximini and Gordiani he addresses Constantine in a fashion <b>that</b> <b>suggests</b> he is writing after 306.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{feminism}} {{challenges the}} essentialist view of gender as biologically intrinsic. For example, Anne Fausto-Sterling's book, Myths of Gender, explores the assumptions embodied in scientific research that support a biologically essentialist view of gender. In Delusions of Gender, Cordelia Fine disputes scientific evidence <b>that</b> <b>suggests</b> {{that there is}} an innate biological difference between men's and women's minds, asserting instead that cultural and societal beliefs are the reason for differences between individuals that are commonly perceived as sex differences.|$|E

The focus of the report is on the latitude at which recent tropical cyclones in the Atlantic are reaching maximum intensity. Their data indicates that during the past thirty years, the peak intensity of these storms has shifted poleward in both hemispheres {{at a rate of}} approximately 60km per decade, amounting to approximately one degree of latitude per decade.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of its development, the Sharingan will grant the user three unique abilities: The first being its famous ability for the user to {{instantly}} memorize and replicate any opponent's movement and attacks with perfect accuracy. The Sharingan's second ability grants the user increased ocular perception, allowing them to read and predict the movements and actions of fast-moving objects. This also allows the user to easily recognize genjutsu and different forms of chakra (i.e.: to visualize chakra in different colors). Its final ability is a brand of scenarios <b>that</b> <b>suggests</b> actions and thoughts to the opponent, acting as {{an effective way to}} produce beyond genjutsu abilities or implant memories in another person.|$|E

The Local Interstellar Cloud is an area of denser cloud in an otherwise sparse region known as the Local Bubble, an hourglass-shaped cavity in the interstellar medium roughly 300 light-years (ly) across. The bubble is suffused with high-temperature plasma, <b>that</b> <b>suggests</b> it is the product of several recent supernovae.|$|E

5|$|The {{content is}} divided into five parts. The first part, Ancient Balances, {{considers}} psychological and historical aspects of debt. Atwood calls debt an imaginative human construct derived {{from a sense of}} need or greed and a sense of fairness in reciprocity and equivalent values. She cites a study by Frans de Waal <b>that</b> <b>suggests</b> a sense of fairness may be a genetic trait shared with other primates, and a study by Robert Axelrod which illustrates, given a level playing field, that the tit-for-tat strategy (or 'Do unto others as they have done onto you' strategy) was the most superior strategy in game theory. Debt and borrowing mechanisms from ancient and biblical societies are compared, including provisions from the Code of Hammurabi, Ancient Egyptians, and the Greco-Roman mythologies.|$|E
5|$|The {{most widely}} {{accepted}} model used to explain the evolution of mimicry in butterflies is the two-step hypothesis. The first step involves mutation in modifier genes that regulate a complex cluster of linked genes that cause large changes in morphology. The second step consists of selections on genes with smaller phenotypic effects, creating an increasingly close resemblance. This model is supported by empirical evidence <b>that</b> <b>suggests</b> that a few single point mutations cause large phenotypic effects, while numerous others produce smaller effects. Some regulatory elements collaborate to form a supergene {{for the development of}} butterfly color patterns. The model is supported by computational simulations of population genetics. The Batesian mimicry in Papilio polytes is controlled by the doublesex gene.|$|E
