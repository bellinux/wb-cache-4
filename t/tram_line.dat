5|$|All {{services}} on the Morialta line {{were replaced by}} buses in 1956. The last <b>tram</b> <b>line</b> built in Adelaide was the Erindale line which opened in early 1944. At maximum extent the lines connected Adelaide with the sea at Henley Beach, Grange and Glenelg, reached {{the base of the}} Adelaide Hills at Morialta and Mitcham and had Northern and Southern limits of Prospect and Colonel Light Gardens.|$|E
5|$|Coatbridge is {{the home}} of 'Scotland's Noisiest Museum', Summerlee Heritage Park, which {{contains}} an insight into the life in industrial Coatbridge. A row of 1900s-1980s cottages, a working <b>tram</b> <b>line</b> and a real coal mine can all be experienced on site. The park is situated on the remains of one of Coatbridge's historic blast furnaces.|$|E
5|$|After the Great Depression, the {{maintenance}} of the tramway system and the purchase of new trams suffered. Competition from private buses, the MTT's own bus fleet and the growth of private car ownership all took patrons from the tram network. By the 1950s, the tram network was losing money and being replaced by an electric and petrol-driven bus fleet. Adelaide's tram history is preserved by the volunteer-run Tramway Museum, St Kilda and the continuing use of 1929 H type trams on the remaining Glenelg <b>tram</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E

5|$|By 1932 the Cronulla tramway had closed. Competing bus {{services}} {{had begun}} to run with unrestricted competition, and the <b>tram</b> <b>line</b> by this time was so full with services that trams often ran late due to holdups at the crossing loops and passengers missed their connections at Sutherland. The line suffered large losses in its later years, {{and the effect of}} the Great Depression at the time forced it to cease its services, the last passenger service operating on 3 August 1931. The goods service continued until 12 January of the next year.|$|E
5|$|DisCo built {{a station}} at Lemington, {{in the western}} {{outskirts}} of the city, to provide electricity for a <b>tram</b> <b>line</b> which ran through their supply area, from the City Centre to Throckley. The station was sited amid the derelict buildings of the Tyne Iron Company's ironworks. They had opened in 1797 and closed in 1886. The works were largely demolished, {{but some of the}} ironworks' buildings and chimneys still stood unused, and the power station was built amongst them. DisCo opened Lemington Power Station in 1903.|$|E
5|$|In the 2008 state budget, the {{government}} {{announced that it would}} extend the <b>tram</b> <b>line</b> further. The first extension, completed in early 2010, was from the existing North Terrace terminus to the Adelaide Entertainment Centre in the inner north-west suburb of Hindmarsh, with a park and ride service set up on Port Road. Following the expected electrification of the Outer Harbour and Grange rail lines, new tram-trains were proposed to run to West Lakes, Port Adelaide and Semaphore by 2018. However, these plans were later scrapped in the 2012 state budget.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the {{division}} of Berlin, <b>tram</b> <b>lines</b> existed throughout the city, but BVG (West) abandoned all the <b>tram</b> <b>lines</b> in its part of the city, replacing them all by buses by 1967. However BVG (Ost) retained its <b>tram</b> <b>lines,</b> and on the reunification of Berlin the BVG inherited a considerable network of routes in {{the eastern half of}} Berlin.|$|R

50|$|In 1968 {{there were}} 83 <b>tram</b> <b>lines</b> in Budapest (10 of which night services) thus {{reaching}} the largest {{extent of the}} network since World War II, decline was imminent. This happened {{partly because of the}} replacement of <b>tram</b> <b>lines</b> with single track and old vehicles with autobuses but also due to the construction of underground lines M2 and M3 which - were then thought to - replace <b>tram</b> <b>lines</b> that used to run above them. In 1972 <b>tram</b> <b>lines</b> on Erzsébet Bridge and Rákóczi út were abolished, then until 1982 <b>tram</b> <b>lines</b> were removed along M3 as well thereby effectively erasing 40 km of rail tracks, around 20% of the Budapest tram network. Along with lines in the city centre, most of the lines in Újpest and some in the southern parts of Pest were demolished.|$|R
5|$|The District of Columbia Department of Transportation is {{building}} the new D.C. Streetcar system to improve transit connectivity within the District. A <b>tram</b> <b>line</b> to connect Bolling Air Force Base to the Anacostia station and was originally expected {{to open in}} 2010. Streetcar routes have been proposed in the Atlas District, Capitol Hill, and the K Street corridor. After seven years of construction, the Atlas District route, known as the H/Benning Street route, opened on February 27, 2016.|$|E
5|$|Following further {{disputes}} and delays, {{it was reported}} in March 2010 that Edinburgh Council was considering cancelling the contract with Bilfinger Berger. By June 2010, the project's cost had risen to £600 million. Council project managers were reported to be in crisis talks, considering options including: borrowing £55 million to fund the increased costs; phasing {{the introduction of the}} <b>tram</b> <b>line,</b> so that trams would initially run between the airport and Haymarket; and terminating the contract with Bilfinger Berger. The council asked TIE to draw up costs for truncating the line at four places: Haymarket station, York Place, the foot of Leith Walk or Ocean Terminal.|$|E
5|$|The Brill Tramway, {{also known}} as the Quainton Tramway, Wotton Tramway, Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad and Metropolitan Railway Brill Branch, was a six-mile (10km) rail line in the Aylesbury Vale, Buckinghamshire, England. It was privately built in 1871 by the 3rd Duke of Buckingham as a horse <b>tram</b> <b>line</b> to {{transport}} goods between his lands around Wotton House and the national railway network. Lobbying from residents of the nearby town of Brill led to the line's extension to Brill and conversion to passenger use in early 1872. Two locomotives were bought for the line, but as it had been designed and built with horses in mind, services were very slow; trains travelled at an average speed of only 4miles per hour (6.4km/h).|$|E
25|$|Tram roundabouts, {{which are}} found in many countries, merge roundabouts for {{individual}} vehicles with <b>tram</b> <b>lines.</b> Large areas are needed for tram roundabouts that include a junction between <b>tram</b> <b>lines.</b> Such systems often contain tram stops.|$|R

Moving west, the street crosses Fountain Street and High Street where the <b>tram</b> <b>lines</b> turn away towards the north.|$|R
5|$|The {{station was}} opened in 1903 {{with a total}} {{generating}} capacity of 970 kilowatts, the electricity generated being used to power a tram system, and provide local households and streets with electric lighting. The station ceased generating electricity in 1919, however the structure was retained {{for use as a}} sub-station until 1946 when the <b>tram</b> <b>line</b> closed. The station was partially demolished in 1949, but has since been made a locally listed building and is now owned by construction company Nortland Construction. In March 2012 Norland applied to Newcastle City Council for permission to demolish the building on the grounds of it being at risk of collapse.|$|E
5|$|The village {{developed}} along Town Street, a school, {{chapel and}} church {{were built in}} the 19th century but after the land was acquired by Leeds Council in 1920 a large council housing estate was built on the flatter land to the south, completely changing the rural nature of the settlement. Early transport was provided by a <b>tram</b> <b>line</b> and the Leeds Ring Road was built to Middleton. After the colliery closed the area began to decline and by 2001, had areas of multiple deprivation and high levels of unemployment and anti-social behaviour. The Middleton Regeneration Board has been established with the remit of addressing these issues.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí {{worked for}} Francisco de Paula del Villar on the apse of the Montserrat monastery, {{designing}} the niche for {{the image of}} the Black Virgin of Montserrat in 1876. He would later substitute Villar in the works of the Sagrada Família. With Leandre Serrallach, he worked on a <b>tram</b> <b>line</b> project to Villa Arcadia in Montjuïc. Eventually, he collaborated with Joan Martorell on the Jesuit church on Carrer Casp and the Salesian convent in Passeig de Sant Joan, as well as the Villaricos church (Almería). He also carried out a project for Martorell for the competition for a new facade for Barcelona cathedral, which was never accepted. His relationship with Martorell, whom he always considered one of his main and most influential masters, brought him unexpected luck; he later recommended Gaudí for the Sagrada Família.|$|E

5|$|The Oslo Tramway had a {{ridership}} of 108 million {{passengers in}} 1948. On 17 January 1949, the Korsvoll Line {{became the first}} <b>tram</b> <b>line</b> to be closed. followed by the Rodeløkka Line on 6 February. The latter reopened following a new route on 2 January 1955. In 1960, with the deregulation of the sale of cars, cheap diesel and the decision to build the metro, the city council decided to close the tram and the trolleybus networks. Tracks would be kept and trams would run until they would be naturally retired. However, no major investments would {{be made in the}} lines or rolling stock. Within a year, the Kampen, Rodeløkka, Vippetangen, Simensbråten and Vestbanen Lines were closed, as were trolleybus lines 18 and 24. The remaining two trolleybus routes were closed in 1968. On 24 June 1968, Vålerenga Line was closed.|$|E
