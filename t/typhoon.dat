30|$|The high {{frequency}} of <b>typhoons</b> in Taiwan leads {{not only to}} increased resistance but also to increased resiliency to <b>typhoons</b> (Chi et al. 2015; Lin et al. 2011). Tall trees are removed by <b>typhoons,</b> leaving stands that are shorter in stature and hence more resistant to <b>typhoons.</b> The large amount of defoliation caused by the high winds from <b>typhoons</b> also generates resistance to breakage and uprooting. Resiliency is achieved through gaps in the canopy formed by wind throw. This creates microhabitats with elevated temperatures and light, which are suitable for regeneration of shade-intolerant species such as taiwania. The rapid recovery of foliage loss after <b>typhoons</b> also aids resilience. The ecosystems in Taiwan are stable due to the resistance and resilience of the forests to <b>typhoons.</b> An increase in the frequency or severity of <b>typhoons</b> could destabilise the ecosystems of Taiwan (Lin et al. 2017).|$|R

5|$|<b>Typhoon</b> Babs was a {{powerful}} <b>typhoon</b> that struck the Philippines (where it was locally known as <b>Typhoon</b> Loleng) just days after <b>Typhoon</b> Zeb hit the same area. The seventh <b>typhoon</b> of the 1998 season, Babs formed on October14 between the Philippines and Guam. The storm moved westward initially, failing to intensify initially due to the outflow from <b>Typhoon</b> Zeb to the northwest. Babs slowed and briefly turned to the south before advancing to the northwest, whereupon it rapidly intensified into a strong <b>typhoon.</b> On October20, the official Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) estimated peak 10‑minute winds of 155km/h (100mph), while the unofficial Joint <b>Typhoon</b> Warning Center (JTWC) estimated peak 1‑minute winds of 250km/h (155mph), making Babs an unofficial super <b>typhoon.</b> The storm struck the Philippine island of Catanduanes at that intensity and weakened slightly before hitting Luzon. Babs turned northward once in the South China Sea, later weakening due to unfavorable conditions and transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on October27 in the Taiwan Strait.|$|E
5|$|<b>Typhoon</b> Betty, {{known in}} the Philippines as <b>Typhoon</b> Herming, was a {{powerful}} and destructive tropical cyclone that struck the Philippines in August1987. The seventh <b>typhoon</b> and second super <b>typhoon</b> of the active <b>typhoon</b> season, it formed from the monsoon trough that spawned a tropical cyclone on August 8 while around positioned well {{to the east of}} the Philippines. It drifted northwestward, becoming a tropical storm on August9 and a <b>typhoon</b> on August10. Betty turned westward, where it rapidly intensified before attaining peak intensity on August11. The next day, <b>Typhoon</b> Betty made landfall in the central Philippines. Betty weakened rapidly over the country, but restrengthened somewhat over the South China Sea. Land interaction weakened Betty slightly before it hit central Vietnam on August16. The next day, Betty dissipated.|$|E
5|$|<b>Typhoon</b> Fengshen was {{the strongest}} storm of the 2002 Pacific <b>typhoon</b> season. It {{developed}} on July13 from the monsoon trough near the Marshall Islands, and quickly intensified due to its small size. By July15, Fengshen attained <b>typhoon</b> status, and after initially moving to the north, it turned toward the northwest. On July18, the <b>typhoon</b> reached its peak intensity of 185km/h (115mph 10‑minute winds), according to the Japan Meteorological Agency. The Joint <b>Typhoon</b> Warning Center estimated peak winds of 270km/h (165mph 1‑minute winds), and the agency estimated that Fengshen was a super <b>typhoon</b> for five days. This broke the record for longest duration at that intensity, previously set by <b>Typhoon</b> Joan in 1997, and which was later tied by <b>Typhoon</b> Ioke in 2006.|$|E
50|$|During {{the years}} 1949-1983, 1268 <b>typhoons</b> were {{observed}} in the Western Pacific. 76 of these had concentric eyewalls. Of all the <b>typhoons</b> that underwent eyewall replacement, around 60% did so only once; 40% {{had more than one}} eyewall replacement cycle, with two of the <b>typhoons</b> each experiencing five eyewall replacements. The number of storms with eyewall replacement cycles was strongly correlated with the strength of the storm. Stronger <b>typhoons</b> {{were much more likely to}} have concentric eyewalls. There were no cases of double eyewalls where the maximum sustained wind was less than 45 m/s or the minimum pressure was higher than 970 hPa. More than three-quarters of the <b>typhoons</b> that had pressures lower than 970 hPa developed the double eyewall feature. The majority of Western and Central Pacific <b>typhoons</b> that experience double eyewalls do so in the vicinity of Guam.|$|R

5|$|<b>Typhoon</b> Francisco, {{known in}} the Philippines as <b>Typhoon</b> Urduja, was a {{powerful}} <b>typhoon</b> that strengthened to {{the equivalent of a}} Category5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale, according to the Joint <b>Typhoon</b> Warning Center. The 25th named storm and the 10th <b>typhoon</b> of the 2013 Pacific <b>typhoon</b> season, Francisco formed on October16 east of Guam from a pre-existing area of convection. With favorable conditions, it quickly intensified into a tropical storm before passing south of Guam. After stalling to the southwest of the island, Francisco turned to the northwest into an environment of warm waters and low wind shear, becoming a <b>typhoon.</b> The JTWC upgraded it to super <b>typhoon</b> status on October18, while the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) estimated peak 10‑minute sustained winds of 195km/h (120mph). Gradual weakening ensued, and after the <b>typhoon</b> turned to the northeast, Francisco deteriorated into a tropical storm on October24. Passing southeast of Okinawa and mainland Japan, the storm accelerated and became extratropical on October26, dissipating later that day.|$|E

5|$|A ridge located {{over the}} central Philippines caused Conson to turn towards the north. Continuing to intensify, the JTWC {{assessed}} the storm {{to have reached}} <b>typhoon</b> status at 1800UTC on June7. The JMA also upgraded the storm to a <b>typhoon</b> about twelve hours later. A 28km (17mi) wide eye developed as the cyclone turned towards the northeast. Originally, forecasts showed the <b>typhoon</b> making landfall in southern Taiwan but the turn towards the northeast spared the island from a direct hit. Shortly after being classified as a <b>typhoon</b> by the JMA, the JTWC upgraded Conson to a Category 2 <b>typhoon</b> on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale with winds of 155km/h (100mph 1-minute winds). The eye later became slightly disorganized and the cloud tops around the center warmed. However, the storm reorganized {{the next day and}} was upgraded to a Category 3 <b>typhoon</b> by the JTWC with winds of 185km/h (115mph 1-minute winds).

5|$|As Kujira {{began to}} track towards Taiwan, the Taiwanese {{government}} issued land- and sea-based warnings {{in advance of}} the storm.

Impacts on the island were expected to be limited to rainfall, though the forecasted precipitation was also expected to lessen ongoing drought conditions. However, mudslides were also a potential impact from the <b>typhoon.</b> The National Fire Administration and Taiwan Power Company developed a contingency plan for the <b>typhoon</b> and had also undertaken other precautionary measures.
