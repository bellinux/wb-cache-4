Natural <b>trees</b> <b>had</b> become the {{preferred}} choice in America when Christmas tree farms began supplying them to large metropolitan areas in the 1920s. Artificial trees of bristles, aluminum trees, and flocked trees became alternatives to real trees during the post-War period.|$|E
5|$|Davis {{started a}} {{pineapple}} plantation on Key Biscayne; six acres (two-and-a-half hectares) {{had been cleared}} and planted in pineapples in 1893–94. Davis also directed his caretaker to plant one-half to one acre (two-tenths to four-tenths of a hectare) of bananas. By 1898, {{a great variety of}} tropical fruit <b>trees</b> <b>had</b> been planted on the island. Davis also had a large dwelling built for his use. It was a two-story cottage with five bedrooms and verandas on three sides, raised ten feet above the ground on pilings to protect against storm surges.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{hardwood}} hammocks in the Everglades {{have been}} harvested for lumber, particularly by shipbuilders seeking West Indian mahogany and black ironwood (Krugiodendron ferreum). The {{largest and most}} mature of these <b>trees</b> <b>had</b> been removed by the late 18th century. Seminoles made their villages in hammocks in the late 19th and early 20th centuries; they lived in groups of chickees numbering half a dozen, with one central chickee for cooking and another for eating. Dugout canoes, cookware, stills, and sewing machines may still be found in remote locations.|$|E
50|$|In {{the year}} 2000, the Japan Women's Club (JWC) donated 400 cherry blossom trees {{to the city}} of Amstelveen. The <b>trees</b> <b>have</b> been planted in the cherry blossom park in the Amsterdamse Bos. A special detail is that every <b>tree</b> <b>has</b> a name — 200 <b>trees</b> <b>have</b> female Japanese names, 200 <b>trees</b> <b>have</b> female Dutch names.|$|R

5|$|Making {{landfall}} {{near the}} border between Mexico and British Honduras, the latter colony's Corozal and Orange Walk districts, containing a population of 15,500at the time, experienced severe devastation from Janet. Strong hurricane winds knocked down and damaged numerous trees across British Honduras, particularly in the Freshwater Creek Forest Preserve. There, an estimated 30%of all <b>trees</b> <b>had</b> been damaged, especially mahogany and sapodilla trees. Hurricane Janet also caused extensive damage to crops, with an estimated $2.631million in damages. Fruit trees, maize, and sugar cane crops suffered the most damage. Sugar cane was {{expected to have a}} 20%decrease in yield due to the damage sustained after the storm. Pineapple crops and livestock experienced less significant losses. To a lesser extent, the hurricane also affected the Belize District and several of British Honduras' offshore cayes. Similar to Corozal and Orange Walk Districts, corn, trees, and coconut experienced the most severe damage of any crop.|$|E
5|$|The plot of Lemon Tree {{was based}} on a real life incident. Israeli Defense Minister Shaul Mofaz moved to the border within Israel and the {{occupied}} territories and security forces began cutting down the Lemon trees beside his house, arguing that it could be used by terrorists as a hiding place. The Palestinian family who owned the trees sued the minister and took the case {{all the way to the}} Israeli Supreme Court. They lost, and their <b>trees</b> <b>had</b> to be cut down. Riklis watched a news blurb about the case online. He then developed the story further in a fictional setting. Riklis explicitly designed the protagonist's part for actress Hiam Abbass.|$|E
5|$|For {{several days}} while {{offshore}} western Madagascar, Haruna dropped greater than normal rainfall. The storm ultimately made landfall about 15hours faster than anticipated. Winds and rainfall from Haruna damaged houses and power systems, and also damaged 265classrooms and 16health facilities. There was also {{damage to the}} rice and maize crops from high winds near the coast, causing food shortages. Rains from the storm caused a dyke along the Fiherenana River to break, which flooded a large region and forced about 6,000people to evacuate their homes. The flooding from the dyke break was worst in Toliara, where most residents lost access to fresh water and power. Flooding in the city caused the temporarily closure of the airport there. The town of Morombe was temporarily isolated after the road was blocked. Power outages affected Morombe, Toliara, Sakaraha, and Betioky Sud. Downed <b>trees</b> <b>had</b> affected roads near Toliara but were quickly removed. About 1,050houses were flooded, another 691 lost their roofs, and 7,402 were destroyed, leaving 13,882people homeless. Overall, Haruna killed 26people and injured another 127.|$|E

5|$|One {{building}} at the Seventh Day Adventist church primary school collapsed while another sustained severe damage. Although damage occurred at Vaitau School, it was utilized as an evacuation shelter. The primary school and college in Araura also suffered damage. The island's electrically run water supply was substantially effected. A total of 568homes lost access to clean water, with many waters tanks damaged or destroyed. Aitutaki's only hospital fared well through the storm, with some roof damage and flooded rooms. Infrastructural losses totaled to NZ$2.3million (US$1.6million), mainly stemming from the power grid. The agricultural sector sustained extensive damage, amounting to US$1.5million, with some crops experiencing a total loss. The severity of damage raised concerns about food security {{in the months after}} the storm. Particularly hard-hit was the mango crop, which was to be harvested two weeks after Pat struck. Approximately 60–75percent of the coconut trees and 75percent of java plum, mango, and kapok trees sustained damage. Most <b>trees</b> <b>had</b> at least one branch torn off and in most cases, multiple branches. Additionally, the blue lorikeet (Vini peruviana), a bird native to French Polynesia and the Cook Islands, population suffered dramatic losses due to the storm, with the population on Aitutaki dropping by more than 50percent.|$|E
5|$|Until the 1980s, {{the most}} {{reproduced}} and publicized of Bauer's works were two paintings depicting the princess and the moose from Sagan om älgtjuren Skutt och lilla prinsessan Tuvstarr (The Tale of the Moose Hop and the Little Princess Cotton Grass), published in 1913. The first picture {{is of the}} princess riding on the moose {{and the second is}} of the moose standing guard over the sleeping princess. They were mainly used as pictures on the wall in nurseries. The same tale also contains the picture of Tuvstarr gazing down into the tarn looking for her lost heart, an allegory of innocence lost. Bauer made several studies of this motif. During the 1980s the painting of Tuvstarr and the tarn was used in advertising for a shampoo. This started a debate in Sweden about how works of art, considered part of the national heritage, should be used. In 1999, the picture again appeared in advertising, this time in a manipulated version in which all the <b>trees</b> <b>had</b> been cut down and Tuvstarr seemed to be lamenting them. The award-winning advertising campaign was made by the Swedish Society for Nature Conservation and helped further the newly awakened environmental movement in Sweden. In his biography on Bauer, Gunnar Lindqvist argues that the picture has become too commercialized.|$|E

25|$|Despite this, the Albert Ground had {{significant}} advantages over Sydney’s existing cricket facilities. It was centrally located and featured good facilities for players and crowd alike. There was a grandstand {{in the north}} west corner and a pavilion ran around three sides of the ground. A row of <b>trees</b> <b>had</b> been planted by the English cricket tourists of 1863-1864 captained by George Parr.|$|E
25|$|Stable isotope {{analysis}} of xylem {{water can be}} used to follow the movement of water from soil into the plants and therefore provide a record of the depth of water acquisition. An advantage to using xylem water is that in theory, the deuterium content should directly reflect the input water without being affected by leaf transpiration. For example, Dawson and Ehleringer used this approach to determine whether trees that grow next to streams are using the surface waters from that stream. Water from the surface would have the same isotopic composition as the stream, while water from farther below in the ground would be from past precipitation inputs. In this case, younger <b>trees</b> <b>had</b> a xylem water isotopic composition very close to the adjacent stream and likely used surface waters to get established. Older <b>trees</b> <b>had</b> depleted xylem water relative to the stream, reflecting that they source their water from deeper underground. Other stable isotope studies have also determined that plants in redwood forests do not just take up water from their roots but acquire a significant proportion of water via stomatal uptake on leaves.|$|E
25|$|Following the French Revolution, two equestrian statues, made in 1745 by Nicolas and Guillaume Coustou, were {{transferred}} from the former royal palace at Marly and placed {{at the beginning of}} the boulevard and park. After the downfall of Napoleon and the restoration of the French monarchy, the <b>trees</b> <b>had</b> to be replanted, because the occupation armies of the Russians, British and Prussians during the Hundred Days had camped in the park and used the trees for firewood.|$|E

50|$|Like other cycads, E. ituriensis is dioecious, {{with both}} male and female <b>trees.</b> Male <b>trees</b> <b>have</b> 1-4 pollen cones, {{narrowly}} ovoid. Female <b>trees</b> <b>have</b> 1 or 2 seed cones, which are ovoid and 18-20 cm long. The seeds have a red sarcotesta.|$|R
50|$|If a dyson <b>tree</b> <b>has</b> {{a flower}} added, dysons with a vastly {{enhanced}} firerate and range are produced.

25|$|Charcoal {{production}} was very labor and land intensive. It was estimated that to fuel a typical sized 100 ton of pig iron per week furnace in 1833 at a sustained yield, timber plantations required 20,000 acres. The <b>trees</b> <b>had</b> to be hauled by oxen {{to where they}} were cut, stacked on end and covered with earth or put in a kiln to be charred for about a week. Anthracite reduced labor cost to $2.50 per ton compared to charcoal at $15.50 per ton.|$|E
25|$|Circa 1870, the inbound 'Clarke Reserve' was {{proposed}} {{as an alternative}} site for the Old Melbourne Cemetery. It was later agreed that an area at Springvale was a better site. The 'Clarke Reserve' was established in 1909 as a State Pine forest called the Frankston Pine Plantation. W.J. Hartland was appointed as Conservator in Charge. Pinus radiata was the most successful of the various species planted. A count taken of numbers revealed that over 1 million <b>trees</b> <b>had</b> been planted.|$|E

25|$|Natives of North America began {{practicing}} farming approximately 4,000 years ago, {{late in the}} Archaic {{period of}} North American cultures. Technology had advanced {{to the point that}} pottery was becoming common and the small-scale felling of <b>trees</b> <b>had</b> become feasible. Concurrently, the Archaic Indians began using fire in a controlled manner. Intentional burning of vegetation was used to mimic the effects of natural fires that tended to clear forest understories. It made travel easier and facilitated the growth of herbs and berry-producing plants, which were important for both food and medicines.|$|E
25|$|The large Harmoni Central Busway (HCB) shelter on Jalan Gadjah Mada, Central Jakarta, {{is built}} over the Ciliwung River. It is a transit point between Corridors 1, 2, 3, 7A, and 8. This 500-person shelter has 14 bus bays. Although many <b>trees</b> <b>had</b> to be sacrificed during the {{construction}} of it, an old banyan tree was not chopped down because it was considered rich in historical value. However, in October 2006 this tree was vandalized by people from the Pemuda Persatuan Islam religious group. Their motive was {{to show that the}} tree does not possess supernatural qualities.|$|E
25|$|A {{few other}} {{developments}} {{around that time}} hampered the illegal logging. Shortly before the increased enforcement began in April, about 500 workers gathered in Antalaha, threatening to burn {{the homes of the}} rosewood collectors due to continued withholding of their salary. By June, thousands of logs from approximately 20,000 <b>trees</b> <b>had</b> been confiscated in the north-eastern ports of Vohémar and Antalaha. However, the economic and political circumstances that were fueling the looting had not changed, allowing illegal logging to continue and driving even the impoverished gangs of Malagasy loggers to accept partial payments for their labor.|$|E
