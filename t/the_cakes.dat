5|$|Sexuality {{played an}} {{important}} role in Crowley's ideas about magick and his practice of it, and has been described as being central to Thelema. He outlined three forms of sex magick—the autoerotic, homosexual, and heterosexual—and argued that such acts could be used to focus the magician's will onto a specific goal such as financial gain or personal creative success. For Crowley, sex was treated as a sacrament, with the consumption of sexual fluids interpreted as a Eucharist. This was often manifested as <b>the</b> <b>Cakes</b> of Light, a biscuit containing either menstrual blood or a mixture of semen and vaginal fluids. The Gnostic Mass is the central religious ceremony within Thelema.|$|E
5|$|The {{tradition}} of the dole continues to the present, and every Easter Monday tea, cheese and bread are given to local widows and pensioners {{through the windows of}} Biddenden's former workhouse. All those eligible for the annual dole are given a Biddenden cake, and they are sold as souvenirs to visitors. <b>The</b> <b>cakes</b> are baked so hard as to be inedible, to allow better preservation as souvenirs; they are baked in large batches every few years and kept until the stock runs out. Historically, the loaves used were of the archaic quartern loaf size, but this particular part of the tradition ended when Biddenden's last bakery closed in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, TGS star Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski) {{receives}} a card from Carvel that entitles her to free ice cream cakes for life. She gets a free cake with the card {{but it has}} a mistake in the decoration so NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) returns it to the restaurant. When he gets a refund for the free cake, Jenna decides to scam the restaurant. With Kenneth's help, she orders several more cakes and gets refunds for them. Eventually Jenna is banned from Carvel. The two then enlist actor Kelsey Grammer to assist them in a bigger scam. Jenna and Kenneth submit a sketch to TGS producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) in Liz's name that requires dozens of cakes. Grammer orders <b>the</b> <b>cakes</b> and later gets refunds for all of them. The gang has now collected money from both TGS and Carvel for 21 free cakes, a windfall of nearly 800 dollars. Kenneth runs into one of the Carvel employees (Jen Ponton) and learns that she was fired because of the scam. Realizing the negative effect of their actions, Kenneth decides not {{to take part in the}} scams anymore.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>cakes</b> {{were to be}} left on {{the table}} for a week, and then be {{replaced}} with new ones on the Sabbath, so that there were always fresh loaves on the table, and those that had started going stale were removed; the Biblical text states that the Jewish priests were entitled to eat <b>the</b> <b>cakes</b> that had been removed, as long as they did so in a holy place, as it considered the bread to be holy. The narrative of David's sojourn at Nob mentions that Ahimelek (the priest) gave David the holy bread, at his request.|$|E

50|$|The {{exterior}} {{bowl and}} the scroll conveyor rotate at different high speeds. This differential speed {{between the two}} is accountable for the sedimentation throughout the decanter centrifuge cylinder. A high differential speed results in a smaller residence time of <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> settlement, so it is necessary to keep <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> thickness to a minimum to avoid impairing the discharge quality. Keeping <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> thickness to a minimum also aids in the improvement of <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> dewatering process. For this reason it is necessary to obtain an optimal differential speed to balance <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> thickness and quality.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> [...] <b>cake</b> {{became a}} popular {{confection}} when {{the island was}} an important sugar producer, since <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> itself is traditionally made with molasses instead of the now-popular honey, which meant it could be stored for up to 5 years. When made with molasses, <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> is very dark in color and has a spongy sticky texture resembling a soft cookie. <b>The</b> <b>cake</b> often has walnuts and almonds mixed within it. When it is served in Madeira, it is customary not to cut <b>the</b> <b>cake,</b> but rather to tear pieces off using the hands.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>cake's</b> moist {{center is}} {{typically}} created by inserting a fork into <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> {{several times and}} filling the holes with a mixture containing sugar and a flavoring or fruit such as pineapple. It is traditionally baked using a 13 by 9 by 2-inch pan and then refrigerated and eaten cold.

50|$|Angel food cake {{is usually}} baked in a tube pan, a tall, round {{pan with a}} tube up the center that leaves {{a hole in the}} middle of <b>the</b> <b>cake.</b> A bundt pan may also be used, but the fluted sides can make {{releasing}} <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> more difficult. <b>The</b> center tube allows <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> batter to rise higher by 'clinging' to all sides of the pan. <b>The</b> angel food <b>cake</b> pan should not be greased, unlike pans used to prepare other <b>cakes,</b> this allows <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> to have a surface upon which to crawl up helping it to rise. After baking, <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> pan is inverted while cooling to prevent <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> from falling in on itself. Angel food cake is sometimes frosted but more often has some sort of sauce, such as a sweet fruit sauce, drizzled over it. A simple glaze is also popular. Recently, many chefs (Alton Brown in particular) have popularized the idea of adding aromatic spices such as mace and cloves to <b>the</b> <b>cake.</b>|$|R
25|$|The Mishnah {{argues that}} after being removed, the old bread {{was placed on}} a golden table in the Temple's hall, and then the old incense would be burnt; once this was done, <b>the</b> <b>cakes</b> would be divided, with the Jewish High Priest getting five of the twelve loaves, and the {{remainder}} being divided among the other priests on duty during the previous week. On the occasion of certain Jewish Holidays occurring during the Sabbath, there were adjustments made, for example, if Yom Kippur occurred on the Sabbath, the old bread wouldn't be divided between the priests until the evening.|$|E

Although the team had difficulty selling the dresses to begin with, customers eventually returned to make purchases {{near the end of}} the day, with three dresses and a good amount of lingerie sold as a direct result. Meanwhile, Renaissance went with mid-range supplier for the dresses at Helene's insistence, and chose to sell wedding cakes after losing out the lingerie to Alpha. While Alex single-handedly sold five of their dresses, none of <b>the</b> <b>cakes</b> were taken, mainly due to Michael and Sara using highly aggressive sales techniques, ultimately costing them victory.|$|E
25|$|Josephus {{states that}} <b>the</b> <b>cakes</b> {{were placed in}} two equal piles (rather than rows), as does the Mishnah, which {{describes}} the existence of hollow golden tubes to carry air between the bread, and two golden fork-shaped supports attached to the table, each one to hold up a pile Josephus also states that the frankincense was placed in two golden cups - {{one on top of}} each pile; the Mishnah states that a handful of incense was placed in each cup, and the Tosefta states that the cups, called bezikin, had flat bottoms/rims, so that they could also be placed on the table. According to the Mishnah, while the new bread was being carried in by the four priests, two other priests would carry in replacement cups of incense, and two further priests would go ahead of them to remove the old cups of incense.|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} fluid flow in a {{two-dimensional}} pleated filter is considered.

The flow is considered in various geometries, particularly long thin filters and corners. The main parameter in the problem is the ratio of the filter-material resistance to <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> resistance, and limiting cases are considered. Travelling waves of cake build-up are found for arbitrary time-dependent variations in the inflow conditions. The time taken for the filter to become clogged by <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> is also considered...|$|R

25|$|The {{somewhat}} scanty biblical details {{concerning the}} shewbread are complemented by further information given by Josephus (a contemporary of Herod's temple), and, over the several centuries after the Temple's destruction, by classical rabbinical literature. According to Josephus, <b>the</b> <b>cakes</b> were unleavened and were baked on the Friday before the Sabbath, since the biblical regulations forbade work {{of any kind}} during the Sabbath. The Mishnah argues that the loaves were kneaded separately, but baked in pairs; the Mishnah also states that the loaves were moulded into shape by three different moulds (made from gold, according to Maimonides, who lived {{more than a thousand}} years after the burning of Jerusalem), with one being used while the loaves were just dough, another while the bread was being baked in the oven, and a third after baking, to protect the shape. The Mishnah describes the loaves as being 10 Etzba long, and 5 Etzba wide, with rims/horns that were 7 Etzba long; Maimonides gives the same figures but with Tefah as the unit rather than Etzba.|$|E
25|$|Her cult {{included}} the annual feeding of a sacred snake with barley cakes by virgin maidens. The snake dwelt {{in a deep}} cave within the precinct of the temple, on the arx of the city: the maidens approached the lair blindfolded. The snake was supposed to feed only on <b>the</b> <b>cakes</b> offered by chaste girls. The rite was aimed at ensuring agricultural fertility. The site of the temple {{as well as the}} presence of the snake show she was the tutelary goddess of the city, as Athena at Athens and Hera at Argos. The motive of the snake of the palace goddess guardian of the city is shared by Iuno Seispes with Athena, as well as its periodic feeding. This religious pattern moreover includes armour, goatskin dress, sacred birds and a concern with virginity in cult. Virginity is connected to regality: the existence and welfare of the community was protected by virgin goddesses or the virgin attendants of a goddess. This theme shows a connexion with the fundamental theological character of Iuno, that of incarnating vital force: virginity is the condition of unspoilt, unspent vital energy that can ensure communion with nature and its rhythm, symbolised in the fire of Vesta. It is a decisive factor in ensuring the safety of the community and the growth of crops. The role of Iuno is at the crossing point of civil and natural life, expressing their interdependence.|$|E

500|$|After {{learning}} Jenna's {{scheme to}} con Carvel, Kenneth {{says that it}} is wrong and illegal, and says that if Cookie Puss knew about this [...] "he'd tear us apart with his fangs." [...] This is a reference to Cookie Puss, an ice cream cake character created by Carvel in the 1970s.

Although <b>the</b> <b>cake</b> is generally served with a plain frosting, Pillsbury also offers [...] "funfetti" [...] frosting, with rainbow sprinkles added.
