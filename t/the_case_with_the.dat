40|$|Clinlcal significances of the anti-lung {{antibody}} {{were studied}} {{on the course}} of <b>the</b> 287 <b>cases</b> of lung tuberuculosis patients. The results summarized as follows; 1. The sera of <b>the</b> patients <b>with</b> various kind of lung diseases were tested for anti-lung-antibody activity against human lung antigen, using the complement fixation reaction. <b>The</b> <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> positive anti-lung-antibody were in 2 cases out of 4 cases of bronchoectasis, in 2 cases of 4 cases of lung abscess, in 9 cases of thoracic empyema, in 126 cases of 287 cases of lungc tuberuclosis. From the correlation between clinical types (Gakuken's classification in Japan) and antilung antibody the incidence of the positive anti-lung-antibody was as the flloowing ordet. A>B>F>C>D A: Exsudative Form B: Infiltrating-caseous Form C: Fibrose-caseous Form D: Fibrose Form E: Disseminated For F: Serious Mixed Form 2. In <b>the</b> positive anti-lung-antibody <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> lung tuberuculosis <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> positive anti-luny-antibody increased in titer gradually and <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> continuous or occassional positive anti-lung-antibody {{for a long period}} became week and the clinical signs worsened.

On the course of the lung tuberuculosis circulating antilung-antibody increased in titer in parallel <b>with</b> <b>the</b> increased titer of complete tuberuculin antibody in peripheral blood. 4. After administration of anti-tuberculosis drugs and/or after surgical treatments in <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> tuberuculosis of <b>the</b> lung the circulating anti-lung-antibody decreased in titer and was not detected in peripheral blood. 5.

The general impression is that the English cathedral sprawls across its site with many projecting limbs. These horizontal projections are visibly balanced by the strong verticals of the massive towers, which may be one, two or three in number. Many of the cathedrals, particularly those like Winchester, St. Albans and Peterborough where the towers are not particularly high, give an impression of tremendous length and {{have been described as}} resembling “aircraft carriers”.|$|E
5|$|As is <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> major {{categories}} of metals, metalloids and nonmetals, {{there is some}} variation and overlapping of properties within and across each category of nonmetal. Among the polyatomic nonmetals, carbon, phosphorus and selenium—which border the metalloids—begin to show some metallic character. Sulfur (which borders the diatomic nonmetals), is the least metallic of the polyatomic nonmetals but even here shows some discernible metal-like character (discussed below). Of the diatomic nonmetals, iodine is the most metallic. Its number of nearest neighbours is sometimes described as 1+2 hence it is almost a polyatomic nonmetal. Within the iodine molecule, significant electronic interactions occur with the two next nearest neighbours of each atom, and these interactions give rise, in bulk iodine, to a shiny appearance and semiconducting properties. Of the monatomic nonmetals, radon is the most metallic and begins to show some cationic behaviour, which is unusual for a nonmetal.|$|E

5|$|Kurosawa's next project, Throne of Blood, an {{adaptation}} of William Shakespeare's Macbeth—set, like Seven Samurai, in the Sengoku Era—represented an ambitious transposition of the English work into a Japanese context. Kurosawa instructed his leading actress, Isuzu Yamada, to regard the work {{as if it were}} a cinematic version of a Japanese rather than a European literary classic. Given Kurosawa's appreciation of traditional Japanese stage acting, the acting of the players, particularly Yamada, draws heavily on the stylized techniques of the Noh theater. It was filmed in 1956 and released in January 1957 to a slightly less negative domestic response than had been <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> director's previous film. Abroad, Throne of Blood, regardless of the liberties it takes with its source material, quickly earned a place among the most celebrated Shakespeare adaptations.|$|E
5|$|Many {{crocodilians}} are {{hunted for}} their skins, {{but this is}} not <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Cuvier's dwarf caiman. This may be because the ventral skin in this species is too heavily armoured to make it easy to tan. Some individuals are killed by indigenous peoples for food and others, particularly in Guyana, are collected for the pet trade; but {{there is no evidence that}} populations are dwindling as a result. There are some threats to this species from habitat destruction, including the mining of gold, but these are not thought to be of great significance.

5|$|Other threats include illegal {{collection}} for pet trade, which concerns mainly the southern crested newt, {{and the northern}} crested newt in its eastern range.

Warmer and wetter winters due to global warming may increase newt mortality by disturbing their hibernation and forcing them to expend more energy.

5|$|Several tombs of antipopes were desecrated and destroyed, {{often by}} their rival claimants, shortly after their creation.

5|$|The {{basic unit}} of {{measurement}} used during construction was the tala, defined as {{the length of a}} human face from the forehead's hairline to the tip of the chin or the distance from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the middle finger when both fingers are stretched at their maximum distance. The unit is thus relative from one individual to the next, but the monument has exact measurements. A survey conducted in 1977 revealed frequent findings of a ratio of 4:6:9 around the monument. The architect had used the formula to lay out the precise dimensions of the fractal and self-similar geometry in Borobudur's design. This ratio is also found in the designs of Pawon and Mendut, nearby Buddhist temples.

30|$|In fact, the {{longitudinal}} orbital torque Fθ d/ 2 will drive these NPs to rotate in orbits with diameters of d 1 and d 2. For <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Gaussian beam, orbits will be centered at the beam axis. The {{sign of the}} azimuthal optical force (Fθ) indicates that {{the longitudinal}} orbital rotation (revolution) at the first stable-equilibrium orbit induced by the Gaussian beam is opposite to that by a plane wave. This shows that the negative Fθ of CP Gaussian beam generates a negative orbital torque Fθ d 1 / 2 at the first stable-equilibrium orbit; more importantly, the helicity of the orbital rotation of Au dimer is opposite to the handedness of the incident CP light [12]. It is also of interest to note that Fθ is always negative as d[*]>[*] 300  nm for <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Gaussian beam; the phenomenon of reverse rotation (revolution) of the optically bound NPs, due to negative orbital torque, is easily observed in optical tweezers systems.

5|$|This pyramid was {{the last}} pyramid ever built {{as part of a}} {{mortuary}} complex in Egypt.

The pyramid form was associated with the sun god Re, who had been overshadowed by Amun in importance. One of the meanings of Amun's name was the hidden one, which meant that it was now theologically permissible to hide the Pharaoh's tomb by fully separating the mortuary template from the actual burial place. This provided the added advantage that the resting place of the pharaoh could be kept hidden from necropolis robbers. All subsequent pharaohs of the New Kingdom would be buried in rock-cut shaft tombs in the Valley of the Kings.|$|E
