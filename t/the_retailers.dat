40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{determine}} <b>the</b> optimal <b>retailer’s</b> replenishment policies considering the customers’ bad debt and delayed payment in the three-stage supply chain with <b>the</b> dominant <b>retailer.</b> <b>The</b> effect of bad debt is analyzed on the interest earned and interest charged to build the models of <b>the</b> <b>retailer’s</b> decision in two cases.

25|$|The {{development}} of fast fashion trend {{also contributes to}} the arisen of sweatshops. Fast fashion trend refers to “rapid reorders and new orders that retailers now exert as they discern sales trends in real time” (Ross, 2015) To {{catch up with the}} fast-changing fashion trends to satisfy increasing customers’ demand, these fast-fashion brands have to react and arrange production accordingly. To lower production and the storage cost, they are always searching for cheaper labour which can produce orders {{in a short period of}} time. This results in workers suffering from unreasonably long working hours without reasonable payment. A documentary, “The True Cost” (2015), points out that sweatshop is a story of passing pressure from <b>the</b> <b>retailers</b> to factory owners and ends on the workers (including sew-machine operators, cutters and pressers).

We find that the outsourcing market encourages <b>the</b> <b>retailer</b> to make {{a higher level of}} service commitment, while prompting the manufacturer to reduce the wholesale price, resulting in more demand realization. We analyze how the expected cost of the service in the outsourcing market and <b>the</b> <b>retailer's</b> risk attitude affect the decisions of both parties.

25|$|Result: Maria {{suggested}} that Odyssey create a cookbook aimed at professional women; whilst David and Andrew disagreed, everybody else did {{and despite the}} idea being badly received by the focus group, Maria persuaded Sean {{to go with it}} anyway, as she thought that it was better to have a target market. The resulting book, while produced fairly professionally, was strongly criticised due to the cover not even making clear that it was a cookbook. On Platinum, the team came up with a book called #Where'sMummy?, which was aimed at people leaving home for the first time, and was designed to tie in with Twitter and other forms of social media. Lucy did not get on with the sub-team of Amy, Alice and Ashleigh and frequently argued with them, and when the book was produced, it contained many spelling errors that the clients were not impressed by (though they did acknowledge the time constraints the group were under). However, Navdeep delivered strong pitches for the cookbook, and Platinum secured orders from all three retailers, with a final total of 7,500 orders. On Odyssey, Maria and Andrew fronted the first two pitches, which seemingly went down well with the clients and {{with the rest of the}} team. However, Sean made the unusual decision to change the pitchers to Patrick and David for the third pitch, which did not go so well. Odyssey ultimately only got 800 orders, from just one of <b>the</b> <b>retailers.</b>|$|E

500|$|The 40-page {{first issue}} was {{released}} in print and digitally on August 20, 2014. Jamie McKelvie and Chip Zdarsky provided art for two retailer-exclusive variant covers. These variants were commissioned directly by <b>the</b> <b>retailers.</b> Unlike most comics sold in the direct market, unsold copies of this issue could {{be returned to the}} publisher. This tactic allowed retailers to place higher orders without taking a financial risk. Estimated sales were just under 35,000 copies, making it the 61st best-selling comic book for the month. Due to re-orders, the issue sold out at the distributor level on the day of release. A second printing was announced the next day and was released on September 24, 2014, the same day as issue two. Including sales for the second printing, the first issue sold approximately 41,000 copies. In addition to the standard print version, a larger [...] "magazine" [...] version with eight additional pages of art was available for an extra cost. This version, which was not returnable, was estimated to have sold an additional 8300 copies.
