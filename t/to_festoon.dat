Phoebe saw, however, that their growth must have been checked by a degree of careful labor, bestowed daily and systematically on the garden. The white double rosebush had evidently been propped up anew against the house since the commencement of the season; and a pear-tree and three damson-trees, which, except a row of currant-bushes, constituted the only varieties of fruit, bore marks of the recent amputation of several superfluous or defective limbs. There were also a few species of antique and hereditary flowers, in no very flourishing condition, but scrupulously weeded; as if some person, either out of love or curiosity, had been anxious to bring them to such perfection as they were capable of attaining. The remainder of the garden presented a well-selected assortment of esculent vegetables, in a praiseworthy state of advancement.

His favorites are a gaggle of mermaids (all brunettes with the exception of a single strawberry-blonde) who appear hand-sized next to the larger-than-life king. Once dismissed from the king's presence, the mermaids surface to lounge on a rock and relax. They are spotted by a band of lecherous pirates who attempt to capture them using a lasso. The mermaids all escape apart from the strawberry blonde who is lassoed and pulled onto the ship of jeering pirates. The frightened young mermaid is then attacked by the cruel pirates, jumping on her and pulling her hair, though she does a good job of fending them off. Enraged that one of his most beloved subjects has been taken hostage and suffering, King Neptune launches an assault on the pirates and a fantastic naval battle ensues. The sea creatures work together to mimic such war machines as airplanes and bombs, submarine torpedoes, and other such modern equipment. During the attack one pirate drags the mermaid and puts her into a treasure chest to keep as a valuable. The pirates do a fair job of fending off their attackers, so Neptune rises to the surface and summons a storm while stirring up huge whirlpools with his trident. In the end, he jumps on top of the pirate ship, plunging it straight to the bottom of the ocean.There is no trace of the pirates except a single chest that begins to jump around on its own.

The Amasis Painter borrows scenes from the Heidelberg Painter, such as a warrior dressing himself in greaves with multiple bystanders; however, the Amasis Painter adds his own touch in the treatment of his figures, imparting a greater sense of detail, and often adding a signature double-band border and palmette-lotus <b>festoon</b> <b>to</b> the ornamental decoration.

40|$|Background Malar mounds may be accentuated by chronic lid edema, {{with the}} {{development}} from malar edema to malar mounds and finally <b>to</b> malar <b>festoons.</b> Because standard techniques do not seem effective and not specifically proposed {{for the treatment of}} malar festoons, subperiosteal vertical upper-midface lift associated with lower blepharoplasty overcomes these shortcomings. Methods Twelve patients (3 males and 9 females, age = 47 ± 6 years) underwent video-assisted endoscopic subperiosteal vertical upper-midface lift (SUM-lift) in conjunction with a lower blepharoplasty between 2006 and 2007 for treatment of malar festoons. This includes simultaneous lower blepharoplasties and video-assisted transtemporal subperiosteal and sub-SMAS tissue release. Results All patients healed uneventfully without any major postoperative problems. The surgical outcome was evaluated according to the analysis of photographs obtained before and after surgery and the analysis of preand postoperative measurements. The technique we used (SUM-lift) achieved a significant rejuvenation of the midface and the malar festoons. Conclusion Subperiosteal vertical midface lift resuspends and redrapes the facial network that originates {{at the level of the}} orbital rim.

6000|$|XIII. Now I do {{not mean}} to say that Nature never uses festoons: she loves them, and uses them lavishly; and though she does so only in those places of {{excessive}} luxuriance wherein {{it seems to me that}} architectural types should seldom be sought, yet a falling tendril or pendent bough might, if managed with freedom and grace, be well introduced into luxuriant decoration (or if not, it is not their want of beauty, but of architectural fitness, which incapacitates them for such uses). But what resemblance to such example can we trace in a mass of all manner of fruit and flowers, tied heavily into a long bunch, thickest in the middle, and pinned up by both ends against a dead wall? For it is strange that the wildest and most fanciful of the builders of truly luxuriant architecture never ventured, so far as I know, even a pendent tendril; while the severest masters of the revived Greek permitted this extraordinary piece of luscious ugliness to be fastened in the middle of their blank surfaces. So surely as this arrangement is adopted, the whole value of the flower work is lost. Who among the crowds that gaze upon the building ever pause to admire the flower work of St. Paul's? It is as careful and as rich as it can be, yet it adds no delightfulness to the edifice. It is no part of it. It is an ugly excrescence. We always conceive the building without it, and should be happier if our conception were not disturbed by its presence. It makes the rest of the architecture look poverty-stricken, instead of sublime; and yet it is never enjoyed itself. Had it been put, where it ought, into the capitals, it would have been beheld with never-ceasing delight. I {{do not mean}} that it could have been so in the present building, for such kind of architecture has no business with rich ornament in any place; but that if those groups of flowers had been put into natural places in an edifice of another style, their value would have been felt as vividly as now their uselessness. What applies <b>to</b> <b>festoons</b> is still more sternly true of garlands. A garland is meant to be seen upon a head. There it is beautiful, because we suppose it newly gathered and joyfully worn. But it is not meant to be hung upon a wall. If you want a circular ornament, put a flat circle of colored marble, as in the Casa Doria and other such palaces at Venice; or put a star, or a medallion, or if you want a ring, put a solid one, but do not carve the images of garlands, looking as if they had been used in the last procession, and been hung up to dry, and serve next time withered. Why not also carve pegs, and hats upon them? ...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Ticks {{belonging}} to the Rhipicephalus sanguineus group are amongst the most important vectors of pathogenic microorganisms to dogs and humans. However, the taxonomy of this species group is still the subject of debate, especially {{because there is no}} type specimen or reliable morphological description for Rhipicephalus sanguineus sensu stricto. Recently, a comprehensive morphological and genetic study on representative tick specimens from Europe, Africa, Americas, and Oceania, revealed the existence of at least four morphologically and genetically distinct species under the name 'R. sanguineus' infesting dogs from different countries. METHODS: Herein, we examined morphologically tick specimens retrieved on a dog mummy from Ancient Egypt (ca. 1 st century - 4 th century A. D.). The dog mummy and associated ticks were found during an archaeological expedition conducted in El Deir. RESULTS: Scanning electron micrographs allowed us to assess their identity as {{belonging to}} the R. sanguineus group. In addition {{on the basis of the}} scutal punctation pattern, spiracular plates, width of dorsal tail of spiracular plates relative <b>to</b> the adjacent <b>festoon,</b> female genital aperture, male adanal plates and accessory shields, these ticks were tentatively identified as Rhipicephalus sp. II (=temperate species). CONCLUSIONS: It can be concluded that R. sanguineus group ticks have infested dogs living in the Mediterranean region since ancient times. This finding represents the oldest record of ticks on any animal species and adds a new piece in the complex puzzle regarding tick parasitism on dogs and humans and their role as vectors of pathogens...|$|R
60|$|As I write, the Spring {{is coming}} in Cambridge, and I cannot help thinking, with a little heartache, of how the Spring came to meet us once as we rode southward from Venice toward Florence on that road from Padua to Ferrara. It had been May for some time in Tuscany, and all through the wide plains of Venetia this was the {{railroad}} landscape: fields tilled and tended as jealously as gardens, and waving in wheat, oats, and grass, with here and there the hay cut already, and here and there acres of Indian corn. The green of the fields was all dashed with the bloody red of poppies; the fig-trees hung full of half-grown fruit; the orchards were garlanded with vines, which they do not bind to stakes in Italy, but train from tree to tree, leaving them <b>to</b> droop in <b>festoons</b> and sway in the wind, with the slender native grace of vines. Huge stone farm-houses shelter {{under the same roof}} the family and all the live stock of the farm; thatched cottages thickly dotting the fields, send forth to their cultivation the most picturesque peasants,--men and women, pretty young girls in broad hats, and wonderful old brown and crooked crones, who seem never to have been younger nor fairer. Country roads, level, straight, and white, stretch away on either hand, and the constant files of poplars escort them wherever they go. All about, the birds sing, and the butterflies dance. The milk-white oxen dragging the heavy carts turn up their patient heads, with wide-spreading horns and mellow eyes, at the passing train; the sunburnt lout behind them suspends the application of the goad; unwonted acquiescence stirs in the bosom of the firm-minded donkey, and even the matter-of-fact locomotive seems to linger as lovingly as a locomotive may along these plains of Spring.|$|R
6000|$|The {{vessel that}} occasioned these {{cautious}} movements was a gallant ship, whose huge hull, lofty masts, and square yards loomed in the evening's haze, above the sea, like a distant mountain {{rising from the}} deep. She carried but little sail, and though she warily avoided the near approach to the land that the schooner had attempted, the similarity of their movements was sufficiently apparent to warrant the conjecture that they were employed on the same duty. The frigate, for the ship belonged to this class of vessels, floated across {{the entrance of the}} little bay, majestically in the tide, with barely enough motion through the water to govern her movements, until she arrived opposite to the place where her consort lay, when she hove up heavily into the wind, squared the enormous yards on her mainmast, and attempted, in counteracting the power of her sails by each other, to remain stationary; but the light air that had at no time swelled her heavy canvas to the utmost began to fail, and the long waves that rolled in from the ocean ceased to be ruffled with the breeze from the land. The currents and the billows were fast sweeping the frigate towards one of the points of the estuary, where the black heads of the rocks could be seen running far into the sea, and in their turn the mariners of the ship dropped an anchor to the bottom, and drew her sails in <b>festoons</b> <b>to</b> the yards. As the vessel swung round to the tide, a heavy ensign was raised to her peak, and a current of air opening for a moment its folds, the white field and red cross, that distinguish the flag of England, were displayed to view.

40|$|Incubation of {{guinea pig}} {{pancreatic}} lobules in Ca++-free Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution (KRB) containing 0. 5 mM ethylene glycol-bis(beta- aminoethyl ether) N,N,N',N'-tetraacetate (EGTA) {{results in the}} progressive fragmentation of the occluding zonulae (ZO) with formation of multiple discrete junctions (fasciae occludentes) localized in the lateral and lumenal plasmalemma. After 1 [...] 2 h of such incubation, most ZO appear completely disassembled. This results in {{the disappearance of the}} heterogeneity in density of intramembrane particles on the P- fracture faces of the basolateral and lumenal plasmalemma. If Ca++ ions are reintroduced into the incubation fluid at this point, continous zonulae reform around the apices of the cells; in contrast, the density of intramembrane particles (imp) at the lumenal plasmalemma remains the same as in the basolateral region, at least for 3 h after Ca++ reintroduction. When added to the incubation fluid, cycloheximide (at a dose known to inhibit protein synthesis greater than 95 %) and cytochalasin B (at doses which disrupt microfilaments and modify the cell shape) had no effect on the organization of ZO, on their disassembly in Ca++-free, EGTA medium, or on their Ca++-dependent reformation. Likewise, the organization and disassembly of ZO were unaffected by colchicine; however, after treatment with the latter drug the reassembly was defective, with formation of strand networks on the lateral surface and incomplete segregation of the lumenal region. Antimycin A, on the other hand, when added to the Ca++-EGTA medium, induced a large proliferation of long, infrequently anastomosed junctional strands, usually arranged <b>to</b> form ribbons, <b>festoons,</b> and other bizarre arrays. The possible relationship of these in vitro findings to the in vivo biogenesis and turnover of occluding junctions is discussed. It is suggested that the impairment of reassembly of zonulae by colchicine might be correlated with the disorder induced by the drug on the general organization of pancreatic exocrine cells. Moreover, antimycin A could act by promoting the aggregation of a pool of free junctional strand components (or precursors) that might exist normally in pancreatic exocrine cells...|$|R

Since Keshav's other business ventures are unsuccessful, the family remains entirely dependent on Usha's earnings - a fact that Keshav clearly resents.

Our sitting-room was green and had framed and glazed upon the walls numbers of surprising and surprised birds, staring out of pictures at a real trout in a case, as brown and shining as if it had been served with gravy; at the death of Captain Cook; and at the whole process of preparing tea in China, as depicted by Chinese artists. In my room there were oval engravings of the months--ladies haymaking in short waists and large hats tied under the chin, for June; smooth-legged noblemen pointing with cocked-hats to village steeples, for October. Half-length portraits in crayons abounded all through the house, but were so dispersed that I found the brother of a youthful officer of mine in the china-closet and the grey old age of my pretty young bride, with a flower in her bodice, in the breakfast-room.
