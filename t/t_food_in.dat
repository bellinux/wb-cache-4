Commonly, this fungus can be isolated from the tree leaf litter of various trees including birch, pine, fir, cotton, and palm. It has also been isolated from several food sources such as barley, wheat, oats, maize, apples, grapes, meat products, cheese, beans, hazelnuts, pecans, pistachios, peanuts, and coffee.

40|$|The {{composition}} and antimicrobial {{activity of the}} essential oil of Thymus daenensis Wild, an endemic species from Iran, was studied. The volatile oil obtained by hydrodistillation was characterized by the physico-chemical properties, gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) techniques. Thirty compounds, accounting for 97. 5 % of the total oil, were identified. The main constituents were thymol (29. 8 %) and carvacrol (13. 6 %), p-cymene (11. 3), borneol (6. 8 %) and 1, 8 -cineole (5. 89 %). The antimicrobial activity of essential oil of T. daenensis was tested against two Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria and three fungi by disc diffusion method. The results of the bioassays showed the interesting antimicrobial activity, in which the Gram-positive bacteria, Staphylococcus aureus, was the most sensitive to the oil, as well the oil exhibited a remarkable antifungal activity against all the tested fungi. These results confirm {{the possibility of using}} <b>T.</b> daenensis <b>in</b> <b>food</b> system, medicine and pharmacy...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. <b>Food</b> {{retailers}} <b>in</b> the Northwest Territories face {{dramatically different}} conditions {{from those of}} southern food retailers. There are three main differences: (1) small market size, (2) limited geographical access to suppliers and (3) different types of competitors. These differences have resulted <b>in</b> higher <b>food</b> prices and smaller, more general, stores with {{a wider variety of}} m rchandise than southern supermarkets. Resupply is much less frequent than in southern supermarkets because resupply must be made via either air or barge shipment rather than truck delivery. The N. W. <b>T.</b> <b>food</b> retailing structure comprises three types of food retailers: the independently operated stores, the cooperatives and chain stores. This first examination of the similarities and differences between the store types is drawn from a mail survey of all the <b>food</b> retailers <b>in</b> the N. W. <b>T.</b> The <b>food</b> retailers have adapted to the small, isolated northern markets by expanding their merchandise line well beyond food products. The Hudson’s Bay Company stores carry the widest variety of merchandise, while the others carry a more limited product line. Inventory management varies among the store types. The cooperatives generally fail to use the cheaper alternative transportation modes (road or water) where possible. This is not due to location but may reflect poor managerial skills or simply a lack of profit motivation...|$|R

40|$|RATIONALE: Brain 5 -HT 2 C receptors {{form part}} of a neural network that {{controls}} eating behaviour. 5 -HT 2 C receptor agonists decrease food intake by activating proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus, but recent research in rodents has suggested that 5 -HT 2 C receptor agonists may also act via dopaminergic circuitry to reduce the rewarding value of food and other reinforcers. No mechanistic studies {{on the effects of}} 5 -HT 2 C agonists on <b>food</b> intake <b>in</b> humans have been conducted to date. OBJECTIVES: The present study examined the effects of the 5 -HT 2 C receptor agonist meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) on food consumption, eating microstructure and blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses to <b>food</b> pictures <b>in</b> healthy female volunteers. METHODS: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design, participants were randomized immediately after screening to receive oral mCPP (30 mg) in a single morning dose, or placebo, in a counterbalanced order. <b>Test</b> <b>foods</b> were served from a Universal Eating Monitor (UEM) that measured eating rate and fMRI BOLD signals to the sight of food and non-food images were recorded. RESULTS: mCPP decreased rated appetite and intake of a palatable snack eaten in the absence of hunger but had no significant effect on the consumption of a pasta lunch (although pasta eating rate was reduced). mCPP also decreased BOLD fMRI responses to the sight of <b>food</b> pictures <b>in</b> areas of reward-associated circuitry. A post hoc analysis identified individual variability in the response to mCPP (exploratory responder-non-responder analysis). Some participants did not reduce their cookie intake after treatment with mCPP and this lack of response was associated with enhanced ratings of cookie pleasantness and enhanced baseline BOLD responses to <b>food</b> images <b>in</b> key reward and appetite circuitry. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that 5 -HT 2 C receptor activation <b>in</b> humans inhibits <b>food</b> reward-related responding and that further investigation of stratification of responding to mCPP and other 5 -HT 2 C receptor agonists is warranted...|$|R

40|$|The {{excellent}} pharmacological profile {{displayed by}} the selective nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) peptide (NOP) receptor antagonist SB- 612111 [(-) -cis- 1 -methyl- 7 -[[4 -(2, 6 -dichlorophenyl) piperidin- 1 -yl]methyl]- 6, 7, 8, 9 -tetrahydro- 5 H-benzocyclohepten- 5 -ol] in vitro prompted us {{to investigate the}} actions of this compound in vivo. In the mouse tail withdrawal assay, SB- 612111 given i. p. up to 3 mg/kg did not modify per se tail withdrawal latencies but was able to prevent the pronociceptive and the antinociceptive action of 1 nmol of N/OFQ given i. c. v. and i. <b>t.,</b> respectively. <b>In</b> <b>food</b> intake studies performed in sated mice, SB- 612111 (1 mg/kg i. p.) {{had no effect on}} food consumption but fully prevented the orexigenic effect of 1 nmol of N/OFQ i. c. v. In 17 -h food-deprived mice, the opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone (1 mg/kg s. c.), but not SB- 612111 (1 and 10 mg/kg i. p.), produced a statistically significant reduction of <b>food</b> intake. <b>In</b> the mouse forced swimming and tail suspension tests, SB- 612111 (1 - 10 mg/kg) reduced immobility time. The antidepressant-like effect elicited by SB- 612111 in the forced swimming test was reversed by the i. c. v. injection of 1 nmol of N/OFQ and no longer evident in mice knockout for the NOP receptor gene. In conclusion, the present findings demonstrate that SB- 612111 behaves in vivo as a potent and selective NOP antagonist and suggest that the N/OFQ-NOP receptor endogenous system {{plays an important role in}} regulating mood-related behaviors. The use of SB- 612111 in future pathophysiological studies will certainly contribute to define the therapeutic potential of selective NOP receptor antagonists in different disease areas...|$|R
