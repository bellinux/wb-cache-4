5|$|After {{the repeal}} of the Stamp Act, Parliament took a {{different}} approach <b>to</b> <b>raising</b> revenue, passing the 1767 Townshend Acts, which established new duties on various imports and strengthened the customs agency by creating the American Customs Board. The British government believed that a more efficient customs system was necessary because many colonial American merchants had been smuggling. Smugglers violated the Navigation Acts by trading with ports outside of the British Empire and avoiding import taxes. Parliament hoped that the new system would reduce smuggling and generate revenue for the government.|$|E
5|$|After {{the repeal}} of the Stamp Act, Parliament took a {{different}} approach <b>to</b> <b>raising</b> revenue, passing the Townshend Acts in 1767 which established new duties on various goods imported into the colonies. These duties were relatively low because the British ministry wanted to establish the precedent that Parliament had the right to impose tariffs on the colonies before raising them. Revenues from these duties were to be used to pay for governors and judges who would be independent of colonial control. To enforce compliance with the new laws, the Townshend Acts created a customs agency known as the American Board of Custom Commissioners, which was headquartered in Boston.|$|E

5|$|Terraforming is {{a natural}} {{outgrowth}} of colonizing an alien world. The first playable prototype was just a map generator that tested climate changes during the game. This required the designers to create a world builder program and climatic model far more powerful than anything they'd done before. Temperature, wind, and rainfall patterns were modeled in ways that allow players to make changes: for example, creating a ridge-line and then watching the effects. In addition <b>to</b> <b>raising</b> terrain, the player can also divert rivers, dig huge boreholes into the planet's mantle, and melt ice caps.|$|E

Confederate veterans and others in Hampshire County undertook additional fundraising efforts, including entertainment shows and general solicitation. In addition <b>to</b> <b>raising</b> funds {{for the construction of}} the memorial, the Confederate Memorial Association also raised money for the widows and children of the Confederate dead. By October15, 1866, the gross receipts returned to the association's treasury amounted to $1,170.91 USD, of which the Confederate Memorial Association provided $421.58 USD to the Confederate widows and orphaned children. Fundraising continued until June 1867.|$|E

5|$|In 1823, the Synod paid a {{significant}} portion of Queen's College's debts in order to place the institution on a secure financial footing and enable it to reopen. With the second reopening, the Synod provided clergymen to serve at the college as theology professors. Livingston had dedicated several years <b>to</b> <b>raising</b> money for the effort but died shortly before Queen's College reopened in 1825. The Rev. Philip Milledoler, a Reformed clergyman from New York City, was appointed to fill the vacancy created by Livingston's death. Milledoler persuaded one of his parishioners, Colonel Henry Rutgers (1745–1830), to support the college. The trustees subsequently renamed it Rutgers College in his honour. At first, the Synod exercised oversight over the operations of the college, but by 1840 directed its attentions solely to the operation of the seminary. During this period Rutgers College, the college's grammar school (now Rutgers Preparatory School), and the seminary shared one building, known as Old Queens (built 1809-1823) until the two schools separated operations entirely in 1856.|$|E
5|$|On the Texas coast, Arlene {{produced}} a small storm surge peaking at 4 ft (1.2 m) in some areas, breaching sections of Padre Island and causing flooding. The storm tide also eroded up to a foot (0.3 m) of sand from beaches {{in the lower}} Texas coast. Combined with the heavy rainfall associated with Arlene, the storm surge produced significant tidal flooding in some coastal stretches. Beach erosion occurred {{as far north as}} Galveston Bay, where tides were reported to be as high as 5 ft (1.5 m). A woman was swept into the sea off a jetty near Freeport and required rescue by United States Coast Guard. Over the waters of Lake Corpus Christi, a large funnel cloud was reported but never touched down or caused any damage. Nearby, the John F. Kennedy Memorial Causeway was completely inundated {{with the exception of one}} lane, prompting an extensive study of possible solutions <b>to</b> <b>raising</b> the causeway nearly two years later.|$|E
5|$|Prawirowihardjo took <b>to</b> <b>raising</b> the boy as his own, which {{provided}} Suharto a father-figure and a stable home in Wuryantoro. In 1931, {{he moved to}} the town of Wonogiri to attend the primary school, living first with Prawirohardjo's son Sulardi, and later with his father's relative Hardjowijono. While living with Hardjowijono, Suharto became acquinted with Darjatmo, a dukun ("shaman") of Javanese mystical arts and faith healing. The experience deeply affected him and later, as president, Suharto surrounded himself with powerful symbolic language. Difficulties in paying the fees for his education in Wonogiri resulted in another move back to his father in Kemusuk, where he continued studying at a lower-fee Muhammadiyah middle school in the city of Yogyakarta until 1939.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the war the LSO had to face new competition. The BBC SO and the LPO {{had survived}} the war intact, the latter, {{abandoned}} by Beecham, as a self-governing body. All three were quickly overshadowed by two new orchestras: Walter Legge's Philharmonia and Beecham's Royal Philharmonic (RPO). To survive, the LSO played in hundreds of concerts of popular classics under undistinguished conductors. By 1948 the orchestra was anxious to resume promoting its own concert series. The players decided to accept the Arts Council's conditions for subsidy, and changed the LSO's constitution to replace profit-sharing with salaries. With a view <b>to</b> <b>raising</b> its playing standards it engaged Josef Krips as conductor. His commitments in Vienna preventing him from becoming the LSO's chief conductor until 1950, but from his first concert with the orchestra in December 1948 he influenced the playing for the better. His chosen repertoire was good for the box office: cycles of Beethoven symphonies and concertos (the latter featuring Wilhelm Kempff in one season and Claudio Arrau in another) helped restore the orchestra's finances as well as its musical standards. With Krips and others the orchestra recorded extensively for the Decca Record Company during the early 1950s. The orchestra's workload in these years was second only to the other self-governing London orchestra, the LPO: the LPO played 248 concerts in the 1949–50 season; the LSO 103; the BBC SO 55; the Philharmonia and RPO 32 each. When the Royal Festival Hall opened in 1951 the LSO and LPO engaged in a mutually bruising campaign for sole residency there. Neither was successful, and the Festival Hall became the main London venue for both orchestras and for the RPO and Philharmonia.|$|E
5|$|The last hearing {{exhausted}} Frank's ordinary state appeal rights. On March 7, 1914, Frank's execution {{was set for}} April 17 of that year. The defense {{continued to}} investigate the case and filed an extraordinary motion before the Georgia Supreme Court. This appeal, which would be held before a single justice, Ben Hill, was restricted <b>to</b> <b>raising</b> facts not available at the original trial. The application for appeal resulted in a stay of execution and the hearing opened on April 23, 1914. The defense successfully obtained a number of affidavits from witnesses repudiating their testimony. A state biologist said in a newspaper interview that his microscopic examination of {{the hair on the}} lathe shortly after the murder did not match Phagan's. At {{the same time that the}} various repudiations were leaked to the newspapers, the state was busy seeking repudiations of the new affidavits. An analysis of the murder notes, which had only been addressed in any detail in the closing arguments, suggested Conley composed them in the basement rather than writing what Frank told him to write in his office. Prison letters written by Conley to Annie Maude Carter were discovered; the defense then argued that these, along with Carter's testimony, implicated Conley was the actual murderer.|$|E
