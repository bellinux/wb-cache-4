2500|$|The Norden thus {{calculated}} two angles: {{the range}} angle {{based on the}} altitude, airspeed and ballistics; and the current angle to the <b>target,</b> <b>based</b> on the ground speed and heading of the aircraft. The {{difference between these two}} angles represented the [...] "correction" [...] that needed to be applied to bring the aircraft over the proper drop point. If the aircraft was properly aligned with the target on the bomb run, the difference between the range and target angles would be continually reduced, eventually to zero (within the accuracy of the mechanisms). At this moment the Norden automatically dropped the bombs.|$|E
2500|$|Structure-based drug design (or direct drug design) {{relies on}} {{knowledge}} of the three dimensional structure of the biological target obtained through methods such as x-ray crystallography or NMR spectroscopy. If an experimental structure of a target is not available, {{it may be possible}} to create a homology model of the <b>target</b> <b>based</b> on the experimental structure of a related protein. Using the structure of the biological target, candidate drugs that are predicted to bind with high affinity and selectivity to the target may be designed using interactive graphics and the intuition of a medicinal chemist. [...] Alternatively various automated computational procedures may be used to suggest new drug candidates.|$|E
2500|$|The primary two {{stimulus}} modalities {{used for}} negative priming research are visual and auditory stimulus materials. The stimulus presented varied from objects or symbols in visual field to human voices or artificial sounds. Stronger negative priming effects are found for auditory stimulus but the standardized effect sizes between the modalities did not vary. Evidence for negative priming {{has also been}} found across various modes of response including vocal naming, manual key press, and reaching. Negative priming was observed for various types of judgment such as identification, categorization, matching, counting and localization. The tasks used to find evidence for negative priming includes Stroop color–word task, lexical decision task, identification, matching, and localization tasks. The Stroop color–word task utilizes the Stroop effect to observe the distractor suppression and negative priming. Identification tasks present a set of [...] images, sounds, words, symbols, or letters and require the subject to select the prime <b>target</b> <b>based</b> a particular feature that differentiates the target from the distractor. Lexical decision utilizes semantic knowledge of the subject and tests the subject ability to remember the multiple meanings and uses of one word. For example, the word [...] "bank" [...] has multiple meanings and can be referred in different contexts such as [...] "bank {{is a place where}} money is deposited" [...] or [...] "banks of a river". Matching tasks require subjects to respond [...] "same" [...] or [...] "different" [...] by matching the target letters or shapes with the explicitly specified goal while ignoring the distractor. Localization tasks require some form of movement of subjects to respond to the location of the target stimulus. This type of localization task is especially used to test the feature mismatch hypothesis as it provides evidence for negative priming during the mismatch of the location and target stimuli.|$|E

40|$|The EcoRV DNA-(adenine-N 6) -methyltransferase (M. EcoRV) {{specifically}} modifies {{the first}} adenine residue within GATATC sequences. During catalysis, the enzyme flips its <b>target</b> <b>base</b> {{out of the}} DNA helix and binds it into a <b>target</b> <b>base</b> binding pocket which is formed in part by Lys 16 and Tyr 196. A cytosine residue is accepted by wild-type M. EcoRV as a substrate at a 31 -fold reduced efficiency {{with respect to the}} kcat/KM values if it is located in a CT mismatch substrate (GCTATC/GATATC). Cytosine residues positioned in a CG base pair (GCTATC/GATAGC) are modified at much more reduced rates, because flipping out the <b>target</b> <b>base</b> is much more difficult in this case. We intended to change the <b>target</b> <b>base</b> specificity of M. EcoRV from adenine-N 6 to cytosine-N 4. To this end we generated, purified and characterized 15 variants of the enzyme, containing single, double and triple amino acid exchanges following different design approaches. One concept was {{to reduce the size of}} the <b>target</b> <b>base</b> binding pocket by site-directed mutagenesis. The K 16 R variant showed an altered specificity, with a 22 -fold preference for cytosine as the <b>target</b> <b>base</b> in a mismatch substrate. This corresponds to a 680 -fold change in specificity, which was accompanied by only a small loss in catalytic activity with the cytosine substrate. The K 16 R/Y 196 W variant no longer methylated adenine residues at all and its activity towards cytosine was reduced only 17 -fold. Therefore, we have changed the <b>target</b> <b>base</b> specificity of M. EcoRV from adenine to cytosine by rational protein design. Because there are no natural paragons for the variants described here, a change of the <b>target</b> <b>base</b> specificity of a DNA interacting enzyme was possible by rational de novo design of its active site...|$|R

For screening experiments sputter <b>targets</b> <b>based</b> on zink-oxide were made by sintering, <b>targets</b> <b>based</b> on tin-oxide were manufactured by hot isostatic pressing, and <b>targets</b> <b>based</b> on metallic zink and tin were produced by melting and casting. As dopants elements like aluminum, antimony, inium, and fluorine were used. For the development of an improved blocker layer in the silverbased layer stack sputtering <b>targets</b> <b>based</b> on titanium-alloys were manufactured by electron beam melting. During the development process of the single-oxide coating the best thin film results were obtained with aluminum doped zink targets. Due to the lower manufacturing costs metallic targets were favoured over ceramic targets. The manufacturing process for these targets was scaled up in two steps and finally a target was made for the demonstrations run in a production-sized glass-coater. In addition recycling procedures were developed for tin, tin-oxide, and zink-based targets. (orig.)
