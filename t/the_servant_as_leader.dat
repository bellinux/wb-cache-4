In this story, we see a band of men on a mythical journey… The central figure of the story is Leo, who accompanies the party as the servant who does their menial chores, but who also sustains them with his spirit and his song. He is a person of extraordinary presence. All goes well until Leo disappears. Then the group falls into disarray and the journey is abandoned. They cannot make it without the servant Leo. The narrator, one of the party, after some years of wandering, finds Leo and is taken into the Order that had sponsored the journey. There he discovers that Leo, whom he had known first as servant, was in fact the titular head of the Order, its guiding spirit, a great and noble leader."

Additionally, this investigation will demonstrate and provide evidence that the characteristics necessary for educational leaders to overcome the challenges within education today, are the same characteristics that allowed the leaders within the biblical text to overcome challenges. Moreover, this study will examine the day-to-day educational issues that currently face superintendents and the historical issues from the biblical text and it will identify if the words, actions and deeds of Superintendents Hairston and Markley as well as King David and Apostle Paul demonstrates and provide evidence of Servant Leadership. The research questions of this study are as follows: What characteristics of servant leadership were found to be evident and were demonstrated by King David, Apostle Paul, Superintendent Hairston and Superintendent Markley in the resolution of challenges regarding: building and maintaining loyalty of followers, choosing and prioritizing resources, and demonstrating accountability of fidelity to the mission for all stakeholders? Lastly, this study will discuss the biblical lessons for educational leaders and how the tenets of servant leadership can be retrieved from the biblical text...|$|E
40|$|This study {{challenges}} {{the claim that}} Jesus is <b>the</b> archetypical <b>servant</b> <b>leader</b> <b>as</b> described in contempo-rary leadership literature. Based on a theological reading of the Fourth Gospel, the paper suggests that, <b>as</b> a <b>servant,</b> Jesus cannot be understood apart from his mission and obedience to God. Consequently, Jesus was not primarily a servant leader but rather the Son who {{was sent to the}} world to enact the Fa-ther’s will. In this regard, the Fourth Gospel provides a unique perspective that is barely noted in the current discourse on servant leadership modelled on the example of Christ. Although certain aspects of servant leadership theory correspond to John’s portrayal of Jesus, the study concludes that other de-scriptions of him <b>as</b> a <b>servant</b> <b>leader</b> suffer from a one-sided and reductionist Christology. Implications of this view for Christian ministry are briefly sketched out...|$|R

40|$|The present Thesis {{explores the}} {{possibility}} of applying a virtue ethics framework, based upon the Aristotelian tradition, into business ethics. The purpose of the Thesis is twofold: to give an overview of virtue ethics through Richard Taylor’s portrait and to offer a specific account of virtue ethics focused on the business realm. The examination of this virtue ethics proposal is largely founded on Robert C. Solomon’s works, which constitute the cornerstone of this Thesis. However, the critical nature of this examination requires serious criticism of both Taylor’s account of virtue ethics {{as well as of}} Solomon’s main articles and books on the topic under scrutiny. Remaining critical includes pointing out the existing flaws in their proposals. Ultimately, the aim is to show how a reinterpretation of Aristotle and virtue ethics can result in a pluralistic account of business ethics. Such interpretation, which revolves around the notion of ‘ethical styles’, is derived from Nietzsche’s understanding of the uniqueness of virtues. Attention to circumstances and flexibility characterize an ethical approach that, this Thesis will contend, is better suited than the traditional utilitarian and Kantian traditions for answering contemporary ethical business dilemmas. Eventually, reinterpreting the virtue ethics tradition will make new space for ethical solutions and discourses to emerge. An example of such a theory is offered in this Thesis. A tripartite approach, based on J. Thomas Whetstone’s account, will stress that there is no reductive conception that can reflect the complexity of our moral existence. Rather, a combination of the different existing traditions will result in the figure of <b>the</b> <b>servant</b> <b>leader</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> ideal towards which board members and executives should strive. An analysis of the function of those expressions used to define business will also {{play a major role in}} this Thesis. The ever-growing presence of influential corporations in contemporary markets and social scenarios should alert the reader that it is in society’s hands to change the course of humanity and to lead the present towards a more humane and ethical future...|$|R
40|$|County Public Library, {{was asked}} to name the most {{important}} skill for her job, she replied without hesitation, "Leadership. " Beverly emphasized that a good leader creates a working environment in which all employees feel that {{their contributions to the}} organization are valued. She noted that even new and relatively inexperi-enced employees may nevertheless offer valuable insights and fresh ideas to library issues. Finally, she said that she always tries to pay her staff a living wage and provide funds for their continuing professional development. Although Beverly didn't attach a name to her style of leadership, her priorities suggest some of the attributes of what is known as servant-leadership. This article will explore the concept of servant-leader-ship and its possible application to the management of public libraries. Servant-leadership, a term coined by Robert K. Greenleaf in 1969, is a form of leadership that empha-sizes the concept of service. Greenleaf (1904 - 1990), a management theorist and practicing Quaker, enjoyed a forty-year career at AT&T before retiring to found the Center for Applied Ethics, now called the Greenleaf Center for Servant-Leadership, in 1964. Greenleaf (1977), in his seminal essay <b>The</b> <b>Servant</b> <b>as</b> <b>Leader,</b> relates that the concept of servant-leadership came out of his reading of Herman Hesse's]ourney to the East. This story features a group of men who are making a kind of physicaJ and spiritual journey to the east. A cheerful and helpful servant known as Leo seems to raise the spirits of everyone as he goes about his menial work. One day, however, Leo disappears. As a result, the group is thrown into disarray and is unable to complete its journey. Much later in d 1 e story, the narrator meets Leo again and discovers that the servant, Leo, was actually the leader of the Order that had sponsored the journey. Greenleaf (1977) notes that "this story clearly says that the great leader is seen as servant first, and that simple fact is seen as the key to his greatness " (p. 7). Greenleafs insight into Hesse's story, together with a lifetime of work exploring how organizations, leaders, and employees interact, led him to articulate a set of principles that define the idea...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to explore {{conditions}} under which the human spirit flowers in modern organisations. The topic of the thesis was sparked by prolonged study at the Master’s level of the writings of Robert K. Greenleaf, modern servant leadership theorist. Greenleaf was concerned with the ways and {{the conditions in which}} the human spirit flowers. He wrote a number of essays on the topic (Greenleaf, 1996 b). He often questioned what organisations as they currently stood were doing to help people grow as whole people. As workers spend increasing amounts of time in the workplace, organisations continue to seek ways in which to increase employee satisfaction and decrease the compartmentalising of human experience. The geographical context of study is that of Aotearoa/New Zealand with participants selected from the Church Educational System of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in the Tāmaki-makau-rau/Auckland region. The Church Educational System, or CES, is a worldwide religious education provider headquartered in the Western United States. The context for study was chosen based on my perceived personal growth as a student for nine years in the CES programmes and my desire to understand how the programme was administered in Aotearoa/New Zealand. The project employs a qualitative methodology using as primary data gathering methods in-depth interviews with three CES directors, three focus groups made up of sixteen volunteer teachers, classroom observations, and document analysis. Using Greenleaf’s descriptions of <b>the</b> <b>servant</b> <b>leader</b> <b>as</b> a central focus, I attempt through this qualitative study to address the central research question: How does the Church Educational System (CES) nurture <b>servant</b> leaders? <b>The</b> central metaphor of the garden was used in processing and analysing data. The garden metaphor was intended to assist in the conceptualisation of relationships of service as they are at work in the lives of participants. Identified relationships of service from the findings were between participants co-workers (plants), love (life-force), Jesus Christ (sun), The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (plot), purpose (strength), Aotearoa/New Zealand (soil), exemplars (canopy), experience (seasons), Church Educational System (gardener), positions, training, programmes (gardener tools), growth (colour/aroma/fruit), knowledge (water), and organisational care (pruning/transplanting). Findings indicated that nurturing in the Church Educational System is influenced by the ability of the organisation to bring people together in meaningful ways. Findings also show that understanding relationships of service that make up whole people may be an important step for organisations in <b>the</b> nurturing of <b>servant</b> leaders. Nurturing in the CES appears to be taking place in three primary areas: balancing, renewal, and regeneration. The findings of this study have significance for those inside and outside of the CES. A chapter is dedicated to exploring possible application of findings in variant organisational contexts. Providing consistent formal and informal opportunities for sharing in spirit and intellect at the organisational level appears to be a key in <b>the</b> nurturing of <b>servant</b> leaders in organisations...|$|R
