5|$|As {{the site}} of the Necropolis station had been {{intentionally}} chosen <b>to</b> <b>abut</b> the arches of the LSWR's viaduct, it acted as an obstacle to any {{increase in the number of}} lines serving Waterloo station. Urban growth in the area of what is now south west London, through which trains from Waterloo ran, led to congestion at the station, only slightly alleviated by the LSWR's 1877 takeover of the western LNC track. In the 1890s the situation became untenable, and the LSWR began to investigate the possibility of repositioning the LNC station to permit the expansion of the main line terminus.|$|E

Robert Lundberg, in his book [...] "Historical Lute Construction", suggests ancient builders placed bars according to whole-number ratios of the scale length and belly length.

60|$|The trivial {{experience}} {{of every day}} is always verifying some old prediction to us and converting into things the words and signs which we had heard and seen without heed. A lady with whom I was riding in the forest {{said to me that}} the woods always seemed to her to wait, as if the genii who inhabit them suspended their deeds until the wayfarer had passed onward; a thought which poetry has celebrated in the dance of the fairies, which breaks off on the approach of human feet. The man who has seen the rising moon break out of the clouds at midnight, has been present like an archangel at the creation of light and of the world. I remember one summer day in the fields my companion pointed out to me a broad cloud, which might extend {{a quarter of a mile}} parallel to the horizon, quite accurately in the form of a cherub as painted over churches,--a round block in the centre, which it was easy to animate with eyes and mouth, supported on either side by wide-stretched symmetrical wings. What appears once in the atmosphere may appear often, and it was undoubtedly the archetype of that familiar ornament. I have seen in the sky a chain of summer lightning which at once showed to me that the Greeks drew from nature when they painted the thunderbolt in the hand of Jove. I have seen a snow-drift along the sides of the stone wall which obviously gave the idea of the common architectural scroll <b>to</b> <b>abut</b> a tower.|$|E
6000|$|The Squire {{came out}} {{on the top of the}} rise, and all Worsted Scotton was in sight. It was a sandy stretch of broom and gorse and heather, with a few Scotch firs; it had no value at all, and he longed for it, as a boy might long for the bite someone else had {{snatched}} out of his apple. It distressed him lying there, his and yet not his, like a wife who was no wife--as though Fortune were enjoying her at his expense. Thus was he deprived of the fulness of his mental image; for as with all men, so with the Squire, that which he loved and owned took definite form--a some thing that he saw. Whenever the words [...] "Worsted Skeynes" [...] were in his mind--and that was almost always--there rose before him an image defined and concrete, however indescribable; and what ever this image was, he knew that Worsted Scotton spoiled it. It was true that he could not think of any use to which to put the Common, but he felt deeply that it was pure dog-in-the-mangerism of the cottagers, and this he could not stand. Not one beast in two years had fattened on its barrenness. Three old donkeys alone eked out the remnants of their days. A bundle of firewood or old bracken, a few peat sods from one especial corner, were all the selfish peasants gathered. But the cottagers were no great matter--he could soon have settled them; it was that fellow Peacock whom he could not settle, just because he happened <b>to</b> <b>abut</b> on the Common, and his fathers had been nasty before him. Mr. Pendyce rode round looking at the fence his father had put up, until he came to the portion that Peacock's father had pulled down; and here, by a strange fatality--such as will happen even in printed records--he came on Peacock himself standing in the gap, as though he had foreseen this visit of the Squire's. The mare stopped of her own accord, the spaniel John at a measured distance lay down to think, and all those yards away he could be heard doing it, and now and then swallowing his tongue.|$|E
60|$|On {{the left}} hand, {{the lower part}} (AA) {{consists}} of regular, alternating strata of brown tuffs and greenish laminated mudstone, gently inclined to the right, and conformably covered by a mass (B left) of a white, tufaceous and brecciolated deposit. On the right hand, the whole cliff (BB right) consists of the same white tufaceous matter, which on this side presents scarcely a trace of stratification, but to the left becomes very gradually and rather indistinctly divided into strata quite conformable with the underlying beds (AA): moreover, {{a few hundred yards}} further to the left, where the surface has been less denuded, the tufaceous strata (B left) are conformably covered by another set of strata, like the underlying ones (AA) of this section. In the middle of the diagram, the beds (AA) are seen to be abruptly cut off, and <b>to</b> <b>abut</b> against the tufaceous non-stratified mass; but the line of junction has been accidentally not represented steep enough, for I particularly noticed that before the beds had been tilted to the right, this line must have been nearly vertical. It appears that a current of water cut for itself a deep and steep submarine channel, {{and at the same time}} or afterwards filled it up with the tufaceous and brecciolated matter, and spread the same over the surrounding submarine beds; the matter becoming stratified in these more distant and less troubled parts, and being moreover subsequently covered up by other strata (like AA) not shown in the diagram. It is singular that three of the beds (of AA) are prolonged in their proper direction, as represented, beyond the line of junction into the white tufaceous matter: the prolonged portions of two of the beds are rounded; in the third, the terminal fragment has been pushed upwards: how these beds could have been left thus prolonged, I will not pretend to explain. In another section on the opposite side of a promontory, there was at the foot of this same line of junction, that is at the bottom of the old submarine channel, a pile of fragments of the strata (AA), with their interstices filled up with white tufaceous matter: this is exactly what might have been anticipated under such circumstances.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of signal length on the performance of a signal source separation method, independent component analysis (ICA), when extracting the visual evoked potential (EP) lambda wave from saccade-related electro-encephalogram (EEG) waveforms. A method was devised that enabled the effective length of the recorded EEG traces to be increased prior to processing by ICA. This involved abutting EEG traces from an appropriate number of successive trials (a trial was a set of waveforms recorded from 64 electrode locations in a study investigating saccade performance). ICA was applied to the saccade-related EEG and electro-oculogram (EOG) waveforms recorded from the electrode locations. One spatial and five temporal features of the lambda wave were monitored to assess the performance of ICA applied <b>to</b> both <b>abutted</b> and non-abutted waveforms. ICA applied <b>to</b> <b>abutted</b> trials managed <b>to</b> extract all six features across all seven subjects included in the study.

40|$|Background/purpose: Little {{is known}} about the force-transmission {{characteristics}} and patterns of telescopic-retained removable partial dentures (RPDs) as related to their type and rigidity (rigid and/or resilient) and the number of abutting teeth supporting the telescopic dentures. In this study, we compared the strain around the abutting teeth and edentulous ridges supporting telescopic-retained RPDs with different designs using a strain gauge technique. Materials and methods: A maxillary model including four abutting teeth (# 14, 13, 23, and 24) was constructed and is referred to as Case 1. In total, four RPD frameworks (two resilient and two rigid) were fabricated for Case 1 with a conventional telescope retainer and attachment-retained telescopic retainer (ARTR) groups. A vertical static load of 280 N was applied, and strain values obtained from the strain gauges were recorded. RPDs were modified according to the following cases—Case 2 included teeth 14, 13, and 23; Case 3 included teeth 14 and 13; and Case 4 included teeth 13 and 23 —and measurements were repeated. A randomized block analysis of the variance test was conducted using a general linear model procedure with statistical software. Multiple comparisons between groups were performed using Tukey’s honest significant difference test (α= 0. 05). Results: RPDs with an ARTR produced more strain distal <b>to</b> the <b>abutting</b> teeth than RPDs with a conventional telescope retainer. Both retainer types with a rigid design produced more strain distal <b>to</b> the <b>abutting</b> teeth than did retainers with a resilient design. RPDs supported by four, three, and two unilateral abutting teeth produced similar strain patterns. RPDs supported by two bilateral abutting teeth produced the highest strain distal <b>to</b> the <b>abutting</b> teeth, but {{there was no significant difference}} between the strains produced by RPDs supported by either two unilateral or bilateral abutting teeth. The highest strain values were obtained from strain gauges distal <b>to</b> the “terminal” <b>abutting</b> teeth. Directions of the principal strain were in a vertical direction for gauges located distal <b>to</b> the terminal <b>abutting</b> teeth. More strain was produced on the posterior edentulous ridges. Conclusion: RPDs with an ARTR and both retainer types with a rigid design produced more strain distal <b>to</b> the <b>abutting</b> teeth. Using more than two abutting teeth did not improve the strain patterns of the tested RPDs. More strain was produced on the posterior edentulous ridges...|$|R
