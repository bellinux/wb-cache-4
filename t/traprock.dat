5|$|Of all {{the summits}} {{that make up}} the Metacomet Ridge, West Rock, in New Haven, Connecticut, bears special mention because it was not formed by the {{volcanic}} flooding that created most of the <b>traprock</b> ridges. Rather, it is the remains of an enormous volcanic dike through which the basalt lava floods found access to the surface.|$|E
5|$|Native Americans {{occupied}} the river valleys surrounding the Metacomet Ridge {{for at least}} 10,000 years. Major tribal groups active in the area included the Quinnipiac, Niantic, Pequot, Pocomtuc, and Mohegan. <b>Traprock</b> was used to make tools and arrowheads. Natives hunted game, gathered plants and fruits, and fished in local bodies of water around the Metacomet Ridge. Tracts of woodland in the river bottoms surrounding the ridges were sometimes burned to facilitate the cultivation of crops such as corn, squash, tobacco, and beans.|$|E
5|$|While the <b>traprock</b> cliffs {{remain the}} most obvious {{evidence}} of the prehistoric geologic processes of the Metacomet Ridge, the sedimentary rock of the ridge and surrounding terrain has produced equally significant evidence of prehistoric life {{in the form of}} Triassic and Jurassic fossils; in particular, dinosaur tracks. At a state park in Rocky Hill, Connecticut, more than 2,000 well preserved early Jurassic prints have been excavated. Other sites in Holyoke and Greenfield have likewise produced significant finds.|$|E
5|$|With {{the advent}} of {{industrialization}} in the 19th century, riverways beneath the Metacomet Ridge were dammed to provide power as the labor force expanded in nearby cities and towns. Logging to provide additional fuel for mills further denuded the ridges. <b>Traprock</b> and sandstone were quarried from the ridge for paving stones and architectural brownstone, either used locally or shipped via rail, barge, and boat.|$|E
5|$|North of Mount Tom and the Holyoke Range, the {{apparent}} {{crest of the}} Metacomet Ridge is broken by a discontinuity in the once dominant <b>traprock</b> strata. Underlying sedimentary layers remain but lack the same profile. Between the Holyoke Range and the Pocumtuck Ridge, a stretch of , the Metacomet Ridge exists only {{as a series of}} mostly nondescript rises set among flat plains of sedimentary bedrock. Mount Warner, , in Hadley, Massachusetts, the only significant peak in the area, is a geologically unrelated metamorphic rock landform that extends west into the sedimentary strata.|$|E
5|$|The Metacomet Ridge is {{the result}} of {{continental}} rifting processes that took place 200 million years ago during the Triassic and Jurassic periods. The basalt (also called <b>traprock)</b> crest of the Metacomet Ridge {{is the product of a}} series of massive lava flows hundreds of feet thick that welled up in faults created by the rifting apart of the North American continent from Eurasia and Africa. Essentially, the area now occupied by the Metacomet Ridge is a prehistoric rift valley which was once a branch of (or a parallel of) the major rift to the east that became the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Europeans began {{settling}} the river valleys around the Metacomet Ridge in the mid–17th century. Forests were cut down or burned {{to make room}} for agriculture, resulting in the near complete denuding of the once contiguous forests of southern New England by the 19th century. Steep terrain like the Metacomet Ridge, while not suitable for planting crops, was widely harvested of timber {{as a result of the}} expanding charcoal industry that boomed before the mining of coal from the mid–Appalachian regions replaced it as a source of fuel. In other cases, ridgetop forests burned when lower elevation land was set afire, and some uplands were used for pasturing. <b>Traprock</b> was harvested from talus slopes of the Metacomet Ridge to build house foundations; copper ore was discovered at the base of Peak Mountain in northern Connecticut and was mined by prisoners incarcerated at Old Newgate Prison located there.|$|E
25|$|The Metacomet Ridge extends {{west from}} East Rock as series of smaller, unnoteworthy <b>traprock</b> {{outcrops}} to West Rock Ridge; it extends east over another series of <b>traprock</b> outcrops to Saltonstall Mountain and Peter's Rock. The {{west side of}} East Rock drains into the Mill River thence to New Haven Harbor and Long Island Sound; the east side into the Quinnipiac River, thence to New Haven Harbor and Long Island Sound. Both rivers abut {{the base of the}} mountain.|$|E
25|$|The {{topography}} of present-day Science Hill was primarily formed during the Wisconsinan glaciation. The Laurentide ice sheet flattened the soft sandstone of New Haven Harbor but had less effect on its surrounding, hard trap rock formations like East Rock and West Rock. Science Hill is {{a portion of}} a sandstone drumlin that was sheltered from glacial erosion by a <b>traprock</b> ridge, Mill Rock, to its north.|$|E
25|$|The Holyoke Range or Mount Holyoke Range is a <b>traprock</b> {{mountain}} range {{located in the}} Connecticut River Valley of Massachusetts. It is a sub-range of the narrow, linear Metacomet Ridge that extends from Long Island Sound near New Haven, Connecticut north through the Connecticut River Valley of Massachusetts to the Vermont border.

Hot, dry upper slopes, cool, moist ravines, and mineral-rich ledges of basalt talus produce a combination of microclimate ecosystems on the mountain that support plant and animal species uncommon in greater Connecticut. Besek Mountain is also an important raptor migration path. (See Metacomet Ridge for more information on the geology and ecosystem of Besek Mountain).|$|E
25|$|The Holyoke Range hosts a {{combination}} of microclimates unusual in New England.

Eastern red cedar, a dry-loving species, clings to the barren edges of cliffs. Backslope plant communities tend to be more similar to the adjacent Berkshire plateau containing species common to the northern hardwood and oak-hickory forest forest types. Eastern hemlock crowds narrow ravines, blocking sunlight and creating damp, cooler growing conditions with associated cooler climate plant species. Talus slopes are especially rich in nutrients and support a number of calcium-loving plants uncommon in Massachusetts. Because the <b>traprock</b> ridges generate such varied terrain, they are the home of several plant and animal species that are state-listed or globally rare, such as the timber rattlesnake.|$|E

500|$|Because of its narrowness, {{proximity}} to urban areas, and fragile ecosystems, the Metacomet Ridge is most endangered by encroaching suburban sprawl. Quarry operations, also a threat, have obliterated several {{square miles of}} <b>traprock</b> ridgeline in both Massachusetts and Connecticut. Ridges and mountains affected include Trimountain, Bradley Mountain, Totoket Mountain, Chauncey Peak, Rattlesnake Mountain, East Mountain, Pocumtuck Ridge, and the former Round Mountain of the Holyoke Range.

500|$|The basalt floods of lava {{that now}} form {{much of the}} Metacomet Ridge took place over a span of 20 million years. Erosion and {{deposition}} occurring between the eruptions deposited layers of sediment between the lava flows which eventually lithified into sedimentary rock layers within the basalt. The resulting [...] "layer cake" [...] of basalt and sedimentary rock eventually faulted and tilted upward (see fault-block). Subsequent erosion wore away many of the weaker sedimentary layers {{at a faster rate}} than the basalt layers, leaving the abruptly tilted edges of the basalt sheets exposed, creating the distinct linear ridge and dramatic cliff faces visible today on the western and northern sides of the ridge. Evidence of this layer-cake structure is visible on Mount Norwottuck of the Holyoke Range in Massachusetts. The summit of Norwottuck is made of basalt; directly beneath the summit are the Horse Caves, a deep overhang where the weaker sedimentary layer has worn away at a more rapid rate than the basalt layer above it. Mount Sugarloaf, Pocumtuck Ridge, and Mount Toby, also in Massachusetts, together present a larger [...] "layer cake" [...] example. The bottom layer is composed of arkose sandstone, visible on Mount Sugarloaf. The middle layer is composed of volcanic <b>traprock,</b> most visible on the Pocumtuck Ridge. The top layer is composed of a sedimentary conglomerate known as Mount Toby Conglomerate. Faulting and earthquakes during the period of continental rifting tilted the layers diagonally; subsequent erosion and glacial activity exposed the tilted layers of sandstone, basalt, and conglomerate visible today as three distinct mountain masses. Although Mount Toby and Mount Sugarloaf are not composed of <b>traprock,</b> {{they are part of the}} Metacomet Ridge by virtue of their origin via the same rifting and uplift processes.|$|E

2500|$|The {{origin of}} Chauncey Peak and the Metacomet Ridge dates back 200 {{million years ago}} with the rifting apart of North America from Eurasia in the process that would {{ultimately}} create the Atlantic Ocean. In the area that is now the Metacomet Ridge and surrounding sedimentary rock basin, massive basalt (<b>traprock)</b> lava flows spread across the prehistoric rift valley, some of them several hundred feet thick, over a period of 20 million years. [...] Sediment accumulated between lava flows and lithified into sedimentary rock. [...] After the rifting processes ceased, layers of strata faulted and tilted upward. Subsequent erosion, glaciation, and uplift exposed the weather resistant edge of the <b>traprock</b> lava sheets, creating the cliffline of the Metacomet Ridge as it is today. The mineral content and the shape of the ridge make possible a variety of microclimate ecosystems. Hot and dry cliff faces support plant and animal species uncommon so far north. Deeply gouged ravines support cooler climate species found in more northerly climes, while gradual backslope environments support species typical of the surrounding latitude. Talus slopes beneath cliffs accumulate minerals that support alkaline-loving plant species uncommon in surrounding acidic southern New England. Extensive cliffs provide ideal habitat and important migration corridors for raptor species.|$|E
