500|$|According to The Greenwood Encyclopedia of African American Folklore (2006), Fear of a Black Planet {{introduced}} a production style that [...] "borrowed elements from jazz, especially that of John Coltrane, {{to craft a}} soundscape that was more challenging than that of their previous two albums, but still complemented the complex social commentary". Journalist Kembrew McLeod called the music [...] "both agitprop and pop, mixing politics with the live-wire <b>thrill</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> popular music experience", adding that the Bomb Squad [...] "took sampling {{to the level of}} high art while keeping intact hip hop's populist heart.

500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{praised the}} film in his review saying, [...] "The Prince of Egypt {{is one of the}} best-looking {{animated}} films ever made. It employs computer-generated animation as an aid to traditional techniques, rather than as a substitute for them, and we sense the touch of human artists in the vision behind the Egyptian monuments, the lonely desert vistas, the <b>thrill</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> chariot race, the personalities of the characters. This is a film that shows animation growing up and embracing more complex themes, instead of chaining itself in the category of children's entertainment." [...] Richard Corliss of Time magazine gave a negative review of the film saying, [...] "The film lacks creative exuberance, any side pockets of joy." [...] Stephen Hunter from The Washington Post praised the film saying, [...] "The movie's proudest accomplishment is that it revises our version of Moses toward something more immediate and believable, more humanly knowable." ...|$|E
500|$|However, not all {{critics were}} {{impressed}} with the film's structure. Marjorie Baumgarten wrote, [...] "In forward progression, the narrative would garner little interest, thus making the reverse storytelling a filmmaker's conceit."

Once the visceral <b>thrill</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> puzzle structure begins to wear off, there's nothing left to hang onto. The film itself fades like one of Leonard's temporary memories." [...] While Roger Ebert gave the film a favorable {{three out of four}} stars, he did not think it warranted multiple viewings. After watching Memento twice, he concluded that [...] "Greater understanding helped on the plot level, but didn't enrich the viewing experience. Confusion is the state we are intended to be in." [...] Jonathan Rosenbaum disliked the film, and commented in his review of Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind that Memento is a [...] "gimmicky and unpoetic counterfeit" [...] of Alain Resnais's 1968 film Je t'aime, je t'aime.|$|E

500|$|The newfound {{success in}} roguelike-likes is {{considered}} {{part of a larger}} trend in those that play both board and computer games, looking for [...] "rich play experiences", as described by 100 Rogues developer Keith Burgun, that more popular titles may not always offer. David Bamguart of Gaslight Games stated that there is a <b>thrill</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> risk inherent in roguelike-likes with random generation and permadeath, helping the player become more invested in the fate of their player character: [...] "The deadly precariousness inherent to the unknown environments of roguelikes gives that investment a great deal of meaning." [...] Additionally, many of these newer roguelike-likes strive to address the apparent high difficulty and ruthlessness that traditional roguelikes were known for, and newer players will be able to find more help through user-generated game guides and walkthroughs made possible through wide Internet accessibility. Fabien Fischer offers that players have taken to independently-developed roguelike-likes as they have tired from [...] "superficial gameplay, whitewashing spectacle, the content craze, and Skinner Box design" [...] in titles produced by AAA developers and publishers.|$|E
500|$|The game's central story {{theme is}} the [...] "pursuit of the almighty dollar". Missions {{follow the lead}} characters' efforts to plan and execute {{complicated}} heists to accrue wealth for themselves. The team focused on money as the central theme {{in response to the}} 2007–08 financial crisis, as its effects turn the main characters back to a life of crime. [...] "We wanted this post-crash feeling, because it works thematically in this game about bank robbers", Houser explained. The positive reaction to Grand Theft Auto IVs [...] "Three Leaf Clover" [...] missionin which an elaborate heist is coordinated and executed by lead protagonist Niko Bellic and accomplicesencouraged the team to develop the story around the heists. Houser said that while [...] "Three Leaf Clover" [...] was well-received, the team had not captured the <b>thrill</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> robbery to their best abilities and wanted Grand Theft Auto V to achieve it. He explained, [...] "We wanted to have a couple of really strong bank robberies...It felt like that was a good device that we'd never used in the past. Repeating ourselves is a fear when we're doing games where part of the evolution is just technological".|$|E
500|$|During {{his first}} 20 months in Paris, Hemingway filed 88 stories for the Toronto Star newspaper. He covered the Greco-Turkish War, where he {{witnessed}} {{the burning of}} Smyrna, and wrote travel pieces such as [...] "Tuna Fishing in Spain" [...] and [...] "Trout Fishing All Across Europe: Spain Has the Best, Then Germany". Hemingway was devastated on learning that Hadley had lost a suitcase filled with his manuscripts at the Gare de Lyon as she was traveling to Geneva to meet him in December 1922. The following September, the couple returned to Toronto, where their son John Hadley Nicanor was born on October 10, 1923. During their absence, Hemingway's first book, Three Stories and Ten Poems, was published. Two of the stories it contained were all that remained after {{the loss of the}} suitcase, and the third had been written early the previous year in Italy. Within months a second volume, in our time (without capitals), was published. The small volume included six vignettes and a dozen stories Hemingway had written the previous summer during his first visit to Spain, where he discovered the <b>thrill</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> corrida. He missed Paris, considered Toronto boring, and wanted to return to the life of a writer, rather than live the life of a journalist.|$|E

It has low-resolution backgrounds, and pretty much nothing at all to get excited about". He also called the music [...] "boring and {{completely}} uninspiring". Allgame editor Matt Grandstaff commended the card games, as they [...] "require a fair amount of strategy, and thus remain entertaining" [...] and that [...] "the look and feel of Caesars Palace 2000 recaptures the feel of one of the most successful casinos of all-time". He stated that the game [...] "is definitely not about the looks" [...] but [...] "does an admirable job recreating the casino experience". Grandstaff felt that the game [...] "has the sound of a real casino. From background clatter to the voices of the dealer, this is Caesar's Palace". He noted that players [...] "will enjoy sitting through hours of card games" [...] but to [...] "Avoid the slots". Grandstaff also commented that the strategy book that comes with the game [...] "should be packed on any trip to Vegas".|$|E
500|$|In the {{creation}} of Todd Manning, no one played a larger role than the remarkably talented Josh Griffith, first associate head writer, then co-head writer, during my stay at One Life. Josh loved, lived and breathed Todd and fought passionately for {{his position on the}} show. Second, Todd never would have evolved from [...] "first frat boy" [...] to the major cast member he became without the powerful talent of Roger Howarth. Because of Roger's ability to convey the complexity of Todd (the hurt as well as anger, the insecurity as well as bluster, the brains, yearning, manipulativeness, sexiness, tenderness, nastiness) we were able to explore both the deeply dark side of this character (the effort to destroy Marty to cover the rape, the attempted revenge on his lawyer Nora, the attack on Luna) {{and at the same time}} slowly uncover his growing struggle (usually a failed struggle) towards some kind of redemption. Romantic leads have often begun their careers playing villains (Valentino, Clark Gable, Humphrey Bogart among them). These characters appeal because they make women feel both the <b>thrill</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> [...] "bad" [...] and the lure of the hidden [...] "good": they can lead the man to change through love. [...] "I'll save him!" [...] Fans loved Todd from the beginning because he always had that appeal.|$|E
500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN {{scored the}} episode an 8 out of 10, praising [...] "well-needed" [...] {{development}} of Fitz and Simmons, the skydiving scene (despite {{what he calls}} [...] "the less than stellar FX"), {{and the fact that}} Coulson could not save Diaz, while criticizing the amount of MCU connections, stating that the series is [...] "Still too tied to prior Marvel movie MacGuffins." [...] Oliver Sava of The A.V. Club graded the episode a 'B', saying [...] "Despite my problems with the series, I still look forward to watching S.H.I.E.L.D. every week. It does a good job capturing the <b>thrill</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> big screen on a TV budget ... the dialogue is breezy, and the cast becomes more appealing with each new episode. There’s plenty of room for this show to grow, but I’m not ready to write it off yet." [...] Alan Sepinwall at HitFix called [...] "FZZT" [...] "the first installment of S.H.I.E.L.D. to suggest the creative team was aware of what's not working, even if they couldn't solve every problem in a single installment", feeling that the episode made several positive steps forward in terms of character development. Will Salmon gave the episode 3.5 stars out of 5 for SFX, praising the performances of Henstridge and Gregg, but calling the episode clichéd, and concluding that [...] "by fleshing out the characters, it does feel like Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is now more than just a flashy brand extension." ...|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{wrote it}} is [...] "an uncommonly good movie, {{entertaining}} and actually inspirational".

[...] Hornaday from The Washington Post called the film [...] "a triumph on many levels" [...] and proclaimed, [...] "It's that nod to the collective ... that makes Akeelah and the Bee so special." [...] She especially appreciated that South Los Angeles was presented without stereotypes. Jane Clifford of U-T San Diego felt the film would appeal to both children and adults, and stated that every time she tried to predict its plot [...] "it took a sharp turn.

Children of Earth sees Gwen become pregnant by husband Rhys; a storyline which IGN writer Asham Haque thought provided [...] "one of the few hope-giving threads" [...] in the serial. She gives birth to a baby girl, Anwen, between {{the third and fourth}} series. Both Eve Myles and creator Russell T Davies have described this plot development as emblematic of a contradiction at the heart of Gwen's character. Myles, believing that motherhood gives Gwen a greater sense of responsibility, says it makes Gwen [...] "even more human, and yet even more of a wonder woman". Whilst talking about the show's fourth series, Davies suggested that it would be [...] "irresistible" [...] to use the image of [...] "Gwen Cooper with baby in one arm and gun in the other" [...] as promotion. The production team have continued to emphasise this contradictory aspect to Gwen's character, which has proved popular with critics and viewers. For example, a promotional clip for Miracle Day features Gwen firing from her gun in one hand while protectively holding her baby in the other. Zap2it's Mikey O'Connell praised this as one of the trailer's best aspects, praising Gwen as [...] "the coolest mum ever." [...] Reviewing the opening episodes of Miracle Day Mary McNamara [...] of the Los Angeles Times identified [...] "the dark humor" [...] of the sequence as representative of [...] "the top notes of the British Torchwood".
