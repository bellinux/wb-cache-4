5|$|There are six hamaams (<b>Turkish</b> <b>baths)</b> in the Old City, {{the most}} {{prominent}} of them being al-Shifa and al-Hana. Al-Shifa Hamaam was built by the Tuqans in 1624. Al-Hana in Yasmina, was the last hamaam built in the city in the 19th century. It was closed in 1928 but restored and reopened in 1994. Several leather tanneries, souks, pottery and textile workshops line the Old City streets. There are a number of historic monuments in the old city including the Khan al-Tujjar and the al-Manara Clock Tower built in 1906.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{museum in}} Skopje is the Museum of Macedonia which details {{the history of}} the country. Its icons and {{lapidary}} collections are particularly rich. The Macedonian Archeological Museum, opened in 2014, keeps some of the best archeological finds in Macedonia, dating from Prehistory to the Ottoman period. The National Gallery of Macedonia exhibits paintings dating from the 14th to the 20th century in two former <b>Turkish</b> <b>baths</b> of the Old Bazaar. The Contemporary Art Museum of Macedonia was built after the 1963 earthquake thanks to international assistance. Its collections include Macedonian and foreign art, with works by Fernand Léger, André Masson, Pablo Picasso, Hans Hartung, Victor Vasarely, Alexander Calder, Pierre Soulages, Alberto Burri and Christo.|$|E
5|$|Examples of Ottoman Turkish {{architecture}} {{are located}} in the Old Bazaar. Mosques in Skopje are usually simple in design, with a square base and a single dome and minaret. There entrance is usually emphasised by a portico, as on Mustafa Pasha Mosque, dating from the 15th century. Some mosques show some originality in their appearance: Sultan Murad and Yahya Pasha mosques have lost their dome and have a pyramidal roof, while Isa Bey mosque has a rectangular base, two domes and two side wings. The Aladža Mosque was originally covered with blue faience, but it disappeared in the 1689 Great Fire. However, some tiles are still visible on the adjoining türbe. Other Turkish public monuments include the 16th-century clock tower, a bedesten, three caravanserais, two <b>Turkish</b> <b>baths</b> and the Stone Bridge, first mentioned in 1469.|$|E

50|$|The {{difference}} between the Islamic hammam and the Victorian <b>Turkish</b> <b>bath</b> is the air. The hot air in the Victorian <b>Turkish</b> <b>bath</b> is dry; in the Islamic hammam the air is often steamy. The bather in a Victorian <b>Turkish</b> <b>bath</b> will often take a plunge in a cold pool after the hot rooms; the Islamic hammam usually {{does not have a}} pool unless the water is flowing from a spring. In the Islamic hammams the bathers splash themselves with cold water.|$|R
5|$|The only intact public rooms {{remaining}} {{in either the}} stern or bow sections are the First-Class Reception Room and Dining Saloon, both on D-Deck. Most of the Dining Saloon has collapsed because of its proximity to the break-up point midships, but the very forward part is accessible and the rectangular leaded glass windows, table bases, and ceiling lamps are noticeably preserved. The Reception Room with its leaded glass windows and mahogany paneling remains remarkably intact, although the ceiling is sagging {{and there is a}} deep layer of silt obstructing the floor. The <b>Turkish</b> <b>Baths</b> on F-Deck were found to be in excellent condition during their rediscovery in 2005, preserving the blue-green tiles, carved teak woodwork, bronze lamps, and inlaid furniture. The Grand Staircase was very likely destroyed during the sinking, but the surrounding First-Class foyers and elevator entrances preserve many of the ormolu and crystal lamps, oak timbers, and oak-framed stanchions.|$|E

25|$|The domed {{architectural}} style evolved from Bursa and Edirne. The Ulu Cami (Holy Mosque) in Bursa {{was the first}} Seljuk mosque to be converted into a domed one. Edirne (Adrianople) was the Ottoman capital between 1365 and 1453, when Istanbul (Constantinople) became the new capital, and {{it is here that}} we witness the final stages in the architectural development which culminated {{in the construction of the}} great mosques of Istanbul. The buildings constructed in Istanbul during the period between the Turkish conquest of the city in 1453 and the construction of the Istanbul Bayezid II Mosque are also considered works of the early period. Among these are the Fatih Mosque (1470), Mahmut Paşa Mosque, the tiled palace and Topkapı Palace. The Ottomans integrated mosques into the community and added soup kitchens, theological schools, hospitals, <b>Turkish</b> <b>baths</b> and tombs.|$|E
25|$|The Big Four had a tonnage of 21,035 - 24,541, {{with the}} Baltic and the Adriatic {{much larger than}} the first two. However, the Adriatic, which was the largest of the four, was also the only one not to have held the title of largest {{passenger}} ship in world. The four ships were propelled by two propellers driven by steam quadruple expansion and reached an average speed of , although their maximum speeds varied. The silhouettes of the four vessels were similar, black hull with red keel and white superstructure. They were provided with four masts (two front and two rear) which supported the cables of wireless telegraphy. The two funnels were buff topped with a black sleeve. The vessels had luxury on an unprecedented scale, with a dining room dominated by a glass roof, a lounge with a reading and writing room with many books and periodicals, also adorned with large picture windows, a covered promenade deck, a smoking room decorated stained glass {{and in the case of}} the Adriatic, an indoor pool and <b>Turkish</b> <b>baths.</b>|$|E
25|$|Despite having {{architectural}} heritage dating {{back up to}} Hellenistic times, most historical architecture in Antalya date to the medieval Ottoman period, {{with a number of}} mosques, madrasahs, masjids, caravanserais, <b>Turkish</b> <b>baths</b> and tombs giving the city a Turkish-Islamic character. Historical architecture is concentrated in the walled city, Kaleiçi; ancient structures are not well-preserved {{in the rest of the}} city of Antalya as the modern city was built on the ancient city. Kaleiçi, with its narrow cobbled streets of historic Ottoman era houses, is the old center of Antalya. With its hotels, bars, clubs, restaurants, and shopping, it has been restored to retain much of its historical character. It is surrounded by two walls in the shape of a horsenail, one of which is along the seafront, built in a continuous process from Hellenistic to Ottoman times. The historical harbour is located in this part of the city; narrow streets extend from the harbour and branch off into the old city, surrounded by wooden historical houses. Cumhuriyet Square, the main square of the city and a spot very popular for tourists and locals, is surrounded by shopping and business centres and public buildings. There are sites with traces of Hellenistic, Roman, Byzantine, and Seljuk architecture and cultures. There are also examples of the local Greek architecture in the city, with five Greek Orthodox churches in the old city.|$|E
