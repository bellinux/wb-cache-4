500|$|Architect {{and critic}} Maxwell Hutchinson has {{attracted}} controversy in {{his criticism of}} recent architectural developments in Leeds, most notably Clarence Dock. In referring to Leeds' plans for the future, Hutchinson said [...] "there are worrying signs that Yorkshire is about {{to make the same}} mistakes <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> in London over 20 years ago". Hutchinson also criticised the dearth of services in the city centre, referring to its lack of schools and health-care facilities. Hutchinson also described the Clarence Dock development as [...] "the slums of the future". These claims were explored on the BBC television programme, Inside Out.|$|E
500|$|Lawson met {{journalist}} John Diamond in 1986, {{when they}} were both writing for The Sunday Times. They married in Venice in 1992, and have a daughter, Cosima, and a son, Bruno. Diamond was diagnosed with throat cancer in 1997 and died in March 2001, aged 47. One of his last messages to Lawson was, [...] "How proud I am of you and what you have become. The great thing about us is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> us who we are." [...] His death occurred during the filming of Nigella Bites; [...] "I took a fortnight off. But I'm not a great believer in breaks", Lawson explained; she suffered a bout of depression following the funeral. After Diamond's death, Lawson kept all of the press clippings in what she called her [...] "Morbidobox".|$|E
500|$|In January 1961, Castro ordered Havana's U.S. Embassy {{to reduce}} its 300-member staff, suspecting {{that many of them}} were spies. The U.S. responded by ending {{diplomatic}} relations, and it increased CIA funding for exiled dissidents; these militants began attacking ships that traded with Cuba, and bombed factories, shops, and sugar mills. Both Eisenhower and his successor John F. Kennedy supported a CIA plan to aid a dissident militia, the Democratic Revolutionary Front, to invade Cuba and overthrow Castro; the plan resulted in the Bay of Pigs Invasion in April 1961. On April 15, CIA-supplied B-26's bombed 3 Cuban military airfields; the U.S. announced that the perpetrators were defecting Cuban air force pilots, but Castro exposed these claims as false flag misinformation. Fearing invasion, he ordered the arrest of between 20,000 and 100,000 suspected counter-revolutionaries, publicly proclaiming, [...] "What the imperialists cannot forgive us, is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> a Socialist revolution under their noses", his first announcement that the government was socialist.|$|E
6000|$|... "Did Mr. Longueville deny it was we?" [...] asked Mrs. Vivian, archly; [...] "after <b>we</b> <b>had</b> {{supposed}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> {{an impression}} on him!" ...|$|R
60|$|I told him, {{and added}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> the grave as {{beautiful}} as we could with grass and flowers. I saw his lips whiten and tremble.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{was hardly}} necessary," [...] she said, with some dignity, [...] "to bring us into your private office {{to tell us}} all this, since <b>we</b> already knew <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> a mistake in coming." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It may be--and indeed I {{will say}} more--it {{is the case}} <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> this {{engagement}} without knowing enough of each other's character." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'A wounded English {{soldier was}} {{speaking}} of Cronje. [...] "Ah, sister," [...] said he, [...] "I am glad <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> so many prisoners." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shouldn't be surprised; {{but it will}} be {{too late}} to do us any harm, unless he comes {{directly}} back with the news <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> a change of base." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should not}} count on that, Dias. They might come {{straight}} here, as they would guess <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> for this pass, and they might make bundles of reeds to carry their guns and ammunition across, and swim over." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{no doubt}} about it," [...] Bellamy declared. [...] "I have been to the Mortuary. It is {{certainly}} he. All our work has been in vain--just as I thought, too, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> a splendid success of it." ...|$|R
60|$|So, {{having no}} choice, I promised, though {{with a heavy}} heart. Then, I suppose {{in order to make}} this solemn {{contract}} public, Marais called the surviving Boers, who were loitering near, and repeated to them the terms of the contract <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>made.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "It seems <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> a beginning," [...] he said hoarsely. [...] "It's first {{blood to}} them, {{but this will}} {{take a lot of}} forgetting, and the rest may be different." ...|$|E
60|$|Supposing that we {{have painted}} a storm scene, in desolate country, with a single miserable cottage somewhere in front; <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> the {{atmosphere}} and the distance cold and blue, and wish to heighten the comfortless impression.|$|E
6000|$|... "But now <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> it up, {{she will}} be horrified again at all your wickednesses. You have been a turtle dove lately;--now you will be an ogre again. But, Oswald, you must not be an ogre to me." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} but think, even as I did so, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> {{extraordinary}} free upon short acquaintance, {{and that a}} really wise young lady would have shown herself more backward. I {{think it was the}} bank-porter that put me from this ungallant train of thought.|$|R
6000|$|... "As the man remembered <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> {{ourselves}} pleasant on board, {{he agreed}} {{at once to}} take me, next time the boat should be going. I laid out a pound in getting a coat more suitable for travelling in France than the peasant's smock. Then I took a lodging in a small inn.|$|R
60|$|Indaba-zimbi lifted Tota {{into the}} kind of sling <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> out of the blanket in which to carry her on our backs, and we {{staggered}} on for an hour through the sand. She awoke crying for water, and alas! <b>we</b> <b>had</b> none to give her; our tongues were hanging from our lips, we could scarcely speak.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{would be}} best to take out the contents, article by article," [...] {{answered}} the other, [...] "and examine each and all. Now <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> a beginning with the inventory, it is best to go through with it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Comrades! It is, I think, {{the last}} time you will hear the term from me," [...] he said--"I am glad <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> and won a good fight at Silverdale, because it may soften your most {{warranted}} resentment when you think of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am almost sorry <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> {{a holiday}} of the Sunday," [...] said Daggett, seating {{himself on a}} point of rock, {{to get a little}} rest after so {{fatiguing}} an ascent. [...] "Every minute of time is precious to men in our situation." ...|$|E
60|$|Jack {{remained}} with her, but the guide {{went on with}} us, {{in order to give}} instructions to our men, who, when we arrived, seemed much surprised <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> such a bad hunt during the night. Having pointed out our route, Makarooroo then left us, and we lay down to obtain a few hours' repose.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly we are; but to <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> up our mind! We are not {{injuring}} all the world. No {{doubt it}} is a lie,--but there are {{circumstances in which}} a lie can hardly be a sin. I {{would have been the}} last to say so before all this had come upon me, but I feel it to be so now. It is a lie to say that you are my wife." ...|$|R
2500|$|Gerard Way {{also said}} in a November 2009 {{interview}} with Rock Sound that the fourth album would be their defining work. [...] "A friend who heard the record recently said he now {{had no interest in}} listening to our older work anymore, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> all our old material redundant. I took it as a compliment, the next thing you should always make the last thing seem unimportant and I think that will happen when we finally release this album." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have found}} the {{handkerchief}} with which you wiped the blood from your hands yesterday morning, and then carelessly dropped," [...] replied the prince. [...] "This proves <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> a complete circle around this hedge without {{finding a way to}} pass through it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Comrades! It is, I think, {{the last}} time you will hear the term from me," [...] he said. [...] "I am glad <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> and won a good fight at Silverdale, because it may soften your most {{warranted}} resentment when you think of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am sorry}} to say <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> very little progress," [...] said the Inspector. [...] "We have an open {{carriage}} outside, and as you would no doubt {{like to see the}} place before the light fails, we might talk it over as we drive." ...|$|E
60|$|By way of {{geographical}} exercitation, <b>we</b> <b>had</b> all drawn our several plans, showing, after Arab statement, {{the lay of}} Shaghab and Shuwák, the two ruins which {{we were about to}} visit. Nothing could be more ridiculous when the sketch-maps came to be compared. This was owing to the route following the three sides of a long parallelogram; whilst the fourth is based upon the Wady Dámah, causing considerable complication. And, the excursus ended, all were convinced <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> much southing, when our furthest point was not more than five miles south of Zibá (north lat. 27° 20').|$|R
60|$|More {{than once}} Seppi and I had tried in a humble and diffident way to convert him, {{and as he}} <b>had</b> {{remained}} silent <b>we</b> <b>had</b> taken his silence {{as a sort of}} encouragement; necessarily, then, this talk of his was a disappointment to us, for it showed <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> no deep impression upon him. The thought made us sad, and we knew then how the missionary must feel when he has been cherishing a glad hope and has seen it blighted. We kept our grief to ourselves, knowing that this was not the time to continue our work.|$|R
40|$|In 2011, the Technical Centre for Agricultural and Rural Cooperation (CTA) {{developed}} a new Strategic Plan, 2011 - 2015, which refocused our work in African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries on several priority topics, {{one of which was}} value chain development. As a first step in this process, we carried out what we called a “Mapping Study”, to fully assess the value chain support needs of our ACP partners. This study not only confirmed to us <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> the right choice to emphasise value chain issues but also highlighted several areas of work that required immediate attention...|$|R
6000|$|... “Now we {{must all}} crawl towards {{the edge of the}} forest,” Will said, “and then, instead of going {{straight}} down the hill we will turn off for a short distance. They are sure to miss us immediately, and will believe <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> direct for the sea.” ...|$|E
6000|$|I had {{owed the}} Professor {{one for a}} long time. [...] "After all," [...] I replied, [...] "it strikes me <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> the mistake of {{thinking}} too much of India. We thought we were civilised, for instance. Let us take a lower place. This beats Calcutta into a hamlet." ...|$|E
6000|$|There was {{a general}} chorus of [...] "No fear of that, Chris. We all know you well enough to be sure <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>made</b> a good choice. We knew it before we left Johannesburg, but your pluck in walking up to that Boer with his loaded rifle clenched the matter." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{day after}} the Battle of San Jacinto, Captain Moseley Baker ordered Bostick and two other {{soldiers}} (Washington H. Secrest and James A. Sylvester) to scout around the prairie in search of escaping Mexican soldiers. They spotted and captured a Mexican soldier hiding in tall grass. Upon returning to camp, they discovered that their prisoner was the Mexican President and General Antonio López de Santa Anna. Bostick noted in his memoirs that: When we got to camp, the Mexican soldiers, then prisoners, saluted him and said, “el presidente.” <b>We</b> knew then <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> a big haul.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish <b>we</b> <b>had</b> got out earlier, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> might <b>have</b> <b>made</b> {{a run of}} it by day-light," [...] {{answered}} Roswell. [...] "Ten {{hours of}} such a wind, in my judgment, would carry us well towards clear water." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] The {{word was}} partly a sigh and partly a little cry of long-concealed, long-denied pain. [...] "It's been all a funny misunderstanding. Tom and I were engaged once--a boy-and-girl affair in the beginning. Then we both found out <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>made</b> a mistake--that what <b>we</b> <b>had</b> thought was love was merely the affection of good comrades. We broke our {{engagement}} shortly before you went away. All the older girls {{knew it was}} broken but I suppose nobody mentioned the matter to Jen. She was such a child, we never thought about her. And you've thought I was Tom's wife all this time? It's--funny." ...|$|R
