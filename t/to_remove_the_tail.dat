Using 12 adult rhesus monkeys, latencies <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> from a 50 °C water bath, respiration in 5 % CO 2 and heart rate were measured. When administered alone, SR 141716 A (1. 8, 5. 6 mg/kg i. m.) did not alter nociception, respiration or heart rate. D- 9 -THC (0. 1 – 10 mg/kg i. m.) and WIN 55212 (0. 1 – 10 mg/kg i. m.) dose-dependently increased antinociception and dose-dependently decreased respiratory minute and tidal volumes and heart rate. These antinociceptive, respiratory and heart rate effects were reversed by SR 141716 A but not by the opioid antagonist quadazocine (1 mg/kg i. m.). Anandamide (10 mg/kg i. m.) also produced antinociception.

RESULTS: In the last decade, the use of robotic systems has become increasingly common as an approach for benign and malignant pancreatic disease treatment. Robotic Distal Pancreatectomy (RDP) is an emerging technology for which sufficient data to draw definitive conclusions in surgical oncology are still not available because the follow-up period after surgery is too short (less than 2 years).

40|$|This paper revisits the Levy {{sections}} theorem. We {{extend the}} scope of the theorem to time series and apply it to historical daily returns of selected dollar exchange rates.

In the end our extension of the theorem provides an approach that is simpler than the more common explicit modeling of fat tails and dependence. Our main purpose is to build up a technique based on the sections that allows one <b>to</b> artificially <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> fat <b>tails</b> and dependence present in a data set. By analyzing data through the lenses of the Levy sections theorem one can find common patterns in otherwise very different data sets. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The interconversions of C 1 -substituted folates {{form the}} core of plant one carbon metabolism. An {{analytical}} method for extraction, purification and liquid chromatography−electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry detection of low level, labile tetrahydrofolate monoglutamates from Arabidopsis thaliana was developed in this study. Under gold fluorescent light, folates were extracted by homogenizing the leaves in extraction buffer and heating the homogenate. A portion of leaf homogenate was incubated with crude preparation of rat plasma conjugase <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> polyglutamate <b>tails</b> {{in order to simplify}} the mixture for analysis. The resulting extract containing the monoglutamyl folates was then applied to an agarose affinity column containing folate binding protein which was purified from milk whey. After elution from the affinity column, the folates were separated and identified by liquid chromatography−electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry on a 150 × 0. 32 mm Symmetry 300 C 18 column using isocratic elution with mobile phase (0. 1 % formic acid/ 95 % acetonitrile, containing 0. 1 % formic acid, 88 : 12) at a flow rate of 0. 3 µl/min. In positive ion mode, ions representing 5 -methyl-tetrahydrofolic acid, 5 -formyl-tetrahydrofolic acid and 5, 10 -methenyl-tetrahydrofolic acid were detected and identified. It is concluded that this folate extraction procedure, combined with folate binding protein affinity column purification is applicable to liquid chromatography−electrospray-ionization mass spectrometry and this method is appropriate for analysis of tetrahydrofolate metabolites in plant leaf tissues.

40|$|A new {{technique}} {{has been developed}} to determine the average structure of the Venus magnetotail (in the range from − 8 Rv to − 12 Rv) from the Pioneer Venus magnetometer observations. The spacecraft position {{with respect to the}} cross-tail current sheet is determined from an observed relationship between the field-draping angle and the magnitude of the field referenced to its value in the nearby magnetosheath. This allows us statistically <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> effects of <b>tail</b> flapping and variability of draping {{for the first time and}} thus to map the average field configuration in <b>the</b> Venus <b>tail.</b> From this average configuration we calculate the cross-tail current density distribution and J × B forces.

40|$|G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) allow {{cells to}} respond to {{extracellular}} stimuli and are involved in virtually all major physiological processes in eukaryotes. Consequently, aberrant GPCR signalling can lead to disease, making them attractive candidates for research {{and the development of}} pharmacological interventions. However, GPCR signalling responses in higher eukaryotes are complex, with the presence of multiple signalling pathways hindering the isolation and study of specific signalling components. The model organism, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, provides a simplified system with which to investigate GPCR signalling in the pheromoneresponse pathway. Pheromone stimulation in Sz. pombe causes the production of proteins necessary for the mating process, including the carboxypeptidase Sxa 2. This study utilises Sz. pombe reporter strains in which sxa 2 has been replaced with the bacterial reporter lacZ, thus enabling quantification of the level of signalling through the pheromoneresponse pathway. Using this system, the pheromone-responsive Mam 2 receptor was investigated, with specific focus on the large intracellular C-terminal tail. Truncating Mam 2 <b>to</b> <b>remove</b> <b>the</b> C-terminal <b>tail</b> altered signalling by increasing the level of ligand-independent signalling and decreasing the level of maximal signalling. Similar effects were observed when a regulator of G protein signalling, Rgs 1, was removed from strains containing the full-length Mam 2 receptor. This suggested a relationship between these two signalling components, which was confirmed through yeast 2 -hybrid analysis. Using this approach, an 8 -residue section of the Mam 2 C-terminal tail was found to be necessary for a direct interaction with Rgs 1. Further characterisation of <b>the</b> Mam 2 <b>tail</b> revealed an additional role for this region in receptor sensitivity to pheromone stimulation. Mutational analysis implicated three serine residues in receptor sensitivity, suggesting that <b>the</b> C-terminal <b>tail</b> of Mam 2 may contribute to receptor internalisation from the plasma membrane therefore enabling desensitisation to prolonged pheromone stimulation. Similar techniques applied to the study of Rgs 1 revealed that two conserved DEP domains in the N-terminus of Rgs 1 are important for the interaction with the Mam 2 C-terminal tail. Fluorescent tagging of Rgs 1 and subsequent microscopic analysis indicated that Rgs 1 localises to endomembranous structures surrounding the nucleus, contrary to predictions made by mathematical models developed by this group, which suggest that Rgs 1 requires plasma membrane-localisation in order to function. A better understanding of the action of Mam 2 and Rgs 1 in the Sz. pombe pheromone response can inform mathematical models and future studies involving the more complex mammalian signalling cascades.
