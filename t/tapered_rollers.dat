25|$|A heated {{cylindrical}} billet workpiece is fed {{between two}} convex-tapered rollers, which are rotating {{in the same}} direction. The rollers are usually 6° askew from parallel with the billet's axis. The rollers are {{on opposite sides of}} the billet, and the surface of their largest cross sections are separated by a distance slightly smaller than the outside diameter (OD) of the original billet. The load imparted by the rollers compresses the material and the 6° skew provides both rotation and translation to the billet. The friction between the rollers and the billet is intentionally high, and is sometimes increased by using knurled rollers. This friction establishes stresses varying radially through the billet, with the highest stresses at the OD and the central axis. The stress exceeds the yield strength of the billet and causes circumferential fissures to propagate at various radii near the OD, and a central longitudinal void to form at the axis. A tapered mandrel is set inside and a short distance from the start of the central void. This mandrel forces the material outward and compresses the material against the back side of the <b>tapered</b> <b>rollers.</b> This compressive loading fuses the circumferential fissures and sets the initial internal diameter and OD values. The formed tube is then cooled and can be cold worked to refine the diameters and to achieve the desired yield strengths.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tapered</b> <b>roller</b> {{bearings}} use conical rollers {{that run}} on conical races. Most roller bearings only take radial or axial loads, but <b>tapered</b> <b>roller</b> bearings support both radial and axial loads, and generally can carry higher loads than ball bearings due to greater contact area. <b>Tapered</b> <b>roller</b> bearings are used, for example, as the wheel bearings of most wheeled land vehicles. The downsides to this bearing is that due to manufacturing complexities, <b>tapered</b> <b>roller</b> bearings are usually more expensive than ball bearings; and additionally under heavy loads the <b>tapered</b> <b>roller</b> is like a wedge and bearing loads tend to try to eject the roller; the force from the collar which keeps the roller in the bearing adds to bearing friction compared to ball bearings.|$|R

50|$|Tapered roller thrust {{bearings}} consist of small <b>tapered</b> <b>rollers</b> arranged {{so that their}} axes all converge at a point on the axis of the bearing. The length of the roller and {{the diameter of the}} wide and the narrow ends and the angle of rollers need to be carefully calculated to provide the correct taper so that each end of the roller rolls smoothly on the bearing face without skidding. These are the type most commonly used in automotive applications (to support the wheels of a motor car for example), where they are used in pairs to accommodate axial thrust in either direction, as well as radial loads. They can support greater thrust loads than the ball type due to the larger contact area, but are more expensive to manufacture.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{cylindrical}} roller planetary traction drive was developed. It comprises a sun roller, three planetary rollers, an outer ring, a stationary carrier and an input shaft. The sun roller is hollow, and is connected through three logarithmic spiral profiles to the input shaft. As the input shaft rotates {{relative to the}} sun roller, a wedging action takes place between the input shaft and the sun roller; this makes the sun roller generate {{a certain amount of}} elastic deformation, so an appreciable amount of contact load is generated between the sun roller and the planetary roller. The greater the input torque is, the stronger the strength of the wedging action and the greater the contact load, and vice versa; so this configuration is self-actuating. Here, as {{cylindrical roller}}s are used in the planetary traction-drive configuration, the spin motion as would present in the case that the <b>tapered</b> <b>rollers</b> were used will not occur. Meanwhile, as a logarithmic spiral is used in the profile connection, the distribution of contact stress between the two connected surfaces will be uniform. This reduces the concentration of contact stress of the connected surfaces, and prolongs the life of the contact fatigue of the contacting surfaces...|$|E

40|$|With annual global {{sales of}} {{approximately}} $ 5 billion [1], {{tapered roller bearing}} consumers increasingly valued energy efficient products [2]. Two of the world’s largest bearing producers, SKF [3] and Timken [4] promoted energy efficient bearings based on their abilities to grind rollers to reduced radial deviation from round (OOR). Bearing designers, however, {{did not know if}} roller geometries specified placed limitations on roller roundness. Testing under shop floor conditions at Timken, the researcher discovered a positive linear regression between roller nominal diameter and OOR. The basis for the regression was under geometric roller rounding conditions found to exist when through feed centreless grinding <b>tapered</b> <b>rollers,</b> synchronous regulating wheel vibrations transferred at higher amplitude to larger nominal diameter rollers. This research pointed energy efficient bearing design in a new direction. For example, tapered roller bearing designers typically specified rollers of minimum length to reduce problems associated with rolling contact. Bearings assembled from shorter rollers, to retain the same load capacity, required fewer rollers of larger nominal diameter. This research, however, found all things equal larger nominal diameter rollers suffered from increased OOR. Bearings designed to reduce power losses associated with rotational displacements benefited from employing more, smaller nominal diameter rollers...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} rolling contact on the {{microstructure}} of case carburized bearing steel {{have been studied}} experimentally, and the results examined, along with {{a review of the}} current literature and theories which are used to explain the observed phenomena. ^ All experimental work utilized <b>tapered</b> <b>rollers</b> from 6. 5 x 12 tapered roller bearings as used in the rail industry. Retained austenite, residual stress, texture and particle size at the roller surface were measured using X-ray diffraction technique. These parameters along with hardness and microstructure were also studied as a function of load-miles on new rollers, and profiles in addition these same parameters were measured as a function of depth in the case carburized layer of several samples. These characteristics were also studied {{as a function of the}} finish grinding operation, and rollers returned from long service were annealed in order to study the extent to which the changes were related to reversible processes. With all studies, whenever possible, measurements were carried out sequentially and at the same location on the rollers. ^ Results of this research has shown that the retained austenite decreases at the surface with service mileage and load, and the residual stresses in the martensite and austenite phases become more compressive. Texture and particle size measurements along with the annealing behavior of the rollers indicated that the most significant contribution to the residual stress is from the transformation of austenite to martensite, although there is evidence that work hardening of austenite is occurring. There appears to be an early limit for most of the transformation of austenite to martensite which appears to be due to the fact that the austenite has become strengthened which then makes further transformation difficult. The behavior of the retained austenite is further classified according to three stages known as shake down, steady state and unstable. ...|$|E
40|$|Problem Statement: Fatigue {{life testing}} of large {{tapered roller bearing}} {{components}} for rail applications is often very costly and time consuming. The purpose of this project is to assist Amsted Rail Company, Inc. develop a large railroad tapered roller bearing test rig that does not require scaled down prototypes bearings. As these are <b>tapered</b> <b>rollers,</b> loads can be applied from either the lateral or radial direction. L 10 bearing life test predictions for the test rig bearings should be carried out using the American Bearing Manufacturers Association standards. The test rig can be designed to test as many as 4 bearings at a time or as little as one bearing raceway (1 / 2 bearing) at a time. The overall goal of the project is to design a test rig that will provide accelerated life test results, create solid models of the test rig design for illustration purposes, and provide supporting design calculations. Rationale: With completion of this project it will allow Amstead Rail Company Inc. to test their bearing products in a quicker and more efficient manner. They {{will be able to}} obtain test data in a much quicker manner, drastically decreasing the amount of time needed to make manufacturing adjustments to current production. Secondly, it will allow Amstead Rail to excel in product development by enabling them to test prototype bearing at a never achieved pace. Approach: Our team has used the method of static analysis to solve for the loads corresponding to a rail car bearing under full and partial loads. We then designed a prototype test rig and that we saw as a best fit to our customers need. We then animated the product in 3 D using the Inventor CAD program and analyzed the rig/bearing in ANSYS computer software to ensure that it could provide/withstand the designed loads. Interim Results and Conclusions: As of 12 / 1 / 2014 our team has determined the static loads that may be seen in the rig and bearing during testing operation. We have factored in many engineering criteria and worked with our contact personnel at Amstead Rail to ensure that our prototype design will meet their desired needs. Currently, our team starting to move forward with the Inventor 3 D modeling and ANSYS load analysis of the test rig. Anticipated Results and Conclusions: The expected results of this design project are to provide a bearing test rig concept that has been proven through static analysis; with corresponding 3 D CAD drawings that will allow for a functioning prototype to be built along with a bill of materials needed to create the rig.
