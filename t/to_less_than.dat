40|$|Computed {{results on}} the {{characteristics}} impedance of wide slots etched on an electrically thin substrate of low dielectric constant epsilon sub r are presented. These results are used to help provide design data for slotlines. Curves are presented for epsilon sub r = 2. 22, 3. 0, 3. 8, and 9. 8. Comparison is shown for the characteristic impedance between the present calculations and those available in the literature for high-epsilon sub r substrates. Empirical formulas, based on least square curve fitting, are presented for the normalized slot wavelength lambda prime/lambda sub 0 and the characteristic impedance Z sub 0 over the range: 0. 0015 is equal <b>to</b> or <b>less</b> <b>than</b> W/lambda sub 0 equal <b>to</b> or <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 1. 0, 0. 006 is equal <b>to</b> or <b>less</b> <b>than</b> d/lambda sub 0 equal <b>to</b> or <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 0. 06, 2. 22 is equal <b>to</b> or <b>less</b> <b>than</b> epsilon sub 0 equal <b>to</b> or <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 9. 8...|$|R

Yukawa interactions of phi, in particular, lead to corrections of the form -k phi(4) ln(phi/mu), where K > 0 and mu is a renormalization scale. For instance, phi(4) chaotic inflation with radiative corrections looks compatible with the most recent WMAP (5 year) analysis, {{in sharp contrast to}} the tree level case.
