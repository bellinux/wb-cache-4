5|$|Recent {{volcanism}} in the Cascades, lasting from 7 to 2 mya, produced largely basaltic and basaltic andesite-based material (up to 50percent). On {{the eastern}} side of the High Cascades, however, volcanoes erupted dacite, andesite, and rhyolite. These materials made up several types of eruptions: lava flows, domes, and pyroclastic flows. In the most recent volcanic activity, andesite, basalt, and rhyolite have been erupted from High Cascades volcanoes, particularly the Three Sisters, Broken <b>Top,</b> <b>Mount</b> Hood, Mount Jefferson, and Crater Lake.|$|E
25|$|Front {{suspension}} uses {{a separate}} spring and damper {{with a rubber}} <b>top</b> <b>mount.</b> The rear suspension of the W124 features the Mercedes multi-link axle introduced in 1982 with the Mercedes 190 and which is now standard on many modern cars. Estate cars (and optionally, saloons and coupés) had Citroen-like rear self-leveling suspension with suspension struts rather than shock absorbers, gas-filled suspension spheres to provide damping and an under bonnet pressurizing pump. Unlike the traditional Citroën application Mercedes opted for a fixed ride height and employed rear coil springs to maintain the static ride height when parked.|$|E
500|$|Rock in {{the area}} ages from the Upper Pliocene and Quaternary. Basalt and basaltic {{andesite}} comprise newer volcanoes atop the High Cascades: major volcanic centers include Mount Hood, Three Sisters-Broken <b>Top,</b> <b>Mount</b> Mazama (Crater Lake), and Mount Jefferson. All have produced diverse eruptions, including both lava flows and pyroclastic eruptions, and variability in composition between dacite, basalt, and even rhyolite (except for Mount Hood, which is not known to have produced rhyolite). Thielsen {{is part of a}} series of extinct volcanoes in Oregon termed the Matterhorns for their steep, spire-like summits; Thielsen is the highest at [...] Other Matterhorns include Mount Washington, Three Fingered Jack, Mount Bailey, and Diamond Peak. Unlike other mountains in the High Cascades, all these volcanoes became extinct 250,000to 100,000 years ago, and their summits endured the last few ice ages, accounting for their distinct shapes.|$|E

2500|$|Several Japanese models {{included}} an All Wheel Drive version (ATTESA). The engines {{used in the}} Japanese models ranged greatly in capacity and type. The SSS Attesa LTD model used a [...] "redtop" [...] SR20DET (154kW/206hp). This was a similar engine/drivetrain package to the Pulsar GTi-R (169kW). It had only a single throttle body as opposed the GTi-R multiple throttle body, smaller bearings, hydraulic rather than solid lifters, and a smaller turbo. The GTi-R had a large <b>top</b> <b>mount</b> intercooler, while the SSS ATTESA LTD had a smaller front mount intercooler. The Bluebird SSS was set apart from the North American Altima in that not only having the SR20DET and AWD Attesa as an option, it also had power folding retracting mirrors (some heated) and a rear wiper if equipped with a spoiler.|$|E
