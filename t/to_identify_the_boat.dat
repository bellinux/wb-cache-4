5000|$|The Mark is a {{single-hander}} {{class of}} small sailing dinghy. The design in plywood {{came from the}} pen of Billy Morton from Morton's Yacht Supplies, Priory Road, Hollywood, Belfast Northern Ireland. It {{first appeared in the}} 1964, in competition with the OK dinghy but before the Laser. At least 100 boats were built by Morton. Her performance is slower than an OK upwind due to her lighter weight (130lbs.) and shorter length. The Mark is 12 ft in length, with forward and side buoyancy compartments. A 19 ft free standing rotating mast stepped far forward in the front buoyancy compartment supports a mainsail which features a MK symbol <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat.</b> In 1966 the fibreglass Mark was introduced with no.100 called 'Fymark.' ...|$|E
5000|$|The T-10 is a sloop {{design with}} 7/8th {{fractional}} rig, symmetrical spinnaker, lead keel, aluminum mast and boom, and balsawood-cored fibreglass hull. It can sleep six (2 in V-berth, 2 in midship berths, and 2 in aft quarter berths), {{has a small}} sink, and a portable toilet. The Tartan Ten has a flush deck to facilitate deck movement during a race, and this is normally an easy way <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat.</b> The T-10 was designed primarily for racing in a local area (aka [...] "Daysailing"), but that doesn't stop sailors from racing the boat on long races as well. In 2006 twenty-five T-10s participated in the Chicago Yacht Club Race to Mackinac, a popular 333-mile race {{along the length of}} Lake Michigan from Chicago, IL to Mackinac Island, MI. Heavily modified T10s have also competed in the Victoria to Maui and the Bermuda 1-2. Such races are beyond the design parameters of the craft.|$|E
5000|$|This article {{attempts}} to pull together, for comparative purposes, some statistics concerning the coastal forces of different navies.

5000|$|Just {{seven minutes}} later, however, danger {{approached}} from {{an entirely different}} quarter. Her lookouts and SL radar operator picked up a small boat, 2,200 yards away on the port bow, and Bunch rang up full speed and altered course <b>to</b> investigate. After <b>identifying</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> as enemy, she opened fire with [...]50-caliber, 20- and 40-millimeter batteries and destroyed it 500 yards away. At 0631, Bunch detected a second suicide motorboat - later judged {{to have come from}} Mae Shima, which was still in enemy hands - bearing down upon the ship. Machine gun fire from the fast transport stopped the craft dead in the water, however, and its crew jettisoned the explosive charge which immediately blew up. Bunch altered course to capture <b>the</b> suicide <b>boat's</b> crew, but a nearby destroyer [...] "eradicated" [...] both boat and swimmers with a well-placed 5-inch shell. After reporting the incident, Bunch resumed patrolling until detached at 0730 to await word to execute her pre-landing mission.|$|R
40|$|Steamboats became {{commercially viable}} {{in the early}} nineteenth century, and by the 1830 s were arguably the most popular form of long-distance travel around North America, {{especially}} on inland waterways like Lake Champlain. Due to this popularity, demand for faster, larger boats drove shipwrights to experiment with new designs that differed greatly from traditional ship construction. Unfortunately, steamboat plans from this period are mostly missing or incomplete, and therefore our knowledge of their changing shapes and features must be derived from archaeological data. A survey of Lake Champlain?s Shelburne Shipyard revealed the remains of four nineteenth-century steamboats. The four hulls, labeled Wrecks 1 through 4, were recorded for comparative study during a field school {{that took place in the}} month of June, 2014. Researchers from Texas A&M University and the Lake Champlain Maritime Museum spent three weeks recording the remains in order <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> individual <b>boats,</b> develop preliminary site plans for each wreck, and compare the differing construction patterns. Though Wreck 1 (A. Williams) proved to be from 1870, the other three were nearly contemporaneous, all built in the 1830 s. Despite their close launch dates, Wrecks 2, 3 and 4 (Winooski [1832], Burlington [1837] and Whitehall [1838]) displayed very different construction methods. This study examines the archaeological findings of the Shelburne Shipyard steamboats along with historical background information in order to illustrate how shipwrights were straying from traditional, heavy-timbered ship designs to make lighter and longer hulls in an effort to make faster vessels...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of <b>the</b> {{project is}} <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> ship or <b>boat</b> on <b>the</b> zone level. While {{travelling}} in <b>boat</b> or ship <b>the</b> iceberg {{in the sea}} is detected by using ultrasonic sensor and the prediction of tsunami is carried out using vibration sensor. If <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> or ship crosses the limitation of border it gives a voice message, {{if they try to}} move forward then the ship/boat will automatically stop functioning. There is one emergency switch available on <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> side that will inform about the route to home. In the problematic time, the information is passed to the control room then the ship/boat is rescued in case of danger. A GPS receiver shows the position of the ship/boat by receiving the signal from the satellite. The microcontroller is used to calculate the accurate position of the boat/ship which will indicate the fisherman through an alarm system that the ship/boat has crossed the boundary. Through this process the system helps in saving the lives of the fisherman and reduces the risks and damages caused to them when they are lost in the sea...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>boats</b> were {{to escape}} on Christmas Eve. On {{the eve of}} the escape, the {{skeleton}} crews continued to maintain <b>the</b> <b>boats,</b> while <b>the</b> 80 crews who came to reinforce them hid belowdecks. The Israelis feared that <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> could sink while sailing through the Bay of Biscay in severe winter conditions. The group had a meteorologist assigned to them, who monitored all British, French and Spanish weather forecasts. Despite a forecast predicting rain from the south-west, the crews were ordered to sail out at 20:30. By 19:30, all crews were aboard. There was a force 9 storm {{on the night of the}} escape, and after the weather worsened, the departure time was extended to 22:30, but the escape was again delayed by worsening weather. Captain Hadar Kimhi received urgent coded messages from Israel ordering him to set sail despite the weather, but he decided to wait. At midnight, the meteorologist picked up a BBC report indicating that the storm would die down in two hours. At 2:30 am, <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> left Cherbourg and headed slowly out to sea. The French were initially unaware that <b>the</b> Israeli <b>boats</b> had left port, and their absence was noticed by a reporter who visited the port and saw that all <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> were missing. He immediately reported it to the BBC almost 12 hours after the escape, and so the French authorities learned of the boats' disappearance from the BBC. The empty berths and an absence of any announcement of the embargo's termination caused speculation that Israel had taken <b>the</b> <b>boats.</b> A television news team flew out over the North Sea to see if <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> were heading towards Norway, to where they had ostensibly been sold, while other news crews headed out over <b>the</b> Mediterranean. <b>The</b> <b>boats</b> crossed <b>the</b> Bay of Biscay before turning south and crossing into the Mediterranean, meeting Israeli support ships along the way. During fuelling by MV Lea at Gibraltar, one of the Israeli navy crew members mistakenly allowed water into the fuel tanks of INS Hetz (Arrow). It was not initially known whether the water was seawater; if it was, it could not be drained and may damage the engines. Commander Rinat asked the crew to taste the fuel and to indicate if it was salty or not. Having determined that it was not seawater, the tanks were drained. As <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> passed Gibraltar into the Mediterranean, the British monitoring station flashed a signal, asking <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> themselves. <b>The</b> <b>boats</b> gave no reply, and a Lloyd's helicopter circling over them detected no flags or identity numbers. The British personnel, who had heard the media reports of the disappearance of <b>the</b> Israeli <b>boats</b> from Cherbourg, correctly guessed <b>the</b> <b>boat's</b> nationalities and true destination, then flashed the signal [...] "bon voyage". The Israelis took it as a signal that the British understood who they were. <b>The</b> <b>boats</b> were finally spotted by television crews in the Mediterranean as they travelled fast towards Israel, hugging the coast of North Africa. Near Crete, Israeli Air Force F-4 Phantom fighters met up with <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> and flew low overhead in escort. French Defence Minister Michel Debré ordered an air strike to sink <b>the</b> <b>boats.</b> <b>The</b> French Chief of Staff refused to obey and replied he would resign rather than obey the order. The order was countermanded by Prime Minister Jacques Chaban-Delmas, who prevented any further escalation. Although the French government was furious, it realized that there was little that could be done, since <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> were already on the high seas when the ruse was uncovered. French Foreign Minister Maurice Schumann warned that if <b>the</b> <b>boats</b> appeared in Israel, [...] "the consequences will be very grave indeed".|$|R

5000|$|Boat {{people were}} {{regarded}} as competitors in job market by land dwellers, {{which could lead to}} discrimination. Yau Ma Tei boat people had their own accents, which were different with people on land. For example, the word feet in Cantonese was pronounced as [...] "goek"(腳), but boat people pronounced it as [...] "gok"(角). Because of different accents, they might be discriminated when finding jobs on land. Land dwellers could also <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> <b>boat</b> people by their appearances and names, such as Tai(娣), Kim(金), Mui(妹) etc.|$|R
