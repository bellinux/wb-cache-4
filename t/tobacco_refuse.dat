40|$|My {{research}} {{was intended to}} grasp an understanding into the legal issues surrounding the relatively recent wave of tobacco litigation and to determine whether these issues were economically valid. The main issues brought up in court are the denial of the negative health consequences of <b>tobacco,</b> <b>refusing</b> to admit that tobacco is an addictive substance, targeting to minors, and the myth of ?light? cigarettes. After understanding the main issues brought in court, I then applied {{one of the most}} fundamental principles of economics that people are rational and make rational decisions, to the reasoning behind why the tobacco industry was at fault. Using the economic principle that individuals make rational decisions based on what they believe to be ?perfect information,? the arguments in court are valid. Forty years ago it was not public knowledge that smoking causes cancer, although the tobacco industries knew since the 1950 s, and thus individuals made decisions to smoke based on what they thought to be correct information circulated by the tobacco industry that smoking did in fact not cause cancer. Furthermore, the most serious of the charges, targeting minors is also rationalized using economics. Children are incapable of making rational decisions and are protected by law from making irrational decisions. There everyone who is currently addicted to smoking as a result of smoking as a child can rightly blame the tobacco industry...|$|R

50|$|The Night Riders was {{the name}} given by the press to the militant faction of tobacco farmers during a popular {{resistance}} to the monopolistic practices of the American Tobacco Company of James B. Duke. On September 24, 1904, the tobacco planters of western Kentucky and the neighboring counties of western Tennessee formed the Dark Fired Tobacco District or Black Patch District Planters' Protective Association of Kentucky and Tennessee (called the Association or PPA). It urged farmers to boycott the American <b>Tobacco</b> Company and <b>refuse</b> to sell at the ruinously low prices it offered in a quasi monopoly market. A more militant faction of farmers, led by David A. Amoss of Caldwell County, Kentucky, resorted to physical intimidation or burning the crops of those who ignored the boycott, targeting the tobacco warehouses of the ATC itself, culminating in large scale raids of cities in the area - most prominently Hopkinsville, Kentucky in 1907.|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} the extent of commercial tobacco imagery in the lesbian, gay, and bisexual (LGB) press. Methods: Content analysis of all advertising containing tobacco related text or imagery in 20 LGB community periodicals, published between January 1990 and December 2000. Results: 3428 ads were found: 689 tobacco product ads, 1607 ads for cessation products or services, 99 ads with a political message about tobacco, and 1033 non-tobacco ads that showed tobacco (NAST). Although cessation ads were numerically dominant, tobacco product ads and NAST occupied more space and were more likely to use images. NAST almost never had an anti-tobacco message. Formal sponsorship between tobacco and other companies was very rare. Lesbian periodicals had proportionally more NAST and fewer cessation ads. Conclusions: Cigarette ads were outnumbered by NAST. Although these ads do not usually show brands, and are unlikely {{to be the result of}} formal sponsorship agreements, they may be "selling'' smoking. Tobacco control advocates should persuade editors to <b>refuse</b> <b>tobacco</b> product ads and those with gratuitous tobacco imagery...|$|R
40|$|Smoking among Malaysian {{adolescents}} {{remains a}} public health concern despite concerted efforts in tobacco control. The aims {{of this study were}} to examine the prevalence and determinants of current-smoking status in young adolescents. This cross sectional study used {{the first round of the}} Malaysian Health and Adolescents Research Team's prospective cohort study. It was conducted in three States of the Central and Northern regions of Peninsular Malaysia between March and May 2012. The study used the multistage stratified sampling design. A total of 1, 342 adolescents of both sexes, aged 12 - 13 years, were sampled from randomly selected urban and rural national schools. Information on current smoking status and associated factors were collected by a self-administered, pre-tested, validated, structured questionnaire. Seven percent of the samples were current-smokers; the majority (62 %) of them started smoking at the age of 11 years or below. The prevalence of current smoking was significantly higher in males (odds ratio [OR] = 2. 37; 95 % CI: 1. 46, 3. 84), those who were influenced by smoker friends (OR = 8. 35; 95 % CI: 4. 90, 14. 25), who were unaware of the health risks of smoking (OR = 1. 85; 95 % CI: 1. 02, 3. 36) and who reported a lack of satisfaction about their overall life (OR = 3. 26; 95 % CI: 1. 73, 6. 12). The study findings provide valuable information to strengthen the existing school-based smoking prevention program through integration of social competence and social influence curricula. The program should empower the young adolescents to <b>refuse</b> <b>tobacco</b> offers, to overcome social influences and to resist peer pressure to avoid starting smoking.

40|$|A {{large body}} of {{evidence}} demonstrates that tobacco companies use {{a wide range of}} tactics to interfere with tobacco control. Such strategies include direct and indirect political lobbying and campaign contributions, financing of research, attempting to affect the course of regulatory and policy machinery and engaging in social responsibility initiatives as part of public relations campaigns. Although more and more is known about tobacco industry tactics, a systematic, comprehensive guide is needed to assist regulators and policy-makers in combating those practices. Guidelines and recommendations exist for countering and monitoring industry marketing, and recommendations have been issued to refuse industry funding of certain activities, but no broad policy has been published to assist government officials, policy-makers and nongovernmental organizations in their interactions with the tobacco industry. The WHO Tobacco Free Initiative (TFI), the department in WHO with the mandate to control the global tobacco epidemic, monitors the activities of the tobacco industry in accordance with World Health Assembly resolution 54. 18, which urges Member States to be aware of affiliations between the tobacco industry and members of their delegations, and urges WHO and Member States to be alert to any efforts by the tobacco industry to continue its subversive practice and to assure the integrity of health policy development in any WHO meeting and in national governments. As a continuing response to this mandate, TFI convened a group of experts to discuss tobacco industry interference in tobacco control and the public health policies and initiatives of WHO and its Member States. The meeting took place at the offices of the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) in Washington DC, United States of America, on 29 – 30 October 2007. Before the meeting, participants received a background paper commissioned by TFI, which served as the basis for discussions. The experts were asked to draw up a list of topics and concepts that should be included in policies to counter attempts by the tobacco industry to interfere with tobacco control. The list facilitated discussions on gaps in scientific evidence and the challenge of finding means for countering the wide range of types of interference (e. g. political, economic and scientific). This list also provided examples of proactive ways of eliminating tobacco companies’ influence, including: policies <b>refusing</b> partnerships with <b>tobacco</b> companies; policies <b>refusing</b> <b>tobacco</b> company funding of research and programmes; rejecting self-regulatory or voluntary policies in tobacco control; encouraging divestment from tobacco investments; and promoting social indexing that excludes tobacco and businesses models {{that can be used to}} counter industry philanthropy. The meeting participants agreed that the results of the discussions should be incorporated into a document, to broaden understanding in the global public health community of the tobacco industry’s influence on tobacco control. This document is therefore a synthesis of the evidencebased discussions, revisions and suggestions of the experts and is presented in a format that can readily be used by policy-makers and is based on the best available evidence on tobacco industry attempts to interfere with tobacco control and public health. The document begins by stating that effective tobacco control and the commercial success of the tobacco industry are fundamentally incompatible and that, accordingly, the tobacco industry can be expected to seek to avoid, prevent, weaken and delay effective policies and programmes, which are against its interests. Equally, tobacco control, in seeking to maximize the decline in tobacco related disease and in the tobacco use that causes such disease, must be vigilant in monitoring the wide range of tobacco industry actions to undermine effective tobacco control. Part I describes the means used by the tobacco industry and its allies to thwart effective tobacco control and summarizes the industry’s history of undermining tobacco control, through direct lobbying and the use of third parties, academics and researchers. Part II describes the means used to monitor industry efforts to interfere with tobacco control. TFI aims for this document to provide the Contracting Parties to the WHO FCTC, and other WHO Member States, background and contextual information that may assist with the implementation of the WHO FCTC Article 5. 3 Guidelines which were adopted at the third session of Conference of Parties (COP) in Durban, South Africa in November 2008 to counter tobacco industry interference with tobacco control...|$|R
