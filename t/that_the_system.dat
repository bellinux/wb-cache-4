5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{moved off}} the coast of Africa on November5. It tracked steadily west across the tropical Atlantic Ocean.

5|$|Although {{the system}} had a {{partially}} exposed low-level circulation center, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) as the depression {{was likely to}} intensify as it was situated over high sea surface temperatures and in a favorable environment. However, by September4, wind shear quickly increased and dislocated all of the convection associated with the depression {{from the center of}} circulation. This led to the JTWC canceling their TCFA as the environment was no longer favorable for development. The following day, the JTWC declared <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> had dissipated and was no longer a suspect area for tropical cyclone development as the system was virtually stationary off the coast of Vietnam. The JMA, on the other hand, continued to monitor the cyclone as a tropical depression. Although previously declaring <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> dissipated early on September6, the JTWC began monitoring the re-developing system later that day. Convective banding had reformed, wind shear had decreased and the cyclone had less interaction with land as it slowly moved further into the South China Sea. However, late on September8, both agencies declared that the depression had dissipated off the coast of Vietnam.|$|E

5|$|As already described, chiral liquid-crystal {{molecules}} usually {{give rise}} to chiral mesophases.

5|$|At the time, {{the system}} was not {{believed}} to have been subtropical. However, there were several post-season findings that confirmed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> was indeed a subtropical storm. The first was the cloud pattern, in which it had deep convection around the center and was better organized with a well-defined center of circulation. In addition, the system had a warm core more typical of tropical cyclones as opposed to the cold core of extratropical cyclones. The warm-core nature also meant that there were no warm or cold fronts attached to the system, as temperatures did not change ahead of and behind the system until the unrelated cold front passed the Azores. Satellite imagery suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> was briefly a tropical storm as the warm core was found; however, the widespread wind field and the presence of an upper-level trough confirmed that it was merely subtropical.|$|E
5|$|Beginning on July9, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center(JTWC) began {{dispatching}} aircraft reconnaissance {{to investigate}} {{an area of}} thunderstorms between Yap State and Koror that had potential to develop into a tropical cyclone.

Upon development, observations indicated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>system</b> was quickly developing in favorable conditions, with initial reconnaissance flights finding a loose eye measuring 160km (100mi) in diameter shortly after classification as a tropical depression. Twelve hours later, the JTWC upgraded the cyclone to tropical storm status, assigning the name Billie.|$|E
