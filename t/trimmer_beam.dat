40|$|Magnetic force {{microscopy}} (MFM) is {{a widely}} used form of scanning probe microscopy (SPM) that is used for obtaining a magnetic image from a surface with nanoscale resolution. Currently, the resolution of MFM is limited to approximately 20 nm due to the long-range nature of magnetic interactions between the MFM probe's tip and the magnetic medium. This paper describes an optimal signal processing {{solution to the problem}} of achieving high resolution MFM with the goal of significantly exceeding the level at which MFM metrology currently performs, thus providing metrologists with a means of resolution increase that is believed will enable, for example, the rapid development of high-density magnetic recording media (> 100 GBit/in). This is achieved by using focused-ion <b>beam</b> <b>trimming</b> of a conventional tip to create a probe tip of predictable magnetic characteristics and then, provided that the sample could be approximated as a thin-film, using knowledge of this tip's sensitivity field for performing a deconvolution on the measured signal to better estimate the magnetic state of the surface under study. Stated differently, as the MFM measured signal is modeled as the convolution of the magnetised surface and the tip's sensitivity field, we exploit knowledge of the tip's properties to increase the resolution of the MFM image. Details of the deconvolution approach as well as images resulting from this processing are the focus of this paper...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAsphalt thin beams (112 mm x 12. 7 mm x 6. 35 mm, length x width x thickness) in a Bending Beam Rheometer (BBR) {{have been}} used in the asphalt {{industry}} as one of methods to predict low temperature cracking properties of asphalt mixtures. Given the research work dedicated to the asphalt industry, the potential benefits of testing smaller specimens (cheaper equipment, less material, faster conditioning, easier availability for quality control, etc.) are well recognized. However, the two main criticisms of using the BBR to test mixtures are raised: (a) the thickness of the beam is smaller than the maximum aggregate size; thus a single aggregate particle can affect the results of the test, and (b) such small specimens cannot represent the overall property of the mix. This paper is conducted to address the above issues by using a combination of imaging techniques, statistical analysis, and viscoelastic modeling. Three nominal maximum aggregate sizes (NMAS), 12. 5 mm (1 / 2 ”), 9. 5 mm (3 / 8 ”) and 6. 25 mm (1 / 4 ”), were prepared in a laboratory. Each one of the three NMAS specimens was cut into a six-faced block that was then scanned and analyzed its pixels using imaging techniques. Subsequently, asphalt blocks were <b>trimmed</b> into thin <b>beams</b> and tested in a BBR to obtain their stiffness and creep compliance values...|$|R

40|$|The {{question}} of “porpoising” of flying-boats {{has been the}} subject of investigation both abroad and in the United States. In Germany and England recourse has been had to the use of dynamically similar models, duplicating in the model as closely as possible all the features of the full scale flying-boat. In the towing tanks of the United States, usually a bare hull is tested, where measurements are made of resistance, load, trimming moment, and trim angle at various speeds. The results are usually furnished in the form of curves of trimming moment and draft against speed at various loadings and trim angles. Conclusions regarding “porpoising” of the full scale flying-boat cannot be drawn from the behavior of the hull alone, but it is considered possible to evaluate certain hydrodynamic stability derivatives, which, in conjunction with aerodynamic derivatives obtained from wind-tunnel tests, may be used in the stability equation to determine the behavior of the flying-boat in the planning condition. In the following discussion the aerodynamic and hydrodynamic derivatives are deduced. The aerodynamic derivatives are similar to those normally used for airplanes, but they are evaluated in terms of <b>beam,</b> <b>trim</b> angle, and other hydrodynamic terms; then the hydrodynamic derivatives are deduced, also in terms of hull dimensions and attitudes. This permits direct addition of the hydrodynamic and aerodynamic derivatives for use in the longitudinal stability equation. The criteria of stability then are applied. In addition, a factorization of the stability quartic, formulated by Dr. Millikan, is applied to determine periods of the oscillations, as well as damping factors. An example following the procedure above outlined and devised by Dr. Millikan is presented, using tank test data of a model 36 hull for hydrodynamic quantities. The aerodynamic quantities are based on an average of many modern flying-boats. The model 36 hull is selected as being fairly representative of present day flying boats. ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction The Los Alamos Isotope Production Facility (IPF) is {{actively}} engaged {{in the development of}} isotope production technologies that can utilize its 100 MeV proton beam. Characterization of the proton beam energy and current is vital for optimizing isotope production and accurately conducting research at the IPF. Motivation In order to monitor beam intensity during research irradiations, aluminum foils are interspersed in experimental stacks. A theoretical yield of 22 Na from 27 Al(p,x) 22 Na reactions is cal-culated using MCNP 6 (Monte Carlo N-Particle), TRIM (Transport of Ions in Matter), and Andersen & Ziegler (A&Z) [1] computational models. For some recent experiments, experimentally measured activities did not match computational predictions. This discrepancy motivated further experimental investigations including a direct time-of-flight measurement of the proton beam energy upstream of the target stack. The Isotope Production Program now tracks the beam energy and current by a complement of experimental and computational methods described below. Material and Methods A stacked-foil activation technique, utilizing aluminum monitor foils [2] in conjunction with a direct time-of-flight measurement helps define the current and energy of the proton beam. Theoretical yields of 22 Na activity generated in the Al monitor foils are compared with experimental measurements. Additionally, MCNP, TRIM, and A&Z computational simulations are compared with one another and with experimental data. Experimental Approach Thin foils (0. 254 mm) of high purity aluminum are encapsulated in kapton tape and stacked with Tb foils in between aluminum degraders. Following irradiation, the Al foils are assayed using γ-spectroscopy on calibrated HPGe detectors in the Chemistry Division countroom at LANL. We use the well-characterized 27 Al(p,x) 22 Na energy dependent production cross section [3] to calculate a predicted yield of 22 Na in each foil. Details of the experimental activity determination and associated uncertainties have been addressed previously [4]. The nominally stated beam parameters are 100 MeV and 100 – 120 nA for the foil stack irradiation experiments. Time-of-flight measurements performed in the month of January 2014 revealed beam energy of 99. 1 ± 0. 5 MeV. Computational Simulations Andersen & Zeigler (A&Z) is a deterministic method and also the simplest of the three com-putational methods considered. While the mean energy degradation can be calculated using the A&Z formalism, the beam current attenuation cannot. Consequentially, A&Z will also lack the ability to account for a broadening in the beam energy that a stochastic method affords. Additionally, A&Z does not account for nuclear recoil or contributions from secondary interactions. TRIM uses a stochastic based method to calculate the stopping range of incident particles applying Bethe-Block formalisms. TRIM, like A&Z, does not include contributions from nuclear recoil or contributions from secondary interactions. Computationally, TRIM is a very expensive code to run. TRIM is able to calculate a broadening in the energy of the beam; however, beam attenuation predictions are much less reliable. TRIM determines the overall beam attenuation in the whole stack to be less than one percent, whereas 7 – 10 % is expected. MCNP 6 is arguably the most sophisticated approach to modeling the physics of the experiment. It also uses a stochastic procedure for calculation, adopting the Cascade-Exciton Model (CEM 03) to track particles. The physics card is enabled in the MCNP input to track light ion recoils. Contributions from neutron and proton secondary particle interactions are included, although their contribution is minimal. For both MCNP and <b>TRIM,</b> the proton <b>beam</b> is simulated as a pencil beam. To find the current, an F 4 volumetric tally of proton flux from MCNP simulation is matched to the experimental current for the first foil in the stack. Subsequent foil currents are calculated relative to the first foil based on MCNP predictions for beam attenuation. The equation used for calculating the current from the experi-mental activity is [5]: where: is the cross section for the process, [mbarns] is the atomic mass of the target [amu] is the is the number of product nuclei pre-sent at End-of-Bombardment is the average beam current, [μA] is the density of the target material, [g/cc] is the target thickness, [cm] is the decay constant, [s− 1] is the irradiation time, [s] For each foil in the experimental stack, we also have a statistically driven broadening of the incident energy. The beam energy is modeled as a Gaussian distribution, with the tallies for each energy bin determining the parameters of the fit. TABLE 1 and FIG. 3 summarize the mean energy and standard deviation of the energy for each aluminum monitor foil. To address the energy distribution, we calculate an effective or weighted cross-section. It is especially important to account for energy broadening in regions where the associated excitation function varies rapidly. In the excitation function, we see a strong variation in the energy range from 30 – 65 MeV, the energy region cov-ered by the last 3 foils in the stack. Cross section weighting also accounts for the mean energy variation within each foil. The excitation function will overlay the Gaussian shaped flux distribution, giving rise to a lateral distribution where incrementally weighted values of the cross section are determined by the flux tally of the corresponding energy bin. With the effective cross section and the current at each of the foils, it is straight-forward to calculate the number of 22 Na atoms created and the activity of each foil using the previously stated equation. Results and Conclusion The general trend in the amount of activity produced follows the shape of the excitation func-tion for the 27 Al(p,x) 22 Na reaction. Small shifts in the incident energy upstream trickle down to produce much more pronounced shifts in the energy range of foils towards the back of the foil stack. The characteristic “rolling over” of the activity seen in the experimental foils indicates that the 6 th foil must be in the energy region below 45 MeV, where the peak of the excitation function occurs. Conservatively, computational simulations are able to accurately determine the proton beam’s energy for an energy range from 100 to 50 MeV. As the beam degrades below 50 MeV, computa-tional simulations diverge from experimentally observed energies by over-predicting the energy. This observation has been noted in past studies [6, 7] that compare the stacked foil technique with stopping-power based calculations. A complement of experimental and computational predictions allows for energy determinations at several points within target stacks. While this study focuses on an Al-Tb foil stack, the analysis of a similar Al-Th foil stack resulted in the same conclusions. Although {{we do not have a}} concurrent time-of-flight energy measurement at the time of the foil stack experiments, it is reasonable to assume that the energy at the time of the stacked foil experiments was also lower than the assumed energy of 100 MeV. Computational simulations developed in this work firmly support this assumption. Various computational models are able to predict with good agreement the energy as a function of depth for complex foil stack geometries. Their predictions diverge as the beam energy distribution broadens and statistical uncertainties propagate. A careful inspection of the codes reveals that these discrepancies likely originate from minute differences between the cross sections and stopping power tables that MCNP and TRIM/A&Z use respectively...|$|R
