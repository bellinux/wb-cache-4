40|$|We {{demonstrate}} the splitting of a low-energy electron beam {{by means of}} a microwave pseudopotential formed above a planar chip substrate. Beam splitting arises from smoothly transforming the <b>transverse</b> <b>guiding</b> potential for an electron beam from a single-well harmonic confinement into a double-well, thereby generating two separated output beams with 5 mm lateral spacing. Efficient beam splitting is observed for electron kinetic energies up to 3 eV, in excellent agreement with particle tracking simulations.

By perturbing the shape of more than 4, 000 scatterers in these superlattices we add structural disordered in a controlled manner and uncover the mechanism of disorder-induced transverse localization at the chip-scale.

40|$|Many fields {{including}} {{telecommunications and}} biomedicine require a laser source emitting {{in the blue}} spectral region with a diffraction-limited beam. To obtain such a source, the solution adopted in this thesis work {{is to develop a}} high-power Nd-doped fiber laser source operating on the 4 F 3 / 2 - 4 I 9 / 2 transition of Neodymium ion at 900 nm. After frequency doubling in a non-linear crystal, it is then possible to have access to wavelengths around 450 nm. However in aluminosilicate fibers, there is a strong competition between the three-level transition 4 F 3 / 2 - 4 I 9 / 2 of Nd 3 + ion and the four-level scheme of the 4 F 3 / 2 - 4 I 11 / 2 transition around 1060 nm, which constitutes the main obstacle to overcome to obtain an efficient laser emission at 900 nm. As a first step, a theoretical study allows us to determine optimal geometrical parameters of double-clad Nd-doped fibers to foster laser emission on the transition of interest. Once fabricated by our industrial partner iXblue, the optimized fibers are used in several laser and amplification architectures leading for instance to wavelength-tunability on a wide spectral bandwidth around 900 nm and to selective amplification of <b>transverse</b> <b>guided</b> modes. In parallel, performances reached in terms of power and beam spatial quality at 900 nm permits an efficient frequency conversion, which {{led to the development of}} new blue laser sources operating in continuous-wave and pulsed regimes around 450 nm...|$|R

Each backplane array is formed monolithically on a wafer. The technology is based on the use of Grating Surface Emitting (GSE) waveguides formed on a wafer containing quantum-well and separate confinement waveguide layers. These layers are used for <b>transverse</b> <b>guiding,</b> gain, modulation, detection, and for the formation of wavelength tunable distributed-Bragg reflector lasers. The required surface structures are formed photolithographically. The GSE waveguides act as efficient antennae that radiate light at angles selected by tuning the wavelength of the lasers. The same waveguides may be used as the receiving antennae when the array is used in the receiving mode. Thus, wavelength tuning is used to direct each row of the transmitting array to the desired row of the receiving array. In summary: The optical backplane array will have the following characteristics: Any row of a 32 x 32 GSE array may be optically connected to any row of a second 32 x 32 array. Only one switch decision is required to switch 32 parallel connections to any one of 32 positions. Each monolithic array can be used as both transmitter and receiver by switching the bias on the quantum-well switch-detectors. Separate transmitting and receiving structures could be provided for duplex operation.

40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{this work}} is to model the {{evolution}} of the modal distribution of the electromagnetic field as it propagates along a randomly deformed multimode optical waveguide. When the number of guided modes becomes large we can regard the discrete set of modes as a quasi continuum. In some cases, nearest neighbor coupling predominates over other power transfer mechanisms and the coupling process can be ideally described in terms of a diffusion equation. The theory is applied to the propagation of <b>guided</b> <b>transverse</b> electric (TE) field waves in a slab waveguide with parabolic refractive index profile. Numerical simulations are in good agreement with theoretical results, and the error is shown to behave as the inverse of the number of guided modes.

40|$|We report {{generation}} of high-order spatial modes in the UV range through nonlinear frequency {{conversion of the}} femtosecond 800 nm radiation in microstructured fibers. The process is distinct from Supercontinuum generation and is sensitive to fiber tip morphology. One of the manifestations of the unusual nonlinear properties of the microstructured (PCF) fibers is the robust supercontinuum generation from a few centimeters of the fiber with femtosecond oscillator pumping around 800 nm. Even though the fiber can be multimode at wavelengths down to the fundamental, supercontinuum is usually observed exiting the fiber in the fundamental mode. Recent experiments, however, evidenced the existence of other nonlinear effects in PCFs indicating critical role of phase matching between various spatial modes of the fiber. When the PCF is pumped by the 1550 nm femtosecond pulses, distinct visible bands are generated at the output belonging to distinct spatial modes of the fiber. Here we report that similar nonlinear mechanism exists when PCF is pumped by Ti:Sapphire femtosecond oscillator near 800 nm central wavelength. In this case, however, higher-order modes are generated in the UV range with observed wavelengths up to 310 nm, Fig. 1. Moreover, the effect is observed only when the input tip of the fiber has a non-flat surface, that is freshly cleaved fiber is prepared by melting the tip as described. The experiment consists of a femtosecond oscillator delivering 150 -fs pulses with average power of up to 1. 3 W to the fiber tip. After the attenuator, Faraday isolator and polarization control optics, the light {{is focused on the}} tip of the PCF with an aspheric lens. The fiber was a high-air-filling fraction single strand fused silica suspended by a honeycomb web of silica pellicles running {{along the length of the}} fiber, which was a few tens of centimeters in our experiments. The diameter of the core was approximately 2. 5 microns which makes the fiber highly multimode at 800 nm. At low pump powers coupled to the freshly cleaved fiber typical supercontinuum is observed at the output. When the input power is increased further a threshold is reached at near 1. 1 W when the supercontinuum generation suddenly ceases. This was later identified as the melting of the fiber tip by SEM analysis and <b>transverse</b> <b>guiding</b> scans, shown in Fig. 3. Generation of the UV modes is observed after the fiber tip melt at various input power levels but was found to be very sensitive to the input polarization of the fundamental. Two images of the output UV mode profiles are shown in Fig. 2. These findings strongly suggest that launching the fundamental light into a higher-order spatial mode was critical for the process. The aforementioned threshold corresponds to the melting of the fiber tip after which the tip is no longer flat but rather works as a phase mask for the coupling of the input light. Such a mask decreases the efficiency of the fundamental mode excitation leading to the disappearance of the supercontinuum and increases the efficiency of higher-mode excitation which results in the UV generation through phase matching to even higher-order modes...|$|R

40|$|For {{probable}} {{values of}} the lunar electromagnetic properties, a transverse magnetic surface wave may be propagated along the solar wind plasma-moon interface in the frequency range from about one kilohertz to about ten kilohertz. The horizontal propagation characteristics of this surface wave {{as a function of}} frequency may be used to probe the lunar electromagnetic properties to a probable maximum depth of about fifty kilometers. The electromagnetic fields of idealized dipole sources located within a few meters of the lunar surface and immersed in the solar wind plasma are considered. For a vertical electric dipole, or broadside to a horizontal magnetic dipole, the surface fields at radial distances greater than about ten kilometers are found to be dominated by the surface wave. These sources may also excite <b>transverse</b> magnetic wave <b>guide</b> modes confined between the plasma and a lunar conducting basement. If a wet model of the moon is adopted, only the surface wave mode will be present, and it will be sensitive to the depth of the ice to water transition, expected at about one kilometer, and to lunar dielectric properties between the transition depth and the surface. If the moon is dry, a thermally activated conductive basement is expected at about one hundred kilometers, and the surface wave will be sensitive to dielectric properties to a probable maximum depth of about fifty kilometers.

40|$|Obese {{patients}} are {{at greater risk}} of gynaecologic surgery. Laparotomy is generally performed, even though this approach is regarded as highly invasive, whereas laparoscopy, though minimally invasive, is relatively contraindicated because of the high conversion rates to laparotomy. In light of this, we propose laparoscopically <b>guided</b> <b>transverse</b> minilaparotomy (LGTM) as a minimally invasive alternative technique. The rationale of diagnostic laparoscopy is to evaluate the feasibility of a minimally invasive approach. We have evaluated the feasibility and compared the outcomes with a historical group treated with laparotomy (LPTM), in morbidly obese patients (MOP) subjected to gynaecologic surgery. From November 2004, MOPs with body mass index (BMI) ≥ 40 kg/m² and admitted for gynaecologic surgery (early stage endometrial cancer and benign disease) were enrolled in this observational study and submitted to LGTM. Patients with a uterine size greater than the umbilical transverse line and with indication for vaginal surgery were excluded operative data and outcome were prospectively recorded. LGTM was feasible in 34 cases (87 %) out of 39. In two women, the procedure was aborted due to intraperitoneal and ovarian malignant disease spread diagnosed at laparoscopy. In three cases, conversion was necessary due to severe adhesions in one case; laparoscopically unrecognized disease spread in the parametria in the second, and in the remaining case a right common iliac vein injury during lymphadenectomy. When compared to LPTM, haemoglobin drop and postoperative stay were significantly reduced with LGTM. Complications were higher in the control group: due to a significantly higher incidence of wound dehiscence (OR 0. 27, 95 % CI 0. 05 - 1. 32, p< 0. 05).

A tandem Fabry-Perot consisting of two synchronized 3 -pass cavities is {{used to measure the}} frequency shift of light which is inelastically scattered from acoustic waves. The contrast ratio of this interferometer exceeds 10 ¹⁰ and provides sufficient stray light rejection to detect the surface Rayleigh wave and as many as 13 higher order acoustic modes. The elastic stiffness constants of the anisotropic superlattices were estimated by fitting the measured acoustic mode velocities to a parameterized acoustic model. A comparison is made between these elastic constants and those predicted from the properties of the separate bulk constituents. The dependence of bilayer wavelength on the elastic properties of both Cu/Nb and Mo/Ta superlattices over the range of roughly 10 to 200 Å was determined. The unexpected softening of Cu/Nb superlattices within a range of bilayer wavelengths near 20 Å which was reported previously is qualitatively similar to the measurements reported here. It is shown that the elastic stiffness coefficient with the largest variation is c₄₄. The stiffness variations determined for the Mo/Ta samples are much smaller than for Cu/Nb. It is suggested that this is due to either structural differences (Cu/Nb is fcc-bcc and Mo/Ta is bcc-bcc) or the smaller interfacial lattice mismatch for Mo/Ta. Interfacial strain is found to be strongly correlated with the stiffness variations of the Mo/Ta samples. However, the underlying cause of these variations in stiffness remains anomalous. This dissertation also reports the first observations of Love waves and Stoneley waves by Brillouin scattering. The purely <b>transverse</b> Love waves <b>guided</b> by Cu/Nb films were detected by elasto-optic scattering from the evanescent acoustic strain in the sapphire substrate. The stiffness coefficient c₁₂ of the hexagonally symmetric metal film cannot be determined by the other guided acoustic waves which ripple the surface. Molybdenum in contact with fused silica is predicted to support a Stoneley wave which is guided by the interface. The lowest order Sezawa made guided by a molybdenum film was found to evolve to the Stoneley wave as the film becomes thicker. These measurements together with measurements of the surface Rayleigh wave show that the stiffness of the sputtered metal films is quite homogeneous and independent of film thickness...|$|R
