5|$|Because of his {{involvement}} with the Pinochet government, there were international protests when Friedman was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1976.

Friedman answered that he never was an adviser to the dictatorship, but only gave some lectures and seminars on inflation, and met with officials, including Augusto Pinochet, while in Chile.|$|E

5|$|In Quenya, {{there are}} many {{similarities}} in form between prepositions and adverbs since the grammatical case already determines <b>the</b> <b>relation</b> <b>of</b> verb and object. Many Quenya prepositions have adverb-like uses with no complement. In Common Eldarin, these prepositions were postpositions instead, and later became inflectional endings. Case markings combine primarily with nouns, whereas prepositions can combine with phrases of many different categories. This is why most prepositions in Quenya are used with a noun in the nominative case.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To examine <b>the</b> <b>relations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family {{environment}} to adjustment to juvenile rheumatoid arthritis (JRA), {{and to examine}} how those relations are influenced by child sex and age. METHOD: Ninety-four children with JRA completed a questionnaire on {{family environment}} and adjustment. RESULTS: Family cohesion was related to good adjustment, whereas family conflict was related to poor adjustment. Some <b>relations</b> <b>of</b> family cohesion to adjustment were stronger for younger than for older children. <b>The</b> <b>relations</b> <b>of</b> child autonomy to adjustment depended on child sex and age.

Galois theory, initiated by Evariste Galois in the 1830s, is devoted to understanding the symmetries of field extensions.

Moreover, it shows that quintic equations are algebraically unsolvable.|$|E
5|$|According to the Augustan History, Zenobia's {{descendants}} were Roman nobility {{during the}} reign of Emperor Valens (reigned 364–375). Eutropius and Jerome chronicled the queen's descendants in Rome during the fourth and fifth centuries. They may have been the result of a reported marriage to a Roman spouse or offspring who accompanied her from Palmyra; both theories, however, are tentative. Zonaras is the only historian to note that Zenobia had daughters; he wrote that one married Aurelian, who married the queen's other daughters to distinguished Romans. According to Southern, the emperor's marriage to Zenobia's daughter is a fabrication. Another descent claim is <b>the</b> <b>relation</b> <b>of</b> saint Zenobius of Florence with the queen; the Girolami banking family claimed descent from the fifth century saint, and the alleged relation was first noted in 1286. The family also extended their roots to Zenobia by claiming that the saint was a descendant of her.|$|E
5|$|Justinian's Chalke was a {{rectangular}} building, with four engaged piers supporting a central dome on pendentives, {{which in turn}} rested on four barrel arches in the typical Byzantine fashion. The piers {{to the south and}} north were somewhat lower than those to the east and west. The central structure was adjoined by two smaller chambers on either side to the south and north, each again featuring a vaulted roof. <b>The</b> <b>relation</b> <b>of</b> the Church of Christ Chalkites with the gate is unclear; Cyril Mango suggested that it was located to its left, but it has also been proposed that it was actually built atop the gatehouse itself. It is known that the chapel was placed atop an elevated platform, and 18th-century depictions locate it some 100 m southeast of the Hagia Sophia.|$|E

5|$|Nyuserre Ini (also Niuserre Ini or Neuserre Ini; in Greek {{known as}} Rathurês, ´Ραθούρης) was an Ancient Egyptian pharaoh, the sixth {{ruler of the}} Fifth Dynasty during the Old Kingdom period. He is {{credited}} with a reign of 24 to 35 years depending on the scholar, and likely lived {{in the second half}} of the 25th century BCE. Nyuserre was the younger son of Neferirkare Kakai and queen Khentkaus II, and the brother of the short-lived king Neferefre. He may have succeeded his brother directly, as indicated by much later historical sources. Alternatively, Shepseskare may have reigned between the two as advocated by Miroslav Verner, albeit only for a few weeks or months at the most. <b>The</b> <b>relation</b> <b>of</b> Shepseskare with Neferefre and Nyuserre remains highly uncertain. Nyuserre was in turn succeeded by Menkauhor Kaiu, who could have been his nephew and a son of Neferefre.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>relation</b> <b>of</b> {{church and}} state in Zwingli's mind is best {{represented}} in a statue by the Wasserkirche, where he stands with a Bible {{in one hand and}} a sword in the other. For him, the {{church and state}} are one under the sovereign rule of God. The development of the complex relationship between church and state in Zwingli's view can only be understood by examining the context of his life, the city of Zürich, and the wider Swiss Confederation. His earliest writings before he became a reformer, such as The Ox (1510) and The Labyrinth (1516), reveal a patriotic love of his land, a longing for liberty, and opposition to the mercenary service where young Swiss citizens were sent to fight in foreign wars for the financial benefit of the state government. His life as a parish priest and an army chaplain helped to develop his concern for morality and justice. He saw his ministry not limited to a private sphere, but to the people as a whole.|$|E
