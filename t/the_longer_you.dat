25|$|Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode an A- grade, saying: What’s most {{striking}} about “No Sanctuary,” {{apart from its}} attempts at thematic resonance, is how quickly and brutally the question of Terminus is resolved. If you’d asked me beforehand, I would’ve guessed {{that it would take}} {{at least a couple of}} episodes before Rick and the others could free themselves. I wouldn’t have been exactly excited about that, because <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> <b>you</b> stay in a community full of murderous cannibals without any major character being killed, the more the tension just drips away, but it seemed like a reasonable assumption to make, especially when taking into consideration how tricky it was going to be to build the rest of the season. Without the prison home base or an obvious major villain (goodbye, the Governor), we need something to create structure—a group of psychos who harvest human flesh seems like too good a concept to dispose of immediately.|$|E

"For a {{long period}} of time I've been trying to get better and better, but clearly <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> <b>you</b> don't play, the {{likelihood}} of playing again gets smaller and smaller each day, especially at my age," [...] Öhlund told the Tampa Tribune in April 2013.

500|$|Many reviewers {{found the}} battle system a {{refreshing}} mix from other role-playing games. Fitch of Electronic Gaming Monthly commented that [...] "it keeps getting better <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> <b>you</b> play". Joystiq's Kubba called the game's combat a [...] "triumph", praising {{its ability to}} blend different styles, and GameTrailers found it [...] "immensely satisfying". Kotaku's Schreier felt that the combat never feels unfair, although criticized {{the use of the}} artificial intelligence during the battle. Phil Iwaniuk of Official PlayStation Magazine found the game's consistent battle encounters irritating, but that combat is [...] "otherwise a pleasure". Polygons Kollar felt that the game's artificial intelligence resulted in a [...] "sloppy" [...] and [...] "frustrating" [...] combat system.|$|E
500|$|There {{are more}} {{favorable}} reviews: E! Online gave the album an A {{and said that}} its [...] "rich, exotic flavor gets more intense <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> <b>you</b> chew on it." [...] Stylus Magazine called it [...] "a great album, and an outstanding place for prospective new Wilco fans to start." [...] Neumu.net gave it nine stars out of ten and called it [...] "a fierce record". Almost Cool gave it a score of 8.75 out of ten and said, [...] "I'm not sure if it's the work by O'Rourke or the progression of the group (or a little of both), but this disc is so multi-layered that it's easy to hear new things many many times after the first listen." [...] Billboard gave it a favorable review and called it [...] "a more adventurous and rewarding release". The Austin Chronicle gave it four stars out of five and said that [...] "After a while -- a familiarity period if you will -- {{it becomes clear that}} these songs are not only fully realized, they're damn near brilliant." [...] Playlouder gave it four stars out of five and called it [...] "The most worth-the-wait long-awaited album in the world... ever? Could be..." [...] Uncut also gave the album four stars out of five and said, [...] "The most common description of this much-discussed album {{over the past few months}} is that YHF is Americana's Kid A. In truth, it's more successful than that." [...] Blender likewise gave it four stars out of five and stated: [...] "Tweedy whittles down the arrangements and drops in enough experimental nuances to make the whole thing sound refreshingly lo-fi." [...] Q likewise gave it four stars and called it [...] "battered, bonkers and bewitching in equal parts" [...] and that it [...] "at last finds Wilco's 'interesting' phase become downright fascinating." [...] Yahoo! Music UK gave it eight stars out of ten and said, [...] "Tweedy takes conventional songforms birthed on his acoustic guitar and scrambles them completely, reassembled into fractured, dissonant epics with the help of the reliably brilliant Jim O'Rourke." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{think the}} way the game is written {{is that when you}} first start playing it, it is fun, and you make great accomplishments. And then the further you get into it, the higher level you get, <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> <b>you</b> have to stay on it to move onward, and then it isn't fun anymore. But by then you're addicted, and you can't leave it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Patton married Cristina Zuccatosta, an Italian artist, in 1994. The couple divided {{their time}} between San Francisco and Bologna, Italy, until their {{separation}} in 2001. Patton used {{to own a}} home in Bologna and speaks Italian. Regarding his close association with Italy, Patton stated, [...] "It happened after I got married. I married an Italian lady, and I had to get acquainted. Basically, it started with the language because her family and her parents didn't really speak English. I had to learn the language, so I did that. <b>The</b> <b>longer</b> <b>you</b> spend {{in a place like}} that, it really sucks you in. It really envelopes you and makes you feel like one of them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Elliott, later {{speaking}} about the session, said [...] "The technique I used on this man was {{to get him to}} completely relax. I got him started counting by ones, twos, threes, etc., to a hundred and then backwards. I had established in his mind that I was his friend. He knew he was in very serious trouble and he knew he was innocent. When he went under, he was counting by threes backward. He was completely relaxed. The critical stage is the next state when you say the subject is cataleptic. <b>The</b> <b>longer</b> <b>you</b> keep them in the state of catalepsy, the deeper they sink into the third state. I kept him ten minutes in this state of catalepsy. He {{was in a state of}} extreme exhaustion. Sweat was on his face. Observing that even Bill [...] was still somewhat skeptical of hypnosis, whether or not the man was truly hypnotized or faking, I resorted to a fail safe demonstration. Through suggestion, I removed all feeling, reflex actions, etc., from the subject's right arm and stuck a burning cigarette to his arm--absolutely no reaction. Bill was thoroughly convinced." ...|$|E
2500|$|National {{security}} reporter Spencer Ackerman {{said the}} film [...] "does not present torture as a silver bullet {{that led to}} bin Laden; it presents torture as the ignorant alternative to that silver bullet". Critic Glenn Kenny said that he [...] "saw a movie that subverted a lot of expectations concerning viewer identification and empathy" [...] and that [...] "rather than endorsing the barbarity, the picture makes the viewer in a sense complicit with it", which is [...] " [...] whole other can of worms". Writer Andrew Sullivan said, [...] "the movie is not an apology for torture, as so many have said, and as I have worried about. It is an exposure of torture. It removes any doubt that war criminals ran this country for seven years". Filmmaker Michael Moore similarly said, [...] "I left the movie thinking it made an incredible statement against torture", and noted that the film showed the abject brutality of torture. Critic Andrew O'Hehir said that the filmmaker's position on torture in the film is ambiguous, and creative choices were made and the film poses [...] "excellent questions for us to ask ourselves, arguably defining questions of the age, and I think <b>the</b> <b>longer</b> <b>you</b> look at them the thornier they get".|$|E

The gift of holding one's tongue seems to have skipped me, but you have it in full force. I can't say just how you would behave under peine forte et dure, but under ordinary pressure you are certainly able to keep your own counsel. Why didn't you mention this encounter at dinner?
