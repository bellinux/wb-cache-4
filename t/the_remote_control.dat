5|$|Consumer Electronics Control (CEC) is an HDMI feature {{designed}} to allow the user to command and control up to 15 CEC-enabled devices, that are connected through HDMI, by using only one of their remote controls (for example by controlling a television set, set-top box, and DVD player using only <b>the</b> <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> of the TV). CEC also allows for individual CEC-enabled devices to command and control each other without user intervention.|$|E
5|$|At 02:39 UTC on Monday July 21, 1969, Armstrong {{opened the}} hatch, and at 02:51 UTC began his descent to the lunar surface. <b>The</b> <b>Remote</b> <b>Control</b> Unit {{controls}} {{on his chest}} kept him from seeing his feet. Climbing down the nine-rung ladder, Armstrong pulled a D-ring to deploy the Modular Equipment Stowage Assembly (MESA) folded against Eagle side and activate the TV camera, and at 02:56:15 UTC he set his left foot on the surface. The first landing used slow-scan television incompatible with commercial TV, so it was displayed on a special monitor and a conventional TV camera viewed this monitor, significantly reducing {{the quality of the}} picture. The signal was received at Goldstone in the United States but with better fidelity by Honeysuckle Creek Tracking Station in Australia. Minutes later the feed was switched to the more sensitive Parkes radio telescope in Australia. Despite some technical and weather difficulties, ghostly black and white images of the first lunar EVA were received and broadcast to at least 600 million people on Earth. Although copies of this video in broadcast format were saved and are widely available, recordings of the original slow scan source transmission from the lunar surface were accidentally destroyed during routine magnetic tape re-use at NASA.|$|E

When they use the remote, the kids enter the world of Itchy and Scratchy. Bart and Lisa are soon hunted by Itchy and Scratchy. Back in the Simpson house, Homer enters {{the living room and}} watches the show. Oblivious to what he sees, Homer decides to change the channel, and Bart, Lisa, Itchy, and Scratchy wind up on Live with Regis and Kathie Lee. They end up back at Itchy's house and urge Homer from inside the TV to use the remote to get them out, who eventually succeeds in doing so. Unfortunately, Itchy and Scratchy also escape. At first, the family is scared, but realize how small the two characters are and decide to keep them as pets.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} Crunch Bandicoot {{was designed}} by Craig Whittle of Traveller's Tales and Sean Krankel of Universal. The concept of battling mini-bosses within the game's levels was dropped to uphold the fast and frantic pace of the series' gameplay. Multiplayer capability was also considered before being dropped. An earlier draft of the story featured an alternate version of the game's climax and ending, which involved Crash battling Crunch in a mechanical robot suit. At {{the end of the}} fight, Crunch would destroy Crash's suit with a bolt of electricity. The resulting debris would render Cortex unconscious, destroy <b>the</b> <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> device controlling Crunch and start an electrical fire in the space station. As the Bandicoots escape to resume their beach-going vacation, the ruins of the space station would crash-land onto the island of Cortex's original settlement, conveniently allowing Cortex and Uka Uka to resume their world domination bids.|$|E

25|$|Harding {{left the}} lead {{locomotive}} No.5017 running to keep air pressure supplied to the train's air brakes and also applied {{a number of}} hand brakes. Yves Bourdon, a member of MMA's Board of Directors, stated that the air brakes of all locomotives and freight cars had been activated, as well as hand brakes on 5 locomotives and 10 of the 72 freight cars. However, the TSB agrees with a July 6 statement to police by the train's engineer that he set hand brakes on just the five locomotive engines, a buffer car, and a car housing <b>the</b> <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> apparatus. The engineer also attempted a brake test but incorrectly left the locomotive air brakes on; this gave the false impression that the hand brakes alone would hold the train.|$|E
25|$|By {{the third}} day of his capture, Bryson had earned {{sufficient}} trust from Berdella to persuade him to establish a regime of tying his hands in front of him after his sexual abuse rather than above his head and to the bed upon the excuse that his (Berdella's) doing so was restricting the circulation to his arms; he had also persuaded Berdella to leave a television on within the room, with <b>the</b> <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> placed between his legs whenever Berdella was out of the room. However, he would later state to investigators that he had thought almost constantly about escaping.

25|$|Radio {{remote control}} (RF remote control) {{is used to}} control distant objects {{using a variety of}} radio signals {{transmitted}} by <b>the</b> <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> device. As a complementary method to infrared remote controls, the radio remote control is used with electric garage door or gate openers, automatic barrier systems, burglar alarms and industrial automation systems. Standards used for RF remotes are: Bluetooth AVRCP, ZigBee (RF4CE), Z-Wave. Most remote controls use their own coding, transmitting from 8 to 100 or more pulses, fixed or Rolling code, using OOK or FSK modulation. Also, transmitters or receivers can be universal, meaning they are able to work with many different codings. In this case, the transmitter is normally called a universal remote control duplicator because it is able to copy existing remote controls, while the receiver is called a universal receiver because it works with almost any remote control in the market.|$|E
25|$|The {{impetus for}} a more complex type of {{television}} remote control came in 1973, {{with the development of}} the Ceefax teletext service by the BBC. Most commercial remote controls at that time had a limited number of functions, sometimes as few as three: next channel, previous channel, and volume/off. This type of control did not meet the needs of teletext sets, where pages were identified with three-digit numbers. A remote control to select teletext pages would need buttons for each numeral from zero to nine, as well as other control functions, such as switching from text to picture, and the normal television controls of volume, channel, brightness, colour intensity, etc. Early teletext sets used wired remote controls to select pages, but the continuous use of <b>the</b> <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> required for teletext quickly indicated the need for a wireless device. So BBC engineers began talks with one or two television manufacturers, which led to early prototypes in around 1977â€“1978 that could control many more functions. ITT was one of the companies and later gave its name to the ITT protocol of infrared communication.|$|E
25|$|The CAIB {{determined}} that a rescue mission, though risky, might have been possible provided NASA management had taken action soon enough. Normally, a rescue mission is not possible, due to {{the time required to}} prepare a shuttle for launch, and the limited consumables (power, water, air) of an orbiting shuttle. However, Atlantis was well along in processing for a planned March 1 launch on STS-114, and Columbia carried an unusually large quantity of consumables due to an Extended Duration Orbiter package. The CAIB {{determined that}} this would have allowed Columbia to stay in orbit until flight day 30 (February 15). NASA investigators determined that Atlantis processing could have been expedited with no skipped safety checks for a February 10 launch. Hence, if nothing went wrong, there was a five-day overlap for a possible rescue. As mission control could deorbit an empty shuttle, but could not control the orbiter's reentry and landing, it would likely have sent Columbia into the Pacific Ocean; NASA later developed <b>the</b> <b>Remote</b> <b>Control</b> Orbiter system to permit mission control to land a shuttle.|$|E

25|$|Root threatens Mulch with {{imprisonment}} in {{the goblin}} prison Howler's Peak, and offers the dwarf a two-day head start if he assists in the break-in. The team use Mulch's original strategy to enter {{through one of}} the titanium foundation rods. One rod was not actually solid as Mulch and his cousin had diverted sewage into the shaft instead. After reaching the bottom of the foundation rod, and climbing through Mulch's recyclings, Butler, Root and Holly mount a desperate charge to the communications centre. While the three soldiers battle through an army of goblins, Artemis enters the network of deactivated plasma cannons to reach the centre by another route. Artemis manages to sneak into the hub long enough to communicate with Foaly, who uses Artemis's laptop to play back Cudgeon's own voice, revealing that Cudgeon planned to betray the goblins. Cudgeon is unfazed, and reactivates the plasma cannons to knock out all the goblins in Koboi Labs. Butler, Root and Holly smash their way into the centre, where Cudgeon holds Artemis at gunpoint. However, Foaly calls Artemis' mobile phone, and Artemis hands it to Koboi, who is then enraged to find that Cudgeon planned to betray her too. The two masterminds grapple with each other on Opal's hoverchair, and Cudgeon is killed when he is thrown into the open DNA cannon plasma feed, while the crash causes Opal to blackout, and destroys <b>the</b> <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> used by Opal to control LEP weaponry. Foaly uses the restored power to activate DNA cannons in Police Plaza, neutralizing most of the goblins involved in the revolt. Foaly remains in the Operations Booth, as the LEP outside, commanded by Captain Trouble Kelp, still think he is to blame for the revolt.|$|E
25|$|Sony added TV {{output to}} the PSP Slim through Firmware update 3.60. It can output in a {{conventional}} aspect ratio (4:3) or widescreen (16:9), and offers a screensaver if the PSP is inactive for a set amount of time. It is able to output games, videos, and other media. To achieve TV output on the Slim model, Composite, S-Video, Component (YPBPR) and D-Terminal (YPBPR) cables are sold separately by Sony. PSP format games are output as a progressive scan signal, which can be carried only by the Component and D-Terminal cables, and displayed on televisions which support progressive scan. They are also rendered at the 480Ã—272 resolution of the PSP screen, rather than the 720Ã—480 resolution used for output, and are not upscaled, meaning that they are displayed with black windowboxing when viewed to an external display. This can be overcome on some TVs by using built-in zoom functionality. However, the PSP system software, music player and video playback are displayed in full-screen. As of firmware update 5.00, PlayStation (PSone) format software purchased from the PlayStation store is output in full-screen mode and optionally in interlaced format for non-progressive displays. The maximum resolution through TV output is 720Ã—480 pixels and composite video uses NTSC color encoding (no PAL composite signal is available; European TVs must be NTSC compatible {{to be used with}} a PSP via composite). The old PSP-1000 model is not capable of this feature due to a slightly different port. As a result, original PSP accessories (using the connector) will not work with the Slim and the Slim's accessories will not work with the original PSP. Sony released a new version of <b>the</b> <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> accessory designed for the Slim as a result. The PSP Slim can still use 3.5mm headphones, like the old PSP-1000. The Serial Port is not available on the PSP-E1000, thus it can't have TV-output and remote controls connected.|$|E
25|$|T-55AGM - Ukrainian T-54/T-55 modernization. It {{brings up}} the T-54/T-55 tanks to T-80 standard. It can also be applied to Chinese made Type 59 and Soviet T-62. It is fitted with 5TDFM, {{two-stroke}} liquid-cooled multi-fuel supercharged diesel engine with boxing pistons which develops 850hp (634kW), improved running gear, automated movement control system with a steering handlebar control, additional passive protection, built-in explosive reactive armour, countermeasures system, new fire suppression system with over-ride facilities at the commander's station, automatic loader which holds 18 rounds and anti-aircraft machine gun that can be aimed and fired from within the turret under a complete armour protection. The anti-aircraft machine gun is installed on the commander's cupola and {{is intended to be}} fired at air and ground targets. The buyer can choose between two main armament options: 125mm KBM1 smoothbore gun or 120mm KBM2 smoothbore gun. Both of them with use of enhanced performance conventional ammunition and barrel-launched ATGM can defeat modern tanks form distance of 2000â€“3000 m and up to 5,000 m using the ATGM. The tank can carry at least 30 rounds. The 125mm KBM1 smoothbore gun weighs 2,5 tonnes, has a barrel length of 6 m (48 calibers) and can fire APFSDS, HEAT and HE-FRAG rounds while 120mm KBM2 smoothbore gun weighs 2,63 tonnes, has a barrel length of 6 m (50 calibers) and can fire all types of ammunition that meet the requirements of NATO standards and Ukrainian-made ATGM. Both guns have normal recoil length of 26â€“30cm and maximum recoil length of 31cm. The tank can be armed with either the KT-7.62 or the PKT-7.62 coaxial machine gun and can carry 3,000 rounds for it. The tank can also be armed with either KT-12.7 or NSVT-12.7 heavy machine gun for AA protection and can carry 450 rounds for it. The approximate successful range is 2km during day and 800 m during night. The AA HMG can be elevated between -5 to +70 degrees. <b>The</b> <b>remote</b> <b>control</b> for anti-aircraft machine gun is stabilized in the vertical axis during automatic mode (by using the TKN-5 sight) and is using the PZU-7 sight for semi-automatic mode.|$|E
