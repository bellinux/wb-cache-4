[...] Nearby U.S. Marine listening posts heard [...] "clanking" [...] sounds, human voices, and other noises before withdrawing {{to the west bank}} of the creek. At 01:30 Ichiki's force opened fire with machine guns and mortars on the Marine positions on {{the west bank of the}} creek, and a first wave of about 100 Imperial soldiers charged across the sandbar towards the Marines.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Since the {{introduction}} of ultrasound (US) contrast imaging, the imaging systems use a fixed emitting frequency. However {{it is known that}} the insonified medium is time-varying and therefore an adapted time-varying excitation is expected.

Two algorithms have been proposed <b>to</b> <b>find</b> an <b>US</b> excitation fo...|$|R

50|$|Blood {{sausages}} {{are very}} difficult <b>to</b> <b>find</b> in <b>US</b> supermarkets. Brussels, Wisconsin and Sturgeon Bay are all home to local grocers who produce blood sausage, due to their large Belgian American populations. Supermarkets throughout Maine also carry locally produced blood pudding due to the state's large French Canadian population. In southeastern Michigan, Polish-style Kaszanka {{can be found in}} supermarkets throughout the year and is very popular.|$|R

50|$|Both {{automatic}} transmissions were manufactured by ZF - {{they were the}} 3-speed 3 HP 22, which was available on the M10 316 and 318i models until year 1985, and the 4-speed 4 HP 22, which was available on all models later.320i and 325i {{have the option of}} the sport automatic, that was an electronic box rather than the usual fully mechanical box.

Gray-Dort scrambled <b>to</b> <b>find</b> another <b>U.S.</b> based partner to no avail, and the last few years of its life were spent liquidating assets.|$|R
