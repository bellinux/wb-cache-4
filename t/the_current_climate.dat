25|$|Livestock {{production}} {{is by far}} the biggest cause of land use, as it accounts for 30% of the global land surface. It is probably the leading player in biodiversity loss, as it causes deforestation, land degradation, pollution, climate change, overfishing, and invasions by alien species. Livestock is also responsible for at least 20% of the world's greenhouse gas emissions, which are the main cause of <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>climate</b> change. This is due to feed production, enteric fermentation from ruminants, manure storage and processing, and transportation of animal products. The greenhouse gas emissions from livestock production greatly exceeds the greenhouse gas emissions of any other human activity. Some authors argue that by far the best thing we can do to slow climate change is a global shift towards a vegetarian or vegan diet.|$|E

25|$|For Daly, by 1879 {{the time}} for action was right. He was expressing impatience in the Connaught Telegraph with {{achieving}} anything for the tenants, either through constitutional means or John Devoy's 'New Departure' (an 'unholy alliance' between pragmatic Fenians prepared to delay their resort to force, and radical Home Rulers). Delay could mean desperate men resorting to another failed uprising which he abhorred. Parnell was positioning himself {{to take over the}} Home Rule League after Isaac Butt died, and a growing land campaign would give him an issue for the coming election. Daly was not a Fenian but was prepared to accept any meaningful assistance short of violence from them. <b>The</b> <b>current</b> <b>climate</b> of the New Departure offered a perhaps short-lived opportunity to combine Fenian mass mobilisation and muscle, with activism within the constitutional system provided by Parnell and O'Connor Power, with Michael Davitt the key man in both camps.|$|E
25|$|The {{amount of}} time that a private equity firm spends raising capital varies {{depending}} on the level of interest among investors, which is defined by current market conditions and also the track record of previous funds raised by the firm in question. Firms can spend as little as one or two months raising capital when they are able to reach the target that they set for their funds relatively easily, often through gaining commitments from existing investors in their previous funds, or where strong past performance leads to strong levels of investor interest. Other managers may find fundraising taking considerably longer, with managers of less popular fund types (such as US and European venture fund managers in <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>climate)</b> finding the fundraising process more tough. It is not unheard of for funds to spend as long as two years on the road seeking capital, although the majority of fund managers will complete fundraising within nine months to fifteen months.|$|E
25|$|El Paraíso is {{situated}} {{near the mouth}} of the Chillón River Valley and is 2km from the Pacific Ocean. The temperature averages at 70°F ranging from 55°F to 90°F. El Paraíso is a river valley, which provides rich resources and is surrounded by barren desert land. There is a large flood plain near the site, which supports the growth of cotton fields. The Pacific Ocean brings the Humboldt Current through, creating rich and diverse marine life as well as lush tropical vegetation. The Humboldt Current most likely provided an extremely important food source before the advent of agriculture on the coast. Due to the lack of geologic and climatic evidence, it is assumed that <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>climate</b> on the Peru Coast is much {{the same as it was}} 4–5000 years ago. Studies conducted by Reitz et al. found mollusc remains which indicated at least two major El Niño events took place during the occupation of El Paraíso. El Niño would have affected the abundance, diversity and species composition of available resources. Most likely, El Niño only affected two separate human life-times and there is evidence that people subsisted from remaining marine life and the lush vegetation which El Niño brings to desert lands.|$|E

25|$|Current {{predictions}} {{based on}} the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report 2007 say that Climate Change might impact the countries closer to the equator more seriously than the countries located more in the North or South. Tropical Vietnam {{is assumed to be}} one of the most vulnerable countries in connection with Climate Change. The medium emission level scenario for 2080-2099 predicts a higher annual rainfall which occurs in the already wet months of the year. At the same time, the dry months might become even hotter due to temperature rise and the stress on the crops might increase due to higher evaporation rates and less available water. Like <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>climate</b> differs both in time and in space, also the changing climate is predicted to affect rather the North than the South and it might influence rather the winter than the summer months. Beneath rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns, sea level rise is predicted to affect Vietnam as a country with a coastal line of more than 3,000km especially. The loss of land and soils due to flooding and inundation might lead to a loss of 5% of the total land seriously affecting agriculture, industry, human and natural environment. Salt water intrusion and salinisation of soils and irrigation water (either groundwater or surface water of other water bodies) are predicted to cause serious problems in connection with sea level rise as well.|$|E

500|$|The {{semiarid}} {{climate of}} Wyoming still manages to support {{about a dozen}} small glaciers within Grand Teton National Park, which all show evidence of retreat over the past 50 years. Schoolroom Glacier is located slightly southwest of Grand Teton {{is one of the}} more easily reached glaciers in the park and it is expected to disappear by 2025. [...] Research between 1950 and 1999 demonstrated that the glaciers in Bridger-Teton National Forest and Shoshone National Forest in the Wind River Range shrank by over a third of their size during that period. Photographs indicate that the glaciers today are only half the size as when first photographed in the late 1890s. Research also indicates that the glacial retreat was proportionately greater in the 1990s than in any other decade over the last 100 years. Gannett Glacier on the northeast slope of Gannett Peak is the largest single glacier in the Rocky Mountains south of Canada. It has reportedly lost over 50% of its volume since 1920, with almost half of that loss occurring since 1980. Glaciologists believe the remaining glaciers in Wyoming will disappear by the middle of the 21st century if <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>climate</b> patterns continue.|$|E

2500|$|A {{specially}} interesting climatic {{change during}} glacial times {{has taken place}} in the semi-arid Andes. Beside the expected cooling down in comparison with <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>climate,</b> a significant precipitation change happened here. So, researches in the presently semiarid subtropic Aconcagua-massif (6,962m) have shown an unexpectedly extensive glacial glaciation of the type [...] "ice stream network". The connected valley glaciers exceeding 100km in length, flowed down on the East-side of this section of the Andes at 32–34°S and 69–71°W as far as a height of 2,060m and on the western luff-side still clearly deeper. Where current glaciers scarcely reach 10km in length, the snowline (ELA) runs at a height of 4,600m and at that time was lowered to 3,200m asl, i.e. about 1,400m. From this follows that—beside of an annual depression of temperature about c. 8.4°C— here was an increase in precipitation. Accordingly, at glacial times the humid climatic belt that today is situated several latitude degrees further to the S, was shifted much further to the N.|$|E
2500|$|A {{unimodal}} approach dominated {{scientific literature}} until {{the beginning of}} this century. Although this enabled rapid progression of neural mapping, and an improved understanding of neural structures, the investigation of perception remained relatively stagnant, with a few exceptions. [...] The recent revitalized enthusiasm into perceptual research is indicative of a substantial shift away from reductionism and toward gestalt methodologies. Gestalt theory, dominant in the late 19th and early 20th centuries espoused two general principles: the 'principle of totality' in which conscious experience must be considered globally, and the 'principle of psychophysical isomorphism' which states that perceptual phenomena are correlated with cerebral activity. Just these ideas were already applied by Justo Gonzalo in his work of brain dynamics, where a sensory-cerebral correspondence is considered in the formulation of the [...] "development of the sensory field due to a psychophysical isomorphism" [...] (pag. 23 of the English translation of ref.). [...] Both ideas 'principle of totality' and 'psychophysical isomorphism' are particularly relevant in <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>climate</b> and have driven researchers to investigate the behavioural benefits of multisensory integration.|$|E
