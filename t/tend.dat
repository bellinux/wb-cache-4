5|$|Securely {{attached}} adults <b>tend</b> to {{have positive}} views of themselves, their partners and their relationships. They {{feel comfortable with}} intimacy and independence, balancing the two. Anxious-preoccupied adults seek high levels of intimacy, approval and responsiveness from partners, becoming overly dependent. They <b>tend</b> to be less trusting, have less positive views about themselves and their partners, and may exhibit high levels of emotional expressiveness, worry and impulsiveness in their relationships. Dismissive-avoidant adults desire {{a high level of}} independence, often appearing to avoid attachment altogether. They view themselves as self-sufficient, invulnerable to attachment feelings and not needing close relationships. They <b>tend</b> to suppress their feelings, dealing with rejection by distancing themselves from partners of whom they often have a poor opinion. Fearful-avoidant adults have mixed feelings about close relationships, both desiring and feeling uncomfortable with emotional closeness. They <b>tend</b> to mistrust their partners and view themselves as unworthy. Like dismissive-avoidant adults, fearful-avoidant adults <b>tend</b> to seek less intimacy, suppressing their feelings.|$|E

40|$|Due {{to their}} {{image-based}} nature, "contextual" approaches are very attractive to estimate evapotranspiration (ET) from remotely-sensed land surface temperature (LST) data. Their application is however limited to highly heterogeneous {{areas where the}} soil and vegetation temperature endmembers (<b>Tends)</b> can be observed at the thermal sensor resolution. This paper aims to develop a simple theoretical approach to estimate <b>Tends</b> independently from LST images. Soil <b>Tends</b> are simulated by a soil energy balance model forced by meteorological data. Vegetation <b>Tends</b> are obtained from soil <b>Tends</b> and air temperature. Model-derived soil <b>Tends</b> are first evaluated with in situ measurements made over an irrigated area in Morocco. The root mean square difference (RMSD) between modeled and ground-based soil <b>Tends</b> is estimated as 2. 4 [GRAPHICS] C. Model-derived soil <b>Tends</b> are next compared with the soil <b>Tends</b> retrieved from 90 -m resolution ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) data collected over two irrigated areas in Mexico and Spain. Such a comparison reveals a strong consistency between model-derived and high-resolution image-based soil <b>Tends.</b> A recent contextual ET model (SEB- 1 S) is then applied to 90 -m resolution and to 1 -km resolution (aggregated) ASTER data using the model-derived or image-based <b>Tends</b> as the input. The RMSD between 90 -m resolution SEB- 1 S and in situ ET is estimated as 65 and 82 W center dot m [GRAPHICS], and the RMSD between 1 -km resolution SEB- 1 S and aggregated SEB- 1 S ET is estimated as 78 and 56 W center dot m [GRAPHICS] for the image-based and model-derived <b>Tends,</b> respectively. In light of the above results, <b>Tends</b> should be estimated a priori when contextual models are applied to low resolution images. Moreover, the consistency over highly heterogeneous areas between model-derived and high-resolution image-based <b>Tends</b> provides a meaningful basis for developing mixed modeling observational approaches...|$|R

5|$|As for all metals, {{molecular}} {{compounds and}} polyatomic ions of cobalt {{are classified as}} coordination complexes, that is, molecules or ions that contain cobalt linked to several ligands. The principles of electronegativity and hardness–softness {{of a series of}} ligands can be used to explain the usual oxidation state of cobalt. For example, Co+3 complexes <b>tend</b> to have ammine ligands. Because phosphorus is softer than nitrogen, phosphine ligands <b>tend</b> to feature the softer Co2+ and Co+, an example being tris(triphenylphosphine)cobalt(I) chloride ((P(C6H5)3)3CoCl). The more electronegative (and harder) oxide and fluoride can stabilize Co4+ and Co5+ derivatives, e.g. caesium hexafluorocobaltate (Cs2CoF6) and potassium percobaltate (K3CoO4).|$|E

5|$|Given these {{properties}} of DNA damage and mutation, {{it can be}} seen that DNA damage is a special problem in non-dividing or slowly-dividing cells, where unrepaired damage will <b>tend</b> to accumulate over time. On the other hand, in rapidly-dividing cells, unrepaired DNA damage that does not kill the cell by blocking replication will <b>tend</b> to cause replication errors and thus mutation. The great majority of mutations that are not neutral in their effect are deleterious to a cell's survival. Thus, in a population of cells composing a tissue with replicating cells, mutant cells will <b>tend</b> to be lost. However, infrequent mutations that provide a survival advantage will <b>tend</b> to clonally expand at the expense of neighboring cells in the tissue. This advantage to the cell is disadvantageous to the whole organism, because such mutant cells can give rise to cancer. Thus, DNA damage in frequently dividing cells, because it gives rise to mutations, is a prominent cause of cancer. In contrast, DNA damage in infrequently-dividing cells is likely a prominent cause of aging.|$|E
