5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{required}} serpin, the protease that it {{normally would}} regulate is over-active, leading to pathologies.

Gene knockouts, particularly in mice, are used experimentally to determine the normal functions of serpins by the effect of their absence.|$|E

5|$|Lord Lane, then Lord Chief Justice of England, {{dismissed}} the applications on 13 December 1988, arguing of Raghip {{that the jury}} had had ample opportunity to form its own opinion of him.

5|$|Males mature {{at around}} 15years of age, {{by which time}} they have fully descended {{testicles}} and can reproduce. However, they exhibit arrested development by not developing the distinctive cheek pads, pronounced throat pouches, long fur, or long-calls until they are between 15 and 20years old.

5|$|The only {{species that}} can {{potentially}} {{be confused with}} the Siberian accentor is the related black-throated accentor, since first-autumn birds of the latter species may have a relatively inconspicuous dark throat.

5|$|Although the {{importance}} of 'joint' warfare had been highlighted during Second World War when Australian naval, ground and air units frequently served as part of single commands, <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> central authority continued to result in poor co-ordination between the services in the post-war era, with each organising and operating {{on the basis of}} a different military doctrine. The need for an integrated command structure received more emphasis during the Australian military's experiences in the Vietnam War. In 1973, the Secretary of the Department of Defence, Arthur Tange, submitted a report to the Government that recommended the unification of the separate departments supporting each service into a single department and the creation of the post of Chief of the Defence Force Staff.|$|E
5|$|As {{a test to}} see if his gubernatorial {{authority}} was still recognized, Taylor issued a pardon for a man convicted of manslaughter in Knott County. The pardon was signed by the proper county officials, but officers at the penitentiary refused to release the man. It was feared that Taylor would dispatch the state militia to remove the prisoner, but no further {{attempts were made to}} secure his release. Continuing to live under heavy guard in his executive office, Taylor was criticized for not having offered a reward for the capture of Goebel's unknown assailant. Responding that he was not authorized to make an offer in <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> request to do so by the officials in Franklin County, he offered a $500 reward from his own money.|$|E
5|$|Aureoboletus mirabilis {{differs from}} other boletes in the {{covering}} of the cap, which superficially resembles that {{found on the}} surface of Boletellus ananas and Strobilomyces strobilaceus, but the scales are more rigid with a somewhat conical shape. It can be distinguished from these two species by both its bay-brown color, and <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> veil. Both of the other species mentioned possess a conspicuous veil, and the former is tan to brown with a pinkish tint, while the latter is dark brown or black. Boletus edulis is separated from A.mirabilis by the color and texture of the cap, tubes and stem. Boletus coniferarum turns blue when bruised and has a very bitter taste. Aureoboletus projectellus is also similar in appearance to Aureoboletus mirabilis, but is found in eastern North America.|$|E
