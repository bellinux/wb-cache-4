2500|$|Following {{the opening}} sequence, Colbert most often {{proceeds}} with a run-through of recent headlines {{in a manner}} parodying traditional news broadcasts; {{this is similar to}} The Daily Show but with a faux-right-wing spin. The program typically continues with Colbert addressing a specific topic. Colbert often calls to [...] "Jimmy", a reference to program director Jim Hoskinson, to roll video clips. That topic will often lead into a [...] "The Word" [...] segment, which juxtaposes Colbert's commentary with satirical bullet points on-screen, a parody of <b>The</b> <b>O'Reilly</b> <b>Factors</b> [...] "Talking Points Memo". On occasion he will conduct a short interview with someone {{having to do with the}} topic. The format of the middle segment varies, but it is normally a visual presentation or skit. Often, these skits are parts of recurring segments, which may include [...] "Better Know a District", in which Colbert interviews a U.S. Representative from a certain district of the United States; [...] "Tip of the Hat/Wag of the Finger", in which Colbert voices his approval or disapproval of prominent people and news items; [...] "Cheating Death with Dr. Stephen T. Colbert, D.F.A.", a health segment; [...] "The Sport Report" [...] with the [...] "t" [...] in both Sport and Report silent, a sports segment; and [...] "The ThreatDown", in which Colbert lists the five greatest threats to America, and others. His newest segment, [...] "Thought for Food" [...] deals with the consumption of specific foods across the world.|$|R

5|$|In 2005, Colbert left The Daily Show {{to host a}} {{spin-off}} series entitled The Colbert Report, {{a parody}} of personality-driven political pundit programs such as Fox News's <b>The</b> <b>O'Reilly</b> <b>Factor</b> that center largely on the personal views of their hosts. Because of this enlarged role, the personality and beliefs of the Stephen Colbert character have become more clearly defined {{over the course of}} the show, complete with a fictitious backstory that has been revealed piecemeal in short monologues accompanying a part of the program.|$|E
25|$|Early in 2009, the show's ratings {{increase}}d. In July 2009, Hal Boedeker blogged that <b>The</b> <b>O'Reilly</b> <b>Factor</b> {{peaked at}} 3.1 million viewers {{which was an}} increase of 37% from the previous year. In September 2009, <b>The</b> <b>O'Reilly</b> <b>Factor</b> was the #1 cable news show for 106 consecutive weeks. In May 2014, <b>The</b> <b>O'Reilly</b> <b>Factor</b> still held this top position, but average monthly viewers were down to 2.1 million, with a median age of 72 years.

O'Reilly retorted by calling Hodges' claim an [...] "outrageous lie" [...] on <b>the</b> July 16 <b>O'Reilly</b> <b>Factor</b> [...] "Most Ridiculous Item of the Day." [...] Hodges responded with another column in the Salt Lake Tribune on July 21 titled, [...] "Perhaps I misunderstood O'Reilly's comments about murders," [...] http://www.newpilgrimbaptist.com/blog/?p=46 in which he argued that his statements were [...] "probably more accurately characterized as a misinterpretation rather than a lie." [...] On his July 23 show, O'Reilly again said that Hodges statements were a [...] "flat out lie." ...|$|R
50|$|Tape delay also {{refers to}} the process of {{broadcasting}} an event at a later scheduled time. This is because either a scheduling conflict prevents a live telecast, or a broadcaster seeks to maximize ratings by airing an event in a certain timeslot. This can also be done due to time constraints where certain portions (usually those that do not affect the outcome of the show) are edited out, or availability of hosts or other key production staff only at certain times of <b>the</b> day (e.g. <b>O'Reilly</b> <b>Factor</b> except during special events). For example, during the Sydney Olympics, daytime events were occurring at early morning hours in the Americas, Africa, and Europe, so some broadcasters showed high-profile events twice (live, then rebroadcast during prime time), while others withheld the same event to be broadcast solely during prime time. Sporting events aired on tape delay are often edited down for time considerations, highlighting what the broadcaster feels are the most interesting portions of the event, or advertising.|$|R
