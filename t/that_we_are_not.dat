It is necessary to investigate before legislating, but the line between investigating and persecuting is a very fine one, and the junior Senator from Wisconsin has stepped over it repeatedly. His primary achievement has been in confusing the public mind, as between the internal and the external threats of Communism. We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason, if we dig deep in our history and our doctrine, and remember <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> descended from fearful men—not from men who feared to write, to speak, to associate and to defend causes that were, for the moment, unpopular.|$|E

25|$|Kant {{cautions}} that we cannot feel or intuit {{this world of}} the understanding. He also stresses that {{we are unable to}} make interesting positive claims about it because we are not able to experience the world of the understanding. Kant argues that we cannot use the notion of the world of the understanding to explain how freedom is possible or how pure reason could {{have anything to say about}} practical matters because we simply do not and cannot have a clear enough grasp of the world of the understanding. The notion of an intelligible world does point us towards the idea of a kingdom of ends, which is a useful and important idea. We just have to be careful not to get carried away and make claims <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> entitled to.|$|E
25|$|A {{feature that}} distinguishes humans from most animals is <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> born with an {{extensive}} repertoire of behavioral programs {{that would enable}} us to survive on our own ("physiological prematurity"). To compensate for this, we have an unmatched ability to learn, i.e., to consciously acquire such programs by imitation or exploration. Once consciously acquired and sufficiently exercised, these programs can become automated {{to the extent that}} their execution happens beyond the realms of our awareness. Take, as an example, the incredible fine motor skills exerted in playing a Beethoven piano sonata or the sensorimotor coordination required to ride a motorcycle along a curvy mountain road. Such complex behaviors are possible only because a sufficient number of the subprograms involved can be executed with minimal or even suspended conscious control. In fact, the conscious system may actually interfere somewhat with these automated programs.|$|E
30|$|However, another {{possible}} explanation for our negative results {{with regard to the}} NO pathway can be that hyperoxia does influence NO bioavailability, but <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>not</b> able to detect it, since it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> possible to measure NO directly.|$|R

25|$|Bevin was unsentimental {{about the}} British Empire {{in places where}} the growth of {{nationalism}} had made direct rule no longer practicable, and {{was part of the}} Cabinet which approved a speedy British withdrawal from India in 1947, and from neighbouring colonies. Yet at this stage Britain still maintained a network of client states in the Middle East (Egypt until 1952, Iraq and Jordan until 1959), major bases in such places as Cyprus and Suez (until 1956) and expected to remain in control of parts of Africa for many more years, Bevin approving the construction of a huge new base in East Africa. Bevin wrote “we have the material resources in the Colonial Empire, if we develop them … which will show clearly <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> subservient to the United States … or to the Soviet Union”. In this era colonial exports earned $150m a year, mostly Malaysian rubber, West African cocoa, and sugar and sisal from the West Indies. By the end of 1948 colonial exports were 50% higher than before the war, whilst {{in the first half of}} 1948 colonial exports accounted for 10.4% of Britain’s imports. After the war Britain helped France and the Netherlands recover their Far Eastern empires, hopeful that this could lead towards the formation of a third superpower bloc. Bevin agreed with Duff Cooper (British Ambassador in Paris) that the Dunkirk Treaty would be a step in this direction and thought that Eden's objection – in 1944 when Cooper first proposed it – that such moves might alienate the Soviets no longer applied.|$|E
25|$|Surprisingly, gauge {{symmetry}} {{can give}} a deeper explanation {{for the existence of}} interactions, such as the electric and nuclear interactions. This arises from a type of gauge symmetry relating to the fact that all particles of a given type are experimentally indistinguishable from one another. Imagine that Alice and Betty are identical twins, labeled at birth by bracelets reading A and B. Because the girls are identical, nobody would be able to tell if they had been switched at birth; the labels A and B are arbitrary, and can be interchanged. Such a permanent interchanging of their identities is like a global gauge symmetry. There is also a corresponding local gauge symmetry, which describes the fact that from one moment to the next, Alice and Betty could swap roles while nobody was looking, and nobody would be able to tell. If we observe that Mom's favorite vase is broken, we can only infer that the blame belongs to one twin or the other, but we cannot tell whether the blame is 100% Alice's and 0% Betty's, or vice versa. If Alice and Betty are in fact quantum-mechanical particles rather than people, then they also have wave properties, including the property of superposition, which allows waves to be added, subtracted, and mixed arbitrarily. It follows <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> even restricted to complete swaps of identity. For example, if we observe that a certain amount of energy exists in a certain location in space, there is no experiment that can tell us whether that energy is 100% A's and 0% B's, 0% A's and 100% B's, or 20% A's and 80% B's, or some other mixture. The fact that the symmetry is local means that we cannot even count on these proportions to remain fixed as the particles propagate through space. The details of how this is represented mathematically depend on technical issues relating to the spins of the particles, but for our present purposes we consider a spinless particle, for which {{it turns out that the}} mixing can be specified by some arbitrary choice of gauge θ(x), where an angle θnbsp&=nbsp&0° represents 100% A and 0% B, θnbsp&=nbsp&90° means 0% A and 100% B, and intermediate angles represent mixtures.|$|E

500|$|On February 21, 2014, Mayor Harpole {{spoke about}} the refugee {{population}} in Amarillo. According to 2007-2012 State Department data from U.S. Representative Mac Thornberry, Amarillo received {{the highest number of}} refugees per capita than any other Texas city. According to Harpole, the city has struggled with accommodating a high number of foreign language speakers in areas like education and 911 response. Harpole told the Texas Tribune, [...] "We’ve raised some red flags and said this isn’t good for some entities in the city or for the refugees themselves". Many refugees worked in meatpacking plants in the area, but Harpole expressed concern that jobs were declining and believed [...] "it’s going to be more difficult for the refugees to do well" [...] in Amarillo. After requests from Harpole, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission agreed with various refugee resettlement organizations in late 2013 that new placements in Amarillo would be limited to family reunification. However, Harpole wished to make clear, [...] "We don’t want to get the idea out <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> supportive of refugees. We’ve been very accepting. But we also need to keep it in a ratio that's healthy for the refugees as well as the residents".|$|E

[...] He decided to center the series on the [...] "idea of this epic love story and then putting the genre back into it" [...] and layering elements such as mental illness and special abilities on that foundation Hawley's initial script for Legion was described by Donner as [...] "less fractured", [...] "cohesive [...] much more regular." [...] However, he quickly reconceived the series [...] "and decided more Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, Terrence Malick, more whimsy, more impressionistic and went in that direction." [...] This was in part due to Hawley's desire to depict a [...] "more existential exploration" [...] and a [...] "surreal or dreamlike quality where it's not just about running and kicking." [...] He was inspired by the works of David Lynch to have the series' structure reflect the content of the story. Explaining, Hawley noted that the series' protagonist [...] "doesn't know what's real and what’s not real, [...] the audience should have the same experience". Hawley added that [...] "there is this Alice in Wonderland quality to it, of a story within a story." [...] To acclimatize audiences to the different style of the series, taking into consideration that the show was given a late airtime and so [...] "it’s on {{at the end of their}} very long day", Hawley had several of the early episodes begin with a [...] "hypnotic quality ... often [...] a little ethereal voice-over, to give the sense <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> rooted in a physical time and place."
