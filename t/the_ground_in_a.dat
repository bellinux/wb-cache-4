5|$|Breeding occurs {{throughout}} the year on Saipan, where the species' nesting behaviour has been studied. The peak breeding period seems to be from March to July. The species is monogamous. The nests are simple undecorated cups of casuarina needles, grasses, and vines. These are placed around 2.9m (between 1.5 and 6.5m) off <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> variety of trees including Casuarina, Guamia, Cynometra, Leucaena, and Citrus. The nests are predated by other bird species, specifically Micronesian starlings and collared kingfishers, {{as well as the}} introduced green tree skink.|$|E
5|$|Harrya chromapes, {{commonly}} known as the yellowfoot bolete or the chrome-footed bolete, is species of bolete fungus in the family Boletaceae. The bolete is found in eastern North America, Costa Rica, and eastern Asia, where it grows on <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> mycorrhizal association with deciduous and coniferous trees. Fruit bodies have smooth, rose-pink caps that are initially convex before flattening out. The pores on the cap undersurface are white, aging to a pale pink as the spores mature. The thick stipe has fine pink or reddish dots (scabers), and is white to pinkish but with a bright yellow base. The mushrooms are edible but are popular with insects, and so they are often infested with maggots.|$|E
5|$|Similarly, {{powerful}} motorcycles {{can generate}} enough torque {{at the rear}} wheel to lift the front wheel off <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> maneuver called a wheelie. A line {{similar to the one}} described above to analyze braking performance can be drawn from the rear wheel contact patch to predict if a wheelie is possible given the available friction, the center of mass location, and sufficient power. This can also happen on bicycles, although there is much less power available, if the center of mass is back or up far enough or the rider lurches back when applying power to the pedals.|$|E

5|$|When cats become aggressive, {{they try}} to make {{themselves}} appear larger and more threatening by raising their fur, arching their backs, turning sideways and hissing or spitting. Often, the ears are pointed down and back to avoid damage to the inner ear and potentially listen for any changes behind them while focused forward. They may also vocalize loudly and bare their teeth in an effort to further intimidate their opponent. Fights usually consist of grappling and delivering powerful slaps to the face and body with the forepaws as well as bites. Cats also throw themselves to <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> defensive posture to rake their opponent's belly with their powerful hind legs.|$|E
5|$|Animals {{will use}} {{different}} gaits for different speeds, terrain and situations. For example, horses show four natural gaits, the slowest horse gait is the walk, {{then there are}} three faster gaits which, from slowest to fastest, are the trot, the canter and the gallop. Animals may also have unusual gaits that are used occasionally, such as for moving sideways or backwards. For example, the main human gaits are bipedal walking and running, but they employ many other gaits occasionally, including a four-legged crawl in tight spaces. Mammals show a vast range of gaits, the order that they place and lift their appendages in locomotion. Gaits can be grouped into categories according to their patterns of support sequence. For quadrupeds, there are three main categories: walking gaits, running gaits and leaping gaits. Walking {{is the most common}} gait, where some feet are on the ground at any given time, and found in almost all legged animals. Running is considered to occur when at some points in the stride all feet are off <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> moment of suspension.|$|E
5|$|Hardy met {{his girlfriend}} Beth Britt in 1999, {{shortly after the}} Hardy Boyz had won the WWF Tag Team Championship for the first time.

Hardy and his girlfriend were not home at the time, but his dog, Jack, was killed in the fire. It is believed that the fire was started by faulty electrical wiring. In October 2008, Hardy was building a new home in the same area, which was expected to be completed by early 2009. In August 2010, Hardy announced that Britt was pregnant with the couple's first child, a daughter named Ruby Claire Hardy, who was born on October 19, 2010. The pair's second child, a daughter, Nera Quinn Hardy, was born on December 31, 2015. Hardy married Britt on March 9, 2011.|$|E

5|$|In October 2009, Mike Ashley {{announced}} {{that he planned to}} lease the name of <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bid to increase revenue, and in November the stadium was temporarily renamed sportsdirect.com @ St James' Park Stadium. This name was only supposed to be used {{until the end of the}} 2009–10 season, but lasted until November 2011. On 10 November 2011, the club officially changed the name of the stadium to the Sports Direct Arena, although this will most likely be an interim name, as it is only being used to showcase the sponsorship capabilities of the stadium. The company, owned by Ashley, were not paying anything for the deal. However, if another company purchases the naming rights, they will be expected to pay between £8 million and £10 million. Many fans voiced their anger at the renaming, but Managing Director Derek Llambias has said that it was necessary to give Newcastle extra money so that they compete with the bigger clubs in the league.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, on the Union right, Lew Wallace {{formed an}} attacking column with three brigades—one {{from his own}} division, one from McClernand's, and one from Smith's—to try {{to regain control of}} ground lost in the battle that morning. Wallace's old brigade (11th Indiana and 8th Missouri), now {{commanded}} by Col. Morgan. Wall L. Smith, and others from McClernand's and Wallace's divisions were chosen to lead the attack. The brigades of Cruft (Wallace's Division) and Leonard F. Ross (McClernand's Division) were placed in support on the flanks. Wallace ordered the attack forward. Smith, the 8th Missouri, and the 11th Indiana advanced a short distance up the hill using Zouave tactics, where the men repeatedly rushed and then fell to <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> prone position. By 5:30p.m. Wallace's troops had succeeded in retaking the ground lost that morning, and by nightfall, the Confederate troops had been driven back to their original positions. Grant began plans to resume his assault in the morning, although neglecting to close the escape route that Pillow had opened.|$|E
5|$|Resuming for New South Wales in 1952–53, Barnes scored 152 against Victoria in {{the last}} match before the {{beginning}} of the Test series against South Africa. Nevertheless, the selectors overlooked him for the first Test and in the following state match, against South Australia at the Adelaide Oval, Barnes offered to act as twelfth man to provide an opportunity for a younger player, Ray Flockton. During a drinks break {{on the second day of}} the match, he appeared on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> suit and tie, (rather than 'whites') carrying superfluous items such as cigars, iced towels, a mirror and comb, a radio and a clothes brush. The crowd initially responded well to the joke, but their mood soured when the interval extended beyond its scheduled time and Barnes received criticism for delaying the game. The South Australian team, captained by Australian selector Phil Ridings, officially complained to the New South Wales Cricket Association (NSWCA), which asked Barnes to express regret over the incident. Despite the association's support for Barnes during his problems of the previous season, he prevaricated. Eventually, the NSWCA forwarded a written apology on his behalf.|$|E

5|$|The {{establishment}} of the Kalacoon research station enabled Beebe to research {{the ecology of the}} surrounding jungle in far more detail than had been possible during his earlier expeditions. Using Kalacoon as his base of operations, Beebe performed a novel type of study: methodically dissecting a small area of jungle, and all of the animals which inhabit it, {{from the top of the}} canopy to below <b>the</b> <b>ground.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> second study, Beebe performed the same task for a much larger area of jungle, approximately a quarter mile (0.4km) square. During his first season at Kalacoon in 1916, Beebe brought back 300 living specimens for the zoo. This time he succeeded at capturing a hoatzin, the bird that he had narrowly missed during his earlier trip to Guiana, although he was unable to keep it alive for the zoo during the trip back to New York.|$|E
5|$|Another steep climb of 800 feet {{brought us}} to the Marei Parei spur, {{to the spot where}} the ground was covered with the {{magnificent}} pitcher-plants, of which we had come in search. This one has been called the Nepenthes Rajah, and is a plant about four feet in length, with broad leaves stretching on every side, having the great pitchers resting on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> circle about it. Their shape and size are remarkable. I will give the measurement of one, to indicate the form: the length along the back nearly fourteen inches; from the base {{to the top of the}} column in front, five inches; and its lid a foot long by fourteen inches broad, and of an oval shape. Its mouth was surrounded by a plaited pile, which near the column was two inches broad, lessening in its narrowest part to three-quarters of an inch. The plaited pile of the mouth was also undulating in broad waves. Near the stem the pitcher is four inches deep, so that the mouth is situated upon it in a triangular manner. The colour of an old chalice is a deep purple, but that of the others is generally mauve outside, very dark indeed in the lower part, though lighter towards the rim; the inside is of the same colour, but has a kind of glazed and shiny appearance. The lid is mauve in the centre, shading to green at the edges. The stems of the female flowers we found always a foot shorter than those of the male, and the former were far less numerous than the latter. It is indeed one of the most astonishing productions of nature.|$|E
