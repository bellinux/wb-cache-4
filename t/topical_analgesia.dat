40|$|Factors {{affecting}} catecholamine {{levels in}} vitro were studied using the modified high pressure liquid chromatography method with electrochemical detection. Differential centrifugation showed that platelet-rich plasma contained significantly higher catecholamine levels than platelet-poor plasma. Serum samples {{had significantly higher}} catecholamine levels than plasma. Plasma or serum samples clotted with glass beads had significantly higher catecholamine levels than those without. Therefore, consistent results can only be obtained when catecholamine samples are spun at the same speed, either plasma or serum can be used, but not both in a single study. Post-dated blood for transfusion was used to study stability of catecholamines, and showed that catecholamines are stable. Hence, the collection of blood samples for catecholamine measurements was modified. Blood samples were collected in Vacutainer tubes containing lithium heparin without antioxidants and not pre-cooled, samples were spun at the convenient time. This was welcomed by the clinicians {{who did not have}} to interrupt clinical assessment to care for blood samples as with the former method. The three clinical studies showed no significant differences in catecholamine levels in patients undergoing laryngoscopy with and without tracheal intubation, whether or not the patients were beta blocked or had received <b>topical</b> tracheal <b>analgesia.</b> The mean catecholamine levels were within the normal range. No relationships between baseline catecholamine levels and the baseline blood pressures or heart rate nor between the changes in catecholamine levels from the baseline and the corresponding changes in blood pressures or heart rate. The Injury Severity Score in minor injured patients had no relationship with plasma catecholamine levels, and no significant rise in noradrenaline levels when the ISS< 30 and adrenaline levels when the ISS< 17.

40|$|Purpose: Neonatal pain {{management}} {{has made a}} great step forward {{over the last several}} years. Despite the drafting of International guidelines, an under-treatment of neonatal pain is still reported. Materials and methods: Medical and paramedical personnel working in five Italian NICUs were asked to complete a questionnaire about {{pain management}}. The questionnaire was comprised of three sections: (i) brief explanation of the purpose; (ii) demographic information, including age, profession, religious beliefs, and hospital level; (iii) questionnaire about pain management and prevention. Results: One-hundred and forty caregivers participated in this study. Non-pharmacological analgesia during heel prick or venipuncture was used by 64 % and 60 % of them, respectively; <b>topical</b> <b>analgesia</b> was performed in 13 % of venipunctures; no analgesia was used in 30 % of cases for both heel prick and venipuncture. In the case of lumbar puncture, 35 % of participants used <b>topical</b> <b>analgesia,</b> 15 % non-pharmacological approach, 10 % opioids, and 6 % intravenous paracetamol. While 65 % of participants gave a score of 4 out of 5 about the importance of pain treatment, 39 % of them reported that in their department no pain scales were used. Conclusions: Pain treatment in these NICUs is still far to be optimal. This nonetheless reflects a worldwide trend, which requires more attention on pain prevention, assessment, and treatment...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To measure colloid osmotic {{pressure}} in interstitial fluid (COPi) from human subcutaneous tissue with the modified wick technique {{in order to}} determine influence of topical application of anaesthetics, dry vs. wet wick and implantation time on COPi. Material and Methods: In 50 healthy volunteers interstitial fluid (IF) was collected by subcutaneous implantation of multi-filamentous nylon wicks. Study subjects were allocated to two groups; one for comparing COPi obtained from dry and saline soaked wicks, and one for comparing COPi from unanaesthetized skin, and skin after application of a eutectic mixture of local anaesthetic (EMLA®, Astra Zeneca) cream. IF was sampled from the skin of the shoulders, and implantation time was 30, 60, 75, 90 and 120 min. Colloid {{osmotic pressure}} was measured with a colloid osmometer. Pain assessment during the procedure was compared for EMLA cream and no topical anaesthesia using a visual analogue scale (VAS) in a subgroup of 10 subjects. Results: There {{were no significant differences between}} COPi obtained from dry compared to wet wicks, except that the values after 75 and 90 min. were somewhat higher for the dry wicks. Topical anaesthesia with EMLA cream did not affect COPi values. COPi decreased from 30 to 75 min. of implantation (23. 2 ± 4. 4 mmHg to 19. 6 ± 2. 9 mmHg, p = 0. 008) and subsequently tended to increase until 120 min. EMLA cream resulted in significant lower VAS score for the procedure. Conclusion: COPi from subcutaneous tissue was easily obtained and fluid harvesting was well tolerated when topical anaesthetic was used. The difference in COPi assessed by dry and wet wicks between 75 min. and 90 min. of implantation was in accordance with previous reports. The use of <b>topical</b> <b>analgesia</b> did not influence COPi and <b>topical</b> <b>analgesia</b> may make the wick technique more acceptable for subjects who dislike technical procedures, including children. </p...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: It {{is unclear}} whether local {{anesthetic}} eye drops can be safely used for the topical anesthesia of patients with minor corneal injury who are discharged from the emergency department (ED). OBJECTIVES: To assess whether topical 0. 4 % amethocaine self-administered to a maximum recommended frequency of once every hour for 36 - 48 h is safe {{in the management of}} uncomplicated corneal injury in patients discharged from the ED. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A pilot randomized double-blinded trial comparing topical 0. 4 % amethocaine with topical normal saline. RESULTS: Forty-seven subjects were recruited, with 22 randomized to receive amethocaine and 25 to receive placebo (normal saline). Baseline characteristics, including corneal injury type, were similar in both groups. There were no significant functional or clinical adverse sequelae in the majority of enrolled patients who could be contacted at 2 weeks (17 / 22 for amethocaine and 21 / 25 for placebo). Follow-up for the primary study outcome was suboptimal, with only 7 / 22 from the amethocaine group and 9 / 25 from the saline group presenting for 36 - 48 h review; there was a statistically nonsignificant trend for persistence of the corneal defect in the amethocaine group as compared with the saline group (2 / 7 and 1 / 9, respectively). CONCLUSION: Compared with saline drops, amethocaine eye drops are not definitely safe but they are effective for <b>topical</b> <b>analgesia</b> in minor corneal injury. Until further definitive studies, topical nonsteroidal agents or long-lasting artificial tears may be preferred for the <b>topical</b> <b>analgesia</b> of minor corneal injury.

40|$|AbstractMild {{knee pain}} {{is a common}} symptom in later life. Despite this fact, there are few data {{on the impact of}} it {{worsening}} or how individuals alter their appraisals and behavior when it becomes severe. We sought to describe the changes that accompany a substantial deterioration in characteristic knee pain. A nested case-control analysis of existing cohort data identified 57 adults aged over 50 years experiencing progression from mild to severe characteristic pain intensity 18 months later and compared them, before and after this transition, with 228 controls whose knee pain did not progress. Worsening knee pain was accompanied by a marked increase in pain frequency and extent, functional limitation, depressive symptoms, catastrophising, praying and hoping, and use of oral and <b>topical</b> <b>analgesia.</b> Most individuals consulted a general practitioner either during or after this episode. Although relatively rare, substantial deterioration in knee pain has a major impact on those affected. Timely presentation to primary care, addressing potentially unhelpful appraisals and coping strategies, reinforcing core nonpharmacological management, and future research to identify triggering events for substantial deterioration and loss of adequate pain control should be part of an agenda to improve care for this important minority of older adults with knee pain.

40|$|Background Acute {{otitis media}} (AOM) is a spontaneously remitting disease for which pain {{is the most}} {{distressing}} symptom. Antibiotics are now known to have less benefit than previously assumed. Objectives To assess the effectiveness of <b>topical</b> <b>analgesia</b> for AOM. Search strategy We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) (The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2006), MEDLINE (1966 to May Week 3 2006), EMBASE (1990 to December 2005) and LILACS (1982 to September 2005) without language restriction, and the reference lists of articles. We also contacted manufacturers and authors. Selection criteria Double-blind randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials comparing an otic preparation with an analgesic effect (excluding antibiotics) versus placebo or an otic preparation with an analgesic effect (excluding antibiotics) versus any other otic preparation with an analgesic effect, in adults or children presenting at primary care settings with AOM without perforation.

40|$|Superficial vein {{thrombosis}} {{is characterized by}} clotting of superficial veins (ie, following direct trauma) with minimal inflammatory components. Superficial thrombophlebitis is a minimally thrombotic process of superficial veins associated with inflammatory changes and/or infection. Treatments generally include analgesics, elastic compression, anti-inflammatory agents, exercise and ambulation, and, in some cases, local or systemic anticoagulants. It is better to avoid bed rest and reduced mobility. <b>Topical</b> <b>analgesia</b> with nonsteroidal, anti-inflammatory creams applied locally to the superficial {{vein thrombosis}}/superficial thrombophlebitis area controls symptoms. Hirudoid cream (heparinoid) shortens the duration of signs/symptoms. Locally acting anticoagulants/antithrombotics (Viatromb®, Lipohep®, spray Na-heparin) have positive effects on pain and on the reduction in thrombus size. Intravenous catheters should be changed every 24 to 48 hours (depending on venous flow and clinical parameters) to prevent superficial vein thrombosis/superficial thrombophlebitis and removed in case of events.

The duration of postoperative analgesia, pain scores, rescue analgesic consumption, sedation score, hemodynamic monitoring, and side-effects were evaluated 48 h postoperative. Results: Kaplan–Meier survival analysis of analgesia free time demonstrated a significant advantage of topical ketamine (TK) group over caudal ketamine (CK) group. The duration of postoperative analgesia was longer in TK group than in CK group (28. 74 ± 2. 88 vs. 21. 43 ± 5. 01 h, P < 0. 000). Fewer children asked for oral analgesics in the topical group (24 of 36, 66. 7 %) than in the caudal one (28 of 32, 87. 5 %; P < 0. 01).

40|$|Background: A {{proportion}} of patients undergoing laparoscopic gynecological surgery experiences excessive post-operative pain, {{which results in}} high rescue analgesic treatment and prolonged hospitalization. The aim of our study was to evaluate the efficacy of intraoperative topical ropivacaine in the control of post-operative pain in the first 48 h after operative laparoscopy for benign adnexal or uterine pathologies. Methods: We conducted a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. Patients received a standard dose of topical ropivacaine (injected at the three portal sites and atomized in the abdominal cavity) or placebo. The primary outcome was the evaluation of post-operative pain intensity 6 h after surgery. Secondary outcomes included the intensity of pain during the 48 h after surgery, shoulder tip pain and the request for rescue analgesics during the first 48 h after surgery, time to discharge from recovery room, time to mobilizing on the ward and time to return to daily activities. Patients were divided in two groups (Group_A: benign adnexal pathologies; Group_B: benign uterine diseases) and assigned to Subgroup_ 1 (receiving ropivacaine) and Subgroup_ 2 (receiving placebo). Results: A total of 187 women were included: 93 in Group_A and 94 in Group_B. Forty-seven patients entered Subgroup_A 1, 46 Subgroup_A 2, 48 Subgroup_B 1 and 46 Subgroup_B 2. Subgroup_A 1 experienced lower post-operative pain at 4 (p = 0. 008) and 6 h (p = 0. 001) {{as well as a}} faster return to daily activities (p = 0. 01) in comparison with Subgroup_A 2. Both Subgroup_A 1 and Subgroup_B 1 showed lower shoulder tip pain (respectively, p = 0. 032 and p = 0. 001) as well as shorter time to mobilizing on the ward after surgery (respectively, p = 0. 001 and p = 0. 01). The remaining variables analysis did not show significant results. Conclusions: Combined <b>topical</b> <b>analgesia</b> with ropivacaine could represent a new safe and effective tool in the control of post-operative pain in gynecological laparoscopic surgery. Given the greater benefits for adnexal surgery, this strategy may be more suitable for this class of patients...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Functional MRI in rats under {{anesthesia}} can largely minimize motion {{artifacts and}} attenuate {{the stress of}} the animal. However, two issues remain to be clarified and improved. First, fMRI results obtained with different anesthesia during surgical preparation and imaging show a large variability, which could be caused by the variable stress level of the rodents. Second, the most common surgical procedure used for anesthesia, blood gas analysis and mean arterial blood-pressure (MABP) monitoring is the femoral vein and artery catheterization that makes longitudinal studies difficult. Methods In order to examine the variability of the stress level with three different anesthesia protocols using isoflurane (Iso), medetomidine-ketamine (MK) or propofol-remifentanil (PR), we measured the plasma corticosterone (CORT) concentration with 125 I-radioimmunoassay in blood samples collected prior to, immediately after and 60 min after surgery. Tail-artery and vein catheterization was adapted for long-term monitoring of MABP with periodic blood sampling and is proposed as a less invasive and technically simple alternative to femoral vessel catheterization in fMRI preparation protocols. Results We show that the CORT concentration depends on the anesthesia protocol with both alternatives providing more efficient stress reduction than the protocol using Iso. However, only the protocol using PR achieved a significant hormone reduction during surgery. Stress was not reliably manifested in changes in heart-rate and breathing-rate. Anesthesia and strain related changes in these two physiological parameters may be assigned to the pharmacological effects of the premedication and anesthetic agents. The results indicate also that MABP can be monitored {{over a long period of}} time (e. g. functional imaging session) through an arterial access point in the rat tail after cannulation with the proposed procedure. Discussion and conclusion Animals can experience stress during fMRI preparation protocols without obvious signs in commonly monitored physiological parameters. Our results challenge the efficiency of surgical protocols using Iso as mono-anesthetic agent, even when extended with <b>topical</b> <b>analgesia.</b> It was demonstrated that the CORT-based stress-level measurement through tail-artery cannulation can be used for developing anesthesia protocols (i. e. the presented PR protocol) when setting up future fMRI studies. The proposed surgical method for the tail is expected to facilitate longitudinal fMRI studies with permanent arterial access...|$|E
