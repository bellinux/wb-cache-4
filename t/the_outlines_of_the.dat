5|$|Interpretations {{of other}} {{features}} of Opabinia fossils differ. Since the animals {{did not have}} mineralized armor nor even tough organic exoskeletons like those of insects, their bodies were flattened as they were buried and fossilized, and smaller or internal features appear as markings within <b>the</b> <b>outlines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fossils.|$|E
5|$|The small {{fields in}} the western part of the area are {{particularly}} characteristic of the Chew Valley and date back to the most evident period of enclosure of earlier open fields which took place in the late medieval period. Fields of this category are generally small in size, regular in outline and often the boundaries preserve <b>the</b> <b>outlines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> earlier strip field system. Regional variations in field size and pattern do occur. For example, there is evidence of medieval clearance of woodland on the slopes around Nempnett Thrubwell, south of Bishop Sutton and west and south of Chelwood.|$|E
5|$|Knowledge of {{the fossil}} record {{continued}} to advance rapidly {{during the first few}} decades of the 19th century. By the 1840s, <b>the</b> <b>outlines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> geologic timescale were becoming clear, and in 1841 John Phillips named three major eras, based on the predominant fauna of each: the Paleozoic, dominated by marine invertebrates and fish, the Mesozoic, the age of reptiles, and the current Cenozoic age of mammals. This progressive picture of the history of life was accepted even by conservative English geologists like Adam Sedgwick and William Buckland; however, like Cuvier, they attributed the progression to repeated catastrophic episodes of extinction followed by new episodes of creation. Unlike Cuvier, Buckland and some other advocates of natural theology among British geologists made efforts to explicitly link the last catastrophic episode proposed by Cuvier to the biblical flood.|$|E

5|$|Stigwood and Russell {{decided to}} hold auditions with the eight actresses portraying Eva in the musical's {{worldwide}} productions, with an undisclosed number performing screen tests in New York and London. In November 1981, Russell continued holding screen tests at Elstree Studios. Karla DeVito {{was among those who}} auditioned for the role of Eva. Russell also travelled to London, where he screen tested Liza Minnelli wearing a blonde wig and custom-period gowns. He felt that Minnelli, a more established film actress, would be better suited for the role, but Rice, Stigwood and Paramount wanted Elaine Paige, the first actress to play Eva in the London stage production. Russell began working on his own screenplay without Stigwood, Rice or Lloyd Webber's approval. His script followed <b>the</b> <b>outlines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stage production, but established the character of Ché as a newspaper reporter. The script also contained a hospital montage for Eva and Ché, in which they pass each other on gurneys in white corridors as she is being treated for cancer, while Ché is beaten and injured by rioters. Russell was ultimately fired from the project after telling Stigwood he would not do the film without Minnelli.|$|E

25|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, {{historian}} and philosopher Martin Grabmann was the first scholar to work out <b>the</b> <b>outlines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ongoing development of thought in scholasticism and to see in Thomas Aquinas a response and development of thought rather than a single, coherently emerged and organic whole. Although Grabmann's works in German are numerous, only Thomas Aquinas (1928) is available in English. However, Grabmann's thought was instrumental in the whole modern understanding of scholasticism and the pivotal role of Aquinas.|$|E

25|$|The last of {{the four}} films Fassbinder shot in 1969, was his first in color, Why Does Herr R. Run Amok? (Warum läuft Herr R. Amok?).

Only <b>the</b> <b>outlines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scenes were sketched by Fassbinder. Fengler and the cast then improvised the dialogue. Fassbinder asserted that this was really Fengler's work rather than his. Nevertheless, the two were jointly given a directorial award for the project in the 1971 German Film prize competition and Why Does Herr R. Run Amok? has always been considered among Fassbinder's films.|$|E
25|$|The {{legend of}} the {{founding}} of the city of Puebla attributes the act to a vision had by friar Julián Garcés, who became the first bishop of Puebla. The legend states that while praying, the friar fell asleep, when he dreamed of a festival in honor the Archangel Michael happening in a place with leafy trees and a crystal clear river, flowing from springs. As the contemplated the scenery, angels descended from heaven and traced <b>the</b> <b>outlines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city to be built. When he awake he drew what he had seen, deciding he had had a divine vision. He communicated the dream to other Franciscans and found the place he saw five days later.|$|E

25|$|Soft tissue {{remains of}} plesiosaurs are rare, but sometimes, {{especially}} in shale deposits, {{they have been}} partly preserved, e.g. showing <b>the</b> <b>outlines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body. An early discovery in this respect was the holotype of Plesiosaurus conybeari (presently Attenborosaurus). From such finds {{it is known that}} the skin was smooth, without apparent scales but with small wrinkles, that the trailing edge of the flippers extended considerably behind the limb bones; and that the tail bore a vertical fin, as reported by Wilhelm Dames in his description of Plesiosaurus guilelmiimperatoris (presently Seeleyosaurus). The possibility of a tail fluke has been confirmed by recent studies on the caudal neural spine form of Pantosaurus, Cryptoclidus and Rhomaleosaurus zetlandicus.|$|E
25|$|Red figure is, put simply, {{the reverse}} of the black figure technique. Both were {{achieved}} by using the three-phase firing technique. The paintings were applied to the shaped but unfired vessels after they had dried to a leathery, near-brittle texture. In Attica, the normal unburnt clay was of orange colour at this stage. <b>The</b> <b>outlines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intended figures were drawn either with a blunt scraper, leaving a slight groove, or with charcoal, which would disappear entirely during firing. Then the contours were redrawn with a brush, using a glossy clay slip. Occasionally, the painter decided to somewhat change the figurative scene. In such cases the grooves from the original sketch sometimes remain visible. Important contours were often drawn with a thicker slip, leading to a slightly protruding outline (relief line); less important lines and internal details were drawn with diluted glossy clay.|$|E
25|$|By {{the early}} 1960s, Nuckolls {{and several other}} weapons {{designers}} had developed <b>the</b> <b>outlines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ICF approach. The D-T fuel would {{be placed in a}} small capsule, designed to rapidly ablate when heated and thereby maximize compression and shock wave formation. This capsule would be placed within an engineered shell, the hohlraum, which acted similar to the bomb casing. However, the hohlraum {{did not have to be}} heated by x-rays; any source of energy could be used as long as it delivered enough energy to cause the hohlraum itself to heat up and start giving off x-rays. Ideally the energy source would be located some distance away, to mechanically isolate both ends of the reaction. A small atomic bomb could be used as the energy source, as it is in a hydrogen bomb, but ideally smaller energy sources would be used. Using computer simulations, the teams estimated that about 5MJ of energy would be needed from the primary, generating a 1MJ beam. To put this in perspective, a small fission primary of 0.5kt releases 2 million MJ in total.|$|E

25|$|Another {{carpet in}} the Pergamon Museum was dated to before 1500 AD. It shows four double-headed quadrupeds within a {{rectangular}} field {{surrounded by an}} eight-pointed star. The uppermost star is cut off. The stars are framed by smaller octagonal ornaments, two at their sides, one each {{at the top and}} bottom of each star. A smaller guardian border separates the field from the main border, which shows stylized leaves adorning S-shaped ornaments. Smaller triangular elements of the design and <b>the</b> <b>outlines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> animals are woven in offset knotting. By its colours, the carpet has been localized to Central Anatolia. On the reverse of the carpet, additional wefts can be seen meandering over two warps after about every 22 regular wefts. The additional weft changes its colour from yellow to red, roughly at the middle of the carpet. It has been interpreted to show a day's work of two weavers working besides each other. If taken as such, the number of knots woven by each weaver would amount to roughly 2,500 knots per day. (Beselin 2011, p.50–1) See: knot density.|$|E
25|$|In 1997 Avinoam Danin, a {{botanist}} at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, {{reported that}} he had identified Chrysanthemum coronarium (now called Glebionis coronaria), Cistus creticus and Zygophyllum whose pressed image on the shroud was first noticed by Alan Whanger in 1985 on the photographs of the shroud taken in 1931. He reported that <b>the</b> <b>outlines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flowering plants would point to March or April and the environs of Jerusalem. In a separate report in 1978 Danin and Uri Baruch reported on the pollen grains on the cloth samples, stating that they were appropriate to the spring in Israel. Max Frei, a Swiss police criminologist who initially obtained pollen from the shroud during the STURP investigation stated that of the 58 different types of pollens found, 45 were from the Jerusalem area, while six were from the eastern Middle East, with one pollen species growing exclusively in İstanbul, and two found in Edessa, Turkey. Mark Antonacci argues that the pollen evidence and flower images are inherently interwoven and strengthen each other.|$|E
25|$|Establishing {{the core}} tenets of Judaism {{in the modern}} era is even more difficult, given the number and {{diversity}} of the contemporary Jewish denominations. Even if to restrict the problem to the most influential intellectual trends of the nineteenth and twentieth century, the matter remains complicated. Thus for instance, Joseph Soloveitchik's (associated with the Modern Orthodox movement) answer to modernity is constituted upon the identification of Judaism with following the halakha whereas its ultimate goal is to bring the holiness down to the world. Mordecai Kaplan, the founder of the Reconstructionist Judaism, abandons the idea of religion for the sake of identifying Judaism with civilization and by means of the latter term and secular translation of the core ideas, he tries to embrace as many Jewish denominations as possible. In turn, Solomon Schechter's Conservative Judaism was identical with the tradition understood as the interpretation of Torah, in itself being the history of the constant updates and adjustment of the Law performed by means of the creative interpretation. Finally, David Philipson draws <b>the</b> <b>outlines</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Reform movement in Judaism by opposing it to the strict and traditional rabbinical approach and thus comes to the conclusions {{similar to that of the}} Conservative movement.|$|E
