5|$|A rare but serious {{complication}} {{resulting from}} treatment with warfarin is warfarin necrosis, which occurs more frequently shortly after commencing treatment {{in patients with}} a deficiency of protein C. Protein C is an innate anticoagulant that, like the procoagulant factors that warfarin inhibits, requires vitamin K-dependent carboxylation for its activity. Since warfarin initially decreases protein C levels faster than the coagulation factors, it can paradoxically increase the blood's tendency to coagulate when treatment is first begun (many patients when starting on warfarin are given heparin in parallel to combat this), leading <b>to</b> <b>massive</b> thrombosis with skin necrosis and gangrene of limbs. Its natural counterpart, purpura fulminans, occurs in children who are homozygous for certain protein C mutations.|$|E
5|$|Babangida survived an {{abortive}} coup, then postponed a promised {{return to}} democracy to 1992. Free {{and fair elections}} were finally held on 12 June 1993, the first since the military coup of 1983, with a presidential victory for Moshood Kashimawo Olawale Abiola of the Social Democratic Party, who gained some 58% of the votes, defeating Bashir Tofa of the National Republican Convention. However, Babangida annulled the elections, leading <b>to</b> <b>massive</b> civilian protests that effectively shut down the country for weeks. Babangida finally kept his promise to relinquish office to a civilian government, but not before appointing Ernest Shonekan head of an interim government. Babangida's regime has been considered the most corrupt, and responsible for creating a culture of corruption in Nigeria.|$|E

Upon Philippine independence in 1946, seven of the British-controlled Turtle Islands (including Cagayan de Tawi-Tawi and Mangsee Islands) off the north coast of Borneo were ceded to the Philippines as had been negotiated by the American and British colonial governments.|$|E
5|$|Events with a {{duration}} of less than about two seconds are classified as short gamma-ray bursts. These account for about 30% of gamma-ray bursts, but until 2005, no afterglow had been successfully detected from any short event and little was known about their origins. Since then, several dozen short gamma-ray burst afterglows have been detected and localized, several of which are associated with regions of little or no star formation, such as large elliptical galaxies and the central regions of large galaxy clusters. This rules out a link <b>to</b> <b>massive</b> stars, confirming that short events are physically distinct from long events. In addition, there has been no association with supernovae.|$|E
5|$|Following the German {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union in 1941, the tide gradually turned against the Nazis, who suffered major military defeats in 1943. Large-scale aerial bombing of Germany escalated in 1944 and the Axis powers were pushed back in Eastern and Southern Europe. Following the Allied {{invasion of}} France, Germany was conquered by the Soviet Union from {{the east and the}} other Allied powers from the west and capitulated within a year. Hitler's refusal to admit defeat led <b>to</b> <b>massive</b> destruction of German infrastructure and additional war-related deaths in the closing months of the war. The victorious Allies initiated a policy of denazification and put many of the surviving Nazi leadership on trial for war crimes at the Nuremberg trials.|$|E

5|$|In the 1950s, {{research}} {{started in}} the Soviet Union and the US on the growth of diamond by pyrolysis of hydrocarbon gases at the relatively low temperature of 800Â°C. This low-pressure process is known as chemical vapor deposition (CVD). William G. Eversole reportedly achieved vapor deposition of diamond over diamond substrate in 1953, {{but it was not}} reported until 1962. Diamond film deposition was independently reproduced by Angus and coworkers in 1968 and by Deryagin and Fedoseev in 1970. Whereas Eversole and Angus used large, expensive, single-crystal diamonds as substrates, Deryagin and Fedoseev succeeded in making diamond films on non-diamond materials (silicon and metals), which led <b>to</b> <b>massive</b> research on inexpensive diamond coatings in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|On 13 September 1948, the Indian Army {{was sent}} into Hyderabad under Operation Polo {{on the grounds}} that the law and order {{situation}} there threatened the peace of South India. The troops met little resistance by the Razakars and between 13 and 18 September took complete control of the state. The operation led <b>to</b> <b>massive</b> communal violence with estimates of deaths ranging from the official one of 27,000-40,000 to scholarly ones of 200,000 or more. The Nizam was retained as the head of state in the same manner as the other princes who acceded to India. He thereupon disavowed the complaints that had been made to the UN and, despite vehement protests from Pakistan and strong criticism from other countries, the Security Council did not deal further with the question, and Hyderabad was absorbed into India.|$|E
5|$|Prehistoric Polynesian {{habitation}} on Nihoa {{may have}} initially {{led to a}} decrease in the plant population of A. brownii. Major threats to the plant include invasive species, fire, and hybridization with other Amaranthus species. Inbreeding is a serious threat, as the small plant population must reproduce within its own circle resulting in genetic defects. A. brownii is also forced to compete with the non-native weed (Portulaca oleracea), the plant's main alien species threat. In 2002 and 2004, the invasive gray bird grasshopper (Schistocerca nitens) presented an even larger threat to A. brownii. First recorded on the island in 1977, the increasing population density of gray bird grasshoppers led <b>to</b> <b>massive</b> defoliation on the island, leaving A. brownii at greater risk of predation. In 2004 alone, an estimated 400,000 gray bird grasshoppers destroyed almost 90% of the vegetation on Nihoa.|$|E

5|$|Tau Ceti {{has been}} a target of a radial {{velocity}} planetary searches. As of 1988, observations ruled out any periodical variations attributable <b>to</b> <b>massive</b> planets around Tau Ceti inside of Jupiter-like distances. Ever-more precise measurements continue to rule out such planets, at least until December 2012. The velocity precision reached is about 11m/s measured over a five-year time span. This result excludes the presence of hot Jupiters, and probably excludes any planets with minimum mass {{greater than or equal}} to Jupiter's mass and with orbital periods less than 15 years. In addition, a survey of nearby stars by the Hubble Space Telescope's Wide Field and Planetary Camera was completed in 1999, including a search for faint companions to Tau Ceti; none were discovered to limits of the telescope's resolving power.|$|E
5|$|The Santa Ana {{drainage}} basin has {{a diversity of}} terrain, ranging from high peaks of inland mountains {{in the north and}} east, to the hot, dry interior and semi-desert basins of the Inland Empire, to the flat coastal plain of Orange County. Although it includes areas of alpine and highland forest, the majority of the watershed consists of arid desert and chaparral environments. Due to low regional rainfall, the river carries only a small flow except during the brief winter season, when it is prone <b>to</b> <b>massive</b> flash floods. The San Jacinto River, which drains the southern half of the watershed, rarely reaches the Santa Ana except in extremely wet years. However, a wide variety of animal and plant communities depend on the riparian zones and remnant wetlands along the Santa Ana River.|$|E
5|$|The Second Samnite War, from 327 BC to 304 BC, was a {{much longer}} and more serious affair for both the Romans and Samnites, running for over twenty years and {{incorporating}} twenty-four battles that led <b>to</b> <b>massive</b> casualties on both sides. The fortunes of the two sides fluctuated throughout its course: the Samnites seized Neapolis in the Capture of Neapolis in 327 BC, which the Romans then re-captured before losing at the Battle of the Caudine Forks and the Battle of Lautulae. The Romans then proved victorious at the Battle of Bovianum and the tide turned strongly against the Samnites from 314 BC onwards, leading them to sue for peace with progressively less generous terms. By 304 BC the Romans had effectively annexed the greater degree of the Samnite territory, founding several colonies. This pattern of meeting aggression in force and so inadvertently gaining territory in strategic counter-attacks {{was to become a}} common feature of Roman military history.|$|E

5|$|The {{musician}} Tricky was {{a member}} of the Wild Bunch sound system and a contributor <b>to</b> <b>Massive</b> Attack's first two albums. Born in 1968, Tricky grew up in Knowle West in the 1970s and 1980s and was educated at Merrywood School. He named his 2008 album Knowle West Boy in tribute to the area's influence on him and his music. Boxer Dixie Brown lived in Knowle West from the 1930s until the 1950s and was a regular at the Venture Inn, a public house in Melvin Square. He was frequently visited by black American troops during World War II. The Eagles were a rock and roll band who formed in the late 1950s at the Eagle House youth club and featured in the 1962 film Some People.|$|E
5|$|The United Fruit Company {{had been}} formed in 1899 by {{the merger of}} two large American corporations. The new company had major {{holdings}} of land and railroads across Central America, which it used to support its business of exporting bananas. In 1900 it was already the world's largest exporter of bananas. By 1930 it had an operating capital of 215 million US dollars, and had been the largest landowner and employer in Guatemala for several years. Under Manuel Estrada Cabrera and other Guatemalan presidents, the company obtained a series of concessions {{in the country that}} allowed it to massively expand its business. These concessions frequently came at the cost of tax revenue for the Guatemalan government. The company supported Jorge Ubico in the leadership struggle that occurred from 1930 to 1932, and upon assuming power, Ubico expressed willingness to create a new contract with it. This new contract was immensely favorable to the company. It included a 99-year lease <b>to</b> <b>massive</b> tracts of land, exemptions from virtually all taxes, and a guarantee that no other company would receive any competing contract. Under Ubico, the company paid virtually no taxes, which hurt the Guatemalan government's ability to deal with the effects of the Great Depression. Ubico asked the company to pay its workers only 50 cents a day, to prevent other workers from demanding higher wages. The company also virtually owned Puerto Barrios, Guatemala's only port to the Atlantic ocean, allowing the company to make profits from the flow of goods through the port. By 1950, the company's annual profits were 65 million US dollars, twice the revenue of the Guatemalan government.|$|E
5|$|The most wide-reaching {{psychological}} {{weapon was}} {{the radio station}} Voice of Liberation. It began broadcasting on 1 May 1954, carrying anti-communist propaganda, telling its listeners to resist the Ãrbenz government and support the liberating forces of Castillo Armas. The station claimed to be broadcasting from deep within the jungles of the Guatemalan hinterland, a message which many listeners believed. In actuality, the broadcasts were concocted in Miami by Guatemalan exiles, flown to Central America, and broadcast through a mobile transmitter. The Voice of Liberation made an initial broadcast that was repeated four times, after which it took to transmitting two-hour bulletins twice a day. The transmissions were initially only heard intermittently in Guatemala City; a week later, the CIA significantly increased their transmitting power, allowing clear reception in the Guatemalan capital. The radio broadcasts {{have been given a}} lot of credit by historians for the success of the coup, due to the unrest they created throughout the country. They were unexpectedly assisted by the outage of the government-run radio station, which stopped transmitting for three weeks while a new antenna was being fitted. These transmissions continued throughout the conflict, broadcasting exaggerated news of rebel troops converging on the capital, and contributing <b>to</b> <b>massive</b> demoralization among both the army and the civilian population.|$|E
