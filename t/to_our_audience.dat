6000|$|Thus a {{great deal}} may be done by {{studying}} inappropriateness of style, by adopting a style alien to our matter and <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>audience.</b> If we [...] "haver" [...] discursively about serious, and difficult, and intricate topics, we fail; and we fail if we write on happy, pleasant, and popular topics in an abstruse and intent, and analytic style. We fail, too, if in style we go outside our natural selves. [...] "The style is the man," [...] and the man will be nothing, and nobody, if he tries for an incongruous manner, not naturally his own, for example if Miss Yonge were suddenly to emulate the manner of Lever, or if Mr. John Morley were to strive to shine in the fashion of Uncle Remus, or if Mr. Rider Haggard were to be allured into imitation by the example, so admirable in itself, of the Master of Balliol. It is ourselves we must try to improve, our attentiveness, our interest in life, our seriousness of purpose, and then the style will improve with the self. Or perhaps, to be perfectly frank, we shall thus convert ourselves into prigs, throw ourselves out of our stride, lapse into self- consciousness, lose all that is natural, naif, and instinctive within us. Verily there are many dangers, and the paths to failure are infinite.|$|E

Another week cardiac output Paulette Acosta, Giselle dancing with the girls and the pace of Tito el Bambino marked the sixth show of Nuestra Belleza Latina 2011. The 11 participants were subjected to two major tests during the week: report from a construction site through any obstacle and a pole dancing sensual dance where they had to demonstrate their agility as athletes and dancers at the challenge of pole dancing. Pretty generally conductive, Giselle Blondet, is responsible for encouraging girls during the tests but this time wanted to show solidarity with them and learn the choreography of the show opening. The audience went crazy when Giselle went to the dance floor to shake your hips to the rhythm of mambo and demonstrate that if they compete, the girls would be in serious trouble to snatch the crown. This challenge was held secret for a week and eleven girls {{did not know what to}} expect when they arrived at the location, in miniskirts and heels. Once there were reported to be reported from a construction site without suspecting that the production would submit to all sorts of obstacles to measuring the calm before the cameras in front of unexpected situations. When Nuestra Belleza Latina participants were in full report at all surprised by the sound of a drilling machine that kept driving their interviews or listen to their interviews. All of them will cast a valde of water and mud as they were about to close his report that helped the jury to measure who responded and who are naturally frozen on camera. If you thought the treacherous catwalk last week was difficult, the challenges of this week confirmed that this competition is getting tougher. During the week the candidates had to rehearse sexy choreography, in which used as tools from chairs to a tube, activity that was not all easy because each had to demonstrate physical dexterity and could not always look as seductive as intended. Our dear Charytín was encouraging them and watching their development to qualify. Diana Cano was really distressed testing tube and surprised all with his shyness and concern about what your coworkers think of her Wall Street. Darla proved to be the most agile of the group, and a good companion to teach Gredmarie their best moves. After the challenges came time to decide. They announced the candidate with fewer votes from the public and the two who had received worse grades on the challenges. The girl with the fewest public votes was Paulette Acosta, and she joined Villa and Diana Cano Jocell with lower qualifications. It's time for the girls to save someone and no one would believe to be saved. Nothing more, nothing less than Diana Cano, the most direct of all participants. In front of the judges were Jocell and Paulette Villa Acosta, the latter being the judges decided to eliminate. We are consenting <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>audience</b> and because you asked Tito [...] "El Bambino" [...] will be responsible to make everyone dance to its rhythm.

5000|$|The {{roots of}} Carolina Wren were in Berkeley, California, {{though it was}} birthed on January 1, 1976, in Chapel Hill, as I sat {{in my living room}} in Chase Park Apartments, looking past the balcony, where I fed {{wintering}} birds, into the woods behind them. Chase Park had grown out of the Chapel Hill Civil Rights struggle and was run by the Interfaith Council...Meanwhile, Thorp Springs Press had been publishing the writers I was finding and being found by: Virginia Long Rudder (After the Ifaluk), Miranda Cambanis (The Execution, a play), and Tom Huey (This Life: A Salutation, a poem broadside for Amon). Hyperion 12 (1975) had in it Lance Jeffers, T.J. Reddy, Jaki and Sherman Shelton, Amon, Miranda, Mitchell Lyman, Roz Wolbarsht, Marion Phillips, and Mike Riggsby. By the end of 1975 I had promised to publish Liner’s Chrome Grass, Bill Herron’s American Peasant, and Mike Riggsby’s Milky Way Poems. That December, when Paul and Foster visited me, he suggested I start my own press, arguing that the audience for my authors was more in North Carolina. So, on January 1, 1976, I decided to begin Carolina Wren Press. I chose the name because I loved the bird, its liking to be near people, its cheerful, confident call (“cheering, cheering, cheering you!”; certainly not “teakettle, teakettle, teakettle!”), and the male wren, I had leaned, constructed four or five nests and then let the female choose the one she liked best.I also was very aware by then that there was an “in crowd” of literati in North Carolina, and a triumvirate of respected literary men: Guy Owen, who edited Southern Poetry Review; Thad Stem of Oxford; and Sam Ragan, who edited The Pilot in Southern Pines. Charlene Whisnant had previously challenged their hegemony, and I had found myself surrounded by the writers who couldn’t break into the inner circle these three dominated. These men were good people, but their vision was limited as to what poetry could be and could express and who the important poets were. They seemed out of touch with all the new voices rising around me. So having ‘Carolina’ {{in the name of the}} press appealed to me. My writers were also important to North Carolina, and the South, even if the Carolina Quarterly (University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill’s mag) and Southern Poetry Review wouldn’t publish them. They were a motley crew: African-Americans; new women writers; Amon Liner, who was extremely innovative; and some who were on the fringe—as was I—just because we were not from the South. All of us were intensely committed writers, with vision, with a lot to say <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>audience.</b> But we weren’t writing in the standard academic mold of a lyric poem organized around one central image.A symptom of the way I felt was in my dedication of Hyperion 16, the special Southern issue and our last, which finally was published in 1980. I dedicated it to Amon Liner (1940-1976) and to T.J. Reddy (1945- [...] ): “two outstanding Southern gentlemen.” There I was trying to break down stereotypes again!In 1976 I was living on food stamps and in subsidized housing, plus receiving free daycare for Ginia under Title XX as I made my way back into the job market. The COSMEP conference was in Austin, Texas that year; and Paul organized it with other Austin area writers and editors. This time I went alone (Terry took the children to the West Coast to see his parents). It was a lively, warm, funny conference; I remember that we all broke up laughing when I described our new van project and told the assembled editors and writers that we’d all get to know each other better if we ate and slept together. There was also a woman there urging us to learn accounting so we could turn our liabilities into assets. I can’t say that I ever learned exactly how this worked, though I did learn how to keep books. But Paul revealed his own economic approach to book publishing when he claimed it only cost $.60 a book, and his wife, Foster, immediately contradicted him. His reply was that he had to believe it cost $.60 a book in order to keep publishing. I also remember vividly Len Randolph holding up a copy of the cover of Chrome Grass, talking about this new press, Carolina Wren, and how strange that felt, and how good. It was real. I was a publisher! ...|$|E
