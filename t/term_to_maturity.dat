The relationship between short and long interest rates and shape of yield curve are both explained by the following theories: expectations hypothesis and market segmentation hypothesis. The expectation hypothesis is not a homogenous theory and has several types. The expectations hypothesis can be divided into the pure expectations theory and weight expectations theory. The weight expectations theory can be divided into liquidity theory and preferred habitat theory.

40|$|When a {{corporation}} refunds a bond issue, choices {{have to be}} made between fixed-rate and floating-rate bonds based on expectations of future interest rates. Whether it is financially viable to refund a bond issue depends on many factors, including the magnitude of the decline in interest rates, the call premium, flotation costs, overlapping interest and the corporate tax rate, and all of these factors should be considered in the decision making process. This paper presents a comprehensive quantitative model that will assist the corporation to decide whether to refund and to select the best refunding option.

Swap spread changes are negatively related to changes in the level of interest rates and changes in the slope of the term structure. We also find that there is a strong and significant volatility interaction among spreads for swaps of different maturities and that the process for the conditional variance of the spread is highly persistent across all maturities. <br /...|$|R

It is argued that specifying utility to be a non-time-separable function of consumption allows for richer term structure relations than separable specifications. The model is capable <b>to</b> explain why <b>term</b> premiums vary and why the term structure may fail to be monotone. Our analysis also demonstrates that the planning horizon of the agents critically affects the term structure of asset returns.

[...] Borrowers thus faced a decision: accept high payments in return for eventual outright ownership or preference short-term well-being over formal home ownership. Many adopted a hybrid, financing 50% {{of the purchase price}} (less down payment) with an interest-only balloon loan and covering the remainder with an amortizing mortgage from a thrift, eventually financing the obligation at maturity of the former (perhaps after rolling it over for several periods) with an amortizing loan, and in so doing extending the <b>term</b> <b>to</b> <b>maturity</b> of this hybrid {{while at the same time}} putting forth a smaller down payment (the combined value of the mortgages exceeds an individual mortgage that and individual would qualify for).

Credit unions and Quebec and New Brunswick's caisses populaires are not insured federally, because they are created under provincial charters and backed by provincial insurance plans, which generally follow the federal model. Deposits in foreign currencies are not insured, even when held by a registered CDIC financial institution. Guaranteed Investment Certificates with a term longer than 5 years are also not insured. Funds in foreign banks operating in Canada are not covered. Some funds in Registered Retirement Savings Plans or Registered Retirement Income Funds at a bank may not be covered if they are invested in mutual funds or held in specific instruments like debentures issued by government or corporations.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the dynamic {{relationship}} of bond yields of Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, India, and Japan by using 43 observations {{for the period}} of 2007 to July 2010. This study analyzes the government bond returns and the yields curve for the five countries with different <b>term</b> <b>to</b> <b>maturity</b> of 5 years and 15 years. The results indicate that the yields on government bond for the five countries are all consistent with the term structure of interest rate theory where the yields to maturity increase as the <b>term</b> <b>to</b> <b>maturity</b> increase during the period of 2007 to 2010. There is also evidence supporting the yields to maturity for all five countries are significantly stationary at order one or I(1). Moreover, the findings also show that there are a few groups of countries were found co-integration with one vector. In long run, the results find that between the group of countries, Malaysia and India, Singapore and Thailand, and Singapore and India, the bond returns for the 5 and 15 years <b>term</b> <b>to</b> <b>maturity</b> are co-integrated with at least one co-integrating vectors...|$|E
50|$|In 1934, {{as part of}} the New Deal, Congress {{passed the}} National Housing Act of 1934, which created two new agencies: (1) the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), which insured {{mortgages}} that met specific criteria, and (2) the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (FSLIC), which insured deposits at S&Ls (and which failed during the Savings and Loan Crisis). Both were focused on shoring up the housing market by availing more credit, thereby thickening the market and stabilizing home prices. The FHA went one step further, and set restrictions on the terms and interest rates of qualifying mortgages, typically requiring fully amortizing mortgages <b>to</b> carry <b>terms</b> <b>to</b> <b>maturity</b> in excess of 15 years, with interest rates exceeding 5% annually in only isolated cases. The structure of these new mortgages mitigates much of the risk inherent to pre-crash instruments.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the nature of}} the relationship which exists between the dynamics of exchange rate adjustments and the term structure of interest rates. In the absence of anticipated economic disturbances, there exists a well-defined negative relationship between movements in the exchange rate and the long-short interest rate differential which does not persist in the presence of anticipated disturbances. It follows that any empirical test of the relationship between the exchange rate and the term structure of interest rates necessitates the utilisation of a measure of the yield curve which is considerably more sophisticated than the differential between interest rates on assets with long and short <b>terms</b> <b>to</b> <b>maturity.</b> An appropriate yield curve approximation is estimated on monthly Irish data over the period 1979 (4) - 1986 (12) and employed to examine its relationship with the rate of foreign exchange of the Irish punt over the same period...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to investigate risk capital allocation methods in detail for both non-life and life insurance business. In non-life insurance business loss models are generally linear with respect to losses of business-lines. However, in life insurance loss models are not generally a linear function of factor risks, i. e. the interest-rate factor, mortality rate factor, etc. In {{the first part of}} the thesis, we present the existing allocation methods and discuss their advantages and disadvantages. In a comprehensive simulation study we examine the allocations sensitivity to different allocation methods, different risk measures and different risk models in a non-life insurance business. We also show the possible usage of the Euclidean distance measure and rank correlation coefficients for the comparison of allocation methods. In the second part, we investigate the factor risk contribution theory and examine its application under a life annuity business. We provide two approximations that enable us to apply risk capital allocation methods directly to annuity values in order to measure factor risk contributions. We examine factor risk contributions for annuities with different <b>terms</b> <b>to</b> <b>maturity</b> and the annuities payable at different times in future.

40|$|Following {{a meeting}} on the {{estimation}} of zero-coupon yield curves held at the BIS in June 1996, participating central banks have since been reporting their estimates to the Bank for International Settlements. The BIS Data Bank Services provide access to these data, which consist of either spot rates for selected <b>terms</b> <b>to</b> <b>maturity</b> or represent estimated parameters from which spot and forward rates can be derived. In the case estimated parameters are reported, the Data Bank Services provides, {{in addition to the}} parameters also the generated spot rates. The purpose of this document is to facilitate the use of these data. It provides information on the reporting central banks' approaches to the estimation of the zero-coupon yield curves and the data transmitted to the BIS Data Bank. In most cases, the contributing central banks adopted the so-called Nelson and Siegel approach or the Svensson extension thereof. A brief overview of the relevant estimation techniques and the associated mathematics is provided below. General issues concerning the estimation of yield curves are discussed in Section 1. Sections 2 and 3 document the term structure of interest rate data available from the BIS. The final section provides examples of estimated parameter and selected spot and forward rates derived thereof. A list of contacts at central banks can be found after the references. The remainder of this document consists of brief notes provided by the reporting central banks on approaches they have taken to estimate the yield curves. Since the last release of this manual in March 1999 there have been four major changes: Switzerland started to report their estimates of the yield curve to the BIS in August 2002.
