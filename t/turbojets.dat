5|$|Required {{power was}} put up {{by a pair of}} {{afterburning}} Westinghouse XJ46-WE-02 <b>turbojets,</b> fed from intakes mounted high above the wings to avoid ingesting spray. When these engines were not ready for the prototypes, twin Westinghouse J34-WE-32 engines of just over half the power were installed.|$|E
5|$|Early {{versions}} of the Su-25 were equipped with two R95Sh non-afterburning <b>turbojets,</b> in compartments {{on either side of}} the rear fuselage. The engines, sub-assemblies and surrounding fuselage are cooled by air provided by the cold air intakes on top of the engine nacelles. A drainage system collects oil, hydraulic fluid residues and fuel from the engines after flight or after an unsuccessful start. The engine control systems allows independent operation of each engine. The latest versions (Su-25T and TM) are equipped with improved R-195 engines.|$|E
5|$|However, Chase had {{designed}} the aircraft {{to allow for}} the easy installation of engines; the first XG-20 had already been modified with two radial piston engines, becoming the XC-123, the prototype of the long-serving C-123 Provider family of transports. Meanwhile, the second prototype XG-20 was returned to Chase Aircraft, to be fitted with two twin pods for General Electric J47 <b>turbojets,</b> becoming the XC-123A, the first jet-powered transport aircraft built in the United States.|$|E
50|$|The air {{turboramjet engine}} is a {{combined}} cycle engine that merges aspects of <b>turbojet</b> and ramjet engines. The turboramjet is a hybrid engine that essentially consists of a <b>turbojet</b> mounted inside a ramjet. The <b>turbojet</b> core is mounted inside a duct that contains a combustion chamber downstream of the <b>turbojet</b> nozzle. The turboramjet can be run in <b>turbojet</b> mode at takeoff and during low-speed flight but then switch to ramjet mode to accelerate to high Mach numbers.|$|R
50|$|The Westinghouse J30, {{initially}} {{known as}} the Westinghouse 19XB, was a <b>turbojet</b> engine developed by Westinghouse Electric Corporation. It was the first American-designed <b>turbojet</b> to run, and only the second axial-flow <b>turbojet</b> to run outside Germany.|$|R

5|$|In 1944, Republic Aviation's chief designer, Alexander Kartveli, {{began working}} on a turbojet-powered {{replacement}} for the P-47 Thunderbolt piston-engined fighter. The initial attempts to redesign the P-47 to accommodate a jet engine proved futile due to the large cross-section of the early centrifugal compressor <b>turbojets.</b> Instead, Kartveli and his team designed a new aircraft with a streamlined fuselage largely occupied by an axial compressor turbojet engine and fuel stored in rather thick unswept wings.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{principal}} technologies that enabled an aircraft {{as large as the}} 747 to be drawn up was the high-bypass turbofan engine. The engine technology was thought to be capable of delivering double the power of the earlier <b>turbojets</b> while consuming a third less fuel. General Electric had pioneered the concept but was committed to developing the engine for the C-5 Galaxy and did not enter the commercial market until later. Pratt & Whitney was also working on the same principle and, by late 1966, Boeing, Pan Am and Pratt & Whitney agreed to develop a new engine, designated the JT9D to power the 747.|$|E
5|$|Production B.1 Victors were {{powered by}} the Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire ASSa.7 <b>turbojets</b> rated at , and was {{initially}} deployed with the Blue Danube nuclear weapon, re-deploying with the more powerful Yellow Sun weapon when it became available. Victors also carried U.S.-owned Mark 5 nuclear bombs (made available under the Project E programme) and the British Red Beard tactical nuclear weapon. A total of 24 were upgraded to B.1A standard {{by the addition of}} Red Steer tail warning radar in an enlarged tail-cone and a suite of radar warning receivers and electronic countermeasures (ECM) from 1958 to 1960.|$|E

40|$|The {{control of}} an airbreathing <b>turbojet</b> engine by an onboard digital {{computer}} is studied.

5|$|In May 1948, AMC asked Boeing to {{incorporate}} the previously discarded, but now more fuel-efficient, jet engine into the design. That resulted {{in the development of}} yet another revision—in July 1948, Model 464-40 substituted Westinghouse J40 <b>turbojets</b> for the turboprops. The Air Force project officer who reviewed the Model 464-40 was favorably impressed, especially since he had already been thinking along similar lines. Nevertheless, the government was concerned about the high fuel consumption rate of the jet engines of the day, and directed that Boeing still use the turboprop-powered Model 464-35 {{as the basis for the}} XB-52. Although he agreed that turbojet propulsion was the future, General Howard A. Craig, Deputy Chief of Staff for Material, was not very keen on a jet-powered B-52, since he felt that the jet engine had not yet progressed sufficiently to permit skipping an intermediate turboprop stage. However, Boeing was encouraged to continue turbojet studies even without any expected commitment to jet propulsion.|$|E
5|$|The TSR-2 {{was to be}} {{powered by}} two Bristol-Siddeley Olympus reheated <b>turbojets,</b> {{advanced}} variants of those used in the Avro Vulcan. The Olympus would be further developed and would power the supersonic Concorde. The design featured a small shoulder-mounted delta wing with down-turned tips, an all-moving swept tailplane and a large all-moving fin. Blown flaps were fitted across the entire trailing edge of the wing to achieve the short takeoff and landing requirement, something that later designs would achieve with the technically more complex swing-wing approach. No ailerons were fitted, control in roll instead being implemented by differential movement of the slab tailplanes. The wing loading was high for its time, enabling the aircraft to fly at very high speed and low level with great stability without being constantly upset by thermals and other ground-related weather phenomena. The EE Chief Test Pilot, Wing Commander Roland Beamont, favourably compared the TSR-2's supersonic flying characteristics to the Canberra's own subsonic flight characteristics, stating that the Canberra was more troublesome.|$|E
5|$|The B-52H had {{the same}} crew and {{structural}} changes as the B-52G. The most significant upgrade was the switch to TF33-P-3 turbofan engines which, despite the initial reliability problems (corrected by 1964 under the Hot Fan program), offered considerably better performance and fuel economy than the J57 <b>turbojets.</b> The ECM and avionics were updated, a new fire control system was fitted, and the rear defensive armament was changed from machine guns to a 20mm M61 Vulcan cannon (later removed in 1991–94). The final 18 aircraft were manufactured with provision for the ADR-8 countermeasures rocket, which was later retrofitted to {{the remainder of the}} B-52G and B-52H fleet. A provision was made for four GAM-87 Skybolt ballistic missiles. The aircraft's first flight occurred on 10 July 1960, and it entered service on 9 May 1961. This is the only variant still in use by the USAF. A total of 102 B-52Hs were built. The last production aircraft, B-52H AF Serial No. 61-0040, left the factory on 26 October 1962.|$|E
40|$|An inlet {{concept for}} {{separate}} <b>turbojet</b> and ramjet engines was defined and {{compared with an}} equivalent inlet for a wraparound turboramjet engine. The comparison was made for a typical high altitude hypersonic cruise vehicle where the <b>turbojet</b> inlet capture area was required to be half {{as large as the}} ramjet inlet capture area at cruise. The use of a shorter nacelle having substantially lower cooling requirements at cruise for the inlet concept for separate <b>turbojet</b> and ramjet engines is suggested. The separate engine concept better isolates the <b>turbojet</b> from the ramjet, requires no special close off mechanisms within the <b>turbojet,</b> and avoids the circumferential heat load imposed by a wraparound ramjet. A more variable geometry is required...|$|R
50|$|Turboramjet engines have a {{transition}} from <b>turbojet</b> mode to ramjet mode as thrust-producing flow is transferred from the high pressure inner part to the low pressure outer part. During the transition the <b>turbojet</b> may have its fuel flow reduced as the ramjet parts take over thrust production. For example, in the Nord Griffon 02 the <b>turbojet</b> RPM was reduced to 90%.|$|R
50|$|Early aft-fan {{arrangements}} which added bypass airflow to a <b>turbojet</b> {{were known}} as thrust augmentors. The aft-fan fitted to the General Electric CJ805-3 <b>turbojet</b> augmented the take-off thrust from 11,650lb to 16,100lb.|$|R
5|$|Required {{to tender}} {{by the end}} of April 1947, work began on receipt of Specification B.35/46 at Avro, led by {{technical}} director Roy Chadwick and chief designer Stuart Davies; the type designation was Avro 698. It was obvious to the design team that conventional aircraft could not satisfy the specification; knowing little about high-speed flight and unable to glean much from the Royal Aircraft Establishment or the US, they investigated German Second World War swept wing research. The team estimated that an otherwise conventional aircraft, with a swept wing of 45°, would have doubled the weight requirement. Realising that swept wings increase longitudinal stability, the team deleted the tail (empennage) and the supporting fuselage, it thus became a swept-back flying wing with only a rudimentary forward fuselage and a fin (vertical stabilizer) at each wingtip. The estimated weight was now only 50% over the requirement; a delta shape resulted from reducing the wingspan and maintaining the wing area by filling in the space between the wingtips, which enabled the specification to be met. Though Alexander Lippisch is generally credited as the pioneer of the delta wing, Chadwick's team had followed its own logical design process. The initial design submission had four large <b>turbojets</b> stacked in pairs buried in the wing either side of the centreline. Outboard of the engines were two bomb-bays.|$|E

This system is compared with a conventional <b>turbojet</b> with and without reheat and pre-cooling. Within the limitations of the analysis it is seen that the domain of air breathing engines for propulsion can be extended to hypersonic vehicles. The inverted <b>turbojet</b> is an economical cruising engine for hypersonic vehicles at Mach numbers 5 - 6. However a conventional <b>turbojet</b> with pre-cooling and reheat can power a vehicle throughout the range of Mach 0 to Mach 6...|$|R

50|$|The {{operation}} of the engine is controlled using bypass flaps located just downstream of the diffuser. During low-speed flight, controllable flaps close the bypass duct and force air directly into the compressor section of the <b>turbojet.</b> During high-speed flight, the flaps block the flow into the <b>turbojet,</b> and the engine operates like a ramjet using the AFT combustion chamber to produce thrust. The engine would start out operating as a <b>turbojet</b> during takeoff and while climbing to altitude. Upon reaching high subsonic speed, {{the portion of the}} engine downstream of the <b>turbojet</b> would be used as an afterburner to accelerate the plane above the speed of sound.|$|R
