5|$|<b>The</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> in helium {{is nearly}} three times <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> in air. Because the {{fundamental}} frequency of a gas-filled cavity is proportional to <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> in the gas, when helium is inhaled there is a corresponding increase in the resonant frequencies of the vocal tract. The fundamental frequency (sometimes called pitch) does not change, since this is produced by direct vibration of the vocal folds, which is unchanged. However, the higher resonant frequencies cause a change in timbre, resulting in a reedy, duck-like vocal quality. The opposite effect, lowering resonant frequencies, {{can be obtained by}} inhaling a dense gas such as sulfur hexafluoride or xenon.|$|E

40|$|Local {{preconditioning}} for Eulerian-Eulerian gas-solid flow calculations with variable {{gas density}} is investigated. The performance of simultaneous solution algorithms for low-Mach calculations is {{strongly related to}} preconditioning. The gas-solid drag source terms are at the origin of a solid volume fraction and frequency dependency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mixture <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> [1]. Whereas <b>the</b> solid volume fraction dependency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mixture <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> is straightforward to account for in the gas-solid preconditioner, {{this is not the}} case with the frequency dependency, the frequency not being an extra calculation variable. The preconditioners used so far in the gas-solid flow literature do not account for or eliminate the frequency dependency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mixture <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> and transfer <b>the</b> problem to <b>the</b> numerical <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound.</b> Not accounting for the frequency dependency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mixture <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> in <b>the</b> gas-solid preconditioner results, however, in drastic convergence slow down [2, 3], even when a fully implicit treatment of the drag source terms is taken. Possible approaches to account for the frequency dependency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mixture <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> in <b>the</b> gas-solid preconditioner are investigated. It is shown that the gas-solid preconditioner does not need to remove the frequency dependency <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mixture <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound,</b> but should account for it and be scaled according to <b>the</b> mixture <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> at <b>the</b> highest frequency calculated, that is the filter frequency mixture <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound,</b> which logically depends on the local mesh resolution. Accounting for the filter frequency mixture <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> in <b>the</b> gas-solid preconditioner as good as eliminates the reduction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> convergence <b>speed</b> by <b>the</b> gas-solid drag source terms. The addition of a drag history force to the gas-solid preconditioner to properly rescale frequencies lower than the filter frequency hardly alters the convergence behavior. <b>The</b> convergence <b>speed</b> is determined by propagation at the highest, i. e. filter frequency...|$|R

30|$|If {{the looming}} bias is an {{adaptive}} trait that has evolved as a protection mechanism against approaching danger, then {{we might expect}} listeners to perceive <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> looming <b>sounds</b> as faster than that <b>of</b> equivalent receding <b>sounds.</b> We might also expect listeners to show better discrimination for <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> looming <b>sounds</b> than for <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> receding <b>sounds</b> because approaching sounds are more salient. Finally, we might expect listeners to perceive close sounds as faster than distant <b>sounds</b> because <b>of</b> their greater potential for danger. In two experiments we tested these hypotheses by presenting listeners with looming and receding sound sources and asking them to judge how fast they were moving.|$|R
5|$|In {{the same}} work, Newton {{presented}} a calculus-like method of geometrical analysis using 'first and last ratios', gave the first analytical determination (based on Boyle's law) of <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> in air, inferred the oblateness of Earth's spheroidal figure, {{accounted for the}} precession of the equinoxes {{as a result of}} the Moon's gravitational attraction on the Earth's oblateness, initiated the gravitational study of the irregularities in the motion of the moon, provided a theory for the determination of the orbits of comets, and much more.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> {{varies with}} {{temperature}}.

In the 1862, during the American Civil War Battle of Iuka, an acoustic shadow, believed to have been enhanced by a northeast wind, kept two divisions of Union soldiers out of the battle, because they could not hear the sounds of battle only six miles downwind.|$|E

50|$|However, {{shock waves}} can form on {{some parts of}} an {{aircraft}} at a <b>speed</b> where <b>the</b> aircraft is moving at less than M=1.0 because <b>the</b> local <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> is determined by air temperature.

5|$|Early Islamic {{philosophers}} initially {{agreed with}} the Aristotelian view that light had no speed of travel. In 1021, Alhazen (Ibn al-Haytham) published the Book of Optics, in which he presented a series of arguments dismissing the emission theory of vision in favour of the now accepted intromission theory, in which light moves from an object into the eye. This led Alhazen to propose that light must have a finite speed, and that {{the speed of light}} is variable, decreasing in denser bodies. He argued that light is substantial matter, the propagation of which requires time, even if this is hidden from our senses. Also in the 11th century, Abū Rayhān al-Bīrūnī agreed that light has a finite speed, and observed that the speed of light is much faster than <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{modified}} air intakes replaced conventional intake rampswhose {{function is}} to divert turbulent boundary layer airflow away from the inlet and prevent it entering the enginewith a diverterless supersonic inlet (DSI) design. The DSI uses a combination of forward-swept inlet cowls and a three-dimensional compression surface to divert the boundary layer airflow at high sub-sonic and supersonic speeds. According to Lockheed Martin, the DSI design prevents most of the boundary layer air from entering the engine at speeds up to two times <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound,</b> reduces weight by removing the need for complex mechanical intake mechanisms, and is stealthier than a conventional intake. In 1999, developmental work on the DSI {{with the aim of}} improving aircraft performance commenced. The JF-17 design was finalised in 2001.

5|$|The {{principal}} {{application of}} Apollonius' problem, as formulated by Isaac Newton, is hyperbolic trilateration, {{which seeks to}} determine a position from the differences in distances to at least three points. For example, a ship may seek to determine its position from the differences in arrival times of signals from three synchronized transmitters. Solutions to Apollonius' problem were used in World War I to determine the location of an artillery piece from the time a gunshot was heard at three different positions, and hyperbolic trilateration is the principle used by the Decca Navigator System and LORAN. Similarly, the location of an aircraft may be determined from the difference in arrival times of its transponder signal at four receiving stations. This multilateration problem {{is equivalent to the}} three-dimensional generalization of Apollonius' problem and applies to global positioning systems such as GPS. It is also used to determine the position of calling animals (such as birds and whales), although Apollonius' problem does not pertain if <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> varies with direction (i.e., the transmission medium not isotropic).|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> in xenon gas (169m/s) is {{less than}} that in air because the average {{velocity}} of the heavy xenon atoms {{is less than}} that of nitrogen and oxygen molecules in air. Hence, xenon vibrates more slowly in the vocal cords when exhaled and produces lowered voice tones, an effect opposite to the high-toned voice produced in helium. Like helium, xenon does not satisfy the body's need for oxygen, and it is both a simple asphyxiant and an anesthetic more powerful than nitrous oxide; consequently, and because xenon is expensive, many universities have prohibited the voice stunt as a general chemistry demonstration. The gas sulfur hexafluoride is similar to xenon in molecular weight (146 versus 131), less expensive, and though an asphyxiant, not toxic or anesthetic; it is often substituted in these demonstrations.|$|E
5|$|The Skylon is a fully {{reusable}} {{single stage}} to orbit (SSTO) vehicle, {{able to achieve}} orbit without staging, which {{is intended to be}} used principally as a reusable launch system. Proponents of the SSTO approach have often claimed that staging involves a number of inherent complications and problems due to complexity, such as being difficult or typically impossible to recover and reuse most elements, thus unavoidably incurring great expense to produce entirely new launch vehicles instead; therefore, they believe that SSTO designs hold the promise of providing a reduction to the high cost of space flights. Operationally, it is envisioned for the non-crewed Skylon to take off from a specially strengthened runway, gain altitude in a fashion akin to a conventional aeroplane and perform an ascent at very high speeds, in excess of five times <b>the</b> <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> (3,800 miles per hour), to attain a peak altitude of roughly 92,000 feet, on the edge of low earth orbit (LEO), where payloads would typically be launched prior to the vehicle's re-entry into the atmosphere, upon which it will conduct a relatively gentle descent before performing a traditional landing upon a runway.|$|E

The present study aimed {{to examine the}} relationship between <b>the</b> calcaneal <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> and biochemical determinants of bone mass, such as sex hormones, parathyroid hormones and serum calcium. METHODS: Data from 549 subjects from the Malaysian Aging Male Study, which included Malay and Chinese men aged 20 years and older residing in the Klang Valley, were used for analysis. <b>The</b> subjects' calcaneal <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> was measured, and their blood was collected for biochemical analysis. Two sets of multiple regression models were generated for the total/bioavailable testosterone and estradiol to avoid multicollinearity. RESULTS: The multiple regression results revealed that bioavailable testosterone and serum total calcium were significant predictors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> calcaneal <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> in <b>the</b> adjusted model. After adjustment for ethnicity and body mass index, only bioavailable testosterone remained significant; the total serum calcium was marginally insignificant. In a separate model, the total testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin were significant predictors, whereas the total serum calcium was marginally insignificant. After adjustment for ethnicity and body mass index (BMI), the significance persisted for total testosterone and SHBG. After further adjustment for age, none of the serum biochemical determinants was a significant predictor <b>of</b> <b>the</b> calcaneal <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound.</b> CONCLUSION: There is a significant age-dependent relationship between <b>the</b> calcaneal <b>speed</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> and total testosterone, bioavailable testosterone and sex hormone-binding globulin in Chinese and Malay men in Malaysia.
