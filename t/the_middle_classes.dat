5|$|Originally {{a working}} class town, {{there was an}} influx of middle class people in the mid-19th century when {{businessmen}} began using Sale as a commuter town. Since then, Sale has had {{a greater proportion of}} middle class residents than the national average. In 1931, 22.7% of Sale's population was middle class compared with 14% in England and Wales, and by 1971, this had increased to 36.3% compared with 24% nationally. Parallel to this increase in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> of Sale was the decline of the working class population. In 1931, 20.3% were working class compared with 36% in England and Wales; by 1971, this had decreased to 15.4% in Sale and 26% nationwide. The rest of the population was made up of clerical workers and skilled manual workers.

5|$|A {{major feature}} in the early {{development}} of Modern English was the codification of explicit norms for standard usage, and their dissemination through official media such as public education and state sponsored publications. In 1755 Samuel Johnson published his A Dictionary of the English Language which introduced a standard set of spelling conventions and usage norms. In 1828, Noah Webster published the American Dictionary of the English language {{in an effort to}} establish a norm for speaking and writing American English that was independent from the British standard. Within Britain, non-standard or lower class dialect features were increasingly stigmatised, leading to the quick spread of the prestige varieties among <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>classes.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the First World War, {{many new}} food {{products}} became available to the typical household, with branded foods advertised for their convenience. Kitchen servants with time to make custards and puddings were replaced with instant foods in jars, or powders that the housewife could quickly mix. American-style dry cereals began to challenge the porridge and bacon and eggs of <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>classes,</b> and the bread and margarine of the poor. While wartime shipping shortages had sharply narrowed choice, the 1920s saw many new kinds of fruit imported from around the world, along with better quality, packaging, and hygiene, aided by refrigerators and refrigerated ships.|$|E
5|$|During the 2nd centuryBC, Roman {{territory}} saw {{an overall}} decline in population, partially {{due to the}} huge losses incurred during various wars. This was accompanied by severe social stresses and the greater collapse of <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> into lower classes of the census and the proletarii. As a result, both the Roman society and its military became increasingly proletarianised. The Roman state was forced to arm its soldiers {{at the expense of}} the state, since many of the soldiers who made up its lower classes were now impoverished proletarii in all but name, and were too poor to afford their own equipment.|$|E
40|$|Using urban {{household}} {{income and expenditure}} survey of China and South Korea, the paper examines traditional beliefs on <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> in regards to economic growth. First belief is that the consumption of <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> is {{an important source of}} domestic demands for goods and services. Second, unlike extravagant upper <b>class,</b> <b>the</b> thrifty <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> saves more for a stable life thereby providing sources for investment in the economy. Third, <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> values and invests in human capital which becomes valuable input for the economy. From the class comparison of household budget allocation, the paper finds that those three economic expectations of <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> are not specific characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class,</b> but rather show intermediate attributes between those of the lower class and upper class considering the size of shares allocated to each purpose and changes over time. In addition, the results suggest that the consumption pattern of <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> in China and South Korea has become similar over the past years...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the size of}} <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> in developing Asia across countries and over time. Based on an absolute measure of <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> of $ 2 -$ 20 (2005 purchasing power parity United States dollars), it finds that between 1990 and 2008, the size of <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> in developing Asia has grown dramatically in percentage share, absolute size, and purchasing power. However, there are large variations in the size and growth of <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> across countries, with the primary growth of <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> largely driven by the People's Republic of China (PRC). Considerably smaller growth has occurred in many countries including Nepal and Sri Lanka. Still, {{a large portion of}} <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> residing in <b>the</b> $ 2 -$ 4 range are extremely vulnerable, and many of the poor in Asia remain in the PRC and India. This suggests that it may be good for policymakers to not only focus on countries that have lagged behind in terms of growth of <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class,</b> but that it should also concern itself with focusing on countries where there is still considerable room to build, and bolster the absolute size of <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> in Asia...|$|R
40|$|<b>The</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> is {{increasingly}} becoming a topical issue in Zambia. However, {{the lack of}} a definitive measure of <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> in <b>the</b> country makes it difficult to have targeted policies towards this group of people, perceived worldwide to be the drivers of economic growth. With high and rising income inequality in Zambia, we define <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> based on <b>the</b> median and on a ‘relative affluence’ perspective. Findings show that the ‘middle class’ (as understood in everyday usage) is not in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> of <b>the</b> income distribution. And those who are in <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> are not ‘middle class’ (in the sense of being above some minimum level of affluence). Defining <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> on <b>the</b> basis of the ‘actual middle’ versus ‘relative affluence’ provides vastly different pictures. This implies that targeted policy designs are required when referring to changes in the economic status of <b>the</b> Zambian <b>middle</b> <b>class.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> is conceptualised in terms of relative affluence, growing the relative size of <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> would have economic benefits such as growing the pool of people with skilled occupations and raising consumer demand within the domestic economy, which could lead to higher economic growth. In contrast, if <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> is defined as <b>the</b> actual <b>middle</b> group, then increasing the relative size of <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> – many of whom are quite poor – would imply supporting economic policies that favour the poor and non-affluent and thus decrease the income gap. This view of <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> provides an important tool for understanding the status of the ‘average’ Zambian and provides policy makers with a more balanced assessment of development in the country...|$|R
5|$|Farming was {{the main}} {{occupation}} in Urmston until the early 19th century, when weaving became {{a significant source of}} employment, although this later declined due to competition from large industry. In 1848, the population was recorded as being 771, with around 80% of the land being farmed. The opening of the Cheshire Lines Railway in 1873 allowed the town to grow as a commuter town: between 1871 and 1901 the population grew by over 650%, from 996 to 6,594.

In agreement with social identity theory, participants evaluated members of the upper class to be more successful, but less moral, than members of <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class.</b> On <b>the</b> other hand, while members of the working class were seen as less successful than members of <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class,</b> they were rated higher on morality. Results also show that participants perceived the relations between <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> and <b>the</b> working class to be more permeable and less legitimate than the relations between <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>class</b> and <b>the</b> upper class.

With all the main parties committed to the Union new nationalist and independent political groupings began to emerge, including the National Party of Scotland in 1928 and Scottish Party in 1930.

5|$|In 1868 popular uprisings {{led to the}} {{overthrow}} of Queen Isabella II of the House of Bourbon. Two distinct factors led to the uprisings: a series of urban riots, and a liberal movement within <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> and the military (led by General Joan Prim), who {{were concerned about the}} ultra-conservatism of the monarchy. In 1873 Isabella's replacement, King Amadeo I of the House of Savoy, abdicated due to increasing political pressure, and the First Spanish Republic was proclaimed. However, the intellectuals behind the Republic were powerless to prevent a descent into chaos. Uprisings were crushed by the military. The old monarchy returned with the restoration of the Bourbons in December 1874, as reform was deemed less important than peace and stability. Despite the introduction of universal male suffrage in 1890, elections were controlled by local political bosses (caciques).|$|E

The industrial revolution led to the increase in both working and middle classes, leading to the building of many new houses, aimed at both classes. The most common form of housing to be built for the working classes was the 'back to back'. Back to back terrace houses were built in the largely working class districts of Harehills, Holbeck, Hunslet, Beeston and Armley, whilst larger through terrace houses were built for <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>classes</b> in Headingley and Kirkstall.

5|$|The Sonderweg {{hypothesis}} attributed Germany's difficult 20th {{century to}} the weak political, legal, and economic basis of the new empire.

Recent research into the role of the Grand Bourgeoisie—which included bankers, merchants, industrialists, and entrepreneurs—in the construction of the new state has largely refuted the claim of political and economic dominance of the Junkers as a social group.

However, Azaña was increasingly isolated from everyday politics; his replacement, Casares Quiroga, was weak. This was a watershed event which inspired conservatives to give up on parliamentary politics. CEDA turned its campaign chest over to army plotter Emilio Mola. Monarchist José Calvo Sotelo replaced CEDA's Gil-Robles as the right's leading spokesman in Parliament.

5|$|The first {{significant}} Scottish portrait artist was George Jameson, who {{became one of}} the most successful painters of the reign of Charles I. He trained the Baroque artist John Michael Wright. In this period the full-length portrait in Highland dress became a common form of painting.

John Alexander and William Mossman painted many of the figures of early-Enlightenment Edinburgh. Allan Ramsay established himself as a leading portrait painter to the Scottish nobility and he undertook portraits of many of the major figures of the Scottish Enlightenment. He later focused on royal portraits, anticipating the grand manner of Joshua Reynolds, but many of his early portraits, particularly of women, are less formal and more intimate.
