Important parameters that influence the extraction efficiency (i. e., fibre type, extraction modes, extraction time, salt addition, desorption time and temperature) were systematically investigated. Four types of commercially available fibres (i. e., 50 / 30 μm divinylbenzene/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (DVB/CAR/PDMS), 65 μm polydimethylsiloxane/divinylbenzene (PDMS/DVB), 100 μm polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), and 85 μm polyacrylate (PA)) were evaluated. PA fibre exhibited the best performance and {{was used for the}} rest of the studies. The optimised extraction conditions were: extraction time, 30 min at room temperature; stirring speed, 1275 rpm; salt content, 10 % NaCl; desorption time and temperature, 11 min at 260 °C; and no pH adjustment of the sample extract. The method was validated over the range 0. 1 – 100 μg/L. Repeatabilities were satisfactory, ranging between 2. 44 % and 17. 9 % for all analytes. The limits of detection and quantitation ranged from 0. 01 to 0. 14 and 0. 03 to 0. 42 μg/L, respectively. The method was applied to twenty local vegetable (cabbage, kale and mustard) products. Chlorpyrifos (0. 22 – 1. 68 μg/kg) was the most detected pesticide in the tested samples.

40|$|AbstractIn humans, the ATP-binding {{cassette}} efflux transporter ABCG 2 {{contributes to}} the fetoprotective barrier function of the placenta, potentially limiting the toxicity of transporter substrates to the fetus. During testing of chemicals including pesticides, developmental toxicity studies are performed in rabbit. Despite its toxicological relevance, ABCG 2 -mediated transport of pesticides in rabbit placenta has not been yet elucidated. We therefore generated polarized MDCK II cells expressing the ABCG 2 transporter from rabbit placenta (rbABCG 2) and evaluated interaction of the efflux transporter with selected insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides. The Hoechst H 33342 accumulation assay indicated that 13 widely used pesticidal active substances including azoxystrobin, carbendazim, chlorpyrifos, chlormequat, diflufenican, dimethoate, dimethomorph, dithianon, ioxynil, methiocarb, propamocarb, rimsulfuron and toclofos-methyl may be rbABCG 2 inhibitors and/or substrates. No such evidence was obtained for chlorpyrifos-methyl, epoxiconazole, glyphosate, imazalil and thiacloprid. Moreover, chlorpyrifos (CPF), dimethomorph, <b>tolclofos-methyl</b> and rimsulfuron showed concentration-dependent inhibition of H 33342 excretion in rbABCG 2 -transduced MDCKII cells. To further evaluate the role of rbABCG 2 in pesticide transport across the placenta barrier, we generated polarized MDCKII-rbABCG 2 monolayers. Confocal microscopy confirmed correct localization of rbABCG 2 protein in the apical plasma membrane. In transepithelial flux studies, we showed the time-dependent preferential basolateral to apical (B>A) directed transport of [14 C] CPF across polarized MDCKII-rbABCG 2 monolayers which was significantly inhibited by the ABCG 2 inhibitor fumitremorgin C (FTC). Using this novel in vitro cell culture model, we altogether showed functional secretory activity of the ABCG 2 transporter from rabbit placenta and identified several pesticides like the insecticide CPF as potential rbABCG 2 substrates...|$|E
40|$|In vitro fungitoxicity {{tests with}} 14 sterol {{biosynthesis}} inhibitors (SBIs) {{showed that the}} SBIs pyrifenox, flusilazol, propiconazole, triflumizole and fenpropimorph applied at the low concentration of 1 µg ml- 1 inhibited the mycelial growth of wild-type and mutant strains of Botrytis cinerea that were resistant to the benzimidazoles, to the dicarboximides and to a mixture of benzimidazole+phenylcarbamate (carbendazim+diethofencarb). The SBIs tested exhibited higher effectiveness against the wild-type and mutant strains of B. cinerea compared with some widely used botryticides, such as the dicarboximides iprodione, procymidone and chlozolinate, the aromatic hydrocarbons quintozene, chloroneb and <b>tolclofos-methyl,</b> and the relatively new fungicides cyprodinil and fenhexamid. Only benomyl and fludioxonil presented higher effectiveness than the SBIs. In planta pot experiments with preventive applications of the commercial products Dorado 20 EC (pyrifenox), Punch 40 EC (flusilazol), Tilt 25 EC (propiconazole), Corbel 75 EC (fenpropimorph) and Trifmine 30 EC (triflumizole) showed that lesions of cucumber seedlings by all the abovementioned strains of B. cinerea were completely inhibited at low SBI concentrations of 0. 05 – 0. 1 g a. i. l- 1. After chemical mutagenesis with N-methyl-N-nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine (MNNG), only strains with low resistance (Rf 6 – 9, based on MIC values) to triadimefon were isolated at a mutation frequency of 3. 9 10 - 5.

Study of fitness of DMI-resistant strains showed that these mutation(s) were pleiotropic, with significant adverse effects on characteristics determining phytopathogenic fitness such as rate of mycelial growth, sporulation, conidial germination and pathogenicity on cucumber seedlings.

40|$|Studies on the {{evaluation}} of separation efficacies are of primary interest to forensic analysts for newly available pesticides. In the present work, a method is described for the separation evaluation of three selected organophosphorus fungicides (OPFs) ditalimfos (D), edifenfos (E), and <b>tolclofos-methyl</b> (TM) by reversed-phase high-performance thin-layer chromatography (RP-HPTLC). The method {{is based on the}} separation of three OPFs on silica gel 60 RP- 18 WF(254) plates with varying mobile phase compositions (10 : 0 - 6 : 4) of methanol-water. The relationship between the mobile phase composition and retention parameters (R-F and R-M) as well as separation parameters (Delta R-F, R-S, alpha, R-F(alpha)) was analyzed. The three OPFs are completely separated from each other with Delta R-F >= 0. 04, except for the pair of compounds E-TM in the mobile phase composition 10 : 0, 7 : 3, 6. 5 : 3. 5, and 6 : 4. Under the chromatographic conditions used, TM was adsorbed the strongest, followed by E and D, which is indicated by the higher R-M values obtained for TM. Peak resolution (R-S) values greater than 1. 5 were obtained over the entire range of mobile phase composition, except for the pair of compounds E-TM. The UV apex of maximum absorption was 200 nm for all the three OPFs as measured by multiwave-length scan in the UV range, and higher values of peak area and peak height were obtained at the same wavelength. The present study clearly indicates that the system of RP-HPTLC with mobile phase methanol-water in a volume composition 8 : 2 (v/v) provides the optimum conditions for the separation of the three OPFs. However, the complete separation of E from TM was not achieved using this system...|$|E
30|$|Dry bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} food legumes for human consumption in the world. Several soil-borne fungi attacked bean plants causing damping-off and root rot/wilt diseases. These diseases were commonly attributed to Fusarium solani (Mart.) Sacc. in complex with Rhizoctonia solani and F. oxysporum (Abdel-Kader 1997; Estevez de Jensen et al. 1999, 2002). The disease incidence of damping-off and bean root rot has risen with the increased acreage of this crop, the shortening of crop rotation intervals, and the use of highly susceptible cultivars. Yield losses in several infested areas approach 50 % (Estevez de Jensen et al. 2002). Biocontrol treatment with certain strains of Trichoderma spp. can be used for controlling several soil-borne diseases such as damping-off, root-rot, and wilt (El-Nagdi and Abd-El-Khair 2014; Woo et al. 2014; Elshahawy et al. 2017 a, 2017 b). Biological control methods are safe and environmentally friendly pesticide alternatives in agriculture application (Elshahawy et al. 2017 c). But biological control alone is sometimes un-sufficient to eradicate or reduce the propagules of the pathogens. Therefore, integration methods between biocontrol agents and the fungicides could be effective. The tolerance of several biocontrol agents to fungicides was studied by many workers over the world (Howell et al. 1997; Wang et al. 2005; Howell 2007; Vasundara et al. 2015; Khalequzzaman 2016). In a previous study, we investigated in vitro the compatibility of ten Trichoderma spp. isolates (three of T. harzianum, three of T. viride, one of T. virens, and three of Trichoderma spp.) with seven fungicides viz., carbendazim, flutolanil, mancozeb, metalaxyl M + mancozeb, pencycuron, thiram + <b>tolclofos-methyl,</b> and thiophanate-methyl (Elshahawya et al. 2016). The results of our investigations revealed that each of flutolanil, pencycuron, and thiophanate-methyl when separately combined with Trichoderma spp. isolates reduced the growth of the tested soil-borne pathogens in the ranges of 22.2 – 100 %, 43.7 – 100 %, and 50.4 – 100 %, compared to the reduction of 0.0 – 21.1 %, 0.0 – 18.9 %, and 15.6 – 18.9 % resulted by the same fungicides when used alone, respectively. Our results suggested that the fungicides-Trichoderma spp. isolate combination may be effective in controlling soil-borne pathogenic fungi than individual treatment and reduced the amount of fungicide used. The results of our investigations revealed that Trichoderma spp. were highly compatible with thiophanate-methyl. Therefore, this work is amid to study the effects of Trichoderma spp. combined with thiophanate-methyl for controlling damping-off and root rot/wilt diseases of bean caused by F. solani and F. oxysporium in a greenhouse and in field experiments.|$|E
40|$|Rhizoctoniasis {{of potato}} occurs in all {{regions of the}} world where the crop is grown. The disease is caused by various {{anastomosis}} groups (AGs) of the fungus Rhizoctonia solani, of which AG- 3 is the most common. Very little information is available on the AGs involved in potato rhizoctoniasis in South Africa. This study elucidated the etiology of the disease in the country and also provided guidelines regarding alternative control strategies. The vast majority (99. 3 %) of R. solani isolates from symptomatic potato tubers collected at seven of the 14 potato production regions in South Africa belonged to AG- 3, and 0. 7 % to AG- 5. Of the isolates from infected stems and roots, 82. 1 % were AG- 3, 12. 8 % AG- 4, and 5. 1 % AG- 5. Isolations from soil yielded 67. 7 % AG- 3, 22. 0 % AG- 4, 5. 5 % AG- 5, and 2. 4 % of each of AG- 7 and AG- 8. In vitro screening indicated that AG- 3 isolates were the most virulent. The progeny of seed tubers naturally infected with R. solani was rendered free of infection by dipping the tubers in hot water at 55 C for 8 minutes, 60 ºC for 6 minutes, or 65 ºC for 4 minutes. However, treatments more severe than 55 ºC for 8 minutes progressively increased tuber mortality. OA 5 DP, an organic tin complex, proved to be the most effective of 20 disinfectants for killing sclerotia of the pathogen on seed tubers and rendering the progeny free of infection, but exhibited acute phytotoxicity towards the tubers. Significant control without any phytotoxicity was achieved with the didecyl ammonium chloride compound, Sporekill. <b>Tolclofos-methyl</b> was the only fungicide that provided total control of potato rhizoctoniasis, whereas seed tuber treatment with fludioxonil, kresoxim-methyl and metam-sodium significantly reduced disease in the progeny. Incorporation of of the biocontrol formulation TrykocideTM (Trichoderma harzianum) into soils artificially infested with R. solani AG- 3 eradicated the pathogen. Significant reductions in pathogen populations were also evident in soils amended with azoxystrobin, kresoxim-methyl, MaxifloTM Azospirillum brasilense), AvogreenTM (Bacillus subtilis), cattle, chicken and sheep manure, citrus and mango waste compost, composted kraal manure, and shoot tissues of Brassica napus, B. oleracea var. capitata, Raphanus sativus, Sinapsis alba and Tagetes minuta. TrykocideTM provided total control of stem canker in artificially infested soil, whereas kresoxim-methyl, azoxystrobin, sheep manure, B. napus and B. oleracea var. capitata shoot tissue, mango waste compost, and the systemic resistance-inducing compound, acibenzolar-s-methyl, reduced the disease significantly.

40|$|Background: Pesticides {{are used}} to control pests and {{diseases}} in modern agriculture but unfortunately their residues {{can be found on}} agricultural crops, and in the human’s dietary. Although the best way to decrease the risk associated with the presence of pesticides on agro-food is following organic farming techniques, most farmers may not avoid the use of chemicals in pest management strategies. A good approach to the problem should therefore guarantee good agricultural yields and low pesticide residues allowing the use of environmental safety pesticides on crops, so joining consumer’s safeness with farmer’s necessity. Results: The behaviour of various pesticides used in IPM strategies on grapes and tomatoes were studied. All the analytical methods showed good recoveries, and good separation of the molecules. Repeatability and intermediate precision showed good results, and LODs and LOQs were far below the MRLs set by EU for these pesticides in tomatoes and grapes. The analysis of pesticide residues on tomatoes showed that cv. with little berries accounted for higher residue levels than cv. with big berries. They also showed an high persistence of azoxystrobin, cyproconazole, cyprodinil, penconazole, <b>tolclofos-methyl,</b> mepanipyrim, pyrimethanil, famoxadone fenamidone, fenhexamid, iprodione, and a rapid degradation of triadimenol, cymoxanil, iprovalicarb, fenarimol, and fludioxonil. On grapes, the behaviour in field and the transfer to wine during winemaking of iprovalicarb, indoxacarb, and boscalid, was studied. The residue levels found in grapes were far below the MRLs set for grapes in EU, accounting at harvest time 0. 81, 0. 43, and 4. 23 mg/kg for iprovalicarb, indoxacarb, and boscalid, respectively. The residue levels in the samples treated with boscalid may have residual problems (due to an accumulation effect) if repeated field treatments will be performed. Winemaking experiments showed a complete transfer of all pesticide from grapes to the must, while in wine the residues were low or negligible due to the adsorbing effect of lees and pomace. The clarification experiments showed a good removal of pesticide residues from the wine media, for all pesticides. The data obtained in two years survey of pesticide residues on wines following IPM strategies, showed residues less than maximum residue limits (MRLs). The most pesticides present a residue absent, some (benalaxyl, metalaxyl, iprovalicarb, penconazole, cymoxanil and thiophanate-metyl) showed a residual below the minimum limit of detection (LOD). No residues were found above the LOQ (0, 01 mg/kg). Conclusions: The obtained data showed the possibility to get tomatoes and wine at "zero residue" or, at least, with residues below the limit of quantification (LOQ). The data collected on tomato have also shown the difference in initial deposition of pesticide joined {{to the size of the}} berries in order to obtain products with lower pesticide residues, paying more attention to chemical treatments for the defense of cultivars with small berries. ...|$|E
