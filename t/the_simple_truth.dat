25|$|When Saddam Hussein {{suppressed}} Kurdish uprisings in 1991, Archer, {{with the}} Red Cross, {{set up the}} charity Simple Truth, a fundraising campaign {{on behalf of the}} Kurds. In May 1991, Archer organised a charity pop concert, starring Rod Stewart, Paul Simon, Sting and Gloria Estefan, who all performed for free. Archer claimed that his charity had raised £57,042,000, though it was later revealed that only £3 million came from <b>the</b> <b>Simple</b> <b>Truth</b> concert and appeal, the rest from aid projects sponsored by the British and other governments, with significant amounts pledged before the concert. The charity would later result in further controversy. Having been previously rejected, Archer was made a life peer on 27 July 1992 as Baron Archer of Weston-super-Mare, of Mark in the County of Somerset. Prime Minister John Major recommended him largely because of Archer's role in aid to the Kurds. Archer and Major had been friends for a number of years.|$|E

[...] It {{follows that}} even among the finite Heyting algebras there exist infinitely many that are subdirectly irreducible, no two of which have the same equational theory. [...] Hence no finite set of finite Heyting algebras can supply all the counterexamples to non-laws of Heyting algebra.

He narrated and was co-executive {{producer}} of the 2007 documentary Sand and Sorrow. Clooney also appeared in the documentary film Darfur Now, a call-to-action film released in November 2007 for {{people all over the world}} to help stop the Darfur crisis. In December 2007, Clooney and fellow actor Don Cheadle received the Summit Peace Award from the Nobel Peace Prize Laureates in Rome. In his acceptance speech, Clooney said that [...] "Don and I … stand here before you as failures. <b>The</b> <b>simple</b> <b>truth</b> is that when it comes to the atrocities in Darfur … those people are not better off now than they were years ago."

2500|$|Addams damned {{war as a}} cataclysm that {{undermined}} human kindness, solidarity, civic friendship, {{and caused}} families across the world to struggle. In turn her views were denounced by patriotic groups and newspapers during World War I (1917–18). Oswald Garrison Villard came to her defense when she suggested that armies gave liquor to soldiers just before major ground attacks. [...] "Take the case of Jane Addams for one. With what abuse did not the [...] Times cover her, one of the noblest of our women, because she told <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> <b>truth</b> that the Allied troops were often given liquor or drugs before charging across No Man's Land. Yet when the facts came out {{at the hands of}} Sir Philip Gibbs and others not one word of apology was ever forthcoming." [...] Even after the war the WILPF's program of peace and disarmament was characterized by opponents as radical, Communist-influenced, unpatriotic, and unfeminine. Young veterans in the American Legion, supported by some members of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) and the League of Women Voters, were ill-prepared to confront the older, better-educated, more financially secure and nationally famous women of the WILPF. Nevertheless, the DAR could and did expel Addams from membership in their organization. The Legion's efforts to portray the WILPF members as dangerously naive females resonated with working class audiences, but President Calvin Coolidge and the middle classes supported Addams and her WILPF efforts in the 1920s to prohibit poison gas and outlaw war. After 1920, however, she was widely regarded as the greatest woman of the Progressive Era. In 1931 the award of the Nobel Peace prize earned her near-unanimous acclaim.|$|E

The pastoral-ecclesiastical metaphor of shepherds and sheep is used extensively as a number of criticisms are made about such things as confession, indulgences, purgatory, tithing and celibacy. The Prayer became important in the sixteenth century, when its themes were taken up by proponents of the Protestant Reformation.|$|R

40|$|Within {{a period}} of two months, and with minimal adverse effects on {{employment}} and the real functioning of the economy, Israel's 1985 stabilization program reduced the annual rate of inflation from close to 500 percent to less than 20 percent (corresponding, respectively, to average compounded monthly rates of 16. 1 and 1. 5 percent) and has maintained that situation until now (1992). The major {{purpose of this paper is}} to use this inflationary experience as an illustration of some of <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> <b>truths</b> of traditional monetary theory. At the same time, this experience also illustrates the advantages of a heterodox policy (that is, one that, in addition to restrictive monetary and fiscal measures, makes temporary use of wage and price controls, often within the context of a "social contract") in bringing an inflationary process to an end. A second purpose is to explain the unique political circumstances that—despite the aforementioned earlier failures—created the credibility that enabled the 1985 program to succeed. ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{church was}} founded in the early 1830s by Samuel Heinrich Fröhlich, a young seminary student in Switzerland, who had {{experienced}} a biblical conversion. Being led of God through a true conversion, he began preaching <b>the</b> <b>simple</b> <b>truths</b> of <b>the</b> Bible. Approximately 110 congregations were formed in 35 years in several European countries. Froehlich's intent was to organize a church based on a literal interpretation of God's Word. He emphasized the scriptural principle, [...] "...teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you." [...] Mt. 28:20 The church, while recognizing Froehlich's work, gives God the glory for all these accomplishments. Froehlich's attitudes and biblical understandings were shaped, in part, by the Sixteenth Century Anabaptists, whose doctrinal motto was [...] "Sola Scriptura." [...] This meant that Scriptures alone constituted the true foundation for doctrine and life-and {{they were to be}} followed. The church has continued over the years to diligently follow New Testament teachings, and to regard the entire Word as infallible and inerrant.|$|R
