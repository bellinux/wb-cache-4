40|$|Intelligent Truck Parking (ITP) {{involves}} {{efficient management}} of information {{as a tool}} for addressing some of the problems related to truck parking, such as, the inability to navigate to, or reserve a parking space. Different telematic services (ITP core services) may be required to address different stakeholder needs, e. g., a navigation service for finding the way to a truck parking area, and a reservation service for assuring the availability of a parking space when in the parking area. In addition to ITP core services, there are several other telematic services that address transport problems in general. If the synergies of different services are taken into account during design and deployment of telematic services, cost reduction may be achieved through functionality sharing. In this article, we have identified services that are relevant for sharing functionalities with ITP core services, estimate functionality costs and perform a synergy analysis to assess the marginal cost savings as a result. Overall results indicates that <b>Traffic</b> <b>Information</b> <b>Broadcasting</b> (TIB), Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) for goods, and Geo-fencing (GEO) can form clusters with ITP core services that could lead to better cost savings compared {{to the rest of the}} services studied.

The <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> system has been defined as well as its organization or management both as of an independent system and as viewed within the scope of the community system of <b>information.</b> The <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> system comprises the information segment designed for meeting the requirements of public <b>information</b> on <b>traffic,</b> and specialized <b>information</b> segment designed for management of the traffic system.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyse {{the impact of}} both radio <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> and {{variable}} message sign information on route choice behaviour. The empirical analysis {{is based on an}} extensive survey held among road users in the Amsterdam corridor in July 1994. The data is stemming from the EC DRIVE II project BATT. To analyse the factors that influence route choice behaviour, several types of discrete choice models (ordered probit, multiple logit and bivariate ordered probit) have been estimated. Bivariate models are needed to model the (endogenous) dependency of the use of radio <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> and variable message sign information. The results confirm earlier findings that women {{are less likely to be}} influenced by <b>traffic</b> <b>information.</b> New is the finding that commuters are less likely to be influenced, and that the level of satisfaction with alternative routes is strongly related to the type and distance of the alternative road. The analysis also reveals that the impacts of radio <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> and variable message sign information on route choice behaviour are very similar, and that route choice adaptations based on radio <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> are positively related to route choice adaptations based on variable message sign information. An interesting issue is the willingness-to-pay for having in-vehicle dynamic <b>traffic</b> <b>information.</b> As expected, the willingness-to-pay is relatively large for male drivers on business trips. Another important new finding is that the results suggest that there is a positive correlation between the use of radio <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> and variable message sign information. ...|$|R

40|$|Traffic {{demand in}} {{emergency}} evacuation is usually {{too large to}} be effectively managed with reactive <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> control methods. These methods adapt to the road traffic passively by publishing real-time information without consideration of the routing behavior feedback produced by evacuees. Other remedy measures {{have to be prepared}} in case of nonrecurring congestion under these methods. To use the network capacity fully to mitigate near-future evacuation traffic congestion, we propose proactive <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> control (PTIC) model. Based on the mechanism between information and routing behavior feedback, this model can change the route choice of evacuees in advance by dissipating strategic <b>traffic</b> <b>information.</b> Generally, the near-future traffic condition is difficult to accurately predict because it is uncertain in evacuation. Assume that the value of <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> obeys certain distribution within a range, and then real-time <b>traffic</b> <b>information</b> may reflect the most-likely near-future traffic condition.
