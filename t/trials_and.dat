40|$|Abstract: Lavoie (1985) {{argues that}} the <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> error {{solution}} to the Socialist Calculation problem constitutes an illegitimate simulation of markets. This paper argues that Mises rejected the Taylor-Lange <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> error proposal as irrelevant. Mises (1949) pointed to competition in financial markets as the only relevant <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> error process. The <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> error process in financial markets directs capital investment towards the most urgent consumer demands, and also tests the ability of entrepreneurs to speculate. Lange and Taylor overlooked the fact that Mises dismissed their <b>trial</b> <b>and</b> error method {{at the outset of}} the debate, and postwar scholars of the calculation debate have underemphasized the role of financial markets in the Mises-Hayek paradigm...|$|R
