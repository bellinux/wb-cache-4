25|$|By {{the end of}} {{the eighteenth}} century, a major shift in fashion was taking place that {{extended}} beyond changes in mere style to changes in philosophical and social ideals.

Instead, one’s identity was considered malleable; subject to change depending on what clothes one was wearing. However, by the 1780s, the new, “natural” style allowed one’s inner self to transcend their clothes.|$|E

The aim is to identify <b>the</b> <b>conceptualizations</b> <b>of</b> quality in higher education that underlie the use of different concepts such as efficiency and equity. Based on publications by important multilateral organizations, these terms are correlated with <b>the</b> <b>conceptualizations</b> <b>of</b> higher education and, at the political level, with two major contemporary socioeconomic models: neoliberalism and social welfare state. Finally, two ideological tendencies for the understanding of quality in higher education are presented: quality as productivity and quality as social responsibility...|$|R

25|$|The Open Source Movement is {{branched}} {{from the}} free software movement {{which began in the}} late 80s with the launching of the GNU project by Richard Stallman. Stallman is regarded within the open source community as sharing a key role in <b>the</b> <b>conceptualization</b> <b>of</b> freely shared source code for software development. The term “free software” in the free software movement is meant to imply freedom of software exchange and modification. The term does not refer to any monetary freedom. Both the free software movement and the open source movement share this view of free exchange of programming code, and this is often why both of the movements are sometimes referenced in literature as part of the FOSS or “Free and Open Software” or FLOSS “Free/Libre Open Source” communities.|$|E
25|$|Several {{studies have}} been {{conducted}} regarding the potential of applying virtual reality to different therapies. A systematic literature review published in 2012 analyzed 963 publications regarding virtual reality and rehabilitation from 1996 and 2010. Investigators found an increasing number of research done in the field yearly, from less than 10 articles per year in 1997 to more than 40 in 2010. More than the number of articles analyzed, this literature review found important issues to be addressed in future studies: i) the need to consider a greater number of participants in each study to best represent the target populations; ii) to improve the use of control groups; iii) to enhance the uniformity of the tests applied and iv) to execute more follow up studies in the field. These aspects would allow the comparison among different studies and <b>the</b> <b>conceptualization</b> <b>of</b> the results from different studies. Lastly, this investigation cites the importance of research in the field of virtual reality and rehabilitation, once the potential of this technology is recognized to support the neural and cognitive rehabilitation of different patients.|$|E

500|$|Beyond {{medical ethics}} and bioethics, the {{philosophy}} of medicine is a branch of philosophy that includes the epistemology and ontology/metaphysics of medicine. Within the epistemology of medicine, evidence-based medicine (EBM) (or evidence-based practice (EBP)) has attracted attention, most notably the roles of randomisation, blinding and placebo controls. Related to these areas of investigation, ontologies of specific interest to {{the philosophy of}} medicine include Cartesian dualism, the monogenetic conception of disease and <b>the</b> <b>conceptualization</b> <b>of</b> 'placebos' and 'placebo effects'. There is also a growing interest in the metaphysics of medicine, particularly the idea of causation. [...] Philosophers of medicine might not only be interested in how medical knowledge is generated, {{but also in the}} nature of such phenomena. Causation is of interest because the purpose of much medical research is to establish causal relationships, e.g. what causes disease, or what causes people to get better.|$|E

In fact, fairness is viewed from a completely different perspective in dynamic assessment in which instruction and assessment are integrated and dialectically related to form an approach which prioritizes development over measurement. </p...|$|R
