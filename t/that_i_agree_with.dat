2500|$|Despite {{their many}} {{disagreements}} Brooke and Churchill held an affection for each other. After one fierce clash Churchill told {{his chief of}} staff and military adviser, Sir Hastings Ismay, that he did not think he could continue to work any longer with Brooke because [...] "he hates me. I can see hatred looking from his eyes." [...] Brooke responded to Ismay: “Hate him? I don't hate him. I love him. But the first time I tell him <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> him when I don't will be the time to get rid of me, for then I can be no more use to him." [...] When Churchill was told this he murmured, ”Dear Brookie.” ...|$|E

[...] "It is true, he is English; that he fancies an advantage, as does Corny Littlepage, here; {{but we must}} make proper {{allowances}} for home-love and foreign-dislike." ...|$|E
60|$|They'd make a face, but they'd swallow {{me right}} enough. And when I asked {{them down to}} the best shoot in England they'd come to the {{conclusion}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> them very well.|$|R
5000|$|... “Very soon <b>I</b> {{realized}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> Mr. Ahmadinejad’s goals but {{not with}} his policies,” Mr. Khoshchehreh said recently. “My first criticism was that you cannot run the country with projects. You have to have plans and policies.” ...|$|R
60|$|I {{told the}} captain <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> him <b>that</b> the British were the scum of Europe, the westward drift {{of all the}} people, a disgusting rabble, and I lost three pounds by {{attenuated}} retail to Pollack at ha'penny nap and euchre.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well! Perhaps {{that is your}} opinion, but I can't say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you. I don't see why she shouldn't take me. I {{can give}} her a {{position}} which you may call Al out of the Peerage. I can bring her into society. I can make an English lady of her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you, Mike. In Ireland, {{we should}} find tens of {{thousands}} of brave hearts ready to join us, but they are unarmed, undrilled, and undisciplined, and would be of comparatively slight assistance to us against the English troops. Defeat would bring down fresh persecutions, fresh confiscations, and greater misery upon the land." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The Marquis {{has thought}} it better not, and I must say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> the Marquis."

[...] "I believe I am justified in assuring you that anything you would have said to the Marquis you may say to me." ...|$|E

[...] He was thoughtfully silent a moment; then he said, [...] "But if their decision is to have no weight with us, I think he ought to be told at once." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2009, Duff stated, [...] "I am a Christian, but I also don't {{really see}} myself as a {{religious}} person. I {{see myself as}} more of a spiritual person. There {{are a lot of things}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> in Christianity and things <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>agree</b> <b>with.</b> I'm not a regular churchgoer, but <b>I</b> do think <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have my own beliefs <b>that</b> <b>I</b> feel strongly about." ...|$|R
6000|$|Annie {{felt the}} blood fly to her head, and she {{waited a moment}} to regain her coolness. [...] "I wonder you came to ask me, Mrs. Munger, if you were so sure <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> you. I'm {{certainly}} Mr. and Mrs. Putney's friend, and so far as admiring Mr. Peck's sincerity and goodness is concerned, I'm his friend. But I'm obliged to say that you're mistaken about the rest." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Jeff," [...] she wrote, [...] "in {{regard to}} your strictures on war I have [...] only to say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you, as I {{have always done}} on all [...] points, heart and soul.

6000|$|She fronted me, after all, {{still so}} bravely that I {{believed}} her {{for an instant}} not to be, on this article, without an answer she could produce. The unexpected therefore broke for me when she fairly produced none. [...] "I confess I don't make out," [...] she simply said, [...] "while you seem so little pleased <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you," [...] {{answered}} Sir Robert. [...] "I am {{not sure}} {{that in the long run}} we should not do better for a little more of the article. For my part, although it will not hurt us publicly, for the thing will never be noticed, I am sorry that we have lost Vernon, very sorry indeed. I don't think him a fool, and awkward as they may be, I respect his qualities." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] said Grace, [...] "his opinion {{would be}} of great value. It wouldn't be at all {{essential}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> should <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> him:' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I regret <b>that</b> <b>I</b> cannot <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you. <b>I</b> devoutly wish I could," [...] said Geoffrey, uneasily. [...] "No! {{you must}} please go no further, Miss Savine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Harry; kiss me, Harry. I was so {{glad you}} sent a word. Promise me, Harry, not to think <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you in every thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then after a swift {{silence that}} {{took them out}} across St. James's Park, he said: [...] "The people must be taught to obey; they must learn their own ignorance. And I am not sure," [...] he continued, turning his back on Evan and looking out of the prow of the ship into the darkness, [...] "I am not sure <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> your little maxim about justice. Discipline for the whole society is surely more {{important}} than justice to an individual." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 877. The {{identity}} of the force constituting the voltaic current or electrolytic agent, with that which holds the elements of electrolytes together (855.), or in other words with chemical affinity, seemed {{to indicate that the}} electricity of the pile itself was merely a mode of exertion, or exhibition, or existence of true chemical action, or rather of its cause; and I have consequently already said <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> those who believe that the supply of electricity is due to chemical powers (857.).|$|E
60|$|Dear Lady Violet,--I am {{not sure}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you in your admiration of Rochefoucauld--of the Reflexions, ou Sentences et Maximes Morales, I mean. At least, I hardly agree when I have read many of them at a stretch. It is not fair to read them in that way, of course, for {{there are more than}} five hundred pensees, and so much esprit becomes fatiguing. I doubt if people study them much. Five or six of them have become known even to writers in the newspapers, and we all copy them from each other.|$|E
6000|$|... "Jeff, my boy," [...] {{returned}} Nicholas, with a smile, [...] "I'm too sleepy {{to discuss}} that subject just now, further than to say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He had {{described}} his household {{to me before}} I went there. He lived with a faithful servant, a countryman of his own, who looked after all his needs. This fellow could speak English and did his housekeeping for him. Then there was a wonderful cook, he said, a half-breed whom he had picked up in his travels, who could serve an excellent dinner. <b>I</b> remember <b>that</b> he remarked what a queer household it was {{to find in the}} heart of Surrey, and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> him, though it has proved a good deal queerer than I thought.|$|R
6000|$|She {{met this}} {{imputation}} with the quickest amusement. [...] "I beg your pardon. I don't think I shall {{tell you anything}} of the sort. <b>I</b> don't know <b>that</b> <b>I</b> even <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> your premiss." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> those English {{people who}} say that an English jury would have {{condemned}} her.... I have no doubt that she was guilty. She may not have committed that awful deed herself. Some one in the Charlotte Square house may have been her accomplice and killed and robbed Lady Donaldson while Edith Crawford waited outside for the jewels. David Graham left his godmother at 8.30 p.m. If the accomplice was one of the servants in the house, he or she would have had plenty of time for any amount of villainy, and Edith Crawford could have yet caught the 9.10 p.m. train from the Caledonian Station." ...|$|E
60|$|I have {{carefully}} reconsidered all {{the points}} on which my conclusions have been assailed. But I have not {{to announce a}} change of opinion on any matter of importance. Such minor oversights as have been detected, either by myself or by my critics, I have, in general silently, corrected: {{but it is not}} to be inferred <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> the objections which have been made to a passage, in every instance in which I have altered or canceled it. I have often done so, merely that it might not remain a stumbling-block, when the amount of discussion necessary to place the matter in its true light would have exceeded what was suitable to the occasion.|$|E
6000|$|... "Where's the niceness then? If {{a man has}} {{his time}} at his command and has studied the art of {{legislation}} it may be nice, because he will be doing his duty;--or {{if he wants to}} get into the government ruck like your brother-in-law, it may be nice;--or if he be an idle man with a large fortune it may be nice to have some place to go to. But why it should be nice for Ferdinand Lopez I cannot understand. Everett has some idea in his head when he talks about Parliament,--though I cannot say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> him." [...] It may easily be understood that after this Emily would say nothing further in Manchester Square as to her husband's prospects at Silverbridge.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can't <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you there," [...] Lutchester observed. [...] "I should {{consider}} Henry's a remarkably cosmopolitan restaurant, {{where a man}} in your position should exercise more than even ordinary restraint." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In <b>that</b> <b>I</b> entirely <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you," [...] {{returned}} Mr. Sharp who {{was perfectly}} calm, though evidently distressed. [...] "I may be mistaken, and wish your opinion. All on board but us two {{are in a}} profound sleep." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "And now," [...] said Sir Ferdinando, [...] "that {{this matter}} is settled between us, allow me most cordially to shake {{you by the}} hand, and to express my great admiration for your character. I cannot say <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you in theory as to the Fixed Period,--my wife and {{children}} could not, I am sure, endure to see me led away when a certain day should come,--but I can understand that much may be said on the point, and I admire greatly the eloquence and energy which you have devoted to the matter. I shall be happy to meet you here at any hour to-morrow, and to receive the Britannulan archives from your hands. You, Mr Neverbend, will always {{be regarded as the}} father of your country-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you entirely, my child," [...] resumed the clergyman; [...] "and {{were it not}} {{for this}} {{movement}} connected with the rents, and the false principles that have been so boldly announced of late years, I might have taken on myself the authority, as rector, to remove the hatchments. Even according to the laws connected with the use of such things, they should have been taken away a generation or two back. As to the pew, it is a different matter. It is private property; was constructed with the church, which was built itself by the joint liberality of the Littlepages and mother Trinity; {{and it would be a}} most ungracious act to undertake to destroy it under such circumstances, and more especially in the absence of its owner." ...|$|E
6000|$|Dr. Seward {{seemed to}} answer them both in a dreamy kind of way, [...] "I don't know but <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> you. If that man had been an {{ordinary}} lunatic I would have taken my chance of trusting him, but he seems so mixed up with the Count in an indexy kind of way that I am afraid of doing anything wrong by helping his fads. I can't forget how he prayed with almost equal fervor for a cat, {{and then tried to}} tear my throat out with his teeth. Besides, he called the Count 'lord and master', and he may want to get out to help him in some diabolical way. That horrid thing has the wolves and the rats and his own kind to help him, so I suppose he isn't above trying to use a respectable lunatic. He certainly did seem earnest, though. I only hope we have done what is best. These things, in conjunction with the wild work we have in hand, help to unnerve a man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Supposing," [...] he said, {{dropping}} his voice a little, [...] "supposing I were {{to tell you}}, young man, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> entirely <b>agreed</b> <b>with</b> your friend? Supposing I were to tell you that, possibly by accident, he has stumbled upon the exact truth? What would you say then?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now, Philip, you had best go {{down and}} see your uncle, and thank him for his good {{intentions}} towards you. Tell him <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wholly <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> his plans, and that if he and your aunt will come up this evening, we will enter farther into them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Before you go," [...] {{she went}} on in her slow voice, [...] "I should like to say, uncle, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> quite <b>agree</b> <b>with</b> Morris. <b>I</b> don't think those tables are quite the place to take young ladies to, {{especially}} if the gentleman with them is much engaged in play." ...|$|R
