5|$|A {{person with}} Tourette's has about a 50% chance of passing <b>the</b> <b>gene(s)</b> {{to one of}} his or her children, but Tourette's is a {{condition}} of variable expression and incomplete penetrance. Thus, not everyone who inherits the genetic vulnerability will show symptoms; even close family members may show different severities of symptoms, or no symptoms at all. <b>The</b> <b>gene(s)</b> may express as Tourette's, as a milder tic disorder (provisional or chronic tics), or as obsessive–compulsive symptoms without tics. Only a minority of the children who inherit <b>the</b> <b>gene(s)</b> have symptoms severe enough to require medical attention. Gender appears to have a role in the expression of the genetic vulnerability: males are more likely than females to express tics.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{variability}} of the mallard's genetic code, which gives it its vast interbreeding capability, mutations in <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> that decide plumage colour are very common and {{have resulted in a}} wide variety of hybrids such as Brewer's duck (mallard × gadwall, Anas strepera).|$|E
40|$|A frog alpha-tubulin cDNA and a frog alpha-tubulin gene, {{closely related}} to the cDNA, were cloned and sequenced and the {{structure}} of <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> deduced. <b>The</b> <b>gene</b> was introduced into mouse L-cells in order to investigate the transcription and regulation of <b>the</b> <b>gene.</b> <b>The</b> <b>gene</b> was transcribed and there was processing of the transcripts. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> displayed <b>the</b> correct autoregulatory feedback control...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>gene</b> {{is located}} on {{chromosome}} 19 at p13.3 on the forward strand. <b>The</b> <b>gene</b> is 4041 base pairs in length and contains 29 exons. <b>The</b> <b>gene</b> is neighbored by <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> SIRT6 that encodes for the Sirtuin-6 protein and <b>the</b> EBI3 <b>gene</b> that encodes for the Epstein-Barr virus induced gene 3 protein.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>gene</b> has 9 {{different}} identified promoter regions, which correlate to {{the various}} isoforms of <b>the</b> <b>gene.</b> <b>The</b> promoter for the primary transcript of <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> has binding sites {{for a variety of}} different transcription factors.|$|R
5|$|Polymorphisms (normal variations) in {{particular}} genes {{have been linked}} with {{an increased risk of}} severe dengue complications. Examples include <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> coding for the proteins known as TNFα, mannan-binding lectin, CTLA4, TGFβ, DC-SIGN, PLCE1, and particular forms of human leukocyte antigen from gene variations of HLA-B. A common genetic abnormality, especially in Africans, known as glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, appears to increase the risk. Polymorphisms in <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> for the vitamin D receptor and FcγR seem to offer protection against severe disease in secondary dengue infection.|$|E
5|$|Some {{mitochondrial}} {{functions are}} performed only in {{specific types of}} cells. For example, mitochondria in liver cells contain enzymes {{that allow them to}} detoxify ammonia, a waste product of protein metabolism. A mutation in <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> regulating any of these functions can result in mitochondrial diseases.|$|E
5|$|The Amanita Genome Project {{was begun}} in Jonathan Walton's lab at Michigan State University in 2004 {{as part of}} their ongoing studies of Amanita bisporigera. The purpose of the project is to {{determine}} <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> and genetic controls associated with the formation of mycorrhizae, and to elucidate the biochemical mechanisms of toxin production. The genome of A.bisporigera has been sequenced using a combination of automated Sanger sequencing and pyrosequencing, and the genome sequence information is publicly searchable. The sequence data enabled the researchers to identify <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> responsible for amatoxin and phallotoxin biosynthesis, AMA1 and PHA1. The cyclic peptides are synthesized on ribosomes, and require proline-specific peptidases from the prolyl oligopeptidase family for processing.|$|E
50|$|The {{next step}} is to isolate <b>the</b> {{candidate}} <b>gene.</b> <b>The</b> cell containing <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> is opened and the DNA is purified. <b>The</b> <b>gene</b> is separated by using restriction enzymes to cut the DNA into fragments or polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify up <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> segment. These segments can then be extracted through gel electrophoresis. If <b>the</b> chosen <b>gene</b> or <b>the</b> donor organism's genome has been well studied it may already be accessible from a genetic library. If the DNA sequence is known, but no copies of <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> are available, it can also be artificially synthesized. Once isolated <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> is ligated into a plasmid that is then inserted into a bacterium. The plasmid is replicated when the bacteria divide, ensuring unlimited copies of <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> are available.|$|R

5|$|Another {{potential}} health problem is {{spinal muscular atrophy}} (SMA), another genetically inherited disease which causes {{the loss of the}} spinal-cord neurons which activate the skeletal muscles of the trunk and limbs. Symptoms are normally seen within 3–4 months of age and result in muscle atrophy, muscle weakness, and a shortened life span. A test is offered to detect <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> responsible for SMA.|$|E
5|$|Ants {{identify}} kin and nestmates {{through their}} scent, {{which comes from}} hydrocarbon-laced secretions that coat their exoskeletons. If an ant is separated from its original colony, it will eventually lose the colony scent. Any ant that enters a colony without a matching scent will be attacked. Also, the reason why two separate colonies of ants will attack each other {{even if they are}} of the same species is because <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> responsible for pheromone production are different between them. The Argentine ant, however, does not have this characteristic, due to lack of genetic diversity, and has become a global pest because of it.|$|E
50|$|If the DNA {{sequence}} of <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> and <b>the</b> organism is known, restriction enzymes can cut the DNA {{on either side}} of <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> and gel electrophoresis can sort the fragments according to length. The DNA band at the correct size should contain <b>the</b> <b>gene,</b> where it can be excised from the gel. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to amplify <b>the</b> <b>gene,</b> which can then be isolated through gel electrophoresis. It is also possible to synthesize <b>the</b> <b>gene.</b>|$|R
40|$|The in vivo {{function}} of <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> 2 protein of bacteriophage T 7 has been examined. <b>The</b> <b>gene</b> 2 protein appears to modulate {{the activity of}} <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> 3 endonuclease {{in order to prevent}} the premature degradation of any newly-formed DNA concatemers. This modulation is not however a direct interacton between the two proteins. In single-burst experiments rifamycin can substitute for <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> 2 protein, allowing formation of fast-sedimenting replicative DNA intermediates and progeny phage production. This suggests that the sole {{function of}} <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> 2 protein is inhibition of the host RNA polymerase and that the latter enzyme directs or promotes the endonucleolytic action of <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> 3 protein...|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>gene</b> for <b>the</b> LHCGR {{is found}} on {{chromosome}} 2 p21 in humans, close to <b>the</b> FSH receptor <b>gene.</b> It consists of 70 kbp (versus 54 kpb for <b>the</b> FSHR). <b>The</b> <b>gene</b> {{is similar to}} <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> for <b>the</b> FSH receptor and the TSH receptor.|$|R
5|$|Bill McGinnis quickly {{discovered}} homeotic gene sequences, homeoboxes, in animals in other phyla, in vertebrates such as frogs, birds, and mammals; they were later {{also found in}} fungi such as yeasts, and in plants. There were evidently strong similarities in <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> that controlled development across all the eukaryotes.|$|E
5|$|Biology {{has largely}} {{rejected}} the idea that evolution is guided in any way, but the evolution of some features is indeed facilitated by <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> of the developmental-genetic toolkit studied in evolutionary developmental biology. An example {{is the development of}} wing pattern in some species of Heliconius butterfly, which have independently evolved similar patterns. These butterflies are Müllerian mimics of each other, so natural selection is the driving force, but their wing patterns, which arose in separate evolutionary events, are controlled by the same genes.|$|E
5|$|E. coli {{encompasses}} {{an enormous}} population of bacteria that exhibit {{a very high}} degree of both genetic and phenotypic diversity. Genome sequencing {{of a large number}} of isolates of E. coli and related bacteria shows that a taxonomic reclassification would be desirable. However, this has not been done, largely due to its medical importance, and E. coli remains one of the most diverse bacterial species: only 20% of <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> in a typical E. coli genome is shared among all strains.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>gene</b> expresses two {{transcript}} variants. In humans, <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> CYP19, {{located on}} chromosome 15q21.1, encodes the aromatase enzyme. <b>The</b> <b>gene</b> has nine coding exons {{and a number}} of alternative non-coding first exons that regulate tissue specific expression.|$|R
50|$|FourU {{are found}} in the 5' untranslated region of <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> for heat shock protein Salmonella agsA, they repress {{translation}} of this protein by base-pairing the Shine-Dalgardo sequence of <b>the</b> <b>gene's</b> mRNA.

50|$|Gene-based {{vaccines}} {{are composed}} of the nucleic acid (DNA/RNA) encoding for <b>the</b> <b>gene.</b> <b>The</b> <b>gene</b> is then expressed in APCs and the resulting protein product is processed into epitopes.

5|$|Following {{activation}} with antigen, B cells {{begin to}} proliferate rapidly. In these rapidly dividing cells, <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> encoding the variable domains {{of the heavy}} and light chains undergo {{a high rate of}} point mutation, by a process called somatic hypermutation (SHM). SHM results in approximately one nucleotide change per variable gene, per cell division. As a consequence, any daughter B cells will acquire slight amino acid differences in the variable domains of their antibody chains.|$|E
5|$|For {{much of the}} 20th century, prokaryotes were {{regarded}} as a single group of organisms and classified based on their biochemistry, morphology and metabolism. For example, microbiologists tried to classify microorganisms based on the structures of their cell walls, their shapes, and the substances they consume. In 1965, Emile Zuckerkandl and Linus Pauling proposed instead using the sequences of <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> in different prokaryotes to work out how they are related to each other. This approach, known as phylogenetics, is the main method used today.|$|E
5|$|Genes with a {{most recent}} common ancestor, {{and thus a}} shared {{evolutionary}} ancestry, are known as homologs. These genes appear either from gene duplication within an organism's genome, where they are known as paralogous genes, or {{are the result of}} divergence of <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> after a speciation event, where they are known as orthologous genes, and often perform the same or similar functions in related organisms. It is often assumed that the functions of orthologous genes are more similar than those of paralogous genes, although the difference is minimal.|$|E
50|$|Although Dawkins {{agrees that}} groups can assist {{survival}}, they rank as a 'vehicle' for survival {{only if the}} group activity is replicated in descendants, recorded in <b>the</b> <b>gene,</b> <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> being <b>the</b> only true replicator. An improvement in the survival lottery for the group must improve that for <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> for sufficient replication to occur. Dawkins argues qualitatively that the lottery for <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> is based upon a very long and broad record of events, and group advantages are usually too specific, too brief, and too fortuitous to change <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> lottery.|$|R

40|$|Aerobic phenotypes show a wide {{variability}} {{to similar}} aerobic training stimuli, {{which can be}} partly attributed to heritability. Endothelial function affects aerobic power.

5|$|Genetic {{mutations}} in the L-type calcium channel α1-subunit (Cav1.1) {{have been described}} in Southern Chinese with TPP. The mutations are located in {{a different part of}} the gene from those described in the related condition familial periodic paralysis. In TPP, the mutations described are single-nucleotide polymorphisms located in the hormone response element responsive to thyroid hormone, implying that transcription of the gene and production of ion channels may be altered by increased thyroid hormone levels. Furthermore, mutations have been reported in <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> coding for potassium voltage-gated channel, Shaw-related subfamily, member 4 (Kv3.4) and sodium channel protein type 4 subunit alpha (Na41.4).|$|E
5|$|Gram-positive {{bacteria}} usually develop {{resistance to}} linezolid {{as the result}} of a point mutation known as G2576T, in which a guanine base is replaced with thymine in base pair 2576 of <b>the</b> <b>genes</b> coding for 23S ribosomal RNA. This is the most common mechanism of resistance in staphylococci, and the only one known to date in isolates of E. faecium. Other mechanisms have been identified in Streptococcus pneumoniae (including mutations in an RNA methyltransferase that methylates G2445 of the 23S rRNA and mutations causing increased expression of ABC transporter genes) and in Staphylococcus epidermidis.|$|E
5|$|In animals, the {{mitochondrial}} genome {{is typically}} a single circular chromosome that is approximately 16 kb long and has 37 genes. <b>The</b> <b>genes,</b> while highly conserved, may vary in location. Curiously, {{this pattern is}} {{not found in the}} human body louse (Pediculus humanus). Instead, this mitochondrial genome is arranged in 18 minicircular chromosomes, each of which is 3–4 kb long and has one to three genes. This pattern is also found in other sucking lice, but not in chewing lice. Recombination has been shown to occur between the minichromosomes. The reason for this difference is not known.|$|E
50|$|Another {{limitation}} is that conventional (i.e. non-conditional) knockout mice {{develop in the}} absence of <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> being investigated. At times, loss of activity during development may mask the role of <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> in <b>the</b> adult state, especially if <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> is involved in numerous processes spanning development. Conditional/inducible mutation approaches are then required that first allow the mouse to develop and mature normally prior to ablation of <b>the</b> <b>gene</b> of interest.|$|R
