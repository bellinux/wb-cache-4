5|$|A {{solar eclipse}} (as {{seen from the}} planet Earth) {{is a type of}} eclipse that occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, and when the Moon fully or {{partially}} blocks ("occults") the Sun. This can happen only at new moon when the Sun and the Moon are in conjunction as seen from Earth in an alignment referred to as syzygy. In a total eclipse, the disk of <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> fully obscured by the Moon. In partial and annular eclipses, only part of <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> obscured.|$|E
5|$|Afternoon is a {{time when}} <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>is</b> {{descending}} from its daytime peak. During the afternoon, the sun moves from roughly the center of the sky to deep in the west. In late afternoon, sunlight is particularly bright and glaring, because <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>is</b> at a low angle in the sky. The standard working time in most industrialized countries goes from the morning to the late afternoon or evening—archetypally, 9 am to 5 pm—so the latter part of this time takes place in the afternoon. Schools usually let out during the afternoon as well.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the year {{different}} sections of the rod serve as the style, which is the part of the gnomon that indicates the time by casting its shadow on the dial face. At the summer solstice, when <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> highest (farthest above the equatorial plane), the style is closest to the top of the rod, and at the winter solstice, when <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> lowest, it is closest to the bottom. At the equinoxes, when <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> on the equatorial plane, the style is exactly in the center of the length of the rod. The style of the equatorial sundial is parallel to the Earth's axis of rotation.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>was</b> also <b>the</b> sect ruler—or the {{luminary}} of sect for all charts {{of events}} and individuals born in the daytime, when <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>was</b> over <b>the</b> horizon; and the Moon was the sect ruler or luminary of sect for night charts, when <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>was</b> below <b>the</b> horizon.|$|R
25|$|In summary, Birkat Hachama is recited {{when the}} halachic vernal equinox (the {{position}} at which <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>was</b> created) occurs at sundown on a Tuesday (the time at which <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>was</b> created).|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>sun</b> <b>was</b> coming. There was a quivering, a {{powerful}} terrifying swim of molten light. Then the molten source itself surged forth, revealing itself. <b>The</b> <b>sun</b> <b>was</b> in <b>the</b> sky, too powerful to look at.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> a G-type main-sequence star. It {{contains}} almost 99.9percent of all {{the mass}} in the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> a G2V star, with G2 {{indicating}} {{its surface}} temperature of approximately 5,778K (5,505°C, 9,941°F), and V that it, like most stars, is a main-sequence star. The average luminance of <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> about 1.88gigacandela per square metre, but as viewed through Earth's atmosphere, this is lowered to about 1.44Gcd/m2. However, the luminance is not constant across the disk of the Sun (limb darkening).|$|E
5|$|The Sun's {{color is}} white, with a CIE color-space index near (0.3, 0.3), {{when viewed from}} space or when <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> high in the sky. When {{measuring}} all the photons emitted, <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> actually emitting more photons in the green portion of the spectrum than any other. When <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> low in the sky, atmospheric scattering renders the Sun yellow, red, orange, or magenta. Despite its typical whiteness, most people mentally picture the Sun as yellow; {{the reasons for this}} are the subject of debate.|$|E
50|$|Around <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>was</b> a {{commercial}} and critical failure, and band members later expressed disappointment in the album after the tour ended. A majority of material from Around <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>was</b> largely absent in their subsequent tour.|$|R
50|$|The 1982 - 83 Phoenix <b>Suns</b> season <b>was</b> <b>the</b> 15th {{season for}} <b>the</b> Phoenix <b>Suns</b> of <b>the</b> National Basketball Association. <b>The</b> <b>Suns</b> <b>were</b> in <b>the</b> {{playoffs for the}} sixth {{consecutive}} season, extending a then-franchise record. <b>The</b> <b>Suns</b> <b>were</b> eliminated in <b>the</b> first round two games to one by the Denver Nuggets, a team they had beaten by the same margin a year earlier. <b>The</b> <b>Suns</b> <b>were</b> led by head coach John MacLeod and played all home games in Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum.|$|R
50|$|The {{published}} Silmarillion {{states that}} <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>was</b> created by <b>the</b> Vala Aulë; {{he and his}} people made a vessel to hold the radiance of the last fruit of Laurelin. The vessel of <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>was</b> guided by Arien, a Maia.|$|R
5|$|The energy {{generation}} of <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> based upon thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium. This {{occurs in the}} core region of the star using the proton–proton chain reaction process. Because there is no convection in the solar core, the helium concentration builds up in that region without being distributed throughout the star. The temperature {{at the core of}} <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> too low for nuclear fusion of helium atoms through the triple-alpha process, so these atoms do not contribute to the net {{energy generation}} that is needed to maintain hydrostatic equilibrium of the Sun.|$|E
5|$|The heliosphere, the tenuous {{outermost}} {{atmosphere of}} <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> <b>is</b> {{filled with the}} solar wind plasma. This outermost layer of <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> defined to begin at the distance where {{the flow of the}} solar wind becomes superalfvénic—that is, where the flow becomes faster than the speed of Alfvén waves, at approximately 20 solar radii (0.1 AU).|$|E
5|$|This type of sundial {{is known}} as an {{equatorial}} sundial because {{the plane of the}} dial face is parallel to the Earth's equatorial plane. Two primary examples of modified equatorial sundials are bowstring equatorial and armillary dials. Both of these modified equatorial sundials can be read year-round on the same surface, regardless of whether <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> above or below the equatorial plane whereas a standard equatorial sundial changes sides with each equinox and is virtually unreadable near the equinoxes when <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> located on the equatorial plane.|$|E
25|$|The {{swastika}} {{was widespread}} among the Illyrians, symbolizing <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Sun</b> cult <b>was</b> <b>the</b> main Illyrian cult; <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>was</b> {{represented by a}} swastika in clockwise motion, and it stood for the movement of <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b>|$|R
25|$|The first X-ray {{telescope}} in astronomy {{was used to}} observe <b>the</b> <b>Sun.</b> <b>The</b> first X-ray picture (taken with a grazing incidence telescope) of <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>was</b> taken in 1963, by a rocket-borne telescope. On April 19, 1960 the very first X-ray image of <b>the</b> <b>sun</b> <b>was</b> taken using a pinhole camera on an Aerobee-Hi rocket.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>was</b> a New York {{newspaper}} {{that was published}} from 1833 until 1950. It was considered a serious paper, like the city's two more successful broadsheets, The New York Times and the New York Herald Tribune. <b>The</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> most politically conservative of the three.|$|R
5|$|Analyzing deep-infrared images {{obtained}} by the Spitzer Space Telescope and Gemini North telescope, astronomers discovered {{that one of the}} cluster's stars – HD 23514, which has a mass and luminosity a bit greater than that of <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> <b>is</b> surrounded by an extraordinary number of hot dust particles. This could be evidence for planet formation around HD 23514.|$|E
5|$|During a total solar eclipse, {{when the}} disk of <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> covered {{by that of}} the Moon, parts of the Sun's {{surrounding}} atmosphere can be seen. It is composed of four distinct parts: the chromosphere, the transition region, the corona and the heliosphere.|$|E
5|$|Elemental abundances in the {{photosphere}} {{are well}} known from spectroscopic studies, but {{the composition of the}} interior of <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> more poorly understood. A solar wind sample return mission, Genesis, was designed to allow astronomers to directly measure the composition of solar material.|$|E

5|$|Halley's {{orbital period}} has varied between 74–79 years since 240 BC. Its orbit around <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> highly elliptical, with an orbital {{eccentricity}} of 0.967 (with 0 being {{a circle and}} 1 being a parabolic trajectory). The perihelion, {{the point in the}} comet's orbit when it is nearest <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> <b>is</b> just 0.6 AU. This is between the orbits of Mercury and Venus. Its aphelion, or farthest distance from <b>the</b> <b>Sun,</b> <b>is</b> 35 AU (roughly the distance of Pluto). Unusual for an object in the Solar System, Halley's orbit is retrograde; it orbits the Sun in the opposite direction to the planets, or, clockwise from above the Sun's north pole. The orbit is inclined by 18° to the ecliptic, with much of it lying south of the ecliptic. (Because it is retrograde, the true inclination is 162°). Due to the retrograde orbit, it {{has one of the highest}} velocities relative to the Earth of any object in the Solar System. The 1910 passage was at a relative velocity of 70.56km/s (157,838mph or 254,016km/h). Because its orbit comes close to Earth's in two places, Halley is associated with two meteor showers: the Eta Aquariids in early May, and the Orionids in late October. Halley is the parent body to the Orionids. Observations conducted around the time of Halley's appearance in 1986 suggested that the comet could additionally perturb the Eta Aquarid meteor shower, although it might not be the parent of that shower.|$|E
5|$|Kepler's laws of {{planetary}} motion describe {{the orbits of}} objects about the Sun. Following Kepler's laws, each object travels along an ellipse with the Sun at one focus. Objects closer to the Sun (with smaller semi-major axes) travel more quickly {{because they are more}} affected by the Sun's gravity. On an elliptical orbit, a body's distance from the Sun varies over the course of its year. A body's closest approach to <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> called its perihelion, whereas its most distant point from <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> called its aphelion. The orbits of the planets are nearly circular, but many comets, asteroids, and Kuiper belt objects follow highly elliptical orbits. The positions of the bodies in the Solar System can be predicted using numerical models.|$|E
5|$|Mars's average {{distance}} from <b>the</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> roughly , and its orbital period is 687 (Earth) days. The solar day (or sol) on Mars {{is only slightly}} longer than an Earth day: 24 hours, 39 minutes, and 35.244 seconds. A Martian year is equal to 1.8809 Earth years, or 1 year, 320 days, and 18.2 hours.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> a G-type {{main-sequence star}} that {{comprises}} about 99.86% {{of the mass}} of the Solar System. The Sun has an absolute magnitude of +4.83, estimated to be brighter than about 85% of the stars in the Milky Way, most of which are red dwarfs.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Sun</b> <b>is</b> a G2-type main-sequence star. Hotter main-sequence {{stars are}} more luminous. The Sun's {{temperature}} is intermediate between {{that of the}} hottest stars {{and that of the}} coolest stars. Stars brighter and hotter than the Sun are rare, whereas substantially dimmer and cooler stars, known as red dwarfs, make up 85% of the stars in the Milky Way.|$|E
