50|$|The {{public enquiry}} into the {{building}} of the line was held at the Star Hotel, Maidstone on 17 March 1905. H F Stephens said that the proposed line would bring benefits of development of the local stone quarries at Boughton Monchelsea, then in decline, and lead to an increase in the population of the villages served. Stephens predicted <b>traffic</b> <b>receipts</b> of £20 per mile per week. William Rigby also supported the line, claiming the cost of £56,000 was reasonable. He was engaged on building the northern extension of the K&ESR from Tenterden to Headcorn at the time, and stood to gain the contract to build the proposed line.|$|E
50|$|By 1878 it {{was clear}} that {{operating}} costs were exceeding <b>traffic</b> <b>receipts</b> and a receiver was appointed. The suggestion was made that, since it seemed likely that the LNWR and the NSR would continue to be uncooperative, approaches should be made to the GNR or the Midland, who could operate the line bringing in their own traffic. It will be noted that the aim of connecting to Derby had still not been achieved. While the LNWR and NSR were on good terms with the Midland and exercised running powers over its lines into Derby and Burton, the GNR had built a new line in competition with all three - its Derbyshire extension - and was anxious to penetrate further westward.|$|E
50|$|The SER and the LCDR {{agreed to}} pool Continental <b>traffic</b> <b>receipts</b> between Hastings and Margate, {{together}} with local receipts to Dover and Folkestone.

The agreement appeared to unduly favour the LCDR, particularly after 1870. It did not prevent competition as the railways could claim additional funds from the pool if they carried more than their proportion of customers. Both companies sought to get round the agreement - the LCDR by establishing a Continental service from Queenborough on the Isle of Sheppey, which was {{outside the scope of}} the agreement. Similarly, the SER built a local station at Shorncliffe on the edge of Folkestone, which it claimed was not part of Folkestone, and from which it charged lower fares.|$|E

The Railway Times approved, noting 'altogether the economical management of this line is most satisfactory', (working expenses {{for the first half of}} 1852 were only 35% of receipts [...] ) but a comic novel of 1851 poked fun at the C&W for having pursued economy to the point where all the platform staff were too young to shave, and passengers arrived covered in smuts because the locomotives were burning coal rather than coke. (The author, Henry Mayhew, clearly knew the area, but it is not clear how far his remarks were accurate reportage, how far exaggeration or comic invention) In 1854 the Carlisle Journal spoke (lightly and in passing) of 'the risk of being capsised into the Derwent by the joulting of that most lop-sided of all railways, the Cockermouth and Workington line'.|$|E

This effectively ended the existence of the Solway Junction Railway as an independent entity, although it was not until 1895 that it was amalgamated with the Caledonian. The company, however, survived; SJR shares and stock held by the Caledonian were cancelled, and the rest were converted not into Caledonian securities, but into a new SJR security paying 3% a year, financed by an annual payment of £4,500 a year from the Caledonian.
