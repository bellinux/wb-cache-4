25|$|Critics {{such as the}} National Coalition <b>to</b> <b>Save</b> <b>Our</b> Mall {{opposed the}} {{location}} of the memorial. A major criticism of the location was that it would interrupt what had been an unbroken view between the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial. The memorial was also criticized for taking up open space that had been historically used for major demonstrations and protests.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, the district, under {{superintendent}} Frank Petruzielo, massively rezoned Houston schools, moving {{students from}} overcrowded ones to underutilized ones. Donald R. McAdams, a former HISD {{school board member}} and author of Fighting <b>to</b> <b>Save</b> <b>Our</b> Urban Schools-- and Winning!: Lessons from Houston, wrote that Petruzielo accomplished this goal {{with a minimum of}} press coverage and controversy by using a participative process that minimized conflict between various Houston neighborhoods. McAdams credits the move with being the catalyst for the 1995 establishment of 11 geographic districts patterned around high school feeder patterns.|$|E

[...] However, the Cayuse party was imprisoned and transported to Oregon City. When the group was asked why they offered themselves to the militia, Tiloukaikt stated [...] "Did not your missionaries teach us that Christ died to save his people? So die we <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>our</b> people." [...] At a military court Tiloukait and the four other Cayuses, Tomahas, Klokamas, Isaiachalkis, and Kimasumpkinhese, were found guilty and hanged on June 3, 1850, at Oregon City.|$|E

He came down, rewrote the scene, and before {{he got back to}} his plane I sort of grabbed him and said, 'And this scene and this scene?' And he rewrote two other scenes that I thought had problems." [...] In October 2013, Tony Curran tweeted that he would be portraying Odin's father, Bor, in a flashback sequence. In November 2013, Feige stated that the film was intended to be the conclusion of the [...] "Loki trilogy", which examined the relationship of Thor and Loki throughout Thor, The Avengers and this film. The film's mid-credits scene was directed by James Gunn, the director of Marvel Studios' Guardians of the Galaxy.|$|E
500|$|Despite the {{resistance}} to the character, Bungie staff defended the character's introduction. [...] "I'd much rather experiment and do something surprising, and not have everybody appreciate it, than just turn the crank and do another alien war movie with a space marine," [...] said Halo 2 design lead Jaime Griesemer. Community lead Brian Jarrard attributed some of the fan backlash to a discord between the game's marketing and the actual gameplay. [...] "I think, {{even more so than}} playing as the Arbiter, the thing that people were disappointed with and angry about is that they were promised this experience, through the marketing, of being really backs against the wall, Earth's under siege, we're going to do all we can <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>our</b> home planet... In reality, the game only had two missions that actually did that." [...] Referring to Halo 2s cliffhanger ending, Griesemer said, [...] "I think if we'd been able to finish that last couple of missions and get you properly back on Earth, a lot of the reaction would have been placated." ...|$|E

Contrary to popular opinion, the hippies had great respect for America and believed that they were the true patriots, the only ones who genuinely wanted <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>our</b> country and make it the best it could be once again. ... hair was the hippies' flag – their ... symbol not only of rebellion but also of new possibilities, a symbol of the rejection of discrimination and restrictive gender roles (a philosophy celebrated in the song [...] "My Conviction"). [...] It symbolized equality between men and women. ... he hippies' chosen clothing also made statements. Drab work clothes (jeans, work shirts, pea coats) were a rejection of materialism. [...] Clothing from other cultures, particularly the Third World and native Americans, represented their awareness of the global community and their rejection of U.S. imperialism and selfishness. [...] Simple cotton dresses and other natural fabrics were a rejection of synthetics, a return to natural things and simpler times. [...] Some hippies wore old World War II or Civil War jackets as way of co-opting the symbols of war into their newfound philosophy of nonviolence.|$|E

500|$|After its formation, BASIC {{installed}} a {{gifted and talented}} magnet at Jane Long, a school which Donald R. McAdams, a former HISD school board member and author of Fighting <b>to</b> <b>Save</b> <b>Our</b> Urban Schools-- and Winning!: Lessons from Houston, described as a school that was [...] "unacceptable" [...] to Bellaire residents since {{it was less than}} 10% white. McAdams added that even with the new program, to many parents in Bellaire, Long was [...] "never going to be acceptable" [...] due to the overwhelming Hispanic presence. Therefore, there was a proposal to convert Gordon into a small middle school for Bellaire. The school would have space for about 500 students and would be at least 50% White, so it was popular among many Bellaire residents, particularly those outside of the 610 Loop. However those inside the 610 Loop did not want to lose access to Pershing, a full service middle school that was about 40% White. An attendance boundary committee for at HISD met from December 1992 to March 1993. McAdams wrote that the committee was [...] "an all-out war" [...] between the two sides. In February 1993 pro-Gordon persons argued that HISD should purchase a commercial building north of Long and renovate it into an elementary school which would relieve Gordon Elementary and other overcrowded are schools. McAdams wrote that the staff members of HISD superintendent Frank Petruzielo [...] "liked the idea, but unfortunately, on close examination the building proved to be inadequate." [...] In April 1993 the HISD board declared that the Gordon campus would continue to be an elementary school. McAdams wrote that the Gordon supporters and many Bellaire residents were [...] "furious".|$|E

In the past using the negative sentiment towards the colonial era was often used as an excuse to disregard protests against the demolition of historical buildings.

2500|$|She {{opposed the}} {{introduction}} of civil partnerships for gay couples in the UK, and has said that what she calls [...] "the traditional family [...] has been relentlessly attacked by an alliance of feminists, gay rights activists, divorce lawyers and cultural Marxists who grasped {{that this was the}} surest way to destroy Western society." [...] She has said that giving IVF fertility treatment to lesbians would [...] "help destroy our understanding of human identity", and expressed her opinion that opposition to it represents [...] "a fightback <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>our</b> civilisation". She said the UK government was brainwashing children by including references to gay people in lessons about censuses and population movement. Philips called it [...] "an abuse of childhood", part of a [...] "ruthless campaign by the gay rights lobby to destroy the very concept of normal sexual behaviour".
