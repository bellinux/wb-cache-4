25|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>is</b> that statisticians {{have tended}} {{not to publish}} their match lists with their findings. It should, however, {{be noted that the}} number of {{differences}} is extremely small in terms of the sport's overall statistics. The status of pre-definition matches is primarily a statistical concern rather than a historical one. Historians record the importance of a match in contemporary terms regardless of statistical hindsight.|$|E
25|$|PD {{patients}} often demonstrate {{deficits in}} their ability to sequence information, or date events. Part of <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>is</b> hypothesized to be due to a more fundamental difficulty in coordinating or planning retrieval strategies, rather than failure at the level of encoding or storing information in memory. This deficit is also likely to be due to an underlying difficulty in properly retrieving script information. PD patients often exhibit signs of irrelevant intrusions, incorrect ordering of events, and omission of minor components in their script retrieval, leading to disorganized and inappropriate application of script information.|$|E
25|$|This sort of scheme {{needs to}} have a far broader base than is {{currently}} the case, it requires organization and the setting up of waste brokerages where lists of currently available wastes are and the quantities available. One of <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>is</b> once a demand for a waste is known or shown then the material is no longer a “waste” but a sellable commodity which often prices itself out of the market, c.f waste cement kiln dust and N-viro (lime conditioned sewage sludge fertilizer). In the former East Germany, organic household waste was collected and used as fodder for pigs. This integrated system was made possible by the state's control of agriculture; the complexities of continuing it in a market economy after German reunification meant the system had to be discontinued.|$|E
50|$|If P0, &hellip; Pm are all {{positive}} semidefinite, then <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> convex. If these matrices {{are neither}} positive nor negative semidefinite, <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> non-convex. If P1, &hellip; Pm are all zero, then the constraints {{are in fact}} linear and <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> a quadratic program.|$|R
50|$|If <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> linear we can {{use some}} type of matrix inverse method—often <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> ill-posed or {{unstable}} so {{we will need to}} regularize it: good, simple methods include the normal equation or singular value decomposition. If <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> weakly nonlinear, an iterative method such Newton-Raphson may be appropriate.|$|R

25|$|The Civic Administration of Thimphu city is the {{responsibility}} of the Thimphu Municipal Corporation (TMC). It was established in 1995 through a royal decree. It became an autonomous corporation in 1999, following the enactment of the Municipal Act of 1999. Its headquarters is at the Lungtenzampa zone of Thimphu. The corporation is headed by a mayor (currently Dasho Nima Wangdi) who is called Thrompon in the Bhutanese language. The mayor is appointed by the Ministry of Works and Human Settlement (MoWHS). An executive committee comprising 17 members governs the corporation; 8 members are elected from 6 zones and 7 members are nominated from government organizations and meet nearly every 6 weeks. However, its capacity to deal with <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>is</b> hindered by lack of adequate staff (without any proportionate increase in staff strength to deal with its large jurisdiction) and its expenditure far outstrips the revenue earned. In order to provide cost effective services, the Corporation (as the regulating body) has contemplated privatization of public services, particularly water supply, solid waste, sewerage and parking.|$|E
25|$|The various {{services}} are currently not interoperable, though those {{that use the}} same DRM system (for instance the several Windows Media DRM format stores, including Napster, Kazaa and Yahoo Music) all provide songs that can be played side-by-side through the same player program. Almost all stores require client software of some sort to be downloaded, and some also need plug-ins. Several colleges and universities, such as Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, have made arrangements with assorted Internet music suppliers to provide access (typically DRM-restricted) to music files for their students, to less than universal popularity, sometimes making payments from student activity fee funds. One of <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>is</b> that the music becomes unplayable after leaving school unless the student continues to pay individually. Another is that few of these vendors are compatible with the most common portable music player, the Apple iPod. The Gowers Review of Intellectual Property (to HMG in the UK; 141 pages, 40+ specific recommendations) has taken note of the incompatibilities, and suggests (Recommendations 8—12) that there be explicit fair dealing exceptions to copyright allowing libraries to copy and format-shift between DRM schemes, and further allowing end users {{to do the same}} privately. If adopted, some acrimony may decrease.|$|E

[...] The neighbourhood is preparing for the passing of the Olympic torch bearer, but the mood has been dampened by the disappearances of several children in the prior week. A council worker named Kel also mentions that cars have been breaking down momentarily for the same period. The Doctor and Rose investigate and realise that the source of <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>is</b> a solitary 12-year-old girl named Chloe Webber. She has the unique ability to cause people to disappear by drawing them. The Doctor hypnotises Chloe and finds out that she is possessed by an immature Isolus, an alien life-form that travels through space with a family of billions. This particular Isolus crashed its pod to Earth due to a solar flare. [...] The Isolus relates to and befriends Chloe, who had a troubled childhood. The Isolus has also caused Chloe to draw a life-sized, exaggerated figure of her late father, who is strongly implied to have abused Chloe when he was alive.|$|E
