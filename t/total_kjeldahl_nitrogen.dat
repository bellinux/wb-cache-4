50|$|The {{fertilizer}} requirements for growing duckweed {{depend on the}} water source and the geographic isolate of L. minor that is used. L. minor grown in ponds that are filled with rainwater, need an additional application of Nitrogen, Phosphor and Potassium. <b>Total</b> <b>Kjeldahl</b> <b>Nitrogen</b> should not drop below 20-30 mg/l if high growth rates and crude protein contents want to be maintained.

Clear differences in environmental conditions were observed. High dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations {{were observed in}} the algae-based,compared to duckweed-based, containers. In the algae-based containers the DO range was between 2. 1 to 6. 6 mg/L and 1. 2 to 4. 3 mg/L in experiment 1 and 2, respectively, whereas in the duckweed-based containers DO ranged between 1. 1 to 3 mg/l and 0. 5 to 2. 1 mg/L. Higher pH values were measured in algae-based due to algal photosynthetic activity compared to duckweed-based containers where the duckweed mat prevented sunlight penetration and hence algal development. In algae-based containers, the pH range was 7. 9 to 8. 6 and 8. 1 to 8. 4 in experiments 1 and 2, respectively, and 7. 3 to 7. 5 and 7 to 7. 6 in the duckweed-based containers. Depending on initial nitrogen concentrations, duckweed-based containers removed between 42 %– 62 % of total nitrogen and between 56 %– 95 % of <b>Kjeldahl</b> <b>nitrogen</b> from the wastewater, while algae-based containers removed between 45 %– 48 % and 48 %– 58 % of <b>total</b> <b>nitrogen</b> and <b>Kjeldahl</b> <b>nitrogen,</b> respectively.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{increased}} salinization {{of fresh water}} over decades due {{to the use of}} road salt deicers, wastewater discharges, saltwater intrusion, human-accelerated weathering, and groundwater irrigation. Salinization can mobilize bioreactive elements (carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, sulfur) chemically via ion exchange and/or biologically via influencing of microbial activity. However, the effects of salinization on coupled biogeochemical cycles are still not well understood. We investigated potential impacts of increased salinization on fluxes of bioreactive elements from stream ecosystems (sediments and riparian soils) to overlying stream water and evaluated the implications of percent urban land use on salinization effects. Two-day incubations of sediments and soils with stream and deionized water across three salt levels were conducted at eight routine monitoring stations across a land-use gradient at the Baltimore Ecosystem Study Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) site in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. Results indicated (1) salinization typically increased sediment releases of labile dissolved organic carbon (DOC), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), <b>total</b> dissolved <b>Kjeldahl</b> <b>nitrogen</b> (TKN) (ammonium + ammonia + dissolved organic nitrogen), and sediment transformations of nitrate; (2) salinization generally decreased DOC aromaticity and fluxes of soluble reactive phosphorus from both sediments and soils; (3) the effects of increased salinization on sediment releases of DOC and TKN and DOC quality increased with percentage watershed urbanization. Biogeochemical responses to salinization varied between sediments and riparian soils in releases of DOC and DIC, and nitrate transformations. The differential responses of riparian soils and sediments to increased salinization were likely due to differences in organic matter sources and composition. Our results suggest that short-term increases in salinization can cause releases of significant amounts of labile organic carbon and nitrogen from stream substrates and organic transformations of nitrogen and phosphorus in urban watersheds. Given that salinization of fresh water will increase in the future due to human activities, significant impacts on carbon and nutrient mobilization and water quality should be anticipated...|$|R

A spatial campaign was carried out during a low-flow period to characterize the nutrient contents of both water and sediments in the VSne River. The results showed high nutrient concentrations in the water column downstream of the treated wastewater disposal (up to 13, 315 mu g N/L for ammonium and 2, 901 mu g P/L for total phosphorus).

The study propagates different reasons for the surface water quality 			degradation in Pakistan. Mixing of untreated effluent in large 			quantity to &# 8220;Ravi River&# 8221; is a serious threat to the environment and 			public health.

Laboratory results of collected samples are not 			satisfactory. To investigate the impacts of untreated effluent on 			microbial activities a biological survey was also carried out. 			Species of fish, oligochaetes, algae, stone fly, midge, and cadesfly 			were identified and discussed. It was investigated that during 			winter the river seems to be quite polluted. However conditions 			become better during summer months due to the increase in the flow 			rate. High concentration of wastewater microbes clearly explains 			that water quality of &# 8220;Ravi River&# 8221; is not satisfactory. 			Modeling of wastewater treatment process has gained much attention 			and a lot of research has been focused toward this area.

The applications of ASM 1, ASM 2, 			ASM 2 d, ASM 3, ASM 3 _ 2 N, ASM 3 bio-P model etc. are also studied. The 			whitebox modeling techniques in this area are more significant. The 			importance of black-box models under special conditions where 			white-box models are not able to predict accurate results are also 			investigated. It was also found that use of hybrid, linearization 			and Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in wastewater treatment 			modeling can be more useful for process optimization and control. 			White-box modeling techniques in wastewater treatment modeling are 			most reliable for better understanding of the whole mechanism.

40|$|Two {{processes}} {{are used to}} stabilize organic wastes: composting and vermicomposting. There are no studies in the literature showing which process is most effective over the short term. In this study, 3 organic wastes were composted and vermicomposted for 90 days, and the parameters pH, effective cation exchange capacity, total organic carbon, <b>total</b> <b>Kjeldahl</b> <b>nitrogen,</b> Ptotal, E 4 /E 6 ratio, hydrophobicity and aromaticity indexes were determined. In all experiments, vermicomposted materials showed higher stability, proving a superior tool for stabilization of these organic wastes...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of our study}} is to recycle the industrial waste water of a industrial Complex after treatment by the bioprocess MBR (membrane bioreactor). In order to apply this bioprocess, the water quality in question was first of all studied. To characterize this industrial waste water, a series of physicochemical analysis was carried out according to standardized directives and methods. Following-up the water quality to meet the regulatory requirements with rejection of this industrial waste water, a study was done thanks to the permanently monitoring of the following relevant parameters(P) : the flow, the potential of hydrogen (pH), the total suspended solids(TSS), the turbidity (Turb), the chemical oxygen demand (COD),the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), the <b>Kjeldahl</b> <b>total</b> <b>nitrogen</b> (KTN) and ammonia (NH 4 +), the total phosphorus (Ptot), the fluorine (F), the oils (O), the fats (F) and the phenols (Ph). According to collected information, it was established the sampling rates to which the quality control was done, the selected analytical methods were validated by the control charts and the analysis test number {{was determined by the}} Cochran test. The results of the quality control show that some rejected water contents are not in the Algerian standards, but, in our case, the objective is the preoccupation for a standard setting of these industrial water parameters so as to recycle it. The process adopted by MBR for waste water treatment is being studied, first {{in the development of the}} experimental characterizing of the reactor and the selected membrane...|$|R
