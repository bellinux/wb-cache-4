40|$|In this work, {{the design}} and the {{analysis}} of the performance of an improved <b>tip</b> <b>loaded</b> propeller geometry are proposed. Based on the experimental data and on the numerical results collected at SISTEMAR and at the University of Genoa in the case of Contracted and <b>Tip</b> <b>Loaded</b> (CLT) propellers, a new <b>tip</b> <b>loaded</b> propeller geometry is devised in order to mitigate some of the downsides of the CLT geometries increasingly adopted to improve full-scale propeller efficiency. The modified <b>tip</b> <b>loaded</b> propeller, i. e. a mix between a tip rake and a Contracted and <b>Tip</b> <b>Loaded</b> propeller, is designed via an optimization strategy using a Boundary Elements Method (BEM), a custom parametric description of the unconventional blade geometry and an optimization algorithm (of genetic type) within the modeFRONTIER environment. The reliability of the design process and of the improvements achievable with the modified <b>tip</b> <b>loaded</b> propeller are extensively verified with dedicated RANSE calculations. At first, the accuracy of the BEM, adopted for the design by optimization, is verified in terms of predicted propeller performance in order to assess its applicability for the analysis of modified tip geometries and check its confidence with respect to the allowable modifications of the blade shape. As a second step, viscous calculations are adopted to confirm the improvements of the newly designed geometries, in terms of both cavitation and predicted velocity field downstream the propeller, {{as a result of a}} better adaptation of the end plate geometry to the incoming flow. Finally, a set of unsteady calculations, by using the unsteady BEM, is carried out to verify the amplitude of the induced pressure pulses and, by comparing these numerical results with the available measurements and calculations in the case of a reference CLT propeller, to confirm the effectiveness of the modified propeller tip shap...|$|R

40|$|Axial {{force was}} applied to the root tip of corn (Zea mays L. cv. Merit) {{seedlings}} using a computerized, feedback-controlled mechanical device. The system's feedback capability allowed continuous control of a constant <b>tip</b> <b>load,</b> and the attached displacement transducer provided the time course of root elongation. Loads up to 7. 5 g decreased the root elongation rate by 0. 13 mm h- 1 g- 1, but loads 7. 5 to 17. 5 g decreased the growth rate by only 0. 04 mm h- 1 g- 1. Loads higher than 18 g stopped root elongation completely. Measurement of the cross-sectional areas of the root tips indicated that the 18 g load had applied about 0. 98 MPa of axial pressure to the root, thereby exceeding the root's ability to respond with increased turgor pressure. Recorded time-lapse images of loaded roots showed that radial thickening (swelling) occurred behind the root cap, whose cross-sectional area increased with <b>tip</b> <b>load...</b>|$|E

40|$|Presented are {{the results}} of an {{investigation}} of the twisting/warping deformation occurring in open-section composite beams. A series of C and L channels were manufactured using both hand layup and the innovative 'hot-drape forming' techniques. A transverse <b>tip</b> <b>load</b> was applied at the free end of the cantilevered open-section beams. The test setup allowed the <b>tip</b> <b>load</b> to be applied at various locations along the plane of and at the beam's shear center. Charts are included in this report depicting various angles of ply layups, loads applied, and load application points. A major verification resulting from this study is that the shear center of an open section composite beam can be altered, if not completely controlled, through laminate layup. Also, it was observed that the choice of the material system does not {{have an effect on the}} amount of deformation, as expected, and the material affects the location of an unsymmetric open section composite beam's true shear center. The results from this study have provided a foundation for further investigation into the apparent shifting of the shear center location in open-section composite beams...|$|E
40|$|Steering {{of needles}} {{involves}} {{the planning and}} timely modifying of instrument-tissue force interactions to allow for controlled deflections during the insertion in tissue. In this work, the effect of tip shape on these forces was studied using 10 mm diameter needle tips. Six different tips were selected, including beveled and conical versions, with or without pre-bend or pre-curve. A six-degree-of-freedom force/torque sensor measured the loads during indentations in tissue simulants. The increased insertion (axial) and bending (radial) forces with insertion depth-the force-displacement slopes-were analyzed. Results showed that the ratio between radial and axial forces was not always proportional. This means that the <b>tip</b> <b>load</b> {{does not have a}} constant orientation, as is often assumed in mechanics-based steering models. For all tip types, the tip-load assumed a more radial orientation with increased axial load. This effect was larger for straight tips than for pre-bent or pre-curved tips. In addition, the force-displacement slopes were consistently higher for (1) increased tip angles, and for (2) beveled tips compared to conical tips. Needles with a bent or curved tip allow for an increased bending force and a decreased variability of the <b>tip</b> <b>load</b> vector orientation. </p...|$|E
40|$|Results are {{presented}} from an investigation {{to measure the}} flow field generated by a forward-swept propfan operating in flutter at a low forward velocity. For comparison to the flutter condition, flow field data are also presented for a slightly reduced rotational speed just below flutter. The forward-swept propfan was tested as the front rotor of a counterrotating pusher propeller. A laser Doppler velocimeter (LDV) {{was used to measure}} the velocity field in planes normal to the model centerline downstream of the rotor and in planes of constant radius within the blade passages at each operating condition. A comparison of the data taken at the two different operating conditions indicated that the mean, time-averaged flow about the blades did not change drastically as the propfan rotational speed was increased from the stable operating point to the flutter condition. No regions of flow separation could be identified in the data plots of the mean intrablade flow field. The data also indicate that the relative flow about the blades remained subsonic during flutter operation. The blades were found to have a higher than expected <b>tip</b> <b>loading</b> at both operating conditions. This is thought to have been caused by the outer blade sections twisting under load to higher than expected effective blade angles. This high <b>tip</b> <b>loading</b> resulted in strong vortices and a very nonuniform flow downstream of the tips of the forward-swept blades. This high <b>tip</b> <b>loading</b> may also have caused the blade flutter...|$|R
40|$|A {{potential}} {{cause of}} helicopter impulsive noise, commonly called blade slap, is the unsteady lift fluctuation on a rotor blade due to {{interaction with the}} vortex trailed from another blade. The relationship between vortex structure {{and the intensity of}} the acoustic signal is investigated. The analysis is based on a theoretical model for blade/vortex interaction. Unsteady lift on the blades due to blade/vortex interaction is calculated using linear unsteady aerodynamic theory, and expressions are derived for the directivity, frequency spectrum, and transient signal of the radiated noise. An inviscid rollup model is used to calculate the velocity profile in the trailing vortex from the spanwise distribution of blade <b>tip</b> <b>loading.</b> A few cases of <b>tip</b> <b>loading</b> are investigated, and numerical results are presented for the unsteady lift and acoustic signal due to blade/vortex interaction.

Therefore, a proposed BOGS count change would not help the situation because a clearly identifiable resonance situation does not exist.

While the basic scheme has been presented earlier by the authors for linear viscoelasticity, the present work illustrates the generality of the underlying fundamentals by extending to Schapery's non-linear model. The method features a judicious choice of state variables, a stable backward Euler integration step, and a consistent tangent operator. Its greatest strength lies in ready incorporation into existing FEM codes.
