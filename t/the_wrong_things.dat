25|$|One of Raj's biggest {{personality}} quirks is his {{tendency to}} speak or act inappropriately, often landing him in trouble or {{leading to an}} angry reaction from whomever he has upset. This was particularly pronounced when he was {{under the influence of}} alcohol, which could cause a catch-22, since for years he needed alcohol to even speak to a woman, but the alcohol led to him say <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>things.</b> On one occasion, just as Leonard and Penny are about to have sex in their hotel room, Raj enters and obliviously proceeds to climb into Sheldon's recently vacated bed, completely unaware of what he has interrupted. On another occasion, he openly discussed having had crushes on Penny and Bernadette directly in front of them, which caused both discomfort, and unwittingly hurting Amy's feelings when he admits that he never had a crush on her as well (despite Penny and Bernadette's best efforts to alert him to this fact).|$|E

2500|$|We {{should not}} be {{surprised}} at the lack of ruins in America in general. Actually the scarcity of identifiable remains in the Old World is even more impressive. In view of the nature of their civilization one {{should not be}} puzzled if the Nephites had left us no ruins at all. People underestimate the capacity of things to disappear, and do not realize that the ancients almost never built of stone. Many a great civilization which has left a notable mark in history and literature has left behind not a single recognizable trace of itself. We must stop looking for <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>things.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Oliver was criticised for underestimating {{the cost}} of {{supposedly}} cheap food he encouraged poor people to prepare for themselves, also for an unrealistic view of poverty in Britain and round the Mediterranean. Cookery writer and poverty campaigner Jack Monroe stated that Oliver's comments [...] "support damaging myths that poor people are only poor because they spend their money on <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>things,</b> rather than being constrained by time, equipment, knowledge or practicalities". Monroe added, [...] "When I was living on £10 a week for food, because of mistakes with housing benefit payments, I didn't need a hug. I needed a fiver, {{just to have a}} little bit more to eat. I didn't need [...] to Sicily to see how the street cleaners ate, I needed someone {{to point out that the}} 21p can of kidney beans could be the staple ingredient in a nutritious meal. I needed practical advice about what to do with the tins of food given to me by the food bank." ...|$|E

2500|$|Upon its release, Talk Dirty {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. At USA Today, Martin Caballero rated the album {{two out of}} four stars, stating that Derulo is [...] "wallow in familiar sexed-up tropes, both lyrically and musically, that aren't distinctive enough to ultimately prove memorable." [...] Caballero continued saying [...] "Talk Dirty sounds like Macklemore's Thrift Shop on Red Bull and Viagra". Brent Faulkner of StarPulse.com rated the album three out of five stars, stating that the album heavily relies on sex and swagger holds the album back at times. Faulkner went on to summarize the album as [...] "average at best" [...] stating [...] " [...] seems to put its eggs too much into one basket – specifically booty. Much like Derülo’s Future History, Talk Dirty seems to lack cohesion; it’s missing something". Glenn Gamboa at Newsday graded the album a C, saying that Derulo [...] "tries too hard at <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>things...</b> cornering the market on sex-themed pop songs." [...] in closing Gambo called Talk Dirty a [...] "sex-obsessed album that isn't very sexy".|$|E
2500|$|An adolescent's {{environment}} plays a huge role {{in their}} identity development. While most adolescent studies are conducted on white, middle class children, {{studies show that the}} more privileged upbringing people have, the more successfully they develop their identity. The forming of an adolescent's identity is a crucial time in their life. It has been recently found that demographic patterns suggest that the transition to adulthood is now occurring over a longer span of years than was the case {{during the middle of the}} 20th century. Accordingly, youth, a period that spans late adolescence and early adulthood, has become a more prominent stage of the life course. This therefore has caused various factors to become important during this development. [...] So many factors contribute to the developing social identity of an adolescent from commitment, to coping devices, to social media. All of these factors are affected by the environment an adolescent grows up in. A child from a more privileged upbringing is exposed to more opportunities and better situations in general. An adolescent from an inner city or a crime-driven neighborhood is more likely to be exposed to an environment that can be detrimental to their development. [...] Adolescence is a sensitive period in the development process, and exposure to <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>things</b> at that time can have a major effect on future decisions. [...] While children that grow up in nice suburban communities are not exposed to bad environments they are more likely to participate in activities that can benefit their identity and contribute to a more successful identity development.|$|E

The absence of any knowledge of anything not English {{on the part of}} the officers and stewards was most ridiculous.

He was indebted for alterations, and she was thereby in a {{position}} to have sent in her bill for expenses incurred in reconstruction. What was this at bottom but what had been to be arrived at? Strether sat there arriving at it while he munched toast and stirred his second cup. To do this with the aid of Chad's pleasant earnest face was also to do more besides. No, never before had he been so ready to take him as he was. What was it that had suddenly so cleared up? It was just everybody's character; that is everybody's but--in a measure--his own. Strether felt HIS character receive for the instant a smutch from all <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>things</b> he had suspected or believed.

6000|$|Once more {{in my old}} quarters, {{and with}} rather a tired sole to my foot, from having found such an immense number of {{different}} resting-places for it since I went away. I write you my last Italian letter for this bout, designing to leave here, please God, on the ninth of next month, and to be in London again {{by the end of}} June. I am looking forward with great delight to the pleasure of seeing you once more, and mean to come to Gore House with such a swoop as shall astonish the poodle, if, after being accustomed to his own size and sense, he retain the power of being astonished at anything in the wide world. You know where I have been, and every mile of ground I have travelled over, and every object I have seen. It is next to impossible, surely, to exaggerate the interest of Rome; though, I think, it is very possible to find the main source of interest in <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>things.</b> Naples disappointed me greatly. The weather was bad during a great part of my stay there. But if I had not had mud, I should have had dust, and though I had had sun, I must still have had the Lazzaroni. And they are so ragged, so dirty, so abject, so full of degradation, so sunken and steeped in the hopelessness of better things, that they would make heaven uncomfortable, if they could ever get there. I didn't expect to see a handsome city, but I expected something better than that long dull line of squalid houses, which stretches from the Chiaja to the quarter of the Porta Capuana; and while I was quite prepared for a miserable populace, I had some dim belief that there were bright rays among them, and dancing legs, and shining sun-browned faces. Whereas the honest truth is, that connected with Naples itself, I have not one solitary recollection. The country round it charmed me, I need not say. Who can forget Herculaneum and Pompeii? ...|$|E
60|$|Oh! {{when will}} people {{understand}} that--that God {{has not made}} laws out of any arbitrariness, but for our good?--That his commandments are LIFE? David of old knew as much as that. Why do not we know more, instead of knowing, most of us, much less? It is simple enough, if you will but look at it with simple minds. God has made us; {{and if he had}} not loved us, he would not have made us at all. God has sent us into the world; and if he had not loved us, he would not have sent us into the world at all. In him we live, and move, and have our being, and are the offspring and children of God. And therefore God alone knows what is good for us; what is the good life, the wholesome, the safe, the right, the everlasting life for us. And he sends his Son to tell us--This is the right life; a life like Christ's; a life according to God's Spirit; and if you do not live that life you will die, not only body but soul also, because you are not living the life which God meant for you when he made you. Just as if you eat the wrong food, you will kill your bodies; so if you think the wrong thoughts, and feel the wrong feelings, and therefore do <b>the</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>things,</b> you will kill your own souls. God will not kill you; you will kill yourselves. God grudges you nothing. God does not wish to hurt you, wish to punish you. He wishes you to live and be happy; to live for ever, and be happy for ever. But as your body cannot live unless it be healthy, so your soul cannot live unless it be healthy. And it cannot be healthy unless it live the right life. And it cannot live the right life without the right spirit. And the only right spirit is the Spirit of God himself the Spirit of your Father in heaven, who will make you, as children should be, like your Father.|$|E
