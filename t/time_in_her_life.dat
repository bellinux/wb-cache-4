500|$|The {{title of}} the record is a {{reference}} to the 1994 novel Poems to Break the Harts of Impossible Princesses, written by Billy Childish. A copy of the book had been dedicated to Minogue, but was accidentally passed onto Nick Cave, eventually given to Minogue not long after. She recalled only looking at the {{title of the}} book, and saying that [...] "It had me written all over it." [...] Additionally, she believed that the poems in the book summarised where she was at that <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>life.</b> Furthermore, the title was used in the album's song [...] "Dreams", during the chorus, [...] "These are the dreams of an impossible princess". Although copies of the album and its title were printed in mid-1997, on 31 August 1997, Diana, Princess of Wales, was killed in a fatal car accident. Due to impact of her death, Minogue and Deconstruction felt the album's aforementioned titled was [...] "insensitive" [...] and the label delayed its release. Feeling the title would be inappropriate to have on the album, Minogue and her management came to a mutual agreement to re-title it Kylie Minogue in Europe, the same name as her 1994 record. However, upon the album's remastered and re-released edition on 23 March 2003, the album re-instated the Impossible Princess title in those regions.|$|E
