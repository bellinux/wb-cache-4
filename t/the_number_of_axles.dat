25|$|Double-stacking {{containers}} {{greatly improved}} operating efficiency by reducing train length and <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>axles</b> per container, thus saving fuel per ton-mile. Another benefit {{was created by}} permanently joining five cars in a set. This {{reduced the number of}} couplers, which reduced slack action. Slack is created in any train by the couplers between the cars being stretched and compressed, and in long, heavy trains this can be quite a powerful force. By reducing slack action, the damage caused to the freight transported in containers is also reduced.|$|E
25|$|On 1 January 2005, a {{new system}} came into effect for {{mandatory}} tolls (Mautpflicht) on heavy trucks (those weighing more than 12 t) while using the German autobahn system (LKW-Maut). The German government contracted with a private company, Toll Collect GmbH, to operate the toll collection system, which has involved the use of vehicle-mounted transponders and roadway-mounted sensors installed throughout Germany. The toll is calculated depending on the toll route, as well as based on the pollution class of the vehicle, its weight and <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>axles</b> on the vehicles. Certain vehicles, such as emergency vehicles and buses, are exempt from the toll. An average user is charged €0.15 per kilometre, or about $0.31 per mile (Toll Collect, 2007).|$|E
25|$|Railroads {{generally}} preferred locomotives {{with fewer}} axles, to reduce maintenance costs. <b>The</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>axles</b> required was {{dictated by the}} maximum axle loading of the railroad in question. A builder would typically add axles until the maximum weight on any one axle was acceptable to the railroad's maximum axle loading. A locomotive with a wheel arrangement of two lead axles, two drive axles, and one trailing axle was a high-speed machine. Two lead axles were necessary to have good tracking at high speeds. Two drive axles had a lower reciprocating mass than three, four, five or six coupled axles. They were thus able to turn at very high speeds due to the lower reciprocating mass. A trailing axle was able to support a huge firebox, hence most locomotives with the wheel arrangement of 4-4-2 (American Type Atlantic) were called free steamers {{and were able to}} maintain steam pressure regardless of throttle setting.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>number,</b> usually two-digit, <b>the</b> {{first digit}} {{indicating}} <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> coupled <b>axles</b> and <b>the</b> second <b>the</b> total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>axles</b> on <b>the</b> locomotive. Tender axles were not included.|$|R
50|$|In the Turkish {{classification}} system for railway locomotives, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> powered <b>axles</b> {{are followed by}} <b>the</b> total <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>axles.</b> It {{is identical to the}} Swiss system except that the latter places a slash between <b>the</b> two <b>numbers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{second digit}} {{corresponds}} to <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> powered <b>axles.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{weight of}} the {{locomotive}} is roughly proportional to the power output; <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>axles</b> required is determined by this weight divided by the axleload limit for the trackage where the locomotive is to be used. The number of driving wheels {{is derived from the}} adhesive weight in the same manner, leaving the remaining axles to be accounted for by the leading and trailing bogies. Passenger locomotives conventionally had two-axle leading bogies for better guidance at speed; on the other hand, the vast increase {{in the size of the}} grate and firebox in the 20th century meant that a trailing bogie was called upon to provide support. In Europe, some use was made of several variants of the Bissel bogie in which the swivelling movement of a single axle truck controls the lateral displacement of the front driving axle (and in one case the second axle too). This was mostly applied to 8-coupled express and mixed traffic locomotives, and considerably improved their ability to negotiate curves whilst restricting overall locomotive wheelbase and maximising adhesion weight.|$|E
2500|$|As {{the first}} new {{locomotive}} series following {{the development of the}} first draft revised system, the Re 450 series was classified partially in accordance with that draft; what would have been the locomotive numbers under the old system (10500ff) were replaced by sequential numbers (000 ff), and <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>axles</b> was still prepended to the vehicle number in the old fractional form (Re 4/4 450000 ff). [...] Upon the delivery of the first Re 460 locomotives in 1991, [...] a corresponding classification style was used.|$|E

50|$|In the Whyte notation, {{driving wheels}} are {{designated}} by the middle number or numbers in the set. The UIC classification system counts <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>axles</b> rather {{than the number of}} wheels and driving wheels are designated by letters rather than numbers. The suffix 'o' is used to indicate independently powered axles.|$|E
50|$|Vehicles are {{classified}} for toll purposes in six categories {{based on the}} wheelbase and <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>axles.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>axles</b> of a vehicle {{is less than the}} maximum number of axles -because some axles of a truck are lifted up or a tractor is running without its trailer-, the integrated automated vehicle classification system changes the vehicle category read in to the actual one during the passage allowing a lower toll tariff. The bridge toll is fixed for each vehicle category, and is charged only once in eastward direction on the two bridges in Istanbul. The road toll is rated further depending on the distance driven between the entry and the exit of motorway for each vehicle category. For this reason, a signal has to be initiated on the KGS-lane by entering the motorway.|$|E
50|$|The United States Federal Bridge Law {{deals with}} the {{relation}} between the gross weight of the truck, <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> <b>axles,</b> the weight on and the spacing between the axles that the truck can have on the Interstate highway system.
