2500|$|In the 2008 presidential debates, Romney {{left open}} {{whether it was}} always {{necessary}} for the U.S. Congress to issue {{a declaration of war}} before engaging in military actions. Romney stated that if he were president he would consult with his lawyers before he came to a conclusive interpretation of the War Powers Clause in the US Constitution. In June 2012 during a Face the Nation interview Romney stated regarding military action against Iran: [...] "I don’t believe at this stage, therefore, if I’m president <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a war powers approval or special authorization for military force." ...|$|E
2500|$|In June 2012, Romney said [...] "I {{can assure}} you, if I'm President, the Iranians {{will have no}} {{question}} but that I {{would be willing to}} take military action if necessary to prevent them from becoming a nuclear threat to the world." [...] In his July 2012 trip to Israel he said that preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear [...] "capability" [...] should be America's [...] "highest national security priority." [...] Romney has said of using military force against Iran, [...] "I don't believe at this stage, therefore, if I'm President, <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> war powers approval or a special authorization for military force." [...] He has refused to state if he would be open to using direct diplomacy to settle the issue with the Iranians.|$|E
2500|$|By contrast, many {{recent studies}} of the Greek word pistis have {{concluded}} that its primary and most common meaning was faithfulness, meaning firm commitment in an interpersonal relationship. As such, the word could be almost synonymous with [...] "obedience" [...] when {{the people in the}} relationship held different status levels (e.g. a slave being faithful to his master). Far from being equivalent to [...] "lack of human effort", the word seems to imply and require human effort. The interpretation of Paul's writings that we need [...] "faithfully" [...] to obey God's commands is quite different from one which sees him saying <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> [...] "faith" [...] that he will do everything for us. This is also argued to explain why James was adamant that [...] "faith without works is dead" [...] and that [...] "a man is justified by works, and not by faith alone" [...] (Js. 2:24), while also saying that merely to [...] believe places one on the same level as the demons (see James 2). The [...] "new" [...] perspective argues that James was concerned with those who were trying to reduce faith to an intellectual subscription without any intent to follow God or Jesus, and that Paul always intended [...] "faith" [...] to mean a full submission to God.|$|E

2500|$|During the 2012 presidential {{election}} campaign, Romney took positions on agricultural subsidies that some media reports characterized as vague and somewhat contradictory. In May 2011, {{just days after}} rival Republican presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty had declared that federal subsidies {{for the production of}} ethanol fuel should be phased out, Romney said that he was a supporter of ethanol subsidies. Five months later, while speaking on agricultural subsidies at a roundtable discussion with Iowa farmers and business leaders, Romney said, “I’m not running for office based on making promises of handing out money.... We’re {{going to have to live}} within our means.” He also said that while he had supported ethanol subsidies in the past in order to help the ethanol fuel industry become established, and that he continued to believe that ethanol should play a role in meeting the nation’s energy needs, he agreed with the discontinuation of the tax credit for production of ethanol from corn that was scheduled to occur two months later. On the subject of agricultural subsidies more generally, Romney wrote in response to a 2012 questionnaire from the American Farm Bureau Federation that [...] "other nations subsidize their farmers, so we [...] must be careful not to unilaterally change our policies in a way that would [...] disadvantage agriculture here in our country." [...] He made similar remarks on the campaign trail in August 2012, without explicitly referring to subsidies: [...] "We don't want to find ourselves with regards to our food supply in the same kind of position we are in with our energy supply, so it's important for us to make sure that our farmers are able to stay on the farm and raise the crops <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a secure source of food. So I believe in supports that will allow us to do that." ...|$|E
2500|$|... {{on behalf}} of some 132 cosponsors, {{introduced}} this measure. I {{would also like to}} thank Mr. Lampson from Texas as the Chairman of the Caucus on Missing and Exploited Children, and Mr. Ose from the State of California, who have devoted much of their time to raising our level of awareness of the growing problem of international child abduction. [...] We are taking action on this measure {{on behalf of}} the parents of our abducted and wrongfully retained children. These left-behind parents have put their faith and trust in an international agreement, The Hague Convention, which is clear and explicit on the obligation of signatory governments to return an abducted or wrongfully retained child to his or her country of habitual residence. Nevertheless, we have found that in a number of nations, for a variety of reasons, this does not occur, and the resultant frustration, heartbreak and outrage has led us to act on the measure before us today. [...] I should also add <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> our State Department do more to promote compliance with The Hague Convention. The return of an abducted or illegally retained child should be on the top of the Secretary’s meetings with any official of a country involved in such cases. [...] This is not a problem that should be handled as a routine exchange of diplomatic notes or phone calls by junior U.S. officials to their foreign counterparts. We need to see some concern and some concrete actions by the highest levels of our government to redress what is, evidently, a growing international problem. [...] It is our hope that by adopting this resolution, and sending it to the floor for speedy action, we will send a strong signal that this is an issue that we care deeply about. We need to get the attention of the Governments of Germany, Sweden, Austria, Mexico, and Honduras that they cannot expect The Hague Convention to be a one-way street.|$|E

Her name is not Buttons; she is not in the least a contemptible nor entirely a comic figure. She has a powerful stoop and an ugly, attractive face, a little like that of Huxley--without the whiskers, of course. The courage with which she supports the most brutal bad luck has something quite creepy about it. Her irony is incessant and inventive; her practical charity very large; and she is wholly unaware of the philosophical use to which I put her.|$|E

I am posing a question if the Muslim countries in Asia can open the gate to their country for us, so that we can open up relations with them.There are so many opportunities in Israel and by stressing the need for cooperation we would like to get these countries to also have a share of these opportunities.
