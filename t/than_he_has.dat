5|$|In short, had Mr. Boulton {{done nothing}} {{more in the}} world <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> {{accomplished}} in improving the coinage, his name would deserve to be immortalised; and if it be considered that this {{was done in the}} midst of various other important avocations, and at enormous expense,— for which, at the time, he could have had no certainty of an adequate return,—we shall be at a loss whether most to admire his ingenuity, his perseverance, or his munificence. He has conducted the whole more like a sovereign than a private manufacturer; and the love of fame has always been to him a greater stimulus than the love of gain. Yet it is to be hoped that, even in the latter point of view, the enterprise answered its purpose.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the {{subsequent}} period of foreign catastrophe which, to contemporaries, came to symbolise {{the failure of}} Suffolk's government in the late 1440s, Beaumont not only supported the duke's policy but backed him during his impeachment. With Suffolk's fall in 1450, it {{has been described as}} 'rather surprising' that Beaumont did not fall with him, having 'been involved in some of the regime's most unpopular activities.' For instance, he was a close associate and a 'protector' of the 'headstrong' Sir William Tailboys (whom Griffiths also called '-in-chief') when Tailboys attempted to assassinate Lord Cromwell in broad daylight in November 1449. He had also suffered a minor assault on his Boston manor the previous year, but it is likely that he was seen as more impartial at the time <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> seen since. Indeed, far from suffering from his patron's fall, he was appointed to Suffolk's old position of Lord Chamberlain of England, although only for three weeks.|$|E
5|$|Favre led the Packers to a 13–3 {{regular season}} record, the NFC North championship, {{and the second}} seed in the NFC playoffs. Prior to the Packers' playoff game against the Seattle Seahawks, Favre stated his desire to {{continue}} playing football for another season. In the Divisional Playoffs, Favre threw three touchdowns as the Packers cruised to a 42–20 victory over the Seahawks at a snowy Lambeau Field. The Packers' season ended the following week when they suffered a 23–20 overtime loss in the NFC Championship Game to the eventual Super Bowl Champion New York Giants. Negotiating sub-zero temperatures, Favre amassed 236 passing yards and two touchdowns, but also threw an interception in overtime that set up the Giants' game-winning field goal. Favre's 90-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Donald Driver {{in the second quarter}} was the longest pass in Packers playoff history, and it extended Favre's NFL record for consecutive postseason games with a touchdown pass to 18. Favre stated after the game that he would make a decision more quickly <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> in the past regarding whether he would return for another season.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} week, Ronnie Mitchell (Samantha Womack) spots her ex-boyfriend Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) {{talking to}} Marsden; Jack tells Ronnie {{that he was}} fishing for information. With no new leads, Marsden's boss threatens to take her off the case. She reviews the suspects and decides to question Jack, since he is asking more questions <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> answered. In the café Marsden and Hughes discuss new information she has obtained, ensuring that she is overheard. Chinese whisper-style rumours circulate, ending with the certainty that Marsden would arrest Ronnie. Ronnie sees Marsden in the Square, and a struggle ensues. She knocks Marsden down, is {{arrested and charged with}} assaulting a police officer but is released on bail. Marsden suspects Ronnie further, saying that she has now shown her true colours. Later, DC Jasmine Field (Karen Ascoe) enters the pub with other officers to arrest a suspect; frightened, Ronnie leaves Walford. The police officers are there to arrest Dot Branning (June Brown), who was accused by Dotty Cotton (Molly Conlin) after Dot slapped her. Jack confronts Marsden for unnecessarily sending a uniformed officer to arrest Dot and unsettling the locals, and realises there was no new information.|$|E

25|$|After {{struggling}} to establish himself for New South Wales thereafter, Jaques transformed his career by signing for the English County Championship side Northamptonshire in 2003. He was prolific, hitting over 1200 runs including a triple century {{and returned to}} NSW an established member of the Pura Cup Champions. 2003/04 saw the consolidation of Jaques' English form in Australia as he built a reputation of being a player who could score quickly but also occupy the crease for many hours. After returning to England to play for Yorkshire (1,118 runs in 2004 and 1,359 in 2005) and maintaining a consistent standard with New South Wales (1,191 runs in 2004–05), many were calling for his promotion to the national team. He went back to England to play for Worcestershire for the 2006 and 2007 seasons, where he scored 1689 runs in 18 matches. Uniquely for the current Australian test team, Jaques has played more first-class games overseas <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> in Australia (62 overseas, mainly in England, 51 in Australia as of 25 November 2007). His batting average in the English County Championship is also quite {{a lot better than}} his average in the Pura Cup (59.31 compared to 47.46 as of 25 November 2007).|$|E

Corliss wrote that Kurt's [...] "smackdown of his father has the odor of propaganda from the gayest show in TV history". Canning said he was [...] "moved by Kurt asking his father {{to step out of}} his comfort zone and educate himself about what is gay men do when [...] together", and Gonzalez enjoyed [...] "the very realistic tension that exists between them as father and gay son".|$|E

He launched his first European art exhibition in 2011 at Peres Projects in Berlin. He enjoys reading on the set of his films. Pineapple Express producer Judd Apatow has said of him: [...] "He's a very education-minded person. We used to laugh because in between takes he'd be reading The Iliad on set. We still haven't read The Iliad. It was a very difficult book. With him, it was always James Joyce or something".|$|E

He concluded by stating: [...] "I can't {{think of any}} other artist of Usher's status who would tie his cheating ways to an absent father, and for that he deserves some applause". Eric Arredondo of Beats Per Minute stated that in [...] "Sins of My Father", Usher shows [...] "more bite in his voice" [...] <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> ever heard before, and that [...] "it helps to make a song that is both fun and slightly sinister". Natalie Shaw of BBC Music called [...] "Sins of My Father" [...] outstanding, commenting that Usher's [...] "slink here sounds sinister, for the first time, fearing he'll fall under a demon woman's deathly voodoo while slack, deep beats play out".|$|E

500|$|On the review-aggregating website Metacritic, Indestructible {{received}} {{a score of}} 57%, based on six reviews. Being the first self-produced effort by the band, they had more leeway to create music without any outside interference, suggests 411mania writer Dan Marsicano. He concludes that the self-production also led {{to a lack of}} guidance, though, which ultimately works against the album, rather than helping it. Guitarist Dan Donegan's guitar work was praised, and About.com writer Chad Bowar notes many songs on the album are guitar-driven. Metaleater writer Chris Akin also praises Donegan, saying, [...] "If there is growth in the band, it's in the guitars. Dan Donegan takes a much more 80s approach <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> on past recordings." [...] AllMusic writer James Monger praised Indestructible, suggesting that rather than taking melodic elements from acts like Pantera, like Disturbed's previous records are suggested to, the album takes musical elements from acts such as Metallica or AC/DC.|$|E

500|$|Critics praised Damon's {{performance}} in the episode. A television reviewer from The Sacramento Bee noted that Damon [...] "did a well-publicized (and very good) gig" [...] on the show.

Matt Roush of TV Guide, in review of season four, said: [...] "If it weren't for some inspired guest stars — Matt Damon as a straight guy bluffing his way into a gay chorus, Michael Douglas as a gay detective clowning {{it up on the}} dance floor, Glenn Close as a lusty photographer groping both Will and Grace during a shoot — this season would be an awfully sad misfire." [...] Wales on Sundays Wil Marlow called Damon's performance {{one of the most memorable}} guest appearances in the history of the show, and commented that he [...] "held his own well against serial scene-stealer Sean Hayes." [...] Mark Perigard of the Boston Herald said the episode [...] "flies with jokes predicated on stereotypes and sexual innuendo", but [...] "Damon is a good sport with all the silliness, though, and seems more at ease here in the sitcom <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> in his last three films." [...] Eric McCormack, who portrays Will, said Damon was [...] "magnificent" [...] in the episode and a [...] "great experience" [...] for the cast of the show. Sean Hayes cites [...] "A Chorus Lie" [...] as one of his favorite episodes. In March 2006, Entertainment Weekly named Damon's guest spot as their number two most memorable guest appearance on Will & Grace.|$|E

500|$|Critical {{reception}} of the album was positive overall. Robin Denselow of The Guardian awarded the album four of five stars and wrote that Wainwright's performance sounded as [...] "easy-going and spontaneous" [...] and it does at his live concerts. Denselow considered [...] "House" [...] to be the album's best track. The Daily Telegraph Colin Irwin described the album as [...] "oddly uplifting" [...] despite its [...] "variants on the theme that we're all doomed" [...] from the economic crisis. The Observer contributor Neil Spencer wrote that [...] "while [...] tone becomes shrill at times, his mix of nihilism and jauntiness (with ukulele) are finally uplifting." [...] Music journalist Andy Gill of The Independent recommended the tracks [...] "House", [...] "Fear Itself [...] " [...] and [...] "The Panic Is On". Simmy Richman's review for The Independent complimented Wainwright's ability to address current issues [...] "simply and effectively", claiming [...] "Wainwright can make you laugh, nod in agreement, shake your fist in despair and want to sing along". Richman appreciated Wainwright's honesty and humor and wrote that he displayed [...] "better lyrical form <b>than</b> <b>he</b> <b>has</b> been in for some time". The Independent included 10 Songs on their [...] "Indy Choice: Best of the New Music" [...] list for the week of July 16, 2010. PopMatters' Alex Ramon preferred Wainwright's album Social Studies (1999), but considered 10 Songs to be [...] "an enjoyable effort nonetheless", complimenting it for its simple approach. Furthermore, Ramon wrote that the album [...] "succeeds in getting you smiling rather than despairing at the mess we're in, and that's {{always been one of}} Wainwright's great gifts".|$|E
