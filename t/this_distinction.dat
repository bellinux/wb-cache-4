5|$|In 2003, the stud {{book was}} divided into two parts: a section for pure Selle Français from two {{registered}} parents and a section for horses with one facteur de selle français parent. In 2009, <b>this</b> <b>distinction</b> was abandoned and the two sections were recombined into a single stud book.|$|E
5|$|The West also {{suffered}} more heavily from {{the instability of}} the 3rd century AD. <b>This</b> <b>distinction</b> between the established Hellenised East and the younger Latinised West persisted and became increasingly important in later centuries, leading to a gradual estrangement of the two worlds.|$|E
5|$|In the Standard Model of physics, {{electrons}} {{are truly}} elementary particles with no internal structure. However, both protons and neutrons are composite particles composed of elementary particles called quarks. There {{are two types}} of quarks in atoms, each having a fractional electric charge. Protons are composed of two up quarks (each with charge +) and one down quark (with a charge of −). Neutrons consist of one up quark and two down quarks. <b>This</b> <b>distinction</b> accounts for the difference in mass and charge between the two particles.|$|E

5|$|It {{is often}} {{difficult}} to superficially distinguish between male and female bigfin reef squids. Some authors say that females are generally smaller than males, but <b>this</b> <b>distinction</b> is not observed in other studies. Closer examination of sexually mature specimens, however, will usually distinguish males from females by the presence of the hectocotylus on the fourth left arm in males, and the nidamental glands and the pale ovaries within the mantle in females. Males also purportedly show a more conspicuous pattern of transverse streaks on their dorsal side.|$|E
5|$|Physical {{training}} goals {{pursued in}} conjunction with aikido include controlled relaxation, correct movement of joints such as hips and shoulders, flexibility, and endurance, with less emphasis on strength training. In aikido, pushing or extending movements are much more common than pulling or contracting movements. <b>This</b> <b>distinction</b> {{can be applied to}} general fitness goals for the aikido practitioner.|$|E

5|$|Possession can be {{expressed}} either by the possessive enclitic -s (also traditionally called a genitive suffix), or by the preposition of. Historically the -s possessive {{has been used for}} animate nouns, whereas the of possessive has been reserved for inanimate nouns. Today <b>this</b> <b>distinction</b> is less clear, and many speakers use -s also with inanimates. Orthographically the possessive -s is separated from the noun root with an apostrophe.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 2003, Crocodilia/Crocodylia was a {{group that}} {{encompassed}} the modern-day animals (the crown group) {{as well as their}} more distant relatives now in the larger groups called Crocodylomorpha and Pseudosuchia. Under its current definition Crocodylia is restricted to only the most recent ancestor of today's modern-day crocodilians (alligators, crocodiles, and gharials). <b>This</b> <b>distinction</b> is more important for paleontologists studying crocodilian evolution. As such, the alternate spellings Crocodilia and Crocodylia are still used interchangeably in the neontological literature.|$|E

5|$|Unlike most of Dunedin, {{which was}} settled by Scots, many early {{settlers}} in Caversham were English. This {{led to some}} degree of antagonism by the councils {{of the city and}} Caversham borough {{in the early days of}} settlement; Dunedin had been settled by the Presbyterian church, whereas Caversham's population was largely Anglican, Methodist, and Baptist. There is little evidence of <b>this</b> <b>distinction</b> in modern Caversham, other than the origins of local street names, several of which reflect the names of English counties and early English settlers.|$|E

5|$|According to Kuhn, {{science is}} an {{inherently}} communal activity {{which can only}} be done as part of a community. For him, the fundamental difference between science and other disciplines {{is the way in which}} the communities function. Others, especially Feyerabend and some post-modernist thinkers, have argued that there is insufficient difference between social practices in science and other disciplines to maintain <b>this</b> <b>distinction.</b> For them, social factors play an important and direct role in scientific method, but they do not serve to differentiate science from other disciplines. On this account, science is socially constructed, though this does not necessarily imply the more radical notion that reality itself is a social construct.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} the service was inaugurated, the LNC's trains were divided both by class and by religion, with {{separate}} Anglican and Nonconformist sections of the train. <b>This</b> <b>distinction</b> applied to both living and dead passengers. Intended to prevent persons from different social background from mixing and potentially distressing mourners and to prevent bodies of persons from different social classes being carried in the same compartment rather than to provide different facilities, the carriages intended for all classes and religions were very similar in design, and the primary difference was different ornamentation on the compartment doors.|$|E
5|$|Currently, the {{earliest}} listed film is Newark Athlete (1891), {{and the most}} recent is 13 Lakes (2004). Counting the 11multi-year serials in the NFR once each (as the NFR does) by year of completion, the years with the most films selected are 1928, 1939, and 1940, with 18films from each year chosen for preservation. The time between a film's debut and its selection varies greatly. The longest span is 121years; Edison Kinetographic Record of a Sneeze was originally released in 1894 and selected for preservation in 2015. The shortest span is the minimum 10years; <b>this</b> <b>distinction</b> is shared by Raging Bull, Do the Right Thing, Goodfellas, Toy Story, Fargo and 13 Lakes.|$|E

5|$|During Spring Training {{before the}} 2017 season, the final {{guaranteed}} year on Molina's contract, the Cardinals began {{to negotiate a}} contract extension that would attempt to keep Molina in St. Louis {{for the remainder of}} his career. He agreed to a three-year contract extension for a reported $60 million, making him the highest-paid catcher in baseball. He wasn't interested in exercising his 2018 mutual option, which would have been worth $15 million. The extension assures Molina of remaining in St. Louis through 2020, and increases the chances that he will finish his career having played for just one organization, the one that drafted him. <b>This</b> <b>distinction</b> of having Molina retire as a Cardinal is something that carried weight for both parties throughout the negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Historically {{a part of}} Lancashire, Milnrow {{during the}} Middle Ages was a hamlet located within the {{township}} of Butterworth and parish of Rochdale. It was named by the Anglo-Saxons, but the Norman conquest of England resulted in its ownership by minor Norman families, such as the Schofields and Cleggs. In the 15th century, the descendants of these families successfully agitated for a chapel of ease to be constructed in Milnrow by {{the banks of the}} River Beal, triggering its development as the main settlement in Butterworth. Despite <b>this</b> <b>distinction,</b> Milnrow did not increase much further in size or population until the dawn of the woollen trade in the Late Middle Ages.|$|E

It would change names again in 1955, this time to 100th Division (Replacement Training). It would once again be reorganized in 1959 to its present designation as 100th Division (Institutional Training). Its mission became to teach basic, advanced, and common training skills to soldiers from the Army's active, reserve, and National Guard components.|$|E
