40|$|This essay {{tries to}} analyse Turkey’s {{position}} and constraints in the WTO Nonagricultural Market Access Negotiations (NAMA) especially vis-à-vis developing countries. It basically, underlines Turkey’s unique negotiating position; de jure developing, de facto an advanced economy {{status in the}} WTO Doha NAMA negotiations. At Doha Ministerial Meeting in 2001, WTO members agreed to initiate negotiations to further liberalize trade, among other areas, on non-agricultural goods. For this purpose, the Negotiating Group on Market Access (NGMA) was created at {{the first meeting of}} the Trade Negotiations Committee of the WTO, in early 2002. Turkey has been quite active since then in NAMA negotiations in calibrating its position between offensive and defensive negotiation interests although its offensive market access interests largely outweigh defensive one. Turkey has also been propagating an offensive non-linear tariff cutting Swiss Formula approach at the WTO to curb the international high tariffs, <b>tariff</b> peaks and <b>escalations.</b> Having a strong offensive market access interests, Turkey mainly aims at large developing country markets diversifying its trade portfolio away from traditional markets towards large developing economies. From the perspective of governance, Turkey has serious constraints on its trade and industry policy space stemming from the Turkey-EU Customs Union (CU). Although Turkey is a de jure developing country in the WTO and will have all legal rights and mobligations stemming from the outcome of the DOHA, in practice, Turkey will have to implement the same applied common external tariffs of the EU. Despite the constraints and dilemmas stemming from the EU-Turkey customs union, it can be strongly argued that, it is in Turkey’s industrial interests to be actively involved in the WTO to tackle the high tariffs, <b>tariff</b> peaks and <b>escalations</b> which hinders Turkey’s exports to the world markets...|$|R

Opening markets globally and strengthening the World Trade Organisation (WTO) as {{the bedrock of}} the multilateral trading system is therefore an economic imperative. It {{is for this reason}} that we pledge today to engage personally and jointly in the launch of a new ambitious Round of global trade negotiations at the Fourth WTO Ministerial Conference in Doha, Qatar this November.

The new three-year trade round has development as its focus, with the Doha Development Agenda (DDA) as its core. The Doha Declaration sets 1 January 2005 as the date for completing all but two of the negotiations. To oversee the negotiation of individual subjects, a Trade Negotiations Committee (TNC) was established. The new round is ambitious insofar as it tackles some contentious issues. For instance: it seeks to phase out all forms of agricultural export subsidies and trade-distorting domestic farm support; it seeks to liberalize the entry of service-workers into foreign markets; it emphasizes the reduction or elimination of <b>tariff</b> peaks and <b>escalation,</b> especially with goods that would grant market access to developing countries; it seeks the reduction or eliminatio...|$|R
40|$|When {{looking at}} the {{conditions}} of trade in natural resources the world appears upside down: Tariff protection in natural resources sectors is generally lower than for overall merchandise trade, while export restrictions {{are twice as likely}} as in other sectors.

In this paper, we discuss how export taxes and <b>tariff</b> <b>escalation</b> {{may be the result of}} an uncooperative trade policy. Specifically, <b>tariff</b> <b>escalation</b> and export taxes can be beggar-thy-neighbor policies because governments may be tempted to use them to alter the relative price of exports to their advantage (terms-of-trade effect) or to expand the domestic processing industry at the expenses of foreign production (production relocation effect).

40|$|<b>Tariff</b> <b>escalation</b> {{becomes one}} of the major issues in the new Doha Round {{negotiation}} because it is viewed as a stumbling block to the industrialization development for the developing countries. When tariffs on products escalate with the stage of processing, the effective rate of protection, or the tariff expressed as fractions of value-added after deducting intermediate inputs from product value, also increases. Thus, <b>tariff</b> <b>escalation</b> potentially signals high rates of protection for value-added or processed products, and can inhibit international trade in these goods. The major {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the degrees of tariff escalations in Taiwan's agriculture -related commodities and the economic consequences to reduce them. A simplified theoretical model is first established to illustrate the structural impacts and welfare implications of reducing <b>tariff</b> <b>escalation.</b> Then a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of Taiwan is applied to simulate the economy-wide impacts of three alternative reduction proposals. The model distinguishes 160 sectors, 6 types of labor, 8 types of margins and 160 commodities compiled from the Input-Output tables of 2004. Simulation results indicate that if welfare improvement is the major policy concern, then Taiwan should favor the reduction because it improves the overall welfare of Taiwan. However, if farmers' welfare is the major policy concern, then Taiwan should act against the reduction. In case the consensus to reduce tariff escalations has been determined, then the second-best choice would be to offer upstream industries relatively smaller tariff reduction rates than the downstream industries. <b>tariff</b> <b>escalation,</b> tariff wedge, computable general equilibrium model, International Relations/Trade, F 13, C 68, Q 17,...|$|E
40|$|Although the EU imports raw {{materials}} from developing countries with zero or low tariffs, tariffs increase {{going up the}} value chain, according to a USDA GAIN Report. The reality of this <b>tariff</b> <b>escalation,</b> it maintains, citing the cases of rice and cocoa, is not compatible with the EU's proclaimed development objectives. Taking the example of rice, which is only included in the EBA to a limited degree until 2009, there is a 21 % increase in tariffs for husked rice versus paddy (rough) rice, and a 57 % increase if the rice is milled or semi-milled. This regime effectively limits semi-milled and milled rice imports into the EU to less than 20 % of total rice imports. The paper {{points out that in}} terms of rice imports from ACP countries the EU earns over € 10 million per annum in tariffs. What is more important is that it thereby inhibits the development of rice processing in ACP countries, with EU firms capturing the marketing margins on rice processing. 96 % of EU rice exports are of semi-milled or milled rice, and 45 % of the total go back to developing countries with the benefit of export refunds. With regard to cocoa the report notes a particular tariff peak on chocolate, arising partly from <b>tariff</b> <b>escalation</b> and partly from the supplementary duty charged, which is based on the sugar content of the chocolate. EBA countries (39 of which are also ACP) face no <b>tariff</b> <b>escalation,</b> but non-LDC ACP countries face a 12. 9 % duty, plus this supplementary sugar duty. The preferences extended to ACP countries have however encouraged more exports of cocoa paste and cocoa fat, butter and oil. Comment: The analysis contained in this report is based on the EU's standard GSP regime and {{does not take into account}} the EBA initiative established for least developed countries or the trade provisions of the Cotonou Agreement. It notes that duty-free access for rice is to be granted to LDC exporters by 2009, ending <b>tariff</b> <b>escalation</b> for these countries. However by that time, as a result of the implementation of rice-sector reforms, it is estimated that the European market price for rice will be 41 % below current levels.

40|$|Abstract: Sub Saharan African {{agriculture}} is currently facing challenges {{in international trade}} with respect to external market access conditions and competition in world markets {{as a result of}} trade liberalization efforts under the world trade organization (WTO) agreements and in particular the agreement on agriculture (AoA). This paper presents the performance of agricultural exports for selected countries and indicates external market barriers faced and the resulting implications of the barriers on WTO Doha Development Agenda (DDA) negotiations. The composition of agricultural exports and markets shows that exports from Sub Saharan Africa are less diversified with only five commodities mainly coffee, cocoa, cotton, hides and skins, and horticultural crops dominating in most countries. Markets are also concentrated on only a few countries with the European Union being a major market although intra Africa trade has increased in recent years because of regional integration efforts. Important external market access barriers faced are <b>tariff</b> peaks and <b>escalation</b> particularly for agro-processed and livestock products in developed countries and non tariff barriers particularly sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) and technical barriers to trade (TBTs) measures, safeguard and anti-dumping measures, and domestic and export subsidies on agricultural products for developed countries.

40|$|Navajos, or Dine 2 ̆ 7, were {{dramatically}} {{affected by}} rapid changes {{in two of}} the three largest post- Civil War domestic industries: agriculture and textiles. In my 2010 TSA paper, I revealed how changes in the wool <b>tariff</b> triggered an <b>escalation</b> in textile production by thousands of Navajo weavers, as traders sought ways to market the unstandardized wool clip. Another under researched aspect of Navajo history concerns how the federal government 2 ̆ 7 s haphazard attempts in up-breeding Navajo flocks to national market standards triggered a failed development policy, resulting in the reduction of one-half their livestock during the Depression. For sixty years the government restricted traders from purchasing breeding stock in order to ensure Navajos 2 ̆ 7 self-support. This proscription coupled with a lack of price supports for purchase of non-breeding stock to relieve overcrowding, resulted in an overgrazed range. Thus, conflicting government policies culminated in stock reduction which targeted churros, the coarse-woolled breed preferred by spinners and weavers. Weisiger (2009) reveals how this centerpiece of John Collier 2 ̆ 7 s conservation reforms failed because Navajo women, owners of all of the goats and most of the sheep, were shut out of the political process. Many Dine 2 ̆ 7 resisted up-breeding since churros have resilient characteristics lacking in other breeds.

40|$|The author {{analyzes}} 61 {{trade policy}} reviews {{prepared for the}} World Trade Organization (WTO) and its predecessor, GATT - reviews that document the progress developing countries have made in integration with the world trading system over the past decade. Based on an analysis of post-Uruguay Round tariff and nontariff barriers worldwide, he then recommends developing country positions on major issues inthe new round of WTO trade negotiations. His key conclusions and recommendations: 1) Agriculture. Developing countries should support the Cairns Group in its push for greater liberalization of industrial countries'agricultural trade policies; the revised Food Aid Convention is {{not a substitute for}} but a complement to worldwide liberalization of agriculture. 2) Manufactures. The existence of <b>tariff</b> peaks and <b>escalation</b> in industrial country markets and the limited bindings at relatively high levels of developing country tariffs on manufactures present opportunities for negotiations with good prospects for shared and balanced benefits. The remaining nontariff barriers in industrial countries that affect manufactures are concentrated in textiles and clothing. Developing countries should ensure that industrial countries implement their commitments to liberalize this sector and impose no new nontariff barriers in this or other sectors under the guise of other rules or arrangements. The remaining nontariff barriers in developing countries should be converted into tariffs and reduced over time as part of the negotiations. 3) Antidumping. The increased use of antidumping measures by high- and middle-income developing countries in recent periods offers an opportunity for balanced negotiations to restrict their use. Reduced use of antidumping measures would increase efficiency and benefit consumers in all countries. But it is unclear whether a supportive climate for such negotiations exists in either industrial or developing countries.

40|$|Call {{quality has}} been crucial from the {{inception}} of telecommunication networks. Operators need to monitor call quality from the end-user¿s perspective, in order to retain subscribers and reduce subscriber ¿churn¿. Operators worry not only about call quality and interconnect revenue loss, but also about network connectivity issues in areas where mobile network gateways are prevalent. Bandwidth quality as experienced by the end-user is equally important in helping operators to reduce churn. The parameters that network operators use to improve call quality are mainly from the end-user¿s perspective. These parameters are usually ASR (answer seizure ratio), PDD (postdial delay), NER (network efficiency ratio), the number of calls for which these parameters have been analyzed and successful calls. Operators use these parameters to evaluate and optimize the network to meet their quality requirements. Analysis of speech quality is a major arena for research. Traditionally, users¿ perception of speech quality has been measured offline using subjective listening tests. Such tests are, however, slow, tedious and costly. An alternative method is therefore needed; {{one that can be}} automatically computed on the subscriber¿s handset, be available to the operator as well as to subscribers and, at the same time, provide results that are comparable with conventional subjective scores. QMeter® ¿ a set of tools for signal and bandwidth measurement that have been developed bearing in mind all the parameters that influence call and bandwidth quality experienced by the end-user ¿ addresses these issues and, additionally, facilitates dynamic tariff propositions which enhance the credibility of the operator. This research focuses on call quality parameters from the end-user¿s perspective. The call parameters used in the research are signal strength, successful call rate, normal drop call rate, and hand-over drop rate. Signal strength is measured for every five milliseconds of an active call and average signal strength is calculated for each successful call. The successful call rate, normal drop rate and hand-over drop rate are used to achieve a measurement of the overall call quality. Call quality with respect to bundles of 10 calls is proposed. An attempt is made to visualize these parameters for better understanding of where the quality is bad, good and excellent. This will help operators, as well as user groups, to measure quality and coverage. Operators boast about their bandwidth but in reality, to know the locations where speed has to be improved, they need a tool that can effectively measure speed from the end-user¿s perspective. BM (bandwidth meter), a tool developed as a part of this research, measures the average speed of data sessions and stores the information for analysis at different locations. To address issues of quality in the subscriber segment, this research proposes the varying of tariffs based on call and bandwidth quality. Call charging based on call quality as perceived by the end-user is proposed, both to satisfy subscribers and help operators to improve customer satisfaction and increase average revenue per user. Tariff redemption procedures are put forward for bundles of 10 calls and 10 data sessions. In addition to the varying of <b>tariffs,</b> quality <b>escalation</b> processes are proposed. Deploying such tools on selected or random samples of users will result in substantial improvement in user loyalty which, in turn, will bring operational and economic advantages...|$|R
40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the effects}} of <b>tariff</b> <b>escalation</b> on Ghanaian cocoa exports in four importing markets: USA, EU, Japan and Malaysia.

From a dynamic perspective however, the relationship between tariff structures in these importing countries and Ghanaian cocoa exports is somewhat ambiguous and each situation has to be viewed on their own merit.

Recognising the {{concerns}} in the current Doha Round of trade negotiations that developing country access to developed country markets are high on the agenda, the paper explores the issue of market access where some developing countries export high-value processed goods and others export raw commodities. In this context, tariffs apply on both goods such that we have the possibility of <b>tariff</b> <b>escalation.</b> The domestic market is characterised by oligopoly at both stages of the marketing chain such that we have successive oligopoly. Employing a rule that market access for these two developing country exporters should not be discriminatory, the results show that reducing tariffs on both goods by the same amount will lead to bias in market access concessions. Conversely, in order to maintain the balance of market access between these two countries, <b>tariff</b> <b>escalation</b> should rise. The form this takes depends upon whether competition in the domestic market is characterised by strategic substitutes or strategic complements. The overall message of the paper is that market access issues for goods that can enter at different stages of the marketing chain should take into consideration the potential existence of successively oligopolistic markets. ...|$|E

I model a vertically differentiated international duopoly, with one firm in each country. A domestic and an exporting firm choose the quality of their goods and then compete in the domestic market. Both quantity and price conjectures are considered. The paper investigates the case where the government of the exporting country imposes a VIE before firms 2 ̆ 7 quality decision. I show that the VIE is a powerful protection to the exporting firm not only at the quantity or price competition stage but also when the impact of VIE on quality choice are taken into account. I also indicate the possibility that a VIE below the laissez faire solution binds.;On the invasive species (IS) risk, the dissertation analyzes the linkage between protectionism and invasive species hazard in the context of two-way trade and multilateral trade liberalization. In a perfectly competitive two way trade model, I show that the multilateral trade integration is much more likely to increase the damage from invasive species than predicted by unilateral trade liberalization under the classical Heckscher-Ohlin-Samuelson framework.

40|$|The EU Agriculture Commissioner {{has called}} for more {{targeted}} trade deals as being better for poorer countries than 'unregulated free trade'. The USDA has attacked the EU on <b>tariff</b> <b>escalation,</b> although it does not affect LDCs significantly; it has also questioned {{the benefits of the}} EBA, although the figures it cites take no account of the weakening value of the US dollar. It has also criticised continuing export subsidies, although their present rapid removal is unlikely to materially help developing country producers in the face of continuing high levels of support to EU agriculture.

40|$|An {{important}} issue in {{multilateral trade negotiations}} is the approach taken to reduce tariffs. The authors {{believe that there are}} important advantages in formula approaches and survey a range of options between the sharply top-down Swiss formula and proportional cuts in tariffs. Over the range the authors consider, they find that the economic efficiency impacts for the importer are not greatly influenced by the extent to which higher tariffs face bigger cuts. However, top-down approaches appear to be more effective in reducing <b>tariff</b> <b>escalation,</b> and provide greater market access gains to poor countries.

40|$|An 'ambitious {{programme}} of tariff reductions' was tabled by the EC at the WTO on November 9 th 2002. According to the Commission {{the offer}} will eliminate tariff peaks and high tariffs and significantly reduce <b>tariff</b> <b>escalation,</b> in areas {{which account for}} over 70 % of developing country exports. Comment: The EU offer only covers non-agricultural products, and therefore does not directly impinge on ACP-EU agricultural trade relations. What is more, the EU's definition of 'developing countries' includes such countries as Malta and Slovenia, giving the trade profile of the group a somewhat different profile {{from that of the}} ACP group, whose exports are much highly concentrated in agricultural and mineral exports. An 'ambitious programme of tariff reductions' was [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is that of going “back to basics”, {{focusing}} on the importance of market access issues for developing countries in the WTO negotiations begun in Doha in 2001. Data on protection patterns in agriculture and manufacturing are analysed, with a special focus on the issues of tariff peaks and escalation. The likely impact of several liberalisation scenarios is evaluated using GTAP. The broad conclusion is that developing countries still have sizable potential gains from improved market access in merchandise trade, but the size and the distribution of these gains depend much {{on the extent to which}} developing countries will be active in the liberalization process and on the agreed negotiation targets and modalities. multilateral trade liberalization, CGE modeling, tariff peaks, <b>tariff</b> <b>escalation...</b>|$|E
