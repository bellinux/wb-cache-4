Harrison was interested in expanding American influence in Hawaii and in establishing a naval base at Pearl Harbor but had not previously expressed an opinion on annexing the islands. The United States consul in Hawaii John L. Stevens recognized the new government on February 1, 1893 and forwarded their proposals to Washington. With just one month left before leaving office, the administration signed a treaty on February 14 and submitted it to the Senate <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>with</b> Harrison's recommendation.

5|$|Much {{time was}} spent on getting guitars to sound as Simon preferred. A bit of {{experimentation}} among the additional session players occurred, from which Simon would edit himself, compiling them together or often deleting them altogether. Many songs were recorded with a hand-built cigar-box guitar, which Simon bought from Mississippi blues musician Super Chikan. Analogue effects were applied before recording digitally to keep mixes simple; this method also inspired Simon while arranging the songs. Smith would burn Simon a compact disc each evening of the day’s session, and he would return <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>day</b> <b>with</b> notes on the recordings. This resulted in mixes being created as the album developed, {{rather than at the}} end of the process. Simon and Ramone often listened to their recordings while driving around, noting what would need changes.|$|E
