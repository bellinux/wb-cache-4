5|$|In July 1969, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> {{derailment}} near Cheadle Hulme {{involving a}} freight diesel locomotive. It injured {{no one but}} blocked services to Crewe and Stoke-on-Trent for several hours.|$|E
5|$|On August21, a {{tropical}} depression formed near Yap. After moving erratically {{to the south}} and northwest, the system dissipated on August25 to the east of the Philippines. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> short-lived depression on August28 to the east of Guam, dissipating a day later.|$|E

5|$|Although no jersey was awarded, {{there was}} also a {{classification}} for the teams, in which the stage finish times of the best three cyclists per team were added; the leading team was the one with the lowest total time. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> team classification that awarded points to each team based off their riding's finishing position in every stage. The team with the highest total of points was the leader of the classification.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the Polish, Czech and German national orientations <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> group living in the area, the Ślązakowcy, who claimed a distinct Silesian national identity. This group enjoyed popular support throughout the whole of Cieszyn Silesia although its strongest supporters were among the Protestants in {{eastern part of the}} Cieszyn Silesia (now part of Poland) and not in Zaolzie itself.|$|E
5|$|Land erosion has {{damaged the}} East Blockhouse site; the north wall {{collapsed}} before 1975, and between 2010 and 2011 <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> major landslip. An archaeological {{survey of the}} blockhouse, funded by the Welsh heritage agency Cadw, took place in 2011. The East Blockhouse is the only such defensive structure to survive in Wales and is protected under UK law as a scheduled monument.|$|E
50|$|The nuraghe {{was made}} entirely from basaltic rocks, having a complex {{structure}} with a polylobate bastion and towers underground. Above it <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a church erected in 1970 {{in honor of}} St. Lussorio. Near <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>another</b> ancient church below which <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>another</b> small nuraghe.|$|R

5|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> {{meeting in}} March 1966. John McGlynn, an {{executive}} from the Ford Motor Company, {{suggested that there}} was a need to encourage other clubs from areas outside Geelong to start up. By September 1966, there were clubs in Geelong, Belmont, Newtown, Lara, Corio YMCA and St Thomas. They were all based around local high schools.|$|E
5|$|A {{short-lived}} {{tropical depression}} formed on September3 in the South China Sea, dissipating {{the next day}} while moving eastward. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> short-lived tropical depression that developed on September4 near the Marianas Islands, but dissipated within one day. Another tropical depression formed on September4 {{to the west of}} the Marianas Islands, which moved to the south and later northeast, dissipating on September6. On September10, a tropical depression formed northeast of Luzon, lasting only two days while moving in a circular track.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th {{century the}} bishop began {{to reside in}} Llandaff {{for the first time}} in centuries; no bishops of the see resided in Llandaff for almost 300 years. In 1836 <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> {{unsuccessful}} attempt to transfer the see—this time to Bristol. After the attempt at transferring the see, the office of Dean was restored to Llandaff; the position had not been filled in 700 years. The office of Dean was separated from that of the Archdeacon of Llandaff in November 1843. The restoration of the Dean's office was the beginning of better times for the cathedral. The new Dean, William Bruce Knight, was instrumental in bringing about the much-needed restorations.|$|E

5|$|In 2009 <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> major fish kill, {{with over}} 200 dead fish found near the Fofanny water {{treatment}} works. There were approximately 150 trout and 55 salmon killed. The Northern Ireland Environment Agency investigated the incident and identified a potential source. It {{was revealed that}} an emergency discharge was carried out at Fofanny Water Treatment Work from 5am to 7am, due to a generator failure. The discharge was stopped as soon as personnel arrived at the site. Northern Ireland Water claimed the discharge was necessary to maintain the drinking water supply from Fofanny Dam. Measures have been since {{been put in place}} to prevent a similar incident in the future.|$|E
5|$|Not {{much had}} {{changed by the}} 1960s. The day began with a waking bell at 6:45am. After a {{prisoner}} count, they moved into the yard until 7:30, when they collected breakfast {{and headed back to}} their cells. The 8:00 bell signaled a parade, and then the start of work, which lasted until 11:15. They ate a meal, locked in their cells until 12:20pm, followed by some time in the yards. At 1:00 <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> parade, and another session of work which lasted to 4:15. Another meal was collected, and prisoners were locked away in their cells overnight. The lights stayed on until 9:30pm. On the weekends the routine featured no work, and included a film played for the prisoners.|$|E
5|$|On 27 December {{the poster}} bearing Gardstein's picture {{was seen by}} his landlord, who alerted police. Wensley and his colleagues visited the lodgings on Gold Street, Stepney and found knives, a gun, ammunition, false {{passports}} and revolutionary publications. Two days later <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> hearing at the Guildhall police court. In addition to Federoff, Peters and Dubof, present in the dock were Milstein and Trassjonsky. With some of the defendants having a low standard of English, interpreters were used throughout the proceedings. At {{the end of the}} day the case was adjourned until 6 January 1911.|$|E

5|$|The McCanns' {{children}} {{slept in}} a bedroom next to the front door, which the McCanns kept locked. The bedroom had one waist-high window with curtains and a metal exterior shutter, the latter controlled by a cord inside the window; the McCanns kept the curtains and shutter closed throughout the holiday. The window overlooked a narrow walkway and residents' car park, which was separated by a low wall from the street. Madeleine {{slept in a}} single bed next to the bedroom door, {{on the opposite side}} of the room from the window, while the twins were in travel cots in the middle of the room. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>another,</b> empty, single bed underneath the window.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> {{controversial}} {{incident in}} 1991. Prost's inferior Ferrari {{was unable to}} put up a challenge regularly to Senna's frontrunning McLaren. At the German Grand Prix at Hockenheim, Prost battled Senna for 4th place, but he felt Senna defended too aggressively and at the first chicane forced Prost to take avoiding action by using the escape road. Prost stalled his car rejoining the race. Coincidentally, Senna ran out of fuel on the last lap at the very same point.|$|E
5|$|<b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> {{pollution}} incident in March 2008 when twenty {{miles of the}} river turned orange. Iron oxide from old mine workings near the source at Irwell Springs had polluted the water since 1969 and in 1997 a Coal Authority survey identified the stretch as having the fourth worst case of minewater pollution in the country. A treatment plant was built in 1999 to remove the pollution {{at a cost of}} £1M; however, it is thought that there was a collapse in the mine after heavy rains in the spring of 2008. Although the water was stained with ochre, no damage to wildlife was reported.|$|E

5|$|Widespread {{rainfall}} occurred throughout Central America {{in early}} October 2008 {{due to the}} passage of a tropical wave through the region. Later, another tropical wave approached the region, which was believed to have left the west coast of Africa on September17. The wave developed a low pressure area on October10 in the southwestern Caribbean, with sporadic convection. On October13, the system consisted of a large area of convection drifting northward offshore eastern Central America, and Dvorak classifications began, indicating gradual organization. At that time, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> low pressure area on the Pacific coast, and both systems were producing rainfall across Central America.|$|E
5|$|A battle {{fought in}} this zone and tragic for the Israelis was {{completely}} eclipsed from their collective memory. On 18 July, a company from the 1st Battalion of Yiftach Brigade received {{the order to}} capture Qirbet Quriqur, an outpost protecting {{the only way for}} the Legion to get to Latrun located several kilometres {{to the north of the}} place. Intelligence services had not informed the responsible officer that nearby <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> outpost, occupied by a reinforced company of the Legion. From there the legionnaires could observe all the operations of the Israelis and called for reinforcements, notably armoured vehicles. When they mounted the counter-attack, the Israelis were taken by a lightning strike in an encircling movement. No troops were available there to reinforce them, so they had to retreat in plain daylight. 45 Israeli soldiers, nineteen of them aged 18 or less, lost their lives.|$|E
5|$|Despite their {{previous}} failures, the Chinese launched another series of attacks from 11:30 and these attacks continued {{for the next}} two hours, again targeting 12 Platoon under the command of Lieutenant John Ward. Failing to break through again, the Chinese suffered heavy casualties before the assault ended. From 13:30 <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>another</b> lull in the fighting {{for an hour and a}} half, although D Company continued to endure Chinese mortar, machine-gun and rifle fire. Believing that the battle may continue into the night, Gravener made the decision to pull 12 Platoon back in order to adopt a tighter company perimeter, lest his forward platoon be overrun and destroyed. The movement was completed without incident and, shortly after, the newly vacated position was assaulted by a large Chinese force which had failed to detect the withdrawal. The Chinese moved quickly as they attempted to establish their position on the northern end of the ridge, only to be heavily engaged by Australian machine-gun and rifle fire, and artillery.|$|E
