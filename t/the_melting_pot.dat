5|$|Oliver Cromwell, {{who led the}} {{uprising}} and declined invitations to be made king, became Lord Protector of England in 1657. It was marked by a ceremony in Westminster Hall, where he donned purple robes, sat on the Coronation Chair, and was invested {{with many of the}} traditional symbols of sovereignty, except a crown. A crown, perhaps saved from <b>the</b> <b>melting</b> <b>pot</b> in 1649, was placed beside Cromwell at his lying in state in 1660.|$|E
5|$|With the Coinage Act of 1873, {{the dollar}} {{was no longer}} {{equivalent}} to a set amount of silver, a statutory change made so that {{as the price of}} silver dropped with increased U.S. production, mining companies could not present their bullion at the mints and receive it back, struck into silver dollars worth more as money than they were as metal. By the post-World War II era, the Bureau of the Mint was striking the three remaining precious metal coins, the dime, quarter and half dollar in 90 percent silver—the dollar had not been coined since 1935 and circulated little outside some Western states like Nevada and Montana. The metal in a silver dollar was worth more as bullion than as money above $1.2929 per troy ounce; the smaller coins would be attractive for <b>the</b> <b>melting</b> <b>pot</b> above $1.38 per ounce.|$|E
5|$|Music intertwines with {{aspects of}} American social and {{cultural}} identity, including through social class, race and ethnicity, geography, religion, language, gender, and sexuality. The relationship between music and race {{is perhaps the most}} potent determiner of musical meaning in the United States. The development of an African American musical identity, out of disparate sources from Africa and Europe, has been a constant theme in the music history of the United States. Little documentation exists of colonial-era African American music, when styles, songs, and instruments from across West Africa commingled in <b>the</b> <b>melting</b> <b>pot</b> of slavery. By the mid-19th century, a distinctly African American folk tradition was well-known and widespread, and African American musical techniques, instruments, and images became a part of mainstream American music through spirituals, minstrel shows, and slave songs. African American musical styles became an integral part of American popular music through blues, jazz, rhythm and blues, and then rock and roll, soul, and hip hop; all of these styles were consumed by Americans of all races, but were created in African American styles and idioms before eventually becoming common in performance and consumption across racial lines. In contrast, country music derives from both African and European, as well as Native American and Hawaiian, traditions and yet has long been perceived as a form of white music.|$|E

25|$|In <b>The</b> <b>Melting</b> <b>Pot</b> (1908), playwright Israel Zangwill (1864–1926) {{explored}} {{issues that}} dominated Progressive Era debates about immigration policies.

After four decades of civil unrest and war, Mexico saw the development of philosophy and the arts, promoted by President Díaz himself.

25|$|Slavery as an {{institution}} in Brazil was unrivaled {{in all of the}} Americas. The sheer number of African slaves brought to Brazil and moved around South America greatly influenced the entirety of the Americas.

The mixture of African religions that survived throughout slavery and Catholicism, Candomblé, has created some of the most interesting and diverse cultural aspects. In Bahia, statues of African gods called Orishas pay homage to the unique African presence in the nation’s largest Afro-Brazilian state. Not only are these Orishas direct links to their past ancestry, but also reminders to the cultures the Brazilian people come from. Condomblé and the Orishas serve as an ever-present reminder that African slaves were brought to Brazil. Though their lives were different in Brazil, their culture has been preserved at least to some degree.|$|E
