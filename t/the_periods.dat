Since each letter corresponds to two numbers, it infers half <b>the</b> <b>period,</b> not <b>the</b> <b>period</b> directly. Thus, odd periods are more secure than even, because the statistical anomalies register both on half <b>the</b> <b>period</b> rounded down and rounded up.|$|R

This is often the same as <b>the</b> <b>period</b> of <b>the</b> puffer, but sometimes is a factor of <b>the</b> <b>period.</b> A puffer for which <b>the</b> apparent <b>period</b> deduced from <b>the</b> debris is smaller than <b>the</b> <b>period</b> of <b>the</b> engine is a pseudoperiod puffer.

5|$|Statistical ranking systems place Lasker {{high among}} the {{greatest}} players of all time.

In his 1978 book The Rating of Chessplayers, Past and Present, Arpad Elo gave retrospective ratings to players {{based on their}} performance over the best five-year span of their career. He concluded that Lasker was the joint second strongest player of those surveyed (tied with Botvinnik and behind Capablanca).

5|$|The first {{quantitative}} {{estimate of}} the speed of light was made in 1676 by Rømer (see Rømer's determination {{of the speed of}} light). From the observation that <b>the</b> <b>periods</b> of Jupiter's innermost moon Io appeared to be shorter when the Earth was approaching Jupiter than when receding from it, he concluded that light travels at a finite speed, and estimated that it takes light 22 minutes to cross the diameter of Earth's orbit. Christiaan Huygens combined this estimate with an estimate for the diameter of the Earth's orbit to obtain an estimate of speed of light of , 26% lower than the actual value.|$|E
5|$|Van Gogh's stylistic {{developments}} are usually linked to <b>the</b> <b>periods</b> he spent living {{in different places}} across Europe. He was inclined to immerse himself in local cultures and lighting conditions, although he maintained a highly individual visual outlook throughout. His evolution as an artist was slow, and {{he was aware of}} his painterly limitations. He moved home often, perhaps to expose himself to new visual stimuli, and through exposure develop his technical skill. Art historian Melissa McQuillan believes the moves also reflect later stylistic changes, and that Van Gogh used the moves to avoid conflict, and as a coping mechanism for when the idealistic artist was faced with the realities of his then current situation.|$|E

The mix of aircraft carried varied {{from time to}} time. During the late 1960s and 1970s Melbourne made regular deployments throughout the Pacific region to exercise with the Royal Navy and US Navy. In May 1972, 805 Squadron's strength was increased to eight Skyhawks, and it temporarily operated with ten of the type during Exercise Kangaroo in May 1974. A-4Gs were embarked on board the carrier when she visited the United Kingdom in 1977 {{to participate in the}} Jubilee Fleet Review, and one of the Skyhawks also took part in that year's Royal International Air Tattoo. Melbourne underwent major refits between December 1970 and August 1971, mid-1975 to June 1976 and from July 1978 to February 1979.
