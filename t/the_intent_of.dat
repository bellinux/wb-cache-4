5|$|A BT49B {{specification}} appeared {{early in}} the 1980 season; it was conceived around a new transverse gearbox designed by American gearbox specialist Pete Weismann.

An alternative rear suspension layout was designed to go with this gearbox. It replaced the standard pullrods with rocker arms that activated vertical coil springs mounted behind the gearbox. The Weismann unit proved difficult to make reliable and was used alongside the original gearbox, mainly on a spare chassis, until the Dutch Grand Prix, after which it was put to one side.|$|E

5|$|After many {{boats were}} wrecked and {{several hundred people}} died, the North-West Mounted Police (NWMP) {{introduced}} safety rules, vetting the boats carefully and forbidding women and children to travel through the rapids.

During the summer, a horse-powered rail-tramway was built by Norman Macaulay, capable of carrying boats and equipment through the canyon at $25 ($680) a time, removing the need for prospectors to navigate the rapids.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examined}} {{the development of}} children's understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> persuasive <b>intent</b> <b>of</b> advertising, which was defined as {{their understanding of the}} purpose of advertisements to persuade people to buy the advertised products. Previous research has found age-related changes in the development of this understanding. However, {{little is known about the}} sources of developmental changes in this understanding. A series of 6 experimental studies explored children's understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> persuasive <b>intent</b> <b>of</b> advertising and their scepticism towards advertisements in relation to their theory of mind and their understanding of the marketplace. Children's understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> persuasive <b>intent</b> <b>of</b> advertising and their scepticism towards advertisements were assessed in interviews. Established false belief tasks were used to assess children's theory of mind, and novel measures were developed to measure children's understanding of the marketplace. It was found that children's understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> persuasive <b>intent</b> <b>of</b> advertising was positively related to their second order theory of mind and to their understanding of how advertising is causally related to economic variables such as sales and demand. However, children's understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> persuasive <b>intent</b> <b>of</b> advertising was not related to their understanding of persuasion in social contexts. Moreover, children who recognised <b>the</b> persuasive <b>intent</b> <b>of</b> advertising did not necessarily evaluate advertisements on the basis of the advertisers' motives. Rather, children who believed the priority of businesses was to pursue financial gain, rather than to serve the welfare of customers, were more likely to be sceptical towards advertisements because of the advertisers' self-serving interests. This thesis provides some evidence that the development of children's understanding of advertising is related to their cognitive development and their understanding of the marketplace.
