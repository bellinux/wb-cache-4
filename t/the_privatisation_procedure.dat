40|$|The {{two great}} {{challenges}} for any authority are {{to what extent}} and how to intervene in thefunctioning of the society. These challenges originate both {{in the world of}} ideologies, defining the type ofstate or authority based on its propensity for regulation, and in the technical expertise of technocraticmanagement that can identify the “good practice” and “good governance” features. Both policy sources arenecessary and legitimate. The ideological sources help support a representative mandate obtained by anelected power, being validated by citizens’ vote, while the technical ones contribute to optimising theefficiency of the public option by managing it in an appropriate manner. To set a simple example, if theideological option is in favour of maintaining a company under state ownership, then the technical optionmay be to ensure a competency-based management controlled solely according to performance criteria. Ifthe ideological option promotes <b>the</b> <b>privatisation</b> of a state-owned company, then the technical option mayseek to ensure a <b>privatisation</b> <b>procedure</b> that should maximise the public benefit (through price, othercontractual terms, enhanced market competition, clauses or measures to protect consumers, etc. ...|$|R

40|$|The late 1980 s {{and early}} 1990 s were characterised by {{unprecedented}} waves of <b>privatisation</b> in <b>the</b> world. Like other developing economies, Botswana {{jumped into the}} bandwagon and laid the legal framework for privatisation by way of promulgating a Privatisation Policy for Botswana in 2000. It is notable that despite the promulgation of <b>the</b> Policy, <b>privatisation</b> will only commence with <b>the</b> <b>privatisation</b> of <b>the</b> National Development Bank (NDB) in late 2011. This paper, relying on a variety sources; for example, newspaper accounts, personal interviews etc traces <b>the</b> <b>privatisation</b> process beginning with the appointment of <b>the</b> <b>Privatisation</b> Task Force in 1997, the passage of <b>the</b> <b>Privatisation</b> Policy for Botswana in 2000 and right up to <b>the</b> aborted <b>privatisation</b> of Air Botswana and the recent decision to privatise the NDB. Largely drawing from the Air Botswana saga, the paper argues that key firsts, being the delineation of an institutional-legal framework and public education on privatisation, either did not happen first or sloppily happened. As it is, Botswana has crossed the Rubicon, therefore, there is no going back on <b>privatisation.</b> Hence, as <b>the</b> government goes ahead with <b>the</b> <b>privatisation</b> of NDB, and the Botswana Telecommunications Corporation thereafter, {{there is a need}} to either do first things firstly or do them correctly so that <b>the</b> <b>privatisation</b> project can be successfully delivered. Principally, the powers of the both the executive and legislative arms of government must be delineated in regard to privatisation and public education must be an ongoing exercise to ensure a buy-in. </p...|$|R
