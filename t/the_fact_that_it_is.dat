5|$|Fleming {{developed}} the James Bond character more in Goldfinger {{than in the}} previous six novels, presenting him as a more complex individual, whilst also bringing out a theme of Bond as Saint George. The Saint George theme is echoed by <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a British agent sorting out an American problem.|$|E
5|$|Thio {{also argued}} that without a constitutionally {{expressed}} right to vote, the judiciary is handicapped in interpreting this implied right, given its conservative approach to reading the Constitution and <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> unlikely to appeal to normative ideas such as representative democracy.|$|E
5000|$|The genus name {{derives from}} the Greek word spora ("spore") and the Latin word sarcina ("package", [...] "bundle") and refers to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> forms endospores and the typical {{arrangement}} of the cells. The species name S. aquimarina derives from <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was found in sea water.|$|R

5|$|Above {{the central}} figure shines a single small star {{at the very top}} of the picture, serving as a symbol of further hope beyond that of {{the central figure}} herself. The {{distance}} of the star from the central figure, and <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> outside her field of vision even were she not blindfolded, suggests an ambiguity. It provides an uplifting message to the viewer that things are not as bad for the central character as she believes, and introduces a further element of pathos in that she is unaware of hope existing elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Adrastea {{is one of}} the few moons in the Solar System {{known to}} orbit its planet in less than the length of that planet's day. It orbits at the edge of Jupiter's Main Ring and is thought to be the main {{contributor}} of material to the Rings of Jupiter. Despite observations made in the 1990s by the Galileo spacecraft, very little is known about the moon's physical characteristics other than its size and <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> tidally locked to Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Although {{polyadenylation}} is seen {{in almost}} all organisms, it is not universal. However, the wide distribution of this modification and <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> present in organisms from all three domains of life implies that the last universal common ancestor of all living organisms, it is presumed, had some form of polyadenylation system. A few organisms do not polyadenylate mRNA, which implies that they have lost their polyadenylation machineries during evolution. Although no examples of eukaryotes that lack polyadenylation are known, mRNAs from the bacterium Mycoplasma gallisepticum and the salt-tolerant archaean Haloferax volcanii lack this modification.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of Carter and Rosas' writing, vision had not been {{directly}} studied, but field observations show the animal primarily hunts by sight; above water, {{it is able to}} recognize observers at great distances. <b>The</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> exclusively active during the day further suggests its eyesight should be strong, to aid in hunting and predator avoidance. In other otter species, vision is generally normal or slightly myopic, both on land and in water. The giant otter's hearing is acute and its sense of smell is excellent.|$|E
5|$|It also {{provides}} a powerful toolkit for studying strongly coupled quantum field theories. Much of {{the usefulness of the}} duality results from <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a strong-weak duality: when the fields of the quantum field theory are strongly interacting, the ones in the gravitational theory are weakly interacting and thus more mathematically tractable. This fact has been used to study many aspects of nuclear and condensed matter physics by translating problems in those subjects into more mathematically tractable problems in string theory.|$|E
5|$|Little Fishing Creek {{was entered}} into the Geographic Names Information System on August 2, 1979. Its {{identifier}} in the Geographic Names Information System is 1179545. The creek is named for <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> smaller than Fishing Creek, which it is a tributary of. Little fishing Creek {{is also known as}} Hemlock Creek. This variant name appears in a 1982 map of Columbia County published by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.|$|E

5|$|Of the six common strong {{mineral acids}} in chemistry, {{hydrochloric}} acid is the monoprotic acid {{least likely to}} undergo an interfering oxidation-reduction reaction. It {{is one of the}} least hazardous strong acids to handle; despite its acidity, it consists of the non-reactive and non-toxic chloride ion. Intermediate-strength hydrochloric acid solutions are quite stable upon storage, maintaining their concentrations over time. These attributes, plus <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> available as a pure reagent, make hydrochloric acid an excellent acidifying reagent.|$|E
5|$|Parasites {{recorded}} on the European nightjar include {{a single species}} of biting louse found on the wings, and a feather mite that occurs only on the white wing markings. Avian malaria has also been recorded. The leucocytozoon blood parasite L. caprimulgi is rare in the European nightjar. Its scarcity and <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> {{the only one of}} its genus found in nightjars support the suggestion that it has crossed over from close relatives that normally infect owls.|$|E

5|$|The Polled Dorset is a {{breed of}} sheep {{developed}} for meat at the North Carolina State University Small Ruminant Unit in 1956. The name refers to <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> a hornless variation of the Horned Dorset breed. The Polled Dorset {{is the result of}} a genetic mutation by which some of the offspring of a certain ram grew no horns. After some years of breeding work, a strain of Dorset was developed which had lost the characteristic horns and which bred true.|$|E
5|$|The first {{scientific}} {{description of}} the night shark was published by Cuban zoologist Felipe Poey in 1868, {{as part of a}} series of papers entitled Repertorio fisico-natural de la isla de Cuba. He based his description on a single set of jaws and gave it the name Hypoprion signatus. In 1973, Leonard Compagno synonymized the genus Hypoprion with Carcharhinus. No type specimen has been designated for this species. Its common name comes from <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> mostly captured at night.|$|E
5|$|After much fanfare, Muhammad departs jannah airport, {{riding a}} buraq, or winged horse. The Archangel Gabriel accompanies him. On the way, they {{encounter}} a Soviet spacecraft. Hearing {{that they are}} infidels, Muhammad approaches to investigate, only to crash into the spacecraft, obliterating it and the buraq and killing the three cosmonauts; Muhammad and Gabriel are able to catch a cloud. Later, they pass Jakarta, which Gabriel describes as the most sinful place on Earth. Angered by Gabriel's statement that less than a million of Indonesia's 90 million Muslims are true believers, as well as <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> the birthplace of Nasakom, Muhammad declares that Islam will never die and waits on the cloud.|$|E

5|$|Agathias' and Zosimus' figures, if {{they have}} any {{validity}} at all, may represent the official, as opposed to actual, strength of the Constantinian army. In reality, the slim evidence is that late units were often severely under-strength, perhaps only about two-thirds of official. Thus Agathias' 600,000 on paper may have been no more than c. 400,000 in reality. The latter figure accords well with the other global figure from ancient sources, by the 6th-century writer John Lydus, of 389,704 (excluding fleets) for the army of Diocletian. Lydus' figure is accorded greater credibility than Agathias' by scholars because of its precision (implying that it was found in an official document) and <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> ascribed to a specific time period.|$|E
5|$|I am {{at first}} {{inclined}} to agree... But on re-reading the whole Ode, this line {{strikes me as}} a serious blemish on a beautiful poem, and the reason must be either that I fail to understand it, or that it is a statement which is untrue. And I suppose that Keats meant something by it, however remote his truth and his beauty may have been from these words in ordinary use. And I am sure that he would have repudiated any explanation of the line which called it a pseudo-statement... The statement of Keats seems to me meaningless: or perhaps <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> grammatically meaningless conceals another meaning from me.|$|E
5|$|In Taw Cheng Kong v. Public Prosecutor (1998), the High Court {{suggested}} on an obiter {{basis that}} voting {{is a privilege}} rather than a right. It has been suggested by law academic Thio Li-ann that, if called upon to decide the issue, the court might infer {{the existence of the}} right to vote in the Constitution from its text and structure, and from <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> an adaptation of the Westminster system of democracy. If the right to vote were to be found to be implicit in the Constitution, the judiciary would be better able to protect the right when issues arise before the courts.|$|E
