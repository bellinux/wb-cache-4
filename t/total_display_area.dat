50|$|The {{existing}} {{video board}} in the stadium was replaced. The new board is 40 feet tall and 72.5 feet wide, a <b>total</b> <b>display</b> <b>area</b> of 2,900 square ft. making the new board nine {{times larger than the}} old one. It is the largest board in Division II and would rank second among all FCS schools, it is the third largest in the state of Michigan and the 40th largest on-campus display {{board in the}} country. In addition a 18 x 8 scoreboard was added to {{the south side of the}} stadium.|$|E
50|$|The gallery has a <b>total</b> <b>display</b> <b>area</b> of 600 m2 {{and does}} not have a {{permanent}} display as it specialises in one-off solo and group exhibitions representing notable oeuvres and art movements from all periods and styles, with works by both Croatian and foreign artists. Throughout its history the gallery organised around 700 exhibitions with artists ranging from the Earth Group collective to George Grosz, Henry Moore, Auguste Rodin, Andy Warhol, Mimmo Rotella and many others. Since 2005 every year {{around the time of the}} anniversary of the Pavilion's foundation it publishes a CD-ROM with a virtual tour of exhibitions held in the past year.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{present an}} {{incremental}} tree editor based on algorithms for manipulating shape functions. The tree layout is hierarchical, left-to-right. Nodes of variable {{size and shape}} are supported. The paper presents algorithms for basic tree editing operations, including cut and paste. The layout algorithm for positioning child-subtrees rooted at a given parent is incrementally recomputed with each edit operation; it attempts to conserve the <b>total</b> <b>display</b> <b>area</b> allocated to child-subtrees while preserving the user’s mental map. The runtime and space efficiency is good {{as a result of}} exploiting a specially designed Shape abstraction for encoding and manipulating the geometric boundaries of subtrees as monotonic step functions to determine their best placement. All tree operations, including loading, saving trees to files, and incremental cut and paste, are worst case O(N) in time, but typically cut and paste are O(log(N) 2), where N is the number of nodes. ...|$|E
50|$|Dawgzilla is {{the name}} of the high {{definition}} LED video display board and sound system located behind the north end zone of Joe Aillet Stadium. The video board was designed, manufactured, and installed by Daktronics during the summer of 2009. The HD-X video display measures 25 feet high by 45 feet wide with a 16-millimeter pixel pitch. Two ribbon boards placed directly above and below the main video display each measure 4 feet high by 45 feet wide with 23-millimeter pixel pitches. The <b>total</b> video <b>display</b> <b>area</b> measures 1,485 square feet, which made Dawgzilla the largest video board in the Western Athletic Conference after its construction in 2009. Also installed atop the video display is a custom Sportsound sound system. The video board is mounted on a brick foundation constructed by Lincoln Builders and is flanked by artistic metal displays. The Dawgzilla project cost $2 million and was financed through a partnership with Learfield Sports and Community Trust Bank.|$|R
30|$|Among the tested samples, G. purdomii and G. microdonta as the {{adulterant}}s of “Long-Dan” and G. robusta as the adulterant of “Qin-Jiao”, contained all {{the seven}} common peaks, accounting {{for more than}} 90  % of the total peak area. Of them, gentiopicroside (3) with all above 60  % of the <b>total</b> peak <b>area</b> <b>displayed</b> the highest content among all the peaks. It suggested that these three species had not only close similarity of chemical compositions, but also similar chromatographic patterns to those of “Long-Dan” and “Qin-Jiao” recorded in the Chinese Pharmacopoeia, respectively. They were considerable to be used respectively as adulterants for “Long-Dan” or “Qin-Jiao”, {{on the basis of}} the HPLC–UV fingerprint analysis.|$|R

40|$|We tested whether alpine plants {{increase}} {{their effort to}} attract pollinators to compensate for assumed pollinator scarcity at high altitude. A three times larger fraction of the shoot was allocated to flowers in alpine plants (30 species, 2700 m asl) compared to lowland plants (20 species, 600 m asl), while leaf mass fraction did not differ between the altitudes. At high elevation, a three times smaller fraction of the shoot was allocated to stems, which {{was accompanied by a}} change in its function from leaf support for photosynthesis at low altitude to support for flowers at high altitude. Although shoot mass is massively reduced at high altitudes, display area and biomass of individual flowers were remarkably similar at both altitudes. All flowers together attracted pollinators with about the same <b>total</b> <b>display</b> <b>area</b> relative to overall plants size, but generally alpine plants maintain their flowers longer. Together with decreased plant height this leads to an increased self-shading which is likely to cause reductions in carbon gain in alpine plants. The results of this field survey emphasize the importance of outcrossing in alpine plants and its priority over growth...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Visualization is {{very useful}} for various {{large-scale}} computing fields. One {{of the authors}} has reported a hierarchical data visualization technique, and applied it to various large-scale computing data including large-scale Web sites, but also for data mining results, Web search queries, network intrusion detection results, and distributed processes. This paper presents the new hierarchical data visualization technique, HeiankyoView, which can be also applied to various large-scale computing fields. It places data items of input data while it packs the items {{as many as possible}} in small <b>display</b> <b>areas,</b> and aligns the items along X-axis and Y-axis of the <b>display</b> <b>area.</b> The technique represents nodes of hierarchical data as a set of rectangles, which are parallel to X-axis and Y-axis. Here the technique orthogonally divides the <b>display</b> <b>area</b> by extension lines of edges of previously placed rectangles. By referring the grid-like subspaces of the <b>display</b> <b>area,</b> the technique quickly finds the adequate positions to place remaining rectangles. 1...|$|R

40|$|Plakophilin 2 (PKP 2), a {{desmosome}} component, modulates {{the activity}} and localization of the ce:small-caps GTPase RhoA at sites of cell–cell contact. PKP 2 regulates cortical actin rearrangement during junction formation, and its loss {{is accompanied by}} an increase in actin stress fibers. We hypothesized that PKP 2 may regulate focal adhesion dynamics and cell migration. Here we show that PKP 2 -deficient cells bind efficiently to the extracellular matrix, but upon spreading <b>display</b> <b>total</b> cell <b>areas</b> ∼ 30 % ce:small-capser than control cells. Focal adhesions in PKP 2 -deficient cells are ∼ 2 × larger and more stable than in control cells, and vinculin displays an increased time for fluorescence recovery after photobleaching. Furthermore, β 4 and β 1 integrin protein and mRNA expression is elevated in PKP 2 -silenced cells. Normal focal adhesion phenotypes can be restored in PKP 2 -null cells by dampening the RhoA pathway or silencing β 1 integrin. However, integrin expression levels are not restored by RhoA signaling inhibition. These data uncover a potential role for PKP 2 upstream of β 1 integrin and RhoA in integrating cell–cell and cell–substrate contact signaling in basal keratinocytes necessary for the morphogenesis, homeostasis, and reepithelialization of the stratified epidermis...|$|R
