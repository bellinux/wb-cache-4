40|$|LC-MS-MS {{analysis}} of groundwater of a <b>tar</b> <b>oil</b> contaminated site showed {{the occurrence of}} the N-heterocycles quinoline and isoquinoline {{as well as their}} hydroxylated and hydrogenated metabolites. The concentrations of the hydroxylated compounds, 2 (1 H) -quinolinone and 1 (2 H) -isoquinolinone, were significantly higher than those of the nonsubstituted parent compounds. Therefore, exclusive quantification of the parent compounds leads to an underestimation of the amount of N-heterocycles present in the groundwater. Microbial degradation experiments of quinoline and isoquinoline with aquifer material of the site as inocculum showed the formation of hydroxylated and hydrogenated products under sulfate-reducing conditions, the prevailing conditions in the field. However, since analyses of seven tar products showed that these compounds are also primary constituents, their detection in groundwater is found to be a nonsufficient indicator for the occurrence of biological natural attenuation processes. Instead, the ratio of hydroxylated to parent compound (R-metabolite) is proposed as a useful indicator. We found that 65 - 83 % of all groundwater samples showed R-metabolite for 2 (1 H) -quinolinone, 1 (2 H) -isoquinolinone, 3, 4 -dihydro- 2 (1 H) -quinolinone, and 3, 4 -dihydro- 1 (2 H) -isoquinolinone, which was higher than the highest ratio found in tar products. With respect to the observed partition coefficient between <b>tar</b> <b>oil</b> and water of 3. 5 for quinoline and isoquinoline and 0. 3 for 2 (1 H) -quinolinone and 1 (2 H) -isoquinolinone, the ratio in groundwater would be approximately 10 times higher than the ratio in <b>tar</b> <b>oil.</b> When paying attention to these two parameters, 19 - 31 % of groundwater samples exceed the highest <b>tar</b> <b>oil</b> ratio.

40|$|Birch <b>tar</b> <b>oil</b> (BTO) is a {{by-product}} of processing birch wood in a pyrolysis system. Accumulating evidence suggests the suitability of BTO as a biocide or repellent in terrestrial environments for the control of weeds, insects, molluscs and rodents. Once applied as biocide, BTO may end up, either through run-off or leaching, in aquatic systems and may have adverse effects on non-target organisms. As very {{little is known about}} the toxicity of BTO to aquatic organisms, the present study investigated acute toxicity (LC 50 /EC 50) of BTO for eight aquatic organisms. Bioassays with the Asellus aquaticus (crustacean), Lumbriculus variegatus (oligochaeta worm), Daphnia magna (crustacean), Lymnea sp.

40|$|Renardine is a bone tar product {{available}} {{for use as a}} coyote (Canis latrans) repellent in Canada. The substance is applied to pasture borders to prevent coyotes from entering and attacking sheep. Because data regarding the effectiveness of Renardine are lacking, we designed two experiments. In the first, six pairs of coyotes were first presented with 400 g of ground meat in two pans (200 g/pan) with false screen bottoms. Beneath the screens were absorbent tubes wetted with 10 ml of distilled water. Subsequently, during a treatment period, the absorbent tube was wetted with 10 ml of Renardine. Pans were presented for 60 minutes, and the amount of time to consume the meat was recorded. In the second experiment, six additional pairs of coyotes were first presented with 200 g of ground meat inside a barrier created with baling twine and wooden dowels. The area inside the barrier was 1 m 2, and the twine was tied onto the dowels 0. 25 m above the ground. During the treatment period, the twine and dowels were painted with Renardine. In both experiments, all coyote pairs consumed all of the ground meat shortly after presentation. We conclude that Renardine probably is not an effective coyote repellent. However, because the active ingredient in Renardine is bone <b>tar</b> <b>oil</b> and bone <b>tar</b> <b>oil</b> is deer repellent, we speculate that Renardine may have utility as an herbivore repellent...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{was to assess the}} {{relevance}} of NSO-heterocycles in the groundwater of three <b>tar</b> <b>oil</b> contaminated sites and furthermore to search for indications for the presence of natural attenuation processes including the group of NSO-heterocycles. Therefore, as a first step, analytical methods were developed. In addition to an existing HPLC-DAD method for the detection of a huge number of NSO- heterocycles, an LC-MS-MS method for a selective and sensitive analysis of N- heterocycles as well as a Headspace-GC-MS method for the analysis of volatile analogs was performed. The site-directed survey allowed the long distance comparison of the concentration of various NSO-heterocycles. Differences in distribution and decrease over the field sites using mass loads were discussed in context to compounds physicochemical characteristics to work out indications for microbial natural attenuation processes of NSO-heterocycles. N-heterocycles like quinoline compounds were found in high concentrations near the source of contamination at all of the three sites. In comparison to S- and O-heterocycles a higher decrease of quinoline compounds with the flow line of groundwater was observed. Methylsubstituted S- and O-heterocycles were found of special relevance downstream the source. A comparison of these heterocycles with EPA-PAHs, especially with acenaphthene a persistent PAH, shows the necessity to consider these compounds. To cover indications of biodegradation, degradation studies using contaminated groundwater were performed. In addition, the microbial activity in an on-site column filled with aquifer material and contaminated groundwater was analysed. A high-resolution well provided an insight into the micro distance comparison of the concentration of various contaminants as well as electron acceptors such as sulfate across the fringe and centre zones and therefore a comparison of different contaminants plumes. Indications for the presence of microbial degradation in the plumes fringe could be worked out. Altogether, data of contaminants distribution from groundwater analyses, of decrease in concentration in degradation experiments and of the plumes width in the high-resolution well were critically interpreted. The decrease in concentration along the plumes together with the results from the more artificial degradation experiments and the high-resolution well led to the general conclusion that biodegradative processes towards hetero- and homocycles are present in the aquifers. Especially O- and S-heterocycles as well as their methylated analogs were found of high relevance downstream the source of contamination, and showed persistence in the degradation experiments. Secondly, the possibility to use the formation of anaerobic degradation products for the demonstration of biodegradation at the field sites was investigated. The aim was to explore whether hydroxylated quinoline and isoquinoline or methylquinoline found in high concentrations in the groundwaters can be used as indicator for natural attenuation. Therefore, the degradative potential of aquifer material towards quinoline compounds in single, and the formation of metabolites was studied. Hydroxylated and hydrogenated metabolites were formed in high amounts. However, the analyses of seven tar products showed that 2 (1 H) -quinolinone, 3, 4 -dihydro- 2 (1 H) -quinolinone, 1 (2 H) -isoquinolinone and 3, 4 -dihydro- 1 (2 H) -isoquinolinone are primary constituents. Therefore, the detection of these in groundwater was found to be a non-sufficient indicator for the occurrence of natural attenuation processes. Instead, the ratio of hydroxylated to parent compound (R-metabolite) was tested as a useful indicator. Parameters which may influence this ratio were studied: Sorption was found to influence both partners of R-metabolite in a minor extend. The main parameter influencing the ratio was found in differences in partitioning of parent and hydroxylated compound between the <b>tar</b> <b>oil</b> and water phase. With respect to the observed partition coefficient between <b>tar</b> <b>oil</b> and water of 3. 5 for quinoline and isoquinoline and 0. 3 for 2 (1 H) -quinolinone and 1 (2 H) -isoquinolinone, the ratio in groundwater would be approximately 10 times higher than the ratio in <b>tar</b> <b>oil.</b> When paying attention to these parameters and including a sufficient threshold factor, in a broad number of groundwater samples the highest ratio found in <b>tar</b> <b>oils</b> was clearly exceeded. This indicates that biological processes take place in the aquifer of the three sites and R-metabolite is an applicable indicator for the presence of natural attenuation. The R-metabolite concept was found to be feasible for the couples 2 (1 H) -quinolinone/quinoline, 3, 4 -dihydro- 2 (1 H) -quinolinone/quinoline, 1 (2 H) -isoquinolinone/isoquinoline, and also for methylsubstituted quinolines and their hydroxylated metabolites...|$|R
