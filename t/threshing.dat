5|$|The use of aisles {{enabled the}} barn's architects to {{increase}} its width and by doing so, provided the maximum space for <b>threshing</b> floors. The longer the barn was, the more <b>threshing</b> floors could be provided. English barns went through an evolution {{in the number of}} <b>threshing</b> floors; the earliest had just one central floor, a design that became the commonest to be found in Britain. Harmondsworth Great Barn is unusual in having three <b>threshing</b> floors, allowing much more grain to be threshed at one time.|$|E
5|$|In 1830 Puddletown {{was one of}} {{the places}} in Dorset where {{agricultural}} labourers took part in the Captain Swing riots of southern England, protesting against very low wages and long working hours. <b>Threshing</b> machines were damaged and ricks burned. Wages were raised from about six or seven shillings per week to ten as a result.|$|E

In the oven of the Holy Ghost you were baked into God's true bread.|$|E
500|$|The common <b>thresher</b> (Alopias vulpinus), {{also known}} by many {{names such as}} Atlantic <b>thresher,</b> big-eye <b>thresher,</b> fox shark, green <b>thresher,</b> swingletail, slasher, swiveltail, thintail <b>thresher,</b> whip-tailed shark and Zorro <b>thresher</b> shark, is the largest species of <b>thresher</b> shark, family Alopiidae, {{reaching}} some [...] in length. About half of its length consists of the elongated upper lobe of its caudal fin. With a streamlined body, short pointed snout, and modestly sized eyes, the common <b>thresher</b> resembles (and has often been confused with) the pelagic <b>thresher</b> (A. pelagicus). It can be distinguished from the latter species by the white of its belly extending in a band over the bases of its pectoral fins. The common <b>thresher</b> is distributed worldwide in tropical and temperate waters, though it prefers cooler temperatures. It can be found both close to shore and in the open ocean, from the surface {{to a depth of}} [...] It is seasonally migratory and spends summers at lower latitudes.|$|R
40|$|<b>Thresher</b> {{sharks are}} {{distributed}} circumglobally in the Atlantic, Pacific, Mediterranean and Indian Oceans. <b>Thresher</b> sharks include the common <b>thresher</b> (Alopias vulpinus), bigeye <b>thresher</b> (A. superciliosus), and pelagic <b>thresher</b> (A. pelagicus), the former being the largest. Unusual landings of this shark by long liners were noticed along the Malabar coast in 2005. The details of its fishery and some observations {{made on the}} biology are presented...|$|R
50|$|The pelagic <b>thresher</b> (Alopias pelagicus) is {{a species}} of <b>thresher</b> shark, family Alopiidae; this group of sharks is {{characterized}} by the greatly elongated upper lobes of their caudal fins. The pelagic <b>thresher</b> occurs in the tropical and subtropical waters of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, usually far from shore but occasionally entering coastal habitats. It is often confused with the common <b>thresher</b> (A. vulpinus), even in professional publications, but can be distinguished by the dark, rather than white, color over the bases of its pectoral fins. The smallest of the three <b>thresher</b> species, the pelagic <b>thresher</b> typically measures 3 m (10 ft) long.|$|R
5|$|Although {{this bird}} eats rice on the {{wintering}} grounds, {{where it can}} make up nearly 40% of its diet, it takes mainly waste and residues from cropping and <b>threshing,</b> not harvestable grain. It has sometimes been viewed as a pest, but the deeper water and presence of invertebrate prey in the economically important early winter period means that the wader has little effect on crop yield.|$|E
5|$|Early {{improvement}} {{was carried out}} with the traditional tools, but new technology was increasingly important. Lighter ploughs were adopted, including from 1763 James Small's cast iron and curved mould board. It was first adopted in the south-east and spread to {{rest of the country}} in the 1770s. From 1788 Andrew Meikle's automated <b>threshing</b> mill speeded up {{a vital part of the}} harvesting process. There was increasing regional specialisation. The Lothians became a major centre of grain, Ayrshire of cattle breading and the Borders of sheep.|$|E
5|$|Beside the weapons, each zduhać {{carried a}} milk bucket and a peck measure; an {{alternative}} {{for the latter}} could be a shovel or broom from a <b>threshing</b> floor. If a band of zduhaći succeeded to seize the peck measures from the enemy band, they would thereby transfer the crop yield from the area of their enemies to their own area. Seizing the milk buckets meant that the milk yield would be transferred. According to the clan of Kuči, zduhaći used their peck measures, milk buckets, and other containers to grab off the overall yield of the enemy territory.|$|E
50|$|The firm traded as Newham and Binham in 1768; by 1777 it {{was known}} as Newham and <b>Thresher</b> of 152 the Strand. By 1784, the {{business}} {{was taken over by}} Richard <b>Thresher,</b> and became official hosier to George III in 1790. Richard <b>Thresher</b> remained a partner until 1805 when George <b>Thresher</b> replaced him, and in 1817 the company was taken over by John <b>Thresher.</b> John <b>Thresher</b> traded as a hosier, mercer and masquerade maker in Panton Street, Haymarket between 1822 and 1835, and in 1827 described himself as “hosier, glover and flannel draper to His Majesty”.|$|R
5000|$|Mike <b>Thresher</b> {{was one of}} six footballing {{brothers}} who all played locally for Chard Town in Somerset; Mike also represented the RAF. Pat Beasley signed <b>Thresher</b> in January 1954 from Chard Town for Bristol City. Mike <b>Thresher</b> made his debut at left back in the Third Division South in a 2-0 win at Reading on 27 December 1954. <b>Thresher</b> retained the left back {{for the rest of}} the season 1954-55 ahead of Jack Bailey and Norman Jackson. The season ended with Bristol City winning promotion as champions. <b>Thresher</b> continued his full back partnership with Ivor Guy in the Second Division in 1955-56 making 35 appearances. In 1956-57 Mike <b>Thresher</b> was a regular again making 37 appearances at left back alongside both Jack Bailey and Ivor Guy. As the [...] "Robins" [...] slipped down the Second Division table finishing in 17th place <b>Thresher</b> made 41 appearances in 1957-58. <b>Thresher</b> partnered new signing Gordon Hopkinson from Doncaster Rovers in the 1958-59 season as City rose to 10th place. <b>Thresher</b> made 41 appearances and starred in the two 4th round FA Cup ties v Blackpool when opposed by an ageing Stanley Matthews. City lost 0-1 in the replaty at Blackpool. <b>Thresher</b> had another new right back partner in Roger Collinson in 1959-60. <b>Thresher</b> made 40 appearances in the relegation season as Bristol City finished bottom of the Second Division. Back in the Third Division in 1960-61 <b>Thresher</b> made 41 appearances and played in all five FA Cup ties as Bristol City reached the 4th round before a 1-5 defeat at Leicester City. <b>Thresher</b> aestablished a new partnership for the next three seasons with Alec Briggs playing at right back. <b>Thresher</b> made 41 appearances as Bristol City finished 6th in 1961-62. <b>THresher</b> made a further 41 appearances in 1962-63. The following season 1963-64 saw <b>Thresher</b> make 39 appearances and score his only League goal in a 1-1 draw at Southend United on 30 November 1963 as Bristol City finished 5th in the Third Division. City again reached the 4th round of the FA Cup this time losing 1-6 at Sunderland with <b>Thresher</b> playing in all five ties. When Bristol City finished runners up and won promotion to the Second Division in 1964-65 <b>Thresher</b> made only 7 appearances losing his place at left back to Alec Briggs as local boy Tony Ford was ever present at right back. Mike <b>Thresher</b> moved to Bath City on a free transfer in July 1965. Subsequently, he rejoined Chard Town.|$|R
5|$|Morphological and {{allozyme}} analyses {{have agreed}} that the common <b>thresher</b> is basal to the clade formed by the bigeye <b>thresher</b> and the pelagic <b>thresher</b> (A. pelagicus). The closest relative of this species within the family may be a fourth, unrecognized <b>thresher</b> shark species off Baja California, reported from allozyme evidence by Blaise Eitner in 1995. However, {{the existence of this}} fourth species has yet to be confirmed by other sources.|$|R
5|$|Nearly all beer {{includes}} {{barley malt}} {{as the majority}} of the starch. This is because its fibrous hull remains attached to the grain during <b>threshing.</b> After malting, barley is milled, which finally removes the hull, breaking it into large pieces. These pieces remain with the grain during the mash, and act as a filter bed during lautering, when sweet wort is separated from insoluble grain material. Other malted and unmalted grains (including wheat, rice, oats, and rye, and less frequently, corn and sorghum) may be used. Some brewers have produced gluten-free beer, made with sorghum with no barley malt, for those who cannot consume gluten-containing grains like wheat, barley, and rye.|$|E
5|$|The London and South Western Railway {{arrived in}} 1839 from London, {{and within a}} year it was {{extended}} to Winchester and Southampton. In 1848 a rival company, sponsored by the Great Western Railway built a branch from Reading. In 1854 a line was built to Salisbury by the London and South Western. In the 19th century Basingstoke began to move into industrial manufacture, Wallis and Haslam (later Wallis & Steevens), began producing agricultural equipment including <b>threshing</b> machines in the 1850s, moving into the production of stationary steam engines in the 1860s and then traction engines in the 1870s.|$|E
5|$|The {{waterwheel}} {{appeared in}} Chinese records during the Han. As mentioned by Huan Tan in about 20 AD, {{they were used}} to turn gears that lifted iron trip hammers, and were used in pounding, <b>threshing</b> and polishing grain. However, there is no sufficient evidence for the watermill in China until about the 5th century. The Nanyang Commandery Administrator and mechanical engineer Du Shi (d.38 AD) created a waterwheel-powered reciprocator that worked the bellows for the smelting of iron. Waterwheels were also used to power chain pumps that lifted water to raised irrigation ditches. The chain pump was first mentioned in China by the philosopher Wang Chong in his 1st-century-AD Balanced Discourse.|$|E
50|$|The third ship started {{firing on}} <b>Thresher</b> with deck guns, passing down {{the port side}} at 800 yd. With the {{submarine}} now readily visible, and her stern tubes dry, <b>Thresher</b> dove as bullets from the approaching escort splashed nearby. <b>Thresher</b> counted some 20 explosions from depth charges before the patrol craft left an hour later. Upon surfacing, <b>Thresher</b> was again alone and set off to patrol along the Singapore-to-Japan trade route.|$|R

5|$|From {{the very}} {{beginning}} of their history, Andalusians have been used for both riding and driving. Among the first horses used for classical dressage, they are still making a mark in international competition in dressage today. At the 2002 World Equestrian Games, two Andalusians were on the bronze-medal winning Spanish dressage team, a team that went on to take the silver medal at the 2004 Summer Olympics. Today, the breed is increasingly being selectively bred for increased aptitude in classical dressage. Historically, however, they were also used as stock horses, especially suited to working with Iberian bulls, known for their aggressive temperaments. They were, and still are, known for their use in mounted bull fighting. Mares were traditionally used for la trilla, the Spanish process of <b>threshing</b> grain practiced until the 1960s. Mares, some pregnant or with foals at their side, spent full days trotting over the grain. As well as being a traditional farming practice, it also served as a test of endurance, hardiness and willingness for the maternal Andalusian lines.|$|E
5|$|John Struthers {{was the son}} of Dr Alexander Struthers (1767–1853) and {{his wife}} Mary Reid (1793–1859). They lived in Brucefield, a large stone-built 18th century house with spacious grounds, which was then just outside Dunfermline; John was born in the house. Alexander was a wealthy mill owner and linen merchant. He bought Brucefield early in the 19th century, along with Brucefield Mill, a linen {{spinning}} mill built in 1792. Linen was threshed at the nearby <b>threshing</b> mill, and bleached in the open air near the house. There were still linen bleachers living in Brucefield House in 1841, but they had gone by 1851, leaving the house as the seat of the Struthers family. Mary's father, Deacon John Reid, was also a linen maker. Alexander and Mary were married in 1818; the marriage, though not warmly affectionate, lasted until Alexander's death despite the large age difference. Both Alexander and Mary are buried at Dunfermline Abbey.|$|E
5|$|Tillmore Brook joins {{from the}} west, {{and the course}} turns to the east. At Durleighmarsh, a hamlet which forms part of the civil parish of Rogate, it passes the ruins of Durford Abbey, a Premonstratensian monastery {{situated}} on the north bank. It is a scheduled ancient monument, and the site includes a <b>threshing</b> barn with a water wheel and associated drive shafts. On the south bank is Durford Mill. This mill house is a grade II listed structure, and was built of clunch in 1770. The mill itself has been modernised and enlarged, and is not listed. A little further downstream, Harting Road crosses the river at Durford Bridge, build in the early 1600s with four semi-circular arches. It was restored in 1924. To the north of Habin, another hamlet in Rogate, North Lane crosses the river on Habin Bridge, which has four round-headed arches, and was probably built in the seventeenth century, but might be earlier. It is built of stone, and was restored in the eighteenth century.|$|E

50|$|Anatomical {{examination}} {{indicates that}} the pelagic <b>thresher</b> {{is unlikely to be}} warm-bodied like the common <b>thresher.</b> The pelagic <b>thresher</b> lacks a rete mirabile, a blood vessel countercurrent exchange system that prevents metabolic heat from being dissipated into the water, inside its trunk. Furthermore, its aerobic red muscles, responsible for generating heat in the common <b>thresher,</b> are positioned in two lateral strips just beneath the skin rather than {{at the core of the}} body. A rete system is present around the pelagic thresher's brain and eyes, albeit less developed than in the bigeye <b>thresher,</b> which may serve to buffer those organs against temperature changes.|$|R
50|$|Advantages of the <b>thresher</b> include less {{physical}} labour {{and more}} efficiency (amount of grain <b>thresher</b> per amount of time). Less seed breakage {{is also a}} benefit of using a <b>thresher</b> as opposed to stomping or beating grains. However, more breakage can occur it is not used properly.|$|R
25|$|<b>Threshing</b> machines, {{which were}} a novelty {{at the end}} of the 18th century, began being widely {{introduced}} in the 1830s and 1840s. Mechanized <b>threshing</b> required less than half the labor of hand <b>threshing.</b>|$|E
25|$|After <b>threshing,</b> a mixed {{collection}} of waste matter remained on the <b>threshing</b> floor together with the grain kernels. Included in this combination would be small pebbles and similar debris.|$|E
25|$|Historical harvest methods {{involved}} cutting with a scythe or sickle, and <b>threshing</b> {{under the}} feet of cattle. Late 19th- and early 20th-century harvesting was performed using a binder. Oats were gathered into shocks, and then collected and run through a stationary <b>threshing</b> machine.|$|E
50|$|The {{size and}} weight of the <b>thresher</b> can be problematic. The <b>thresher</b> {{may need to be}} carried, and {{therefore}} must be light enough for one person. The suggested weight is 35 kg. On hillside farms {{it may be difficult to}} transport the <b>thresher</b> or to set it up properly.|$|R
5000|$|An {{allozyme}} analysis {{conducted by}} Blaise Eitner in 1995 {{showed that the}} closest relative of the pelagic <b>thresher</b> is the bigeye <b>thresher</b> (A. superciliosus), with which it forms a clade.

25|$|The {{north and}} west ranges were built in 1782-4 by John Reid. The north range stands on the {{foundations}} of an earlier building, probably a 17th-century longhouse. The small byre was re-roofed and upgraded in the mid 19th and early 20th centuries. The corn barn still has its <b>threshing</b> floor where a flail would {{have been used by}} hand until a horse-engine and <b>threshing</b> machine was installed in around 1820 to 1840. This was in turn replaced in 1860 by the present <b>threshing</b> mill. Finally around 1870 travelling mills made even this mill redundant.|$|E
25|$|Sumerians {{harvested}} {{during the}} spring in three-person teams consisting of a reaper, a binder, and a sheaf handler. The farmers would use <b>threshing</b> wagons, driven by oxen, to separate the cereal heads from the stalks and then use <b>threshing</b> sleds to disengage the grain. They then winnowed the grain/chaff mixture.|$|E
