40|$|Objective: China {{introduced}} {{a series of}} health reforms in 2009, including a national essential medicines policy and a medical insurance system for primary care institutions. This study aimed to determine the changing prescribing patterns associated with those reforms in <b>township</b> <b>hospitals.</b> Methods: A multi-stage stratified random cluster sampling method was adopted to identify 29 <b>township</b> <b>hospitals</b> from six counties in three provinces. A total of 2899 prescriptions were collected from the participating <b>township</b> <b>hospitals</b> using a systematic random sampling strategy. Seven prescribing indicators were calculated and compared between 2008 and 2013, assessing use of medicines (antibiotics and adrenal corticosteroids) and polypharmacy, administration route of medicines (injections), and affordability of medicines. Results: Significant changes in prescribing patterns were found. The average number of medicines and costs per-prescription dropped by about 50 %. The percentage of prescriptions requiring antibiotics declined from 54 % to 38 %. The percentage of prescriptions requiring adrenal corticosteroid declined from 14 % to 4 %.

Objective: This study aims to assess the condition of antibiotic use at health facilities at county, township and village levels in rural Guangxi, China. Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional study of outpatient antibiotic prescriptions in 2014 for children aged 2 – 14 years with upper respiratory infections (URI). Twenty health facilities were randomly selected, including four county <b>hospitals,</b> eight <b>township</b> <b>hospitals</b> and eight village clinics. Prescriptions were extracted from the electronic records in the county hospitals and paper copies in the <b>township</b> <b>hospitals</b> and village clinics. Results: The antibiotic prescription rate was higher in <b>township</b> <b>hospitals</b> (593 / 877, 68 %) compared to county hospitals (2736 / 8166, 34 %) and village clinics (96 / 297, 32 %) (p < 0. 001). Among prescriptions containing antibiotics, county hospitals were found to have the highest use rate of broad-spectrum antibiotics (82 vs 57 % [township], vs 54 % [village], p < 0. 001), injectable antibiotics (65 vs 43 % [township], vs 33 % [village], p < 0. 001) and multiple antibiotics (47 vs 15 % [township], vs 0 % [village], p < 0. 001). Logistic regression showed that the likelihood of prescribing an antibiotic was significantly associated with patients being 6 – 14 years old compared with being 2 – 5 years old (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1. 3, 95 % CI 1. 2 – 1. 5), and receiving care at <b>township</b> <b>hospitals</b> compared with county hospitals (aOR = 5. 0, 95 % CI 4. 1 – 6. 0).

A total of 106 of the 840 (12. 6 %) respondents reported being physically attacked in their workplace in the previous 12 months. Most perpetrators were the patients' relatives (62. 3 %), followed by the patient (22. 6 %); 73. 6 % of perpetrators were aged between 20 and 40 years. Of the physical violence incidents, about 56. 6 % (n = 60) resulted in a physical injury, and 45. 4 % of respondents took two or three days of sick leave. Reporting workplace violence in hospitals to superiors or authorities was low (9. 4 %). Most respondents (62. 8 %) did not receive training on how to avoid workplace violence. Logistic regression analyses indicated that general nurses, aged 35 years or younger, and with a higher-level professional title were more likely to experience physical violence. Healthcare workers with direct physical contact (washing, turning, lifting) with patients had a higher risk of physical violence compared to other health care workers. Procedures for reporting workplace violence were a protective factor for physical violence; when in place, reporting after psychological violence (verbal abuse, bullying/mobbing, harassment, and threats) was more protective than waiting until an instance of physical violence (beating, kicking, slapping, stabbing, etc.).

Limited information is available {{about the relationship between}} different levels of health services and CD knowledge among rural residents with CDs. This research explores the distribution characteristics of CD knowledge and its determinants among chronically ill adults in rural China according to the aspects of patients and health service providers. Methods A cross-sectional study was undertaken to estimate distribution characteristics of CD knowledge and collect data of socio-demographic characteristics, healthcare institutions attendances, duration of illness, and family history of CDs. Participants were 1060 rural adults with hypertension or type II diabetes. Correct responses to 12 questions were summed into a total knowledge score, and participants were divided into an adequate health knowledge group (score ≥ 6) or an inadequate health knowledge group (score Results The mean age of participants was 61. 34 years (SD = 10 years). Out of a possible 12, the median score on the CD knowledge questionnaire was 3. 0. About 25 % of participants were classified as having adequate CD knowledge. Those who had a family history and/or long duration of CDs {{were more likely to have}} adequate health knowledge. Participants who received CD health information and self-care instructions from their physicians had 2. 67 and 13. 34 times greater odds of possessing adequate health knowledge than those who received no information, respectively. Adequate CD knowledge was strongly associated with regular check-ups, especially for those who attended <b>township</b> <b>hospitals</b> (OR = 40. 17). Conclusions Having regular check-ups at a fixed healthcare institution and receiving health information from physicians are important measures for increasing CD knowledge among rural adults with CDs. <b>Township</b> <b>hospitals</b> are the most effective settings for health education. It is important to develop an effective community-based prevention and control mechanism for CDs.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In China, {{cardiovascular}} disease (CVD) risk reduction strategies are not systematically implemented in primary healthcare (PHC). We conducted an exploratory study {{to evaluate the}} preliminary effectiveness of our systematic CVD risk reduction package in one <b>township</b> <b>hospital</b> of Zhejiang. METHODS: Using the Asian Equation, we selected subjects aged 40 - 74 years with a calculated 10 -year CVD risk of 20 % or higher from the existing resident health records and research checkup. The subjects were provided, as appropriate, with the low-dose combination of CVD-preventive drugs (antihypertensive drugs, aspirin, statin), lifestyle modification and adherence strategies monthly. The intervention was piloted for three months in 2012, preceding the conduct of a cluster-based randomized controlled trial (RCT). RESULTS: A total of 153 (40 %) subjects were recruited, with an average total 10 -year risk of CVD of 28. 5 ± 7. 9 %. After intervention, the appointment rate was up to 90 %. An upward trend was observed {{for the use of}} CVD-preventive drugs. The smoking rates significantly reduced from 38 to 35 %, with almost no change for salt reduction. The systolic blood pressure (BP) and diastolic BP decreased slightly. CONCLUSION: A holistic CVD risk reduction approach shows preliminary effects in a rural PHC setting of Zhejiang, China. However, further understanding is needed regarding its long-term effectiveness and feasibility in PHC practices. Our cluster-based RCT will provide the highest level of evidence for the policy development of preventing CVD in a rural PHC of China...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background In 2004, the Ministry of Health {{issued the}} policy of decentralising {{microscopy}} services (MCs) to one third of all <b>township</b> <b>hospitals</b> in China. The {{study was conducted in}} Gansu Province, a poor western one in China. Ganzhou was one county in Gansu Province. Ganzhou County was identified as a unique case of further decentralisation of tuberculosis (TB) treatment services in <b>township</b> <b>hospitals.</b> The study evaluated the impact of the MC policy on providers and patients in Gansu Province. The second objective was to assess the unique case of Ganzhou County compared with other counties in the province. Methods Both quantitative and qualitative methods were used. All 523 MCs in the province completed an institutional survey regarding their performance. Four counties were selected for in-depth investigation, where 169 TB suspects were randomly selected from the MC and county TB dispensary registers for questionnaire surveys. Informant interviews were conducted with 38 health staff at the township and county levels in the four counties. Results Gansu established MCs in 39 % of its <b>township</b> <b>hospitals.</b> From January 2006 to June 2007, 8 % of MCs identified more than 10 TB sputum smear positive patients while 54 % did not find any. MCs identified 1546 TB sputum smear positive patients, accounting for 9 % of the total in the province. The throughputs of MCs in Ganzhou County were eight times of those in other counties. Interviews identified several barriers to implement the MC policy, such as inadequate health financing, low laboratory capacity, lack of human resources, poor treatment and management capacities, and lack of supervisions from county TB dispensaries. Conclusion Microscopy centre throughputs were generally low in Gansu Province, and the contribution of MCs to TB case detection was insignificant taking account the number of MCs established. As a unique case of full decentralisation of TB service, Ganzhou County presented better results. However, standards and quality of TB care needed to be improved. The MC policy needs to be reviewed in light of evidence from this study. </p...|$|R
30|$|The {{second phase}} was {{nutrition}} education and parental education at Mommy Schools in <b>township</b> <b>hospitals</b> or village clinics, giving training classes and holding participatory activities at mommy schools in towns or villages {{once or twice}} a month. Research teams, local doctors, teachers and relevant officers developed a set of training materials for quality control and further development. In order to encourage active engagement, cash allowances were provided to pregnant women attending mommy schools and infant families participating physical exams to alleviate poverty through nutritional intervention.|$|R
40|$|Summary. This paper {{compares the}} {{knowledge}} and utilization of health services among rural residents, urban residents, rural migrants and urban migrants in a large Chinese city. Data were obtained from a questionnaire survey of 2765 individuals (1951 heads of households and 814 spouses) in Guandu district, Kunming, in 2005. The determinants of their knowledge and utilization of health services were analysed using multivariate logistic regression. First, the migrant population was less likely to know of, or utilize, high-level <b>hospitals</b> and <b>township</b> <b>hospitals</b> than residents. Migrants {{were more likely to}} utilize private rather than public services for general health care and delivery care. Second, there was a difference between rural migrants and urban migrants in terms of knowledge and utilization of health services. Rural migrants utilized more low-cost private clinics, but had less knowledge about sources of condoms than urban migrants. Finally, rural residents had more knowledge and utilization of <b>township</b> <b>hospitals</b> than urban residents. This latter group were more likely to utilize high-level hospitals. Migrants’ access to health care in urban China is understood better using a dual rural–urban and migrant–resident analytical framework. Rural migrants are the most disadvantaged in their access to urban health care. Further reform of the registered residence system and urban public financing system is recommended. Better information on services and their utilization should be provided to migrants and residents...|$|R
