2500|$|David Hockney {{perceives}} {{music as}} color, shape, and configuration and uses these perceptions when painting opera stage sets (though not while creating his other artworks). Kandinsky combined four senses: color, hearing, touch, and smell. Nabokov described his grapheme-color synesthesia at length in his autobiography, Speak, Memory, and portrayed {{it in some}} of his characters. In addition to Messiaen, whose three types of complex colors are rendered explicitly in musical chord structures that he invented, other composers who reported synesthesia include Duke Ellington, Rimsky-Korsakov, and Jean Sibelius. Michael <b>Torke</b> is a contemporary example of a synesthetic composer. Physicist Richard Feynman describes his colored equations in his autobiography, What Do You Care What Other People Think? ...|$|E
5000|$|... "In {{nearly all}} of <b>Torke's</b> music there's an {{implicit}} tension between a kind of free-form spontaneity and the tight structural control that he likes to impose on his material. An early work, the jazz-inspired Vanada (1984) bustles with a restless urban energy but, like fast-moving people in a modern city, each element knows precisely where it is heading. It's one of <b>Torke's</b> harshest scores, close in spirit to the aggressive European minimalism of Louis Andriessen" [...] - Staines, p. 588. While written in the key of B Major/G Minor, the piece is based around an eight-note chord with a non-key bass note of D natural. While the keyboards produce the chord all at once, the other instruments have it as a center for their phrasings.|$|R

5000|$|English {{examples}} of using proverbs in music include Elvis Presley's Easy come, easy go, Harold Robe's Never swap horses when you're crossing a stream, Arthur Gillespie's Absence makes the heart grow fonder, Bob Dylan's Like a rolling stone, Cher's Apples don't fall {{far from the}} tree. Lynn Anderson made famous a song full of proverbs, I never promised you a rose garden (written by Joe South). In choral music, we find Michael <b>Torke's</b> Proverbs for female voice and ensemble. A number of Blues musicians have also used proverbs extensively. The frequent use of proverbs in Country music has led to published studies of proverbs in this genre. The Reggae artist Jahdan Blakkamoore has recorded a piece titled Proverbs Remix. The opera Maldobrìe contains careful use of proverbs. An extreme example of many proverbs used in composing songs is a song consisting almost entirely of proverbs performed by Bruce Springsteen, [...] "My best was never good enough". The Mighty Diamonds recorded a song called simply [...] "Proverbs".|$|R

In 2001 she portrayed the roles of Pamina in The Magic Flute and Amy in Mark Adamo's Little Women at the HGO. The latter performance was recorded live for broadcast on PBS's Great Performances and subsequently released on CD and DVD. That same year she performed the role of Josephine in H.M.S. Pinafore with Santa Fe Opera and sang the world premiere of Michael <b>Torke's</b> Four Proverbs as Alice Tully Hall, later singing the premiere of the chamber orchestra version of that work with the American Composers Orchestra at Zankel Hall in 2005. In 2002 she portrayed the role of Sophie in Richard Strauss's Der Rosenkavalier with Opera Carolina and Cunegonde in Candide with Portland Opera.|$|R
5000|$|Even {{though it}} {{consists}} of 591 measures, the playful, fast tempo resembles the swiftness of javelins.

500|$|The Burnham Plan is {{credited}} with guiding {{the transformation of the}} city from an industrial center to leading contemporary city. [...] The Wall Street Journal describes the plan as unrivaled in its elegance and ambition for urban planning and describes Chicago as a monumental manifestation of the plan.

[...] The concert featured the world premiere of Michael <b>Torke's</b> symphony and chorus work entitled Plans, that was paired with Rachmaninoff's Piano Concerto No. 3. The ongoing celebration includes lectures, walking tours and art exhibitions throughout the calendar year. [...] The pavilions are accompanied by exhibit panels that promote the Burnham Plan Centennial celebration and continuing opportunities to pursue the plan's vision for Metropolitan Chicago. [...] The pavilions serve as a focal point for the public’s attention to steer them toward the hundreds of exhibits, events, and other activities of the more than 250 Centennial Program Partners in the Chicago metropolitan area. The ground near the pavilions host an interactive touch-screen public kiosk installation geared toward [...] "inventing the future" [...] of the metropolitan Chicago region.|$|R

5000|$|In this disposition, <b>Torke</b> {{associates}} E major, {{which is}} the invariable key of this composition, to the green color. The melody is a simple consecution of the notes F#-A-D#-E-B.

5000|$|<b>Torke</b> was {{influenced}} by Milton Babbitt's time-point system in his composition of Vanada, but added four extra notes to create a piece with a [...] time signature, rather than using [...] or [...] time which is normal for Babbitt's system. <b>Torke</b> was also influenced by pop musician Madonna's 1983 self-titled album, including the song [...] "Physical Attraction".
