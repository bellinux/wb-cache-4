5|$|The {{common toad}} was first given the name Rana bufo by the Swedish {{biologist}} Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae in 1758. In this work, he placed all the {{frogs and toads}} in the single genus Rana. It later became apparent that this genus should be divided, and in 1768, the Austrian naturalist Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti placed the common toad in the genus Bufo, naming it Bufo bufo. The toads in this genus {{are included in the}} family Bufonidae, the <b>true</b> <b>toads.</b>|$|E
500|$|Frogs {{range in}} size from the {{recently}} discovered [...] Paedophryne amauensis of Papua New Guinea to the [...] goliath frog (Conraua goliath) of Cameroon. The skin hangs loosely on the body {{because of the lack of}} loose connective tissue. Frogs have three eyelid membranes: one is transparent to protect the eyes underwater, and two vary from translucent to opaque. They have a tympanum on each side of their heads which is involved in hearing and, in some species, is covered by skin. <b>True</b> <b>toads</b> completely lack teeth, but most frogs have them, specifically pedicellate teeth in which the crown is separated from the root by fibrous tissue. These are on the edge of the upper jaw and vomerine teeth are also on the roof of their mouths. No teeth are in the lower jaw and frogs usually swallow their food whole. The teeth are mainly used to grip the prey and keep it in place till swallowed, a process assisted by retracting the eyes into the head. The African bullfrog (Pyxicephalus), which preys on relatively large animals such as mice and other frogs, has cone shaped bony projections called odontoid processes at the front of the lower jaw which function like teeth.|$|E
