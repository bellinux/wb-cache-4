5|$|On December 5, 1989, Judge Roth found Taylor {{guilty of}} the first-degree child rape and first-degree murder of Charla Nicole King. During the penalty phase of Taylor's trial, his {{half-sister}} Leslie Beale traveled from Florida to testify about his harsh <b>treatment</b> <b>under</b> his stepfather and the three years that Taylor spent in a sex offender program at a Florida mental institution. On December 19, Taylor became the first convict in 40 years {{to be sent to}} death row by a Weber County court. Roth said that {{the facts of the case}} outweighed any mitigating circumstances. Taylor's father Albert attended most of his son's court proceedings until he died of heart failure on October 8, 1990. Taylor said he was not permitted to attend his father's funeral.|$|E
5|$|The {{massacre}} and Gandhi's non-violent {{response to}} it moved many, but also made some Sikhs and Hindus upset that Dyer was getting away with murder. Investigation committees were formed by the British, which Gandhi asked Indians to boycott. The unfolding events, the massacre and the British response, led Gandhi {{to the belief that}} Indians will never get a fair equal <b>treatment</b> <b>under</b> British rulers, and he shifted his attention to Swaraj or self rule and political independence for India. In 1921, Gandhi was the leader of the Indian National Congress. He reorganised the Congress. With Congress now behind him, and Muslim support triggered by his backing the Khilafat movement to restore the Caliph in Turkey, Gandhi had the political support and the attention of the British Raj.|$|E

25|$|After 1890, a {{coalition}} of White Democratic politicians passed laws to segregate and disenfranchise African American residents, a process completed in provisions of the 1901 constitution. Provisions which disenfranchised African Americans resulted in excluding many poor Whites. By 1941 more Whites than African Americans had been disenfranchised: 600,000 to 520,000. The total effects were greater on the African-American community, as almost all of its citizens were disfranchised and relegated to separate and unequal <b>treatment</b> <b>under</b> the law.|$|E

25|$|Private {{and public}} trusts: A private trust has {{one or more}} {{particular}} individuals as its beneficiary. By contrast, a public trust (also called a charitable trust) has some charitable end as its beneficiary. In order to qualify as a charitable trust, the trust must have as its object certain purposes such as alleviating poverty, providing education, carrying out some religious purpose, etc. The permissible objects are generally set out in legislation, but objects not explicitly set out may also be an object of a charitable trust, by analogy. Charitable trusts are entitled to special <b>treatment</b> <b>under</b> the law of trusts and also the law of taxation.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} statistical tests for inter-subject and total variabilities between <b>treatments</b> <b>under</b> crossover designs. Since estimators of variance components for inter-subject variability and total variability in crossover design are not independent, the usual F-test cannot be applied. Alternatively, we propose a test {{based on the}} concept of the extension of the modified large sample method to compare inter-subject variability and total variability between <b>treatments</b> <b>under</b> a 2 £ 2 m replicated crossover design. An asymptotic power of the proposed test is derived. A sensitivity analysis is performed based on the asymptotic power to determine how the power changes with respect to various parameters such as inter-subject correlation and intra-class correlation. Also the two methods for sample size calculation for testing total variability under 2 £ 4 crossover design are discussed. The method based on the Fisher–Cornish inversion shows better performance than the method based on the normal approximation. Several simulation studies were conducted to investigate the finite sample performance of the proposed test. Our simulation results show that the proposed test can control type I error satisfactorily...|$|R
25|$|In 1969 the Shafdan {{wastewater}} treatment plant south of Tel Aviv was completed to treat approximately 130 million cubic meters of wastewater per year for reuse in agriculture. However, wastewater from other cities and towns remained largely untreated. In 1970 there was a cholera outbreak because of illegal irrigation of salad with untreated wastewater. This gave rise to major investments in wastewater <b>treatment</b> <b>under</b> the National Sewerage Plan, which emphasized the reuse of treated wastewater. In 1984 the Kishon {{wastewater treatment}} plant was completed in Northern Israel. It provides 20 million cubic meters of treated wastewater per year for agricultural use in the fertile Jezreel Valley, maximizing distribution potential during high-demand periods.|$|E
25|$|Amendments to the Constitution {{subsequent}} to the Bill of Rights cover {{a wide range of}} subjects. Several have added significant content to the original document. One of the most far-reaching is the Fourteenth, ratified in 1868, which establishes a clear and simple definition of citizenship and guarantees equal <b>treatment</b> <b>under</b> the law. Also significant are the Fifteenth, Nineteenth, Twenty-fourth, and Twenty-sixth, which were enacted to extend the right to vote to persons previously considered ineligible and also to protect their exercise of that right. One Amendment, the Eighteenth, which criminalized the production, transport and sale of alcohol nationwide, was later repealed by another, the Twenty-first. Nine ratified amendments (11, 12, 13, 14, 16, 17, 20, 22, and 25) have explicitly superseded or modified the text of the original Constitution.|$|E
25|$|In 2005 Tafari was {{diagnosed}} with hepatitis C. As he was poor he had no US health insurance, and was therefore unable to have his condition treated. He was also however, a UK citizen. He resigned his position as CEO of Dignity Village and returned to London to receive medical <b>treatment</b> <b>under</b> the English National Health Service (NHS). Homeless at first, he took advantage of English squatting laws to secure temporary housing for himself and sometimes others. These laws, which originated in the middle ages, allowed for unoccupied buildings to be taken over as temporary housing by those in need. During this period Tafari honed his squatting skills in three areas: the ‘scouting’ of suitable squats; ‘cracking’ squats (gaining entry); and ‘legally filing’ (registering) squats, such that property owners {{would have to go}} to court to secure evictions by means of interim possession orders.|$|E
