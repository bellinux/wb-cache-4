In 2002, with a rhythm guitarist, they issued the Top50 album I'm Already Home. With four members, the band then toured Australia and New Zealand. Shortly thereafter, Brendan Picchio joined Waikiki as a bassist, and Juanita switched to rhythm guitar. The group soon became dissatisfied with its material, so the members chose a new direction for their music. They wrote {{a number of new}} songs and made a wish list of producers with whom they would like to work. In 2004, the band changed its name to Howling Bells, as its members felt <b>that</b> <b>phrase</b> better embodied its newly adapted indie rock style.|$|E

60|$|There is an insistent {{atmosphere}} of candor and fairness {{about this book}} which is engaging at first, then a little burdensome, then a trifle fatiguing, then progressively suspicious, annoying, irritating, and oppressive. It takes one some little {{time to find out}} <b>that</b> <b>phrases</b> which seem intended to guide the reader aright are there to mislead him; <b>that</b> <b>phrases</b> which seem intended to throw light are there to throw darkness; <b>that</b> <b>phrases</b> which seem intended to interpret a fact are there to misinterpret it; <b>that</b> <b>phrases</b> which seem intended to forestall prejudice are there to create it; <b>that</b> <b>phrases</b> which seem antidotes are poisons in disguise. The naked facts arrayed in the book establish Shelley's guilt in that one episode which disfigures his otherwise superlatively lofty and beautiful life; but the historian's careful and methodical misinterpretation of them transfers the responsibility to the wife's shoulders as he persuades himself. The few meagre facts of Harriet Shelley's life, as furnished by the book, acquit her of offense; but by calling in the forbidden helps of rumor, gossip, conjecture, insinuation, and innuendo he destroys her character and rehabilitates Shelley's--as he believes. And in truth his unheroic work has not been barren of the results he aimed at; as witness the assertion made to me that girls in the colleges of America are taught that Harriet Shelley put a stain upon her husband's honor, and that that was what stung him into repurifying himself by deserting her and his child and entering into scandalous relations with a school-girl acquaintance of his.|$|R

25|$|According to the {{indexing}} theory, each {{phrase in}} a sentence can be given a unique index, which is a number (or letter) that identifies <b>that</b> <b>phrase</b> as picking out a particular entity in the world. It is possible to modify the indexes on these phrases so that two or more phrases have the same index. This is called co-indexation. If co-indexation occurs, the phrases with the same-numbered index will all refer to the same entity. This phenomenon is called co-reference.|$|E
25|$|In {{his most}} recent {{contributions}} to game studies, The Formation of Gaming Culture, Kirkpatrick {{has focused on the}} history of gameplay, looking at when the idea became the central term of game criticism in the 1980s. He argues that this corresponds to the period when games played on computers and arcade machines became ‘video (or computer) games’ in the sense we give <b>that</b> <b>phrase</b> today. As a social group formed in connection with the activity of playing the games, 'gamers' produced their own lexicon of game evaluation and appraisal, and their expectations and preferences shaped the subsequent development of gaming as a cultural practice.|$|E

25|$|Syntactic {{dependencies}} are {{the focus}} of most work in dependency grammar, as stated above. How the presence and the direction of syntactic dependencies are determined is of course often open to debate. In this regard, it must be acknowledged that the validity of syntactic dependencies in the trees throughout this article is being taken for granted. However, these hierarchies are such that many dependency grammars can largely support them, although there will certainly be points of disagreement. The basic question about how syntactic dependencies are discerned has proven difficult to answer definitively. One should acknowledge in this area, however, that the basic task of identifying and discerning the presence and direction of the syntactic dependencies of dependency grammars is no easier or harder than determining the constituent groupings of constituency grammars. A variety of heuristics are employed to this end, basic constituency tests being useful tools; the syntactic dependencies assumed in the trees in this article are grouping words together in a manner that most closely matches the results of standard permutation, substitution, and ellipsis constituency tests. Etymological considerations also provide helpful clues about the direction of dependencies. A promising principle upon which to base the existence of syntactic dependencies is distribution. When one is striving to identify the root of a given phrase, the word that is most responsible for determining the distribution of <b>that</b> <b>phrase</b> as a whole is its root.|$|E

[...] The group did not travel much initially; they decided to hone their sound and live performances before embarking on tours. In 1997, Project 86 was voted one of the top independent acts of the year by HM magazine readers. At Tomfest the same year, their performance was a big hit and Tooth & Nail Records, became interested and subsequently signed them.|$|E
500|$|Black, however, {{believed}} that this interpretation of the due process clause was unjustifiably broad. In his dissent to Griswold, he charged that the doctrine of substantive due process [...] "takes away from Congress and States {{the power to make}} laws based on their own judgment of fairness and wisdom, and transfers that power to this Court for ultimate determination." [...] Instead, Black advocated a much narrower interpretation of the clause. In his dissent to In re Winship, he analyzed the history of the term [...] "due process of law", and concluded: [...] "For me, the only correct meaning of <b>that</b> <b>phrase</b> is that our Government must proceed according to the 'law of the land'—that is, according to written constitutional and statutory provisions as interpreted by court decisions." ...|$|E

500|$|Cantor's 1874 Crelle {{paper was}} the first to invoke the notion of a 1-to-1 {{correspondence}}, though he did not use <b>that</b> <b>phrase.</b> He then began looking for a 1-to-1 correspondence between the points of the unit square and the points of a unit line segment. In an 1877 letter to Richard Dedekind, Cantor proved a far stronger result: for any positive integer n, there exists a 1-to-1 correspondence between the points on the unit line segment and all of the points in an n-dimensional space. About this discovery Cantor wrote to Dedekind: [...] "Je le vois, mais je ne le crois pas!" [...] ("I see it, but I don't believe it!") The result that he found so astonishing has implications for geometry and the notion of dimension.|$|E
500|$|An Israeli attorney's 1987 {{comment to}} the Christian Science Monitor, {{that his country}} had never [...] "tried to root out the PLO in the Arab street" [...] was the first modern use in its present sense without the scare quotes. By {{the end of the}} decade it came into wide use in both American {{academic}} and popular media, as coverage of the First Palestinian Intifada dominated news from the region. This may have been the result of geopolitical shifts taking place at the same time. New York Times language columnist William Safire anonymously quoted a Middle East expert who told him that before the late 1980s the term [...] "Arab masses" [...] had been used instead. [...] "With the eclipse of the Soviet Union, <b>that</b> <b>phrase</b> disappeared because [...] had too much of a Marxist–Soviet–Communist tilt to it."

In regard to artistic influences, Levine cited the books Nineteen Eighty-Four and Logan's Run, representing societies that have [...] "really interesting ideas screwed up by the fact that we're people". The idea of the mind control used on Jack was offered by LeBreton, inspired by films like The Manchurian Candidate, as a means to provide a better reason to limit the player's actions as opposed to the traditional use of locked doors to prevent them exploring areas they should not. The team had agreed that Jack's actions would be controlled by a key phrase but struggled with coming up with one that would not reveal Atlas' true nature.

500|$|Supporters of {{the bombings}} {{generally}} assert that they caused the Japanese surrender, preventing casualties {{on both sides}} during Operation Downfall. One figure of speech, [...] "One hundred million [...] will die for the Emperor and Nation", served as a unifying slogan, although <b>that</b> <b>phrase</b> {{was intended as a}} figure of speech {{along the lines of the}} [...] "ten thousand years" [...] phrase. In Truman's 1955 Memoirs, [...] "he states that the atomic bomb probably saved half a million U.S. lives—anticipated casualties in an Allied invasion of Japan planned for November. Stimson subsequently talked of saving one million U.S. casualties, and Churchill of saving one million American and half that number of British lives." [...] Scholars have pointed out various alternatives that could have ended the war without an invasion, but these alternatives could have resulted in the deaths of many more Japanese. Supporters also point to an order given by the Japanese War Ministry on August 1, 1944, ordering the execution of Allied prisoners of war when the POW camp was in the combat zone.|$|E
500|$|Loyalty to Loyaltys title {{comes from}} a paper {{of the same name}} by American philosopher Josiah Royce, in which he {{challenged}} Friedrich Nietzsche's ideas about [...] "will to power" [...] and the übermensch, [...] "saying that the ultimate pursuit of mankind should be to live in community and embrace each other, not to try to trample each other and rise to the top." [...] Maust said that he could relate to <b>that</b> <b>phrase</b> with the band saying that it's [...] "very similar to how [...] conduct ourselves, the way that [...] write songs and the way that [...] view each other in the band. No one person is writing for the other person, but we are loyal to each other. We're loyal to loyalty." [...] For the recording process, Maust explained that they took four months to experiment with deeper and grittier sounds they were comfortable with, compared to the first record that took eight days to create that carried [...] "a much more polished, for-radio sound." [...] He also commented that the overall dark tone throughout the album was the cause of constant touring across Europe, but said that it did more good than harm for the band because it led to them crafting songs that weren't written from the perspective of being on the road.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics of}} anti-apartheid protest music often used subversive {{meanings}} hidden under innocuous lyrics, partially {{as a consequence}} of the censorship that they experienced. Purely musical techniques were also used to convey meaning. The tendency to use hidden meaning increased as the government grew less tolerant from the 1950s to the 1980s. Popular protest songs of the 1950s often directly addressed politicians. [...] "Ndodemnyama we Verwoerd" [...] by Mini told Hendrik Verwoerd to [...] "Naants'indod'emnyama, Verwoerd bhasobha" [...] (beware of the advancing blacks), while a song referring to pass laws in 1956 included the phrase [...] "Hey Strydom, Wathint'a bafazi, way ithint'imbodoko uzaKufa" [...] (Strydom, now that you have touched the women, you have struck a rock, you have dislodged a boulder, and you will be crushed). Following the Sharpeville massacre songs became less directly critical of the government, and more mournful. [...] "Thina Sizwe" [...] included references to stolen land, was described as depicting emotional desolation, while [...] "Senzeni Na" [...] (what have we done) achieved the same effect by repeating <b>that</b> <b>phrase</b> a number of times. Some musicians adapted innocuous popular tunes and modified their lyrics, thereby avoiding the censors. The Soweto uprising marked a turning point in the movement, as songs written in the 1980s again became more direct, with the appearance of musicians such as Lucey, who [...] "believed in an in‐your‐face, tell‐it‐like‐it‐is approach". Lyrics from this period included calls such as [...] "They are lying to themselves. Arresting us, killing us, won't work. We'll still fight for our land," [...] and [...] "The whites don't negotiate with us, so let's fight".|$|E
