5|$|Randall's {{determination}} <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>spending,</b> {{combined with}} Southern Democrats' desire to reduce federal power {{in their home}} states, led the House to pass an army appropriation bill with a rider that repealed the Enforcement Acts, which {{had been used to}} suppress the Ku Klux Klan. The Enforcement Acts, passed during Reconstruction over Democratic opposition, made it a crime to prevent someone from voting because of his race. Hayes was determined to preserve the law protecting black voters, and he vetoed the appropriation. The Democrats did not have enough votes to override the veto, but they passed a new bill with the same rider. Hayes vetoed this as well, and the process was repeated three times more. Finally, Hayes signed an appropriation without the rider, but Congress refused to pass another bill to fund federal marshals, who were vital to the enforcement of the Enforcement Acts. The election laws remained in effect, but the funds to enforce them were curtailed. Randall's role in the process was limited, but the Democrats' failure to force Hayes's acquiescence weakened his appeal as a potential presidential candidate in 1880.|$|E
25|$|During 1991 and 1992 Kirner {{took several}} {{decisions}} to cut {{government spending and}} raise revenue to some extent, however her government failed <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>spending</b> in many areas including education. Most of the Kirner Government attempts <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>spending</b> were actively opposed by trade unions and {{some members of the}} government. The interest bill alone was $3.5billion per year, the government sold off trains and trams and leased them back. Another decision was the sale of the state-owned State Bank of Victoria to the Commonwealth Bank in 1991.|$|E

25|$|The {{response}} of the government was <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>spending</b> and institute a multitude of reforms to improve Sweden's competitiveness, among them reducing the welfare state and privatising public services and goods. Much of the political establishment promoted EU membership, and the Swedish referendum passed with 52% in favour of joining the EU on 13 November 1994. Sweden joined the European Union on 1 January 1995.|$|E
25|$|Three {{professional}} judges sit alongside six {{jurors in}} first instance proceedings or nine in appeal proceedings. Before 2012, {{there were nine}} or twelve jurors, but this was reduced <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>spending.</b> A two-thirds majority is {{needed in order to}} convict the defendant. During these procedures, judges and jurors have equal positions on questions of fact, while judges decide on questions of procedure. Judges and jurors also have equal positions on sentencing.|$|E
25|$|The {{value of}} the Australian pound {{remained}} tied to the pound sterling. Inflation in Australia thus increased, less than in Britain, but {{more than in the}} United States. The case for a central bank was increased by the need for the government <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>spending</b> after the war to reduce its debt. Commonwealth Bank Governor Denison Miller had been arguing for the issue of Australian currency to be switched from the treasury to the bank, as it had more staff and more monetary knowledge.|$|E
5000|$|The {{administration}} {{attempted to}} reconcile the conflicting pressures from the [...] "Asia firsters" [...] and pressures <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> federal <b>spending</b> while continuing to fight the Cold War effectively. On May 8, 1953, the President and his top advisors tackled this problem in [...] "Operation Solarium", named after the White House sunroom where the president conducted secret discussions. Although it was not traditional to ask military men to consider factors outside their professional discipline, the President instructed the group to strike a proper balance between his goals <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> government <b>spending</b> and an ideal military posture.|$|R

25|$|The {{welfare system}} {{that had been}} growing rapidly since the 1970s could not be {{sustained}} with a falling GDP, lower employment and larger welfare payments. In 1994 the government budget deficit exceeded 15% of GDP. The response of the government was <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>spending</b> and institute a multitude of reforms to improve Sweden's competitiveness. When the international economic outlook improved combined with a rapid growth in the IT sector, which Sweden was well positioned to capitalize on, the country was able {{to emerge from the}} crisis.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, Finland {{fell into}} a {{depression}} caused {{by a combination of}} economic overheating, fixed currency, depressed Western, Soviet, and local markets. Stock market and housing prices declined by 50%. The growth in the 1980s was based on debt and defaults started rolling in. GDP declined by 15% and unemployment increased from a virtual full employment to one fifth of the workforce. The crisis was amplified by trade unions' initial opposition to any reforms. Politicians struggled <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>spending</b> and the public debt doubled to around 60% of GDP. Some 7â€“8% of GDP was needed to bail out failing banks and force banking sector consolidation. After devaluations the depression bottomed out in 1993.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, the Finnish economy {{fell into}} a severe recession. This {{was caused by a}} {{combination}} of economic overheating (largely due to a change in the banking laws in 1986 which made credit much more accessible), depressed markets with key trading partners (particularly the Swedish and Soviet markets) as well as local markets, slow growth with other trading partners, and the disappearance of the Soviet bilateral trade. Stock market and housing prices declined by 50%. The growth in the 1980s was based on debt, and when the defaults began rolling in, GDP declined by 13% and unemployment increased from a virtual full employment to one fifth of the workforce. The crisis was amplified by trade unions' initial opposition to any reforms. Politicians struggled <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>spending</b> and the public debt doubled to around 60% of GDP. Much of the economic growth in the 1980s was based on debt financing, and the debt defaults led to a savings and loan crisis. A total of over 10 billion euros were used to bail out failing banks, which led to banking sector consolidation.|$|E

500|$|In 1944, Rab Butler {{introduced}} the Education Act 1944 which amongst other changes, including {{the introduction of}} the Tripartite System, included raising the school leaving age to 15. Although the act should have been brought into effect as from September 1939, it was not implemented because of the effects of World War II, but was eventually enforced from April 1947. The Comprehensive school system has since replaced the Tripartite System brought in by this act across most of England. This act also recommended compulsory part-time education for all children until the age of 18, but was dropped, in [...] similar fashion to the 1918 Act, <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>spending</b> after World War II.|$|E
500|$|Soon {{after being}} elected, Williams {{announced}} the province's debts were so burdensome {{that he had}} no choice but <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>spending</b> and freeze wages. Based on the projected $840million budget deficit for 2004, the government announced sweeping cuts. A number of projects would be cut, and others delayed. Cuts included three health care facilities and a school; delayed projects included, most notably, the opening of The Rooms, the province's cultural facility that was under construction. Spurred by the administration's announcement of pay-freeze and plan to eliminate 4,000 public sector jobs, a strike was declared among the 20,000 public sector employees two days following the announcement, at midnight April 1, 2004. The strike ended nearly a month later when Williams reneged on a campaign promise and legislated the employees back to work. Later that year the Williams government compressed health and education boards in an attempt for a more efficient delivery of services, a move that still receives criticism in the province.|$|E
500|$|The Conservative Party led by Edward Heath won the 1970 general election, and Thatcher was {{subsequently}} {{appointed to the}} Cabinet as Secretary of State for Education and Science. During her first months in office she attracted public attention {{as a result of}} Chancellor Iain Macleod's attempts <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>spending.</b> She gave priority to academic needs in schools, while administering public expenditure cuts on the state education system, resulting in the abolition of free milk for schoolchildren aged seven to eleven. She held that few children would suffer if schools were charged for milk, but agreed to provide younger children with a third of a pint daily, for nutritional purposes. Cabinet papers later revealed that she opposed the policy but had been forced into it by the Treasury. Her decision provoked a storm of protest from both Labour and the press, leading to the notorious turn of phrase [...] "Margaret Thatcher, Milk Snatcher". She reportedly considered leaving politics in the aftermath and later wrote in her autobiography: [...] "I learned a valuable lesson [...] I had incurred the maximum of political odium for the minimum of political benefit." ...|$|E

500|$|As the Wisconsin primary loomed {{in early}} April, Nixon's only {{obstacle}} {{seemed to be}} preventing his supporters from voting in the Democratic primary for Senator Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota as a protest against President Johnson. However, Johnson [...] before the primary, meanwhile Governor Reagan's name was {{on the ballot in}} Wisconsin, but he did not campaign in the state and was still not a declared candidate. Nixon won the primary with 80% followed by Reagan with 11% and Stassen with 6%. With Johnson removed from the race, Nixon fell behind Democratic candidates Eugene McCarthy, Hubert Humphrey and Robert Kennedy in head-to-head match-ups. At the end of April, Nixon called for a moratorium on criticism of the Johnson policy in Vietnam as negotiations were underway: [...] "The one man who can do anything about peace is Lyndon Johnson, and I'm {{not going to do anything}} to undercut him." [...] However, the Democratic candidates for president remained fair game for criticism. He argued that [...] "A divided Democratic Party cannot unite a divided country; a united Republican Party can." [...] He also began to discuss economics more frequently, announcing plans <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>spending</b> while criticizing the Democrats' policy of raising taxes. During a question and answer session with the American Society of Newspaper Editors, Nixon spoke out of turn, receiving numerous interruptions of applause. The largest came when he addressed the issue of crime, proclaiming that [...] "there cannot be order in a free society without progress, and there cannot be progress without order." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{imperial}} treasury was bankrupted {{by rising}} state debt and falling revenues. Alexander {{was aware of}} the crisis but never tackled its root cause, the oversized peacetime army of 800,000 men. Alexander expected future wars in Southern Europe and the Middle East, and feared that mass dismissal of veteran soldiers would cause insurrection. He could not let them go: they were not needed in their native villages, and there were no jobs in the cities. Instead of reducing the army to an affordable peacetime size, Alexander tried <b>to</b> <b>cut</b> <b>spending</b> through the establishment of self-sustaining military settlements, which failed [...] "from start to finish". He replaced expensive field maneuvers with drill exercise and parades, alienating experienced commanders and contributing to dissatisfaction of the nobility.|$|E
2500|$|Greenwich {{had shown}} early {{interest}} in leading a fight against rate-capping, and its leader John Austin-Walker had signed the personal statement published in Labour Herald on 22 June 1984.

The council brought its own proceedings for judicial review against the government's decision to cap its budget, which was set down for initial hearing on 12 April with the main hearing not until 19 June.
