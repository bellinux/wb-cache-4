5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of World War II, No.6 Squadron escorted convoys off the Australian east coast and undertook training exercises with the Australian Army and RAN. The squadron's Ansons were replaced by twelve Mark I Lockheed Hudson light bombers during April and May 1940. These aircraft were much more capable than the Ansons, having a longer range, higher speed and greater bomb load. No.6 Squadron continued to be based at Richmond, though detachments were made to other airstrips along the east coast when the squadron escorted troop convoys. In August 1940 the squadron conducted long range patrols searching for German raiders which {{were present in the}} <b>Tasman</b> <b>Sea,</b> but without success.|$|E

Curving southeastward, Althea re-emerged over open waters between Maryborough and Double Island Point on 26 December and began to intensify once again. At 00:00 UTC on 28 December, the cyclone reached a third peak with 10-minute winds of 110km/h (70mph), but as it turned more toward the south, increasingly cooler sea surface temperatures weakened the cyclone. On 29 December, Althea lost its tropical characteristics over the <b>Tasman</b> <b>Sea.</b>|$|E

5|$|Throughout the season, a {{shift in}} the Hadley Circulation towards the <b>Tasman</b> <b>Sea</b> {{resulted}} in more frequent episodes of strong wind shear and regular pulses of dry air into the deep tropics, significantly hindering tropical cyclogenesis. The below-average activity was also reflected in an unusually low number of damaging storms. Only two systems, Trina and Waka, had significant effects on land. The former caused extensive flooding on Mangaia while the latter was {{regarded as one of the}} most damaging storms in the history of Tonga. Approximately $51.3million in damage was attributed to Waka as well as an indirect fatality, the only tropical cyclone-related death of the year, due to cardiac arrest.|$|E

During this exercise, Melbourne {{acquired}} the nickname 'Little M' after working with 'Big E' —the smallest and largest aircraft carriers (respectively) in operation at the time. On return in July, the carrier entered a major refit, which continued until 3 August 1979. During this refit, on 3 March, a boiler explosion caused minor damage to the carrier. The remainder of the year involved participation in three exercises, Tasmanex off Wellington, New Zealand, Sea Eagle I in the <b>Tasman</b> <b>Sea,</b> and Kangaroo III in the Coral Sea. During Tasmanex, Melbourne lost her LW-02 radar aerial and a Skyhawk, both of which fell overboard during heavy seas.|$|E

50|$|The {{current is}} very low in nutrients, however, it remains {{important}} for the marine ecosystem.

5|$|Tropical Cyclone Sose was a {{moderate}} storm system that chiefly impacted the island nation of Vanuatu in early April 2001. The developing cyclone was first detected on April 3, while situated {{well to the}} northeast of Vanuatu. As atmospheric conditions became more conducive to intensification, the disturbance gradually consolidated as it drifted toward the west-southwest. After receiving the name Sose on April 5, the cyclone was driven southeastward, passing just west of Espiritu Santo and neighboring islands. Although it never made landfall, Sose was particularly expansive, producing a wide area of gale-force winds. The cyclone peaked in strength between April 7 and 8 with maximum 10-minute sustained winds of 110 km/h (70 mph) and 1-minute sustained winds of 130 km/h (80 mph), placing it at Category 2 intensity on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. Ultimately, stronger wind shear and an increasingly hostile upper-air pattern took their toll on the cyclone as it progressed due south; Sose lost tropical characteristics to the northeast of Norfolk Island by April 12. The extratropical remnants of Sose continued into the <b>Tasman</b> <b>Sea.</b>|$|E
5|$|Sose {{made its}} closest {{approach}} to New Caledonia early on April 8, passing about 280 km (175 mi) to the northeast. A strong area of high pressure over New Zealand served to tighten to surface pressure gradient {{well to the}} south of Sose's center, contributing to an overall very large envelope of gale-force winds. In turn, the cyclone affected numerous islands on both side of its path, despite never having made landfall. As it progressed on its southeastward track, the cyclone began to show signs of weakening, at least partially due to increasing wind shear from an approaching upper trough. At the same time, a mid-level ridge to the east forced the storm to turn due south; the conflicting wind patterns undermined the cyclone's circulation, causing its center at the surface to separate from the deep convection. Both the FMS and the JTWC reflected steady weakening, and by early on April 10, the center had become exposed and ill-defined. Sose then entered the area of responsibility of the Tropical Cyclone Warning Center in Wellington, New Zealand, where it continued to deteriorate. The JTWC issued its last warning on 19P at 0600 UTC on April 11, while the system was located about 335km (210mi) northeast of Norfolk Island. TCWC Wellington soon downgraded Sose to a tropical depression as it underwent an extratropical transition. Drifting south-southwestward, the cyclone lost its tropical identity early on April 12. The remnant low ultimately moved over the <b>Tasman</b> <b>Sea,</b> where it was absorbed by a broad low pressure system about to travel over New Zealand's North Island. Abundant residual tropical moisture acted on the low pressure environment to create widespread precipitation across northern New Zealand.|$|E

40|$|Details of the Late Cretaceous-Cenozoic {{migration}} of the Australian continent have been sources of contention since the 1960 s. Two types of apparent polar wander paths (APWPs) {{have emerged from}} previous paleomagnetic studies: one group based on sedimentary and lateritic data that includes relatively linear northward motion of Australia away from Antarctica, and a second group, based on basaltic and lateritic data, that includes significant longitudinal movement of the Australian continent. This study compares the migration and evolution of the Australian plate over the past 100 m. y. using these two competing paths. Our animated reconstructions illustrate the relative motion of the Australian plate, the formation of Cenozoic volcanic provinces in eastern Australia, {{the opening of the}} Coral and <b>Tasman</b> <b>Seas,</b> and the docking of the Ontong Java Plateau with the Solomon Islands. The reconstructions incorporate new 40 Ar/ 39 Ar and previously published geochronology data from Late Cretaceous to Cenozoic east Australian mafic to felsic volcanism in order to evaluate potential relationships between volcanism, changes in the motion of the Australian plate, and the opening of the <b>Tasman</b> and Coral <b>Seas.</b> We conclude that the APWP that includes significant longitudinal movement is more compatible than the linear path with both observable geological features (such as volcanic tracks) and the global moving hotspot reference frame. Our reconstructions reveal little correspondence between opening of the <b>Tasman</b> and Coral <b>Seas</b> and eruption of east Australian lava fields. However, the reconstructions and new 40 Ar/ 39 Ar geochronology illustrate that the formation of east Australian Late Cretaceous to Cenozoic central volcanoes and lava fields were closely linked, both temporally and spatially, and we suggest that edgedriven convection was an important process in the generation of both types of east Australian volcanic provinces...|$|R
40|$|The spatial {{structure}} of the semidiurnal internal tide in the Coral and <b>Tasman</b> <b>Seas</b> is characterised using observational data from expendable bathythermographs, Argo floats and unmanned autonomous gliders.

Amplitudes were generally below 5 m along the Australian coastline, with larger amplitudes, up to 20 m, observed close to steep, critical topography. Detailed analysis of individual regions allows the mechanisms responsible for internal tide generation to be isolated, with these ranging from local generation over topography to remote generation on distant ridges. In most areas the observed {{spatial structure}} of the amplitude compares positively with previous studies, with inconsistent results in other areas attributed to variability in the background conditions not {{accounted for by the}} analysis methods.

40|$|The {{presence}} of tattoo skin disease (TSD) was examined in 1392 free-ranging and dead odontocetes comprising 17 species from the Americas, Europe, South Africa, New Zealand and Greenland. We investigated whether TSD prevalence varied with sex, age and health status. TSD was encountered in cetaceans from the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans {{as well as}} in those from the North, Mediterranean and <b>Tasman</b> <b>Seas.</b> No clear patterns related to geography and host phylogeny were detected, except that prevalence of TSD in juveniles and, in 2 species (dusky dolphin Lagenorhynchus obscurus and Burmeister’s porpoise Phocoena spinipinnis), in adults was remarkably high in samples from Peru. Environmental factors and virus properties may be responsible for this finding. Sex did not significantly influence TSD prevalence except in the case of Peruvian P. spinipinnis. Generally, there was a pattern of TSD increase in juveniles compared to calves, attributed to the loss of maternal immunity. Also, in most samples, juveniles seemed to have a higher probability of suffering TSD than adults, presumably because more adults had acquired active immunity following infection. This holo-endemic pattern was inverted in poor health short-beaked common dolphins Delphinus delphis and harbour porpoises Phocoena phocoena from the British Isles, and in Chilean dolphins Cephalorhynchus eutropia from Patagonia, where adults showed a higher TSD prevalence than juveniles. Very large tattoos were seen in some adult odontocetes from the SE Pacific, NE Atlantic and Portugal’s Sado Estuary, which suggest impaired immune response. The epidemiological pattern of TSD may be an indicator of cetacean population health...|$|R

40|$|The stock {{structure}} and movement patterns of broadbill swordfish (Xiphias gladius) {{in the south}} Pacific Ocean are uncertain and potentially {{have important implications for}} assessment and management.

40|$|Cenozoic deep-sea {{sedimentation}} in {{the southwest}} Pacific area was controlled by large changes in the patterns of bottom-water circula-tion and erosion. The circulation patterns were largely controlled {{by the development of}} the Circum-Antarctic Current south of Australia. Development of the Circum-Antarctic Current did not oc-cur until the middle to late Oligocene when final separation occurred south of the South Tasman Rise, although initial sea-floor spreading between Australia and Antarctica commenced in the late early Eocene. Before the late Oligocene an erosive western boundary current flowed northwards through the <b>Tasman</b> and Coral <b>Sea</b> areas creating a regional unconformity centered near the Eocene-Oligocene boundary (Leg 21). When circum-Antarctic flow was es-tablished in the late Oligocene, a regional Neogene unconformity formed south of Australia and New Zealand, and sedimentation recommenced in the northern Tasman-Coral Sea area. This was due to the western boundary flow which earlier passed through the region and was largely diverted to the area east of New Zealand and into the Tonga Trench. A world-wide Oligocene unconformity was created by a major change in bottom-water circulation, in turn caus-ed by increased bottom-water production related to the onset of sub-stantial Antarctic glaciation near the Eocene-Oligocene boundary. The separation of Australia from Antarctica led to a fundamental change in the world's oceanic circulation and its climate that marks the onset of the modern climatic regime...|$|R
40|$|The {{intensity}} and tectonic origin of late Cenozoic intraplate deformation in eastern Australia is relatively poorly understood. Here {{we show that}} Cenozoic volcanic rocks in southeast Queensland have been deformed by numerous faults. Using gridded aeromagnetic data and field observations, structural investigations were conducted on these faults. Results show that faults have mainly undergone strike-slip movement with a reverse component, displacing Cenozoic volcanic rocks ranging in ages from similar to 31 to similar to 21 Ma. These ages imply that faulting must have occurred after the late Oligocene. Late Cenozoic deformation has mostly occurred due to the reactivation of major faults, which were active during episodes of basin formation in the Jurassic-Early Cretaceous and later during {{the opening of the}} <b>Tasman</b> and Coral <b>Seas</b> from the Late Cretaceous to the early Eocene. The wrench reactivation of major faults in the late Cenozoic also gave rise to the occurrence of brittle subsidiary reverse strike-slip faults that affected Cenozoic volcanic rocks. Intraplate transpressional deformation possibly resulted from far-field stresses transmitted from the collisional zones at the northeast and southeast boundaries of the Australian plate during the late Oligocene-early Miocene and from the late Miocene to the Pliocene. These events have resulted in the hitherto unrecognized reactivation of faults in eastern Australia. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|The North Pine Fault System (NPFS) in SE Queensland {{belongs to}} a series of NNW-striking sinistral faults that {{displaced}} Paleozoic to Cenozoic rock units in eastern Australia. We have studied the geometry and kinematics of the NPFS by utilizing gridded aeromagnetic data, digital elevation models, and field observations. The results indicate that all segments of the NPFS were subjected to sinistral reverse strike-slip faulting. Restorations of displaced magnetic anomalies indicate sinistral offsets ranging from ∼ 3. 4 to ∼ 8. 2 km. The existence of a (possibly) Late Triassic granophyre dyke parallel to one of the fault segments, and the occurrence of NNW-striking steeply dipping strike-slip and normal faults in the Late Triassic-Early Cretaceous Maryborough Basin, indicate that the NPFS has likely been active during the Mesozoic. We propose that from Late Cretaceous to early Eocene, NNW-striking faults in eastern Australia, including the NPFS, were reactivated with oblique sinistral-normal kinematics in response to regional oblique extension associated {{with the opening of the}} <b>Tasman</b> and Coral <b>Seas.</b> This interpretation is consistent with the modeled dominant NNE- to NNW-directed horizontal tensional stress in the Eocene. The latest movements along the NPFS involved sinistral transpressional kinematics, which was possibly related to far-field contractional stresses from collisional tectonics at the eastern and northern boundaries of the Australian plate in the Cenozoic. This sinistral-reverse oblique kinematics of the NPFS in the Cenozoic is in line with ∼ESE to ENE orientations of the modeled maximum horizontal stress in SE Queensland...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{compares the}} {{performance}} of operational short-range ocean forecast systems developed under the Global Ocean Data Assimilation Experiment (GODAE) - an international effort to demonstrate the feasibility of operational ocean forecasting. 'Best estimates' from four different operational forecast systems (either analyses, hindcasts, or nowcasts) are inter-compared for the <b>Tasman</b> and Coral <b>Seas,</b> off eastern Australia. Systems considered include those developed in Australia, France, the USA, and the UK. Each system is compared to observations of along-track sea-level anomaly, sea-surface temperature, near-surface velocity, and sub-surface temperature and salinity. All have their strengths and weaknesses, and each system out-performs all others in one aspect or another. With few exceptions, all systems demonstrate signal-to-noise ratios greater than one for all variables. Due to the Australian focus, {{in addition to the}} best estimates from the operational systems, operational forecasts and a delayed-mode reanalysis are also inter-compared using the Australian system. The Australian system generally performs the best for sea-level anomaly; the French system is best for near-surface velocities; the USA system generally performs the best for sea-surface temperature; and the UK system is best for sub-surface temperature and salinity. These findings provide useful indicators of deficiencies in each system and clear metrics by which future developments should be assessed. Based on these results and other practical considerations the adoption of multimodel consensus forecasting, using all available forecasts from all systems, is promoted as the most robust approach for the user community. Such developments are being pursued under GODAE OceanView - the successor to GODAE. The results show the success of GODAE in demonstrating the feasibility of operational oceanography...|$|R
40|$|U-Pb geochronology and Lu-Hf isotope {{analysis}} of detrital zircon from the mid-Cretaceous Winton and Mackunda Formations in the Eromanga Basin {{were employed to}} investigate regional provenance patterns {{in order to better}} understand the tectonic setting and paleogeography of eastern Australia during the late Mesozoic. A suite of Mesozoic-aged zircon populations recovered from these formations suggests that volcanism along the eastern margin of Australia was relatively continuous from the Triassic (252 Ma) to at least the mid-Cretaceous (ca. 92 Ma). Cretaceous-age zircon populations dominate the provenance record, and a distinct upsection younging trend in Cretaceous grain ages indicates that deposition was largely synchronous with ongoing volcanism to the east. Lu-Hf isotopic data suggest that these zircon populations were sourced from igneous rocks of a mixed juvenile and crustal source, similar to Lu-Hf isotopic systematics for eastern Australian zircons from Pennsylvanian–Permian igneous assemblages (307 – 252 Ma), for which an active convergent margin association is well established. An extensive Cretaceous volcanic terrain, now limited to the Whitsunday Igneous Association, was once located along the northeastern margin of Australia. Results from this study support the hypothesis that the Whitsunday igneous association was the main source of Cretaceous sediment to the Eromanga Basin, and likely for sediment transported across the continent southward and into the Ceduna Delta system offshore South Australia. The Whitsunday igneous association has been interpreted as a siliceous large igneous province associated with the onset of rifting in the region and linked to opening of the <b>Tasman</b> and Coral <b>Seas.</b> Yet, in this study, we document a relatively continuous Late Triassic to Late Cretaceous (240 – 92 Ma) age range for detrital zircons from the Mackunda and Winton Formations, consistent with relatively uninterrupted magmatic activity along the continental margin until ca. 92 Ma (earliest Turonian). Furthermore, zircon grains across this age spectrum exhibit dominantly positive to strongly positive εHf(t) values, between + 4 and + 12, consistent with values known for zircon suites from older magmatic arc rocks of eastern Australia. Although these data do not support a conclusive interpretation, they are consistent with an east Australian magmatic arc related to westward subduction of paleo-Pacific oceanic crust beneath eastern Australia enduring into the Cretaceous, as distinct from extensional siliceous large igneous province magmatism unrelated to subduction and generated by rupture of continental crust...|$|R
