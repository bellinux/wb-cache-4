The shield is differenced by a label argent of three points, demonstrating that she is <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> monarch; the outer points bore an ermine spot each, and the centre bore a rose gules, to differentiate her from {{other members of the}} royal family.|$|E
5|$|Wai was <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Native Hawaiian {{mother and}} a Chinese father. Growing up, he often surfed with Duke Kahanamoku, {{regarded}} {{as the father of}} surfing, and Buster Crabbe, who later became an actor. He attended the Punahou School in Honolulu where he earned athletic letters in track, football and baseball. He went to college at the Sacramento Junior College before transferring to UCLA. At UCLA, he was a four sport athlete and graduated in 1939 with a bachelor's degree in Banking and Finance. He intended to work alongside his father in real estate and banking but instead joined the military upon the outbreak of World War II.|$|E
5|$|Erika Hügel-Marshall {{was born}} on 13 March 1947, <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Bavarian woman and an African-American soldier, Eddie Marshall, who had {{returned}} to the US before her birth. Her parents had met just after the end of World War II, after a relaxation of laws forbidding military personnel from interacting with civilians. According to her, black soldiers treated native German children well, distributing food and clothing, but her parents generally met in secret due to racist remarks from others. In November 1946 her father returned to the US after an illness. By that time, both of them knew that her mother was pregnant, but she did not know he was leaving until after he was already gone. A year after Ika's birth, her mother married a German and a half-sister was born the following year. Her mother and grandmother loved her and treated her like any other child, despite social disapproval. She was close to her half-sister, but her step-father was distant toward her.|$|E

5|$|Fontaneda {{explained}} in his 1571 memoir that Carlos controlled fifty villages located on Florida's west coast, around Lake Okeechobee (which they called Mayaimi) {{and on the}} Florida Keys (which they called Martires). Smaller tribes of Ais and Jaega who lived {{to the east of}} Lake Okeechobee, paid regular tributes to Carlos. The Spanish suspected the Calusa of harvesting treasures from shipwrecks and distributing the gold and silver between the Ais and Jaega, with Carlos receiving the majority. The main village of the Calusa, and home of Carlos, bordered Estero Bay at present-day Mound Key where the Caloosahatchee River meets the Gulf of Mexico. Fontaneda described human sacrifice as a common practice: when <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> cacique died, each resident gave up a child to be sacrificed, and when the cacique died, his servants were sacrificed to join him. Each year a Christian was required to be sacrificed to appease a Calusa idol. The building of shell mounds of varying sizes and shapes was also of spiritual significance to the Calusa. In 1895 Frank Hamilton Cushing excavated a massive shell mound on Key Marco that was composed of several constructed terraces hundreds of yards long. Cushing unearthed over a thousand Calusa artifacts. Among them he found tools made of bone and shell, pottery, human bones, masks, and animal carvings made of wood.|$|E

30|$|In the experiments, no {{compression}} is used. The {{storage requirement}} of IBSL {{is more than}} that of the other methods. This is expectable, as IBSL is a prefix-based scheme and its label size depends on <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> every node, i.e. the fan-out of XML documents. Regarding Table  1, the maximum fan-out of dataset Orders is 15, 000. Therefore, it uses 15, 001 bits (1 bit zero and 15, 000 bits one) to signify <b>the</b> last <b>child</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> given node. Moreover, this scheme is based on a fix-length approach, i.e. <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> intended node have the same label size. However, new needs maximum 17 bits for this case, where all <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> node {{do not have the same}} label size.|$|R

50|$|A PQ tree {{represents}} its permutations via permissible reorderings <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> its nodes. <b>The</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> P node may be reordered in any way. <b>The</b> <b>children</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> Q node may be put {{in reverse}} order, but may not otherwise be reordered. A PQ tree represents all leaf node orderings {{that can be achieved}} by any sequence of these two operations. A PQ tree with many P and Q nodes can represent complicated subsets of the set of all possible orderings. However, not every set of orderings may be representable in this way; for instance, if an ordering is represented by a PQ tree, the reverse of the ordering must also be represented by the same tree.|$|R

25|$|Like {{many other}} types of social category, in Judaism the mamzer status is {{hereditary}} - a child of a mamzer (whether mother or father) is also a mamzer. However, since these rules are regarded as applying only to Jews, and since traditional Rabbinical law regards being a Jew as something which is only maternally inheritable, <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> male mamzer and a non-Jewish woman cannot be a mamzer. Notably, <b>the</b> <b>child</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> female mamzer and a non-Jewish man is an ordinary Jew, because both parents must be Jews in order for mamzer status to accrue to the child, but the child does inherit Jewish status from the mother.|$|E
