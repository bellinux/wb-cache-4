For example, the Washington DC Metro system has increased land desirability around its stations, and The Hong Kong metro MTR generates a profit by redeveloping land around and above its stations. Much public opposition to new transit construction can be based on <b>the</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> the impact on neighborhoods of this new economic development.

25|$|The Minister for Home Affairs {{pointed out}} that the Minister would not in {{practice}} make the decision in isolation {{from the rest of the}} Cabinet. Even so, amendments were made to the process of the decision to issue a restraining order. While the Minister would have power to make the order in first instance by issuing a notice to the individual, this order would have to be confirmed by the President within 30 days of the receipt of the report of the PCRH. The President would act on Cabinet's advice except where it was contrary to the PCRH's recommendation. These changes formalized the involvement of the Cabinet in the decision-making process and involved the President as an additional safeguard, thereby addressing <b>the</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> the subjectivity of allowing the Minister to be the sole decision-maker. However, it was decided that the decision to issue a restraining order would remain non-justiciable and would not be subject to judicial review.|$|E

Its reversal demonstrated <b>the</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> the impact of revolutionary propaganda on the loyalty of Vietnamese troops, and the consequent uncertainty about the reliability of this instrument of colonial rule.

2500|$|Before 1995, P. fuscatus was {{the only}} species of Polistes in Michigan.

Although the removal of P. dominula population did slow down their expansion, in 2005, 62% of the colonies at the Preserve were P. dominula.

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> {{expanding}} bullets {{was brought}} up at the 1899 Hague Convention by Swiss and Dutch representatives. The Swiss were concerned about small arms ammunition that [...] "increased suffering", and the Dutch focused on the British Mark III [...]303 loading in response to their treatment of Boer settlers in South Africa. The British and American defense was {{that they should not}} focus on specific bullet designs, like hollow-points, but instead on rounds that caused [...] "superfluous injury". The parties in the end agreed to abstain from using expanding bullets. As a result, the Mark III and other expanding versions of the [...]303 were not issued during the Second Boer War (1899–1902). Boer guerrillas allegedly used expanding hunting ammunition against the British during the war, and New Zealand Commonwealth troops may have brought Mark III rounds with them privately after the Hague Convention without authorization.|$|E
2500|$|Rumors abounded that Johnson's real {{motive was}} {{to operate the}} Athletics in Kansas City for a few years, then move the team to Los Angeles (the Brooklyn Dodgers would later move there from New York City after the 1957 season). [...] Whatever <b>the</b> <b>concern</b> <b>about</b> the move to Kansas City, fans turned out in record numbers for the era. In 1955, the Kansas City Athletics drew 1,393,054 to Municipal Stadium, a club record easily surpassing the {{previous}} record of 945,076 in 1948; in fact, it was the third-highest attendance figure in the majors, behind only the all-powerful Yankees and the also recently relocated Milwaukee Braves in the National League (1953-1969). That number would never be approached again while the team was in Kansas City, and would remain the club record for attendance until 1982—the Athletics' 15th season in Oakland. [...] This was mainly because the A's were barely competitive; in five years under Johnson's ownership, the closest they got to a winning record was 1958, when they finished 73-81, eight games below [...]500 and 19 games out of first.|$|E

The Austrian government asked only for a few ten thousands of Russian troops under imperial leadership, but tzar Nicholas I of Russia decided to send 200 000 soldiers and put other 80 000 to preparedness to enter in Hungary if needed. This meant that he prepared to send 1/4th of Russia's military power in Hungary. This huge army, together with the 170 000 soldiers of the Habsburgs, together with the several tens of thousands of Serbian, Romanian and Croatian nationality troops fighting against the only 170 000 Hungarian soldiers, represented an invincible force for them.

And all I can say to you [...] is I don't have any doubt about the reason why the Holy Father has asked me to do this, which is his genuine love and concern for religious women." [...] On the other hand, Farrell noted that there is disagreement over the meaning of vows of obedience for nuns: [...] "Well I think there is one of the areas of misunderstanding and difference. Our first obedience is to God. What we obey is God and God's call to us as expressed in so many different sources, it's not just the teaching authority of the Church, although that is certainly a legitimate part of it." [...] "We have never wanted the men to tell us what to do." [...] She added that the motivation of the inquisition by men in the Vatican appeared to be motivated by their fears rather than the love and concern Sartain cited. Farrell commented: [...] "I don't know, but it feels to me like fear. What would happen if women really were given a place of equality in the Church?" [...] The Holy See says [...] "good works aren't the issue, its annual meetings" [...] are the issue. [...] "It doesn't make sense," [...] Sartain reasoned about the speakers selected by the LCWR, [...] "that a conference of Women Religious would want to give a platform to somebody who would espouse ideas antithetical to what the Church teaches." ...|$|E

Then we fell to straining our courtesies upon one another.
