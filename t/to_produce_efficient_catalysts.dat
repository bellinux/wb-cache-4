40|$|Homogeneous and enzymatic {{catalysis}} offer complementary means to generate enantiomerically pure compounds. For this reason, in a biomimetic spirit, efforts are currently {{under way in}} different groups to design artificial enzymes. Two complementary strategies are possible to incorporate active organometallic catalyst precursors into a protein environment. The first strategy utilizes covalent anchoring of the organometallic complexes into the protein environment. The second strategy relies {{on the use of}} non-covalent incorporation of the organometallic precursor into the protein. In this review, attention is focused on the use of semisynthetic enzymes <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>efficient</b> enantioselective hybrid <b>catalysts</b> for a given reaction.

40|$|The {{relatively}} short lifetime of unidimensional 10 -ring zeolite catalysts in the methanol to hydrocarbons reaction is improved {{by a factor}} of ~ 20 by introducing mesoporosity in the zeolites via sequential desilication and acid post-synthetic treatments. The catalytic selective production of high quality low-aromatics gasoline precursors is improved. By using two morphologically distinct starting ZSM- 22 samples and three desilication methods, the study concludes that the conditions of the treatment need to be adjusted depending on the properties of the starting material in order <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> more <b>efficient</b> MTH <b>catalysts.</b> Particularly, the parent zeolite morphology is the most influential parameter for the mesopore generation. The influence of the starting material on the change in the catalyst properties (composition, acidity, porosity) is also reflected in the catalytic improvement, which is explained based on a more efficient use of the hierarchical catalyst crystal, allowing longer operation of the alkene cycle during MTH. Operando XRD experiments provided insights into the ZSM- 22 deactivation mechanism {{as a function of the}} applied post-synthetic method and co-feeding experiments...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{apparent}} {{simplicity of the}} OpenMP directive shared memory programming model and the sophisticated dependence analysis and code generation capabilities of the ParaWise/CAPO tools, experience shows that a level of expertise is required <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>efficient</b> parallel code. In a real world application the investigation of a single loop in a generated parallel code can soon become an indepth inspection of numerous dependencies in many routines. The additional understanding of dependencies is also needed to effectively interpret the information provided and supply the required feedback. The ParaWise Expert Assistant has been developed to automate this investigation and present questions to the user about, and in the context of, their application code. In this paper, we demonstrate that knowledge of dependence information and OpenMP are no longer essential <b>to</b> <b>produce</b> <b>efficient</b> parallel code with the Expert Assistant.
