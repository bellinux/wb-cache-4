5|$|During the Interwar, Belgium {{pursued a}} policy of {{political}} neutrality and attempted to avoid confrontation with Nazi Germany. When <b>the</b> <b>Phony</b> War broke out, Pierlot became {{the leader of a}} tripartite national government of Catholics, Liberals and Socialists which stayed in power until the German invasion in May 1940.|$|E
5|$|On 1 September 1939, the {{invasion}} of Poland by Nazi Germany began. Consequently, Britain and France, obligated by the Anglo-Polish military alliance and Franco-Polish alliance to attack Germany {{in the case of}} such an invasion, demanded that Germany withdraw. On 3 September 1939, after Germany failed to comply, Britain, France, and most countries of the British Empire declared war on Germany, but provided little military support to Poland. They took minimal military action during what became known as <b>the</b> <b>Phony</b> War.|$|E
5|$|Tătărescu {{remained}} in office {{throughout the rest}} of <b>the</b> <b>Phony</b> War, until the fall of France, and his cabinet signed an economic agreement with Nazi Germany (through which virtually all Romanian exports were directed towards the latter country) and saw the crumbling of Romania's alliance with the United Kingdom and France. The cabinet was brought down by the cession of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to the Soviet Union (effects of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact), as well as by Carol's attempt to appease German hostility by dissolving it, replacing Tătărescu with Ion Gigurtu, and recreating the Front as the totalitarian Party of the Nation.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Phonies</b> are a Finnish {{rock band}} formed in Ykspihlaja, Kokkola in 2002. The band's members are vocalist Tom Stenman, guitarist Risto Lehtomaa, and bassist Pekka Hietalahti. <b>The</b> <b>Phonies</b> is coupled around the songwriting {{partnership}} of Tom Stenman and Risto Lehtomaa, {{who have been}} working together since the late 1980s. In addition to <b>The</b> <b>Phonies,</b> Stenman and Lehtomaa are known from the late Finnish guitar pop band called The Refreshments, which released a few singles and one album during the 1990s. Indie critics highly acclaimed The Refreshments attracted international attention and they made mini tour with UK indie band Mega City Four. The Refreshments broke up during the recording sessions of their second album. After a few years of musical separation this characteristic songwriter duo reunited in the form of <b>The</b> <b>Phonies.</b> <b>The</b> band developed a more organic musical style as they drifted away from the sound of power pop, helping to develop the characteristic rock sound which drew its strength from the 70's psychedelia and musical influences such as The Bevis Frond, Roky Erickson and Kevin Ayers. Stenman's lyrics are known for being whimsical and somewhat cryptic. Stenman's soul-searching and intense vocals combined to Lehtomaa's sense of the style and melody forms the core of <b>The</b> <b>Phonies</b> music.|$|R

5|$|Following the pagoda raids, the United States {{terminated}} {{funding to}} Tung's men {{because they were}} used as a political tool rather than against the communists. Along with Diệm and Nhu, Tung was assassinated during the November 1963 coup. Nhu and Tung had been preparing a fake coup and counter-coup {{in order to give}} a false demonstration of the regime's strength. However, the pair were unaware that General Tôn Thất Đính, who was planning <b>the</b> <b>phony</b> operation, was involved in the real coup plot. Đính tricked Tung into sending his men into the countryside, leaving the regime in Saigon without the protection of the special forces. This led to the easy overthrow of the regime.|$|E
5|$|Sterling {{agrees to}} this, {{which results in}} a hectic car chase that frightens Sterling some, despite Burt's expert driving {{that allows him to}} achieve many Hollywood driving stunts. During this, Burt tells Sterling that he needs to stop {{thinking}} of Malory as just his mother and rather think of her as a person with emotional (and sexual) needs and that he should think about her happiness and not his. This seems to sway Sterling and at that point, Burt has been able to catch up to the ISIS agents and the Cubans and saves the ISIS agents. The then group drives back to a heartbroken Malory. Sterling apologizes for writing <b>the</b> <b>phony</b> letter and Burt takes Malory on their date to the movie premiere.|$|E

25|$|With <b>the</b> <b>Phony</b> War {{underway}} {{after the}} Polish Conquest, Lippstadt became a training airfield for new Bf 109 pilots (Lehrgeschwader 2).

After the eight month {{interlude}} of <b>the</b> <b>Phony</b> War, France and the Low Countries were quickly overrun by the Nazi German Blitzkrieg in the Battle of France in May 1940. This left the United Kingdom and British Empire fighting alone (or almost alone after the Italian attack on Greece that autumn), against Germany and Italy.|$|E
25|$|It {{appears that}} the French Air Force {{considered}} Juvincourt an auxiliary airfield and did not station any units or aircraft at the facility. After World War II broke out in September 1939, the Royal Air Force sent 16 Fairey Battles of 76 Wing, 142 Squadron to Proviseux (Berry-au-Bac), between 2–12 September 1939. The RAF aircraft, however, did not see any combat during <b>the</b> <b>Phony</b> War, and were moved on 12 September to Plivot.|$|E

[...] The film is most critical in its portrayal of the Mafia. According to Bakshi, [...] "I was incensed at all the hero worship of those guys in The Godfather; Pacino and Caan did such a great job of making you like them. [...] One thing that stunned me about The Godfather movie: here's a mother who gives birth to children, and her husband essentially gets all her sons killed. In Coonskin, she gets her revenge, but also gets shot. She turns into a butterfly and gets crushed. [...] These [...] guys don't give you any room." ...|$|R

Directed by Bruce Starr and an uncredited Ulli Lommel, {{it was written}} by Starr, Lommel and the original film's star, Suzanna Love, although the writing goes uncredited in the film. In Boogeyman 2, Lacey is approached by a group of Hollywood phonies to make a movie based on her experiences. Lacey travels to Hollywood, to the home of a film director (played by Ulli Lommel himself), where she brings along the last surviving haunted mirror shard {{from the end of the}} first movie as proof to her horrifying experiences. One by one, <b>the</b> <b>phonies</b> are killed by the mirror spirit who possesses the body of the director's manservent. Boogeyman 2 is padded with many flashback sequences from the first film.|$|R
25|$|The CIA's {{response}} was another distraction. To begin Operation Moonmark, the CIA {{arranged for the}} U.S. Air Force {{to use one of}} its C-130 Hercules to drop a BLU-82 bomb to blast a helicopter landing zone (HLZ). Several helicopters flew in, a team dropped into the HLZ long enough to scatter cigarette butts, old packing crates, and litter about to simulate an insertion, then were pulled out by the helicopters. For the next week, Air America Twin Otters overflew <b>the</b> <b>phony</b> HLZ dropping bogus parachutes and broadcasting helicopter racket. Thus the 15,000 lb (6,800 kilo) bomb served as a second diversion to the diversion.|$|E
500|$|The {{second act}} takes place a week later, when the movie's cast are {{attending}} a decadent party at Gloria's house.

They think she will find Wally so unacceptable that Chicky will seem good in comparison. Meanwhile, Gloria also wants to prove Wally is an unfit match for Betty, by seducing him {{to prove that he}} is unfaithful. She lures Wally to her bedroom suite on the pretense of renewing their relationship, without intending to follow through. She plans to tease him until Zeffie finds them there, but he is prepared for her plan and will not accept any delay; the act ends with him telling her that she must fulfill her [...] "marriage debt" [...] to him.|$|E

Gary Arnold, in The Washington Post, wrote, [...] "Manhattan has comic integrity in part because Allen is now making jokes {{at the expense of}} his own parochialism. There's no opportunity to heap condescending abuse on <b>the</b> <b>phonies</b> and sellouts decorating the Hollywood landscape. The result appears to be a more authentic and magnanimous comic perception of human vanity and foolhardiness". In his review for Newsweek magazine, Jack Kroll wrote, [...] "Allen's growth in every department is lovely to behold. He gets excellent performances from his cast. The increasing visual beauty of his films is part of their grace and sweetness, their balance between Allen's yearning romanticism and his tough eye for the fatuous and sentimental - a balance also expressed in his best screen play sic yet". In his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert, who gave the film three-and-a-half stars out of four, wrote, [...] "Diane Keaton gives us a fresh and nicely edged New York intellectual. And Mariel Hemingway deserves some kind of special award for what's in some ways the most difficult role in the film." [...] Ebert includes the film in his list of The Great Movies.|$|R
