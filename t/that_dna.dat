5|$|DNA {{exists in}} many {{possible}} conformations that include A-DNA, B-DNA, and Z-DNA forms, although, only B-DNA and Z-DNA have been directly observed in functional organisms. The conformation <b>that</b> <b>DNA</b> adopts {{depends on the}} hydration level, DNA sequence, the amount and direction of supercoiling, chemical modifications of the bases, the type and concentration of metal ions, {{and the presence of}} polyamines in solution.|$|E
5|$|Flies {{appear in}} popular culture in {{concepts}} such as fly-on-the-wall documentary-making in film and television production. The metaphoric name suggests that events are seen candidly, as a fly might see them. Flies have inspired the design of miniature flying robots. Steven Spielberg's 1993 film Jurassic Park relied on the idea <b>that</b> <b>DNA</b> could be preserved in the stomach contents of a blood-sucking fly fossilised in amber, though the mechanism has been discounted by scientists.|$|E

25|$|Mitochondrial DNA {{mutations}} occur frequently, due to {{the lack}} of the error checking capability <b>that</b> nuclear <b>DNA</b> has (see Mutation rate).

40|$|DNA {{extracted}} from Kaposi sarcoma biopsies was analyzed {{for the presence}} of hepatitis B viral (HBV) DNA sequences by Southern blot hybridization.

40|$|Secondary cancers are a {{formidable}} consequence {{of our present}} efforts to cure cancer. With an increasing armamen-tarium of genotoxic drugs <b>that</b> damage <b>DNA</b> in diverse ways, {{the use of these}} agents in combination, and the resultant lengthening of survival among many patients with neoplastic diseases, the secondary leukemias are a growing complication in the setting of therapy for numerous cancers. To date, the agents that have been associated with the induction of secondary leukemias are those <b>that</b> damage <b>DNA</b> directly, such as alkylat-ing agents, and those <b>that</b> damage <b>DNA</b> through interaction with other molecules, such as the nuclear enzyme topoisomerase II (topo-II), which affects DNA conformation and function (7).

5|$|Evidence was {{presented}} that Tabak had {{then tried to}} conceal the crime by disposing of her body. The court heard <b>that</b> <b>DNA</b> swabs taken from Yeates' body had provided a match with Tabak. Samples found behind the knees of her jeans indicated {{she may have been}} held by the legs as she was carried, while fibres suggested contact with Tabak's coat and car. Blood stains were found on a wall overlooking a quarry close to where Yeates was discovered. The prosecution also said that Tabak attempted to implicate Jefferies for the murder during the police investigation, and that in the days following Yeates' death, he had made internet searches for topics that included the length of time a body takes to decompose and the dates of refuse collections in the Clifton area.|$|E
5|$|In 2017, Douglas Stenton, {{director}} for heritage in the Nunavut territory in north eastern Canada, suggested that {{four sets of}} European human remains found could possibly be women. He initially suspected <b>that</b> <b>DNA</b> testing would not offer up anything more, but to his surprise they registered {{that there was no}} 'Y' chromosomal element to the DNA. Stenton acknowledged that women were known to have served in the Royal Navy in the 17th, 18th and early 19th centuries, but he also pointed out that {{it could be that the}} DNA had simply degraded as further tests proved ambiguous. Stenton also stated that whilst the probability of four disguised women aboard the two ships was very, very low; he could not rule it out completely.|$|E
5|$|In February 2015, {{a credit}} dispute between {{universal}} primer technology and DNA barcoding came to light. Verma has argued <b>that</b> <b>DNA</b> barcoding, a technique independently described by zoologist Paul D N Hebert in 2003, {{is essentially the}} same as universal primer technology (UPT) and that both utilize standardized, short stretch of DNA from mitochondrial genome, amplified using the specific universal primers, to assign the identity of an unknown biological sample to a particular species. Verma claimed that UPT was described earlier than DNA barcoding in his patents, and publication; therefore, it should be fairly credited. However, Hebert argued that he was not aware of UPT because its patents were not visible to the broader scientific community due to a substantial interval from its filing in 2001 to grant in 2006.|$|E

40|$|AbstractSequence-dependent DNA conformations of matrix {{attachment}} regions (MARs) {{available in}} a database were calculated using the wedge model, and compared with randomly chosen genes, promoters, enhancers and transposons. The MARs had a longer bent part and higher angle/helical turn than the other regions. It is known that some MAR sequences have A-tracts <b>that</b> cause <b>DNA</b> bending, and we also found many A-tracts in examined MARs. Furthermore, non-random and clustered distribution of A-tracts shown here gave {{further evidence of the}} importance of A-tracts for MAR conformations.

5|$|Given these {{properties}} of DNA damage and mutation, {{it can be}} seen <b>that</b> <b>DNA</b> damage is a special problem in non-dividing or slowly-dividing cells, where unrepaired damage will tend to accumulate over time. On the other hand, in rapidly-dividing cells, unrepaired DNA damage that does not kill the cell by blocking replication will tend to cause replication errors and thus mutation. The great majority of mutations that are not neutral in their effect are deleterious to a cell's survival. Thus, in a population of cells composing a tissue with replicating cells, mutant cells will tend to be lost. However, infrequent mutations that provide a survival advantage will tend to clonally expand at the expense of neighboring cells in the tissue. This advantage to the cell is disadvantageous to the whole organism, because such mutant cells can give rise to cancer. Thus, DNA damage in frequently dividing cells, because it gives rise to mutations, is a prominent cause of cancer. In contrast, DNA damage in infrequently-dividing cells is likely a prominent cause of aging.|$|E
5|$|To help clarify {{species and}} {{subspecies}} boundaries, {{and to establish}} whether morphology-based classifications were consistent with evolutionary relationships, the phylogenetic relationships within the genus Nycticebus have been investigated using DNA sequences derived from the mitochondrial markers D loop and cytochrome b. Although most of the recognized lineages of Nycticebus (including N.pygmaeus, N. menagensis and N.javanicus) were shown to be genetically distinct—the analysis suggested <b>that</b> <b>DNA</b> sequences from some individuals of N.coucang and N.bengalensis apparently share a closer evolutionary relationship with each other than with {{members of their own}} species. The authors suggest that this result may be explained by introgressive hybridization, as the tested individuals of these two taxa originated from a region of sympatry in southern Thailand; the precise origin of one of the N.coucang individuals was not known. This hypothesis was corroborated by a 2007 study that compared the variations in mitochondrial DNA sequences between N.bengalensis and N.coucang, and suggested that there has been gene flow between the two species.|$|E
