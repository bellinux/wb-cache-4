2500|$|Following the {{accession}} of Henry VI, the Lords {{in parliament}} {{decided that the}} dead King's brothers – John, Duke of Bedford and Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester – would have positions of importance {{in the government of}} England as the new King, Henry VI, was a baby on his accession. Bedford would rule as regent in France, whilst Gloucester would be chief councillor (not quite a full protector) [...] in England. Stafford became a member of this regency royal council on its formation. The first representative meeting of the council was held, with Stafford attending, in November 1422. He attended council assiduously for the next three years. By 1424, the rivalry between Gloucester, as Protector, and the Bishop of Winchester, Henry Beaufort, as the de facto head of council had become outright, frequent conflict. Although Stafford probably favoured the interests of Gloucester in the duke's struggle for supremacy over Beaufort in council, the young earl may also have been a moderating influence between them. For example, in October 1425, Stafford, together with the Archbishop of Canterbury and the Portuguese Duke of Coimbra, helped to negotiate an end to a burst of violence that had erupted in London between the followers of Gloucester and the Cardinal. However, in 1428, when Gloucester demanded an extension of his authority, Stafford was one of the councillors who personally signed an [...] "outspoken statement" [...] to the effect that Gloucester's position had been formulated six years earlier, and that in any case the King would attain his majority in <b>the</b> <b>not-too-distant</b> <b>future.</b> Stafford {{was also one of the}} lords who was chosen by the council to inform Beaufort (who had now been appointed a Cardinal) to absent himself from Windsor until it was decided if he could carry out his traditional duty of Prelate to the Order of the Garter now he had been promoted.|$|E

At {{the start of the}} 2006 season Gary Wilkinson was brought in as coach and the team finished in second place, qualifying for the play-offs for the right to join champions Dewsbury Rams in National League One. On 22 September 2006 they beat the Crusaders at the Don Valley Stadium to qualify for the Grand Final for a second time. In the Grand Final on 8 October they beat Swinton Lions 35-10 to be promoted to National League One. To the surprise of many Wilkinson resigned as head coach on 15 October 2006, citing personal reasons. National League One was seen as a springboard to a potential return to Super League, although this would be dependent on the RFL's continuation of the franchising or licensing system.
