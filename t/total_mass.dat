5|$|Double {{degenerate}} scenarios {{raise questions}} about the applicability of Type Ia supernovae as standard candles, since <b>total</b> <b>mass</b> of the two merging white dwarfs varies significantly, meaning luminosity also varies.|$|E

5|$|A second {{possible}} {{mechanism for}} triggering a TypeIa supernova is {{the merger of}} two white dwarfs whose combined mass exceeds the Chandrasekhar limit.

40|$|Introduction: Hereditary {{hemochromatosis}} {{features a}} dysregulated iron absorption leading to iron overload and organ damage. The regulation of <b>total</b> hemoglobin <b>mass</b> during depletion of iron deposits by therapeutic phlebotomy {{has not been}} studied. Case Presentation: The initial ferritin level of the 52 -year-old male subject was 1, 276 μg/l. Despite successful depletion of iron stores (ferritinmin: 53 μg/l) through phlebotomies, <b>total</b> hemoglobin <b>mass</b> stabilized at the pretherapy level. However, regeneration of <b>total</b> hemoglobin <b>mass</b> was accelerated (up to 10. 8 g/day). Conclusion: In this hemochromatosis patient, the <b>total</b> hemoglobin <b>mass</b> was not altered in the long term, but regeneration was accelerated, possibly due to elevated body iron content...|$|R

5|$|Although most white dwarfs {{are thought}} to be {{composed}} of carbon and oxygen, spectroscopy typically shows that their emitted light comes from an atmosphere which is observed to be either hydrogen or helium dominated. The dominant element is usually at least 1,000 times more abundant than all other elements. As explained by Schatzman in the 1940s, the high surface gravity is thought to cause this purity by gravitationally separating the atmosphere so that heavy elements are below and the lighter above., §5–6 This atmosphere, {{the only part of the}} white dwarf visible to us, is thought to be the top of an envelope which is a residue of the star's envelope in the AGB phase and may also contain material accreted from the interstellar medium. The envelope is believed to consist of a helium-rich layer with mass no more than 1/100 of the star's <b>total</b> <b>mass,</b> which, if the atmosphere is hydrogen-dominated, is overlain by a hydrogen-rich layer with mass approximately 1/10,000 of the stars <b>total</b> <b>mass.,</b> §4–5.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{measuring}} stellar motions {{within the}} Milky Way, SIM Lite was {{to measure the}} internal and average galactic motion {{of some of the}} neighboring galaxies near the Milky Way. The telescope's measurements were to be used in conjunction with other, currently available, data to provide astronomers with the first <b>total</b> <b>mass</b> measurements of individual galaxies. These numbers would enable scientists to estimate the spatial distribution of dark matter in the local group of galaxies, and by extension, throughout the universe.|$|E
5|$|In this phase, {{water vapor}} {{condenses}} on various nuclei {{present in the}} air, forming the cumulus cloud. This creates the characteristic flat-bottomed puffy shape associated with cumulus clouds. The height of the cloud (from its bottom to its top) depends on the temperature profile of the atmosphere {{and the presence of}} any inversions. During the convection, surrounding air is entrained (mixed) with the thermal and the <b>total</b> <b>mass</b> of the ascending air increases.|$|E

The proximal deposit, within the 1 -cm (1.5  ×  104  g/m 2) isopach, consists of 95  % of the <b>total</b> discharged <b>mass</b> (1.12  ×  106  t).

The <b>total</b> accumulated <b>mass</b> was measured during different pulmonary flows. The ventilation was kept at volume controlled ventilation with a small tidal volumes 6 – 8  l/kg, breathing frequency at 16, and PEEP at 2 (VCV 1).

The {{size of the}} dust in the rings varies, but the cross-sectional area is greatest for nonspherical particles of radius about 15 μm in all rings except the halo. The halo ring is probably dominated by submicrometre dust. The <b>total</b> <b>mass</b> of the ring system (including unresolved parent bodies) is poorly known, but is probably {{in the range of}} 1011to 1016kg.

40|$|Binary {{black holes}} with <b>total</b> <b>masses</b> between ~ 20 and 200 M_⊙ require {{numerical}} relativity {{to describe the}} detectable signal in ground-based, gravitational-wave detectors. The time–frequency properties of the signals suggest that both modeled, matched filter searches and unmodeled, burst searches can expect to detect high mass binary signals. This paper presents a comparison of a matched filter pipeline and two unmodeled burst pipelines on the inspiral, merger and ring-down phases of compact binary coalescence by evaluating the sensitivity to binaries with <b>total</b> <b>masses</b> between 25 and 100 M_⊙ at a fixed false alarm rate.

5|$|Most birds can fly, which distinguishes {{them from}} almost all other {{vertebrate}} classes. Flight {{is the primary}} means of locomotion for most bird species and is used for searching for food and for escaping from predators. Birds have various adaptations for flight, including a lightweight skeleton, two large flight muscles, the pectoralis (which accounts for 15% of the <b>total</b> <b>mass</b> of the bird) and the supracoracoideus, {{as well as a}} modified forelimb (wing) that serves as an aerofoil.|$|E
5|$|Note {{that the}} half-light radius {{includes}} {{stars in the}} outer part of the cluster that happen to lie {{along the line of}} sight, so theorists will also use the half-mass radius (r'm)—the radius from the core that contains half the <b>total</b> <b>mass</b> of the cluster. When the half-mass radius of a cluster is small relative to the overall size, it has a dense core. An example of this is Messier 3 (M3), which has an overall visible dimension of about 18 arc minutes, but a half-mass radius of only 1.12 arc minutes.|$|E

The upper limit on emissions within 100AU of this star is about 850mJy, at a wavelength of 850μm. This limits the <b>total</b> <b>mass</b> of fine dust around the star to less than 0.01% of the Earth's mass.

5|$|The Sun is {{the star}} {{at the center of}} the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with {{internal}} convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process. It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth.
