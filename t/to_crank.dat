25|$|While Babbage's {{original}} design placed the crank {{directly on the}} main shaft, it was later realized that the force required <b>to</b> <b>crank</b> the machine {{would have been too}} great for a human to handle comfortably. Therefore, the two models that were built incorporate a 4:1 reduction gear at the crank, and four revolutions of the crank are required to perform one full cycle.|$|E
25|$|Motion picture {{evidence}} from Lae suggests that an antenna mounted underneath the fuselage {{may have been}} torn off from the fuel-heavy Electra during taxi or takeoff from Lae's turf runway, though no antenna was reported found at Lae. Don Dwiggins, in his biography of Paul Mantz (who assisted Earhart and Noonan in their flight planning), noted that the aviators had cut off their long-wire antenna, due to the annoyance of having <b>to</b> <b>crank</b> {{it back into the}} aircraft after each use.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to {{a popular}} myth, the AMC V8 was not built by Ford or anyone else {{although}} it bears an uncanny resemblance to the later Buick V8 engines (400, 430, 455). It shares the same design employing a timing gear case that mounts both distributor and oil pump. It also shares the same oiling scheme employing a single passage to feed both cam and crank from the right lifter bank by tangentially intersecting the cam bore instead of two drilled passages, one from the cam <b>to</b> <b>crank</b> and another from the crank to the right lifter bank. Some electrical parts (starter and distributor) were shared with Fords, and some models used Motorcraft (Ford) carburetors, but {{the balance of the}} engine design is unique.|$|E

25|$|Stanger {{fell ill}} {{while he was}} aloft {{on one of his}} October sorties. He landed on a handy {{airfield}} and shut down his plane's engine before realizing he had landed on an Austro-Hungarian strip. His only chance to escape any enemy soldiers investigating the racket of an untimely landing was to restart his engine and fly away. The customary method for starting an engine was for a ground crew member to yank the propeller as a lever <b>to</b> <b>crank</b> the engine, while a pilot sat at the controls. Stanger's solution was to remove his boots and chock the landing gear tires with the footwear. He then cranked the prop, started the engine, circled about the rotating blades, clambered into the cockpit, and departed. The fate of the boots is unknown.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Midway is {{generally}} considered to be the turning point of the war in the Pacific. Before Midway, a small and fractional U.S. Navy faced an overwhelmingly larger and battle-hardened Japanese Combined Fleet. After Midway, although the Japanese still held a temporary advantage in vessels and planes, the U.S. Navy and the nation gained confidence and, most critically, time. The setback in the Japanese timetable to encircle the Pacific gave the U.S. industrial machine time <b>to</b> <b>crank</b> up war production, and ultimately, to turn the advantage on Japan in the production of ships, planes, guns, and all the other matériel of war. The Battle of Midway infused the U.S. Pacific Navy with confidence. And with this battle the American forces gained, and afterwards continued to gain, hard combat experience; so the Japanese lost that crucial advantage as well.|$|E

Simone Knox praised its visual style in her article Reading the Ungraspable Double-Codedness of [...] "The Simpsons". The episode itself has been described by some critics as a kind of self-imposed benchmark of the show itself, with writer Bill Keveney commenting, [...] "the show picks its own benchmarks, as it did in 1995". Knox referred to it as not simply a clip show, but a clip show [...] "that looks at the series with a sense of hyper-self-consciousness about its own textuality". DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said even though the episode is a clip show, it [...] "gussies up the concept with some interesting elements, and keeps repetitive material to a minimum. Instead, it offers lots of then-unseen footage as well as old snippets from The Tracey Ullman Show. It still feels like a cheap way <b>to</b> <b>crank</b> out a new episode, but it’s one of the better clip shows you’ll see." [...] Jennifer Malkowski of DVD Verdict gave the episode a B+ grade and commented, [...] "apart from the creative material, what really makes this [...] shine is the hilarious hosting by Troy McClure." [...] Dave Foster of DVD Times criticized the episode: [...] "Despite some interesting concepts such as a bored Troy McClure presenting to much amusement and the presence of deleted scenes and Tracey Ullman shorts amongst the clips, this is an episode that tries hard to find a hook but never quite manages, assuring it'll never make it into regular rotation on this viewer's watch." ...|$|E

2500|$|The group {{switched}} to MCA (US) and London (UK) records in late 1985, and {{began work on}} their next album, Think Visual. The record was released in 1986, but only reached number 81 on the Billboard charts. Critics were lukewarm towards it, {{and it did not}} receive significant radio play. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic.com later commented that the album [...] "represented an artistic dead end for the Kinks, as Ray Davies continued <b>to</b> <b>crank</b> out a series of competent, but undistinguished hard rockers." [...] Dave Davies contributed two songs to Think Visual, [...] "Rock 'n' Roll Cities" [...] and [...] "When You were a Child". Rock 'n' Roll Cities was chosen in the US as the lead single for Think Visual, and at its release it received a fair amount of play on mainstream rock radio.

[...] Goncalves {{also pointed out that}} the game featured occasional pop up and clipping. [...] Reviews were split across the releases in regards to the game's soundtrack. PALGN cited Bad Religion and The Offspring as a high point of the game, while Game Revolution felt that the tracks were repetitive. GameSpot reviewer Jeff Gerstmann felt that the soundtrack was subjective to personal preference, stating [...] "you'll either want <b>to</b> <b>crank</b> the volume up or turn the music all the way down." [...] In a review for the PC version's altered soundtrack, fellow GameSpot reviewer Andrew Park felt that the new music was fitting for the game. However, they criticized the PC version for frame rate issues and recommended the Dreamcast version instead.|$|E
2500|$|A Wizard, a True Star (1973), {{which was}} sequenced as a {{continuous}} medley, featured a wildly eclectic range of songs set in dazzling arrangements and production, with Rundgren experimenting with the synthesizer and exploiting virtually every studio effect and technique then available. Backing musicians included renowned horn players Michael Brecker and Randy Brecker, guitarist Rick Derringer and several other musicians, who subsequently joined the original incarnation of Utopia. Although it featured predominantly original material (including the anthemic [...] "Just One Victory", which became a concert favorite), the album set a pattern followed on subsequent solo albums, with Rundgren recording cover versions of his favorite songs – in this case, [...] "Never Never Land", from the Broadway musical version of Peter Pan, and a medley of soul classics, including a unique version of the Capitols' [...] "Cool Jerk" [...] played in the 7/8 time signature. The album was also notable for its extended running time – over 55minutes in length, compared to around 40–45minutes for a typical pop-rock LP of the period. This reflected Rundgren's skills as a mastering engineer, since this extended running time took the album close to the practical maximum for an LP. Due to the inherent physical limitations of the vinyl LP medium, on records with running times over 45minutes there is an unfavorable trade-off between duration and the audio quality and volume. On the album cover, packed with his handwritten notes, he advised listeners <b>to</b> <b>crank</b> up their Victrolas accordingly.|$|E
