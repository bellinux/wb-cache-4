5|$|Blending {{science fiction}} with film noir conventions, Strange Days explores themes such as racism, abuse of power, rape, and voyeurism. Although {{the story was}} {{conceived}} by Cameron around 1986, Bigelow found inspiration after incidents such as the Lorena Bobbitt trial and the 1992 Los Angeles riots that followed <b>the</b> <b>Rodney</b> <b>King</b> verdict. The film was shot entirely in the Greater Los Angeles Area {{over a period of}} 77 nights. The film's SQUID scenes, which offer a point-of-view shot (POV), required multi-faceted cameras and considerable technical preparation.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Smoking Man was an {{aspiring}} writer of espionage (and later, science-fiction) novels starring a fictional version of himself, Jack Colquitt, {{and based on}} his own secret activities, but all his drafts were rejected or altered by publishers who found them unrealistic and poorly written. This left him {{no choice but to}} continue working for the United States government. By 1991, the Smoking Man's power was pretty much absolute. He was in direct talks with Saddam Hussein and involved {{in one way or another}} on the Anita Hill-Clarence Thomas controversy, moving <b>the</b> <b>Rodney</b> <b>King</b> trial to Simi Valley, keeping the US government from interferring in the independence of Bosnia-Herzegovina, the Academy Awards nominations, keeping the Buffalo Bills from ever winning the Super Bowl, drugging the Soviet goalkeeper before the Miracle on Ice, and executing extraterrestrials that survived landing on American soil.|$|E
25|$|The Los Angeles riots of 1992, {{also known}} as <b>the</b> <b>Rodney</b> <b>King</b> {{uprising}} or <b>the</b> <b>Rodney</b> <b>King</b> riots, began on April 29, 1992 when a jury acquitted four LAPD police officers accused in the videotaped beating of an African American Rodney King following a high-speed car pursuit on March 3, 1991.|$|E

50|$|Though {{few people}} at first {{considered}} race {{an important factor}} in <b>the</b> case, including <b>Rodney</b> <b>King's</b> attorney, Steven Lerman, the Holliday videotape was at the time stirring deep resentment in Los Angeles, as well as other major cities in the United States. The officers' jury consisted of Ventura County residents: ten white, one Latino, one Asian. Lead prosecutor Terry White was African American. On April 29, 1992, the jury acquitted three of the officers but could not agree on one of the charges against Powell.|$|R

50|$|In 1992 <b>the</b> first <b>Rodney</b> King beating trial {{came to a}} close. The {{officers}} {{charged with}} using excessive force to arrest <b>Rodney</b> <b>king</b> were found not guilty. The city erupted in a spasm of violence. The city of Los Angeles was unable {{to cope with the}} rising level of anarchy in its streets, and requested assistance from both the state and federal governments. The US government immediately ordered the deployment of federal troops and law enforcement agencies to the embattled city. The BOP dispatched several of its SORTs to the area who helped maintain control of federal facilities in the area.|$|R
25|$|A {{subsequent}} {{test for the}} presence of PCP in <b>Rodney</b> <b>King's</b> body at <b>the</b> time of the arrest was negative. The incident was captured on a camcorder by local resident George Holliday from his apartment in the vicinity. The tape was roughly 12 minutes long. While the tape was presented during trial, some clips of the incident were not released to the public.|$|R
25|$|In {{the week}} before <b>the</b> <b>Rodney</b> <b>King</b> {{verdicts}} were reached, Los Angeles police chief Daryl Gates set aside $1 million for possible police overtime. Even so, {{two thirds of the}} LAPD's patrol captains were out of town in Ventura, California, {{on the first day of}} a three-day training seminar.|$|E

25|$|Reaction {{to police}} {{brutality}} {{resulted in the}} Watts riots of 1965 and again, after <b>the</b> <b>Rodney</b> <b>King</b> beating, in the Los Angeles riots of 1992. Charges of police brutality dogged the Department {{through the end of}} the 20th century. In the late 1990s, as a result of the Rampart scandal involving misconduct of 70 officers, the federal government was forced to intervene and assumed jurisdiction of the Department with a consent decree. Police reform has since been a major issue confronted by L.A.'s recent mayors.|$|E

25|$|On August 11, 1965, an African-American {{motorist}} {{was arrested}} for suspicion of drunk driving. A minor roadside argument broke out, and then escalated into a fight. The community reacted in outrage to allegations of police brutality that soon spread, and six days of looting and arson followed. Los Angeles police needed the support of nearly 4,000 members of the California Army National Guard to quell the riots, which resulted in 34 deaths and over $40 million in property damage. The riots were blamed principally on police racism. It was the city's worst unrest until <b>the</b> <b>Rodney</b> <b>King</b> riots of 1992.|$|E
25|$|Freed {{worked as}} an investigative {{journalist}} with The Los Angeles Times in the 1980s and 1990s. He spent time reporting on Operation Desert Storm with assignments in Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. Freed wrote {{a series of articles}} starting in 1990 that highlighted flaws in Los Angeles County's criminal justice system, including overcrowded county jails and poor enforcement of lesser crimes. This series made Freed a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize for Public Service. Freed shared the 1993 Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Reporting with fellow writers at the newspaper for reportage on <b>the</b> <b>Rodney</b> <b>King</b> riots in 1992.|$|E
25|$|The 1992 Los Angeles riots, {{also known}} as <b>the</b> <b>Rodney</b> <b>King</b> riots, the South Central riots, the 1992 Los Angeles civil disturbance, the 1992 Los Angeles civil unrest, and the Los Angeles uprising, were a series of riots, lootings, arsons, and civil {{disturbances}} that occurred in Los Angeles County, California in April and May 1992. The unrest began in South Central Los Angeles on April 29, after a trial jury acquitted four officers of the Los Angeles Police Department for usage of excessive force in the videotaped arrest and beating of Rodney King. It then spread throughout the Los Angeles metropolitan area as thousands of people rioted over a six-day period following {{the announcement of the}} verdict.|$|E

His most notable cases include defeating <b>Rodney</b> <b>King's</b> malpractice lawsuit against his lawyers stemming from the LAPD excessive force verdict, and as counsel for a Pasadena business who got in a contract dispute with Ellen DeGeneres dubbed by the media as [...] "Iggygate".|$|R
50|$|After leaving Parliament, Meurant {{was elected}} onto <b>the</b> <b>Rodney</b> District Council in 1998. However, {{his time with}} <b>the</b> <b>Rodney</b> District Council was short-lived: the entire council was {{dissolved}} by the Minister of Local Government after an acrimonious relationship between the general manager and Meurant culminated in a split within the council.|$|R
25|$|Discussion of {{the racial}} {{elements}} of the case continued long after the trial's end. Some polls and some commentators have concluded that many blacks, while having their doubts as to Simpson's innocence, were more inclined to be suspicious of the credibility and fairness of {{the police and the}} courts, and thus more likely to question the evidence. The LAPD had a history of abusing African Americans in the city, which was emphasized in <b>the</b> <b>Rodney</b> <b>King</b> case. After the civil trial verdict against Simpson, most whites surveyed said they believed justice had been served. Most blacks (75%) disagreed with the verdict and believed that it was racially motivated. An NBC poll taken in 2004 reported that, although 77% of 1,186 people sampled thought Simpson was guilty, only 27% of blacks in the sample believed so, compared to 87% of whites. The Simpson case continues to be assessed through the lens of race. In 2016, FiveThirtyEight reported that most black people now think O.J. was guilty.|$|E
25|$|All {{four of the}} {{officers}} involved have since quit or have been fired from the LAPD. Officer Theodore Briseno left the LAPD after being acquitted on federal charges. Officer Timothy Wind, who was also acquitted a second time, was fired after the appointment of Willie L. Williams as Chief of Police. Chief Williams' tenure was also short-lived. The Los Angeles Police Commission declined to renew his contract, citing Williams' failure to fulfill his mandate to create meaningful change in the department {{in the wake of}} <b>the</b> <b>Rodney</b> <b>King</b> disaster. Susan Clemmer, an officer who gave crucial testimony for the defense at the initial trial, committed suicide in July 2009 in the lobby of a Los Angeles Sheriff's Station. She rode in the ambulance with King and testified that he was laughing and spat blood on her uniform. She had remained in law enforcement and was a Sheriff's Detective {{at the time of her}} death.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the immediate trigger of <b>the</b> <b>Rodney</b> <b>King</b> verdicts, various other factors have been cited as causes of the unrest. In the years preceding the riots, several other highly controversial incidents involving alleged police brutality or other perceived injustices against minorities were intensely scrutizined {{by the media and}} activist groups. The fatal shooting of black teenager Latasha Harlins by Korean American shop-owner Soon Ja Du, during a scuffle after Du mistakenly assumed Harlins was trying to steal a small container of orange juice, came just 13 days after the beating of Rodney King. Du's sentence of 5 years probation and 400 hours of community service but no jail time was pointed to as a potential reason for the riots, particularly for the aggression rioters expressed toward Korean Americans. Publications such as Newsweek and Time suggested that the source of these racial antagonisms was derived from perceptions amongst blacks that Korean-American merchants were 'taking money out of their community' and refusing to hire blacks to work in their shops. According to this view, these tensions were subsequently intensified by Du's light sentence for manslaughter.|$|E

500|$|The second single, [...] "Shock to the System", {{which was}} {{inspired}} by the Los Angeles riots of 1992, received the first music video put into MTV rotation. As Idol explained for MTV News, he had originally created the song with an entirely different set of lyrics, but upon witnessing the riots on television he immediately rewrote and recorded them that day. Idol explained {{that he was trying to}} capture the political and economic conflict that had created the LA Riots. Idol further felt that the camcorder ‚Äì as displayed in the witnessing of <b>the</b> <b>Rodney</b> <b>King</b> beating ‚Äì was a [...] "potent way of conveying ideas" [...] and an important metaphor for technology used in rebellion.|$|E
500|$|Bigelow was {{motivated}} to start work on Strange Days shortly {{after a series}} of cultural incidents that occurred in the United States in the early nineties, such as the Lorena Bobbitt trial and the 1992 Los Angeles riots that followed <b>the</b> <b>Rodney</b> <b>King</b> verdict. Referring to the latter, she noted, [...] "I was involved in the downtown cleanup, and I was very moved by that experience. You got a palpable sense of the anger and frustration and economic disparity in which we live." [...] She also developed the character of Mace from Cameron's original script to make [...] "valuable connections between female victimisation and racial oppression." [...] Both Strange Days and Cameron's 1994 action film True Lies were part of a multimillion-dollar production deal between Lightstorm Entertainment and 20th Century Fox. However, the financing was unevenly divided between the two films, with Strange Days being initially budgeted at $30 million and True Lies at $70 million.|$|E
