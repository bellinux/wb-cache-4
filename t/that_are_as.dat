5|$|A {{conflict}} between the sexes of a species is seen in some species of ants with these reproducers apparently competing to produce offspring <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>as</b> closely related to them as possible. The most extreme form involves the production of clonal offspring. An extreme of sexual conflict is seen in Wasmannia auropunctata, where the queens produce diploid daughters by thelytokous parthenogenesis and males produce clones by a process whereby a diploid egg loses its maternal contribution to produce haploid males who are clones of the father.|$|E
5|$|Extant strepsirrhines have an epitheliochorial placenta, {{where the}} {{maternal}} blood {{does not come}} {{in direct contact with}} the fetal chorion like it does in the hemochorial placenta of haplorhines. The strepsirrhine uterus has two distinct chambers (bicornuate). Despite having similar gestation periods to comparably sized haplorhines, fetal growth rates are generally slower in strepsirrhines, which results in newborn offspring <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>as</b> little as one-third the size of haplorhine newborns. Extant strepsirrhines also have a lower basal metabolic rate, which elevates in females during gestation, putting greater demands on the mother.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{preclinical}} {{research with}} animal and human proteins, bupropion {{has been characterized}} as a weak norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI). It has also been found {{to act as a}} releasing agent of dopamine and norepinephrine (NDRA), similarly to other cathinones. However, when ingested orally by humans, bupropion is extensively converted in the body into several active metabolites with differing activities and influences on the effects of the drug during first-pass metabolism. These metabolites are present in much higher concentrations in the body compared to bupropion itself. The most important example is the major metabolite of bupropion, hydroxybupropion, a selective norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (and likely releasing agent) and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) antagonist that lacks significant dopaminergic actions, and which, with oral bupropion treatment, can reach area under the curve (AUC) plasma concentrations <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>as</b> much as 16–20times greater than those of bupropion itself. Hence, the effects of bupropion cannot be understood unless its metabolism is also considered.|$|E

5|$|Pettigrew State Park {{is home to}} one of {{the last}} stands of old-growth forest in eastern North Carolina. A forest of bay trees, sweetgum, pawpaw, persimmon, bald cypress and poplar are found on the {{northern}} shore of Lake Phelps. The cypress have a trunk diameter of up to tenfeet (3m) and the poplar have a trunk diameter of sixfeet (2m). There are vines <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>as</b> wide as an average man's leg and grow up the trees in excess of 130feet (40m). In the section of the park along the Scuppernong River, the Atlantic white cedar and other rare cedar trees have grown to rather large sizes.

In polyline drawings, the complexity of an edge may be measured by its number of bends, and many methods aim to provide drawings with few total bends or few bends per edge.

25|$|Cartilaginous {{fish have}} a {{cartilaginous}} skeleton. However, their ancestors were bony animals, {{and were the}} first fish to develop paired fins. Cartilaginous fish don't have swim bladders. Their skin is covered in placoid scales (dermal denticles) <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>as</b> rough as sandpaper. Because cartilaginous fish do not have bone marrow, the spleen and special tissue around the gonads produces red blood cells. Their tails can be asymmetric, with the upper lobe longer than the lower lobe. Some cartilaginous fishes possess an organ called Leydig's Organ which also produces red blood cells.|$|E

25|$|In the 1960s, {{the chaotic}} {{nature of the}} {{atmosphere}} was first observed and mathematically described by Edward Lorenz, founding the field of chaos theory.

Mathematical models used to predict the long term weather of the Earth (climate models), have been developed that have a resolution today <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>as</b> coarse as the older weather prediction models.

25|$|An {{alternative}} {{view point}} was argued in the 1970s and 1980s by Carl Sagan and Frank Drake, among others. It holds that Earth {{is a typical}} rocky planet in a typical planetary system, located in a non-exceptional region of a common barred-spiral galaxy. Given the principle of mediocrity (in the same vein as the Copernican principle), {{it is probable that}} the universe teems with complex life. Ward and Brownlee argue to the contrary: that planets, planetary systems, and galactic regions <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>as</b> friendly to complex life as are the Earth, the Solar System, and our region of the Milky Way are very rare.|$|E

25|$|Sumner's proof shows, more strongly, {{that in any}} {{connected}} claw-free graph one {{can find}} a pair of adjacent vertices the removal of which leaves the remaining graph connected. To show this, Sumner finds a pair of vertices u and v <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>as</b> far apart {{as possible in the}} graph, and chooses w to be a neighbor of v that is as far from u as possible; as he shows, neither v nor w can lie on any shortest path from any other node to u, so the removal of v and w leaves the remaining graph connected. Repeatedly removing matched pairs of vertices in this way forms a perfect matching in the given claw-free graph.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Sprat {{wrote his}} History of the Royal Society in 1667 and set forth, {{in a single}} document, the goals of {{empirical}} science ever after. He expressed grave suspicions of adjectives, nebulous terminology, and all language that might be subjective. He praised a spare, clean, and precise vocabulary for science and explanations <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>as</b> comprehensible as possible. In Sprat's account, the Royal Society explicitly rejected anything that seemed like scholasticism. For Sprat, as {{for a number of}} the founders of the Royal Society, science was Protestant: its reasons and explanations had to be comprehensible to all. There would be no priests in science, and anyone could reproduce the experiments and hear their lessons. Similarly, he emphasised the need for conciseness in description, as well as reproducibility of experiments.|$|E
