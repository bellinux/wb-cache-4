40|$|Background and purpose: Targetted {{adolescent}} {{health services}} (PKPR) at the South Kuta Health Center havebeen offered since 2007. However, these are rarely accessed (less than 5 visits per month) whereas adolescent healthincidents/concerns such as abortion, HIV/AIDS {{and drug use}} are reportedly increasing. This study aimed to determinethe predisposition, supporting and reinforcing factors of PKPR utilization. Methods: Study was qualitative and conducted among 27 students in four sessions of focus group discussions, as wellas in-depth interviews with four key informants. Data collected consisted of knowledge, attitudes and views ofparticipants on PKPR <b>facilities.</b> <b>Thematic</b> analysis was conducted to identify predisposition, supporting and enforcingPKPR utilization factors. Results: The study participants intimated that their knowledge about PKPR was low, although they recognised thebenefits of such a service. They also acknowledged {{that the quality of}} facilities/infrastructure were poor, the IECmaterial was interesting but the deliverance unclear and the attitude of providers unfriendly. Funds, inappropriateclinic hours and labor provided were minimal. Schools, health centers and the government health office stronglysupported PKPR activities and the role of peer counselors. School health programs also encouraged students to takeadvantage of PKPR. Conclusion: Local schools, health centers and the government health office were supportive of PKPR activities,however the student 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge about PKPR was low because coverage of PKPR was very limited.  ...|$|R
40|$|The NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) is a <b>thematic,</b> on-line {{research}} <b>facility</b> {{that supports}} scientists, educators, space missions, and observatories in planning, data analysis, discovery, and publication {{of research on}} extragalactic objects. NED’s ongoing mission {{is to provide a}} comprehensive and easy-to-use, multi-wavelength fusion of fundamental data for all known (cataloged and published) objects beyond the Milky Way. The contents and services span the entire spectrum from gamma rays through radio frequencies, and they are continuously updated to reflect the current literature and releases of large-scale sky survey catalogs. After a brief overview of NED’s primary features, we review current developments that are vastly extending the content and capabilities of NED for our modern era of research involving very large, multidimensional, multi-wavelength data sets {{in the context of an}} interoperable, global Virtual Observatory. We then illustrate how researchers can program various types of queries to NED and retrieve machine readable tabular output using modern programming/scripting languages, and review how developers around the world are integrating content from NED Web services into various applications. We close with a discussion of the challenges for managing increasingly large and diverse data sets while maintaining quality in NED operations, which are centered around the core activity of establishing cross-identifications and relating information from thousands of journal articles and catalogs containing observations of hundreds of millions of extragalactic objects and candidates...|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{index of}} entropy and {{catastrophe}} theory methods {{were used for}} demarcating groundwater potential in an arid region using weighted linear combination techniques in geographical information system (GIS) environment. A case study from Badra area {{in the eastern part}} of central of Iraq was analyzed and discussed. Six factors believed to have influence on groundwater occurrence namely elevation, slope, aquifer transmissivity and storativity, soil, and distance to fault were prepared as raster <b>thematic</b> layers to <b>facility</b> integration into GIS environment. The factors were chosen based on the availability of data and local conditions of the study area. Both techniques were used for computing weights and assigning ranks vital for applying weighted linear combination approach. The results of application of both modes indicated that the most influential groundwater occurrence factors were slope and elevation. The other factors have relatively smaller values of weights implying that these factors have a minor role in groundwater occurrence conditions. The groundwater potential index (GPI) values for both models were classified using natural break classification scheme into five categories: very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. For validation of generated GPI, the relative operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used. According to the obtained area under the curve, the catastrophe model with 78 % prediction accuracy was found to perform better than entropy model with 77 % prediction accuracy. The overall results indicated that both models have good capability for predicting groundwater potential zones...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the experiences of}} caregivers of children with asthma regarding implementation of an asthma education programme at a community health centre in the Western Cape. The study {{explored the}} experiences of caregivers living with and helping the young asthmatic child when asthma symptoms first appear; their views and experiences on implementation of the asthma education programme; and {{their understanding of the}} expectations of them as caregivers, based on the guidelines provided to them. An exploratory, descriptive, contextual design was employed. Caregivers of children with asthma participated in semi-structured interviews which were guided by use of an interview schedule containing open-ended questions. The sample was derived through purposive sampling of caregivers who attended the health <b>facility.</b> <b>Thematic</b> analysis of the data was conducted. The results showed that caregivers found the education programme useful, and they reported that it was offered at a level that was easy for them to understand. Caregivers suggested that the programme should continue because they learned something new every time they attended the asthma clinic at the community health centre. Practical demonstrations were found to be particularly useful. It was clear that caregivers were aware of what was expected of them and that the education programme has assisted them in their caregiver role, {{despite the fact that they}} still experience moments of fear when the child has an asthma attack.

40|$|Determining {{the ideal}} size for high schools {{has been the}} focus of many {{research}} studies and of much debate over the past half-century. During the 1960 s, there was a movement away from ever larger high schools to smaller, alternative schools; e. g., Sizer’s Coalition of Essential Schools, which focused on student-centered education (Semel & Sadovnik, 2008). Over the past decade, this movement has experienced a renewal, with the development of schools-within-schools (large high schools subdivided into several smaller schools operating simulta-neously in the same <b>facility),</b> <b>thematic</b> curricu-lum schools (Jaffe-Walter, 2008; Ready & Lee, 2008), and the Bill and Melinda Gates Founda-tion’s efforts to establish small high schools in urban areas (Semel & Sadovnik; Shear et al., 2008). Urban schools, particularly, have been strongly criticized for attempting to serve large student bodies, which depersonalizes the stu-dent learning experience and causes some stu-dents to feel marginalized and ignored (McQuillan, 2008). Partially, this debate is a consequence of population dynamics. Since 1940, the number of U. S. public schools has fallen by almost 70 percent, while the average school size has risen by 400 percent; during this period, urban growth has escalated greatly. As of 2004, ap-proximately half of all U. S. public high schools served more than 1, 500 students, with many urban high schools serving over 5, 000 students (Werblow & Duesbery, 2009, p. 14). However, in the decade following 1993, the number of high schools nearly doubled as small schools opened and large schools were reorganized into smaller schools (Iatarola, Schwartz, Stiefel, &...|$|R
40|$|Background: A {{number of}} {{developing}} countries have contracted out public health facilities to the Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) {{in order to improve}} service utilization. However, there is a paucity of in-depth qualitative information on barriers to access services as a result of contracting from service users’ perspective. The objective {{of this study was to}} explore perceived barriers to utilizing Maternal and Neonatal Health (MNH) services, in health facilities contracted out by government to NGO for service provision versus in those which are managed by government (non-contracted). Methods: A community-based qualitative exploratory study was conducted between April to September 2012 at two contracted-out and four matched non-contracted primary healthcare facilities in Thatta and Chitral, rural districts of Pakistan. Using semi-structured guide, the data were collected through thirty-six Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) conducted with mothers and their spouses in the catchment areas of selected <b>facilities.</b> <b>Thematic</b> analysis was performed using NVivo version 10. 0 in which themes and sub-themes emerged. Results: Key barriers reported in contracted sites included physical distance, user charges and familial influences. Whereas, poor functionality of health centres was the main barrier for non-contracted sites with other issues being comparatively less salient. Decision-making patterns for participants of both catchments were largely similar. Spouses and mother-in-laws particularly influenced the decision to utilize health facilities. Conclusion: Contracting out of health facility reduces supply side barriers to MNH services for the community served but distance, user charges and low awareness remain significant barriers. Contracting needs to be accompanied by measures for transportation in remote settings, oversight on user fee charges by contractor, and strong community-based behavior change strategies...|$|R
40|$|Background: Despite {{evidence}} {{showing that}} adolescent-friendly health services (AFSs) increase young people&#x 0027;s {{access to these}} services, health systems across the world are failing to integrate this approach. In Latin America, policies aimed at strengthening AFS abound. However, such services are offered only in {{a limited number of}} sites, and providers&#x 2019; attitudes and respect for confidentiality have not been addressed to a sufficient extent. Methods: The aim {{of this study was to}} explore the mechanisms that triggered the transformation of an &#x 2018;ordinary&#x 2019; health care facility into an AFS in Ecuador. For this purpose, a realist evaluation approach was used in order to analyse three well-functioning AFSs. Information was gathered at the national level and from each of the settings including: (i) statistical information and unpublished reports; (ii) in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with policy makers, health care providers, users and adolescents participating in youth organisations and (iii) observations at the health care <b>facilities.</b> <b>Thematic</b> analysis was carried out, driven by the realist evaluation approach, namely exploring the connections between mechanisms, contexts and outcomes. Results: The results highlighted that the development of the AFSs was mediated by four mechanisms: grounded self-confidence in trying new things, legitimacy, a transformative process and an integral approach to adolescents. Along this process, contextual factors at the national and institutional levels were further explored. Conclusion: The Ministry of Health of Ecuador, based on the New Guidelines for Comprehensive Care of Adolescent Health, has started the scaling up of AFSs. Our research points towards the need to recognise and incorporate these mechanisms as part of the implementation strategy from the very beginning of the process. Although contextually limited to Ecuador, many mechanisms and good practices in these AFS may be relevant to the Latin American setting and elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|Despite notable {{efforts to}} present nursing {{as a viable}} career for men, the {{profession}} remains predominately female, and the modest changes {{in the numbers of}} men has not kept pace with the increasing demand for nursing services. In contrast to professional nursing, men comprise the majority of direct care providers in the military health care as medics, hospital corpsmen, and medical technicians. These men receive training and patient care experiences that would seem valuable assets in nursing practice, yet nursing fails to attract them in large numbers. The purpose of this qualitative study was to describe what men, currently in military health care roles, think about nursing as a career option after military service. Focus group interviews were conducted with 27 men engaged in direct patient care duties at 3 military health care <b>facilities.</b> <b>Thematic</b> content analysis was used to identify concepts, patterns, and themes that emerged from transcripts of the narrative data. The pervasive theme derived from the analysis was that participants did not view nursing as an appealing career and perceived nurses as "overworked, underappreciated" for the education, responsibilities, duties, and liabilities they incur in the healthcare environment. They revealed a conflicted perception about nursing, respecting many qualities and attributes while dismissing other aspects of the occupation as unappealing. Secondly, informants indicated they already performed most of duties required for nursing practice, but lacked the credentials to employ these capabilities outside the military health care environment. Finally, the participants considered the obstacles presented by both military structure and schools of nursing policies as significant barriers to pursuing nursing as a career during and after military service. Exploring the experiences of men in nursing and teaching has significant implications for recruitment and retention in a profession with historically low numbers of men. The information gained from the investigation enhanced the understanding how men in military health care perceive nursing as a career option and suggested a number of actions to encourage men to consider nursing as a career option after military service.   Ph.

40|$|We {{analyzed}} {{qualitative and}} quantitative data from U. S. -based employees in 30 long-term care facilities. Analysis of semi-structured interviews from 154 managers informed quantitative analyses. Quantitative data include 1214 employees' scoring of their supervisors and their organizations on family supportiveness (individual scores and aggregated to facility level), and three outcomes: (1), care quality indicators assessed at facility level (n = 30) and collected monthly for six months after employees' data collection; (2), employees' dichotomous survey response on having additional off-site jobs; and (3), proportion of employees with additional jobs at each <b>facility.</b> <b>Thematic</b> analyses revealed that managers operate within the constraints of an industry that simultaneously: (a) employs low-wage employees with multiple work-family challenges, and (b) has firmly institutionalized goals of prioritizing quality of care and minimizing labor costs. Managers universally described providing work-family support and prioritizing care quality as antithetical to each other. Concerns surfaced that family-supportiveness encouraged employees to work additional jobs off-site, compromising care quality. Multivariable linear regression analysis of facility-level data revealed that higher family-supportive supervision was associated with significant decreases in residents' incidence of all pressure ulcers (− 2. 62 %) and other injuries (− 9. 79 %). Higher family-supportive organizational climate was associated with significant decreases in all falls (− 17. 94 %) and falls with injuries (− 7. 57 %). Managers' concerns about additional jobs were not entirely unwarranted: multivariable logistic regression of employee-level data revealed that among employees with children, having family-supportive supervision was associated with significantly higher likelihood of additional off-site jobs (RR 1. 46, 95 %CI 1. 08 – 1. 99), but family-supportive organizational climate was associated with lower likelihood (RR 0. 76, 95 %CI 0. 59 – 0. 99). However, proportion of workers with additional off-site jobs {{did not significantly predict}} care quality at facility levels. Although managers perceived providing work-family support and ensuring high care quality as conflicting goals, results suggest that family-supportiveness is associated with better care quality...|$|R
40|$|The NASA/IPAC Extragalactic Database (NED) is a <b>thematic,</b> web-based {{research}} <b>facility</b> in {{widespread use}} by scientists, educators, space missions, and observatory operations for observation planning, data analysis, discovery, and publication of research about objects beyond our Milky Way galaxy. NED is a portal into a systematic fusion {{of data from}} hundreds of sky surveys {{and tens of thousands}} of research publications. The contents and services span the entire electromagnetic spectrum from gamma rays through radio frequencies, and are continuously updated to reflect the current literature and releases of large-scale sky survey catalogs. NED has been on the Internet since 1990, growing in content, automation and services with the evolution of information technology. NED is the world‛s largest database of crossidentified extragalactic objects. As of December 2006, the system contains approximately 10 million objects and 15 million multi-wavelength cross-IDs. Over 4 thousand catalogs and published lists covering the entire electromagnetic spectrum have had their objects cross-identified or associated, with fundamental data parameters federated for convenient queries and retrieval. This chapter describes the interoperability of NED services with other components of the Virtual Observatory (VO). Section 1 is a brief overview of the primary NED web services. Section 2 provides a tutorial for using NED services currently available through the NVO Registry. The “name resolver” provides VO portals and related internet services with celestial coordinates for objects specified by catalog identifier (name); any alias can be queried because this service is based on the source cross-IDs established by NED. All major services have been updated to provide output in VOTable (XML) format that can be accessed directly from the NED web interface or using the NVO registry. These include access to images via SIAP, Cone- Search queries, and services providing fundamental, multi-wavelength extragalactic data such as positions, redshifts, photometry and spectral energy distributions (SEDs), and sizes (all with references and uncertainties when available). Section 3 summarizes the advantages of accessing the NED “name resolver” and other NED services via the web to replace the legacy “server mode” custom data structure previously available through a function library provided only in the C programming language. Section 4 illustrates visualization via VOPlot of an SED and the spatial distribution of sources from a NED All-Sky (By Parameters) query. Section 5 describes the new NED Spectral Archive, illustrating how VOTables are being used to standardize the data and metadata as well as the physical units of spectra made available by authors of journal articles and producers of major survey archives; quick-look spectral analysis through convenient interoperability with the SpecView (STScI) Java applet is also shown. Section 6 closes with a summary of the capabilities described herein, which greatly simplify interoperability of NED with other components of the VO, enabling new opportunities for discovery, visualization, and analysis of multiwavelength data...|$|R
