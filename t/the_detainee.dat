5|$|<b>The</b> <b>detainee</b> {{is also to}} be {{informed}} within 14 days {{of his or her}} right to make representations against the order to an advisory board, which is required to hear and consider the detainee's representations. Each advisory board is chaired by a Supreme Court judge appointed by the President, and has two other members appointed by the President in consultation with the Chief Justice. The board has the powers of a court to summon and examine witnesses, and to order that documents be produced. It evaluates the evidence and must make recommendations to the President concerning the matter within three months of the date of detention. When the advisory board recommends the release of <b>the</b> <b>detainee</b> against the Minister's decision, the President exercises personal discretion whether <b>the</b> <b>detainee</b> should be released. Before exercising his discretion, the President is required to consult the Council of Presidential Advisers.|$|E
5|$|After {{reviewing}} Hamdan's habeas petition, Judge James Robertson of the United States District Court for the District of Columbia {{ruled in}} the detainee's favor. He {{found that the}} United States could not hold a military commission unless it was first shown that <b>the</b> <b>detainee</b> was not a prisoner of war.|$|E
5|$|An {{order for}} review of {{detention}} directs someone holding {{a person in}} detention to produce <b>the</b> <b>detainee</b> before the High Court so that {{the legality of the}} detention can be established. The power of the Court to require that this be done is specifically mentioned in Article 9(2) of the Constitution of Singapore. While the other prerogative orders may only be applied for with the court's permission, an order for review of detention may be applied for without prior permission from the court.|$|E
5000|$|According to CBS Matthews it was [...] "appalling" [...] that camp {{doctors were}} sharing {{information}} from <b>the</b> <b>detainee's</b> medical records {{in order to}} aid interrogators to use <b>the</b> <b>detainee's</b> weaknesses against them.He also said that information from <b>the</b> <b>detainee's</b> medical files could give interrogators [...] "tremendous power".|$|R
50|$|Most of <b>the</b> <b>detainees</b> were ferried to the {{restriction}} camp by train {{and a few}} were ferried by a plane popularly known as Dakota (Douglas DC-3). <b>The</b> <b>detainees</b> would be under armed guard and always on iron legs.Life was not easy for <b>the</b> <b>detainees.</b> Their relatives could only visit them after getting clearance from the Special Branch of the Police in then capital Salisbury, now renamed Harare.|$|R
50|$|Over {{the next}} six weeks the DoD {{released}} 15 more portable document format files containing transcripts.Most of these transcripts do not contain <b>the</b> <b>detainees</b> names. However, almost all the transcripts bear <b>the</b> <b>detainee's</b> Guantanamo ID number on the lower right hand corner of each page, and on April 20, 2006, and on May 15, 2006, the DoD released lists of <b>the</b> <b>detainees,</b> with their associated detainee IDs.|$|R
5|$|Article 9(2) of the Constitution enshrines {{the right}} of persons who have been {{detained}} {{to apply to the}} High Court challenging the legality of their detention. The application is for an order for review of detention, which was formerly called a writ of habeas corpus. The Court is required to inquire into the complaint, and order <b>the</b> <b>detainee</b> to be produced before the Court and released unless it is satisfied that the detention is lawful.|$|E
5|$|Once an {{individual}} has been detained, there are administrative processes which the executive is required to follow under sections 9, 11 and 12 of the Act. <b>The</b> <b>detainee</b> is to be informed of the grounds of detention as soon as possible, unless their disclosure is against the national interest. He or she is to be served {{with a copy of}} the detention order as well as the grounds and allegations of fact on which the detention order was made.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{order of}} the Minister for Home Affairs may direct that an {{individual}} be detained {{for up to two}} years. This may be further extended by directions issued by the President for further periods of up to two years at a time. The Minister is empowered with discretion to suspend a detention order, but also has the authority to revoke the suspension at any time, which reactivates the detention order. Detention orders must be reviewed at least once every 12 months by an advisory board which thereafter makes its recommendation to the Minister. If an advisory board recommends the release of a detainee and the Minister disagrees, the President may exercise personal discretion to order the release. The requirement for regular reviews of detention orders does not apply to detainees who are not citizens. When a detention order is extended, the Minister is not required to provide <b>the</b> <b>detainee</b> with the grounds justifying the extension order or give <b>the</b> <b>detainee</b> an opportunity to appeal against the extension.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>detainees</b> {{defense had}} argued that {{testimony}} secured in Guantanamo {{could not be used}} in Kuwaiti courts, because <b>the</b> <b>detainees</b> and interrogators had not signed them. Furthermore, they {{had argued that}} the allegations the USA had directed at them were not violations of Kuwaiti law.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>detainees</b> held in {{this camp}} don hoods when {{transferred}} from the camp to other locations for their military commission or other purposes.Some of <b>the</b> <b>detainees,</b> who faced charges before the Guantanamo military commissions, had attorneys who were initially told {{that they could not}} interview their clients. The attorneys were told it would be a breach of the camp's security for them to know the camp's location. When attorneys Suzanne Lachelier and Richard Federico offered to wear the same hoods <b>the</b> <b>detainees</b> wore to visit the camp, they were eventually allowed to visit the camp without wearing blindfolds. They were transported to the camp in the same windowless van as <b>the</b> <b>detainees,</b> so they did not know the camp's location.|$|R
5000|$|The {{conditions}} under which <b>the</b> <b>detainees</b> were held came under scrutiny by the Singapore Assembly when {{it was revealed that}} <b>the</b> <b>detainees</b> were kept in [...] "solitary confinement until their interrogation had been completed" [...] while [...] "the interrogation process itself appeared to be unnecessarily protracted." [...] The extended length of interrogations also alarmed the British. In addition, in late May 1963, the British investigating team of Members of Parliament from the Labour Party, which included Fenner Brockway, questioned the manner in which <b>the</b> <b>detainees</b> were treated.|$|R
5|$|Psychiatry {{possesses}} {{an inherent}} capacity for abuse that {{is greater than}} {{in other areas of}} medicine. The diagnosis of mental disease can give the state license to detain persons against their will and insist upon therapy both in the interest of <b>the</b> <b>detainee</b> and in the broader interests of society. In addition, receiving a psychiatric diagnosis can in itself be regarded as oppressive. In a monolithic state, psychiatry can be used to bypass standard legal procedures for establishing guilt or innocence and allow political incarceration without the ordinary odium attaching to such political trials.|$|E

5000|$|Submitting writs of {{habeas corpus}} was made more {{difficult}} at first, because part of <b>the</b> Bush <b>detainee</b> policy {{was to keep the}} identity of the Guantanamo captives a secret. A writ has to be submitted by a [...] "next friend". Some of <b>the</b> <b>detainees</b> had family who would have authorized American lawyers to submit writs on their behalf, but they had no way of contacting them. Some of <b>the</b> <b>detainees</b> and their relatives are totally illiterate. Other detainees' families had no idea where they were, had no idea that they were in Guantanamo. Some of <b>the</b> <b>detainees</b> reported that they were punished for asking for legal assistance.|$|R
50|$|Several {{hundred of}} <b>the</b> <b>detainees</b> in Guantanamo had {{individual}} habeas corpus petitions filed on their behalf. When the lawyers {{working on the}} captives' behalf encountered difficulties with the Department of Defense over the captives' names, they filed this class action {{on behalf of all}} <b>the</b> <b>detainees.</b>|$|R

25|$|At {{the end of}} 2005, the United States Congress passed <b>the</b> <b>Detainee</b> Treatment Act, which {{explicitly}} {{states that}} all captives held by the United States are protected against torture.

25|$|Also, <b>the</b> <b>Detainee</b> Treatment Act's anti-torture {{provisions}} were {{modified by}} the Graham-Levin Amendment, which {{was attached to}} the $453-billion 2006 Defense Budget Bill. The Graham-Levin Amendment permits the Department of Defense to consider evidence obtained through torture of Guantanamo Bay detainees, and expands the prohibition of habeas corpus for redetainees, which subsequently leaves detainees no legal recourse if they are tortured.|$|E
