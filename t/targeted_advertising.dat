40|$|An {{important}} question that Þrms face in advertising is developing effective media strategy. Given {{the fragmentation of}} media (broadcast TV for example) and a multitude of new advertising media (the Internet, satellite shopping channels, and infomercials), Þrms {{have the ability to}} <b>target</b> <b>advertising</b> to speciÞc segments of consumers in a market. But the existing research on advertising does not analyze the <b>targeting</b> of <b>advertising.</b> This paper provides insight into the development of media strategy with a model that allows for the <b>targeting</b> of <b>advertising</b> to different groups of consumers in a market with competing Þrms. When Þrms can <b>target</b> <b>advertising</b> to speciÞc segments in the market, they advertise more to consumers that have a strong preference for their product than to comparison shoppers who are more ßexible. Advertising less to comparison shoppers who shop across products {{can be seen as a}} way for Þrms to endogenously create additional differentiation in the market. In addition, <b>targeting</b> makes <b>advertising</b> more effective by eliminating “wasted ” advertising to consumers who would not buy their product. Therefore the <b>targeting</b> of <b>advertising</b> increases equilibrium proÞts. Targeting can lead to lower advertising expenditures by reducing the wastage created by sending advertisin...|$|R

The marketing and trading possibilities offered by Smart TVs are sometimes summarized by the term t-commerce. Taken together, this bidirectional data flow means that smart TVs can be and are used for clandestine observation of the owners. Even in sets that are not configured off-the-shelf to do so, default security measures are often weak and will allow hackers to easily break into the TV.|$|E
25|$|Few social {{networks}} charge money for membership. In part, {{this may be}} because social networking is a relatively new service, and the value of using them has not been firmly established in customers' minds. Companies such as Myspace and Facebook sell online advertising on their site. Their business model is based upon large membership count, and charging for membership would be counterproductive. Some believe that the deeper information that the sites have on each user will allow much better <b>targeted</b> <b>advertising</b> than any other site can currently provide. In recent times, Apple has been critical of the Google and Facebook model, in which users are defined as product and a commodity, and their data being sold for marketing revenue. Social networks operate under an autonomous business model, in which a social network's members serve dual roles as both the suppliers and the consumers of content. This is in contrast to a traditional business model, where the suppliers and consumers are distinct agents. Revenue is typically gained in the autonomous business model via advertisements, but subscription-based revenue is possible when membership and content levels are sufficiently high.|$|E

In response to these claims, Microsoft reiterated that Kinect voice recognition and motion tracking can be disabled by users, that Kinect data cannot be used for advertising per its privacy policy, and that the console would not redistribute user-generated content without permission. In response to these pre-launch changes and a belief that Microsoft's decisions for the systems were in poor judgement, journalists and consumers jokingly gave Xbox One nicknames such as [...] "Xbox 180", in reference to the Xbox 360 and Microsoft's decision to reverse its controversial decisions, and [...] "Xbone", suggesting that the company was [...] "throwing a bone" [...] to consumers by making these changes.|$|E

2500|$|Prior to Xbox One's launch, privacy {{concerns}} were raised {{over the new}} Kinect; critics showed concerns the device {{could be used for}} surveillance, stemming from the originally announced requirements that Xbox One's Kinect be plugged in at all times, plus the initial always-on DRM system that required the console to be connected to the internet to ensure continued functionality. Privacy advocates contended that the increased amount of data which could be collected with the new Kinect (such as a person's eye movements, heart rate, and mood) could be used for <b>targeted</b> <b>advertising.</b> Reports also surfaced regarding recent Microsoft patents involving Kinect, such as a DRM system based on detecting the number of viewers in a room, and tracking viewing habits by awarding achievements for watching television programs and advertising. While Microsoft stated that its privacy policy [...] "prohibit the collection, storage, or use of Kinect data for the purpose of advertising", critics did not {{rule out the possibility that}} these policies could be changed prior to the release of the console. Concerns were also raised that the device could also record conversations, as its microphone remains active at all times. In response to the criticism, a Microsoft spokesperson stated that users are [...] "in control of when Kinect sensing is On, Off or Paused", will be provided with key privacy information and settings during the console's initial setup, and that user-generated content such as photos and videos [...] "will not leave your Xbox One without your explicit permission." [...] Microsoft ultimately decided to reverse its decision to require Kinect usage on Xbox One, but the console still shipped with the device upon its launch in November 2013.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013 a {{class action}} lawsuit was filed against Facebook alleging the company scanned user {{messages}} for web links, translating them to “likes” on the user’s Facebook profile. Data lifted from the private messages was then used for <b>targeted</b> <b>advertising,</b> the plaintiffs claimed. [...] "Facebook's practice of scanning the content of these messages violates the federal Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA {{also referred to as}} the Wiretap Act), as well as California's Invasion of Privacy Act (CIPA), and section 17200 of California's Business and Professions Code," [...] the plaintiffs said. This shows that once information is online it is no longer completely private. [...] It is an increasing risk because younger people are having easier internet access than ever before, therefore they put themselves in a position where it is all too easy for them to upload information, but they may not have the caution to consider how difficult it can be to take that information down once it is out in the open. [...] This is becoming a bigger issue now that so much of society interacts online which was not the case fifteen years ago. [...] In addition, because of the quickly evolving digital media arena, people's interpretation of privacy is evolving as well, and {{it is important to consider}} that when interacting online. [...] New forms of social networking and digital media such as Instagram and Snapchat may call for new guidelines regarding privacy. [...] What makes this difficult is the wide range of opinions surrounding the topic, so it is left mainly up to our judgement to respect other people's online privacy in some circumstances. [...] Sometimes it may be necessary to take extra precautions in situations where somebody else may have a tighter view on privacy ethics. [...] No matter the situation it is beneficial to know about the potential consequences and issues that can come from careless activity on social networks.|$|E
