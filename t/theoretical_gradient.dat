40|$|One of {{the major}} {{criteria}} for designing superconducting niobium resonant cavities is to minimize the peak surface electric and magnetic fields to maximize the achievable accelerating electric gradient. Even after addressing the extrinsic effects adequately, {{a large number of}} cavities perform below the <b>theoretical</b> <b>gradient</b> limit. The peak magnetic field for the first flux-line penetration in the superconducting state of niobium, which either severely degrades the cavity quality factor or results in complete thermal breakdown, is an important limitation. The flux-line penetration is known to depend on the microstructural properties of niobium which may get altered in the process of cavity fabrication. The most common technique of fabricating niobium cavities is to form their components using standard sheet metal techniques and join them by electron beam welding in vacuum. We present results of a study on the superconducting response through magnetization measurements in the electron beam welded region of niobium to understand the limitations (if any) posed by the welding in achieving the highest gradient. We also present and discuss results on the performance of niobium quarter wave resonators incorporating such electron beam welds in the high magnetic field region...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{a pair of}} transmit pre-coding (TPC) algorithms conceived for spatial modulation (SM) systems communicating over flat-fading multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels. In order to retain all the benefits of conventional SM, we design the TPC matrix to be diagonal and introduce two design criteria for optimizing {{the elements of the}} TPC matrix. Specifically, we first investigate a TPC design based on maximizing the minimum Euclidean distance dmin (max-dmin) between the SM signal points at the receiver side. A closed-form solution of the optimal max-dmin based TPC matrix is derived. Then, another TPC design algorithm is proposed for directly minimizing the bit error ratio (BER) upper bound of SM, which is capable of jointly optimizing the overall Euclidean distance between all received signal points. In the minimum BER (min- BER) based TPC algorithm, the <b>theoretical</b> <b>gradient</b> of the BER with respect to the diagonal TPC matrix is derived and a simplified iterative conjugate gradient (SCG) algorithm is invoked for TPC optimization. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed maxdmin based TPC algorithm is optimal in terms of the minimum distance. However, increasing dmin does not achieve a further BER improvement. We also confirm that the min-BER based TPC outperforms the maxdmin based TPC schemes in terms of the achievable BER performance...|$|E
40|$|The {{pressure}} gradient across coronary stenoses is measured routinely during angioplasty. Due to the finite {{size of the}} angioplasty catheter within the stenotic cross section, the remaining luminal area is further reduced and the transstenotic gradient may be overestimating the "true" pressure drop. This "true" {{pressure gradient}} can be approximated from the mean coronary blood flow and the stenosis geometry from theoretical models. Goal {{of this study was}} to assess the values and limitations of the in vivo measurements of the pressure gradient versus the calculated values. Therefore, flow in the great cardiac vein was measured in 13 patients before and/or after angioplasty of a proximal left anterior descending stenosis, not filled by collaterals. The Poiseuille and turbulent contributions to flow resistance were determined from stenosis geometry assessed by quantitative coronary angiography. A fourfold increase in the luminal area (from 0. 7 mm 2 pre- to 2. 8 mm 2 post angioplasty) was associated with a fourfold decrease in the in vivo measured transstenotic gradient (from 59 mm Hg pre- to 13 mm Hg post angioplasty). The occlusion area and the measured gradient were linearly correlated: gradient = 69 - 17 X occlusion area (r = 0. 76). However, as expected, the transstenotic gradient systematically overestimated the <b>theoretical</b> <b>gradient</b> calculated from the laws of fluid dynamics.

Furthermore, the sphaerosiderite meteoric N 18 O latitudinal gradient is significantly steeper and more depleted (5. 8 x [34 ‡N] to 13. 8 x [75 ‡N] lighter) than a predicted gradient for the warm mid-Cretaceous using modern empirical temperature^N 18 O precipitation relationships. We {{have suggested that}} the steeper and more depleted (relative to the modern <b>theoretical</b> <b>gradient)</b> meteoric sphaerosiderite N 18 O latitudinal gradient resulted from increased air mass rainout effects in coastal areas of the KWIB during the mid-Cretaceous.

The mass balance model tracks the evolving isotopic composition of an air mass and its precipitation, and is driven by latitudinal temperature gradients. Our simulations indicate that significant increases in Albian precipitation (34 ^ 52 %) and evaporation fluxes (76 ^ 96 %) are required to reproduce the difference between modern and Albian meteoric siderite N 18 O latitudinal gradients.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of producing directionally solidified eutectic alloy composites by edge-defined, film-fed growth (EFG) was carried out. The three eutectic alloys which were investigated were gamma + delta, gamma/gamma prime + delta, and a Co-base TaC alloy containing Cr and Ni. Investigations into the compatibility and wettability of these metals with various carbides, borides, nitrides, and oxides disclosed that compounds {{with the largest}} (negative) heats of formation were most stable but poorest wetting. Nitrides and carbides had suitable stability and low contact angles but capillary rise was observed only with carbides. Oxides would not give capillary rise but would probably fulfill the other wetting requirements of EFG. Tantalum carbide was selected {{for most of the}} experimental portion of the program based on its exhibiting spontaneous capillary rise and satisfactory slow rate of degradation in the liquid metals. Samples of all three alloys were grown by EFG with the major experimental effort restricted to gamma + delta and gamma/gamma prime + delta alloys. In the standard, uncooled EFG apparatus, the thermal gradient was inferred from the growth speed and was 150 to 200 C/cm. This value may be compared to typical gradients of less than 100 C/cm normally achieved in a standard Bridgman-type apparatus.

Superimposed upon this uniform gradient may be magnetic signals due {{to a variety of}} sources. These include crustal magnetization, the transient fluctuations arising external to the Earth and causing secondary induced fields within it; and, the focus of the present paper, magnetic signals arising from the motional induction of seawater moving in the steady main magnetic field of Earth. There are circumstances where theory predicts such motionally‐induced magnetic fields to be of order 102 nT, and to vary with depth in a way which {{is directly related to the}} velocity profile. Exploratory soundings of the magnetic field with depth have been made in the oceans around Australia, both to test these predictions, and to investigate the practicability of measuring such profiles. The magnetic field parameter observed has been that of the ‘total field’, which should sense the component of the ocean velocity which lies in the magnetic meridian.

40|$|The European XFEL and the International Linear Collider {{are based}} on superconductingrf cavities. In order to reach the <b>theoretical</b> <b>gradient</b> limits of the superconducting cavitiesit is {{necessary}} to increase the mechanical quality and chemical composition of the innersurface {{as well as to}} understand the reason for performance limitations. This work is basedon the diagnosis of over 100 XFEL and HiGrade cavities whose performance was limitedby several factors: eld emission on dust or surface defects, low-eld thermal breakdowncaused by the defects, Q-slope etc. It was found that some defects were produced during the mechanical production of thecavity and were not removed by electro-chemical polishing, a standard processing tech-nique of the inner cavity surface. On the other hand, some of the defects were producedduring the electro-chemical polishing process as the surface initially had imperfections orinclusions of foreign material. One of the opportunities to overcome the aforementioned drawbacks is to replace the" electro-chemical polishing process by mechanical centrifugal barrel polishing. Theparameters of the surface after each polishing step were studied using small samples, so-called coupons. An undersurface layer was investigated using metallographic techniquesand cross sectioning. The inuence of centrifugal polishing on the specic parameters ofa 9 -cell cavity (eld atness, eccentricity etc.) was investigated. As a result, a single-stepcentrifugal barrel polishing process followed by a standard " electropolishing wasproposed for industrial application. Although the performance-limiting mechanisms are understood in general, the origin ofthe quench of the cavity is often unclear. To determine the quench locations, a localisationtool for thermal breakdown using the sound" in superuid helium has been used. All components of this tool were improved to increase the accuracy of the measurements. A new program code for quench localisation calculating the path of the second-soundwave was developed. This allows the signals from all sensors to be used, regardlessof their position relative to the quench site. The new approach was validated usingadditional techniques such as a temperature mapping and an optical inspection of theinner cavity surface. Furthermore, a new multi-sensor for second-sound wave detection inthe helium vessel of a cavity was developed and successfully tested on a serial-productionXFEL cavity. The determined quench site location was conrmed by subsequent opticalinspection. The algorithm localises the quench without mode measurements i. e. thereis no need to dismount HOM-antennas which requires special procedures and must beperformed in a clean-room.

In {{a series of three}} papers we have tackled the problem and set a modern chemical evolution model.

In the second paper (Piovan et al., 2011 b) we have implemented the dust into the Padova chemical model and tested it against the observational data for the Solar Neighbourhood. In this paper we extend it to the whole Disk of the Milky Way (MW). The Disk is used as a laboratory to analyze the spatial and temporal behaviour of (i) several dust grain families with the aid of which we can describe the ISM, (ii) the abundances in the gas, dust, and total ISM of the elements present in the dust and (iii) the depletion of the same elements. The temporal evolution of the dust and gas across the Disk is calculated under the effect of radial flows and a central Bar. The gradients of the abundances of C, N, O, Mg, Si, S, Ca and Fe in gas and dust across the Disk are derived as a function of time.

There is experimental evidence that both types of constraints are subject to constraint ranking and show cumulativity and ganging up effects.

Moreover, simple eigenvalue relations can be derived between these sets and the spherical harmonic expansion of the potential. This theoretical development generally applies to any potential field. First, the analysis of Rummel and van Gelderen (1992) is adapted to the magnetic field case and then {{the elements of the}} magnetic gradient tensor are estimated by 2 years of Swarm data and grouped into Γ^(1) = {[∇B]_rθ,[∇B]_rφ} resp.

These results demonstrate the ability of multi-satellite missions such as Swarm, which cannot directly measure the radial gradient, to retrieve similar signal content by means of the horizontal gradients. Finally, lithospheric field models are derived using the gradient combinations Γ^(1) and Γ^(2) and compared with models derived from traditional vector and gradient data. The model resulting from Γ^(1) leads to a very similar, and in particular cases improved, model compared to models retrieved by using approximately three times more data, i.e., a full set of vector, North–South and East–West gradients.

Similar experiments dwuld also prove useful for exploring the effect ofenvironmental agents on the function of intestinal tissue. In the case of sugars, net absorption is accomplished via a mucosal, Na+-dependent concentrative transport system acting in sequence with a passive serosal system which does not require Na+. The serosal system limits the fuli gradient-forming capability of the muscosal system. Agents such as phloretin or cytochalasin B which inhibit serosal transport allow the celis to establish sugar gradients as high as 70 fold in contrast to 10 - 15 fold gradients observed for control cells. Seventy-fold sugar gradients cannot be explained in terms of the energy available in the electrochemical potential for Na+ if the Na+:sugar coupling stoichiometry is 1 : 1 as commonly assumed. New information indicates that the true Na+:sugar stoichiometry is in fact 2 : 1. Flow of two Na+ ions per sugar molecule down the transmembrane electrochemical potential for Na+ provides more than sufficient energy to account for observed 70 fold sugar gradients. If flow of sugar by other routes could be completely inhibited, <b>theoretical</b> sugar <b>gradients</b> as high as 400 could be achieved assuming that the cells maintain a membrane potential of- 36 mV as measured for itact tissue...|$|R
