5|$|Henry Ward Beecher (June 24, 1813 – March 8, 1887) was an American Congregationalist clergyman, social reformer, and speaker, {{known for}} his support of <b>the</b> <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>slavery,</b> his {{emphasis}} on God's love, and his 1875 adultery trial.|$|E
5|$|In 1833, Wilberforce's health {{declined}} {{further and}} {{he suffered a}} severe attack of influenza from which he never fully recovered. He made a final anti-slavery speech in April 1833 at a public meeting in Maidstone, Kent. The following month, the Whig government introduced the Bill for <b>the</b> <b>Abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>Slavery,</b> formally saluting Wilberforce in the process. On 26 July 1833, Wilberforce heard of government concessions that guaranteed {{the passing of the}} Bill for <b>the</b> <b>Abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>Slavery.</b> The following day he grew much weaker, and he died early on the morning of 29 July at his cousin's house in Cadogan Place, London.|$|E

5|$|The {{mayor of}} Bayamón mobilized 500 soldiers. The ringleaders and {{followers}} of the conspiracy were captured immediately. A total of 61 slaves were imprisoned in Bayamón and San Juan.

5|$|Abraham Lincoln (February 12, 1809– April 15, 1865) was an American statesman {{and lawyer}} {{who served as}} the 16th President of the United States from March 1861 until his {{assassination}} in April 1865. Lincoln led the United States through its Civil War—its bloodiest war and perhaps its greatest moral, constitutional, and political crisis. In doing so, he preserved the Union, paved the way to <b>the</b> <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>slavery,</b> strengthened the federal government, and modernized the economy.|$|E

5|$|John Wilkes Booth (May 10, 1838 – April 26, 1865) was an American {{actor and}} assassin, who murdered President Abraham Lincoln at Ford's Theatre in Washington, D.C. on April 14, 1865. Booth {{was a member}} of the {{prominent}} 19th-century Booth theatrical family from Maryland and, by the 1860s, was a well-known actor. He was also a Confederate sympathizer, vehement in his denunciation of Lincoln, and strongly opposed to <b>the</b> <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>slavery</b> in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Slavery in Greek antiquity {{has long}} been an object of apologetic {{discourse}} among Christians, who are typically awarded the merit of its collapse. From the 16th century the discourse became moralizing in nature. The existence of colonial slavery had significant impact on the debate, with some authors lending it civilizing merits and others denouncing its misdeeds. Thus Henri-Alexandre Wallon in 1847 published a History of Slavery in Antiquity among his works for <b>the</b> <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>slavery</b> in the French colonies.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} <b>the</b> <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>slavery</b> was felt quickly. When the Thirteenth Amendment became operational, {{the scope of}} Lincoln's 1863 Emancipation Proclamation was widened to include the entire nation. Although the {{majority}} of Kentucky's slaves had been emancipated, 65,000–100,000 people remained to be legally freed when the Amendment went into effect on December 18. In Delaware, where {{a large number of}} slaves had escaped during the war, nine hundred people became legally free.|$|E
50|$|In the 1820s Macaulay {{turned his}} {{attention}} towards securing <b>the</b> total <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>slavery</b> itself. He helped found the Society for the Mitigation and Gradual <b>Abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>Slavery</b> (later <b>the</b> Anti-Slavery Society) in 1823, and was editor of its publication, the Anti-Slavery Reporter. Through his incessant hard work and reasoned argument, he helped to {{lay the foundation for}} <b>the</b> eventual <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>slavery</b> throughout <b>the</b> British Empire in 1833.|$|R

5|$|Agriculture is the {{dominant}} source of income in the area surrounding Randolph, especially the cultivation of cotton. Corn, beans and peas were also cultivated during the last century. After <b>the</b> <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>slavery</b> in 1865, sharecropping was the primary means of income for low income families in the area. Mostly for the cultivation of cotton, land would be used by sharecroppers {{in return for a}} share of the crop to the landowner. Modern machines such as the cotton picker have made the manual cultivation obsolete over time as they took over the work from the hand laborers.|$|E
5|$|Anarchism as {{a social}} {{movement}} in Cuba held great influence with the working classes during the 19th and early 20th century. The movement was particularly strong following <b>the</b> <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>slavery</b> in 1886, until it was repressed first in 1925 by President Gerardo Machado, and finally by Fidel Castro's Marxist–Leninist government following the Cuban Revolution in the late 1950s. Cuban anarchism mainly {{took the form of}} anarcho-collectivism based on the works of Mikhail Bakunin and, later, anarcho-syndicalism. The Latin American labor and by extension the Cuban labor movement itself was at first more influenced by anarchism than Marxism.|$|E
5|$|He inaugurated {{his career}} as a {{legislator}} under Prince Ghica. On December 22, 1855, legislation he drafted with Petre Mavrogheni regarding <b>the</b> <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>slavery</b> was passed by the Boyar Divan. This involved the freeing of privately owned Roma slaves, as those owned by the state had been set free by Prince Sturdza in January 1844. Kogălniceanu claimed to have personally inspired the measure. Ghica was prompted to complete the process of liberation by the fate of Dincă, an educated Roma cook who had murdered his French wife and then killed himself after being made aware {{that he was not going}} to be set free by his Cantacuzino masters.|$|E

5|$|He {{was born}} in the Saxon duchy of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, to a family {{connected}} to many of Europe's ruling monarchs. At the age of 20, he married his first cousin, Queen Victoria; they had nine children. Initially he felt constrained by his role of consort, which did not afford him any power or responsibilities, but gradually developed a reputation for supporting many public causes, such as educational reform and <b>the</b> <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>slavery</b> worldwide, and was entrusted with running the Queen's household, office and estates. He was heavily involved with the organisation of the Great Exhibition of 1851, which was a resounding success.|$|E
5|$|However, Brazil's {{champion}} {{in the fight for}} <b>the</b> <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>slavery</b> was dying. While in Europe, the first symptoms of mouth cancer appeared. Rio Branco was a heavy smoker, and he would daily smoke up to thirty Cuban cigars specially imported for him from Havana. Until July 1880, he was still making appearances in Parliament to deliver speeches, but after that date he no longer attended. Rio Branco still kept a close watch on political developments, however, and continued to appear at meetings of the Council of State. He had already retired from teaching in 1877.|$|E
5|$|Independence, however, did {{initiate}} <b>the</b> <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>slavery</b> in Spanish America, as it {{was seen}} as part of the independence struggle, since many slaves had gained their manumission by joining the patriot armies. In areas where slavery was not a major source of labor (Mexico, Central America, Chile), emancipation occurred almost immediately after independence was achieved. In areas where slavery was a main labor source (Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Argentina), emancipation was carried out in steps over the next three decades, usually first with the creation of free-womb laws and programs for compensated emancipation. By the early 1850s, slavery had been abolished in the independent nations of Spanish America.|$|E
25|$|The {{society was}} founded in 1827, and its first {{president}} was the wealthy Maryland Catholic planter Charles Carroll of Carrollton, who was a substantial slaveholder. Although Carroll supported <b>the</b> gradual <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>slavery,</b> he did not free his own slaves, perhaps fearing {{that they might be}} rendered destitute by the difficulties of earning a living in the discriminatory society.

5|$|The monarchy fell at a {{point when}} it had reached its highest {{popularity}} among Brazilians, {{due in part to}} <b>the</b> <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>slavery</b> on 13 May 1888. Indifferent to the new heroes, such as Tiradentes, imposed by the new republican government, Brazilians remained attached to the popular Emperor whom they regarded as a hero. He continued {{to be thought of as}} a national symbol, the Father of the People personified. This view was even stronger among those of African descent, who equated the monarchy with freedom. The afro-Brazilians demonstrated their feeling of loyalty towards the monarch in subtle ways, such as by having the Imperial Crown tattooed on their bodies.|$|E
5|$|Throughout his career, Wilson {{was known}} for championing causes that were at times unpopular, {{including}} <b>the</b> <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>slavery</b> and workers' rights for both blacks and whites. Massachusetts politician George F. Hoar, {{who served in the}} United States House of Representatives while Wilson was a Senator, and later served in the Senate himself, believed Wilson to be the most skilled political organizer in the country. However, Wilson's reputation for personal integrity and principled politics was somewhat damaged late in his Senate career by his involvement in the Crédit Mobilier scandal.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his return}} from the war, Porto Alegre resumed his {{political}} career. He became an active advocate for <b>the</b> <b>abolition</b> <b>of</b> <b>slavery</b> and a patron {{in the fields of}} literature and science. His death came on 18 July 1875 while again serving in Parliament. He was highly esteemed until the downfall of the monarchy in 1889. Regarded as too closely associated with the fallen regime, Porto Alegre slipped into obscurity. His reputation was eventually rehabilitated to a certain degree by historians, some of whom consider him to be among Brazil's greatest military figures.|$|E
