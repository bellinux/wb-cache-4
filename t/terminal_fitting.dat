Contemporary skills and traditional craftswere used, informed directly from the archaeological evidence. This process of re-creation has brought these objects to life again, giving us insights into how they were made, experienced and used. This paper will present the collaborative processes involved in thelatest re-creation of a silver <b>terminal</b> <b>fitting</b> for a large drinkinghorn with researchers and curators Mhairi Maxwell and MartinGoldberg, and designer and maker Jennifer Gray. Digital designand modelling processes were blended with traditional hand-making techniques to re-create the silver zoomorphic fittingInspired by a 2 D image on an Early Medieval carved stone and contemporary Pictish silver metalwork. The final piece wasdisplayed as a ‘work in progress’ (illustrating its conception from 3 Dmodelling and printing through to the final silver cast object) in theNational Museum of Scotland’s ‘Creative Spirit: Revealing Early Medieval Scotland’ exhibition, from the 25 th of October 2013 to the 23 rd of February 2014 (Image 1). Our design-archaeology approach towards material culture allowsfor {{a new way to}} re-evaluate Early Medieval insular art. Jennifer Gray’s work connects the innovative and traditional methods of re-creation used by the Glenmorangie Research Project; there hasalways been a tension between authentic craft techniquesavailable to the Early Medieval people and new technologiesavailable to us today. In this paper, we will negotiate questionsthat arose of authenticity, transparency and creativity that our particular collaborative approach to recreation. The process of designing and making has added to our understanding of these types of fittings; highlighting the decisionsmade by the maker along the way, their aesthetic qualities and probable functional features of Pictish drinking horn fittings. This piece would not be possible without Jennifer’s experience of bothtraditional and current digital methods. This project demonstrated that new technological approaches can be blended naturally into a piece of work as a means of enhancing what’s gone before –tobring the past alive...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} the natural voltage balancing dynamics of a three phase flying capacitor converter when supplying an induction motor. The approach substitutes Double Fourier harmonic series for the PWM switching waveforms and the frequency response of the motor, to create a linear state space model of this type of load. The model requires the mid-frequency response (500 Hz - 20 kHz) of the induction motor impedance to be identified, and takes skin and proximity effects into account by adding parallel R-L networks to a standard motor model. Model parameters were measured by applying FFT analysis to variable frequency square waves injected into the motor <b>terminals,</b> and <b>fitting</b> parameter values to these measurements using a least squares minimisation method. From the analysis, {{it was found that the}} converter voltage balancing behavior degrades substantially at low motor speeds, and that a balance booster filter, as previously proposed, considerably improves the dynamic response. Experimental verification results using a scaled-down flying capacitor converter drive are included in the paper...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{literature}} {{contains many}} stories of how foreign aid affects economic growth. Aid raises growth {{in countries with}} good policies, or with difficult economic environ-ments, or outside the tropics, or on average but with diminishing returns. The diversity of the results suggests that many are fragile. Seven important aid-growth papers are tested for robustness, using 14 minimally arbitrary tests deriving mainly from differences among the studies themselves. This approach investigates the importance of potentially arbitrary specification choices while minimizing the arbitrariness in testing choices. All of the results appear fragile, especially to sample expansion. JEL Codes: F 35, O 23, O 40 In early 1981, economist Edward Leamer gave a lecture at the University of Toronto, in which he bemoaned the state of econometrics. Econometrics sought {{the status of a}} science, with regressions as its analog for the reproduci-ble experiments of chemistry or physics. Yet an essential part of econometric “experimentation ” was too often arbitrary, opaque, and unrepeatable. “The econometric art as it is practiced at the computer <b>terminal</b> involves <b>fitting</b> many, perhaps thousands, of statistical models [...] This search for a model i...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. —The Southern Hemisphere has {{traditionally}} been considered as having a fundamentally vicariant history. The common trans-Pacific disjunctions are usually explained by the sequential breakup of the supercontinent Gondwana during the last 165 million years, causing successive division of an ancestral biota. However, recent biogeographic studies, based on molecular estimates and more accurate paleogeographic reconstructions, indicate that dispersal {{may have been more}} important than traditionally assumed. We examined the relative roles played by vicariance and dispersal in shaping Southern Hemisphere biotas by analyzing a large data set of 54 animal and 19 plant phylogenies, including marsupials, ratites, and southern beeches (1, 393 <b>terminals).</b> Parsimony-based tree <b>fitting</b> in conjunction with permutation tests was used to examine to what extent Southern Hemisphere biogeographic patterns fit the breakup sequence of Gondwana and to identify concordant dispersal patterns. Consistent with other studies, the animal data are congruent with the geological sequence of Gondwana breakup: (Africa(New Zealand(southern South America, Australia))). Trans-Antarctic dispersal (Australia ↔ southern South America) is also significantly more frequent than any other dispersal event in animals, which may be explained by the long period of geological contact between Australia and South America via Antarctica. In contrast, the dominant pattern in plants, (southern South America(Australia, New Zealand)), is better explained by dispersal, particularly the prevalence of trans-Tasman dispersal between New Zealand and Australia. Our results also confirm the hybrid origin of the South American biota: there has been surprisingly little biotic exchange between the northern tropical and the souther...|$|R
