50|$|Because of its {{significant}} role in the transportation of organic anion molecules and recent association with multiple illnesses including Alzheimer's disease (AD), the ABCC1 protein has become a potential drug target. In ABBC1 knockout mice, β-amyloid clearance is much lower than in wild-type mice that expressed the gene.

40|$|A very {{important}} {{group of the}} derivatives of phenothiazine are termed the major tranquillizers. The introduction into clinical psychiatry by Delay and Deniker in 1952 of chlorpromazine and its analogues has revolutionized the treatment of psychotic conditions and of mental diseases in general. Although the phenothiazines {{have been subjected to}} extensive clinical tests, their chemical structural features have not so far been found to have a sufficiently constant association with pharmacological, psychological and clinical effects to develop a theory of their mode of action. The phenothiazines are divided into three groups according to the chemical nature of the side chain attached to the nitrogen atom:- (1), dimethylamino-propyl, (2), piperidine, and (3), piperazine radical. Chlorpromazine, pyscho-tropically potent, belonging to the first group, and <b>thiethylperazine,</b> with relatively little tranquillizing or sedative action, belonging to the third, were chosen for complete structural analyses and are reported in Sections B and C respectively. The original intention was to determine the structure of phenothiazine for comparative purposes, but information was received {{during the course of the}} present study that its structure had been solved. Crystal data on phenothiazine and on another derivative, chlorpromazine hydrochloride, form the subject of Section A. Chlorpromazine, one of the best known of the series, is 3 -chloro- 10 (3 ' dimethyl-amino-n-propyl) phenothiazine. It is the valuable drug Largactil used in general medicine (for relief of nausea and vomiting, and radiation sickness), psychiatry (to control schizophrenic or manic states), surgery and anaesthesia (to modify or prevent traumatic and haemorrhagic shock). The drug has a depressant action on the brain stem, with little or no action on the cerebral cortex or the spinal cord. (Colloquium, Paris, 1955; Buxton Hopkin, 1955; Courvoisier, Fournel, Ducrot, Kolsky & Koetschet, 1953; Takayanagi, 1964). <b>Thiethylperazine</b> (trade name Torecan) is 2 -ethylthio- 10 -[3 -(4 -methylpiperazine- 1 -yl) propyl] phenothiazine. It is valued mainly for its antiemetic properties and is used for the control of postoperative vomiting, vomiting associated with malignant disease, radiation therapy, etc. (Progress in Drug Research, 1963; Extra Pharmacopoeia, 1967). The study of the series has been undertaken with the eventual hope of correlating molecular structure with psycho-pharmacological properties. It seems likely that in seeking the precise mechanism of action of the drugs, the problems must be "viewed through the glasses of the submolecular". (Szent-Gyorgyi, 1960). Section D gives a brief description of the properties of the drugs and outlines a possible relation between the molecular structure and the action mechanism. Section A in abridged form has been published (Feil, Linck & McDowell, 1965, Nature) and condensed versions of Sections B and C have been submitted for publication to Acta Crystallographica (McDowell, Chlorpromazine, accepted Dec. 1968; McDowell, <b>Thiethylperazine,</b> accepted Sept. 1969).

40|$|Mixtures of {{pethidine}} 100 mg, atropine 0 - 6 mg and six phenothiazine derivatives {{were studied}} as premedication before minor operations carried out under methohexitone-nitrous oxide-oxygen anaesthesia. None {{proved to be}} ideal, but each had some advantage. Promazine and triflupromazine increased the hypnotic action of the analgesic and the incidence of hypotension. Perphenazine and <b>thiethylperazine</b> both markedly reduced the emetic effects attributable to pethidine but were not very good sedatives. Propiomazine in 20 -mg doses was a mild non-toxic hypnotic with a moderate anti-emetic action. A high incidence of restlessness marred the beneficial effects of promethazine 50 mg, but 25 and 10 mg were both very satisfactory adjuvants to pethidine. In the previous paper in this series Dundee et al. (1965) compared the effects of fourteen pheno-thiazine derivatives and two phenothiazine-like drugs when used as premedication for minor operations. None of these compounds could be recommended as the main pre-anaesthetic hypno...|$|E
40|$|In Alzheimer disease (AD), the {{intracerebral}} {{accumulation of}} amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides {{is a critical}} yet poorly understood process. Aβ clearance via the blood-brain barrier is reduced by approximately 30 % in AD patients, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. ABC transporters have been implicated in the regulation of Aβ levels in the brain. Using a mouse model of AD in which the animals were further genetically modified to lack specific ABC transporters, here we {{have shown that the}} transporter ABCC 1 has an important role in cerebral Aβ clearance and accumulation. Deficiency of ABCC 1 substantially increased cerebral Aβ levels without altering the expression of most enzymes that would favor the production of Aβ from the Aβ precursor protein. In contrast, activation of ABCC 1 using <b>thiethylperazine</b> (a drug approved by the FDA to relieve nausea and vomiting) markedly reduced Aβ load in a mouse model of AD expressing ABCC 1 but not in such mice lacking ABCC 1. Thus, by altering the temporal aggregation profile of Aβ, pharmacological activation of ABC transporters could impede the neurodegenerative cascade that culminates in the dementia of AD...|$|E
40|$|Fourteen {{phenothiazine}} derivatives and two phenothiazine-like {{drugs have}} been given in premedication under standard conditions, and sometimes at more than one dose level, to evaluate their desired and toxic effects. Their influence on the course of methohexi-tone-nitrous oxide-oxygen anaesthesia was observed, and emetic and other postoperative sequelae noted. Results were compared with those obtained with atropine and atropine plus pethidine. Drugs with dimethylaminopropyl side chains were the most powerful hypnotics but the sedative effect was spoiled by pre-operative restlessness with prome-thazine and triflupromazine, and this complication was also common in compounds with a piperazine side chain. Hypotension was the most frequent disadvantage of the phenothiazines and was of such severity as to curtail the use of several drugs. Propio-mazine (20 - 40 mg) and <b>thiethylperazine</b> (10 mg) were least toxic {{from this point of}} view. The incidence of excitatory phenomena with methohexitone 1. 6 mg/kg varied with the analgesic or antanalgesic action of the premedication. Emetic sequelae were infrequent but perphenazine 5 mg showed most promise as an anti-emetic. Oculogyric crises occurred frequently after 1. 2 - 2. 5 mg fluphenazine and were also seen afte...|$|E
40|$|A rapid {{screening}} method {{was developed for}} the determination of phenothiazines by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF-MS). In this method, α-cyano- 4 -hydroxy cinnamic acid (CHCA) {{was used as the}} matrix to assist the ionization of phenothiazines. The identification of 11 phenothiazines with heavy side chains was performed by their protonated molecular ions [M + H]+ at m/z = 340 – 447, and the quantification was achieved using triflupromazine at m/z = 353 as the internal standard (IS). The relative ionization efficiencies of 11 phenothiazines and IS on MALDI-TOF-MS were different from those on ESI-TSQ-MS, but the product ion spectra on MALDI-MS-MS were quite similar to those on ESI-MS-MS except in the case of flupentixol. The limit of detection was 0. 3 ng/ml with its quantification range of 1 – 50 ng/ml urine in the best case, and limit of detection was 5 ng/ml with its quantification range of 10 – 100 ng/ml urine in the worst case for 10 phenothiazines except <b>thiethylperazine.</b> Present method provides a simple and high throughput method for the screening of these phenothiazines using only 20 μl of urine.

40|$|Objective: To {{quantify}} the antiemetic efficacy and {{adverse effects of}} cannabis used for sickness induced chemotherapy. Design: Systematic review. Data sources: Systematic search (Medline, Embase, Cochrane library, bibliographies), any language, to August 2000. Studies: 30 randomised comparisons of cannabis with placebo or antiemetics from which dichotomous data on efficacy and harm were available (1366 patients). Oral nabilone, oral dronabinol (tetrahydrocannabinol), and intramuscular levonantradol were tested. No cannabis was smoked. Follow up lasted 24 hours. Results: Cannabinoids were more effective antiemetics than prochlorperazine, metoclopramide, chlorpromazine, <b>thiethylperazine,</b> haloperidol, domperidone, or alizapride: relative risk 1. 38 (95 % confidence interval 1. 18 to 1. 62), number needed to treat 6 for complete control of nausea; 1. 28 (1. 08 to 1. 51), NNT 8 for complete control of vomiting. Cannabinoids were not more effective in patients receiving very low or very high emetogenic chemotherapy. In crossover trials, patients preferred cannabinoids for future chemotherapy cycles: 2. 39 (2. 05 to 2. 78), NNT 3. Some potentially beneficial side effects occurred more often with cannabinoids: "high" 10. 6 (6. 86 to 16. 5), NNT 3; sedation or drowsiness 1. 66 (1. 46 to 1. 89); euphoria 12. 5 (3. 00 to 52. 1), NNT 7. Harmful side effects also occurred more often with cannabinoids: dizziness 2. 97 (2. 31 - 3. 83), NNT 3; dysphoria or depression 8. 06 (3. 38 - 19. 2), NNT 8; hallucinations 6. 10 (2. 41 - 15. 4), NNT 17; paranoia 8. 58 (6. 38 to 11. 5), NNT 20; and arterial hypotension 2. 23 (1. 75 to 2. 83), NNT 7. Patients given cannabinoids {{were more likely to}} withdraw due to side effects 4. 67 (3. 07 to 7. 09), NNT 11. Conclusions: In selected patients, the cannabinoids tested in these trials may be useful as mood enhancing adjuvants for controlling chemotherapy related sickness.

40|$|Intruduction: A cleft is {{a gap in}} a body {{structure}} that results from incomplete closing of a specific structure during development. Clefts {{that occur in the}} lip and palate (roof of the mouth) are called oral-facial clefts. These birth defects occur very early in fetal development. The causes of these birth defects are not well understood. Cleft lips and palates are caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Studies suggest that a number of genes, as well as environmental factors can cause oral-facial clefts. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the risks factors, incidence, causes and symptoms of oral facial clefts at the children hospitalized in the children’s ward in Stip. This researches offer a preventive possibility to reduce appearance of oral-facial clefts in newborn baby. Material and methods: After birth, cleft lip and palate were diagnosed by physical exam. The risks factors and special exposure of their mothers during pregnancy were assessed. Also, the incidence, causes and symptoms at the children with oral facial clefts were evaluated. Their parents did n’t have oral-facial clefts. Results: The results indicated that during past 10 year children with oral facial clefts were borned in series in the same or closer month in the year (in the summer and the autumn). Also, was find that every year increased the number of children with oral-facial clefts and they were not associated with other syndrome. Children with oral-facial clefts have special problems and complication like feeding difficulties, ear infections and hearing loss. Conclusion: The obtain results suggest that environmental factors, such as drugs (including several different anti-seizure drugs) and maternal smoking, are risk factors for appearance of oral-facial clefts. We concluded that seasonal causes (such as pesticide exposure); maternal diet and vitamin intake; retinoids, which are members of the vitamin A family; anticonvulsant drugs; alcohol; cigarette use; nitrate compounds; organic solvents; parental exposure to lead; as teratogens increase the possibility of clefting. An increased risk for isolated oral-facial clefts was found in cases born to mothers treated with amoxicillin, phenytoin, oxprenolol, and <b>thiethylperazine</b> during the second and third month of pregnancy, which is the critical period for during fetal development. ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{estimate}} {{the prevalence of}} important side effects in patients with malignant disease who were receiving high doses of morphine {{as part of their}} palliative treatment. DESIGN [...] Data on patients were collected over 12 months. SETTING [...] Two palliative care units in Western Australia. PATIENTS [...] 19 Patients with malignant disease who were receiving morphine either subcutaneously or orally as the main analgesic. 10 Patients receiving a total daily dose of morphine of at least 500 mg orally or 250 mg parenterally were enrolled in the study. The other 9 patients were enrolled after an important problem thought {{to be related to the}} morphine had been identified. All of the patients were taking drugs to supplement the treatment. INTERVENTIONS [...] The dose of morphine or route of administration, or both, was changed in three patients. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE [...] Determination of the prevalence of side effects in the patients. Assessment of the relation of any side effects with the supplemental drugs taken by the patients. MAIN RESULTS [...] Plasma morphine and electrolyte concentrations were measured and a full history taken for each patient. Thirteen of the 19 patients had an important side effect; 12 of them had myoclonus and one had hyperalgesia of the skin. Plasma morphine concentrations were similar in patients with and without myoclonus, ranging from 158 to 3465 nmol/l and 39 to 2821 nmol/l respectively. Eight of the patients with side effects were taking an antipsychotic drug concurrently compared with none of those without side effects. A greater proportion of patients with side effects were taking the antinauseant drug <b>thiethylperazine</b> (6 / 13 v 2 / 6) and at least one non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (10 / 13 v 2 / 6), whereas a smaller proportion were taking a glucocorticosteroid (3 / 13 v 4 / 6). The estimated prevalence of important side effects in the total population of patients receiving palliative treatment in the two units was 2. 7 - 3. 6 %. CONCLUSIONS [...] Myoclonus as a side effect of treatment with morphine is more likely to occur in patients taking antidepressant or antipsychotic drugs as antiemetics or as adjuvant agents or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs for additional analgesia. If a patient develops myoclonus the best approach may be to change the supplemental treatment...|$|E
