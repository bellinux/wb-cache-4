If someone joins as the second in their direct family to do so, they are put in the same house as their relative. There are inter-house competitions throughout the year (including rugby, hockey, reading, and chess) and <b>then</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the year the points awarded in each event throughout the year are added up, and the house with most points is awarded the Cock House Cup, which is the traditional name given in British public schools for the in-school competition cup.|$|E

The regiment came under 18 AA Bde and took up positions to defend the Nile Delta and Suez Canal zones, including Heliopolis airfield, which was raided on 1 August, the AA guns shooting down one aircraft.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, after the New Model Army had {{abandoned}} {{its attempt to}} relieve Taunton, Parliament's Committee of Both Kingdoms had directed Fairfax, its commander, to besiege Oxford, the King's wartime capital. Initially, Charles welcomed this move, as Fairfax {{would be unable to}} interfere with his move north. <b>Then</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of May he was told that Oxford was short of provisions and could not hold out long. To distract Fairfax, the Royalists stormed the Parliamentarian garrison at Leicester on 31 May. Having done so, Prince Rupert and the King's council reversed their former decision and marched south to relieve Oxford. They sent messages ordering Goring to rejoin them, but Goring refused to leave the West Country.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} Málaga, {{shaped by the}} city's {{location}} {{in the south of}} Spain on the western shore of the Mediterranean Sea, spans about 2,800 years, making Málaga one of the oldest cities in the world. The first inhabitants to settle the site may have been the Bastetani, an ancient Iberian tribe. The Phoenicians founded the colony of Malaka here about 770 BC, and from the 6th century BC it was under the hegemony of ancient Carthage in north Africa. From 218 BC the city was ruled by the Roman Republic and <b>then</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the 1st century during the reign of Domitian it was federated with the Roman Empire as Malaca (Latin). Thereafter it was governed under its own municipal code of law, the Lex Flavia Malacitana, which granted free-born persons the privileges of Roman citizenship.|$|E
25|$|But in 1963, with {{arthritis}} affecting his spinning and his schoolmastering duties increasing, he played only twice and in 1964 not at all. <b>Then,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the 1964 season, Stephenson, {{who had been}} injured for most of it, {{stepped down from the}} Somerset captaincy. Bill Alley, rumbustious Australian all-rounder, who had deputised as captain in Stephenson's absence in 1964, was not seen as a long-term captain, and Atkinson was released from school duties to take the job for 1965. He was an instant success: Somerset led the County Championship table in June 1965, an unaccustomed position, and though Atkinson's batting was unreliable– he averaged less than 15 runs per innings for the season– and his spin bowling days were over, he developed as a tight medium-paced bowler, taking 38 wickets at under 24 runs apiece and complementing Somerset's pace attack of Fred Rumsey and Ken Palmer.|$|E
25|$|Remey {{remained}} in the western Atlantic through 1955 and, {{in the spring of}} 1956, as tension in the eastern Mediterranean from Cyprus to Suez, again heightened, rejoined the 6th Fleet. From 31 March to 12 May, as British troops prepared to withdraw from Suez, she cruised the Red Sea-Persian Gulf areas. <b>Then,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the month, the destroyer returned to Newport for 5 months of type training and ASW evaluation exercises. In July, Egypt nationalized the Suez Canal. By the end of the month, financial retaliations had been imposed by western Europe. Despite various peace plans proposed in August and September, war broke out in late October. To the north, civil unrest continued in Cyprus, flared in Poland, and flamed through Hungary. On 6 November, Remey steamed back to the Mediterranean to assume patrol duties which continued until after Israeli forces withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula in late January 1957.|$|E

25|$|The {{judgment}} {{came just}} before full council elections were due in Lambeth, which had elections for every seat once every four years. If the councillors appealed and lost, {{they would be}} disqualified {{in the middle of}} the term, endangering Labour control of the council. The Lambeth Labour group decided (with seven dissenting) that it was better not to appeal, accept the disqualifications and select replacement candidates for the impending elections. After holding a special meeting to transfer running of the council up to the election to a special committee consisting of three Labour councillors who had not been surcharged (Janet Boston, and two had been elected in byelections after the rate was set), the councillors were disqualified on 30 March. The Transport and General Workers' Union ended financial support for the Liverpool and Lambeth councillors at the beginning of April, having spent £107,000 up to <b>then.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of July 1986, the surcharged Lambeth councillors were given 21 months to pay off the surcharges; they were to pay £5,000 per month between them.|$|E
25|$|The next year, on 15 March 1813, Lhéritier was {{promoted}} {{to the rank of}} general of division and on 1 July was given the command of the 4th Heavy Cavalry Division of III Cavalry Corps. A few weeks later, on 8 August, he was given another command, that of several cavalry brigades from Édouard Jean Baptiste Milhaud's V bis Cavalry Corps, before having to take over the provisional command of the entire corps, during Milhaud's absence. During the summer campaign in Saxony, Lhéritier was noted above all for his actions at the Battle of Gieshübel on 22 August. Towards the end of the year, on 5 October, he was given the command of the 5th Heavy Cavalry division, which was entirely composed of dragoons. The 1814 campaign took place on French soil and Napoleon reorganised his army for the defense of the country's frontiers. As a result, on 5 January, General Lhéritier was given the command of the 6th Heavy Cavalry division, <b>then,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of January, the 4th Dragoon Division. He led his men into combat with distinction at virtually all the major battles of the campaign, including Brienne, La Rothière and Saint-Dizier.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Carlton swiftly {{fell from}} {{being one of}} the most {{successful}} clubs, both on-field and off-field, to one of the least successful. The club had been much slower than others to embrace the AFL Draft as a means for recruitment, so when its champion players from the 1990s began to retire in the early 2000s, on-field performances fell away quickly, and in 2002, the club won the wooden spoon for the first time in its VFL/AFL history; it was the last of the twelve Victorian clubs to win the wooden spoon. At the same time, the club was starting to struggle financially, due to unwise investments under John Elliott – most significantly, building a new grandstand at Princes Park during the 1990s, at a time when other clubs were finding it more profitable to play at the higher-capacity central venues. <b>Then,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of 2002, it was revealed that Carlton had been systematically cheating the league salary cap during the early 2000s. The scandal resulted in the loss of draft picks and a fine of $930,000, which exacerbated the club's poor on-field and off-field positions.|$|E

The decision has been made to put the ISPF on a permanent full-time footing and a new commander, Nathan Spring, has been appointed to accomplish this. Many of the series episodes deal with Spring's efforts to establish the Star Cops—he sets up a base of operations on the Moonbase, recruits new staff, roots out and dismisses corrupt officers and works to extend the Star Cops' reach first into the American space stations and <b>then,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the series, the far-flung reaches of the Mars colonies, all the while investigating whatever crimes occur along the way.|$|E
