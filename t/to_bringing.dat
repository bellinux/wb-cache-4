5|$|The Minneapolis Institute of Arts was {{established}} in 1883 by twenty-five citizens who were committed <b>to</b> <b>bringing</b> the fine arts into the Minneapolis community. The present building, a neoclassical structure, was designed by the firm of McKim, Mead and White and opened in 1915. It later received additions in 1974 by Kenzo Tange and in 2006 by Michael Graves.|$|E
5|$|After {{discovering}} that Tracy {{is still in}} contact with NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer), Jack realizes that their relationship is the key <b>to</b> <b>bringing</b> Tracy back to TGS. Jack, therefore, orders Kenneth to break off all contact with Tracy, although this fails because of Kenneth's relationship with Tracy. Seeing an opportunity, Jack states that since Kenneth's duties were primarily taking care of Tracy, and Tracy no longer works at NBC, Kenneth is no longer needed. Not wanting Kenneth to lose his job, Tracy agrees to return on the stipulation that Kenneth keeps his job.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Gabi Ben Harosh, {{partner of}} the Abergil brothers, was arrested in Los Angeles. After two years of house arrest, he signed a plea bargain for minor offenses, {{connected}} <b>to</b> <b>bringing</b> in foreign currency without a permit, {{and was sentenced to}} community service and judicial supervision for three years. In view of the Abergil brothers extradition to the US, {{he and his wife were}} arrested for violating immigration laws. It is believed that American authorities tried to apply pressure to Ben Harosh to incriminate the Abergil brothers but failed.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with the}} {{broadcasts}} of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and the Voice of America to Central and Eastern Europe, a major propaganda effort begun in 1949 was Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, dedicated <b>to</b> <b>bringing</b> about the peaceful {{demise of the}} communist system in the Eastern Bloc. Radio Free Europe attempted to achieve these goals by serving as a surrogate home radio station, {{an alternative to the}} controlled and party-dominated domestic press. Radio Free Europe was a product {{of some of the most}} prominent architects of America's early Cold War strategy, especially those who believed that the Cold War would eventually be fought by political rather than military means, such as George F. Kennan.|$|E
5|$|Because the Dreamcast had a {{much smaller}} user base than PlayStation platforms, Capcom knew the series could not survive on the platform. This led <b>to</b> <b>bringing</b> an {{extended}} cut, titled Code: Veronica X in the West and Code: Veronica Kanzenban in Japan, to the Dreamcast and PlayStation 2 in 2001. The extended cut was announced in November 2000. It has approximately 10 minutes of new cinematic sequences that reveal more about Wesker's involvement with Umbrella. The rest of the game remains mostly unchanged, although Capcom claimed they made some graphical enhancements. Capcom printed special DVDs of Wesker's Report for the North American PlayStation 2 release. They were sold on Capcom's website and given to customers who purchased the game at specialty retailers such as Electronics Boutique and GameStop.|$|E

5|$|In regards <b>to</b> <b>bringing</b> in P.A.Works as the {{animation}} studio, Toba had taken {{notice of the}} company from back when they provided in-between animation and production assistance for Fullmetal Alchemist (2003–4) and Darker than Black (2007), respectively; Aniplex helped produce both series. After watching just the first three episodes of P.A.Works' True Tears (2008), however, he was shocked at the high quality and immediately went to P.A.Works' studio in Toyama Prefecture {{to meet with the}} production staff in the hope that one day Aniplex could collaborate with them on a project together. The following week, Maeda brought up the subject of deciding on an animation studio for Angel Beats! and mentioned that he too had seen True Tears and had become interested in P.A.Works. Shortly after that, Toba formally made the proposal to P.A.Works to animate the project.|$|E
5|$|James {{achieved}} {{more success}} in foreign policy. Never having been {{at war with}} Spain, he devoted his efforts <b>to</b> <b>bringing</b> the long Anglo–Spanish War to an end, and a peace treaty was signed {{between the two countries}} in August 1604, thanks to skilled diplomacy on the part of Robert Cecil and Henry Howard, now Earl of Northampton, which James celebrated by hosting a great banquet. Freedom of worship for Catholics in England, however, continued to be a major objective of Spanish policy, causing constant dilemmas for James, distrusted abroad for repression of Catholics while at home being encouraged by the Privy Council to show even less tolerance towards them.|$|E
5|$|National policy {{relating}} to the Cold War interested Flanders greatly. He {{was concerned about the}} world-wide encroachment of Communism even without force of arms. He felt that President Truman was generally a good president, but was hampered by the Roosevelt legacy of appeasing the Soviets. He also felt that Truman's commitment <b>to</b> <b>bringing</b> the Nationalist and Communist Chinese factions together into an alliance was mistaken. He endorsed the Marshall Plan as a way to avoid Communist influence in Western Europe. However, he was critical of John Foster Dulles, Secretary of State, for mishandling opportunities to create friendly alignment with Egypt and India, countries which instead sided with the Soviet Union.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the {{outbreak}} of the American Civil War, White was commissioned a Captain of the Frontier Riflemen, which later became Company I of the 13th Virginia Volunteer Infantry Regiment, commanded by Colonel A. P. Hill in 1861. In 1864, he was commissioned as a Colonel in command of the 23rd Virginia Volunteer Cavalry Regiment and served in that capacity until the unit disbanded in April 1865. Following the war, White returned to Romney and practiced law with John Jeremiah Jacob. He devoted his efforts <b>to</b> <b>bringing</b> economic development to the South Branch Potomac River Valley, which had been desolated during the war. White was one of nine members to revive the Romney Literary Society following the war, and in 1870, the organization successfully secured the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind for Romney. He served three terms on the school's Board of Regents. White also established the South Branch Railway Company and was its president until 1877.|$|E
5|$|Spanish rule {{eventually}} {{contributed significantly}} <b>to</b> <b>bringing</b> political unity to the fragmented {{states of the}} archipelago. From 1565 to 1821, the Philippines was governed as a territory of the Mexico-based Viceroyalty of New Spain and then was administered directly from Madrid after the Mexican War of Independence. The Manila galleons, the largest wooden ships ever built, were constructed in Bicol and Cavite. The Manila galleons were accompanied with a large naval escort as it traveled to and from Manila and Acapulco. The galleons sailed {{once or twice a}} year, between the 16th and 19th centuries. The Manila Galleons brought with them goods, settlers and military reinforcements destined for the Philippines, from Latin America.|$|E
5|$|The bombardments also {{affected}} Japanese morale. Japanese civilians who experienced both air and naval bombardment found the naval attacks {{to be more}} terrifying due to their unpredictability and longer duration. Several of the industrial facilities that suffered little damage in bombardments incurred a significant loss in production due to absenteeism and reduced productivity. This {{was not the case}} for all facilities that were attacked though, and the morale among workers in two of the bombarded factories was reported to have increased. The appearance of Allied warships just off the coast also convinced many Japanese that the war had been lost. However, such attitudes did not contribute <b>to</b> <b>bringing</b> the war to an end as the views of civilians had little influence on the Japanese Government's decision to surrender.|$|E

5|$|X-Men is a 2000 American superhero film {{based on}} the Marvel Comics superhero team of the same name, {{distributed}} by 20th Century Fox. The film, directed by Bryan Singer and written by David Hayter, features an ensemble cast that includes Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Bruce Davison, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, Ray Park, Tyler Mane, and Anna Paquin. It depicts {{a world in which}} a small proportion of people are mutants, whose possession of superhuman powers makes them distrusted by normal humans. The film focuses on the mutants Wolverine and Rogue as they are brought into a conflict between two groups that have radically different approaches <b>to</b> <b>bringing</b> about the acceptance of mutant-kind: Professor Xavier's X-Men, and the Brotherhood of Mutants, led by Magneto.|$|E
5|$|After Maidan Castle, Wheeler {{turned his}} {{attention}} to France, where the archaeological investigation of Iron Age sites had lagged behind developments in Britain. There, he oversaw a series of surveys and excavations with the aid of Leslie Scott, beginning with a survey tour of Brittany in the winter of 1936–37. After this, Wheeler decided to excavate the oppidum at Camp d'Artus, near Huelgoat, Finistère. In addition <b>to</b> <b>bringing</b> many British archaeologists to work on the site, he hired six local Breton workmen to assist the project, coming to the belief that the oppidum had been erected by local Iron Age tribes to defend themselves from the Roman invasion led by Julius Caesar. Meanwhile, Scott had been placed in charge of an excavation at the smaller nearby hill fort of Kercaradec, near Quimper. In July 1939, the project focused its attention on Normandy, with excavations beginning at the Iron Age hill forts of Camp de Canada and Duclair. They were brought to an abrupt halt in September 1939 as the Second World War broke out in Europe, and the team evacuated back to Britain. Wheeler's excavation report, co-written with Katherine Richardson, was eventually published as Hill-forts of Northern France in 1957.|$|E
5|$|Rachel Beck {{wakes up}} in a shallow grave {{in the woods with}} rope burns on her neck and no memory of how she got there. She hitchhikes to her house in Manson, Wisconsin, where her friends and family do not {{immediately}} recognize her. Her Aunt Johnny, who is a mortician, examines her and determines that Rachel should not be alive. With the help of Rachel's friend Jet, the three decide to find Rachel's attacker. Meanwhile, two other women in Manson are killed; one by Lilith, and one by a 10-year-old girl named Zoe who is possessed by the demon Malus. When Rachel's group coincidentally meets Zoe, Lilith causes a car accident that injures Aunt Johnny and kills Jet. Rachel accompanies Jet's body to the morgue, where Jet comes back to life in a condition similar to Rachel. Lilith traps Zoe and confronts Malus, whom she summoned 300 years prior to take revenge on the city of Manson for killing her followers during a witch-hunt. He tells her he is close <b>to</b> <b>bringing</b> about the End times, which will also destroy Manson. During their conversation, Zoe slits her wrists and Malus leaves her body to find another host. Zoe is taken to a hospital, where her life is saved and Rachel and Jet find her.|$|E
