In this model, auxin is firstly redirected from parent primary root to the LRP via OsPIN 1 c, and then transported to the root tip via OsPIN 1 b, where the auxin is accumulated.

The tool changer has been automated and successfully tested in air and in the vacuum chamber of a Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). It brings flexibility to the micromanipulation cell and contributes to reduce the costs, the used space and experimentations time for micromanipulations in the SEM.
