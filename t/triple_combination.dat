25|$|The <b>triple</b> <b>combination</b> Fire Engine or “TRIPLE” (as it is {{commonly}} called) {{is the most common}} type of firefighting apparatus in Los Angeles. The term “triple combination” refers to the apparatus having three components; water tank, high capacity water pump, and hose. The triple can be found as a one-piece engine company or as two engines assigned to a Task Force station. The “Triples” used by the LAFD have several parallel main pumps of varying capacities; 1,000 gpm, 1250 gpm, 1500 gpm,and 2000 gpm at 150 psi. Depending upon the area served, this apparatus may carry a combination of any or all of the following sizes of hose; 31/2″, 21/2″, 13/4″, 11/2″ and 1″. The water tank carrying capacity ranges from 300 gallons to 500 gallons. These apparatus are staffed by four members, including a Captain 1 as the company commander. A number of triples in the LAFD are also Paramedic assessment companies – meaning they include a Paramedic as part of the crew.|$|E

40|$|An {{in vitro}} microdilution method was {{developed}} to assess double and <b>triple</b> <b>combinations</b> of antibiotics. Five antibiotics including ciprofloxacin, amikacin, ceftazidime, piperacillin, and imipenem were tested against 10 clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Each isolate was tested against ten double and nine <b>triple</b> <b>combinations</b> of the antibiotics. A 96 -well plate {{was used to test}} three antibiotics, each one alone and in double and <b>triple</b> <b>combinations</b> against each isolate. The minimum bacteriostatic and bactericidal concentrations in combination were determined with respect to the most potent antibiotic. An Interaction Code (IC) was generated for each combination, where a numerical value was designated based on the 2 -fold increase or decrease in the MICs with respect to the most potent antibiotic. The results of the combinations were verified by time-kill assay at constant concentrations of the antibiotics and in a chemostat. Only 13 % of the double combinations were synergistic, whereas 5 % showed antagonism. Forty-three percent of the <b>triple</b> <b>combinations</b> were synergistic with no antagonism observed, and 100 % synergism was observed in combination of ciprofloxacin, amikacin, and ceftazidime.

40|$|Objective-Vasculogenic {{progenitor}} cell therapy for ischemic diseases bears great potential but still requires further optimization for justifying its clinical application. Here, we investigated {{the effects of}} in vivo tissue engineering by combining vasculogenic progenitors with injectable scaffolds releasing controlled amounts of proangiogenic growth factors. Methods and Results-We produced biodegradable, injectable polylactic coglycolic acid-based scaffolds releasing single factors or combinations of vascular endothelial growth factor, hepatocyte growth factor, and angiopoietin- 1. Dual and <b>triple</b> <b>combinations</b> of scaffold-released growth factors were superior to single release. In murine hindlimb ischemia models, scaffolds releasing dual (vascular endothelial growth factor and hepatocyte growth factor) or <b>triple</b> <b>combinations</b> improved effects of cord blood-derived vasculogenic progenitors. Increased migration, homing, and incorporation of vasculogenic progenitors into the vasculature augmented capillary density, translating into improved blood perfusion. Most importantly, scaffold-released <b>triple</b> <b>combinations</b> including the vessel stabilizer angiopoietin- 1 enhanced the number of perivascular smooth muscle actin(+) vascular smooth muscle cells, indicating more efficient vessel stabilization. Conclusion-Vasculogenic {{progenitor cell}} therapy is significantly enhanced by in vivo tissue engineering providing a proangiogenic and provasculogenic growth factor-enriched microenvironment. Therefore, combined use of scaffold-released growth factors and cell therapy improves neovascularization in ischemic diseases and may translate into more pronounced clinical effect...|$|R

At 2 weeks angiogenesis was synergistically enhanced by VEGF 120 + FGF- 2 (P = 0. 019). FGF- 2 (P = 0. 008) and PDGF-BB (P = 0. 01) significantly increased connective tissue/inflammatory cell infiltrate (macrophages, pericytes, and preadipocytes) in double and <b>triple</b> <b>combinations</b> compared with control. At 6 weeks sequential addition of growth factors increased the percent volume of adipose tissue (P < 0. 0005, each main effect), with a synergistic increase in adipose tissue in combination treatments (P < 0. 0005). Groups containing 300 ng/ml of single growth factors produced significantly less adipose tissue than the <b>triple</b> growth factor <b>combination</b> (P < 0. 0005, VEGF 120 and PDGF-BB; P < 0. 001, FGF- 2).

40|$|Diabetic {{nephropathy}} (DN) {{is one of}} {{the most}} important causes of the end-stage renal failure and its prevalence is found to be increasing. The presence of hypertension and progressive proteinuria is among the important findings. In this study, the effects of double and <b>triple</b> <b>combinations</b> of trandolapril, telmisartan, and verapamil on proteinuria were investigated in diabetic patients with nephropathy. Seventy-eight patients (mean age: 56. 11 ± 11. 26 years; 47 females and 31 males) with overt proteinuria and DN were included in this study. The patients were divided into four groups: Group I (n: 18, trandolapril + telmisartan), Group II (n: 20, trando- lapril + verapamil), Group III (n: 20, trandolapril +telmisartan + verapamil), and Group IV (n: 20, telmisartan + verapamil). At the end of a three-month therapy, within and between group compa- risons were done about the effects of the use of double or <b>triple</b> drug <b>combinations</b> on proteinuria, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), electrolytes, serum albumin, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) - cholesterol, and HbA 1 C. There was no significant difference among groups in terms of age, gender, diabetes duration, body mass index, and retinopathy frequency. The decreases in protei- nuria and mean arterial blood pressure (MABP) were significant in all groups. The decrease in proteinuria was independent of the decrease in MABP [the reduction rate in proteinuria was 39 % (P < 0. 001) in Group I, 37 % (P < 0. 001) in Group II, 42 % (P < 0. 001) in Group III, and 43 % (P < 0. 001) in Group IV; the reduction rate in MABP was 10. 6 % (P < 0. 001) in Group I, 13. 7 % (P < 0. 001) in Group II, 17. 5 % (P < 0. 001) in Group III, and 15. 4 % (P < 0. 001) in Group IV]. Decrease in HbA 1 C (before and after treatment) was significant in Groups III and IV when com- pared to Groups I and II. Any adverse event, like hyperkalemia, was not observed. There was no significant difference among the groups in terms of GFR, LDL-cholesterol, albumin, and potassium. All the patients tolerated the drugs well. In conclusion, in patients with DN, both double or <b>triple</b> <b>combinations</b> of trandolapril, telmisartan and verapamil resulted in signi- ficant decreases in proteinuria and MABP. <b>Triple</b> <b>combinations</b> did not have any supe- riority over double combinations.

40|$|Hypertension is {{a serious}} public health concern with {{inadequate}} control of blood pressure (BP) worldwide. Contributing factors include low efficacy of drugs, underuse of combination therapies, irrational combinations, physicians' therapeutic inertia and poor adherence to treatment. Current guidelines recommend the use of initial (dual) combination therapy in high-risk patients for immediate BP response, better short- and long-term BP control, and continued/improved patient adherence. This article aims to review the existing evidence of triple-combination therapies with respect to efficacy, safety and adherence to treatment. It is estimated that three drugs are required to achieve BP control in approximately one-fourth to one-third of patients. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that <b>triple</b> <b>combinations</b> of amlodipine/valsartan/hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine/olmesartan/hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine/telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide produce greater BP reductions, with greater proportions of patients achieving BP control compared with dual therapies. Further evidence also demonstrates that triple-combination therapy is efficacious for moderate to severe hypertension, with substantial additional BP reduction over dual regimens. Both RCTs and post-marketing observational studies have shown consistent and comparable efficacy in both the general population and high-risk hypertensive subgroups. Triple therapies are generally well tolerated with adverse event profiles similar to dual regimens. In addition, fixed-dose combinations used as single pill improve patient adherence leading to better long-term BP control. Depending on regional circumstances, {{they may also be}} cost effective. Thus, single-pill <b>triple</b> <b>combinations</b> of different classes of drugs with complementary mechanisms of action help to treat patients to goal with improved efficacy and better adherence to treatment...|$|R
40|$|Expression of the α-amylase gene (amyE) of Bacillus subtilis {{is subject}} to CcpA (catabolite control protein A) -mediated catabolite repression, a global {{regulatory}} mechanism in Bacillus and other Gram-positive bacteria. To determine effectors of CcpA, we tested the ability of glycolytic metabolites, nucleotides, and cofactors to affect CcpA binding to the amyE operator, amyO. Those that stimulated the DNA-binding affinity of CcpA were tested for their effect on transcription. HPr-P (Ser- 46), proposed as an effector of CcpA, also was tested. In DNase I footprint assays, the affinity of CcpA for amyO was stimulated 2 -fold by fructose- 1, 6 -diphosphate (FDP), 1. 5 -fold by oxidized or reduced forms of NADP, and 10 -fold by HPr-P (Ser- 46). However, the <b>triple</b> <b>combinations,</b> CcpA/NADP/HPr-P (Ser- 46) and CcpA/FDP/HPr-P (Ser- 46) synergistically stimulated DNA-binding affinity by 120 - and 300 -fold, respectively. NADP added to CcpA specifically stimulated transcription inhibition of the amyE promoter by 120 -fold. CcpA combined with HPr (Ser- 46) inhibited transcription from the amyE promoter, but it also inhibited several control promoters. FDP did not stimulate transcription inhibition by CcpA nor did the <b>triple</b> <b>combinations.</b> The finding that NADP {{had little effect on}} CcpA DNA binding but increased the ability of CcpA to inhibit transcription suggests that catabolite repression is not simply caused by CcpA binding amyO but rather a result of interactions with the transcription machinery enhanced by NADP...|$|R
