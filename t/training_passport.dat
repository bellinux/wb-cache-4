40|$|The ENEN III project {{covers the}} structuring, organization, {{coordination}} {{and implementation of}} training schemes in cooperation with local, national and international training organizations, to provide training to professionals active in nuclear organizations or their contractors and sub-contractors. The training schemes provide a portfolio of courses, training sessions, seminars, and workshops for continuous learning for upgrading knowledge and developing skills. The training schemes allow individuals to acquire qualifications and skills, {{as required by the}} specific positions in the nuclear sector which will be documented in a <b>training</b> <b>passport.</b> The essence of such passport is to be recognized within the EU by the whole nuclear sector which provides mobility to the individual looking for employment and an EU wide recruitment field for the nuclear employers...|$|E
30|$|To {{permit a}} person entry to other countries, {{some form of}} {{identity}} verification is typically required. Although there is increasing interest in different biometric markers to support this entry-to-country process (including fingerprint scanning, retina scanning, iris recognition, finger geometry, voice recognition, DNA matching and gait analysis), the most prevalent means of identification is still from the verification of facial photo-ID. Indeed, although automated face recognition systems are increasingly in use for person identification at airports and borders, these systems operate {{under the supervision of}} human operators, who can intervene and override automated decisions (see FRONTEX, 2015). Whether using automated face recognition systems or direct verification of photo-ID by a human observer, this identification task typically relies on <b>trained</b> <b>passport</b> control specialists to perform this task accurately and quickly (White, Kemp, Jenkins, Matheson, & Burton, 2014).|$|R

40|$|In recent years, wide {{deployment}} of automatic face recognition systems {{has been accompanied}} by substantial gains in algorithm performance. However, benchmarking tests designed to evaluate these systems do not account for the errors of human operators, who are often an integral part of face recognition solutions in forensic and security settings. This causes a mismatch between evaluation tests and operational accuracy. We address this by measuring user performance in a face recognition system used to screen passport applications for identity fraud. Experiment 1 measured target detection accuracy in algorithm-generated 'candidate lists' selected from a large database of passport images. Accuracy was notably poorer than in previous studies of unfamiliar face matching: participants made over 50 % errors for adult target faces, and over 60 % when matching images of children. Experiment 2 then compared performance of student participants to <b>trained</b> <b>passport</b> officers-who use the system in their daily work-and found equivalent performance in these groups. Encouragingly, a group of highly trained and experienced "facial examiners" outperformed these groups by 20 percentage points. We conclude that human performance curtails accuracy of face recognition systems-potentially reducing benchmark estimates by 50 % in operational settings. Mere practise does not attenuate these limits, but superior performance of trained examiners suggests that recruitment and selection of human operators, in combination with effective training and mentorship, can improve the operational accuracy of face recognition systems...|$|R

Further to this, only 3 of these players {{may be on the}} ice simultaneously, with certain exceptions. The EU passport requirement is not enforced by the EPIHL per se, rather it {{is a product of the}} fact that UK Visas and Immigration only grants work permits to non-EU players who wish to sign for teams in the Elite Ice Hockey League. Despite the 4 imports dressed rule, it is not uncommon for some teams to sign a 5th import as 'backup' in case of injuries to an 'active' import.|$|R
40|$|The subject paper {{reviews and}} {{discusses}} {{some aspects of}} education and training {{in the field of}} nuclear safeguards and non-proliferation. This is largely inspired on the INMM ESARDA Working Group meeting in Aix-en-Provence in November 2011 and includes additional elements esp. w. r. t. outreach activities (i. e. capacity building efforts outside Europe). The paper will also refer to the NUSASET web-site, its potential and use. In addition, reference is made to the INMM Student Chapters in mechanism, which is a specific initiative to foster students to work and study in the area of Nuclear Materials Management In Aix-en-Provence a number of challenges and requirements in the subject field were identified : - Standardisation e. g. min. educational and training requirements - Analysis of the stakeholders and their needs e. g. <b>training</b> <b>passports</b> - Infrastructure, tools and approaches used for education and training - Knowledge management and mobility of information and students - Cross fertilization with other fields : export control & security In the mean-time, extra emphasis has been put on capacity building, including education outside Europe. Both for new-comers in the nuclear field and for experienced services, the nuclear safeguards and non-proliferation remains an area with typically little visibility and/or awareness. Dedicated efforts are thus ongoing to promote the education and training in this area e. g. in South-East Asia and elsewhere. Such capacity building efforts are supported under the Instrument for Stability, i. e. financed by DG DEVCO of the European Commission, and will in the future be enhanced further under the so-c alled CBRN Centres of Excellence initiative, in which e. g. the European Commission JRC plays a key role (e. g. in th e areas of RN security and export control) The experience gained in the regular ESARDA course on nuclear safeguards and non-proliferation, held annually at JRC-Ispra and hosted by the Nuclear Security Unit, and its "export" outside Europe, held in February 2013 in Malaysia, will also be reported upon.

5|$|The Intelligence Directorate {{was formed}} in 1985 to oversee special operations. It had four subcommittees: the Committee for Special Missions, the Foreign Intelligence Committee, the Counterespionage Committee and the Lebanon Committee. Led by Abd al-Rahman Isa, the longest-serving member of the ANO—Seale writes that Isa was unshaven and shabby, but charming and persuasive—the {{directorate}} maintained 30–40 people overseas who looked after the ANO's arms caches in various countries. It <b>trained</b> staff, arranged <b>passports</b> and visas, and reviewed security at airports and seaports.

50|$|Seven Iraqi commandos {{were killed}} in the raid and six were wounded. In {{estimated}} 84 insurgents were killed and the commandos said that they captured one Algerian. US Forces present however, were not able to confirm any captured enemy. After entering the camp, Iraqi commandos and U.S. intelligence officials found non-Iraqi <b>passports,</b> <b>training</b> publications, propaganda documents, weapons and ammunition. According to the papers found some of the insurgents were: Moroccans, Algerians, Sudanese, Saudi, Syrian and there was even one Egyptian. U.S. Army Combat Medic specialist Ray Michael Fuhrmann II (killed in action on 18 August 2005 in Samarra, Iraq) was awarded the Silver Star for his actions as the acting medic during the battle.|$|R

There are four daily train departures each direction, compared to two for the older service. The daily night train Helsinki-Moscow will continue like before. Visas are required for many foreign nationals, including Finns, to enter Russia and for Russians to enter Finland. Passport and customs checks are conducted on board the <b>trains.</b> Traditionally the <b>passport</b> and customs checks have delayed the trains by at least 30 minutes according to the time table (1 hour for 30 km Vyborg-the border).|$|R
30|$|These studies {{highlight}} the challenging {{nature of this}} identification task but are typically based on group performance. This is remarkable given that individual differences appear to provide an enormous source of error in face matching. Under best-case conditions, for example, individual performance ranges from seemingly at random (i.e., at around a 50 % chance level) to perfectly accurate (100 %; Burton et al., 2010), even in experiments comprising relatively small samples (e.g., Estudillo & Bindemann, 2014). These findings have been obtained with student participants, who were untrained in facial identification. However, {{a few studies have}} directly examined the performance of passport control officers. For example, White, Kemp, Jenkins, Matheson, and Burton (2014) investigated the identification accuracy of passport officers with a mean of 8 years working in the job, across a range of face-matching tasks including person-to-photo and photo-to-photo matching. As a group, the passport officers had high error rates when making matching decisions and throughout performed comparably to student participants who had received no training and had no professional experience in person identification. This indicates that the <b>training</b> of the <b>passport</b> officers was not effective in improving face-matching performance.|$|R
40|$|What keeps society together? According to John Searle is {{collective}} intentionality. Since Searle’s 1995 book, we {{find that}} idea at the centre of passionate discussions. More recently, in 2005, Maurizio Ferraris has suggested to substitute the notion of collective intentionality {{with the notion of}} “documentality”: the basis of social reality is the inscription of acts and the social objects that follow. Instead of the rule X counts as Y in C (which Searle himself acknowledged as flawed in his 2010 ’s book) we should have the rule Object = Inscribed Act. Social objects are the result of a social act (one that involves at least two persons or a person and a deputed machine), which is characterised by being registered on a piece of paper, in a computer file or even simply in the heads of persons. Social objects — such as marriages, promises, bets, parties, revolutions and economic crises — fill up our world more than do stones, tress and coconuts, and they are more important for us, given that a good part of our happiness or unhappiness depends on them. Yet we do not always take account of them, and even more rarely do we ask what they are made of, taking them seriously only when we lose our wallet or <b>train</b> ticket, our <b>passport</b> or credit card and we set to searching, paying, phoning, writing e-mails and queuing in all sorts of offices. It is only then that we understand (too late, alas) that social objects are made of inscriptions, whether on paper or on some magnetic support, or even (in the case of the promises we make every day) in people’s heads...|$|R
