The make-up effects used in Grace's dream and the scenes fifteen {{years into the future}} were done by Academy Award-winning make-up artists. Kohan and Mutchnick joined long-time {{director}} James Burrows on the set as filming began. The cast and crew tried to remain cheerful in front of the live audience between takes while the writers gathered in a room to rework lines for potentially larger laughs. However, [...] "there were a lot of snotty, tearful faces all around the set. When we got to the very, very last scene, everybody was just a mess. We started sobbing and hugging each other," [...] said Megan Mullally, who plays Karen. Eric McCormack, who portrays Will, commented that his saddest moment was [...] "the last time I stood in Will's kitchen.

500|$|Paul McCartney said {{he came up}} {{with the}} title [...] "The Long and Winding Road" [...] during one of his first visits to his {{property}} High Park Farm, near Campbeltown in Scotland, which he purchased in June 1966. The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road [...] "stretching up into the hills" [...] in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction his personal life was taking in the autumn of 1968, after he had separated from his fiancée Jane Asher, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: [...] "I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining {{it was going to be}} done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> found inspiration." ...|$|E
500|$|When Dewey Phillips first aired [...] "That's All Right" [...] on Memphis radio, many {{listeners}} who {{contacted the}} station by phone and telegram {{to ask for}} it again assumed that its singer was black. From {{the beginning of his}} national fame, Presley expressed respect for African American performers and their music, and disregard for the norms of segregation and racial prejudice then prevalent in the South. Interviewed in 1956, he recalled how in his childhood he would listen to blues musician Arthur Crudup—the originator of [...] "That's All Right"—"bang his box the way I do now, and I said if I ever got to <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> could feel all old Arthur felt, I'd be a music man like nobody ever saw." [...] The Memphis World, an African American newspaper, reported that Presley, [...] "the rock 'n' roll phenomenon", [...] "cracked Memphis's segregation laws" [...] by attending the local amusement park on what was designated as its [...] "colored night". Such statements and actions led Presley to be generally hailed in the black community during the early days of his stardom. By contrast, many white adults, according to Billboards Arnold Shaw, [...] "did not like him, and condemned him as depraved. Anti-negro prejudice doubtless figured in adult antagonism. Regardless of whether parents were aware of the Negro sexual origins of the phrase 'rock 'n' roll', Presley impressed them as the visual and aural embodiment of sex." ...|$|E

He completed Edmunds High School (now Sumter High School) class of 1947 in Sumter, South Carolina, where he once again lived with his mother. Recounting this period in his life, he once said, [...] "In <b>the</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> was a child, there were no artists {{and there was no}} art, so I really didn't know what that meant.

Dates in Australia, the Philippines, Costa Rica, Panama and Mexico soon followed. During {{an interview with}} OK!, Cyrus said she would not bring the tour to the United States due to not feeling comfortable to perform in the country. Many media outlets believed {{this was due to}} Cyrus' personal life. She commented: [...] "I just think right now America has gotten to a <b>place</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> don’t know if they want me to tour or not. Right now I just want to go to <b>the</b> <b>places</b> <b>where</b> <b>I</b> am getting <b>the</b> most love and Australia and South America have done that for me.

I don’t want to go anywhere <b>where</b> <b>I</b> don’t feel completely comfortable with it."Cyrus stated the tour would not be in the same vein as her previous efforts. She said her previous tour, Wonder World Tour, focused more on theatrics and costume changes. The singer wanted the show to focus on the music and letting the audience see a different side of her that is not portrayed on television. She said the show would feature an acoustic section, along with taking requests from the audience.|$|R
