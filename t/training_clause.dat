50|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Korean War fostered {{the creation of the}} Universal Military Training and Service Act of 1951 (Selective Service Act of 1948). This lowered the draft age from 19 to , increased active-duty service time from 21 to 24 months, and set the statutory term of military service at a minimum of eight years. Students attending a college or training program full-time could request an exemption, which was extended {{as long as they were}} students. A Universal Military <b>Training</b> <b>clause</b> was inserted that would have made all men obligated to perform 12 months of military service and training if the Act was amended by later legislation. Despite successive attempts over the next several years, however, such legislation was never passed.|$|E

Analysis of indenture terms indicates that relationships between end payments (freedom dues) and education and <b>training</b> <b>clauses</b> varied by region. In Boston, education and <b>training</b> <b>clauses</b> were associated negatively with freedom-dues clauses, but in Rhode Island and Charleston the relationship was positive. Variation in freedom dues to suit the needs of the master or overseer of the poor, without reference to the worker-child s own interests, resulted from the child s lack of advocacy during contract formation. ...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{presents}} a new resource light flexible method for clause alignment which combines the Gale-Church algorithm with internally collected textual information. The method does not resort to any pre-developed linguistic resources {{which makes it}} very appropriate for resource light clause alignment. We experiment {{with a combination of}} the method with the original Gale-Church algorithm (1993) applied for clause alignment. The performance of this flexible method, as it will be referred to hereafter, is measured over a specially designed test corpus. The clause alignment is explored as means to provide improved training data for the purposes of Statistical Machine Translation (SMT). A series of experiments with Moses demonstrate ways to modify the parallel resource and effects on translation quality: (1) baseline training with a Bulgarian-English parallel corpus aligned at sentence level; (2) training based on parallel <b>clause</b> pairs; (3) <b>training</b> with <b>clause</b> reordering, where clauses in each source language (SL) sentence are reordered according to order of the clauses in the target language (TL) sentence. Evaluation is based on BLEU score and shows small improvement when using the clause aligned corpus. ...|$|R
30|$|Due to {{previous}} investments in firm-specific human capital, employers are obviously {{not interested in}} laying off participants in on-the-job further training. This is particularly valid for well-trained employees. If employers had invested in these employees by giving them training leave and financial support, premature dismissal would mean the employers missed out on the gains, while being left with the costs, of previous investments in human capital (model 1). In reverse, in {{a case where the}} employer released employees so they could participate in further training, or paid for them to do so, the participants are less likely to give notice or terminate an employment contract by mutual agreement (models 2 and 3). The (expected) gains of previous further <b>training</b> or repayment <b>clauses</b> might keep the employees from leaving the company (prematurely). It could be assumed that this is particularly valid for firm-specific further training since generally and vocationally educated and trained employees show higher probabilities of quitting the employment relationship (model 2) or for bringing about the consensual suspension of the labour contract (model 3).|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedMediation {{has emerged as}} a preferred ADR method among commercial organizations involved in contract disputes. However, its use by the Navy has been rare. Mediation has shown to provide benefits to its commercial users such as: improved business relations, time and cost savings, flexibility and adaptability and superior control over outcomes. This thesis provides information on mediation and examines the differences and similarities between how commercial organizations and the Navy use mediation. The goal is to improve the Navy's use of mediation to resolve contract disputes. This research found, through survey results and the literature review, that as commercial organizations increase their use of mediation, they become familiar with the process and tend to reach higher levels of process and outcome satisfaction, making them more likely to continue its use. In order for the Navy to improve its use of mediation, it should use outside agencies to provide <b>training,</b> use contract <b>clauses</b> requiring its use and selecting mediators with adequate technical and legal background.

5000|$|One of {{the best}} known and ancient militias is the Swiss Armed Forces. Switzerland has long maintained, proportionally, the second largest {{military}} force in the world, with about half the proportional amount of reserve forces of the Israeli Defense Forces, a militia of some 33% of the total population. Article 58.1 of the April18, 1999, Federal Constitution of the Swiss Confederation (official, French version) provides that [...] "Switzerland has an army. It is primarily organised according to the principle of a militia." [...] However, under the country's militia system, professional soldiers constitute about 5 percent of military personnel. In 1995, the number of soldiers was reduced to 400,000 (including reservists, amounting to some 5.6% of the population) and again in 2004, to 200,000 (including 80,000 reservists, or 2.5% of the population). However, the Swiss Militia continues to consist of most of the adult male population (with voluntary participation by women) who are required to keep an assault rifle at home and to periodically engage in combat and marksmanship <b>training.</b> The militia <b>clauses</b> of the Swiss Federal Constitution are contained in Art. 59, where it is referred to as [...] "military service" [...] (Milit√§rdienst; service militaire; servizio militare; servetsch militar).|$|R
40|$|The German {{apprenticeship}} system {{has often been}} considered {{a role model for}} vocational education. But recent shortages in apprenticeship positions have led to a renewed debate about appropriate training policy. At present, there are renewed calls to introduce a training levy scheme, which would impose training levies on non-training firms and give additional support to training firms. Some economists favor this policy in order to counteract poaching of trained apprentices. Other economists oppose it strongly on the basis that positive spillovers do not occur. Still others suggest to loosen training regulations and allow for reimbursement <b>clauses</b> in <b>training</b> contracts. Surprisingly, a general economic analysis and comparison of these alternative instruments is still lacking. This work attempts to close this gap. It investigates whether poaching enables to derive positive spillovers from apprenticeship training, and if so, whether training policy could play a mitigating role. Following the recent training literature, we use a simple oligopsonistic labor market model with endogenous turnover. Such a setting allows us to explain why firms provide and (at least partially) finance general vocational training. Moreover, it demonstrates that a positive externality arises as competing firms benefit from vocational training through poaching. We then introduce alternative policy instruments into the model. In principle, the Pigouvian prescription of a perfect subsidy scheme financed by a non-distortionary tax could restore the social optimum. The proposed training levy scheme, however, is a particular scheme that links subsidies and levies. This paper demonstrates that it basically corresponds to a uniform subsidy on apprenticeship training that is financed by a distortionary tax on labor. We show that introducing this training levy scheme can entail ambiguous repercussions on general welfare even when transaction costs are excluded. Reimbursement clauses, in contrast, oblige the trainee to compensate for training when quitting the firm. They alter workers' outside options and thereby increase firms' wage-setting power. In this model, in opposition to earlier studies, we show that they do not affect training spillovers. Instead, they are identified as an implicit training loan.
