Michael Vaughan played some exquisite shots, bringing back memories of his performances against India and Australia in 2002 when he reached <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> rankings. It took a freakish dismissal to remove him, the ball getting caught in the trousers of the short leg fielder who then managed to grab it before it hit the ground.

25|$|Boehringer spirometers were {{selected}} above the competition after extensive testing by the American Medical Research Expedition to Everest.

After Boehringer’s success at <b>the</b> <b>Top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>World,</b> the spirometers became standard equipment on many other medically oriented mountain expeditions. They {{have been used to}} measure control of ventilation related to high-altitude pulmonary edema, to determine the efficacy of pharmaceutical treatments for acute mountain sickness, and to determine the efficacy of mechanical treatments for mountain sickness. In addition to their use in the field, Boehringer spirometers have also been used in hospital studies, typically related to anesthesia and patient monitoring.|$|E

However, at the Women's AAA championships in July, she spurned the chance of an almost certain victory in the 400 m and instead decided to contest the 800 metres. After winning her heat (2.05.7), she showed her huge potential in this event by running a superb 2:02.0 (the second fastest ever by a British woman), to finish 2nd to the reigning European 800 m champion, Vera Nikolic of Yugoslavia, whose time of 2:00.5 was a new world record.|$|E

25|$|Davis and Taylor {{met again}} in {{the final of the}} 1985 Grand Prix, but this time Davis won in the {{deciding}} frame. At 10 hours 21 minutes, it remains the longest one-day final in snooker history. In the 1985 UK Championship final Davis trailed 8–13 against Willie Thorne, who missed a blue off the spot which would have given him a 14–8 lead. Davis won the frame and then seven of the next eight to win 16–14. At the 1986 World Championship, Davis defeated White 13–5 in the quarter-finals and Thorburn 16–12 in the semi-finals, Davis's opponent in the final was Joe Johnson, who had started the tournament as a 150–1 outsider. Davis lost the match 12–18. The result did not affect his position at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>world</b> rankings, as he had won the UK Championship, the Grand Prix and the British Open in the 1985/1986 season.

25|$|In the UEFA Champions League final, Chelsea's opponents were Bayern Munich. By coincidence, {{the match}} {{was being held}} at the Allianz Arena, Bayern's home ground.

Bayern were awarded a penalty, but Arjen Robben's strike was saved by Petr Čech. The game remained 1–1, meaning it went to a penalty shootout. Bayern took a 3–1 lead after Juan Mata saw his penalty saved, but Čech then saved Ivica Olić and Bastian Schweinsteiger's efforts, leaving Drogba to score the decisive spot-kick to clinch Chelsea's first Champions League title in their history.

However, when Kirito's true identity is revealed, she is heartbroken {{and the two of them}} have an awkward exchange in the real world where Sugu reveals her feelings for him.
