Jaime promises that they will have revenge against all who have wronged the Lannisters, heightening the importance of he and Cersei staying close.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{came out}} to bat halfway through the middle session on the second day, after England had ended on 363. Having dropped Brown, Barnes's injury left Australia with only one {{specialist}} opener, Morris. Johnson—a bowler—was deployed as Australia's makeshift second opener and fell for one. On the third morning, Barnes {{came out to}} bat upon Keith Miller's dismissal at 4/135, {{even though he had}} collapsed from the aftereffects of his injury while practising in the nets. Barnes had refused to stay in hospital and returned to the ground despite his ribs being discoloured from the bruising. Bradman was not aware of Barnes's collapse in the nets, but had <b>told</b> <b>all</b> rounder Sam Loxton to bat before Barnes to give the bruised opener more rest. Loxton told Barnes of Bradman's wishes, but when Miller was dismissed, Barnes defied team orders and walked out to bat, shaking Pollard's hand at the start of his innings.|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of September 1, {{hurricane}} warnings were issued for the northwest Bahamas while hurricane watches were issued for the lower east coast of Florida and tropical storm watches were issued for the Florida Keys. There was the potential for catastrophic damage along Florida's heavily populated east coast, with warnings that damages from Frances could exceed the insured losses of Hurricane Andrew. These damage estimates were in anticipation that Frances would strike Florida as a strong Category Four hurricane. Preparations for the storm were stepped up in Florida on September 1. Governor Jeb Bush {{declared a state of}} emergency, Kennedy Space Center closed down, and evacuations of 500,000people were initially ordered. Eventually 41 counties received evacuation orders, covering 2.8million residents, the largest evacuation in Florida's history. The state education system also responded to the pending crisis. Many universities across Florida canceled classes. Both the University of Central Florida and the University of North Florida <b>told</b> <b>all</b> students to leave their dorms. Evacuation at the University of South Florida was performed on a dorm-by-dorm basis. Florida Atlantic University was closed for a week and a half. Most schools were shut down from southern Miami-Dade County to just south of Melbourne two days before the hurricane. The annual Florida State University-University of Miami college football game was rescheduled for the following week.|$|E

5|$|They {{finished}} 8–3 in 1941, {{and held}} a ceremony to honor the future Hall of Famer Leemans in the final regular season game on December 7, 1941. Leemans {{had been with the}} Giants since 1936, when he led the league in rushing as a rookie with 830yards. A versatile performer, he rushed for over 3,000yards, and passed for over 2,300 in his career. During the course of the game the stadium announcer paged Colonel William Joseph Donovan to answer a call from Washington, D.C., and <b>told</b> <b>all</b> servicemen to return to their units, but it was only when the game concluded that players and spectators learned of the attack on the naval base at Pearl Harbor earlier that day. New York advanced to the championship game following the season, in which they lost to the Bears 37–9. Both the 1940 and 1941 championship games were close early before their respective opponents went on an offensive surge to break the games open late. In 1942 and 1943, the Giants totalled an 11–8–2 record and failed to make the postseason.|$|E
25|$|Around 9:30a.m., {{the captain}} gave orders to {{evacuate}} the ship, though the order {{may not have been}} relayed to all the passengers. At 9:33a.m., after confirming that nearby ships had volunteered to help in the rescue operations, the VTS <b>told</b> <b>all</b> ships to drop lifeboats for the passengers. At 9:38a.m., all communications were cut off between the VTS and the ferry. About three minutes after all communications were cut, about 150 to 160 passengers and crew jumped overboard.|$|E
25|$|The woman's head quickly withdraws, {{the door}} to the trailer closes again, but she leaves behind her an unmistakable sense of watchful remonstrance, as if an angel had briefly touched the surface of the world with one sandaled foot, asked if there was any trouble and, being <b>told</b> <b>all</b> was well, had resumed her place in the ether with skeptical gravity, having {{reminded}} the children of earth that they are just barely trusted to manage their own business, and that further carelessness will not go unremarked.|$|E

25|$|The Cubists are {{not waiting}} for the war to end to recommence {{hostilities}} against good sense. They are exhibiting at the Galerie Poiret naked women whose scattered parts are represented in all {{four corners of the}} canvas: here an eye, there an ear, over there a hand, a foot on top, a mouth below. M. Picasso, their leader, is possibly the least disheveled of the lot. He has painted, or rather daubed, five women who are, if the truth be <b>told,</b> <b>all</b> hacked up, and yet their limbs somehow manage to hold together. They have, moreover, piggish faces with eyes wandering negligently above their ears. An enthusiastic art-lover offered the artist 20,000 francs for this masterpiece. M. Picasso wanted more. The art-lover did not insist.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Thomas' son {{had married}} Lazar's {{daughter}} {{and took over}} Smederevo. Thomas boasted about his son being made despot, but the arrangement was made short {{by the arrival of}} Mehmed {{at the head of a}} vast force before the walls of Smederevo. Terrified, Thomas' son and brother agreed to surrender the town and fortress on 20 June in exchange for safe conduct. Thomas and Radivoj were bitterly reproached by the Hungarian king. Matthias <b>told</b> <b>all</b> Europe that Thomas had sold the fortress of paramount importance to the enemy. Thomas took great pain to clear his name, explaining to Pope Pius II that Smederevo could not have been defended. The King sent a delegation to the ongoing Council of Mantua in July, promising to do his best to hold the Turks back and begging for help. The only ruler to provide assistance to Thomas was Bianca Maria Visconti, Duchess of Milan, who sent 300 men via Ancona.|$|E

25|$|Towards {{the end of}} the Han dynasty, Xu Chu rallied {{thousands}} of his clan members and they constructed a fortress to fend off the Yellow Turban rebels. An army of rebels from Runan (汝南; present-day Runan County, Zhumadian, Henan), numbering more than 10,000, once attacked Xu Chu's fortress. The defenders were outnumbered and worn out as the battle dragged on. When the arrows were used up, Xu Chu <b>told</b> <b>all</b> the men and women within the fortress to gather stones the size of chess pieces and place them in the four corners of the fortress. He then hurled the stones at the enemies, crushing the bones of all those who were hit. The rebels then kept a distance away and did not dare to come close. When the food supply was exhausted, Xu Chu pretended to negotiate a truce with the rebels and discuss a deal to exchange an ox for food. When the rebels came to collect the ox, the animal would always run back. Then Xu Chu, holding on to the ox's tail, pulled it along for more than a hundred steps. Seeing this, the startled rebels took off without the ox. The rebels in the surrounding areas heard of this incident and became fearful of Xu Chu.|$|E
500|$|At the hospital, two men forced Feng {{to apply}} her {{thumbprint}} to {{a consent form}} and sign a document authorizing the abortion. [...] She was taken into an operating room and restrained by two men as she was injected with a poison to kill the fetus. Feng later <b>told</b> <b>All</b> Girls Allowed, an American group campaigning against the one-child policy, [...] "I could feel the baby jumping around inside me all the time, but then she went still." [...] She had been seven months pregnant at the time, so the abortion, voluntary or not, was illegal under Chinese law. No family members were allowed to be present for the procedure. After the child died of hypoxia, Feng underwent induced labor and delivered a stillborn girl on June 4. Feng later <b>told</b> <b>All</b> Girls Allowed: [...] "It was much more painful than my first childbirth. The baby was lifeless, and she was all purple and blue." [...] The corpse was then placed next to Feng on her bed for her family to dispose of when they arrived.|$|E

500|$|... "First Flight" [...] also {{provided}} {{the stage for}} an exchange with the United States Navy aircraft carrier USS Enterprise (CVN-65). Three crew members of the real-life Enterprise had been voted as [...] "Sailors of the Year" [...] by the U.S. Navy, and so were given the roles of extras in this episode. This {{was not the first}} time such an exchange had occurred; previous winners had appeared as crew members on board the fictional Enterprise in the episode [...] "Desert Crossing". However, this time around they were given roles at the NX Command Center instead. Aviation Maintenance Administrationman 2nd Class James D. Frey portrayed a technician, Navy Counselor 1st Class Kathleen J. Grant played a Senator and Hospital Corpsman 3rd Class Thomas P. Hunt was the Senator's assistant. All three were pleased to be appearing on the show, with Grant saying that [...] "My nephew <b>told</b> <b>all</b> of the kids at his school his aunt was going to be on Star Trek. That makes the experience even more of a thrill for me", and Hunt saying [...] "This will be on reruns for years to come, when I'm 60, I'll be able to say, 'Hey, that's me on Enterprise.'". In return, the three sailors presented the cast and crew of Star Trek: Enterprise with a flag that had been flying on the aircraft carrier earlier in the month.|$|E
500|$|Five {{months after}} moving onto Coronation Street, Toyah {{developed}} {{a crush on}} her neighbour, Spider Nugent (Martin Hancock), and even turned vegetarian to try and impress him.

[...] However, when she listened to his issues and helped him with his battles against the local supermarket and the council, Spider began to admire her instead. Hancock explained [...] "She was so efficient and hard-working that she became a friend. And then, over the summer, it hit him, [...] "Blimey! She's turned out nice!" [...] While Spider and Toyah watched the 1999 solar eclipse together, they ended up having sex for the first time. Hancock observed that both Spider and Toyah were overcome by the excitement to the point that there was [...] "an explosion of lust." [...] However, in the morning, Spider was torn about what had happened. He admired Toyah, but knew that if they became a couple, it would cause a lot of problems, particularly as there was a ten-year age gap between them. Taylor explained that she was happy that her character was getting together with Spider, although their scenes together often took place in the [...] "grottiest" [...] of locations.|$|E

500|$|Black militia {{fought back}} in Charleston on September 6, 1876 {{in what was}} known as the [...] "King Street riot". The white militia assumed {{defensive}} positions out of concern over possible intervention from federal troops. Then, on September 19, the Red Shirts took offensive action by openly killing between 30 and 50 African Americans outside Ellenton. During the massacre, state representative Simon Coker was killed. On October 7, Governor Chamberlain declared martial law and <b>told</b> <b>all</b> the [...] "rifle club" [...] members to put down their weapons. In the meantime, Wade Hampton never ceased to remind Chamberlain that he did not rule South Carolina. Out of desperation, Chamberlain wrote to President Grant and asked for federal intervention. The [...] "Cainhoy riot" [...] took place on October 15 when Republicans held a rally at [...] "Brick Church" [...] outside Cainhoy. Blacks and whites both opened fire; six whites and one black were killed. Grant, upset over the Ellenton and Cainhoy riots, finally declared a Presidential Proclamation on October 17, 1876 and ordered all persons, within 3 days, to cease their lawless activities and disperse to their homes. A total of 1,144 federal infantrymen were sent into South Carolina, and the violence stopped; election day was quiet. Both Hampton and Chamberlain claimed victory, and for a while both acted as governor; Hampton took the office in 1877, after President Rutherford B. Hayes withdrew federal troops and after Chamberlain left the state.|$|E
