5|$|Written by Phil Ford. A story {{planned for}} the fourth series, it {{would have seen the}} return of UNIT, as they, along with Sarah Jane, {{investigated}} a mysterious cold effecting residents of Bannerman Road. This episode would have ended with the revelation that <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>had</b> caused it.|$|E
5|$|In 1992 Michael filed a {{malpractice}} {{suit against}} Terri's obstetrician {{on the basis}} that he failed to diagnose bulimia as the cause of her infertility. Terri had gone to the doctor because she had stopped menstruating but <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>had</b> failed to take her medical history into account which might have revealed an eating disorder. During the case, one of Terri's friends testified that she knew Schiavo was bulimic. In November 1992, Michael won the case and was awarded $6.8 million by the jury, later reduced to $2 million as Terri was found partly at fault for her condition. After attorneys' fees and other expenses, Michael received $300,000 and $750,000 was put in a trust fund for Terri's medical care. According to Michael, in early 2003 the Schindlers demanded that he share the malpractice money with them.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Finch's successes have aroused media {{attention}}— in particular, {{the attention}} of investigative journalist Sarah Jane Smith. While at first the Doctor feigns ignorance (but is barely able to restrain his pleasure at seeing her again), when Sarah Jane discovers the TARDIS during the night, he reveals his identity to her. Sarah Jane meets Rose and Mickey, with an immediate rivalry sparking between the two women. As the group searches the school, they find thirteen bat-like creatures asleep in Finch's office. Returning to Sarah Jane's car, the journalist reveals a battered, inactive K9 Mark III, who—once repaired—identifies the chip oil as Krillitane oil. Rose, unaware that <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>had</b> even had past companions, confronts him; he replies sadly that, while she can {{spend the rest of}} her life with him, he cannot spend the rest of his life with her, so he must remain aloof.|$|E
6000|$|... "The sort of case I like," [...] he said, [...] "is the {{one that}} all <b>the</b> <b>doctors</b> <b>have</b> given up as hopeless.

5000|$|When Bugs has his x-rays taken, <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> there assumes he (<b>the</b> <b>doctor)</b> <b>has</b> been overworked.|$|R
50|$|As {{a reward}} for his actions in <b>The</b> Three <b>Doctors</b> <b>the</b> Third <b>Doctor</b> <b>has</b> had his {{knowledge}} of the TARDIS's dematerialisation codes returned to him by the Time Lords. <b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>has</b> left Earth and is helping the rebels on the planet Xanthos.|$|R
25|$|Despite her brief tenure on the series, Katarina is {{significant}} {{for being the}} first of the Doctor's companions to die on-screen. After <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>had</b> defeated the Daleks, Steven said that he had seen too much death lately; the sacrifice of Katarina weighed on his mind, among others.|$|E
25|$|In 1999, Schwarzenegger sued Dr. Willi Heepe, a German {{doctor who}} {{publicly}} predicted his early {{death on the}} basis of a link between his steroid use and his later heart problems. As <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>had</b> never examined him personally, Schwarzenegger collected a US$10,000 libel judgment against him in a German court. In 1999, Schwarzenegger also sued and settled with Globe, a U.S. tabloid which had made similar predictions about the bodybuilder's future health.|$|E
25|$|The Eighth Doctor {{made his}} first {{television}} appearance in the 1996 Doctor Who television film, the first time <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>had</b> returned to television screens {{since the end of}} the original series in 1989. Intended as a backdoor pilot for a new television series on the Fox Network, the film drew 5.5% of the US audience, according to Nielsen Ratings. In the United Kingdom, it was received well, attracting over 9million viewers and generally positive reviews. It was also generally well received in Australia.|$|E

50|$|The {{novel is}} {{presented}} as a diary written by Zeno (who claims that it is full of lies), published by his <b>doctor.</b> <b>The</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>has</b> left a little note in the beginning, saying he had Zeno write an autobiography to help him in his psychoanalysis. <b>The</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>has</b> published <b>the</b> work as revenge for Zeno discontinuing his visits.|$|R
25|$|In the 1996 {{television}} movie, Chang Lee {{helps the}} Master {{because he has}} been duped into believing that <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>had</b> stolen his body. When Lee begins to realise the truth behind the Master, his loyalty begins to falter, therefore the Master attempts to kill him without hesitation. In promotional media surrounding the movie, Lee is depicted more as a companion to the Eighth Doctor (alongside Grace Holloway), and was referred to as such in a documentary series released as part of the 50 year anniversary celebrations, The Doctors Revisited - The Eighth Doctor.|$|E
25|$|Almost {{as soon as}} he'd left San Francisco, <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>had</b> another brief {{attack of}} amnesia, caused by a final trap of the Master's. To regain his memories, the Doctor was forced to visit all seven of his past selves and help them out with some crisis or another, {{at the same time}} {{acknowledging}} the responsibility his role gave him. Having regained his memories, the Doctor met a late twentieth-century Coal Hill School student named Samantha Jones; shortly after their encounter, the Doctor left her alone at a Greenpeace rally.|$|E
25|$|Also in that episode, {{the sonic}} {{screwdriver}} gets {{split into two}} pieces, one of which ends up inside a flying shark. The remaining piece {{is said to be}} signalling its other half in an effort to repair itself. The Doctor uses this to send a signal through the half inside the sky shark to open up the clouds. Afterwards, the half not in the shark is left with Kazran Sardick. The Doctor tells Kazran that he can call him for help using the Sonic; though Kazran declines to do so. <b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>had</b> duplicates of this screwdriver, which he continued to use throughout his travels.|$|E
50|$|This is {{the first}} time <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>has</b> been {{explicitly}} named in the series.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>has</b> {{each of them}} sealed into an {{engineering}} locker, and Kevin takes them outside the ship to the secondary control room. <b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>has</b> them turn everything back on that was shut down when the ship entered the zeg, {{and then they go}} back to their own ship. They leave a Black Shadow parchment behind, and <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> tricks one of the robots into picking it up.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>has</b> an old map of Martian cities {{which he}} uses {{throughout}} the story.|$|R
25|$|Some {{while after}} this, the Doctor was {{captured}} by Marnal, {{one of the few}} surviving Gallifreyans, and accused of destroying Gallifrey. Although Gallifrey had been all but wiped from history by the Doctor's actions, Marnal was able to jury-rig a Time Space Visualiser to witness the Doctor actually push the button as he faced off against the Grandfather, although there were about three minutes between the Doctor firing the shot and Gallifrey's actual destruction where the Doctor's activities in the TARDIS were unaccounted for. Reflecting on his discoveries in the TARDIS, the Doctor, along with the aid of K9 (who had been transported into a hidden area of the TARDIS and trapped there following Gallifrey's destruction) realised that his memory loss hadn't been caused by the trauma of destroying Gallifrey; in fact, <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>had</b> wiped his memories to give his mind space to store the contents of the Matrix within his brain, compressed down so he wouldn't be driven mad by the voices of all the dead Time Lords within him, his own memories presumably stored somewhere else in his mind, given his occasional flashes from his past. However, right then, <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>had</b> more immediate worries; namely, saving Earth from a species of massive fly-like aliens called the Vore, who would soon have the power to devour the planet. As The Gallifrey Chronicles ended, the Doctor, Fitz, and Trix dove into the Vore mountain, the Doctor equipped with a plan to stop the Vore and save the world.|$|E
25|$|Head once {{stated that}} he could not recall a time in his life when he had not wished to pursue a career in medicine. He often thought that the dream of {{becoming}} a doctor could have first been formed at the age of eight when his family was involved in an epidemic of scarlet fever. He remembered being taken to spend a few days with the family doctor, Mr. Brett, and one morning at breakfast he startled his family by repeating a procedure that <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>had</b> used during his illness. Pouring a little tea onto a teaspoon, he had heated it over an oil lamp and carefully inspected the result, checking the tea for albumin as Mr. Brett had done with his urine.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} {{regeneration}} {{was created in}} 1966 by the writers of Doctor Who {{as a method of}} replacing the leading actor. The role of <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>had</b> been played by William Hartnell since the programme began in 1963 but, by 1966, it was increasingly apparent that Hartnell's health was deteriorating and he was becoming more difficult to work with. Producer John Wiles had, following several clashes with Hartnell, intended to have the actor replaced in The Celestial Toymaker; during two episodes of that serial, the Doctor is invisible (owing to Hartnell being on holiday during the recording). Wiles' plan was for the character to reappear played by a new actor. This proposal was vetoed by Gerald Savory, the BBC's Head of Serials (and Wiles' superior), which led to Wiles leaving before The Celestial Toymaker was produced. However, it was apparent {{that it would not be}} possible for Hartnell to continue for much longer.|$|E

50|$|Grace's {{life after}} her {{encounter}} with <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>has</b> not been explored on-screen beyond the television movie, although <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> did <b>have</b> {{to deal with}} the after effects of those events in <b>the</b> spin-off Eighth <b>Doctor</b> Adventures novel Unnatural History, by Kate Orman and Jonathan Blum.|$|R

25|$|During the attack, an Iraqi {{doctor who}} was {{next door to}} the police station was alerted to the fact of the six RMPs being under siege and drove to the edge of town in an {{ambulance}} where a Major from 1 Para had established an Incident Control Point (ICP). He informed the Paratroopers of the RMPs plight at about midday local time and conveyed to the Paratroopers that the RMPs were being held hostage. At 12:30pm, Dr. Fasal returned to the ICP and informed Major Kemp that three of the British were dead. By now, with all 1 Para troops accounted for, the staff in the Ops Room were wondering who they could be and realized that they must be the six-man RMP section. By the time <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>had</b> returned to the police station, all of the RMPs were dead, and for a third time, he returned to the checkpoint with the bad news. Later, Dr. Fasal brought all of the bodies out to the checkpoint and handed them over to the British.|$|E
25|$|Within the series' narrative, K9 is a robot dog {{acquired}} by Doctor Whos title {{character in the}} 1977 serial The Invisible Enemy. The first two incarnations of the character travelled alongside the fourth Doctor (portrayed by Tom Baker) until 1981. In these stories, K9 proved useful for the powerful laser weapon concealed in his nose, his encyclopaedic knowledge and his vast computer intelligence. By 1981, {{each of the two}} models of K9 which travelled alongside <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>had</b> been left with one of the Doctor's female companions. The character subsequently transitioned into spin-off territory. Producers hoped K9's popularity with children would launch the series K9 and Company, led by actress Elisabeth Sladen in the role of companion Sarah Jane Smith alongside a new K9. In 2006, K9 reappeared in the revived series of Doctor Who. Although the character's appearances in the 2007 spin-off The Sarah Jane Adventures were hampered by the concurrent development of the K9 spin-off, the character began to appear full-time in both K9 and The Sarah Jane Adventures, depicting adventures of the original K9 Mark I and of Mark IV, respectively.|$|E
25|$|In 1968, a Dr. Meadow {{encountered}} six {{babies with}} cleft lip and palate {{in addition to}} other congenital abnormalities whose mothers had been taking anticonvulsants. Meadow wrote a letter in The Lancet asking for cases of cleft lip and palate in babies whose mothers had taken anticonvulsants. That same year, Milunsky, Graef, and Gaynor reported cases of cleft lip and palate associated with attempted abortion with methotrexate and aminopterin, which are folic acid antagonists. While it was widely accepted by 1969 that these drugs could interfere with folic acid and that folic acid supplementation might have beneficial somatic effects, it was believed that folic acid supplementation could exacerbate seizures; this included the routine supplements given to pregnant women to prevent megaloblastic anemia. By 1970, <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>had</b> collected thirty-two cases. Sixteen of them were born to women taking primidone. 25% of the thirty-two cases had congenital heart defects; the reported rate in cleft lip and palate was 3-5%. Meadow emphasized that there was no proof of an association, the immense value of anticonvulsants and the probably small odds of any one epileptic woman having a child with a congenital abnormality. Roman and Caratzali reported in 1971 that the offspring of mice treated with primidone had more abnormal bone metaphases than controls; this was due to chromosomal lesions. By the mid-1970s, it was obvious that this antagonistic effect of primidone was not due to the inhibition of dihydrofolate reductase, the enzyme responsible for the reduction of dihydrofolic acid to tetrahydrofolic acid, but rather to defective folate metabolism.|$|E

25|$|The most {{prominent}} economic analyst {{of law is}} 1991 Nobel Prize winner Ronald Coase, whose first major article, The Nature of the Firm (1937), argued {{that the reason for}} the existence of firms (companies, partnerships, etc.) is the existence of transaction costs. Rational individuals trade through bilateral contracts on open markets until the costs of transactions mean that using corporations to produce things is more cost-effective. His second major article, The Problem of Social Cost (1960), argued that if we lived in a world without transaction costs, people would bargain with one another to create the same allocation of resources, regardless of the way a court might rule in property disputes. Coase used the example of a nuisance case named Sturges v Bridgman, where a noisy sweetmaker and a quiet doctor were neighbours and went to court to see who should have to move. Coase said that regardless of whether the judge ruled that the sweetmaker had to stop using his machinery, or that <b>the</b> <b>doctor</b> <b>had</b> to put up with it, they could strike a mutually beneficial bargain about who moves that reaches the same outcome of resource distribution. Only the existence of transaction costs may prevent this. So the law ought to pre-empt what would happen, and be guided by the most efficient solution. The idea is that law and regulation are not as important or effective at helping people as lawyers and government planners believe. Coase and others like him wanted a change of approach, to put the burden of proof for positive effects on a government that was intervening in the market, by analysing the costs of action.|$|E
25|$|Barbara Wright first {{appears in}} the first Doctor Who serial, An Unearthly Child (1963), where she is {{teaching}} history at Coal Hill School in London in 1963, working with science teacher Ian Chesterton (William Russell). They are curious about their student Susan Foreman (Carole Ann Ford), who shows an unusually advanced knowledge of science and history, but a rudimentary knowledge of other subjects. In an attempt {{to learn more about}} Susan, Barbara and Ian follow her home to a junkyard, where they hear her voice coming from {{what appears to be a}} police box. During a confrontation with her grandfather, the Doctor (William Hartnell), Barbara rushes in to the police box, only to discover that its exterior hides the much larger interior of the TARDIS. After the Doctor reveals to Barbara and Ian that he and Susan are aliens exiled from their own planet, he tells them he cannot risk their revealing information about the TARDIS to their contemporary world, and dematerialises the craft against Susan's protests. At this point in the series <b>the</b> <b>Doctor</b> <b>had</b> no control over where or when it would land, making a return to London in 1963 impossible to co-ordinate. They are transported back in time to 100,000 BCE Earth, where they are captured by a prehistoric tribe seeking the secret of fire. Once they escape back to the TARDIS, their second trip takes them to the planet Skaro, where they encounter the Daleks for the first time. At the end of the first episode of that serial, Barbara becomes separated from her fellow travellers and is threatened by an unseen creature with a metal arm, marking the first appearance of a Dalek.|$|E
500|$|The episode revisits {{the events}} of several {{previous}} episodes: [...] "The Runaway Bride", [...] "Smith and Jones", [...] "Voyage of the Damned", [...] "Partners in Crime" [...] and [...] "The Poison Sky". It is shown that <b>the</b> <b>Doctor,</b> <b>had</b> he faced the Racnoss without Donna, would have actually died permanently. [...] Some of the disasters the Doctor stopped would have happened without anyone to stop them, while many of his former companions and their friends would have died stepping in his place.|$|E
