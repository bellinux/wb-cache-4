25|$|A {{twist drill}} {{is a bit}} with two cut grooves in {{opposite}} sides of a round bar, whereby the <b>twisted</b> <b>bar</b> produces a helical flute in order to drill holes in metal, plastic, or wood. The twist drill was invented by Stephen A. Morse in October 1861 and later patented on April 7, 1863.|$|E

25|$|There {{are also}} two torcs made from single <b>twisted</b> <b>bars</b> of gold, a British style. One is complete, with a {{diameter}} of 18.6cm, the other a semi-circular fragment. Despite unusual hook-in-loop fastenings and other features, these are probably imports from what is now south-eastern England.|$|R

50|$|The ancient swordmakers {{exploited}} the aesthetic qualities of pattern welded steel. The Vikings, in particular, were fond of <b>twisting</b> <b>bars</b> of steel around each other, welding the bars together by hammering and then repeating the process with the resulting bars, to create complex {{patterns in the}} final steel <b>bar.</b> Two <b>bars</b> <b>twisted</b> in opposite directions created the common chevron pattern. Often, {{the center of the}} blade was a core of soft steel, and the edges were solid high carbon steel, similar to the laminates of the Japanese.|$|R

40|$|A new {{approach}} to the general torsion problem of the regular prismatic bar was introduced, based on extensive and meticulous experimental evidence, indicating that the <b>twisted</b> prismatic <b>bars,</b> except the cylindrical ones, present, a longitudinal warping, following a sinusoidal type of curves for the warping displacements with their extrema displaced towards the corners. As a guide {{for the establishment of}} the method the solutions of the elliptical and the equiangular triangular bars were used. It was found that the regions inside the inscribed circles tangent to the sides of their undeformed cross-sections constituted regions whose warped surfaces constitute undulated forms following sinusoidal surfaces. This property was proved exact for the exact solutions for the elliptic and triangular cross-sections and it is assumed by induction valid for any regular cross-section. Comparing the warping displacements along the inscribed circle to a square or regular polygon cross section with the classical Timoshenko solution for the square bar it was found an exact coincidence in these displacements. It was further shown that these circles and all concentric full circles constitute the initial curves of the caustics formed from reflections of the warped cross-sections of the <b>twisted</b> <b>bars.</b> The differences between the stresses and displacements between the existing approximate solutions and the {{new approach}} appear in the partly curved triangles lying outside the inscribed circles. For the square cross-section it was shown that the w-displacements between Timoshenko's solution and the present one were less than 5 percent. Experimental evidence with the Moiré method and comparison with the exact solution for the equiangular triangular cross section proved that the present approach is closer to reality and therefore presents higher accuracy than any approximate method. Furthermore, it presents the advantage that the full circles inscribed inside the cross-section constitute the initial curves forming caustics in space when a parallel light beam is reflected on the warped cross-section of the <b>twisted</b> <b>bars.</b> interesting properties of caustics, proved in this paper, help down-rightly for a thorough study of the form and properties of the <b>twisted</b> <b>bars.</b> © 1989 Springer-Verlag...|$|R
50|$|The bracelets were folded flat, sixteen {{decorated}} by punched patterns, six with crosses stamped in their centre, and another six with centre cross {{and one at}} each end. Two have lattice patterns, one an hourglass stamp around the edge, one chevrons with central and end crosses, and one (found as a <b>twisted</b> <b>bar)</b> a zig-zag pattern; the remaining four are plain. The lead fragments suggest the hoard could have been buried either in a lead sheet or a lead-lined wood box.|$|E
40|$|We use the Signorini {{expansion}} method {{to determine the}} second-order Saint-Venant solution for an infinitesimally bent and stretched bar. The bar in the unstressed reference configuration is straight, prismatic, isotropic, homogeneous and made of a second-order elastic material. These solutions and those found earlier for a pretwisted bar give generalized Poynting effects. A bar when bent stretches and the elongation {{is determined by the}} first and second-order elasticities, area of cross-section, torsional rigidity, bending vector and the inertia tensor. When an infinitesimally <b>twisted</b> <b>bar</b> is deformed, there is a second-order bending deformation even when there is no resultant bending moment applied on the end faces...|$|E
40|$|The study {{sought to}} {{evaluate}} the performance of Landolphia buchananii concrete beams to establish the potential of Landolphia buchananii as structural reinforcement of concrete in beams. Tensile strength test on Landolphia buchananii was performed while flexural test was done on Landolphia buchananii reinforced beams and compared with steel reinforced concrete beams. Beams of 1100 mm length having 150 mm width and 250 mm depth {{were used in the}} tests. Varying area of reinforcement of L. buchananii was used for beam specimens made of concrete of average compressive strength of 21. 8 N/mm 2. The steel reinforced beams were reinforced with standard 8 mm High strength <b>twisted</b> <b>bar</b> as a tensile reinforcement. The results showed that the ultimate load for the L. buchananii reinforced beams was lower than that of control beams by about 65 % and therefore L. buchananii can only be used under low loading regimes such as in low rise lintel beams with load bearing walls...|$|E

50|$|By World War II {{the other}} common type was torsion bar suspension, getting spring force from <b>twisting</b> <b>bars</b> inside the hull — this {{sometimes}} had less travel than the Christie-type, but was significantly more compact, allowing more space inside the hull, with consequent possibility to install larger turret rings {{and thus a}} heavier main armament. The torsion-bar suspension, sometimes including shock absorbers, has been the dominant heavy armored vehicle suspension since World War II. Torsion bars may take space under or near the floor, which may interfere with making the tank low to reduce exposure.|$|R

50|$|The {{central area}} of the museum {{contains}} {{one of the finest}} collections of Bronze Age gold objects in Europe. The goldwork ranges in date between 2200 BC and 500 BC, most of it probably being jewellery, but with many objects of unknown (possibly ritual) function. In the early Bronze Age most artefacts were made from sheet gold and include sundiscs and crescent shaped collars called lunulae. In the middle Bronze Age new gold working techniques were developed; starting around 1200 BC a great variety of torcs were produced from <b>twisting</b> <b>bars</b> of gold. Items from the late Bronze Age, starting in 900 BC, include solid gold bracelets and dress-fasteners as well as large sheet gold collars, ear-spools and a necklace of hollow golden balls.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The use of <b>twisted</b> {{stainless}} steel <b>bars</b> {{has proven to}} be effective in scenarios where lateral loads (e. g. earthquakes and winds storms) can cause partial or complete out-of-plane collapse of masonry wall’s outer leaves or separation of wood diaphragms from masonry walls. The particular application of these bars as a dry system in mortar joints, without any binder, brings additional advantages in terms of cost, installation time and weather restrictions. An experimental campaign composed by 60 pull-out tests aimed at characterizing the bond behaviour of <b>twisted</b> {{stainless steel}} <b>bars</b> in mortar joints. The influence on bond behaviour of two diameters of the helibar (ϕ 8 mm and ϕ 10 mm), three different anchorage lengths (8 ϕhb, 12 ϕhb, and 20 ϕhb), and two diameters of the pre-drilled holes (ϕhb– 2 mm and ϕhb– 4 mm) was studied. Bond strength increased for the tighter pre-drilled hole but decreased for the higher <b>twisted</b> steel <b>bar</b> diameter. Good correlations between bond strength and anchorage length were found for the less tight pre-drilled holes...|$|R

25|$|The {{twist drill}} bit {{was invented by}} Steven A. Morse of East Bridgewater, Massachusetts in 1861.

5000|$|Some metals are [...] "hot short", {{meaning they}} lose their tensile {{strength}} when heated. They become like Plasticine: although they may still be manipulated by squeezing, an attempt to stretch them, even by bending or twisting, {{is likely to have}} them crack and break apart. This is a problem for some blade-making steels, which must be worked carefully to avoid developing hidden cracks that would cause failure in the future. Though rarely hand-worked, titanium is notably hot short. Even such common smithing processes as decoratively <b>twisting</b> a <b>bar</b> are impossible with it.|$|R
5000|$|Like all of Chopin's other études, {{this work}} is in ternary form A-B-A. The strict {{periodic}} structure contains eight-bar periods—two in the A section, forming a regular 16-bar period, three in the middle one and in the final A section a single eight-bar period expanded by five bars. The harmonic relationships in the first eight bars, marked by a deceptive <b>twist</b> to <b>bar</b> 4 and a Neapolitan chord in bar 7, are shown in a harmonic reduction. Bars 9 - 16 repeat the same progression, ending with a perfect E-flat minor cadence.|$|R
