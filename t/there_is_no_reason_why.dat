The printed area had the same ratio, and was shifted {{out of the middle}} to leave a 2:1 white margin, both {{horizontally}} and vertically. Historian John Man writes that the ratio was chosen to be close to the golden ratio of 1.61:1.

25|$|The lack of R18+ and X18+ {{ratings for}} games {{has been the}} subject of {{complaint}} in the gaming community, particularly on the basis that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> adults should not be able to see content in games that they would see in a film. One of the main opponents to the introduction of a R18+ rating for video games was the former South Australian Attorney-General Michael Atkinson who has vetoed every attempt to induce one. Following his resignation after the 2010 South Australian elections there appears to be no likelihood of a future veto in the face of public opinion supporting the new classification. In August 2008, Australian video game show Good Game announced that a meeting of the Attorneys-General in March of that year resulted in a decision that the Australian public would be consulted before a final decision on the status of a R18+ rating for video games would be made.|$|E

25|$|The {{reason that}} the Zariski {{topology}} does not work well {{is that it is}} too coarse: it has too few open sets. There seems to be no good way to fix this by using a finer topology on a general algebraic variety. Grothendieck's key insight was to realize that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> the more general open sets should be subsets of the algebraic variety: the definition of a sheaf works perfectly well for any category, not just the category of open subsets of a space. He defined étale cohomology by replacing the category of open subsets of a space by the category of étale mappings to a space: roughly speaking, these {{can be thought of as}} open subsets of finite unbranched covers of the space. These turn out (after a lot of work) to give just enough extra open sets that one can get reasonable cohomology groups for some constant coefficients, in particular for coefficients Z/nZ when n is coprime to the characteristic of the field one is working over.|$|E

His advisors remarked on his habit of treating all people the same, regardless of their social station or colour. In letters home, he complained of {{the treatment of the}} native Indians by the British officials: [...] "Because a man has a black face and a different religion from our own, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> he should be treated as a brute." [...] Consequently, Lord Salisbury, the Secretary of State for India, issued new guidance and at least one resident was removed from office. At the end of the tour, Queen Victoria was given the title Empress of India by Parliament, in part {{as a result of the}} tour's success.|$|E

Indeed, for a considerable part of the population of England this sort of security has long been achieved.|$|E

2500|$|While {{some have}} {{stressed}} her queer, feminist, pro-immigration, and democratic politics, her statements on immigration include sentiments {{that would be}} considered racist today. In a 1934 interview published in The New York Times she stated: That {{is the reason why}} I do not approve of the stringent immigration laws in America today. We need the stimulation of new blood. It is best to favor healthy competition. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> we should not select our immigrants with greater care, nor why we should not bar certain peoples and preserve the color line for instance.

To enter into such an insurance against extreme misfortune may well be in the interest of all; or it may be felt to be a clear moral duty of all to assist, within the organised community, those who cannot help themselves. [...] So long as such a uniform minimum income is provided outside the market to all those who, for any reason, are unable to earn in the market an adequate maintenance, this need not lead to a restriction of freedom, or conflict with the Rule of Law.|$|E

2500|$|Farmer and {{his wife}} Marlene sold their house in 1992 and ran a two-star Southway Auto Lodge motel in South Perth until 1998,. Farmer said the {{business}} failed due to the downturn in the Asian economy and a 40% drop in tourist numbers, and left him with no money or assets.

All my life I have helped myself and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> I can’t still do that". Farmer and Marlene were given temporary accommodation in the caretaker’s flat in the Main Roads building.

A trust fund was established with the money and a small villa bought in Innaloo.|$|E
2500|$|Another type of {{variation}} {{is known as}} potent (Ger. Sturzkrückenfeh, [...] "upside-down crutch vair"). [...] In this form, the familiar [...] "vair bell" [...] {{is replaced by a}} T-shaped figure, known as a [...] "potent" [...] due to its resemblance to a crutch. [...] The appearance of this shape is thought by some authorities to have originated from crude draftsmanship, although others regard it as an old and perfectly acceptable variation. [...] A regularly encountered variation of potent is counter-potent or potent-counter-potent (Ger. Gegensturzkrückenfeh), which is produced in the same fashion as counter-vair; potent in point (Ger.

2500|$|The Times was {{not overly}} {{enthusiastic}} in its review of 15 December 1954 when it said, [...] "Miss Agatha Christie tries {{this time to}} combine a story of murder with a comedy of character. As Edgar Wallace showed more than once, this thing can be done. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> the special tension of the one should not support the special tension of the other. In this instance, however, the support is at best intermittent. There is a risk that those that are chiefly concerned {{to find out who}} murdered the odious blackmailer will hardly regard the solution as one of the author's happiest. There is a like risk {{that the rest of the}} audience will be bored with a comedy which has to accommodate itself to the requirements of a long police interrogation. The common ground on which both sections may stand is dangerously small." [...] The reviewer admitted that, [...] "the thriller gives all the characters a turn and yet contrives at the end to produce a twist. It is a twist which surprises rather than satisfies the logical mind." [...] but they concluded, [...] "the play as a whole is the least exciting and not the most amusing of the three Agatha Christie's now running in London." ...|$|E

Having seen the new additions, they changed their mind. [...] "The Small Heath ground presents quite an imposing appearance now that it is adorned with the old Perry Barr grand stand, and as there is now plenty of covered accommodation for spectators the [...] "gates" [...] should materially increase", and though Hodgetts would be missed, Jack Kirton [...] "appears to be a smart player, while the other new men secured are far from being 'duffers'", and apart from Jones and Farnall, [...] "the whole of the other first team players from last season have signed again, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> the Heathens should not render a good account of themselves" [...] next season.|$|E
2500|$|Tasmania toured Zimbabwe {{for five}} games {{ahead of the}} 1995–96 Sheffield Shield. Ponting struggled, {{aggregating}} 99 runs at a modest 24.75. By the end of October, he had {{signed a contract with}} the Australian Cricket Board, along with 22 other Australian cricketers. [...] He opened the batting with Boon in Tasmania's first match of the Sheffield Shield season, scoring 20 and 43. Ahead of the following match against Queensland in Hobart, Ponting set himself a goal of scoring a century in each innings; a feat he achieved in a high-scoring draw. His form continued against the touring Sri Lankans in a one-day game in Devonport, scoring 99. He scored another century against the same opposition in Launceston. During the match, the public address system at the NTCA Ground announced that Ponting was making his Test debut against Sri Lanka in Perth on 8 December. The following morning saw local newspaper The Examiner headline: [...] "He's Ricky Ponting, he's ours ... and he's made it! Tassie's batting star will play in his first Test." [...] Marsh continued his praise of Ponting, who replaced a dropped Blewett. [...] "I have no doubt Ricky will be trying to get 100 in his first Test game. And I hope he does. You'd back him to.
