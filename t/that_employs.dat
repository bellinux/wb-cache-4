It entered the technical preview stage on 19 July 2010, and the final build was released on 16 December 2010. It includes Network Inspection System (NIS), a network intrusion detection system that works on Windows Vista and Windows 7, as well as a new anti-malware engine <b>that</b> <b>employs</b> heuristics in malware detection. Version 2.0 integrates with Internet Explorer to protect users against web-based threats. NIS requires a separate set of definition updates.|$|E

5|$|Gravitational-wave {{astronomy}} is {{an emerging}} field of astronomy <b>that</b> <b>employs</b> gravitational-wave detectors to collect observational data about distant massive objects. A few observatories have been constructed, {{such as the}} Laser Interferometer Gravitational Observatory LIGO. LIGO made its first detection on 14 September 2015, observing gravitational waves from a binary black hole. A second gravitational wave was detected on 26 December 2015 and additional observations should continue but gravitational waves require extremely sensitive instruments.|$|E
5|$|Health {{care and}} {{emergency}} medical service {{in the city of}} Paris and its suburbs are provided by the Assistance publique – Hôpitaux de Paris (AP-HP), a public hospital system <b>that</b> <b>employs</b> more than 90,000 people (including practitioners, support personnel, and administrators) in 44 hospitals. It is the largest hospital system in Europe. It provides health care, teaching, research, prevention, education and {{emergency medical service}} in 52 branches of medicine. The hospitals receive more than 5.8 million annual patient visits.|$|E
5|$|In rivercane basketweaving among Southeastern Woodlands {{tribes in}} the Americas, {{butternut}} (Juglans cinerea) and yellow root (Xanthorhiza simplicissima) provide a rich yellow color. Chitimacha basket weavers have a complex formula for yellow <b>that</b> <b>employs</b> a dock plant (most likely Rumex crispus) for yellow. Navajo artists create yellow dyes from small snake-weed, brown onion skins, and rubber plant (Parthenium incanum). Rabbitbush (Chrysothamnus) and rose hips produce pale, yellow-cream colored dyes.|$|E

5|$|The marbled {{electric}} ray is an ambush predator <b>that</b> <b>employs</b> electricity to capture prey. Vision is of little importance in hunting, as the ray's eyes are often obscured as it lies buried on the bottom. Instead, it likely relies on the mechanoreceptors of its lateral line, as it only attacks moving prey. The electroreceptive ampullae of Lorenzini may also contribute to prey detection.|$|E
5|$|Family Trade is an American reality {{television}} series broadcast by Game Show Network. The show premiered on March 12, 2013, {{and continued to}} air new episodes until April 16, 2013. Filmed in Middlebury, Vermont, the series chronicles the daily activities of G. Stone Motors, a GMC and Ford car dealership <b>that</b> <b>employs</b> the barter system in selling its automobiles. The dealership is operated by its founder, Gardner Stone, his son and daughter, Todd and Darcy, and General Manager Travis Romano. The series features the shop's daily interaction with its customers, who bring {{in a variety of}} items that can be resold in order to receive a down payment on the vehicle they are leasing or purchasing. Commentary and narration are also often provided by the Stones during the episodes.|$|E

30|$|We {{model the}} {{response}} of nanoscale Ag prolate spheroids to an external uniform static electric field using simulations based on the discrete dipole approximation, in which the spheroid is represented {{as a collection of}} polarizable subunits. We compare the results of simulations <b>that</b> <b>employ</b> subunit polarizabilities derived from the Clausius–Mossotti relation with those of simulations <b>that</b> <b>employ</b> polarizabilities <b>that</b> include a local environmental correction for subunits near the spheroid’s surface [Rahmani et al. Opt Lett 27 : 2118 (2002)]. The simulations <b>that</b> <b>employ</b> corrected polarizabilities give predictions in very good agreement with exact results obtained by solving Laplace’s equation. In contrast, simulations <b>that</b> <b>employ</b> uncorrected Clausius–Mossotti polarizabilities substantially underestimate the extent of the electric field “hot spot” near the spheroid’s sharp tip, and give predictions for the field enhancement factor near the tip that are 30 to 50 % too small.|$|R
