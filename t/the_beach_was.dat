5|$|The 2nd Devons {{arrived at}} 08:15, while <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>was</b> still under heavy fire. One company stayed {{to help with}} the assault on Le Hamel, while the rest moved to capture the village of Ryes astride the road to Bayeux. Ryes was {{captured}} at around 16:30. The 1st Dorsets attacked a German position on the beach at La Cabane des Douanes and headed inland to arc westward toward the high ground south of Arromanches. They cleared enemy positions at Le Bulot and Puits d'Hérode, and arrived at their destination late in the morning. Joined by elements of the 1st Hampshires and covered by indirect fire from the naval forces offshore, they took Arromanches late in the afternoon.|$|E
5|$|The {{foothold}} gained on D-Day at Omaha, itself two isolated pockets, was {{the most}} tenuous across all the D-Day beaches. With the original objective yet to be achieved, the priority for the Allies was to link up all the Normandy beachheads. During the course of June 7, while still under sporadic shellfire, <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>was</b> prepared as a supply area. Surplus cargo ships were deliberately sunk to form an artificial breakwater and, while still less than planned, 1,429 tons of stores were landed that day.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>beach</b> <b>is</b> {{periodically}} closed due to sewage contamination. See Monterey County Health {{department to}} see if <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>is</b> open.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>beach</b> <b>is</b> {{named after}} <b>the</b> sponsor Streets Ice Cream, and was {{formerly}} known as Kodak <b>Beach.</b> <b>The</b> <b>beach</b> <b>is</b> patrolled year round by lifeguards.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> public {{swimming}} <b>beach</b> <b>is</b> {{located on}} <b>the</b> east {{bank of the}} Etobicoke Creek mouth. <b>The</b> <b>beach</b> <b>is</b> monitored for safe swimming as e.coli bacteria levels rise after rain-storms. <b>The</b> <b>beach</b> closes after major rain storms until levels dissipate. <b>The</b> <b>beach</b> <b>is</b> not one of <b>the</b> Toronto <b>beaches</b> which <b>are</b> part of the Blue Flag program.|$|R
5|$|Casualties {{were around}} 2,000, {{as the men}} were {{subjected}} to fire from the cliffs above. Problems clearing the beach of obstructions led to the beachmaster calling a halt to further landings of vehicles at 08:30. A group of destroyers arrived around this time to provide fire support so landings could resume. Exit from <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>was</b> possible only via five heavily defended gullies, and by late morning barely 600 men had reached the higher ground. By noon, as the artillery fire took its toll and the Germans started {{to run out of}} ammunition, the Americans were able to clear some lanes on the beaches. They also started clearing the gullies of enemy defences so that vehicles could move off the beach. The tenuous beachhead was expanded over the following days, and the D-Day objectives for Omaha were accomplished by D+3.|$|E
5|$|Coastal troop deployments, {{comprising}} five {{companies of}} infantry, were concentrated mostly at 15 strongpoints called Widerstandsnester ("resistance nests"), numbered WN-60 {{in the east}} to WN-74 near Vierville in the west, located primarily around the entrances to the draws and protected by minefields and wire. Positions within each strongpoint were interconnected by trenches and tunnels. As well as the basic weaponry of rifles and machine guns, more than 60 light artillery pieces were deployed at these strongpoints. The heaviest pieces were located in eight gun casemates and four open positions while the lighter guns were housed in 35 pillboxes. A further 18 anti-tank guns completed the disposition of artillery targeting the beach. Areas between the strongpoints were lightly manned with occasional trenches, rifle pits, and 85 machine-gun emplacements. No area of <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>was</b> left uncovered, and the disposition of weapons meant that flanking fire could {{be brought to bear}} anywhere along the beach.|$|E
5|$|Laura Knight {{spent the}} summer of 1908 working on the beaches at Newlyn making studies for her large {{painting}} of children in bright sunlight. <b>The</b> <b>Beach</b> <b>was</b> shown at the Royal Academy in 1909, and was considered a great success, showing Laura painting in a more Impressionist style than she had displayed previously. About this time she began painting compositions {{of women in the}} open air, in the plein-air manner, often on the rocks or cliff-tops around Lamorna. Knight would sometimes use models from London who were prepared to pose nude. Although there was some resentment locally about this, the landowner, a Colonel Paynter, was fully supportive and allowed Knight and the other artists a free rein. Daughters of the Sun, which showed several women, some naked, sitting by a coastal inlet was completed in 1911 and well received when shown at the Royal Academy, but was subsequently damaged and destroyed. In recent years examples of Knight's plein-air compositions from Cornwall have attracted high prices at auction.|$|E
5000|$|Swimming: <b>The</b> <b>beach</b> <b>is</b> mainly rocky {{with a low}} slope, {{except in}} the {{campground}} area where <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>is</b> primarily sand with a sandy lake bottom.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>beach</b> <b>is</b> about 8 {{kilometres}} long. Although not a {{very famous}} tourist attraction, <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>is</b> overcrowded with local tourists during weekends, which indicates its growing popularity.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>beach</b> <b>is</b> {{located in}} <b>the</b> {{southern}} shoreline of Malacca and is facing {{directly to the}} Strait of Malacca. <b>The</b> <b>beach</b> <b>is</b> located next to the 1Malaysia Square.|$|R
5|$|On Sword, 21 of 25 DD {{tanks of}} the first wave were {{successful}} in getting safely ashore to provide cover for the infantry, who began disembarking at 07:30. <b>The</b> <b>beach</b> <b>was</b> heavily mined and peppered with obstacles, making {{the work of the}} beach clearing teams difficult and dangerous. In the windy conditions, the tide came in more quickly than expected, so manoeuvring the armour was difficult. The beach quickly became congested. Brigadier Simon Fraser, 15th Lord Lovat and his 1st Special Service Brigade arrived in the second wave, piped ashore by Private Bill Millin, Lovat's personal piper. Members of No. 4 Commando moved through Ouistreham to attack from the rear a German gun battery on the shore. A concrete observation and control tower at this emplacement had to be bypassed and was not captured until several days later. French forces under Commander Philippe Kieffer (the first French soldiers to arrive in Normandy) attacked and cleared the heavily fortified strongpoint at the casino at Riva Bella, with the aid of one of the DD tanks.|$|E
5|$|Originally, {{seventeen}} sectors {{along the}} Normandy coastline {{had been selected}} as possible invasion sites and each were provided with a code name taken {{from one of the}} spelling alphabets of the time. The coast was divided between Able, west of Omaha, to Rodger on the eastern flank of the invasion area. Eight further sectors were added when the planned invasion was extended to include Utah. Each sector was further subdivided into beaches identified by the colours Green, Red, and White. Gold did not refer to a particular beach but to a landing area. It was delineated by Port-en-Bessin on the west and La Rivière on the east, and included Arromanches, location of one of the artificial Mulberry harbours that were to be constructed shortly after the invasion. High cliffs at the western end of the zone meant that the landings would be undertaken on the flat beach between Le Hamel and La Rivière, in the sectors code-named Jig and King. The area immediately behind <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>was</b> marshy, with open ground and bocage (small fields surrounded by hedges and embankments) further inland. Roads led to the south via Asnelles and Ver-sur-Mer. The terrain to the south-east rose to a ridge at Meuvaines, where on D-Day were located machine gun nests of the German 726th Regiment.|$|E

25|$|Norway Road and Nevil Shute Road at Portsmouth Airport, Hampshire {{were both}} named after him. Shute Avenue in Berwick, Victoria {{was named after}} him, when the farm used for filming the 1959 film On <b>The</b> <b>Beach</b> <b>was</b> {{subdivided}} for housing.|$|E
25|$|In many coastal areas, the {{economic}} impacts {{of a wide}} beach can be substantial. The long shoreline fronting Miami Beach, Florida was replenished over the period 19761981. The project cost approximately $64,000,000 and revitalized the area's economy. Prior to nourishment, in many places <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>was</b> too narrow to walk along, especially during high tide.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of the low}} {{population}} density of nearby areas, and their proximity to the naval base on Portland, the beach and the Fleet were used as an experimental bombing range by the RAF before and during World War II. Additionally during the war <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>was</b> used for machine gun training and Highball bouncing bomb testing.|$|E
50|$|The {{main purpose}} of coming to Matemwe <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> longest <b>beach</b> in Zanzibar. <b>The</b> <b>beach</b> <b>is</b> {{affected}} by <b>the</b> tide, so check tide schedules before visiting <b>the</b> <b>beach.</b> If you <b>are</b> staying there, however, {{that is not a}} problem as the tide is high two times every 24 hours. <b>The</b> <b>beach</b> <b>is</b> very quiet and you will not be harassed by many papasis (beach boys).|$|R

25|$|Between 1896 and 1900, {{the section}} from Revere Beach to Point of Pines, {{formerly}} running along <b>the</b> <b>beach,</b> <b>was</b> relocated inland to lie {{next to the}} Eastern Railroad's abandoned Chelsea Beach Branch. The stations were moved and a new one (Bath House) was built. Revere Beach Boulevard was built later along the former route.|$|E
25|$|Supporters {{claimed that}} 2010's {{seasonal}} summer erosion {{was less than}} in prior years, although <b>the</b> <b>beach</b> <b>was</b> narrower after the restoration ended than in 2008. Authorities were studying whether to require the project to remove the groins immediately. Potential alternatives to geotextile tubes for moving sand included floating dredges and/or trucking in sand dredged offshore.|$|E
25|$|Weston died at {{his home}} on Wildcat Hill on New Year’s Day, 1958. His sons {{scattered}} his ashes into the Pacific Ocean at an area then known as Pebbly Beach on Point Lobos.

25|$|Despite its name, the {{neighborhood}} {{no longer has}} an actual beach. <b>The</b> <b>beach</b> <b>was</b> paved over during the mid-twentieth century to create the Shore Parkway. On the northwestern half, a promenade was constructed to allow residents access to a sea wall. The southwestern half, filled in with land excavated from {{the construction of the}} nearby Verrazano-Narrows Bridge during the 1960s, now houses Bensonhust Park, with ballfields and the Caesar's Bay shopping center.|$|E
