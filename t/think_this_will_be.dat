2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of July, Maroney competed at the Olympic Trials in San Jose, California. [...] After {{the first day of}} competition she said, [...] "I'm thankful that I'm even here. I knew I had to hit vault because it's the most important event for me to make the Olympic team." [...] Though she had falls on both bars and beam on day one, and a major loss of formation on bars during day two, she placed seventh in the all-around with a two-day combined score of 117.650. In event finals, she placed first on vault scoring 31.700 and fifth on floor scoring 29.700. Afterwards, Maroney was chosen {{as a member of the}} team that was sent to the 2012 Summer Olympics. [...] She said, [...] "This is the best feeling – it's just so amazing. I'm in shock right now. I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> the happiest I'll ever be in my life. [...] It's the absolute best feeling knowing that I trained so hard for this and all the hard things that I have accomplished and now to be on this team. [...] These girls are my best friends. [...] My team mate Kyla Ross, we have been best friends since we were six years old so it's just absolutely amazing to be going to the Olympics." [...] When asked about feeling pressure to win gold on vault at the Olympics, she replied, [...] "If I do my job I know I can get the gold medal. [...] That's what they picked me to be on the team for, so I need to be confident about that." ...|$|E

6000|$|Wednesday was fine, {{and soon}} after breakfast the barouche arrived, Mr. Crawford driving his sisters; and as {{everybody}} was ready, {{there was nothing to}} be done but for Mrs. Grant to alight and the others to take their places. The place of all places, the envied seat, the post of honour, was unappropriated. To whose happy lot was it to fall? While each of the Miss Bertrams were meditating how best, and with the most appearance of obliging the others, to secure it, the matter was settled by Mrs. Grant's saying, as she stepped from the carriage, [...] "As there are five of you, it will be better that one should sit with Henry; and as you were saying lately that you wished you could drive, Julia, I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a good opportunity for you to take a lesson." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now it {{may seem}} to many people a very disagreeable idea, that of {{sleeping}} out in snow, but one who has tried it can assure them {{that it is not}} so bad as it seems. No doubt, when Jasper halted in the cold dark woods, and said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a pretty good place to sleep," [...] any one unacquainted with the customs of that country would have thought the man was jesting or mad; for, besides being very dismal, in consequence of its being pitch dark, it was excessively cold, and snow was falling steadily and softly on the ground. But Jasper knew what he was about, and so did the others. Without saying a word, the three men flung down their bundles of provisions, and each set to work to make the encampment. Of course they had to work in darkness so thick that even the white snow could scarcely be seen.|$|E
6000|$|This hint {{produced}} dinner. Mrs. Flockhart, {{smiling in}} her weeds {{like the sun}} through a mist, took {{the head of the}} table, thinking within herself, perhaps, that she cared not how long the rebellion lasted that brought her into company so much above her usual associates. She was supported by Waverley and the Baron, with the advantage of the Chieftain vis-a-vis. The men of peace and of war, that is, Bailie Macwheeble and Ensign Maccombich, after many profound conges to their superiors and each other, took their places {{on each side of the}} Chieftain. Their fare was excellent, time, place, and circumstances considered, and Fergus's spirits were extravagantly high. Regardless of danger, and sanguine from temper, youth, and ambition, he saw in imagination all his prospects crowned with success, and was totally indifferent to the probable alternative of a soldier's grave. The Baron apologized slightly for bringing Macwheeble. They had been providing, he said, for the expenses of the campaign. 'And, by my faith,' said the old man, 'as I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> my last, so I just end where I began: I hae evermore found the sinews of war, as a learned author calls the caisse militaire, mair difficult to come by than either its flesh, blood, or bones.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear," [...] said Lady Aylmer, {{as soon as}} the {{trotting}} {{horses and}} rolling wheels made noise enough to prevent her words from reaching the servants on the box, [...] "I want {{to say a few words}} to you;--and I <b>think</b> that <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a good opportunity." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "When {{history is}} written and {{people talk about}} the great protests, I don't <b>think</b> that <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> in that category."

50|$|The growing {{bond between}} William and Tom is {{threatened}} when William's mother requests {{that the boy}} returns {{to her in the}} city, telling him she is sick. At first, William <b>thinks</b> <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a good thing, as he can be helpful to his mother. However, his mother is not pleased to learn the details of his time with Tom, feeling that he has not been disciplined properly. While William has been away, she has become pregnant and had a girl, but is neglecting the baby. After a bad reunion, where his mother becomes furious upon learning the details of her son's life with Tom, abhorring his association with the Jewish Zach among other things, she hits William around the head which renders him unconscious. She then puts him in the under-stairs cupboard, chains him to the piping and leaves the baby in his arms. William regains consciousness briefly to find himself in the cupboard - he has been stripped of his clothes, minus his underwear, and his ankle is twisted. He quietly sobs for Tom, before he falls asleep.|$|R

5000|$|Following the game, Tennessee {{head coach}} Butch Jones called the venue [...] "a {{spectacle}} ... I don't <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> duplicated or replicated."

We were finally able to run the football and play Tennessee style of football." [...] The Volunteers extend their eight-game winning streak, the longest since their 14 {{in a row in}} the 1998 and 1999 seasons, and the third longest active winning streak in the nation.|$|E

50|$|This {{concept of}} Immersion is used within Speaking Tongues by {{following}} the four main Characters. Durrell, Kelly, Jason, and Julian. Durrell an African American kindergartener attending a Mandarin Immersion school where he is surrounded by his peers who can read and write Chinese. His mother <b>thinks</b> <b>this</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a benefit for Durrell due to the injustice for African American males growing up in this country. Within the film Durrell is able to order a meal using strictly Mandarian. Julian is a Caucasian 8th grader where immersion has brought him to excel in Chinese within school and eventually travel to China. He began studying immersion 9 years prior to 8th grade. Kelly who is Asian American and attends a Cantonese Immersion School. She originally spoke no Chinese prior to this schooling. Kelly’s mom was only able to speaking minimal words in Chinese while growing up same with her father. Jason doesn’t focus on Chinese but instead the bilingualism of being Mexican American immigrant, he attends an English/Spanish Immersion school where {{he is expected to}} speak and work on both languages. The films journey examines all four students and how immersion effected and impacted their lives and futures.|$|R
