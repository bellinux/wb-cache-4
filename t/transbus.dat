25|$|The Alexander Dennis Enviro500 (previously {{known as}} the <b>TransBus</b> Enviro500) is a three-axle {{double-decker}} bus built by Alexander Dennis (formerly by <b>TransBus)</b> in the United Kingdom. It was unveiled in 2002 {{and is one of}} the Enviro-series bus models made by TransBus/Alexander Dennis.|$|E
25|$|In August 2000, Henlys {{entered a}} joint venture with Mayflower Corporation, owners of the Dennis and Alexander brands. The joint venture, known as <b>TransBus</b> International, {{included}} only the United Kingdom bus manufacturing operations of both companies, including Plaxton and Northern Counties. Henlys held a 30% stake in the joint venture, which employed 3,300 employees at seven locations. The traditional brands of Alexander, Dennis and Plaxton were replaced by <b>TransBus</b> International.|$|E
25|$|On 31 March 2004, <b>TransBus</b> International was {{put into}} administration. On 17 May 2004, the Plaxton {{business}} was sold in a management buyout and resumed trading as Plaxton Limited.|$|E
25|$|In May 2007, Plaxton was {{purchased}} by Alexander Dennis, effectively recreating the <b>TransBus</b> International business. But as of late 2008, the Centro bodywork remained in production alongside Alexander Dennis's Enviro200 Dart and Enviro300.|$|E
25|$|When <b>TransBus</b> {{announced}} {{the development of}} the Enviro500, KMB became the launch customer by changing the last 20 of an order for 100 Dennis Trident 3s to the Enviro500 in 2002. Later in the same year, KMB placed an order for a further 100. The first Enviro500 arrived in Hong Kong on 12 November 2002 and was registered in January 2003 with all in service by November 2003.|$|E
25|$|Many {{of these}} were being worked on with Boeing Vertol, who showed both the {{prototype}} SOAC car and the design of their LRV. Similar vehicles were also being developed by other aviation firms, especially Rohr. Rohr was showing their own subway cars that were being produced for BART and the initial models of their proposals for the Washington Metro, as well as <b>Transbus</b> designs from their recently purchased Flxible bus division, who were working on what would emerge {{a few years later}} as the Flxible Metro.|$|E
2500|$|Although much of {{the show}} was {{organized}} to highlight the US's high-tech efforts, the UMTA was also involved {{in a number of}} more [...] "down to earth" [...] projects, including the selection of new busses and trams for existing mass transit networks. Three major projects were ongoing, the US Standard Light Rail Vehicle (LRV); the State of the Art Car (SOAC), a prototype subway car that included all of the most modern features; and the <b>Transbus</b> urban mass transit bus.|$|E
2500|$|Once in place, {{the first}} task of an {{administrator}} is to make proposals to achieve the administration objectives. These {{should be given to}} the registrar and unsecured creditors within 10 weeks, followed by a creditor vote to approve the plans by simple majority. If creditors do not approve the court may make an order as it sees fit. However, before then under Schedule B1, paragraph 59 the administrator can do 'anything necessary or expedient for the management of the affairs, business and property of the company'. In Re <b>Transbus</b> International Ltd Lawrence Collins J made the point that the rules on administration were intended to be [...] "a more flexible, cheaper and comparatively informal alternative to liquidation" [...] and so with regard to doing what is expedient [...] "the fewer applications which need to be made to the court the better." [...] This means that an administrator can sell the whole assets of a company immediately, making the eventual creditors' meeting redundant. Because of this and out of court appointments, since 2002, [...] "pre-packaged administrations" [...] became increasingly popular. Typically the company directors negotiate with their bank, and a prospective administrator, to sell the business to a buyer immediately after entering administration. Often to the company's directors are the buyers. The perceived benefits of this practice, originating in the 1980s in the United States, is that a quick sale without hiring lawyers and expending time or business assets through formalities, can be effected to keep the business running and employees in their jobs. The potential downside is that because a deal is already agreed among the controlling interested parties (directors, insolvency practitioners and the major secured creditor) before broader consultation, unsecured creditors are given no voice, and will recover almost none of their debts. In Re Kayley Vending Ltd, which concerned an in-court appointed administrator, HH Judge Cooke held that a court will ensure that applicants for a prepack administration provide enough information for a court to conclude that the scheme is not being used to unduly disadvantage unsecured creditors. Moreover, while the costs of arranging the prepack before entering administration will count for the purpose of administrator's expenses, it is less likely to do so if the business is sold to the former management. Here the sale of a cigarette vending machine business was to the company's competitors, and so the deal was sufficiently [...] "arm's length" [...] to raise no concern. In their conduct of meetings, the Court of Appeal made clear in Revenue and Customs Commissioners v Maxwell that administrators appointed out of court will be scrutinised in the way they treat unsecured creditors. Here the administrator did not treat the Revenue as having sufficient votes against the company's management buyout proposal, but the court substituted its judgment and stated the number of votes allowed should take account of events all the way in the run up to the meeting, including in this case the Revenue's amended claim for unlawful tax deductions to the managers' trust funds and loans to directors.|$|E
50|$|For part {{of their}} design life, Plaxton was part of <b>TransBus</b> International, during which time the designs were officially {{referred}} to as the <b>TransBus</b> Paragon and <b>TransBus</b> Panther.|$|E
50|$|The Alexander Dennis Enviro300 (previously {{known as}} the <b>TransBus</b> Enviro300) is a {{light-weight}} full-size single-decker bus that was built by Alexander Dennis (previously by its predecessor <b>TransBus</b> International) in the UK between 2001 and 2015.

50|$|In early 2004, a Volvo B9TL {{prototype}} with a facelifted {{version of}} the <b>TransBus</b> Enviro500 body arrived in Hong Kong. It had a slightly different front and rear design, and its rear route box was moved beneath the upper deck rear window. After <b>TransBus</b> International was renamed Alexander Dennis in May 2004, it became the only <b>TransBus</b> Enviro-series bus with a non-Dennis chassis.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{collapse}} of <b>TransBus,</b> the Enviro200 was rebranded as the Alexander Dennis Enviro200 by Alexander Dennis, the successor to <b>TransBus.</b> Only two more first generation Enviro200s were built following {{the collapse}} of <b>TransBus,</b> one diesel and one hybrid vehicle, delivered to Far East Travel of Ipswich in early 2007. This pair, and the original London demonstrator, have since passed to Buses Excetera of Guildford.|$|E
50|$|In 2000, Henlys {{entered a}} joint venture with the Mayflower Corporation, owner of {{bodybuilder}} Alexander and chassis manufacturer Dennis. The joint venture was known as <b>TransBus,</b> and vehicles were badged using the <b>TransBus</b> name.|$|E
50|$|The first {{generation}} Enviro200, {{then known as}} the <b>TransBus</b> Enviro200, was unveiled at Coach & Bus 2003 by the vehicle's then-manufacturer, <b>TransBus</b> International. Two diesel trial buses were initially produced for display in 2003.|$|E
50|$|The Alexander Dennis Enviro200 (previously {{known as}} the <b>TransBus</b> Enviro200) is a midibus {{manufactured}} by <b>TransBus</b> International and later Alexander Dennis since 2003. The original <b>TransBus</b> Enviro200 design was innovative but ultimately unsuccessful, with few being sold before {{the introduction of the}} second generation Enviro200 (originally referred to as the Enviro200 Dart) revived sales for the product from 2006. It was supposed to be positioned in between a minibus and a rigid single-decker bus.|$|E
50|$|The Alexander Dennis Enviro500 (previously {{known as}} the <b>TransBus</b> Enviro500) is a three-axle {{double-decker}} bus built by Alexander Dennis (formerly by <b>TransBus)</b> in the United Kingdom.

50|$|The RTS is the {{descendant}} of GMC's entry for the <b>Transbus</b> project {{which in turn}} was the {{descendant of}} the RTX (Rapid Transit Experimental), an experimental model for which a prototype produced in 1968 with notes of its production dating to early as 1964. Both the RTX and the <b>Transbus</b> were similar in terms of design to the RTS though had major differences in having a less-rounded body design, a one-step entryway, and (in {{the case of the}} <b>Transbus)</b> a 45 ft length.|$|E

On 17 May 2004, the Plaxton coach {{business}} was sold in a management buyout and resumed trading as Plaxton. <b>TransBus</b> {{had been in the}} process of eradicating the traditional company names from the vehicles. On 21 May 2004, the remaining part of <b>TransBus</b> (Alexander and Dennis) was bought by a consortium of merchant bank Noble Grossart and businessmen David Murray and Brian Souter. The new company was named Alexander Dennis. The sale did not include the former Alexander Belfast plant, which closed.|$|E
50|$|The Plaxton President {{was a low}} floor {{double-decker}} bus body built at Northern Counties plant in Wigan, England and branded as a Plaxton product for its main production run. It was unveiled in 1997 and built between 1999 and 2005. When it became part of <b>TransBus</b> International, the body was sold under the <b>TransBus</b> name; strangely never got branded as the Alexander Dennis President after ADL bought <b>Transbus.</b> The President {{was built on the}} Dennis/TransBus Trident, the DAF DB250 and the Volvo B7TL chassis. It can be built as either a closed top bus or an open-top bus.|$|E
50|$|In August 2000, with {{continuing}} {{domestic sales}} difficulties, {{a joint venture}} was formed with Mayflower, now owners of the Dennis and Alexander brands.
