In 50 billion years, if the Earth and Moon are not engulfed by the Sun, they will become tidelocked, with each showing only one face to the other. Thereafter, the tidal action of the Sun will extract angular momentum from the system, causing the lunar orbit to decay and the Earth's spin <b>to</b> <b>accelerate.</b>|$|E

5|$|Broasting uses a {{pressure}} cooker <b>to</b> <b>accelerate</b> the process. The moisture inside the chicken becomes steam {{and increases the}} pressure in the cooker, lowering the cooking temperature needed. The steam also cooks the chicken through, but still allows the pieces to be moist and tender while maintaining a crisp coating. Fat is heated in {{a pressure}} cooker. Chicken pieces are prepared as described above and then placed in the hot fat. The lid {{is placed on the}} pressure cooker, and the chicken pieces are thus fried under pressure.|$|E
5|$|Coherent {{units are}} derived units that contain no {{numerical}} factor other than 1—quantities such as standard gravity and density of water are absent from their definitions.

Since the SI units of mass and acceleration are kg and m·s−2 respectively and , the units of force (and hence of newtons) is formed by multiplication to give kg·m·s−2. Since the newton {{is part of a}} coherent set of units, the constant of proportionality is 1.|$|E
