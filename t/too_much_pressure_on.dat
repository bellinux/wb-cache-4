25|$|Sore nipples (nipple pain, or thelalgia) are {{probably}} the most common complaint after the birth. They are generally reported by the second day after delivery but improve within 5 days. Pain beyond the first week, severe pain, cracking, fissures or localized swelling is not normal. The mother should see a doctor for further evaluation. Sore nipples, a common cause of pain, often come from the baby not latching on properly. Factors include <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the nipple when not enough of the areola is latched onto and an improper release of suction {{at the end of the}} feeding. Improper use of breast pumps or topical remedies can also contribute. Nipple pain can also be a sign of infection. When the baby bites the nipple it can also be painful.|$|E

500|$|Dutch {{journalist}} Michiel Jongsma {{suggests that}} Kieftenbeld's position {{of choice is}} as a holding midfielder {{in front of the}} defence, where he can best use his energy in recovering the ball. He is comfortable on the ball and able to distribute it, but can be careless in possession, and [...] "he really tries to shake up things when the play has gone dormant. In that lies his weakness as wellhe can pick up silly fouls and cards from time to time." [...] With Groningen, he averaged eight yellow cards a season. According to Groningen's technical director Henk Veldmate, speaking in 2014, his battling style and never-say-die attitude made him the sort of player with whom supporters could identify.

After his Wimbledon loss to Kyrgios, Raonic commented that his foot injury had led to problems throughout his body: [...] "There wasn't a place it wasn't ...

A busy mother, whose job as housewife and carer of other children was jeopardised by having to stay away from the home, was caused great inconvenience and trouble, and it was unrealistic and put <b>too</b> <b>much</b> unnecessary <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the mother (and the family) to insist that she stay with the child.

500|$|On {{aggregate}} site Metacritic, Pandora's Tower {{received a}} score of 73/100 based on 48 critic reviews, denoting [...] "mixed or average" [...] reception. Destructoid's Tony Ponce praised the game's premise and how fleshed out Elena was despite {{her role as a}} damsel in distress, but felt that there was too much background lore, and that Aeron's lack of personality hurt the relationship aspect. Andrew Fitch, writing for Electronic Gaming Monthly, praised the world design, but faulted the lack of character development given to Aeron and Elena. Eurogamer's Matt Edwards referred to the game's plot as [...] "a soppy and yet surprisingly sinister love story", saying that moments between the couple raised a genuine smile. IGN's Chris Schilling said that while the story was [...] "slight", it was bolstered by a good localization and voice acting, in addition to darker elements in the plot and during cutscenes. GameSpot's Ashton Raze praised Aeron and Elena's romance as [...] "a grounded, human [...] in a world of monsters". Heidi Kemps, writing for Joystiq, noted genuine emotion in the relationship mechanics of Aeron and Elema, while Steve Hogarty of Official Nintendo Magazine referred to the scenario as [...] "a boy-meets-girl love story with a Clive Barker twist" [...] in addition to praising its dark tone. The game's time limit mechanic and its impact on Elena's condition divided opinion: some praised its implementation, but some critics noted that it might put <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> the player.|$|E

5000|$|The Thames skiff {{owes its}} origins to the viking boat {{building}} method of over-lapping timber planking known as clinker construction. Many {{of the terms}} used for parts of the skiff are of Scandinavian origin - “tholes”, “thwarts”, and “sax”. Planks {{on either side of}} a wooden keel are laid down following the outline of a sham (temporary pattern) placed across the keel. The planks are nailed in place and then a strengthening framework of ribs is added. Oars (or blades) are held in place by wooden thole pins {{at the side of the}} boat rather than rowlocks or outriggers. The thole pins are designed to give way if <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>pressure</b> is put <b>on</b> them, thus protecting the boat itself from damage. The thwart, or seat, is fixed rather than sliding as in modern boats. The sax runs round the top of the boat to strengthen and protect it. [...] Blades are made of wood with leather collars.|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>pressure</b> being placed <b>on</b> <b>too</b> little or already {{degraded}} land is a depressingly familiar theme running through many books on {{development in the}} Third World. Working with fanners for better land husbandry looks at current approaches to soil and water management {{through a series of}} case studies in several countries of East and Southern Africa. There are examples of the opportunities and benefits of improved farming methods case studies where {{an important part of the}} experience is stimulating community developments; and case studies with more emphasis on the methods and techniques used to promote better land husbandry. The book strikes a cautious but optimistic note and suggests that whilst there are lessons to be learnt for the future, there are, nevertheless, reasons to be hopeful. Soil conservation and sustainable land use takes a more global perspective. There is more emphasis on how and why degradation has occurred supported by tables which show general development indicators agricultural sector and demographic indicators, land use and climatic indicators; natural resources and resource use indicators; as well as soil erosion worldwide. These serve to high-light, perhaps more dramaticaIy than text, the results of cause and effect. Although this book is far more statistically analytical than the first, the underlying theme and message of both are basically the same. In the final analysis, farmers do understand what is best for their land: it is the parameters within which they often have to work that prevent them from putting into practice what they know in their hearts. They are well aware that failure to implement sound practices means death - death of their land: but often they are given no alternative.

In a 2004 interview Mayweather said that although he loves his father, he had a better chemistry with Roger because his father had put <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> him to be perfect.

Speaking of growing up in such a successful tennis family, Safina stated: [...] "Being the little sister in such a big tennis family is not an easy situation. Maybe that's why it took me longer to develop. My father is very competitive, but my parents didn't put pressure on me. I wanted to find my identity. I wanted to be something by myself, like being a big player by myself. So at the beginning I was putting <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>on</b> myself.

Fisheye lenses and poorly framed close-ups abound in Les Misérables, nearly every frame a revelation of one man's bad taste ... One would be hard-pressed to describe this, despite the wealth of beauty on display, as anything but an ugly film, shot and cut ineptly. Everything in the film, songs included, is cranked to 11, the melodrama of it all soaring. So it's odd that this kind of showboating maximalism should be ultimately reduced to a few fisheye'd faces, mugging for their close-up, as the people sing off-key and broken." [...] Chicago Tribune critic Michael Philips gave the film only one and a half stars, writing: [...] "The camera bobs and weaves like a drunk, frantically. So you have hammering close-ups, combined with woozy insecurity each time more than two people are in the frame. ...too little in this frenzied mess of a film registers because Hooper is trying to make everything register at the same nutty pitch." ...|$|E
