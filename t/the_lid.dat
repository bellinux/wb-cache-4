50|$|Ptosis {{associated}} with CPEO may be corrected with surgery to raise <b>the</b> <b>lids,</b> however due to {{weakness of the}} orbicularis oculi muscles, {{care must be taken}} not to raise <b>the</b> <b>lids</b> in excess causing an inability to close <b>the</b> <b>lids.</b> This results in an exposure keratopathy. Therefore, rarely should lid surgery be performed and only by a neuro-ophthalmologist familiar with the disease.|$|R
25|$|CPEO is a slowly {{progressing}} disease. It {{may begin}} {{at any age}} and progresses {{over a period of}} 5–15 years. The first presenting symptom of ptosis is often unnoticed by the patient until <b>the</b> <b>lids</b> droop to <b>the</b> point of producing a visual field defect. Often, patients will tilt the head backwards to adjust for the slowly progressing ptosis of <b>the</b> <b>lids.</b> In addition, as the ptosis becomes complete, the patients will use the frontalis (forehead) muscle to help elevate <b>the</b> <b>lids.</b> <b>The</b> ptosis is typically bilateral, but may be unilateral for a period of months to years before <b>the</b> fellow <b>lid</b> becomes involved.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>lidded</b> wagon {{with several}} [...] "roof" [...] hatches or lids {{that can be}} opened upwards is the oldest type and is rarely seen today. Its {{disadvantage}} was that the bars to which <b>the</b> <b>lids</b> were attached meant they could only be opened individually.|$|R
5|$|The {{main event}} was next, {{featuring}} The Undertaker versus Yokozuna in a casket match with Chuck Norris as the special outside referee. The Undertaker gained the early advantage, but Yokozuna reversed the momentum with a Samoan drop. He {{tried to put}} The Undertaker in the casket, but The Undertaker fought back. Yokozuna next performed a leg drop and placed The Undertaker in the casket. Before Yokozuna could close <b>the</b> <b>lid,</b> however, The Undertaker attacked him and the two wrestlers fought while standing in the casket. The Undertaker performed a clothesline from the top rope and placed Yokozuna in the casket. King Kong Bundy and Bam Bam Bigelow came down the aisle toward the ring, but Chuck Norris blocked their path. While Norris was distracted, however, Irwin R. Schyster entered the ring {{from the other side}} and attacked The Undertaker. He placed The Undertaker in the casket, but The Undertaker recovered before Yokozuna could close <b>the</b> <b>lid.</b> Jeff Jarrett tried to interfere on Yokozuna's behalf, but Norris stopped him with a superkick. The Undertaker performed a DDT and a big boot on Yokozuna. He then rolled his opponent in to the casket and closed <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> to gain the victory.|$|E
5|$|Two unusual bag-like {{structures}} were present on each pitcher, one {{on either side}} of the central wing.

5|$|As the geyser fills, {{the water}} {{at the top of}} the column cools off, but because of the narrowness of the channel, {{convective}} cooling of the water in the reservoir is impossible. The cooler water above presses down on the hotter water beneath, not unlike <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> of a pressure cooker, allowing the water in the reservoir to become superheated, i.e. to remain liquid at temperatures well above the standard-pressure boiling point.|$|E

5|$|Because {{potassium}} {{reacts with}} water vapor in the air, {{it is usually}} stored under anhydrous mineral oil or kerosene. Unlike lithium and sodium, however, potassium should not be stored under oil for longer than 6 months, unless in an inert (oxygen free) atmosphere, or under vacuum. After prolonged storage in air dangerous shock-sensitive peroxides can form on the metal and under <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> of the container, and can detonate upon opening.|$|E

The album also featured a sensitive song, Mä uskon huomispäivään ("I Believe in Tomorrow"). Other well-known songs from the album are Playboy 60 v ("Playboy 60 yrs"), Suomi–Ruotsi ("Finland–Sweden") and Taas lapsuuden maisemiin ("Back Again to Where I Grew Up").|$|E
5|$|In {{front of}} the Presiding Officers' desk is the {{parliamentary}} mace, which is made from silver and inlaid with gold panned from Scottish rivers and inscribed with the words: Wisdom, Compassion, Justice and Integrity. The words There shall be a Scottish Parliament, which are the first words of the Scotland Act, are inscribed around {{the head of the}} mace, which has a ceremonial role in the meetings of Parliament, representing the authority of the Parliament to make laws. Presented to the Scottish Parliament by the Queen upon Parliament's official opening in July 1999, the mace is displayed in a glass case, suspended from <b>the</b> <b>lid.</b> At the beginning of each sitting in the chamber, <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> of the case is rotated so that the mace is above the glass, to symbolise that a full meeting of the Parliament is taking place.|$|E

5|$|Only recently, the {{assembly}} {{process of the}} 19S regulatory particle has been elucidated to considerable extent. The 19S regulatory particle assembles as two distinct subcomponents, the base and <b>the</b> <b>lid.</b> Assembly of the base complex is facilitated by four assembly chaperones, Hsm3/S5b, Nas2/p27, Rpn14/PAAF1, and Nas6/gankyrin (names for yeast/mammals). These assembly chaperones bind to the AAA-ATPase subunits and their main function {{seems to be to}} ensure proper assembly of the heterohexameric AAA-ATPase ring. To date it is still under debate whether the base complex assembles separately, whether {{the assembly}} is templated by the 20S core particle, or whether alternative assembly pathways exist. In addition to the four assembly chaperones, the deubiquitinating enzyme Ubp6/Usp14 also promotes base assembly, but it is not essential. <b>The</b> <b>lid</b> assembles separately in a specific order and does not require assembly chaperones.|$|E
5|$|The {{bodies of}} the Zenbooks are made of aluminium, chosen for its light weight, strength, {{vibration}} dampening, appearance and acoustic properties. Both the bodies and lids are CNC milled and brushed for appearance. Reviewers have noted the resulting superior rigidity and complimented {{the appearance of the}} Zenbook range. <b>The</b> <b>lid</b> is available in three colours: dark silver/purple (pictured), rose gold and hot pink.|$|E
50|$|Modern thermal cyclers are {{equipped}} with a heated lid that presses against <b>the</b> <b>lids</b> of <b>the</b> reaction tubes.

5|$|A {{waterfall}} bong (or {{reverse bucket}} bong) is another method of smoking. It is assembled using a large plastic bottle (preferably about 2 liter), a bung or rubber stopper, a brass cut nozzle {{to act as}} a bowl and keep the marijuana (or other herbs) from entering the bottle, and an aerator screen. Once the bottle is filled to its neck in water <b>the</b> <b>lid</b> is screwed on, removing the rubber stopper and igniting the contents of the bowl leads to draining water to cause smoke to be drawn into the bottle. The cap is removed after the water has completely drained out, allowing the user to inhale the smoke.|$|E
5|$|Broasting uses a {{pressure}} cooker {{to accelerate the}} process. The moisture inside the chicken becomes steam and increases the pressure in the cooker, lowering the cooking temperature needed. The steam also cooks the chicken through, but still allows the pieces to be moist and tender while maintaining a crisp coating. Fat is heated in {{a pressure}} cooker. Chicken pieces are prepared as described above and then placed in the hot fat. <b>The</b> <b>lid</b> {{is placed on the}} pressure cooker, and the chicken pieces are thus fried under pressure.|$|E
5|$|Burial 116 is {{the tomb}} of Jasaw Chan K'awiil I. It is a large vaulted chamber deep within the pyramid, {{below the level of}} the Great Plaza. The tomb {{contained}} rich offerings of jadeite, ceramics, shell and works of art. The body of the king was covered with large quantities of jade ornaments including an enormous necklace with especially large beads, as depicted in sculpted portraits of the king.
