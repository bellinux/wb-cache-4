40|$|This {{research}} is the first that examined tweens’ appreciation {{of the use of}} realism and complexity in photography on book covers for children. Additionally, the level of agreement between tweens’ preferences and what adults think <b>tweens</b> appreciate is explored. Data were obtained through questionnaires filled in by 49 younger <b>tweens,</b> 44 older <b>tweens</b> and 125 adults. The results partly confirm the hypothesis that <b>tweens</b> prefer realistic photographs on book covers to unrealistic photographs. Results on the appreciation of the use of complexity in photography on book covers offer suggestions for future research. Next to that, the results showed that adults correctly infer the preferences of younger <b>tweens,</b> but incorrectly for older <b>tweens.</b> Finally, scientific and practical implications are discussed and suggestions for future research are presented...|$|R

40|$|Introduction The {{level of}} {{physical}} activity among children is a growing concern. Evidence shows that many children aged 9 to 13 years (<b>tweens)</b> {{do not participate in}} any organized physical activity during their nonschool hours, and some do not engage in any free-time physical activity. Physical inactivity is associated with a host of chronic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Paid media advertisements have been an effective method of promoting physical activity. Methods From March 10, 2003, through June 29, 2003, we aired paid radio advertisements in six major Arkansas metropolitan areas to promote physical activity among <b>tweens.</b> In September 2003, we surveyed 295 Arkansas <b>tweens</b> by telephone to assess their exposure to the advertisements and the impact of the advertisements on their intent to participate in physical activity. In the same telephone survey, we also asked questions about the respondents’ physical activity level. The data were weighted so that the results would be representative of the areas surveyed. The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS, version 11. 5 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill). Results Of the <b>tweens</b> surveyed, 56. 4 % (95 % confidence interval [CI], 50. 7 %– 62. 1 %) reported hearing the radio advertisements. Of the <b>tweens</b> who heard the advertisement messages, 76. 1 % (95 % CI, 69. 4 %– 82. 8 %) said the messages made them more likely to get involved in physical activity. Younger <b>tweens</b> (aged 9 and 10 years) were less likely to have heard the advertisements than older <b>tweens</b> (aged 11 to 13 years). However, the advertisements were more likely to cause younger <b>tweens</b> to want to get involved in physical activity (odds ratio [OR] = 6. 89, P =. 003) than older <b>tweens.</b> Of the <b>tweens</b> surveyed, 74. 9 % (95 % CI, 70. 0 %– 79. 8 %) reported that they were involved in nonschool-sponsored sports, and 45. 3 % (95 % CI, 39. 6 %– 51. 0 %) were involved in school-sponsored sports. Conclusion Paid media advertisements may be an effective way to promote physical activity among <b>tweens.</b> More rigorous evaluations of the impact of paid media advertisements among <b>tweens,</b> with larger samples and additional media markets, are needed. Future physical activity promotion efforts should focus on encouraging participation in school-sponsored sports and creating community environments conducive to physical activity...|$|R

The series centers on an ambitious and expressive <b>tween</b> fly named Maggie Pesky {{and her family}} and friends. The show is set in Stickyfeet, a city for insects located in a dump. While conceptualizing the series, Polsky wanted it to contain a playful aspect at adolescence and director Dave Wasson formed the overall look of the characters, being heavily influenced by early Walt Disney cartoon shorts. The Buzz on Maggie was Disney's first series to be fully animated in Adobe Flash, a process done by Bardel Entertainment and Future Thought Productions.|$|E

40|$|Research {{suggests}} that children influence family vacation decision-making. However, {{with few exceptions}} parents act as respondents in studies of family vacation decision-making and furthermore, children’s role is often defined as a rather passive one. Thus, it is often assumed that although children might explicate wishes pertaining to holidays, they generally submit to whatever choices their parents make. In recent years, marketing researchers have taken {{a keen interest in}} the so-called ‘tweens’, people who are 8 to 12 years old and in between childhood and the teenage years. One key finding of research on <b>tweens</b> is that <b>tweens</b> are consumers in their own rights – especially in regard to consumption of products such as cellular phones, clothing, magazines, music and movies. However, little research focuses on <b>tweens</b> and vacations and accordingly, we know very little about <b>tweens</b> as consumers of tourism. Drawing on 89 qualitative interviews, we suggest that <b>tweens</b> as consumers of tourism differ profoundly from the traditional role of children in tourism consumption. The paper shows that <b>tweens</b> are highly experienced tourists; very active during up-front vacation decision-making; and wish for (and have) a say in regard to issues such as destination choice. Consequently, we argue that <b>tweens</b> should be given voice in future research on tourism consumption if we wish to gain knowledge on families as consumers of tourism...|$|R
40|$|Looking Good and Taking Care: Consumer Culture, Identity, and Poor, Minority, Urban <b>Tweens</b> is an ethnographic {{examination}} of how poor, minority, urban <b>tweens</b> (age 7 - 14) use consumer culture {{to create and}} perform their personal and social identities. Although portrayed in mass media as selfish and hedonistic, this work finds <b>tweens</b> creating profoundly social, giving, and caring identities and relationships through consumption. Their use of consumer culture is also a form of political resistance that subverts {{their place in the}} age, class, and race hierarchy. These <b>tweens</b> use “looking good” (attention to grooming, style, and behaving respectably), and not name brand goods, to show they have respect for themselves, that their families care about them, and that, by extension, society in general should care for and about them. Far from seeking status through consuming, the <b>tweens</b> largely seek belonging and care. They also utilize both consumption and denial of their consumer desires to show care for their families. Furthermore, the <b>tweens</b> use consumer culture to enact resistance against the most tangible form of social control in their lives—school—by employing products and consumer knowledge to subvert the rules of uniforms and structured school time...|$|R
40|$|Several glycols and <b>Tweens</b> {{markedly}} {{stimulated the}} production of ergot alkaloids in submerged cultures of Claviceps paspali. The role of these compounds was investigated in shake flasks and bench-scale fermentors. 2, 3 -Butanediol was not utilized by the fungus, and 1, 2 -propanediol- 1 - 14 C was not incorporated into the alkaloids. Glycols and <b>Tweens</b> lowered the surface tension of the basal medium and promoted the utilization of metabolites. In the presence of glycols and <b>Tweens,</b> an increased uptake of labeled sorbitol and succinic acid took place, whereas the specific radioactivity of the alkaloids was not affected. These results indicated that glycols and <b>Tweens</b> are not involved directly in the biosynthetic process; they apparently acted as surface-active agents, facilitating transport of metabolites into the cells...|$|R

From Europe and from Canada general cargo was carried to the West Indies and to Central America, from Canada to Europe the vessels were mainly carrying paper and aluminium products. From the mines of Mackenzie, on Demerara River in Guyana, the <b>tween</b> deck cargo vessels mainly carried bauxite to the aluminium plant in Port Alfred, Canada. Sometimes also a full cargo of sugar from Cuba or from Guyana was carried up to Northern America. On a normal voyage usually three to five ports were visited, especially in the West Indies, among others, Georgetown, Mackenzie in Guyana, Port of Spain on Trinidad, ports in Venezuela, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guatemala, the ports of Cuba and Haiti and Jamaica, Santo Domingo, Domenican Republic, Puerto Rico, and the islands of Barbados, Domenica, Grenada and St. Vincent. However the voyages did change, depending on cargo availability and other operational requirements. In North America, the main ports were Montreal, Port Alfred up the Saguenay River in Quebec, Halifax, Saint John (New Brunswick) and New York. In summer time the ships went to the ports in the St. Lawrence River, but in winter time Sunadele/Sunamelia were diverted to the ice-free ports of Halifax and Saint John. In Europe usually the ships called at Antwerp, Hamburg, Rotterdam, and in the U.K. at Avonmouth, Cardiff, Liverpool, London and Glasgow.|$|E

500|$|By {{the late}} 1990s Mattel had {{dominated}} the fashion doll market since the 1959 release of their Barbie doll. At the 1997 peak they held more than 90% of the market. MGA Entertainment released Bratz in 2001. With big heads and pouty lips they {{appealed to the}} 8- to 12-year-old <b>tween</b> market group. Bratz achieved great success and gradually took {{over some of the}} more wholesome Barbie doll's market share. Meanwhile, the market for Barbie grew younger. By 2003 the main market was 3- to 6-year-olds and Barbie's share of the fashion doll market had dropped to about 70%. In fall 2002 Mattel released My Scene, a line of redesigned Barbie dolls, in a bid to appeal to tweens and compete with Bratz. But they failed to reverse the company's faltering sales. Less than a year after the My Scene release, Flavas were launched in summer 2003 in a second attempt to appeal to the <b>tween</b> market and offer competition to Bratz. Production began only three months after Flavas were designed, and The New York Times described their launch as being rushed. The New York Times said that Flavas [...] "appeared to be heavily inspired" [...] by Bratz while Newsweek described Bratz as the [...] "anti-Barbie" [...] and Flavas as Mattel's [...] "anti-Barbie of its own."

40|$|<b>Tweens,</b> {{children}} between 7 - 12 years old, {{is a relative}} new focus in the expanding field of consumer research in the Nordic countries. The relation between consumption and <b>tweens</b> has been studied extensively during the past ten years.
