30|$|According to the BP Statistical Review of World Energy (2015 a), China is the world’s largest energy consumer, {{with the}} total energy {{consumption}} of about 4.3 billion <b>tonnes</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> <b>equivalent,</b> which accounts for about 23  % of the world’s total energy consumption. Although coal consumption still accounts for an absolutely dominant proportion, about 66  % of the total energy consumption, oil consumption accounts for 17.5  %, and natural gas accounts for 5.6  % in 2014 (BP 2015 a). Plans aiming to adjust China’s energy structure are already on schedule. The State Council of China has claimed that by 2020, natural gas consumption is planned to account for 10  % of the primary energy consumption, the proportion of non-fossil fuel consumption {{would be more than}} 15  %, and the proportion <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> consumption should be controlled to below 62  % (State Council of China 2014). To successfully achieve the goal, it is urgent to take effective actions to reduce carbon emissions, to fully explore the potential of natural gas and non-fossil energy, and to have clean energy sources as feasible alternatives.|$|R

40|$|Input-output {{analysis}} {{has been proven}} to be a powerful instrument for estimating embodied (direct plus indirect) energy usage through economic sectors. Using 9 economic input-output tables of years 1987, 1990, 1992, 1995, 1997, 2000, 2002, 2005, and 2007, this paper analyzes energy flows for the entire city of Beijing and its 30 economic sectors, respectively. Results show that the embodied energy consumption of Beijing increased from 38. 85 million <b>tonnes</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> <b>equivalent</b> (Mtce) to 206. 2 Mtce over the past twenty years of rapid urbanization; the share of indirect energy consumption in total energy consumption increased from 48 % to 76 %, suggesting the transition of Beijing from a production-based and manufacturing-dominated economy to a consumption-based and service-dominated economy. Real estate development has shown to be a major driving factor of the growth in indirect energy consumption. The boom and bust of construction activities have been strongly correlated with the increase and decrease of system-side indirect energy consumption. Traditional heavy industries remain the most energy-intensive sectors in the economy. However, the transportation and service sectors have contributed most to the rapid increase in overall energy consumption. The analyses in this paper demonstrate that a system-wide approach such as that based on input-output model can be a useful tool for robust energy policy making...|$|R

40|$|After {{over two}} decades of {{staggering}} economic growth and soaring energy demand, China has started taking serious actions to reduce its economic energy and carbon intensity by setting short and medium-term intensity reduction targets, renewable generation targets and various supporting policies and programs. In better understanding how further policies and actions {{can be taken to}} shape China's future energy and emissions trajectory, it is important to first identify where the largest opportunities for efficiency gains and emission reduction lie from sectoral and end-use perspectives. Besides contextualizing China's progress towards reaching the highest possible efficiency levels through the adoption of the most advanced technologies from a bottom-up perspective, the actual economic costs and benefits of adopting efficiency measures are also assessed in this study. This study presents two modeling methodologies that evaluate both the technical and economic potential of raising China's efficiency levels to the technical maximum across sectors and the subsequent carbon and energy emission implications through 2030. The technical savings potential by efficiency measure and remaining gap for improvements are identified by comparing a reference scenario in which China continues the current pace of with a Max Tech scenario in which the highest technically feasible efficiencies and advanced technologies are adopted irrespective of costs. In addition, from an economic perspective, a cost analysis of selected measures in the key industries of cement and iron and steel help quantify the actual costs and benefits of achieving the highest efficiency levels through the development of cost of conserved energy curves for the sectors. The results of this study show that total annual energy savings potential of over one billion <b>tonne</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> <b>equivalent</b> exists beyond the expected reference pathway under Max Tech pathway in 2030. CO 2 emissions will also peak earlier under Max Tech, though the 2020 s is a likely turning point for both emission trajectories. Both emission pathways must meet all announced and planned policies, targets and non-fossil generation targets, or an even wider efficiency gap will exist. The savings potential under Max Tech varies by sector, but the industrial sector appears to hold the largest energy savings and emission reduction potential. The primary source of savings is from electricity rather than fuel, and electricity savings are magnified by power sector decarbonization through increasing renewable generation and coal generation efficiency improvement. In order to achieve the maximum energy savings and emission reduction potential, efficiency improvements and technology switching must be undertaken across demand sectors {{as well as in the}} growing power sector. From an economic perspective, the cost of conserved energy analysis indicates that nearly all measures for the iron and steel and cement industry are cost-effective. All 23 efficiency measures analyzed for the cement industry are cost-effective, with combined CO 2 emission reduction potential of 448 Mt CO 2. All of the electricity savings measures in the iron and steel industry are cost-effective, but the cost-effective savings potential for fuel savings measures is slightly lower than total technical savings potential. The total potential savings from these measures confirm the magnitude of savings in the scenario models, and illustrate the remaining efficiency gap in the cement and iron and steel industries...|$|E
30|$|China has {{achieved}} {{rapid economic growth}} since beginning its reform and opening up in the 1980 s, with an average annual GDP growth rate of 9.8 % from 1978 to 2014 (NBSC 2015). China has now become the second-largest {{economy in the world}} after the USA. This great achievement could not have been possible without high energy consumption. From 1978 to 2014, China’s total annual energy consumption increased from just over 570 million <b>tonnes</b> <b>of</b> <b>coal</b> <b>equivalent</b> per year (Mtce/year) to 4260  Mtce/year, representing an average annual growth rate of 5.8 % (NBSC 2015). Moreover, most of this energy has been from fossil fuels. In 2014, for example, China’s total fossil fuel consumption was 3780  Mtce/year (coal, 2810  Mtce; oil, 730  Mtce; gas, 240  Mtce), accounting for just under 90 % of total energy consumption (the remaining 10 % is renewable energy) (NBSC 2015). A large number of studies have indicated that fossil fuels will continue to dominate China’s energy consumption and that demand for these fuels will keep increasing in future, although the rate of this increase may be much lower than in the past, and the structure may also be changed (i.e. stabilizing oil’s share, increasing gas’s share, and reducing coal’s share in primary energy use) (Yuan et al. 2016; IEA 2014). It is thus very important for China to understand its supply status in terms of fossil fuel resources.|$|R
