5|$|Mayan {{languages}} {{tend to have}} a rich set of grammatical voices. Proto-Mayan had {{at least}} one passive construction as well as an antipassive rule for downplaying the importance of the agent in relation to the patient. Modern K'iche' has two antipassives: one which ascribes focus to the object and another <b>that</b> <b>emphasizes</b> <b>the</b> verbal action. Other voice-related constructions occurring in Mayan languages are the following: mediopassive, incorporational (incorporating a direct object into the verb), instrumental (promoting the instrument to object position) and referential (a kind of applicative promoting an indirect argument such as a benefactive or recipient to the object position).|$|E
5|$|Males {{are also}} {{affected}} by societal expectations, such as notions about masculinity and sexual prowess. Men from some traditional backgrounds may feel performance pressure <b>that</b> <b>emphasizes</b> <b>the</b> {{ability to have}} erections and sexual intercourse. Men who have strong sexual desire but who {{are not able to}} perform sexually may be at increased risk for depression, particularly when they believe strongly in traditional masculine gender norms with sexual function as core to the male identity. Men who strongly believe in these traditional roles may feel sexually inadequate, unmanly, insecure, and less satisfied with life. Since sexual dysfunction has this negative impact on self-esteem, treatment of erectile dysfunction can have a psychological benefit even though it does not help with physical sensation. SCI may necessitate reappraisal and rejection of assumptions about gender norms and sexual function in order to adjust healthily to the disability: those who are able to change the way they think about gender roles may have better life satisfaction and outcomes with rehabilitation. Counseling is helpful in this reassessment process.|$|E

25|$|The 1925 Chapel of the Transfiguration {{catered to}} the tourist trade. Built and owned by St. John's Episcopal Church, the chapel was built near Menor's Ferry, {{in an area}} that became known as Moose. The grounds and church {{interior}} focus on the Cathedral Group of peaks, all in a consciously rustic style <b>that</b> <b>emphasizes</b> <b>the</b> natural environment over the built environment. The Chapel of the Sacred Heart was built in similar rustic style near Signal Mountain by the Our Lady of the Mountains Catholic Church of Jackson in 1958.|$|E
25|$|According to William Cohn, {{television}} programs are typically {{the main source}} used by the American public to know about and interpret the past. The Soviet media proved somewhat disorganized as it was unable to generate a coherent popular history. Khrushchev lost power and was airbrushed out of the story. Cuba was no longer portrayed as a heroic David against the American Goliath. One contradiction that pervaded the Soviet media campaign was between the pacifistic rhetoric of the peace movement <b>that</b> <b>emphasizes</b> <b>the</b> horrors of nuclear war and the militancy {{of the need to}} prepare Soviets for war against American aggression.|$|E
25|$|Akha {{religion}} — zahv — {{is often}} described as a mixture of animism and ancestor worship <b>that</b> <b>emphasizes</b> <b>the</b> Akha connection with the land and their place in the natural world and cycles. Although Akha beliefs and rituals involve all of these elements, the Akha often reject the casual categorization of their practices as such saying it simplifies and reduces its meaning. The Akha way emphasizes rituals in everyday life and stresses strong family ties. Akha ethnicity is closely tied to the Akha religion. It might be said that to be considered an Akha ethnically by other Akhas is to practice the Akha religion.|$|E

25|$|When {{biologists}} {{interested in}} evolution theory first started examining social behaviour, some apparently unanswerable questions arose, {{such as how}} the birth of sterile castes, like in bees, could be explained through an evolving mechanism <b>that</b> <b>emphasizes</b> <b>the</b> reproductive success of as many individuals as possible, or why, amongst animals living in small groups like squirrels, an individual would risk its own life to save {{the rest of the}} group. These behaviours may be examples of altruism. Of course, not all behaviours are altruistic, as indicated by the table below. For example, revengeful behaviour was at one point claimed to have been observed exclusively in Homo sapiens. However, other species have been reported to be vengeful including chimpanzees, as well as anecdotal reports of vengeful camels.|$|E
25|$|Reform Judaism (also {{known as}} Liberal Judaism or Progressive Judaism) {{is a major}} Jewish {{denomination}} <b>that</b> <b>emphasizes</b> <b>the</b> evolving nature of the faith, the superiority of its ethical aspects to the ceremonial ones, and a belief in a continuous revelation not centered on the theophany at Mount Sinai. A liberal strand of Judaism, it {{is characterized by a}} lesser stress on ritual and personal observance, regarding Jewish Law as non-binding and the individual Jew as autonomous, and openness to external influences and progressive values. The origins of Reform Judaism lay in 19th-century Germany, where its early principles were formulated by Rabbi Abraham Geiger and his associates; since the 1970s, the movement adopted a policy of inclusiveness and acceptance, inviting as many as possible to partake in its communities, rather than strict theoretical clarity. Its greatest center today is in North America.|$|E
25|$|Fostering {{resilience}} {{in children}} requires family environments that are caring and stable, hold {{high expectations for}} children’s behavior and encourage participation {{in the life of}} the family. Most resilient children have a strong relationship with at least one adult, not always a parent, and this relationship helps to diminish risk associated with family discord. The definition of parental resilience, as the capacity of parents to deliver a competent and quality level of parenting to children, despite the presence of risk factors, has proven to be a very important role in children's resilience. Understanding the characteristics of quality parenting is critical to the idea of parental resilience. Even if divorce produces stress, the availability of social support from family and community can reduce this stress and yield positive outcomes. Any family <b>that</b> <b>emphasizes</b> <b>the</b> value of assigned chores, caring for brothers or sisters, and the contribution of part-time work in supporting the family helps to foster resilience. Resilience research has traditionally focused on the well being of children, with limited academic attention paid to factors that may contribute to the resilience of parents.|$|E

50|$|While the Christian intellectuals of Alexandria <b>emphasized</b> <b>the</b> allegorical {{interpretation}} of Scriptures and tended toward a Christology <b>that</b> <b>emphasized</b> <b>the</b> {{union of the}} human and the divine, those in Antioch held to a more literal and occasionally typological exegesis and a Christology <b>that</b> <b>emphasized</b> <b>the</b> distinction between the human and the divine {{in the person of}} Jesus Christ. The school in general tended to what might be called, in a rather loose sense, an Adoptionist Christology. Nestorius, before becoming Patriarch of Constantinople, had been a monk at Antioch and had there become imbued with the principles of the Antiochene theological school.|$|R

500|$|Tim Rogers (born June 7, 1979) is an American {{video game}} {{journalist}} and developer. In games journalism, {{he is known}} for his association with mid-2000s New Games Journalism, his verbose writing style, and his video game reviews website ActionButton.net. The Guardian cited his 2005 [...] "Dreaming in an empty room: a defense of Metal Gear Solid 2" [...] as a core example of New Games Journalism, a style of video game journalism <b>that</b> <b>emphasizes</b> <b>the</b> author's subjective and personal experiences in relation to the game world.

500|$|... "Passion" [...] is {{composed}} as a multi-genre tune <b>that</b> <b>emphasizes</b> <b>the</b> core elements of alternative rock, ambient and ethereal music. MuuMuse's Bradley Stern asserted that [...] "Passion" [...] was Utada's [...] "most complex" [...] recording, noting {{the use of}} [...] "passionate drumming" [...] and ambient sounds. Furthermore, he described the singers vocals as having an [...] "ethereal"-like vibe. David Jeffries of AllMusic compared it to another Disney composition, [...] "A Whole New World", {{and the work of}} American band Nine Inch Nails. With instrumentation of drums, keyboards, electric guitars and synthesizers, the track was distinctive for its overuse of echoing throughout the composition. Additionally, critics noticed the overlapping technique of Utada's singing, along with the use of reversing certain sections of her voice to hide messages within the song.|$|E

Following the event, a Microsoft spokesperson stated that the company was working on a Windows RT update that would provide [...] "some of the functionality of Windows 10", but declined to offer any further details. As such, Microsoft does not officially consider Windows RT to be a supported upgrade path to Windows 10. Shortly afterward, Microsoft ended production of both the Surface 2 and Lumia 2520.|$|E
