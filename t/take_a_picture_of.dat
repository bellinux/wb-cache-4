5|$|The video {{progresses}} as Carey, now on {{the streets}} of New York, is walking towards the hotel. As she begins to notice the bellhop, dressed in the sweats, pursuing her, she turns around in haste and begins jolting back to the hotel while holding several shopping bags. Additionally, scenes of the stalker's home are shown again, this time more elaborately, with his walls covered with portraits of the singer, as well as album covers and lights around a large photo of her. As the video comes to an end, she waits for her limousine to arrive at the hotel. However, before she gets inside, she notices the stalker attempting to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> her. She then looks directly into his camera and gives a smile. The video then shows him again, still attempting to take a picture, right before a bus hits him. Carey gasps in shock after witnessing the incident. The remix video for the song features the same story-line and footage, only showing inter-cut scenes of Carey dressed in a white ensemble, while laying on a vintage wooden table. As Gucci Mane stands next to her in a white suit, he pours her champagne and hands her the glass.|$|E

25|$|In 1978, Daris Swindler, the Burke Museum director, {{was told}} that the skull may be in the {{possession}} of Merrill Spencer, a physician who had attended Bobo's autopsy. Then in 1981 Spencer allowed David Humphries, a writer for the Seattle Weekly, to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> Bobo's skull. However, when asked by Humphries, Spencer refused to give the skull to the Burke. After Spencer's death in 2006, his employees decided to reunite Bobo's skull {{with the rest of the}} skeleton, and after some negotiating, the skull was given to the Burke in 2007.|$|E

500|$|The {{read-through}} for [...] "The Angels Take Manhattan" [...] {{took place}} in the Upper Boat Studios on 23 March 2012, alongside that for the episode [...] "Asylum of the Daleks". The final episode Gillan and Darvill shot as Amy and Rory was actually the previous episode, [...] "The Power of Three". Nevertheless, Gillan and Smith got very emotional filming the final graveyard scene. Amy and Rory's scene on the rooftop was filmed in a car park in Cardiff, Wales, with a greenscreen standing in for the New York skyline. To create the effect of the two plunging down, Gillan and Darvill were suspended upside-down by wires and raised and lowered. Much of the episode was filmed in Central Park in New York City in April 2012. The filming was attended by thousands of American fans, which surprised the cast and crew. Other scenes were shot at night in the city, {{as well as by the}} East River in front of the Brooklyn Bridge and in the Tudor City apartment complex. Moffat was in New York City when he came up with the story, and thought it was appropriate for the Weeping Angels. He described the city as [...] "a different backdrop" [...] to shoot a Doctor Who story in, and made use of its architecture. Fellow executive producer Caroline Skinner felt that the location [...] "has such scale and romance" [...] which [...] " [...] the episode a real atmosphere and a very different tone for Doctor Who". The week spent filming in the city was done by a [...] "small unit by American standards" [...] according to producer Marcus Wilson. They did not take any props of Angels or the TARDIS, which were instead added in post-production. Filming for the episode also occurred at a cemetery in Llanelli. During post-production, the New York skyline was inserted into the cemetery scenes. Gillan insisted on reading Amy's afterword to Smith when his reaction was filmed. They were not expecting it to be in front of a crowd in Central Park, and Smith said he had to [...] "treat this like a play". Because the content was so secret, Gillan had to read very quietly and Smith could not hold the real page because a spectator might <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> it. Gillan found that she only had one page of the script, and had to improvise the rest.|$|E

2500|$|The {{urban renewal}} of the West End has been {{attacked}} by critics for its destruction of a neighborhood and its careless implementation. One of the main criticisms of the project is that the neighborhood was not considered a slum by the residents, and instead had {{a strong sense of}} community. A later mayor of Boston, Ray Flynn, described the West End as [...] "a typical neighborhood" [...] and [...] "not blighted." [...] The perception of the neighborhood as a slum was mostly held by wealthy outsiders and was enhanced by city policy. For example, the city stopped collecting garbage and cleaning the streets, leaving the neighborhood a mess. A photographer for a local newspaper was even assigned to go to the West End, overturn a trashcan, and <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> it to create the impression of a blighted neighborhood.|$|E
2500|$|I {{remember}} Maurice Garin well. I met him {{and talked}} to him almost every day because {{we lived in the}} same area, 200m from each other, at Lens. Le Père Garin, as my father and grandfather called him used to bring out a chair in fine weather and sit {{in the doorway of the}} little office of the service station he owned at 116 rue de Lille in [...] Lens, under the sign for Antar fuel and oil. My barber was in the neighbouring house and I used to go there once a month to have a crew cut, [...] which was the fashion in those days. My friends and I were aged seven to ten and on our one-speed bikes we used to pin numbers on our back... and we never missed riding past Maurice Garin in a tight group so that he would see. It's strange that nobody thought to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> me, the little kid, alongside the first great champion of the biggest race in the world. But life's like that.|$|E
2500|$|Money is {{primarily}} obtained {{in an unusual}} way. One of the Magnus that can be put into a deck is a camera, available in three different levels of quality or effectiveness. When in battle, the character can use the camera to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> an enemy. After the battle, that picture will develop in about ten real time minutes. Once fully developed, a photo's value {{is primarily}} determined by the enemy photographed as well as conditions in effect at the time. Photos of rarer enemies (i.e. bosses) are worth more. If the enemy blocks a camera shot, the enemy in the photo will appear somewhat distorted and will be worth less. Using light or dark attacks along with the camera will make the photo lighter or darker, respectively. A photo will sell for less if it is too bright or too dark. Photos of PCs normally have very low sellback value, {{but there is a}} small chance of getting [...] "rare shots" [...] that are worth a decent amount.|$|E

2500|$|Dan Tynan, Executive Editor of PC World {{and author}} of Computer Privacy Annoyances (2005), said: [...] "This is {{extremely}} creepy, and way beyond {{the purview of the}} school.... There's really no need to try to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> someone—in fact, how can you prove the person in front of the laptop was the one who stole it?... And to install this stuff on anyone's computer and not notify them about, it is just begging for a world of pain." [...] Robert Richardson, Director of the Computer Security Institute, said: [...] "It's incredible that they didn't realize they were playing with fire." [...] Technology journalist Robert X. Cringely wrote in InfoWorld: [...] Is there any reason why you'd need to take two weeks' worth of photos to locate a missing laptop, especially when you already have other ways of tracking it? I don't think so.... Cafiero issued … the rather interesting statement that the 15-year-old Robbins had [...] "no reasonable expectation of privacy" [...] in his own home, because … his family hadn't paid the $55 insurance fee required by the school for home loaners. [...] In other words: If you don't pay your dues, we can watch you while you sleep. Did I say [...] "creepy" [...] already? ...|$|E
2500|$|Throughout his career, Inzunza Inzunza {{was able}} to avoid going to prison several times and intimidate law enforcement; one time in the late 1990s, two patrol cars from the Federal Ministerial Police (PFM) went into a {{neighborhood}} where Inzunza Inzunza was staying to carry out an arrest warrant. Though the police were going after a person uninvolved with the drug lord, his triggermen stopped the PFM cars and ordered them to call their boss. When the police commander arrived at the scene minutes later, Inzunza Inzunza walked {{up to him and}} smacked him several times, telling him he had no permission to be in his territory and to never stop by again. When the drug lord ordered them to leave, his gunmen took away their weapons for a couple of days. On 12 November 2002 in Culiacán, the Federal Preventive Police (PFP) intercepted a convoy of gunmen in which Inzunza Inzunza was traveling. A shootout eventually broke out, resulting in the death of four policemen and one gunmen. However, Inzunza Inzunza managed to escape the scene. Three years later on April 2005, Inzunza Inzunza intimidated several police officers who were patrolling his neighborhood and forced them to return to their headquarters. On 5 May 2005, Inzunza Inzunza travelled to Mazatlán to attend a rehab center for his drug addiction. While heading there, he was arrested by the Mazatlán Municipal Police with eight of his men. The police confiscated several assault rifles, handguns, grenades, and grenade launchers. The arrest of Inzunza Inzunza was initially reported by a photojournalist who managed to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> <b>of</b> him, but the drug lord never made it to prison; unconfirmed reports stated that he bribed the police to avoid going to jail. He escaped with Ismael Bernal Cristerna (alias [...] "El Mongol"), but he was later killed by Inzunza Inzunza in 2013 because the drug lord feared betrayal.|$|E
