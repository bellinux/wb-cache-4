5000|$|The A2340 4-track {{recorder}} with 7" [...] tape reels, 3¾ and 7½ ips speeds w/ manual direction <b>toggle</b> <b>lever</b> ...|$|E
50|$|Toggle {{switches}} {{with rubber}} mouldings that go completely over the <b>toggle</b> <b>lever</b> and seal to the housing {{have been used}} for both production and custom lights.|$|E
50|$|Stairlifts {{are largely}} {{operated}} using a {{control on the}} arm of the lift. This is either a switch or a <b>toggle</b> type <b>lever.</b> This larger <b>toggle</b> switch enables users even with limited mobility or painful condition to use stairlifts easily and safely.|$|R
5000|$|Safeties can {{generally}} {{be divided into}} subtypes such as internal safeties (which typically do not receive input from the user) and external safeties (which typically allow the user to give input, for example, <b>toggling</b> a <b>lever</b> from [...] "on" [...] to [...] "off" [...] or something similar). Sometimes these are called [...] "passive" [...] and [...] "active" [...] safeties (or [...] "automatic" [...] and [...] "manual"), respectively.|$|R
5000|$|... <b>toggling</b> a small <b>lever</b> on {{the left}} of the lens. This way, one can see the tele-framelines when using a 50mm lens. It helps visualise the field of view for another focal length. (Earlier {{versions}} did not have a lever to view the 90mm frameline without attaching the lens.) ...|$|R
50|$|Most {{trailers}} are towed {{by joining}} {{a ball and}} a coupler (socket). The coupler {{is attached to the}} trailer, and the ball hitch is attached to the tow vehicle. The coupler slides over the ball hitch. Then, pressure is applied to a clamp, usually with a <b>toggle</b> or <b>lever,</b> which secures theball in the coupler. To ensure that the appropriate amount of pressure is applied, the coupler is equipped with a locknut that allows the operator to adjust the tension. When properly attached, the coupler will have limited movement, swiveling mainly right and left as well as tilting slightly.|$|R

Instead of hooks, he drilled a rectangular hole through the ski from side to side, and passed an iron bar through it. The bar was then bent up on either side, locking it in place, and then formed to fit the toe of the boot. This improvement once again dramatically {{improved the}} firmness of the fit. Finally, in 1904 he adopted the Hoyer-Ellefsen <b>toggle,</b> a <b>lever</b> that replaced the buckles. This not only greatly improved mechanical advantage, further improving {{the strength of the}} binding, but also made the system much easier to put on and remove. Better yet, the geometry of the attachment points meant the heel strap was mechanically attached below that of the toe strap, which provided a constant [...] "diagonal downpull" [...] that naturally returned the heel to the ski.|$|R
