25|$|The drive {{within the}} casing is {{provided}} by a train of spur gears. Accessories are arranged {{on both sides of}} the driveshaft entry, in reducing order of their speed. The gears are usually plain spur gears, running in roller bearings. Idler gears are commonly used between them, to increase the spacing between accessories. Helical gears are sometimes used for the high-torque drives, typically the starter, as these give smoother running. However helical gears also generate an end-thrust, which then requires a more complicated <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> to support them.|$|E

2500|$|The center hub {{rotating}} assembly (CHRA) houses the shaft {{that connects the}} compressor impeller and turbine. It also must contain a bearing system to suspend the shaft, allowing it to rotate at very high speed with minimal friction. For instance, in automotive applications the CHRA typically uses a <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> or ball bearing lubricated by a constant supply of pressurized engine oil. The CHRA may also be considered [...] "water-cooled" [...] by having an entry and exit point for engine coolant. Water-cooled models use engine coolant to keep lubricating oil cooler, avoiding possible oil coking (destructive distillation of engine oil) from the extreme heat in the turbine. The development of air-foil bearings removed this risk.|$|E
2500|$|The Praga B2 was a dual ignition, {{air-cooled}} horizontal twin producing 40 horsepower (30kW) {{aimed at}} lightweight aircraft. [...] It was a higher compression version (6.7:1 {{from the earlier}} 5.72:1) of the original and otherwise very similar Praga B, which provided 36hp (27kW). [...] Its cylinders were machined from alloy steel forgings and had aluminium alloy heads. The pistons were of aluminium alloy, with three compression rings and one scraper ring. The connecting rods were of nitrided steel, with divided big ends and bronze bushes at the little ends. The one piece crankshaft was also formed from nitrided steel and had two main roller bearings and a single ball <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing.</b> The single piece crankcase was cast from an aluminium alloy.|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study, a {{computational}} {{model for the}} coupled fluid-structure simulation of bump-type foil <b>thrust</b> <b>bearings</b> is developed. A three-dimensional compressible Navier-Stokes solver is extended to model the fluid flow within the thin gap. In addition, a new solver is developed to model the bump and top foils within the foil <b>thrust</b> <b>bearings.</b> These two solvers are linked with a coupling algorithm that maps pressure and deflection at the fluid-structure interface. The theory and verification of this coupling algorithm are detailed {{as the focus of}} this paper. Finally, this coupled fluid-structure simulation for the foil <b>thrust</b> <b>bearings</b> is validated with experiment results from the literature. The resulting fluid-structure model can be used to assist the design of bump-type foil <b>thrust</b> <b>bearings</b> for various applications...|$|R
2500|$|Since {{the motive}} power of screw {{propulsion}} is delivered along the shaft, a <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> {{is needed to}} transfer that load to the hull without excessive friction. SS Great Britain had a 2ft diameter gunmetal plate on the forward end of the shaft which bore against a steel plate attached to the engine beds. Water at 200 psi was injected between these two surfaces to lubricate and separate them. This arrangement was not sufficient for higher engine powers and oil lubricated [...] "collar" [...] thrust bearings became standard from the early 1850s. This was superseded {{at the beginning of}} the 20th century by floating pad bearing which automatically built up wedges of oil which could withstand bearing pressures of 500 psi or more.|$|E
2500|$|All {{variants}} of the R.C.40 had {{much in common}} with construction of the earlier Asso 750 R.C., though they had two, rather than three, banks of 6 cylinders and 4 rather than 2 valves per cylinder. [...] Cylinder barrels were machined from carbon steel with flat-topped heads and valve seats. Each barrel had a separate sheet steel water jacket. [...] Cast aluminium head blocks were bolted to each of the two banks of 6 cylinders, providing valve ports, guides, coolant passages and camshaft supports. The pistons were also aluminium castings. The crankshaft was a 6-throw design with 8 plain bearings and a double row ball <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> between the front two. [...] The connecting rods had bronze bush little ends and white metal big ends. [...] The crankcase was cast in two parts, the upper one with the housings for the crankshaft bearings.|$|E

The penalties associated with skipping a foreign port were waived for NCL on account of the damage. A revised itinerary with stops in Kailua and Lahaina was substituted until the end of April, and the repositioning cruise to Vancouver was cancelled to allow Norwegian Star to go into drydock early.|$|E

2500|$|The Sud-Ouest Djinn was {{the first}} tip-jet {{propelled}} rotorcraft to enter production. As such, the propulsion system involved a Turbomeca Palouste gas turbine engine that drove a pump to produce compressed air, which was in turn fed into the aircraft's hollow rotor blades to exit at their tips, inducing the blades to turn as a consequence. The rotor hub assembly, which freely oscillated around a spherical <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing,</b> was mounted upon a steel pylon via means of a ball joint and rubber shock absorbers. Unlike some of the experimental tip-jet designs of the era, a 'cold' tip-jet approach was used, meaning {{that there was no}} combustion activity present at the exhaust nozzles installed at the ends of the rotor blades. Consequently, the nozzles produced little noise in their operation, and were claimed by Sud-Ouest to be [...] "noiseless".|$|E
2500|$|The types A, C, D and F {{were all}} side-valve engines, with valves {{operated}} by push rods running exposed and {{parallel to the}} cylinder axes, driven within the V from a central, gear-driven camshaft above the crankshaft. [...] All camshafts were hollow for lubrication. [...] The cylinder cooling jackets surrounded the cylinders, then turned inward with flattened faces for inlet and exhaust manifolds and push rods. [...] The exhaust stubs were vertical, each bank of cylinders feeding its own horizontal pipe. The inlet stubs entered the cylinder head at right angles. The earliest type A engines {{had a pair of}} inlet tubes, one for each bank and fed from a carburettor at the front. [...] Slightly later model As and types C and F placed the carburettor between the cylinder banks, halfway along the engine axis. [...] Fuel and air was passed to a spherical copper mixing chamber above the carburettor, then via four radial copper tubes which finally branched into pairs the feed the inlet ports symmetrically. [...] The smaller type D retained the end positioned carburettor. [...] These engines all had cast iron cylinders. The types A and C were very similar in construction as well as capacity, but a major change in crankshaft design was introduced with the smaller type D and inherited by the F. [...] The A and C types had a crankshaft supported by only three plain bearings and the width of the central one required a greater space between the second and third cylinder of each bank, visibly dividing each into blocks of two. [...] The crankshafts of the D and F types had five ball race bearings, one between each cylinder and two end bearings; the output <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> was a double race to allow for pusher or tractor configurations. [...] The new bearing arrangement permitted an equal cylinder spacing. [...] The type FA was a type F with an extended crankshaft, mounted in a very prominent, conical crankcase extension. [...] The type T, discussed below, had a similar extension, which in that case at least allowed a larger diameter <b>thrust</b> <b>bearing</b> to be used.|$|E
