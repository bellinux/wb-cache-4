5000|$|Individuals who {{consider}} <b>technology</b> as <b>neutral</b> see <b>technology</b> as neither good nor bad and what matters are {{the ways in}} which we use technology. An example of a neutral viewpoint is, [...] "guns are neutral and its up to how we use them whether it would be 'good or bad'" [...] (Green, 2001). Mackenzie and Wajcman believe that <b>technology</b> is <b>neutral</b> only if it's never been used before, or if no one knows what {{it is going to be}} used for (Green, 2001). In effect, guns would be classified as neutral if and only if society were none the wiser of their existence and functionality (Green, 2001). Obviously, such a society is non-existent and once becoming knowledgeable about technology, the society is drawn into a social progression where nothing is 'neutral about society' (Green). According to Lelia Green, if one believes <b>technology</b> is <b>neutral,</b> one would disregard the cultural and social conditions that technology has produced (Green, 2001). This view is also referred to as technological instrumentalism.|$|R

40|$|Can investment-specific {{technology}} (IST) shocks explain two of {{the international}} business cycles puzzles- the consumption/output anomaly and the international co-movement puzzle? I construct {{a new set of}} international business cycles facts which are comparable with the moments calculated from the simulated data of an international real business cycles (IRBC) model with investment-specific technology shocks. I develop two-country, two-good and two-sector (consumption and investment goods producing sectors) IRBC model with IST and aggregate <b>neutral</b> <b>technology</b> shocks to compare its simulated moments with the new set of international business cycles facts. I use the model to study the roles of IST shocks, aggregate <b>neutral</b> <b>technology</b> shocks and trade in investment goods in explaining the international business cycle facts. In contrast to the existing IRBC models with IST shocks, I find that the aggregate <b>neutral</b> <b>technology</b> shocks are relatively more important in explaining the positive cross-country correlation in output. This is mainly because of the sectoral factor re-allocation effects arising from technology shocks in a two-sector model. IST shocks increases the cross-country correlations in labor input and investment. Trade in investment goods increases the cross-country correlation...|$|R

Most of the cross-country growth literature that refers to the Solow model has employed a specification where steady state differences in output per person are due to international differences in the capital output ratio for a constant level of technology. My empirical {{results show that the}} cross-country data can also be summarized by an alternative empirical specification of the Solow model that uses a measure of institutional technology as an explanatory variable and treats the capital output ratio as part of the regression constant. The steady state implications of the Solow model with regard to international technology differences also appear to matter for empirical studies of trade.
