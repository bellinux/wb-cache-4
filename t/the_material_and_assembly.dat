40|$|Architectural design {{concepts}} incorporating glass beams, panels, or generally load-carrying elements and stiffeners for buildings, claddings, windows, and partitions are largely considered in modern high-rise constructions. A multitude of aspects, including motivations related to transparency, aesthetics, illumination, and energy conservation, progressively increased {{the use and}} interest for such a still rather innovative constructional material. However, compared to other traditional materials for buildings, standard glass is typically characterized by brittle behaviour and limited tensile resistance. The intrinsic properties of glass, moreover, together with typically limited thickness-to-size ratios for glazing elements, or the mutual interaction of glass components with adjacent constructional elements {{as a part of}} full assemblies they belong (i. e., fixing systems, sealants, etc.), as well as the combination of mechanical and thermal phenomena, make glass structures highly vulnerable. Special safety design rules are hence required, especially under extreme loading conditions. In this review paper, a state of the art on structural glass systems exposed to fire is presented. Careful consideration is paid for actual design methods and general regulations, as well as for existing research outcomes—both at <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>and</b> <b>assembly</b> levels—giving evidence of current challenges, issues, and developments...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 The {{performance}} of {{dye-sensitized solar cells}} (DSC) {{as reported in the}} literature varies even when the materials and/or methods cited are essentially the same. DSC performance even varies significantly within a single lab from researcher to researcher, as has been observed in our lab. To better constrain the sources of the variability and determine which materials and techniques yielded the best DSC performance, various materials and techniques for fabrication of dye-sensitized solar cells were evaluated for their effect on DSC performance. Materials investigated included two types of TiO 2 nanoparticles (Aeroxide ® P 25 and a nanoparticle synthesized in our lab) as well as two different electrolytes (Dyesol's High Performance Electrolyte and an electrolyte synthesized in our lab). Results in the literature suggest that nanoparticle dispersion during screen printing paste fabrication is important for the dye loading and optical properties of DSCs, so dispersion techniques including mortar grinding, sonication, roller milling, and ball milling were investigated. DSC fabrication and assembly techniques were also suspected to be important. Comparisons were made between doctor bladed and screen printed films, dye loading of the TiO 2 films under ambient pressures and vacuum, and various sealed and unsealed cell testing configurations. Results from <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>and</b> <b>assembly</b> technique comparisons showed varying degrees of impact on DSC film quality and performance. Ball milling was found to be an effective method of disaggregating P 25 TiO 2 nanoparticles for screen printing pastes, whereas mortar grinding left large TiO 2 clusters and yielded variable cluster size distributions from batch to batch. The presence of TiO 2 clusters increased film cracking, film peeling, and light scattering and consequently reduced DSC performance. Vacuum-assisted dye loading was not found to improve DSC performance. A comparison of gasket-sealed, epoxy-sealed, and unsealed DSCs did not show consistent differences in performance, though unsealed cells showed poor stability over short time periods. Both screen printing and doctor blading of TiO 2 films yielded films of uniform thickness and DSCs of comparable performance. Finally, a lab electrolyte was found to yield DSCs with a higher short circuit current compared to DSCs that used Dyesol's High Performance Electrolyte. The electrolyte performance difference is partially due to higher charge transfer resistance at the TiO 2 -electrolyte interface...|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} of cryogenic instruments {{is often a}} function of their operating temperature. Thus, designers of cryogenic instruments often are required to predict the operating temperature of each instrument they design. This requires accurate thermal models of cryogenic components which include the properties of <b>the</b> <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> <b>assembly</b> techniques used. When components are bolted or otherwise pressed together, {{a knowledge of the}} thermal {{performance of}} such joints are also needed. In some cases, the temperature drop across these joints represents a significant fraction of the total temperature difference between the instrument and its cooler. While extensive databases exist on the thermal properties of bulk materials, similar databases for pressed contacts do not. This has often lead to instrument designs that avoid pressed contacts or to the over-design of such joints at unnecessary expense. Although many people have made measurements of contact conductances at cryogenic temperatures, this data is often very narrow in scope and even more often it has not been published in an easily retrievable fashion, if published at all. This paper presents a summary of the limited pressed contact data available in the literature...|$|R

The LEED program offers a rating system based on certain criteria, but how would one compare alternate buildings and certain design decisions? To answer these questions several tools and programs {{have been developed to}} evaluate the environmental impacts of <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>and</b> <b>assemblies</b> from <b>the</b> time they are extracted as minerals, manufactured, constructed, replaced and demolished with the building. This process is known as a life cycle analysis. This study intends to develop a method to analyze a LEED Certified building using commercially available life cycle analysis software. Another aspect {{of this study was to}} research how the building selected for the analysis completed the requirements for LEED certification. The building used for this study was the LEED Certified Ohio 4 -H Center on the campus of the Ohio State University. The program used for the analysis was the Athena: Impact Estimator which using life cycle analysis of building assemblies to determine the energy and resource use at each stage of the life cycle. The results of this study found that this method of analysis can be used to predict the life cycle consumption of a pre-constructed building based on the building plans and energy consumption over one year. It was also found that this tool would be better utilized as a design tool early in the conceptual or pre-planning stages for comparing similar designs due to the restrictions on ii the inputs that are available for current versions of the program.

40|$|The {{demand for}} faster, {{portable}} and reliable electronic devices is increasing {{the pressure on}} the development of assembly techniques for signal integrity (SI). The advance of integrated circuits toward a large number of Input/Output (I/Os), a high number of operations and up to microwave communication frequencies, is behind the drive for the search for new packaging solutions. <b>The</b> <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> <b>assembly</b> techniques have an important impact on the propagation of high speed signals. Signal integrity issues emerge due to the electrical losses of materials, reflections from impedance discontinuities in the signal path and fast transitions of the signals. For these reasons, signal integrity in lead-free connections of WLCSP, flip chip (FC) and Integrated Module Board (IMB) assemblies were investigated up to 50  GHz. The increase of conductor loss resulting from the presence of thick oxide layers on the surface of solder bumps of hot running components was experimentally studied for the first time. Utilizing theoretical calculations, a design rule was developed to account for the 40  % increase in losses due to the presence of oxide layers at high frequencies. The research into the influence of solder microstructure on signal quality showed that it did not negatively affect the wave propagation. Experimental results proved that the presence of underfills and high density routing on printed wiring boards (PWBs) under the WLCSP components, detuned the components and the connections. The effects of three different underfills on signal propagation were studied. It was proven that the changes resulting from the rheology and parameters of curing process influence the losses and reflections of circuits. The analysis of microwave performances of flip chip (FC) and Integrated Module Board (IMB) assembly techniques demonstrated that they are well suited to Radio frequency (RF) and high speed applications. Comparison showed that IMB performed better as the wave encountered smaller discontinuities and had an optimized propagation path. Full wave simulations of IMB assemblies were performed considering finite ground coplanar waveguide (FGCPW), microstrip and stripline connections with stack-ups that included high dielectric constant <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> four connection possibilities. The research was carried out in the domains of both frequency and time to rigorously determine the sources of signal reflections.

In this Review, we explore, discuss, and detail innovation in layer-by-layer assembly in terms of past and present developments, and we highlight how these might guide future advances.

40|$|Graduation date: 2007 Light-frame {{construction}} practices <b>and</b> <b>materials</b> {{have changed}} greatly {{over the past}} 100 years. Contemporary {{research has focused on}} modern construction; thus, we {{know a great deal about}} the behavior of modern lightframe buildings under lateral forces. However, there are many light-frame buildings that were built prior to the introduction of modern building codes <b>and</b> <b>material</b> standards, <b>and</b> these buildings are still in service. <b>The</b> <b>material</b> <b>and</b> performance databases for these older structures are limited, so risk assessment and condition assessment are challenged for seismic or wind events. The project objective is to establish a basis for probabilistic assessment of the seismic performance of older construction by examining the performance of shearwalls, connections, <b>and</b> wood <b>materials</b> from older light-frame buildings Nineteen structures built between 1900 and 1970, scheduled for demolition, were sampled for <b>material</b> <b>and</b> connection tests as well as full-size shearwall tests. The scope of tests for each source structure was based on the availability of full-size shearwalls and the type of sheathing <b>material</b> used in <b>the</b> structure. Two exterior sheathing types were found in the source structures, horizontal plank sheathing and plywood. Wood lath-and-plaster was the characteristic interior wall covering in buildings of this era. Specific gravity was determined, and embedment tests were performed on the wood framing <b>and</b> sheathing <b>materials.</b> Bending-yield tests were performed on the sheathing nails (typically 0. 113 by 2. 5 - in.), and lateral single-nail connection tests were performed on extracted connections. Full-scale shearwall racking tests were done both monotonically and cyclically using the basic CUREE loading protocol. The average specific gravity of <b>the</b> wood <b>materials</b> was 0. 46. <b>The</b> <b>material</b> extracted from <b>the</b> source structures had an embedment strength that was statistically similar to the National Design Specifications (NDS) table value for a specific gravity of 0. 46 (4. 0 ksi). The results of the nail bending-yield test showed no significant change over time. Nails had average bending-yield strength of 97. 3 ksi, which is similar to the NDS stated value of 100 ksi. In general, the connection tests showed agreement with the European Yield Model (EYM) equations for connection strength. The full-size shearwall capacities were in agreement with known values for walls with each type of sheathing. Based on the limited testing done in this study, no adverse effects due to age and service life were observed. <b>The</b> <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> <b>assemblies</b> performed according to modern standards for new construction. Insect damage and fungi deterioration were present in many of the structures, and because these conditions were avoided as much as possible, no inferences are made regarding the effects of insect and fungi damage on lateral shear strength. These tests show that a structure built in the early 1900 ’s will meet modern design expectations as long as <b>the</b> <b>material</b> has been kept dry and free of damage due to insects. The principal threats to hazard performance observed during this study were the construction practices in the early twentieth century. Most of the source structures had no anchorage to the foundation, shearwalls were connected to roof diaphragms with limited toe nail connections, most structures were sheathed with horizontal planks, and many of the source structures had few walls that met the modern prescribed aspect ratio for structural shearwalls of 2 : 1 for full table design capacity.

40|$|Blinds and {{shutters}} create privacy {{during the}} day and night in residential and commercial buildings. They are also used to keep rooms cool when sunny and to minimise heat loss at night or in winter; in turn this reduces use of air conditioning and heating, associated energy inputs, carbon and equivalent outputs and costs. As well as controlling temperature, blinds and shutters can be used to reduce glare, control light levels and to contribute to general health and well-being. Despite these various benefits in many instances in the UK blinds and shutters are not opened and closed and/or adjusted correctly and consequently the above benefits are not fully realised. One means of addressing this problem to ensure maximum operational energy savings and thermal comfort is the implementation of motorised and/or automatic blind opening and closing. By default however this increases the number and variety of components, <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> manufacturing processes and embodied environmental impact. In this study Life Cycle Assessment is used to measure and compare combined embodied environmental impact and potential operational energy savings of a variety of types of manual, motorised and automated blinds in a typical domestic environment in the UK. Currently the majority of manually operated blinds and shutters are either sent to landfill or incinerated with energy recovery at end of life even though <b>the</b> <b>materials,</b> manufacturing <b>and</b> <b>assembly</b> processes for these products indicate that reuse and recycling are relatively easy to achieve.

In addition to recycling the paper explores other business models (such as component reuse, remanufacture, leasing, buying a service), all of which are associated with the development of a Circular Economy for this sector.

The supply of components is crucial for assembly, for in serving the requirements from assembly. Still, <b>the</b> <b>materials</b> supply system has to remain efficient.

The thesis is a based on five studies, all of which depart from theoretical frame- works developed from literature and empirically applied within the Swedish automotive industry. Four case studies and one experiment were conducted to answer three research questions, {{and the results are}} published in five papers. The results of the thesis provide several theoretical and practical contributions. Both the position of the exposure {{and the size of the}} packaging for a component impact the performance of the assembly workstation performance in terms of space required, non-value-adding work, <b>and</b> ergonomics. <b>Materials</b> exposure impacts manual picking time at assembly lines, for which packaging is the most influential factor, followed by angle of exposure and height of the exposed com- ponent. Materials exposure further impacts the configuration of the in-plant ma- terials supply system by requiring additional activities in <b>the</b> in-plant <b>materials</b> supply system, which impacts its performance. Concerning the impact of choice of packaging used in materials exposure, a model to evaluate the impact a pack- aging has on the performance of <b>the</b> <b>materials</b> supply system was developed. <b>The</b> <b>Materials</b> Flow Mapping methodology is another contribution that describes <b>the</b> activities in <b>materials</b> supply systems, as well as categorises <b>the</b> activities in <b>material</b> flows into materials handling, transportation, storage, and administra- tive activities.

This variability has {{a huge impact on}} the shovel dipper <b>and</b> tooth <b>assembly</b> in hard formations. With this in mind, the primary objectives of the project were to (i) provide the theoretical basis to develop the Intelligent Shovel Excavation (ISE) technology to solve the problems associated with excavation in material formations; (ii) advance knowledge and frontiers in shovel excavation through intelligent navigation; and (iii) submit proposal for the design, development and implementation of the ISE technology for shovel excavation at experimental surface mining sites. The mathematical methods were used to (i) develop shovel's kinematics and dynamics, and (ii) establish the relationship between shovel parameters and the resistive forces from <b>the</b> <b>material</b> formation during excavation process. The ADAMS simulation environment was used to develop the hydraulic and cable shovel virtual prototypes. Two numerical examples are included to test the theoretical hypotheses and the obtained results are discussed. The area of sensor technology was studied. Application of specific wrist-mounted sensors to characterize <b>the</b> <b>material,</b> bucket <b>and</b> frame <b>assembly</b> was determined. Data acquisition, display and control system for shovel loading technology was adopted. The concept of data acquisition and control system was designed and a shovel boom stresses were simulated. A multi-partner collaboration between research organizations, shovel manufacturer, hardware and sensor technology companies, and surface mining companies is proposed to test design features, construct a field ready prototype and perform field testing at the surface mining sites. It is anticipated that 10 % in energy savings including electricity (cable shovel) and fuel (hydraulic shovel) will be achieved by implementation of ISE technology...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the thermal characterisation {{of a gas}} powered, portable device used for the vaporisation of herbal materials for biomedical inhalation. The main aims of this research are to characterise the thermal behaviour of a chamber assembly inside the device where thematerial is heated to its vaporisation temperature, to quantify theminimumpower required to heat <b>the</b> herbal <b>material,</b> to provide designers of such chambers with tools which allow the prediction of the power requirements for heating <b>the</b> <b>material,</b> <b>and</b> finally, to validate these tools. <b>The</b> physical <b>and</b> thermal <b>material</b> properties of two herbal <b>materials</b> - lavender <b>and</b> chamomile - were measured, for use in power requirement calculations. In order to determine thermal efficiency of the current industrial {{state of the art}} in vaporisation of herbal materials, a commercial portable vaporiser was thermally characterised. These measurements showed that only 2 % of the heat generated in the device was supplied to <b>the</b> target <b>material.</b> This poor efficiency was attributed to unnecessarily large components within the device and hence unnecessarily large thermal capacitance and large surface area for convective heat loss to ambient. In order to determine theminimumpower requirements which could potentially be achieved to heat the desired volume of herbal material, further analysis was restricted to just <b>the</b> <b>material</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> chamber <b>assembly</b> in which it is contained. Two initial design tools were developed, which allow the prediction of spatial and temporal temperature distribution in a centrally heated, two dimensional annulus of material subjected to convective boundary conditions. The first provides non-dimensional charts for determination of temperature. The second provides an interactive design method, which solves the governing equations for unsteady conduction in radial co-ordinates based on a range of variables input by the user, which calculates the temperature distribution and power requirements for heating the two dimensional annulus of material from ambient to its vaporisation temperature. The flow path of fluid inside the chamber assembly of the vaporisation device and through the porous medium during inhalation was investigated experimentally using Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) and refractive index matching. These measurements were used primarily for validation of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) models. Vector maps are also presented to provide an understanding of the flow structure inside the chamber, where fluid enters the porous medium downstream of a sharp bend. A flattened velocity profile was found after fluid travelled through a short distance of low permeability porous <b>material.</b> <b>The</b> temperature distributions in <b>the</b> chamber <b>assembly</b> <b>and</b> porous <b>material</b> when heat is applied from ambient and during inhalation were measured experimentally; the results of which were used for validation of CFD predictions. Computational models were used for the overall prediction of the power required to heat <b>the</b> <b>material</b> initially <b>and</b> reheat after inhalation. Finally, a number of power profiles are presented which express the relationship between power supply limits <b>and</b> <b>the</b> allowable <b>material</b> heat-up time. This provides a guideline when selecting the type and size of power supply in future designs of the vaporisation device...|$|R

50|$|The other {{principal}} area of Tirrell's current work, {{in addition}} to peptide amphiphiles, is in the generation of new <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> functional <b>assemblies</b> via polyelectrolyte complexation. Under the right conditions, oppositely charged polyelectrolyte chains can assemble into flexible, fluid complexes. Such fluids (sometimes known as coacervates) have very low interfacial tension with water so they are very useful as encapsulants and also as agents to drive self-assembly in aqueous systems. Tirrell's research group has been exploring these <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> <b>assemblies</b> {{in a variety of}} biomedical applications such as micelle formation, encapsulation and hydrogel formation.|$|R
40|$|A major {{barrier to}} {{realising}} dramatic {{improvements in the}} environmental performance of buildings&# 039; structures is the inability to accurately quantify {{the environmental impacts of}} design alternatives. This paper presents a framework for determining the environmental performance of building <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> <b>assemblies</b> in Australia. Presently being developed under the working title of "Building <b>Assemblies</b> <b>and</b> <b>Materials</b> Scorecard (BAMS) ", this project aims to establish a method and reporting format to assess the environmental performance of building <b>materials</b> <b>and</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Learning from international initiatives, BAMS uses life cycle assessment (LCA) to ensure consistent and science-based evaluation of construction options. The underlying LCA framework of BAMS is unique in that it combines a number of essential LCA ideas in one scheme. It is intended that in the short term BAMS will provide a common basis for materials assessment in a number of existing environmental building rating tools in Australia such as Green Star. The potential applications as a long term goal however, may be far more extensive...|$|R
