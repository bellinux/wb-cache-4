40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} the mean streamline analysis using the empirical loss models for performance prediction of mixed-flow pumps with high specific speeds. A new internal loss model {{to describe the}} effect of flow separation on the characteristic head–capacity curve with {{a dip in the}} low flow range is developed and a modified recirculation loss model for calculation of parasitic loss due to flow recirculation at the impel-ler exit is suggested in this study. The prediction performance of the proposed method here is tested against four sets of measured <b>total</b> <b>heads</b> and efficiencies of mixed-flow pumps, and it is also compared with that based on two-dimensional cascade theory. Predicted results by the present set of loss models agree very well with experimental data for a variety of mixed-flow pumps over the normal operating conditions...|$|R
