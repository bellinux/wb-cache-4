5|$|Improvement {{continued}} in the nineteenth century. Innovations included the first working reaping machine, developed by Patrick Bell in 1828. His rival James Smith turned to improving sub-soil drainage and developed a method of ploughing that could break up the subsoil barrier without disturbing the <b>topsoil.</b> Previously unworkable low-lying carselands could now be brought into arable production {{and the result was}} the even Lowland landscape that still predominates.|$|E

The collapse of the walls was a consequence of the instability of the <b>topsoil</b> on top of the limestone spur, which was a mixture of clay and sandstone; once the clay was washed away over time, the remaining sandstone proved extremely unstable and liable to crack.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Zoe {{severely}} impacted {{the islands}} of the Solomon island chain, particularly {{the islands of}} Tikopia and Anuta. In Anuta, agricultural activities were disrupted. Various fruit trees and crops, especially in gardens on the island's hills, were destroyed by high winds and heavy rain. In addition, communications with other islands were disrupted. The impact on Tikopia was much greater; agricultural productivity on the island {{was said to have}} been wiped out. Fruit trees were estimated only to begin producing fruit again at least two years after Zoe's impact. <b>Topsoil</b> was left dry by the cyclone, preventing any immediate replacement of lost crops.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s, several {{economic}} and climatic conditions combined with disastrous results for South Dakota. A lack of rainfall, extremely high temperatures and inappropriate cultivation techniques produced {{what was known}} as the Dust Bowl in South Dakota and several other plains states. Fertile <b>topsoil</b> was blown away in massive dust storms, and several harvests were completely ruined. The experiences of the Dust Bowl, coupled with local bank foreclosures and the general economic effects of the Great Depression, resulted in many South Dakotans leaving the state.

5|$|Across Honduras, {{agriculture}} sustained serious damage, with initial {{estimates of}} 70% of crops destroyed. Flooding affected about 29% of the country's arable land, much of covered {{for an extended}} period of time. This washed away large areas of <b>topsoil,</b> which would take a long period of time to recover. About 85% of the banana crop was lost, along with the loss of 60% of melons, 60% of sugar cane, and 58% of corn. About one-third of the corn crop had already been harvested. About 50,000bovine were killed, as were 60% of the fowl population. Crop and agricultural damage totaled about $1billion, which would take the country years to recover. Poor road conditions following the storm prevented crops from being dried, which caused further damage.|$|E

When the <b>topsoils</b> were dry, they could absorb water only with difficultywhich is illustrated by wetting rate measurements. Precipitation could flow rapidly through shrinkage cracks towards the subsoil, bypassing the matrix of the peat.

40|$|Wildlife and {{livestock}} in the Ngorongoro Conservation Area (NCA), Tanzania, commonly practise geophagy. We investigated the nutrient content of nine earth licks and adjacent <b>topsoils</b> in the NCA, and for comparative purposes, two salt pans in north-eastern Tanzania, licks in central Tanzania and a lick near Puerto Maldonado, Peru. The licks had no consistent pattern of nutrient enrichment relative to unutilized <b>topsoils,</b> although the Na content of licks {{was greater than}} that of the adjacent <b>topsoils</b> at all but one site. The three largest licks in the NCA (Gibbs Farm, Seneto and Ascent Road) were enriched relative to <b>topsoils</b> and global averages in Se (maximum of 4. 7 mg kg- 1), Co (maximum of 107 mg kg- 1) and/or Mo (maximum of 7. 4 mg kg - 1). We suggest that licks do provide supplemental Na, but that Se, Co and/or Mo at the largest licks provide easily overlooked nutritional benefits and are perhaps the primary target for geophagy at these sites. Subsoil zones of clay deposition are likely to be enriched in various elements through illuviation or mineral precipitation from solution. Animals may use the taste of NaCl as a clue for locating such zones where they are likely to find a greater quantity of micronutrients relative to other soils. These findings have consequences for conservation and pastoralism in that these large licks may be key resources, providing micronutrients that are essential for maintaining the health and fecundity of animal as well as human populations in the region. © 2006 The Zoological Society of London.

5|$|Round {{the rims}} of deserts, where more {{precipitation}} occurred and conditions were more suitable, some groups took to cultivating crops. This {{may have happened}} when drought caused the death of herd animals, forcing herdsmen to turn to cultivation. With few inputs, {{they were at the}} mercy of the weather and may have lived at bare subsistence level. The land they cultivated reduced the area available to nomadic herders, causing disputes over land. The semi-arid fringes of the desert have fragile soils which are at risk of erosion when exposed, as happened in the American Dust Bowl in the 1930s. The grasses that held the soil in place were ploughed under, and a series of dry years caused crop failures, while enormous dust storms blew the <b>topsoil</b> away. Half a million Americans were forced to leave their land in this catastrophe.|$|E
5|$|The {{hills of}} Darjeeling {{are part of}} the Lesser Himalaya.

However, the soil is often poorly consolidated (the permeable sediments of the region do not retain water between rains) and is not considered suitable for agriculture. The area has steep slopes and loose <b>topsoil,</b> leading to frequent landslides during the monsoons.

5|$|Underlying the Albany Pine Bush is a bedrock {{consisting}} of shale and siltstone, laid down 450 {{million years ago}} during the Middle Ordovician. The bedrock is covered by glaciolacustrine deposits which make up the sandy <b>topsoils</b> of the barrens.|$|R
2500|$|The bedrock here {{is lower}} Paleozoic {{sedimentary}} rocks, with limestone and dolomite especially prevalent near the surface. [...] It is highly dissected, and local tributaries of the Mississippi have cut deep valleys into the bedrock. [...] It {{is an area}} of karst topography, with thin <b>topsoils</b> lying atop porous limestones, leading to formation of caverns and sinkholes. [...] The last glaciation did not cover this region (halting at the Des Moines terminal lobe mentioned above), so there is no glacial drift to form subsoils, giving the region the name of the Driftless area. [...] As the <b>topsoils</b> are shallower and poorer than those to the west, dairy farming rather than cash crops is the principal agricultural activity.|$|R
40|$|Non-sustainable {{agricultural}} practices {{can alter the}} quality of soil and water. A sustainable soil management requires detailed understanding of how tillage affects soil quality, erosion, and leaching processes. Agricultural soils in the Haean catchment (South Korea) are susceptible to erosion by water during the monsoon. For years, erosion-induced losses have been compensated by spreading allochthonous sandy material on the fields. These anthropogenically modified soils are used for vegetable production, and crops are cultivated in ridges using plastic mulches. To evaluate whether the current practice of ridge cultivation is sustainable with regard to soil quality and soil and water conservation, we (i) analysed soil properties of <b>topsoils</b> and (ii) carried out dye tracer experiments. Our {{results show that the}} sandy <b>topsoils</b> have a very low soil organic matter content and a poor structure and lack soil burrowers. The artificial layering induced by spreading sandy material supported lateral downhill water flow. Ridge tillage and plastic mulching strongly increased surface runoff and soil erosion. We conclude that for this region a comprehensive management plan, which aims at long-term sustainable agriculture by protecting <b>topsoils,</b> increasing soil organic matter, and minimizing runoff and soil erosion, is mandatory for the future...|$|R

5|$|Drier {{parts of}} the country are highly prone to dust storms. These include areas west of Buenos Aires, which can average more than eight dust storms per year, and parts of Patagonia, owing to its aridity and windy climate. Certain areas in the Altiplano are also highly prone to dust storms owing to {{extensive}} areas of closed depressions and the presence of salt flats that erode the rock, which becomes a source of fine material that can travel large distances during periods of strong wind. Dust storms are more frequent during droughts, particularly in agricultural areas. Dust storms can effect large areas, leading to numerous impacts. These dust storms can lead to loss of crop and livestock, affecting the local economy. Productive <b>topsoil</b> may be lost during dust storms, leading to loss in soil productivity, which can increase soil erosion and negatively affect crop productivity in the long term. In addition to the impact on agriculture, dust storms can damage cars and buildings, lower visibility on roads, affect air quality, and affect water quality in rivers and lakes.|$|E
5|$|In West Virginia, 27river gauging {{stations}} were 1 in 100year events, mostly along the Potomac and Monongahela basins. As most of West Virginia's liveable land is along flood plains, the river flooding caused heavy {{damage in the}} state, mostly in the eastern portion. High waters washed away <b>topsoil</b> and thousands of trees, and over 13,000homes and businesses were damaged or destroyed in the state. Damage was estimated at nearly $700million, making it West Virginia's costliest flood, and there were 38deaths. Flooding also affected Maryland, although {{to a lesser degree}} than neighboring Virginia, with $21million in damage and one death. There was also tidal flooding in the state along the Chesapeake Bay from the storm, which washed away beaches just weeks after Hurricane Gloria affected the coastline. In Pennsylvania, flooding was worst along the Monongahela River in the state's southwest portion. During the storm, a power company opened the flood gates of the Lake Lynn dam along the river to preserve its integrity, triggering a class action lawsuit that ultimately failed. The floods damaged or destroyed 3,349houses in Pennsylvania, causing $83million in damage, as well as one death.|$|E
40|$|Major element {{compositions}} of 36 {{bulk samples}} and 41 clay samples, which {{were obtained from}} 47 <b>topsoils</b> collected in monsoonal eastern China, were investigated with conventional wet chemistry and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectrometry, respectively. Based on major element analyses, the mobility of major elements and latitudinal distributions of SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 ratio, chemical index of alteration (CIA), chemical index of weathering (CIW) and weathering index of Parker (WIP) were analyzed. Meanwhile, the suitability of these chemical weathering indices to <b>topsoils</b> in monsoonal eastern China and its controls were discussed. These investigations indicate that Na, K, Ca, Mg, and Si are relatively depleted, while Mn, P, Fe and Ti are relatively enriched in <b>topsoils</b> {{of the study area}} by comparison with their contents in the upper continent crust (UCC), and that alkali metal (Na, K) and alkaline earth metal (Ca, Mg) elements are generally easier to be depleted from their parent materials than other major elements during chemical weathering. The latitudinal distributions of CIA, CIW and WIP show that they are suitable to both bulk and clay samples, but SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 is only suitable to clay samples, not suitable in bulk ones. All these investigations indicate a significant dependence of grain-size in major element abundance and latitudinal distributions of SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3, CIA, CIW and WIP, but parent rock type has little effect on them, except its impact on the latitudinal distribution of WIP in clay samples. The significant grain-size dependence probably indicates the presence of unaltered minerals in bulk samples, thus we suggest that clay samples are more suitable to investigating chemical weathering of sediments on continents than bulk samples. The trivial effect of parent rock type probably indicates a relatively uniform chemical weathering on various parent rocks. Correlation analyses indicate that climate is the dominant control of chemical weathering of <b>topsoils</b> in the study area, and the significant latitude effect indicated by the spatial distributions of chemical weathering indices actually reflect the climate control on chemical weathering of <b>topsoils.</b> Chemical weathering indices actually reflect the integrated weathering history in the study area. Besides the dominant control of climate, other factors like tectonics, parent rock, biology, landform and soil depth and age might also have some effect on the chemical weathering of <b>topsoils</b> in the study area, which needs further research.

40|$|Polyaromatic {{hydrocarbon}} (PAH) sorption to soil is a {{key process}} deciding the transport and fate of PAH, and potential toxic impacts in the soil and groundwater ecosystems, for example in connection with atmospheric PAH deposition on soils. There are numerous studies on PAH sorption in relatively low organic porous media such as urban soils and groundwater sediments, but less {{attention has been given}} to cultivated soils. In this study, the phenanthrene partition coefficient, KD (liter per kilogram), was measured on 143 cultivated Danish soils (115 <b>topsoils,</b> 0 – 0. 25 -m soil depth and 28 subsoils, 0. 25 – 1 -m depth) by the single-point adsorption method. The organic carbon partition coefficient, KOC (liter per kilogram) for <b>topsoils</b> was found generally to fall between the KOC values estimated by the two most frequently used models for PAH partitioning, the Abdul et al. (Hazardous Waste & Hazardous Materials 4 (3) : 211 – 222, 1987) model and Karickhoff et al. (Water Research 13 : 241 – 248, 1979) model. A less-recognized model by Karickhoff (Chemosphere 10 : 833 – 846, 1981), yielding a KOC of 14, 918 Lkg− 1, closely corresponded to the average measured KOC value for the <b>topsoils,</b> and this model is therefore recommended for prediction of phenanthrene mobility in cultivated <b>topsoils.</b> For lower subsoils (0. 25 – 1 -m depth), the KOC values were closer to and mostly below the estimate by the Abdul et al. (Hazardous Waste & Hazardous Materials 4 (3) : 211 – 222, 1987) model. This implies a different organic matter composition and higher PAH sorption strength in cultivated <b>topsoils,</b> likely due to management effects including more rapid carbon turnover. Finally, we applied the recent Dexter et al. (Geoderma 144 : 620 – 627, 2008) theorem, and calculated the complexed organic carbon and non-complexed organic carbon fractions (COC and NCOC, grams per gram). Multiple regression analyses showed that the NCOC-based phenanthrene partition coefficient (KNCOC) could be markedly higher than the COCbased partition coefficient (KCOC) for soils with a clay/OC ratio < 10. This possibly higher PAH sorption affinity to the NCOC fraction needs further investigations to develop more realistic and accurate models for PAH mobility and effects in the environment, also with regard to colloid-facilitated PAH transport...|$|R
