40|$|In general, {{the quality}} of fruits depends on local {{conditions}} experienced by the fruit during its development. In cotton, fruit quality, and more specifically {{the quality of}} the fibre in the fruit, depends on interactions between fruit position in the plant architecture, temperature and agronomic practices, such as sowing time, mulching with plastic film and <b>topping</b> <b>of</b> the plant's main stem and branches. To quantify this response <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> fibre quality to environment and management, we developed a simulation model <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> growth and development, CottonXL. Simulation <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> fibre quality (strength, length and micronaire) was implemented at the level of each individual fruit, in relation to thermal time (represented by physiological age of the fruit) and prevailing temperature during development of each fruit. Field experiments were conducted in China in 2007 to determine model parameters, and independent data on cotton fibre quality in three cotton producing regions in China were used for model validation. Simulated values for fibre quality closely corresponded to experimental data. Scenario studies simulating a range of management practices predicted that delaying topping times can significantly decrease fibre quality, while sowing date and film mulching had no significant effect. We conclude that CottonXL may be used to explore options for optimizing cotton fibre quality by matching cotton management to the environment, taking into account responses at the level of individual fruits. The model may be used at plant, crop and regional levels to address climate and land-use change scenarios...|$|R

40|$|Cotton is a {{flammable}} {{material and}} some cottons would decompose or even self-ignite at bad {{storage and transport}} conditions. This paper studied the spontaneous combustion <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> from the aspect of thermal decomposition temperature (TDT) and critical ambient temperature (CAT). From Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analysis and chromatographic and mass spectrometric analysis, significant thermal decomposition was detected at the temperature of 210 ° C, which indicated that the TDT <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> was around 210 ° C. From TG analysis and small-scale CAT test, activation energy <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> and CAT <b>of</b> small <b>cotton</b> stack were obtained. Then, CATs <b>of</b> the <b>cotton</b> stacks with different dimensions were calculated based on Frank-Kamenetskii theory. With the dimensions l increased from 0. 2 to 3. 2 m, the CATs <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> decreased from 195. 0 to 137 : 9 ° C. The TDT <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> was higher than these CATs, and the differences between TDT and CAT <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> varied from almost 15 - 70 ° C (with the dimensions l increased from 0. 2 to 3. 2 m).

40|$|Abstract: Fibre blend {{should be}} {{composed}} regarding the requirements and allowable {{price of the}} textile end product. Using the appropriate raw material and optimised fibre blends we can influence the mechanical properties and regularity of a yarn as well as significantly {{reduce the number of}} yarn faults. The contribution presents a study of the influence of quality characteristics <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> fibres and constructional parameters of a yarn on the most important properties <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> yarn. The achieved results have been used for determination <b>of</b> optimised <b>cotton</b> fibre blends regarding the quality and price <b>of</b> a <b>cotton</b> yarn. A complex procedure <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> fibre blend determination significantly depends on suitable models for prediction of properties <b>of</b> resulting <b>cotton</b> yarns, in-depth knowledge <b>of</b> characteristics <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> fibres and consideration of parameters of a production process. The results of a theoretical part of the research have been summed up in a model <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> yarn engineering, which main components are regression model for prediction <b>of</b> properties <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> ring and rotor yarns, and model for optimisation <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> fibre blends regarding the quality and price. The regression prediction model has been designed using one of the popular artificial intelligence methods: the machine learning from examples. The prediction accuracy for forecasting the breaking tenacity, breaking extension, and regularity <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> yarns, as well as amount of yarn faults, was significantly improved. The obtained regression trees served as a basis for realisation of a model for optimisation <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> fibre blend...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aims: Cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) has {{indeterminate}} growth. The growth regulator {{mepiquat chloride}} (MC) is used worldwide to restrict vegetative growth and promote boll formation and yield. The effects of MC are modulated by complex interactions with growing conditions (nutrients, weather) and plant population density, {{and as a}} result the effects on plant form are not fully understood and are difficult to predict. The use of MC is thus hard to optimize. Methods: To explore crop responses to plant density and MC, a functional–structural plant model (FSPM) for cotton (named CottonXL) was designed. The model was calibrated using 1 year's field data, and validated by using two additional years of detailed experimental data on the effects of MC and plant density in stands <b>of</b> pure <b>cotton</b> and in intercrops <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> with wheat. CottonXL simulates development of leaf and fruits (square, flower and boll), plant height and branching. Crop development is driven by thermal time, population density, MC application, and <b>topping</b> <b>of</b> the main stem and branches. Key Results: Validation of the model showed good correspondence between simulated and observed values for leaf area index with an overall root-mean-square error of 0 · 50 m 2 m- 2, and with an overall prediction error of less than 10 % for number of bolls, plant height, number of fruit branches and number of phytomers. Canopy structure became more compact with the decrease of leaf area index and internode length due to the application of MC. Moreover, MC did not have a substantial effect on boll density but increased lint yield at higher densities. Conclusions: The model satisfactorily represents the effects of agronomic measures on cotton plant structure. It can be used to identify optimal agronomic management <b>of</b> <b>cotton</b> to achieve optimal plant structure for maximum yield under varying environmental conditions...|$|R
