25|$|On several {{occasions}} {{during the course}} of <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>study,</b> the NIMH voiced misgivings about the lack of scientific data researchers generated from <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>study</b> and the disorganized state of project records. Outside of the linguistics aspect of research David Rigler did not clearly define any parameters for the scope of the study, and both the extremely high volume and incoherence of the research team's data left the scientists unable to determine the importance of much of the information they collected. After the initial grant and a one-year extension Rigler proposed an additional three-year extension, and the NIMH's grants committee acknowledged that the study had clearly benefited Genie but concluded that the research team had not adequately addressed their concerns. In a unanimous decision the committee denied the extension request, cutting off further funding.|$|E

A book is published for this event, documenting successful e-business projects. <b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>studies</b> are selected through a public submission process and are written {{especially for the}} Orbit/Comdex fair by authors from partner universities. The University also runs <b>the</b> eXperience <b>case</b> <b>studies</b> platform 1, which contained 244 examples of successful e-business cases in April 2004. Since <b>case</b> <b>studies</b> are recognised as an essential way of learning, there are many providers of <b>case</b> <b>studies,</b> who develop <b>case</b> <b>studies</b> in similar yet different ways. Therefore, the task of this seminar paper is to evaluate existing international <b>case</b> <b>study</b> providers focusing on e-business and e-government, in order to analyse their operating models (especially the earnings) as well as size and structure of <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>studies.</b> This analysis will then be used to deduce an adapted classification structure for <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>studies</b> on <b>the</b> eXperience platform...|$|R

The stress on imitation in humans was not a popular subject when Girard developed his theories, but today there is independent support for his claims coming from empirical research in psychology and neuroscience (see below). Farneti (2013) also discusses the role of mimetic desire in intractable conflicts, using <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>study</b> of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and referencing Girard's theory. He posits that intensified conflict {{is a product of the}} imitative behaviors of Israelis and Palestinians, entitling them ‘Siamese twins'.|$|E
25|$|In June 1975, despite Genie's {{progress}} the National Institute of Mental Health cut {{off their}} funding for <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>study</b> on Genie. Shortly afterwards, {{in the early}} summer of 1975, Genie {{moved out of the}} Riglers' home to live with her mother. Despite the NIMH grant ending Curtiss continued to regularly meet with her, both administering weekly tests and spending time with her outside of test sessions, and the Riglers maintained contact with Genie and her mother. While living with her mother, Genie continued to be largely unresponsive to statements or requests. After a few months, Genie's mother had Genie transferred to the first of what would become a succession of foster homes.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Case</b> <b>Study</b> Final Report is {{the main}} focus so that ideal {{preparation}} may take place.; this report does, after all, contain all the entomological findings and conclusions relevant to the case. The report should be detailed thoroughly, but should still allow room for speculation, because forensic entomology is still a relatively new science, {{and it would be}} a bit overzealous for the forensic entomologist to announce full certainty on the subject; said speculation should not exist when it comes to the evidence. Disclosure of this report to the opposing side before the trial is recommended so that the defense and/or prosecution have time to consult another expert witness to look over the original findings.|$|E
25|$|In higher education, the {{analysis}} of students’ individual writing assignments after viewing films/documentaries presents an interesting case of using radical ‘messages’ within the aims of environmental education in order to trigger both student’s engagement and critical thinking. <b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>study</b> “If a Tree Falls and Everybody Hears the Sound” {{provides an example of}} how environmental advocacy and the objective of pluralistic education can be combined as mutually supportive means of achieving both democratic learning in which students’ individual opinions are seen as extremely valuable, and simultaneously provide an example of the type of ecopedagogy that supports learning for environmental sustainability. The role of environmental advocacy can be crucially important if the interests of all planetary citizens—and not just one species—are to be taken seriously.|$|E
25|$|Several {{people have}} also {{emphasized}} {{the lack of}} distinction between Genie's caretakers and her therapists. Shurley thought that Ruch {{would have been the}} best guardian for Genie, and felt the Riglers gave her adequate care but viewed her as a test subject first. Russ Rymer contended that the roles of everyone involved in Genie's life became progressively clear, citing the starting point as the appointment of John Miner as legal counsel for Genie's mother, and that personal friendships prevented them from recognizing it. He argued that this interfered with providing Genie the best possible care and compromised their objectivity, which in turn contributed to the case study's lack of coherence, and both he and Harlan Lane emphasized that making David Rigler a foster parent accelerated this breakdown. Several independent reviews of Genie's case also accused the Riglers and the other scientists of abandoning Genie after <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>study</b> concluded.|$|E
40|$|This {{report is}} the result of the {{collaboration}} of the partners of the AGREE work-package “Economic and environmental analysis”, which is based on <b>case</b> <b>study</b> analyses of <b>the</b> partners in seven countries of <b>the</b> EU. <b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>studies</b> show economic and environmental trade-offs in the different regions in the EU, for which each partner is responsible. Nevertheless prior to the reporting of <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>studies</b> an intensive discussion on a common methodological approach has been accomplished and applied to <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>studies.</b> <b>The</b> <b>case</b> <b>studies</b> show a wide range of different perspectives of energy efficiency in agriculture, but they are all based on the common methodology presented in Chapter 3. In Chapter 4, <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>studies</b> are presented, with authors indicated at the beginning of each section. Each section of Chapter 4 ends with a synthesis analysis of the results from <b>the</b> different <b>case</b> <b>studies.</b> Chapter 5 summarizes and concludes the report by highlighting the major findings of the analyses. The report builds upon the “State of the Art in Energy Efficiency in Europe” published separately by the AGREE consortium (Gołaszewski et al. 2012), which shows the status quo of energy use and possible energy efficiency measures in agriculture across different production systems and regions in Europe.
