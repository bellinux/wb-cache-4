5|$|Andy Harries {{was born}} in Inverness, Scotland on 7 April 1954 {{and grew up in}} Peterborough, England, {{receiving}} primary education at West Town Primary School until 1961, and secondary education at the public Oakham School. He grew up aspiring <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> correspondent in Vietnam, or an investigative journalist; his idols were Harold Evans, Jon Swain and John Pilger. He left college at the age of 17 with poor A Level results and became a trainee reporter on the Peterborough Evening Telegraph newspaper. His time on the newspaper raised his awareness of politics, and he sought to further his understanding of it by studying at university. He applied to various northern universities to break away from his southern middle-class lifestyle, and was accepted at Hull University.|$|E
5|$|In 1939 he {{made the}} {{decision}} that if there was going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>war,</b> {{he wanted to be a}} fighter pilot, and so immediately joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve. Within three months Lock had been called up and began flight training. On the outbreak of War in September 1939, as a trained pilot Lock joined the RAF as a sergeant pilot. After further training at No. 6 Flying School RAF Little Rissington, he was commissioned as a pilot officer (service number 81642) and posted to No. 41 Squadron at RAF Catterick, North Yorkshire, flying Spitfires.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of a world {{financial}} crisis, the King encouraged the formation of a National Government in 1931 led by MacDonald and Baldwin, and volunteered to reduce the civil list to help balance the budget. He was concerned by the rise to power in Germany of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. In 1934, the King bluntly told the German ambassador Leopold von Hoesch that Germany was now the peril of the world, and that there was bound <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> within ten years if she went on at the present rate; he warned the British ambassador in Berlin Eric Phipps to be suspicious of the Nazis.|$|E
50|$|During World War II he {{was drafted}} into the U.S. Army and <b>was</b> {{assigned}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> official <b>war</b> artist. In this capacity he traveled and painted in China, India and Burma.|$|R
25|$|Count's Feud, from 1534 <b>to</b> 1536, <b>was</b> <b>a</b> civil <b>war</b> {{over the}} Reformation of Denmark.|$|R
25|$|Hydrogen sulfide {{was used}} by the British Army as a {{chemical}} weapon during World War I. It <b>was</b> not considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> ideal <b>war</b> gas, but, while other gases were in short supply, it was used on two occasions in 1916.|$|R
25|$|The {{incident}} {{provoked a}} furious outburst in the United States, especially when Germany refused to apologize, instead countering that the destroyer was operating in what Germany considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> zone and had suffered the consequences. The {{sinking of the}} Reuben James did not lead the US to declare war on Germany; it did, however, provide a pretext to officially transfer the US Coast Guard from its peacetime role as {{an arm of the}} US Treasury Department to a wartime function as part of the US Navy. Congress also amended the Neutrality Act to permit the arming of US-registered merchant ships and authorized them to enter European waters {{for the first time since}} 1939.|$|E
500|$|Chilembwe {{opposed the}} {{recruitment}} of Nyasa people to fight what he considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> totally unconnected to them. He promoted a form of Christian pacifism and argued {{that the lack of}} civil rights for Africans in the colonial system should exempt them from the duties of military service. In November 1914, following reports of large loss of life during fighting at Karonga, Chilembwe wrote a letter to The Nyasaland Times in Blantyre, explicitly appealing to the colonial authorities not to recruit black troops: ...|$|E
500|$|While {{this proved}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> winning formulae, the New Model Army being {{organized}} and politically active {{went on to}} dominate {{the politics of the}} Interregnum and by 1660 was widely disliked. The New Model Army was paid off and disbanded at the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660. For many decades the excesses of the New Model Army under the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell was a horror story and the Whig element recoiled from allowing a standing army. [...] The militia acts of 1661 and 1662 prevented local authorities from calling up militia and oppressing their own local opponents. Calling up the militia was possible only if the king and local elites agreed to do so.|$|E

50|$|At {{the age of}} 16, he saw his prized cocker spaniel, Monsieur Grenouille, {{gunned down}} in what <b>was</b> later {{discovered}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> turf <b>war</b> between local French gangs. This pivotal event caused the fragile young singer to turn to a brutal and violent life of crime.|$|R
50|$|After his retirement, Tasnim <b>was</b> {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{treated as}} <b>a</b> <b>war</b> {{hero in the}} news media, and inspected the Hangor from her decommissioning in 2006.|$|R
500|$|... 1602, Nick Lowe and Joe Quesada, {{approached}} Gaiman after Quesada became Marvel's Editor in Chief {{with the}} intent for Gaiman {{to work on a}} project for Marvel. Gaiman eventually agreed to write a Marvel comic in August 2001, although he was not sure what it would contain. When the September 11, 2001 attacks occurred, Gaiman decided {{that he did not want}} planes, skyscrapers, bombs or guns in his comic. [...] "I didn't want it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> story, and I didn't want to write a story in which might made right – or in which might made anything." [...] On a trip to Venice soon after, Gaiman was struck by how the [...] "past seemed very close at hand"; he returned from the trip knowing the story he wanted to tell. The time was chosen because [...] "it was a nice place to set the story. It gave me America and it gave me a lot of things that I wanted in terms of the way the world was changing. It also gave me the sense of wonder and magic." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1922, a {{competition}} was {{launched by the}} trustees of the Melbourne Public Library for a mural to commemorate the Great War. Rix Nicholas learned of the competition and quickly prepared and submitted an entry. Three judges, all respected Melbourne academic artists, submitted {{a report to the}} trustees, who met to consider the entries received. The trustees voted six to five to grant the commission to Harold Septimus Power, {{despite the fact that he}} had not fulfilled the conditions of entry; they then withheld the judges' report from publication, decided not to exhibit any of the competition entries, and delayed awarding any prize. One newspaper reported that Rix Nicholas's entry had been one of the top three. Rix Nicholas was furious, as were some former soldiers who wrote letters to newspapers about the incident. Pigot suggests that gender was a factor: [...] "While Rix Nicholas's claim <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> artist was legitimate, the fact that she was a woman meant that she was denied an equal place within the discourse". Later that same year, the Australian War Memorial decided to purchase a work by Rix Nicholas portraying a French woman (titled A Mother of France (1914)), but not to acquire the other work offered, showing an Australian soldier (A Man (1921)); according to Pigot, this reflected the gendered approach taken by institutions, which considered that subjects suitable for portrayal by artists were dependent upon their sex.|$|E
2500|$|The Macedonian {{government}} also claimed the so-called Vejce massacre, in which Albanian insurgents ambushed and killed eight Macedonian soldiers, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> crime. According to these claims, soldiers {{captured by the}} insurgents were, executed, mutilated, and burned. The claims were not verified by international observers, and to this day, the bodies have not been {{released to the public}} or to civilian investigators and autopsies were carried out in a military morgue. But ...|$|E

25|$|According to some commentators, {{the war of}} Gog and Magog envisioned in Ezekiel 38 <b>is</b> {{expected}} <b>to</b> {{occur in}} the end of days. This <b>is</b> described <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> climactic <b>war</b> that <b>is</b> said <b>to</b> occur {{at the end of the}} Jewish exile. Radak comments on Zechariah 14, that {{in the end of}} days Jerusalem will be the battle ground of Gog and Magog.|$|R
25|$|Sullivan County {{was formed}} in 1817. It was named for Daniel Sullivan, said by some sources <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> <b>a</b> Revolutionary <b>War</b> general killed by Native Americans while {{carrying}} a dispatch between Fort Vincennes and Louisville.|$|R
2500|$|Soon {{after the}} {{outbreak}} of World War I, the threat to British shipping from German submarines became increasingly apparent, with numerous losses occurring during October and November 1914. Then, on 4 February 1915, a communiqué issued by the Imperial German Admiralty declared that: [...] "All the waters surrounding Great Britain and Ireland, are hereby declared <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> zone. From February 18 onwards every enemy merchant vessel found within this war zone will be destroyed." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 6 December 1845, Mitchel's article [...] "Oregon—Ireland" [...] {{referred}} to the dispute then pending between England and America about Oregon. He wrote, [...] "If there is <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> between England and the United States, tis impossible for us to pretend sympathy with the former. We shall have allies, not enemies, {{on the banks of}} the Columbia, and distant and desolate as are those tracts beyond the Rocky Mountains, even there may arise an opportunity for demanding and regaining our place among the nations." ...|$|E
2500|$|At The Dragon's shop, the Dragon hears his windchimes ring as a dark lime smoke enters. The smoke {{takes the}} form of the Evil Queen, {{something}} that does not surprise him. The Evil Queen tells the Dragon that he was right about one thing: there was a battle raging within Regina. She then laughs that Regina should have never let her out to play. Now that she's out, there's going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>war.</b> With a dark smirk, she rips out the Dragon's heart, but doesn't crush it. Grinning, she declares, [...] "The Queen is back." ...|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} in France, in Alsace where he spent his childhood. Very early, he went <b>to</b> America. He <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> {{reporter}} in Lebanon, Chad, Cambodia and Afghanistan.

50|$|A Long Way to Shiloh (known in the US as The Menorah Men {{so as not}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> thought <b>a</b> Civil <b>War</b> novel) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> thriller by Lionel Davidson. The book won the Crime Writers' Association's Gold Dagger Award.|$|R
25|$|The Ulster Volunteers <b>were</b> <b>a</b> unionist militia {{founded in}} 1912 to block Home Rule for Ireland. In 1913 they {{organised}} {{themselves into the}} Ulster Volunteer Force to give armed resistance to the prospective Third Home Rule Act (enacted in 1914). With a rival Irish Volunteers being formed by nationalists in response, outright civil war in Ireland seemed possible. However, the outbreak of World War I intervened: the Act was put in abeyance until after what <b>was</b> expected <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> short <b>war.</b>|$|R
2500|$|One notable {{exception}} was Huningue and its governor General Barbanègre who commanded a garrison of only 500 men against 25,000 Austrians. On the 28 June shortly after word of Napoleon's abdication became known, and the French Provisional Government had requested a ceasefire, Barbanègre ordered the bombardment of neighboring Swiss Basel something that contemporaries on the Seventh Coalition side considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> crime. At its {{surrender to the}} Austrians on 26 August 1815, the city was a ruin and the fortifications were demolished {{under the terms of}} [...] of the Treaty of Paris (1815) at the request of Basel.|$|E
2500|$|He made {{numerous}} {{offers to}} mediate and sent Colonel House on diplomatic missions; both sides politely dismissed these overtures. When Britain declared a blockade of neutral ships carrying contraband goods to Germany, Wilson mildly protested non-lethal British violations of neutral rights; the British {{knew that it}} would not be a casus belli for the United States. In early 1915 Germany declared the waters around Great Britain <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> zone; Wilson dispatched a note of protest, imposing [...] "strict accountability" [...] on Germany for the safety of neutral ships. The meaning of the policy, dubiously applied to specific incidents, evolved with the policy of neutrality, but ultimately formed the substance of U.S. responses over the next two years.|$|E
2500|$|The Germans {{used to tell}} me, and I got to {{know them}} well because I played soccer against them and with them and so forth. But they {{used to tell me}} that you guys are blessed. What we know about the Indians in Canada. They are blessed. But that blessing is being {{destroyed}} by your immigrants that are going over there. Especially the Jews, they said. The Second World War was started by the Jews and the Third World War, whatever it is, is between Israel and the Arab countries. I was there as well. But there's going <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> because the Israelis and the “Bushies” [...] you know, the bully, the bigot in the United States [...] tells you that if you're not with me you're against me.|$|E
25|$|A Long Way to Shiloh (known in the USA as The Menorah Men {{so as not}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> thought <b>a</b> Civil <b>War</b> novel) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> thriller by Lionel Davidson, {{published}} in 1966, whose plot follows the finding and contents of a similar treasure scroll.|$|R
50|$|From 1939 <b>to</b> 1943 he <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> refugee in Romania and Algiers. In 1943 {{he arrived}} in Britain and from 1945 to 1949 he {{attended}} The Ruskin School of Drawing and Fine Art, Oxford. From 1971 to 1986 {{he worked as a}} Research Assistant in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at University College London.|$|R
50|$|Defence issues became {{increasingly}} dominant in public affairs {{with the rise}} of fascism in Europe and militant Japan in Asia. The UAP largely supported the western powers in their policy of appeasement, however veteran UAP minister Billy Hughes <b>was</b> <b>an</b> exception and he embarrassed the government with his 1935 book Australia and the War Today which exposed a lack of preparation in Australia for what Hughes correctly supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> coming <b>war.</b> Hughes <b>was</b> forced <b>to</b> resign, but the Lyons government tripled its defence budget.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the episode}} [...] "Padre de Familia" [...] (season 6, 2007), Herbert is {{revealed}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> veteran and sings [...] "God Bless the USA" [...] in the Veterans Day parade. This is furthered {{in the season}} 9 [...] (2011) episode [...] "German Guy", in which Herbert reveals {{he was a member}} of the United States Army Air Forces during World War II and was captured by Wehrmacht forces when he was shot down over Germany while escorting a bombing raid. Although the Nazis could have placed Herbert into a prisoner-of-war camp, they instead threw him into a concentration camp because they found several pictures of young boys in his wallet and thought he was gay. He then finds that his tormentor, Franz, is living in Quahog, and becomes jealous of his new friendship with Chris.|$|E
2500|$|Ibadan {{came into}} {{existence}} in 1829, {{during a period of}} turmoil that characterized Yorubaland at the time. It was in this period that many old Yoruba cities such as old Oyo (Oyo ile), Ijaye and Owu disappeared, and newer ones such as Abeokuta, new Oyo (Oyo atiba) and Ibadan sprang up to replace them. According to local historians, Lagelu founded the city, and was initially intended <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>war</b> camp for warriors coming from Oyo, Ife and Ijebu. As a forest site containing several ranges of hills, varying in elevation from 160 to 275 metres, the location of the camp offered strategic defence opportunities. Moreover, its location at the fringe of the forest (from which the city got its name) promoted its emergence as a marketing centre for traders and goods from both the forest and grassland areas.|$|E
2500|$|A {{separate}} {{complaint was}} that the Allies did not really mean to respect the territorial integrity of Paraguay, because they meant to help themselves to large portions of Paraguayan territory. [...] However, this objection presupposes that those territories were, in international law, Paraguayan, {{when in fact they}} had long been in dispute. [...] No third party State recognised anyone's claim to those territories; and like considerable parts of South America they were not really effectively occupied by anyone, except the aboriginal inhabitants. [...] Brazil and Paraguay had been in dispute about the borders between Paraguay and the Mato Grosso; and large parts of the territories of the Chaco and the Misiones were in dispute between Paraguay and Argentina. [...] Thus the territories were genuinely in dispute, and in the nineteenth century it was not surprising that, if there was <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>war,</b> the victor should occupy territories in dispute as the spoils of victory.|$|E
2500|$|Australian anxiety at the {{prospect}} of Japanese expansionism and war in the Pacific continued through the 1930s. Billy Hughes, by then a minister in the United Australia Party's Lyons Government, made a notable contribution to Australia's attitude towards immigration in a 1935 speech in which he argued that [...] "Australia must... populate or perish". However Hughes <b>was</b> forced <b>to</b> resign in 1935 after his book Australia and the <b>War</b> Today exposed <b>a</b> lack of preparation in Australia for what Hughes correctly supposed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> coming <b>war.</b>|$|R
50|$|After the {{conflict}} ended, Santa Fe <b>was</b> considered <b>to</b> <b>be</b> worthless as <b>a</b> <b>war</b> prize {{because she was}} non-standard, obsolete, badly damaged and too expensive to repair. As a result, the submarine was temporarily raised by the British, towed into deep water and scuttled on 10 February 1985.|$|R
25|$|After {{the signing}} of the Oslo Accords failed to bring about a Palestinian state, in September 2000 the Second Intifada (uprising) broke out, a period of {{intensified}} Palestinian–Israeli violence, which has been taking place until the present day. The Second Intifada has caused thousands of victims on both sides, both among combatants and among civilians, and has been more deadly than the first Intifada. Many Palestinians consider the Second Intifada <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> legitimate <b>war</b> of national liberation against foreign occupation, whereas many Israelis consider it <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> terrorist campaign.|$|R
