40|$|Abstract. Steel {{bifurcated}} pipe is one {{important part of}} the water diversion buildings in a hydropower station. And its hydraulic characteristics are crucial to reduce the head loss of the bifurcated section. The numerical simulation was carried out with spherical <b>trifurcate</b> branch pipe, shell type <b>trifurcate</b> branch pipe without deflecting plates and shell type <b>trifurcate</b> branch pipe with deflecting plates under a serious of operating conditions based on a case study. After this, the flow conditions and the head losses in the bifurcated sections were analyzed. The shell type <b>trifurcate</b> branch pipe with deflecting plates had the most advantageous hydraulic characteristics of the three schemes. The shell type and the deflecting plates improved the flow condition effectively. The scheme could improve the flow condition and reduce the head loss of the bifurcation section effectively. The results might provide some references to the {{bifurcated pipe}} design and operation...|$|R
50|$|The Rangit dam is 45 m high {{concrete}} gravity structure of 100 m length. The reservoir created behind the dam has a storage capacity of 1,175,000 cubic metres. The storage created is utilized for hydropower generation at a surface Powerhouse {{located on the}} left bank of the Rangit River. The diversion of flow from the reservoir to the surface Powerhouse is effected through an Intake leading to a concrete lined Head Race Tunnel (HRT) of 4.5 m diameter (Horse shoe shaped and concrete lined) of 3 km length, a Surge Shaft (14 m diameter and of 60 m depth {{at the end of}} the HRT with control arrangement followed by one main penstock pipe (of 3.5 m diameter and length of 270 m) <b>trifurcating</b> into three lines of 2 m diameter each (with a total length of all three lines is 59 m) to connect to the three Francis Turbine Generating Units of 20 MW capacity each, through the MIVs. The tailwaters from the turbines are led back into the river through a combined short tailrace channel. The firm power generation is of the order of 39 MW corresponding to annual energy generation of 340 GWh (in a 90% dependable year). The ruling levels for power generation are: in the reservoir, Full Reservoir Level (FRL) of 639 m and Minimum Draw Down Level (MDDL) of 627 m), the Normal Tail Water Level (NTWL) in the Tail Race Channel from the Powerhouse of 512 m and under an operating gross head of 127 m.

40|$|<b>Trifurcating</b> {{coronary}} artery disease is a complex atherosclerotic process involving the origin of one or more of three side branches arising from a left main {{coronary artery}}. With the emergence of drug-eluting stents, interventional cardiologists have become more aggressive in treating this kind of complex diseases, also in patients with an unprotected left main disease. Few series of percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on significant lesions of the left main trifurcations have been described, approached with dissimilar techniques in the best attempt of avoiding life-threatening complications.

40|$|Background: Abdominal donor-site flaps {{based on}} the deep {{inferior}} epigastric artery (DIEA) {{are the most common}} flaps used in autologous breast reconstruction. With significant variation in the vascular anatomy of the DIEA, preoperative imaging is desirable. Computed tomographic angiography, recently described for this purpose, uniquely demonstrates the branching pattern of the DIEA. The authors sought to correlate the DIEA branching pattern to the location and course of perforators as a preoperative planning tool for perforator flaps. Methods: Forty-five cadaveric hemi–abdominal walls were used for contrast injection of the DIEA with subsequent radiographic imaging. The branching pattern on radiography was thus correlated to the location and intramuscular course of perforators, from the main DIEA trunk to the point of the penetrating rectus sheath. Results: The DIEA branching pattern correlated closely with the course of perforators. A bifurcating (type II) branching pattern demonstrated a reduced transverse distance traversed by each perforator, whereas a <b>trifurcating</b> (type III) branching pattern demonstrated significantly greater transverse distances (p = 0. 0002). Type I vessels were intermediate. Vessel branching type, however, displayed no significant correlation with the number of perforators (p = 0. 56). Conclusions: The distances traversed by perforators were significantly reduced with a bifurcating branching pattern of the DIEA, particularly those originating from the lateral branch, and were greatest with a <b>trifurcating</b> branching pattern. Increased transverse distances correlate with greater rectus muscle sacrificed during perforator flap surgery. As computed tomographic angiography is the optimal modality for demonstrating this pattern preoperatively, the authors suggest its use for preoperative assessment in transverse rectus abdominis musculocutaneous and DIEA perforator flaps. 7 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Variations in the {{arterial}} {{pattern of}} the upper extremity are numerous and have been documented. Superficially placed arteries in the cubital fossa may be mistaken for cutaneous veins and may lead to intra-arterial injection instead of the intended intra-venous one. This may lead to serious complications like haemorrhage, necrosis of forearm or digits, or arterio-venous fistula. Compression symptoms may occur when arteries run an abnormal course through muscles. We report here a rare observation during routine cadaveric dissection of the right brachial artery passing superficial to the bicipital aponeurosis and then <b>trifurcating</b> 2. 5 cm distal to the bend of elbow into radial artery, ulnar artery and a recurrent muscular branch to brachialis muscle.

40|$|AbstractWe {{describe}} {{a case of}} a 45 -year-old man presenting with acute myocardial infarction investigated by computed tomography coronary angiography. Interestingly all three coronary arteries arose from the right coronary cusp. The left anterior descending artery (LAD) subtended an acute angle from the aortic root, associated with significant kinking and stenosis at the ostium, before passing anteriorly, taking a sub-pulmonic course and descending in the anterior interventricular groove. The distal vessel was small with an atrophic appearance. The circumflex artery followed a retro-aortic route, before <b>trifurcating</b> to supply the lateral and posterior walls of the left ventricle. The right coronary artery was normal. Given his unstable presentation and the potentially lethal course of the LAD, he was referred for grafting of the LAD vessel which successfully ameliorated his symptoms and has thus far prevented recurrent myocardial infarction. <Learning objective: Computed tomography coronary angiography is becoming increasingly accessible to physicians for the investigation of patients with suspected coronary disease and the planning of surgery. As such, coronary anomalies are likely to be encountered more frequently, and it is important to appreciate their clinical significance. ...|$|E
40|$|A new {{phylogeny}} {{is introduced}} for Lower and Middle Devonian delthyridoid spiriferids with plicated fold and sulcus and bifurcating and <b>trifurcating</b> ribs. The new interpretation {{is based on}} side-by-side comparison of the type species of the genera with special focus on the micro-ornamentation and the style of ribbing, especially in the sulcus. During the revision of this group the following taxa are proposed: Multispiriferidae fam. nov, Ovetensispirifer novascotianus gen. et sp. nov., Turcispirifer turciae gen. et. sp. nov.; three taxa are described in open nomenclature: gen. nov.

40|$|We {{describe}} the first three-dimensional imaging of {{the termination of}} a continent-ocean fracture zone (COFZ), the Chain Fracture Zone, located offshore of the Niger Delta. The COFZ marks the abrupt transition between extended continental crust, comprising multiple half-graben, and oceanic crust that has a pervasive seafloor-spreading fabric. It preserves a history of continent-continent shearing followed by oceanic crust accretion and continent-ocean shearing during the inception of Atlantic rifting. The termination is marked by steeply dipping faults with sigmoidal planform and thrusts that probably formed {{as a result of}} continent-continent or continent-ocean shearing. These are crosscut by the seafloor-spreading fabric that formed during the subsequent phase of oceanic crust accretion. The accreted oceanic crust is cut by listric and planar faults that curve {{in the direction of the}} COFZ, where they terminate. The transition from continental to oceanic crust across the COFZ is sharp and resolvable to ∼ 100 – 200 m. Complexes of lava flows emanate from volcanoes along the COFZ, bifurcating and <b>trifurcating</b> down the volcano flanks. The volcanoes are 2 – 5. 5 km wide and 1. 4 km in height relative to adjacent oceanic crust and were injected at the COFZ, probably as the spreading center migrated along it...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Recent {{advances}} in massively parallel sequencing {{have increased the}} depth at which T cell receptor (TCR) repertoires can be probed by > 3 log 10, allowing for saturation sequencing of immune repertoires. The resolution of this sequencing is dependent on its accuracy, and direct assessments of the errors formed during high throughput repertoire analyses are limited. Results We analyzed 3 monoclonal TCR from TCR transgenic, Rag -/- mice using Illumina ® sequencing. A total of 27 sequencing reactions were performed for each TCR using a <b>trifurcating</b> design in which samples were divided into 3 at significant processing junctures. More than 20 million complementarity determining region (CDR) 3 sequences were analyzed. Filtering for lower quality sequences diminished but did not eliminate sequence errors, which occurred within 1 - 6 % of sequences. Erroneous sequences were pre-dominantly of correct length and contained single nucleotide substitutions. Rates of specific substitutions varied dramatically in a position-dependent manner. Four substitutions, all purine-pyrimidine transversions, predominated. Solid phase amplification and sequencing rather than liquid sample amplification and preparation {{appeared to be the}} primary sources of error. Analysis of polyclonal repertoires demonstrated the impact of error accumulation on data parameters. Conclusions Caution is needed in interpreting repertoire data due to potential contamination with mis-sequence reads. However, a high association of errors with phred score, high relatedness of erroneous sequences with the parental sequence, dominance of specific nt substitutions, and skewed ratio of forward to reverse reads among erroneous sequences indicate approaches to filter erroneous sequences from repertoire data sets. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- The aim of {{this study}} was to review the {{appearance}} of normal patterns of left coronary artery, its anatomic variants and anomalies and to assess their incidence in subjects of North India who underwent 64 -slice Computed Tomographic Coronary Angiography (CT-CA) for suspected or known coronary artery disease (CAD). This study was carried out in the Departments of Anatomy and Radiodiagnosis, KGMU, U. P, Lucknow, India. Fifty CT Coronary Angiograms of routine subjects of either sex and of different age groups coming to the department of Radiodiagnosis were evaluated prospectively to see the normal and variant anatomy of Left Coronary Artery (LCA) regarding its origin, length of main trunk and branching pattern. In all the cases LCA arose either below the Sinotubular (ST) junction from Left Posterior Aortic Sinus (LPAS) or from ST junction except one which demonstrated a high take off from tubular part of ascending aorta. The LCA had a mean length of 7. 11 ± 3. 04 mm. The two main branches of LCA are Left Circumflex (LCX) artery and Left Anterior Descending (LAD) artery. This study revealed that the main trunk of LCA bifurcated into LCX artery and LAD artery in 38 (76 %) subjects. The artery was seen to be <b>trifurcating</b> in 12 (24 %) cases with the Ramus Intermedius (RI) being the third artery. Left coronary artery is one of the feeding arteries of the heart, so a detailed knowledge of its anatomy is very important.

40|$|Introduction: In {{spite of}} its {{importance}} as an experimental model, {{the information on the}} left coronary artery in pigs is sparse. Objective: To determine the morphologic features of the left coronary artery in pigs. Methods: We evaluated 158 pig hearts. The left coronary artery was perfused with synthetic resin after their ostia had been catheterized. Diameters and courses of the vascular beds were measured with an electronic caliper (Mitutoyo(r)). Results: The diameter of left coronary artery was 6. 98 &# 177; 1. 56 mm and its length was 3. 51 &# 177; 0. 99 mm. It was found to end up by bifurcating itself into the anterior interventricular artery and the circumflex artery in 79 % of the cases, and by <b>trifurcating</b> in 21 % of the cases, with the presence of the diagonal artery. The anterior interventricular artery ended up at the apex in 79. 7 % of the cases, and the circumflex artery at the posterior aspect of the left ventricle in 64 % of the case, this artery never reached the posterior interventricular sulcus. An anastomosis between the terminal branches of the anterior interventricular artery and the posterior interventricular artery was found in 7. 6 % of the specimens. The antero-superior branch of the anterior interventricular artery occurred in 89. 9 % of the hearts. A left marginal branch was observed in 87. 9 % of the cases with a diameter of 2. 25 &# 177; 0. 55 mm.
