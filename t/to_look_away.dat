5|$|Another major {{childhood}} {{influence was}} Heigo Kurosawa, Akira's older brother by four years. In {{the aftermath of}} the Great Kantō earthquake of 1923, which devastated Tokyo, Heigo took the 13-year-old Akira to view the devastation. When the younger brother wanted <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>away</b> from the human corpses and animal carcasses scattered everywhere, Heigo forbade him to do so, instead encouraging Akira to face his fears by confronting them directly. Some commentators have suggested that this incident would influence Kurosawa's later artistic career, as the director was seldom hesitant to confront unpleasant truths in his work.|$|E
5|$|Musidora: The Bather 'At the Doubtful Breeze Alarmed, {{also known}} as The Bather, is a name given to four nearly {{identical}} oil paintings on canvas by English artist William Etty. The paintings illustrate a scene from James Thomson's 1727 poem Summer in which a young man accidentally sees a young woman bathing naked, and is torn between his desire to look and his knowledge that he ought <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>away.</b> The scene was popular with English artists as {{it was one of}} the few legitimate pretexts to paint nudes at a time when the display and distribution of nude imagery was suppressed.|$|E
5|$|With the CSBS the {{sighting}} system and calculator {{were the same}} device, which required the bombsight to be fairly large. With this restriction removed, the sight head was much smaller and lighter than the older versions. The resulting sight head was easy to mount on a stabilizer system, adapted from the same Sperry gyroscope as earlier experiments. With the sight head stabilized, the bomb aimer could continue to measure drift even as he indicated turns to the pilot, eliminating the need to correct, re-measure and correct again. The remote console and second operator eliminated {{the need for the}} bomb aimer <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>away</b> from the sights, to make adjustments while on the bomb run. As a result of these changes, short aiming periods of a few seconds would be enough for an accurate drop.|$|E

25|$|The dashboard's design {{originated}} {{from a large}} number of complaints from customers that the previous Taurus' radio and climate control modules were cluttered with many small and similar feeling buttons, as well as small graphics, which caused the driver to have <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>away</b> from the road to be able to operate them properly. As a result, {{a large portion of the}} third generation's dash was devoted to the radio and climate control, with each button on these modules containing a unique design, making it easier for the driver to operate the radio and climate control without taking their eyes off the road. This would eventually lead to the creation of the Integrated Control Panel.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, Farmer {{focused the}} efforts of the {{institution}} on Bahá'í themes. In her words in 1902:My joy in the Persian Revelation is not that it reveals one of the streams flowing to the great Ocean of Life, Light and Love, but that it is a perfect mirror of that Ocean. What, in Green Acre, was a vision and a hope becomes, through it a blessed reality now. It has illuminated for me every other expression of Truth which I had hitherto known and place my feet on a Rock from which they cannot be moved. And it is the Manifestation of the Fatherhood - Behá'u'lláh (ed - as it was spelled in those days) - who had taught me <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>away</b> from even the Greatest and find within the One 'Powerful, Mighty, and Supreme' who is to be the Redeemer of my life. It is a Revelation of Unity such as I had never before found. By means of its Light, as shown the life of the Master Abbas Abdul Beha, I have entered into a joy greater than any I have hitherto known. Green Acre was established as a means to that end and in proportion as well lay aside all spirit of criticism of others and seek only to live the Unity we find, shall we be able to help others to the same divine realization.|$|E
40|$|Cognition*Recent data {{indicate}} that under a specific posthypnotic suggestion to circumvent reading, highly sug-gestible subjects successfully eliminated the Stroop interference effect. The present study examined whether an optical explanation (e. g., visual blurring or <b>looking</b> <b>away)</b> could account for this finding. Using cy-clopentolate hydrochloride eye drops to pharmacologically prevent visual accommodation in all subjects, behavioral Stroop {{data were collected from}} six highly hypnotizables and six less suggestibles using an optical setup that guaranteed either sharply focused or blurred vision. The highly suggestibles performed the Stroop task when naturally vigilant, under posthypnotic suggestion not to read, and while visually blurred; the less suggestibles ran naturally vigilant, while <b>looking</b> <b>away,</b> and while visually blurred. Al-though visual accommodation was precluded for all subjects, posthypnotic suggestion effectively eliminated Stroop interference and was comparable <b>to</b> <b>looking</b> <b>away</b> in controls. These data strengthen the view that Stroop interference is neither robust nor inevitable and support the hypothesis that posthypnotic suggestion may exert a top-down influence on neural processing...|$|R

[...] Fairy tale lecturer Jack Zipes alike noted that [...] "it is somewhat strange that the queen believes the mirror, for the picture of Snow White reveals {{that she is a}} pretty pubescent red-cheeked ordinary girl while the queen is a stunning beautiful mature woman who might easily win a beauty contest." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Matt Roush from USA Today said Steve Railsback's performance as Duane Barry rivaled {{that of his}} portrayal of Charles Manson in the 1976 television miniseries Helter Skelter. An unnamed reviewer from the Contra Costa Times called the episode [...] "seminal". San Jose Mercury News said Railsback gave {{what was to be}} the [...] "ultimate X-Files performance" [...] in 2002 after the show had been cancelled. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, gave the episode a glowing review and rated it five stars out of five. The two called it [...] "a career best for Chris Carter" [...] and praised his writing and directing, noting that both were [...] "powerfully" [...] and [...] "passionately" [...] done. Shearman and Pearson also applauded the episode's simplicity, citing it as the factor that made the entry stand out from others. [...] Zack Handlen from The A.V.

Kimlinger criticized Araki's direction, saying he [...] "clearly intends it to be powerful and unsettling, but it's just crude and unpleasant." [...] On the other hand, other critics from Anime News Network praised much of the series. Rebecca Silverman said it [...] "is both gorgeous and appalling in its visuals", and [...] "an excellent mix of what 18th century Gothic novelist Ann Radcliffe defined as horror versus terror: the one is physical, making you want <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>away,</b> and the other is intellectual, making you want to know what's going to happen next." [...] Though there are several apocalyptic action shows, Carlo Santos noted that [...] "few get as close to perfection as Attack on Titan does". Santos described it as [...] "a masterpiece of death and destruction" [...] even if he only watched the first episode. Theron Martin of Anime News Network praised the musical score and the [...] "intense, impactful first episode" [...] despite his feeling that it has [...] "limited animation". Martin also compared Attack on Titan vibe and visual aesthetic to Claymore.

[...] Steven Bishop of Hybrid Magazine reported that style-wise the band was not be for everyone, commenting that |but for those select few who appreciate the movement and atmosphere created here, they will find a technically judicious band that leads with good hooks and follows through with great substance to create an album that is wholly worth it, back to front." ...|$|E

NME reviewer Barry Nicolson called it a [...] "masterpiece" [...] and [...] "both beautiful and harrowing, hard to listen to but even harder <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>away</b> from."
