40|$|The Pocdol Mountains {{are part}} of the Bicol arc [...] a SE-trending calcalkaline {{volcanic}} belt adjacent to the Philippine Trench. Recent volcano-stratigraphic studies and five new K-Ar ages have delineated seven lithostratigraphic units in the Pocdol Mountains. The rocks are grouped into : (i) a Western Pocdol Mountains (WPM) series, and (ii) an Eastern Pocdol Mountains (EPM) series. WPM eruptives comprise Early Pliocene basaltic <b>tuff</b> <b>breccias</b> and lavas (Malobago volcanics) and Middle to Late Pleistocene (0. 478 - 0. 065 Ma) andesitic lavas and <b>tuff</b> <b>breccias</b> (Lison and Kayabon volcanics). EPM volcanism produced (i) Middle Pliocene dacitic <b>tuff</b> <b>breccias</b> and minor lavas and the Matacla Dome (Suminandig volcanics). The stratified unit is intercalated with lenses of siltstones and sandstones (Rangas conglomerate), and was later (0. 065 Ma) intruded by the Rangas microdiorite; (ii) Middle Pliocene to Early Pleistocene andesi tic <b>tuff</b> <b>breccias,</b> laharic breccias and lavas (Pangas volcanics), which were erupted mostly from four flank vents, with associated igneous intrusives (Pangas intrusives), and (iii) Late Pleistocene to Recent andesitic lavas, <b>tuff</b> <b>breccias</b> and lahars of the Cawayan volcanics (< 0. 04 Ma) and basaltic tephras and minor lavas of the Pulog volcanics (< 0. 03 Ma). The rocks are plagioclase-phyric, with minor clino- and orthopyroxene, titanomagnetite and hornblende. Olivine is only found in the Malobago volcanics. Glomerophyric and pilotaxitic textures are common, and most phenocrysts show normal or oscillatory zonation. Disequilibrium features are rare. The inferred crystallisation sequence of WPM lavas is titanomagnetite-olivine-pyroxene-amphibole, accompanied by plagioclase. EPM rocks have the same order of crystallisation as WPM lavas, except that olivine was not involved. Overall mineralogy of the lavas suggests a low pressure (< 9 kb) crystallisation and estimated equilibration temperatures from coexisting two pyroxenes range from 1006 °C to 1135 °C. The absence of ilmenite phases precludes an estimate of oxygen fugacity. WPM lavas comprise medium-K high-Al basalt to medium-K and high-K andesite, whereas the EPM rocks consist of low-K basaltic andesite to medium-K andesite and dacite. Major oxide and trace element variations indicate two possible parental liquids, each generating the WPM and EPM series; the EPM lavas also show two fractionation trends : a dacite and an andesite crystallisation paths. WPM lavas generally contain greater abundances of large-ion lithophile (LIL) and high field strength (HFS) ions, but they have lower concentrations of ferromagnesian elements. Low Mg/(Mg+Fe²), Ni and Cr values in both series suggest that the liquids are not in equilibrium with mantle peridotite. Both WPM and EPM lavas are considered to have been derived by closed-system low pressure POAM fractionation (Gill, 1981) of a basaltic source, that may have been generated by higher degrees of partial melting within the mantle wedge and/or the subducted slab, together with some degree of enrichment from the downgoing slab. Stratigraphic criteria and least-squares mixing models indicate that by precipitating plagioclase, orthopyroxene, titanomagnetite and clinopyroxene, both Lison and Kayabon andesites (WPM series) were probably derived from a high-alumina basaltic source (Malobago volcanics), whereas the Suminandig, Pangas and Cawayan volcanics (EPM series) originate from a low-K basaltic andesite liquid (Pulog volcanics). However, if it is assumed that a dacitic melt was sitting on top of the EPM reservoir, then it is necessary to invoke liquid fractionation (McBirney et al., 1985), whereby the more fractionated liquids move upward and are collected at the roof of the chamber, due to density stratification in the magma reservoir...|$|R

40|$|Abstract [...] The vitric {{matrix of}} pre-caldera cid tuff and <b>tuff</b> <b>breccia</b> of the Santorini volcano, Aegean Sea, Greece has been {{generally}} replaced {{by one or}} more of the following authigenic minerals: K-rich and (K,Ca) -rich clinoptilolite, mordenite, opal-CT, and clay minerals. Halite is also present in some samples. Initial compositional inhomogeneities between the dacitic blocks in <b>tuff</b> <b>breccia</b> and tuff seem to have controlled the type of K-rich heulandite-group zeolite that formed. Mordenite postdates the heulandite-group zeolites and opal-CT. Some mordenite has replaced the rims of glass hards. The alteration minerals are not related to vertical or lateral zonation, and the irregular distribution of their assemblages is attributed to variations in heat flow, ionic activity in interstitial waters, and permeability. The pyroclastic rocks were in a region of active heat flow during and after their emplacement. The formation of authigenic silicates may have led to the sealing of open spaces and fractures, imposing barriers to permeability and subdividing the original open system into smaller closed systems. As alteration progressed, some of the trapped water in each individual domain was consumed in hydration reactions. Salts could have been concentrated by such a process, and halite probably precipitated from solutions of appropriate compositio...|$|E
40|$|Over 200 diatremes {{occur in}} the Hopi Buttes {{volcanic}} province on the southwestern flank of the Black Mesa basin in northeastern Arizona. The diatremes are funnel-shaped vents with maar craters at the surface. They were formed by phreatomagmatic eruptions along existing northwest-southeast fractures during mid-Pliocene time. Anomalous concentrations of uranium occur in at least 20 of the diatremes. The diatremes and dikes which feed them are composed of lamprophyres, monchiquite, and limburgite. <b>Tuff</b> <b>breccias</b> and agglomerates rimming the vents consist of sedimentary and igneous fragments in a limburgite matrix.

Average uranium values are: <b>tuff</b> <b>breccias,</b> 10. 54 ppm; tuffs, 213. 95 ppm; limestones, 58. 213 ppm. The average Th/U ratio in the lampro-phyres is 2. 02. The lack of correlation between U and Hf or Th indicates that uranium traveled in mobile phases and was segregated from many elements in the lamprophyres.

The Parlatuvier Formation mostly consists of mafic to intermediate <b>tuffs</b> and <b>tuff</b> <b>breccias</b> with a U-Pb zircon ID-TIMS age of Ma. Trace element data and radiogenic isotopes reveal that the Parlatuvier Formation is derived from a heterogeneous subduction-modified, locally incompatible trace element–enriched, mantle source with some rocks containing the highest 176 Hf/ 177 Hf ratios found in the offshore Caribbean. The Mount Dillon Formation comprises silicified <b>tuffs</b> and <b>tuff</b> <b>breccias</b> that are derived from a more isotopically enriched mantle source with a significant slab fluid-related component. A thin belt of amphibolite-facies dynamothermally metamorphosed metavolcanic rocks lies in contact with a younger island arc pluton. Some of these amphibolites have an isotopically similar source to the Parlatuvier Formation but lack a clear subduction-related component. The age, geochemical heterogeneity, and proximal nature of eruption confirm that the North Coast Schist lay within an east-dipping proto–Greater Antilles arc. We propose that the arc system at the time of North Coast Schist magmatism was actively rifting, possibly during development of a back-arc basin. This arc system shut down during the Cretaceous, making way for southwest-dipping Greater Antilles subduction and relative eastward motion of the Caribbean Plate...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe late Aptian (118 – 115  Ma) {{continental}} flood basalts of the Rajmahal Volcanic Province (RVP) {{are part}} of the Kerguelen Large Igneous Province, and constitute the uppermost part of the Gondwana Supergroup on the eastern Indian shield margin. The lower one-third of the Rajmahal volcanic succession contains thin layers of plant fossil-rich inter-trappean sedimentary rocks with pyroclasts, bentonite, grey and black shale/mudstone and oolite, whereas the upper two-thirds consist of sub-aerial fine-grained aphyric basalts with no inter-trappean material. At the eastern margin and the north-central sector of the RVP, the volcanics in the lower part include rhyolites and dacites overlain by enstatite-bearing basalts and enstatite-andesites. The pyroclastic rocks are largely felsic in composition, and comprise ignimbrite as well as coarse-grained tuff with lithic clasts, and <b>tuff</b> <b>breccia</b> with bombs, lapilli and ash that indicate explosive eruption of viscous rhyolitic magma. The rhyolites/dacites (> 68  wt. %) are separated from the andesites (< 60  wt. %) by a gap in silica content indicating their formation through upper crustal anatexis with only heat supplied by the basaltic magma. On the other hand, partially melted siltstone xenoliths in enstatite-bearing basalts suggest that the enstatite-andesites originated through mixing of the upper crust with basaltic magma, crystallizing orthopyroxene at a pressure-temperature of ∼ 3  kb/ 1150  °C. In contrast, the northwestern sector of the RVP is devoid of felsic-intermediate rocks, and the volcaniclastic rocks are predominantly mafic (basaltic) in composition. Here, the presence of fine-grained tuffs, <b>tuff</b> <b>breccia</b> containing sideromelane shards and quenched texture, welded <b>tuff</b> <b>breccia,</b> peperite, shale/mudstone and oolite substantiates a subaqueous environment. Based on these observations, we conclude that the early phase of Rajmahal volcanism occurred under predominantly subaqueous conditions. The presence of grey and black shale/mudstone in the lower one-third of the succession across the entire Rajmahal basin provides unequivocal evidence of a shallow-marine continental shelf-type environment. Alignment of the Rajmahal eruptive centers with a major N–S mid-Neoproterozoic lineament and the presence of a gravity high on the RVP suggest a tectonic control for the eruption of melts associated with the Kerguelen plume that was active in a post-Gondwana rift between India and Australia-Antarctica...|$|E
