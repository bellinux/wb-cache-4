5|$|Tanks must {{be cleaned}} {{from time to}} time for various reasons. One reason is to change the type of product carried inside a tank. Also, when <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> to be {{inspected}} or maintenance must be performed within a tank, it must be not only cleaned, but made gas-free.|$|E
5|$|The game is {{displayed}} on a black-and-white television screen, and the <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> controlled by two joysticks each. Pushing both joysticks moves the player's tank forward, and pulling them both back causes the tank to stop. Pulling them in different directions or amounts causes the tank to turn in place or while moving, respectively. A button {{on the top of}} the right joystick fires a shell.|$|E
5|$|Both {{versions}} use {{a common}} airframe, with three Rolls-Royce Turbomeca RTM322 engines, their range and endurance using only a two engine cruise option, is , or six hours. However, range {{can be extended}} further when the five underfloor fuel <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> supplemented with auxiliary fuel tanks fitted in the cabin. Armament depends on mission, but includes anti-ship missiles, torpedoes, three door-mounted machine guns, multi-purpose rocket, cannon pods, air-to-air missiles and air-to-surface missiles. At least 14 Merlin HM2s will be assigned to the carrier.|$|E
50|$|The milk cooling <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> {{usually not}} {{completely}} filled at once. A 2 milking <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> designed to cool 50% of its capacity at once. A 4 milking <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> designed to cool 25% of its capacity at once, and a 6 milking <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> designed to cool 16.7% of its capacity at once.|$|R
50|$|Sundaresvara <b>Tank</b> <b>is</b> {{located in}} the south of Sundaresvara Siva temple across the Sundaresvara road, Old Town, Bhubaneswar, the capital of Orissa. It is now under the care and {{maintenance}} of Sri Sri Dadhivamana Sundaresvara Mahadeva Trust Board. The <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> enclosed within a masonry embankment made of dressed laterite blocks.The exact date when the <b>tank</b> <b>was</b> built could not be ascertained. However the <b>tank</b> may <b>be</b> earlier or contemporaneous to the Sundaresvara Siva Temple which is ascribed to the 13th Century A.D.The <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> in use for ritual as well as normal bathing.The <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> under the Endowment Department and Sri Sri Dadhivamana Sundaresvara Mahadeva Trust Board.|$|R
50|$|Development of a tank {{classification}} system started in World War I, when <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> separated into light tanks and tankettes, medium tanks, and heavy tanks, based on size and weight. Heavy <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> {{required to be}} large to cross trenches, and consequently weighed a lot. Medium <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> smaller and had help to cross trenches so weighed less. Light <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> much smaller and lightweight, allowing transport on lorries (trucks).|$|R
5|$|Each {{engine is}} {{supplied}} by a separate 1,074 litre (276 US Gallon, 230 Imperial Gallon) fuel tank using dual booster pumps. Optional {{fourth and fifth}} tanks {{can be added to}} act as a reservoir supply, topping up the main tanks during flight, increasing range or endurance. The AW101 can also be outfitted with a probe for aerial refuelling. Self-sealing fuel <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> an optional item to be selected by the customer. An inlet particle separator system can be installed, protecting the engine when operating in sandy environments.|$|E
5|$|Each {{submarine}} {{is equipped}} with three Garden Island-Hedemora HV V18b/15Ub (VB210) 18-cylinder diesel engines, which are each connected to a 1,400kW, 440-volt DC Jeumont-Schneider generator. The combined electrical generation capability of each submarine is 4.2 megawatts. The Hedemora diesels were chosen because of modular construction, which made servicing easier; they could be installed three across in the available space, while other contenders required at least two banks of two; and they had turbochargers driven by the exhaust gas. Fifteen fuel <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> located throughout the submarine: they must be used in specific sequences to preserve the submarine's buoyancy and trim.|$|E
5|$|Air pollution, lack {{of proper}} waste {{management}} infrastructure and degradation of water bodies {{are the major}} environmental issues in Coimbatore. There is a sewage treatment plant at Ukkadam with the capacity to process 70 million litres of sewage water per day. Garbage is collected by the corporation and sewage is pumped into the water tanks and the Noyyal river through streams. This along with garbage dumping and encroachments has led to degradation of the water bodies and depletion in the groundwater table. The <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> renovated by the city's environmental groups with their own fund-raising and the corporation. The corporation is responsible and involved in clearing encroachment of the tanks. Siruthuli, an environmental organisation founded by the city's industrial houses, undertakes de-silting of tanks and cleaning of the Noyyal river. Environment Conservation Group based {{out of the city}} is also involved in conservation of trees and wetlands, monitoring wildlife crime and conducting awareness sessions for students.|$|E
5000|$|One <b>tank</b> <b>was</b> made, and the <b>tank</b> <b>was</b> tested, {{but found}} wanting {{in regards to}} the power train. The tank {{resulted}} in a further developed tank, the M1922, produced a year later[...] The <b>tank</b> <b>was</b> tested until 1926, after which its wheareabouts were not known.|$|R
5|$|Additional fuel <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> fitted and {{the design}} of the <b>tanks</b> <b>was</b> changed to {{accommodate}} the change from gasoline to kerosene.|$|R
25|$|The {{purpose of}} the <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> simply for bubble–pulp separation, so {{the volume of the}} <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> small {{compared}} with alternative technologies.|$|R
5|$|The three keepers' cottages were {{constructed}} in 1928–1930. The head keeper's house is located {{close to the}} lighthouse, and on the tallest ground, and also includes a small fenced garden. The assistant keeper residence is located right to the west, but geographically lower. The second assistant residence is located at {{some distance from the}} main cluster of buildings, to the south, and even lower. The residences are square one storey structures, timber framed and fibro clad, with central rooms, no corridors, enclosed verandahs and hipped roofs. The head keeper's house and the second assistant's house have corrugated fibrous cement rood while the first assistant house has a newer corrugated zinc/aluminium alloy (Zincalume) metal roof. A museum was set in the second assistant's quarters in 1988. Two spherical steel rainwater <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> set next to each of the houses.|$|E
5|$|There are sixty-four Tīrthas or Theerthams (holy water bodies) in {{and around}} Rameswaram. According to the Skanda Purana, twenty-four of them are important. Of the 24, 14 are {{in the form of}} tanks and wells within the precincts of the temple. Bathing in these tanks is a major aspect of the pilgrimage to Rameswaram and is {{considered}} equivalent to penance. Twenty-two of the <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> within the Ramanathaswamy Temple. The foremost one is called Agni Theertham, the sea (Bay of Bengal). Jatayu, King of the Birds, who fought in vain with the demon-king Ravana to save Sita, is said to have fallen down at Jadayu Theertham as his wings were severed. Villoondi Theertham literally translates to 'buried bow', is located around 7 kilometres from the main temple on the way to Pamban. It {{is believed to be the}} place where Rama quenched the thirst of Sita by dipping the bow into the sea water. Other major holy bodies are Hanuman Theertham, Sugreeva Theertham and Lakshmana Theertham.|$|E
5|$|To {{reduce the}} {{likelihood}} of damage to the A-10's fuel system, all four fuel <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> located near the aircraft's center and are separated from the fuselage; projectiles would need to penetrate the aircraft's skin before reaching a tank's outer skin. Compromised fuel transfer lines self-seal; if damage exceeds a tank's self-sealing capabilities, check valves prevent fuel flowing into a compromised tank. Most fuel system components are inside the tanks so that fuel will not be lost due to component failure. The refueling system is also purged after use. Reticulated polyurethane foam lines both the inner and outer sides of the fuel tanks, retaining debris and restricting fuel spillage in the event of damage. The engines are shielded {{from the rest of the}} airframe by firewalls and fire extinguishing equipment. In the event of all four main tanks being lost, two self-sealing sump tanks contain fuel for 230miles (370km) of flight.|$|E
50|$|The test prototypes of the <b>tank</b> <b>were</b> {{evaluated}} in 1993. Six semi-industrial prototypes of the <b>tank</b> <b>were</b> produced and tested in 1997.|$|R
50|$|A three-acre fishing facility, Perkins <b>Tank</b> <b>is</b> a {{blue ribbon}} trout fishing area. The <b>tank</b> <b>was</b> {{recently}} drained because of illegal green sunfish stocking.|$|R
50|$|The {{outer shell}} of the water <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> a {{cylindrical}} stainless-steel tank 39 m in diameter and 42 m in height. The <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> self-supporting, with concrete backfilled against the rough-hewn stone walls to counteract water pressure when the <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> filled. The capacity of the tank exceeds 50 ktons of water.|$|R
5|$|Hoepner's Panzer Corps and Prioux' Cavalry clashed head-on near Hannut, Belgium, on 12 May. Contrary {{to popular}} belief, the Germans did not outnumber the French. Frequently, figures of 623 German and 415 French <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> given. The German 3rd and 4th Panzer Divisions {{numbered}} 280 and 343 respectively. The 2e DLM and 3e DLM numbered 176 Somuas and 239 Hotchkiss H35s. Added to this force were the {{considerable number of}} Renault AMR-ZT-63s in the Cavalry Corps. The R35 was equal or superior to the Panzer I and Panzer IIs in armament terms. This applies all the more to the 90 Panhard 178 armoured cars of the French Army. Its 25mm main gun could penetrate the armour of the Panzer IV. In terms of tanks that were capable of engaging and surviving a tank-vs-tank action, the Germans possessed just 73 Panzer IIIs and 52 Panzer IVs. The French had 176 SOMUA and 239 Hotchkisses. German tank units also contained 486 Panzer I and IIs, which were of dubious combat value given their losses in the Polish Campaign.|$|E
5|$|Mating in the {{epaulette}} shark takes place from July to December, though in captivity reproduction occurs continuously. Courtship may be {{initiated by the}} female following and biting the male. The male then holds onto the pectoral fin of the female with his mouth and lies alongside her, while inserting one of his claspers into her cloaca. Copulation lasts about {{one and a half}} minutes. Epaulette sharks readily breed in aquariums, even in tanks as small as 135 gallons, but larger <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> recommended to allow room for the hatched offspring. This species is oviparous, with females depositing eggs from August to December. The female drops the egg capsules two (rarely four) at a time every 14 days, producing a total of 20ndash&50 eggs per year. Each egg case measures 10 cm (3.9 in) long and 4 cm (1.6 in) wide. The young emerge after 120ndash&130 days, at a length of 14ndash&16 cm (5.5ndash&6.3 in). The growth rate of the young is slow at first but increases to about 5 cm (2 in) per year after three months. Both males and females mature sexually at a length of 54ndash&64 cm (21ndash&25 in), corresponding to an age of at least seven years.|$|E
25|$|Drop tanks, {{external}} tanks, wing tanks, pylon tanks or belly <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> all terms used {{to describe}} auxiliary externally mounted fuel tanks. Drop <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> generally expendable and often jettisonable. External <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> commonplace on modern military aircraft and occasionally found in civilian ones, although the latter {{are less likely to}} be discarded except in the event of emergency.|$|E
50|$|The <b>tank</b> <b>was</b> {{partially}} {{destroyed by}} a fire in 1927. It was rebuilt and operational in 1930, and was used up to the 1940s. Then the <b>tank</b> <b>was</b> used as a pressure tank to support other wind-tunnel activities at Langley. In 1978, the <b>tank</b> <b>was</b> taken out of service; it survives on display.|$|R
50|$|Petrol is {{supplied}} by gravity from the tank {{at the rear}} of the car but once the car is under way exhaust gases maintain a pressure within this tank. A lubricating oil <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> pressurised the same way. The petrol <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> in two compartments separated by a partial partition. Both sections are filled when the <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> filled above that partition but when the larger <b>tank</b> <b>is</b> empty the second tank provides a fresh supply and a timely warning to the driver.|$|R
50|$|The {{first series}} <b>tank</b> <b>was</b> {{delivered}} on 25 October 1979. By 1982 {{the first batch}} of 380 Leopard 2 <b>tanks</b> <b>was</b> completed. 209 were built by Krauss-Maffei (chassis no. 10001 to 10210) and 171 by MaK (chassis no. 20001 to 20172). The first production <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> fitted with the PzB-200 image intensifier due to production shortages of the new thermal night-sight system, which was later retrofitted to the earlier models. After the original five batches, three further batches of Leopard 2 <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> ordered, {{increasing the amount of}} Leopard 2 tanks ordered by Germany to a total of 2,125. The sixth batch was ordered in June 1987 and consisted of 150 <b>tanks,</b> which <b>were</b> produced between January 1988 and May 1989. The seventh batch of 100 <b>tanks</b> <b>was</b> produced between May 1988 and April 1990. The last batch for the German army totalling 75 <b>tanks</b> <b>was</b> produced from January 1991 to March 1992.|$|R
25|$|Modern LNG storage <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> {{typically}} {{full containment}} type, {{which has a}} prestressed concrete outer wall and a high-nickel steel inner tank, with extremely efficient insulation between the walls. Large <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> low aspect ratio (height to width) and cylindrical in design with a domed steel or concrete roof. Storage pressure in these tanks is very low, less than 10kPa (1.45psig). Sometimes more expensive underground <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> used for storage.|$|E

25|$|While {{copper and}} {{stainless}} steel domestic hot water <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> more commonplace in Europe, carbon steel <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> {{more common in the}} United States, where typically the periodic check is neglected, the tank develops a leak whereupon the entire appliance is replaced. Even when neglected, carbon steel tanks tend to last for a few years more than their manufacturer's warranty, which is typically 3 to 12 years in the US.|$|E
50|$|At {{least three}} <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> {{deployed}} from Chernihiv on 22 January 2014. Officially the <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> being {{transferred to the}} Odessa Oblast and not be going to Kiev. On January 23, 2014 {{it was announced that}} due to the complicated situation in the country all <b>tanks</b> <b>were</b> returned to their place of permanent base.|$|R

25|$|Rigid {{removable}} <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> {{installed in}} a compartment designed to accommodate the tank. They are typically of metal, plastic or fibreglass construction, and may be removed for inspection, replacement, or repair. The aircraft does not rely on the tank for structural integrity. These <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> commonly found in smaller general aviation aircraft, such as the Cessna 172. Combat aircraft and helicopters generally use self-sealing fuel tanks.|$|E
25|$|Every 4,000 kilometres, an {{inspection}} taking about 1½ hours is undertaken. The waste collection <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> emptied and fresh water <b>tanks</b> <b>are</b> refilled. Acute defects (e.g. malfunctioning doors) are rectified. Furthermore, safety tests are conducted. These include checking the pantograph pressure, cleaning and checking for fissures in the rooftop insulators, inspecting transformers and checking the pantograph's current collector for wear. The wheels are also checked in this inspection.|$|E
