5|$|The book {{describes}} how the relationship between insects and plants resulted in the beautiful and complex forms which natural theology attributed to a grand designer. By showing how practical adaptations develop from cumulative minor variations of parts of the flowers to suit new purposes, Darwin countered the prevailing view <b>that</b> <b>beautiful</b> organisms were the handiwork of a Creator. Darwin's painstaking observations, experiments, and detailed dissection of the flowers explained previously unknown features such as the puzzle of Catasetum, which had been thought to have three completely different species of flowers on the same plant. In addition, they produced testable predictions including his then-controversial proposal that the long nectary of Angraecum sesquipedale meant {{that there must be}} a moth with an equally long proboscis. This was confirmed in 1903 when Xanthopan morganii praedicta was found in Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|September 3rd – I {{went and}} saw the whole south part of the City burning from Cheapeside to the Thames, and... was now taking hold of St. Paule's Church, to which the {{scaffolds}} contributed exceedingly.September 7th – I went this morning on foote from White-hall as far as London Bridge, thro' the late Fleete-streete, Ludgate Hill, by St. Paules... At my returne I was infinitely concern'd to find that goodly Church St. Paules now a sad ruine, and <b>that</b> <b>beautiful</b> portico... now rent in pieces, flakes of vast stone split asunder, and nothing now remaining intire but the inscription in the architrave, shewing by whom it was built, which had not one letter of it defac'd. It was astonishing to see what immense stones the heate had in a manner calcin'd, {{so that all the}} ornaments, columns, freezes, capitals, and projectures of massie Portland-stone flew off, even to the very roofe, where a sheet of lead covering a great space (no less than six akers by measure) was totally mealted; the ruines of the vaulted roofe falling broke into St. Faith's, which being fill'd with the magazines of bookes belonging to the Stationers, and carried thither for safety, they were all consum'd, burning for a weeke following. It is also observable that the lead over the altar at the East end was untouch'd, and among the divers monuments, the body of one Bishop remain'd intire. Thus lay in ashes that most venerable Church, one of the most antient pieces of early piety in the Christian world.|$|E

500|$|The word, [...] "untrimmed" [...] in line eight, can {{be taken}} two ways: First, {{in the sense of}} loss of {{decoration}} and frills, and second, in the sense of untrimmed sails on a ship. [...] In the first interpretation, the poem reads <b>that</b> <b>beautiful</b> things naturally lose their fanciness over time. [...] In the second, it reads that nature is a ship with sails not adjusted to wind changes in order to correct course. [...] This, in combination with the words [...] "nature's changing course", creates an oxymoron: the unchanging change of nature, or the fact that the only thing that does not change is change. [...] This line in the poem creates a shift from the mutability of the first eight lines, into the eternity of the last six.
