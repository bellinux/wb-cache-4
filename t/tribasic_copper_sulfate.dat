50|$|Current {{practices}} of managing olive peacock spot disease aim to have consistent suppression {{by keeping the}} levels of inoculum low and through preventative measures. This is {{because there is no}} way to treat this disease once it appears in the spring or while the trees have fruit. The most common management approach is to spray the foliage with a copper compound after the fruit has been harvested in the fall and again in the late winter if the environment is extremely wet. A power sprayer with high pressure is the most effective as it helps coat the entire surface of each leaf, even in the interior of the tree. If copper is sprayed onto the fruit it is nearly impossible to wash away, and so late harvests are often lost to infection. The spray comes in various forms of copper hydroxide, copper oxychloride, <b>tribasic</b> <b>copper</b> <b>sulfate,</b> and copper oxide. A few of these have been legally classified as organic.|$|E

40|$|A mancha-angular, causada por Xanthomonas citri subsp. malvacearum (Xcm), é a {{principal}} doença bacteriana do algodoeiro no Centro-Oeste e Nordeste do Brasil. A variabilidade de uma população de 100 isolados de Xcm, oriundos de plantas com sintomas típicos de mancha-angular em áreas produtoras de algodoeiro dos estados de Goiás, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul e Bahia, Brasil, foi analisada com base em características fenotípicas e genéticas. As enzimas amilase, lipase e celulase e o polissacarídeo levana foram produzidos por todos os isolados de Xcm, enquanto a caseinase foi produzida apenas por 20 isolados. Todos os isolados induziram reação de hipersensibilidade em folhas de tomateiro. Os 100 isolados foram sensíveis a oxicloreto de cobre (1500 mg l- 1), hidróxido de cobre (1614 mg l- 1), oxitetraciclina (600 mg l- 1), oxitetraciclina (90 mg l- 1) + sulfato tribásico de cobre (1500 mg l- 1) e oxitetraciclina (76, 6 mg l- 1) + sulfato de estreptomicina (367, 2 mg l- 1), e resistentes a casugamicina (60 mg l- 1). Dentre os 18 antibióticos testados, os isolados bacterianos apresentaram reação variável a nove: ácido nalidíxico, amoxicilina, azitromicina, bacitracina, eritromicina, kanamicina, pefloxacina, tobramicina e vancomicina. Rep-PCR (REP, ERIC e BOX) revelou a formação de cinco grupos ao nível de 70 % de similaridade, sendo o grupo I constituído de 98 isolados, incluindo o isolado referência de Xcm IBSBF 1733, o grupo II, formado apenas por dois isolados oriundos da Bahia e os três outros grupos por isolados de X. citri pv. anacardii, X. citri pv. mangiferaeindicae e X. axonopodis pv. spondiae utilizados para comparação. Neste trabalho também foi avaliado o efeito do silício (Si) no controle da mancha-angular do algodoeiro, e os possíveis mecanismos envolvidos na resistência potencializada por este elemento. O silicato de cálcio (CaSiO 3) foi incorporado ao solo nas doses de 0, 00; 0, 25; 0, 50; 1, 50 e 3, 00 g de SiO 2 kg- 1 de solo 25 dias antes do plantio. Plantas com 33 dias tiveram as folhas inoculadas por infiltração com 0, 5 mL de suspensão de Xcm (108 UFC ml- 1). Os componentes da resistência foram avaliados a cada dois dias até 10 dias após a inoculação, quando o desenvolvimento da planta e o acúmulo de Si e Ca foram também determinados. Foram ainda analisadas a atividade de enzimas relacionadas à defesa vegetal e a produção de H 2 O 2 às 6, 12 e 24 h após a inoculação em plantas +/-Si e a inibição in vitro do crescimento do patógeno. Não foi verificada diferença significativa entre os tratamentos quanto ao período de incubação, incidência da mancha-angular e inibição do crescimento da bactéria. Com a aplicação da dose 1, 50 g SiO 2 kg- 1 de solo, observou-se redução da severidade (54, 9 %), da área abaixo da curva de progresso da doença (35, 76 %) e aumento na altura das plantas (7, 04 %). Não foi verificado acúmulo de Si nas folhas de algodoeiro. Níveis de proteínas solúveis e H 2 O 2 e atividade das enzimas SOD, APX, POX, PAL e GLU foram alterados na presença do Si (1, 80 g SiO 2 kg- 1). Com base nas características fenotípicas e genéticas analisadas, conclui-se que a população de 100 isolados de Xcm estudada apresenta baixa variabilidade e que a redução da severidade da mancha-angular do algodoeiro mediada por Si está provavelmente associada aos eventos característicos de indução de resistência observados. The bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas citri subsp. malvacearum (Xcm) {{is the most}} important bacterial disease of cotton in the Middle-West and Northeast Regions of Brazil. The variability of a population formed by 100 Xcm strains obtained from commercial fields in the states of Goiás, Mato Grosso, Mato Grosso do Sul and Bahia, Brazil, was analyzed based upon genetic and phenotypic characteristics. The enzymes amylase, lipase, cellulase and the polysaccharide levan were produced by all Xcm isolates while the caseinase was only produced by 20 strains. All strains induced hipersensitivity reaction in tomato leaves. The 100 strains were sensitive to copper oxychloride (1500 mg L- 1), copper hidroxide (1614 mg L- 1), oxytetracicline (600 mg L- 1), oxytetracicline (90 mg L- 1) + <b>tribasic</b> <b>copper</b> <b>sulfate</b> (1500 mg L- 1) and oxytetracicline (76. 6 mg L- 1) + streptomycin sulfate (367. 2 mg L- 1), but resistant to kasugamycin (60 mg L- 1). Among the eighteen tested antibiotics the strains presented variable reaction in relation to: nalidixic acid, amoxicillin, azithromycin, bacitracin, eritromicin, kanamycin, pefloxacin, tobramycin e vancomycin. Rep-PCR (REP, ERIC and BOX) showed the formation of five groups at 70 % similarity level. Group I contained 98 strains, including the reference strain Xcm IBSBF 1733, group II contained only two strains from Bahia and the other three groups included strains of Xanthomonas citri pv. anacardii, X. citri pv. mangiferaeindicae e X. axonopodis pv. spondiae used for comparison. This work also evaluated the effect of silicon (Si) on the bacterial blight of cotton control and the putative mechanisms involved in the resistance potentialized by this element were evaluated. Calcium silicate (CaSiO 3) was incorporated into the soil at concentrations of 0. 00, 0. 25, 0. 50, 1. 50 and 3. 00 g of SiO 2 kg- 1 soil 25 days before planting. Leaves of 33 -day-old-plants were inoculated by infiltration with 0. 5 mL suspension of Xcm (108 CFU ml- 1). Components of resistance were evaluated every two days until 10 days after inoculation, at which point plant development and the accumulation of Si and Calcium (Ca) were also determined. H 2 O 2 production and the activity of enzymes related to plant defenses were analyzed at 6, 12 and 24 hours after inoculation in plants +/-Si. In vitro inhibition of pathogen growth due to Si was also assessed. No significant difference was seen among the treatments regarding incubation period, disease incidence or inhibition of bacterial growth. However, with the application of 1. 50 g of SiO 2 kg- 1 of soil, a reduction in severity (54. 9 %) was observed along with a reduction in the area under the disease progression curve (35. 76 %) and an increase in plant height (7. 04 %). There was no observable accumulation of Si in the cotton leaves. Levels of soluble proteins and H 2 O 2 and activity of the enzymes SOD, APX, guaiacol peroxidase, PAL and b Glu were altered in the presence of Si (1. 80 g SiO 2 kg- 1). Thus based on the genetic and phenotypic characteristics studied we conclude that the population of 100 Xcm strains presents low variability, and that the reduction of cotton bacterial blight severity mediated by Si is probably associated to the characteristic events of induced resistance observed...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to evaluate the effects of <b>copper</b> as <b>tribasic</b> <b>copper</b> chloride on serum biochemical values and growth performance of broilers intoxicated with aflatoxins. Aflatoxins significantly decreased the level of albumin (P < 0. 001), total protein (P < 0. 001) and total cholesterol (P < 0. 01), and increased the activities of alanine amino transferase, L-lactic dehydrogenase and alkaline phosphatase (P £ 0. 001) in serum. These AF-induced changes were significantly improved by adding <b>tribasic</b> <b>copper</b> chloride to the diet. The decrease in serum copper concentration induced by aflatoxin was reversed by <b>tribasic</b> <b>copper</b> chloride.

The current battery design {{consists}} of Copper and Zinc electrodes with an electrolyte composition of <b>Copper</b> <b>Sulfate</b> (CuSO 4), Zinc Nitrate (Zn(NO 3) 2), and Potassium Chloride (KCl). The performance of the battery with <b>Copper</b> <b>Sulfate</b> and Potassium Chloride was comparable to the performance of the battery with Zinc Nitrate, <b>Copper</b> <b>Sulfate,</b> and Potassium Chloride. Next we attempted to replace Potassium Chloride with a greener solute Sodium Chloride (NaCl), common table salt. We optimized the concentration of NaCl in our batteries. Batteries with optimized concentration of NaCl resulted in significantly higher power density. Our final product – a greener battery, now consists of Zinc and Copper rods with <b>Copper</b> <b>Sulfate</b> and Sodium Chloride as the electrolyte. Background The search for greener alternatives for energy is an on-going process and this project is presented as a possible means for greener battery design. This experiment had been traditionally done with <b>copper</b> <b>sulfate</b> and zinc nitrate. Batteries have a cathode an...|$|R

40|$|Phytoremediation is an {{emerging}} technology for cleaning industrial and urban contamination (Peuke and Rennenberg, 2005). Many factors including germination rate, biomass changes, biochemical changes, and nutrient changes must be determined {{in order to}} utilize a plant for phytoremediation. Our results showed that Prosopis pubescens (Screw bean mesquite) is a hyperaccumulator of <b>copper</b> from <b>copper</b> <b>sulfate</b> and a feasible option to remediate fields with up to 200 ppm of <b>copper</b> <b>sulfate.</b> ^ Screw bean mesquite seeds are viable even after 30 years of storage. Both <b>copper</b> <b>sulfate</b> and <b>copper</b> nitrate decreased the germination rate of screw bean mesquite seeds. In soil grown screw bean mesquite plants, germination rates were not affected by either <b>copper</b> <b>sulfate</b> or <b>copper</b> nitrate. Physiological studies showed biomass decreased with copper exposure. Root cell area increased with increasing copper exposure. Only after copper nitrate exposure, chlorophyll levels decreased; unmasking the yellow/orange pigments from carotene and xanthophyll and causing chlorosis. ^ We measured copper and nutrient concentrations within seedlings. Petri dish grown seedlings accumulated 47, 000 ppm (27, 500 ppm) in roots, 23, 000 ppm (21, 000 ppm) in stems, and 9, 000 ppm (16, 000 ppm of copper) in cotyledons from <b>copper</b> <b>sulfate</b> (<b>copper</b> nitrate). Control seedlings grown in soil accumulated 31, 000 ppm in roots, 17, 000 ppm in stems, 11, 000 ppm in cotyledons, and 20 ppm of <b>copper</b> from <b>copper</b> <b>sulfate</b> in true leaves. Copper did not change calcium, iron, manganese and zinc concentrations. Magnesium, potassium, phosphorus decreased while sulfur increased in Petri dish grown seedlings exposed to <b>copper</b> <b>sulfate</b> and <b>copper</b> nitrate. ^ We identified various ultrastructural changes of cotyledons and true leaves due to copper toxicity including separation of the cell membranes from cell walls, denser cytoplasm with dark aggregates in epidermis, parenchyma, and developing phloem as well as increased vacuolization, swelling of chloroplasts and disarray of thylakoid membranes. Plasmolysis was evident beginning with 100 ppm of both <b>copper</b> <b>sulfate</b> and <b>copper</b> nitrate. Elemental analysis confirmed the presence of copper in experimental samples. ...|$|R
30|$|Bishop and Rodgers (2012) found copper {{formulations}} elicited {{significantly different}} responses independent of total sorbed <b>copper</b> amounts. <b>Copper</b> <b>sulfate</b> has a sorption and depuration profile {{that is expected}} to rapidly move to the algae but not effectively internalize for algaecidal effects (Bishop 2016). The sorption kinetics observed by Bishop et al. (2017) in short exposures indicate Captain XTR to have increased ability to penetrate into nuisance algae and achieve internal control thresholds, and are not solely driven by active transport from externally sorbed copper. Interactivity of <b>copper</b> from <b>copper</b> <b>sulfate</b> with water chemistry (e.g., alkalinity; Meyer 1999) and algal cells (Crist et al. 1990) is predicted to rapidly remove copper mass. This would limit the travel distance down a canal, and <b>copper</b> <b>sulfate</b> may not continue to enter the cell to attain internal control thresholds (Bishop et al. 2018). Murray-Gulde et al. (2002) found copper half-lives to be lower with <b>copper</b> <b>sulfate</b> than chelated <b>copper</b> in some natural waters. Masuda and Boyd (1993) also found lower half-lives of <b>copper</b> <b>sulfate</b> than chelated <b>copper</b> under elevated pH conditions and presence of different sediment types. Therefore, algaecidal efficacy and distance of control is predicted to decrease with <b>copper</b> <b>sulfate</b> compared with chelated copper, even at shorter distances. Understanding the activity of different copper formulations can be valuable and highly applicable in achieving desired management objectives while complying with regulatory standards.|$|R
