25|$|With {{his career}} {{stalling}} McCulloch {{was forced to}} drop down to Division Four in his next move when he joined Brentford in March 1976 for a club record £25000 fee. His move to The Bees rejuvenated his career {{although it was not}} until his second full season (1977–78) that <b>things</b> <b>really</b> started to happen when Brentford achieved promotion with McCulloch scoring 22 goals in 45 League appearances and forming a fine striking partnership with Steve Phillips who contributed an excellent 32 goals. In the Summer of 1978 McCulloch was loaned out to Oakland Stompers of the North American Soccer League where he made 18 appearances, scoring three goals with one assist. Back at Brentford for the 1978–79 campaign, the team consolidated their position in Division Three with McCulloch contributing 13 goals.|$|E
500|$|As was {{the case}} with The Last Man's Head, Anderson and many critics felt that {{publishers}} packaged The Commandant inappropriately, making it look like a [...] "Regency romance."

500|$|The {{success of}} At Folsom Prison revitalized Cash's career; {{according}} to Cash, [...] "that's where <b>things</b> <b>really</b> got started for me again". Sun Records re-dubbed Cash's previous B-side [...] "Get Rhythm" [...] with applause similar to Folsom's, {{and it became}} successful enough to enter the Hot 100. Cash returned to the prison scene in 1969 when he recorded At San Quentin at San Quentin State Prison. At San Quentin became Cash's first album to hit {{number one on the}} Pop chart and produced the number two hit [...] "A Boy Named Sue". The ensuing popularity from the Folsom concert also prompted ABC to give Cash his own television show.|$|E
500|$|Super Columbine Massacre {{was created}} by Danny Ledonne of Alamosa, Colorado, then a student and {{independent}} filmmaker. As a high school student, the Columbine shootings resonated with Ledonne, {{who said that he}} himself had once been [...] "a loner", [...] "a misfit" [...] and [...] "a bullied kid" [...] in high school like the shooters. [...] "I was an easy target to be picked on, and that started in kindergarten," [...] he said. [...] "It was the kind of bullying that most kids who were bullied experienced [...] When you get pushed every day, and when you are ostracized not once, not twice, but years in and out, your perception of reality is distorted [...] These <b>things</b> <b>really</b> do warp your understanding and your perception of humanity in some almost irrevocable way," [...] he said.|$|E
500|$|Marta Hoelsher of Technorati Media said: [...] "The biggest news {{of season}} two, though, is the {{appearance}} of Donna Mills as Abby Cunningham, the blonde bombshell who wreaks havoc all through the neighborhood. With {{the appearance of}} Abby, <b>things</b> <b>really</b> started to heat up and get interesting. No marriage is off limits when Abby sets her eyes on it. Played to perfection by Donna Mills, Abby is wicked, vicious, bitchy, and heartless enough to keep us loving and hating her for years. Abby's clashes with Karen MacKenzie and Val were legendary, and season two gets things rolling. After a fairly peaceful start to the season, we start to see {{the beginnings of the}} rivalry that defines the show for years: [...] Karen vs. Abby. [...] It's fun watching their early friendship evolve into a bitter rivalry." ...|$|E

500|$|Dig Me Out {{was written}} in nearly two months and {{recorded}} from December 1996 to January 1997 at John and Stu's Place in Seattle, Washington. During the recording sessions, recording the vocal interplay between Tucker and co-vocalist and guitarist Carrie Brownstein involved some difficulties. However, the producer took care and prevented favoring one voice over the other. As Goodmanson recalls: [...] "We always used different mikes for the lead vocal and for the second vocal, or different kinds of processing to make those <b>things</b> <b>really</b> distinct. To make it so you can hear both things at once". Goodmanson {{also noted that the}} fact that the band features no bass player was an advantage for the album's production. He explained: [...] "The awesome thing about having no bass player is you can make the guitars sound as big as you want. Usually you have to clear all that room out for the bass, so you can hear the bass line. With no bass there, you can just go for giant guitar sounds that you wouldn't normally be able to go for".|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Townsend {{announced}} that he was using other guitars besides his Peavey models, including two Sadowsky Telecaster models and a number of Framus semi-hollow body guitars. In regard to this, Townsend stated on HeavyBlogIsHeavy.com: [...] "The Peavey situation was intense and a real eye opener in terms of how <b>things</b> <b>REALLY</b> work in the business side of endorsements, and I can’t say I really enjoyed it, but we got the guitar out and everyone is nice to each other so all good... I really like that V. However, I decided to use other guitars for other stuff as well, a Sadowsky Tele set, a Framus hollowbody group of guitars, and the V’s. No one is entirely happy with that decision, but I find it difficult to not be straight up with folks about what I want to play and do and have typically pissed people off as a result... The bottom line though is I like what I like and it is important to the music to be accurate with tones and vibe. The guitars I actually play, I really like, regardless of brand." ...|$|E
500|$|Metroid Prime: Trilogy {{has also}} been subject to criticism. GamePros Ashley Schoeller said that graphically, [...] "the games do look a bit dated" [...] and complained that the HUD was [...] "out of aspect" [...] to fit the widescreen. Official Nintendo Magazines Fred Dutton said that some aspects of Prime and Echoes had aged, saying the {{backtracking}} [...] "feels like more of a chore than it did seven years ago," [...] {{and that it is}} [...] "not until [...] enters its final third that <b>things</b> <b>really</b> start to pick up". GamesRadar considered the achievements too expensive, and that the similarity between the three games gives [...] "an inescapable sense of déjà vu". Edge noted that the control scheme was not very innovative, and that Echoes and Corruption [...] "favoured graphical flourishes over design innovation". While Ben Reeves of Game Informer praised the game, the [...] "second opinion" [...] reviewer, Adam Biessener, considered the collection [...] "subpar", saying it lacked innovation, and that the Wii control scheme, particularly aiming and panning, [...] "is inferior in every way to the traditional scheme from the GameCube titles".|$|E

500|$|Morley took a {{break from}} Neighbours in mid-2012, which led the writers to improvise an {{on-screen}} break up for Aidan and Chris. The break up occurs after Aidan learns Chris has not told his parents {{that they are in}} a relationship. Mason said that Chris is fine with his friends knowing about his relationship, but it is different story {{when it comes to his}} parents. His father has not always made things easy for him in the past, so he does not give him and his mother a chance to get to know Aidan. When Chris' parents throw him a birthday party at Lassiter's Lake, he decides not to invite Aidan. However, Aidan learns about the party from Andrew and he feels [...] "hurt and humiliated" [...] by Chris' actions. Aidan makes it clear to Chris that their relationship is over and Mason added [...] "That's when the gravity of the situation hits Chris, and he's left in shock. He thinks, 'How did it come to this?'. <b>Things</b> <b>really</b> seemed to be falling into place with Aidan." [...] Chris then learns that his parents would have accepted the relationship and he realises that he has lost Aidan due to an assumption.|$|E
500|$|Quatermass and the Pit premiered on 9 November 1967 {{and went}} on general release in a double bill with Circus of Fear on 19 November 1967. It was {{released}} under the title Five Million Years to Earth in the US in March 1968. The critical reception was generally positive. Writing in The Times, John Russell Taylor found that, “After a slowish beginning, which shows up the deficiencies of acting and direction, <b>things</b> <b>really</b> start hopping when a mysterious missile-like object discovered in a London excavation proves to be a relic of a prehistoric Martian attempt (successful, it would seem) to colonize Earth [...] The development of this situation is scrupulously worked out and the film is genuinely gripping even when (a real test this) the Power of Evil is finally shown personified in hazy glowing outline, a spectacle as a rule more likely to provoke titters than gasps of horror.” Paul Errol of the Evening Standard described the film as a “well-made, but wordy, blob of hokum”, a view echoed by William Hall of the Evening News who described the film as [...] "entertaining hokum" [...] with an [...] "imaginative ending". A slightly more critical view was espoused by Penelope Mortimer in The Observer who said, “This nonsense makes quite a good film, well put together, competently photographed, on the whole sturdily performed. What it totally lacks is imagination.” ...|$|E
500|$|Evan Valentine, {{writing for}} Collider.com, gave the episode a [...] "good" [...] rating of 3 stars out of 5, {{saying that the}} series [...] "certainly {{benefits}} somewhat from taking a page from" [...] Daredevil and Jessica Jones, highlighting the number of more mature elements in the episode's opening as [...] "a nice introduction that shows you this may not exactly be the same show you’ve gotten to know over the years." [...] Valentine called Robbie Reyes [...] "satisfactory" [...] and the Ghost Rider [...] "where <b>things</b> <b>really</b> shined"; [...] "ABC pretty much nail the look , and while he's obviously been tweaked to more accurately portray this new interpretation of the Spirit of Vengeance, he looks great in motion all the same ... his car has a particularly cool scene where it transforms mid air and lands in a fiery blast." [...] He called the Ghost Rider/Quake fight a highlight, and the latter's health issues [...] "an interesting twist". He concluded saying, [...] "the show still has all the flaws and strengths that [...] is known for ... if you're looking to rejoin your favorite agents for another solid romp with the added twist of throwing Ghost Rider into the mix, this one's for you." [...] Marc Buxton, also of Den of Geek, gave the episode 3.5 stars out of 5, calling it [...] "a fun way {{to kick off the}} new season". He criticized the Ghost Rider transformation scene as [...] "way too CGI cartoony" [...] and negatively compared it to Grimm, but otherwise said that [...] "Ghost Rider feels right" [...] and much improved over the Nicolas Cage Ghost Rider films. He also criticized the opening shots of Johnson, calling them [...] "misogynistic" [...] and saying, [...] "Seriously Marvel, you’re better than that." ...|$|E

2500|$|Warhol {{had this}} to say about the attack: [...] "Before I was shot, I always thought that I was more half-there than all-there—I always {{suspected}} that I was watching TV instead of living life.

[...] It was only after 1922, following the war between Greece and Turkey that <b>things</b> <b>really</b> began to change.

[...] The Silver Stallion is a loose sequel to Figures of Earth that deals with the creation of the legend of Manuel the Redeemer, in which Manuel is pictured as an infallible hero, an example to which all others should aspire; the story is told by Manuel's former knights, who remember how <b>things</b> <b>really</b> were and take different approaches to reconciling the mythology with the actuality of Manuel.|$|E
