5|$|According to Robert K. Massie and Lindsey Hughes, Peter told Zotov in October 1713 that he {{intended}} to have him marry a second time, <b>to</b> <b>Anna</b> Pashkova, a widow 50 years Zotov's junior, despite Zotov's wish to spend his final years in a monastery. However, the Brockhaus and Efron Encyclopedic Dictionary and Sergey Solovyov say that Zotov {{came up with the idea}} to marry Pashkova in 1714, and that his plan to become a monk was merely a joke.|$|E

5|$|By all accounts, {{infidelity}} {{was responsible}} for the breakup of van Meegeren’s marriage <b>to</b> <b>Anna</b> de Voogt; they were divorced on 19 July 1923. Anna left with the children and moved to Paris where van Meegeren visited his children from time to time. He now dedicated himself to portraiture and began producing forgeries to increase his income.|$|E
50|$|The {{house where}} Anna Kolesárova once lived still {{remains in the}} village of Vysoka. It is today used by a Catholic youth {{organization}} which was founded and dedicated <b>to</b> <b>Anna's</b> memory. That organization; Domcek, is organizing in volunteer work, prayer, workshops, sports games and social events. There are also frequent pilgrimages <b>to</b> <b>Anna's</b> grave, and three times a year in February, April and August, at nearby Pavlovce there is a large Catholic youth gathering, dedicated <b>to</b> <b>Anna's</b> legacy and this is increasingly popular among young Catholics of the region.|$|R

5|$|Following Christopher's {{early death}} in 931, and given Constantine VII's de facto sidelining, Stephen and Constantine assumed an {{increased}} prominence, although formally they still ranked after their brother-in-law {{in the college}} of emperors. In 933, Stephen was married <b>to</b> <b>Anna,</b> the daughter of a certain Gabalas, who was crowned Augusta on the same occasion. The couple had one known son, Romanos. According to the 11th-century chronicler George Kedrenos, he was castrated in 945, but later became a sebastophoros.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of mothers of young children, Russian law allows for {{deferment}} of a prison sentence until the child reaches the age of 14. Such a request was controversially granted in 2011 <b>to</b> <b>Anna</b> Shavenkova, who had been sentenced to two years and six months prison for vehicular manslaughter. It was alleged that her request was granted because of her family connections.|$|E
5|$|Keating {{was born}} in Norwood, Massachusetts in 1952 <b>to</b> <b>Anna</b> (Welch) of Foxborough, Massachusetts and William B. Keating of Sharon, Massachusetts.

5|$|Michael Shishman {{was married}} first <b>to</b> <b>Anna</b> Neda of Serbia, a {{daughter}} of Stefan Uroš II Milutin of Serbia. By this marriage he had several children, including Ivan Stefan, who succeeded as emperor of Bulgaria (r. 1330-1331), Michael who ruled shortly as despot of Vidin and Shishman. By his second marriage to Theodora Palaiologina, Empress of Bulgaria, {{a daughter of}} Michael IX Palaiologos of Byzantium, Michael Shishman had several children whose names are unknown.|$|E
5|$|The film {{features}} the book Istanbul: The Imperial City (1996) by John Freely. William recommends this book <b>to</b> <b>Anna,</b> commenting that (unlike another {{book in the}} store) the author has at least been to Istanbul. In reality, Freely taught at Boğaziçi University in Istanbul, and {{was the author of}} nine books about the city.|$|E
5|$|Violante Beatrice of Bavaria, to whom Gian Gastone {{had become}} quite attached, disliked the Electress and {{therefore}} left the grand ducal {{court for the}} position of governor {{of the town of}} Siena.

5|$|Brewer {{was born}} on April 17, 1979, in Vernon, British Columbia, <b>to</b> <b>Anna</b> and Frank Brewer. He was raised in Ashcroft, British Columbia, and began playing ice hockey in the Ashcroft Minor Hockey program. When he was fourteen, {{his family moved to}} Kamloops, British Columbia, where he {{attended}} junior and senior high school. Brewer excelled with the Kamloops Bantam AAA Jardine Blazers of the British Columbia Amateur Hockey Association (BCAHA). In 1995, Brewer was exposed to BCAHA Best Ever, a program designed to find and develop players and coaches for play in international competition. As a young hockey player, Brewer looked up to NHL stars Scott Niedermayer and Jeremy Roenick as role models.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Ivan Shishman {{was engaged}} in a war against the voivode of Wallachia, Dan I, between 1384 and 1386. There are few details about that war, only a brief note in the Anonymous Bulgarian Chronicle that Dan I died 23 September 1386 after being poisoned. The war {{was linked to the}} {{hostilities}} between Ivan Shishman and Ivan Sratsimir (Dan I's uncle), who had the support of the Wallachian rulers and was married <b>to</b> <b>Anna</b> of the House of Basarab.|$|E
5|$|At Lampsacus, John {{met with}} his brother, who rewarded his {{victories}} with the title of despotes, the second after the emperor himself in the Byzantine hierarchy, while his father-in-law Tornikes and his half-brother Constantine were raised to sebastokratores. Then, or sometime after, he was also given the islands of Rhodes and Lesbos as personal domains (pronoiai). In July 1261, Constantinople was recovered and the Byzantine Empire restored with Michael VIII as sole emperor. In the meantime, however, things had been going badly in Epirus, where Michael II had recovered his realm and was once again threatening imperial possessions in Macedonia. In 1261, John was sent on campaign against the Epirotes. After long and hard fighting, {{in the summer of}} 1263/1264 he achieved a major victory, which forced Michael II to come to terms: the Epirote ruler acknowledged imperial suzerainty, and his son and heir, Nikephoros, was married <b>to</b> <b>Anna</b> Palaiologina Kantakouzene, a niece of Michael VIII.|$|E

5|$|Drake Doremus was {{inspired}} to make Like Crazy {{by the end of}} his eight-year long-distance relationship with Desiree Pappenscheller, who lived in London while Doremus lived in Los Angeles. Many elements of the film resemble their real-life relationship, such as frequent travelling between Los Angeles and London, trouble with American immigration laws, a brief marriage, a trip to Santa Catalina Island (where Jacob takes Anna in the early stages of their relationship), and the gift of a bracelet (in the film, a bracelet is given <b>to</b> <b>Anna</b> by Jacob). The story was co-written by Ben York Jones, who had also been involved in long-distance relationships. Together, they assembled a 50-page outline of the film which read more like a short story than a traditional screenplay. The outline included backstory, plot points, specific scene objectives, themes and emotional moments, but had minimal dialogue.|$|E
5|$|Ferdinando beseeched Louis XIV to do {{something}} about his daughter-in-law's behaviour; he sent the Comte de Saint Mêmê. Marguerite Louise wanted to return to France, and Mêmê sympathised with this, as did much of the French court, so he left without finding a solution to the heir's domestic disharmony, incensing both Ferdinando and Louis XIV. She humiliated Cosimo at every chance she got: she insisted on employing French cooks, as she feared the Medici would poison her. In September 1664 Marguerite Louise abandoned her apartments in the Pitti, the grand ducal palace. Cosimo moved her into Villa Lapeggi. Here, she was watched by forty soldiers, and six courtiers, appointed by Cosimo, had to follow her everywhere. The next year she reconciled with the grand ducal family, and gave birth <b>to</b> <b>Anna</b> Maria Luisa, future Electress Palatine, in August 1667. The delicate rapprochement that existed between Marguerite Louise {{and the rest of the}} family collapsed after Anna Maria Luisa's birth, when Marguerite Louise caught smallpox and decided to blame Cosimo for all her problems.|$|E
5|$|In 1085, when Alexios {{recovered}} the strategically important Adriatic {{port city of}} Dyrrhachium from the Normans who had occupied it, John Doukas was installed as the military governor (doux) of the local province. John remained there until 1092, when he was replaced by John Komnenos, {{the son of the}} emperor's brother, the sebastokrator Isaac. His tenure was apparently very successful. John repelled the Serbian incursions from Duklja and Raška, and even, according <b>to</b> <b>Anna</b> Komnene, captured the Dukljan king Constantine Bodin (r. 1081–1101), before restoring him to power as a client of the Byzantine Empire. Thus John managed to restore order in the region of Albania and Dalmatia, which had suffered greatly during the Byzantine–Norman wars of the previous years. Surviving correspondence from the archbishop Theophylact of Ohrid is a testimony to his success; after John's departure from the post, Theophylact expressed nostalgia for the time of his governorship and asked for his advice.|$|E

5|$|In 1876 and {{especially}} in 1877, several other artists spent the summer in Skagen, using the Brøndums' house for accommodation and their frequent gatherings. Michael Ancher made Skagen his new home. He became engaged <b>to</b> <b>Anna</b> Brøndum in 1878 and married her in 1880. Their home then became {{a focal point for}} the artists, especially after King Christian IX bought Ancher's painting Will He Round the Point?. Anna Ancher first took a serious interest in painting after the artists began to stay in her family's inn, leaving their paintings to dry in their rooms when they left for the day. She studied them carefully and in 1875 attended Vilhelm Kyhn's art school in Copenhagen. She was later influenced by Christian Krohg who taught her the art of painting people in their everyday lives and making full use of colour. Krohg first came to Skagen in the summer of 1878, encouraged by Georg Brandes whom he had met in Berlin. He brought many of the latest international art trends with him, influencing {{the other members of the}} group. His encounters with the local population also exerted a strong influence on his own work.|$|E
5|$|In an {{alternate}} story line, Nemo admits <b>to</b> <b>Anna</b> he cannot swim; the two spend time together {{and fall in}} love. Anna {{turns out to be}} Harry's daughter and the two step siblings begin an illicit affair. They pledge their lives to one another. When Harry and Nemo's mother break up, Anna goes to New York with her father, and they lose touch. Years later, Nemo works as a pool cleaner, hoping to run into Anna by chance. They finally see one another at the train station and immediately recognize each other in a crowd of passers-by. After a passionate reunion, Anna announces she is not ready to immediately resume the relationship. She gives him her number, asks him to call her in two days and meet at the lighthouse. However, he loses her number when a sudden downpour makes her note illegible. Nemo waits at the lighthouse every day, but Anna does not come.|$|E
5|$|Neville {{once again}} {{attempts}} to administer a potential cure to the infected {{woman in his}} laboratory, but the next night, a group of Darkseekers, who had followed Anna and Neville back the night before, attacks the house. Neville, Anna, and Ethan retreat into the basement laboratory, sealing themselves in with the female Darkseeker on which Neville has been experimenting. Discovering that the last treatment was successful, Neville tries to assess the situation as the alpha male deliberately rams himself against a glass door to break in. Neville draws a vial of blood from the woman he cured and gives it <b>to</b> <b>Anna,</b> before shutting her and Ethan inside a coal chute {{in the back of}} the lab. He then takes a grenade and kills the Darkseekers at the cost of his own life, saving the cure. The next day, before dusk, Anna and Ethan discover that her theory is right as they arrive at the survivors camp in Vermont. They are greeted by some military officers and other survivors and Anna is shown handing the cure to a man.|$|E
