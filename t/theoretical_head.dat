40|$|In this paper, the {{transient}} {{behavior of}} a low specific speed centrifugal pump with straight blades during shutting down is studied through the experimental test, theoretical calculation, and numerical simulation. The variations of the rota-tional speed, flow rate, and head with time are obtained in experiment. Based on the experimental results of the rota-tional speed and flow rate, the additional <b>theoretical</b> <b>heads</b> are quantitatively calculated and analyzed. The experimental results of the rotational speed and flow rate are worked as the boundary conditions to accurately accomplish the nu-merical simulation of the transient flow during shutting down. The experimental {{results show that the}} decrease history of the flow rate evidently lags behind that of the rotational speed, while the rotational speed slightly lags behind the <b>head.</b> <b>Theoretical</b> analysis shows that there exists a clear negative head impact phenomenon in the process of stopping. The transient behavior of the centrifugal pump with straight blades mainly comes from the rotation deceleration of im-peller, and {{has nothing to do with}} the fluid deceleration. The numerical simulations show that a large area backflow can be seen when the rotational speed decreases to zero due to the flowing inertia. In conclusion, the numerical simulation of the flow field is in good agreement with the internal flow theory of centrifugal pumps...|$|R

40|$|Research on the {{efficiency}} improvement of pump as turbine (PAT) is inadequate. Blade thickness {{is an important}} geometry parameter in blade design. To explore effects of blade thickness {{on the influence of}} PAT, numerical research on three different specific speeds of PATs with different blade thickness was carried out. Their performance changes with blade thickness were presented. Besides, the variations of hydraulic loss distribution with increasing blade thickness were performed. Theoretical analysis gives a reasonable explanation for the performance change. Results show thatPAT's flow versus efficiency curve (Q-η) is lowered; flow versus head (Q-H) curve and flow versus power (Q-P) curve are increased with increasing blade thickness. The increase of Q-P is mainly attributed to the increase of <b>theoretical</b> <b>head</b> caused by increasing blockage of impeller inlet area. Hydraulic loss distribution analysis indicates that the total hydraulic loss within PAT is increased with increasing blade thickness. The increase of Q-H curve is a combined effect of the increase in <b>theoretical</b> <b>head</b> and the total hydraulic loss.

40|$|A {{formula of}} the <b>theoretical</b> <b>head,</b> {{which gives the}} value of the {{impeller}} in terms of its geometrical parameters, is used to calculate the pump head at the stage of theoretical design. One of the main assumptions in this case is a strip theory, which does not take into consideration the unevenness of curves of the meridional and circumferential velocity components at the impeller outlet of a centrifugal pump. The article studies this influence. Describes a mathematical model for theoretical and numerical calculations. Shows the figures of the flow part under study and of the computational grid. For complete formalization of the problem the meshing models and boundary conditions are shown. As the boundary conditions, full pump-inlet head into the flow part and velocity at the outlet were used. Then, there are the graphs to compare the results of theoretical and numerical calculation and the error is shown. For comparison, a value of the <b>theoretical</b> <b>head</b> was multiplied by the efficiency, which was defined by computer simulation. A designing process of the flow part was iterative, so the comparison was carried out for all iterations. It should be noted that correction for the finite number of blades is also assumption. To determine a degree of the errors impact because of this correction, an average value of the circumferential component of the fluid velocity at the impeller outlet was calculated by two above methods followed by their comparison. It was shown that this impact is negligible, i. e. correction provides a sufficiently accurate value. In conclusion, the paper explains the possible reasons for inaccuracies in theoretical determination of the head, as well as the option to eliminate this inaccuracy, thereby reducing the time required for defining the basic parameters of the flow part. To illustrate the nature of fluid flow, for the last iteration are given the fields of the pressure distribution and the velocity vector in the equatorial section of the flow.
