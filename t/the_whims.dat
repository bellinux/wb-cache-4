40|$|We have {{developed}} a new method to approach the missing baryons problem. We assume that the missing baryons reside in a form of Warm Hot Intergalactic Medium, i. e. <b>the</b> <b>WHIM.</b> Our method consists of (a) detecting the coherent large scale structure in the spatial distribution of galaxies that traces the Cosmic Web and that in hydrodynamical simulations is associated to <b>the</b> <b>WHIM,</b> (b) map its luminosity into a galaxy luminosity density field, (c) use numerical simulations to relate the luminosity density to the density of <b>the</b> <b>WHIM,</b> (d) apply this relation to real data to trace <b>the</b> <b>WHIM</b> using <b>the</b> observed galaxy luminosities in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey and 2 dF redshift surveys. In our application we find evidence for <b>the</b> <b>WHIM</b> along <b>the</b> line of sight to the Sculptor Wall, at redshifts consistent with the recently reported X-ray absorption line detections. Our indirect WHIM detection technique complements the standard method based on the detection of characteristic X-ray absorption lines, showing that the galaxy luminosity density is a reliable signpost for <b>the</b> <b>WHIM.</b> For this reason, our method {{could be applied to}} current galaxy surveys to optimise the observational strategies for detecting and studying <b>the</b> <b>WHIM</b> and its properties. Our estimates of <b>the</b> <b>WHIM</b> hydrogen column density in Sculptor agree with those obtained via the X-ray analysis.

5|$|The rush of {{technology}} and the commercialisation of agriculture {{in the second half}} of the 19th century was marked by economic setbacks—many small farmers became dependent on <b>the</b> <b>whims</b> of far-away markets. There was an increase in the number of large-scale famines, and, despite the risks of infrastructure development borne by Indian taxpayers, little industrial employment was generated for Indians.

The railway network provided critical famine relief, notably reduced the cost of moving goods, and helped nascent Indian-owned industry.|$|E
5|$|Semantic {{challenges}} to divine command theory have been proposed; the philosopher William Wainwright argued {{that to be}} commanded by God and to be morally obligatory do not have an identical meaning, which he believed would make defining obligation difficult. He also contended that, as knowledge of God is required for morality by divine command theory, atheists and agnostics could not be moral; he saw this as a weakness of the theory. Others have challenged the theory on modal grounds by arguing that, even if God's command and morality correlate in this world, they may not do so in other possible worlds. In addition, the Euthyphro dilemma, first proposed by Plato (in the context of polytheistic Greek religion), presented a dilemma which threatened either to leave morality subject to <b>the</b> <b>whims</b> of God, or challenge his omnipotence. Divine command theory has also been criticised for its apparent incompatibility with the omnibenevolence of God, moral autonomy and religious pluralism, although some scholars have attempted to defend the theory from these challenges.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The Warm-Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM) {{is thought}} to {{contribute}} about 40 − 50 % to the baryonic budget at the present evolution stage of the universe. The observed large scale structure {{is likely to be}} due to gravitational growth of density fluctuations in the post-inflation era. The evolving cosmic web is governed by non-linear gravitational growth of the initially weak density fluctuations in the dark energy dominated cosmology. Non-linear structure formation, accretion and merging processes, star forming and AGN activity produce gas shocks in <b>the</b> <b>WHIM.</b> Shock waves are converting a fraction of the gravitation power to thermal and non-thermal emission of baryonic/leptonic matter. They provide the most likely way to power the luminous matter in <b>the</b> <b>WHIM.</b> <b>The</b> plasma shocks in <b>the</b> <b>WHIM</b> are expected to be collisionless. Collisionless shocks produce a highly non-equilibrium state with anisotropic temperatures and a large differences in ion and electron temperatures. We discuss the ion and electron heating by the collisionless shocks and then review the plasma processes responsible for the Coulomb equilibration and collisional ionisation equilibrium of oxygen ions in <b>the</b> <b>WHIM.</b> MHD-turbulence produced by the strong collisionless shocks could provide a sizeable non-thermal contribution to the observed Doppler parameter of the UV line spectra of <b>the</b> <b>WHIM...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{approach}} to the missing baryons problem. Building on the common assumption that the missing baryons are {{in the form of the}} Warm Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM), we further assumed here that the galaxy luminosity density can be used as a tracer of <b>the</b> <b>WHIM.</b> <b>The</b> latter assumption is supported by our finding of a significant correlation between <b>the</b> <b>WHIM</b> density and <b>the</b> galaxy luminosity density in the hydrodynamical simulations of Cui et al. (2012). We further found that the fraction of the gas mass in <b>the</b> <b>WHIM</b> phase is substantially (by a factor of ∼ 1. 6) higher within the large scale galactic filaments, i. e. ∼ 70 %, compared to the average in the full simulation volume of ∼ 0. 1 Gpc^ 3. The relation between <b>the</b> <b>WHIM</b> overdensity and <b>the</b> galaxy luminosity overdensity within the galactic filaments is consistent with linear: δ_ whim = 0. 7 ± 0. 1 × δ_LD^ 0. 9 ± 0. 2. We applied our procedure to the line of sight to the blazar H 2356 - 309 and found evidence for <b>the</b> <b>WHIM</b> in correspondence of the Sculptor Wall (z ∼ 0. 03 and N_H = 19. 9 ^+ 0. 1 _- 0. 3) and Pisces-Cetus superclusters (z ∼ 0. 06 and N_H = 19. 7 ^+ 0. 2 _- 0. 3), in agreement with the redshifts and column densities of the X-ray absorbers identified and studied by Fang et al. (2010) and Zappacosta et al. (2010). This agreement indicates that the galaxy luminosity density and galactic filaments are reliable signposts for <b>the</b> <b>WHIM</b> and that our method is robust in estimating <b>the</b> <b>WHIM</b> density. <b>The</b> signal that we detected cannot originate from the halos of the nearby galaxies since they cannot account for <b>the</b> large <b>WHIM</b> column densities that our method and X-ray analysis consistently find in the Sculptor Wall and Pisces-Cetus superclusters.

40|$|About {{half of the}} baryons in {{the local}} Universe are not yet {{observed}} and are thought to reside in the intergalactic medium at temperatures of 0. 1 - 10 million K and densities of 10 - 6 - 10 - 4 cm- 3. This is called warm-hot intergalactic medium (WHIM). In this paper, we summarize search for emission from <b>the</b> <b>WHIM,</b> and show prospects with future instruments. Using XIS instrument onboard Suzaku, we searched for redshifted OVII and OVIII WHIM emission lines, in cluster outskirts and superclusters: Shapley supercluster, Sculptor supercluster, A 2218, A 1413, A 2142, A 2052, and the Coma cluster. The chance for detecting a signal {{was estimated to be}} sufficient to motivate our search, given the relatively high density and high temperature expected for <b>the</b> <b>WHIM</b> in these regions. We did not detect the significant emission, but obtained upper limits in OVII and OVIII emission intensities for these clusters and superclusters. The density of <b>the</b> <b>WHIM</b> was constrained based on the upper limits, which is 200 - 300 times mean baryon density of the Universe.

To determine physical properties (spatial distribution, temperature and density) of <b>the</b> <b>WHIM,</b> spatial structure of the soft extended X-ray emission surrounding field galaxies is carefully investigated using the XMM-Newton EPIC/MOS observations. Angular correlations between the galaxy distribution and the soft X-ray background extending over several arcmin are determined. The correlations at large scales result from the clustering of galaxies. At small scales (below ~ 2 arcmin) the excess of the soft flux is interpreted as the genuine emission from halos of <b>the</b> <b>WHIM</b> surrounding individual galaxies. Bulk parameters of <b>the</b> average <b>WHIM</b> halos associated with galaxies in the sample are estimated.
