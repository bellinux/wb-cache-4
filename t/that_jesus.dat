2500|$|Although not {{literally}} {{the face of}} Jesus, {{the result of the}} study determined <b>that</b> <b>Jesus's</b> skin would have been more olive-colored than white, and that he would have most likely looked like a typical Galilean Semite of his day. Among the points made was that the Bible records <b>that</b> <b>Jesus's</b> disciple Judas had to point him out to those arresting him. The implied argument is <b>that</b> if <b>Jesus's</b> physical appearance had differed markedly from his disciples, then he would have been relatively easy to identify. James H. Charlesworth states Jesus' face was [...] "most likely dark brown and sun-tanned", and his stature [...] "may have been between five feet five [...] and five feet seven [...] ".|$|R

5|$|Many modern {{scholars}} {{question the}} idea <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> {{was born in}} Bethlehem, seeing the biblical stories not as historical accounts but as symbolic narratives invented to present the birth as fulfillment of prophecy and imply {{a connection to the}} lineage of King David. The Gospel of Mark and the Gospel of John do not include a nativity narrative, but refer to him only as being from Nazareth. In a 2005 article in Archaeology magazine, archaeologist Aviram Oshri points to an absence of evidence for the settlement of Bethlehem near Jerusalem at the time when Jesus was born, and postulates <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> was born in Bethlehem of Galilee. In a 2011 article in Biblical Archaeology Review magazine, Jerome Murphy-O'Connor argues for the traditional position <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> was born in Bethlehem near Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|Non-Christian {{sources are}} {{valuable}} in two ways. First, {{they show that}} even neutral or hostile parties never evince any doubt <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> actually existed. Second, they present a rough picture of Jesus that is compatible with that found in the Christian sources: <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> was a teacher, {{had a reputation as}} a miracle worker, had a brother James, and died a violent death.|$|E
5|$|Sanders {{says that}} the genealogies of Jesus are based not on {{historical}} information but on the authors' desire to show <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> was the universal Jewish savior. In any event, once {{the doctrine of the}} virgin birth of Jesus became established, that tradition superseded the earlier tradition that he was descended from David through Joseph. Luke reports <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> was a blood relation of John the Baptist, but scholars generally consider this connection to be invented.|$|E

5|$|The Christ myth {{theory is}} the {{hypothesis}} <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> of Nazareth never existed; {{or if he}} did, that he had virtually {{nothing to do with}} the founding of Christianity and the accounts in the gospels.

Most Christians believe Jesus enables humans to be reconciled to God. The Nicene Creed asserts <b>that</b> <b>Jesus</b> will judge {{the living and the}} dead either before or after their bodily resurrection, an event tied to the Second Coming of Jesus in Christian eschatology. The great majority of Christians worship Jesus as the incarnation of God the Son, the second of three persons of a Divine Trinity. A minority of Christian denominations reject Trinitarianism, wholly or partly, as non-scriptural.|$|E

Jesus' Jewish critics considered his ministry to be scandalous because he feasted with sinners, fraternized with women, and allowed his followers to pluck grain on the Sabbath. According to Sanders, it is not plausible that disagreements over how to interpret the Law of Moses and the Sabbath would have led Jewish authorities to want Jesus killed.|$|E
