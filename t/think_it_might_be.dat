500|$|It was Jones who {{ultimately}} played {{most of the}} bass parts during the Bollocks recordings; Howard calls his rudimentary, rumbling approach the [...] "explosive missing ingredient" [...] of the Sex Pistols' sound. Vicious's bass is reportedly present on one track that appeared on the original album release, [...] "Bodies". Jones recalls, [...] "He played his farty old bass part and we just let him do it. When he left I dubbed another part on, leaving Sid's down low. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> barely audible on the track." [...] Following [...] "God Save the Queen", two more singles were released: [...] "Pretty Vacant" [...] (largely written by Matlock) on 1 July and from the Bollocks sessions, [...] "Holidays in the Sun" [...] on 14 October. Each was a Top Ten hit.|$|E
500|$|Discussing her own {{reaction}} to the storyline, Smith has commented; [...] "I was psyched. I {{thought it was a}} great idea." [...] She revealed that the writers have not fully divulged Hahn's romantic backstory to her, explaining; [...] "a lot of it is still vague. I mean, there's what the writers think and what I've sort of thought, and in my mind. Maybe I had a crush in high school or in college or something— there was something, but I don't think it's ever— I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> her first time." [...] Continuing with this theme, Smith also spoke with Kristin Dos Santos for E! about her character's lack of definitive romantic history, jesting; [...] "I'll look at the script next week and be like [...] "Oh my God, I've been a lesbian for years and I didn't know." [...] She also discussed the meetings with GLAAD she and Ramirez attended, and their impact on her portrayal of the storyline, explaining: [...] "It was actually very helpful because they did talk about their own personal lives, and how, I guess if you're an open person, and life is change, then anything can happen. And it could really rock your world I imagine, if you all of a sudden thought that you might be in love with a woman and maybe you weren't before." ...|$|E

50|$|Chris French, a {{professor}} {{who studies the}} psychology of paranormal belief, <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> confirmation bias of life after death and cryptomnesia of the bits of information she researched which contribute to her belief {{that she has been}} reincarnated.|$|R
2500|$|This {{could be}} seen as {{referring}} to the new Church's belief that they had superseded Judaism through Jesus' death, resurrection and role as the messiah.

2500|$|Brummell took a {{house on}} Chesterfield Street in Mayfair {{and for a time}} managed to avoid the nightly gaming and other extravagances fashionable in such {{elevated}} circles. [...] Where he refused to economise was on his dress: when asked how much it would cost to keep a single man in clothes, he was said to have replied: [...] "Why, with tolerable economy, I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> done with £800." [...] That amount is approximately £52,000 ($67,000) in 2016 currency; the average wage for a craftsman at that time was £52 a year.|$|E
2500|$|Maclean {{returned}} to the islands and settled on Vis as being the best site for an airstrip and a naval base. [...] He then needed to garrison it. [...] He discussed the matter with General Alexander and his Chief of Staff General John Harding, who seemed to <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> possible, and who gave him a lift to Marrakech to put the matter to the prime minister. [...] Churchill assured him {{on the point of}} troops, and wrote a personal letter to Tito which he commissioned Maclean to deliver. [...] Maclean parachuted into Bosnia again, thinking it no longer an unknown, as it had been only six months before. Tito, since the end of November Marshal of Yugoslavia, was delighted with the recognition from Churchill, as from one statesman to another.|$|E

2500|$|In spring 2009, {{the band}} began {{recording}} material for its third studio album. However, on July 6, 2009, Ryan Ross and Jon Walker announced via the band's official website {{that the two}} were leaving the band. In an interview following the split, Ross explained that he first brought the idea to Smith in late June 2009 over lunch: [...] "Spencer and I had lunch and caught up for a while, and then the big question came up, like, 'Well, {{what do you want}} to do?' and I said, 'Well, I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> best if we kind of do our own thing for a while,' and he said, 'I'm glad you said that, because I was going to say the same thing,'" [...] Ross recalled. [...] "And there was really no argument, which is really the best way that could've worked out." [...] Ross said the split was largely due to creative differences between him and Urie. Urie wanted the band to explore a more polished pop sound, while Ross – and, by extension, Walker – was interested in making retro-inspired rock.|$|E
2500|$|In 1967, in his {{capacity}} as a military adviser Dyson wrote an influential paper on the issue of possible US use of tactical nuclear weapons in the Vietnam War. When a general said in a meeting, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> a good idea to throw in a nuke now and then, just to keep the other side guessing..." [...] Dyson became alarmed and obtained permission to write an objective report discussing {{the pros and cons of}} using such weapons from a purely military point of view. (This report, Tactical Nuclear Weapons in Southeast Asia, published by the Institute for Defense Analyses, was obtained, with some redactions, by the Nautilus Institute for Security and Sustainability under the Freedom of Information act in 2002.) It was sufficiently objective that both sides in the debate based their arguments on it. Dyson says that the report showed that, even from a narrow military point of view, the US was better off not using nuclear weapons. Dyson stated on the Dick Cavett show that the use of nuclear weaponry was a bad idea for the US at the time because [...] "our targets were large and theirs were small." [...] (His unstated assumption was that the Soviets would respond by supplying tactical nukes to the other side.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Rhodes quietly {{planned to}} annex some of Mozambique into the Company domain {{so he could}} {{establish}} a major port {{at the mouth of}} the Pungwe River. He thought this might make an ideal sea outlet for his proposed settlement in Mashonaland, the area directly to Matabeleland's north-east where Lobengula held dominion over many Mashona chiefs. Rhodes believed that the Portuguese claim to Mozambique was tenuous enough that he could win much of it without provoking major ire: [...] "the occupation of the Portuguese even along the coast line is in most places merely a paper one," [...] he wrote to Whitehall in late 1889, [...] "and if this has not been recognised by international agreement I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> left open." [...] But contrary to Rhodes's opinion, general consensus at the Berlin Conference of 1884–85 had made Portugal's hold over the Mozambican coastline very secure. The Portuguese had expanded inland during the late 1880s, creating Manicaland in the eastern Mashona country. They founded Beira, a port on Rhodes's proposed Pungwe site, in 1890. Portugal issued the so-called [...] "Pink Map" [...] around this time, laying claim to the very corridor of land between Angola and Mozambique that Rhodes desired. The British government issued a firm ultimatum against the Portuguese claims in January 1890; Lisbon swiftly acquiesced and left the area open for the Company's drive north.|$|E

2500|$|Yearwood {{has found}} major {{influences}} {{in a variety}} of musical artists. She grew accustomed to influence from Southern rock bands, which include The Allman Brothers, Eagles, as well as country rock artists such as Emmylou Harris, Elvis Presley, and James Taylor. Yearwood stated that her primary musical influence is Linda Ronstadt, whom Yearwood had often been identified and compared within her albums. Yearwood says, [...] "She had a power and an emotion in her voice that made you believe every word she sang. My favorite song was probably 'Love Has No Pride,' but I listened to everything over and over. I knew the albums so well I knew which song it was from the first note." [...] She had recorded some of Ronstadt's compositions, including [...] "Try Me Again" [...] for her 2000 album, Real Live Woman. Yearwood said that she has never considered herself as a songwriter, but is precise about choosing songs that she can relate to. She stated, [...] "I always select music based on emotion, how it makes me feel, even before I made records. My producer, Garth Fundis, and I have to catch ourselves if we begin to think about recording a song we don't believe in just because we <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> a hit." [...] She also stated that even though she does not record any of her own material, she has written music that still has yet to be recorded.|$|E
2500|$|On July 6, 2009, Ryan Ross and Jon Walker {{announced}} via the band's {{official website}} {{that the two}} were leaving the band. The statement, in part, read: [...] "Ryan Ross and Jon Walker will be leaving Panic at the Disco {{to embark on a}} musical excursion of their own. Though the four of us have made music together in the past, we’ve creatively evolved in different directions which has compromised what each of us want to personally achieve. Over the years, we have remained close and honest with each other, which helped us to realize that our goals were different and that parting ways is truly what is best for each of us." [...] In an interview following the split, Ross explained that he first brought the idea to Smith in late June 2009 over lunch: [...] "Spencer and I had lunch and caught up for a while, and then the big question came up, like, 'Well, {{what do you want to}} do?' and I said, 'Well, I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> best if we kind of do our own thing for a while,' and he said, 'I'm glad you said that, because I was going to say the same thing,' [...] " [...] Ross recalled.
