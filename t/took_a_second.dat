On July 7, 1826, the morning of the scheduled execution, Anna asked the guard to give her privacy to dress. Once the guard left, Anna revealed to Beauchamp that she had smuggled in a knife, and she and her husband stabbed themselves. Anna was taken to a nearby house to be treated by doctors.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the game, feeling insulted, Tregubov {{refused to}} shake his hand. Two days after the game, Tregubov and his team would {{complain}} to arbiters about his suspect strong play, and his frequent toilet breaks. On the second day, Bindrich had the black pieces against Sebastian Siebrecht and on move 10, he <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> toilet break. Siebrecht, having played such cheaters as Christoph Natsidis in the past, suspected that he was using an analysis program on his smartphone. On Bindrich's return an arbiter asked to search him and that he give over his smartphone, which under tournament rules, the refereee is allowed to do. Bindrich refused to hand it over, saying that there was private information on the phone, and he was forfeited the game.|$|E
5|$|Henry's only {{legitimate}} son and heir, William Adelin, {{drowned in}} the White Ship disaster of 1120, throwing the royal succession into doubt. Henry <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> wife, Adeliza, {{in the hope of}} having another son, but their marriage was childless. In response to this, Henry declared his daughter, Matilda, his heir and married her to Geoffrey of Anjou. The relationship between Henry and the couple became strained, and fighting broke out along the border with Anjou. Henry died on 1 December 1135 after a week of illness. Despite his plans for Matilda, the King was succeeded by his nephew, Stephen of Blois, resulting in a period of civil war known as the Anarchy.|$|E

5|$|Contador {{continued}} to be troubled by his injury during stage 8, which finished on the climb of the Campitello Matese. The stage was won by Beñat Intxausti (Movistar), {{who was in the}} day's early breakaway and attacked on the final climb. Astana again rode hard to put pressure on the other riders; eventually a group formed of Contador, Aru, Porte and Landa. Landa then attacked and finished second on the stage, 15 seconds ahead of the other three riders. He therefore moved up into fifth place overall, while Contador increased his lead over Aru by winning bonus seconds at an intermediate sprint. Stage 9 was also won by a rider from a breakaway: Paolo Tiralongo (Astana) took a solo victory. Aru, Contador, Porte and Landa were again alone in a group {{towards the end of the}} stage; although they came to the finish together, Aru <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> out of the others in the sprint. This moved him to three seconds behind Contador. The following day was the first rest day of the race.|$|E
5|$|On leaving school, Headley was {{appointed}} {{as a temporary}} clerk in a magistrate's court; this enabled him to play competitive cricket for the St Andrew's Police side in 1926, in a cup competition. Some impressive performances for the club earned him an invitation to practice with the Jamaica Colts team. However, his job {{made it impossible to}} attend, and he was not considered for the Jamaican side against Lord Tennyson's English touring side in 1927. That year, Headley began working for Keeling–Lindo Estates, in St Catherine. The firm were enthusiastic cricket patrons, allowing employees time off to play in matches, so that Headley was able to attend practice with the Jamaica team on a regular basis. He also moved to the St Catherine Cricket Club, captained by his immediate superior in Keeling–Lindo. To generate more income, Headley <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> job, working for the Jamaica Fruit and Shipping Company, but he wanted a secure profession. To this end, he planned to move to America to pursue a career in dentistry. However, he was now on the verge of the Jamaica team and a delay in the arrival of the application forms for his American work permit allowed him to make his first-class debut for Jamaica against another touring team led by Lord Tennyson.|$|E
5|$|Through late September, Caltech seismometers {{recorded}} 188 aftershocks {{higher than}} magnitude 4.0. Six {{of those on}} the day of the mainshock were M5 and above, but some of these (like the 12:05 M6.3 shock) were only felt, and didn't cause any damage. The July 21 M5.1 shock at 15:13 GMT and the July 23 shock at 00:38 both damaged buildings in Arvin, and the latter event also caused slight damage in Fresno and near Bakersfield. Three additional shocks on July 23 were particularly destructive. Walls and other portions of buildings that had been previously damaged <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> hit from the 07:53 M5.2 event, and a house that saw only minor damage during the mainshock was nearly destroyed by it. Gas and water lines were also severed, and transformers were loosened or dislodged. The 13:17 M5.8 shock compounded problems at Tehachapi and Arvin with damage to previously-affected buildings that was described as serious, but the 18:13 shock on July 23 only had a slight affect at Arvin.|$|E

5|$|Upon its digital {{release in}} April2010, Seili debuted at {{number one on}} the Finnish Albums Chart. The album went {{gradually}} down to number seven in early August, after which it vacillated between seven and four. Seili rose back to number one in October, holding the top spot for 12consecutiveweeks and charted in the top three until early March2011. Altogether, the album spent 15weeks atop the chart, 58weeks in the top ten and it charted for a total of 62non-consecutive weeks, over a year, becoming the 11th-longest-charting of all time. Seili <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>second</b> jump in July2011, as it leaped from number17 to number two, after which it dropped out of the chart. With sales surpassing 150,000copies (from which 95,000 in 2010, 42,000 in 2011 and 14,000 in 2012), Seili was the best-selling album in Finland in 2010 and the sixth-best-selling in 2011, receiving the septuple-platinum certification. The album was re-released by Finnish music retailers in a limited vinyl edition on 14 January 2011, as part of their joint Levyale campaign. The edition was sold out in five days.|$|E

During his first trip he had encountered a holy man who prophesied that he would only reach Mecca by travelling through Syria. The diversion held an added advantage; because of the holy places that lay along the way, including Hebron, Jerusalem, and Bethlehem, the Mamluk authorities spared no efforts in keeping the route safe for pilgrims. Without this help many travellers would be robbed and murdered.|$|E
25|$|In 1727, Mosley {{completed}} her apprenticeship, became a member, or mistress, {{in her own}} right of the Clockmakers' Company, and set up her own business in London.

She was paid £50 for each girl. At least two other of Mosley's sisters were also milliners - Elizabeth, who was apprenticed to a milliner in York; and Dorothy, who eventually took over Mosley's business.|$|E
