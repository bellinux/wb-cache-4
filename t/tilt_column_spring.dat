40|$|The {{resolution}} of {{numerical weather prediction}} models is constantly increasing, making it necessary to consider three-dimensional radiative transfer effects such as cloud shadows cast into neighboring grid cells and thus affecting radiative heating. For that purpose, fast approximations are needed since threedimensional radiative transfer solvers are computationally far too expensive. For the solar spectral range, different approaches of how to consider three-dimensional effects were presented in the past—in particular, the <b>tilted</b> independent <b>column</b> approximation (TICA), which aims at improving the calculation of the direct radiation, and the nonlocal <b>tilted</b> independent <b>column</b> approximation (NTICA), {{which is used to}} additionally correct the diffuse radiation...|$|R
40|$|The tilt of the {{columnar}} microstructure {{has been}} studied for Cu and Cr thin films grown off-normally using highly ionized vapor fluxes, generated by the deposition technique high power impulse magnetron sputtering. It is found that the relatively large <b>column</b> <b>tilt</b> (with respect to the substrate normal) observed for Cu films decreases as the ionization degree of the deposition flux increases. On the contrary, Cr columns are found to grow relatively close to the substrate normal and the <b>column</b> <b>tilt</b> is independent from the ionization degree of the vapor flux when films are deposited at room temperature. The Cr <b>column</b> <b>tilt</b> is only found {{to be influenced by}} the ionized fluxes when films are grown at elevated temperatures, suggesting that film morphology during the film nucleation stage is also important in affecting <b>column</b> <b>tilt.</b> A phenomenological model that accounts for the effect of atomic shadowing at different nucleation conditions is suggested to explain the results...|$|R

40|$|A {{turbulent}} diffusion model {{shows that there}} are two different mechanisms for the development of phytoplankton blooms. One of these mechanisms works in well-mixed environments and corresponds to the classical critical depth theory. The other mechanism is based on the rate of turbulent mixing. If turbulent mixing is less than a critical turbulence, phytoplankton growth rates exceed the vertical mixing rates, and a bloom develops irrespective of the depth of the upper water layer. These results demonstrate that phytoplankton blooms can develop in the absence of vertical water-column stratification.

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} {{systematic}} analysis of the mechanical properties of nanocolumnar TiO 2 thin films prepared by evaporation at a glancing geometry. A systematic study of the mechanical properties is carried out by comparing the hardness and the Young's modulus determined by nanoindentation for thin films prepared at different deposition angles and characterized by a tilted nanocolumnar structure and others where the nanocolumns are perpendicular to the substrate or are arranged as zig-zag stacked layers. A correlation between mechanical properties and glazing angle geometry is proposed. Differences in the results are discussed {{in view of the}} cross section images obtained by focused ion beam and of the deformed areas. Zig-zagged layers present lower values of hardness and Young's modulus due to the collapse of the angles of the columns, {{but at the same time}} this configuration impedes the appearance of fracture or delamination, as observed for <b>tilted</b> <b>columns.</b> © 2013 Elsevier B.

30|$|It is {{unavoidable}} {{that the sample}} will be slightly tilted relative to the ideal zone axis. Figure 8 shows the distribution of errors in the planar strain for increasing tilt, α, around the Ω _ 1 -axis. At tilt α = 1.0 ^∘, the errors have changed very little compared to the untilted crystal, though {{the appearance of the}} image have changed in the central part of particle, this is due to an effective diminishing of the projected potential, as have been reported elsewhere [49]. The errors stay small up to a tilt α = 2.0 ^∘, but increase sharply in the centre of the nanoparticle between α = 2.0 ^∘ and α = 3.0 ^∘. The error introduced by tilt is very dependent on the height of the atomic columns, since the length of the footprint of the projection of a <b>tilted</b> <b>column</b> increases linearly with its height. Only one direction of tilt is shown; however, the trends are similar for other tilt directions. One other tilt directions is included as Additional file 1 : Figure S 6.|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of highly ionized fluxes on the biaxial alignment in thin films {{has been investigated}} by studying {{the relation between the}} effect of ionization degrees and different process conditions, including magnetron position, working pressure and substrate bias voltage. In this thesis work, SEM and XRD techniques were employed to study the morphology and crystallographic properties of Cr films grown by High Power Impulse Magnetron Sputtering (HiPIMS) and Direct Current Magnetron Sputtering (DCMS) on Si substrate with a native SiO 2 layer. These Cr films are composed of <b>tilted</b> <b>column</b> structures. Denser films can be observed when the ionization degree is increased or the substrate bias voltage is applied. For the crystallographic texture of the films, {{it can be seen that}} the films grown by fluxes with higher ionization degrees are possible to form a better biaxial alignment. However, it still highly depends on the process conditions, which influence the atomistic process during deposition. In addition, several specific features are found in this thesis work, e. g. texture transformation and double biaxial texture. It is shown that, with specific process conditions, some of the grains are able to exhibit different orientations, changing the crystallographic texture of films...|$|R
