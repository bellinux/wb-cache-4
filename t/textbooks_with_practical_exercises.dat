40|$|Abstract — E-learning systems {{become more}} and more {{important}} in higher education. But a lot of e-learning courses are only based on theory or simulations, making them inefficient and also uninteresting for students. Especially in the field of computer engineering, the experience of using real hardware is very important for the understanding of it. Therefore, we propose a virtual hardware laboratory where students are taught in circuit design, can simulate and finally test their designs on real FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) hardware via a remote connection. In this paper, we present the requirements for such a virtual laboratory, how we built the system and how it can be used. Finally, a complete e-learning course called FPGA online <b>with</b> <b>practical</b> <b>exercises</b> in an online laboratory was created and is now part of the Virtual University of Bavaria (vhb) ...|$|R

Given this basic truth, {{it is clear that}} living in the world requires spatial functioning of some kind. Being creative in this world, and designing new tools and new habitats, probably requires even higher levels of spatial functioning. And people vary in their levels of spatial ability.

For example, should design schools accept only applicants who test high in spatial ability, following the lead of dental schools, which assess spatial thought on the Dental Admissions Test or <b>with</b> <b>practical</b> <b>exercises</b> in assignments such as tooth modeling? Or should design schools strive to enhance the spatial ability of anyone with the desire to do creative design, following the lead of selection committees for surgical residencies, which do not assess spatial ability in any way?

In this paper we describe an exploratory case study that investigates one of the main challenges in framework usage [...] effective understanding. The study gathered a mixture of quantitative and qualitative data as subjects learned to use a Java version of the HotDraw framework over a 12 -week period.

We compare these findings to recent work by Schull, Lanubile and Basili, supporting their hypothesis that examples are well suited for framework learning by novices, but arguing that both hierarchical and dynamic models also seem critically important.

The problem that exist within education in BI is the knowledge gap that exist between the necessary knowledge in both analytic and technical fields. The {{purpose of this study}} is to propose and discuss the ways BI-knowledge can be transferred to people that work in the BI-field. The study is based on research, interviews and the training opportunities that our collaborative cooperation presented. Throughout this study we interviewed three people, were all of them worked in the BI-field. Beside the interviews we also attended trainings opportunities in BI which were based on theory and demonstration of a BI-system. After the training, we performed a configuration of the BI-system, with the purpose of evaluating the knowledge we got from the training and give feedback regarding the configuration. To help minimize the knowledge gap that exist in the analytic and technical fields, we propose that you construct the education with the individual background of the participant in mind and use different education methods to help stimulate the necessary cognitive modes for better knowledge receptivity.
