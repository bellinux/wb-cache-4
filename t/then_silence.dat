500|$|In 1847, Holmes {{was hired}} as Parkman Professor of Anatomy and Physiology at Harvard Medical School, where he served as dean until 1853 and taught until 1882. Soon after his appointment, Holmes was criticized by the all-male student body for {{considering}} granting admission to a woman named Harriot Kezia Hunt. Facing opposition from not only students but also university overseers and other faculty members, {{she was asked to}} withdraw her application. Harvard Medical School would not admit a woman until 1945. Holmes's training in Paris led him to teach his students the importance of anatomico-pathological basis of disease, and that [...] "no doctrine of prayer or special providence is to be his excuse for not looking straight at secondary causes." [...] Students were fond of Holmes, to whom they referred as [...] "Uncle Oliver". One teaching assistant recalled: [...] "He enters [...] and is greeted by a mighty shout and stamp of applause. <b>Then</b> <b>silence,</b> and there begins a charming hour of description, analysis, anecdote, harmless pun, which clothes the dry bones with poetic imagery, enlivens a hard and fatiguing day with humor, and brightens to the tired listener the details for difficult though interesting study." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tens of {{thousands}} of people waiting in St Peter's Square reacted with timid applause and <b>then</b> <b>silence</b> a little before noon when smoke of indeterminate color appeared and the lack of bell-ringing indicated that the morning's ballotting was inconclusive. Press speculation held that [...] "a pope who was elected tonight at the fourth-fifth ballot or tomorrow morning at the sixth-seventh would still be a pontiff elected promptly. Beyond that perhaps some problems might arise." ...|$|E
2500|$|Finally, Zehaf-Bibeau {{reached an}} alcove by the {{entrance}} to the Library of Parliament, and hid out of sight of RCMP officers, who ordered him to drop his gun and surrender. The location of the alcove is near the office of the Sergeant-at-Arms of the House of Commons, Kevin Vickers. Vickers, a distinguished policeman, commander and administrator with the RCMP before he joined the staff of the House of Commons in 2005, obtained a 9mm handgun from a lock-box and entered the hall. Vickers' security team, which had been chasing Zehaf-Bibeau, yelled to Vickers that the suspect was hiding in the alcove. Vickers immediately ran behind {{the other side of a}} nearby column, then dove past the column and fired upward at Zehaf-Bibeau. [...] Witnesses and reports show RCMP Constable Curtis Barrett, leading the tactical formation, fired the shot that killed Zehaf-Bibeau after Bibeau fired in his direction. CBC television cameras on the scene recorded over 30 shots fired in the final gunfight. Footage showed a group of RCMP officers converging near the alcove; two loud gunshots are heard, then a large number of gunshots in rapid succession, <b>then</b> <b>silence.</b>|$|E

60|$|Conversation was slack. Jessie {{wanted to}} know the {{distance}} to Ringwood. <b>Then</b> <b>silence</b> fell again.|$|E
60|$|As {{soon as we}} parted I felt a {{sense of}} relief.

60|$|Then up {{rolled a}} heavy crash, a long roar of sliding rocks dying away in distant echo, <b>then</b> <b>silence</b> unbroken.|$|E
60|$|There was a {{clash of}} steel against steel, {{a few words of}} command, the sound of {{retreating}} footsteps, <b>then</b> <b>silence.</b>|$|E

50|$|Van Dijk {{started off}} the season slowly, only scoring 1 goal {{in his first}} 10 matches {{although}} managing 6 assists at the time.
