5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{continued to}} intensify, although the NHC anticipated strengthening to cease, because the hurricane {{was expected to}} move into areas of colder sea surface temperatures. During this period, the winds of the system increased and Fausto became a Category 4 hurricane. Becoming a Category4 hurricane, Fausto attained its peak intensity, with winds of 145mph (230km/h) and a minimum barometric pressure of 936mbar (hPa; 27.64inHg). After attaining peak intensity, the NHC again noted <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> likely that Fausto attained its peak intensity, as it was nearing a region of sea surface temperatures less than 78°F (26°C).|$|E

5|$|Screenwriter Gidding, who {{had worked}} with {{director}} Wise on the 1958 film I Want to Live!, began a six-month write of the script after reading the book, which Wise had given to him. He perceived the book to be more about mental breakdown than ghosts, and although he was informed after meeting author Shirley Jackson <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> much a supernatural novel, elements of mental breakdown were introduced into the film. The film was shot at MGM-British Studios in the United Kingdom on a budget of US$1.05 million, with exteriors and the grounds shot at Ettington Park (now the Ettington Park Hotel) in the village of Ettington, Warwickshire. Julie Harris was cast by Wise who found her ideal for the psychologically fragile Eleanor, though during production she suffered from depression and had an uneasy relationship with her co-stars. The interior sets were by Elliot Scott, credited by Wise as instrumental in the making of The Haunting. They were designed to be brightly lit, with no dark corners or recesses, and decorated in a Rococo style; all the rooms had ceilings to create a claustrophobic effect on film. Numerous devices and tricks were used in the filming. Wise used a 30mm anamorphic, wide-angle lens Panavision camera that was not technically ready for use and caused distortions. It was only given to Wise on condition that he sign a memorandum in which he acknowledged that the lens was imperfect. Wise and cinematographer Davis Boulton planned sequences that kept the camera moving, utilizing low-angle takes, and incorporating unusual pans and tracking shots.|$|E

25|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, West Texas was infested with outlaws, {{especially}} near the Rio Grande {{and the international}} border with Mexico. The center for criminal activity {{in the area around}} El Paso was a place known as Pirate Island, a 15,000-acre ait near the present-day town of Fabens that was created when the Rio Grande shifted its course. According to the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo and the International Boundary Commission, the island is part of Texas, but its proximity to the international border meant <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> difficult to police because criminals could easily cross the dry river bed and escape into Mexico.|$|E
25|$|To {{choose an}} example that did not get much {{attention}} in the debate (because it was shared by both sides), the Solow-Swan model assumes a continuously-attained equilibrium with 'full employment' of all resources. Contrary to Keynesian economics, saving determines investment in these models (rather than vice versa). The fact that the critique was also stated entirely using exactly {{the same kind of}} unrealistic assumptions meant <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> difficult to do anything but 'criticize' Solow and Swan. That is, Sraffian models were explicitly divorced from empirical reality.

25|$|A {{problem with}} BBC News output at the time, was <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> much {{fragmented}} with different brands. BBC News bulletins, BBC Breakfast News and BBC News 24 all had separate identities. To solve this, a major relaunch of all BBC News television output, {{with the exception}} of Breakfast News, in 1999 saw the channel adopt a common theme {{with the rest of the}} BBC's main news bulletins. The redesign involved a new cream and red colour scheme together with a large numeral, representing the time of the bulletin on the domestic bulletins, but replaced with '24' for the channel, as well as a variation on the new musical composition by David Lowe.|$|E

Cosby gave the car back to Shelby, who then shipped it out {{to one of his}} company's dealers in San Francisco, S Ford on Van Ness Avenue. S Ford then sold it to customer Tony Maxey. Maxey, suffering the same issues as Cosby did with the car, had his throttle stick while leaving a traffic stop, lost control and drove it off a cliff, landing in the Pacific Ocean waters.|$|E
25|$|John Frere's 1797 {{discovery}} of the Hoxne handaxe helped to initiate the 19th century debate, but it started in earnest around 1810. There were then a number of false starts relating to different European sites. William Buckland misjudged what he had found in 1823 with the misnamed Red Lady of Paviland, and explained away the mammoth remains with the find. He also was dismissive of the Kent's Cavern findings of John MacEnery in the later 1820s. In 1829 Philippe-Charles Schmerling discovered a Neanderthal fossil skull (at Engis). At that point, however, its significance was not recognised, and Rudolf Virchow consistently opposed the theory <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> old. The 1847 book Antiquités Celtiques et Antediluviennes by Boucher de Perthes about Saint-Acheul was found unconvincing in its presentation, until it was reconsidered about a decade later.|$|E

He also said there were times when he and the crew had just three hours of sleep in four days, but however pointed out that he had best hands on deck for the project and he is grateful for that. The film production team on set was made up of about a hundred people; Co-ordinator, Oge Ogu noted that one of the major challenges during filming was co-ordinating and managing the extras to fit into the director's vision, as the crowd often span into hundreds of people.|$|E
25|$|Haughfoot was a hamlet, {{consisting}} {{mainly of}} a staging post for horses and carriages, in the Scottish Borders {{near the village}} of Stow. It was in this unlikely location that a Lodge was founded in 1702 by men who were mainly local landowners. The significance of this Lodge {{lies in the fact that}} none of its members were stonemasons, confirming that modern Freemasonry was fully evolved in Scotland before the appearance of centralised authority in the form of Grand Lodges. The Minute Book of the Lodge, which is extant, commences in 1702 and inside the front covers is the part which is identical to the last portion of the Edinburgh Register House and Airlie MSS. Although not complete (the missing part was almost certainly removed for reasons of secrecy) the Haughfoot fragment is sufficient to confirm <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> likely to have been identical to the two previously mentioned MSS. The 'fragment' was probably retained because the Minute of the first meeting of the Lodge commences immediately after this portion of ritual on the same page.|$|E

But the PBS television series Nova determined that the stones were modern, and located the potter who made them. This potter makes stones daily and sells them to tourists. Von Däniken had visited the potter and examined the stones himself, but he didn't mention this in his book. He says that he didn't believe the potter {{when he said that}} he had made the stones. Von Däniken says that he asked Doctor Cabrera, a local surgeon who owns the museum, and Cabrera had told him that the potter's claims were a lie and that the stones were ancient. But the potter had proof that Cabrera had thanked him for providing the stones for the museum. Von Däniken claimed that the stones at the museum were very different from those made by the potter, but the Nova reporters oversaw the manufacturing of one stone and confirmed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> similar to those in the museum.|$|E

When Brenda's parents are aware of her trip to Mexico with Dylan, the girl's father formally banned her from seeing him again. But she refuses to break and hides her relationship with Dylan.|$|E
25|$|The {{problem with}} this {{approach}} was <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> difficult to focus the electron guns on the ridges without the signal bleeding over to the ridges on either side. This problem was compounded by the changing angle between the gun and the ridges as the signal progressed down the screen. Similar designs were attempted {{by a number of}} researchers, the best known being the Geer tube that used pyramid-shaped patterns with three guns arranged around the back. None of these systems could ever be made to work reliably, with focussing and alignment being continual problems. There is no documentary evidence that a successful version of the three-gun Telechrome tube was ever built, although images of Baird holding a prototype are widely duplicated. The prototype that usually appears is the two-gun tube. The two-gun tube actually had three necks. For this reason, people often mistake this tube for a three-gun prototype. In fact, the third neck is the original neck from the Hewittic envelope. This third neck holds not a gun, but instead, supports for the two-sided target. Burns published a typical photo of the two-gun, three-neck tube.|$|E
