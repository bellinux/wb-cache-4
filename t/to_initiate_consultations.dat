40|$|The FSMA {{appears to}} be a major {{undertaking}} with a very large responsibility placed on the FDA. It would seem that bottlenecks to exporting are bound to appear which will be very frustrating for Canadian firms. It is important for Canadian firms and Canadian policy makers to work hard to ensure that temporary bottlenecks do not become permanent inhibitors of trade. The Canadian government needs to understand industry concerns and use any mechanisms – including those in the NAFTA – <b>to</b> <b>initiate</b> <b>consultations</b> with the US. Given the likely lags in implementation, North American food markets are likely to exhibit considerable disequilibrium over the near term. Trade flows will be affected. As the implementation programs of the FSMA become more transparent, more sophisticated analysis into its effect on Canadian competitiveness in the US market can be undertaken. food, safety, competitiveness, Agribusiness, Agricultural and Food Policy, Food Consumption/Nutrition/Food Safety,...|$|E

The alternative scenarios are the Business-as-Usual scenario (BAU), representing the future trajectory if those who don’t believe in the crisis prevail, and no major policy or lifestyle changes take place; the Economics, Technology and Private Sector scenario (TEC), which could result from policies favoured by those who rely on the market, {{the involvement of the}} private sector and mainly technological solutions, and largely national/local or basin-level action; and the Values and Lifestyles scenario (VAL), that could materialize through a reviv al of human values, strengthened international cooperation, heavy emphasis on education, international mechanisms, international rules, increased solidarity and changes in lifestyles and behaviour. A number of general conclusions are derived...|$|R

The issue of homeless children has come {{to the attention of the}} Office through our Complaints and Investigation function, and has been dealt with on a case by case basis and has been reported to the Oireachtas through previous annual reports.

Using a mixed methods approach including a randomised controlled trial (RCT) and qualitative semi-structured interviews. The overall aims of this thesis were to design an alternative model of care which could be delivered in rheumatology outpatients by clinical nurse specialists (CNS) {{in order to reduce}} the burden of established patients in clinic. This is followed by an evaluation of intervention effectiveness and safety, along with an exploration of the mechanisms of action and patient acceptability. One hundred patients from University College Hospital London (UCLH) with either RA or PsA on methotrexate were recruited into the trial and were followed for six consecutive blood tests. Patients randomised to the intervention group were required to monitor their symptoms, side effects and laboratory results and use this information <b>to</b> <b>initiate</b> care from the CNS. The results indicated that patients were able <b>to</b> accurately <b>initiate</b> a <b>consultation</b> with their nurse on approximately 75...|$|R

30|$|The Politburo, {{which had}} adopted further {{measures}} to ‘popularise’ the Grotewohl Letter in early December 1950, {{was pleased to}} note the stirrings it had caused in Bonn. The SED leadership appeared to believe {{that members of the}} West German government would contact government circles in East Berlin in order <b>to</b> <b>initiate</b> secret <b>consultations.</b> 13 Grotewohl did his best to increase the pressure on Adenauer by penning articles in Neues Deutschland that were critical of the formal reason given by the Bonn government, namely that the Federal Republic of Germany did not have a foreign ministry and was thus unable to enter into direct talks with the German Democratic Republic. He also reined back his Foreign Secretary, Georg Dertinger, who in an interview with a Dutch journalist had indicated a measure of understanding for the West German position (Lemke, 2001 : pp. 136  f.). Grotewohl told all members of his government to refrain from publicly commenting on the question. This ‘gagging order’ was to ensure that the East German party and government leadership would be perceived as a political unit. The Grotewohl Letter was flanked by a missive from Johannes Dieckmann, the President of the People’s Parliament (Volkskammer), to the President of the Federal Parliament (Bundestag), Hermann Ehlers (CDU). 14 The SED did not doubt it would succeed. After talks in Karlshorst, Pieck noted, ‘Bundestag won’t say no’ (Badstübner and Loth, 1994 : p. 361).|$|R
40|$|Purpose - To {{investigate}} {{the ability of}} pharmacy staff in the United Kingdom (UK) to diagnose and treat dry eye. Methods - A mystery shopper technique to simulate a patient with presumed dry eye was used in 50 pharmacy practices in major towns and cities across the UK. Pharmacies were unaware of their involvement in the study. With {{the exception of a}} predetermined opening statement <b>to</b> <b>initiate</b> the <b>consultation,</b> no further information was volunteered. Questions asked, diagnoses given, management strategy advised and staff type was recorded immediately after the consultation. Results - The mean number of questions was 4. 5 (SD 1. 7; range 1 – 10). The most common question was the duration of symptoms (56 %) and the least common was whether the patient had a history of headaches (2 %). All pharmacy staff gave a diagnosis, but the majority were incorrect (58 %), with only 42 % correctly identifying dry eye. Treatment was advised by 92 % of pharmacy staff, with the remaining 8 % advising referral directly to the patient's GP or optometrist. Dry eye treatments involved topical ocular lubrication via eye drops (90 %) and lipid based sprays (10 %). However, only 10 % gave administration advice, 10 % gave dosage advice, 9 % asked about contact lens wear, and none offered follow up although 15 % also advised GP or optometrist referral. Conclusions - There is a need for improved ophthalmological training amongst pharmacists and pharmacy staff and establishment of cross referral relationships between pharmacies and optometry practices...|$|R
40|$|While it {{is undeniable}} that owned {{domestic}} cats Felis catus (Mammalia: Felidae) kill {{large numbers of}} wildlife, it is contentious if this has significant impacts on wildlife populations. Under the precautionary principle such uncertainty does not preclude measures to reduce putative risk, but action should follow <b>consultation</b> with stakeholders. <b>To</b> <b>initiate</b> such <b>consultation</b> for the City of Armadale, Western Australia, we surveyed urban and rural residents to determine their opinions regarding putative impacts of owned cats on wildlife and the acceptability of proposed regulations. Key statements accepted by 70 % or more of respondents, irrespective of their residence, gender or cat ownership status, included: (i) {{there is a need}} to regulate owned domestic cats; (ii) the presence of cats in nature reserves is harmful to wildlife; (iii) cats not owned by licensed breeders should be desexed; and (iv) local councils should be empowered to restrict the maximum number of cats per household. Seventy per cent or more of owners agreed to keep their cats on their property from sunset to sunrise and to register them if these measures became compulsory. All groups except urban men also indicated 70 % or greater willingness to keep their cats on their property constantly if required. However, fewer than 40 % of owners supported empowering local councils to enforce cat-free zones. In this community, cat regulation excluding cat-free zones should enjoy support. Similar approaches should be effective wherever the environmental impacts of owned domestic cats are debated, because compliance with such regulations should be high...|$|R
