5|$|Ten of the {{seventeen}} {{species of}} UK bat are {{found on the}} property, eight within {{the structure of the}} house alone. Species found include the rare and threatened lesser horseshoe bat and greater horseshoe bat. Maintenance work is timed <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> hibernating and mating schedules, and new roosts are created during any building work. Visitors may see some of the property's bats on a closed-circuit television system.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{features}} the Doctor (Matt Smith) stranded on Earth and {{separated from his}} companion Amy Pond (Karen Gillan), when an unknown force prevents his time travelling spaceship, the TARDIS, from landing. To investigate, he moves into the flat of Craig Owens (James Corden) and attempts <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> ordinary humans while unknowingly playing matchmaker for Craig and his good friend Sophie (Daisy Haggard).|$|E
5|$|The site, {{slightly}} expanded {{since the}} fair, {{is now called}} Seattle Center; the United States Science Pavilion is now the Pacific Science Center. Another notable Seattle Center building, the Museum of Pop Culture (earlier called EMP Museum), was built nearly 40years later and designed <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> the fairground atmosphere.|$|E
5000|$|Mrs Rimmer's {{voice has}} been re-dubbed {{with a new}} actress <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> more <b>with</b> the character.|$|R
50|$|Kate Bush {{stated in}} an early {{interview}} that the single version was remixed slightly for inclusion on The Dreaming. The vocals were raised higher and the backing track altered <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> better <b>with</b> the overall feel of the album.|$|R
50|$|Early gas stoves {{were rather}} unwieldy, {{but soon the}} oven was {{integrated}} into the base and the size was reduced <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> better <b>with</b> {{the rest of the}} kitchen furniture. In the 1910s, producers started to enamel their gas stoves for easier cleaning.|$|R
5|$|Environmental {{considerations}} {{taken into}} account when designing the building include the polycarbonate cladding, used for natural light and passive heating; and a hydronic heating and cooling system using the constant temperature of the sea water below the pontoon. As a floating structure, {{it will not be}} affected by rises in the sea level. The gabled roof design is intended <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> the other buildings in Sullivans Cove including PW1, Elizabeth Street Pier and the Mac02 Cruise Terminal– which themselves are based on the historic use of the area as a freight port.|$|E
5|$|Rebuilding work did {{not begin}} in earnest until 1863, when William Gibbs had the {{property}} substantially remodelled in a Gothic Revival style. William Cubitt & Co. were the builders and John Norton was the architect. Norton's design enveloped the original house. He added an extra floor, two new wings and towers. Norton emphasised the importance of architectural continuity in restoration and rebuilding relating to several historical periods. As a result, while some walls remained plain, others were adorned with Gothic and naturalistic carvings <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> the previous architectural styles.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} team's {{approach to}} the character and Eccleston's portrayal were highlighted as being intentionally different from his predecessors, with Eccleston stating that his character would be less eccentric. <b>To</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> a 21st-century audience, the Doctor was given a primary companion, Rose Tyler, who {{was designed to be}} as independent and courageous as himself. He also briefly travels with Adam Mitchell, a self-serving boy genius who acts as a foil to the companions but ultimately proves unworthy, and Jack Harkness, a reformed con man from the 51st century. The Doctor, Rose and Jack form a close team but are separated in the series finale in which each character has to make difficult choices and face sacrifice.|$|E
50|$|Bomber {{has some}} large boots to fill taking over from Chefo, but {{transferring}} to Hammersley {{from a larger}} frigate has given her some strong galley skills and she soon starts <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> well <b>with</b> {{the rest of the}} crew, despite the afore mentioned episode with the Chips!.|$|R
50|$|Perhaps in {{the spirit}} of equality, neither {{character}} is portrayed as particularly sympathetic. Madam is always coming up <b>with</b> silly ideas <b>in</b> order <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> more <b>with</b> the new way of life. Eve meanwhile keeps coming up with ways of obtaining extra cash out of Madam and others.|$|R
25|$|The Huskies went on hiatus in 2001 {{to attempt}} to join the local Western Junior C league <b>to</b> better <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> competition, but again the team was thwarted by the league's {{political}} landscape. Little {{is known about the}} future of the franchise, if there is to be one.|$|R
5|$|<b>To</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> this strategy, the RAF's initial plans {{involved}} launching raids against German shipping {{on receipt}} {{of the results}} of aerial reconnaissance. This was attempted on 3 September, when a Bristol Blenheim (flown by Flying Officer Andrew McPherson of No. 139 Squadron RAF)—on a reconnaissance flight over the North Sea—spotted a large naval force in the Schillig Roads off Wilhelmshaven. The Blenheim's radio failed, however, so an attack could not be launched until McPherson returned to base, when 15 Handley Page Hampdens and nine Vickers Wellington bombers were launched against the German ships. The weather was poor, however, and the bombers failed to find any targets.|$|E
5|$|Usually, {{the episodes}} {{are focused on}} Adam's {{experiences}} at Charles Darwin Middle School due to his inability <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> his anthropomorphic schoolmates, the challenges that he must face (such as the presumed stupidity of his peers, being schooled in subjects of use only to animals, the introductions of new students of odd, dangerous, or fictional species to the school or the misadventures that Adam stumbles into with them, or the common effects of adolescence as they are experienced by zoo animals).|$|E
25|$|Young adults may {{stop taking}} their {{medication}} in order <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> their friends, {{or because they}} lack insight of their illness.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the station}} is {{licensed}} as KBTR-CD, it brands itself on the air as [...] "WBTR 41" [...] <b>to</b> help <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> other stations <b>in</b> the market. To keep other stations from using the WBTR calls (other than in legal IDs), KBTR has registered [...] "WBTR" [...] as a Registered trademark.|$|R
50|$|In 1988, Schuiten & Peeters {{took the}} {{opportunity}} of the second French edition to revise their story, adding more content <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> better <b>with</b> their Les Cités Obscures series that had begun to develop {{in the years since}} the book's first publication, and slightly edited the ending for better continuity and logic to the story.|$|R
5000|$|Born William Michael Cusick to Polish {{immigrants}} in Grays Ferry, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, {{he changed his}} name <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> well <b>with</b> the Irish gangs in Philadelphia. [...] Duffy became involved in petty theft and other misdemeanors during his youth before more serious crimes during his teenage years, including armed robbery and hijacking prior to entering bootlegging during Prohibition.|$|R
25|$|Some people {{modify their}} pubic hair—either <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> {{societal}} trends, or simply {{as an expression}} of their own style or lifestyle.|$|E
25|$|Until 1989, while Communists held {{power in}} the People's Republic of Poland, the Polish–Soviet War was omitted or {{minimized}} in Polish and other Soviet bloc countries' history books, or was presented as a foreign intervention during the Russian Civil War <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> Communist ideology.|$|E
25|$|The General Manager, Colonel Stephens {{and then}} W.H. Austen, was based at Tonbridge. Visits to the EKLR had <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> their {{responsibilities}} for their other light railways. There was an alarming lack (to modern eyes) of on-site {{management at the}} EKLR. Supervision depended on unannounced visits by the General Manager.|$|E
50|$|Scenes {{where an}} actor explores a theater were reused in Wood's later film, Night of the Ghouls, with a voiceover <b>to</b> make it <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> {{the rest of}} the story.|$|R
50|$|His English {{name is not}} a stage name; {{when he was a}} child, {{his mother}} changed his name by deed poll <b>to</b> help him <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> his peers. He was baptised a Catholic.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine and}} gearbox were not left {{untouched}} either. For the 2005 season, engines had to last 2 races. Honda created {{a brand new}} V10 unit, which was smaller, lighter and had a better centre of gravity than the 2004 engine. The gearbox was also an evolution of the 2004 unit, with some modifications to allow it <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> better <b>with</b> the new tight design.|$|R
25|$|The club {{commenced}} playing {{according to}} what was then known as the 'Melbourne rules' (which would later become known as 'Victorian rules' and then Australian rules football). However, in 1876 the club adopted rugby rules, <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> two newly formed football clubs, before reverting to Australian rules football (with occasional rugby matches) in 1879.|$|E
25|$|As Colorado were {{preparing}} to move into Dick's Sporting Goods Park for the 2007 season, the club re-invented themselves again to more closely align with the DNA and color scheme of other KSE teams, changing their colors to burgundy and blue, and creating a brand new shield logo <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> more traditional global soccer marks.|$|E
25|$|On August 23, 2016, Jessie Chung {{released}} her debut English album There You Are. Ditching her usual softer personality, Jessie chose to rock a blonde hairstyle and rebellious obsidian dress <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> the new genre of her album. Future Entertainment & Music Group Australia’s CEO {{appeared at the}} release party to congratulate her.|$|E
5000|$|Although {{she carries}} a {{powerful}} negative energy blaster, she prefers {{to use the}} seismic energy dischargers on her feet to smash the surrounding earth to pieces. Any battlefield on which she walks shudders {{with the force of}} her steps. In the IDW comics, Fracture was given a new design <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> more <b>with</b> the movie's animation style, rather than one resembling her toy.|$|R
50|$|Symptoms of ADHD include inattentiveness, impulsiveness, and hyperactivity. Many of the {{behaviors}} {{that are associated with}} ADHD include poor control over actions resulting in disruptive behavior and academic problems. Another area that is affected by these disorders is the social arena for the person with the disorder. Many children that have this disorder exhibit poor interpersonal relationships and struggle <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> socially <b>with</b> their peers.|$|R
50|$|The temple {{is visible}} from {{many parts of}} the city with its six spires {{reaching}} into the sky. The edges of the building are finished with tiered layers of face brick, immaculately fitted together, giving it an elegance and distinctiveness. A gray slate roof and indigenous quartzite for the temple's perimeter walls and entrance archways, allow the building <b>to</b> suitably <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> the historic buildings nearby.|$|R
25|$|Though Hayworth {{was anxious}} {{to start a new}} life abroad, away from Hollywood, Aly Khan's {{flamboyant}} lifestyle and duties proved too difficult for Hayworth. She struggled <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> his friends, and found it difficult to learn French. Aly Khan was also known in circles as a playboy, and it was suspected that he had been unfaithful to Hayworth during the marriage.|$|E
25|$|His career stalled as his {{professional}} relationship with Brian Clough deteriorated; Clough, it would appear, was {{disturbed by the}} rumours of Justin Fashanu's visits to gay nightclubs and bars. His goals and then confidence dried up as he failed <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> the playing and lifestyle demands of Clough, especially after Clough had discovered his homosexuality and barred him from training with the side.|$|E
25|$|The {{design was}} {{modified}} where necessary to better suit modern manufacturing techniques, and <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> <b>with</b> the modern high speed railway, while retaining {{the greater part}} of the original design. As an evolution of the Peppercorn A1 class, Tornado would also incorporate improvements that would have been made to the class had steam continued, such as correction of the rough riding faults of the original 49 Peppercorn A1s.|$|E
25|$|Another {{occasionally}} quoted {{suggestion is}} that 'Kelantan' derived originally from the Indian 'Kolaan Thana' or 'Kolaam Thana', which meant 'Land of Kolaan' or 'Land of Kolaam', the term 'kolaan' or 'kolaam' referring to the floor paintings/diagrams in the numerous Hindu temples which dotted the land in the very ancient days. 'Kolaan Thana' or 'Kolaam Thana' gradually became 'Kelantan' <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> better <b>with</b> the speaking dialect of the local people.|$|R
50|$|In 1980, Woolworth {{acquired}} the DIY chain B&Q, which {{at its peak}} had 26 stores. In 1982, Both the British Woolworth and B&Q chains were split from the F.W. Woolworth Company into Woolworth Holdings PLC. The company expanded by acquiring the Comet Group in 1984 and then Superdrug in 1987. Woolworth Holdings PLC was renamed Kingfisher Group PLC <b>in</b> 1989, <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> more <b>with</b> the Woolworths name.|$|R
50|$|The Barlow Apartments are an {{historic}} apartment house at 2115 Scott Street in Little Rock, Arkansas. Built in 1921, {{it is an}} early example of a vernacular Craftsman style four-unit apartment block. It is finished in a brick veneer, and has a broad gable roof with exposed rafter ends. It was built for Virgil M. Barlow, and was scaled <b>to</b> <b>fit</b> <b>in</b> well <b>with</b> its single-family residential neighbors.|$|R
