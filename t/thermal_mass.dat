5|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>mass</b> is any {{material}} {{that can be}} used to store heat—heat from the Sun in the case of solar energy. Common <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> materials include stone, cement and water. Historically they have been used in arid climates or warm temperate regions to keep buildings cool by absorbing solar energy during the day and radiating stored heat to the cooler atmosphere at night. However, they can be used in cold temperate areas to maintain warmth as well. The size and placement of <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> depend on several factors such as climate, daylighting and shading conditions. When properly incorporated, <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> maintains space temperatures in a comfortable range and reduces the need for auxiliary heating and cooling equipment.|$|E
5|$|A solar chimney (or thermal chimney, in this context) is {{a passive}} solar {{ventilation}} system {{composed of a}} vertical shaft connecting the interior and exterior of a building. As the chimney warms, the air inside is heated causing an updraft that pulls air through the building. Performance can be improved by using glazing and <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> materials {{in a way that}} mimics greenhouses.|$|E
5|$|It is an {{important}} source of renewable energy and its technologies are broadly characterized as either passive solar or active solar depending on how they capture and distribute solar energy or convert it into solar power. Active solar techniques include the use of photovoltaic systems, concentrated solar power and solar water heating to harness the energy. Passive solar techniques include orienting a building to the Sun, selecting materials with favorable <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> or light-dispersing properties, and designing spaces that naturally circulate air.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the validity of}} using <b>thermal</b> <b>masses</b> in the kinematics of final states in the decay rate of heavy neutrinos in leptogenesis calculations. We find that using <b>thermal</b> <b>masses</b> this way is a reasonable approximation, but corrections arise through quantum statistical distribution functions and leptonic quasiparticles.

40|$|The {{pressure}} {{of a system}} in thermal equilibrium is expressed as a mass integral over a sum of thermal propagators. This allows a Dyson resummation and is used to demonstrate that potential infrared divergences are rendered harmless. The perturbative treatment of finite-temperature quantum field theories involving massless bosonic fields always faces infrared divergences starting at a certain loop order. In {{the case of the}} partition function or pressure, these set in at three-loop order in four-dimensional theories. One relatively harmless class of these infrared divergences {{has to do with the}} appearance of <b>thermal</b> <b>masses.</b> Repeated self-energy insertions in a closed loop give rise to arbitrarily high powers of products of these <b>thermal</b> <b>masses</b> and massless propagators all with the same momentum. However, once these <b>thermal</b> <b>masses</b> are resummed into the propagators, such infrared divergences are avoided. As a remnant, the resummed perturbative series is found to be nonanalytic in the conventional loop expansion parameter — instead of being organized in, say, powers of coupling constant squared, the series then involves single powers and logarithms of the coupling...|$|R

5|$|The common {{features}} of passive solar architecture are orientation {{relative to the}} Sun, compact proportion (a low surface area to volume ratio), selective shading (overhangs) and <b>thermal</b> <b>mass.</b> When these features are tailored to the local climate and environment they can produce well-lit spaces that stay in a comfortable temperature range. Socrates' Megaron House {{is a classic example}} of passive solar design. The most recent approaches to solar design use computer modeling tying together solar lighting, heating and ventilation systems in an integrated solar design package. Active solar equipment such as pumps, fans and switchable windows can complement passive design and improve system performance.|$|E
25|$|Short-term storage. <b>Thermal</b> <b>mass</b> {{materials}} store {{solar energy}} {{during the day}} and release this energy during cooler periods. Common <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> materials include stone, concrete, and water. The proportion and placement of <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> should consider several factors such as climate, daylighting, and shading conditions. When properly incorporated, <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> can passively maintain comfortable temperatures while reducing energy consumption.|$|E
25|$|Another {{trick is}} to cool the {{building}}'s <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> at night, and then cool the building from the <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> during the day. It helps {{to be able to}} route cold air from a sky-facing radiator (perhaps an air heating solar collector with an alternate purpose) or evaporative cooler directly through the <b>thermal</b> <b>mass.</b> On clear nights, even in tropical areas, sky facing radiators can cool below freezing.|$|E

25|$|A Trombe wall is {{a passive}} solar heating and {{ventilation}} system consisting of an air channel sandwiched between a window and a sun-facing <b>thermal</b> <b>mass.</b> During the ventilation cycle, sunlight stores heat in the <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> and warms the air channel causing circulation through vents {{at the top and}} bottom of the wall. During the heating cycle the Trombe wall radiates stored heat.|$|E
25|$|Once in place, {{concrete}} offers great {{energy efficiency}} over {{the lifetime of}} a building. Concrete walls leak air far less than those made of wood frames. Air leakage accounts for {{a large percentage of}} energy loss from a home. The <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> properties of concrete increase the efficiency of both residential and commercial buildings. By storing and releasing the energy needed for heating or cooling, concrete's <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> delivers year-round benefits by reducing temperature swings inside and minimizing heating and cooling costs. While insulation reduces energy loss through the building envelope, <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> uses walls to store and release energy. Modern concrete wall systems use both external insulation and <b>thermal</b> <b>mass</b> to create an energy-efficient building. Insulating concrete forms (ICFs) are hollow blocks or panels made of either insulating foam or rastra that are stacked to form the shape of the walls of a building and then filled with reinforced concrete to create the structure.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} of the chimney and the fireplace allowed for more effective exhaustion of the smoke.

25|$|The key to {{designing}} a passive solar building is to best {{take advantage of}} the local climate.

25|$|Because of {{the design}} {{challenges}} and sensitivity to a site that are required to efficiently meet the energy needs of a building and occupants with renewable energy (solar, wind, geothermal, etc.), designers must apply holistic design principles, {{and take advantage of}} the free naturally occurring assets available, such as passive solar orientation, natural ventilation, daylighting, <b>thermal</b> <b>mass,</b> and night time cooling.|$|E
