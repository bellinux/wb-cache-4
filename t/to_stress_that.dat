5|$|Wipeout HD was {{developed}} by Sony Studio Liverpool, who had desired to release a game for the PlayStation store <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> <b>that</b> downloadable content was not reserved for smaller games. The game was delayed {{for a few months}} due to reports of it failing epilepsy tests.|$|E
5|$|Bootlegs {{should not}} be {{confused}} with counterfeit or unlicensed recordings, which are merely unauthorised duplicates of officially released recordings, often attempting to resemble the official product as close as possible. Some record companies have considered that any record issued outside of their control, and for which they do not receive payment, to be a counterfeit, which includes bootlegs. However, some bootleggers are keen <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> <b>that</b> the markets for bootleg and counterfeit recordings are different, and a typical consumer for a bootleg will have bought most or all of that artist's official releases anyway.|$|E
5|$|It {{was well}} known in ancient Greece that all the Spartans who {{had been sent to}} Thermopylae had been killed there (with the {{exception}} of Aristodemus and Pantites), and the epitaph exploits the conceit that there was nobody left to bring the news of their deeds back to Sparta. Greek epitaphs often appealed to the passing reader (always called 'stranger') for sympathy, but the epitaph for the dead Spartans at Thermopylae took this convention much further than usual, asking the reader to make a personal journey to Sparta to break the news that the Spartan expeditionary force had been wiped out. The stranger is also asked <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> <b>that</b> the Spartans died 'fulfilling their orders'.|$|E

50|$|An {{issue with}} the bromoil process is that {{inadequate}} rinsing of the chrome salts can lead to discoloration of the prints when exposed to light {{over long periods of}} time. In addition, irregularities in the thickness of the gelatin layer can, under unfavorable conditions, lead <b>to</b> <b>stresses</b> <b>that</b> damage the pictorial (ink) layer.|$|R
25|$|It is {{important}} <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> <b>that</b> Jane Jacobs is providing {{a theory about}} the morality of work, and not all moral ideas. Moral ideas that {{are not included in}} her syndrome are applicable to both syndromes.|$|E
25|$|In an 8-week {{pilot study}} in 2005, loving-kindness {{meditation}} showed reduced pain and anger {{in people with}} chronic lower back pain. Compassion meditation, a Science Daily article states, may benefit by reductions in inflammatory and behavioral responses <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> <b>that</b> {{have been linked to}} depression and a number of medical illnesses.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> <b>that</b> this time reversal violation is {{unrelated to the}} second law of thermodynamics, because due to the conservation of the CPT symmetry, the effect of time reversal is to rename particles as antiparticles and vice versa. Thus the second law of thermodynamics is thought to originate in the initial conditions in the universe.|$|E
30|$|It has <b>to</b> be <b>stressed</b> <b>that</b> {{there is}} no {{correlation}} between the score of periadnexal adhesions and intraluminal damage.|$|R
50|$|Benzodiazepines can be {{prescribed}} <b>to</b> reduce <b>stress</b> <b>that</b> provokes hyperventilation syndrome. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) {{can reduce the}} severity and frequency of hyperventilation episodes.|$|R

25|$|Finally, back in Camelot, Merlin {{looks at}} a candy bar when Emma arrives, and Emma remembers Merlin from their {{encounter}} in the real world. Merlin reminds Emma of his warning not to pull Excalibur, {{in order to protect}} her loved ones, and continues <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> <b>that</b> because of the darkness now within her, it is imperative for her to heed this warning more than ever before.|$|E
25|$|This type of inheritance, {{also known}} as {{maternal}} inheritance, applies to genes encoded by mitochondrial DNA. Because only egg cells contribute mitochondria to the developing embryo, only mothers can pass on mitochondrial DNA conditions to their children. An example {{of this type of}} disorder is Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy. It is important <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> <b>that</b> the vast majority of mitochondrial disease (particularly when symptoms develop in early life) is actually caused by an underlying nuclear gene defect, and most often follows autosomal recessive inheritance.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, Guzmán was now {{in charge}} in New Spain. Among his {{official}} acts was placing plaques bearing the royal coat of arms on the principal buildings of the capital, <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> <b>that</b> sovereignty resided in the king, not in Cortés. He had Pedro de Alvarado arrested for questioning the loyalty of Gonzalo de Salazar. There was already some animosity between Cortés and Guzmán, because the former had been reluctant to recognize the latter as governor of Pánuco. The later events made the two enemies.|$|E
50|$|It needs <b>to</b> be <b>stressed</b> <b>that</b> traditions point <b>to</b> Olufi and Koisetan as the Obas who reigned at Gbongan Ile. Fagbola {{became the}} first ruler in the present Gbongan.|$|R
50|$|The Denholme Clough Fault {{is a small}} fault {{located in}} Denholme, England. The fault is {{approximately}} 500 m long. The fault has produced no appreciable earthquake history, {{but it is still}} subject <b>to</b> <b>stresses</b> <b>that</b> may cause it to slip. The maximum earthquake arising from a slip of this fault has been estimated to be below magnitude 3. The Denholme Clough Fault is part of the Pennine anticline and is partially visible from the surface.|$|R
40|$|Improved {{productivity}} of barley {{in the low}} rainfall environments of southern Australia {{is determined by the}} maintenance of yield and physical grain quality when challenged with environmental stresses. Traits involved in tolerance <b>to</b> <b>stresses,</b> <b>that</b> maximise the capture and efficient use of available moisture, are desirable. The current knowledge of the genetics of adaptive traits, and the genetic resources available to improve the adaptation of barley to the low rainfall environments of southern Australia are discussed...|$|R
25|$|However, recent animal {{research}} has shown a correlation between paternal alcohol exposure and decreased offspring birth weight. Behavioral and cognitive disorders, including difficulties with learning and memory, hyperactivity, and lowered stress tolerance {{have been linked to}} paternal alcohol ingestion. The compromised stress management skills of animals whose male parent was exposed to alcohol are similar to the exaggerated responses <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> <b>that</b> children with Fetal Alcohol Syndrome display because of maternal alcohol use. These birth defects and behavioral disorders were found in cases of both long- and short-term paternal alcohol ingestion. In the same animal study, paternal alcohol exposure was correlated with a significant difference in organ size and the increased risk of the offspring displaying ventricular septal defects (VSD) at birth. VSD has also been correlated with paternal alcohol abuse in humans.|$|E
25|$|On the one hand, a materialist view of {{landscape}} tends to stress how {{it may be}} seen in terms of a set of resources, for example for hunter-gatherers or early farming groups. This leads one to turn, for example, to optimal foraging theory and other economic models for an understanding of how people exploited the landscape 'rationally'. Postprocessualists like to argue that landscapes are always viewed in different ways by different peoples. They reject the 'rational' view of 'landscape-as-a-set-of-resources' as that of our own society and one that is ideologically loaded in its own way, loaded towards ideas of commodity and exploitation found in our own society. They suggest that ancient peoples would have had different views of what was 'real' in that landscape. On the other hand, an exclusively idealist view {{of landscape}} does not work either. Postprocessualists like <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> <b>that</b> such an understanding of landscape was not formed in the abstract—that the way people moved around and used that landscape affected their understanding of it.|$|E

40|$|Producers {{continually}} {{strive for}} high yielding soybeans. The state-wide average yield for Iowa {{is now more}} than 50 bu. /acre. The “yield plateau” reported by many producers does not exist, and is a perception largely brought on by misuse of an oversimplified management system. High yielding soybeans are achieved through improved and targeted management decisions. Improved agronomic decisions for soybeans are critical since soybean is very sensitive <b>to</b> <b>stresses</b> <b>that</b> influence soybean growth, development and yield...|$|R
30|$|It needs <b>to</b> be <b>stressed</b> <b>that</b> in the literature, typically, the {{negative}} {{of the dynamic}} (monetary, concave, or coherent) utility measure is used and referred to as dynamic (monetary, convex, or coherent) risk measure.|$|R
30|$|As a final remark, it is {{important}} <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> out <b>that</b> any sensible evolution within the prevention and removal techniques will necessarily require advances in the wax deposition modelling, to enhance its adequacy and efficiency.|$|R
500|$|Like many Westerners, Borah held agrarian ideals, {{and linked}} {{them with a}} policy of {{isolationism}} and avoiding foreign entanglements he believed had served the nation well. Borah took pains, throughout the battle, <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> <b>that</b> he had opposed the principle of a league before it became a partisan issue; according to McKenna, in Borah's League fight, [...] "of partisanship, jealousy, or personal hostility there is no trace".|$|E
500|$|Wipeout HD was {{developed}} by Liverpudlian developer Sony Studio Liverpool (formerly known as Psygnosis). The studio wanted {{to take advantage of}} the PlayStation 3's rendering capabilities to make the game run in full 1080p and 60 frames per second. In a retrospective interview, director Tony Buckley said that the team made the decision to release the game as a PlayStation Store exclusive title before development, <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> <b>that</b> downloadable content does not have to be focused on [...] "small games".|$|E
500|$|Although Hammill {{has written}} the vast {{majority}} of the songs in the band's catalogue, and all of the lyrics, he is keen <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> <b>that</b> the arrangements of the music comes from all the group's members. In 1976, being interviewed for the Melody Maker, he said that [...] "VDGG is a band, a real band... of course [...] is something special, it releases in individual terms parts of us that wouldn't be aired otherwise. In 2013, he reiterated, [...] "Some people don't think Van der Graaf is a democracy, but believe me, it's entirely democratic, with everyone having very vocal and forceful opinions." ...|$|E
30|$|Finally, {{we would}} like <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> again <b>that</b> {{probably}} no practical materials would {{see the light of}} day if a solution to the prelithiation issue or the exploration of Na-based derivatives is not extensively investigated.|$|R
30|$|Genes {{involved}} in the response to biotic and abiotic stimulus, including heat and pH, were also enriched (Table  1, Fig.  6). Up-regulation of heat stress response genes, such as LRE 1, WSC 1, SGT 2, {{and a variety of}} heat shock proteins, was observed in all samples in response to ethanol. In stress-tolerant S. cerevisiae strains, intracellular trehalose accumulates and heat shock protein genes are continuously induced in response <b>to</b> <b>stresses</b> <b>that</b> damage proteins, including heat, ethanol, osmotic, and oxidative stress (Kitichantaropas et al. 2016).|$|R
5000|$|Similar to B. subtilis and E. coli above, {{exposure}} of the archaeon Haloferax volcanii <b>to</b> <b>stresses</b> <b>that</b> damage DNA cause compaction and reorganization of the nucleoid. [...] Compaction depends on the Mre11-Rad50 protein complex that catalyzes an early step in homologous recombinational repair of double-strand breaks in DNA. Delmas et al. proposed that nucleoid compaction {{is part of a}} DNA damage response that accelerates cell recovery by helping DNA repair proteins to locate targets, and by facilitating the search for intact DNA sequences during homologous recombination.|$|R
500|$|Although {{the story}} takes pains <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> <b>that</b> {{it is merely}} one {{possible}} 'origin story,' it has been widely accepted and adopted into DC continuity, and a central mutilation of a long-running character had to be specially approved by editor Wein. Bolland said that he saw [...] "Judge Death [...] almost a dry run for drawing the Joker." [...] He also recounted that [...] "by the time Alan had finished Watchmen he had fallen out with DC to a certain extent... in the end, he only continued to do Killing Joke as a favour to me." ...|$|E
500|$|Kneale's next {{television}} series was {{a departure from}} his usual style—Kinvig, his sole attempt at writing a sitcom, produced by London Weekend Television and broadcast on ITV {{in the autumn of}} 1981. Although his first out-and-out comedy, Kneale was keen <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> <b>that</b> there had always been elements of humour present throughout his scripts, and some of the press reaction to Kinvig was positive. [...] "If you like the idea of the Hitch-Hiker's Guide but found its realization tiresomely hysterical you may well prefer Kneale's relaxed wit. Cast splendid, direction deft," [...] was The Timess preview of the first episode. However, the series was not a success, although Kneale later remained personally pleased with it.|$|E
500|$|On 31 May 2017, Malaysia Airlines Flight 128, {{operated}} by an Airbus A330-300 9M-MTI to Kuala Lumpur (Malaysia), returned to Melbourne after a passenger attempted {{to enter the}} cockpit, which was prevented by other passengers and the flight crew. The overweight aircraft landed safely, landing on runway 16, 15 minutes after departure. Passengers were not disembarked until about 90 minutes after landing. Malaysia Airlines reported {{that they would like}} <b>to</b> <b>stress</b> <b>that</b> at no point was the aircraft [...] "hijacked". The next day (1 June 2017), police announced the man was a 25 year old Sri Lankan national, who was currently living in the Melbourne suburb of Dandenong on a student visa.|$|E
5000|$|In prokaryotes the DNA genome is {{organized}} in a dynamic structure, the nucleoid, which {{is embedded in}} the cytoplasm.
