5|$|In December 1973, state {{subsidies}} for towns outside the MBTA funding district were halved, {{resulting in the}} MBTA needing to renegotiate subsidies from 14 municipalities. Ultimately Ayer, with just 14 daily commuters, refused <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>its</b> $8200 bill in 1974; Littleton also did not reach an agreement. On March 1, 1975, the line was cut back to South Acton, dropping stops at Ayer, Littleton, and West Acton.|$|E

5|$|Amado Boudou, {{who served}} as {{minister}} of economy during Kirchner's first term and vice president during the second, was suspected of corruption in 2012 case. The Ciccone Calcografica printing company filed for bankruptcy in 2010, but this request was cancelled when businessman Alejandro Vandenbroele bought it. The company received tax breaks <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>its</b> debts, and was selected to print banknotes of the Argentine peso. It is suspected that Vandenbroele is actually a frontman for Boudou, and that he employed his clout as minister of economy to benefit a company that actually belonged to him.|$|E
5|$|A horse tramway {{was built}} in 1880 by Wigan Corporation and leased to a {{succession}} of private companies to operate services to Pemberton, Aspull and towards Standish. Steam tram operation was introduced quickly, but the network always struggled <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>its</b> way and just {{after the start of}} the 20th century Wigan Corporation gradually bought the operating leases and converted the network to electric tramcar operation. However, the network was saddled with a mix of 'standard' gauge and 'narrow' gauge lines, reducing efficiency and increasing costs, and the last of the Wigan Corporation Tramways were closed in 1931 to be replaced by buses which had begun as 'feeder' services to the trams but which had shown themselves to be faster and more flexible. Trolleybuses were operated on a single route from Wigan to Martland Mill from 1925 to 1931.|$|E

5|$|The RPF {{went back}} on the {{offensive}} on 8 February, fighting south from the territory it already held in Rwanda's northern border regions. In contrast to the October 1990 and the 1991–1992 campaigns, the RPF advance in 1993 was met with only weak resistance from the FAR forces. The likely {{reason for this is}} a significant deterioration in morale and military experience in the government forces. The impact of the long running war on the economy, and a heavy devaluation of the Rwandan franc compared to the United States dollar, had left the government unable <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>its</b> soldiers in a timely manner. The armed forces had also expanded rapidly, at one point growing from less than 10,000 troops to almost 30,000 in one year. The new recruits were often poorly disciplined and not battle ready, with a tendency to get drunk and carry out abuse and rapes of civilians.|$|E
5|$|While on Washington's staff, Hamilton {{had become}} {{frustrated}} with the decentralized nature of the wartime Continental Congress, particularly its dependence upon the states for voluntary financial support. Under the Articles of Confederation, Congress had no power to collect taxes or to demand money from the states. This lack of a stable source of funding had {{made it difficult for}} the Continental Army both to obtain its necessary provisions and <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>its</b> soldiers. During the war, and for some time after, Congress obtained what funds it could from subsidies from the King of France, from aid requested from the several states (which were often unable or unwilling to contribute), and from European loans.|$|E
5|$|In 1886, a bill {{to reduce}} the tariff was {{narrowly}} defeated in the House. The tariff issue was emphasized in the Congressional elections that year, and the forces of protectionism increased their numbers in the Congress, but Cleveland continued to advocate tariff reform. As the surplus grew, Cleveland and the reformers called for a tariff for revenue only. His message to Congress in 1887 (quoted at right) highlighted the injustice of taking more money from the people than the government needed <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>its</b> operating expenses. Republicans, as well as protectionist northern Democrats like Samuel J. Randall, believed that American industries would fail without high tariffs, and they continued to fight reform efforts. Roger Q. Mills, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, proposed {{a bill to}} reduce the tariff from about 47% to about 40%. After significant exertions by Cleveland and his allies, the bill passed the House. The Republican Senate failed to come to agreement with the Democratic House, and the bill died in the conference committee. Dispute over the tariff persisted into the 1888 presidential election.|$|E

5|$|The new cruiser {{was laid}} down in 1907 at the Ansaldo {{shipyard}} in Genoa for the Ottoman Empire, under the name Drama. But following {{the rise of the}} Young Turks in the Ottoman Empire, the Ottoman government became unwilling <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>its</b> foreign debts, which led Ansaldo to halt construction work. Work on the ship only resumed in late 1911 when Italy seized the ship following its declaration of war against the Ottoman Empire in the Italo-Turkish War. The completed hull was launched on 11 November 1912, and following the completion of fitting-out work, the new ship was commissioned on 25 March 1913. On 3 September 1914, Libia was in the port of Durazzo, Albania when Prince William, the ruler of the country, departed following turmoil caused by an insurgency in the country, coupled with the outbreak of World War I. Libia had landed a contingent of marines to restore order in the city, where some 2,000 refugees fleeing the insurgents attempted to board passenger ships bound for Italy. After the refugees were evacuated, Libia recalled her marines and departed as well.|$|E
5|$|Days {{after the}} arrival of the RUF, on 2 June, rebels and {{soldiers}} attacked the Mammy Yoko hotel—where around 800 foreign citizens had gathered under the protection of Nigerian soldiers—in response to a Nigerian naval bombardment of Freetown. Penfold was able to see the firefight from the high commission building, and telephoned the Sierra Leonean defence headquarters to demand an end to the violence, threatening to request the deployment of US Marines from the USS Kearsarge, which was anchored offshore. The defence headquarters promptly ordered an end to the shooting, and the occupants of the hotel were evacuated to another nearby hotel for the night and then to the USS Kearsarge the next morning (3 June). In addition, Penfold and the remaining members of his staff (most of the staff and all their families had already left) were ordered to evacuate on the Kearsarge, despite Penfold's objections. The Kearsarge sailed to Conakry, where Kabbah had been staying {{since the beginning of the}} coup. No country recognised the military junta, and the international community continued to recognise the exiled Kabbah government as the legitimate government of Sierra Leone. Kabbah re-established his government in Conakry, basing it in a former Chinese restaurant leased by the British government through Penfold. There, Penfold advised Kabbah on keeping up the government's presence on the international stage, such as by ensuring that a representative was sent to international meetings. He also continued to run the British diplomatic mission in Freetown; the high commission continued <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>its</b> local staff and began smuggling food and money into Sierra Leone. During the ten months in which the Kabbah government was exiled, Penfold—with funds from the British Department for International Development (DfID)—also assisted in the setting up of a covert radio station, which broadcast on behalf of the exiled government.|$|E
5|$|Grant's {{success with}} Britain was {{undermined}} by {{his attempt to}} annex the Dominican Republic, an independent nation unable <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>its</b> debt. Many Americans believed a Caribbean naval base would establish naval dominance and be useful in protecting shipping from piracy in a potential isthmian canal. Anti-imperialist Republicans had previously rejected a Johnson administration treaty to establish a Samaná Bay naval base. Grant took interest in Dominican annexation and sent his secretary, Orville E. Babcock, there to consult with Buenaventura Báez, the pro-annexation Dominican president. Babcock returned in September 1869 with a draft treaty of annexation, although Fish had not given him any diplomatic authority. Given such authority by Fish, Babcock visited the island nation a second time making a treaty for Dominican annexation and the lease of Samaná Bay. The cabinet discussed the treaties at a meeting on December 21. Fish dismissed annexation, seeing the island as politically unstable. Grant supported it, believing acquisition of the majority-black nation would increase commerce, create a refuge for African Americans, and help to exploit the island's natural resources. He lobbied Sumner in hopes of influencing him to help with passage of the treaties. Fish added to the effort out of loyalty to Grant, but to no avail; Sumner was set against annexation and on June 30, 1870, the Senate rejected the treaties. A congressional investigation headed by Senator Carl Schurz revealed speculators had promoted the treaties' passage. Unwilling to admit defeat, Grant convinced Congress to send a commission to investigate. Although the commission approved Grant's call for annexation in its findings, the Senate remained opposed and Grant was forced to abandon further efforts. Grant retaliated by firing Sumner's friend and Minister to Great Britain, John Lothrop Motley, while he pressured the Senate to depose Sumner of his chairmanship.|$|E

5|$|The United Fruit Company {{had been}} formed in 1899 by {{the merger of}} two large American corporations. The new company had major {{holdings}} of land and railroads across Central America, which it used to support its business of exporting bananas. In 1900 it was already the world's largest exporter of bananas. By 1930 it had an operating capital of 215 million US dollars, and had been the largest landowner and employer in Guatemala for several years. Under Manuel Estrada Cabrera and other Guatemalan presidents, the company obtained a series of concessions {{in the country that}} allowed it to massively expand its business. These concessions frequently came at the cost of tax revenue for the Guatemalan government. The company supported Jorge Ubico in the leadership struggle that occurred from 1930 to 1932, and upon assuming power, Ubico expressed willingness to create a new contract with it. This new contract was immensely favorable to the company. It included a 99-year lease to massive tracts of land, exemptions from virtually all taxes, and a guarantee that no other company would receive any competing contract. Under Ubico, the company paid virtually no taxes, which hurt the Guatemalan government's ability to deal with the effects of the Great Depression. Ubico asked the company <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>its</b> workers only 50 cents a day, to prevent other workers from demanding higher wages. The company also virtually owned Puerto Barrios, Guatemala's only port to the Atlantic ocean, allowing the company to make profits from the flow of goods through the port. By 1950, the company's annual profits were 65 million US dollars, twice the revenue of the Guatemalan government.|$|E
