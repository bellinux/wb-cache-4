5|$|Vinícius Segalla from UOL said <b>tax</b> <b>credits</b> and BNDES {{resources}} are public money {{and that the}} concession of those resources to Corinthians are unclear. The federal government dismissed the notion, saying that <b>tax</b> <b>credits</b> are intended to encourage economical growth and work opportunities for the areas surrounding the stadia. The city government said <b>tax</b> <b>credits</b> are not subsidies and the stadium will {{be a boon to}} the city, especially the east zone. They also said subsidies given to the Brazilian Grand Prix and Carnaval among others also bring benefits to the city. Public Prosecutor Marcelo Milani contested the validity of <b>tax</b> <b>credits</b> issued by the city and sued then-mayor Gilberto Kassab for R$1.74billion; the judges said Milani's case was without merit and dismissed it.|$|E

When legislators proposed eliminating business <b>tax</b> <b>credits</b> in late 2009 to help balance the states budget, Marostica publicly defended many of those credits, but he did support limited cuts to <b>tax</b> <b>credits</b> in Governor Ritter's proposed 2010–2011 budget.|$|E

5|$|A new {{contract}} was signed on 19 July 2011 with Odebrecht; R$400million {{of the total}} would be financed by BNDES and the remaining R$420million would come from <b>tax</b> <b>credits</b> granted by the City. A 2007 law stated the <b>tax</b> <b>credits</b> {{could be used by}} any company that established itself in the Eastern region of the city, providing a credit of R$0.60 per R$1.00 invested. A new law was passed by the city legislature to deal specifically with this stadium and reduce the incentives, linking the concession of the credits to hosting the World Cup opening match and limiting the total amount of credits to R$420million. The concession was justified by the expectation that the stadium will generate R$950 million in city taxes during the six years after its opening. R$530 million in excess of the <b>tax</b> <b>credits</b> were given. The financing contract with BNDES was signed on 29 November 2013, under their ProCopas Arenas World Cup program.

5|$|The CSR {{subsidies}} {{are paid to}} insurance companies to reduce copayments and deductibles for a smaller group of ACA enrollees, those earning less than 250% of the federal poverty line (FPL). The second and larger type of subsidy, the premium <b>tax</b> <b>credits</b> designed to reduce the post-subsidy cost of monthly premiums, apply to all enrollees earning less than 400% of the FPL. For scale, during 2017, approximately $7 billion in CSR subsidies will be paid, versus $34 billion for the premium <b>tax</b> <b>credits.</b> A court decision meant that CSR subsidies were treated as discretionary spending, meaning Congress must decide to appropriate funds for them each year. This effectively gave the President the power to end them, as Democrats with a minority in Congress could not appropriate the funds, let alone override his veto of an appropriations bill.|$|E

40|$|To {{what extent}} does a <b>tax</b> <b>credit</b> affect firms' R&D activity? What are the mechanisms? This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} the 2003 Japanese <b>tax</b> <b>credit</b> reform on firms' R&D investment by exploiting cross-sectional variation across firms in the changes in the effective <b>tax</b> <b>credit</b> rate between 2002 and 2003. When we use the benchmark sample to estimate the first-difference equation between 2002 and 2003, our estimate for the elasticity of R&D investment with respect to the effective <b>tax</b> <b>credit</b> rate is 2. 05 % with a standard error of 0. 60, and the estimated effect of the R&D <b>tax</b> <b>credit</b> on R&D investment is significantly larger for small firms with relatively large outstanding debts. When we use different methods and different samples, we find mixed evidence for the positive effect of the R&D <b>tax</b> <b>credit,</b> but an interaction term between the effective <b>tax</b> <b>credit</b> rate and the debt-to-asset ratio is always estimated to be significant for small firms, providing robust evidence for the role of financial constraint in determining {{the effect of the}} R&D <b>tax</b> <b>credit.</b> R&D, <b>Tax</b> <b>Credit,</b> Fnancial Constraint, Japan...|$|R
