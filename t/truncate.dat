40|$|<b>Truncating</b> {{mutations}} in the TTN gene {{are the most}} common genetic cause of dilated cardiomyopathy in adults but their role in young patients is unknown. We studied 82 young dilated cardiomyopathy subjects and found that the prevalence of <b>truncating</b> TTN {{mutations in}} adolescents was similar to adults, but surprisingly few <b>truncating</b> TTN mutations were identified in affected children, including one confirmed de novo variant. In several cases, <b>truncating</b> TTN mutations in children with dilated cardiomyopathy had evidence of additional clinical or genetic risk factors. These findings have implications for genetic testing and suggest that single <b>truncating</b> TTN mutations are insufficient alone to cause pediatric-onset dilated cardiomyopathy...|$|R

40|$|Background: Filamin C (encoded by the FLNC gene) is {{essential}} for sarcomere attachment to the plasmatic membrane. Mutations in FLNC {{have been associated with}} myofibrillar myopathies, and cardiac involvement has been reported in some carriers. Accordingly, since 2012 we have included FLNC in the genetic screening of patients with inherited cardiomyopathies and sudden death. Objective(s) : We aimed to demonstrate the association between <b>truncating</b> mutations in FLNC and the development of high-risk dilated and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies. Methods: FLNC was studied by next-generation sequencing in 2, 877 patients with inherited cardiovascular diseases. We identified a characteristic phenotype in probands with <b>truncating</b> mutations in FLNC. Clinical and genetic evaluation of 28 affected families was performed. Localization of filamin C in cardiac tissue was analysed in patients with <b>truncating</b> FLNC mutations using immunohistochemistry. Results: Twenty-three <b>truncating</b> mutations were identified in 28 probands previously diagnosed with dilated, arrhythmogenic, or restrictive cardiomyopathies. <b>Truncating</b> FLNC mutations were absent in patients with other phenotypes, including 1, 078 individuals with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Fifty-four mutation carriers were identified among 121 screened relatives. The phenotype consisted in left ventricular dilatation (68 %) and systolic dysfunction (46 %), left ventricular myocardial fibrosis (67 %), inferolateral negative T waves and low voltages on ECG (33 %), ventricular arrhythmias (82 %), and frequent sudden cardiac death (40 cases in 21 / 28 families). Clinical skeletal myopathy was not observed. Penetrance was > 97 % in carriers older than 40 years. <b>Truncating</b> mutations in FLNC cosegregated with this phenotype with a dominant inheritance pattern (combined LOD score: 9. 5). Immunohistochemical stainings of myocardial tissue showed no abnormal filamin C aggregates in patients with <b>truncating</b> FLNC mutations. Conclusions: <b>Truncating</b> mutations in FLNC cause an overlapping phenotype of dilated and left dominant arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathies complicated by frequent premature sudden death. Prompt implantation of a cardiac defibrillator should be considered in affected individuals harboring <b>truncating</b> mutations in FLNC...|$|R

40|$|Sequencing {{projects}} have identified {{large numbers of}} rare stop-gain and frameshift variants in the human genome. As {{most of these are}} observed in the heterozygous state, they test a gene's tolerance to haploinsufficiency and dominant loss of function. We analyzed the distribution of <b>truncating</b> variants across 16, 260 autosomal protein coding genes in 11, 546 individuals. We observed 39, 893 <b>truncating</b> variants affecting 12, 062 genes, which significantly differed from an expectation of 12, 916 genes under a model of neutral de novo mutation (p< 10 - 4). Extrapolating this to increasing numbers of sequenced individuals, we estimate that 10. 8 % of human genes do not tolerate heterozygous <b>truncating</b> variants. An additional 10 to 15 % of truncated genes may be rescued by incomplete penetrance or compensatory mutations, or because the <b>truncating</b> variants are of limited functional impact. The study of protein <b>truncating</b> variants delineates the essential genome and, more generally, identifies rare heterozygous variants as an unexplored source of diversity of phenotypic traits and diseases...|$|R
5|$|In 1919 {{when the}} state highway system was first {{numbered}}, the north–south highway through Pontiac was numbered M-10, and it was renumbered to US10 seven years later when the United States Numbered Highway System was created. A number of highway designation and routing changes in the Pontiac were made when US10 was shifted out of downtown to replace M-58 along Telegraph Road west of downtown {{by the middle of}} 1961. Before the change, US10 followed Dixie Highway and Oakland Avenue southeast into Pontiac to Perry Street and then Perry to Woodward while M-58 was routed along Telegraph and Square Lake Roads. After the change, US10 turned south from Dixie Highway onto Telegraph and then east onto Square Lake to connect back to Woodward. The old route through downtown was assigned the Bus. US10 moniker and M-58 was decommissioned as a highway designation. Nine years later, US10 was moved off Woodward Avenue between Pontiac and Detroit to follow the Lodge Freeway and Telegraph Road. Bus. US10 was extended westward along Square Lake Road from the intersection of Woodward Avenue to the junction with Telegraph Road so that it would continue to connect with its parent highway on the southern end. In 1985, the Michigan Department of Transportation received permission from the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials to <b>truncate</b> US10 to Bay City, and when the change was made the following year, US24 replaced US10 on Telegraph Road north of Square Lake Road, and Bus.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Molecular {{diagnostics}} {{can resolve}} locus heterogeneity underlying clinical phenotypes that may otherwise be co-assigned {{as a specific}} syndrome based on shared clinical features, and can associate phenotypically diverse diseases to a single locus through allelic affinity. Here we describe an apparently novel syndrome, likely caused by de novo <b>truncating</b> mutations in ASXL 3, which shares characteristics with Bohring-Opitz syndrome, a disease associated with de novo <b>truncating</b> mutations in ASXL 1. METHODS: We used whole-genome and whole-exome sequencing to interrogate the genomes of four subjects with an undiagnosed syndrome. RESULTS: Using genome-wide sequencing, we identified heterozygous, de novo <b>truncating</b> mutations in ASXL 3, a transcriptional repressor related to ASXL 1, in four unrelated probands. We found that these probands shared similar phenotypes, including severe feeding difficulties, failure to thrive, and neurologic abnormalities with significant developmental delay. Further, they showed less phenotypic overlap with patients who had de novo <b>truncating</b> mutations in ASXL 1. CONCLUSION: We have identified <b>truncating</b> mutations in ASXL 3 as the likely cause of a novel syndrome with phenotypic overlap with Bohring-Opitz syndrome...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Andermann {{syndrome}} (OMIM 218000) is an {{autosomal recessive}} motor-sensory neuropathy associated with developmental and neurodegenerative defects. The cerebral MRI reveals a variable degree of agenesis of the corpus callosum. Recently, <b>truncating</b> mutations of the KCC 3 gene (also known as SLC 12 A 6) {{have been associated}} with Andermann syndrome. METHODS: The authors assessed clinically and genetically three isolated cases from Germany and Turkey with symptoms consistent with Andermann syndrome. RESULTS: The authors detected four novel mutations within the KCC 3 gene in their patients: two different <b>truncating</b> mutations in the first patient, a homozygous <b>truncating</b> mutation in the second, and a homozygous missense mutation in the third patient. In contrast to the classic phenotype of the Andermann syndrome linked to <b>truncating</b> KCC 3 mutations the phenotype and the course of the disease linked to the missense mutation appeared to be different (i. e., showing additional features like diffuse and widespread white matter abnormalities). CONCLUSIONS: Not only <b>truncating</b> but also missense mutations of the KCC 3 gene are associated with Andermann syndrome. Different types of KCC 3 mutations may determine different clinical phenotypes...|$|R

25|$|A {{new view}} is {{developing}} that the regional tectonic boundary is not under Hood Canal, {{but just to}} the west, involving the Saddle Mountain fault zone (discussed below) and associated faults. This is supported by geologically recent scarps and other signs of active faulting on the Saddle Mountain faults, and also discovery of a geophysical lineament running through Pleasant Harbor (south of Brinnon) that appears to <b>truncate</b> strands of the Seattle Fault. In this view Hood Canal is only a syncline (dip) between the Olympic Mountains and the Puget Lowland, and such faults as have been found there are local and discontinuous, ancillary to the main zone of faulting to the west. North of the Seattle Fault accommodation of regional movement may be along the northwest-striking Dabob Bay Fault Zone.|$|E
