In August, Microsoft and IBM partnered {{in the development of a}} different operating system called OS/2. OS/2 was marketed in connection with a new hardware design proprietary to IBM, the PS/2. On February 16, 1986, Microsoft relocated their headquarters to a corporate office campus in Redmond, Washington. Around one month later, on March 13, the company went public with an IPO, raising US$61 million at US$21.00 per share. By the end of the <b>trading</b> <b>day,</b> the price had risen to US$28.00. In 1987, Microsoft eventually released their first version of OS/2 to OEMs. By then the company was the world's largest producer of software for personal computers—ahead of former leader Lotus Development—and published the three most-popular Macintosh business applications. That year the company purchased Forethought, the developer of PowerPoint and Microsoft's first major software acquisition.|$|E

A different scenario is observed for the Eleventh General Election (21 st March 2004), where a positive effect (2.14 %) {{is found in the}} 30 trading day-period before the election. However, the index reversed its upward trend after the election date such that when compared to ordinary <b>trading</b> <b>days,</b> the daily returns were reduced by 0.31, 0.27 and 0.25 % during the first 30, 60 and 90 <b>trading</b> <b>days</b> respectively after the event. It is worth-mentioning that the effect of the Eleventh General Election could last up to 90 <b>trading</b> <b>days,</b> while it only lasted up to 60 trading after the earlier two events. In sharp contrast, the duration of effect for the following two general elections was shortened to 15 <b>trading</b> <b>days</b> only.

Closed-end funds are not considered to be ETFs, even though they are funds and are traded on an exchange. ETFs have been available in the US since 1993 and in Europe since 1999. ETFs traditionally have been index funds, but in 2008 the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission began to authorize the creation of actively managed ETFs.|$|E

At 4pm ET the 'closing bell' is rung and trading for the day stops. There are bells located in each of the four main sections of the NYSE that all ring at the same time once a button is pressed. There are three buttons that control the bells, located on the control panel behind the podium which overlooks the trading floor. The main bell, which is rung at the beginning and end of the <b>trading</b> <b>day,</b> is controlled by a green button. The second button, colored orange, activates a single-stroke bell that is used to signal a moment of silence.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the interday {{stability of the}} price process using transaction data. While {{the vast majority of}} empirical studies on the microstructure of financial markets rests on the tacit assumption that observed prices are generated by a time-invariant price process, we question this assumption by means of a minimum distance estimation framework. Starting from estimates specific for each day's price process, this procedure enables us to work out a common structure across <b>trading</b> <b>days</b> and allows us to disentangle the pecularities of <b>trading</b> <b>days</b> which are marked by certain news events. The determinants of transaction price changes for the BUND future trading at the LIFFE on the basis of 22 subsequent <b>trading</b> <b>days</b> are analyzed. Our empirical findings confirm that <b>trading</b> <b>days</b> do share a common structure to a large extent. However, single event dominated days are likely to show a differing price process. On the one hand, this fact renders pooled parameter estimates inconsistent. On the other hand, this procedure opens an avenue for an in depth analysis of information processing in financial markets. ...|$|R

We show that the frequency, {{as well as the}} magnitude of extreme <b>trading</b> <b>days</b> has increased over time. We also show that the frequency of extreme <b>trading</b> <b>days</b> in a year is positively correlated to the frequency the preceding year and that this behaviour has persisted from 1940 to 2006. Furthermore, we show that aggregate cash flows into equity and bond funds are unrelated to risk measured by SD of return. Our findings show that investors, individuals as well as corporations, use simple passive investment strategies and hence do not believe in market timing or wish to risk capital on capturing far tail or black swan-type returns. ...|$|R
