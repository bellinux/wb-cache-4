50|$|Off-campus {{programs}} {{are an important}} part of the Westmont experience with over 60 percent of students participating in a program at some point in their studies. Westmont offers a number of off-campus programs. These {{programs are}} run with a faculty member and include the Europe semester, England Semester, Westmont in Mexico, Westmont in Istanbul, and the San Francisco Urban program. Some students choose to participate in semester exchanges at one of the colleges in the Christian College Consortium, such as Gordon College, Houghton College, Seattle Pacific University, and Wheaton College (IL). Additionally, many students participate in other qualifying programs, including semesters in New Zealand, Belize, Washington DC, Chile, Italy, France, and Lithuania. Students receive <b>transferable</b> <b>credit</b> while they live and study abroad in these different programs. Some students work in internships while they are off campus, and many choose Washington DC or the San Francisco Urban program for this purpose.|$|E
5000|$|The Virginia <b>transferable</b> <b>credit</b> {{program is}} {{far the largest}} among the States in dollar value of {{property}} conserved. By the end of 2010, $2,512,000,000 of property value had been donated as easements in Virginia for which tax credit was claimed. The qualifying easements cover over 516,000 acre of Virginia landscape. [...] The Virginia program now (2011) grants about $110 million of new tax credit each year. The credit allowance is 40% of the appraised value of the easement donation, so this equates to $275 million of property value donated per year for protection of wildlife habitat, farmland and woodland, and scenic open space—in perpetuity. The other state tax credit programs are smaller in dollar measurement, but are very significant {{in the area and}} the conservation values that they cause to be protected. The concept of state tax credit action (in the absence of a federal tax credit) that Philip Tabas and The Nature Conservancy promoted in the 1990s has borne remarkable fruit, and continues to expand today.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{perceptions}} held by South Korean students who study at the University of Nebraska at Kearney (UNK) of the benefits and values of studying English language. Furthermore, the researcher found what kinds of challenges Korean students encounter both before they come to UNK and after they come to UNK. A sample of UNK Korean students (30 interviewees) was chosen. The researcher used the stratified sampling technique and the semi-structure interviews to collect the data. This study found the following results: (a) South Korean students significantly focus on achieving a high level of English competency; (b) South Korean students especially lack English speaking and writing skills; (c) South Korean students devalue the English educational environment in Korea, but value the English educational environment in America; (d) the majority of the research study’s interviewees decided to come to UNK because of the affordable tuition and the <b>transferable</b> <b>credit</b> hours back to their home universities in Korea; (e) many of the research study’s interviewees felt uncomfortable building relationships with Americans; and (f) no difference was found based on gender or duration of the study abroad program. Recommendations for future research included: 1) developing English speaking skills in Korean students needs more careful; 2) greater attention to how Korean student can build relationships with American cultures and students by American universities needs to be studied; and 3) non-degree seeking students need more international programming to use their limited time in the USA learning English more efficiently.

5000|$|However, {{there are}} {{numerous}} reports from states about constraints placed on incoming transfers because of budget cuts, although the general pattern is that states are working harder to ensure a smoother transition, with transfers of credit, from community colleges to four-year flagship schools. In Virginia, the University of Virginia, which has approximately 14,000 undergraduate students, had 2,434 transfer applications in 2008, and of these, admitted 958, an acceptance rate of 39%. In 2008 in Florida, the University of Florida announced reductions in its transfer class by 33% to cope with budget shortfalls. The picture is similar in Minnesota, with a report that the University of Minnesota is planning to decrease the number of transfer applicants by 8%, meaning that 300 fewer students {{will be able to}} transfer into the state's flagship college, although there is a conflicting report suggesting that enrollment at the state's university is increasing. At Maryland's Bowie State University, transfer applicants apply online, pay a fee of $40, ask their current college to send official transcripts of their coursework, and require a minimum of 24 <b>transferable</b> <b>credits</b> with a minimum grade point average of 2.0. Bowie considers applicants from two-year colleges differently from applicants elsewhere; two-year applicants can transfer a maximum of 65 credit hours, while applicants from four-year colleges can transfer a maximum of 90 credit hours.

40|$|Conservation {{easements}} are a tool landowners can use {{to protect}} their land and preserve it for generations to come. Given the new emphasis society places on preserving the environment, many states have enacted some form of a conservation easement program where landowners who encumber their property with a conservation easement can receive a benefit for doing so. Wisconsin and Virginia are two states {{with this type of}} program. Wisconsin’s conservation easement program allows a landowner to donate his land and the state pays him the difference in the market value. Virginia’s program, on the other hand, allows a landowner to donate a conservation easement with the option of receiving a <b>transferable</b> tax <b>credit</b> in exchange for the donation. To help grow Wisconsin’s program and use it more effectively to protect Wisconsin’s farmland, Wisconsin should adopt a conservation easement program modeled after Virginia’s program where a landowner receives a <b>transferable</b> tax <b>credit</b> in exchange for donating a conservation easement...|$|R
