5|$|At the time, floating-point {{division}} was generally expensive compared to multiplication; <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> inverse square root algorithm bypassed the division step, giving it its performance advantage. Quake III Arena, a first-person shooter video game, used <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> inverse square root algorithm to accelerate graphics computation, but the algorithm {{has since been}} implemented in some dedicated hardware vertex shaders using field-programmable gate arrays (FPGA).|$|E

5|$|Of the A$1.17 billion {{allocated}} to <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> track program, only A$143 million {{was required to}} fix problems where the submarines did not correspond with the original contract: the rest was used to update components that were technologically obsolete and make changes to the submarines beyond the contract specifications. When <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> track program is factored in, the Collins class cost just under 20% more than the inflation-adjusted contract value; a smaller increase than other contemporary defence projects.|$|E

5|$|Van der Aue {{worked on}} {{procedures}} for surface decompression and oxygen {{use in the}} early 1950s and during his research found problems with the 1937 tables for long dive times. He also found that <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> tissues which had been dropped in the 1930s would control decompression in some cases, so he re-introduced <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> compartments to the model, and added an extra slower compartment to better model long-duration dives.|$|E
5|$|Acurad was a {{die casting}} process {{developed}} by General Motors {{in the late}} 1950s and 1960s. The name is an acronym for accurate, reliable, and dense. It was developed to combine a stable fill and directional solidification with <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> cycle times of the traditional die casting process. The process pioneered four breakthrough technologies for die casting: thermal analysis, flow and fill modeling, heat treatable and high integrity die castings, and indirect squeeze casting (explained below).|$|E

5|$|Around 1900, {{there were}} six {{stopping}} trains an hour between Willesden Green and Baker Street. One of these came from Rickmansworth and another from Harrow, the rest started at Willesden Green. There was also a train every two hours from Verney Junction, which stopped at all stations to Harrow, then Willesden Green and Baker Street. The timetable was arranged so that <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> train would leave Willesden Green just before a stopping service and arrived at Baker Street just behind the previous service.|$|E
5|$|By Tuesday, {{the storm}} was rapidly moving across eastern Canada. Without the warm lake waters, it lost power quickly.

5|$|During {{the second}} half of 1998 an {{optically}} thick dust shell obscured Sakurai's Object, causing a rapid decrease in visibility of the star, until in 1999 it disappeared from optical wavelength observations altogether. Infrared observations showed that the dust cloud around the star is primarily carbon in an amorphous form. In 2009 it was discovered that the dust shell is strongly asymmetrical, as a disc with a major axis oriented at an angle of 134°, and inclination of around 75°. The disc is thought to be growing more opaque due to <b>the</b> <b>fast</b> spectral evolution of the source towards lower temperatures.|$|E
