5|$|The train {{arrives in}} New Year 1932 with the {{survivors}} going their separate ways: Jacuzzi and Nice escape custody {{and go into}} hiding after their base of operations in Chicago {{was taken over by}} the Russo family; information gatherer Rachel returns to the Daily Days mostly unscathed; Isaac and Miria introduce Czes to the Martillo family and is subsequently adopted by Firo and Ennis, who later marry, as the latter's brother; and Claire begins his mission to exterminate the enemies of his adoptive brothers, with his intentions to find Chane and marry her after <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> <b>done.</b>|$|E
25|$|Because R. romandi nests {{can often}} be found on buildings, {{it is common for}} wasp nests to be built in heavily human {{populated}} areas. Their nests do not cause any structural damage, so if the nests are located in out of the way areas, they are best left alone. Attempting to knock them down will induce the aggressive behavior described above, and R. romandi tend to rebuild nests in similar spots. Additionally, paper wasps feed their young on caterpillars, so they can help eliminate common garden and agricultural pests. If one does {{have to get rid of}} a nest, it is recommended that <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> by a professional exterminator, or with a fast acting can of insecticide. The best time to get rid of an R. romandi nest is at dawn or after dark when the wasps are most docile.|$|E

60|$|Whether {{there may}} be an {{attraction}} in two such moving bodies out at sea, which may help accident to bring them into collision? Thoughts, too, arise (the voice never silent all the while, but marvellously suggestive) of the gulf below; of the strange, unfruitful mountain ranges and deep valleys over which we are passing; of monstrous fish midway; of the ship's suddenly altering her course on her own account, and with a wild plunge settling down, and making THAT voyage with a crew of dead discoverers. Now, too, one recalls an almost universal tendency on the part of passengers to stumble, at some time or other in the day, on the topic of a certain large steamer making this same run, which was lost at sea, and never heard of more. Everybody has seemed under a spell, compelling approach to the threshold of the grim subject, stoppage, discomfiture, and pretence of never having been near it. The boatswain's whistle sounds! A change in the wind, hoarse orders issuing, and the watch very busy. Sails come crashing home overhead, ropes (that seem all knot) ditto; every man engaged appears to have twenty feet, with twenty times the average amount of stamping power in each. Gradually the noise slackens, the hoarse cries die away, the boatswain's whistle softens into the soothing and contented notes, which rather reluctantly admit that <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> <b>done</b> for the time, and the voice sets in again.|$|E

Unless the wind freshens a good deal we sha'n't be there {{for three or four}} days, but I fancy, from the look of the sky, that it will blow up before morning, and, as likely as not, we shall get more than we want by evening. There is {{generally}} a cruiser or two off the mouth of the river. In a light wind we can show them our heels easily enough, but if it is blowing at all their weight tells. I am glad to be at sea again, lad, after being cooped up in that cursed prison for two years. It seems to make a new man of one. I don't know but that I am sorry I shot that fellow. I don't say that he didn't deserve it, for he did; but I don't see it quite so strongly as I did when I was living on bread and water, and with nothing to do but to think of how I could get even with him when I got out; besides, I never calculated upon getting anyone else into a mess, and I am downright sorry that I got you into one, Mr. Wyatt. However, <b>the</b> <b>job</b> <b>is</b> <b>done,</b> and it is no use crying over spilt milk." ...|$|E
