5|$|A {{road in the}} {{location}} of PA284 first shows on maps as early as 1873. PA284 was first designated along its current alignment during the 1928 renumbering of state highways in Pennsylvania. The designation was done as a spur to <b>the</b> <b>alignment</b> of PA84, which was designated from Piatt Township to the New York state line. The entire alignment of PA284 was paved by the Pennsylvania Department of Highways in 1932, including the bridge over Flooks Run and Blacks Creek. However, <b>the</b> <b>alignment</b> has remained relatively unchanged since. In 1961, with the designation of Interstate 84, <b>the</b> <b>alignment</b> of PA84 was re-designated as PA287 to avoid duplication.|$|E

5|$|The current {{alignment}} of PA378 was first constructed from West Broad Street in Bethlehem {{to the current}} interchange with the Lehigh Valley Thruway. As part of the Interstate Highway System, the Lehigh Valley Thruway was cosigned as <b>the</b> <b>alignment</b> of I-78. Upon completion of the freeway in 1968, the new highway was designated I-378, a spur off of I-78.

5|$|A {{multiple}} sequence alignment (MSA) is {{a sequence}} alignment {{of three or}} more biological sequences, generally protein, DNA, or RNA. In many cases, the input set of query sequences are assumed to have an evolutionary relationship by which they share a lineage and are descended from a common ancestor. From the resulting MSA, sequence homology can be inferred and phylogenetic analysis can be conducted to assess the sequences' shared evolutionary origins. Visual depictions of <b>the</b> <b>alignment</b> as in the image at right illustrate mutation events such as point mutations (single amino acid or nucleotide changes) that appear as differing characters in a single alignment column, and insertion or deletion mutations (indels or gaps) that appear as hyphens {{in one or more}} of the sequences in <b>the</b> <b>alignment.</b> Multiple sequence alignment is often used to assess sequence conservation of protein domains, tertiary and secondary structures, and even individual amino acids or nucleotides.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{mechanism}} for <b>the</b> initial <b>alignment</b> of low-cost INS aided by GPS. For low-cost INS, <b>the</b> initial <b>alignment</b> {{is still a}} challenging issue {{because of the high}} noises of the low-cost inertial sensors. In this paper, a two-stage Kalman Filtering mechanism is proposed for <b>the</b> initial <b>alignment</b> of low-cost INS. The first stage is designed for <b>the</b> coarse <b>alignment.</b> To solve <b>the</b> problems encountered by <b>the</b> general coarse <b>alignment</b> approach, an INS error dynamics accounting for unknown initial heading error is developed, and the corresponding observation equation taking into account the unknown heading error is also developed. The second stage is designed for <b>the</b> fine <b>alignment,</b> where <b>the</b> classical INS error dynamics based on small attitude error is used. Experimental results have indicated that <b>the</b> proposed <b>alignment</b> approach can complete <b>the</b> initial <b>alignment</b> more quickly and more accurately compared with the conventional approach...|$|R

5|$|New Jersey Route 163 {{originated}} as an {{alignment of}} U.S. Route 46 (co-signed with New Jersey State Highway Route 6). <b>The</b> <b>alignment</b> of 6 and 46 went along <b>the</b> <b>alignment</b> {{of the original}} State Highway Route 5 from the early 1920s, stretching from Newark to the bridge over the Delaware River at Delaware. The route was decommissioned when the 1927 renumbering occurred. After that renumbering, the route became State Highway Route 6, a co-designation to U.S. Route 46, which had been assigned the prior year. The two highway designations remained intact until the 1953 renumbering, when Route 6 was decommissioned in favor of using the U.S. 46 designation. U.S. Route 46 was realigned once again when the Portland-Columbia Toll Bridge opened in 1953, when <b>the</b> <b>alignment</b> of the highway was changed to head along former State Highway Route 8 (mostly New Jersey Route 94), where it ended at U.S. Route 611 and NJ 94, where its current terminus is located. After the realigning of the Delaware Bridge alignment, the route was renumbered to New Jersey Route 163. Two years later, the Delaware Bridge was swept away in floods caused by Hurricane Connie and Diane in 1955, which took out several other bridges over the Delaware.|$|E

5|$|PA 263 {{follows a}} part of <b>the</b> <b>alignment</b> of Old York Road, which was laid out in 1711.

5|$|Route64 was {{designated}} originally as an alignment of Route31A, a spur off of State Highway Route31 (currently U.S. Route206) from Princeton eastward to Hightstown, where it met State Highway Route33. The state planned on turning <b>the</b> <b>alignment</b> into a full-fledged expressway for several decades, including constructing <b>the</b> <b>alignment</b> that Route 64 currently uses in 1939. The route was amended in 1941, and was renumbered from Route31A to Route64 in the 1953 renumbering. Route 64 was proposed {{to become part}} of the PrincetonHightstown Bypass (later designated New Jersey Route92), but completion never occurred. Currently, the route remains the bridge over the Northeast Corridor. However, it is not currently planned that Route64 will receive an extension of sorts from the proposed Penns Neck Bypass to U.S. Route1, a proposed realignment of County routes 526 and 571.|$|E
40|$|A yukata {{is a type}} of {{traditional}} Japanese kimono. An alignment of its texture pattern is an important factor of the yukata design. There are rules in <b>the</b> texture <b>alignment</b> of <b>the</b> yukata. The rules are comparratively simple. However, <b>the</b> texture <b>alignment</b> is difficult for the designer because <b>the</b> texture <b>alignment</b> should be performed with consideration to the rules and the wearer's taste, Additioanlly, it is necessary for the designer to create the cutting pattern from a limited length of the kimono cloth. Consequently, a design support system for the yukata is required. We have developed the image processing algorithm to simulate the condition of <b>the</b> texture <b>alignment.</b> It becomes possible to perform <b>the</b> texture <b>alignment</b> based on <b>the</b> traditioonal rule automatically. However, some cutting pattern becomes over length of a standard kimono cloth. In this paper, we describe a multi-agent system for supporting <b>the</b> texture <b>alignment</b> of <b>the</b> yukata. We developed texture alignment agents, and a management agent. The management agent acts management of the wearer's body sizes, the condition of <b>the</b> texture <b>alignment</b> and <b>the</b> cutting pattern and orders to <b>the</b> texture <b>alignment</b> agents to carry out <b>the</b> texture <b>alignment</b> according to <b>the</b> wearer's taste.
