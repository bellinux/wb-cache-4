The sintered parts are then infiltrated with Si in vacuum without distortions. The sintering process is brought about by the transient formation of different Si-base phases and by partial crushing and dissolution of the SiC grains. The final porosity of the Si/SiC-parts is below 1 per cent. Their mechanical and thermal properties (as density, bending strength, Young's modulus, thermal conductivity, thermal expansion coefficient) can be controlled via Si-content. They are slightly below those of conventional Si/SiC-ceramics.

40|$|The thesis {{examines}} the <b>technical</b> aspects of <b>ceramics</b> and glazes from Akhsiket, a regional {{capital in the}} early Islamic period, which was abandoned in the early 13 th century. Ceramics and glazes of the time period under discussion (9 th - 13 th century) in Uzbekistan are understudied, with minimal scientific analysis of the technological processes. These processes include the forming and firing of ceramic vessels, the origin of raw materials used in ceramics and glazes, and decoration methods such as slip painting and colored glazes. A variety of commonly-seen ceramic types have been studied, giving a well-rounded picture of the ceramic assemblage at Akhsiket. Comparison between ceramics from different sites in Uzbekistan, {{and the development of}} the technology over four centuries, is possible with the use of chemical and petrographical data obtained with a variety of scientific techniques - primarily the scanning electron microscope. Contemporary glazed ceramics from Kuva and Tashkent, both in Uzbekistan, were also examined for comparison, and to shed light on the transfer of technological and artistic techniques through Central Asia. Typological analysis of Islamic ceramics shows a progression of artistic and technological knowledge from the Middle East to Central Asia during the Arab expansion in the 8 th – 9 th centuries. Data from chemical and petrographical analysis has shown interesting similarities and differences between ceramic pastes and glazes used at Akhsiket, Kuva and Tashkent. These analyses are used as evidence for relationships in ceramic production and technology in Uzbekistan and by comparison with published data, to ceramics further afield. Along with providing a clearer picture of ceramic production in Uzbekistan, this work provides a new dimension to the discipline of Islamic ceramic studies, demonstrating the importance of archaeological ceramics of the eastern fringes {{to the understanding of the}} production of ceramics and the transmission of knowledge and cultural traditions within the Islamic caliphate. ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1915, the Design and Industries Association (DIA) was established, a {{national}} non government-funded organisation that {{set out to}} establish stronger relationships between British designers and manufacturers. The Head Master at Brighton, William H Bond, {{played an important role}} in promoting the aims of the DIA in the town, explaining how Britain lagged behind her competitors such as Germany and America, claiming that the typographer [...] "Edward Johnston was far better known in Germany than he was in England five years ago". [...] During World War I the School of Art provided opportunities for a number of disabled soldiers at the Brighton Pavilion Hospital, offering training for such occupations as letter cutting in wood and stone, mechanical draughtsmanship, die-cutting and other related subjects that required instruction in industrial arts. Bond was also concerned with the appearance of Brighton, reacting negatively to many aspects of the urban environment, a theme that a number of his British arts and crafts antecedents such as John Ruskin and William Morris had pursued with zeal. Bond complained about the ‘gruesome horror’ of the New England Road railway arch and commented on plans to render it an ‘attractive entrance to the town’. He also argued for the preservation of the ‘distinctive soul’ of Georgian Brighton (cf Georgian Architecture)and that the Town Council should desist from painting the Royal Pavilion ‘workhouse yellow’ as it represented the ‘last despairing cry of colour on its deathbed, and in its raucous tones some devilish influences might be traced’. The work of Brighton School of Art performed well in the international arena. The Daily Telegraph reported that at the 1925 Paris Exposition Internationale des Arts Décoratifs et Industriels Modernes, it received a Diploma of Honour for technical instruction, a Gold Medal for <b>technical</b> instruction in <b>ceramics,</b> and Silver Medals for technical instruction in textiles and metal.|$|R
40|$|A ceramic {{installation}} {{within a}} museum context which developed {{ideas about the}} overlap between archaeology and psychoanalysis by exploring the relevance of archaic objects to a contemporary artist and {{the significance of the}} emotional attachment that humans project onto objects. This project engages with current debates within both the broad spectrum of visual culture and, more specifically, the discipline of ceramics, about the relationship between the artist and the museum and the use of installation within the discipline. Brown’s response to the everyday nature and intimate scale of the Petrie Museum’s collection of Egyptian artefacts resulted in an installation of small-scale clay figures placed on everyday kitchen chairs surrounded by grave goods which were inspired by contemporary amulets such as teddy bears and mobile phones. These comprised 8 ceramic figures on chairs, 300 ceramic, wax, faience and bronze amulets. These were accompanied by a group of appropriate Egyptian artefacts in order to emphasise the continuity between past and present. Brown visited the collection regularly for two years making records through drawing and note-taking prior to making the artworks. Through this methodology she developed a conceptual approach to the representation and presentation of her ideas through casting processes and installation. The Petrie Museum is a key international research resource and Brown’s project is one of several artists’ responses to this unique collection. Others include Mark Karasick, Magdalene Odundo and Sarah Beddington. Brown’s Collective Traces project was supported by an AHRC grant (£ 5000). It was subsequently adapted for the Egyptian galleries at the Manchester Museum in an intervention entitled ‘After Life’, where it will remain until 2009. The catalogue text for ‘Collective Traces’ was written by curator and former Egyptologist, James Putnam, who was a key speaker at the well-attended seminar held during the exhibition. Brown’s paper from this event was published in the Australian magazine <b>Ceramics</b> <b>Technical</b> (No 23, 2006), thereby establishing the research in an international context...|$|R
