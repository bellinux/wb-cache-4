After the war, <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> of the 442nd continued to be lauded, with the 1951 film Go for Broke! portraying their endeavors. By contrast, the activities of the Filipino Infantry Regiment and her sister units were largely unpublicized; {{it was not until the}} documentaries Unsung Heroes and An UnTold Triumph that any significant visual media covered the history of the Regiment. In 1984 an association of veterans of the Regiment erected a marker in Salinas in honor of their former unit.|$|E

Moreover, an attempt is made to analyze the impact of project type on <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> distribution by comparing <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> profiles of web-based projects with non-web-based projects...|$|R
