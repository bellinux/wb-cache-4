It also identified the challenges faced by SMEs with regard to e-commerce use. A survey design was adopted {{in the form of a}} structured questionnaire, which was used to collect data from a sample of 145 SMEs.

Findings revealed that the point of sale system was the most widely used e-commerce technology and the major reason for e-commerce technology adoption was competitive advantage. The main challenge faced by the firms in their use of e-commerce technologies was threat to security. The results clearly indicate the necessity to provide support to SMEs if they are to successfully adopt and use e-commerce. The results have implications not only for managers of SMEs but also for government bodies in developing countries such as Botswana...|$|R

The player, as the Hero, is tasked by the Time Goddess to become powerful enough in 30 seconds to find and defeat an enemy boss that is seeking to cast a spell of destruction that will end the world in 30 seconds. To do so, the Hero explores an overworld, encountering random monsters with battles that take place automatically based on the Hero's current equipment to gain experience levels. The Hero can enter towns where the Time Goddess will pause time, allowing for time to shop for equipment and health items, talk to residents and find allies to help in battle, as well to pay money to a statue of the Goddess to reset the countdown timer to 30 seconds.

A conceptual model derived from the literature review was used to guide this study.

Quantitative methods were then used to analyse the data. Results of the regression analysis confirmed four out of six research propositions made. Compliance with data policies and regulations, data stewardship and ownership were not found to be significant predictors of data governance. However, data modeling, data integration and data quality are necessary in order to achieve improved data governance.

The framework developed as part of this work makes use of a modular design to include a detailed assessment of a wind farm’s layout including validated analytic wake modeling, cost assessment, and the design of the necessary electrical infrastructure considering constraints. This study has found that both algorithms are capable of optimizing the layout with respect to levelized cost of energy when using a detailed, complex evaluation function. Both are also capable of identifying layouts with lower levelized costs of energy than similar studies that have been published in the past and are therefore both applicable to this problem.
