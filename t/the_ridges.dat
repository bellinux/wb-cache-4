5|$|When {{continental}} glaciers {{moved over}} the Rove Formation area, the ice was a hundreds of meters thick and its surface sloped gently southward from the Patrician center to the north. The {{base of the}} ice sheet encountered the cuesta topography relief {{of a few hundred}} feet. Because the ice over the valleys would be thicker than the ice over <b>the</b> <b>ridges,</b> obstructed extrusion flow would operate and resulted in the removal of the easily quarried slates of the valleys. <b>The</b> <b>ridges</b> would not be appreciably eroded, partly because the ice would be thinner over <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> and therefore less plastic, and partly because of the resistance of the diabase to both quarrying and abrasion by the ice.|$|E
5|$|The bedrock {{is exposed}} on <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> in the Black Creek watershed. The {{exposure}} {{is due to}} glaciofluvial deposits disappearing due to erosion and mining. There are many faults in the watershed's rocks.|$|E
5|$|Acting on Almond's instruction, Smith {{ordered the}} 5th Marines to attack west toward Mupyong-ni on 27 November. The attack was soon stalled by the PVA 89th Division {{and forced the}} Marines to dig in on <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> {{surrounding}} Yudam-ni. As night came, three Chinese regiments of the 79th Division attacked <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> on the north and northwest of Yudam-ni, hoping to annihilate the garrison in one stroke. Close range fighting soon developed as the attackers infiltrated Marine positions, but the 5th and 7th Marines held the line while inflicting heavy casualties to the Chinese. As day broke on 28 November, the Chinese forces and the American defenders were locked in a stalemate around the Yudam-ni perimeter.|$|E
50|$|The shoal {{consists}} of four geologic ridges: <b>the</b> north <b>ridge,</b> <b>the</b> central <b>ridge,</b> <b>the</b> halfway <b>ridge,</b> and <b>the</b> south <b>ridge.</b> <b>The</b> north <b>ridge</b> is a subtle but distinct rise across the northern portion of the shoal; <b>the</b> central <b>ridge</b> {{consists of}} a few high peaks in the eastern-center of the shoal; <b>the</b> halfway <b>ridge</b> is <b>the</b> largest <b>ridge</b> and stretches in an arc {{from east to west}} across the entire feature; <b>the</b> south <b>ridge</b> is made up of two associated basalt rises on the southern edge of the formation. The Isle Royale Fault creates a gorge between <b>the</b> north <b>ridge</b> and <b>the</b> other three <b>ridges.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>ridge</b> reached <b>the</b> {{public eye}} in 1997, when a tunnel being dug through <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> caused fishes in the streams {{to die and}} cows grazing on <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> to become paralyzed. The reason was a {{substance}} containing the poisonous substance acrylamide used by the digging company to counteract a surprising high level of groundwater in <b>the</b> <b>ridge.</b>|$|R
5000|$|No wells {{have been}} drilled on <b>the</b> <b>ridge.</b> Samples of <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> from <b>the</b> Afanasy Nikitin Seamount were ultramafic dunite. Seismic {{studies have shown}} that the {{morphology}} of <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> including its depth of occurrence varies along <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> track and that in general <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> has been buried beneath sediments deposited since <b>the</b> Oligocene. <b>The</b> <b>ridge</b> is associated with complicated gravity and magnetic signatures. The northern part of <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> is buried beneath thick sediments of the Bengal Fan and shows a negative gravity anomaly. <b>Ridge</b> structures in <b>the</b> south occasionally rise above the sea floor and are associated with a positive gravity anomaly. The magnetic signatures associated with <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> are complex, with alternate stripes of strong positive and negative anomalies. Magnetic modelling of <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> suggests that it was emplaced over a period of rapid geomagnetic reversals whereas the underlying oceanic crust was formed in a normal magnetic field of the Cretaceous normal superchron or [...] "Cretaceous quiet period". The correlation of the magnetization pattern of <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> and <b>the</b> geomagnetic polarity timescale suggests that the volcanism that created <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> started ~80 Ma (magnetic chron time 33r) in the Mahanadi Basin and the process continued southwards, ending at ~55 Ma near the Afanasy Nikitin Seamount. There are several proposals to explain the origin and development of <b>the</b> <b>ridge,</b> one of which is that the volcanism was caused by a short-lived hotspot.|$|R
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{operations}} of 21–23 August, the frontline had been established to the east of the Albert-Arras railway line with all but one of <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> to the south and west of Bapaume held by IV Corps. However, the 5th Division had been unsuccessful in its attacks which left the ridge running from Loupart Wood to Grévillers and then onto Biefvillers still {{in the hands of the}} Germans. Although over 2,000 prisoners of war had been taken during this period along with 25 field guns, the 5th Division had suffered 1,600 casualties by this stage of the battle.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the NK 6th Division {{had made}} {{breakthroughs}} in the US 24th Infantry sector to the south, overwhelming the regiment and forcing it back. The 2nd Battalion, 24th Infantry, on <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> overlooking Haman, was pushed back as its soldiers retreated without orders. Survivors from the 24th Infantry's 1st and 2nd battalions later {{appeared in the}} 35th's lines, and the regimental commanders found that the entire regiment had crumbled under North Korean attack. Kean ordered the 1st Battalion, 27th Infantry to move in and help restore the 24th's position.|$|E
5|$|Morchella snyderi can be {{distinguished}} from similar North American morels by differences in ecological and morphological features. M.frustrata resembles young specimens of M.snyderi, but <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> of the caps of the former species do not darken in maturity, and it has smaller ascospores, measuring 20–29 by 14–19µm. Another potential lookalike, M.brunnea, has a browner fruit body color in young specimens, and a stipe that is not lacunose.|$|E
5000|$|The ridgeback {{is under}} a control of two groups of {{epistatic}} genes. The first determines the existence of <b>the</b> <b>ridge.</b> <b>The</b> other determines the size of <b>the</b> <b>ridge,</b> from none to very large (down to the side) the latter, the more the genes in the dog, the broader is <b>the</b> <b>ridge.</b> <b>The</b> <b>ridge</b> will appear only if {{there is at least}} one dominant allele in both groups.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>ridge</b> has an {{elevation}} of about 500 m. Its eminence over the river is about 230 m. From the top of <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> <b>the</b> valley below appears as a sunken bowl between Mount Taygetus and Therapne, hence the Homeric epithet [...] "Hollow Lacedaemon." [...] There is no standard modern name of <b>the</b> <b>ridge.</b> Some {{refer to it as}} Mount Menelaus after the Menelaion, a temple that stood on <b>the</b> <b>ridge,</b> or <b>the</b> Menelaus <b>Ridge,</b> and others Mount Therapne.|$|R
50|$|The main {{obstacle}} {{to building a}} railway was <b>the</b> Greensand <b>Ridge</b> south of Maidstone, with the villages of Chart Sutton and Town Sutton (Sutton Valence) on <b>the</b> <b>ridge.</b> <b>The</b> line from Paddock Wood to Maidstone had already taken the only gap in <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> south of <b>the</b> town. But the River Loose had cut a channel into <b>the</b> <b>ridge,</b> which could possibly be used to drive a railway through {{to reach the top}} of <b>the</b> <b>ridge.</b>|$|R
5|$|Native Americans {{occupied}} the river valleys surrounding the Metacomet Ridge {{for at least}} 10,000 years. Major tribal groups active in the area included the Quinnipiac, Niantic, Pequot, Pocomtuc, and Mohegan. Traprock was used to make tools and arrowheads. Natives hunted game, gathered plants and fruits, and fished in local bodies of water around the Metacomet Ridge. Tracts of woodland in the river bottoms surrounding <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> were sometimes burned to facilitate the cultivation of crops such as corn, squash, tobacco, and beans.|$|E
5|$|Routes up Helvellyn {{can begin}} from {{the villages of}} Glenridding or Patterdale to the east, Grasmere to the south, or {{from a number of}} places along the A591 road to the west, and can follow any of the mountain's five ridges, or <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> of its neighbours, {{as well as some of}} the gills and {{shoulders}} on the west side of the range. Walkers can choose between many routes.|$|E
5|$|The 72nd Battalion would {{circle the}} {{position}} {{by the south}} to join the Jerusalem road {{at the level of}} Bab al-Wad; it would then cross the road and climb <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> to take Dayr Ayyub, Yalu and Bayt Nuba, and would ambush there to cover the passage of convoys. It would be supported by three armored cars and two half-tracks of the 73rd Battalion.|$|E
5000|$|Pennsylvania Route 305 crosses <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> {{and follows}} a valley along a fault line at [...] near Greenwood Furnace State Park. Allensville Road also crosses <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> crest north of Allensville, and Barrville Road {{passes through a}} wind gap west of Barrville. There are no water gaps {{carrying}} rivers through <b>the</b> <b>ridge.</b> <b>The</b> Saddler Creek passes the southern foot of <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> near <b>the</b> town of Mill Creek.|$|R
5000|$|Goffle Hill {{generally}} {{refers to}} <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> of First Watchung Mountain {{north of the}} Passaic River and south of Campgaw Mountain.

5|$|The morning {{infantry}} fighting {{occurred on}} either side of the Chambersburg Pike, mostly on McPherson Ridge. To the north, an unfinished railroad bed opened three shallow cuts in <b>the</b> <b>ridges.</b> To the south, the dominant features were Willoughby Run and Herbst Woods (sometimes called McPherson Woods, but they were the property of John Herbst). Brig. Gen. Lysander Cutler's Union brigade opposed Davis's brigade; three of Cutler's regiments were north of the Pike, two to the south. To the left of Cutler, Brig. Gen. Solomon Meredith's Iron Brigade opposed Archer.|$|E
5|$|The species favours lowland {{areas that}} are {{seasonally}} wet but never inundated, such as the margins of swamps and marshes. For example, in the Yule Brook Botany Reserve, where parallel sand ridges cross a clay flat, B.telmatiaea occurs neither in the lowest parts of the flat, where seasonal inundation occurs; nor {{on the tops of}} <b>the</b> <b>ridges,</b> where the drainage is good; but {{it is one of the}} most abundant plants of intermediate habitats, on ridge slopes and in higher areas of the clay flat.|$|E
5|$|With a {{body mass}} of , Drymoreomys is a {{medium-sized}} rodent with long fur that is orange to reddish-buff above and grayish with several white patches below. The pads on the hindfeet {{are very well}} developed and there is brown fur on the upper sides of the feet. The tail is brown above and below. The front part of the skull is relatively long and <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> on the braincase are weak. The palate is short, with its back margin between the third molars. Several traits of the genitals are not seen in any other oryzomyine rodent.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are several}} hiking {{opportunities}} along <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> mostly via access the Pinhoti Trail. [...] <b>The</b> Taylor <b>Ridge</b> Trail {{is a brief}} view of <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> available off GA 136 directly west of Villanow, Ga. [...] The most historical view of <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> may be within James H. Floyd State Park to the Marble Mine.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Bowers <b>Ridge</b> {{is located}} in the {{southern}} part of the Aleutian Basin. It extends over 900 km in an arc, starting in the southeast at the Aleutian Arc and terminating to the northwest at <b>the</b> Shirshov <b>Ridge.</b> <b>The</b> Bowers <b>Ridge</b> arc separates <b>the</b> Aleutian Basin from the Bowers Basin, which it encloses. <b>The</b> <b>ridge</b> is not currently seismically active. The northern slope of <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> is steeper than the southern slope. On the Aleutian side, <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> is rimmed by a trough filled with a sedimentary sequence 9-10 km thick.|$|R
5|$|With {{the advent}} of {{industrialization}} in the 19th century, riverways beneath the Metacomet Ridge were dammed to provide power as the labor force expanded in nearby cities and towns. Logging to provide additional fuel for mills further denuded <b>the</b> <b>ridges.</b> Traprock and sandstone were quarried from the ridge for paving stones and architectural brownstone, either used locally or shipped via rail, barge, and boat.|$|E
5|$|A {{range of}} {{battlefield}} memorials emerged. The huge Douaumont ossuary {{was built to}} remember Verdun through a private French charity, organised by the Bishop of Verdun. The ossuary was deliberately multi-faith, however, with Catholic, Protestant, Jewish and Islamic facilities. The Romanian authorities built a similar mausoleum at Mărăşeşti, explicitly likened to the use French ossuary at Verdun. Amidst some concerns about denigrating the importance of other battlefields, the CBMC focused on producing a single major memorial at Vimy. In Turkey, the entire battlefield of Gallipoli was ceded to Britain and her imperial allies in 1923, and the area was turned into an extended memorial to the war dead. There were no settlements to reconstruct, so the graves were largely left scattered in individual graves or small cemeteries, and the slopes were planted with Australian vegetation. Obelisks were particularly popular memorials at Gallipoli along <b>the</b> <b>ridges,</b> including one obelisk 100ft high.|$|E
5|$|At 1:00 pm on December 10, General Matsui {{ordered all}} units {{to launch a}} {{full-scale}} attack on Nanking. That day the SEA assaulted China's super-elite Training Brigade on the peaks of Zijinshan, which dominate Nanking's northeast horizon. Clambering up <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> of the mountain, {{the men of the}} SEA had to painstakingly wrest control of each Chinese encampment one by one in bloody infantry charges. Advancing along the south side of Zijinshan was no easier as General Matsui had forbidden his men from using artillery there due to his deep conviction that no damage should come to its two famous historical sites, Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum and Ming Xiaoling Mausoleum.|$|E

5000|$|The 1761 Samuel Gettys tavern {{was built}} near <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> at <b>the</b> {{crossroads}} east of Stevens Creek, and it preceded both the c. 1812 {{construction of the}} Chambersburg Pike across <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> and <b>the</b> nearby [...] "Gettysburg Theological Seminary" [...] being established on <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> on August 1, 1826. [...] In 1832, Old Dorm (now Schmucker Hall) was built, and Pennsylvania College (now Gettysburg College) was started {{on the east side}} of <b>the</b> <b>ridge.</b> On <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> along <b>the</b> Chambersburg Pike, the Thaddeus Stevens building near the seminary (used for Robert E. Lee's 1863 headquarters) was built in 1834.

5|$|Geastrum pectinatum {{has been}} mistaken for the morphologically similar but smaller species G.schmidelii. The latter species lacks {{vertical}} striations on the basal {{portions of the}} endoperidium, and {{does not have a}} pseudoparenchymatous collar around the stem. Another similar species, G.berkeleyi, has a shorter stem and is missing <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> {{at the base of the}} spore sac. Further, the color of its spore sac is usually brown, in contrast to the gray-blue of G.pectinatum. G.xerophilum also has a dusting of white powder on the surface of the spore sac, but unlike G.pectinatum, consistently lacks a ring at the base of the pedicel; furthermore, in contrast to G.pectinatum, the spores of G.xerophilum are yellow and contain oil drops that are readily observable with a microscope. G.striatum has smaller fruit bodies than G.pectinatum, and a distinct collar-like apophysis.|$|E
5|$|On {{the east}} coast are Goat Cave and Clamshell Cave. The latter is 10m high, about 6m wide at the entrance, and some 45m long, and {{on one side of}} it <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> of basalt stand out like the ribs of a ship. Near this cave is the {{pyramidal}} rock islet of Am Buachaille ('The Herdsman'), a pile of basalt columns seen fully only at low tide. Other outlying rocks include Eilean Dubh to the north-west and a series of skerries stretching for half a kilometre to the south-west. On the southwest shore are Boat Cave and Mackinnon's Cave (named after a 15th-century abbot of Iona), which has a tunnel connecting it to Cormorant Cave. These caves lie to the south-west and can be accessed from the bay of Port an Fhasgaidh at low tide. In 1945 a mine exploded near Boat Cave, causing damage to the cliff face which is still visible. Mackinnon's Cave is 107 metres long.|$|E
5|$|Still farther northward in {{the zone}} of the US 38th Infantry the North Koreans were also active. After the North Korean {{breakthrough}} during the night of August 31, Keiser had ordered the 2nd Battalion, 38th Infantry, to move south and help the 23rd Infantry establish a defensive position west of Changnyong. In attempting to do this, the battalion found North Korean troops already on <b>the</b> <b>ridges</b> along the road. They had penetrated to Hill 284 overlooking the 38th Infantry command post. This hill and Hill 209 dominated the rear areas of the regiment. At 06:00 September 3, 300 North Koreans launched an attack from Hill 284 against the 38th Regiment command post. The regimental commander organized a defensive perimeter and requested a bombing strike which was denied him because the enemy target and his defense perimeter were too close to each other. But the Air Force did deliver rocket and strafing strikes.|$|E
50|$|At first, <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> {{was thought}} to be a {{phenomenon}} specific to the Atlantic Ocean. However, as surveys of the ocean floor continued around the world, it was discovered that every ocean contains parts of <b>the</b> mid-ocean <b>ridge</b> system. Although <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> system runs {{down the middle of the}} Atlantic Ocean, <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> is located away from the center of other oceans.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century parts of <b>the</b> <b>ridge</b> were {{converted}} to citrus groves.
