500|$|The {{first series}} {{contains}} {{a total of}} six books. It was originally to be called [...] "The Clawed Path," [...] as the journey the four bears make through all six books in the series is referred to as [...] "the clawed path."

500|$|Ta's {{blind date}} {{proves to be}} the {{thoroughly}} Americanized Linda Low, who we will learn is Sammy Fong's girlfriend and a stripper at his club. [...] On the date with Ta ("I Enjoy Being a Girl"), Linda lies to Ta about her career and family. [...] Ta, knowing that Chinese-Americans with college degrees {{find it hard to}} get a job befitting their education, plans to go to law school, postponing the likely career struggle by three years. [...] The impetuous Ta asks Linda to marry him. [...] She agrees, but she needs family consent and lies, saying that she has a brother who will approve the marriage. [...] Ta returns home and meets Mei Li, who is immediately attracted to him ("I Am Going <b>to</b> <b>Like</b> <b>It</b> Here"), though Ta is unimpressed. [...] That changes when Ta sees her in a Western dress ("Like a God").|$|E

In response to the general acclaim from critics, Roberts wished that the track would be well received amongst her peers, saying [...] "I haven't seen one bad review from the single or album samplers – it seems {{too good to be}} true.

Delphine meets with Sarah to ask if her young daughter, Kira, will donate her bone marrow to help cure Cosima's illness, and Kira agrees. Meanwhile, Cosima works with her lab assistant Scott (Josh Vokey) and Rachel's adoptive father Ethan (Andrew Gillies), a founder scientist of the cloning program, to find the genetic sequence that has caused her illness. Rachel, who is usually stoic, laughs and sobs whilst watching home videos of her childhood, lamenting her own infertility. Disguised as Sarah, she tricks her way into the pediatric clinic where Kira is recovering and sedates Sarah's foster brother Felix (Jordan Gavaris). She abducts Kira and takes her to a young girl's bedroom in the Dyad Institute, telling Kira that she [...] "may even grow <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> here, just as I did".|$|E
500|$|On {{arrival in}} the United States, Mei-li goes to the Golden Pearl Theatre in San Francisco's Chinatown, where little-attended Chinese opera is {{presented}} by her father's old friend Wang Chi-yang and Wang's foster brother Chin. [...] One night a week, Wang's son Ta turns the theater into a nightclub, starring the very assimilated Linda Low, a Chinese-American stripper from Seattle. [...] Linda's constant companion is a gay costume designer, Harvard (so named by his success-obsessed Chinese parents). [...] The nightclub is profitable; the Chinese opera is not. [...] Mei-li joins the opera company ("I Am Going <b>to</b> <b>Like</b> <b>It</b> Here") and is soon attracted to the indifferent Ta, who favors Linda. [...] Mei-li is fascinated by Linda, who urges her to adopt the American lifestyle ("I Enjoy Being a Girl"). [...] Linda is soon signed by talent agent Rita Liang, who pushes Wang to turn the theater into a club full-time ("Grant Avenue"), and he reluctantly opens Club Chop Suey.|$|E
500|$|Rodgers and Hammerstein {{sought to}} give the new work an Eastern flavor, without using {{existing}} oriental music. [...] According to Ben Brantley in his review of the 2002 Broadway revival, the use by Rodgers [...] "of repetitive Eastern musical structures gives the numbers a sing-song catchiness that, for better or worse, exerts a sticky hold on the memory." [...] The most oriental-sounding song in the work is [...] "A Hundred Million Miracles", which provides the eight-note drumbeat which is the musical signature of the work from overture to curtain. [...] Hammerstein wrote Mei Li's first act song, [...] "I Am Going <b>to</b> <b>Like</b> <b>It</b> Here", in a Malaysian poetic form called pantoum in which the second and fourth lines of each stanza become {{the first and third}} lines of the next. [...] One critic thought that the 2001 version's orchestrations [...] "boast more Asian accents and a jazzier edge than the original", but another felt that they [...] "pale in comparison" [...] to Bennett's typically lilting sound.|$|E

500|$|SFX {{magazine}} reviewer Russell Lewin gave [...] "The Doctor's Wife" [...] {{four and}} a half out of five stars, labelling it as [...] "non-stop intrigue and controlled suspense all the way". He particularly praised Smith's energetic performance, saying [...] "he pings and fizzes around the screen like a Technicolor firework, lighting up every scene he adorns". IGN's Matt Risley rated the episode 9 out of 10 and concluded, [...] "Sweet, touching, intelligent, different, utterly imaginative and accessible by both hardcore fans and newbies alike— this is not only Doctor Who, but sci-fi telly at its finest". He also praised Gaiman's script for being [...] "a simple idea executed brilliantly". Patrick Mulkern of Radio Times admitted he was unsure if he was going <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> with the [...] "grungy setting, wacko characters and peculiar dialogue", but ended up [...] "captivated". He particularly enjoyed seeing more of the TARDIS' interior and called it an [...] "instant oddball classic".|$|E
500|$|Several of the {{characters}} are given [...] "I am" [...] songs that introduce them to the audience, allowing the character to express his dreams or desires and for onlookers to establish empathy with the character. [...] Linda Low, for example, expresses her self-confidence with [...] "I Enjoy Being a Girl"; we learn Mei Li's hopes with the quieter [...] "I Am Going <b>to</b> <b>Like</b> <b>It</b> Here". [...] Although not a formal musical number, the brief [...] "You Be the Rock, I'll Be the Roll", sung and danced by Linda and by Wang San, Ta's Americanized teenage brother, was described by Lewis as [...] "virtually the first self-consciously rock and roll ditty ever sung" [...] in a Broadway musical. [...] Patrick Adiarte, who originated the role of Wang San, however, saw it as [...] "corny stuff... put in there to get a laugh". [...] Helen Chao's sad [...] "Love, Look Away" [...] is described by Lewis as [...] "arguably the most tautly crafted blues song Dick and Oscar ever wrote".|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from the}} {{occasional}} performance of [...] "Everything Must Go," [...] {{none of the}} album's songs have been played live since 2010. In the same year, Lazzara answered questions on his Formspring account, commenting that New Again [...] "was a gigantic step backwards" [...] {{and that he was}} [...] "not fully satisfied with what we put out". In 2012, Reyes said of New Again: [...] "I didn't like how we had to constantly change producers and the songwriting didn't turn out originally as it was, it just kind of bummed us out a bit." [...] Discussing New Again in 2016, Rubano called the period [...] "the golden time where I was like 'oh, we're doing music, that we all really like, that we can't wait to get out' and things were going pretty good for a little while". However, when the album was released, the [...] "critics seemed <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>it,</b> but it didn't really hit , and then when we started the touring cycle for it there was a very decisive mood turn in a band that already was insanely moody all the time".|$|E

500|$|In mid-1984, Madonna met {{producer}} Nile Rodgers at the Power Station studios (now Avatar Studios) in New York. Rodgers initially did {{not want}} Madonna to record [...] "Like a Virgin", as {{he felt that the}} lyric 'like a virgin' was not a terrific hook; according to him it was not an all-time catch phrase. Rogers dismissed the song after hearing the demo, which he thought sounded [...] "really stupid and retarded". Later, Rodgers had second thoughts: [...] "It's weird because I couldn't get it out of my head after I played it, even though I didn't really like it. It sounded really bubble-gummy to me, but it grew on me. I really started <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>it.</b> [...] But, my first reaction to it was, 'This is really queer.'" [...] Rodgers credits Madonna with recognizing the song's potential. He later said: [...] "I handed my apology to Madonna and said, 'you know... if it's so catchy that it stayed in my head for four days, it must be something. So let's do it.'" [...] Hence the song was finally recorded. Steinberg reflected on the recording process and commented that: ...|$|E
500|$|Along with Spears's {{performance}} specifically, [...] "Ten Sessions" [...] {{as a whole}} {{was generally}} well received by television critics. In television critics Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoler Seitz's 2016 book TV (The Book), Sepinwall singles out this episode (along with Slap Bet) as episodes where he [...] "will still laugh, and be touched, and marvel at just how inventive a traditional-looking sitcom can be". [...] Bowman gave the episode a 'B' grade, and was more critical of [...] "Ten Sessions". She expressed: [...] "the timing wasn't spot-on all the way through 'Ten Sessions'. The episode was slow starting, and as with many of the series' 'Ted is a master of romance' attempts, the two-minute date seemed as likely to be annoying-quirky as endearing-quirky, if you were the one being wooed. I wanted <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> more than I did. Maybe it almost works because Elliot on Scrubs would have really liked it, ditzy romantic that she is. But no — it's just an ounce heavy on the trying-too-hard scale." [...] In contrast, Zoromski gave the episode an 8.9 out of ten, signifying a [...] "great" [...] rating. He thought that the episode was superior to the previous episode, adding that the show returned to full form.|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{reception}} {{ranged from}} positive to mixed. Critic Maureen Ryan was very {{positive about the}} episode in her blog at The Chicago Tribune, writing, [...] "I liked this week's episode, and for once, it wasn't a case of really wanting <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> {{and trying to find}} reasons to see past various flaws. I just enjoyed the hour and felt it had just the right mixture of creepiness and character development (plus, the Observer was awesome. If only they'd called him the Watcher, but let's not quibble)." [...] Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger found [...] "The Arrival" [...] a noticeable improvement over previous episodes. [...] "...After being more than prepared to give [...] "Fringe That's It For Me! status going into the episode, I enjoyed the strangeness of it—The Observer's hairlessness and diet, Capt. Patterson from [...] "Generation Kill" [...] toting around a futuristic-looking ray gun and a retro-looking mind-reading machine, Walter casually injecting whatsername with a sedative—that I think I'll be sticking around for a bit... If I can brace myself for the probability that this will all lead to nonsense, I can groove on all the atmospherics along the way. And, if nothing else, Abrams is great at atmosphere." ...|$|E

500|$|Musically, [...] "All In My Head (Flex)" [...] fuses reggae and pop with trap music. The song {{is three}} minutes and thirty-seconds {{in length and}} samples the song [...] "Flex" [...] by Jamaican DJ Mad Cobra which itself {{interpolated}} elements of The Temptations' [...] "Just My Imagination". Its instrumentation consists of guitar, percussion, synthesized finger snaps and synths creating an electronic-reggae beat. The song opens with Hansen singing the chorus featuring guitar chords and crisp clicks. Following the rap performed by Fetty Wap, Ally Brooke belts out [...] the first verse: [...] "Curtains like waves closing in all around us, dimming the lights just so that they don't blind us," [...] backed by the percussion and guitar chords. Concerning his collaboration on [...] "All in My Head (Flex)", Fetty Wap told Billboard that during the recording, his voice [...] "wasn't as mature as it is now." [...] And described as [...] "impossible" [...] to performed the song on stage. [...] "Like, I smoke way too much now. No more high-range. If you were actually to hear the first version to that song, I do not sound anything like that. It was way high up there. So when we changed everything I was like I don't think they going <b>to</b> <b>like</b> <b>it</b> because it felt like I took the energy from it. But they were like we love it, we rocking with it."

500|$|Despite being a [...] "critically acclaimed" [...] film, {{according}} to Rotten Tomatoes, {{not all of}} its reviews were this positive.

Smith stated, [...] "clunky plotting and characterisation mean it has 'telemovie' written all over it." [...] Marc Mohan from The Oregonian stressed it {{can be compared to}} after-school specials due to its [...] "lack of originality in plot and character." [...] Time Outs Jessica Winter also drew a comparation to after-school specials, saying [...] "on the big screen ... its clichés seem bigger and its characterisations broader than they would on the more forgiving telly." [...] Nick Schager's of Slant Magazine lamented that the [...] "clichés are too numerous to mention", while Neil Smith from BBC asserted it has [...] "as much ... fantasy as Lord of the Rings." [...] Jan Stuart of Newsday deemed it [...] "virtually suspense-free, while Robert Hanks of The Independent stated it has an important message but that is a [...] "shame it couldn't be encased in a less faked-up story". Commenting on The Times, Chris Ayres stressed that although it has good [...] "visual flair" [...] it [...] "is ruined by its Oprah-style emotional manipulation."
