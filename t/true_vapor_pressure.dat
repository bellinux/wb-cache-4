50|$|The Reid vapor {{pressure}} (RVP) differs {{slightly from the}} <b>true</b> <b>vapor</b> <b>pressure</b> (TVP) of a liquid due to small sample vaporization {{and the presence of}} water vapor and air in the confined space of the test equipment. That is, the RVP is the absolute {{vapor pressure}} and the TVP is the partial vapor pressure.|$|E
30|$|A {{standard}} problem in courses on Statistical Mechanics, when {{the topic is}} Stefan’s law, is the calculation {{of the size of}} a “solar panel” large enough to collect the energy currently consumed by the earth’s population. Even though this is an academic problem, the resulting area is surprisingly small, providing a feeling for the vast amount of solar energy received by the surface of the earth. One of the technologies, being developed in this context, is that of thermal solar power plants, especially of the parabolic trough and power tower types. Inside these plants, heat transfer fluids, e.g., molten salts, are used for energy transport as well as storage [1]. Heat transfer fluids must meet certain key criteria - aside from being inexpensive. They should be thermally stable at high temperatures. Their melting point should be as low as possible. The same is <b>true</b> for their <b>vapor</b> <b>pressure</b> at high temperatures (several hundred degree Celsius). Other aspects include corrosivity, viscosity, thermal conductivity, toxicity, etc.|$|R
50|$|Put in <b>vapor</b> <b>pressure</b> terms, {{a liquid}} boils at the {{temperature}} when its <b>vapor</b> <b>pressure</b> equals the surrounding pressure. For the solvent, {{the presence of}} the solute decreases its <b>vapor</b> <b>pressure</b> by dilution. A non-volatile solute has a <b>vapor</b> <b>pressure</b> of zero, so the <b>vapor</b> <b>pressure</b> of the solution is less than the <b>vapor</b> <b>pressure</b> of the solvent. Thus, a higher temperature is needed for the <b>vapor</b> <b>pressure</b> to reach the surrounding pressure, and the boiling point is elevated.|$|R
50|$|The <b>vapor</b> <b>pressure</b> here {{differs from}} the {{meteorological}} definition of <b>vapor</b> <b>pressure,</b> which describes the partial pressure {{of water in the}} atmosphere at some value less than 100% saturation. <b>Vapor</b> <b>pressure</b> as relating to cavitation refers to the <b>vapor</b> <b>pressure</b> in equilibrium conditions and can therefore be more accurately defined as the equilibrium (or saturated) <b>vapor</b> <b>pressure.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{contribution}} {{was to develop a}} simple tool based on fuzzy logic concepts to predict <b>true</b> <b>vapor</b> <b>pressure</b> of volatile petroleum products. In this regard, the adaptive neuro fuzzy inference system was evolved to estimate the <b>true</b> <b>vapor</b> <b>pressure</b> of volatile petroleum products as function of temperature and Reid vapor pressure. In addition, to determine optimal membership function parameters, the particle swarm optimization as an amazing evolutionary algorithm was applied. This predictive tool is suggested as a precise technique to measure the true vapor pressures of typical liquefied petroleum gases, natural gasoline, and motor fuel components at broad ranges of temperatures. This technique was trained and tested by 156 set of data points collected from the reference. The temperature range is 253 – 373 K and the range of Reid vapor pressure is 35 – 250 KPa. Results obtained from the present tool found to be in acceptable agreement with the actual reported data in the literature.

40|$|In this article, an Arrhenius-type {{asymptotic}} {{exponential function}} combined with Vandermonde matrix, which {{is easier than}} existing approaches, less complicated with fewer computations, and suitable for process engineers, is presented here for the estimation of liquefied petroleum gas and natural gasoline <b>true</b> <b>vapor</b> <b>pressure</b> {{as a function of}} Reid vapor pressure and temperature. This predictive tool is recommended as a quick reference to determine true vapor pressures of typical liquefied petroleum gases, natural gasoline, and motor fuel components at various temperatures. Additionally, the developed tool will enable estimation of operating pressure of a storage tank necessary to maintain the stored fluid in a liquid state at various temperatures as well as for simple evaluation of refrigerated storage versus ambient temperature storage for liquefied petroleum gases. The proposed predictive tool works for temperatures in the range of 253 to 373 K and Reid vapor pressure more than 35 kPa. The proposed method is superior owing to its accuracy and clear numerical background based on Vandermonde matrix, wherein the relevant coefficients can be retuned quickly if more data are available. Estimations are found to be in excellent agreement with the reliable data in the literature with average absolute deviations being around 2. 4 %. The tool developed in this study can be of immense practical value for the engineers and scientists to have a quick check on the <b>true</b> <b>vapor</b> <b>pressure</b> of typical liquefied petroleum gases, natural gasoline, and motor fuel components at various conditions without opting for any experimental measurements. In particular, chemical and process engineers would find the approach to be user-friendly with transparent calculations involving no complex expressions...|$|E
40|$|Filling {{losses in}} tanks {{due to the}} {{expansion}} of the liquid into the tank and the vapors that are forced out of the tank are generally called displacement losses. Restrictions on vaporization loss of petroleum products give added emphasis to the accurate prediction of vapor pressure and hydrocarbon losses for petroleum products. In this work, firstly, a simple-to-use correlation is developed to estimate the <b>true</b> <b>vapor</b> <b>pressure</b> of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and natural gasoline as a function of Reid Vapor pressure (RVP) and temperature as well as the vapor pressure of different mixtures of propane and butane are correlated as a function of ambient air temperature and propane volume percent. Secondly, the filling losses from storage containers are estimated in percentage of liquid pumped in tanks as a function of working pressure and vapor pressure at liquid temperature. The study showed the proposed method to be in good agreement with the available reliable data in the literature. The average absolute deviation between reported data and the proposed correlation is less than 2 %. The proposed simple-to-use approach can be of significant practical value for the process engineers and scientists to have a quick check on the prediction of the displacement losses from storage containers as well as for rapid estimation of vapor pressure of LPG and natural gasoline...|$|E

Even though, <b>vapor</b> <b>pressure</b> data for most of the commonly used chemical compounds are available in the literature and the data bank is continuously being updated, reliable <b>vapor</b> <b>pressure</b> data for vegetable oils are scarce. <b>Vapor</b> <b>pressure</b> of vegetable oils are not easily determined due to its complex nature (chemical composition) and temperature sensitivity.

30|$|The {{goals of}} this study were to {{determine}} the effects of furnish type and mat density on temperature and <b>vapor</b> <b>pressure</b> inside the mat of wood-based panels during hot pressing and to confirm their effects on panel properties.

The results from this study showed that furnish type and mat density affected temperature and <b>vapor</b> <b>pressure</b> behaviors. The results also showed the effect on panel properties. HS-board had a higher plateau temperature, longer plateau time, and higher <b>vapor</b> <b>pressure</b> than did Mixed- and RW-board. Higher mat density was associated with higher plateau temperature and <b>vapor</b> <b>pressure</b> and longer plateau time and <b>vapor</b> <b>pressure</b> band.

Uncertainties in the solid-state saturation <b>vapor</b> <b>pressures</b> obtained from individual methodologies are typically on the order of 50 - 100 %, but the differences between saturation <b>vapor</b> <b>pressures</b> obtained with different methods are approximately 1 - 4 orders of magnitude, with the spread tending to increase as the saturation <b>vapor</b> <b>pressure</b> decreases.
