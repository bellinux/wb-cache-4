5|$|Among those {{determined}} that London {{should have a}} permanent orchestra of similar excellence were Sir John Reith, director-general of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), and <b>the</b> <b>conductor</b> Sir Thomas Beecham. In 1928 they opened discussions about jointly setting up such an ensemble, but after 18 months of negotiations {{it became clear that}} the corporation and <b>the</b> <b>conductor</b> had irreconcilable priorities. Beecham demanded more personal control of the orchestra and repertoire than the BBC was willing to concede, and his priorities were the opera house and the concert hall rather than the broadcasting studio. The BBC went ahead without him, and under its director of music, Adrian Boult, launched the BBC Symphony Orchestra in October 1930, to immense acclaim.|$|E
5|$|During a {{train ride}} to New York, <b>the</b> <b>conductor</b> {{told her to}} move into the smoking car. She refused, {{explaining}} her government service. He cursed at her and grabbed her, but she resisted and he summoned two other passengers for help. While she clutched at the railing, they muscled her away, breaking her arm in the process. They threw her into the smoking car, causing more injuries. As these events transpired, other white passengers cursed Tubman and shouted for <b>the</b> <b>conductor</b> to kick her off the train.|$|E
5|$|In 1879, Edwin Herbert Hall {{working at}} the Johns Hopkins University {{discovered}} a voltage developing across conductors transverse to an electric current in <b>the</b> <b>conductor</b> and magnetic field perpendicular to the current. This phenomenon arising {{due to the nature}} of charge carriers in <b>the</b> <b>conductor</b> came to be termed the Hall effect, but it was not properly explained at the time, since the electron was experimentally discovered 18 years later. After the advent of quantum mechanics, Lev Landau in 1930 developed the theory of landau quantization and laid the foundation for the theoretical explanation for the quantum Hall effect discovered half a century later.|$|E
25|$|Because <b>the</b> <b>conductors</b> (or plates) {{are close}} together, the {{opposite}} charges on <b>the</b> <b>conductors</b> attract one another {{due to their}} electric fields, allowing the capacitor to store more charge for a given voltage than when <b>the</b> <b>conductors</b> are separated, yielding a larger capacitance.|$|R

5|$|Although Owen was <b>the</b> <b>conductor</b> for the {{performances}} of Cavalliera Rusticana, and remained as musical director of the company until 1952, his health was fragile and he conducted none of the company's other productions.

5|$|Beecham, by Caryl Brahms and Ned Sherrin, is a play celebrating <b>the</b> <b>conductor</b> {{and drawing}} on {{a large number of}} Beecham stories for its material. Its first production, in 1979, starred Timothy West in the title role. It was later adapted for television, {{starring}} West, with members of the Hallé Orchestra taking part in the action and playing pieces associated with Beecham.|$|E
5|$|Early in his Provisional Theatre conductorship Smetana {{had made}} a {{powerful}} enemy in František Pivoda, the Director of the Prague School of Singing. Formerly a supporter of Smetana's, Pivoda was aggrieved when <b>the</b> <b>conductor</b> recruited singing talent from abroad rather than from Pivoda's school. In an increasingly bitter public correspondence, Pivoda claimed that Smetana was using his position to further his own career, {{at the expense of}} other composers.|$|E
5|$|Edwards began {{serving as}} music {{director}} of the Portland Columbia Symphony Orchestra in 2000. His year-long audition process for the music director position with the Olympia Symphony Orchestra began during the 2002–2003 season. The season also marked his fifth with the Marrowstone Summer Music program, where he remained until 2005. In 2010, Edwards was one of four finalists for <b>the</b> <b>conductor</b> position with the Yakima Symphony Orchestra.|$|E
50|$|The sulphur in {{vulcanised}} rubber insulation attacked bare copper wire so <b>the</b> <b>conductors</b> were tinned to prevent this. <b>The</b> <b>conductors</b> reverted to being bare when rubber {{ceased to be}} used.|$|R
