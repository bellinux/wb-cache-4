5|$|Because works {{critical}} of {{the leadership of the}} Chinese regime are considered sensitive, Gui always kept his work projects secret; he kept his movements to himself and his telephone calls were re-routed through foreign countries. He went a long period without entering China; he did not visit his father when the latter was ill, and did not return to China for his father's funeral. Media sources reported that Gui had published about half of the popular books written on Bo Xilai. When Bo was caught in <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>fallout</b> from the Wang Lijun incident in 2013, Gui reaped a financial benefit of HK$10million from the surge in book sales. Gui's publishing financed his property acquisitions in Hong Kong and Germany, including a seaside retreat in Pattaya, Thailand.|$|E
5|$|The battalion's future {{had been}} {{referred}} to Sixth Army Group, the controlling formation, for further consideration; after some debate, they requested the investigation be reopened with a particular focus on the enlisted men of the unit. The second inspection showed that the enlisted men were broadly competent at their duties, but {{that most of them}} preferred rear-area duties over combat roles. The inspection recommended that the enlisted men be transferred to one of the segregated infantry divisions. In the event, the unit was assigned to Sixth Army Group headquarters, where it was used in a service role. It remained nominally active—to avoid <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>fallout</b> of deactivating a black combat unit—but its equipment was transferred as replacements to other battalions and the battalion itself was virtually disbanded as a combat unit.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>political</b> <b>fallout</b> {{from the}} {{disastrous}} Battle of Greece led to Blamey's appointment as deputy commander in Chief Middle East Command in April 1941. However, {{to ensure that}} command would not pass to Blamey {{in the event of}} something happening to Wavell, the British government promoted Sir Henry Maitland Wilson to general in June. Soon afterwards, Wavell was replaced by General Sir Claude Auchinleck. Blamey was subsequently promoted to the same rank on 24 September 1941, becoming only the fourth Australian to reach this rank, after Monash, Chauvel and White. During the Syrian campaign against the Vichy French, Blamey took decisive action to resolve the command difficulties caused by Wilson's attempt to direct the fighting from the King David Hotel in Jerusalem by interposing Lavarack's I Corps headquarters.|$|E

After much controversy, the Mexican government revealed that the idea to meet with Trump originated with Videgaray Caso.|$|R
50|$|Makk and McLeay Nursing Home, {{a part of}} {{the state}} {{government}}'s Aged Mental Health Care Service in Oakden, became the subject of ill notoriety in 2016 and 2017 when it was sanctioned by the federal government following allegations (later proved) of mistreatment of residents.

50|$|Between 2000 and 2006, CRLA was {{investigated}} six times by LSC or by its Inspector General. The {{subject of the}} investigations ranged from issues of timekeeping, to facilities sharing, to CRLA affiliations with non-LSC agencies. The CRLA maintained that <b>the</b> investigations were <b>political</b> <b>fallout</b> for obtaining over one million dollars in settlements from dairy farmers.|$|R
5|$|Dole and {{his allies}} in the {{legislature}} used the coin issuance {{as a means of}} attacking the government, accusing Gibson and others of disobeying the laws, and demanding information on Spreckels' profits, which the government stated was about three percent after costs such as transport and insurance were calculated. <b>The</b> <b>political</b> <b>fallout</b> of the coinage was the 1884 election-year shift towards the Kuokoa (independent) Party in the legislature. The Currency Act of 1884, passed after the election, restricted acceptance of silver coin as payment to debts under $10, and limited the exchange of silver for gold at the treasury to $150,000 a month. The new silver coins were expected to flow into the Treasury in exchange for gold under this arrangement, but the government refused to implement the law until forced to by the Supreme Court. To avoid a financial panic, major private banks and businesses agreed to exchange gold for the new silver coins, in which there was little public confidence. But in February 1885, faced with a government refusal to pay out gold (of which the Treasury was almost bare), the private businesses stopped this arrangement. Negotiations followed, and the government reluctantly agreed to sequester more than $550,000 of the coins in a special account to back the banknotes then in circulation. Although this left the government with little liquidity, the increased confidence in its finances allowed it to borrow on a short-term basis. By mid-1885, sugar prices were rising, and prosperity was returning to the islands. Greater amounts of gold flowed into the islands, balancing the silver that was already there, and stabilizing the monetary situation. The Kalākaua coins became more acceptable, and by 1888, most of the non-US foreign silver had been exchanged for them. They remained in circulation during the turbulent years of the 1890s in Hawaii, as the monarchy fell and the short-lived republic ended in 1898 with annexation to the United States. Despite the urging of local interests, it was not until 1903 that Congress acted, ordering that the Hawaii silver coins be exchanged by January 1, 1904, or lose status as legal tender. By 1907, coins worth about $814,000 of the $1,000,000 originally issued had been redeemed; they were exchanged for US silver and melted down at the San Francisco Mint.|$|E
25|$|In 2002 the National Rainbow Coalition won {{political}} control of Kenya, {{but the country}} remained politically unstable. Electoral manipulation was alleged, and it was widely confirmed by international observers in the 2007 elections. <b>The</b> <b>political</b> <b>fallout</b> from the 2007 election resulted in a country-wide economic and humanitarian crisis extending into 2008. Throughout the 2000s, there had been widespread ethnic violence in Kenya and East Africa, including killings, and the displacement {{of hundreds of thousands}} of people by 2008.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>political</b> <b>fallout</b> from Iraq and {{the pension}} reforms led to poor {{results for the}} LDP in the July 2004 upper house elections. While the {{coalition}} retained its majority, and the LDP remained the largest party, the opposition DPJ narrowly won {{the largest number of}} the contested seats. This was considered a setback, and reflective of the Prime Minister's decline in popularity, but Koizumi refused to resign. Two months after the election, Koizumi conducted the first reshuffle of his second cabinet in an attempt to improve his popularity, he changed several key ministers, but kept his key economic team in place.|$|E

Following the very public revelation of the atrocities committed on the remote planet Miranda, the Alliance attempt to contain <b>the</b> resulting <b>political</b> <b>fallout</b> and to suppress Anti-Alliance riots and protests. The Alliance has been forced onto <b>the</b> <b>political</b> defensive: their public stance is that {{those responsible for the}} Miranda Transmission are Terrorists who must be brought to justice. Aboard an Alliance battle cruiser, ranking officials including the apparent senior official, Kalista, are aware that the crew of Serenity were responsible for broadcasting the transmission, and conspire to capture them via a network of informers and undercover Alliance agents.|$|R
50|$|By 1916, the British {{government}} was becoming increasingly {{worried about the}} Ghadar Party, a US-based political movement which was agitating for rebellion against British rule in India. The American authorities had been reluctant to check the Indian seditionist movement earlier in the war, and fear about <b>the</b> potential <b>political</b> <b>fallout</b> had prevented Spring Rice from pressing the matter diplomatically. However, in February 1916 Spring Rice was ordered to raise the issue with the new US Secretary of State, Robert Lansing. The subsequent Hindu-German Conspiracy Trial uncovered plans to incite an armed revolt in India with German support.|$|R
25|$|For this reason, and <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>fallout</b> {{after the}} 1605 Gunpowder plot and the Plantation of Ulster in 1613-15, the {{constituencies}} for the Irish House of Commons were changed to give Protestants a majority. The Plantation of Ulster allowed English and Scottish Protestant candidates in {{as representatives of}} the newly formed boroughs in planted areas. Initially this gave Protestants a majority of 132-100 in the House of Commons. However, after vehement Catholic protests, including a brawl in the chamber on Parliament's first sitting, {{some of the new}} Parliamentary constituencies were eliminated, giving Protestants a slight majority (108-102) of members of the House of Commons thereafter.|$|E
25|$|The {{province}} {{went through}} significant political instability since 2004, {{due largely to}} the number of scandals that have hit the province on labour safety, the environment, and the interconnected nature between the provincial political establishment and big coal companies. Yu Youjun was sent by the central government in 2005 to become Governor but resigned {{in the wake of the}} Shanxi slave labour scandal in 2007. He was succeeded by Meng Xuenong, who had been previously sacked as Mayor of Beijing in the aftermath of the SARS outbreak. Meng himself was removed from office in 2008 after only a few months on the job due to <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>fallout</b> from the 2008 Shanxi mudslide.

25|$|In 1967, {{not long}} after the Spiegel {{interview}} Boulez, theatre director Jean Vilar and choreographer Maurice Béjart were asked to devise a scheme for the reform of the Paris Opéra, with a view to Boulez becoming its music director. Their plan—to close the Opéra-Comique, merge its orchestra with that of the Palais Garnier, end permanent singer contracts and focus on a smaller repertoire—was derailed by <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>fallout</b> from the 1968 student protests. Later, in the mid-1980s, Boulez became Vice President of the planned Opéra Bastille in Paris, working with Daniel Barenboim, who was to be its music director. In 1988 the incoming Culture Minister Jack Lang appointed Pierre Bergé (president of Yves Saint Laurent) as Director. Bergé dismissed Barenboim and Boulez withdrew in solidarity, taking his planned productions with him.|$|E

25|$|New Zealand faced several {{problems}} {{on the eve of}} their 1996–97 tour of Pakistan. Initially, over questions of safety, the New Zealand Cricket Board considered cancelling the tour in light of the removal of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and <b>the</b> resulting <b>political</b> <b>fallout.</b> Majid Khan, <b>the</b> then-chief executive of the Pakistan Cricket Board sent assurances to his opposite number in New Zealand, Christopher Doig, that the country was safe to tour. The New Zealand Ministry of Foreign Affairs also conducted an investigation and believed the tour was safe. New Zealand had previous called off tours of Sri Lanka in 1986–87, and in 1991–92 five players returned home early, all due to bombings and security concerns.|$|R

Evidence suggested that the public work contract kickbacks from the Punica case could also involve possible illegal financing of the PP branch in the region. Esperanza Aguirre, former President of Madrid from 2003-2012 and president of the party's regional branch since 2004, resigned as regional leader on 14 February as a consequence of <b>the</b> scandal's <b>political</b> <b>fallout,</b> emphasising her lack of [...] "direct responsibility" [...] for the scandal but [...] "assuming her political responsibility" [...] both as party leader and former regional premier.|$|R
25|$|With the {{emergence}} of the Republicans as the nation's first major sectional party by the mid-1850s, politics became the stage on which sectional tensions were played out. Although much of the West– the focal point of sectional tensions– was unfit for cotton cultivation, Southern secessionists read <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>fallout</b> as a sign that their power in national politics was rapidly weakening. Before, the slave system had been buttressed to an extent by the Democratic Party, which was increasingly seen as representing a more pro-Southern position that unfairly permitted Southerners to prevail in the nation's territories and to dominate national policy before the Civil War. But Democrats suffered a significant reverse in the electoral realignment of the mid-1850s. 1860 was a critical election that marked a stark change in existing patterns of party loyalties among groups of voters; Abraham Lincoln's election was a watershed in the balance of power of competing national and parochial interests and affiliations.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>political</b> <b>fallout</b> {{resulting}} from Bodyline ensured that Voce, despite taking eight wickets against the Australians in 1934, was not chosen {{for any of}} the Tests, and before the 1935 season started, Voce asked MCC not to choose him. However, in county cricket, Voce was as good a bowler as ever, and may have taken over 150 wickets in both 1935 and 1936, but for faulty catching in the slips. He declared himself available again during the latter year, and became party to the 1936/1937 tour under Gubby Allen. Bowling this time to an off-side field, Voce, after a disappointing beginning, bowled superbly in the first Test at the Gabba with six for 41 on a perfect pitch, and crushed Australia with four for sixteen, after rain, on the fifth day. England won by 322 runs, and Voce again utilised a rain-affected pitch in the second Test with match figures of seven for 76, including three wickets in four balls. After taking seventeen wickets in the inaugural two Tests, Voce did not keep up his form in the last three due to a back problem. He still finished with 26 wickets to be the leading bowler for the series.|$|E
25|$|The large troop {{movements}} these withdrawals and reinforcements required caused a substantial reorganisation of the EEF. Until September, when Allenby's force {{would be completely}} reformed and retrained, {{it would not be}} in a position to successfully attack both the Transjordan on the right and the Plain of Sharon on the left as well as continuing to hold the centre in the Judean Hills. In the meantime, it seemed essential to occupy the Transjordan to establish closer ties with Britain's important Arab ally, Feisal and the Hejaz Arabs. Until direct contact was made, Allenby could not completely support this force and he knew that if Feisal was defeated, German and Ottoman forces could turn the whole length of the EEF's right flank. This would make their hard-won positions shaky all the way to Jerusalem, and could result in a humiliating withdrawal, possibly to Egypt. Apart from the extremely important military ramifications of such a loss of captured territory, <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>fallout</b> could include a negative effect on the Egyptian population, upon whose cooperation the British war effort relied heavily. Allenby hoped that a series of attacks into the hills of Moab could turn Ottoman attention away from the Plain of Sharon, north of Jaffa on the Mediterranean coast, to the important railway junction at Daraa which, if captured by T.E. Lawrence and Feisal, would seriously dislocate the Ottoman railway and lines of communication in Palestine.|$|E
50|$|The last blunder {{nationalist}} {{made was}} the infatuation with {{holding on to}} as much land as possible, which resulted in insufficient force to complete the planned mission. Although more than 300,000 nationalist troops were mobilized in this campaign, around two third of them was deployed to guard the newly conquered land. As the enemy left {{more than half of}} its original strength in the region to fight the guerrilla warfare, these troops were tied down, because it was difficult to exterminate the elusive enemy and safeguard the territory at the same time when a static defense posture was adopted in order {{to hold on to the}} land. In the meaning time, the remaining mobile strike force was insufficient to exterminate the main force of the enemy attempting to breakout, thus neither the extermination of the enemy nor the long-term safeguard of the newly conquered territory could be effectively achieved. Although the nationalist failed to eliminate the enemy, they did succeeded in eradicating the enemy and temporarily taking the enemy base in the region, though this success was negated by <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>fallouts</b> such as failing to achieve its original objective of exterminating the enemy within the region in this first campaign of the full scale Chinese Civil War after World War II.|$|R

500|$|Argaven Harge XV is {{the king}} of Karhide during {{the events of the}} novel. He is {{described}} both by his subjects and by Estraven as being [...] "mad". He has sired seven children, but has yet to bear [...] "an heir of the body, king son". During the novel he becomes pregnant but loses the child before it is born, triggering speculation as to which of his sired children will be named his heir. His behavior towards Ai is consistently paranoid; although he grants Ai an audience, he refuses to believe his story, and declines the offer to join the Ekumen. The tenure of his prime ministers tends to be short, with both Estraven and Tibe rising and falling from power during the two Gethenian years that the novel spans. Argaven eventually agrees to join the Ekumen due to <b>the</b> <b>political</b> <b>fallout</b> of Estraven's death and Ai's escape from Orgoreyn.|$|E
