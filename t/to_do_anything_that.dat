He also tried marijuana and ketamine experiences at John Lilly's famed sensory deprivation tanks, {{as a way}} of studying consciousness. He gave up alcohol when he began to show vague, early signs of alcoholism, as he did not want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> could damage his brain.|$|E
5|$|His {{appointment}} in September 1990 as Personal Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Humanitarian Assistance Relating to the Crisis between Iraq and Kuwait required diplomatic finesse. Iraq's President Saddam Hussein was deeply {{suspicious of the}} UN, and was loath <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> would benefit the country's Shia Muslims. Despite this, Prince Sadruddin was able to successfully negotiate with Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz {{for the establishment of}} a UN relief program for tens of thousands of Shia Muslims trapped in worsening conditions in the marshlands of southern Iraq.|$|E
25|$|Doukas {{places the}} {{defenders}} at 5,000, but Archbishop Benedetto claims that only 1,000 were present; among them 70 Knights Hospitaller and 110 Catalan mercenaries. According to Doukas, {{the town of}} Mytilene harboured a civilian population of around 20,000. The defenders further hoped for {{the assistance of the}} Venetians; a fleet of under Vettore Cappello was nearby at Chios. After the siege began, Cappello with his 29 galleys sailed towards Lesbos, and could easily have overwhelmed the Turkish fleet, whose crews had gone ashore to assist in the siege, but in the end, he obeyed his strict instructions not <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> might provoke a war with the Ottomans.|$|E

25|$|Horthy's {{attitude}} to Hitler was ambivalent. On one hand, Hungary was a revisionist state {{that refused to}} accept the frontiers imposed by the Treaty of Trianon. Furthermore, the three states with which Hungary had territorial disputes, namely Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Romania, were all allies of France, so a German-Hungarian alliance seemed logical. On the other hand, Admiral Horthy was a good navalist who believed that sea power was {{the most important factor in}} war. He felt that Britain, as the world's greatest sea power, would inevitably defeat Germany should another war begin. During a meeting with Hitler in 1935, Horthy was well pleased that Hitler informed him that he wanted Germany and Hungary to partition Czechoslovakia, but Horthy went on to tell Hitler that he must careful not <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> might cause an Anglo–German war, because British sea power would sooner or later cause the defeat of the Reich. Horthy was always torn between his belief that an alliance with Germany was the only means that could enable him to revise Trianon and his belief that war against the international order could only end in defeat.|$|E
500|$|Kubrick {{continues}} to be cited as a major influence by many directors, including Christopher Nolan, Todd Field, David Fincher, Guillermo del Toro, David Lynch, Lars von Trier, Tim Burton, Michael Mann, and Gaspar Noé. [...] Many filmmakers imitate Kubrick's inventive and unique use of camera movement and framing, {{as well as his}} use of music, notably Frank Darabont. Paul Thomas Anderson, in an interview with Entertainment Weekly, stated, [...] "it's so hard <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> doesn't owe some kind of debt to what Stanley Kubrick did with music in movies. Inevitably, you're going to end up doing something that he's probably already done before. It can all seem like we're falling behind whatever he came up with." ...|$|E
500|$|Bangalter {{stated that}} [...] "to be free, {{we had to}} be in control. To be in control, we had to finance what we were doing ourselves. The main idea was to be free." [...] Daft Punk {{discussed}} their method with Spike Jonze, director of the [...] "Da Funk" [...] music video. He noted that [...] "they were doing everything based on how they wanted to do it. As opposed to, 'oh we got signed to this record company, we gotta use their plan.' They wanted to make sure they never had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> would make them feel bummed on making music." [...] Although Virgin Records holds exclusive distribution rights over Daft Punk's material, the duo still owns their master recordings through their Daft Trax label.|$|E

500|$|Johnston had a {{reputation}} as a poor batsman, averaging less than 13 in Tests and first-class matches without making a half century. He headed the averages in England in 1953, being not out 16 times out of 17 and averaging 102.00. He attributed this to [...] "a lot of application, concentration and dedication", stating that [...] "class always tells". When Hassett realised that Johnston was atop the batting averages, he told Johnston to tell the opposing captain of this fact and ask them to refrain from dismissing him. In the last match against T. N. Pearce's XI at Scarborough, English Test paceman Alec Bedser bowled wide of the stumps and advised Johnston not <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> would lose him his wicket. In 1954–55 he made 39 for the last wicket with Neil Harvey as they chased 78 for victory before he edged Frank Tyson to the wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans.|$|E
500|$|The {{veterans}} made {{camp in the}} Anacostia flats {{while they}} awaited the congressional decision {{on whether or not}} to pay the bonus. The motion, known as the Patman bill, was decisively defeated, but the veterans stayed in their camp. Butler arrived with his young son Thomas, in mid-July the day before the official eviction by the Hoover administration. He walked through the camp and spoke to the veterans; he told them that they were fine soldiers and they had a right to lobby Congress just as much as any corporation. He and his son spent the night and ate with the men, and in the morning Butler gave a speech to the camping veterans. He instructed them to keep their sense of humor and cautioned them not <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> would cost public sympathy. On July 28, army cavalry units led by General Douglas MacArthur dispersed the Bonus Army by riding through it and using gas. During the conflict several veterans were killed or injured and Butler declared himself a [...] "Hoover-for-Ex-President-Republican".|$|E
500|$|In a 60 Minutes {{interview}} on March 31, 2005, Fonda reiterated {{that she had}} no regrets about her trip to North Vietnam in 1972, {{with the exception of the}} anti-aircraft-gun photo. She stated that the incident was a [...] "betrayal" [...] of American forces and of the [...] "country that gave me privilege". Fonda said, [...] "The image of Jane Fonda, Barbarella, Henry Fonda's daughter ... sitting on an enemy aircraft gun was a betrayal ... the largest lapse of judgment that I can even imagine." [...] She later distinguished between regret over the use of her image as propaganda and pride for her anti-war activism: [...] "There are hundreds of American delegations that had met with the POWs. Both sides were using the POWs for propaganda ... It's not something that I will apologize for." [...] Fonda said she had no regrets about the broadcasts she made on Radio Hanoi, something she asked the North Vietnamese to do: [...] "Our government was lying to us and men were dying because of it, and I felt I had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> I could to expose the lies and help end the war." ...|$|E

If we would've put a big feature on it, like a Kanye or Rihanna or someone, I think it might've done a bit better. It needed something familiar about it." ...|$|R

500|$|Lindstrom {{explained}} that they integrated the elements of climbing, shooting and puzzle solving. This instalment also features a new melee combat system, requiring Lara in some instances to use [...] "direct combat and evasive manoeuvres to distance herself from her attacker". Notably, Lara's bike, among other things, is a key component in solving the puzzles she will encounter in her adventure. Pick-ups have multiple uses as weapons and tools in interaction with the environment, and Lindstrom stated that Lara [...] "can also split up her guns and fire at two different targets simultaneously," [...] or hold an item {{with one hand and}} fire a gun with the other. The grappling hook can be stretched taut and used to pull objects off ledges, illustrating what project lead Rob Pavey said, that [...] "Lara will be able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> you'd expect her to be able to do," [...] which he called [...] "the big theme this year." [...] Lindstrom describes this as [...] "a philosophy called 'What Could Lara Do?'—WCLD. It's short-hand for having the player be able to use their own intuition about what someone with her abilities {{should be able to do}} in an environment such as this, and consistency across the different mechanics and abilities. If she can throw a grenade, then if she can pick up this pole, why can't she throw it?" [...] Crystal Dynamics also made the game non-linear, offering elaborate multi-stage puzzles.|$|E
500|$|William of Orange invaded England on 5 November 1688 in an action, {{known as}} the Glorious Revolution, which {{ultimately}} deposed King James. Forbidden by James to pay Mary a projected visit {{in the spring of}} 1687, Anne corresponded with her and was aware of the plans to invade. On the advice of the Churchills, she refused to side with James after William landed and instead wrote to William on 18 November declaring her approval of his action. Churchill abandoned the unpopular king on the 24th. Prince George followed suit that night, and in the evening of the following day James issued orders to place Sarah Churchill under house arrest at St James's Palace. Anne and Sarah fled from Whitehall by a back staircase, putting themselves under the care of Bishop Compton. They spent one night in his house, and subsequently arrived at Nottingham on 1 December. Two weeks later and escorted by a large company, Anne arrived at Oxford, where she met Prince George in triumph. [...] "God help me!", lamented James on discovering the desertion of his daughter on 26 November, [...] "Even my children have forsaken me." [...] On 19 December, Anne returned to London, where she was at once visited by William. James fled to France on the 23rd. Anne showed no concern at the news of her father's flight, and instead merely asked for her usual game of cards. She justified herself by saying that she [...] "was used to play and never loved <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> looked like an affected constraint".|$|E

2500|$|Dwight Cardiff (George Buza) is {{the only}} {{character}} ever shown to be lazier than Glen Brackston. Dwight is the operator at the Port Asbestos Marina, although he occasionally traveled to the Lodge {{to appear on the}} show.

He also claims to have had a pet snail as a child, but it [...] "ran away on him".|$|E

However Hacket Pain sometimes resisted pressure. In January 1919 Dawson Bates wrote to Sir James Craig telling him that Hacket Pain was reluctant to bring out troops against Sinn Féin-inspired strikes in Belfast, or <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> might make the workers think they were being intimidated, despite pressure from people Bates described as [...] "scare-mongers".|$|E
2500|$|On 1 January 145, Marcus {{was made}} consul a second time. He {{might have been}} unwell at this time: a letter from Fronto {{that might have been}} sent at this time urges Marcus to have plenty of sleep [...] "so that you may come into the Senate with a good colour and read your speech with a strong voice". Marcus had complained of an illness in an earlier letter: [...] "As far as my {{strength}} is concerned, I am beginning to get it back; and there is no trace of the pain in my chest. But that ulcer [...] I am having treatment and taking care not <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> interferes with it." [...] Marcus was never particularly healthy or strong. The Roman historian Cassius Dio, writing of his later years, praised him for behaving dutifully in spite of his various illnesses.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{progressive}} {{news magazine}} The Nation, the rider [...] "curtailed already weak oversight over {{the handful of}} agro-giants that control the GMO market by allowing crops that a judge ruled were not properly approved {{to continue to be}} planted." [...] According to Blunt, who did not add the rider to the bill but who supported it, [...] "What it says is if you plant a crop that is legal to plant when you plant it, you get to harvest it". He later led Senate Republicans in defeating an amendment by Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley to repeal the provision. Blunt claimed all the amendment did [...] "was repeat [...] authority that the secretary in a hearing the other day, before the Agri Approp committee the other day, said he already had. And it didn't require the secretary <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>that</b> the secretary thought was the wrong thing to do. Which {{is one of the reasons}} I thought it was fine..." ...|$|E
