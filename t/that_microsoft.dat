5|$|Beginning with Intel Kaby Lake and AMD Bristol Ridge, Windows 10 is {{the only}} version of Windows <b>that</b> <b>Microsoft</b> will officially support on newer CPU microarchitectures. Terry Myerson stated <b>that</b> <b>Microsoft</b> {{did not want to}} make further {{investments}} in optimizing older versions of Windows and associated software for newer generations of processors. These policies were criticized by the media, who especially noted <b>that</b> <b>Microsoft</b> was refusing to support newer hardware (particularly Intel's Skylake CPUs, which was also originally targeted by the new policy with a premature end of support that was ultimately retracted) on Windows 8.1, a version of Windows that is still in mainstream support until January 2018.|$|E
5|$|Although Half-Life 2 has {{the largest}} {{proportion}} of Achievements, there are 99 spread across all five games, exceeding the 50-Achievement limit <b>that</b> <b>Microsoft</b> maintains to feature the most Achievements of any Xbox 360 product. These Achievements include killing {{a certain number of}} monsters, finding hidden weapon caches, or other tasks specific to each game.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Microsoft {{formed a}} {{partnership}} with IBM to bundle Microsoft's operating system with IBM computers, paying Microsoft a royalty for every sale. In 1985, IBM requested <b>that</b> <b>Microsoft</b> write a new operating system for their computers called OS/2. Microsoft wrote the operating system, but also continued to sell their own alternative, which proved to be in direct competition with OS/2. Microsoft Windows eventually overshadowed OS/2 in terms of sales. When Microsoft launched several versions of Microsoft Windows in the 1990s, they had captured over 90% market share of the world's personal computers.|$|E
50|$|The {{framework}} {{has gained}} enough traction <b>that</b> <b>Microsoft's</b> Mix conference will host an OpenRasta session in 2010.|$|R
5000|$|Initial {{tests showed}} <b>that</b> <b>Microsoft's</b> IMDB {{performed}} better with Oracle7 and Oracle8 than with Microsoft's products SQL Server 6.5 and SQL Server 7.0 and ADO.|$|R
5000|$|After Scroogled, Microsoft {{redirected}} {{its website}} [...] "scroogled.com" [...] to [...] "whymicrosoft.com", a website <b>that</b> argues <b>that</b> <b>Microsoft's</b> products {{are better than}} those of other companies.|$|R
5|$|In October 2010, Microsoft {{suggested}} {{on one of}} its websites that a Windows Phone {{version of}} Angry Birds was in development. Rovio complained <b>that</b> <b>Microsoft</b> had not asked permission {{to make such a}} statement, noting that at that time it had not committed to design a Windows Phone version. Although Rovio asked Microsoft to revise its site to remove references to the game, a Windows Phone version was ultimately released in June 2011.|$|E
5|$|Jeronimo Barrera, Vice President of Product Development for Rockstar Games, {{said that}} the episodes were {{experiments}} because the team were not sure that there was enough users with access to online content on the Xbox 360. Take-Two Interactive's Chief Financial Officer, Lainie Goldstein revealed <b>that</b> <b>Microsoft</b> was paying a total of $50 million {{for the first two}} episodes. In January 2010, Rockstar announced that the DLC as well as Episodes From Liberty City would be made available for the PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows on 13 April 2010 in North America and 16 April 2010 in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The company's {{initial public}} {{offering}} was held on March 14, 1986. The stock, which eventually closed at US$27.75 a share, peaked at $29.25 a share shortly after the market opened for trading. After the offering, Microsoft had a market capitalization of $519.777 million. Microsoft has subsequently acquired 207 companies, purchased stakes in 64 companies, and made 25 divestments. Of the companies <b>that</b> <b>Microsoft</b> has acquired, 107 were based in the United States. Microsoft has not released financial details for most of these mergers and acquisitions.|$|E
50|$|Novell alleged <b>that</b> <b>Microsoft's</b> {{practices}} were anticompetitive in its antitrust complaint against Microsoft. The RTF specifications lack {{some of the}} semantic definitions necessary to read, write and modify documents.|$|R
5000|$|On 26 March 2013, the Spanish free {{software}} development group Hispalinux filed a formal {{complaint with the}} European Commission, contending <b>that</b> <b>Microsoft's</b> secure boot requirements on OEM systems were [...] "obstructive" [...] and anti-competitive.|$|R
50|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, {{hardware}} costs were coming down just as performance speeds were increasing. Kitching saw <b>that</b> <b>Microsoft's</b> Windows PC platforms {{would soon be}} suitable for Antics, and began concentrating on the emerging market of PC multimedia production.|$|R
5|$|Acid2 {{was first}} {{proposed}} by Håkon Wium Lie, {{chief technical officer}} of Opera Software and creator of the widely used Cascading Style Sheets web standard. In a 16 March 2005 article on CNET, Lie expressed dismay <b>that</b> <b>Microsoft</b> Internet Explorer did not properly support web standards and hence was not completely interoperable with other browsers. He announced that Acid2 would be a challenge to Microsoft to design Internet Explorer 7, then in development, to achieve {{a greater degree of}} standards compliance than previous versions of Internet Explorer. The original Acid1 test had forced browser makers to fix their applications or face embarrassment; Lie hoped that Acid2 would do the same.|$|E
5|$|During the {{transition}} from MS-DOS to Windows, the success of Microsoft's product Microsoft Office allowed the company to gain ground on application-software competitors, such as WordPerfect and Lotus 1-2-3. Novell, an owner of WordPerfect for a time, alleged <b>that</b> <b>Microsoft</b> used its inside knowledge of the DOS and Windows kernels and of undocumented Application Programming Interface features to make Office perform better than its competitors. Eventually, Microsoft Office became the dominant business suite, with a market share far exceeding that of its competitors. In March 1992, Microsoft released Windows 3.1 along with its first promotional campaign on TV; the software sold over three million copies in its first two months on the market. In October, Windows for Workgroups 3.1 was released with integrated networking abilities such as peer-to-peer file and printing sharing. In November, Microsoft released {{the first version of}} their popular database software Microsoft Access.|$|E
5|$|Microsoft {{originally}} {{announced that}} users {{who did not}} install the update would not receive any other updates after May 13, 2014. However, meeting this deadline proved challenging: The ability to deploy Windows 8.1 Update through Windows Server Update Services (WSUS) was disabled shortly after its release following {{the discovery of a}} bug which affects the ability to use WSUS as a whole in certain server configurations. Microsoft later fixed the issue but users continued to report that the update may fail to install. Microsoft's attempt to fix the problem was ineffective, to the point <b>that</b> <b>Microsoft</b> pushed the support deadline further to June 30, 2014. On 16 May, Microsoft released additional updates to fix a problem of BSOD in the update.|$|E
50|$|The {{release of}} Dystopia Version 1 was covered on Destructoid where they {{described}} Dystopia as “the user-created mod that is everything <b>that</b> <b>Microsoft's</b> Shadowrun hopes to be”. Dystopia is the IGN editor Ferret, choice for Multiplayer mod, in IGN’s Gamers Arsenal.|$|R
50|$|The {{case on the}} contract, {{including}} the Motorola's RAND commitment to ITU, at U.S. court, would be dispositive of the German court's decision. The district court found <b>that</b> <b>Microsoft's</b> contract based claims would encompass the patent case and injunctive relief in Germany.|$|R
5000|$|Despite Braids {{success on}} the platform, Blow has claimed <b>that</b> <b>Microsoft's</b> Xbox Live Arcade {{certification}} process would turn away developers because [...] "they kind of make themselves {{a pain in the}} ass" [...] and that they would lose market share to Steam as a result.|$|R
5|$|The Xbox 360 {{does not}} have support for Steamworks. Newell {{said that they would}} have liked to bring the service to the console through the game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive, which would have allowed Valve to provide the same feature set that it did for the PlayStation 3, but later said that {{cross-platform}} play would not be present in {{the final version of the}} game. Valve attributes the inability to use Steamworks on the Xbox 360 to limitations in the Xbox Live regulations of the ability to deliver patches and new content. Valve's Erik Johnson stated <b>that</b> <b>Microsoft</b> requires that new content must be certified and validated before distribution, which would limit the usefulness of Steamworks' delivery approach.|$|E
5|$|While Microsoft largely {{failed to}} {{participate}} in the rise of the Internet in the early 1990s, some of the key technologies in which the company had invested to enter the Internet market started to pay off by the mid-90s. One of the most prominent of these was ActiveX, an application programming interface built on the Microsoft Component Object Model (COM); this enabled Microsoft and others to embed controls in many programming languages, including the company's own scripting languages, such as JScript and VBScript. ActiveX included frameworks for documents and server solutions. The company also released the Microsoft SQL Server 6.5, which had built-in support for internet applications. Later in 1997, Microsoft Office 97 as well as Internet Explorer 4.0 were released, marking the beginning of the takeover of the browser market from rival Netscape, and by agreement with Apple Computer, Internet Explorer was bundled with the Apple Macintosh operating system as well as with Windows. Windows CE 2.0, the handheld version of Windows, was released this year, including a host of bug fixes and new features designed to make it more appealing to corporate customers. In October, the Justice Department filed a motion in the federal district court in which they stated <b>that</b> <b>Microsoft</b> had violated an agreement signed in 1994, and asked the court to stop the bundling of Internet Explorer with Windows.|$|E
25|$|Some users complained <b>that</b> <b>Microsoft</b> {{presented}} Silverlight repeatedly as a Windows Update even if {{the user}} had not it installed before. It was speculated <b>that</b> <b>Microsoft</b> shipped a non-functional version of Silverlight with some versions of Windows Service Packs and prompted the user to install Silverlight for each version of Silverlight released.|$|E
5000|$|However, {{others believe}} that OEMs were left sidelined by the {{perception}} <b>that</b> <b>Microsoft's</b> new tablet would replace their products. Acer chairman JT Wang advised Microsoft to [...] "please think twice". <b>Microsoft</b> has acknowledged <b>that</b> Surface may [...] "affect their commitment" [...] of partners to the Windows platform.|$|R
50|$|Microsoft adCenter Labs (a.k.a. adlabs), is an applied {{research}} group at <b>Microsoft</b> <b>that</b> supports <b>Microsoft</b> adCenter. Microsoft adCenter (formerly MSN adCenter), is {{the division of}} the Microsoft Network (MSN) responsible for MSN's advertising services.|$|R
50|$|The {{anti-virus}} has {{to detect}} all macros {{of the virus}} but also any remnants of them. In the example of Colors, the anti-virus must not detect <b>that</b> <b>Microsoft's</b> ScanProt (macro virus protection tool) contains remnants of the virus {{but the problem is}} that ScanProt does contain parts of the virus.|$|R
25|$|In a {{court case}} accusing Microsoft of being a monopoly, Linux and open source {{software}} was introduced in court to prove <b>that</b> <b>Microsoft</b> had valid competitors and was grouped in with Apple.|$|E
25|$|In November 2009 Thomas Claburn, in {{response}} to concerns <b>that</b> <b>Microsoft</b> had patented sudo, characterized such suspicions as overblown. The claims were narrowly framed to a particular GUI, {{rather than to the}} sudo concept.|$|E
25|$|A Memorandum of the United States in Support of Motion for Preliminary Injunction in {{the case}} of United States of America vs. Microsoft claimed <b>that</b> <b>Microsoft</b> wanted to kill Java in the marketplace.|$|E

5000|$|In {{interviews}} in 1993 and 2001, Acorn co-founder Hermann Hauser recounted <b>that</b> <b>Microsoft's</b> Bill Gates, having noticed that 1.5 million BBC Micros were sold, {{tried to sell}} MS-DOS to Acorn, but Hauser considered that adopting MS-DOS {{would have been a}} [...] "retrograde step" [...] in comparison with retaining Acorn's system.|$|R

25|$|In 2006, Amnesty International's British branch chief, Kate Allen, wrote <b>that</b> <b>Microsoft</b> {{handed over}} the details of Vanunu's Hotmail email account by {{alluding}} {{that he was being}} investigated for espionage. This happened before a court order had been obtained.|$|E
25|$|In October 2017, Microsoft {{executive}} Joe Belfiore revealed <b>that</b> <b>Microsoft</b> {{would no}} longer develop new phone hardware, and that Windows 10 Mobile would only receive maintenance releases and patches from then on, citing its low market share and Microsoft's abandonment of its mobile business.|$|E
25|$|In July 2009, Microsoft {{submitted}} Hyper-V {{drivers to}} the kernel, which improve {{the performance of}} virtual Linux guest systems in a Windows hosted environment. Microsoft was forced to submit the code when it was discovered <b>that</b> <b>Microsoft</b> had incorporated a Hyper-V network driver with GPL-licensed components statically linked to closed-source binaries.|$|E
25|$|Microsoft, {{in their}} {{response}} to McGeady's testimony, {{made the point that}} his testimony contained several pro-Microsoft threads, and that Intel practiced similar cross product subsidization, distributing free Intel Architecture Labs software funded by microprocessor revenues. They also claimed <b>that</b> <b>Microsoft's</b> influence over Intel and its microprocessors was unrelated to the downstream software segment.|$|R
500|$|Windows 10 is {{serviced}} in {{a significantly}} different manner from previous releases of Windows. Its delivery {{is often described}} by Microsoft as a [...] "service", due to its ongoing updates, with Terry Myerson explaining <b>that</b> <b>Microsoft's</b> aim is <b>that</b> [...] "the question 'what version of Windows are you running' will cease to make sense." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{the fourth}} San Diego case, the jury issued its verdict on June 2, 2008. This time both Microsoft and Lucent were {{asserting that the}} other side was {{infringing}} its patents. The jury found that Lucent did not infringe Microsoft's patents (and one patent was invalid) and <b>that</b> <b>Microsoft's</b> Xbox did not infringe Lucent's patent.|$|R
