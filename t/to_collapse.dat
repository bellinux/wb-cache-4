5|$|According to the {{documentary}} False Fire, Liu Chunling, the only self-immolator {{to have died}} on the scene, appears <b>to</b> <b>collapse</b> from being bludgeoned on {{the head by a}} man in military suit.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the area}} of a curve is reduced at a {{constant}} rate, and (by the isoperimetric inequality) a circle has the greatest possible area among simple closed curves of a given length, it follows that circles are the slowest curves <b>to</b> <b>collapse</b> to a point under the curve-shortening flow. All other curves take less time <b>to</b> <b>collapse</b> than a circle of the same length.|$|E
5|$|Before {{observations}} of dark energy, cosmologists considered two scenarios {{for the future}} of the universe. If the mass density of the universe were greater than the critical density, then the universe would reach a maximum size and then begin <b>to</b> <b>collapse.</b> It would become denser and hotter again, ending with a state similar to that in which it started—a Big Crunch.|$|E

5|$|In Bucharest, the {{earthquake}} had an estimated intensity of VIII–IX on the Mercalli scale. It toppled church steeples and caused Cotroceni Monastery <b>to</b> <b>collapse.</b> Numerous fires broke out, mainly from overturned stoves. In Bulgaria, {{the cities of}} Ruse, Varna and Vidin were almost completely destroyed. The force of {{the earthquake}} cracked walls {{as far north as}} Moscow.|$|E
5|$|In Macao, {{high winds}} from the typhoon uprooted trees and broke windows. Flooding {{triggered}} by Gordon's heavy rains stranded cars and inundated stores. Five of the colony's six casinoes were temporarily closed. Flooding also caused the Macau-Taipa bridge <b>to</b> <b>collapse.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the {{shortened}} 2011–12 NBA season, the Blazers {{got off to}} a 7–2 start. But {{the team}} quickly began <b>to</b> <b>collapse,</b> as starting point guard Raymond Felton, among others, struggled with McMillan's new approach to a running-style offense. The team gained some notability as Aldridge was named to his first All-Star Game. Despite Aldridge's performance, {{the rest of the team}} became more inconsistent.|$|E

5|$|July 18–20, 2015: The {{remnants}} of Hurricane Dolores brought scattered showers and thunderstorms throughout Southern California, breaking many rainfall records and causing flooding. One such flash flood caused a bridge <b>to</b> <b>collapse</b> which shut down Interstate 10 between Indio and Blythe, effectively shutting off the primary Phoenix-to-Los-Angeles route. The {{good news was}} that the rain helped firefighters contain the North Fire within 3 days.|$|E
5|$|May 9, 1980: A {{cargo ship}} {{collided}} with the Sunshine Skyway Bridge, near St. Petersburg, Florida, causing {{a part of the}} roadway <b>to</b> <b>collapse</b> and causing several vehicles, including a Greyhound bus, to fall into Tampa Bay. All 26 people aboard the bus died, as did nine others.|$|E
5|$|On September 22, 1915, {{there was}} an {{explosion}} during construction of the 23rd Street subway station that caused the tunnel <b>to</b> <b>collapse.</b> Seven people were killed after a blast of dynamite in the subway tunnel destroyed the plank roadway over Seventh Avenue. As a result, a crowded trolley car, and a brewery truck fell into the excavation, accounting for most of the injuries.|$|E
50|$|Major {{structural}} {{problems with the}} Stanwell Creek viaduct were identified in late 1985, with one span close <b>to</b> <b>collapsing</b> and another badly cracked, requiring substantial repairs and stabilising work.|$|R

5000|$|The {{differential}} bearings {{are prone}} <b>to</b> <b>collapsing</b> on early build units, {{resulting in the}} driveshaft CV joint grinding the gearbox casing away, and leading to complete failure. The early signs {{of this is that}} the speedometer drive fails.|$|R
5|$|Since 2011, the {{alliance}} has gained several large members but has lost others due <b>to</b> <b>collapse</b> or mergers. In August 2011, after several delays, Air India was rejected for membership, {{although it would}} eventually re-apply. On 13 December 2011, Ethiopian Airlines joined, adding five countries and 24 destinations to {{the alliance}}'s map.|$|E
5|$|Soils in the San Juan {{watershed}} {{are mostly}} sedimentary rock and are highly erosive, resulting in large alluvial deposits along floodplains. Soil {{types in the}} San Juan watershed {{can be divided into}} the Metz-San Emigdio, Sorrento-Mocho, Myford, Alo-Bosanko, Cieneba-Anaheim-Soper, and Friant-Cieneba-Exchequer associations, in order from low to high elevations. Steep hills in the San Juan watershed are prone <b>to</b> <b>collapse</b> during heavy rainfall or seismic activity.|$|E
5|$|With Weir (Torri Higginson) incapacitated, Sheppard (Joe Flanigan) {{is forced}} to take command of Atlantis. McKay (David Hewlett) determines that the power {{conduits}} are damaged, preventing Atlantis from completing its jump to the planet M12-578. While teams are sent to patch them up, the shield starts <b>to</b> <b>collapse,</b> resulting {{in the deaths of}} one team. McKay later decides <b>to</b> <b>collapse</b> the shield to cover the central tower in order to conserve power, and give Zelenka (David Nykl) time to patch up the conduits. However, the city approaches an asteroid belt, {{and the only way to}} go through without using up the power is for Sheppard to lead a fleet of Puddle Jumpers and clear a path. Although inexperienced, the pilots succeed, but impacts from the stragglers damage the stardrive control crystals, and they have to fix it before jumping again.|$|E
50|$|The {{economy of}} the town is {{concentrated}} in the weapons industry although {{the collapse of the}} communist regime in 1990 has caused production <b>to</b> <b>collapsed.</b> The industrial sector is also active through a small factory for the production of beer.|$|R
25|$|Applying {{standard}} diffraction {{techniques to}} crystal powders or polycrystals is tantamount <b>to</b> <b>collapsing</b> the 3D reciprocal space, as obtained via single-crystal diffraction, onto a 1D axis. The resulting partial-to-total overlap of symmetry-independent reflections renders the structure determination process more difficult, if not impossible.|$|R
50|$|The {{choice of}} the ordinal {{collapsing}} function given as example below imitates greatly the system introduced by Buchholz but is limited <b>to</b> <b>collapsing</b> one cardinal for clarity of exposition. More on the relation between this example and Buchholz's system will be said below.|$|R
5|$|A {{number of}} {{accidents}} {{took place at}} the bridge over the years, with vessels colliding with the piers due to the hazardous nature of the waterway. In 1960, two river barges hit one of the piers on the bridge, causing two spans <b>to</b> <b>collapse</b> into the river. Repair work was under consideration when a similar collision occurred the following year, after which it was decided that it would be uneconomical to repair the bridge. It was demolished between 1967 and 1970, with few traces remaining.|$|E
5|$|After 1530, it was {{the colonists}} {{themselves}} who held the keys to power, installing new governors and removing them from office. By 1534, the Spanish colony in Honduras was close <b>to</b> <b>collapse.</b> Trujillo had a population of less than two hundred; {{it was the}} only Spanish settlement in Honduras, and very little territory beyond the town itself had been conquered. The Spanish were beset by infighting, and had provoked widespread indigenous uprisings. Simultaneously, the native population had collapsed as a result of disease, mistreatment, and the export of large numbers to work on the sugar plantations of the Caribbean islands.|$|E
5|$|After fusing helium in {{its core}} to carbon, the Sun will begin <b>to</b> <b>collapse</b> again, {{evolving}} into a compact {{white dwarf star}} after ejecting its outer atmosphere as a planetary nebula. In 50 billion years, if the Earth and Moon are not engulfed by the Sun, they will become tidelocked, with each showing only one face to the other. Thereafter, the tidal action of the Sun will extract angular momentum from the system, causing the lunar orbit to decay and the Earth's spin to accelerate.|$|E
50|$|Chamas, {{particularly}} those that are informal and unregistered, {{have a reputation for}} problems with governance and mismanagement. Merry Go Round Chamas are subject <b>to</b> <b>collapsing</b> if one or more members collect early in the rotation, but drop out {{before the end of the}} rotation.|$|R
50|$|The {{airfield}} {{consists of}} 400 acre of well-drained short-mown grass, with three nominal runways (not marked) of 06/24, 13/31, 18/36, each 1000 m long. The airfield surface is bumpy in places, due <b>to</b> <b>collapsing</b> field drains, requiring care {{on the part}} of pilots operating aircraft in those areas.|$|R
50|$|According <b>to</b> {{objective}} <b>collapse</b> theories, {{wave function}} collapse {{occurs when a}} superposed systems reaches a certain objective threshold of size, complexity etc. Objective collapse proponentswould expect a system as macroscopic as a cat <b>to</b> have <b>collapsed</b> before the box was opened, so the question of observation-of-observers does not arise for them.|$|R
5|$|Ahead of the storm, high {{waves and}} gusty winds led to one {{drowning}} {{when a woman}} was knocked off a ferry in Takamatsu, Kagawa. A landslide in Miyazaki destroyed five homes, killing three people. A man who was listed as missing {{was found dead in}} a flooded rice field. In Tarumi, a landslide buried a home in mud, killing two people. Nabi caused a portion of the San'yō Expressway <b>to</b> <b>collapse</b> in Yamaguchi Prefecture, killing three people. In Fukui Prefecture, the winds knocked an elderly man off a bicycle, killing him. Overall, Nabi killed 29people in Japan and injured 179others, 45 of them severely. Damage was estimated at ¥94.9billion (US$854million).|$|E
5|$|Although Timoshenko's forces {{successfully}} regrouped on 21 May, {{he ordered}} a withdrawal of Army Group Kotenko {{by the end of}} 22 May, while he prepared an attack for 23 May, to be orchestrated by the 9th and 57th Armies. Although the Red Army desperately attempted to fend off advancing Wehrmacht and launched local counterattacks to relieve several surrounded units, they generally failed. By the end of May 24, Soviet forces opposite Kharkov had been surrounded by German formations, which had been able to transfer several more divisions to the front, increasing the pressure on the Soviet flanks and finally forcing them <b>to</b> <b>collapse.</b>|$|E
5|$|An English folk tale {{tells how}} an old woman, a {{supposed}} witch, cursed her landlord {{and all his}} possessions when he demanded the unpaid rent for her cottage. Soon afterwards, a large toad fell on his wife and caused her <b>to</b> <b>collapse.</b> The toad was thrown into the fire but escaped with severe burns. Meanwhile, the old witch's cottage had caught fire and she was badly burnt. By next day, both toad and witch had died, and {{it was found that}} the woman's burns exactly mirrored those of the toad.|$|E
