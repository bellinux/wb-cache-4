The current retention rate of young adults {{graduating from high school}} appears to be approximately 60%. The percentage of members attending services appears to be high relative to that of other Christian groups. Membership is concentrated, with 70% of the U.S. {{membership in}} 13 states. Churches of Christ had a presence in 2,429 counties, placing them fifth behind the United Methodist Church, Catholic Church, Southern Baptist Convention and Assemblies of God– but the average number of adherents per county was low at 677. <b>The</b> <b>divorce</b> <b>rate</b> was 6.9%, much lower than national averages.|$|E
5|$|Men have a {{unilateral}} right to divorce their wives (talaq) without needing any legal justification. The divorce is effective immediately. The husband's obligation is then to provide {{financial support for}} the divorced wife {{for a period of}} four months and ten days. A woman can only obtain a divorce with the consent of her husband or judicially if her husband has harmed her. In practice, it is very difficult for a Saudi woman to obtain a judicial divorce. <b>The</b> <b>divorce</b> <b>rate</b> is high, with 50% of marriages being dissolved. In the event of divorce, fathers have automatic custody of sons from the age of 7 and daughters from the age of 9. The right for men to marry up to four wives, combined with their ability to divorce a wife at any time without cause, can translate to unlimited polygamy. King Abdul Aziz, the founder of the country, reportedly admitted to marrying over two hundred women. However, his polygamy was considered extraordinary even by Saudi Arabian standards.|$|E
25|$|The {{average age}} of women for {{marriage}} increased from 16.9 years in 1951 to 22.5 years in 2005. A majority of women are married to their close relatives, i.e., first and second cousins. Only 37 percent of married women {{are not related to}} their spouses before marriage.

25|$|Criticisms of {{marriage}} are arguments against the practical or moral {{value of the}} institution of matrimony or particular forms of matrimony. These have included the effects that marriage has on individual liberty, equality between the sexes, the relation between marriage and violence, philosophical questions about how much control can a government have over its population, the amount of control a person has over another, the financial risk when measured against <b>the</b> <b>divorce</b> <b>rate,</b> and questioning of the necessity {{to have a relationship}} sanctioned by government or religious authorities.|$|E
25|$|Late-19th-century Utah {{also had}} the most liberal divorce laws in the United States at the time. The laws were {{advantageous}} to women: any woman who insisted on a divorce got one. One of Brigham Young's wives divorced him and launched a lucrative career as a public speaker. <b>The</b> <b>divorce</b> <b>rate</b> in late 19th-century Utah came close to 30 percent. This divorce rate was inflated by people from other states seeking an easy divorce in Utah. In 1896, Martha Hughes Cannon {{was the first woman}} in the nation elected to state senate.

The common citizen associated Brezhnev's rule more with its limitation than its actual progress: as a result, Brezhnev earned neither affection nor respect. Most Soviet citizens had no power to change the existing system, so most of them {{tried to make the}} best of a bad situation. Rates of alcoholism, mental illness, divorce and suicide rose inexorably during the Brezhnev era. Among ethnic Russians, <b>the</b> <b>divorce</b> <b>rate</b> by the late 70s was alarmingly high and 1 in 4 adults lived alone. Women lived particularly difficult lives as they performed most shopping, which could be an arduous task waiting in line for hours.

An overwhelming majority of Indians, with their consent, have their marriages arranged by their parents or other elders in the family. Marriage {{is thought to be}} for life, and <b>the</b> <b>divorce</b> <b>rate</b> is extremely low. , just 1.6 percent of Indian women were divorced but this figure was rising due to their education and economic independence. Child marriages are common, especially in rural areas; many women wed before reaching 18, which is their legal marriageable age. Female infanticide and female foeticide in the country have caused a discrepancy in the sex ratio, [...] it was estimated that there were 50 million more males than females in the nation. However a report from 2011 has shown improvement in the gender ratio. The payment of dowry, although illegal, remains widespread across class lines. Deaths resulting from dowry, mostly from bride burning, are on the rise, despite stringent anti-dowry laws.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1950s and '60s {{with the}} {{industrialization}} of Puerto Rico, women's job shifted from factory workers {{to that of}} professionals or office workers. Among the factors that influenced the role that women played in the industrial development of Puerto Rico was that <b>the</b> <b>divorce</b> <b>rate</b> was high and some women became the sole economic income source of their families. The feminist and women rights movements have also contributed to empowerment {{of women in the}} fields of business, the military and politics. They have also held positions of great importance in NASA as administrators and as scientist in the field of aerospace.|$|E

50|$|One {{measure of}} <b>divorces</b> is <b>the</b> crude <b>divorce</b> <b>rate,</b> which is <b>the</b> number of <b>divorces</b> per 1,000 population.

She explains: [...] "If {{a man is}} unemployed, brings in no income, spends what his wife earns or {{receives}} from social security on khat, will not help with domestic chores, and colludes with nagging in-laws — then a woman may feel better off without him". Writing in 2006, refugee education expert Jill Rutter reported that research suggested between 20 and 70 per cent of Somali households in Britain were headed by single females. In the 2011 Census, 61 per cent of families in England and Wales where {{the head of the}} household was born in Somalia consisted of lone parents with dependent children. This was the highest proportion of all countries of birth. 7.6 per cent of Somali-born lone parents were men, around half of the proportion of male lone parents in the population as a whole.|$|E
2500|$|Parisians under Napoleon married {{relatively}} old; {{the average}} age of marriage between 1789 and 1803 was between thirty and thirty-one for men and twenty-five to twenty-six for women. Unmarried couples living together in concubinage , especially in the working class, were also common. These couples were frequently stable and long-lasting; a third lived together for more than six years, twenty-two percent for more than nine years. Divorce had been common during the Revolution and the Consulate, when one in five marriages ended in divorce. Napoleon was in general hostile to divorces, though he himself divorced Empress Josephine. In 1804 <b>the</b> <b>divorce</b> <b>rate</b> had fallen to ten percent. The number of marriages increased greatly {{in the last years of}} the Empire, after the disastrous campaign in Russia, as many young men married to try to avoid military service.

50|$|<b>Divorce</b> <b>rates</b> {{have climbed}} in the European Union and the United States with {{increase}} in autonomous marriage <b>rates.</b> <b>The</b> lowest <b>divorce</b> <b>rates</b> in <b>the</b> world are in cultures with {{high rates of}} arranged marriages such as Amish culture of United States (1%), Hindus of India (3%), and Ultra-Orthodox Jews of Israel (7%).

2500|$|A {{potential}} important {{influence on}} adolescence is {{change of the}} family dynamic, specifically divorce. With <b>the</b> <b>divorce</b> <b>rate</b> up to about 50%, divorce is common and adds to the already great amount of change in adolescence. Custody disputes soon after a divorce often reflect a playing out of control battles and ambivalence between parents. Divorce usually results in less contact between the adolescent and their noncustodial parent. [...] In extreme cases of instability and abuse in homes, divorce can {{have a positive effect}} on families due to less conflict in the home. However, most research suggests a negative effect on adolescence as well as later development. A recent study found that, compared with peers who grow up in stable post-divorce families, children of divorce who experience additional family transitions during late adolescence, make less progress in their math and social studies performance over time. Another recent study put forth a new theory entitled the adolescent epistemological trauma theory, which posited that traumatic life events such as parental divorce during the formative period of late adolescence portend lifelong effects on adult conflict behavior that can be mitigated by effective behavioral assessment and training. A parental divorce during childhood or adolescence continues to have a negative effect when a person is in his or her twenties and early thirties. These negative effects include romantic relationships and conflict style, meaning as adults, they are more likely to use the styles of avoidance and competing in conflict management.|$|E
