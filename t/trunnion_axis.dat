50|$|Each {{front corner}} of the chassis was fitted with a swing-out A-frame boom {{equipped}} with a screw jack and foot plate. The booms enlarged the Meillerwagen footprint to stabilise it during erection of the rocket, and provided a means of adjusting the Meillerwagen transverse level. The booms deployed outward and forward of the lifting frame <b>trunnion</b> <b>axis</b> to prevent it toppling forward or to either side.|$|E
50|$|A modern {{theodolite}} {{consists of}} a movable telescope mounted within two perpendicular axes: the horizontal or <b>trunnion</b> <b>axis</b> and the zenith axis. A theodolite measures vertical angles as angles between the zenith, forwards or plunged—typically approximately 90 and 270 degrees. When the telescope is pointed at a target object, the angle {{of each of these}} axes can be measured with great precision, typically to milliradian or seconds of arc.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{attribute}} of a Dobsonian's mount {{is that it}} resembles a [...] "gun carriage" [...] configuration with a [...] "rocker box" [...] consisting of a horizontal <b>trunnion</b> style altitude <b>axis</b> and a broadly supported azimuth axis, both making use of material such as plastic, Formica, and Teflon to achieve smooth operation. Many derivative mount designs have kept this basic form while heavily modifying the materials and configuration.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{advances in}} terrestrial laser scanner systematic error modelling and self-calibration. The error model consists of 19 additional parameters grouped into two categories: physical and empirical. The physical group comprises known error {{sources such as}} rangefinder offset, cyclic errors, collimation axis error, <b>trunnion</b> <b>axis</b> error, vertical circle index error and others. The empirical terms lack ready physical explanation but nonetheless model significant errors. Results from self-calibration and an accuracy assessment experiment respectively show that up to 80 % and 36 % improvement was achieved {{as a result of}} using the correction models. Four other experiments designed to examine the influence of manufacturer’s correction parameters and centroid software as well as instrument biases are also described. The results from these tests reveal significant biases in some cases. 1...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The repair and/or {{replacement}} of lock culvert valves {{is an issue}} that many US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) offices are facing, partly because many of the navigation locks have reached or exceeded their design life. Reverse tainter valves are the most common valve type found on navigation locks constructed by the USACE (Pickett and Neilson 1988; Headquarters, USACE 1975). Many existing reverse tainter valves are of double-skin-plate construction, but several projects {{are in the process of}} replacing these valves with new valves of a vertically framed, single-skin design because they are easier to inspect and repair. The geometric and hydraulic parameters describing a reverse tainter valve are shown in Figure 1. Lock culvert flow is controlled by rotating the valve about the <b>trunnion</b> <b>axis.</b> The valve position is listed as the valve opening ratio b/B, where b is the distance from the valve lip to the culvert floor, and B is the culvert height at the valve.

40|$|Similar {{to other}} {{surveying}} instruments, the observed data from terrestrial laser scanner (TLS) can be impaired with errors. Then, calibration routine {{is necessary for}} the TLS to ensure the quality of the data and also to make it applicable for surveying applications. There are two calibration approaches available: 1) component, and 2) system calibration. Due to the requirement of special laboratories and tools to perform component calibration, then this approach cannot be implemented by most of the TLS users. In contrast, system calibration that can be performed through self-calibration is more convenient and the requirements (e. g. room with targets) are easier to be provided. Self-calibration bundle adjustment is carry out using measured spherical coordinates (e. g. distance, horizontal and vertical angles) as observations. In extension to the functional model of each observation, a set of calibration parameters was used, which were determined in a self-calibration procedure. These parameters are derived from wellknown error sources of geodetic instruments as constant (a 0), collimation axis (b 0), <b>trunnion</b> <b>axis</b> (b 1) and vertical circle index (c 0) errors. Self-calibration was performed for Leica ScanStation C 10 at laboratory with dimension 9 m × 7 m × 2. 6 m and 130 black and white targets were fairly distributed. Data obtained from seven scan station were processed and statistical analysis (e. g. t-test) has shown that only collimation axis (77. 1 ") and vertical circle index (- 62. 4 ") errors are significant for the calibrated scanner...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability to}} provide actual {{information}} and attractive presentation, three-dimensional (3 D) information has been widely used for many purposes especially for documentation, management and analysis. As a non-contact 3 D sensor, terrestrial laser scanners (TLSs) have the cap{{ability to provide}} dense of 3 D data (point clouds) with speed and accuracy. However, similar to other optical and electronic sensors, data obtained from TLSs can be impaired by errors coming from different sources. In order to ensure the high quality of the data, a calibration routine is crucial for TLSs to make it suitable for accurate 3 D applications (e. g. industrial measurement, reverse engineering and monitoring). There are two calibration approaches available: 1) component, and 2) system calibration. Due to the requirement of special laboratories and tools to perform component calibration, the task cannot be carried out by most TLSs users. In contrast, system calibration only requires a room with appropriate targets. Through self-calibration, this study involved a system calibration for Faro Photon 120 scanner in a laboratory with dimensions of 15. 5 m x 9 m x 3 m and 138 well-distributed planar targets. Four calibration parameters were derived from well-known error sources of geodetic instruments. Data obtained using seven scan stations were processed, and statistical analysis (e. g. t-test) shows that all error models, the constant error (8. 9 mm), the collimation axis error (- 4. 3 "), the <b>trunnion</b> <b>axis</b> error (- 11. 6 ") and the vertical circle index error (8. 0 ") were significant for the calibrated 3 D sensor...|$|E
