State media reports said the hospital was treating 55 survivors, including nine in serious condition. At least 70 people, and possibly more than 120 people {{were reported to have}} been injured. According to BBC News, people who survived the blaze were searching hospitals for missing family and friends. As of 24 November, 66 wounded people, 14 of which were in critical condition, were being treated at seven area medical centers. In all, nine hospitals received victims of the fire.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} serious crop {{failures}} in the late 19th century led to widespread famines on the subcontinent {{in which it is}} estimated <b>that</b> <b>over</b> 15 million people died. The East India Company had failed to implement any coordinated policy to deal with the famines during its period of rule. Later, under direct British rule, commissions were set up after each famine to investigate the causes and implement new policies, which took until the early 1900s to have an effect.|$|E

The Food and Agriculture Organization estimated in 2002 <b>that</b> <b>over</b> 50,000 {{medicinal plant}}s are used across the world.

5|$|Although {{opinions}} differed, some reactor experts feared <b>that</b> <b>over</b> {{time the}} hydrogen bubble might become flammable or, less likely, explosive by combining with free {{oxygen in the}} vessel.

Before moving to Belle Vue, Jennison, a part-time gardener, had run a small aviary at his home, the beginnings of the zoo <b>that</b> <b>over</b> the years grew to become the third-largest in the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|Bioinformatic screens have {{predicted}} <b>that</b> <b>over</b> 250 human proteins contain prion-like domains (PrLD). These domains are hypothesized {{to have the}} same transmissible, amyloidogenic properties of PrP and known fungal proteins. As in yeast, proteins involved in gene expression and RNA binding seem to be particularly enriched in PrLD's, compared to other classes of protein. In particular, 29 of the known 210 proteins with an RNA recognition motif also have a putative prion domain. Meanwhile, several of these RNA-binding proteins have been independently identified as pathogenic in cases of ALS, FTLD-U, Alzheimer's disease, and Huntington's disease.|$|E

5|$|Chinese media {{coverage}} of the Ürümqi riots was extensive, and was compared favourably to that of the unrest in Tibet in 2008. When the riots began, communications were immediately cut off. In the weeks that followed, official sources reported <b>that</b> <b>over</b> 1,000 Uyghurs were arrested and detained; Uyghur-run mosques were temporarily closed. The communication limitations and armed police presence remained in place as of January 2010. By November2009, over 400 individuals faced criminal charges for their actions during the riots. Nine were executed in November 2009, and by February 2010, at least 26 had received death sentences.|$|E
