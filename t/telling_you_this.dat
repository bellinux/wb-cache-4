She collaborated {{with him in}} the recording studio for a week on her debut album, signing with Cherrytree Records, an Interscope imprint established by producer and songwriter Martin Kierszenbaum; she also wrote four songs with Kierszenbaum. Despite securing a record deal, she said that some radio stations found her music too [...] "racy", [...] "dance-oriented", and [...] "underground" [...] for the mainstream market. The singer responded: [...] "My name is Lady Gaga, I've been on the music scene for years, and I'm <b>telling</b> <b>you,</b> <b>this</b> is what's next." ...|$|E
500|$|Killen {{conceived}} {{of the idea}} for the Brittens after creating and developing Lone Star for the Fox network. NBC had encouraged Killen to conceive a concept for a future television series after Lone Star cancellation. Within a few weeks, Killen sent a rough draft of the script to his agent Marc Korman. [...] "It was 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning, and I remember I was so freaked out by the script that I went upstairs to our guest bedroom where my wife was sick with the flu and I got into bed with her," [...] recalled Korman. [...] "I called Jen and said: 'I'm <b>telling</b> <b>you,</b> <b>this</b> script is remarkable. I've never read a pilot like this, and for a guy who has never written a procedural show in his life, he's actually making two cases work". Initially, Salke and Korman looked to sell acquisition rights to Fox.|$|E
500|$|In the Comines {{sector of}} the front there was an early fraternization between German and French {{soldiers}} in December 1914, during a short truce, and {{there are at least}} two other testimonials, from French soldiers, of similar behaviors in sectors where German and French companies opposed each other. [...] Gervais Morillon wrote to his parents: ‘The Boches waved a white flag and shouted [...] "Kamarades, Kamarades, rendez-vous." [...] When we didn’t move they came towards us unarmed, led by an officer. Although we are not clean they are disgustingly filthy. I am <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> but don’t speak of it to anyone. We must not mention it even to other soldiers.’ Gustave Berthier wrote: ‘On Christmas day the Boches made a sign showing they wished to speak to us. They said they didn’t want to shoot.... They were tired of making war, they were married like me, they didn’t have any differences with the French but with the English.’ ...|$|E

500|$|Robert K. Elder of the Chicago Tribune praised Rick Heinrichs's {{production}} design and Jim Carrey {{for having a}} balanced performance as a scene stealer. Elder called the film [...] "exceptionally clever, hilariously gloomy and bitingly subversive." [...] Desson Thomson from The Washington Post reasoned over a fellow film-goer's characterization of Count Olaf, [...] "Olaf is a humorless villain in the book. He's not amusing like Carrey at all. To which I would counter: If you can't let Carrey be Carrey, put someone boring and less expensive in the role. In his various disguises he's rubbery, inventive and improvisationally inspired. I particularly liked his passing imitation of a dinosaur." [...] Ty Burr, writing in The Boston Globe, observed, [...] "Director Brad Silberling has essentially made a Tim Burton movie without the weird shafts of adolescent pain. At the same time, Silberling's not a hack like Chris Columbus, and Snicket has more zip and inspired filmcraft than the first two Harry Potter films. The film's no masterpiece, but at least you're {{in the hands of}} people who know what they're doing. The movie, like the books, flatters children's innate sense that the world is not a perfect place and that anyone who insists otherwise is trying to sell you something. How you deal with the cognitive dissonance of a $125 million Hollywood picture <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> is up to you. At least there are no Lemony Snicket Happy Meals. Yet." [...] Internet reviewer James Berardinelli felt that [...] "the film is first and foremost a fantasy, but there are dark currents running just beneath the surface. I give Silberling credit for not allowing them to swallow the film. Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events manages to remain witty throughout." [...] Roger Ebert gave a mixed review: [...] "Jim Carrey is over the top as Count Olaf, but I suppose a character named Count Olaf is over the top by definition. I liked the film, but I'll tell you what. I think this one is a tune-up for the series, a trial run in which they figure out what works and what needs to be tweaked. The original Spider-Man was a disappointment, but the same team came back and made Spider-Man 2, the best superhero movie ever made." [...] Scott Foundas of Variety gave a negative review, criticizing the filmmakers for sacrificing the storyline in favor of visual elements such as set design and cinematography. He wrote, [...] "A Series of Unfortunate Events suggests what Mary Poppins might have looked like had Tim Burton directed it. Not surprisingly, Burton's longtime {{production design}}er Rick Heinrichs was responsible for the sets, while ace Emmanuel Lubezki (Burton's Sleepy Hollow) contributed the expressionistic lighting schemes." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{talk was}} unusual because it {{violated}} unofficial policy {{of not having}} top officials publicly criticize member nations. The interim US ambassador John R. Bolton, appointed by President George W. Bush, {{was reported to have}} told Annan on the phone: [...] "I've known you since 1989 and I'm <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> is the worst mistake by a senior UN official that I have seen in that entire time."

[...] Murphy described her performance as [...] "inspirational", but added, [...] "it was more than that. It was chilling.

2500|$|On 6 June 2006, while {{addressing}} {{a conference in}} New York City, he criticised the United States administration for allowing [...] "too much unchecked UN-bashing and stereotyping". He stated {{that much of the}} political dialogue in the US about the UN had been abdicated to its most strident critics, such as conservative talk-show host Rush Limbaugh and the Fox News cable channel and, as a result of this, the true role and value of the UN has become [...] "a mystery in Middle America". These remarks resulted in a backlash from the White House and some US conservative commentators, culminating in a call for an apology by the US envoy to the United Nations John Bolton. Bolton added to reporters, [...] "I spoke to the secretary-general this morning, I said [...] "I've known you since 1989 and I'm <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> is the worst mistake by a senior U.N. official that I have seen in that entire time." ...|$|E

2500|$|In late May 2002, Chrétien {{tried to}} curtail Martin's by-then open {{campaign}} for {{the leadership of the}} party by delivering a lecture to Cabinet to stop raising money for leadership bids within the Liberal Party. At what was described as a [...] "stormy" [...] Cabinet meeting on May 30, 2002, Chrétien stated that he intended to serve out his entire term, and ordered the end of all leadership fundraising. Martin left his cabinet on June 2, 2002. Martin claimed that Chrétien dismissed him from Cabinet, while Chrétien said that Martin had resigned. In his memoirs, Chrétien wrote that he regretted not having fired Martin a few years earlier. In the aftermath of Martin's departure from the Cabinet, there occurred an angry caucus meeting on June 5, 2002, where much of the caucus came out in support of Martin; demanded that he fire his much hated communications director Françoise Ducros, who many MPs claimed was impossible to work with, leading to a chorus of MPs chanting [...] "Bring back Peter, bring back Peter" [...] (a reference to Ducros's predecessor Peter Donolo); and several pro-Martin M.Ps asked forthright for Chrétien to resign. Liberal MP Dan McTeague told Chrétien that [...] "You made a decision for Paul Martin. You should make the same decision for yourself". Many of the MPs accused the PMO of riding roughshod over them, and accused the prime minister of being a bully. Liberal MP Carolyn Parrish recalled about that caucus meeting that she could not believe that [...] "these ungrateful sons of bitches", as she called the pro-Martin MPs, would attack Chrétien at a caucus meeting so openly. For Chrétien's reaction, Parrish stated: [...] "His face was evil. His eyes were like a shark's eyes", and she could not understand why he didn't walk out, saying [...] "Any other person would have, especially knowing that most of those assholes <b>telling</b> <b>you</b> <b>this</b> couldn't get elected dog catcher if they weren't on a Liberal ticket riding on your coattails".|$|E
