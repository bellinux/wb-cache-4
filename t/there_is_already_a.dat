5|$|Longleat Estate has fenced off a {{large part}} of its land and has {{introduced}} goats, as part of a programme to encourage the biodiversity of the area; the goats were intended to replace the sheep that grazed in the gorge until the 1970s. The National Trust announced in March 2007 that it plans to release a flock of sheep on its side of the gorge for the same purpose, but will first consult local residents and interested parties on whether to fence off the gorge or introduce cattle grids to prevent the sheep from straying. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> <b>a</b> small flock of feral Soay sheep in the gorge.|$|E
5|$|After Kosovo's {{declaration}} of independence from Serbia in 2008, its broadcaster Radio Television of Kosovo (RTK) applied for EBU membership, and wished to enter Kosovo into Eurovision Song Contest 2009. Kosovo would have made their Eurovision Song Contest debut in 2009 if it could have joined the EBU. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> <b>a</b> cooperation agreement signed between the EBU and RTK and the EBU supports the membership of RTK. As of 2013, RTK has observer status within the EBU and did participate in the Eurovision Young Dancers 2011. According to the Kosovan newspaper Koha Ditore, a possible entry would be selected via a national final called Akordet e Kosovës, a former pop show that had been taken off the air some years ago.|$|E

25|$|In 1836, rural Olive Township {{was formed}} in western Elkhart County, and in 1849, as the {{population}} grew, a post office named Mt. Olive opened. After more population growth, a new village named Salem was established to prevent people from having to travel to either Goshen or Elkhart to conduct business. Since <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> <b>a</b> town named Salem in Indiana, the name was changed to Wakarusa in 1859. The Mt. Olive Post Office was renamed for Wakarusa a year later.|$|E
25|$|Seen another way, {{patients}} with heart, liver, lung, or kidney failure have a dismal prognosis for survival, so the toxicity associated with immunosuppression is warranted (the benefits of graft survival outweigh {{the risks associated}} with the medications). But for the subset of {{patients with}} diabetes and preserved kidney function, even those with long-standing and difficult-to-control disease, the prognosis for survival is comparatively much better. In addition to the immunosuppressive toxicities, other risks are associated with the islet transplant procedure itself, including intra-abdominal hemorrhage following the transplant, and portal vein thrombosis. The fact that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> <b>a</b> good alternative to islet transplantation (i.e. the modern intensive insulin regimen) forces us to regard any newer, riskier interventions with a critical eye.|$|E

500|$|Cholangiocarcinoma is {{considered}} to be an incurable and rapidly lethal disease unless all the tumors can be fully resected (cut out surgically). Since the operability of the tumor can only be assessed during surgery in most cases, a majority of patients undergo exploratory surgery unless <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> <b>a</b> clear indication that the tumor is inoperable. [...] However, the Mayo Clinic has reported significant success treating early bile duct cancer with liver transplantation using a protocolized approach and strict selection criteria.|$|E

In reality, there was a hole which was indeed one floor deep. The 3D dimensional effect was computer generated and made by the team who also made the film Batman & Robin.

2500|$|The [...] "green" [...] (southern) type uses no {{additional}} letters beyond the Phoenician set, and typically also goes without Ξ (/ks/). Thus, the aspirated plosives /pʰ/, /kʰ/ are spelled either simply as Π and Κ respectively, without a distinction from unaspirated /p/, /k/, or as digraphs ΠΗ, ΚΗ. (However, for the analogous /tʰ/ <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> <b>a</b> dedicated letter, Θ, taken from Phoenician.) Likewise, the clusters /ps/, /ks/ are simply spelled ΠΣ, ΚΣ. This {{is the system}} found in Crete and in some other islands in the southern Aegean, notably Thera (Santorini), Melos and Anaphe.|$|E
2500|$|Landscape painting, {{also known}} as {{landscape}} art, is the depiction in art of landscapes – natural scenery such as mountains, valleys, trees, rivers, and forests, especially where the main subject is a wide view – with its elements arranged into a coherent composition. In other works, landscape backgrounds for figures can still form {{an important part of}} the work. Sky is almost always included in the view, and weather is often an element of the composition. [...] Detailed landscapes as a distinct subject are not found in all artistic traditions, and develop when <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> <b>a</b> sophisticated tradition of representing other subjects.|$|E
2500|$|The nobility {{were the}} first to show their regained power. A typical example is the Palace of the Marqueses da Fronteira in Benfica (Lisbon) (started in 1667). [...] This country manor house still follows Italian Mannerism examples, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> <b>a</b> heavy {{influence}} of the Baroque style in the perfect harmony {{of the house and the}} surrounding gardens, the splendour of the staircase and the many iconographic, decorative elements in the rooms. The large azulejos (tile panels) covering the walls with equestrian portraits, historical battle scenes or trumpet-blowing monkeys, created by the workshops of Jan van Oort and Willem van der Kloet in Amsterdam, are unique.|$|E

2500|$|Coincidental (or [...] "matching") minor {{penalties}} {{occur when}} {{an equal number}} of players from each team are given a minor penalty at the same time. The permission of a substitute player depends on the league and the situation {{at the time of the}} infractions. [...] In some leagues, such as the NHL, the teams will play four-on-four for the duration of the penalties if they occurred when both teams were at even strength. [...] However, if <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> <b>a</b> manpower differential, then both teams are allowed to make substitutions while the penalized players will remain in the penalty box until the first stoppage in play after their penalty expires. [...] In other competitions, such as IIHF events, coincidental penalties do not affect manpower in any situation. Coincidental minor penalties are not ended when a goal is scored by either team.|$|E
2500|$|The {{proposed}} {{park has}} been criticized by transit advocates such as the Queens Public Transit Committee, who prefer to rebuild the rail line as a proposed expansion of the New York City Subway. More than 322,000 people live within one mile of the Rockaway Beach Branch, combined {{with the fact that}} New York City Subway service in the area is limited, with only the BMT Jamaica Line (...) passing through the neighborhood. Another argument is that the Queensway would pass through Forest Park, where <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> <b>a</b> large [...] park. There is also heavy opposition from residents, who fear that their privacy would be invaded and that their rents would be raised {{as a result of the}} Queensway. A new subway line, on the other hand, would connect the IND Queens Boulevard Line (...) at Queens Boulevard, with the [...] running south of Liberty Avenue.|$|E
2500|$|The Court's {{observation}} {{that there was}} no substantive difference between allowing the State to amend its answer and simply dismissing sua sponte was characterized by Scalia as [...] "what appears to be the chief ground of its decision." [...] Scalia argued that if there was truly no [...] "dispositive difference" [...] between the alternatives, [...] "the natural conclusion would be that there is no compelling reason to disregard the Civil Rules. [...] Legislatively enacted rules are surely entitled to more respect than this apparent presumption that, when nothing substantial hangs on the point, they do not apply as written." [...] At a minimum, Scalia believed it [...] "a nontrivial value in itself" [...] to [...] "observe the formalities of our adversary system" [...] by requiring the State to amend its own pleading. [...] Scalia also observed that in contrast to the [...] "novel regime" [...] adopted by the majority, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> <b>a</b> well-developed body of law regarding whether a party should have leave to amend a pleading. [...] "Ockham is offended by today's decision, even if no one else is." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Weberian {{overture}} in E major, the key {{in which}} the opera begins and ends, includes many of the opera's principal themes. The work as a whole {{does not have the}} complex chains of melody and chromatic harmony that distinguished the composer's mature works. However, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> <b>a</b> tendency in the opera to move away from a strict numbers form and to present the singers with long challenging passages. Recurring themes or simple leitmotifs associated with characters and situations already show a tendency towards something that Wagner would later use in a far more sophisticated manner in his mature works. Another anticipation of the composer's mature manner is how orchestra often carries the tune while vocal parts are declamatory. Of the various arias, Blyth picks out Ada's [...] "huge Act 2 scene, which calls for a genuine dramatic soprano" [...] noting that Birgit Nilsson had recorded it. He sees the ensembles as anticipating Tannhäuser and Lohengrin but picks out [...] "the delightful buffo duet for Gernot... and Drolla", saying it looks forward more to Das Liebesverbot [...] "except that it surpasses in unassuming tunefulness anything in the following score".|$|E
2500|$|Culture {{is a set}} {{of values}} and {{practices}} that create meaning for society. [...] This includes both high culture (literature, art, and education, which appeals to elites) and popular culture (appeals to the masses). [...] This is what governments seek to show foreign audiences when engaging in cultural diplomacy. [...] It is a type of soft power, which is the [...] "ability to get what you want through attraction rather than coercion or payments. [...] It arises from a country's culture, political ideals and policies." [...] This indicates that the value of culture is its ability to attract foreigners to a nation. [...] Cultural diplomacy is also a component of public diplomacy. [...] Public diplomacy is enhanced by a larger society and culture, but simultaneously public diplomacy helps to [...] "amplify and advertise that society and culture to the world at large". [...] It could be argued that the information component of public diplomacy can only be fully effective where <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>already</b> <b>a</b> relationship that gives credibility to the information being relayed. [...] This comes from knowledge of the other's culture." [...] Cultural diplomacy has been called the [...] "linchpin of public diplomacy" [...] because cultural activities have the possibility to demonstrate the best of a nation. [...] In this way, cultural diplomacy and public diplomacy are intimately linked.|$|E
