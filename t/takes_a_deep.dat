500|$|Townsend {{described}} Ki as {{both the}} introduction and the moral to the [...] "larger concept" [...] of the Devin Townsend Project. The album's lyrical themes explore Townsend's inner demons, past addictions, self-acceptance, and his [...] "newfound ability to say no." [...] The album opens with a brief instrumental that leads into [...] "Coast", a quiet, bass-driven track that {{sets the stage for}} the album as a [...] "metaphor for Devin's newfound restraint." [...] Townsend described it as [...] "the intro to the story, quiet, dark, haunted and unsure". The track builds in intensity toward the end with layers of vocals, but rather than exploding into Strapping Young Lad–style metal, fades into [...] "loose, bluesy guitar work". [...] "Disruptr" [...] has been described as [...] "a coffee-house metal track", contrasting light instrumentation with heavy metal–style songwriting and vocals in a way that one critic compared to Talking Heads. [...] "Gato" [...] proceeds in a similar vein, but is set apart with backing vocals by Dorval. [...] "Disruptr" [...] and [...] "Gato" [...] continue the musical theme; each song builds in intensity toward the end but [...] "stops and <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> breath" [...] before proceeding. The album then fades into [...] "Terminal", an atmospheric track with quiet vocals that was co-written by keyboardist Dave Young.|$|E

60|$|Archie {{was not a}} {{man with}} a wide visiting-list among people with families, and it was so long since he had seen a growing boy in action at the table that he had {{forgotten}} what sixteen is capable of doing with a knife and fork, when it really squares its elbows, <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>deep</b> breath, and gets going. The spectacle which he witnessed was consequently at first a little unnerving. The long boy's idea of trifling with a meal appeared to be to swallow it whole and reach out for more. He ate like a starving Eskimo. Archie, in the time he had spent in the trenches making the world safe for the working-man to strike in, had occasionally been quite peckish, but he sat dazed before this majestic hunger. This was real eating.|$|E
