5|$|Lamason then {{instructed}} the group not {{to trust the}} SS, or provoke {{them in any way}} because as they had experienced on the train, the guards were unpredictable and trigger-happy. Also, they were not to explore the camp because of the chance of breaking unknown rules, but <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>together</b> and keep as far away from the guards as possible. He further stated that acting on the group's behalf, he would make further contact with the camp authorities for recognition of their rights.|$|E
5|$|By the 2000s, the Rohm and Haas Corporate Headquarters needed {{upgrades}} to its building {{systems and}} facilities. The company {{spent two years}} deciding whether to renovate its current building or to move to cheaper, more modern space in Center City. In 2006 Rohm and Haas decided {{to stay in the}} current building and spend up to US$25 million on renovations. The building's architecture and layout were the main reason for the company to stay. The building allows single departments <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>together</b> on the same floor, while in a Center City skyscraper departments would likely have to be spread out over several floors.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{originally}} {{having an}} unorthodox start, {{since all the}} band members were part of and busy with other projects {{at the time of}} the band's founding, Crippled Black Phoenix remained committed <b>to</b> <b>staying</b> <b>together</b> and forged their sound. The band writes what they call [...] "endtime ballads," [...] signifying both the slightly macabre nature of their songs and their unusual blend of styles as the final evolution in music. This blend has led to them being called everything from stoner-prog to freak-folk to doom.|$|R
5|$|After 10 days of {{questioning}} Winter {{was taken to}} Rennes, where he was joined three days later by Captain Burton, Hollings, and Orr. These three had managed <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>together</b> when the boat was sunk, and were captured by a German parachute unit carrying out manoeuvres. Burton {{was sent to a}} prisoner of war camp in Germany, Winter, Hollings and Orr were taken to Frankfurt and handed over to the Gestapo for further questioning, after which Winter was sent to a prisoner of war camp at Memmingen. The fate of Hollings and Orr has never been established. Winter and a Special Air Service officer escaped from the camp in April 1945, disguised as French soldiers. Desgranges was also able to escape from captivity, travelling via Spain to Britain, where he joined the Special Operations Executive (SOE).|$|E
5|$|Carol buys a car, and the McCoys {{drive to}} an {{electronics}} store. As Doc buys a portable radio, he switches {{off the television}} set near the proprietor's desk broadcasting {{the news of the}} earlier incidents they were involved in. Suddenly, all the television sets in the store show Doc's picture, prompting him to leave immediately. The proprietor gets a glimpse of the picture, and calls the police. Doc steals a shotgun, followed by several shoot-outs and police chases. The couple escape by hiding in a large trash bin, only to end up {{in the back of a}} garbage truck that dumps its load at the local landfill. Filthy and frustrated, they argue about whether <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>together</b> or split up. They decide to see things through.|$|E
5|$|In the Operations notes, Formation Flying, orders {{specifically}} {{stated that}} the formation, as a whole, was not <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>together,</b> saying each six aircraft section {{was to be a}} self-contained defensive unit, flying at different heights, stating that more than 12 aircraft per formation made it unwieldy and unmanageable by one leader. Even so, the notes also pointed to the importance of holding a formation within one's own section. If a section leader endeavoured to follow the formation leader (Wing Commander Kellet) to the detriment of their section, the formation would break apart. Bomber formations were built on the idea of mutual protection; if the formation came apart, each bomber would have to fend for itself, which would enable an enemy to pick off the bombers one by one. Squadron Leaders Guthrie and Hue-Williams did not heed this advice during the battle. Wing Commander Kellett had followed the notes, and he lost only one aircraft. Harris had also kept his formation together, and lost none of his Wellingtons. Within a few weeks, a debate began on shifting air attacks to the cover of darkness, with Hewitt favouring this alternative.|$|E

40|$|How do {{social network}} {{structures}} of teams, leaders and members help or hinder effectiveness? We {{answer that question}} via a meta-analysis of 31 studies with 67 effect sizes spanning six decades and involving 2618 teams working in natural contexts. Teams with dense rather than sparse configurations of interpersonal ties better attain their goals (team task performance), and are more committed <b>to</b> <b>staying</b> <b>together</b> (team viability). In addition, teams with leaders who are central in the intrateam network, and teams that are central in the intergroup network, {{tend to be more}} productive. Temporal features and the content of ties moderate social network [...] team task performance connections. Results augur for stronger incorporation of network concepts into theories about team effectiveness...|$|R

5|$|Shortly afterwards, the {{men were}} split up and sent to various {{locations}} to serve as forced labourers. The majority of the 2/18th's personnel were sent to Blakang Mati, but some remained in Changi, while others were sent to Japan or were sent {{to work on the}} Thai–Burma Railway. A total of 174 men were sent to Borneo where in 1945 they were subjected to the Sandakan Death Marches, which only about ten percent of the 2/18th men survived. Despite being separated, though, wherever possible the 2/18th men sought <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>together</b> in their groups and the battalion structure was maintained even in captivity. The battalion's first commanding officer, Varley, was one of those sent to Burma where, as senior Allied officer, he worked to secure the welfare of over 9,000 men working on the railway, including many from the 2/18th. He was later sent to Thailand before being brought back to Singapore once work was completed. In late 1944 he was transferred to Formosa. On 12 September, while en route, the transport ship—Rakuyo Maru—that he and around 1,250 other prisoners were on, was torpedoed by a US submarine, USS Sealion. Varley took charge of several lifeboats of prisoners during the evacuation, attempting to lead them to safety. They were never seen again and are believed to have been machine-gunned several days later by Japanese frigates that were in the area.|$|E

25|$|The Gender Recognition Act 2004 allows {{transgender}} {{people to}} change their legal gender.

25|$|However, the peloton proved <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>together</b> all the {{way until}} the Champs-Élysées, except for brief escapes to nab the final {{intermediate}} sprint and two small climbs. Tradition held up; Discovery successfully led Contador onto the famous street before the sprinting began. Freddy Bichot briefly got away on the second circuit. Chris Horner of Cadel Evans' Predictor-Lotto team tried to get away soon after, but the peloton was much less willing to let him leave. When Alejandro Valverde and Axel Merckx counter-attacked Bichot {{to bring him back}} into the field, Discovery faded back.|$|E

60|$|As I {{went along}} Houndsditch one morning about eight o'clock {{there was a}} great noise.

But the outcry was loud enough to prompt my curiosity, and I called to one that looked out of a window, and asked what was the matter.|$|R

25|$|In {{the early}} years of the Tour, cyclists rode individually, and were {{sometimes}} forbidden to ride together. This led to large gaps between the winner and the number two. Since the cyclists now tend <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>together</b> in a peloton, the margins of the winner have become smaller, as the difference usually originates from time trials, breakaways or on mountain top finishes, or from being left behind the peloton. The smallest margins between the winner and the second placed cyclists at the end of the Tour is 8s between winner Greg LeMond and Laurent Fignon in 1989. The largest margin, by comparison, remains that of the first Tour in 1903: 2h 49m 45s between Maurice Garin and Lucien Pothier.|$|E

25|$|Polygyny once {{practiced by}} leaders has nearly disappeared, {{possibly}} {{from the pressure}} missionaries put on them. Most marriages are now consecrated by a Catholic priest. Divorce is not uncommon and is initiated by either spouse.

Often {{a man who is}} leader will surround his large house with smaller homes for his sons' and daughters' families.
