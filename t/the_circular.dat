40|$|We {{compute the}} {{principal}} Lyapunov exponent and Kolmogorov-Sinai(KS) entropy for Kerr-Newman black hole space-times and investigate {{the stability and}} instability of <b>the</b> equatorial <b>circular</b> geodesics via these exponents. We also show that the principal Lyapunov exponent and KS entropy can be {{expressed in terms of}} the radial equation of ISCO(innermost stable circular orbit) for timelike <b>circular</b> geodesics. <b>The</b> other aspect we have studied that among <b>the</b> all possible <b>circular</b> geodesics, which encircle the central black-hole, <b>the</b> timelike <b>circular</b> geodesics has <b>the</b> longest orbital period i. e. T_{timelike} > T_{photon}, than <b>the</b> null <b>circular</b> geodesics (photon sphere) as measured by asymptotic observers. Thus, <b>the</b> timelike <b>circular</b> geodesics provide <b>the</b> slowest way to circle the Kerr-Newman black-hole.

5|$|A notable {{feature of}} Bolliger & Mabillard roller {{coasters}} is the box-section track.

When a train travels around a box-section track, it creates a distinctive roaring sound, which is unique to this style of track. However, on some Bolliger & Mabillard roller coasters, such as Talon at Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom, and Gatekeeper at Cedar Point the track is filled with sand to reduce this noise.|$|E

5|$|Another {{improvement}} {{from the}} 12th century onwards {{was the creation}} of shell keeps, involving replacing the wooden keep on the motte with a circular stone wall. Buildings could be built around the inside of the shell, producing a small inner courtyard. Restormel Castle {{is a classic example of}} this development with a perfectly circular wall and a square entrance tower while the later Launceston Castle, although more ovoid than circular, is another good example of the design and one of the most formidable castles of the period. Round castles were unusually popular throughout Cornwall and Devon. Although <b>the</b> <b>circular</b> design held military advantages, these only really mattered in the 13th century onwards; the origins of 12th-century circular design were <b>the</b> <b>circular</b> design of the mottes; indeed, some designs were less than circular in order to accommodate irregular mottes, such as that at Windsor Castle.|$|E

5|$|Immediately upon {{taking his}} seat in the Senate, Crittenden {{was named to the}} Committee on Public Lands and the Committee on the Judiciary, {{probably}} due to Clay's influence. Early in his term, Crittenden vociferously opposed Senator Thomas H. Benton's proposal to spend the federal budget surplus on public land graduation and military fortifications along the eastern seaboard. He also blasted the Jackson administration for issuing the Specie Circular, requiring that all payment for government land be made in gold or silver. He pointed out that the principles of <b>the</b> <b>circular</b> had been presented in a resolution on the Senate floor, but had been tabled by a large majority. Crittenden maintained that the tabling of the resolution was a condemnation by the Senate, yet the administration issued <b>the</b> <b>circular</b> only months later, overstepping, as Crittenden saw it, the bounds of the executive branch's authority. Crittenden debated the issue at length with Senator Benton, and Congress ultimately passed a bill requiring the government to accept the notes of specie-paying banks for the purchase of government lands, but President Jackson employed his pocket veto to prevent it from becoming law.|$|E
