5|$|As deduced {{from the}} {{presence}} of freshwater molluscs, Lake Cahuilla was a freshwater lake during its highstand, while lower lake level stages show fossil evidence of increased salinity. Alternatively the lake may have been brackish. The salinity may have been lower where the Colorado entered <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>and</b> higher farther north.|$|E
5|$|Floating gardens, {{labelled}} the 'Rad' in tye Kashmiri {{language are}} a special {{feature of the}} lake. They basically constitute of matted vegetation and earth, but are floating. These are detached {{from the bottom of}} <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>and</b> drawn to a suitable place (generally to the north west of the houseboats' location) and anchored. Given its rich nutrient properties, tomatoes, cucumbers and melons are grown with noteworthy results.|$|E

5|$|Mono Lake {{itself has}} {{its own set of}} activities, {{including}} walking tours among towers of tufa, boat tours of <b>the</b> <b>lake,</b> <b>and</b> birdwatching opportunities. The lake is too salty to support any fish, but fishing is possible in streams that feed Mono Lake. Additional activities include hiking around and on the craters and domes, and mountain biking outside of the Scenic Area boundaries.|$|E
5|$|Most of the salts {{dissolved}} in <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>and</b> {{deposited in the}} desert flats around it reflect the concentration of solutes by evaporation; Lake Bonneville itself was fresh enough to support populations of fish. More salt is added yearly via rivers and streams, though the amount is {{much less than the}} relict salt from Bonneville.|$|E

5|$|The Rajput {{rulers of}} Amber, Bundi, Bikaner and Jaisalmer made great efforts {{to restore the}} {{importance}} of <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>and</b> its surrounding temples.

5|$|The lake effect snowfalls {{are more}} likely to occur in late fall, early winter, and during spring due to the higher {{temperature}} differences between <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>and</b> the air above it. During summer, the temperature differences can cause thunderstorms to form over <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>and</b> drift eastward along the northern Wasatch Front. Some rainstorms may also be partially attributed to the lake effect in fall and spring. It is estimated that approximately six to eight lake effect snowstorms occur in a year, and that 10% of the average precipitation of Salt Lake City {{can be attributed to the}} lake effect.|$|E
5|$|The lake {{within the}} park is at an {{elevation}} of about , and the park itself sits in a natural basin. The basin and the underlying sandstone trap water and thus form <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>and</b> surrounding bogs. The higher elevation leads to a cooler climate, and the basin helps trap denser, cooler air, leading to longer winters and milder summers.|$|E

A ditch and outlet drainage structure made of concrete at Wardens Place drains into the lake; its purpose is to control small-scale local road flooding.|$|E
5|$|A story {{tells of}} a ninth-century Rajput king, Nahar Rao Parihar of Mandore, chasing a white boar to the lake shore on a hunting expedition.

Car parking is available at the visitor centre and Woodford Lodge, for which a charge is made, and a small amount of parking is available at points around the lake; some of these are restricted to those with fishing permits.|$|E
5|$|During this time, the Molonglo River {{flowed through}} the flood basin, {{with only a}} small {{fraction}} of the water envisaged in Griffin's plan. The centre of his capital city consisted of mostly farmland, with small settlements—mostly wooden, temporary and ad hoc—on either side. There was little evidence that Canberra was planned, and <b>the</b> <b>lake</b> <b>and</b> Parliamentary Triangle at the heart of Griffin's plan was but a paddock. Royal Canberra Golf Course, and Acton Racecourse and a sports ground were located on the pastoral land that was to become the West Lake, and people had to disperse the livestock before playing sport. A rubbish dump stood on the northern banks of the location of central basin, and no earth had been moved since Griffin's departure three decades earlier.|$|E
5|$|For {{safety and}} water quality reasons, the lake has {{different}} zones for different activities. The eastern extremity is zoned for primary contact water activities such as swimming and water skiing. The East and Central Basins, closer to populated areas, are zoned for secondary contact water sports such as sailing or rowing. West Lake and Tarcoola Reach, which covers the area between Commonwealth Avenue and Kurrajong Point, is the primary recreational area of <b>the</b> <b>lake,</b> <b>and</b> both primary and secondary contact water sports are permitted. Yarramundi Reach near Scrivener Dam has a marked rowing course, and is zoned as secondary, although primary contact activities are also allowed.|$|E
