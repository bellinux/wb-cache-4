Interestingly, <b>T-channels</b> are reexpressed in hypertrophied or failing hearts. It {{is unclear whether}} <b>T-channels</b> {{play a role in}} the pathogenesis of cardiomyopathy and what the mechanism might be. Here we show that the 1 H voltage-gated T-type Ca 2 channel (Cav 3. 2) is involved in the pathogenesis of cardiac hypertrophy via the activation of calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) pathway. Specifically, pressure overload–induced hypertrophy was severely suppressed in mice deficient for Cav 3. 2 (Cav 3. 2 /) but not in mice deficient for Cav 3. 1 (Cav 3. 1 /). Angiotensin II–induced cardiac hypertrophy was also suppressed in Cav 3. 2 / mice. Consistent with these findings, cultured neonatal myocytes isolated from Cav 3. 2 / mice fail to respond hypertrophic stimulation by treatment with angiotensin II. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of Cav 3. 2 in the development of cardiac hypertrophy both in vitro and in vivo. To test whether Cav 3. 2 mediates the hypertrophic response through the calcineurin/NFAT pathway, we generated Cav 3. 2 /, NFAT-luciferase reporter mice and showed that NFAT-luciferase reporter activity failed to increase after pressure overload in the Cav 3. 2 //NFAT-Luc mice. Our results provide strong genetic evidence that Cav 3. 2 indeed plays a pivotal role in the induction of calcineurin/NFAT hypertrophic signaling and is crucial for the activation of pathological cardiac hypertrophy.

Here, we recorded T-currents and underlying low-threshold calcium spikes from neurons of nucleus reticularis thalami (nRT) in brain slices from young rats and investigated the mechanisms of their modulation by an anesthetic alcohol, 1 -octanol. We found that 1 -octanol inhibited native T-currents at subanesthetic concentrations with an IC 50 of approximately 4 μM. In contrast, 1 -octanol was up to 30 -fold less potent in inhibiting recombinant CaV 3. 3 <b>T-channels</b> heterologously expressed in human embryonic kidney cells.

To explore the mechanisms underlying higher 1 -octanol potency in inhibiting native nRT T-currents, we tested the effect of the protein kinase C (PKC) activator phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate (PMA) and PKC inhibitors. We found that PMA caused a modest increase of T-current, whereas the inactive PMA analog 4 α-PMA failed to affect T-current in nRT neurons. In contrast, 12 -(2 -cyanoethyl) - 6, 7, 12, 13 -tetrahydro- 13 -methyl- 5 -oxo- 5 H-indolo(2, 3 -a) pyrrolo(3, 4 -c) -carbazole (Go 6976), an inhibitor of calcium-dependent PKC, decreased baseline T-current amplitude in nRT cells and abolished the effects of subsequently applied 1 -octanol.

40|$|Our {{interest}} {{was drawn to}} the I–II loop of CaV 3 channels for two reasons: (1) transfer of the I–II loop from a high voltage-activated channel (CaV 2. 2) to a low voltage-activated channel (CaV 3. 1) unexpectedly produced an ultra-low voltage activated channel; and (2) sequence variants of the I–II loop found in childhood absence epilepsy patients altered channel gating and increased surface expression of CaV 3. 2 channels. To determine the roles of this loop we have studied the structure of the loop and the biophysical consequences of altering its structure. Deletions localized the gating brake to the first 62 amino acids after IS 6 in all three CaV 3 channels, establishing the evolutionary conservation of this region and its function. Circular dichroism was performed on a purified fragment of the I–II loop from CaV 3. 2 to reveal a high α-helical content. De novo computer modeling predicted the gating brake formed a helix-loop-helix structure. This model was tested by replacing the helical regions with poly-proline-glycine (PGPGPG), which introduces kinks and flexibility. These mutations had profound effects on channel gating, shifting both steady-state activation and inactivation curves, as well as accelerating channel kinetics. Mutations designed to preserve the helical structure (poly-alanine, which forms α-helices) had more modest effects.

Primary cultured myoblasts {{were kept in}} fusion medium (0 – 6 days) in either the absence (control conditions) or the presence of 40 pm TGF-β 1 or 5 nm BMP- 2. Subsequently, the developing myotubes were transferred to a growth factor-free recording solution, and subjected to whole cell patch-clamp experiments. At day 0, 14 % of non-fusing myoblasts exhibited T-current, whereas the L-current was practically absent. Under control conditions, however, the percentage of T- and L-channel-expressing myotubes increased sharply, from 25 % at day 1 to ∼ 100 % at days 2 – 6. In addition, parallel increases were determined for Ca 2 +-currents density and cell membrane capacitance (Cm), which {{is proportional to the}} size of myotubes. Interestingly, at days 1 – 2 TGF-β 1 and BMP- 2 eliminated the T-current on initial 14 % of T-channel-expressing myoblasts. Moreover, at day 6 the growth factors significantly reduced the maximal values of both T-current density (80 %) and Cm (60 %). The effect of BMP- 2 was selective on <b>T-channels,</b> whereas TGF-β 1 decreased also the L-current density (90 %). A similar reduction in maximal conductance of the Ca 2 + channels was determined, in the absence of significant alterations in other essential properties of the channels, including the time course and voltage dependence of activation and inactivation. The results suggest these growth factors markedly reduce the number of functional T- (both TGF-β 1 and BMP- 2) and L-channels (only TGF-β 1) in the surface of the plasma membrane, and contribute to explaining the associated effects on myogenesis...|$|R
