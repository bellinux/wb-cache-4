500|$|Not all reviews were as positive. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club {{awarded the}} episode a [...] "B–" [...] {{and called it}} [...] "alternately deeply moving and really, really stupid". His main {{criticism}} of the episode was the it portrayed mental illness {{in a manner that}} was [...] "offensive at worst and just plain idiotic at best". Furthermore, he derided the [...] "magical mentally handicapped person" [...] trope as [...] "cringe-worthy" [...] and cliche. VanDerWerff, however, wrote that the episode was saved largely due to the [...] "beautiful little scenes <b>that</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> see the weight of everything Scully's been carrying around her".|$|E
500|$|... "Thirty-Eight Snub" [...] {{received}} {{very positive}} reviews. Entertainment Weekly writer Melissa Maerz compared {{the direction in}} [...] "Thirty-Eight Snub" [...] to the film-making of Sergio Leone, particularly in its [...] "extreme close-ups", [...] "tense silences" [...] and the [...] "saloon fight" [...] between Walter and Mike. Time magazine writer James Poniewozik said the filming techniques used in Jesse's party [...] "which starts off like a rap video then turns {{into some kind of}} distorted, jumpy tweak-vision" [...] effectively conveyed Jesse's frame of mind. He also liked the way the script conveyed Marie's [...] "increasing isolation" [...] in dealing with Hank. [...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix called the episode a [...] "terrific, unsettling hour" [...] and particularly complimented director Michelle MacLaren and cinematographer Michael Slovis, especially for shooting Jesse's party scenes [...] "in a way <b>that</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> experience the chaos just as Jesse was trying to". Sepinwall strongly praised Aaron Paul, who he said [...] "keeps finding new layers of Jesse, and new talents to show them with". New York magazine writer Logan Hill praised the film noir elements in the episode's photography, and said the opening scene, with Walter staring into the mirror asking, [...] "So, how's it look?", refers to the season's ongoing theme of internal self-reflection and surveillance. Los Angeles Times writer Todd VanDerWerff said while the episode didn't advance the plot very far, it included a great deal of internal development among the characters, which he called [...] "an interesting new dynamic for the show to explore". He also called Jesse's emotional breakdown at the end [...] "easily the most chilling thing so far this season".|$|E

Whether he {{suspected}} anything was up, or wanted to dare Higbee for bedevilment, or was only dancing attendance on Miss Sally, no one knows. But he rode slap into Highee's party, called out, 'If you're out hunting, Tom, here's a chance for your score!' meaning their old vendetta feud, and brings his shot-gun up to his shoulder. Higbee wasn't quick enough, Dumont lets fly, drops Higbee, and then gallops off chased by the Reeds to avenge Higbee, and followed by the whole crowd to see the fun, which was {{a little better than}} nigger-driving.

6000|$|The phaeton {{was driven}} onwards {{with the last}} words, leaving Mrs. Fitchett {{laughing}} and shaking her head slowly, with an interjectional [...] "Surely, surely!"--from which it might be inferred {{that she would have}} found the country-side somewhat duller if the Rector's lady had been less free-spoken and less of a skinflint. Indeed, both the farmers and laborers in the parishes of Freshitt and Tipton would have felt a sad lack of conversation but for the stories about what Mrs. Cadwallader said and did: a lady of immeasurably high birth, descended, as it were, from unknown earls, dim as the crowd of heroic shades--who pleaded poverty, pared down prices, and cut jokes in the most companionable manner, though with a turn of tongue <b>that</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> know who she was. Such a lady gave a neighborliness to both rank and religion, and mitigated the bitterness of uncommuted tithe. A much more exemplary character with an infusion of sour dignity would not have furthered their comprehension of the Thirty-nine Articles, and would have been less socially uniting.|$|E

60|$|Others {{had laughed}} at my {{description}} of a brown bird with a long bill and eyes {{at the back of}} her head <b>that</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> touch her on her nest, so I said no more to them; but at the first opportunity I hunted up Natty Dingle and told him all about it. Natty was a gentle, harmless, improvident little man, who would never do any hard work for pay,--it gave him cricks in his back, he said,--but would cheerfully half kill himself to go fishing through the ice, or to oblige a neighbor. So far as he earned a living he did it by shooting and fishing and trapping and picking berries in their several seasons, and by gathering dandelions and cowslips (kew-slops he called them) in the spring and peddling them good-naturedly from door to door. Most of his time in pleasant weather he spent in roaming about the woods, or lying on his back by the pond shore where the woods were thickest, fishing lazily and catching fish where no one else could ever get them, or watching an otter's den on a stream where no one else had seen an otter for forty years. He knew all about the woods, knew every bird and beast and plant, and one boy at least, to my knowledge, would rather go with him for a day's fishing than see the president's train or go to a circus.|$|E
