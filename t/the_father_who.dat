In [...] "Indian Camp", Hemingway begins the events that shape the Adams persona. Young considers this single Hemingway story to hold the [...] "master key" [...] to [...] "what its author was up to for some thirty-five years of his writing career". Critic Howard Hannum agrees. He believes the trauma of birth and suicide Hemingway paints in [...] "Indian Camp" [...] rendered a leitmotif that gave Hemingway a unified framework for the Nick Adams stories.|$|E

But the war had taken its toll on Pedro's health, and he was dying of tuberculosis. Maria Amélia, who was not yet three years old, was taken during the early hours of 24 September 1834 to Pedro's deathbed. Very weak, Pedro raised his hands to bless her and said: [...] "Always tell this child of <b>the</b> <b>father</b> <b>who</b> loved her so dearly... not to forget me... always to obey her mother... those are my last wishes".

500|$|In 1990, Ralph Bakshi {{decided that}} it was time to make another {{animated}} film. According to Bakshi, [...] "I made 1,500 bucks in 10 years of painting; I thought it would be nice to pick up a piece of change. So I called my lawyer, who was still speaking to me because no one ever leaves Hollywood, and asked him where I should go to sell a movie." [...] Bakshi pitched Cool World to Paramount Pictures (where Bakshi had worked as the final head of the studio's animation division) as an animated horror film. The concept of the film involved a cartoon and live action human having sex and conceiving a hybrid child who visits the real world to murder <b>the</b> <b>father</b> <b>who</b> abandoned her.

The dreams of Ella were shot in New York City. Bowers states, [...] "It is evident that Edwin Thanhouser loved New York City, for over the years he used it as a background for numerous films in scenarios which often played upon its faults, but which on balance depicted the city as the ultimate destination for those seeking culture and entertainment. Indeed, Edwin himself was to spend the final years of his life there - in an apartment on Fifth Avenue. By using a scenic background such as New York City - or Coney Island, or Niagara Falls - Thanhouser created films which had two appeals, that of a travelogue in addition to whatever merits the plot might have had." ...|$|E
500|$|There was {{considerable}} {{concern over the}} safety of mother and child in birth. Although childbirth was a predominantly female event, with neighbours and midwives in support, the father was often present {{in or near the}} birthing chamber to assert, or in the cases of birth outside marriage to admit, his paternity. Before the Reformation, baptism was a means of creating wider spiritual kinship with godparents, but in the reformed Kirk, godparents were abolished and the baptismal ceremony was used primarily as a means of strengthening the [...] "natural" [...] relationship of the child with the parents and to define their roles. This was particularly focused on <b>the</b> <b>father,</b> <b>who</b> would have the primary responsibility for the moral and spiritual education of the child. Among the elite of Highland society, there existed a system of fosterage that created similar links to godparenthood, with children being sent to the households of other major families to facilitate the creation of mutual bonds, that often endured into later life.|$|E
500|$|In 1990, Bakshi pitched Cool World to Paramount Pictures as a {{partially}} animated horror film. The concept involved a cartoon and human having sex and conceiving a hybrid child who visits {{the real world}} to murder <b>the</b> <b>father</b> <b>who</b> abandoned him. The live-action footage was intended to look like [...] "a living, walk-through painting", a visual concept Bakshi had long wanted to achieve. Massive sets were constructed on a sound stage in Las Vegas, based on enlargements of designer Barry Jackson's paintings. The animation was strongly influenced by the house styles of Fleischer Studios and Terrytoons. As the sets were being built, producer Frank Mancuso, Jr., son of Paramount president Frank Mancuso, Sr., had the screenplay rewritten in secret; the new version, by Michael Grais and Mark Victor, was radically different from Bakshi's original. Paramount threatened to sue Bakshi {{if he did not}} complete the film. As Bakshi and Mancuso wrangled over their creative differences, Bakshi and the studio also began to fight over the film's casting. To keep actor Brad Pitt, Bakshi had to replace Drew Barrymore, his original choice for the character of Holli Would, with Kim Basinger, a bigger box office draw at the time. The film's animators were never given a screenplay, and were instead told by Bakshi, [...] "Do a scene that's funny, whatever you want to do!" ...|$|E
