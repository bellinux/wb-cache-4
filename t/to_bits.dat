Orthogonal scan paths [Avra 92] facilitate {{the sharing of}} the functional and the test logic, thereby reducing the overhead of the scan features. Traditional scan paths, shown in Figure 1, connect individual flip-flops within a register and then connect the registers, e. g., bit one of register one is connected <b>to</b> <b>bit</b> two of register one, and bit two is connected <b>to</b> <b>bit</b> three of register one, and so on until {{the last bit of}} register one is connected <b>to</b> <b>bit</b> one of register two.

When {{it comes}} to any {{specific}} channel, the relationship between bit channel j and bit channel i with j<i can be evaluated using an existing sorting procedure.

From the two POs, bit channel i is not stochastically upgraded with respect <b>to</b> <b>bit</b> channel j and bit channel j cannot be stochastically upgraded <b>to</b> <b>bit</b> channel i either from Lemma 1.

30|$|For {{the given}} {{underlying}} channel W, the direct use of GPO and POs sometimes cannot determine {{the relationship between}} two bit channels.

Applying the two POs and GPO yields no decision regarding whether W_N^(i) is stochastically upgraded or degraded with respect to W_N^(j). Let us {{take a look at a}} bit channel k− 1 =(011000001)b. We can determine that bit channel i is stochastically upgraded with respect <b>to</b> <b>bit</b> channel k for an AWGN channel with SNR = 1 dB because bit channel “ 1001 ” is stochastically upgraded with respect <b>to</b> <b>bit</b> channel “ 0110 ” from the Tal-Vardy algorithm and bit channel “ 10000 ” is statistically upgraded with respect <b>to</b> <b>bit</b> channel “ 00001 ” from the POs. We can determine that bit channel k is stochastically upgraded with respect <b>to</b> <b>bit</b> channel j because bit channel “ 011000 ” is stochastically upgraded with respect <b>to</b> <b>bit</b> channel “ 000111 ” from the Tal-Vardy algorithm for the same AWGN channel and bit channel “ 001 ” is the same as bit channel “ 001.” Therefore, we have W_N^(i)≽ W_N^(k) and W_N^(k)≽ W_N^(j), resulting in W_N^(i)≽ W_N^(j).|$|R
40|$|Recent {{research}} efforts based on joint code-decoder design methodology {{have shown that}} it is possible to construct structured LDPC (Low Density Parity Check) codes without any performance degradation. An interesting new data independence property between the two classes of messages viz. check <b>to</b> <b>bit</b> and <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> check involved in decoding, is observed. This property is a result of the specific structuring of parity check matrix. By exploiting this property, we propose an architecture in which the computation of messages is synchronized such that each class of messages is consumed immediately by the computational unit for another class of messages. The internal memory of the check <b>to</b> <b>bit</b> units is increased in tune with the storage requirement of the check <b>to</b> <b>bit</b> messages. The separate memories for check <b>to</b> <b>bit</b> and <b>bit</b> <b>to</b> check messages are eliminated. This approach has memory savings of 75 % and reduces the overall memory accesses by 66 % when compared to some of existing work. When compared to recent implementations the savings are mainly in reduction of memory accesses and the speed of the proposed data path. The architecture renders itself to efficient implementation of various LDPC decoding algorithms such as Min-Sum and layered decoding. 1...|$|R
