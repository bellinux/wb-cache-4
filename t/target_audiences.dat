40|$|This article {{considers}} co-creation {{as a new}} persuasive {{strategy in}} health campaigns. Co-creation enables <b>target</b> <b>audience</b> members to become active campaign producers. A recent Dutch anti-smoking campaign applied co-creation, inviting the <b>target</b> <b>audience</b> to complete the slogan “smoking is sóóó... ” with something outdated on social networking sites (SNSs) like Facebook and Twitter to stress non-smoking as the new social norm. From a corpus-linguistic perspective, we investigated how the slogans from the <b>target</b> <b>audience</b> resonated with or deviated from the campaign’s original message. In general, the <b>target</b> <b>audience</b> slogans followed the campaign’s approach, but on the SNSs, differences were found regarding the valence, type of utterance, and domain to which smoking was compared. The <b>target</b> <b>audience</b> frequently compared smoking with other (inter) personal social norms. Co-creation thus provides the <b>target</b> <b>audience</b> {{with an opportunity to}} disseminate campaign messages from their own perspective, {{but at the same time}} a co-creation strategy risks diluting the intended campaign message...|$|R

[...] Scholar Georges Claude Guilbert, author of Madonna as Postmodern Myth: How One Star's Self-Construction Rewrites Sex, Gender, Hollywood and the American Dream, noted that there is a polysemy in [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] since the singer addresses either God or her lover, and in doing so [...] "Madonna achieves the gold-card of attaining her own divinity. Whenever someone calls her name, it alludes to the song". Theologian Andrew Greeley compared [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] with the biblical Song of Songs. Greeley, although focusing more on the video, acknowledged the fact that sexual passion may be revelatory, and complimented Madonna for glorifying ideologies of female subjectivity and womanhood in the song.|$|E

2500|$|Daniel Byman, {{security}} studies {{professor at}} Georgetown University, argues that Washington must clarify its policies behind extrajudicial and extraterritorial killings, lest a nefarious precedent {{in international law}} is set. Additionally, Byman argues that Washington must [...] "remain mindful of the built-in limits of low-cost, unmanned interventions, since the very convenience of drone warfare risks dragging the United States into conflicts it could otherwise avoid." [...] Though Byman recognizes the problems inherent in using armed UAVs, he believes {{that they are very}} effective. [...] "U.S. drones have killed an estimated 3,000 al Qaeda, Taliban, and other jihadist operatives in Pakistan and Yemen. That number includes over 50 senior leaders of al Qaeda and the Taliban--top figures who are not easily replaced." [...] Drones have also undercut terrorists' ability to effectively communicate with its <b>target</b> <b>audiences,</b> ultimately straining their recruitment pools. To avoid attracting drones, al Qaeda operates have avoided gathering in large numbers and mitigated use of electronic devices. Byman argues that al Qaeda leaders [...] "cannot give orders when they are incommunicado, and training on a large scale is nearly impossible when a drone strike could wipe out an entire coupe of new recruits. Drones have turned al Qaeda's command and training structures into a liability, forcing the group to choose between having no leaders and risking dead leaders." ...|$|E
2500|$|Marketers target {{influential}} {{people on}} social media who are recognised as being opinion leaders and opinion-formers to send messages to their <b>target</b> <b>audiences</b> and amplify {{the impact of their}} message. A social media post by an opinion leader can have a much greater impact (via the forwarding of the post or [...] "liking" [...] of the post) than a social media post by a regular user. Marketers have come to the understanding that [...] "consumers are more prone to believe in other individuals" [...] who they trust (Sepp, Liljander, & Gummerus, 2011). OL's and OF's can also send their own messages about products and services they choose (Fill, Hughes, & De Francesco, 2013, p.216). The reason the opinion leader or formers have such a strong following base is because their opinion is valued or trusted (Clement, Proppe, & Rott, 2007). They can review products and services for their followings, which can be positive or negative towards the brand. OL's and OF's are people who have a social status and because of their personality, beliefs, values etc. have the potential to influence other people (Kotler, Burton, Deans, Brown, & Armstrong, 2013, p.189). They usually have a large number of followers otherwise known as their reference, membership or aspirational group (Kotler, Burton, Deans, Brown, & Armstrong, 2013, p.189. By having an OL or OF support a brands product by posting a photo, video or written recommendation on a blog, the following may be influenced and because they trust the OL/OF a high chance of the brand selling more products or creating a following base. Having an OL/OF helps spread word of mouth talk amongst reference groups and/or memberships groups e.g. family, friends, work-friends etc. (Kotler, Burton, Deans, Brown, & Armstrong, 2013, p.189). The adjusted communication model shows the use of using opinion leaders and opinion formers. The sender/source gives the message to many, many OL's/OF's who pass the message on along with their personal opinion, the receiver (followers/groups) form their own opinion and send their personal message to their group (friends, family etc.) [...] (Dahlen, Lange, & Smith, 2010, p.39).|$|E
