The haircut was given by David Holden of New Hampshire whose son is afflicted with autism.|$|E
5|$|Leigh's murder {{received}} {{considerable attention}} in the media. Initially focusing on her sexual assault and murder, media attention later concentrated more {{on the lack of}} parental supervision and the drugs and alcohol at the party, and on Leigh's sexuality. <b>The</b> <b>media</b> <b>coverage</b> of the murder has been cited as an example of blaming the victim. Leigh's murder inspired a theatrical play entitled A Property of the Clan, which was later revised and renamed Blackrock, as well as a feature film of the same name.|$|E
5|$|Portland had {{strongly}} desired Washington, {{and their}} general manager Stu Inman, {{was a close}} friend of Pete Newell's. Inman had worked hard through Newell to let Washington know that they intended this to be the last time he was traded. This was important as <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>coverage</b> and re-locations had been hard on Pat and the children. To his great relief, the city of Portland welcomed Washington with open arms. Portland had one of the more rabid fan bases in the league, and everywhere Washington went he was treated like a beloved celebrity.|$|E
50|$|The {{extent to}} which the {{deterrence}} argument is well-founded, however, is far from the only interesting and important aspect of this common justification of capital punishment. In fact, current conceptualizations of the deterrence argument are also paramount, insofar as they implicitly operate under the assumption that <b>the</b> <b>media</b> and publicity are integral to shaping individuals' awareness and understandings of capital punishment. In other words, current conceptualizations of the deterrence argument presuppose that most people are made aware of executions through <b>the</b> <b>media's</b> <b>coverage</b> of said executions, which means that <b>the</b> <b>media's</b> selection of executions to cover, as well as <b>the</b> <b>media's</b> <b>coverage</b> of said executions are necessary for the deterrence effect to transpire. In this regard, in contemporary society, the deterrence argument relies upon the implicit understanding that people's understandings and actions - including actions that may deprive an individual of life - are influenced by <b>the</b> <b>media.</b> Although it is increasingly unclear {{as to whether or not}} <b>the</b> <b>media's</b> <b>coverage</b> has affected criminal behavior, it is necessary to examine how <b>the</b> <b>media's</b> <b>coverage</b> of executions and, more abstractly, its holistic construction of capital punishment has shaped people's actions and understandings related to this controversial practice.|$|R

5000|$|The Johnson {{administration}} {{employed a}} [...] "policy of minimum candor" [...] in its dealings with <b>the</b> <b>media.</b> Military information officers sought to manage <b>media</b> <b>coverage</b> by emphasizing stories that portrayed {{progress in the}} war. Over time, this policy damaged the public trust in official pronouncements. As <b>the</b> <b>media's</b> <b>coverage</b> of <b>the</b> war {{and that of the}} Pentagon diverged, a so-called credibility gap developed.|$|R

Having had no funding, Omar competed in loose fitting equipment donated by the Sudanese team, but despite finishing in last place, <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>coverage</b> of her meant that she was cheered loudly by the crowd as she finished.|$|E
5|$|Driven {{by early}} {{enjoyment}} of <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>coverage</b> of cricket, Agnew developed {{a love for}} playing the game. At the end of days spent watching cricket on television in a blacked-out room with the commentary provided by the radio, Agnew {{would go into the}} garden and practise his bowling for hours, trying to imitate the players he had seen. Agnew's father, an amateur cricketer, taught him the rudiments of the sport, including an offspin action, as he wanted his son to develop into a bowler like him. Another family connection to cricket was his first cousin, Mary Duggan, who was a women's Test player for England from 1948 to 1963.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, while {{a student}} at Bennington College, Dworkin was arrested during an anti-Vietnam War protest at the United States Mission to the United Nations {{and sent to the}} New York Women's House of Detention. Dworkin testified that the doctors in the House of Detention gave her an {{internal}} examination which was so rough that she bled for days afterwards. She spoke in public and testified before a grand jury about her experience, and <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>coverage</b> of her testimony made national and international news. The grand jury declined to make an indictment in the case, but Dworkin's testimony contributed to public outrage over the mistreatment of inmates. The prison was closed seven years later.|$|E

5|$|In December 1928 Crowley met the Nicaraguan Maria Teresa Sanchez. Crowley was {{deported}} from France by the authorities, who disliked {{his reputation}} and feared {{that he was}} a German agent. So that she could join him in Britain, Crowley married Sanchez in August 1929. Now based in London, Mandrake Press agreed to publish his autobiography in a limited edition six-volume set, also publishing his novel Moonchild and book of short stories The Stratagem. Mandrake went into liquidation in November 1930, before the entirety of Crowley's Confessions could be published. Mandrake's owner P.R. Stephenson meanwhile wrote The Legend of Aleister Crowley, an analysis of <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>coverage</b> surrounding him.|$|E
5|$|As a major general, Walker was {{appointed}} General Officer Commanding, Eastern District, before becoming Assistant Chief of the Defence Staff at the Ministry of Defence. He took command of NATO's Allied Rapid Reaction Corps (ARRC), which deployed to the Balkans in 1995, Walker {{becoming the first}} officer to command the land component of the NATO-led Implementation Force.

After relinquishing command of the ARRC, Walker spent three years as Commander in Chief, Land Command, before being appointed Chief of the General Staff—the professional head of the British Army—in 2000. In 2003, he was promoted to Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS)—the professional head of all the British Armed Forces. While CDS, Walker attracted controversy during the modernisation of the armed forces, over allegations of prisoner abuse during the Iraq War, and over comments that <b>the</b> <b>media</b> <b>coverage</b> of Iraq may have endangered British troops.|$|E

On the thirtieth anniversary of her death that year, an outdoor mass was held there which was attended by four thousand people and which was covered by Louisiana television stations and the Cable News Network, and was reported in newspapers in Louisiana, Dallas, Houston, Miami, Orlando, Albany, and Seattle. <b>The</b> <b>media</b> <b>coverage</b> resulted in knowledge of Richard spreading world-wide, with interest in her expressed in Yugoslavia, Croatia, Australia, and Africa.

Production was slated to begin in December 2013. The announcement of Loham received considerable media attention as it was Manju Warrier's return to the screen after leaving the film industry to marry actor Dileep. <b>The</b> <b>media</b> <b>coverage</b> was further heightened when Prithviraj Sukumaran joined the cast. However, the film was shelved soon after its official announcement. Ranjith explained it was dropped because the film's story resembled that of another film in the same language released during its pre-production time.
