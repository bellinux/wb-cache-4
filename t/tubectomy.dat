50|$|Tubal {{ligation}} (incorrectly {{referred to}} as <b>tubectomy)</b> is considered major surgery, typically requiring the patient to undergo local, general, or spinal anesthesia. It is advised that women should not undergo this surgery if they currently have or {{had a history of}} bladder cancer. After the anesthesia takes effect, a surgeon will make a small incision at each side of, but just below the navel in order to gain access to each of the two fallopian tubes. With traditional tubal ligation, the surgeon severs the tubes, and then ties (ligates) them off thereby preventing the travel of eggs to the uterus. Other methods include using clips or rings to clamp them shut, or severing and cauterizing them. Tubal ligation is usually done in a hospital operating-room setting.|$|E

The present {{study was conducted to}} describe the socio-demographic characteristics, ascertain the knowledge-practice regarding contraceptives including natural methods and to assess the unmet need for contraceptives. Methods: In a cross-sectional design, 326 women were recruited (19 - 40 years) among mothers coming for immunization of their babies in the immunization clinic of RGKar Medical College, Kolkata, India. Considering response of wife as a proxy for the couple‘s contraceptive behaviour, only married fecund women were approached. A pre-tested questionnaire was dispensed. The study was conducted from April till June, 2010. Results: Contraceptive knowledge was universal and the practice was 92 %. Natural/traditional methods were known to 80 % and being used by a substantial number of participants (41 %).

40|$|Background: To {{discover}} {{the relationship between}} the socio-economic, demographic characteristics and complications for acceptors following Double puncture laparoscopic (DPL) and conventional tubal ligation (CTL) procedures in rural and urban communities and additionally, we also sought to study the occurrence of post tubal ligation syndrome. Methods: A follow up study on 1000 women over a period of two years was conducted. The study was divided into 2 groups: 500 women undergone double puncture laparoscopic (DPL) sterilization and another 500 women underwent conventional tubal ligation (CTL). The acceptors were personally interviewed as per the guide lines in the proforma in the field at their door steps with help of multipurpose health workers (ANM) of the area concerned in the rural areas. Results: The mean age of DPL and CTL groups were 24. 4 years and 23. 8 years, respectively. The acceptance of type of procedure was almost equal in all religious groups. As the level of education increases there is clear correlation with DPL acceptance. The overall acceptance of <b>tubectomy</b> was higher in house wives (61 %) than the working women (39 %). However house wives preferred to undergone conventional <b>tubectomy</b> more (63 %) than the DPL (59 %).
