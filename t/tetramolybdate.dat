40|$|Abstract: Non-agglomerated {{ammonium}} dimolybdate (ADM) monocrystals {{with large}} diameter and high dispersion has been prepared through reaction-evaporation-crystallization (REC) process using ammonium <b>tetramolybdate</b> and ammonia solution as reactants. The as-prepared ADM monocrystals were systematically characterized by x-ray powder diffraction, transmission-reflection optical microscope, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and TG-DSC thermal analysis. It is {{shown that the}} as-prepared ADM samples are disperse monocrystals with well grain distribution and geometric shape, which can well meet the quality requirements for the subsequent production of molybdenum powders...|$|E
40|$|Based on a {{consideration}} of the crystal structures of well-known negative thermal expansion (NTE) materials, $ZrV_ 2 O_ 7 $ and $ZrW_ 2 O_ 8 $, we have identified a new series of <b>tetramolybdates,</b> $Ln_ 2 Mo_ 4 O_{ 15 }$ (Ln = Y, Dy, Ho, Tm), that exhibit an anomalous thermal expansion behaviour. Unlike $ZrW_ 2 O_ 8 $ and $ZrV_ 2 O_ 7 $ which are cubic, the <b>tetramolybdates</b> are monoclinic (space group $P 2 _ 1 /c$). Nevertheless, the framework is similar to $ZrV_ 2 O_ 7 /ZrW_ 2 O_ 8 $ consisting of $MoO_ 4 $ tetrahedra that are weakly connected to $Mo_ 2 O_ 7 $ anions, which bind the Ln in a seven-fold anion coordination. An exploratory investigation of these materials using dilatometry, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and high-temperature powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) $(Dy_ 2 Mo_ 4 O_{ 15 }) $ reveals a negative or low thermal expansion in the 30 – 200 °C temperature range. Since there are no major structural changes in the high-temperature XRD and there is no first-order phase transition in DSC in the 30 – 500 °C range, we believe the mechanism of anomalous thermal expansion in these molybdates likely involves second-order structural changes of the molybdate oxygens, {{in a manner similar to}} the second-order changes found in $ZrW_ 2 O_ 8 $. Further detailed structural studies are essential to unravel the mechanism of anomalous thermal expansion behaviour of these molybdates...|$|R
