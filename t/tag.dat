5|$|After being {{signed by}} WWE, the {{brothers}} worked as enhancement talents, before gaining notoriety in the <b>tag</b> team division, {{partly due to}} their participation in Tables, Ladders and Chairs matches. With the addition of Lita, the team became known as Team Xtreme and continued to rise in popularity. As a <b>tag</b> team wrestler, Hardy is an 11-time world <b>tag</b> team champion (six World <b>Tag</b> Team Championships, one WCW <b>Tag</b> Team Championship, one Raw <b>Tag</b> Team Championship, two TNA World <b>Tag</b> Team Championships, and one ROH World <b>Tag</b> Team Championship) – all with his brother Matt. On the independent circuit, Jeff was also one-half of the OMEGA <b>Tag</b> Team Champions with Matt in their second reign and one-half of the Crash <b>Tag</b> Team Champions with Matt in their first reign.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with his}} real-life brother Jeff, he gained notoriety in WWF's <b>tag</b> team {{division}} {{due to their}} participation in Tables, Ladders and Chairs matches. As a <b>tag</b> team wrestler, Hardy is a 12-time world <b>tag</b> team champion, having held six WWF/World <b>Tag</b> Team Championships, two WWE/Raw <b>Tag</b> Team Championships, ROH World <b>Tag</b> Team Championship, one WCW <b>Tag</b> Team Championship and two TNA World <b>Tag</b> Team Championships (the first man to have held all said titles, followed by Jeff).|$|E
5|$|At Destination X 2017, a recoloured {{version of}} the GFW <b>Tag</b> Team Championships from the {{original}} promotion was revealed {{to serve as the}} current <b>tag</b> team championships, taking history from the TNA World <b>Tag</b> Team Championships.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{disadvantages}} {{with the use}} of <b>tags</b> and folksonomies as well, and some of the advantages (see above) can lead to problems. For example, the simplicity in <b>tagging</b> can result in poorly applied <b>tags.</b> Further, while controlled vocabularies are exclusionary by nature, <b>tags</b> are often ambiguous and overly personalized. Users apply <b>tags</b> to documents in many different ways and <b>tagging</b> systems also often lack mechanisms for handling synonyms, acronyms and homonyms, and they also often lack mechanisms for handling spelling variations such as misspellings, singular/plural form, conjugated and compound words. Some <b>tagging</b> systems do not support <b>tags</b> consisting of multiple words, resulting in <b>tags</b> like “viewfrommywindow”. Sometimes users choose specialized <b>tags</b> or <b>tags</b> without meaning to others.|$|R
30|$|Generally speaking, {{some words}} with {{specific}} pos (part of speech), such as adjective element (<b>tagged</b> as ag), adjective (<b>tagged</b> as a), adverb element (<b>tagged</b> as dg), adverb (<b>tagged</b> as d), verb (<b>tagged</b> as verb), exclamation (<b>tagged</b> as e), {{and even some}} punctuation (<b>tagged</b> as w) can express various kinds of sentiment explicitly, instantly “happy” and “!” in the sentence we mentioned earlier.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the influences of}} online cultural capital on social <b>tagging</b> behavior in Delicious. com. The researchers identified three online cultural capital-related variables (understanding of social <b>tagging,</b> understanding of Delicious’ social functionalities, and quantity of <b>tags</b> and bookmarks) via factor analysis of a survey dataset and analyzed their influences on <b>tagging</b> motivations (information organization-oriented vs. social-oriented) and <b>tagging</b> strategies (object-based <b>tagging</b> vs. situationbased <b>tagging).</b> An existing dataset from a previous survey of Delicious users {{was used for the}} analysis. Multiple regression analysis was used to examine the influences of the three variables on <b>tagging</b> motivations and strategies. The study found that understanding of social <b>tagging</b> has a significant positive influence on information organization-oriented tagging; understanding of Delicious’ social functionalities has a significant positive influence on social-oriented <b>tagging.</b> In <b>tagging</b> strategies, understanding of Delicious’ functionalities significantly influenced how strategic respondents are in situation-based <b>tagging.</b> Quantity of <b>tags</b> and bookmarks influenced both types of <b>tagging</b> strategies...|$|R
5|$|Both {{brothers}} {{also won}} singles championships during their runs, with each becoming multi-time world champions {{in their own}} right. In 2017, they held seven <b>tag</b> team titles from seven different promotions at the same time, including the ROH World <b>Tag</b> Team Championship and the TNA <b>Tag</b> Team Championships, being recognized as the only <b>tag</b> team in history to hold the titles simultaneously. After returning to WWE at WrestleMania 33, and winning the Raw <b>Tag</b> Team Championship at the event, they became the only <b>tag</b> team in history to hold all three top <b>tag</b> titles in American wrestling in a month's span.|$|E
5|$|Following this, The World's Greatest <b>Tag</b> Team began a {{rivalry with}} Paul London and Brian Kendrick {{after losing to}} the duo in their debut match on Raw. A few weeks later, London {{defeated}} Benjamin in a singles match, however, on the July 23 episode of Raw, The World's Greatest <b>Tag</b> Team got a <b>tag</b> team win over London and Kendrick to end the rivalry. For this match they were announced as The (Self-Proclaimed) World's Greatest <b>Tag</b> Team, having been previously using simply The World's Greatest <b>Tag</b> Team since their reformation.|$|E
5|$|On September 12, he re-debuted on {{the brand}} turning face, forming a <b>tag</b> team with his brother, Primo. They {{defeated}} WWE <b>Tag</b> Team Champions Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder in the match to gain their first victory as a team. Two weeks later, both teams competed in a title match, with The Colóns winning to become <b>tag</b> team champions. Subsequently, Carlito and Primo entered a feud with World <b>Tag</b> Team Champions John Morrison and The Miz. At WrestleMania XXV, The Colóns defeated Miz and Morrison in a <b>tag</b> team unification match, {{becoming the first}} team to simultaneously hold both sets of the company's <b>Tag</b> Team Championships since their creation.|$|E
30|$|As {{the number}} of <b>tags</b> increases, the numbers of {{arriving}} <b>tags,</b> leaving <b>tags,</b> and staying <b>tags</b> increase. Therefore, the numbers of collision slots, idle slots, and readable slots increase linearly as {{the number of}} <b>tags</b> increases. The blocking technique used by SBA 0 prevent arriving <b>tags</b> from colliding with staying <b>tags</b> to minimize the collisions. On the other hand, SBA+ semi-blocks most of the arriving <b>tags,</b> so it generates slightly more collision slots than SBA 0 does.|$|R

30|$|Semantics-based {{extraction}} utilizes {{the known}} functions of HTML <b>tags,</b> namely the semantics of <b>tags,</b> to improve extraction performance. Peters et al. [18] integrated the semantics of several specific HTML <b>tags</b> for content extraction, such as 〈class〉, 〈div〉, 〈 h 1 〉, etc. Both the flexible nested usage of HTML <b>tags</b> {{and the growing}} number of HTML <b>tags,</b> such as HTML 5 <b>tags,</b> only permit us to exploit the semantics of a part of HTML <b>tags.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Briscoes are record eight-time ROH World <b>Tag</b> Team Champions and {{one-time}} IWGP <b>Tag</b> Team Champions. They {{have also}} held the GHC Junior Heavyweight <b>Tag</b> Team Championship once, the ROH World Six-Man <b>Tag</b> Team Championship once with Bully Ray and the NEVER Openweight 6-Man <b>Tag</b> Team Championship twice with Toru Yano. They have also won numerous <b>tag</b> team titles on the independent circuit.|$|E
5|$|The CMLL Arena Coliseo <b>Tag</b> Team Championship is {{designed}} for <b>tag</b> team competition only, teams of two, and has not allowed neither individual wrestlers to hold the championship by themselves nor teams of three to share the championship. The championship is considered a secondary championship for the <b>tag</b> team division; with the CMLL World <b>Tag</b> Team Championship being the primary championship for the <b>tag</b> team division in CMLL. As it is a professional wrestling championship, its holders are determined by promoters or promotions, not by athletic competition.|$|E
5|$|The Hardy Boyz gained fame {{for their}} {{participation}} in ladder matches and Tables, Ladders and Chairs matches with The Dudley Boyz/Team 3D and Edge and Christian. Overall, they are 11-time world <b>tag</b> team champions between WWE, TNA and ROH, having won the WWF/World <b>Tag</b> Team Championship six times, the Raw <b>Tag</b> Team Championship once, the WCW <b>Tag</b> Team Championship once in WWF/WWE, the TNA World <b>Tag</b> Team Championship twice and the ROH World <b>Tag</b> Team Championship once. Considered {{as one of the}} greatest <b>tag</b> teams of all time, they are the only team to have held the WWF/World, WCW, TNA, ROH and Raw <b>Tag</b> Team Championships. On the independent circuit, the brothers hold <b>tag</b> team championships in The Crash and OMEGA, the latter for which Matt is also the Heavyweight Champion.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the use of}} non subject related <b>tags</b> in social bookmarking tools. Previous studies of <b>tagging</b> determined that many common <b>tags</b> are not directly subject related but are in fact affective <b>tags</b> dwelling on a user's emotional response to a document or are time and task related <b>tags</b> related to a users current projects or activities. These <b>tags</b> have been analysed to examine {{their role in the}} <b>tagging</b> process. (Paper at [URL]...|$|R
25|$|Because of this, {{passengers}} <b>tagging</b> off a bus at any Controlled Station {{will automatically}} be <b>tagged</b> onto the train, and passengers <b>tagging</b> on this bus after {{getting off the}} train at a Controlled Station will automatically be <b>tagged</b> off the train before being <b>tagged</b> onto the bus.|$|R

5|$|The WCW World <b>Tag</b> Team Championship was a {{professional}} wrestling World <b>Tag</b> Team Championship contested for in World Championship Wrestling (WCW). Originally, WCW {{was a member of}} the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA), which had numerous member promotions. The NWA operated many <b>tag</b> team championships before one prime <b>tag</b> team title was established in 1992. One of those titles was the NWA World <b>Tag</b> Team Championship, which was operated by the NWA member Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling (MACW), the predecessor of WCW. The championship was created by MACW in 1975.|$|E
5|$|The WWE Raw <b>Tag</b> Team Championship is a {{professional}} wrestling world <b>tag</b> team championship contested in WWE on the Raw brand. Introduced in 2002 as the WWE <b>Tag</b> Team Championship, it was WWE's third world <b>tag</b> team title, and seventh <b>tag</b> team title overall. After WWE bought the promotions of Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) and World Championship Wrestling (WCW), and unified the WCW <b>Tag</b> Team Championship into its own title at Survivor Series 2001, it split its roster into two brands, Raw and SmackDown, in a brand extension. As a result of this, WWE's original World <b>Tag</b> Team Championship was designated exclusive to the Raw brand, leaving SmackDown without a <b>tag</b> team championship. Soon afterward, the WWE <b>Tag</b> Team Championship was introduced onto the SmackDown brand.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} for a future World <b>Tag</b> Team Championship in a <b>Tag</b> Team Turmoil match, a match where two <b>tag</b> teams start out and when a team was defeated, another came out until the match ended. The match began with the teams of The World's Greatest <b>Tag</b> Team (Shelton Benjamin and Charlie Haas) and The Highlanders (Robbie and Rory McAllister). The first {{elimination}} was made when Benjamin pinned Robbie after a superplex. The World's Greatest <b>Tag</b> Team, defeated the second <b>tag</b> team Jim Duggan and Super Crazy. The third team, Lance Cade and Trevor Murdoch defeated The World's Greatest <b>Tag</b> Team after Cade performed a diving elbow drop on Haas and scored the pinfall. The final team, Cryme Tyme (Shad Gaspard and JTG), won the match after performing a G9 and pinning Cade to become the top contenders to the World <b>Tag</b> Team Championship, though they never received their championship match.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tags</b> are {{currently}} {{added to the}} names of the <b>tagged</b> files. For example, by <b>tagging</b> a file called “img-9936.jpg” with the <b>tags</b> “lion” and “zoo” it will be renamed to “img-9936 zoo.jpg”.|$|R
40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{premise of}} <b>tagging</b> systems is that regu-lar users can organize large collections for browsing and other tasks using uncontrolled vocabularies. Until now, that premise has remained relatively unexamined. Using library data, we test the <b>tagging</b> approach to organizing a collec-tion. We find that <b>tagging</b> systems have three major large scale organizational features: consistency, quality, and com-pleteness. In addition to testing these features, we present results suggesting that users produce <b>tags</b> {{similar to the}} top-ics designed by experts, that paid <b>tagging</b> can effectively supplement <b>tags</b> in a <b>tagging</b> system, and that information integration may be possible across <b>tagging</b> systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{utility of}} using {{morphological}} features in part-of-speech (POS) <b>tagging</b> is well es-tablished in the literature. However, {{the usefulness of}} exploiting information about POS <b>tags</b> for morphological segmentation is less clear. In this paper we study the POS-dependent morphological segmenta-tion in the Adaptor Grammars framework. We experiment with three different scenar-ios: without POS <b>tags,</b> with gold-standard <b>tags</b> and with automatically induced <b>tags,</b> and show that the segmentation F 1 -score improves when the <b>tags</b> are used. We show that the gold-standard <b>tags</b> lead to the biggest improvement as expected. How-ever, using automatically induced <b>tags</b> also brings some improvement over the tag-independent baseline. ...|$|R
5|$|A.J. Styles and Tomko {{defended the}} TNA World <b>Tag</b> Team Championship against {{the team of}} B.G. James and Bob Armstrong in the opening match. It lasted seven minutes and forty-five seconds. B.G. and Armstrong were {{accompanied}} to the ring by United States Military officers. B.G. was injured in storyline after Styles {{hit him in the}} leg with a dropkick during the contest. Tomko and Styles won the match after they performed their signature <b>tag</b> team Tornado–Plex maneuver forcing B.G. into the mat to retain the TNA World <b>Tag</b> Team Championship.|$|E
5|$|After Sunday Night Heat, the {{pay-per-view}} {{began with}} a <b>tag</b> team match where MNM (Joey Mercury and Johnny Nitro) (with Melina) defended the WWE <b>Tag</b> Team Championship against the team of Hardcore Holly and Charlie Haas. The match started off with Nitro and Haas in the ring. Haas took the advantage in the match {{and was able to}} <b>tag</b> in Holly. There was back and forth action between the two teams, as all of the superstars were able to participate in the match. After a Snapshot to Haas, Mercury pinned Haas, which resulted in MNM retaining the WWE <b>Tag</b> Team title.|$|E
5|$|After {{sporadic}} feuds through midway 2001, the APA {{were awarded}} a WWF <b>Tag</b> Team Championship match against the Dudley Boyz on the July 9, 2001 edition of Raw, where Bradshaw pinned D-Von {{to win the}} WWF <b>Tag</b> Team Championship. The following month on SmackDown!, however, the APA lost the WWF <b>Tag</b> Team Championship to Kanyon and Diamond Dallas Page. After their loss of the <b>Tag</b> Team Championship, Faarooq was briefly absent, while Bradshaw began to pursue singles championships, like on the September 27, 2001 edition of SmackDown!, where Bradshaw lost an WWF Intercontinental Championship match against Christian. On the October 22, 2001 edition of Raw, Bradshaw defeated The Hurricane to win the WWF European Championship. When Faarooq returned, Bradshaw lost the European Championship to Christian on the November 1, 2001 edition of SmackDown!. At No Way Out, the APA won a <b>Tag</b> Team Turmoil match to win a WWF <b>Tag</b> Team Championship match at WrestleMania X8. The APA were unsuccessful in winning the <b>Tag</b> Team Championship on two occasions: on the February 28, 2002 edition of SmackDown! and at WrestleMania X8.|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} <b>tagging</b> as knowledge organization. <b>Tagging</b> {{is a kind}} of indexing, a process of labelling and categorizing information made to support resource discovery for users. Social <b>tagging</b> generally means the practice whereby internet users generate keywords to describe, categorise or comment on digital content. The value of <b>tagging</b> comes when social <b>tags</b> within a collection are aggregated and shared through a folksonomy. This {{article examines}} definitions of <b>tagging</b> and folksonomy, and discusses the functions, advantages and disadvantages of <b>tagging</b> systems in relation to knowledge organization before discussing studies that have compared <b>tagging</b> and conventional library based knowledge organization systems. Approaches to disciplining <b>tagging</b> practice are examined and tagger motivation discussed. Finally, the article outlines current research fronts...|$|R
40|$|Recovery of {{internal}} <b>tags</b> during the filleting process would create new possibilities for <b>tagging</b> experiments on several species, in Norwegian fisheries primarily cod, haddock, saithe, herring and mackerel. In {{connection with a}} program for developing a detector and a devise for recovery {{of internal}}ly <b>tagged</b> fish, laboratory experiments with <b>tagging</b> of young saithe were carried out. The results of the saithe <b>tagging</b> experiment showed that after six weeks about 75 % of the <b>tags</b> were encapsulated by tissue without any signs of infection or disease. Later, apparently no more <b>tags</b> were encapsulated. Approximately {{one third of the}} non-encapsulated <b>tags</b> were extruded. The growth of the <b>tagged</b> fish was significantly lower than for the untagged fish...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} address the issue of {{reliability}} and validity of the social <b>tags</b> that were analyzed in our study, we applied the following data cleaning methods as they have been proposed by Golder & Huberman (2006): (a) we corrected <b>tags</b> with grammatical errors, (b) we removed <b>tags</b> that were irrelevant with the content of the LOs, such as <b>tags</b> used to express end-users’ opinions and/or emotions like funny, cool, amusing, etc., (c) we removed <b>tags</b> that were synonyms with other <b>tags</b> and (d) we translated to English <b>tags</b> that had been added in other languages. This also means that if a tagger had only contributed <b>tags</b> that were irrelevant with the content of the LOs or <b>tags</b> that were synonyms with other <b>tags</b> then this tagger was excluded from our study.|$|R
5|$|After {{sporadic}} feuds, the Acolytes won a <b>tag</b> team battle royal at Armageddon against {{seven other}} <b>tag</b> teams {{to win a}} WWF <b>Tag</b> Team Championship match. They were unable to win the championship at Royal Rumble, where the New Age Outlaws defeated them, after Billy Gunn performed a Fame-ass-er on Bradshaw, after interference from X-Pac.|$|E
5|$|After teaming {{for several}} years, Hawk and Hanson won the Florida {{version of the}} NWA World <b>Tag</b> Team Championship by {{defeating}} Hiro Matsuda and Duke Keomuka on August 3, 1965.

5000|$|<b>Tagged</b> columns are columns {{that take}} no space {{whatsoever}} {{if they are}} not set in a record. They may be single valued but can also be multi-valued. The same <b>tagged</b> column may have multiple values in a single record. When <b>tagged</b> columns are set in a record, each instance of a <b>tagged</b> column takes approximately 4-bytes of space in addition {{to the size of the}} <b>tagged</b> column instance value. When the number of instances of a single <b>tagged</b> column is large, the overhead per <b>tagged</b> column instance is approximately 2-bytes. <b>Tagged</b> columns are ideal for sparse columns because they take no space whatsoever {{if they are not}} set. If a multi-valued <b>tagged</b> column is indexed, the index will contain one entry for the record for each value of the <b>tagged</b> column.|$|R
40|$|A {{method is}} {{described}} for directly estimating natural mortality and initial <b>tagging</b> mortality using <b>tagging</b> data for those species which remain accessible to capture even after death. Important additional requirements {{are that the}} emigration of live <b>tagged</b> individuals is non-existent and that dead <b>tagged</b> individuals {{are subject to the}} same fishing mortality and have the same probability of being noticed and reported as the live <b>tagged</b> individuals. Where these requirements are satisfied the slope of the plot of the ratio of live <b>tagged</b> individuals recovered to the total <b>tagged</b> individuals recovered (excluding those dead <b>tagged</b> individuals recovered, which have not grown since release) with time, gives an estimate of the instantaneous coefficient of natural mortality, M. Also in this situation initial <b>tagging</b> mortality can be determined as the ratio of the dead <b>tagged</b> individuals recovered which have not grown since release to the total <b>tagged</b> individuals recovered...|$|R
5000|$|A {{folksonomy}} is {{a system}} in which users apply public <b>tags</b> to online items, typically to aid them in re-finding those items. This can give rise to a classification system based on those <b>tags</b> and their frequencies, in contrast to a taxonomic classification specified by the owners of the content when it is published. This practice is also known as collaborative <b>tagging,</b> social classification, social indexing, and social <b>tagging.</b> However, these terms have slightly different meanings than folksonomy. Folksonomy was originally [...] "the result of personal free <b>tagging</b> of information ... for one's own retrieval". Social <b>tagging</b> is the application of <b>tags</b> in an open online environment where the <b>tags</b> of other users are available to others. Collaborative <b>tagging</b> (also known as group <b>tagging)</b> is <b>tagging</b> performed by a group of users. This type of folksonomy is commonly used in cooperative and collaborative projects such as research, content repositories, and social bookmarking.|$|R
