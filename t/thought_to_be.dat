5|$|Heterodontosaurus is the eponymous {{and best}} known {{member of the}} family Heterodontosauridae. This family is {{considered}} one of the most primitive or basal groups within the order of ornithischian dinosaurs. In spite of the large tusks, Heterodontosaurus <b>is</b> <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> herbivorous, or at least omnivorous. Though it <b>was</b> formerly <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> capable of quadrupedal locomotion, it <b>is</b> now <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> have <b>been</b> bipedal. Tooth replacement was sporadic and not continuous, unlike its relatives. At least four other heterodontosaurid genera are known from the same geological formations as Heterodontosaurus.|$|R

With highly flexible joints on the wing finger, a broad, triangular wing shape, large eyes and short tail, these pterosaurs were analogous to some of today's insectivorous bats, being capable of high manoeuvrability at relatively low speeds.|$|E
