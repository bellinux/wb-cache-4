40|$|The {{notion of}} transit {{migration}} emerged in policy discourse during the 1990 s. Various meanings {{have been assigned}} {{to the notion of}} <b>transit</b> <b>migrant</b> or transit migration’. In this paper we argue that these are constructed categories which are unable to address fully or to describe a range of complex experiences, political contexts and global realities. We first argue that the construction of transit has primarily taken place within the context of European securitization policy. We next expose the limits of such a construction in the light of African migrant experiences in Turkey. Our empirical data shows that while the category of <b>transit</b> <b>migrant</b> generated out of the European securitization agenda can fit some of these experiences, there are also distinctive African migrant experiences in Turkey which cannot be stretched easily into this category an...|$|E

They offer a foothold and prospects for the future, in brief: hope. The newcomer grows towards a rebirth. Given that, fundamentally, both the <b>transit</b> <b>migrant</b> and the religious community are transnationally oriented, the convert ultimately discovers a new continuity between past, present and future. The more intensively he participates in the life in his Christian enclave, the more he approaches his initial objective (i. e. migration to the West).   It is a paradox like that illustrated by the parable in Luke 19 : 17. Hence our suggestion of a  “Lucan effect”, one that naturally calls for an empirically-based, rational explanation in a scientific article...|$|E

Of them, 59 samples (2. 9 %) {{were found to be}} positive. RT-PCR positive samples were examined with the same method with respect to H 5 N 1 and 4 samples (6. 8 %) were found to be positive. RT-PCR positive 59 samples were inoculated in Embryonated Chicken Egg (ECE) and AI type A virus was isolated from 12 samples (20. 3 %). Of the isolates, 3 were typed as H 1 N 7, 2 as H 7 N 9, 2 as H 11 N 9 and 1 as H 8 N 4 with Hemagglutination Inhibition (HI) and Neuraminidase Inhibition (NI) tests. About 4 isolates obtained from winter visitor Anas cylpeata which had been determined as H 5 N 1 by RT-PCR and agarose gel electrophoresis, gave positive reaction by HI test both with H 1 and H 5 antisera and all were typed as N 1 by NI-test. Feces samples found to be positive by RT-PCR belonged to avian species Anseriformes, Charadriiformes, Passeriformes, Gruiformes and Phoenicopteriformes orders.

40|$|CARIM-India is co-financed by the European University Institute and the European Union. The {{phenomenon}} of irregular transit, or step-by-step, migration {{is not a}} new trend as it has been increasingly witnessed {{in many parts of the}} world in the last three decades. For instance, at the surrounding regions of Europe, countries like Turkey, Morocco and Ukraine are subject to flows of irregular migrants who come from the third countries and intend to enter Europe from these peripheral territories. While the nature, dynamics and mechanisms of these flows are relatively well-documented in recent related literature, there are limited number of studies which focus on the particular cases of migrant groups. This essay tends to fill in this void, by focusing on the cases of transit migration in Turkey who come from the Indian sub-continent mainly with the intention of going to Europe. While the essay elaborates on Bangladeshi, Indian, Nepalese, Pakistani, and Sri Lankan <b>transit</b> <b>migrants</b> in general, special emphasis is mainly on Indians. In the lack of comprehensive and reliable data, the paper is an exploratory study rather than an explanatory one, which attempts to map out a relatively new migratory form and process from India to Europe that develops as a step-by-step, or transit, migration through various countries: the case of Turkey, as a transit country, has provided us with a unique setting which has a relatively long-established tradition of being a transit country towards Europe for thousands of <b>transit</b> <b>migrants</b> mostly from the Middle-East, and is now also increasingly becoming functional for <b>transit</b> <b>migrants</b> who come from the Indian subcontinent and try to enter Europe.

40|$|This {{presentation}} is about young migrants’ journeys with low chances of receiving asylum {{or any other}} type of residence in Europe. These migrants exhibit a highly complex migration pattern. First, these migrants are frequently in durable “transit” across Europe, moving back and forth between different states. Second, <b>transit</b> <b>migrants</b> must exhibit a high degree of flexibility, as they have to respond to suddenly changing conditions, such as work opportunities, rejection of asylum claims, detention or deportation. Third, <b>transit</b> <b>migrants</b> often switch between different legal statuses, such as asylum seeker, rejected asylum seeker, illegal worker or detainee. This throws them into a general state of uncertainty and psychological distress. The experience of these young adults shows a deep ambivalence between a sense of autonomy, on the one hand, and of profound hope- and powerlessness, on the other. This presentation explores the “fragmented journeys” of these migrants, by way of a multi-sited ethnographic approach and biographical interviews. It focuses on the lived experiences and the strategies of irregular migrants {{to find a way to}} reside in Europe in the context of an increasingly restrictive migration management...|$|R

Mobility and migration of Turkish people and <b>transit</b> <b>migrants,</b> who cross Turkey to reach Europe, have become contentious issues in Turkey-EU relations. European governments and citizens have long feared that new waves of migration from Turkey would follow full EU membership. The Turkish government, meanwhile, has feared that Turkey would turn into a buffer zone and a dumping ground for irregular migrants so, until very recently, it refused to sign the readmission agreement, {{which is one of}} the requirements for visa liberalization/facilitation.

40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{whether the}} Jews leaving Tsarist Russia and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, {{part of the}} transatlantic mass migration {{of the end of}} the nineteenth century, became subject to state control. Most emigrants from Eastern Europe in this period passed through the ports of Bremen, Hamburg and Antwerp. In the 1880 s only a few emigrants were not welcome in America and sent back to Europe, but economic competition and the supposed health threat immigrants posed meant the US became the trendsetter in implementing protectionist immigration policy in the 1890 s. More emigrants were returned to Europe because of the newly erected US federal immigration control stations, but many more were denied the possibility to leave for the United States by the remote control mechanism which the American authorities enforced on the European authorities and the shipping companies. At the Russian-German border and the port of Antwerp, shipping companies stopped <b>transit</b> <b>migrants</b> who were deemed medically unacceptable by American standards. The shipping companies became subcontractors for the American authorities as they risked heavy fines if they transported unwanted emigrants. The Belgian authorities refused to collaborate with the Americans and defended their sovereignty, and made shipping companies in the port of Antwerp solely responsible for the American remote migration control. Due to the private migration control at the port of Antwerp <b>transit</b> <b>migrants</b> became stuck in Belgium. The Belgian authorities wanted these stranded migrants to return “home. ” It seems that the number of stranded migrants remained manageable as the Belgian authorities did not make the shipping companies pay the bill.

Qualitative scenarios of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) up to 2035 suggest that labour migration pressure will rise due to overcrowding of local labour markets, despite modest growth of job opportunities (OECD 2009).

Therefore the European Commission emphasizes the individuality of each agreement combining the partner’s specific needs and the EU’s goals.

Within this context, the debate over irregular transit migration from Turkey to the EU is a perfect case study for analyzing how the phenomenon of irregular migration is affecting the European migration and border regimes. It is also an interesting case for analyzing the interplay between the migration-related issues and the EU-Turkey membership negotiations in which the whole notion of “migration management” turns into a type of conditionality measure for the progress and completion of the membership talks.

Because of the particular characteristics of the undocumented migration phenomenon, there is an absence of quantitative information that would allow more precise knowledge of the nature and extent of the problem of human rights violations of Central American migrants crossing Mexican territory.

40|$|Transit {{migration}} {{is not a}} completely new phenomenon. In fact the real novelty {{is that it is}} perceived or presented as new by international experts. By re-emphasising the transitory nature of migration the term reintroduces an aspect of uncertainty in migration patterns, associating social marginalisation with precarious impermanence and illegality with criminality and transit, in order to provide an argument to eliminate it. In fact it is only a minority of nationals of sub-Saharan African countries who, having crossed the Sahara, actually want to continue to Europe. The majority are happy to work more permanently in the Maghreb while cross border circulation continues on a seasonal basis. To confuse the figure of the trans-Saharan migrant with those of the victim stuck on a boat off the coast of Lampedusa or trapped in the forests of Bel Younes at Ceuta or Mariwari, near Mellila is to twist reality. There is one certainty, nevertheless, amongst all these approximations: the precarious status of <b>transit</b> <b>migrants</b> has grown as states have cooperated in border control operations and as solidarity between migrants and other migrants or non-migrants, which provides a safety net during migratory movements, has gradually faded.
