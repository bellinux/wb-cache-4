25|$|The tallit gadol is {{typically}} either all white, white with black stripes, white with blue stripes, or white with twelve-colored stripes. The all-white and black-and-white varieties {{have traditionally been}} the most common, with the blue-and-white variety, in the past {{said to be in}} remembrance of the blue thread or tekhelet, becoming increasingly prevalent in recent years among non-Orthodox Jews on account of the association of blue and white with the State of Israel. The all-white variety is customary among Sepharadic communities, whereas among Ashkenazic communities <b>the</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>is</b> toward white tallitot with black stripes. One explanation for the significance of the black stripes is that their black color symbolizes the destruction of the Temple in Jerusalem and the exile of the Jews from the land of Israel.|$|E

Reporting to a government select committee into the operation of the reserves later the same year, Homeswest director Greg Joyce defended Quartermaine: [...] "She has done her best over a long time to run the place.

2500|$|In his 1857 Grundrisse manuscript, Karl Marx {{called the}} {{tendency}} of the rate of profit to fall [...] "the most important law of political economy" [...] and sought to give a causal explanation for it, {{in terms of his}} theory of capital accumulation. <b>The</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>is</b> already foreshadowed in chapter 25 of Capital, Volume I (on the [...] "general law of capital accumulation"), but in Part 3 of the draft manuscript of Marx's Capital, Volume III, edited posthumously for publication by Friedrich Engels, an extensive analysis is provided of the tendency. Marx regarded the TRPF as proof that capitalist production could not be an everlasting form of production, since, in the end, the profit principle itself would suffer a breakdown. However, because Marx never published any finished manuscript on the TRPF himself, because <b>the</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>is</b> hard to prove or disprove theoretically, and because it is hard to test and measure the rate of profit, Marx's TRPF theory has been a topic of controversy for more than a century.|$|E

2500|$|The {{need for}} {{instrumentation}} grew with {{the rapidly growing}} central electric power stations after the First World War. [...] Instrumentation was also important for heat treating ovens, chemical plants and refineries. [...] Common instrumentation was for measuring temperature, pressure or flow. [...] Readings were typically recorded on circle charts or strip charts. [...] Until the 1930s control was typically [...] "open loop", meaning {{that it did not}} use feedback. [...] Operators made various adjustments by such means as turning handles on valves. [...] If done from a control room a message could be sent to an operator in the plant by color coded light, letting him know whether to increase or decrease whatever was being controlled. [...] The signal lights were operated by a switchboard, which soon became automated. [...] Automatic control became possible with the feedback controller, which sensed the measured variable, measured the deviation from the setpoint and perhaps the rate of change and time weighted amount of deviation, compared that with the setpoint and automatically applied a calculated adjustment. [...] A stand-alone controller may use a combination of mechanical, pneumatic, hydraulic or electronic analogs to manipulate the controlled device. [...] The tendency was to use electronic controls after these were developed, but today <b>the</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>is</b> to use a computer to replace individual controllers.|$|E

60|$|It {{is obvious}} {{that we can not}} expect to find the law of a {{tendency}} by an induction from cases in which <b>the</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>is</b> counteracted. The laws of motion could never have been brought to light from the observation of bodies kept at rest by the equilibrium of opposing forces. Even where <b>the</b> <b>tendency</b> <b>is</b> not, in the ordinary sense of the word, counteracted, but only modified, by having its effects compounded with the effects arising from some other tendency or tendencies, we are still in an unfavorable position for tracing, by means of such cases, the law of the tendency itself. It would have been scarcely possible to discover the law that every body in motion tends to continue moving in a straight line, by an induction from instances in which the motion is deflected into a curve, by being compounded with the effect of an accelerating force. Notwithstanding the resources afforded in this description of cases by the Method of Concomitant Variations, the principles of a judicious experimentation prescribe that the law of each of the tendencies should be studied, if possible, in cases in which that tendency operates alone, or in combination with no agencies but those of which the effect can, from previous knowledge, be calculated and allowed for.|$|E
