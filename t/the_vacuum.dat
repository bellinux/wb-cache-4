40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} quantum field theory on the Bertotti-Robinson space-time, which arises naturally as the near horizon geometry of an extremal Reissner-Nordstrom black hole but can also arise in certain near-horizon limits of non-extremal Reissner Nordstrom space-time. <b>The</b> various <b>vacuum</b> states have been considered {{in the context of}} $AdS_{ 2 }$ black holes by Spradlin and Strominger who showed that <b>the</b> Poincare <b>vacuum,</b> <b>the</b> Global <b>vacuum</b> and <b>the</b> Hartle-Hawking <b>vacuum</b> are all equivalent, while <b>the</b> Boulware <b>vacuum</b> and <b>the</b> Schwarzschild <b>vacuum</b> are equivalent. We verify this by explicitly computing the Green's functions in closed form for a massless scalar field corresponding to each of these vacua. Obtaining a closed form for the Green's function corresponding to <b>the</b> Boulware <b>vacuum</b> is non-trivial, we present it {{here for the first time}} by deriving a new summation formula for associated Legendre functions that allows us to perform the mode-sum. Having obtained the propagator for <b>the</b> Boulware <b>vacuum,</b> which is a zero-temperature Green's function, we can then {{consider the}} case of a scalar field at an arbitrary temperature by an infinite image imaginary-time sum, which yields the Hartle-Hawking propagator upon setting the temperature to the Hawking temperature.
