25|$|How were <b>the</b> <b>bricks</b> stuck together? One {{hypothesis}} is that the builders at Mỹ Sơn developed a way to glue bricks together using tree resin native to central Vietnam. Another {{hypothesis is}} that the builders used a sticky mortar made from the same clay as <b>the</b> <b>bricks</b> themselves. <b>The</b> latter hypothesis is supported by chemical tests that have found no trace of any organic substance between <b>the</b> <b>bricks,</b> but instead have found mineral substances similar to those present {{in the core of}} <b>the</b> <b>bricks.</b> Today <b>the</b> mortar that once held <b>the</b> <b>bricks</b> together has largely decayed, and even a strong wind can knock loose <b>bricks</b> from <b>the</b> structures.|$|R
5|$|However, further {{excavations}} {{revealed that}} the 8th-century temple was constructed over the remains of an older brick temple. According to Thirumoorthy, the garbhagriha or sanctum sanctorum of <b>the</b> <b>brick</b> temple was filled with sand and covered with granite slabs upon which the newer temple was constructed. Sathyamurthy, Superintendent, ASI Chennai Circle, said that <b>the</b> <b>brick</b> temple could be dated to the Sangam period as the shrine faced north unlike modern temples which face either east or west. This proved conclusively that the temple was constructed before the 6th or 7th century AD when the shilpa shastras, the canonical texts of temple architecture, were written. Estimates {{of the age of}} <b>the</b> <b>brick</b> shrine range from 1700 to 2200 years.|$|E

2500|$|Ash bricks {{have been}} used in house {{construction}} in Windhoek, Namibia since the 1970s.

5|$|The two-story Joseph F. Glidden House is {{constructed}} from locally fired brick, which is relatively soft.

Construction was completed in 1861 and the home is a prominent example of Illinois French Colonial architecture.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} has been conducted to investigate the quality of some <b>bricks.</b> <b>The</b> quality of <b>the</b> <b>bricks</b> was tested after heating by solar energy using concave mirror reflector on their elastic properties.

The elasticity properties were calculated from the time propagation of the seismic wave in <b>the</b> <b>bricks.</b> <b>The</b> results of the research showed that the elasticity of <b>the</b> <b>bricks</b> heated using solar energy for 80 hours was 50. 623 (N/m²), and the lowest elasticity heated for 10 hours was 16. 530 (N/m). While <b>the</b> elasticity of <b>bricks</b> heated using fire with the distance of 0. 7 meters was 72. 199 (N/m²) and the lowest elasticity of <b>bricks</b> with <b>the</b> distance from fire of 0. 76 meter was 32. 555 (N / m²).

The contrary hypothesis is supported by the observation that the structures bear no signs of scarring from large intense fires such as would be needed in order to reheat them as whole.|$|R

5|$|In 1553, {{orders were}} issued for the {{artillery}} pieces {{to be removed}} from the blockhouse and taken to the Tower of London; the fort was then demolished between 1557 and 1558, <b>the</b> <b>brick</b> and stone from the site being reused to repair the Tower. The former site was probably rediscovered during excavations in 1826, but was destroyed during the building of the Gravesend Canal Basin, Canal Road and the Gordon Pleasure Gardens later in the 19th century.

50|$|<b>The</b> Warren <b>Brick</b> Streets of Warren, Arkansas are a {{collection}} of city streets that have retained original brick pavement laid down in the late 1920s.
