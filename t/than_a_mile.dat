5|$|In Syracuse, NY5 is {{parallel}} to I-690 for much of its routing but never encounters the highway, thus making the north–south streets that intersect NY5 entry points to and from I-690. In downtown Syracuse, West Genesee Street becomes James Street. At {{the southern tip of}} the interchange between I-690 and I-81, NY5 transfers onto Erie Boulevard and intersects State Street (US11), but passes under I-81 without access. From the downtown area to DeWitt, NY5 is divided. At the Syracuse–DeWitt boundary, NY5 intersects NY635 and eastward, it curves to a southeast course. Near Shoppingtown Mall, NY5 turns east onto Genesee Street to begin an overlap with NY92. Less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> east of the mall, NY5 and NY92 intersect I-481 at a cloverleaf interchange.|$|E

5|$|It remains {{close to}} the Interstate Highway for about , {{intersecting}} NY237 less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> (1.6km) north of the overpass taking that highway over the Thruway, but leaves it behind for good shortly thereafter as it turns even more to the north, taking it into the town of Bergen and the small village {{of the same name}} in the county's northeast corner. Here, NY33 crosses NY19, a long north–south route. Shortly afterward, NY33A begins to the east while the main route turns to the north yet again and becomes Buffalo Road. Just east of this point, NY33A connects to I-490, which briefly runs along the Monroe County line through this area. From the west end of NY33A to the county line, NY33 and I-490 follow virtually identical northeasterly alignments.|$|E
5|$|Prior to 1847, Detroit {{fought to}} {{maintain}} the Capitol within its jurisdiction, but communities in the growing {{western part of the}} state had many reasons for wanting a move inland, including the need to increase defensibility by moving the state government away from the Canada–US border. Detroit had been occupied during the War of 1812, and the border area of Michigan of less <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario, at the Detroit River continued to be occupied by British troops on both banks. Proponents of moving the capitol also sought to promote settlement and the economy in the interior, as well as making the government more accessible to the people throughout the state.|$|E

The SR364 and SR703 concurrency travels northwestward, and SR364 splits and heads north, after slightly more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile.</b> SR364 crosses a railroad track, and ends at an diamond interchange at SR29. The road continues as County Road15 after this point.|$|E
5|$|Steve Prefontaine {{arrived on}} campus in 1969 and immediately, head coach Bowerman and {{assistant}} coach Bill Dellinger had their hands full {{to rein in}} the rebellious new athlete. The bold running style of Prefontaine, front-running, was a strategy that altered the pace of the sport. At one point, Prefontaine held every American distance record above the 2,000 meters and was thought of by many {{to be one of the}} greatest American runners in history. Prefontaine had never lost a race longer <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> during his collegiate career and won a total of seven NCAA championships in track and field and cross country. He raced in the 5000m at the 1972 Olympics in Munich, placing fourth in the race. He died in an automobile accident in Eugene in 1975, at the peak of his career.|$|E
5|$|Teller {{was one of}} {{the strongest}} and best-known advocates for {{investigating}} non-military uses of nuclear explosives, which the United States explored under Operation Plowshare. One of the most controversial projects he proposed was a plan to use a multi-megaton hydrogen bomb to dig a deep-water harbor more <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>mile</b> long and half a mile wide to use for shipment of resources from coal and oil fields through Point Hope, Alaska. The Atomic Energy Commission accepted Teller's proposal in 1958 and it was designated Project Chariot. While the AEC was scouting out the Alaskan site, and having withdrawn the land from the public domain, Teller publicly advocated the economic benefits of the plan, but was unable to convince local government leaders that the plan was financially viable.|$|E
