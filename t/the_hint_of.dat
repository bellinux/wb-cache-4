25|$|The label's biggest early star, soul singer Otis Redding, also {{arrived in}} 1962. Redding, however, {{technically}} {{was not on}} Stax, but on its sister label Volt. In that era, many radio stations, anxious to avoid even <b>the</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> payola, often refused to play {{more than one or}} two new songs from any single record label at one time, so as to not appear to be offering favoritism to any particular label. To circumvent this, Stax, like many other record companies, created a number of subsidiary labels. Volt, founded in late 1961, was the label home to Otis Redding, the Bar-Kays, and a handful of other artists. Volt releases were initially issued by Atlantic through its subsidiary Atco Records. Other Stax subsidiaries over the years included Enterprise, Chalice (a gospel label), Hip, and Safice.|$|E
25|$|New Zealand's batting effort started quietly, with Irfan Pathan using <b>the</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> {{swing to}} bowl a maiden to captain Fleming first up. But {{inaccurate}} line and length {{in the next}} five overs allowed New Zealand to plunder 62, Fleming hitting five fours from the 5th over, and the run rate raced along. By the end of 15 power play overs, New Zealand had made 112 for no loss, Fleming having made a 51-ball half-century while Astle was on 45. Ganguly turned to his spinners, banking on Virender Sehwag to give him a few tight overs, and he complied. The first over conceded four runs, and in his second he held a return catch as Fleming went for 61. Four balls later, Hamish Marshall was out for 3, and India were in with a small shout. However, well-timed innings from Scott Styris, who made 37, and Craig McMillan with 13, and the occasional awful over – JP Yadav's only contribution to the match was a 14-run over – left New Zealand with 72 in 12.3 overs with six wickets in hand. With Lou Vincent and Nathan Astle in good hitting form – they took 17 off a Harbhajan over as Astle brought up his 100 with his first six of the match – this was no problem, and Vincent won New Zealand the game by hitting Agarkar for four with 11 balls to spare.|$|E

500|$|Several critics {{noted the}} film's subtext, {{and found it}} {{successful}} to varying degrees. Saw Tek Meng acknowledged, [...] "Sarah's experiences in the labyrinth are symbolic of her transition from child to woman" [...] but ultimately found the film [...] "too linear" [...] for its latent themes to come through. Nina Darnton compared the film's tone to the writings of E.T.A. Hoffman, stating that Hoffman's The Nutcracker [...] "is also about the voyage to womanhood, including <b>the</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> sexual awakening, which Sarah experiences too {{in the presence of}} a goblin king."

Johanson's drum fills were pulled from Jimmy Cobb's performance on [...] "All Blues"; he later commented that he [...] "did a lot of copying, but only from the best."

500|$|For {{the naked}} scenes, Spears cleared the set, leaving only Kahn, Blackburn and Rushing {{with her to}} shoot the sequence. Spears also shot scenes {{in which she had}} to dance through a hallway of {{imaginary}} lasers in front of a green screen, something that Kahn deemed as [...] "incredible to watch". The last few scenes of the video in which Spears murders her boyfriend, concerned Kahn, who thought they would be censored. He explained [...] "the trick was to make it look pop at the same time" [...] and told Henderson [...] "'Would you like to be kissed by Britney Spears?'". According to Kahn, <b>the</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> a smile that appears on Henderson's face before Spears pours the poison into his mouth was what managed to get the shot past censors.

Even prior to the airing of the episode, James Hibberd of Entertainment Weekly suggested that the actor's voice would be perfect for an animated television series. VanDerWerff and Carp were amongst the journalists who issued favorable assessments of Cranston's acting. Carp noted that [...] "Cranston's work is even more impressive {{when you consider that}} he not only plays the hero and villain but manages to be funny as both." [...] In addressing [...] "Part II", Carp concluded that [...] "as early as the stunning end of the world sequence, the actor plants <b>the</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> suppressed craziness in Spaceman Drake and it was soon obvious that the just crew would not only be manning a mission to help him combat the mutineers but probably get wrapped up in this nut's dream to terra form Mars." [...] For VanDerWerff, [...] "Cranston is the very best kind of guest voice, fully inhabiting his character but also {{having a lot of fun}} with the jokes. It’s a nice reminder of just how funny Cranston can be, and I hope he gets even more bizarre stuff to do next week."

2500|$|A {{change of}} command in 1952, however, contributed to Barnes {{getting into a}} {{conflict}} with the United States Air Force.

[...] That new runway would run directly across her ranch. [...] The Air Force originally offered her a price for her ranch, land, and facilities that was very close to the cost of undeveloped desert land.

2500|$|Flyer was {{designed}} to be the fastest propeller-driven vessel in the Pacific Northwest, and was very fine-lined, that is, tall and narrow. [...] Captain Scott was so proud of his new ship that he rode on her as she was launched into the Willamette River. This proved to be a mistake. [...] Neither boilers nor engines had been installed in Flyer before launch, and without their weight deep in her hull to act as ballast, she simply flopped over in the water, and Captain Scott had to exit by climbing out a window. After that, another hull was built around her with the hope of making her a little less top–heavy, but this was imperfectly sealed, so water sloshed around in between the hulls {{for the rest of the}} vessel's operational life. Surprisingly, this did not affect the Flyers speed, although she did acquire a permanent list to port, or at least <b>the</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> a list. Once finally completed, the company sent Flyer to Puget Sound and brought Bailey Gatzert around to the Columbia River to run with the Telephone.|$|E
2500|$|The modern {{development}} of calculus is usually credited to Isaac Newton (1643–1727) and Gottfried Leibniz (1646–1716), who provided independent and unified approaches to differentiation and derivatives. The key insight, however, that earned them this credit, was the fundamental theorem of calculus relating differentiation and integration: this rendered obsolete most previous methods for computing areas and volumes, {{which had not}} been significantly extended {{since the time of}} Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen). For their ideas on derivatives, both Newton and Leibniz built on significant earlier work by mathematicians such as Pierre de Fermat (1607-1665), Isaac Barrow (1630–1677), René Descartes (1596–1650), Christiaan Huygens (1629–1695), Blaise Pascal (1623–1662) and John Wallis (1616–1703). Regarding Fermat's influence, Newton once wrote in a letter that [...] "I had <b>the</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> this method [...] from Fermat's way of drawing tangents, and by applying it to abstract equations, directly and invertedly, I made it general." [...] Isaac Barrow is generally given credit for the early {{development of}} the derivative. Nevertheless, Newton and Leibniz remain key figures in the history of differentiation, not least because Newton was the first to apply differentiation to theoretical physics, while Leibniz systematically developed much of the notation still used today.|$|E
