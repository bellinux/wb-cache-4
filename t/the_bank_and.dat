5|$|The {{execution}} prompts the ESU team into action. They plan {{to storm}} <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>and</b> use rubber bullets {{to knock out}} those inside. Frazier discovers that the robbers have planted a listening device on the police; aware of the police plans, the robbers detonate smoke grenades and release the hostages. The police detain and question everyone but are unable to distinguish the identically dressed hostages from the robbers. A search of the bank reveals the robbers' weapons were plastic replicas. They find props for faking the execution, but no money or valuables {{appear to have been}} stolen. With no way to identify the suspects and unsure if a crime has even been committed, Frazier's superior orders him to drop the case.|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation found}} a {{simulated engine failure}} procedure was being conducted, which involved {{a member of the}} crew pulling back the throttle lever for engine No. 4 prior to taking off. Investigators found that if the throttle lever was pulled back too far, it would cause the propeller to reversea feature designed to slow the aircraft upon landing. Once the landing gear was raised, the crew would have to raise a metal flag in the cockpit to bring the propeller blades back into the correct position, since a safety device prevented electric power from operating the rotating mechanism at the roots of the blades unless the aircraft was on the ground or the flag was manually raised. The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) concluded one of the flight crew applied full power to No. 4 engine, thinking this would bring the aircraft out of the increasing bank. Because the blades were reversed and the flag was not raised, that increased the reverse thrust from No. 4 engine, causing the DC-6 to spiral out of control. Since the plane was so close to the ground, the suddenness of <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>and</b> dive meant the flight crew had no chance to recover the aircraft before impact.|$|E
5|$|Another {{opponent}} to {{the project}} was the Action Committee Against a Hasty Construction of the Triangle Link, who wanted to delay the decision until after the 1991 municipal elections {{to ensure that the}} municipal councils had backing in the public. Gisle Tjong was another opponent, who stated that the risk in the project was large and that it was uncertain how long the tolls would last: they could just as well last 60 as 15 years. Instead, he wanted to use advanced tolls and fuel fees, place the income in <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>and</b> then pay the whole fixed link with the accumulated funds. Most of the opposition against the project was from Stord, while in Bømlo there was overwhelming support. However, in southern Bømlo there were concerns that they would lose their ferry, as they would have a much longer rout to Haugesund via the Triangle Link. Some also stated that it was necessary to keep a ferry for people with fear of tunnels.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, UBS {{announced}} the planned cut of 8,700 jobs and had implemented a new compensation plan. Under the plan, {{no more than}} one-third of any cash bonus would be paid out in the year it is earned with the rest to be held in reserve and stock-based incentives that would vest after three years; top executives would have to hold 75% of any vested shares. Additionally, the bank's chairman, Peter Kurer, would no longer receive any extra variable compensation, only a cash salary and a fixed allotment of shares that could not be sold for four years. In April 2009, UBS announced that it agreed to sell its Brazilian financial services business, UBS Pactual, for approximately US$2.5billion to BTG Investments.

5|$|During a lunchtime tryst in Phoenix, Arizona, a {{real estate}} {{secretary}} named Marion Crane discusses with her boyfriend, Sam Loomis, how they cannot afford to get married because of Sam's debts. After lunch, Marion returns to work, where a client drops off a $40,000 cash payment on a property. Her boss asks her to deposit the money in <b>the</b> <b>bank,</b> <b>and</b> she asks if she can {{take the rest of}} the afternoon off. Returning home, she begins to pack, deciding to steal the money and give it to Sam in Fairvale, California. She is seen by her boss on her way out of town, which makes her nervous. During the trip, she pulls over on the side of the road and falls asleep, only to be awakened by a state patrol officer. Suspicious about her nervous behavior, he notes her license plate number and follows her at a close distance. Hoping to shake his pursuit, Marion stops at an automobile dealership and trades in her Ford Mainline, with its Arizona license plates, for a Ford Custom 300 that has California tags.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, UBS {{agreed to}} pay US$160 million in restitution, {{penalties}} and disgorgement of profits for rigging bids in the U.S. municipal bond market, after <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>and</b> three of its employees were charged by the U.S. Department of Justice in 2010. In July 2013, the three employees were convicted of conspiracy in the muni market fraud: former UBS Vice President Gary Heinz was sentenced to 27 months in prison and fined US$400,000; former UBS global commodities chief Peter Ghavami was sentenced to 18 months and fined US $1 million; and former UBS VP Michael Welty received a 16-month sentence and fined US$300,000. In addition to conspiracy, Ghavami and Heinz also were convicted of wire fraud. Federal prosecutors had asked for much harsher sentences, but U.S. District Judge Kimba Wood rebuffed the request. Wood said that the criminal behavior of the three was an aberration from their normal law-abiding lives.|$|E

After making a scathing yet highly acclaimed on-air speech concerning {{the way in which}} WWE is run and its owner Vince McMahon, he was given a storyline suspension from televised WWE events but was reinstated the following week on Cena's insistence. Upon his return, Punk ceased to appear with the remaining members of Nexus and the group quietly dissolved that month. This helped transition him from a villainous character back to being a fan-favorite. Two weeks later, at Money in the Bank, Punk defeated John Cena to become the WWE Champion on his final night under contract with WWE.|$|E
5|$|On 7 February 1934, Whittle {{was walking}} through University Park {{when he was}} accosted by a small boy who said that his younger brother {{had fallen into the}} lake.

Whittle left the scene and proceeded home in a taxi without leaving his name, but his identity was subsequently discovered and he was presented with a Certificate of Merit by the Royal Life Saving Society.

5|$|Pierce {{departed}} in November 1833 for Washington, D.C., {{where the}} Twenty-third United States Congress convened its regular session on December 2. Jackson's second term was under way, and the House {{had a strong}} Democratic majority, whose primary focus was to prevent the Second Bank of the United States from being rechartered. The Democrats, including Pierce, defeated proposals supported by the newly formed Whig Party, and the bank's charter expired. Pierce broke from his party on occasion, opposing Democratic bills to fund internal improvements with federal money. He saw both <b>the</b> <b>bank</b> <b>and</b> infrastructure spending as unconstitutional, with internal improvements {{the responsibility of the}} states. Pierce's first term was fairly uneventful from a legislative standpoint, and he was easily re-elected in March 1835. When not in Washington, he attended to his law practice, and in December 1835 returned to the capital for the Twenty-fourth Congress.|$|E
