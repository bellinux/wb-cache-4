5|$|Benjamin {{became a}} {{specialist}} in commercial law, of which {{there was a great}} deal in New Orleans' busy river port—a center of international commerce and the domestic slave trade. By 1840, the city had become the fourth largest in the United States and among the wealthiest. Many of the best lawyers in the country practiced commercial law there, and Benjamin successfully competed with <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> <b>one</b> case, he successfully represented the seller of a slave against allegations that the seller knew the slave had incurable tuberculosis. Although Benjamin tried some jury cases, he preferred bench trials in commercial cases and was an expert at appeals.|$|E
5|$|Courtney {{started his}} career in the youth system of Derby County as a schoolboy and later played for Birmingham City as a trainee. He played for A.F.C. Telford United in the 2004–05 season and after being named their Player of the Season he joined Burnley in the Football League. After making eight {{appearances}} for <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> season he was released and joined Welsh Premier League champions The New Saints in 2006. He played for them for three seasons before returning to England with Conference Premier club Kidderminster Harriers in 2009. He left Kidderminster after one season to sign for York City, who released him in 2011. He then played for Tamworth but left after their relegation to the Conference North to join Alfreton Town in 2014.|$|E
5|$|In 1964, Wilhelm {{finished}} with career highs in both saves (27) and games pitched (73). His ERA decreased to 1.99 that season; it remained less than 2.00 through the 1968 season. In 1965, Wilhelm contributed to another passed balls record when Chicago catcher J. C. Martin allowed 33 of <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> season. That total set a modern single-season baseball {{record for the}} category. Wilhelm's career-low ERA (1.31) came in 1967, when he earned an 8–3 record for the White Sox with 12 saves.|$|E

5|$|The battle site at Kellogg's Grove {{was listed}} on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on June 23, 1978. The listing {{included}} a 1½ acre public park where a stone monument and memorial cemetery is located. The cemetery holds the interred remains of the militia who died during both battles at Kellogg's Grove. The men were initially buried in other spots around the grove but during the 1880s local farmers banded together to collect {{the remains of the}} Black Hawk War dead and inter <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> spot beneath a memorial.|$|E
5|$|Rapists of virgins and {{children}} are also attested to have been buried alive, with a stake driven through <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> <b>one</b> such judicial tradition, the rapist was {{to be placed in}} an open grave, and the rape victim was ordered to make the three first strokes on the stake herself; the executioners then finishing the impalement procedure. Serving {{as an example of the}} fate of a child molester, in August 1465 in Zurich, Switzerland, Ulrich Moser was condemned to be impaled, for having sexually violated six girls between the ages four and nine. His clothes were taken off, and he was placed on his back. His arms and legs were stretched out, each secured to a pole. Then a stake was driven through his navel down into the ground. Thereafter, people left him to die.|$|E

25|$|Problematic point(s):, linguistically speaking, {{these do}} not {{constitute}} an actual compound (because the meaning is not institutionalized), {{so there is no}} sound reason for writing <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> word. In addition, the normal alternative for writing in one word is writing with hyphens, rather than writing separately, so this opposition is unusual in Hungarian orthography.|$|E

He was the first patron to welcome <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> of his villas on Via Merulana. The first volume of the Rime degli Arcadi was dedicated to Francesco Maria. In 1725 the Arcadia took permanent residence in the Gianicolo villa of Bosco Parrasio.|$|E
25|$|The Division of the North {{came under}} the command of Marshal Jean-Baptiste Bernadotte who was tasked with {{defending}} the southwestern shore of the Baltic Sea. In addition to La Romana's Spaniards, the marshal controlled 30,000 Danish troops plus French and Dutch units. Napoleon, whose plans to seize Spain were well advanced, made sure that the Spanish units were spread out so that {{it would be difficult to}} assemble <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> place. Furthermore, Danish troops were always posted nearby.|$|E

25|$|Cyril Frederick Walters (28 August 1905 – 23 December 1992) was a Welsh cricketer who {{had most}} of his success after leaving Glamorgan to do duty as captain-secretary of Worcestershire.

However, he unexpectedly completely gave up cricket soon after that, to the dismay of his country and county.|$|E
25|$|According {{to their}} interpretations of HIPAA, {{hospitals}} will not reveal information {{over the phone}} to relatives of admitted patients. This has in some instances impeded the location of missing persons. After the Asiana Airlines Flight 214 San Francisco crash, some hospitals were reluctant to disclose the identities of passengers that they were treating, {{making it difficult for}} Asiana and the relatives to locate <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> <b>one</b> instance, a man in Washington state was unable to obtain information about his injured mother.|$|E

25|$|Southwest Asian Neanderthals are Neanderthals {{that lived}} in Turkey, Lebanon, Israel, Syria, Iraq, and Iran, the southernmost expanse of their known range. Although their arrival in Asia is not well-dated, early Neanderthals {{occupied}} the region apparently until about 100,000 years ago. At this time, Homo sapiens seems to have replaced <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> of the first anatomically modern expansions out of Africa. In their turn, starting around 80,000 years ago, Neanderthals seem to have replaced Homo sapiens in Southwest Asia. They inhabited the region until about 55,000 years ago.|$|E

The wild look coupled with his wild brawling style made Bull Curry one of the most hated rule-breakers in wrestling, he was so hated in places that riots broke out more than once as irate fans attacked Curry in the ring.|$|E
25|$|The {{sides of}} the pulpit erupt like stylized petals from the stem {{supporting}} it.

The handrail of the stairway curving its way around the pillar from ground level to the pulpit has fantastic decorations of toads and lizards biting each other, symbolizing the fight of good against evil.

25|$|Because of {{inadequate}} early warning systems (the first British radar stations became operational only {{towards the end}} of February), Japanese air raids were able to destroy 30 Hurricanes on the ground in Sumatra, most of <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>one</b> raid on 7 February. After Japanese landings in Singapore, on 10 February, the remnants of 232 and 488 Squadrons were withdrawn to Palembang. However, Japanese paratroopers began the invasion of Sumatra on 13 February. Hurricanes destroyed six Japanese transport ships on 14 February, but lost seven aircraft in the process. On 18 February, the remaining Allied aircraft and aircrews moved to Java. By this time, only 18 serviceable Hurricanes remained out of the original 99.|$|E
25|$|Memorabilia are {{singular}} objects {{which are}} passed {{down through the}} family with the stories and memories about events or individuals attached to <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> <b>one</b> family a doll, given once as a Christmas present, continued to be brought out each year to celebrate Christmas and have her picture taken with the (changing) family. For her hundredth birthday, a birthday cake for the doll {{was included in the}} Christmas celebration. Like the doll, almost any object imbued with family stories and memories can become a family heirloom. As such, it holds in the family a value often unrelated to its monetary value. As the stories and memories enveloping the object are slowly lost, the object itself becomes a simple hand-me-down, usually in poor condition and ready to be discarded.|$|E
