5|$|Although the VB-13 {{project had}} not reached the testing stage {{by the end}} of World War II, it avoided being cancelled, {{proceeding}} as a low-priority project. Limited <b>testing</b> <b>was</b> conducted during 1948 and 1949; additional testing at Alamogordo, New Mexico in 1950 led to the Tarzon being approved for operational service in the Korean War.|$|E
5|$|Batman: The Dark Knight was {{announced}} to the public on February 6, 2002 though construction had started in September 2001. After construction and <b>testing</b> <b>was</b> completed by Martin & Vleminckx, the ride officially opened on April 20, 2002.|$|E
30|$|The Mann–Whitney U <b>test</b> <b>was</b> used {{to compare}} {{continuous}} variables between two groups, and Fisher’s exact <b>test</b> <b>was</b> {{used to compare}} dichotomous variables between two groups. The Mantel–Haenszel χ 2 <b>test</b> <b>was</b> used for comparisons between two groups involving ordered categorical variables, and the χ 2 <b>test</b> <b>was</b> used to compare groups involving non-ordered categorical variables. Correlations were analyzed with Spearman’s rank correlation. All <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> two-tailed and conducted at the 5 % significance level. Wilcoxon signed-rank <b>test</b> <b>was</b> used when comparing two related samples.|$|R
50|$|While monkey <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> {{sometimes}} {{treated the}} same as fuzz testing and the two terms are usually used together, some believe they are different by arguing that monkey <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> more about random actions while fuzz <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> more about random data input. Monkey <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> also different from ad-hoc testing in that ad-hoc <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> performed without planning and documentation and the objective of ad-hoc <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> to divide the system randomly into subparts and check their functionality, {{which is not the}} case in monkey testing.|$|R
30|$|In general terms, a {{positive}} likelihood ratio {{of more than}} 10 indicates that a <b>test</b> <b>is</b> good at confirming disease if the <b>test</b> <b>is</b> positive and a negative likelihood ratio of less than 0.1 indicates that the <b>test</b> <b>is</b> good at excluding disease when the <b>test</b> <b>is</b> negative.|$|R
5|$|During the manufacturer's flight tests, the Yak-19 {{became the}} first Soviet {{aircraft}} to exceed 900km/h. Major Sergei Anokhin was the primary test pilot and reported that the aircraft had pleasant and predictable flying characteristics and presented no difficulties for the average pilot. Before the <b>testing</b> <b>was</b> completed, Anokhin led the jets participating in the flypast at Tushino Airfield on 3 August.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, archaeological <b>testing</b> <b>was</b> {{conducted}} {{at the site of}} the former home of Molly Brant in Kingston, Ontario, in preparation for a construction project. Salvage excavations were carried out in 1989. Much of the original site of the Brant homestead had been disturbed by industrial activities.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1941, a WPA crew {{excavated}} a number of lodges, cache pits, and graves at the site. Some testing and surface collecting were conducted in 1943. More recently, a magnetic survey was conducted over {{a portion of the}} village in 1982, and some <b>testing</b> <b>was</b> carried out in 1987.|$|E
5000|$|Confirmatory <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> the <b>tests</b> {{required}} {{to confirm the}} analysis. Confirmatory tests cost more than simpler presumptive tests so presumptive <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> often done to see if confirmatory <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> necessary.|$|R
50|$|The <b>test</b> <b>is</b> finally produced. Trial {{questions}} are included and various {{versions of the}} <b>test</b> <b>are</b> prepared to avoid cheating. The <b>test</b> <b>is</b> printed in booklets that include test instructions and test items.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Mechanical {{reliability}} <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> {{the focus}} in the research of reliability testing at present. The basic concepts of reliability <b>testing</b> <b>are</b> introduced. Names of reliability <b>testing</b> <b>are</b> sorted. Characteristics of mechanical reliability <b>testing</b> <b>are</b> discussed. The key issues of mechanical reliability testing and its development are then reviewed. Finally, some possible fields in the research are summarized...|$|R
5|$|On 15May 1930, barely {{two weeks}} after delivery, one of the Bulldogs crashed due to {{structural}} failure while performing an inverted loop; the pilot parachuted to safety, the first time an RAAF member had done so in an emergency. In September 1931, Fighter Squadron began flight testing the prototype Wackett Warrigal general-purpose biplane; <b>testing</b> <b>was</b> still under way when the aircraft's undercarriage collapsed during landing, putting off its service trials until the following January.|$|E
5|$|The Command and Service Modules were mated in the KSC {{altitude}} chamber in September, and combined system <b>testing</b> <b>was</b> performed. Altitude <b>testing</b> <b>was</b> performed first unmanned, then {{with both the}} prime and backup crews, from October 10 through December 30. During this testing, the Environmental Control Unit in the Command Module {{was found to have}} a design flaw, and was sent back to the manufacturer for design changes and rework. The returned ECU then leaked water/glycol coolant, and had to be returned a second time. Also during this time, a propellant tank in Service Module 017 had ruptured during testing at NAA, prompting the separation of the modules and removal from the chamber so the Service Module could be tested for signs of the tank problem. These tests were negative.|$|E
5|$|The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) {{announced}} in 2010 that a biodiversity study from 2009 {{in the gallery}} forest of Ranobe near Toliara in southwestern Madagascar revealed a population of giant mouse lemurs previously unknown to science, and possibly a new species. They noted {{a significant difference in}} coloration between the two known species and the specimen they observed. However, further <b>testing</b> <b>was</b> required to confirm the discovery.|$|E
30|$|Qualitative {{phytochemical}} <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> {{carried out}} for the identification of alkaloids, glycosides, flavonoids, saponins, tannin, gums, and terpenoids in the samples [12]. Alkaloids were detected using the Dragendroff’s, Mayer’s, Hager’s and Wagner’s tests. Lead acetate, alkaline reagent, ferric chloride and ammonia <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> used for detection of flavonoids. Legal’s test, Molisch, Keller-Kiliani and Borntrager’s <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> performed to identify glycosides. For identification of tannin potassium dichromate test, ferric chloride, potassium hydroxide and lead acetate <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> followed. Salkowski <b>test</b> and froth <b>test</b> <b>were</b> used to detect the presence of terpenoids and for saponins respectively. Molisch <b>test</b> <b>was</b> performed for detecting the existence of gum in the samples.|$|R
50|$|A <b>test</b> tube <b>is</b> {{filled with}} {{distilled}} water and acetic acid is added. To this mixture one drop of the effusion to <b>be</b> <b>tested</b> <b>is</b> added. If the drop dissipates, the <b>test</b> <b>is</b> negative, indicating a transudate. If the drop precipitates, the <b>test</b> <b>is</b> positive, indicating an exudate.|$|R
30|$|The Pearson Chi Square {{test and}} Fisher’s exact <b>test</b> <b>were</b> used for {{comparisons}} of the categorical variables. The Mann–Whitney U test and Wilcoxon Signed rank <b>test</b> <b>were</b> used for the comparison of the two groups. Kruskal–Wallis, One way Anova, and Welch <b>test</b> <b>were</b> used for the comparison {{of more than two}} groups. Spearman’s Rho <b>test</b> <b>was</b> used to analyze correlations among the variables.|$|R
5|$|The basic {{engineering}} {{for all the}} German half-tracks was developed during the Weimar-era by the Reichswehr's Military Automotive Department, but final design and <b>testing</b> <b>was</b> farmed out to commercial firms {{with the understanding that}} production would be shared with multiple companies. Demag was chosen to develop the smallest of the German half-tracks and spent the years between 1934 and 1938 perfecting the design through a series of prototypes.|$|E
5|$|The codex {{was tested}} in the Instituto de Física of the Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México in Mexico City using a 3 megaelectronvolt pelletron {{particle}} accelerator. Testing methods applied to the codex included ultraviolet imaging, infrared reflectography, optical microscopy, particle-induced X-ray emission and Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS). The specific aim of this non-destructive <b>testing</b> <b>was</b> to compare the materials used in the codex with those used in other pre-Columbian codices.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept for}} the high-explosive pumpkin bomb was {{originated}} in December 1944 by U.S. Navy Captain William S. Parsons, {{the head of}} the Ordnance Division at Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory, and United States Army Air Forces Lieutenant Colonel Paul W. Tibbets, commander of the 509th Composite Group. Prior <b>testing</b> <b>was</b> carried out with an inert version.|$|E
50|$|The frontal <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> {{performed}} at 64 km/h into an offset deformable barrier. This {{is designed to}} represent an impact with a vehicle of similar mass and structure as the car itself.The side impact <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> {{performed at}} 50 km/h, but the side impact pole <b>test</b> <b>is</b> performed at 32 km/h. The pedestrian safety <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> performed at 40 km/h.|$|R
30|$|Pearson’s χ 2 <b>test</b> <b>was</b> used {{to perform}} {{categorical}} analysis, and Spearman’s correlation <b>test</b> <b>was</b> {{used to determine}} correlations. For further evaluations, univariate analysis of variance, the paired t-test, the Kruskall–Wallis test and the Mann–Whitney-U <b>tests</b> <b>were</b> used.|$|R
50|$|The Mann-Whitney U test / Wilcoxon rank-sum <b>test</b> <b>is</b> not {{the same}} as the Wilcoxon signed-rank <b>test,</b> {{although}} both <b>are</b> nonparametric and involve summation of ranks. The Mann-Whitney U <b>test</b> <b>is</b> applied to independent samples. The Wilcoxon signed-rank <b>test</b> <b>is</b> applied to matched or dependent samples.|$|R
5|$|The {{remains were}} {{conclusively}} identified as Bormann's in 1998 when German authorities ordered genetic testing on {{fragments of the}} skull. The <b>testing</b> <b>was</b> led by Wolfgang Eisenmenger, Professor of Forensic Science at Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich. Tests using DNA {{from one of his}} relatives identified the skull as that of Bormann. Bormann's remains were cremated and the ashes were scattered in the Baltic Sea on 16 August 1999.|$|E
5|$|According to {{production}} staff, scenes involving the alien queen {{were the most}} difficult to film. A life-sized mock-up was created by Stan Winston's company in the United States to see how it would operate. Once the <b>testing</b> <b>was</b> complete, the crew working on the queen flew to England and began work creating the final version. Standing at 14 feet (4.3 m) tall, it was operated using a mixture of puppeteers, control rods, hydraulics, cables, and a crane above to support it. Two puppeteers were inside the suit operating its arms, and 16 were required to move it. All sequences involving the full size queen were filmed in-camera with no post-production manipulation. Additionally, a miniature alien queen was used for certain shots.|$|E
5|$|After Leonard I. Schiff {{calculated}} that an initiator could theoretically improve {{the efficiency of}} a gun-type fission weapon, Oppenheimer gave approval on 15 March 1945 for initiators {{to be included in}} the Little Boy design. <b>Testing</b> <b>was</b> carried out to ensure that the initiators were rugged enough to handle being transported in an airplane and being accidentally dropped. Eventually, about forty initiators were despatched to Tinian, where four were inserted into the bomb that was used in the bombing of Hiroshima.|$|E
50|$|Copy <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> <b>testing</b> that evaluates {{advertising}} copy and creative executions. In this section, the principal methods of copy <b>testing</b> <b>are</b> briefly discussed.|$|R
30|$|The island {{partition}} {{result is}} not feasible if the DER dispatch test or the power flow <b>test</b> <b>is</b> not passed. Model modification and adjustment strategies {{corresponding to the}} <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> given in this section. Firstly, the cases that fail the DER dispatch <b>test</b> <b>are</b> analyzed and modification of the constraint set is proposed. Secondly, adjustment strategies based on the power flow <b>test</b> <b>are</b> given.|$|R
50|$|Automated <b>testing</b> <b>is</b> {{advantageous}} for {{a number}} of reasons: <b>tests</b> may <b>be</b> executed continuously without the need for human intervention, they are easily repeatable, and often faster. Automated <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> useful in situations where the <b>test</b> <b>is</b> to be executed several times, for example as part of regression testing. Automated <b>tests</b> can <b>be</b> disadvantageous when poorly written, leading to incorrect testing or broken tests being carried out.|$|R
5|$|After the British Grand Prix on 15 July, eight teams {{conducted}} mid-season {{testing at}} the Autodromo Nazionale Monza between 17–20 July {{to prepare for}} the upcoming German Grand Prix at the Hockenheimring. Ricardo Zonta set the fastest times on the first day, ahead of McLaren test driver Alexander Wurz. Michael Schumacher lost control of the rear-end of his car at the Seconda Variante chicane, causing him to slide along the barriers and his car rested in the tyre barriers. <b>Testing</b> <b>was</b> suspended for one hour for the barriers to be repaired. Ferrari later found the crash occurred by a broken diffuser from riding on the kerbs which created a loss of downforce under braking. Michael Schumacher took a medical check and was declared fit to race. Ralf Schumacher was fastest on the second day where it was held in wet weather conditions during the afternoon. Sauber and BAR went to Circuit Ricardo Tormo for three days where aerodyamic and set-up <b>testing</b> <b>was</b> undertaken. Coulthard was scheduled to join Wurz during the session but withdrew because of food poisoning. Irvine was quickest on the third and final days of testing. Arrows elected not to perform any testing and concentrated on work on aerodynamics at their headquarters at Leafield.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Hodgson's appeal, Operation Iceberg {{was created by the}} Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC) with the aim of using DNA {{evidence}} in pre-1990 rape or murder cases. This led to the review of 240 other convictions. The CCRC also requested that the Crown Prosecution Service identify and review similar murder cases from the time before DNA <b>testing</b> <b>was</b> available. In September 2009, on the basis of DNA evidence from his exhumed body, police named David Lace as the likely killer. Lace, who was 17 {{at the time of the}} murder, had confessed to police in 1983 that he had raped and killed DeSimone, but officers refused to believe him. Lace committed suicide in December 1988.|$|E
5|$|Carbon dating {{carried out}} at the University of Edinburgh dated the skull to between 1650 and 1880, while {{the fact that it}} had been {{deposited}} on top of a layer of Victorian tiles suggested that it belonged to the end of this era. The skull had fracture marks consistent with Webster's account of throwing Thomas down the stairs, and it was found to have low collagen levels, consistent with it being boiled. In July 2011, the coroner concluded that the skull was indeed that of Thomas. DNA <b>testing</b> <b>was</b> not possible as she had died childless and no relatives could be traced; in addition, there was no record of where the rest of her body had been buried.|$|E
40|$|The multisample {{version of}} the Cucconi rank test for the two-sample location-scale problem is proposed. Even though little known, the Cucconi <b>test</b> <b>is</b> of {{interest}} for several reasons. The <b>test</b> <b>is</b> compared with some Lepage-type <b>tests.</b> It <b>is</b> shown that the multisample Cucconi <b>test</b> <b>is</b> slightly {{more powerful than the}} multisample Lepage test. Moreover, its <b>test</b> statistic can <b>be</b> computed analytically whereas several others cannot. A practical application example in experimental nutrition is presented. An R function to perform the multisample Cucconi <b>test</b> <b>is</b> given...|$|R
50|$|In {{time series}} analysis, two {{well-known}} {{versions of a}} portmanteau <b>test</b> <b>are</b> available for <b>testing</b> for autocorrelation in the residuals of a model: it tests whether any {{of a group of}} autocorrelations of the residual time series are different from zero. This <b>test</b> <b>is</b> the Ljung-Box <b>test,</b> which <b>is</b> an improved version of the Box-Pierce <b>test,</b> having <b>been</b> devised at essentially the same time; a seemingly trivial simplification (omitted in the improved <b>test)</b> <b>was</b> found to have a deleterious effect. This portmanteau <b>test</b> <b>is</b> useful in working with ARIMA models.|$|R
40|$|The finite sample {{properties}} of recent <b>tests</b> of contagion <b>are</b> investigated using {{a range of}} Monte Carlo experiments. Some variations of these <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> also investigated to correct for size distortions and weak instrument problems. The finite sample {{results show that the}} Forbes-Rigobon and Pesaran-Pick <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> conservative <b>tests,</b> while the Favero-Giavazzi and Bae-Karolyi-Stulz <b>tests</b> <b>are</b> oversized. Two proposed variants of the Forbes and Rigobon <b>test</b> <b>are</b> shown to improve upon the sampling {{properties of}} this test. The change in the correlation <b>test</b> <b>is</b> shown to be a non-monotonic function of the strength of contagion resulting in non-monotonic power functions...|$|R
