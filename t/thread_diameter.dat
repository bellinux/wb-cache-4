2500|$|On {{turned parts}} an {{undercut}} {{is also known}} as a neck or [...] "relief groove". They are often used {{at the end of the}} threaded portion of a shaft or screw to provide clearance for the cutting tool, and also referred to as thread relief in this context. A rule of thumb is that the undercut should be at least 1.5 threads long and the diameter should be at least [...] smaller than the minor diameter of the thread. Strictly speaking the relief simply needs to be equal or slightly smaller than the minor diameter of the thread. [...] Thread relief can also be internal on a bore, and then the relief needs to be larger than the major <b>thread</b> <b>diameter.</b> [...] They are also often used on shafts that have diameter changes so that a mating part can seat against the shoulder. If an undercut is not provided there is always a small radius left behind even if a sharp corner is intended. These types of undercuts are called out on technical drawings by stating the width and either the depth or the diameter of the bottom of the neck.|$|E

40|$|This {{document}} {{describes a}} fatigue lifetime acceptance test criterion by which studs having rolled threads, larger than 1. 0 inches in diameter, {{can be assured}} to meet minimum quality attributes associated with a controlled rolling process. This criterion is derived from a stress dependent, room temperature air fatigue database for test studs having a 0. 625 inch <b>diameter</b> <b>threads</b> of Alloys X- 750 HTH and direct aged 625. Anticipated fatigue lives of larger threads are based on thread root elastic stress concentration factors which increase with increasing <b>thread</b> <b>diameters.</b> Over the <b>thread</b> size range of interest, a 30 % increase in notch stress is equivalent to a factor of five (5 X) reduction in fatigue life. The resulting diameter dependent fatigue acceptance criterion is normalized to the aerospace rolled thread acceptance standards for a 1. 0 inch diameter, 0. 125 inch pitch, Unified National thread with a controlled Root radius (UNR). Testing was conducted at a stress of 50 % of the minimum specified material ultimate strength, 80 Ksi, and at a stress ratio (R) of 0. 10. Limited test data for fastener diameters of 1. 00 to 2. 25 inches are compared to the acceptance criterion. Sensitivity of fatigue life of threads to test nut geometry variables was also shown {{to be dependent on}} notch stress conditions. Bearing surface concavity of the compression nuts and thread flank contact mismatch conditions can significantly affect the fastener fatigue life. Without improved controls these conditions could potentially provide misleading acceptance data. Alternate test nut geometry features are described and implemented in the rolled thread stud specification, MIL-DTL- 24789 (SH), to mitigate the potential effects on fatigue acceptance data...|$|R
