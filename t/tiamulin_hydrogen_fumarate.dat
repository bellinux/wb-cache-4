40|$|Lawsonia intracellularis, the causative {{agent of}} porcine proliferative enteropathy (PPE), {{is a major}} cause of {{economic}} losses in the swine industry. Lawsonia intracellularis is a grain negative, microaerophilic, obligately intracellular pathogen. The disease associated with L. intracellularis usually results in poor weight gains and increased time to market. Newer techniques for detecting L. intracellularis infections are now available which allow ante-mortem testing including polymerase chain reaction (PCR) of the feces and an indirect fluorescent antibody test;This dissertation describes the development of a live attenuated strain of L. intracellularis after continuous passage within suspended tissue cultures. This attenuated strain was shown to be safe at high doses in dexamethasone treated pigs as well as safe after repeated backpassage in pigs, demonstrating a failure to revert back to virulence. Also described in this dissertation are studies used to evaluate the attenuated strain of L. intracellularis in pigs vaccinated at three weeks, then challenged with a pure culture of virulent L. intracellularis. Lastly, experiments using <b>tiamulin</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fumarate</b> (DenagardTM) are described for the control and prevention of PPE when administered in the feed or the drinking water as treatment post-infection. The use of biological, pharmaceutical, and updated managerial control measures will give swine producers more options for the control of PPE resulting in better performance and less cost to market...|$|E
40|$|Mycoplasma gallisepticum (M. gallisepticum) {{remains one}} of the most {{important}} diseases in poultry production. Controlling the impact of the disease is done by eradication of positive breeder flocks or by vaccination and medication. A widely used molecule in medication programs is tiamulin, a pleuromutilin antibiotic. Since recent data on the in vivo efficacy of this molecule are scarce, 2 challenge studies were conducted using a recently isolated M. gallisepticum strain belonging to the wildtype population with regard to its tiamulin and tetracycline minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). In the first challenge study, the dose rate of tiamulin was tested. For this, broilers were infected with M. gallisepticum and treated with 10 mg or 25 mg <b>tiamulin</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fumarate</b> (hf) /kg body weight (BW) for 5 successive days. In a second challenge study, the dose rate of tiamulin combined with chlortetracycline was tested. For this, broilers were infected with M. gallisepticum and treated with 6. 25 mg tiamulin hf/ 18. 75 mg chlortetracycline hydrochloride (hcl) / kg BW or 12. 5 mg tiamulin hf/ 37. 5 mg chlortetracycline hcl/kg BW for 5 successive days. Clinical scoring of respiratory signs, macroscopic scoring of respiratory tract lesions, M. gallisepticum isolation from the respiratory organs, weight gain, and mortality were the monitored efficacy parameters. The first study demonstrated that a 5 -day 10 mg/kg BW tiamulin hf treatment provided significant protection against the M. gallisepticum infection. However, since the 5 -day 25 mg/kg BW group was significantly better than the 10 mg/kg BW for reducing the post-treatment clinical signs and the M. gallisepticum numbers in the respiratory organs, the 25 mg/kg BW treatment is recommended for clinical M. gallisepticum infections. In the second study, the combined 12. 5 mg tiamulin hf/ 37. 5 mg chlortetracycline hcl/kg BW resulted in a significant reduction of the severity of clinical respiratory disease post treatment and a significant reduction of the M. gallisepticum numbers in the respiratory tract...|$|E

40|$|Fumaric acid is a {{dicarboxylic acid}} applied in food {{industry}} {{and in some}} polymers. Currently, its fermentative production from renewable resources is receiving much attention, and crystallization is used to recover it. To determine the window of operation for crystallization from multicomponent fermentation mixtures, the aqueous solubilities of fumaric acid and its sodium salts were investigated. For fumaric acid, sodium <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fumarate,</b> and sodium fumarate, solubilities and pH increased in this order because of increasing polarity and dissociation. A mathematical model was developed to predict crystal type and amount as function of temperature and pH. The effect of glucose (up to 3. 0 mmol·mol- 1) on the solubility can be neglected, but ethanol (1. 0 mmol·mol- 1) slightly increased the solubility of fumaric acid and significantly decreased the solubility of the sodium salts, because the aqueous solution becomes less polar upon ethanol addition but not upon glucose addition. © 2013 American Chemical Society...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} describes {{research into}} lithium-based inorganic-organic frameworks, {{which has led}} to an increased understanding of the structural diversity and properties of these materials. The crystal structures of 11 new forms of lithium tartrate, based on chiral, racemic and meso forms of the ligand, have been discovered, including eight anhydrous isomers of dilithium tartrate, Li 2 (C 4 H 4 O 6). An experimental and computational study of their formation behaviour and energetics has shown that both kinetic and thermodynamic conditions can be used to control their phase behaviour, and the main structural factors affecting their relative energies were found to be density and hydrogen bonding. Three crystal structures topologically identical to lithium succinate, Li 2 (C 4 H 4 O 4), have been discovered using substituted forms of the ligand: lithium L-malate, Li 2 (C 4 H 4 O 5), lithium methylsuccinate, Li 2 (C 5 H 6 O 4), and lithium tetrafluorosuccinate, Li 2 (C 4 F 4 O 4). The cell parameters and mechanical properties of these non-porous frameworks were found to depend on inter-ligand interactions and metal-ligand bond strength. The effects of different ligand substituents on the atomic structure of the binary mixed-ligand solid solution, Li 2 (succinate) 1 x(tetrafluorosuccinate) x, and the ternary system, Li 2 (succinate) x(L-malate) y(methylsuccinate) z [where (x + y + z) = 1], have also been investigated. Topotactic dehydration of the ligand in lithium L-malate results in the formation of Li 2 (L malate) 1 x(fumarate) x, suggesting a new route to mixed-ligand inorganic-organic frameworks. Investigation into frameworks based on other dicarboxylate ligands produced four structurally diverse lithium-based inorganic-organic frameworks: 2 -D frameworks lithium 2, 2 -dimethylsuccinate, Li 2 (C 6 H 8 O 4), and lithium hydrogen D,L-malate, LiH(C 4 H 4 O 5), and 3 D frameworks lithium fumarate, Li 2 (C 4 H 2 O 4), and its singly protonated analogue, lithium <b>hydrogen</b> <b>fumarate,</b> LiH(C 4 H 2 O 4). A survey of all known lithium dicarboxylates revealed that their structural trends are a function of the ligand geometry, metal:ligand ratio and degree of solvation. The electrochemical properties of nine lithium-based inorganic-organic frameworks were investigated by impedance spectroscopy and electrochemical cycling, revealing many areas to be improved {{in order for them to}} become viable materials for battery applications, such as ligand conjugation length, particle size and lithium mobility. Overall, this work has achieved a greater understanding of lithium-based inorganic-organic frameworks, revealing insight into polymorphism, phase behaviour, energetics, topological similarity, mechanical properties, ligand solid solutions, topotactic reaction, structure control and lithium battery properties. In total, 18 new crystal structures and three mixed-ligand solid solution systems are reported. The work provides a solid platform upon which new lithium-containing inorganic-organic materials may be designed and studied. EPSR...|$|R

The stoichiometry of the malonate-containing assembly is 1 : 2, [TMENH 2 (hydrogen malonate) 2], while that of the fumarate-containing assembly is 1 : 1 : 1 (TMENH 2, fumarate, fumaric acid). In each structure, protons from individual carboxylic acids have been transferred onto the nitrogens of N,N-tetramethyl- 1, 2 -diaminoethane (TMEN) to yield diammonium cations; the ammonium protons hydrogen bond to carboxylate oxygens of hydrogen malonate in one case or to fumarate anions in the other. The hydrogen malonate-containing structure has layers of aligned diprotonated TMEN separated by layers of hydrogen malonate anions. Successive hydrogen malonate ions are hydrogen bound in an 'alternate’ manner between adjacent protonated TMEN layers. Each [TMENH 2 (hydrogen malonate) 2] moiety describes an approximate 'Z’ configuration which are in turn stacked at an oblique angle; adjacent ‘columns of Zs’ are partially interlaced to form the overall array.

40|$|The {{cellular}} {{contents of}} the nickel-containing, membrane-bound hydrogenase isoenzymes 1 and 2 (hydrogenases 1 and 2) were analyzed by crossed immunoelectrophoresis. Their expression was differentially influenced by nutritional and genetic factors. Hydrogenase 2 content was enhanced after growth with either <b>hydrogen</b> and <b>fumarate</b> or glycerol and fumarate and correlated reasonably with cellular hydrogen uptake capacity. Hydrogenase 1 content was negligible under the above conditions but was enhanced by exogenous formate. Its expression was greatly reduced in a pfl mutant, which is unable to synthesise formate, but was restored to normal levels when the growth medium included formate. A mutation in the anaerobic regulatory gene, fnr, led to low overall hydrogenase activity and greatly reduced levels of both isoenzymes and abolished the formate enhancement of hydrogenase 1 content. Formate hydrogenlyase activity was similarly reduced in the fnr strain but, in contrast, was restored, as was overall hydrogenase activity, to normal levels by growth {{in the presence of}} formate. Low H 2 uptake activity was found for the fnr strain under all growth conditions examined. Hydrogenase 1 content, therefore, does not correlate with formate hydrogenlyase activity and its role is unclear. A third hydrogenase isoenzyme, immunologically distinct from hydrogenases 1 and 2, whose expression is enhanced by formate, is present and forms part of the formate hydrogenlyase. We suggest that the effect of the fnr gene product on formate hydrogenlyase expression is mediated via internal formate...|$|R

It will not dehalogenate monochlorinated, fluorinated, or iodinated phenols or chlorinated benzoates. Together with its physiological characteristics, its 16 S rRNA gene sequence places it in the genus Desulfovibrio. The average growth yield of strain TBP- 1 grown on a defined medium supplemented with lactate and 2, 4, 6 -bromophenol is 3. 71 mg of protein/mmol of phenol produced, and the yield was 1. 42 mg of protein/mmol of phenol produced when 4 -bromophenol was the electron acceptor.
