5|$|Apu is {{angered by}} her mother's success in math, as she herself {{continues}} {{to fail to}} understand it. Chanda challenges Apu to achieve grades higher <b>than</b> <b>hers</b> in math; if she is successful, Chanda promises {{to drop out of}} school. With Amar's help and constant studying, Apu manages to complete the challenge. Her mother is overjoyed, but is heartbroken when Apu informs her that she performed well in school with the sole purpose of ensuring her mother's absence at school. In her anger, Chanda breaks her promise and returns to school, performing even better than before, much to Apu's chagrin. After allotting more time to school, Chanda loses one of her four jobs and begins to work at a restaurant because Amar recommends the job.|$|E
5|$|In New York City, a {{group of}} {{teenagers}} audition to study at the High School of Performing Arts, where they are sorted into three different departments: Drama, Music and Dance. Accepted in the Drama department are Montgomery MacNeil, a closeted homosexual, Doris Finsecker, a shy Jewish girl, and Ralph Garci, who succeeds after failed auditions for Music and Dance. In the Music department, Bruno Martelli is an aspiring keyboardist whose electronic equipment horrifies Mr. Shorofsky, a conservative music teacher. Lisa Monroe is accepted in the Dance department, despite having {{no interest in the}} subject. Coco Hernandez is accepted in all three departments because of her all-around talent. Leroy Johnson goes to the school, performing as part of a dance routine for an auditioning friend, but the dance teachers are more impressed by his talents <b>than</b> <b>hers.</b>|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to her European language skills, Alexandra speaks a bit of Cantonese. At {{a press conference in}} 1995, when asked whether or not she is able to communicate with Prince Henrik in Chinese, she stated that she believes that his Chinese is better <b>than</b> <b>hers.</b> She then clarified that Henrik speaks Mandarin Chinese while she speaks a little bit of Cantonese, which is the dominant language in Hong Kong.|$|E
25|$|The {{ambivalent}} {{attitude to}} Messalina {{can be seen}} in the late mediaeval French prose work in the J. Paul Getty Museum illustrated by the Master of Boucicaut, Tiberius, Messalina, and Caligula reproach one another in the midst of flames. It recounts a dialogue that takes place in hell between the three characters from the same imperial line. Messalina wins the debate by demonstrating that their sins were far worse <b>than</b> <b>hers</b> and suggests that they repent of their own wickedness before reproaching her as they had done.|$|E
25|$|It is {{the first}} Oz book where the {{majority}} of the action takes place outside of the Land of Oz. Only the final two chapters take place in Oz itself. This reflects a subtle change in theme: in the first book, Oz is the dangerous land through which Dorothy must win her way back to Kansas; in the third, Oz is the end and aim of the book. Dorothy's desire to return home is not as desperate as in the first book, and it is her uncle's need for her rather <b>than</b> <b>hers</b> for him that makes her return.|$|E

500|$|... "The Secret War of Lisa Simpson" [...] is the twenty-fifth {{and final}} episode of The Simpsons eighth season. It first aired on the Fox {{network in the}} United States on May 18, 1997. Bart gets sent to a {{military}} academy as punishment for bad behavior. While visiting the academy, Lisa sees that the school is far more challenging <b>than</b> <b>hers</b> and she decides {{that she wants to}} attend as well. It was directed by Mike B. Anderson, written by Richard Appel and featured Willem Dafoe in a guest spot as the school's commandant.|$|E
500|$|Queen Mary's {{attempts}} {{to undo the}} reforming work of her brother's reign faced major obstacles. Despite her belief in the papal supremacy, she ruled constitutionally as the Supreme Head of the English Church, a contradiction under which she bridled. She found herself entirely unable to restore the vast number of ecclesiastical properties handed over or sold to private landowners. Although she burned a number of leading Protestant churchmen, many reformers either went into exile or remained subversively active in England during her reign, producing a torrent of reforming propaganda that {{she was unable to}} stem. Nevertheless, Protestantism was not yet [...] "printed in the stomachs" [...] of the English people, and had Mary lived longer, her Catholic reconstruction might have succeeded, leaving Edward's reign, rather <b>than</b> <b>hers,</b> as a historical aberration.|$|E
500|$|Police {{were unable}} to recover any {{fingerprints}} from the well-oiled grip of the pistol, and a paraffin test for gunshot residue was not performed on Danna or Sharon Kinne. Multiple people, including family and neighbors, told police that James had often allowed Danna to play with his guns, and in a test by investigating officers, Danna proved able {{to pull the trigger}} on a gun matching the one that had killed her father. With no evidence to the contrary, investigators ruled the case an accidental homicide. The pistol that killed James Kinne was taken into police custody and never returned to the widow, despite her efforts to reclaim it; she later had a male friend secretly buy her a [...]22 caliber automatic pistol. When the friend told her that he had registered the gun in her name, she requested that he re-register it under a name other <b>than</b> <b>hers.</b>|$|E

500|$|While commenting {{in regards}} to the lyrical content of the song on Australian talk show, Rove, Gaga said that she was unrepentant about her [...] "disco stick" [...] metaphor, though it led to a banning of the music video on Network Ten in Australia. She added that the metaphor was not meant to be subtle and was clear what the lyrics {{constituted}} off. [...] "If anything, I happen to think people are frivolously hard on me", Gaga generalized. She went on to relegate [...] "lot of youth-oriented pop music" [...] as much racier <b>than</b> <b>hers</b> with their sexually provocative lyrics, but Gaga felt that the whole context of her visuals alongside the music was what made people react. [...] "It's the music in relation to the visual, in relation to the way I move and the way I articulate the lyrics. But if I wanted to make music to make people sing 'la di da' that would be very boring," [...] she concluded.|$|E
500|$|The {{contract}} between Woods and Rand {{allowed him to}} hire collaborators if he thought it necessary, paying them a limited portion of the author's royalties. He first hired John Hayden to direct, paying him one percentage point from Rand's 10-percent royalty. Although Hayden was a successful Broadway director, Rand disliked him and later called him [...] "a very ratty Broadway hanger-on". As auditions for the play began in Philadelphia, Woods demanded further script changes and was frustrated by Rand's refusal to make some of them. He engaged Louis Weitzenkorn, {{the author of the}} previous hit Five Star Final, to act as a script doctor. Rand's relationship with Weitzenkorn was worse <b>than</b> <b>hers</b> with Woods or Hayden; she and Weitzenkorn argued over political differences as well as his ideas for the play. Woods gave Weitzenkorn another percentage point from Rand's royalties without informing her. Rand filed a claim against Woods with the American Arbitration Association; she objected to Weitzenkorn receiving any portion of her royalties, and told the arbitration panel Weitzenkorn had added only a single line to the play, which was cut after the auditions. Upon hearing this testimony, one of the arbitrators responded incredulously, [...] "That was [...] he did?" [...] In two hearings, the panel ruled that Weitzenkorn should receive his agreed-upon one percent, but that Woods could not deduct the payment from Rand's royalties because she had not been notified in advance. Despite the disputes between Rand and Woods, the play opened at Shubert's Ambassador Theatre on September 16, 1935, where it ran successfully for seven months. It closed on April 4, 1936, after 283 performances.|$|E
2500|$|The third Horten H.IIL was test {{flown in}} November 1938 by Hanna Reitsch, who {{reported}} that whilst comfort was [...] "not exceptional", the [...] "view is bad" [...] (even with the new canopy), entry and exit were [...] "only possible for athletes" [...] and that the undercarriage retraction lever could only be operated by pilots with longer arms <b>than</b> <b>hers.</b> It achieved a soaring flight of [...] in 1938.|$|E
60|$|When {{she came}} {{to that part of}} the letter in which her family were {{mentioned}} in terms of such mortifying, yet merited reproach, her sense of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly for denial, and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded as having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind <b>than</b> on <b>hers.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Then it {{is surely}} thine intent to wed her." [...] No voice {{could have been more}} {{innocent}} and guileless <b>than</b> was <b>hers</b> now. [...] "If so," [...] she went on, [...] "it were best done quickly, for marriage is the only barrier Asad will not overthrow. He is devout, and out of his deep reverence for the Prophet's law he would be sure to respect such a bond as that. But be very sure that he will respect nothing short of it." ...|$|R
60|$|Till {{within the}} last year Millicent had been little more than a child; she had looked up to Mark as she might have done to a big brother, as {{something}} most admirable, as one whose dictum was law. During the last year there had been some slight change, but more, perhaps, on Mark's part <b>than</b> on <b>hers.</b> He had consulted her wishes more, had asked instead of ordered, and had begun to treat her as if conscious that she was fast growing up into womanhood.|$|R
2500|$|Abang is a {{title that}} is {{particularly}} found in Sarawak. [...] Its use {{is rooted in the}} appointments of Datuk Patinggi, Datuk Temenggung, Datuk Bandar and Datuk Imam, [...] centuries before the British colonisation. [...] The children of these state dignitaries carry the title Abang (male) and Dayang (female). [...] When an Abang marries a Dayang or a commoner, the issue will get to keep the title. [...] The issue of a Dayang does not carry a title if he or she has a non-Abang father. However, if a Dayang marries a male aristocrat bearing a different title <b>than</b> <b>hers,</b> her issue will be named according to the husband's given title.|$|E
2500|$|Lorde's {{relationship}} with her parents was difficult from a young age. She spent very little time with her father and mother, who were both busy maintaining their real estate business in the tumultuous economy after the Great Depression. When she did see them, they were often cold or emotionally distant. In particular, Lorde's {{relationship with}} her mother, who was deeply suspicious of people with darker skin <b>than</b> <b>hers</b> (which Lorde's was) and the outside world in general, was characterized by [...] "tough love" [...] and strict adherence to family rules. Lorde's difficult {{relationship with her}} mother figured prominently in her later poems, such as Coals [...] "Story Books on a Kitchen Table." ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} 1811, King George III {{had become}} {{permanently}} insane, and the Prince of Wales was appointed as Regent. He restricted Caroline's access to Princess Charlotte further, and Caroline became more socially isolated as members of high society chose to patronise George's extravagant parties rather <b>than</b> <b>hers.</b> She moved her London residence to Connaught House in Bayswater. Caroline needed a powerful ally to help her oppose George's increasing ability to prevent her from seeing her daughter. In league with Henry Brougham, an ambitious Whig politician who favoured reform, she began a propaganda campaign against George. George countered by leaking Lady Douglas's testimony from the [...] "Delicate Investigation", which Brougham repudiated by leaking the testimonies of the servants and Mrs Austin. Charlotte favoured her mother's point of view, as {{did most of the}} public. Jane Austen wrote of Caroline: [...] "Poor woman, I shall support her as long as I can, because she is a Woman and because I hate her Husband." ...|$|E
6000|$|John may {{of course}} be excused for feeling that his {{flattering}} little penitent {{was more to}} him than ever; and as to Lillie, she gave a sigh of relief. That was over, [...] "anyway;" [...] and she had him not only safe, but more completely <b>hers</b> <b>than</b> before.|$|R
40|$|Surrogacy is {{the making}} of an {{arrangement}} whereby a woman agrees to carry and {{give birth to a}} child (whether genetically related to her or not) on the understanding that when the child is born she will give up the child to the custody of others, so that it can become part of their family rather <b>than</b> of <b>hers.</b> This article will describe the legal response to such arrangements, some of the ethical difficulties that they can give rise to, and will attempt to suggest possible solutions to these difficulties...|$|R
60|$|Like rough iron {{his hard}} hand crushed Jane's. In it {{she felt the}} {{difference}} she saw in him. Wild, rugged, unshorn--yet how splendid! He had gone away a boy--he had returned a man. He appeared taller, wider of shoulder, deeper-chested, more powerfully built. But was that only her fancy--he {{had always been a}} young giant--was the change one of spirit? He might have been absent for years, proven by fire and steel, grown like Lassiter, strong and cool and sure. His eyes--were they keener, more flashing <b>than</b> before?--met <b>hers</b> with clear, frank, warm regard, in which perplexity was not, nor discontent, nor pain.|$|R
2500|$|In 1953, Brooks {{published}} {{her first}} and only narrative book, a novella titled Maud Martha, which {{in a series of}} 34 vignettes follows the life of a black woman named Maud Martha in detail, as she moves about life from childhood to adulthood. It tells the story of [...] "a woman with doubts about herself and where and how she fits into the world. Maud's concern is not so much that she is inferior but that she is perceived as being ugly," [...] states author Harry B. Shaw in his book, Gwendolyn Brooks. Maud suffers prejudice and discrimination not only from white individuals but also from black individuals who have lighter skin tones <b>than</b> <b>hers,</b> something that is direct reference to Brooks' personal experience. Eventually, Maud stands up for herself by turning her back on a patronizing and racist store clerk. [...] "The book is ... about the triumph of the lowly," [...] Shaw comments.|$|E
2500|$|From 1958 to 1960, Tynan {{became known}} in the United States by {{contributing}} [...] "some superb reviews" [...] to The New Yorker. His marriage had become increasingly difficult {{in spite of his}} success (and Dundy's: she had published her first novel in 1958). Both had extramarital affairs (though his were much more blatant <b>than</b> <b>hers)</b> and he had developed a dependence on alcohol. His sexual tastes had always favoured sadomasochism, which strained the marriage as well. Dundy wrote [...] "To cane a woman on her bare buttocks, to hurt and humiliate her, was what gave him his greatest sexual satisfaction." [...] Johnson wrote that [...] "women seem to have objected less to his sadism, which took only a mild form, than to his vanity and authoritarianism. [...] He treated women as possessions. [...] Tynan, while reserving the unqualified right to be unfaithful himself, expected loyalty from his spouse." [...] On one occasion, he returned from a meeting with his mistress to find a naked man in the kitchen with his wife. He threw the man's clothes down an elevator shaft.|$|E
2500|$|Rasputin {{had persuaded}} Maria to marry Boris Soloviev, the charismatic son of Nikolai Soloviev, the Treasurer of the Holy Synod {{and one of}} her father's admirers. Boris Soloviev, a {{graduate}} of a school of mysticism, quickly emerged as Rasputin's successor after the murder. Boris, who had studied Madame Blavatsky's theosophy, and hypnotism, attended meetings at which Rasputin's followers attempted to communicate with the dead through prayer meetings and séances. Maria also attended the meetings, but later wrote in her diary that she could not understand why her father kept telling her to [...] "love Boris" [...] when the group spoke to him at the séances. She said she did not like Boris at all. Boris was no more enthusiastic about Maria. In his own diary, he wrote that his wife was not even useful for sexual relations, because there were so many women who had bodies he found more attractive <b>than</b> <b>hers.</b> In September 1917 Boris received jewels from the Tsarina to help arrange for their escape, but according to Radzinsky, he kept the funds for himself. Nonetheless, she married Boris on October 5, 1917 in the chapel of the Tauride Palace. After the fall of the Russian Provisional Government the situation got worse. In spring 1918 the couple fled to her mother. They lived [...] in Pokrovskoye Tyumen and Tobolsk.|$|E
