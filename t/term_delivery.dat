As the head passes through the pelvis, the soft tissues are stretched and compressed. The risk of severe tear is greatly increased if the fetal head is oriented occiput posterior (face forward), if the mother has not given birth before or if the fetus is large.|$|E

50|$|The current {{surgical}} procedure to treat this malformation, termed a hysteroscopic correction or metroplasty, is undertaken by performing a lateral incision of the uterine walls, and can return the organ {{to a normal}} morphology, while improving the patient's former reproductive performance. It is considered a low-risk procedure, and can also improve <b>term</b> <b>delivery</b> rate by up to 10-fold, {{as long as the}} endometrium is considered to be in good condition. However, risks after the procedure include placenta accreta, Asherman's syndrome and severe haemorrhage.|$|E
5000|$|In {{some very}} rare cases, a GTD can coexist {{with a normal}} fetus. This is called a [...] "twin pregnancy". These cases should be managed only by {{experienced}} clinics, after extensive consultation with the patient. Because successful <b>term</b> <b>delivery</b> might be possible, the pregnancy {{should be allowed to}} proceed if the mother wishes, following appropriate counselling. The probability of achieving a healthy baby is approximately 40%, but there is a risk of complications, e.g. pulmonary embolism and pre-eclampsia. Compared with women who simply had a GTD in the past, there is no increased risk of developing persistent GTD after such a twin pregnancy.|$|E
5000|$|For {{the general}} scholar, the <b>term</b> <b>delivery</b> means {{the way in}} which a form of {{information}} is conveyed to a particular audience or group of people. These ideas of delivery could mean hearing information spoken at a conference or reading the newspaper. The forms can range from podcasts to videos, pictures to text, or even songs and newspapers. Delivery is the modem in which information is given in order for the topic to be best understood and related to. The term [...] "delivery" [...] is often aligned with the term [...] "performance". The Forest of Rhetoric states that delivery is not only the fifth canon of rhetoric, {{but it is also a}} translation of the word [...] "hypokrisis", or [...] "acting". This Greek word was translated into delivery in the standpoint of spoken or recited information rather than newspapers or essays. Performance of plays, speeches, skits, etc. turns into the delivery of information in the piece being performed or spoken. This is the same as a piece of literature or rhetoric delivering its information through word choice, layout, and structure.|$|E

5000|$|The Royal Thai Army has 25 T-84 Oplot-T in service. In March 2011, the Royal Thai Army {{placed an}} order for 49 T-84s to replace its fleet of aging M41A3 Walker Bulldog light tanks. Up to 200 tanks may {{eventually}} be acquired. However, the Royal Thai Army had yet to make an official announcement. [...] The government had just approved 7.155 billion baht to purchase the first 49 Oplot tanks to be assigned to several units: the 2nd cavalry battalion (Royal Guard at Fort Chakrabongse, Prachinburi), the 4th cavalry battalion (Royal Guard at Kiakkai, Bangkok), the 8th cavalry battalion (Fort Suranari, Nakhon Ratchasima), and the 9th cavalry battalion (Fort Ekathotsarot, Phitsanuloke). [...] The first T-84 Oplot will be delivered to be tested at Cavalry Center at Fort Adisorn, Saraburi in mid-2013 and during the official procurement. The factory in Ukraine had offered the extra 5 T-84 Oplot {{in addition to the}} first 49 Oplot tanks. 10 tanks were delivered by beginning of 2016. 5 tanks were delivered in november 2016. Thus, the number of delivered tanks has reached 15 units. However in April 2017 the Bangkok Post revealed that only 10 tanks had been delivered and that the contract had been cancelled as Ukraine could not complete the order. Bangkok Post article from 9 May 2017 stated that the army received 20 Oplot tanks and cited Gen Chalermchai saying the army is expected to receive another five soon and insisting that a full battalion of the Ukrainian tanks would be procured by the army. But following the delayed deliveries from this tank, the Royal Thai Army has declined the sale and acquired the Chinese VT-4 main battle tank instead of the Ukrainian tank, due to the long <b>term</b> <b>delivery</b> schedule.|$|E
40|$|Premature {{cervical}} remodeling/ripening {{is believed}} to contribute to preterm delivery (PTD), {{the leading cause of}} perinatal morbidity and mortality. Despite considerable research, the causes of term and PTD remain unclear, and there is no effective treatment for PTD. We previously demonstrated that complement activation plays a causative role in cervical remodeling that leads to PTD in mice. Here we found that complement activation is not required for the physiological process that leads to <b>term</b> <b>delivery</b> in mice. Neither increased C 3 cervical deposition nor increased C 3 a and C 5 a serum levels were observed at term. In addition, macrophages infiltration was found in PTD in contrast to <b>term</b> <b>delivery</b> were no leukocytes were found. Despite the different role of complement and different cellular effector cells, PTD and <b>term</b> <b>delivery</b> share a common dowsntream pathway characterized by increased metalloproteinases (MMPs) release and increased collagen degradation. However, different sources of MMPs were identified. Macrophages are the source of MMPs in PTD while cervical fibroblasts and columnar epithelial cells synthesize MMPs at <b>term</b> <b>delivery.</b> A dramatic diminution in serum progesterone levels precedes parturition at term but not in PTD, suggesting that progesterone withdrawal initiates cervical remodeling at term. On the other hand, MMPs release in PTD is triggered by C 5 a. In conclusion, preterm and term cervical remodeling occur through the same mechanism but they are initiated by different mediators and effector cells. That complement activation is required for PTD but not for the physiological process that leads to <b>term</b> <b>delivery,</b> suggests that complement is a potential specific biomarker and selective target to prevent PTD and thus avert neonatal mortality and morbidity...|$|E

In this investigation, a cell population was isolated which was derived from the endothelium/subendothelium layers of 20 umbilical cord veins obtained from <b>term</b> <b>deliveries</b> using a solution of 0. 1 % collagenase type IV. Results suggest that these cells possess morphological, immunophenotypical and cell differentiation capacities similar to the bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs). The isolated cell population has fibroblastoid morphology which upon proper stimulation gives rise to adipocytes, osteocytes and chondrocytes in culture. Immunophenotypically, this cell population is positive for CD 54, CD 29, CD 73, CD 49 e, CD 166, CD 105, CD 13, and CD 44 markers and alpha-smooth muscle actin and negative for CD 31, CD 45, CD 49 d, and CD 34 markers, von Willebrand factor (vWF) and smooth muscle myosin (MySM).
