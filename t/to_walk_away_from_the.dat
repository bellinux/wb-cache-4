She refused paramedics' attempts to put her on a stretcher, returned to her vehicle, and continued to refuse to cooperate. She then attempted <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> scene, but was prevented from doing so by a male police officer, whom she then slapped. She was handcuffed and charged with careless driving, refusing a breathalyser test, and two counts of assault on a police officer. She was released on HK$5,000 bail.|$|E
5|$|After {{the deal}} was announced, NBA Commissioner David Stern stated that he was opposed to a relocation, as no NBA {{franchise}} had moved since 1985, when the Kansas City Kings relocated to Sacramento, California. He stated that his goal was that the Grizzlies remain in Vancouver and succeed there. The NBA Board of Governors' Finance Committee also made negative statements, as the purchase agreement was structured with incentives to move the team. The deal was then renegotiated before the board could vote on the issue. On 21 January 2001, Laurie {{announced that he had}} paid McCaw an undisclosed amount <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> deal.|$|E
5|$|They are {{alerted to}} {{eyewitness}} accounts {{of a woman}} who, after jumping with another man from a high roof and crashing onto a taxi parked below, simply walked away. As the Fringe team investigates, they are approached by another FBI agent, Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel), who identifies the woman as Dana Gray (Paula Malcomson). Dana, who had been struck by lightning twice, was killed eighteen months earlier along with her family during a robbery of their home, but she apparently was able <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> morgue. Since then, she has appeared to commit suicide with several others, but always managing to walk away. Walter (John Noble) and Bell, in studying Dana's blood samples, find that her body may have been altered by several past lightning strikes, making her incapable of dying.|$|E

5|$|On April 23, 2003, in {{the lead}} up to the 2003 Indy 500, Andretti took to the track {{for the first time}} in ten years in a major open wheel car at the age of 63. He participated in a test session for son Michael's AGR IndyCar team. One of the team's regular drivers, Tony Kanaan, {{suffered}} a radial fracture of his arm a week earlier in an April 15 crash at Motegi. If Kanaan was not cleared to drive in enough time, tentative plans were being prepared for Andretti to qualify the car for him. He would turn the car over to Kanaan on race day, though no plans had been made for Andretti to actually drive in the race. During the test, Andretti ran at competitive speeds, but running over debris saw his car becoming airborne and the attempt ended with a spectacular crash. Andretti was able <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> wreck with just a minor cut on his chin. This was Andretti's last significant on-track activity at Indianapolis.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{match was}} the main event from the SmackDown brand, a {{standard}} match for the WWE Championship, in which Kurt Angle defended the title against Brock Lesnar. At {{the beginning of the}} match, Lesnar tried <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ring, but Angle brought him back. There, Angle performed many offensive maneuvers, including DDT and Angle Slam. He then applied an ankle lock on Lesnar. During this tussle, Lesnar countered the hold but knocked down the referee. Angle applied a guillotine choke on Lesnar, which brought Lesnar down onto his knees and allowed Angle to perform another ankle lock. Mr. McMahon, who had accompanied Lesnar to the ring, came into the ring and hit Angle's back with a steel chair to break the submission hold. Because the referee was incapacitated, Lesnar was not disqualified for the interference. Afterwards, Lesnar twice attempted to lift Angle onto his F-5. During the second attempt, however, Angle countered the throw into another ankle lock, which forced Lesnar to tap out. As a result, Angle retained the WWE Championship.|$|E

One apparent sticking point in the negotiations was the amount his staff and crew were {{to be paid for}} leaving the program. Reports also said that the contract could prohibit O'Brien from badmouthing NBC in any way, and that he may be able to return to television as early as September 2010.|$|E

The proportion of a deposit that is economically recoverable is dependent on the enrichment factor of the ore in the area.|$|E
25|$|While the Tasmanian Government {{supported}} the project, believing the Direct Factory Outlet would drive retail trade growth, the Hobart City Council {{and a large}} amount of retail shop owners in the Hobart Central Business District expressed fears of losing business. Concern was also expressed about the big box being built on commonwealth land and therefore escaping the state planning laws. In 2008, plans for the project were submitted to the Federal Government for assessment. Federal Transport Minister Warren Truss gave approval on condition the outlet centre was cut by almost half to , prompting Austexx <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> proposal. In February 2008, Austexx' chief executive Geoff Porz confirmed the Direct Factory Outlet and Homemaker Hub project was back on, however Austexx went into receivership in 2010, and as of 2014 the site remains undeveloped.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} of this exercise {{because it is}} such a common and necessary command for a dog. Generally the handler will order the dog to sit and stay and then the judge will order the handler <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> dog. Depending on the level of the competition the judge will order the handler to: walk around the ring, walk {{to the other side of}} the ring and wait for an order to return, or walk out of sight of the dog and wait for an order to return. In the later two cases the length of time before the judge orders the handler to return, and the time the dog must remain sitting, increases depending on the class the team is competing in. This exercise can also be performed in a group where as many as 10 dogs may perform the exercise simultaneously. In any case should a dog break the sit by lying down or getting up to walk around the team will usually fail the exercise and receive a non qualifying score for the class.|$|E

25|$|Starting in August 1896, Rhodes {{personally}} {{played a}} key role in ending the Matabele insurgency. With one of the widows of Mzilikazi (Lobengula's father) acting as a go-between, the Company and the rebel izinDuna arranged an indaba for 21 August: the izinDuna agreed to meet Rhodes and three companions in the Matopos Hills. At this meeting, the insurgents vehemently protested against their prior treatment under Company rule, prompting Rhodes <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> other whites and to sit among the Matabele instead, apparently intending to symbolically demonstrate empathy and a spirit of reconciliation. He told the Matabele that he was on their side, and that he would personally ensure the non-recurrence of any abuses. The izinDuna would be fully restored to the status they had held under Lobengula, he said, and there would be no retribution against those who had taken part in the Chimurenga. After four hours, it was agreed to continue the talks. Bitterness endured among some of the rebels, but three further indabas progressed well, and the Matabele rising ended amicably in October 1896.|$|E
25|$|NBC's {{requests}} {{became more}} unreasonable and the O'Brien camp refused them, {{such as the}} right to pull any of his final shows if the network objected to the content (i.e., a joke about the conflict/NBC). Jeffrey Immelt, GE chairman, questioned why they were paying so much for a performer destined to run to another network. Negotiations continued on into O'Brien's final week; he could not confirm on-air it was indeed his final week of shows, which produced difficulty in booking the guests he desired for his final show. On January 19, multiple media outlets reported that O'Brien and NBC were close to signing a deal between US$30 and US$40 million for the host <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> network. Following his Wednesday, January 20 edition, O'Brien remained at the studio until {{the early hours of the}} morning, alongside Ross and the legal counsel, trying to finalize the settlement. O'Brien wandered off, playing his guitar alone and stepping out on the deserted Universal lot at midnight, attempting to make sense of the situation. Meanwhile, Ron Meyer passingly suggested to Zucker and Gaspin, based off the public outcry, that they should stick with O'Brien; the two executives agreed to send him on his way. O'Brien signed the agreement that night and the following day the terms were made public.|$|E
25|$|For {{a number}} of days, Jaynes is forced to labor for his master Augustus by {{cleaning}} his ice cave and kneading krakt (the Snow Honkies' word for whale blubber). Augustus eventually gestures to Jaynes that he wants Little Debbie cakes by showing him an empty wrapper, which leads {{them back to the}} campsite and Garth. Jaynes and Garth then plot an escape plan for the enslaved crew as Augustus eats out of a bag of sugar and eventually falls ill and vomits. Jaynes and Garth drag the Snow Honkie back to the mouth of the ice caves, where they secretly plan to meet with the others. After returning, Augustus (who is translated by Pym) drunkenly announces to Jaynes that he has been sold to Sausage Nose, an abusive master who owns both Jeffree and Carlton. Jaynes realizes that he must escape with the crew soon or they will be enslaved forever. He attempts to convince Booker Jaynes to escape with him and Garth, but fails to persuade him as Booker is in an intimate relationship with his mistress, Hunka. Jaynes manages to escape by himself to the mouth of the cave, but sees that both snowmobiles have been destroyed by Pym. Garth and Jaynes tie Pym up and begin <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ice caves with a ration of seasoned krakt from Booker as their own source of food. Garth unfortunately eats it all and leaves everyone to starve.|$|E

25|$|For {{conspicuous}} gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and {{beyond the call of duty}} as Commanding Officer of Company F, Second Battalion, Seventh Marines, First Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea from November 28, to December 2, 1950. Assigned to defend a three-mile mountain pass along the division's main supply line and commanding the only route of approach in the march from Yudam-Ni to Hagaru-ri, Captain Barber took position with his battle weary troops and, before nightfall, had dug in and set up a defense along the frozen snow-covered hillside. When a force of estimated regimental strength savagely attacked during the night, inflicting heavy casualties and finally surrounding his position following a bitterly fought seven-hour conflict, Captain Barber, after repulsing the enemy, gave assurance that he could hold if supplied by air drops and requested permission to stand fast when orders were received by radio to fight his way back to a relieving force after two reinforcing units had been driven back under fierce resistance in their attempts to reach the isolated troops. Aware that leaving the position would sever contact with the 8,000 Marines trapped at Yudam-ni and jeopardize their chances of joining the 3,000 more awaiting their arrival in Hagaru-ri for the continued drive to the sea, he chose to risk loss of his command rather than sacrifice more men if the enemy seized control and forced a renewed battle to regain the position, or abandon his many wounded who were unable to walk. Although severely wounded in the leg the early morning of the 29th, Captain Barber continued to maintain personal control, often moving up and down the lines on a stretcher to direct the defense and consistently encouraging and inspiring his men to supreme efforts despite the staggering opposition. Waging desperate battle throughout five days and six nights of repeated onslaughts launched by the fanatical aggressors, he and his heroic command accounted for approximately 1,000 enemy dead in this epic stand in bitter sub-zero weather, and when the company was relieved, only 82 of his original 220 men were able <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> position so valiantly defended against insuperable odds. His profound faith and courage, great personal valor and unwavering fortitude were decisive factors in the successful withdrawal of the division from the deathtrap in the Chosin Reservoir sector and reflect the highest credit upon Captain Barber, his intrepid officers and men and the United States Naval Service.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} we explore {{a variant of}} a classic explore/exploit dilemma based on {{a recent study by}} Shin and Ariely (2004). We {{presented}} participants with a scenario in which they were forced to explore among 9 different options of unknown value; for some, options left unexplored long enough disappeared. Contrary to expectations, the mere presence of additional options did not substantially increase people’s ability <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> them. However, when options differed in value, people were able to locate the more valuable options and became much more willing <b>to</b> <b>walk</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> at least a few. Finally, our analysis of individual differences revealed that while people differ greatly in the strategies they approach the task with, almost every participant showed an “explore to exploit” shift over time. 6 page(s...|$|R
