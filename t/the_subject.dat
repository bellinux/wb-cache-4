The researchers, Festinger and Carlsmith, proposed that <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> experienced dissonance, between the conflicting cognitions: [...] "I told someone that the task was interesting." [...] and [...] "I actually found it boring." [...] Moreover, <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> paid one-dollar were induced to comply; compelled to internalize the [...] "interesting task" [...] mental attitude, because they had no other justification. <b>The</b> <b>subjects</b> paid twenty dollars were induced to comply by way of an obvious, external justification for internalizing the [...] "interesting task" [...] mental attitude, thus, they experienced a lesser degree of cognitive dissonance.|$|R

Hilgard then asked <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> to lift their index finger if they felt pain and 70% of <b>the</b> <b>subjects</b> lifted their index finger.
