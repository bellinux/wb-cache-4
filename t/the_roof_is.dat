40|$|Distribution of {{stresses}} about rectangular openings excavated in {{bedded rock}} was investigated {{by means of}} photoelastic experiments using 37 kinds of models made of gelatine jelly. By those model experiments, influence of ratio of the breadth to {{the height of the}} opening, thickness and elastic modulus of immediate roof and high roof, thickness of packs in the goaf, and fissures contained in <b>the</b> immediate <b>roof</b> or <b>the</b> high <b>roof</b> on <b>the</b> distribution of stresses around the opening was studied. Influence of the thickness of immediate roof, height of caved rocks in the goaf or rigidity of face props in long wall working face were investigated as well. As the results of those experiments, following conclusions were obtained : 1. The tensile stresses of <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> in <b>the</b> bedded rock are larger than these stresses which arise in the non-bedded rock, and the tensile stresses on <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>are</b> larger than <b>the</b> tensile stresses on the floor. 2. When <b>the</b> immediate <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> thick, <b>the</b> tensile stresses on <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> and <b>the</b> compressive stresses on the side walls are considerably smaller than those stresses which arise when <b>the</b> immediate <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> thin. 3. When <b>the</b> high <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> thick, <b>the</b> tensile stresses on <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>are</b> still more small, and the compressive stresses on the side walls are a little larger than these stresses which arise when <b>the</b> high <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> thin. 4. When the modulus of elasticity of <b>the</b> immediate <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> large, <b>the</b> tensile stresses on <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>are</b> larger and <b>the</b> compressive stresses on the side walls are smaller than these stresses which arise when the modulus of elastisity of <b>the</b> immediate <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> large. 5. <b>The</b> compressive stresses on the face decrease as the thickness of the packs in the goaf increases. However, the magnitudes of tensile stresses on <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> undergo only little change. 6. When <b>the</b> immediate <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> fissured, tensile stresses on <b>the</b> <b>roof</b> <b>are</b> almost equal to zero. 7. When <b>the</b> high <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> fissured, <b>the</b> tensile stresses are larger as compared with the case in which <b>the</b> high <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> not fissured. 8. The compressive stresses on the long wall face decrease as the height of caved rocks in the goaf increases. 9. The compressive stresses on the face decrease as the rigidity of face props increases...|$|R

5|$|The two tiered mosque has a {{rectangular}} plan. The Ottoman prayer hall faces towards the south. It has a flat paved roof topped with 27 sliding domes on square bases. Holes pierced {{into the base}} of each dome illuminate the interior. <b>The</b> <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> also used for prayer during peak times, when the domes slide out on metal tracks to shade areas of the roof, creating light wells for the prayer hall. At these times, {{the courtyard of the}} Ottoman mosque is also shaded with umbrellas affixed to freestanding columns. <b>The</b> <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> accessed by stairs and escalators. The paved area around the mosque is also used for prayer, equipped with umbrella tents. Sliding Domes and retractable umbrella-like canopies are designed by the German architect Mahmoud Bodo Rasch and his firm SL Rasch GmbH and Buro Happold.|$|E
5|$|Another {{structure}} at {{the complex}} {{is a small}} signal house, which was constructed as a flag house for the timber flagstaff, both constructed with the original structures in 1903. The flag house was constructed to match the lighthouse, from precast concrete blocks, rendered walls, with the same plinth and deep ashlar coursing. <b>The</b> <b>roof</b> <b>is</b> made of concrete in a shallow hipped form, {{in contrast to the}} concrete dome proposed in the original drawings. The flag locker now houses maritime signal flags. The timber flagstaff was removed at an unknown date, and what remains of it are a concrete and steel base, a concrete apron, and four concrete and iron anchor points.|$|E
