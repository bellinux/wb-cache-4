5|$|The {{congregation}} {{obtained a}} land patent from the London Virginia Company in June 1619. They had declined {{the opportunity to}} settle south of Cape Cod in New Netherland because of their desire to avoid the Dutch influence. This land patent allowed them <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>at</b> {{the mouth of the}} Hudson River. They sought to finance their venture through the Merchant Adventurers, a group of businessmen who principally viewed the colony as a means of making a profit. Upon arriving in America, the Pilgrims began working to repay their debts.|$|E
5|$|In July 1945, Lawton handed in a {{transfer}} request at Everton {{as he wanted}} a move to a Southern club so as {{to see more of}} his increasingly estranged wife. In November 1945, he was sold to Chelsea for a fee of £14,000. Chelsea continued to play regional wartime fixtures as national league football had not resumed for the 1945–46 season, and Lawton also continued his uncapped appearances for the England national team. In the summer of 1946, following his demobilisation, he coached for the FA in a summer camp in Switzerland. He scored a club record 26 goals in 34 league games in the 1946–47 season. However he struggled <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>at</b> Stamford Bridge and came into conflict with manager Billy Birrell after refusing to go on a pre-season tour of Sweden in 1947, which resulted in him requesting {{a transfer}}. He favoured a move to Arsenal, but this was ruled out by the Chelsea hierarchy. Lawton turned down an approach by Sunderland manager Bill Murray as he held out hope that Chelsea would relent and allow him a move to Arsenal.|$|E
5|$|Jean Baptiste Point du Sable (or Point de Sable, Point au Sable, Point Sable, Pointe DuSable) (before 1750 – August 28, 1818) is {{regarded}} as the first permanent resident of what became Chicago, Illinois. Little is known of his life prior to the 1770s. In 1779, he was living on the site of present-day Michigan City, Indiana, when he was arrested by the British military on suspicion of being an American sympathizer in the American Revolutionary War. In the early 1780s he worked for the British lieutenant-governor of Michilimackinac on an estate at what is now the city of St. Clair, Michigan, before moving <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>at</b> the mouth of the Chicago River. He is first recorded living in Chicago in early 1790, having apparently become established sometime earlier. He sold his property in Chicago in 1800 and moved to St. Charles, Missouri, where he died in 1818.|$|E

25|$|After the 12th century BCE, as the Rig Veda {{had taken}} its final form, the Vedic society transitioned from {{semi-nomadic}} life to settled agriculture. Vedic culture extended into the western Ganges Plain. The Gangetic plains had remained {{out of bounds}} to the Vedic tribes because of thick forest cover. After 1000 BCE, the use of iron axes and ploughs became widespread and the jungles could be cleared with ease. This enabled the Vedic Aryans <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>at</b> the western Gangetic plains. Many of the old tribes coalesced to form larger political units.|$|E

It is known that neither the Zapotec kingdom of Zaachila nor the Aztec empire succeeded in subduing the Mixes completely.|$|E

After personally defeating and slaying the prince of Caenina in single combat, Romulus stripped him of his armour, becoming the first to claim the spolia opima, and vowed a temple to Jupiter Feretrius. Antemnae and Crustumerium were conquered in turn, and some of their people, chiefly the families of the abducted women, allowed <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>at</b> Rome.|$|E

During this period he acted as conductor at court concerts and on special occasions at the theatre. He gave lessons to a number of pianists, including the great virtuoso Hans von Bülow, who married Liszt's daughter Cosima in 1857 (years later, she would marry Richard Wagner). He also wrote articles championing Berlioz and Wagner. Finally, Liszt had ample time to compose and during the next 12 years revised or produced those orchestral and choral pieces upon which his reputation as a composer mainly rested.|$|E

25|$|Candidate {{destinations}} included Guiana, {{where the}} Dutch had already established Essequibo, or {{somewhere near the}} existing Virginia settlements. Virginia was an attractive destination because {{the presence of the}} older colony might offer better security and trade opportunities. It was thought, however, that they should not settle too near, since that might too closely duplicate the political environment back in England. The London Company administered a territory of considerable size in the region. The intended settlement location was {{at the mouth of the}} Hudson River. This made it possible <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> <b>at</b> a distance which allayed concerns of social, political, and religious conflicts, but still provided the military and economic benefits of relative closeness to an established colony.|$|E

The East India Trade Committee recommended in 1823 that a settlement be established on the coast of northern Australia to forestall the Dutch, and Captain J.J.G. Bremer, RN, was commissioned to form a settlement between Bathurst Island and the Cobourg Peninsula. Bremer fixed the site of his settlement at Fort Dundas on Melville Island in 1824 and, because this was well {{to the west of the}} boundary proclaimed in 1788, proclaimed British sovereignty over all the territory as far west as longitude 129° East.|$|E
