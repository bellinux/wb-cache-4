5|$|Looting was a concern, {{with all}} sides taking part—the {{retreating}} Germans, the invading Allies (for example British forces looting <b>the</b> <b>Musée</b> des Antiquaires in Caen and Château d'Audrieu near Bayeux), {{and the local}} French population.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Musée</b> {{des arts}} décoratifs (Museum of Decorative arts) {{is on the}} ground floor. It was {{established}} in its current form in the years 1920–1924, when the collections of the Kunstgewerbe-Museum Hohenlohe, originally established in 1887, were relocated in the stables wing adjacent to the palace apartments. The collections had previously been in the Renaissance former municipal slaughterhouse Grandes Boucheries or Große Metzig, which now hosts <b>the</b> <b>Musée</b> historique de Strasbourg.) <b>The</b> <b>Musée</b> des arts décoratifs suffered in the World War II bombing raids of 1944 but the building has since been restored and the collections replenished. Besides the furniture and decoration of the cardinals' apartments, the collections focus on the local production of porcelain (Strasbourg faience), silver-gilt, and clockmaking, with original parts of the medieval Strasbourg astronomical clock including the automaton rooster from 1354. The reconstructed living room of a former hôtel particulier, the 1750s Hôtel Oesinger, displays 18th-century furniture in situ on a more intimate scale than the rooms of the palace.|$|E
5|$|After {{the return}} of Alsace to French rule in 1918, the new {{director}} of <b>the</b> <b>Musée</b> des beaux-arts and <b>the</b> <b>Musée</b> des arts décoratifs, Hans Haug (1890–1965), put major efforts into presenting the Palais Rohan as a coherent whole again. Strasbourg suffered during World War II, and on 11August 1944 the palace was damaged by British and American bombs. After the war, restoration measures were soon undertaken {{under the supervision of}} the architects Robert Danis (1879–1949) and Bertrand Monnet (1910–1989), but in 1947 a fire broke out and devastated a significant part of the collections of the Museum of Fine Arts. This fire was an indirect consequence of the bombing raids: because of the destruction inflicted on the palace, the building had suffered from damp, which was treated with welding torches, and poor handling of these caused the fire.|$|E
5|$|Andre Schaeffner, {{a curator}} at <b>the</b> <b>Musée</b> de l'Homme, {{disagreed}} with the Hornbostel-Sachs system and developed his own system in 1932. Schaeffner believed that the pure physics of a musical instrument, rather than its specific construction or playing method, should always determine its classification. (Hornbostel-Sachs, for example, divide aerophones {{on the basis of}} sound production, but membranophones {{on the basis of the}} shape of the instrument). His system divided instruments into two categories: instruments with solid, vibrating bodies and instruments containing vibrating air.|$|E

50|$|Paul Guillaume's widow, Mrs. Jean Walter, donated their {{modern art}} {{collection}} to <b>the</b> <b>Musées</b> Nationaux in 1958. The Orangerie has housed the Paul Guillaume collection of 19th and 20th century modern paintings since 1965.|$|R
50|$|From 3 December 2000 to 20 April 2001 <b>the</b> <b>Museen</b> der Stadt Lüdenscheid held an {{exhibition}} which covered Berg, Schwarz and Zeppelin history from 1892 to 1932, with displays of documents, photographs and airship remnants.|$|R
5|$|At the time, Monet's {{innovative}} use {{of light}} and color led to its rejection by the Paris Salon of 1869. Today, art historians classify The Magpie as one of Monet's best snowscape paintings. The painting was privately held until <b>the</b> <b>Musée</b> d'Orsay acquired it in 1984; it {{is considered one of}} the most popular paintings in their permanent collection.|$|E
5|$|Bertin bequeathed the {{portrait}} {{to his daughter}} Louise (1805–77) on his death. She passed it to her niece Marie-Louise-Sophie Bertin (1836–93) wife of Jules Bapst, a later director of the Journal des débats. They bequeathed it to their niece Cécile Bapst, its last private owner. In 1897 Cécile sold it to <b>the</b> <b>Musée</b> du Louvre for 80,000 francs.|$|E
5|$|Calais {{contains}} several museums. These include <b>the</b> <b>Musée</b> des Beaux-Arts et de la Dentelle de Calais, Cité internationale de la Dentelle et de la Mode de Calais and <b>the</b> <b>Musée</b> de la Seconde Guerre Mondiale (World War II museum). Cité internationale de la Dentelle et de la Mode de Calais is a {{lace and}} fashion museum {{located in an}} old Boulart factory on the canalside and contains workshops, a library and a restaurant and regularly puts on fashion shows. The World War II museum is located at Parc St Pierre opposite the town hall {{and south of the}} train station. The building is a former Nazi bunker and wartime military headquarters, built in 1941 by the Todt Organisation. The 194-metre-long structure contains twenty rooms with relics and photographs related to World War II, and one room dedicated to World War I.|$|E

5|$|Further {{details of}} the museum's {{collection}} on opening were revealed in October 2014, {{with a number of}} important works to be loaned under the agreement with Agence France-Muséums and <b>the</b> <b>Musée</b> du Louvre, including Leonardo Da Vinci's La Belle Ferronniere and works by Henri Matisse, a self-portrait by Vincent Van Gogh, Jacques-Louis David's Napoleon Crossing the Alps and Claude Monet's Gare Saint-Lazare.|$|E
5|$|Later, in 2001, the Campagne-sur-Aude {{site was}} {{explored}} again, {{this time by}} Gerard Chauvet, Jean-Luc Le Douarec, Colette Rives and Yvonne Vidoux. After 13 years of searching, they had uncovered a mostly complete skeleton that contained much more material, including bones unknown from the holotype. The material all went to <b>the</b> <b>Musee</b> des Dinosaures, and together took about 10 years to assemble.|$|E
5|$|On {{display in}} most of the rooms are {{surviving}} works from Louis René deRohan's vast collection of Japanese vases and Chinese pottery and lacquerware from the Ming and Qing dynasties, originally destined for the new castle in Saverne.
