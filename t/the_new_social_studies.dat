50|$|For some years, critics {{argued that}} {{scholarship}} in children's geographies was characterised {{by a lack}} of theoretical diversity and 'block politics'. However, since the mid-2000s, the subdiscipline has seen a proliferation and diversification of theoretical work away from the social constructivist principles of childhood studies and <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Studies</b> of Childhood. A major, influential trend has been the development of Non-representational theory by children's geographers, and especially scholars such as Peter Kraftl, John Horton, Matej Blazek, Veronica Pacini-Ketchabaw, Affrica Taylor, Pauliina Rautio and Kim Kullman. This work shares many theoretical influences with a so-called 'new wave' of childhood studies, and especially the influence of poststructural, new materialist and feminist theorists such as Gilles Deleuze, Rosi Braidotti, Donna Haraway and Jane Bennett (political theorist). For instance, in a series of articles, John Horton and Peter Kraftl have challenged a sense of 'what matters' in scholarship with children - from the material objects, emotions and affects that characterise 'participation' {{to the ways in which}} our embodied engagements with place in childhood are carried forward into adulthood, thereby scrambling any neat notion of 'transition' from childhood to adulthood. Elsewhere, Veronica Pacini-Ketchabaw and Affrica Taylor have developed innovative approaches to understanding the 'common worlds' of children and a range of nonhuman species, including both domestic and 'wild' animals. Their vibrant 'common worlds' research collective http://commonworlds.net/ brings together a range of scholars who seek to explore how children's lives are entangled with those of nonhumans in ways that challenge oppressive, colonial and/or neoliberal views of the human as an individuated subject somehow distanced from 'nature'. Recently, there has been vibrant debate about the political value of nonrepresentational approaches to childhood. Some scholars argue that nonrepresentational theories encourage a focus upon the banal, everyday, ephemeral and small-scale at the expense of understanding and critically interrogating wider-scaled and longer-standing processes of marginalisation. Others argue that, whilst valid, nonrepresentational and 'new wave' approaches extend beyond the small-scale, offering useful and in some cases fundamental ways to critically and creatively re-think the ways that we do research with children and their 'common worlds'.|$|E

40|$|This {{pioneering}} book, {{first published}} in 1987, launched <b>the</b> <b>new</b> field of <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> of technology.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to analyze {{theoretically}} the need to improve Social Studies Education in Turkey in a pedagogical manner and on the basis of the intended contributions and goals of a New Social Studies Movement to the field. Social Studies Education is an important teaching discipline to equip individuals with the necessary knowledge, skills, values and attitudes to operate efficiently in a knowledge society. <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Studies</b> movement of 1960 s in the USA contributed to the development of Social Studies Education. This movement tried to establish a constructivist approach. They emphasized on the importance of an inquiry based approach, and rich and real life situation in the classrooms and skills such as critical thinking, reflective thinking, cooperation and collaboration in Social Studies Education. However, the movement diminished in a short while due to the lack of research to support their theoretically sound ideas, appropriate teaching resources for teachers and students and ill-equipped teachers while their ideas were and still are gaining impetus in many countries in the world. Social Studies Education is relatively new in Turkey. Social Studies Education in Turkey has weaknesses in terms of both in theoretically and practically. The quality of teaching resources and materials and teacher qualifications are not up-to-standards to carry out a constructivist Social Studies Education. A new movement has started in Turkey to improve Social Studies Education.

The radical impulse of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> {{of science in}} the early 1970 s was initiated not by followers of Mannheim, but by Wittgensteinians such as Kuhn, Bloor, and Collins. This paper inquires whether this Wittgensteinian program is not presently running into difficulties that might be resolved to some extent by reverting to a more traditional and broader agenda of research. A social theory of knowledge (or social epistemology) along Mannheimian lines would not only reinstate the "magic triangle" of epistemology, sociology, and ethics, and hence revive the vexed problem of "ideology critique," but would also need to reincorporate the social analysis of science into a broader macrosocial theory about the "knowledge society. ...|$|E

40|$|First paragraph: Recent {{research}} in <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> of childhood recognises {{that children are}} competent social actors who play {{an active part in}} their social worlds (Waksler 1991; Mayall 1994; Caputo 1995; Waksler 1996). Yet there are still relatively few studies which document the ways in which children devise ways to counteract adult's power and control over their lives. However, although the agency of children is important in understanding their capacities (Sibley 1991), it must be acknowledged that children also face limitations. The aim of this chapter is to consider how rural children in Bolivia actively negotiate ways to assert their autonomy despite being constrained by adults who enforce boundaries of time and space (James 1993; Ennew 1994; Sibley 1995). Adult-imposed limits confine children, yet children's resourcefulness and competencies enable them to create strategies for controlling their own use of time and space...|$|E
40|$|Beginning in {{the fall}} of 2004 Ohio {{teachers}} probably will be expected to integrate <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Studies</b> Academic Content Standards (passed December 2002) into their schedules with little or no formal training in the new subject content.

While interdisciplinary and constructivist perspectives on learning have been shown to increase student interest and class participation, teachers have encountered several problems when implementing these techniques (U.

This study also uses structuration theory to understand how social structures influence migrant children’s lives from their perspectives, and how children, as active agents, create their own cultures and friendships under the social environment. A total of twenty three migrant children and nineteen local children participated in the study and their ages ranged from six to thirteen years. The study uses qualitative research methods in a case study in China, including participant observations, semi-structured interviews and in-depth interviews. The research findings indicate that family migration has serious impact on migrant children’s everyday lives. Migrant children experience a different everyday life in urban China compared with local children. The social status is a main factor preventing them from enjoying equal rights and integrating in the urban city. It also affects migrant children’s lives in a fundamental way and shapes their opportunity in education. The study also finds that migrant children receive less discrimination in the city compared with previous studies, which shows that Chinese government is trying to solve structure problems in a right direction...|$|R
40|$|This is {{a largely}} {{theoretical}} thesis about <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> education in <b>New</b> Zealand. Its {{aim is to}} consider how learners’ ‘ethical decision-making and action’ (to paraphrase the curriculum) could be better supported by proposing a broad theoretical orientation to this curriculum requirement. It argues that although ethics is central to learners’ lives and to the purposes of <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> education, this has hitherto been minimally communicated and elucidated through New Zealand curriculum documentation. It takes the view that while providing pedagogical guidance to teachers is urgent and vital, theoretical considerations should be a first priority. The thesis begins by offering a partly stipulative definition for ethics and foregrounds the complexities of ethical decision-making and action in our everyday lives and in academic ethics. It then considers the relationship between ethics and the purposes of <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> education, and uses a form of content analysis to describe the curricular meanings that have been implicitly ascribed to ethics over time. It explores how <b>the</b> present <b>New</b> Zealand <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> curriculum is framed theoretically {{and what could be}} possible within this framing to better support learners to navigate in their ethical worlds. Three adjustments to the curriculum’s framing are proposed: <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> as issues-based education, as counter-socialisation, and as engagement with the philosophy of ethics. These are defended as a matter of social justice, and {{on the basis of their}} contribution to a range of <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> outcomes. The thesis then considers the theoretical underpinnings of these proposed adjustments in greater depth. It explores whether an ethically reflexive orientation would better support <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> learners’ ethical decision-making and action, through three analytic moves: charting reflexivity’s tropes in the social sciences and social theory literature, developing an understanding of ethical reflexivity, and questioning the work this concept could do in <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> education. The thesis argues that an ethically reflexive orientation is a theoretical space in the literature worthy of attention, not least because it maps onto the contemporary ethical space in which learners find themselves. The considerable challenges ahead for such an orientation are readily acknowledged, but the thesis finds within the literature, and from the perspectives of a small group of <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> teachers and learners, some optimism that a reflexive orientation could transcend the ethically silent space of <b>New</b> Zealand <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> education...|$|R
40|$|The {{main focus}} and {{aim of this}} master thesis is {{to write about the}} nature of {{friendship}} and experiences of the Southeast Asian immigrant children in Norway. The overall methodological perspective of this study is based on the philosophy of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> of childhood where children are constructed as social actors, listening to their voices, seeing them as active agents in their daily lives who are able to choose their friends and form friendship in their new country. I conducted semi-structured interview and observation with my participants and informal discussion with the parents. I interviewed eight children from ages 8 to 14 years old. In the analysis chapter I discussed about my participant’s idea of friendship or the meaning of the concept for them, I also talked about the activities they do together to nurture the friendship. I wrote down some quotations from my participants to illustrate their own words on the matter. I also discuss ways my participants formed friendship with the other children, and in doing so, it became evident to me that my younger participants form friendship with other children differently than my older participants. I further discuss the differences of friendship relations of my participants across different age groups, factors how they view friendships. I also discussed my participant’s friendship at home, in school and their neighborhood and their parent’s earlier influence on friendship formation. I also talked about my participant’s groups, their experiences of conflicts and disputes with friends. I also talked about gendered friendship because it is an important area to help us understand the nature of children’s friendship. I conclude my research with the results that among the challenges my participants experienced as an immigrant, learning the language spoken in the country where they live is the most important aspect to enable the children to form friendship with other children. My research also documented that my participants are competent children capable of adapting to a new society by learning the language, making new friends and nurture friendship. This thesis therefore confirm <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> of childhood where children are social actors who are active agents in their daily lives able to choose their friends and form friendship in their new country. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{emergence}} {{and development}} of the sociology of childhood in the UK is strongly connected to the establishment of this area of study in the Nordic countries. However any account of this must also look at the wider context of political and cultural constructions of childhood, children and young people, and intergenerational relationships in the UK. In the early stages of childhood studies there was a synchrony between the orientation of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> of childhood in the UK and changes in how children came to be politically positioned, particularly with respect to an emphasis on children’s voices, their capacity to be agentic and their status as social actors. Since then the political status of childhood has become more problematic. In the last few years there has been a notable shift towards the demonization of teenagers (adolescents) along with rising levels of anxiety concerning children generally. This represents something of a divergence between the orientations of UK policy and politics and contemporary orientations of the sociology of childhood...|$|E
40|$|Adopting {{the social}} {{sciences}} into the social studies {{was one of the}} discriminate characteristics of the New Social Stuides which were developed in the 60 's and in the early 70 s. However, it had not been positively accepted by the teachers and students in the United States. The reason of the failure has various phases, but in the present article, an attempt is made to examine the problem which lies in the curriculum itself. Here <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Studies</b> of Edwin Fenton is selected as a good example. In the process of analysis, emphasis is put on the subject matter and materials of his project (The Holt Social Studies Project), from the viewpoint of the principle of the education related to the students' experience. Two foundamental problems which occur in adopting {{the social sciences}} into the social studies are presented. One is the problem which is caused by the difference of the quantity of experience between social scientists and students. The other problem exists in the relation between the method of social sciences and studnts' learning activities...|$|E
40|$|From <b>the</b> <b>new</b> {{approaches}} in <b>social</b> <b>studies</b> {{of science and}} technology concerned with the analysis of sites where science is developed and how it circulates, I am interested to observe the Caribbean as an island-center in the tropical agronomic knowledge development. For this, I study how the scientific steps were formulated to eradicate the plagues that currently affect more intensely coconut plantations in the Caribbean and Latin America, called Lethal Yellowing Disease of Coconut, which has destroyed the industry crops in many areas. The epidemic first appeared in the nineteenth century in the Caribbean Antilles, which forced local scientists to develop a database of global knowledge. In particular, I observe the process in Cuba from scientific discussions generated at the Royal Academy of Medical Sciences, Physical and Natural Sciences of Havana, as well as the entry of U. S. scientists in <b>the</b> <b>new</b> imperial context of early twentieth century, who expanded their field of study throughout the English and Spanish Caribbean through the exchange of ideas and experiences. A partir de los nuevos enfoques en los estudios sociales de la ciencia y la tecnología interesados en el análisis de los sitios donde se produce la ciencia y cómo circula, me interesa observar el Caribe como isla-centro en la construcción del saber agronómico tropical. Para ello estudio cómo se fueron formulando científicamente los pasos a seguir para erradicar una de las plagas que actualmente afectan con más intensidad las plantaciones de cocos del Caribe y América Latina, llamada Amarillamiento Letal del Cocotero (ALC), la cual ha destruido la industria de la copra en muchas zonas productoras. La epidemia apareció por vez primera en el siglo XIX en el Caribe antillano, donde obligó a los científicos locales a elaborar un sistema de conocimiento global. En particular, observo ese proceso en Cuba a partir de los debates científicos generados en la Real Academia de Ciencias Médicas, Físicas y Naturales de La Habana, así como con la entrada de científicos norteamericanos en el nuevo contexto imperial de inicios del siglo XX, quienes ampliaron su campo de estudio a todo el Caribe inglés e hispano a través del intercambio de ideas y experiencias...|$|R
