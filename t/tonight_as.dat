To enter the drawing, the user had to book tickets for the film online, then pass an e-mail on to someone else. The idea was to encourage online ticket booking, which at the time was seen as a growing trend. The Game Boy Advance Daredevil game was released on February 14, 2003, and was created by Encore, a subsidiary of Navarre Corporation. The soundtrack to the film, , was released in February 2003.|$|E

After Zee was promoted to weather anchor of the weekday edition of Good Morning America in December 2013, the program returned to having ABC affiliate meteorologists to substitute on the Saturday and Sunday editions, until ABC announced the appointment of Rob Marciano (a former CNN meteorologist who had recently departed as co-host of Entertainment <b>Tonight)</b> <b>as</b> full-time weekend weather anchor in July 2014, effective that September.|$|E

[...] "Hear Me Now" [...] was the album's most successful single, charting variously on the Billboard Heatseeker charts, Alternative charts, and the Rock charts. On March22, the band appeared live on the late night talk show Lopez <b>Tonight</b> <b>as</b> a musical guest where they performed the single [...] "Hear Me Now" [...] to promote the album.

[...] "Been to Hell" [...] was previously released as a promotional single with a lyric video on February 6, but was then released as a single with a music video, leading to it chart on Billboards Heatseeker and Bubbling Under Hot 100 charts. Because [...] "Coming Back Down" [...] was released {{on the same day}} as [...] "Been to Hell", the track did not get a music video. [...] "Coming Back Down" [...] previously surfaced due to a leak on February 18 and was later confirmed to be on the album and was produced by Kevin Rudolf. Brian Voerding noted that the song showed the band's strength in both singing and rapping while comparing the sound to Linkin Park.

Similar to [...] "Been to Hell", [...] "Comin' in Hot" [...] was originally a free promotional single released on January 21, but was later released as an album single following the release of American Tragedy. The track was reviewed by Evigshed along with [...] "Hear Me Now" [...] after it was released as a promotional single, who gave both [...] "Comin' in Hot" [...] and [...] "Hear Me Now" [...] a perfect ten out of ten score, noting that [...] "Comin' in Hot" [...] was much more upbeat and was extremely catchy. On July 8, it was announced the fifth single for the album would be [...] "My Town". The band began shooting the music video in early July and announced that fans would be featured in the video if they recorded themselves performing the song in front of a famous landmark. The video has no release date yet.|$|E

[...] Wells ran to the sideline as before and threw diagonally down the field as before to Borleske. [...] Michigan now had four yards to go. [...] Every spectator on his feet, the Minnesota crowd crying, 'hold,' 'hold.' [...] It was a serious moment for both sides, and they took time to breathe and collect themselves for the supreme effort. [...] Wells was hurled against center, but the whole Minnesota team got into the defense and stopped the play about where it had started. [...] The next attack was deceptive. [...] Wells found a hole at left tackle, and although the enemy fell upon him furiously, they were too late, for he twisted across the line and emerged a hero.
