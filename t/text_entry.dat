40|$|Design notebooks, or logbooks, are {{typically}} used to record notes during the design process. These notes consist of <b>text</b> <b>entries</b> {{as well as}} sketches with varying levels of detail. Previous research on the design process has focused on sketches, including their effect on design outcome, differences based on prior sketching experience, and more. This paper looks at the interplay between <b>text</b> <b>entries</b> and sketches in design notebooks, and analyzes patterns that appear {{over the course of}} the design process. Data collected from eighteen logbooks from the class Design-a-palooza shows that trends exist between writings and drawings in the design process. The results of analysis of this data show that the number of sketches in a logbook increases following drawing instruction, and the design process typically starts with more <b>text</b> <b>entries</b> in logbooks, including customer needs research, followed by this increased number of sketches and then a decrease in all entries as prototyping occurs. The analysis was inconclusive in determining if students who write more ideas with text will sketch fewer ideas, as well as the relationship between partners' logbook entries. Recommendations for future research in these areas of design research are presented. by Rebecca A. Smith. Thesis (S. B.)

25|$|Although {{this was}} a {{ground-breaking}} solution employing over 20,000 ligatures (individually designed character combinations) which provided the most beautiful results and allowed newspapers such as Pakistan's Daily Jang to use digital typesetting instead of an army of calligraphers, it suffered from two problems in the 1990s: (a) its non-availability on standard platforms such as Windows or Mac OS, and (b) the non-WYSIWYG nature of <b>text</b> <b>entry,</b> whereby the document had to be created by commands in Monotype's proprietary page description language.|$|E
25|$|To make typographic apostrophes {{easier to}} enter, word {{processing}} and publishing software often converts typewriter apostrophes to typographic apostrophes during <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> (at {{the same time}} converting opening and closing single and double quotes to their correct left-handed or right-handed forms). A similar facility may be offered on web servers after submitting text in a form field, e.g. on weblogs or free encyclopedias. This {{is known as the}} smart quotes feature; apostrophes and quotation marks that are not automatically altered by computer programs are known as dumb quotes.|$|E
25|$|Some other layouts {{have also}} been {{designed}} specifically for use with mobile devices. The FITALY layout is optimised for use with a stylus by placing {{the most commonly used}} letters closest to the centre and thus minimising the distance travelled when entering words. A similar concept was followed to research and develop the MessagEase keyboard layout for fast <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> with stylus or finger. The ATOMIK layout, designed for stylus use, was developed by IBM using the Metropolis Algorithm to mathematically minimize the movement necessary to spell words in English. The ATOMIK keyboard layout is an alternative to QWERTY in ShapeWriter's WritingPad software. ASETNIOP is a keyboard layout designed for tablet computers that uses 10 input points, eight of them on the home row.|$|E

40|$|The Omaha System {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used {{standards}} for documentation in community-based settings. While researchers have focused upon this extensible classification scheme to understand and summarize structured data, few studies have analyzed the use of associated text. Two years of client records were accessed from two diverse sites utilizing the Omaha System 2005 revision: a skilled homecare, hospice, and palliative care program and a maternal child health home visiting program. Each problem allows users to enter text data for “other” signs and symptoms (S&S). Problems with the most frequent use of Other S&S were analyzed by a group of content experts to categorize associated text and inform future standard refinements. <b>Text</b> <b>entries</b> for Other S&S frequently contained duplicate entries, multiple concepts, medical diagnoses, interventions, or comments. A number of potential new and modified S&S were identified. <b>Text</b> <b>entries</b> for Other S&S appear valuable for informing future standard development...|$|R

[...] Mad Catz and Agetec created racing wheels for racing games. [...] Sega decided against releasing its official light {{gun in the}} U.S., but some third party light guns were available. The Dreamcast supports a Sega fishing [...] "reel and rod" [...] motion controller and a keyboard for <b>text</b> <b>entry.</b> Although it was designed for fishing games such as Sega Bass Fishing, Soul Calibur was playable with the fishing controller, which translated vertical and horizontal movements into on-screen swordplay {{in a manner that}} was retroactively cited as a predecessor to the Wii Remote. The Japanese Dreamcast port of Sega's Cyber Troopers Virtual-On Oratorio Tangram supported a [...] "Twin Sticks" [...] peripheral, but the game's American publisher, Activision, opted not to release it in the U.S. The Dreamcast could connect to SNK's Neo Geo Pocket Color, predating Nintendo's GameCube–Game Boy Advance link cable. Sega also produced the Dreameye, a digital camera that could be connected to the Dreamcast and used to exchange pictures and participate in video chat over the system's Internet connection. Sega hoped developers would use the Dreameye for future software, as some later did with Sony's similar EyeToy peripheral. In addition, Sega investigated systems that would have allowed users to make telephone calls with the Dreamcast, and discussed with Motorola the development of an Internet-enabled cell phone that would have used technology from the console to enable quick downloads of games and other data.|$|E

2500|$|In normal usage, the {{keyboard}} {{is used as}} a <b>text</b> <b>entry</b> interface to type text and numbers into a word processor, text editor or other programs. In a modern computer, the interpretation of key presses is generally left to the software. A computer keyboard distinguishes each physical key from every other and reports all key presses to the controlling software. Keyboards are also used for computer gaming, either with regular keyboards or by using keyboards with special gaming features, which can expedite frequently used keystroke combinations. A keyboard is also used to give commands to the operating system of a computer, such as Windows' Control-Alt-Delete combination, which brings up the system security options screen.|$|E

English text words define data fields and are used to locate specific data for review. Individual visit records may be reviewed or a concatenated set of records for a single patient may be examined. The search and audit program may be run at specified intervals to monitor the impact of the review process on subsequent care...|$|R
2500|$|From the 19 sites examined, {{four were}} found to be {{specific}} to certain diseases only and were therefore excluded from the study. Another four were excluded for reasons such as recurrent technical problems or connections to a specific hospital’s information system. [...] The remaining 11 sites did not provide patients with sufficient guidance as to how they should enter personal data. [...] Some of the sites allowed patients to select medical conditions from categorized lists which did not cover the patients’ complete health condition while others allowed free <b>text</b> <b>entry.</b> To formulate medication history, sites that required patients to choose medication from lists requested them to enter a wide range of descriptive information for each medication such as prescribed dose, administration frequency, start date, name of pharmacy that issued the medication and name of provider that prescribed the medication. With respect to laboratory tests, only two allowed patients to import results from outside sources. From these two sites, only one was functional.
