50|$|Tuan Mami covered Japan Foundation Library {{floor with}} 100 kg of rice seeds and a <b>thick</b> <b>sheet</b> of <b>glass.</b> This {{installation}} created {{a field of}} rice - an “utopia” within a normal library. The pressed rice seeds by glass gradually grew day by day even without water and soil throughout the exhibition duration. The visitors might paradoxically feel {{the freedom of the}} rice plants that grow in such difficult conditions as well as the risky and impossible temptation of touching to feel the rice plant. In the exhibition opening, Tuan Mami invited his mother to be an art tour guide and invited 100 of her female friends to come to visit the exhibition. It {{was the first time in}} their life to see an art exhibition. The artworks re-constructs the relationship between different generations, between audience-art-artist-artspace, re-analyzes the definition of social view while dig into the structure of an artwork.|$|R
40|$|Direct {{deposition}} of graphene on substrates would avoid costly, time consuming and defect inducing transfer techniques. In this paper we used ultrathin films of Ni, with thickness ranging from 5 to 50 nm, as a catalytic surface on glass to seed and promote {{chemical vapor deposition}} (CVD) of graphene. Different regimes and dynamics were studied for various parameters including temperature and reaction time. When a critical temperature (700 °C) was reached, Ni films retracted and holes formed that {{are open to the}} glass surface, where graphene deposited. After CVD, the residual Ni could be etched away and the glass substrate with graphene regained maximum transparency (> 90 %). The fact that we could achieve low growth temperatures indicates the potential of the technique to widen the range of substrate materials over which graphene can be directly deposited. We demonstrated this by depositing graphene patterns on ultrathin, 100 μm <b>thick,</b> <b>sheet</b> of <b>glass</b> with low strain point (670 °C), particularly suitable for flexible electronic and optoelectronic devices.

40|$|A {{mechanically}} {{flexible and}} wavelength-tunable laser with an ultra-thin glass membrane as substrate is demonstrated. The optically pumped hybrid device has a distributed feedback cavity that combines a colloidal quantum dot gain film with a grating-patterned polymeric underlayer, {{all on a}} 30 -μm <b>thick</b> <b>glass</b> <b>sheet.</b> The total thickness of the structure is only 75 μm. The hybrid laser has an average threshold fluence of 450 ± 80 μJ/cm 2 (for 5 -ns excitation pulses) at an emitting wavelength of 607 nm. Mechanically bending the thin-glass substrate enables continuous tuning of the laser emission wavelength over an 18 -nm range, from 600 nm to 618 nm.

The MWNTs were added at this step when ZnO/MWNT composite films {{were to be}} made. The nanoporous films were prepared by applying the pastes onto commercial fluorine-doped tin oxide [FTO] substrates (Nippon <b>Sheet</b> <b>Glass,</b> 8 to 10 Ω/□, 3 mm <b>thick)</b> (Nippon <b>Sheet</b> <b>Glass</b> Company, Tokyo, Japan) by the doctor-blade method using adhesive tapes as a frame and spacer. The active electrode area was 0.25 cm 2, and the films had a thickness of 8 μm. The resulting films were then gradually heated and annealed at 150 °C for 1 h to remove organic materials in the paste and to increase crystallinity of ZnO. After being cooled to room temperature, the porous films were sensitized by immersing them into a dye solution that contained 0.5 mM of cis-bis (isothiocyanato) bis-(2, 2 '-bipyridyl- 4, 4 '-dicarboxylato)-ruthenium(II)bis-tetrabutylammonium (Solaronix, N 719) (Solaronix SA, Aubonne, Switzerland) in a mixed solvent consisting of equal parts of acetonitrile and tert-butanol. The dye-adsorption time lasted for 2 h. The dye-loaded electrodes were then rinsed with acetonitrile and dried in the air. The counter electrode was made of FTO glass, onto which a nanocrystalline platinum [Pt] catalyst was deposited by decomposition of H 2 PtCl 6 at 400 °C for 20 min. The ZnO photoanode and the counter electrode were sealed together with a 60 μm-thick hot-melting spacer (DuPont, Surlyn, Shanghai, People's Republic of China), and the inner space was filled through a hole with a volatile electrolyte composed of 0.1 M lithium iodide, 0.6 M 1, 2 -dimethyl- 3 -propylimid- azolium iodide (PMII, Merk Ltd., Taiwan, Republic of China) 0.05 M I 2 (Sigma-Aldrich China, Inc., Shanghai, People's Republic of China), and 0.5 M tert-butylpyridine (Sigma-Aldrich China, Inc., Shanghai, People's Republic of China) in acetonitrile.|$|R

Concepts utilizing the effective notch stress claim {{to account for the}} variation of the weld shape parameters, however, size effects are not taken into account. Therefore, an expansion of the notch stress approach has been developed, which includes consideration of the geometrical and statistical size effect in order to extend the application to thin and <b>thick</b> <b>sheet</b> structures. It is also capable of evaluating highly localized three-dimensional stress concentrations at weld start and end points. To validate the quality of this approach, experimentally determined fatigue data for thin steel sheet specimens from the Institute of Material Mechanics, including weld start and end points, and data from the literature regarding conventional <b>thick</b> <b>sheet</b> components without weld start and end points were reevaluated.

Underneath the standard aluminium roof a second roof, fabricated from armoured steel, was installed. This provided overhead protection from gunfire, petrol bombs and IEDs. Large plates of ballistic steel were bolted {{to the sides of}} the vehicle, which wrapped around the rear pillar and met with an armoured double door. Both of these doors and the side plates were fitted with sliding pistol ports, allowing the officers inside to return fire {{in the event of an}} ambush. The rear doors, sides and roof constituted an armoured box providing all round protection to the crew in the rear of the vehicle. For the protection of the driver and the front seat passenger, the windscreen and side windows were replaced with <b>thick</b> <b>sheets</b> of bulletproof <b>glass,</b> along with armour-plated doors. Finally, a fabricated (not expanded) metal grille could be pulled up over the windscreen to prevent the windscreen being broken by thrown objects during civil disorder, and the side windows covered with a sheet of transparent polycarbonate for the same purpose.The Hotspur was immediately put into action and worked admirably. Myriad modifications were carried out over the years, including lining the vehicles' lower panels with sheets of polycarbonate to prevent the body panels from being dented during civil disorder. Metal grilles and rubber skirts were fitted around the lower perimeter of the vehicle to prevent projectiles being thrown under the body at officers who were sheltering behind, and also to prevent beer kegs being rolled under the vehicle in an attempt to immobilise it.|$|R

A novel method of shaping <b>sheet</b> <b>glass</b> is presented. This method reduces the surface waviness of a <b>glass</b> <b>sheet</b> and changes its shape while it is in its hot state and without contacting its surface. A <b>sheet</b> of <b>glass</b> is inserted between two parallel porous mandrels such that it is at a predefined distance from the two. A thin layer of pressurized gas flows through each mandrel and out against the glass surfaces. The resulting viscous flow against the heated soft <b>glass</b> <b>sheet</b> changes its surface topography. By using flat mandrels and controlled pressurized gas at temperatures close to 600 °C, the outcome is a flat <b>sheet</b> of <b>glass</b> with its original immaculate optical qualities. The flow in porous mandrels and the resulting pressure distribution along the surfaces of a <b>glass</b> <b>sheet</b> inserted between two porous mandrels is modeled.
