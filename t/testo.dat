5|$|Testaroli is {{prepared}} from a batter that is cooked {{on a hot}} flat surface, after which it may be consumed. It is traditionally cooked on a <b>testo,</b> a flat terra cotta or cast iron cooking surface from which the food's name is derived. It is sometimes cooked further in boiling water and then served. Testaroli is {{sometimes referred to as}} a bread, similar to focaccia in composition, and is sometimes referred to as a crêpe. It may be dressed with pesto sauce or other ingredients such as olive oil, Pecorino cheese, Parmigiano-Reggiano, and garlic. Falsi testaroli al ragu is a similar dish prepared using sliced pasta dough and a ragù sauce.|$|E
5|$|Testaroli {{is a type}} of pancake-like pasta {{prepared}} using water, {{wheat flour}} and salt that is sliced into triangular shapes. Chestnut flour is sometimes used in its preparation. The ingredients are mixed together and prepared as a batter, after which it is cooked, sometimes using a two-stage cooking process. In the typical first stage, and sometimes only stage of cooking, the batter is poured and cooked on a hot, flat surface in the style of a pancake or crêpe. In this process, testaroli is traditionally cooked on a <b>testo,</b> which may be prepared for use by being heated over hot coals. A skillet is another cooking device {{that can be used to}} cook the batter. The pasta is then sliced into triangles, and is sometimes directly served after this cooking process. In the second cooking stage that is sometimes performed, the pasta may be set aside to cool, and then cooked further in boiling water.|$|E

40|$|THE {{application}} of the statistical technique of factorial analysis to endocrine experiments was outlined in the first paper of this series, Breneman (1951). The factorial experiment was de-veloped by the administration of preg-nant-mare-serum (P. M. S.) and testos-terone-propionate (T. P.) separately and in combination to unoperated chicks, uni-laterally-castrated chicks, and capons. The data previously considered were those related to the factors which influ-ence androgen production in chicks, and several important features of testicular secretion in the chick were demonstrated by the factorial analysis. First, the single testis of the unilaterally-castrated fowl secretes considerable androgen, but much less than secreted by the two gonads of unoperated chick. Second, the secre-tory activity of the single testis is in-creased only slightly by P. M. S. Third, there is an inhibition {{of the effect of}} the P. M. S. as a result of simultaneous ad-ministration of T. P. Fourth, the capon combs demonstrated a relatively greater response to T. P. than did those of uni-laterals or normals.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is devoted}} to seismic tomography. I have implemented a new modelling tool for 3 -D joint refraction and reflection travel-time tomography of wide-angle seismic data (TOMO 3 D). The reason behind this central objective is {{the evidence that the}} information based on 2 -D seismic data does not allow to capture the structural complexity of many 3 -D targets, and in particular that of the seismogenic zone in subduction margins. The scientific rationale for this statement, which justifies the central part of my thesis work, is based on the analysis of 2 -D models obtained in the convergent margin of Nicaragua, a seismically active area where a textbook example of tsunami earthquake took place in 1992. In this application I modelled two perpendicular wide-angle seismic profiles for the characterisation of the overriding plate and the interplate fault. To do this, I applied TOMO 2 D, a state-of-the-art joint refraction and reflection 2 -D travel-time tomography code. The inversion outcomes are two 2 -D velocity models along both profiles, together with the 1 -D geometry of the interplate boundary. In combination with other geophysical data measurements, namely coincident multichannel seismic profiles and gravity data, these models provide new constraints on the nature and structure of the margin, and in particular add new insights on the nucleation and propagation of the said earthquake and its tsunamigenic behaviour. Ultimately, this case study evidences the aforementioned limitations of 2 -D modelling in the investigation of 3 -D geological structures and phenomena. Following from this first application and with the idea of increasing the amount of data used in travel-time tomography, I focused on an a priori paradoxical phenomenon related to water-layer multiple phases, that under certain circumstances, is observed on wide-angle record sections. The interest of this study {{lies in the fact that}} this phenomenon can provide additional constraints on travel-time tomography models. First, I propose and corroborate the hypothesis explaining the apparent paradox, and then derive the most favourable geological conditions for the phenomenon to occur. Subsequently, the possibility to model this multiple-like phases is introduced in TOMO 3 D. The development of TOMO 3 D, which constitutes the core of my work, is founded on TOMO 2 D, from which it inherits the numerical methods for solving the forward and inverse problems. Source files have been rewritten, redefining and introducing the necessary variables and functions to handle 3 -D data inversion. The tests made with the sequential version of the code emphasise the need of parallelisation for practicality reasons. Indeed, the increasing size of data sets along with the modelling of the additional spatial dimension results in computationally demanding inversions. Hence, I parallelised the forward modelling part of the code, which takes up to 90 % of the computing time, with a combination of multiprocessing and message-passing interface extensions. Subsequently, the parallel version of TOMO 3 D is applied to a complex synthetic case simulating a subduction zone. This first 3 -D application serves to evaluate the correctness of the code's programming, and as step-by-step description of the modelling procedure, with particular attention on the layer-stripping strategy used to successively model several reflectors. The outcomes demonstrate the ability of the code and the chosen inversion strategy to accurately recover the velocity distribution and the geometry of the two reflectors. Finally, TOMO 3 D is applied to a real 3 -D wide-angle seismic data set acquired at the Pacific margin of Ecuador and Colombia to extract a 3 -D velocity model of the overriding and incoming plates, which is then compared to previous results obtained with an extensively tested and used 3 -D refraction travel-time tomography code (FAST). The comparison indicates that TOMO 3 D is more accurate than FAST but at the same time it is computationally more demanding. However, the parallelisation of TOMO 3 D allows using high-performance computing facilities, which is not the case of FAST or most of the existing codes. Aquesta tesi està dedicada a la tomografia sísmica. Concretament, he implementat una eina de modelització 3 D per a la tomografia conjunta de temps de trajecte de refraccions i reflexions (TOMO 3 D). La raó darrere d'aquest objectiu és l'evidència de que la informació basada en dades sísmiques 2 D no permet copsar la complexitat de gran part dels cossos geològics, i en particular de la zona sismogènica en marges de subducció. El desenvolupament del TOMO 3 D es basa en el TOMO 2 D, un codi d'avantguarda per a la tomografia conjunta de refraccions i reflexions en 2 D. Els arxius de codi han estat reescrits, redefinint i introduint les funcions necessàries per dur a terme la inversió 3 D. Els <b>testos</b> fets amb la versió seqüencial del codi posen de manifest la necessitat de paral·lelització ja que l'increment de la mida dels conjunts de dades així com la modelització de la dimensió espacial afegida fan que les inversions siguin computacionalment exigents. La versió paral·lelitzada del TOMO 3 D ha sigut aplicada a un cas sintètic complex que simula una zona de subducció. Aquesta primera aplicació 3 D serveix per avaluar la correcció de la programació del codi, i com a descripció pas a pas del procediment de modelització. Els resultats demostren la capacitat del codi per recuperar acuradament la distribució de velocitat i la geometria dels dos reflectors. Finalment, el TOMO 3 D és aplicat a un conjunt 3 D de dades de sísmica de gran angle adquirit al marge pacífic d'Equador i Colòmbia per extreure'n un model 3 D de la velocitat de les plaques cavalcant i subduïda, que és comparat amb el resultat obtingut amb un codi 3 D de tomografia de temps de trajecte de refraccions (FAST). La comparació indica que el TOMO 3 D és més acurat que el FAST però al mateix temps és computacionalment més exigent. Tot i així, la paral·lelització del TOMO 3 D permet utilitzar plataformes de supercomputació, a diferència del que passa amb el FAST i la majoria de codis existents...|$|R
