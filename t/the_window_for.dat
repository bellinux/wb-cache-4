25|$|The book is {{in three}} sections, on telepathy, on sense of direction, {{including}} animal migration and the homing of pigeons, and on animal precognition, including premonitions of earthquakes and tsunamis. Sheldrake examined more than 1,000 case histories of {{dogs and cats}} that seemed to anticipate their owners' return by waiting at a door or window, sometimes {{for half an hour}} or more ahead of their return. He did a long series of experiments with a dog called Jaytee, in which the dog was filmed continuously during its owner's absence. In 100 filmed tests, on average the dog spent far more time at the window when its owner was on her way home than when she was not. During the main period of her absence, before she started her return journey, the dog was at <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>for</b> an average of 24 seconds per 10-minute period (4% of the time), whereas when {{she was on her way}} home, during the first ten minutes of her homeward journey, from more than five miles away, the dog was at <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>for</b> an average of five minutes 30 seconds (55% of the time). Sheldrake interpreted the result as highly significant statistically. Sheldrake performed 12 further tests, in which the dog's owner travelled home in a taxi or other unfamiliar vehicle at randomly selected times communicated to her by telephone, to rule out the possibility that the dog was reacting to familiar car sounds or routines. Sheldrake also carried out similar experiments with another dog, Kane, describing the results as similarly positive and significant.|$|E

500|$|Because {{only five}} {{terrestrial}} orders of mammals {{have made it}} to the island, each likely to have derived from a single colonization, and since these colonizations date to either the early Cenozoic or the early Miocene, the conditions for oceanic dispersal to Madagascar seem to have been better during two separate periods in the past. A report published in January 2010 supported this assumption by demonstrating that both Madagascar and Africa were [...] south of their present-day positions around 60mya, placing them in a different ocean gyre and reversing the strong current that presently flows away from Madagascar. [...] The currents were even shown to be stronger than they are today, shortening the rafting time to approximately 30 days or less, making the crossing much easier for a small mammal. [...] Over time, as the continental plates drifted northward, the currents gradually changed, and by 20mya <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>for</b> oceanic dispersal had closed.|$|E
500|$|Earlier, Håkan {{stops and}} kills a passerby {{on a busy}} {{footpath}} near a main road to harvest fresh blood for Eli, but he fails to return with any when he is interrupted by an approaching dog walker. Eli is prompted to waylay and kill a local man, Jocke, making {{his way home from}} a bar after having said goodnight to his best friend, Lacke. A local cat-loving recluse, Gösta, witnesses the attack from his flat. He does not believe what he has seen and decides not to report the incident. Håkan hides Jocke's body in an ice-hole in the local lake. Håkan later makes another well-prepared but incompetently executed effort to obtain blood for Eli by trapping a teenage boy in a changing room after school. The boy's friends are waiting for him to emerge, and go to see what is holding him up. Before he is discovered, Håkan pours concentrated hydrochloric acid onto his own face, disfiguring it to prevent the authorities from identifying him and tracing Eli. Eli learns that Håkan has been taken to the hospital and scales the building to access his restricted room. Håkan opens <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>for</b> Eli and offers his neck to her for feeding; after she has fed, Håkan falls out of the window onto the snow and dies. Now alone, Eli goes to Oskar's apartment and spends the night with him, during which time they agree to [...] "go steady".

500|$|Once {{part of the}} supercontinent Gondwana, {{the island}} of Madagascar has been {{isolated}} since it broke away from eastern Africa (~160mya), Antarctica (~80–130mya), and India (~80–90mya). Since ancestral lemurs {{are thought to have}} originated in Africa around 62 to 65mya, they must have crossed the Mozambique Channel, a deep channel between Africa and Madagascar with a minimum width of about 560km (350mi). In 1915, paleontologist William Diller Matthew noted that the mammalian biodiversity on Madagascar (including lemurs) can only be accounted for by random rafting events, where very small populations rafted from nearby Africa on tangled mats of vegetation, which get flushed out to sea from major rivers. This form of biological dispersal can occur randomly over millions of years. In the 1940s, American paleontologist George Gaylord Simpson coined the term [...] "sweepstakes hypothesis" [...] for such random events. Rafting has since been the most accepted explanation for the lemur colonization of Madagascar, but until recently this trip was thought to be very unlikely because strong ocean currents flow away from the island. In , a report demonstrated that around 60mya both Madagascar and Africa were 1,650km (1,030mi) south of their present-day positions, placing them in a different ocean gyre, producing currents that ran counter to what they are today. The ocean currents were shown to be even stronger than today, which would have pushed a raft along faster, shortening the trip to 30days or less—short enough for a small mammal to survive easily. As the continental plates drifted northward, the currents gradually changed, and by 20mya <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>for</b> oceanic dispersal had closed, effectively isolating the lemurs {{and the rest of the}} terrestrial Malagasy fauna from mainland Africa. Isolated on Madagascar with only a limited number of mammalian competitors, the lemurs did not have to compete with other evolving arboreal mammalian groups, such as squirrels. They were also spared from having to compete with monkeys, which evolved later. The intelligence, aggression, and deceptiveness of monkeys gave them an advantage over other primates in exploiting the environment.|$|E

2500|$|Toward {{the end of}} the Faith 7 flight {{there were}} mission-threatening {{technical}} problems. During the 19th orbit, the capsule had a power failure. Carbon dioxide levels began rising, and the cabin temperature jumped to over 100 degrees Fahrenheit (38°C). Cooper turned to his understanding of star patterns, took manual control of the tiny capsule and successfully estimated the correct pitch for re-entry into the atmosphere. Some precision was needed in the calculation, since if the capsule came in too steep, g-forces would be too large, and if its trajectory were too shallow, it would shoot out of the atmosphere again, back into space. Cooper drew lines on the capsule window to help him check his orientation before firing the re-entry rockets. [...] "So I used my wrist watch for time," [...] he later recalled, [...] "my eyeballs out <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>for</b> attitude. Then I fired my retrorockets at the right time and landed right by the carrier." [...] Cooper's cool-headed performance and piloting skills led to a basic rethinking of design philosophy for later space missions.|$|E
2500|$|As the {{presence}} of Judge Malipiero would endanger them, the policemen tell the Maniac {{to leave for the}} time being. Instead, the Maniac intends to disguise himself as a forensic expert from Rome, Captain Piccini. The Maniac leaves the office. Feletti nearly exposes the three policemen, until the Maniac reenters, as an extravagantly-dressed amputee. The Maniac manages to concoct a story on how the anarchist died: one of the impatient policemen hit the anarchist in the neck, an ambulance being called; the anarchist then being led to <b>the</b> <b>window</b> <b>for</b> fresh air, and pushed accidentally out of the window due to uncoordinated balance between the two policemen leading him to the window.

Bertozzo suddenly enters, delivering a replica of a bomb from another anarchist attack. Bertozzo partially recognises the Maniac, as he knows Captain Piccini, but is dissuaded by Pissani and the Superintendent.
