After {{a short period}} in England at a glider and paratrooper training center, he was posted to No. 405 Squadron RCAF. On returning in difficult weather conditions after bombing Berlin with the squadron {{on the night of}} November 7, 1941, he was forced to land his aircraft on a non-operational airfield, and as a result was temporarily suspected of being a spy by the Home Guard.|$|E
5|$|Aside from locally formed militia units, the {{military}} {{did not have}} a significant presence in the Moncton area until the beginning of the Second World War. In 1940, a large military supply base (later known as CFB Moncton) was constructed on a railway spur line north of downtown next to the CNR shops. This base served as the main supply depot for the large wartime military establishment in the Maritimes. In addition, two Commonwealth Air <b>Training</b> <b>Plan</b> bases were also built in the Moncton area during the war: No. 8 Service Flying Training School, RCAF, and No. 31 Personnel Depot, RAF. The RCAF also operated No. 5 Supply Depot in Moncton. A naval listening station was also constructed in Coverdale (Riverview) in 1941 to help in coordinating radar activities in the North Atlantic. Military flight training in the Moncton area terminated at the end of World War II and the naval listening station closed in 1971. CFB Moncton remained open to supply the maritime military establishment until just {{after the end of the}} Cold War.|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} of Loughborough University for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy. <b>Train</b> <b>Planning</b> (also known as railway scheduling) {{is an area of}} substantial importance to the success of any railway. Through <b>train</b> <b>planning,</b> railway managers aim {{to meet the needs of}} customers whilst using as low a level of resources (infrastructure, rolling stock and staff) as possible. Efficient and effective <b>train</b> <b>planning</b> is essential to get the best possible performance out of a railway network. The author of this thesis aims, firstly, to analyse the processes which are used to develop <b>train</b> <b>plans</b> and the extent to which they meet the objectives that they might be expected to meet and, secondly, to investigate selected new and innovative software approaches that might make a material difference to the effectiveness and/or efficiency of <b>train</b> <b>planning</b> processes. These aims are delivered using a range of primarily qualitative research methods, including literature reviews, interviews, participant observation and case studies, to understand these processes and software. Conclusions regarding <b>train</b> <b>planning</b> processes include how the complexity of these processes hinders their effectiveness, the negative impact of the privatisation of British Rail on these processes and the conflicting nature of objectives for <b>train</b> <b>planning</b> in the privatised railway. <b>Train</b> <b>planning</b> software is found not to adequately support train planners in meeting the objectives they are set. The potential for timetable generation using heuristics and for timetable performance simulation to improve the effectiveness of <b>train</b> <b>planning</b> are discussed and recommendations made for further research and development to address the limitations of the software currently available...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} a requirements engineering approach to <b>training</b> <b>planning.</b>  Training is a short-term educational process that uses procedures {{to allow the}} students to develop abilities, attitudes, and expertise for a very specific purpose. Planning is critical for a successful training program. Requirements engineering has demonstrated to be an adequate technique for product development. It aims at the documentation of functional and also non-functional equirements, i. e., what the product or system must do, and how it should work. We approach <b>training</b> <b>planning</b> through the documentation of its requirements, and then use these to propose a form-based framework to document the important elements of <b>training</b> <b>planning.</b> Keywords: <b>planning,</b> <b>training,</b> engineering of requirement...|$|R

5|$|During World War II, Moore {{joined the}} Home Guard in East Grinstead {{where his father}} had been elected platoon commander. Despite recounting in his {{autobiography}} that he had lied about his age to join the Royal Air Force in 1940 at age 16, records show that he enlisted in the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve in December 1941 at age 18 and was not called up for service until July 1942 as an Aircraftman, 2nd Class. After basic training at various RAF bases in England, he went to Canada under the British Commonwealth Air <b>Training</b> <b>Plan</b> and completed training at RAF Moncton in New Brunswick as a navigator and pilot. In his biography, he claims to have met Albert Einstein and Orville Wright while on leave in New York. Returning to England in June 1944, he was commissioned as a Pilot officer and was posted to RAF Millom in Cumbria, where he was a navigator in the crew of a Vickers Wellington bomber, engaged in maritime patrolling and bombing missions to mainland Europe. After the end of hostilities, Moore became an adjutant and then an Area Meteorological Officer, finally demobilised in October 1945 with the rank of Flying officer.|$|E
5|$|Raised to {{temporary}} air commodore, Goble {{took over}} as CAS {{for the second time}} between December 1932 and June 1934, while Williams attended the Imperial Defence College in London. On secondment to the RAF from 1935 to 1937, Goble was attached to the British Air Ministry as Deputy Director of Air Operations. In this capacity he attended a conference in 1936 to examine a Commonwealth-wide air <b>training</b> <b>plan,</b> a concept that would be revived in World War II as the Empire Air Training Scheme. Continuing his exchange posting, on 1 September Goble {{took over as}} Air Officer Commanding No. 2 (Bomber) Group, based in Hampshire. The group comprised fifteen squadrons, putting him in charge of a force stronger than the entire RAAF. On 28 February 1937, Goble was raised to temporary air vice marshal. He succeeded Williams as Chief of the Air Staff for the last time in February 1939, when the latter was dismissed from his position {{in the aftermath of the}} Ellington Report criticising the standards of training and air safety observed by the RAAF. When he replaced Williams, Goble was Air Member for Personnel and might therefore have been considered more closely responsible for such standards; he maintained that Williams had personally overseen the service's air training since 1934.|$|E

40|$|It {{would appear}} {{premature}} to herald block periodization as a ‘new horizon’ in <b>training</b> <b>planning,</b> {{partly because of}} a fundamental lack of supporting evidence and clearly delineated rationale, and partly because contradictory evidence exists questioning its universal efficacy in elite contexts. What block periodization does positively contribute to current planning methodologies is a more formal description of a particular planning tactic that may be advantageously added to the elite coaches menu of potential planning options. Therefore, while blocked-training schemes may be useful ploys in specific training contexts, the claim that this framework represents a new departure in <b>training</b> <b>planning</b> may be somewhat overly enthusiastic. Hence, perhaps a more appropriate description of block periodization is ‘new variation’, rather than a ‘new horizon’, in sports <b>training</b> <b>planning...</b>|$|R

40|$|In Australia, and elsewhere, the {{movement}} of trains on long-haul rail networks is usually planned in advance. Typically, a <b>train</b> <b>plan</b> is developed {{to confirm that the}} required train movements and track maintenance activities can occur. The plan specifies when track segments will be occupied by particular trains and maintenance activities. On the day of operation, a train controller monitors and controls {{the movement}} of trains and maintenance crews, and updates the <b>train</b> <b>plan</b> in response to unplanned disruptions. It can be difficult to predict how good a plan will be in practice. The main performance indicator for a train service should be reliability - the proportion of trains running the service that complete at or before the scheduled time. We define the robustness of a <b>planned</b> <b>train</b> service to be the expected reliability. The robustness of individual train services and for a <b>train</b> <b>plan</b> as a whole can be estimated by simulating the <b>train</b> <b>plan</b> many times with random, but realistic, perturbations to train departure times and segment durations, and then analysing the distributions of arrival times. This process {{can also be used to}} set arrival times that will achieve a desired level of robustness for each train service...|$|R
