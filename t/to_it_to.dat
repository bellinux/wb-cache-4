5|$|International {{publishers}} expressed {{some interest}} in carrying Elmer, {{but none of them}} would commit <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> <b>To</b> generate more interest among readers, Alanguilan released the sold-out first issue for free online. This led publisher Editions Ca Et La to purchase the French rights in 2010. After Alanguilan exchanged emails with publisher Dan Vado, Slave Labor Graphics released Elmer as a 144-page trade paperback in North America. Slave Labor Graphics also distributes the comic digitally.|$|E

5|$|A {{shot line}} is a rope between a float at the surface, and a {{sufficiently}} heavy weight holding the rope approximately vertical. The shot line float should be sufficiently buoyant to support the weight of all divers {{that are likely to}} be using it at the same time. Recreational divers are free to choose lesser buoyancy at their own risk. The shot weight should be sufficient to prevent a diver from lifting it from the bottom by over-inflation of the buoyancy compensator or dry suit, but not sufficient to sink the float if the slack on the {{line is a}}ll taken up. Various configurations of shot line are used to control the amount of slack. The diver ascends along the shotline, and may use it purely as a visual reference, or can hold on <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> positively control depth, or can climb up it hand over hand. A Jonline may be used to fasten a diver to a shotline during a decompression stop.|$|E

5|$|After {{restoring}} the Beanstar, Mario and Luigi travel to Joke's End {{to make the}} exchange, once again traveling through a maze filled with puzzles to be solved. Bowletta refuses to hand over Peach, but Luigi, disguised in Peach's spare dress, ends up being taken in Peach's stead. He escapes from the repaired Koopa Cruiser, reclaiming the Beanstar in the process. The brothers return to Beanbean Castle Town, finding it under attack by Bowletta using Bowser's flying castle. The brothers and Prince Peasley fly up <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> stop Cackletta. Mario and Luigi battle past the Koopalings, but before they can reach Bowletta the brothers encounter Fawful yet again. A fierce battle between the three ensues with the brothers coming out on top. But Fawful plays a dirty trick and attacks the brothers while they weren't paying attention. However, Prince Peasly comes in and send Fawful flying, seemingly defeating him. The Bros. finally confront Bowletta and another epic battle begins. Feigning defeat, she tricks the brothers and swallows them. After waking up in her belly, the brothers battle and defeat Cackletta's soul, exorcising her from Bowser's body. The two are regurgitated and Bowser returns to normal. Afterwards, the brothers escape the castle before it explodes from a bomb set by Peasley. The explosion sends the castle falling into the ocean. Exhausted from their vacation, Mario, Luigi, Peach and Toadsworth decide {{to head back to}} the Mushroom Kingdom. Before they can leave, Peasley brings a farewell gift for them to take home, which is Bowser, who regained his memory. The gang then returns home, and a movie based on their adventure is being shown at the Yoshi Theatre.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{introduction}} of toss-up puzzles {{at the start of}} the 18th syndicated season in 2000, the contestant at the red arrow always started round 1, with the next contestant clockwise starting each subsequent round. In addition, if a tie for first place occurred, an additional speed-up round was played between the tied contestants for the right to go to the bonus round. The wheel formerly featured a Free Spin wedge, which automatically awarded a token that the contestant could turn in after a lost turn to keep control of the wheel. It was replaced in 1989 with a single Free Spin token placed over a selected cash wedge. Free Spin was retired, and Free Play introduced, {{at the start of the}} 27th syndicated season in 2009. Between September 16, 1996 and the end of season 30 in 2013, the show featured a progressive Jackpot wedge, which had been in several different rounds in its history. The jackpot started at $5,000 and had the value of every spin within the round added <b>to</b> <b>it.</b> <b>To</b> claim the jackpot, a contestant had to land on the wedge, call a correct letter, and solve the puzzle all in the same turn. In later years, it also offered $500 per correct letter and $500 to the jackpot, regardless of whether or not it was won in that turn.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the two new cups, {{it is also possible}} to create custom cups. The disk can save up to a hundred tracks and up to three ghost racers per course. IGN singled out the track creator as the F-Zero X Expansion Kits strongest feature since it is virtually the same tool the designers of F-Zero X used for themselves to create the original circuits. The Car Editor offers a variety of options when creating a vehicle. Using a set of pre-existing parts, the player must balance their creations' settings and performance abilities before the machine is finished and named. The Track Editor is a detailed track creator that allows the player to design their own racing circuits. Using a cursor, the player can determine the basic layout of the track and also add points <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> create track elements such as curves and hills. Furthermore, numerous different properties like half pipes and cylinders, as well as numerous road surfaces, such as slip zones, can be added. The player can test the creation at any time and run practice laps.|$|E
50|$|As {{for many}} of the {{aluminium}} alloys, Y alloy age hardens spontaneously at normal temperatures after solution heat treating. The heat treatment is <b>to</b> heat <b>it</b> <b>to</b> 500 to 520 C for 6 hours, then <b>to</b> allow <b>it</b> <b>to</b> age naturally for 7-10 days. The precipitation hardening that takes place during this ageing forms precipitates of both CuAl2 and NiAl3.|$|R

5|$|Section 1(3) of the 1971 Act {{specifies}} that offences {{under section}} 1, where the destruction or damage {{is caused by}} fire, shall be charged as arson. It would seem that courts adopt a purposive view {{in relation to the}} lawful excuse defence in relation to arson, as in R v. Hunt (1977). The defendant, wishing to highlight the lack of fire defences in an old people's home, set fire <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> demonstrate the risks. He claimed an honest belief in that by doing this, he had a lawful excuse within section 5(2). It was held, however, that he had not actually been acting so as to protect property. Although the court assumed that his belief was honest, it ruled that his intention was to draw attention to faulty fire defences rather than to defend the property itself.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Bohemond seized Antioch, Leo laid siege <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> press Raymond-Roupen's cause, but Bohemond's allies, Az-Zahir Ghazi and Suleiman II, Seljuq Sultan of Rum, stormed into Cilicia, forcing Leo to {{withdraw}} in July 1201. He soon sent letters to Pope Innocent, informing him of Bohemond's {{cooperation with the}} Muslim rulers. Leo again invaded Antioch in 1202, but Aimery, King of Jerusalem and Cyprus, and the papal legate, Cardinal Soffredo, mediated a truce. After BohemondIV refused to acknowledge {{the right of the}} Holy See to pass judgement {{in the case of the}} succession of Antioch, Leo renewed the war. Taking advantage of Bohemond's absence, Leo entered Antioch on 11November 1203, but he was not able to seize the citadel, which was defended by the Templars and the troops of the commune. Before long, Az-Zahir Ghazi again invaded Cilicia, forcing Leo to return to his kingdom.|$|E
5|$|Wooden carvings in {{the shape}} of hawks, ancient gods, serpents and turtles are also popular. The Grand Huts, also known as grande case (chef's hut), are {{decorated}} with the filial of fleche faitiere representing the ancestral spirits, symbolic of transition between the world of the dead and the world of the living. The wood carving is shaped like the spear-like carving that adorns the top of the grande case. It comprises three parts; the flat crowned face representing the ancestor with a long, the rounded pole run through by conch shells mounted on it that represents the ancestor’s voice, and a base with the pole fixed <b>to</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> symbolise the link between the clan and the chief. The central piece is also flanked by wooden pieces with sharp points (facing downwards) that are intended to prevent bad spirits enveloping the ancestor in the central part. As it represented the power of the chiefs over their subjects, it was adopted as flag of the Kanaks by the organization leading the independent movement in New Caledonia. The arrow or the spear normally has a needle at the end to insert threaded shells from bottom to top. After the death of a Kanak chief, the fleche faitière is removed and his family takes it to their home. Though it was allowed to be used again as a sign of respect it is normally kept at burial grounds of noted citizens or at the mounds of abandoned grand houses.|$|E
