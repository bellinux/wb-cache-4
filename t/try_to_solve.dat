5|$|Throughout the film, Father John is {{warned that}} {{his role as}} a priest comes with boundaries, and that he should not become {{personally}} involved with the congregants or <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> their problems except through counseling. However, Father John begins to question those boundaries and reconsider whether the role as priest goes far enough in having a positive, substantive impact on the lives of those in his care, particularly Linda. And, in addition to questioning whether he is helping his congregants, Father John questions whether staying within those boundaries is enough to personally fulfill himself as a priest and provide his own life with meaning. He ultimately crosses over those boundaries and gets personally involved in trying to help Linda by delving into the city's red-light district to seek her.|$|E

The series {{revolves around the}} lives of two working-class friends, a blue jay named Mordecai and a raccoon named Rigbyboth employed as groundskeepers at a local park. They usually <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> a simple problem but then it leads to a surreal, extreme, and often supernatural misadventure.

25|$|One of {{the leading}} {{hypotheses}} for why ancient Mars was wetter than today is that a thick, carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere created a global greenhouse, that warmed the surface enough for liquid water to occur in large amounts. Carbon dioxide ice in today's polar caps is too limited in volume to hold that ancient atmosphere. If a thick atmosphere ever existed, it was either blown into space by solar wind or impacts, or reacted with silicate rocks to become trapped as carbonates in Mars' crust. One of the goals that drove CRISM's design was to find carbonates, to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> this question {{about what happened to}} Mars' atmosphere. And one of CRISM's most important discoveries was the identification of carbonate bedrock in Nili Fossae in 2008. Soon thereafter, landed missions to Mars started identifying carbonates on the surface; the Phoenix Mars lander found between 3–5 wt% calcite (CaCO3) at its northern lowland landing site, while the MER Spirit rover identified outcrops rich in magnesium-iron carbonate (16–34 wt%) in the Columbia Hills of Gusev crater. Later CRISM analyses identified carbonates in the rim of Huygens crater which suggested that there could be extensive deposits of buried carbonates on Mars. However, a study by CRISM scientists estimated that all of the carbonate rock on Mars holds less that the present Martian atmosphere worth of carbon dioxide. They determined that if a dense ancient Martian atmosphere did exist, it is probably not trapped in the crust.|$|E
25|$|To {{obtain the}} {{behavior}} of the Yang–Mills theory at high energies, and so to prove asymptotic freedom, one applies perturbation theory assuming a small coupling. This is verified a posteriori in the ultraviolet limit. In the opposite limit, the infrared limit, the situation is the opposite, as the coupling is too large for perturbation theory to be reliable. Most of the difficulties that research meets is just managing the theory at low energies. That is the interesting case, being inherent to the description of hadronic matter and, more generally, to all the observed bound states of gluons and quarks and their confinement (see hadrons). The most used method to study the theory in this limit is to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> it on computers (see lattice gauge theory). In this case, large computational resources are needed to be sure the correct limit of infinite volume (smaller lattice spacing) is obtained. This is the limit the results must be compared with. Smaller spacing and larger coupling are not independent of each other, and larger computational resources are needed for each. As of today, the situation appears somewhat satisfactory for the hadronic spectrum and the computation of the gluon and ghost propagators, but the glueball and hybrids spectra are yet a questioned matter in view of the experimental observation of such exotic states. Indeed, the σ resonance(600) pole and scattering length |journal=Physical Review D |volume=76 |issue=7 |page=074034 |year=2007 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.76.074034|arxiv = hep-ph/0701025 |bibcode = 2007PhRvD..76g4034G }} is not seen in any of such lattice computations and contrasting interpretations have been put forward. This is a hotly debated issue.|$|E

500|$|Investigations {{into the}} effect {{revealed}} what was causing the problem. While {{in the ground}} effect, the high-pressure air under the craft was trapped, filling the entire area and thus providing a stable base. When the craft rose {{out of the ground}} effect, the air formed itself into a single narrow column, described by Frost as [...] "tree trunking". At intermediate altitudes the craft would momentarily transition from one regime to the other, during which time one side of the vehicle would be entirely supported while the support was disappearing under the other. This led to a strong pitching motion towards the unsupported side. As soon as this occurred that side would approach the ground and re-establish the supporting air, while the other side would then be raised above this limit. This process would repeat itself, with the craft rolling from side to side. Modifications were carried out in order to <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>solve</b> the problem. Eventually a series of 52 holes were drilled {{in the bottom of the}} vehicle, located radially three feet from the center. These were to provide a central jet to stabilize the ground cushion.|$|E
