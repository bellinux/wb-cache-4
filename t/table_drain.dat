40|$|Most drain spacing {{calculations}} do {{not take}} the horizontal flow in the unsaturated zone above the groundwater table into consideration. In this paper, a solution is presented that includes the contribution of unsaturated flow above the groundwater <b>table.</b> <b>Drain</b> spacing calculated with the newly derived equation is compared to that calculated with the Hooghoudt equation and the two-dimensional Hydrus- 2 D model. Results show that drain spacing calculated with the new equation results in a wider value. The effects are most pronounced for tiles located close to the impervious layer, particularly in coarse, sandy soils. These effects rapidly decrease if {{the depth of the}} impervious layer increases. The effect of the unsaturated zone flow contribution is limited to sandy soils, for low infiltration ratios and tiles placed on top of an impervious layer. The maximum increase in drain spacing calculated by the new formula is about 30 % higher, suggesting that inclusion of the contribution of the unsaturated zone flow in the computation of drain spacing may result in greater economy in the design of subsurface drainage systems. Moreover, the new equation is more general and is applicable for tiles lying on or far from an impervious layer...|$|E
40|$|Subsurface {{drainage}} is {{a prerequisite}} to grow winter crops in the consolidated paddy fields in Northern Iran. A four-year study (2011 - 2015) was conducted to quantify the effects of subsurface drainage on the saturated hydraulic conductivity, water <b>table,</b> <b>drain</b> discharge and winter crop yields. Subsurface drainage systems with two drain depths of 0. 65 and 0. 90 m and two drain spacings of 15 and 30 m were installed at the consolidated paddy fields of Sari Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources University, Iran. During four successive winter seasons, the water table depth and drain discharge were measured daily. Soil saturated hydraulic conductivity was measured twice; before drainage system installation and four years following the installation. Canola grain yields were determined at harvest of each cultivation season. During the study period, the soil saturated hydraulic conductivity increased with the highest increase in the top 0 - 30 cm. The deeper drains were more effective in controlling the water table compared to the shallow, and the daily drain discharge of the deeper drains in the fourth year were {{higher than those of}} shallow drains. The canola grain yield of all drainage systems increased significantly by the seasons, and the largest difference in canola grain yield between first and fourth seasons was 2191 kg· ha - 1 (318 % increase) in the fields with 0. 90 m drain depth and 30 m drain spacing. Totally, it became clear that installation of subsurface drainage systems with 0. 90 m depth and 30 m spacing in the paddy fields of Northern Iran can be recommended to achieve high yield of winter crop, soil condition improvement, and multi-purpose land use. </p...|$|E

40|$|One of Australia’s premier tourist locations, Tasmania also boasts Australia’s highest {{incidence}} of wildlife roadkill, a sight that often offends tourists. Tasmanian tourism is highly regarded for its wildlife tourism sector, which attracts many {{visitors to the}} state to view and interact with wildlife. Tasmanian newspapers and State government departments commonly receive letters and telephone calls from visitors and residents who demand government action {{to reduce the amount}} of roadkill on Tasmanian roads. These protests are often based on ethical and aesthetic grounds. Wildlife roadkill can also directly adversely impact on wildlife tourism businesses themselves. Wildlife tourist operators rely on relatively high density, accessible populations of wildlife, so that viewing of wildlife is reliable. In some situations, these populations are threatened by high levels of road mortality. Roadkill also negatively impacts the tourism industry because it represents a risk to driver safety. Reduction in the availability of hire cars due to associated repairs, especially over the summer months, is also a negative impact on the tourism industry. The objectives of this project were to address these issues by evaluating techniques to reduce wildlife roadkill and discussing suitability and implementation of these methods in Tasmania. A number of techniques were not evaluated, but are covered briefly. Several measures were identified as being likely to reduce wildlife roadkill and/or decreasing visitor distress on account of roadkill. These are: wildlife signage, escape routes, <b>table</b> <b>drain</b> (ditch) management, platypus crossings, underpasses and potentially odour repellents. Ultrasonic whistles, wildlife reflectors and lighting have doubtful application, at least in Tasmania, although managers should follow up on current research in these areas. Light-coloured road surfacing and use of “driving lights” remain as possibilities for further trials. In terms of further research, priority should be given to research furthering our understanding of roadkill events and sites, and wildlife behaviour in reaction to oncoming traffic. This information will better equip research into wildlife mitigation measures. These results are useful for road management authorities, environmental management authorities, and consultants who provide advice on mitigation of environmental impacts of road developments. This document will enable better roadkill mitigation, which will result in an improved experience for visitors to Tasmania...|$|E
50|$|The {{three levels}} {{making up the}} Wind Cave system {{are located in the}} upper 76 m of the Mississippian Pahasapa (Madison) Limestone. Deposited in an inland sea, chert, gypsum, and {{anhydrite}} lenses within the limestone are evidence of high periods of evaporation. When sea levels dropped {{at the end of the}} Mississippian, dissolution of the limestone formed a Kaskaskia paleokarst terrain, complete with solution fissures, sinkholes, and caves. Thus, an unconformity exists between this limestone and the overlying Pennsylvanian Minnelusa Formation. These red sands and clays filled in cavities. Those cavities not filled in were coated in dogtooth spar. Subsequent deposition of the Permian Opeche Shale, Permian Minnekahta Limestone, Triassic Spearfish Formation, and Tertiary White river Group followed. Paleocene and Eocene erosion removed these overlying sediments, in the area of the caves, down to the Minnelusa. Geologic uplift started during the Laramide Orogeny, which lowered the water <b>table,</b> <b>draining</b> the cave system and enlarging it.

40|$|Unsealed {{roads and}} tracks are {{acknowledged}} {{as the major}} sources of sediment pollution in forested catchments. In particular, road to stream connectivity via gullied pathways as well as via diffuse overland flow can contribute to significant fine sediment inputs to forest streams. At present in the State forests of New South Wales (NSW), Australia, road drainage spacings are determined {{on the basis of}} road slope. In this study forest road surveys were conducted across seven coastal catchments near Coffs Harbour on the sub-tropical NSW mid north coast to determine connectivity between gravel roads and streams via channelised and diffuse pathways under a range of rainfall intensities. A total of 10. 82 km of representative road sections was assessed, comprising 129 relief pipes and 22 mitre drains. Of the 151 drains surveyed, gullies were evident at the outlets of 26 relief pipes (20. 2 %) but at none of the mitre drains. Relationships previously derived between contributing road length and hillslope gradient, and between contributing area and hillslope gradient adequately predicted thresholds of gully formation at drain outlets. During lower intensity storms with average recurrence intervals of 10 years or less, less than 20 % of drains are connected to streams via overland flowpaths. However, the degree of diffuse connectivity increases when contributing area takes account of <b>table</b> <b>drains</b> and cut batters, as well as with increasing rainfall intensity. We conclude that when constructing new roads or reassessing drainage on existing roads in forest environments, in addition to preventing erosion of the road surface, gully formation and connectivity with streams via diffuse overland flow should be avoided.

Preventing or reducing road-to-stream connectivity is essential for reducing impacts on water quality across all land tenures...|$|R

When calculating the shape of the water table, its level at the water divide is initially not known. Therefore, this level is to be assumed before the calculations on the shape of the water table can be started.

40|$|Thin {{rainwater}} lenses (RW-lenses) {{near the}} land surface {{are often the}} only source of freshwater in agricultural areas with regionally-extensive brackish to saline groundwater. The seasonal and inter-annual dynamics of these lenses are poorly known. Here this knowledge gap is addressed by investigating the transient flow and mixing processes in RW-lenses beneath two tile-drained agricultural fields in the Netherlands. Evidence of RW-lens dynamics was systematically collected by monthly ground and soil water sampling, in combination with daily observations of water <b>table</b> elevation, <b>drain</b> tile discharge and drain water salinity. Based on these data, and numerical modeling of the key lens characteristics, a conceptual model of seasonal lens dynamics is presented. It is found that variations in the position of the mixing zone and mixing zone salinities are small and vary on a seasonal timescale, which is attributed to the slow transient oscillatory flow regime in the deepest part of the lens. The flow and mixing processes are faster near the water table, which responds to recharge and evapotranspiration at a time-scale less than a day. Variations of drain tile discharge and drain water salinity are also very dynamic as they respond to individual rain events. Salinities of soil water can become significantly higher than in the groundwater. This is attributed to the combined effect of capillary rise of saline groundwater during dry periods and incomplete flushing by infiltrating freshwater due to preferential flow through cracks in the soil. The results of this study are the key to understanding the potential impact of future climate change and to designing effective mitigating measures such as adapting tile-drainage systems to ensure the future availability of freshwater for agriculture...|$|R

Controlled drainage {{has been recognized}} as an effective option to optimize soil moisture conditions for agriculture and to reduce unnecessary losses of fresh water and nutrients. This is achieved by introducing control structures with adjustable overflow levels into subsurface tube drain systems. A small-scale (1  ha) field experiment was designed to investigate the hydrological and chemical changes after introducing controlled drainage. Precipitation rates and the response of water <b>tables</b> and <b>drain</b> fluxes were measured in the periods before the introduction of controlled drainage (2007 – 2008) and after (2009 – 2011). For the N and P concentration measurements, auto-analyzers for continuous records were combined with passive samplers for time-averaged concentrations at individual drain outlets. The experimental setup enabled the quantification {{of changes in the}} water and solute balance after introducing controlled drainage. The results showed that introducing controlled drainage reduced the drain discharge and increased the groundwater storage in the field. To achieve this, the overflow levels have to be elevated in early spring, before the drain discharge stops due to dryer conditions and falling groundwater levels. The groundwater storage in the field would have been larger if the water levels in the adjacent ditch were controlled as well by an adjustable weir. The N concentrations and loads increased, which was largely related to elevated concentrations in one of the three monitored tube drains. The P loads via the tube drains reduced due to the reduction in discharge after introducing controlled drainage. However, this may be counteracted by the higher groundwater levels and the larger contribution of N- and P-rich shallow groundwater and overland flow to the surface water...|$|R

Based on these measurements, soil parameters were determined and nine drainage equations were tested in simulating water table recession against actual field data of two drained experimental sites, located in Soja city west of Okayama prefecture, Japan, having drain spacing of 10 and 8. 5 m for a period of two years. An experimental drainage equation was also derived and theoretical equations were recommended for design of subsurface drainage systems...|$|R
