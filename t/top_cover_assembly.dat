It {{consists of three}} units: user interface, processing and material handling. In the image processing unit, the image is aligned and then the glue route is extracted. Four partial dark-field images were obtained from each plate. For each image, the reference coordinate system is first determined to construct a rigid-body transformation from predefined template images. Two binary templates were used to identify the defective route in the test image. Our system is efficient and can achieve a very high accuracy. (a) (b) ...|$|E

Real time performance evaluation was conducted to determine the effectiveness of the new battery in retaining the electrolyte. Asymmetric polysulfone membrane that functions as an electrolyte retainer was introduced and attached to the battery using a special designed battery <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> <b>assembly.</b> The in-car testing results exhibited that during charging process, electrolyte losses of a membrane-assisted sealed lead acid battery over a period of 1440 hours is approximately 0. 134 grams per hour as compared to 1. 790 grams per hour for conventional lead acid battery...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Gearbox <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> {{is a vital}} {{component}} of horizontally split integrally geared centrifugal compressor. Reliability of <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> {{is directly related to}} the structural rigidity and structural integrity of compressor. Assuming that the <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> is designed within the mechanical limits of its construction material, one of the most common causes of <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> failure is resonance. The aim of the designer while designing <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> is to have minimum weight and still have sufficient rigidity to avoid resonance. It is imperative; however, that rigorous engineering analysis is applied in the initial design phase to prevent resonance that will result in failure of gearbox <b>top</b> <b>cover.</b> To meet the objectives of designing a reliable integrally geared centrifugal compressor, gearbox <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> modal analysis is of utmost importance. Numerical modal analysis, usually based on Finite Element Method, is commonly used to determine the vibration characteristics, such as natural frequencies and the associated mode shapes of a structure. This paper addresses finite element analysis and modal testing of gearbox <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> of an integrally geared centrifugal compressor. The goal is to determine, verify and validate the vibration characteristics of the gearbox <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> using both analytical and experimental techniques. The 3 -D solid model of the gearbox <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> was built using Autodesk Inventor®. ANSYS workbench 13 ® was used for preprocessing, solving and post processing. Modal analysis involved extraction of mode shapes and natural frequencies. Impact testing using hammer excitation was used to experimentally determine the vibration properties of the gearbox to...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is {{concentrated}} on the experimental investigation of wear resistance of rubber powder modified rubber blends. Styrene-Butadiene-Rubber (SBR) blends applied for conveying belt <b>top</b> <b>covers</b> have been modified by ground rubber (rubber powder) based on SBR. We theoretically described the rubber wear mechanism due to loading conditions occurring at conveyor belts in the field, to simulate wear behavior of <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> rubber materials. An own developed testing equipment based on gravimetric determination of mass loss of rubber test specimen was used investigating dynamic wear with respect to fracture properties of <b>top</b> <b>cover</b> materials. Furthermore we investigated fatigue crack growth (FCG) data over a broad range of tearing energy by Tear Analyzer to characterize crack propagation behavior of rubber powder modified rubber blends. Thus, we demonstrate the influence of rubber powder on resistance against occurrence of fracture as well as dynamic wear {{as a function of the}} rubber powder content in rubber blends applied for conveying belt <b>top</b> <b>covers...</b>|$|R

Each of them are presented in an understandable sketch and defined in a morphological box to ease the posterior evaluation of all them. Then an evaluation of all the candidates is presented recording the subjective but controlled opinion of the project manager and the project assistant.
