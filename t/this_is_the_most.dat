5|$|B.sessilis var. sessilis is an autonym that {{encompasses}} the type material of the species. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> widespread variety, occurring from Regans Ford and Moora in the north, south-east to Albany, and inland {{as far as}} Wongan Hills, Pingelly and Kulin. Its blue-green leaves are cuneate (wedge-shaped) or oblong, and are usually two to three centimetres long but may reach five.|$|E

5|$|In {{the same}} year the first hydrogen-cooled {{turbogenerator}} went into service with gaseous hydrogen as a coolant in the rotor and the stator in 1937 at Dayton, Ohio, by the Dayton Power & Light Co.; because of the thermal conductivity of hydrogen gas, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> common type in its field today.|$|E
5|$|Lastly, Asch {{suggested}} that group influence can change how people perceive stimuli (See Asch, 1940 for an example). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> obscure of Asch's major ideas, {{in large part}} because it has not been cited frequently (Levine, 1999), but is none-the-less important because it speaks to the power of group influence.|$|E

5|$|More {{problematic}} for non-commercial plants is the fungus, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. narcissi, which causes basal rot (rotting of the bulbs and yellowing of the leaves). <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> serious disease of Narcissus. Since the fungus can {{remain in the}} soil for many years {{it is necessary to}} remove infected plants immediately, and to avoid planting further narcissi at that spot for a further five years. Not all species and cultivars are equally susceptible. Relatively resistant forms include N. triandrus, N. tazetta and N. jonquilla.|$|E
5|$|Sensory– darkening, smoke, foaming, thickening, rancid {{taste and}} {{unpleasant}} smell when heating. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> unreliable way {{to decide when}} to change oil because those are very individual factors and can depend on different causes.|$|E
5|$|The rush: If {{the prey}} {{attempts}} to flee, the wolves immediately pursue it. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> critical {{stage of the}} hunt, as wolves may never catch up with prey running at top speed. If their prey is travelling in a group, the wolves either attempt {{to break up the}} herd, or isolate one or two animals from it.|$|E

5|$|<b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> aquatic {{species of}} the genus Agkistrodon, and is usually {{associated}} with bodies of water, such as creeks, streams, marshes, swamps, and the shores of ponds and lakes. The U.S. Navy (1991) describes it as inhabiting swamps, shallow lakes, and sluggish streams, but it is usually not found in swift, deep, cool water. Behler and King (1979) list its habitats as including lowland swamps, lakes, rivers, bayheads, sloughs, irrigation ditches, canals, rice fields, and small, clear, rocky, mountain streams.|$|E
5|$|Viruses are {{the most}} {{abundant}} biological entity in aquatic environments—there are about one million {{of them in a}} teaspoon of seawater—and they are essential to the regulation of saltwater and freshwater ecosystems. Most of these viruses are bacteriophages, which are harmless to plants and animals. They infect and destroy the bacteria in aquatic microbial communities and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important mechanism of recycling carbon in the marine environment. The organic molecules released from the bacterial cells by the viruses stimulate fresh bacterial and algal growth.|$|E

5|$|Among catchers, Mike Piazza has won {{the most}} Silver Slugger Awards, with ten {{consecutive}} wins in the National League between 1993 and 2002; <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> Silver Sluggers won consecutively by any player in Major League Baseball. In the American League, Iván Rodríguez {{has won the}} most Silver Sluggers, with six consecutive wins from 1994 to 1999, and a seventh when he tied with Víctor Martínez in 2004. Lance Parrish won the American League award six times (1980, 1982–1984, 1986, and 1990), and Jorge Posada has won it five times, including four consecutive (2000–2003, 2007). Hall of Famer Gary Carter (1981–1983, 1984–1986) and Brian McCann (2006, 2008-2011) are five-time winners in the National League. Other multiple awardees include Joe Mauer (four wins; 2006, 2008–2010), Benito Santiago (four wins; 1987–1988, 1990–1991), Mickey Tettleton (three wins; 1989, 1991–1992) and Carlton Fisk (three wins; 1981, 1985, 1988). McCann and Alex Avila are the most recent National and American League winners, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Four pilosity {{patterns}} (patterns of hair-like setae) {{are known}} to occur within Tatuidris collections. Pilosity pattern A consists of a mix of both long flexuous and short appressed setae. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> common pilosity pattern {{and the one that}} most resembles the type specimens from El Salvador and the gyne from Otongachi, Ecuador. Pilosity pattern B is characterized by very short, fully appressed, and regular spaced setae arrayed homogeneously and equidistantly on the head, mesosoma, petiole, postpetiole and gaster. Pilosity pattern C is characterized by dense lanose-looking setae. Pilosity pattern D consists of short and uniform decumbent (strongly inclined but not fully appressed) setae scattered throughout the body.|$|E
5|$|Given that {{ascending}} cholangitis usually {{occurs in}} the setting of bile duct obstruction, various forms of medical imaging may be employed to identify the site and nature of this obstruction. The first investigation is usually ultrasound, as <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> easily available. Ultrasound may show dilation of the bile duct and identifies 38% of bile duct stones; it is relatively poor at identifying stones farther down the bile duct. Ultrasound can help distinguish between cholangitis and cholecystitis (inflammation of the gallbladder), which has similar symptoms to cholangitis but appears differently on ultrasound. A better test is magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), which uses magnetic resonance imaging (MRI); this has a comparable sensitivity to ERCP. Smaller stones, however, can still be missed on MRCP depending {{on the quality of the}} hospital's facilities.|$|E

5|$|Gram-positive {{bacteria}} usually develop {{resistance to}} linezolid {{as the result}} of a point mutation known as G2576T, in which a guanine base is replaced with thymine in base pair 2576 of the genes coding for 23S ribosomal RNA. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> common mechanism of resistance in staphylococci, and the only one known to date in isolates of E. faecium. Other mechanisms have been identified in Streptococcus pneumoniae (including mutations in an RNA methyltransferase that methylates G2445 of the 23S rRNA and mutations causing increased expression of ABC transporter genes) and in Staphylococcus epidermidis.|$|E
5|$|P. fimbriata {{is found}} in the rain forests of India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Hong Kong, Taiwan, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, Malaysia {{including}} Malacca, Indonesia, and in Australia's Northern Territory and Queensland. It lives on foliage, tree trunks, boulders, and rock walls. Throughout its range, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> common species of the genus Portia. Queensland specimens of P. fimbriata live near running water and where there is moderate light, while Northern Territory specimens live in caves where the light varies from rather dark at the back to much brighter around the mouths. Other populations of Portia also live with higher light levels than in Queensland, and some members of these other populations are found in webs exposed to direct sunlight for part of the day. In Queensland, P. fimbriata shares its environment with a common prey, the very abundant Jacksonoides queenslandicus, and with large populations of other non-Portia salticids and non-salticid web-building spiders.|$|E
5|$|Poultry, {{kept for}} their eggs {{and for their}} meat, include chickens, turkeys, geese and ducks. The great {{majority}} of laying birds used for egg production are chickens. Methods for keeping layers range from free-range systems, where the birds can roam as they will but are housed at night for their own protection, through semi-intensive systems where they are housed in barns and have perches, litter and some freedom of movement, to intensive systems where they are kept in cages. The battery cages are arranged in long rows in multiple tiers, with external feeders, drinkers, and egg collection facilities. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> labour saving and economical method of egg production but has been criticised on animal welfare grounds as the birds are unable to exhibit their normal behaviours.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> recent {{burial of}} an Austrian royal in the Imperial Crypt—following a centuries-old ceremony—where 145 {{other members of}} the House of Habsburg, among them many Holy Roman Emperors and Austrian Emperors, have been entombed since 1633.|$|R
