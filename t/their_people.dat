5|$|Additional Native resentment {{resulted}} from Amherst's decision in February 1761 {{to cut back}} on the gifts given to the Native Americans. Gift giving had been {{an integral part of the}} relationship between the French and the tribes of the pays d'en haut. Following a Native American custom that carried important symbolic meaning, the French gave presents (such as guns, knives, tobacco, and clothing) to village chiefs, who in turn redistributed these gifts to <b>their</b> <b>people.</b> By this process, the village chiefs gained stature among <b>their</b> <b>people,</b> and were thus able to maintain the alliance with the French. Amherst, however, considered this process to be a form of bribery that was no longer necessary, especially since he was under pressure to cut expenses after the war with France. Many Native Americans regarded this change in policy as an insult and an indication that the British looked upon them as conquered people rather than as allies.|$|E

To preserve the covenant between <b>their</b> <b>people</b> and God, Jews dip the Sabbath bread in salt.|$|E

5|$|In {{a sign of}} {{problems}} to come, three Spaniards passing through a region near the Peñol de Cerquín were attacked and killed. This area was considered pacified, and the attack deeply disturbed Montejo, since similar incidents during his conquest of Yucatán had been a prelude to general uprisings. He rushed {{to the scene of}} the attack with a strong force, and summoned all the native leaders to meet him, in an effort to forestall rebellion. He investigated the attack and meted out punishment to the most guilty, then continued with conciliatory policies towards the rest of the leaders, who reaffirmed their loyalty. Montejo let the leaders return to <b>their</b> <b>people,</b> then marched to Comayagua to reinforce Cáceres, before returning to Gracias a Dios.|$|E

5|$|Soebadio Sastrosatomo {{wrote that}} Santoso's {{selection}} as social minister {{was important for}} several reasons.

Secondly, {{it was a way}} for Sjahrir to show that the Indonesian people were committed to the needs of <b>their</b> <b>people,</b> by having a woman deal with women's issues. After Santoso, other women have held government positions. The second female Indonesian minister, S. K. Trimurti, served as minister of labour from 1947 to 1948. In 2001, Megawati Sukarnoputri became the first female president of Indonesia.|$|E

5|$|The film {{compares the}} rise of the {{neoconservative}} movement in the United States and the radical Islamist movement, drawing comparisons between their origins, and remarking on similarities between the two groups. More controversially, it argues that radical Islamism as a massive, sinister organisation, specifically in the form of al-Qaeda, is a myth, or noble lie, perpetuated by leaders of many countries—and particularly neoconservatives in the U.S.—in a renewed attempt to unite and inspire <b>their</b> <b>people</b> after the ultimate failure of utopian ideas.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} Burnham-on-Sea {{is the history}} of the {{reclamation}} of the Somerset Levels from the River Severn and the Bristol Channel.

This could have been in part to maintain navigational systems, to aid ships entering the River Parrett and what is now Highbridge. When the Romans left, the system of drainage they installed was not maintained, and the areas reverted to become a tidal salt flat during the Anglo Saxon period.|$|E

5|$|A minor {{incident}} in the K'iche' capital Q'umarkaj escalated to have important consequences. A K'iche' soldier tried to seize bread from a Kaqchikel woman who was selling it in the market. The woman refused the soldier and drove him off with a stick. The Kaqchikel demanded {{the execution of the}} K'iche' soldier while the K'iche' nobility demanded the punishment of the Kaqchikel bread seller. When the Kaqchikel lords refused to hand her over, the K'iche' lords sentenced Hun-Toh and Wuqu-Batz' to death against the wishes of the K'iche' king K'iq'ab. King K'iq'ab warned his Kaqchikel friends and advised them to flee Q'umarkaj. On the day 13 Iq' of the Kaqchikel calendar the four lords of the Kaqchikel led <b>their</b> <b>people</b> out of the K'iche' capital to found their own capital at Iximche. The exact year of this event is not known with certainty but {{is believed to have been}} between AD 1470 and 1485, with some scholars, such as Guillemín, preferring 1470. The Kaqchikel abandoned their previous capital Chiavar (speculated to be modern Chichicastenango) because it was too close to Q'umarkaj.|$|E
5|$|Bloemfontein, {{the former}} British {{garrison}} town, became the Free State's capital; the Transvaal {{seat of government}} became Pretoria, named after the elder Pretorius. The South African Republic was in practice split between the south-west and central Transvaal, where most of Pretorius's supporters were, and regionalist factions in the Zoutpansberg, Lydenburg and Utrecht districts that viewed any central authority with suspicion. Kruger's first campaign as a commandant was {{in the latter part}} of 1854, against the chiefs Mapela and Makapan near the Waterberg. The chiefs retreated into what became called the Caves of Makapan ("Makapansgat") with many of <b>their</b> <b>people</b> and cattle, and a siege ensued in which thousands of the defenders died, mainly from starvation. When Commandant-General Piet Potgieter of Zoutpansberg was shot dead, Kruger advanced under heavy fire to retrieve the body and was almost killed himself.|$|E
5|$|Diplomatic efforts {{between the}} Netherlands and the Republic {{continued}} throughout 1948 and 1949. Political pressures, {{both domestic and}} international, hindered Dutch attempts to decide upon objectives. Similarly, Republican leaders faced great difficulty in persuading <b>their</b> <b>people</b> to accept diplomatic concessions. By July 1948 negotiations were in deadlock and the Netherlands pushed unilaterally towards Van Mook’s federal Indonesia concept. The new federal states of South Sumatra and East Java were created, although neither had a viable support base. The Netherlands set up the Bijeenkomst voor Federaal Overleg (BFO) (or Federal Consultative Assembly), a body comprising {{the leadership of the}} federal states, and charged with the formation of a United States of Indonesia and an interim government by the end of 1948. The Dutch plans, however, had no place for the Republic unless it accepted a minor role already defined for it. Later plans included Java and Sumatra but dropped all mention of the Republic. The main sticking point in the negotiations was the balance of power between the Netherlands High Representative and the Republican forces.|$|E

5|$|Hamurabi in {{particular}} is mostly known for its appearance in Ahl's book. The original game, a text-based strategy video game of land and resource management, was developed by Doug Dyment at DEC in 1968 as The Sumer Game. Dyment created it as a computer game for fellow employee Richard Merrill's newly invented FOCAL programming language. The game consists of ten rounds wherein the player, as the ancient Babylonian king Hammurabi, manages how much of their grain to spend on crops for the next round, feeding <b>their</b> <b>people,</b> and purchasing additional land, while dealing with random variations in crop yields and plagues. Multiple versions of the game were created for the FOCAL and FOCAL-69 languages, but an expanded, uncredited version of the game was included in 101 BASIC Computer Games as Hamurabi, and later versions of the game, even in FOCAL, referenced the new title over the old. Hamurabi influenced many later strategy and simulation games and is an antecedent to the city-building genre.|$|E
5|$|Hamurabi is a text-based {{strategy}} {{video game}} {{of land and}} resource management first developed by Doug Dyment in 1968. It was developed by Dyment at Digital Equipment Corporation as The Sumer Game before {{the rise of the}} commercial video game industry in the early history of video games as a computer game for fellow employee Richard Merrill's newly invented FOCAL programming language. The game consists of ten rounds wherein the player, as the ancient Babylonian king Hammurabi, manages how much of their grain to spend on crops for the next round, feeding <b>their</b> <b>people,</b> and purchasing additional land, while dealing with random variations in crop yields and plagues. The Sumer Game was possibly inspired by the 1966 The Sumerian Game, a much more in-depth text-based economic simulation intended for children.|$|E
5|$|In theses 67–80, Luther {{discusses}} {{further the}} problems with the way indulgences are being preached, as he had done in the letter to Archbishop Albert. The preachers have been promoting indulgences as the greatest of the graces available from the church, but they actually only promote greed. He points out that bishops have been commanded to offer reverence to indulgence preachers who enter their jurisdiction, but bishops are also charged with protecting <b>their</b> <b>people</b> from preachers who preach contrary to the pope's intention. He then attacks the belief allegedly propagated by the preachers that the indulgence could forgive one who had violated the Virgin Mary. Luther states that indulgences cannot take away the guilt of even the lightest of venial sins. He labels several other alleged statements of the indulgence preachers as blasphemy: that Saint Peter could not have granted a greater indulgence than the current one, and that the indulgence cross with the papal arms is as worthy as the cross of Christ.|$|E

5|$|Most historians {{take the}} view that Gregory {{initiated}} the mission, although exactly why remains unclear. A famous story recorded by Bede, an 8th-century monk who wrote {{a history of the}} British Church, relates that Gregory saw fair-haired Anglo-Saxon slaves from Britain in the Roman slave market and was inspired to try to convert <b>their</b> <b>people.</b> Supposedly Gregory inquired about the identity of the slaves, and was told that they were Angles from the island of Great Britain. Gregory replied that they were not Angles, but Angels. The earliest version of this story is from an anonymous Life of Gregory written at Whitby Abbey about 705. Bede, as well as the Whitby Life of Gregory, records that Gregory himself had attempted to go on a missionary journey to Britain before becoming pope. In 595 Gregory wrote to one of the papal estate managers in southern Gaul, asking that he buy English slave boys in order that they might be educated in monasteries. Some historians have seen this as a sign that Gregory was already planning the mission to Britain at that time, and that he intended to send the slaves as missionaries, although the letter is also open to other interpretations.|$|E
5|$|The Bosnian Muslims sought {{protection}} and {{independence from the}} NDH, and saw German support {{as a means to}} achieve those aims. Prominent Bosnian Muslims were friendly towards Germany, and Bosnians were generally nostalgic over the former period of Habsburg (Austro-Hungarian) rule. This push was strongly opposed by Pavelić as counter to the territorial integrity of the NDH. By November 1942, these Muslim autonomists were desperate to protect <b>their</b> <b>people</b> and wrote to Adolf Hitler asking that he annex Bosnia and Herzegovina to the Reich. While this idea did not receive Hitler's approval, possibly because {{he did not want to}} create problems for Pavelić, Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler saw this as an opportunity to create a Waffen-SS recruiting zone in the NDH to attract Bosnian Muslims. In early 1943, Hitler authorised the raising of the first SS division to be recruited from a non-Germanic people, the 13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian). The division was to be raised primarily from the Muslim population of the NDH.|$|E
