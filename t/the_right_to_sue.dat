50|$|While France, Luxembourg, Norway, the Czech Republic and Sweden also grant {{some degree}} of legal {{personality}} to business partnerships, other countries such as Belgium, Germany, Italy, Switzerland and Poland do not allow partnerships to acquire a separate legal personality, but permit partnerships <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> and be <b>sued,</b> <b>to</b> hold property, and to postpone a creditor's lawsuit against the partners until {{he or she has}} exhausted all remedies against the partnership assets.|$|R

25|$|Section 9 of the Employment Ordinance {{makes it}} clear that the fact that an {{employee}} takes part in a strike does not entitle his employer to terminate the employee's contract of employment. If a worker is dismissed for strike action, he or she would have <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> the employer for compensation. However, there is no legal entitlement to reinstatement.|$|E
25|$|In a 5–4 decision, United States v. Morrison invalidated {{the section}} of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA) of 1994 that gave victims of gender-motivated {{violence}} <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> their attackers in federal court, although program funding remains unaffected. Chief Justice Rehnquist, writing for the majority, held that Congress lacked authority, under either the Commerce Clause or the Fourteenth Amendment, to enact this section.|$|E
25|$|Davis {{significantly}} {{expanded the}} number of low-income children with state-subsidized health coverage. He signed laws to allow patients {{to get a second}} opinion if their HMO denies treatment and, in limited cases, <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue.</b> Davis signed legislation that provided HMO patients a bill of rights, including help-line to resolve disputes and independent medical review of claims. Under Davis, staff-to-patient ratios in nursing homes improved. However, Davis reneged on a campaign promise to expand low-cost healthcare to parents of needy children due to budget constraints.|$|E
50|$|In 1783, the New York {{legislature}} {{enacted the}} Trespass Act which stripped Tories {{of their property}} and privileges and gave patriots <b>the</b> legal <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> anyone who had occupied, damaged or destroyed homes they had left behind British lines during the war.|$|R

25|$|In 1993, {{amendments}} to the Malaysian constitution removed the legal immunity of the Yang di-Pertuan Agong and the rulers in their personal capacity, due to public outrage over their behaviour. A Special Court (Makhamah Khas Raja-raja) is established where civil and criminal proceedings can be made against a ruler {{with the approval of}} the Attorney General. <b>The</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> a ruler is limited to Malaysian citizens following a precedent. The Special Court also have jurisdiction where a ruler initiates legal actions against any party.|$|E
25|$|The {{amendments}} {{gave the}} General Counsel of the National Labor Relations Board discretionary power to seek injunctions against either employers or unions that violated the Act. The law made pursuit of such injunctions mandatory, rather than discretionary, {{in the case}} of secondary boycotts by unions. The amendments also established the General Counsel’s autonomy within the administrative framework of the NLRB. Congress also gave employers <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> unions for damages caused by a secondary boycott, but gave the General Counsel exclusive power to seek injunctive relief against such activities.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} months of 2013, an act was {{forwarded}} into the Hawaii legislature entitled the Steven Tyler Act (Hawaii Senate Bill 465). The act would give more privacy to public figures such as government officials and celebrities on vacation. Tyler and numerous other celebrities all lobbied for it. The legislation would give public figures <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> paparazzi for taking unwanted photographs. The bill's sponsor is Maui state legislator J. Kalani English. The bill was cleared through the Judiciary Committee on Friday, February 8, 2013. Tyler is registered as a Republican.|$|E

50|$|Following the Revolutionary War, New York's {{legislature}} {{enacted a}} series of laws that stripped Tories of their property and privilege. One such law passed by the legislature in 1783 was the Trespass Act. It gave patriots <b>the</b> legal <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> anyone who had occupied, damaged or destroyed homes they had left behind British lines during the war. This law served {{the foundation for the}} case.|$|R
25|$|While the Roosevelt {{administration}} {{waited for}} the court to return its judgment, contingency plans were made for an unfavorable ruling. Ideas circulated within the White House to narrowly exercise the government's power of sovereign immunity by withdrawing <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> the government to enforce gold clauses. Attorney General Cummings suggested the court should be immediately packed to ensure a favorable ruling. Roosevelt himself ordered the Treasury to manipulate the market {{to give the impression}} of turmoil, although Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau refused. Roosevelt also drew up executive orders to close all stock exchanges and prepared a radio address to the public.|$|E
25|$|With {{respect to}} real property, mechanic's liens are purely {{statutory}} devices {{that exist in}} every state (although in California, as noted below, they have a constitutional foundation). The reason they exist is a legislative public policy to protect contractors. More specifically, the state legislatures have determined that, due to {{the economics of the}} construction business, contractors and subcontractors need greater remedy for non-payment for their work than merely <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> on their contracts. In particular, without the mechanics' lien, subcontractors providing either labor or materials may have no effective remedy if their general contractor is not sufficiently financially responsible, because their only contractual right is with that general contractor.|$|E
25|$|Four other {{circuits}} accepted this. In Conover v. Dean Witter Reynolds, the Ninth Circuit examined White's critique at length. Judge Mary M. Schroeder looked {{beyond the}} text of the statutes to the accompanying legislative history. When Congress had overhauled the 1934 Act in 1975, the conference committee report had contained statements referring to Wilko and making it clear that the conferees did not intend to require arbitration. She reiterated the concern that arbitration did not fully safeguard the rights of an unsophisticated investor, and noted that <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> was so well established by case law that an implied cause of action was not necessary.|$|E
50|$|The Seventh Amendment {{has been}} {{interpreted}} <b>to</b> give people <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> a jury trial in many civil matters in federal court, but, seemingly contrary to {{the wording of the}} Amendment, not all. For example, lawsuits against the government, and admiralty matters, do not give rise <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> have a jury decide <b>the</b> case. <b>Rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> created by statute (versus the common law, or law created by court decision), including the ability <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> the United States Government, have jury rights created by statute and not the Seventh Amendment, according to the courts.|$|R
50|$|Property {{rights are}} rights over things {{enforceable}} against all other persons. By contrast, contractual rights are rights enforceable against particular persons. Property rights may, however, arise from a contract; {{the two systems}} of rights overlap. In relation to the sale of land, for example, two sets of legal relationships exist alongside one another: <b>the</b> contractual <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> for damages, and <b>the</b> property <b>right</b> exercisable over <b>the</b> land. More minor property rights may be created by contract, {{as in the case}} of easements, covenants, and equitable servitudes.|$|R
50|$|The Supreme Court of Austria (Oberster Gerichtshof) held in 1989 that Prostitution was a sittenwidriger Vertrag (Unconscionable contract); therefore, {{a prostitute}} had no legal {{recourse}} against a customer {{who refuses to}} pay (OGH June 28, 1989, 3 Ob 516/89). This sentence was revised in 2012 (OGH April 18, 2012, 3 Ob 45/12g), explaining that prostitution can no longer generally be considered as unconscionable because moral attitudes have changed and prostitution is regulated by local laws. In particular, prostitutes now have <b>the</b> legal <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> for payment.|$|R
25|$|Tina's {{accounts}} on {{her life}} with Ike Turner were later documented in the autobiography, I, Tina, released in 1986. In 1988, both Tina and Ike signed away their rights to have their lives dramatized in a biopic based off Tina's book. Ike Turner would later claim that he signed against his will since he was heavily addicted to crack {{at the time and}} accepted a $50,000 payment, waiving <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> the film company for their portrayal of him in the film. The film What's Love Got to Do with It helped to damage Ike's career in the 1990s. Due to the film and the book, Ike's name became synonymous with domestic violence, overshadowing his contributions to music.|$|E
25|$|On October 2, 2006, Blumenthal {{launched}} an investigation concerning a botched reconstruction {{project of the}} Interstate 84 in Waterbury and Cheshire. The original contractor for the job, L.G. DeFelice, {{went out of business}} and it was later revealed that hundreds of storm drains had been improperly installed. Blumenthal subsequently announced lawsuits against L.G. DeFelice and the Maguire Group, the engineering firm that inspected the project. United States Fidelity & Guaranty, the insurer behind the performance bond for the Interstate-84 construction, agreed to pay $17.5 million to settle the claims. Under the terms of the agreement, the state of Connecticut retained <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> L.G. DeFelice for additional funds. In 2009, the bonding company agreed to pay an additional $4.6 million settlement, bringing the total award to $22.1 million ($30,000 more than the repair costs).|$|E
25|$|One {{limitation}} of the unlawful trading provisions is {{that the cause of}} action vests solely in the liquidator or administrator, as a matter of statute, unlike for a misfeasance proceeding. While both kinds of action can be pursued concurrently, a fraudulent or wrongful trading case may not be assigned to a third party. In Re Oasis Merchandising Services Ltd the company's former directors sought to challenge a wrongful trading claim because the liquidator had sold <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> them to a specialist litigation firm, London Wall Claims. The Court of Appeal held that such an assignment contravened the old common law prohibition on champertous causes, or ones which involve a party in litigation for payment when they have no interest. The disadvantage of this approach is that liquidators or administrators may be too cautious to bring claims, when a specialist firm could bring them.|$|E
50|$|The {{chain of}} title of a {{promissory}} note {{is very important to}} every homeowner in America. The inability to show a complete {{chain of title}} and ownership of a promissory note from Lender A to Lender B to Lender C, etc. has become a major impediment in mortgage servicers ability to foreclose on properties in judicial foreclosure states and in relief of stays in Federal Bankruptcy Court. The issue of standing (in other words, the question of who has <b>the</b> legal <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue),</b> is <b>the</b> foundation of the produce-the-note strategy, which forces a lender prove that it has a legal <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue.</b>|$|R
50|$|On August 12, 2010, Oracle, which {{acquired}} Sun Microsystems in April 2009 {{and therefore}} owns <b>the</b> <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> Java, <b>sued</b> Google over claimed infringement of copyrights and patents. Oracle alleged that Google, in developing Android, knowingly, directly and repeatedly infringed Oracle's Java-related intellectual property. In May 2012, {{the jury in}} this case found that Google did not infringe on Oracle's patents, and the trial judge ruled that {{the structure of the}} Java APIs used by Google was not copyrightable. The parties agreed to zero dollars in statutory damages for 9 lines of copied code.|$|R
40|$|Expropriable {{disclosures}} {{of knowledge}} to prospective buyers {{may be necessary}} to facilitate the sale of intellectual property (IP). In principle, confidentiality agreements can protect disclosures by granting <b>the</b> seller <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> for unauthorized use. In practice, sellers often waive confidentiality rights. We provide an incomplete information explanation for the waiver of confidentiality rights that are valuable in complete information settings. Waiving sacrifices the protective value of confidentiality to gain greater buyer participation. Buyer skepticism, which reduces participation, arises endogenously from three elements: asymmetric information regarding seller IP, rent dissipation from competition for IP, and ex post costs from expropriation lawsuits. 1...|$|R
25|$|While union {{governance}} {{is founded}} upon freedom of association, {{the law requires}} basic standards democracy and accountability to ensure members are truly free in shaping their associations. Fundamentally, all unions are democratic organizations, but they divide between those where members elect delegates, who in turn choose the executive, and those where members directly elect the executive. In 1957, after the McClellan Committee of the US Senate found evidence of two rival Teamsters Union executives, Jimmy Hoffa and Dave Beck, falsifying delegate vote counts and stealing union funds, Congress passed the Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959. Under §411, every member {{has the right to}} vote, attend meetings, speak freely and organize, not have fees raised without a vote, not be deprived of <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue,</b> or be suspended unjustly. Under §431, unions should file their constitutions and bylaws with the Secretary of Labor and be accessible by members: today union constitutions are online. Under §481 elections must occur at least every 5 years, and local officers every 3 years, by secret ballot. Additionally, state law may bar union officials who have prior convictions for felonies from holding office. As a response to the Hoffa and Beck scandals, there is also an express fiduciary duty on union officers for members' money, limits on loans to executives, requirements for bonds for handling money, and up to a $10,000 fine or up to 5 years prison for embezzlement. These rules, however, restated most of what was already the law, and codified principles of governance that unions already undertook. On the other hand, under §501(b) to bring a lawsuit, a union member must first make a demand on the executive to correct wrongdoing before any claim can be made to a court, even for misapplication of funds, and potentially wait four months' time. The Supreme Court has held that union members can intervene in enforcement proceedings brought by the US Department of Labor. Federal courts may review decisions by the Department to proceed with any prosecutions. The range of rights, and the level of enforcement has meant that labor unions display significantly higher standards of accountability, with fewer scandals, than corporations or financial institutions.|$|E
500|$|In 2008, Mardas won <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> The New York Times in England, in {{relation}} to an online article which {{said he was a}} charlatan. In a story about the Maharishi, Allan Kozinn had written: [...] "Alexis Mardas, a supposed inventor and charlatan who had become a Beatles’ insider". After an appeal, Mardas won the right to continue his case of defamation against The New York Times in 2009. After The New York Times produced a witness, Sir Harold Evans, who gave evidence supporting the journalistic responsibility of the paper, Mardas said he would not pursue the case further, on condition that the paper would publicly explain that by labelling him as a charlatan, it did not mean to imply that he was a con man.|$|E

5000|$|In four U.S. states [...] {{the child}} is allowed to bring a {{wrongful}} life cause of action for such damages. In a 1982 case involving hereditary deafness, the Supreme Court of California was the first state supreme court <b>to</b> endorse <b>the</b> child's <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>sue</b> for wrongful life, {{but in the same}} decision, limited the child's recovery to special damages. This rule implies that the child can recover objectively provable economic damages, but cannot recover general damages like subjective [...] "pain and suffering"—that is, monetary compensation for the entire experience of having a disabled life versus having a healthy mind and/or body.|$|R
