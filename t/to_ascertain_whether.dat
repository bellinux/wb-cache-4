5|$|The {{following}} day, June 28, Union and Confederate soldiers clashed again {{near the}} Golding house. Jones {{suspected that the}} Federals near the house were withdrawing, and authorized Toombs to perform a reconnaissance-in-force <b>to</b> <b>ascertain</b> <b>whether</b> this was true. However, Toombs turned the reconnaissance operation into a full engagement and advanced with some of Anderson's men. Before he could be countermanded, the Confederates had already been repulsed by the VI Corps.|$|E
5|$|The Loyal Order of Moose {{was founded}} in Louisville, Kentucky, {{in the spring of}} 1888 by Dr. John Henry Wilson. Originally {{intended}} purely as a men's social club, lodges were soon founded in Cincinnati, Ohio, St. Louis, Missouri and Crawfordsville and Frankfort, Indiana. The early order was not prosperous. Dr. Wilson himself was dissatisfied and left the order of the Moose {{before the turn of the}} century. When Albert C. Stevens was compiling his Cyclopedia of Fraternities in the late 1890s, he was unable <b>to</b> <b>ascertain</b> <b>whether</b> it was still in existence.|$|E
5|$|Hogarth {{exhibited}} the painting at the Society of Artists in Spring Gardens in 1761. Although press reports – perhaps placed by Hogarth {{and his supporters}} – were enthusiastic, Sigismunda mourning over the Heart of Guiscardo was attacked by critics who marked Hogarth's attempt to emulate the drama depicted in older Italian paintings as foolhardy and ridiculous. Many critics were repulsed by the shocking contrast between the melancholy beauty of Sigismunda and the grotesquely bloody organ that she delicately touched. It was said that Hogarth placed an attendant next to the painting to note the remarks made by the viewers; changes to the painting suggest {{that he may have}} responded to these criticisms by altering his work, although it is impossible <b>to</b> <b>ascertain</b> <b>whether</b> many of the changes were made before or after the painting was exhibited.|$|E
40|$|Public {{officials}} in the human service delivery system must wrestle with complex decisions regarding utilization of agencies in the nonpublic sector to deliver publicly funded services. Data from a survey of 167 agencies in a major metropolitan area {{suggest that there are}} still substantial differences in priorities and service approaches of public and nonpublic agencies. These differences suggest that public officials may need to devote more resources <b>to</b> <b>ascertaining</b> <b>whether</b> and when public agencies should themselves deliver publicly funded services and to strengthening public monitoring of contracts in the private sector...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} an experiment of atomic spectroscopy devoted <b>to</b> <b>ascertaining</b> <b>whether</b> the {{orbital angular momentum}} (OAM) of photons has the same property of interacting with atoms ormolecules as occurs for the spin angularmomentum (SAM). In our experiment, rubidium vapors are excited by means of laser radiation with different combinations of OAM and SAM, particularly selected to inhibit or enhance the fluorescence according to the selection rules for the electric dipole transitions between the fundamental state and the first excited doublet. Our results clearly show that an electricdipole- type transition is insensitive to the OAM value, and provide an original validation of a problem long debated in theoretical works...|$|R
5|$|Medullary bone tissue (endosteally derived, ephemeral, {{mineralization}} located {{inside the}} medulla {{of the long}} bones in gravid female birds) {{has been reported in}} at least one Allosaurus specimen, a shin bone from the Cleveland-Lloyd Quarry. Today, this bone tissue is only formed in female birds that are laying eggs, as it is used to supply calcium to shells. Its presence in the Allosaurus individual has been used to establish sex and show it had reached reproductive age. However, other studies have called into question some cases of medullary bone in dinosaurs, including this Allosaurus individual. Data from extant birds suggested that the medullary bone in this Allosaurus individual may have been the result of a bone pathology instead. However, with the confirmation of medullary tissue indicating gender in a specimen of Tyrannosaurus, it may be possible <b>to</b> <b>ascertain</b> <b>whether</b> or not the Allosaurus in question was indeed female.|$|E
5|$|Octavius was {{studying}} and undergoing military training in Apollonia, Illyria, when Julius Caesar {{was killed on}} the Ides of March (15 March) 44BC. He rejected the advice of some army officers to take refuge with the troops in Macedonia and sailed to Italy <b>to</b> <b>ascertain</b> <b>whether</b> he had any potential political fortunes or security. Caesar had no living legitimate children under Roman law, and so had adopted Octavius, his grand-nephew, making him his primary heir. Mark Antony later charged that Octavian had earned his adoption by Caesar through sexual favours, though Suetonius describes Antony's accusation as political slander. After landing at Lupiae near Brundisium, Octavius learned the contents of Caesar's will, and only then did he decide to become Caesar's political heir as well as heir to two-thirds of his estate.|$|E
5|$|US {{cast members}} Kevin Clash and Marty Robinson have cast and trained the {{international}} puppeteers. At first, Muppet builder Kermit Love constructed the puppets {{for the new}} shows in the US. According to Gikow in 2009, Jim Henson's Creature Shop, overseen by Connie Peterson, has taken over puppet creation. The producers of Sisimpur, the Bangladesh co-production, created their own traditional puppets because their puppet-making craft is thousands of years old and {{an important part of}} their culture. The producers of each co-production developed and built their own sets, live-action videos, and animations in-country. After they developed, produced, and aired the new show, they conducted research <b>to</b> <b>ascertain</b> <b>whether</b> their curriculum goals were met, just as was done in the US after the first season of Sesame Street. According to producer Nadine Zylstra, they faced unusual challenges rarely experienced in the US. For example, riots and conflicts between Serbs and Albanians in 2004 delayed production of the Kosovo co-production for three months. In 2005, a nationwide strike in Bangladesh temporarily stalled production of their show.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{behavior}} of the banking sector with a view <b>to</b> <b>ascertaining</b> <b>whether</b> or not the deposit liabilities accruing from financial liberalization were efficiently applied by the sector to enhance performance. It is based on the experience of Nigeria which is a developing country that suffered severe and prolonged economic recession leading to the adoption of financial liberalization policy in 1986. The investigation yields interesting results which reveal that the effect of expansion in deposit liabilities on performanceof the banking sector was indeed positive and highly significant. It follows therefore that the banking sector efficiently utilized the expanded deposits to enhance profit and hence the policy of financial liberalization largely benefited shareholders in the banking sector...|$|R

5|$|As an {{insufficient}} number of transport aircraft were {{allocated to the}} brigade, it was only possible to transport the 3rd Parachute Battalion by air. The rest of the brigade arrived at Algiers on 12 November, with some of its stores arriving slightly later. By the evening, reconnaissance parties had travelled to the airfield at Maison Blanche, with {{the remainder of the}} brigade following on the morning of 13 November; it was quartered in Maison Blanche, Maison Carree and Rouiba. After several ambitious airborne operations were planned but then cancelled by British First Army, on 14 November it directed that a single parachute battalion would be dropped the next day near Souk el-Arba and Béja; the battalion was to contact French forces at Beja <b>to</b> <b>ascertain</b> <b>whether</b> they would remain neutral, or support the Allies; secure and guard the crossroads and airfield at Soul el Arba; and patrol eastwards to harass German forces. 1st Parachute Battalion was selected for the task, to which Hill objected. The battalion had been forced to unload the vessel carrying its supplies and equipment itself, and had also to arrange its own transportation to Maison Blanche as no drivers were provided at Algiers; when it had arrived at Maison Blanche, it had been subjected to several Luftwaffe air raids that targeted the airfield. Hill argued that as a result his men were exhausted, and he did not believe all of the battalion's equipment could be sorted out within twentyfour hours; as such he asked for the operation to be postponed for a short period, but this was denied.|$|E

In this case the applicant, a non-partisan pressure group called the World Development Movement, challenged the decision of the Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs to award a grant under the Overseas Development and Co-operation Act 1980 on the basis that it was ultra vires and a misuse of public funds. Representative standing was accorded despite the contention that, unlike Greenpeace, neither the applicant nor its members had any direct personal interest in the case, and were merely seeking to act in the interest of potential overseas aid recipients.

25|$|In total, 67 Jews and 9 Arabs were killed. Of the Jews killed, 59 {{died during}} the rioting and 8 more later succumbed to their wounds. They {{included}} a dozen women and three {{children under the age}} of five. Twenty-four of the victims were students from the Hebron yeshiva, seven of whom were American or Canadian. The bodies of 57 Jewish victims were buried in mass graves by Arabs, without regard to Jewish burial ritual. Most of the murdered Jews were of Ashkenazi descent, while 12 were Sephardi. 58 are thought to have been injured, including many women and children. One estimate put the figure at 49 seriously and 17 slightly wounded. A letter from the Jews of Hebron to the High Commissioner described cases of torture, mutilation and rape. Eighteen days after the massacre, the Jewish leadership requested that bodies be exhumed <b>to</b> <b>ascertain</b> <b>whether</b> deliberate mutilation had taken place. But after 20 bodies had been disinterred and reburied, it was decided to discontinue. The bodies had been exposed for two days before burial and it was almost impossible <b>to</b> <b>ascertain</b> <b>whether</b> or not they had been subject to mutilations after or during the massacre.
