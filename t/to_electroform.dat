2500|$|Original master discs {{are created}} by lathe-cutting: a lathe is used to cut a {{modulated}} groove into a blank record. The blank records for cutting used to be cooked up, as needed, by the cutting engineer, using what Robert K. Morrison describes as a [...] "metallic soap", containing lead litharge, ozokerite, barium sulfate, montan wax, stearin and paraffin, among other ingredients. Cut [...] "wax" [...] sound discs would {{be placed in a}} vacuum chamber and gold-sputtered to make them electrically conductive for use as mandrels in an electroforming bath, where pressing stamper parts were made. Later, the French company Pyral invented a ready-made blank disc having a thin nitro-cellulose lacquer coating (approximately 7 mils thickness on both sides) that was applied to an aluminum substrate. Lacquer cuts result in an immediately playable, or processable, master record. If vinyl pressings are wanted, the still-unplayed sound disc is used as a mandrel for electroforming nickel records that are used for manufacturing pressing stampers. The electroformed nickel records are mechanically separated from their respective mandrels. This is done with relative ease because no actual [...] "plating" [...] of the mandrel occurs in the type of electrodeposition known as electroforming, unlike with electroplating, in which the adhesion of the new phase of metal is chemical and relatively permanent. The one-molecule-thick coating of silver (that was sprayed onto the processed lacquer sound disc in order to make its surface electrically conductive) reverse-plates onto the nickel record's face. This negative impression disc (having ridges in place of grooves) is known as a nickel master, [...] "matrix" [...] or [...] "father". The [...] "father" [...] is then used as a mandrel <b>to</b> <b>electroform</b> a positive disc known as a [...] "mother". Many mothers can be grown on a single [...] "father" [...] before ridges deteriorate beyond effective use. The [...] "mothers" [...] are then used as mandrels for electroforming more negative discs known as [...] "sons". Each [...] "mother" [...] {{can be used to make}} many [...] "sons" [...] before deteriorating. The [...] "sons" [...] are then converted into [...] "stampers" [...] by center-punching a spindle hole (which was lost from the lacquer sound disc during initial electroforming of the [...] "father"), and by custom-forming the target pressing profile. This allows them to be placed in the dies of the target (make and model) record press and, by center-roughing, to facilitate the adhesion of the label, which gets stuck onto the vinyl pressing without any glue. In this way, several million vinyl discs can be produced from a single lacquer sound disc. When only a few hundred discs are required, instead of electroforming a [...] "son" [...] (for each side), the [...] "father" [...] is removed of its silver and converted into a stamper. Production by this latter method, known as the [...] "two-step process" [...] (as it does not entail creation of [...] "sons" [...] but does involve creation of [...] "mothers", which are used for test playing and kept as [...] "safeties" [...] for electroforming future [...] "sons") is limited to a few hundred vinyl pressings. The pressing count can increase if the stamper holds out and the quality of the vinyl is high. The [...] "sons" [...] made during a [...] "three-step" [...] electroforming make better stampers since they don't require silver removal (which reduces some high fidelity because of etching erasing part of the smallest groove modulations) and also because they have a stronger metal structure than [...] "fathers".|$|E
5000|$|The DMM copper {{master disc}} can be plated {{to produce the}} {{required}} number of stampers using the one-step plating process. Rather than having <b>to</b> <b>electroform</b> a master (or [...] "father"), mother and then stampers (the traditional [...] "three-step process"), the DMM copper disc serves as the 'mother". Bypassing the silvering process and two electroforming stages {{reduces the risk of}} introducing noise that can be generated in the electroforming (galvanic) process. In cases where hundreds of stampers may be required, the DMM disc is often used as a mandrel <b>to</b> <b>electroform</b> a master and mother, from which many stampers are then made.

5000|$|Although once {{produced}} {{in a wide}} range of sizes (from less than 7 in to more than 16 in in diameter) and sometimes with glass core discs, the examples most commonly encountered today are 10 , 12 or 14 in in diameter and consist of an aluminium core disc coated with black nitrocellulose lacquer, commonly but incorrectly called [...] "acetate". The term [...] "acetate" [...] derives from the material used in examples cut before 1934, when the substrate was in fact cellulose acetate. Cellulose acetate was only in use for a short while, but the name [...] "acetate" [...] for these discs persisted. Blank discs were traditionally {{produced in}} several different grades, with the best and costliest grade featuring the sturdiest core, the thickest coating and the most perfectly flawless mirror-like surfaces. These top-quality blanks were intended for cutting the master discs that, once silver-coated, would be electrodeposited with nickel in order <b>to</b> <b>electroform</b> parts used in making stampers (negative profile metal moulds) for pressing ordinary records. Lower-quality blanks were considered adequate for non-critical uses such as tests and demo discs. Lower-grade blanks were formerly made for home use by amateurs and may be very thin and flexible, may have a cardboard rather than a metal or glass base, and may have noticeably dull or slightly orange-peel-textured surfaces. In addition to the usual central spindle hole, there is traditionally at least one drive hole in the label area, meant to be engaged by a special pin that prevents the disc from slipping on the turntable during the recording process if the lathe does not have a vacuum turntable. Drive holes are often hidden by labels applied after the recording was cut, but they can usually be detected by careful inspection of the label or by holding the disc up to a light bright enough to penetrate the labels. Drive holes are no longer standard on lacquer masters, only on [...] "dubs", because the additional holes can interfere with the electroforming process and professional mastering lathes use vacuum turntables that hold the workpiece (lacquer disc) in place with suction. One pump usually provides suction for both the turntable and the chip tube that pulls away the fine string of nitrocellulose lacquer removed by the groove-cutting stylus.|$|E

40|$|This is {{a report}} about the {{development}} and the characterization of the electrochemical deposition of Permalloy in LIGA-microstructures, and about studies of the magnetic and mechanical properties of the layers obtained in this way. A sulfate electrolyte with a high metal content was prepared {{in cooperation with the}} group of Professor Liebscher at the Ilmenau Technical University and then used to characterize alloy deposition in experiments under controlled mass transfer conditions at the rotating disk electrode; the composition of the layers obtained was studied. In principle, two different ranges of current density were found for alloy deposition. At higher current densities, the composition of the alloy depends on the conditions of the mass transfer to the cathode (i. e. diffusion control of iron deposition). At lower current densities, it appears to be impossible to influence the composition of the alloy by mass transfer. In this case, control by the charge transfer reactions of iron and nickel and their mutual influences can be assumed to prevail. As the thickness of the diffusion layer increases, the change to diffusion control begins at increasingly lower current densities. A flow cell was used <b>to</b> <b>electroform</b> iron-nickel microstructures. Limiting current densities were measured in order to compare the conditions of mass transfer at the rotating disk electrode and at the microstructure used, respectively. The magnetic properties of the Permalloy deposited, and of the nickel deposited from sulfamate electrolyte, were determined. In addition, two models for the codeposition from iron-nickel taken fron the literature were incorporated into an FEM simulation program also existing in the literature. The model by Hessami and Tobias provide a good simulation of the author's measurements at the rotating disk electrode. It was also possible to simulate, by modification of the simulation of the mass transfer, the height profiles measured in microstructures.

40|$|Resistive Random Access Memory (ReRAM) {{technology}} is a promising candidate for future non-volatile, highly scalable and energy efficient data storage concepts. A typical ReRAM cell consists of a transition metal oxide sandwiched between two metallic electrodes in a metal-insulator-metal (MIM) cell, and can be fabricated into conceptually simple crossbar arrays suitable for high integration densities. The high switching speeds, large resistance windows, high endurance, low energy demand and good scalability highlights ReRAM as a potential replacement of FLASH memories below the 10 nm node, and utilization as a "universal" memory is also theoretically possible. However, a major obstacle to be overcome for the commercialization of ReRAM is the elucidation and detailed understanding of the switching mechanism, which is still not completely clear despite increasing scientific interest {{in the field in}} the last decade. The focus of this thesis is therefore the investigation of ReRAM cells fabricated from Fe-doped SrTiO 3 thin films by advanced spectroscopy, in order to gain more information about the physical and chemical state of the material before and after electrical treatment. For many ReRAM systems, an initial DC voltage treatment is necessary <b>to</b> <b>electroform</b> the cell. The chemical and structural changes induced locally by this treatment are analyzed with spatially resolved spectroscopy, and a mapping of the oxygen vacancy distribution in a switched cell yields some insights into the mechanism of electroforming and the defect structure of the conducting filament. In addition, evidence for voltage-induced redox-reactions and chemical decomposition at the nanometer-scale can be observed with chemically sensitive electron spectromicroscopy. The necessity of a dedicated DC electroforming step is removed when the thickness of the SrTiO 3 film is scaled down, or the film is pre-reduced through a reactive electrode. Electron spectroscopy shows that the latter is due to a redox-reaction at the metal-insulator interface, reducing the SrTiO 3 and partially oxidizing the electrode. In this way, the need for electrical forming is removed through a chemical reduction. Thin films that do not require DC-forming show desirable properties such as high reliability and continuously tunable resistance. With temperature-dependent current-voltage characteristics and photoemission data obtained on large arrays of switched MIM cells, a switching model for these films is suggested based on the modulation of the width of a tunneling barrier located at the top electrode interface. The asymmetric barrier is modified by the movement of oxygen vacancies under applied bias, creating a vacancy-depleted region of variable thickness near the top electrode that acts as the tunneling barrier...|$|E
40|$|Electroforming {{is a very}} {{fascinating}} {{technique in}} metalsmithing. Through this project I want {{to learn how to}} use electroforming to create an organic shape and effect. Many artists often think the nodules resulting from the electroforming are very annoying, and ugly. I think they are very beautiful. Through this research, I want to learn how to manipulate the process of electroforming to turn something considered ugly into something beautiful. I was inspired by the jelly fish when I was looking for ideas for this project. The form of the jellyfish is very simple, but also complicated. Initially, I learned and tested how nodules grow when electroforming. Some materials are not qualified for the electroform tank, such as any kinds of organic matter. This has limited the material I can choose from. After experimenting, I found that ceramic is a perfect object which will not react with the chemical in the solution. I made a white jelly fish as the ceramic base. I was planning <b>to</b> <b>electroform</b> the legs of the jellyfish, but discovered the deep gap between the jelly fish tentacles affects how copper develops on the ceramic base. It is harder to lay down copper when the gap is deep or narrow. To work with this challenge, I decided to use copper wire for some of the legs, and use ceramic to make the other legs, creating a more diverse form. The ceramic legs were larger and more interesting shape. The copper wire was easier to manipulate into the desired form. The legs were attached the body by plastic and resin. I electroformed the top with plastic to create a textured surface. To create the glowing effect, I added some LED string light on the inner surface. The finished product will hang from a higher level so people can see the jellyfish from different angles. From the process of learning electroforming on ceramic, I learned many techniques. First, having a high electrical voltage can burn the copper, but it can also grow beautiful nodules. It is important to have good control of the amount of voltage that is going through the copper. Second, the gap on the object can be tricky. The deeper and narrower the gap is, the harder it is for copper to lay on. Third, choosing the material can affect the result of the copper growing. Not only the material itself will affect the process, but so will the surface. It is easier for the the copper to grow the nodules on the textured area than on the smoother area. Last, I want to continue to work with electroforming on other material to create more different effects. I would like to use electroforming as painting on metal or other materials in the future...|$|E

30|$|The volume {{expansion}} of SU- 8 resist brings serious dimensional errors <b>to</b> <b>electroformed</b> structures. Two approaches {{have been proposed}} to reduce resist distortions during electroforming: electroforming at room temperature and adding auxiliary features for mask patterns. However, the former method induces higher internal stresses in the electroformed metal layers. And the latter method {{makes it difficult to}} predict the expansion behaviors of the resists. In the paper, the thermal expansion of the SU- 8 mould is calculated by ANSYS firstly, and the lower thermal expansion value indicates that hygroscopic swelling plays a leading role in SU- 8 mould distortions. An original technique is presented to reduce SU- 8 hygroscopic swelling by ultrasonic treatment. The dimensional errors of the electroformed structure fabricated on the ultrasonic treatment mould are 50 % lower than the one without ultrasonic treatment. Simulation of hygroscopic swelling is conducted by finite element analysis, and the results indicate that the hygroscopic strain ε of SU- 8 after electroforming is declined from 6.8 % to 3.1 % because of ultrasonic. The measurements show that ultrasonic treatment increased the water contact angle of cured SU- 8 from 70.8 ° to 74.9 °. Based on these results, the mechanism of ultrasonic effect on hygroscopic swelling is proposed from the view of ultrasonic vibration decreasing the number of hydroxyl groups in SU- 8. The research presents a novel method to improve the precisions of electroformed structures. It has no influence on the internal stresses of final structures and does not increase the complexities of mask layouts.|$|R

5000|$|The {{glass master}} is rotated in the {{electroforming}} tank while a pump circulates the electroforming solution {{over the surface}} of the master. As the electroforming progresses, nickel is not electroplated onto the surface of the glass master, since that would preclude separation. Plating is rather eschewed through passivation and, initially, because the glass is not electroconductive. Instead, the metal coating on the glass disc, actually reverse-plates onto the nickel (not the mandrel) which is being electrodeposited by the attraction of the electrons on the cathode, which presents itself as the metal-coated glass mistress, or, premaster mandrel. Electroplating, on the other hand, would have entailed electrodepostion directly to the mandrel along with the intention of it staying adhered. That, and the more rigorous requirements of temperature control and purity of bathwater, are the main differences between the two disciplines of electrodeposition (invented by Luigi Brugnatelli and often credited to another Luigi - Sr. Galvani). The metal stamper first struck from the metal-coated glass is the metal master (and we shouldn't make a master from another master as that would not follow the nomenclature of the sequence of siring that is germane <b>to</b> <b>electroforming)</b> This is clearly a method opposite to normal electroplating. Another difference to electroplating is that the internal stress of the nickel must be controlled carefully, or the nickel stamper will not be flat. The solution cleanliness is important but is achieved by continuous filtration and usual anode bagging systems. Another large difference is that the stamper thickness must be controlled to ±2% of the final thickness so that it will fit on the injection moulding machines with very high tolerances of gassing rings and centre clamps. This thickness control requires electronic current control and baffles in the solution to control distribution ...|$|R
40|$|The {{first step}} in the {{fabrication}} of microstructure using deep x-ray lithography (DXRL) is the irradiation of a x-ray sensitive resist like polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA) by hard x-rays. At the Advanced Photon Source, a dedicated beamline allows the proper exposure of very thick (several mm) resists. <b>To</b> fabricate <b>electroformed</b> metal microstructure with heights of several mm, a PMMA sheet is glued onto a metallic plating base. An important requirement is that the PMMA layer must adhere well to the plating base. The adhesion is greatly reduced by the penetration of even a small fraction of hard x-rays through the mask absorber into the substrate. In this work we will show a novel technique to improve the adhesion of PMMA onto high-Z substrates for DXRL. Results of the improved adhesion are shown for different exposure/substrate conditions...|$|R
40|$|More panels {{electroformed}} with intentional {{variations of}} pulse plating parameters are being made. Pulse plating frequency was noted {{to have a}} significant effect regarding mechanical properties. The use of a high pulse frequency (assuming fixed duty cycles) results in an increase in ductility and a decrease in ultimate and yield strengths. <b>Electroforming</b> <b>to</b> intermediate frequencies is being done to obtain the best possible combination of ductility and strength. Results of some tests from high frequency specimens are tabulated...|$|R
50|$|MacDonald Reid {{was born}} in Winnipeg in 1907. He {{developed}} {{a new approach to}} portrait sculpture using photography, a revolving dentist’s chair, and a machine he built himself that outlined the contours of the human face, for which he was awarded the US patent. This speeded up {{the early stages of the}} sculpting process, which he then rendered into an exact likeness using traditional artistic skills. He used <b>electroforming</b> <b>to</b> cut the price of bronze sculptures.|$|R
50|$|When Schwarcz {{moved to}} La Jolla later that year, she showed with the Allied Craftsmen of San Diego and {{received}} her first solo {{exhibition at the}} La Jolla Art Center (1957). That same year she returned to Sausalito. Beginning in 1962, Schwarcz used electroplating and <b>electroforming</b> <b>to</b> create more dramatic textures and varied shapes. Her innovative use of copper foil and mesh, which she started using in 1964, enables her to fold, cut, gather, and stitch to create unique, dynamic forms.|$|R
