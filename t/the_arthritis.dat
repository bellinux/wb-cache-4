25|$|A {{number of}} {{physicians}} {{have suggested that}} the eponym is undeserved. Dr. Reiter's Nazi Party affiliation, and in particular his involvement in forced human experimentation in the Buchenwald concentration camp (which, after his capture at the end of World War II, resulted in his prosecution in Nuremberg as a war criminal), have come to overshadow his medical accomplishments. Furthermore, he was not the first physician to make associations between <b>the</b> <b>arthritis</b> and other symptoms: the terms arthritis urethritica, venereal arthritis and polyarteritis enterica had previously been applied, and the full triad was described by another physician in the nineteenth century.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} joint {{inflammation}} on bone marrow and periarticular bone were studied in mice using antigen-induced arthritis and zymosan-induced arthritis {{as models for}} an immune and a non-immune-mediated chronic inflammation. To allow for {{a comparison of the}} two types of arthritis care was taken to induce comparable degrees of inflammation as evaluated with 99 mTechnetium uptake and histology. <b>The</b> antigen-induced <b>arthritis</b> caused a significant suppression of the mitotic activity in the bone marrow close to the inflammatory focus during the first days of <b>arthritis.</b> <b>The</b> zymosan-induced <b>arthritis</b> did not produce alterations of the bone marrow activity. Both types of arthritis were able to induce long-lasting and irreversible damage to cartilaginous and bony structures. Apposition of bone was observed in both types of arthritis although much earlier in <b>the</b> antigen-induced <b>arthritis.</b> <b>The</b> apposition of bone was found to emerge largely from the periosteum and not from the epiphyseal plates, as shown by 125 I-deoxyuridine autoradiography.

500|$|Purpura, {{arthritis}} and abdominal pain {{are known as}} the [...] "classic triad" [...] of Henoch–Schönlein purpura. Purpura occur in all cases, joint pains and arthritis in 80%, and abdominal pain in 62%. Some include gastrointestinal hemorrhage as a fourth criterion; this occurs in 33% of cases, sometimes, but not necessarily always, due to intussusception. The purpura typically appear on the legs and buttocks, but may also {{be seen on the}} arms, face and trunk. The abdominal pain is colicky in character, and may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, constipation or diarrhea. There may be blood or mucus in the stools. The joints involved tend to be the ankles, knees, and elbows, but arthritis in the hands and feet is possible; <b>the</b> <b>arthritis</b> is nonerosive and hence causes no permanent deformity. Forty percent have evidence of kidney involvement, mainly in the form of hematuria (blood in the urine), but only a quarter will have this in sufficient quantities to be noticeable without laboratory tests.
