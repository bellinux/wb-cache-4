5|$|At , the 21-story Milam Building in {{downtown}} San Antonio, Texas was the tallest brick and reinforced concrete {{structure in the}} United States {{when it opened in}} 1928, as well as the first high-rise air-conditioned office building. The building was designed by George Willis, engineered by M.L. Diver, and constructed by L.T. Wright and Company. The building was named in honor of the Republic of Texas historical figure Benjamin Milam, noted for his leadership during the Texas Revolution. In keeping with that motif, the only flag <b>that</b> <b>flies</b> atop the tower is the Lone Star flag.|$|E
5|$|Traditional series {{items such}} as Bombs used for {{demolition}} and the Bow and Arrow for ranged attacks are available as Link progresses through the game, along with new additions such as a mechanical Beetle <b>that</b> <b>flies</b> to areas beyond Link's reach {{for a variety of}} actions including activating switches; and a whip for grabbing otherwise-unreachable objects and levers. Link's shield takes damage when blocking attacks fail, and may eventually break. Items and equipment can also be optionally upgraded using materials gathered from defeated monsters and within each overworld environment, making them stronger and more durable. In addition to consuming resources, Link must also pay for the upgrade with Rupees, the game's currency which is scattered throughout the world.|$|E

500|$|An {{alternative}} derivation {{proposes that}} the term fly- refers not to insects as such but rather the delirium resulting from consumption of the fungus. This {{is based on the}} medieval belief <b>that</b> <b>flies</b> could enter a person's head and cause mental illness. Several regional names appear to be linked with this connotation, meaning the [...] "mad" [...] or [...] "fool's" [...] version of the highly regarded edible mushroom Amanita caesarea. Hence there is [...] "mad oriol" [...] in Catalan, mujolo folo from Toulouse, [...] from the Aveyron department in Southern France, [...] from Trentino in Italy. A local dialect name in Fribourg in Switzerland is tsapi de diablhou, which translates as [...] "Devil's hat".|$|E

500|$|In other cases, errors {{may have}} been wrongly {{attributed}} to Aristotle. Katrin Weigmann wrote [...] " [...] statement <b>that</b> <b>flies</b> have four legs was repeated in natural history texts {{for more than a}} thousand years despite the fact that a little counting would have proven otherwise." [...] However, the historian and philosopher of biology John S. Wilkins notes that Aristotle did not say [...] "all flies have four legs"; he wrote that one particular animal, the ephemeron or mayfly, [...] "moves with four feet and four wings: and, I may observe in passing, this creature is exceptional not only in regard to the duration of its existence, whence it receives its name, but also because though a quadruped it has wings also." [...] Mayflies do in fact walk on four legs, the front pair not being adapted for walking, so, Wilkins concludes, Aristotle was correct.|$|E
500|$|Focusing on {{the quality}} of the poem, Stuart Sperry, argued in 1973, [...] "'Ode to a Nightingale' is the supreme {{expression}} in all Keats's poetry of the impulse to imaginative escape <b>that</b> <b>flies</b> in the face of the knowledge of human limitation, the impulse fully expressed in 'Away! away! for I will fly to thee.'" [...] Wolf Hirst, in 1981, described the poem as [...] "justly celebrated" [...] and claimed that [...] "Since this movement into an eternal realm of song is one of the most magnificent in literature, the poet's return to actuality is all the more shattering." [...] Helen Vendler continued the earlier view that the poem was artificial but added that the poem was an attempt to be aesthetic and spontaneous that was later dropped. In 1983, she argued, [...] "In its absence of conclusiveness and its abandonment to reverie, the poem appeals to readers who prize it as the most personal, the most apparently spontaneous, the most immediately beautiful, and the most confessional of Keats's odes. I believe that the 'events' of the ode, as it unfolds in time, have more logic, however, than is usually granted them, and that they are best seen in relation to Keats's pursuit of the idea of music as a nonrepresentational art." ...|$|E

As the plane is brought down, [...] "pieces of wreckage catch fire and burn as they fall to earth. There is also a smaller plane <b>that</b> <b>flies</b> through the airborne debris. It’s a very complex sequence, combining CG, effects simulations and pyrotechnics." [...] Series visual effects supervisor Mark Kolpack elaborated that [...] "Doing fire realistically on television is a tall order. You don’t get the representation of what a real fire element looks like using software, but the guys at FuseFX, those FX animators are amazing. It takes a long time and a lot of set up to get things right.

Nicole James of Fuse called the song a [...] "sexed-up midtempo banger". Jem Aswad of the same publication noted {{the presence of a}} [...] "wild, jazzy, Joni-ish melody <b>that</b> <b>flies</b> all over the scale". Jordan Runtagh from the website VH1 called [...] "No Angel" [...] a [...] "classic fake-out love song" [...] and connected to the singer's real-life relationship with husband Jay-Z. A more mixed review came from Ryan E.C. Hamm from Under the Radar who noted that the experimentalistic songs on Beyoncé which do not work well, managed to look better only because of the record itself; he examplified this with [...] "No Angel", criticizing it as [...] "a little boring". Both Christopher R. Weingarten of Spin and Tom Breihan of Stereogum called the song [...] "boring"; the latter added it would be that way for listeners [...] "until that subtle digital bassline finds its way into your head". Breihan, however, praised the singer's falsetto vocals as [...] "a thing to behold". Melissa Locker of Time magazine stated that the singer sang [...] "slightly obnoxiously" [...] in [...] "No Angel". Una Mullally from The Irish Times questioned how [...] "No Angel" [...] was included in the track listing of Beyoncé, before adding [...] "but it did and we're {{just going to have to}} deal with it". However, she concluded that the song should be listened several more times to be understood.|$|E
500|$|Benedict de Spinoza in his Ethics, {{published}} {{after his}} death in 1677, argued that most people, even those that consider themselves to exercise free will, make moral decisions on the basis of imperfect sensory information, inadequate understanding of their mind and will, as well as emotions which are both outcomes of their contingent physical existence and forms of thought defective from being chiefly impelled by self-preservation. The solution, according to Spinoza, was to gradually increase the capacity of our reason to change the forms of thought produced by emotions and {{to fall in love with}} viewing problems requiring moral decision from the perspective of eternity. Thus, living a life of peaceful conscience means to Spinoza that reason is used to generate adequate ideas where the mind increasingly sees the world and its conflicts, our desires and passions sub specie aeternitatis, that is without reference to time. Hegel's obscure and mystical Philosophy of Mind held that the absolute right of freedom of conscience facilitates human understanding of an all-embracing unity, an absolute which was rational, real and true. Nevertheless, Hegel thought that a functioning State would always be tempted not to recognize conscience in its form of subjective knowledge, just as similar non-objective opinions are generally rejected in science. A similar idealist notion was expressed in the writings of Joseph Butler who argued that conscience is God-given, should always be obeyed, is intuitive, and should be considered the [...] "constitutional monarch" [...] and the [...] "universal moral faculty": [...] "conscience does not only offer itself to show us the way we should walk in, but it likewise carries its own authority with it." [...] Butler advanced ethical speculation by referring to a duality of regulative principles in human nature: first,"self-love" [...] (seeking individual happiness) and second, [...] "benevolence" [...] (compassion and seeking good for another) in conscience (also linked to the agape of situational ethics). Conscience tended to be more authoritative in questions of moral judgment, thought Butler, because it was more likely to be clear and certain (whereas calculations of self-interest tended to probable and changing conclusions). John Selden in his Table Talk expressed the view that an awake but excessively scrupulous or ill-trained conscience could hinder resolve and practical action; it being [...] "like a horse that is not well wayed, he starts at every bird <b>that</b> <b>flies</b> out of the hedge".|$|E
