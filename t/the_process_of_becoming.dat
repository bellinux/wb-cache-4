5|$|Alberto {{produced}} {{winds of}} tropical storm force along the South Carolina coastline; the highest official wind gust was 51mph (82km/h) at Edisto Beach. The storm dropped precipitation {{across much of}} the state, including a state maximum of 4.42inches (112mm) at Pritchardville. Storm tides reached 7.81feet (2.4m) above the mean low-level water mark along Fripp Island, leading to some beach erosion along portions of the coastline. While in <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>becoming</b> extratropical, the rainbands of Alberto spawned seven confirmed tornadoes in the state, most of which rated F0; a National Weather Service report indicated additional tornadoes may have occurred in the state. The tornadoes caused some minor damage, though overall damage in the state was minimal.|$|E

5|$|In {{an attempt}} to prevent the game losing players to {{counties}} or other commitments such as jobs, {{it was suggested that}} central contracts should be introduced. This was done in June 2009, with the first two going to Trent Johnston and Alex Cusack. The number of full-time contracts was expanded to six in January 2010 with support for a further nine players; the contracts were split into three categories. In January 2012 the number of contracts was increased to 23, and coach Phil Simmons highlighted <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>becoming</b> professional as an important factor in the team's success.|$|E

40|$|Critical {{responses}} to Wide Sargasso Sea have seized upon Rhys’s novel as an exemplary model of writing back.

Elaborating <b>the</b> <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>becoming</b> that Deleuze’s third synthesis depicts, Antoinette’s fate emerges not as a violence against an original identity. Rather, what the reader witnesses is a series <b>of</b> <b>becomings</b> or masks, some of which are validated, some of which are not, and it is in the rejection of certain masks, forcing Antoinette to become-Bertha, that the greatest violence lies...|$|R

40|$|In recent decades, {{socialization}} research {{appears to}} have suffered the loss of its former capacity to explain <b>the</b> <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>becoming</b> a socialized subject in a social environment. In this article, I review socialization theories taking into account assumptions regarding human subjects and their social environments. I confront them {{with the idea of}} rethinking dualisms, ontologies, and agencies addressed by the field of new materialism. I propose a new materialist-inspired socialization theory that assumes that humans, knowledge, and material environments become inseparable parts <b>of</b> (gendered) socialization <b>processes</b> in a world of constant change. This approach contributes to socialization theory and methodology because it illustrates precisely how humans and non-humans coproduce socialization in situated material-discursive processes...|$|R

25|$|Samkhya school {{suggests}} that jnana (knowledge) is a sufficient means to moksha, Patanjali {{suggests that}} systematic techniques/practice (personal experimentation) combined with Samkhya's approach to knowledge is {{the path to}} moksha.

Liberation, like many other schools, is removal of ignorance, which is achieved through discriminative discernment, knowledge and self-awareness. The Yoga Sūtras is Yoga school's treatise on how to accomplish this. Samādhi is the state where ecstatic awareness develops, state Yoga scholars, and this is how one starts <b>the</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> <b>becoming</b> aware of Purusa and true Self.

40|$|The need to {{transform}} {{higher education in}} South Africa is indisputable. This article explores how the recent #mustfall protests, as an Event, could inform transformation. An Event follows three phases: reframing (shattering the frame through which we understand reality), the fall (the loss of a primordial unity which is a retroactive illusion) and enlightenment (subjectivity itself as an eventuality). In conclusion, I pose that a shift towards who comes into presence in higher education and not (a pre-determined) what comes into presence, could provide possible footpaths to decolonialisation and transformation. Through <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> subjectification, <b>the</b> subject(s) of higher education could reframe historic ontological othering and actively take part in <b>the</b> <b>process(es)</b> <b>of</b> <b>becoming</b> and being human in higher education in (post) colonial South Africa...|$|R
