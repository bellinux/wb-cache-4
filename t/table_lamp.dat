500|$|Closing Times art was {{designed}} by Cal Schenkel. Schenkel's front cover art was inspired by [...] "Waits' own idea of how the album should sound." [...] It depicts Waits leaning against a bar-room piano which is furnished with a shot of rye, a bottle of beer, cigarettes, an ashtray and a small candle with a blue pool <b>table</b> <b>lamp</b> above Waits' head. The back cover art is minimal and only features a photograph of Waits staring directly into the camera, reputedly taken after one of Waits' performance at The Troubadour. Both photographs were taken by Ed Caraeff.|$|E

2500|$|Some CFLs {{are labeled}} {{not to be}} run base up, since heat will shorten the ballast's life. Such CFLs are {{unsuitable}} for use in pendant lamps and especially unsuitable for recessed light fixtures. CFLs designed for use in such fixtures are available. Current recommendations for fully enclosed, unventilated light fixtures (such as those recessed into insulated ceilings), are either to use [...] "reflector CFLs" [...] (R-CFL), cold-cathode CFLs or to replace such fixtures with those designed for CFLs. A CFL will thrive in areas that have good airflow, such as in a <b>table</b> <b>lamp.</b>|$|E

2500|$|<b>Table</b> <b>lamp</b> wire is {{typically}} #18, while extension cords are #16, with #14 common on cords grounded for outdoor use, and #12 available. [...] Mini Christmas lights were mostly #24 through 1997, when that gauge was arbitrarily de-rated from 3 to 2.5 amps, preventing manufacturers from getting UL certification {{for the same}} products which had already been approved {{for more than two}} decades. [...] They were forced to use the formerly heavy-duty standard of #22 wire (itself de-rated from 5 to 4 amps), plus thicker insulation, which in turn caused them to shortchange customers by drastically shortening the light socket spacing and usable length of sets. [...] This change also made light strings stiff and unsightly. [...] Heavy-duty mini lights are now 20 AWG, with larger screw-in bulbs having sockets on 18 AWG lamp wire.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{appliances}} {{sold in the}} Soviet Union had a flat unearthed plug with {{an additional}} pass-through socket on the top, allowing a stacked arrangement of plugs. This design was very useful, because the usual Soviet apartment of the 1960s had very few sockets, but somewhat unsafe; [...] the brass cylinders of the secondary socket were uncovered at the ends (to {{allow them to be}} unscrewed easily), recessed by only 3mm, and provided bad contact because they relied on the secondary plug's bisected expanding pins. The pins of the secondary plug (which lacked insulation sleeves) could not be inserted into the cylindrical sockets completely, leaving a 5mm gap between the primary and secondary plugs. The adaptors were mostly used for low power appliances (for example, connecting both a <b>table</b> <b>lamp</b> and a radio to a socket).|$|E
2500|$|With {{this level}} of attention, some special design objects from the era have become sought-after {{collectors}} items also at auction, sometimes due to their association with the commission or commissioner, or the product designer. For example, a painted glass and metal <b>table</b> <b>lamp</b> by Bradley and Hubbard, (c. 1920) sold for USD$14,950, doubling its estimate, at Christie's auction house in New York in 1999. Later, a 14-inch, International Silver Company cocktail shaker (c. 1927) sold for USD$21,600 tripling its estimate, at Christie's in New York in 2005. A Parker gun made for a Russian czar before World War I, but never delivered, {{was reported to have}} been sold for USD$287,500 in 2007. In 2008, a rare Handel lamp sold for USD$85,000. On March 5–6, 2014 at Sotheby's in London, [...] "Al Capone's cocktail shaker" [...] made by the Meriden International Sterling Company (c. 1932) achieved over 33 times its estimate with a sale price of GBP50,000 (USD$83,250 on the day). Lastly, in 2014, at Sotheby's New York, a rare Paul Lobel-designed coffee service (c. 1934–35) produced by the Wilcox Silver Plate Co. / International Silver Company sold for USD$377,000.|$|E
