5|$|Critics of the ESRB have {{asserted}} that the organization has {{a conflict of interest}} because of its vested interest in the video game industry, and that the ESRB does not rate certain games, such as the Grand Theft Auto series, harshly enough for their violent or sexual content in order to protect their commercial viability. Contrarily, other critics have argued <b>that,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time, the ESRB rates certain games too strongly for their content, and that its influence has stifled the viability of adult-oriented video games due to the board's restrictions on how they are marketed and sold.|$|E

In the process, Whelan used the business {{to set up a}} new venture, DWSportsfitness and announced that the stadium name would change to the DW Stadium in August. Whelan also announced <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time the stadium was renamed, its ownership would pass from himself to Wigan Athletic. Concerns about the future of Wigan Warriors were arrested in the same announcement, as Whelan extended the lease on the stadium by 50 years for the rugby league team. Before their match against Leeds Rhinos in July 2009, both clubs were given the opportunity to rename one stand, with the intention of renaming them in honour to a recognised player from each club's history. The rugby league club were granted the East Stand, which they renamed 'The Boston Stand' in tribute to the Welsh winger Billy Boston, As Wigan Athletic had spent many years in the lower leagues it was recognised that most of their players were not known, so the West Stand was renamed 'The Springfield Stand' after the club's former ground.|$|E

Macau received an influx of African slaves, Japanese slaves as well as Christian Korean slaves who were bought by the Portuguese from the Japanese after they were taken prisoner during the Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98) in the era of Hideyoshi.|$|E

Amnesty International considers the policies and practices of the People's Republic as failing to meet that principle, and urged the IOC to press China to immediately enact human rights reform.|$|E
25|$|Theoretical {{predictions}} of buckyball molecules {{appeared in the}} late 1960s– early 1970s, but they went largely unnoticed. In the early 1970s, the chemistry of unsaturated carbon configurations was studied by a group at the University of Sussex, led by Harry Kroto and David Walton. In the 1980s a technique was developed by Richard Smalley and Robert Curl at Rice University, Texas to isolate these substances. They used laser vaporization of a suitable target to produce clusters of atoms. Kroto realized that by using a graphite target, any carbon chains formed could be studied. Another interesting fact is <b>that,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time, astrophysicists were working along with spectroscopists to study infrared emissions from giant red carbon stars.+ and other polyhedral carbon ions |last2=d'Hendecourt |first2=L. |last3=Verstraete |first3=L. |last4=Schmidt |first4=W. |journal=Astron.

Hence, the inspiration came to Smalley and team to use the laser technique on graphite to create the first fullerene molecule.|$|E

500|$|A {{controversy}} existed {{over whether}} or not Pickett was relieved of his command {{in the final days of}} the war. After the war, Lee's Chief of Staff, Lieutenant Colonel Walter H.

Anderson and Bushrod Johnson, whose forces had been lost in the battle and who thereby no longer had troops under their command. [...] In fact, Anderson had returned to his home in South Carolina following the battle. In addition, Taylor recollected that he had issued an order relieving Pickett as well. Pickett's division was still intact, though reduced in number to about the size of a brigade. No copies of these orders exist. Douglas Southall Freeman, a biographer of Lee, supported this assertion, writing in 1935 <b>that</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time Lee relieved Anderson of command, he took the same action regarding Pickett and Bushrod Johnson, but the order regarding Pickett apparently never reached him.

500|$|Apart from a {{revision}} of the map of Europe in 1572 {{there would be no}} more large wall maps and Mercator began to address the other tasks that he had outlined in the Cosmographia.

That he should wish to do so may seem strange given <b>that,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> time, he was planning very different modern maps and other mapmakers, such as his friend Abraham Ortelius, had forsaken Ptolemy completely. It was essentially an act of reverence by one scholar for another, a final epitaph for the Ptolemy who had inspired Mercator's love of geography early in his life. He compared the great many editions of the Ptolemy's written Geographia, which described his two projections and listed the latitude and longitude of some 8000 places, as well as the many different versions of the printed maps which had appeared over the previous one hundred years, all with errors and accretions. Once again, this self-imposed diligence delayed publication and the 28 maps of Ptolemy appeared in 1578, after an interval almost ten years.

The National Coalition's Katainen said that as a result of February polling there were now four prime ministerial candidates from the four largest parties. However, the True Finns' chairman and MEP Timo Soini was excluded because the various pollings presented at the time were different. All parties insisted that the retirement age must not be lowered from 63. The SDP's Urpilainen said that the party would continue with what they said was a need to cut pensions and that increasing the retirement age is a form of cutting pensions; to support this she pointed out an earlier retirement age law of 65 years and that the age had been lowered. She also added that because of a large proportion of disabled pensioners, younger people should join the workforce quickly after graduation. Katainen and the Centre Party's Kiviniemi said they would consider raising the retirement age to lengthen work careers.
