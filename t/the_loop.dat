5|$|On March 16, 2009, the new South Ferry station opened, {{replacing}} the original loop station. <b>The</b> <b>loop</b> station could only accommodate {{the first five}} cars of a train and required the use of gap fillers because of the sharpness of <b>the</b> <b>loop</b> curve. The new station was built as a two-track, full (10-car)-length island platform on a less severe curve, permitting the operation of a typical terminal station. The newer station {{does not have a}} connection to the IRT Lexington Avenue Line, and is underneath <b>the</b> <b>loop</b> station. The MTA claimed that the new station saved four to six minutes of a passenger's trip time and increased the peak capacity of the 1 service to 24 trains per hour, as opposed to 16 to 17 trains per hour with <b>the</b> <b>loop</b> station. This was the first new station to open since 1989 when the IND 63rd Street Line stations opened.|$|E
5|$|After the {{governor}} and his department decided that the state could do without the $3.8million (1978USD) that the toll would produce each year, a bill permitting the state to take over <b>the</b> <b>Loop</b> Parkway was passed on March31, 1978. The removal of the tolls helped Governor Carey gain enough support to pass that year's state budget. The decision to eliminate <b>the</b> <b>Loop</b> Parkway tolls was influenced by Long Beach Supervisor Hannah Komanoff, who also unsuccessfully fought to have the tollbooth on the Atlantic Beach Bridge removed in 1979.|$|E
5|$|An {{infinite}} loop may occur if the exit conditions for <b>the</b> <b>loop</b> are not defined correctly. Once L exceeds R, the search has failed and must convey {{the failure of}} the search. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>loop</b> must be exited when the target element is found, {{or in the case of}} an implementation where this check is moved to the end, checks for whether the search was successful or failed at the end must be in place. Bentley found that, in his assignment of binary search, most of the programmers who implemented binary search incorrectly made an error defining the exit conditions.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Loop</b> Parkway {{begins at}} an {{at-grade}} intersection with Lido Boulevard {{on the eastern}} end of Long Beach Barrier Island in the neighborhood of Point Lookout. It proceeds north as a four-lane divided highway, crossing over Reynolds Channel to reach Alder Island, one of several islands comprising Jones Beach State Park. Here, the road slowly bends eastward as it runs across the marshy island. Two U-turn ramps are built into the median near the western end of the island, serving as the only intersections or interchanges of any kind on Alder Island. <b>The</b> <b>Loop</b> Parkway heads east from Alder Island, traversing Long Creek on a drawbridge leading to Meadow Island. The road quickly continues northeast across the island with no connections via interchanges or intersections.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>loop</b> itself still exists, {{although}} it was penetrated by a bomb and flooded during the Blitz in the Second World War. Fortunately, <b>the</b> <b>loop</b> had been sealed off years before. In September 1938, during the Sudeten Crisis, when war appeared imminent, the Bakerloo and Northern line tunnels at Embankment were temporarily sealed with concrete to protect against flooding through bombing. The blockage was removed after {{little more than a}} week once the crisis had passed. At the outbreak of World War II in September 1939, the tunnels were blocked again until electrically powered emergency doors could be installed in the tunnel mouths. The tunnels reopened in December 1939.|$|E
