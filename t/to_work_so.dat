5|$|Increase {{the supply}} of labor and {{aggregate}} compensation by about 0.8 and 0.9 percent over the 2021-2025 period. CBO cited the ACA's expanded eligibility for Medicaid and subsidies and tax credits that rise with income as disincentives <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> <b>so</b> repealing the ACA would remove those disincentives, encouraging workers to supply more hours of labor.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{supervision}} of Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), Lexie works with Mercy West resident Dr. April Kepner (Sarah Drew) on a burglar, and the two get in several disagreements, leading Lexie to steal her diary. Dr. Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) and Adamson continuously argue {{over the course of}} treatment for a patient, leading the patient's daughter to yell at them in disbelief. Angry about the revelation that Percy (who later apologized saying that they can be friends outside the hospital, but not inside) was using her, Stevens accidentally administers the wrong dialysis to a patient, making her an unviable candidate for the kidney transplant she was scheduled to receive. After arguing over surgical cases for the entirety of the day, Yang comes to the realization that she needs a cardiothoracic surgeon to work at the hospital. After being mistreated by Kepner, Lexie begins to mock her about what is written in her diary, thus ruining her emotionally, but subsequently apologizes. Dr. Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw), Torres' girlfriend, talks to Carlos, and convinces him to accept his daughter's sexuality. Having found out about Stevens' mistake, Dr. Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson) reprimands her reports her to the chief of surgery Dr. Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.). Webber asks Stevens to come into her office, and he fires her from the staff, noting that Hunt, Shepherd, and Karev had concerns with her coming back <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>so</b> early. Stevens departs, writing Karev a Dear John letter, causing him to cry in front of Meredith and Yang.|$|E
25|$|Elaborate {{constraints}} {{placed on}} women's figures {{over the years}} were not universal. Corsetry made it virtually impossible <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> <b>so</b> simpler functional garments were worn by women who worked inside or outside the home. Support for the breasts was often provided by a simple tie under the breast line, in the bodice.|$|E

25|$|During the {{recuperation}} period, Mandrell {{was unable}} <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> <b>so</b> needed to collect on her insurance {{to pay for}} medical bills and to keep her band paid. On the Ralph Emery on the Record show, Mandrell explained that the problem was that, under Tennessee law, {{she had to go}} through the formality of filing a lawsuit against survivors of the dead driver who had caused the accident, 19-year-old college student Mark White, to collect from her own insurance company.|$|E

25|$|A new Latina group, called Soluna, {{had just}} lost a member and {{was looking for a}} replacement. T Lopez quickly auditioned, and was whisked away on tour. T Lopez {{explained}} that touring with Marc Anthony and Enrique Iglesias was a crazy roller coaster ride for her because everything happened so fast. But she had a great time, T Lopez said. Latina group Soluna released their 2002 debut album, For All Time, under the Dreamworks Records label. Paramount and UPN quickly took interest in the group and developed a TV pilot based on their lives, co-starring Mario Lopez & Tony Plana. After filming the pilot, Soluna reconvened for a second album but realized they had grown apart musically. The group said that they wanted it <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>so</b> bad that they were forcing it and they finally just gave up and wished each other well in their individual journeys.|$|E
25|$|The United States {{immigration}} {{system provides}} channels for legal, permanent economic immigration, especially for high-skilled workers. For low-skilled workers, temporary or seasonal legal immigration {{is easier to}} acquire. The United States immigration system rests on three pillars: family reunification, provision of scarce labor (as in agricultural and specific high-skilled worker sectors), and protecting American workers from competition with foreign workers. The current system sets an overall limit of 675,000 permanent immigrants each year; this limit {{does not apply to}} spouses, unmarried minor children or parents of U.S. citizens. Outside of this number for permanent immigrants, 480,000 visas are allotted for those under the family-preference rules and 140,000 are allocated for employment-related preferences. The current system and low number of visas available make it difficult for low-skilled workers to legally and permanently enter the country <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> <b>so</b> illegal entry becomes the way immigrants respond to the lure of jobs with higher wages than what {{they would be able to}} find in their current country.|$|E
25|$|On lap 15, Hamilton and Sebastian Vettel {{came into}} the pits. Hamilton rejoined in sixth place but Vettel's fuel pump failed <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>so</b> {{he had to come}} in again. Kovalainen came in a lap later while Barrichello was pushing to try and build a gap. Button and Räikkönen pitted on lap 18, the Finn coming out in eighth while Button rejoined in 11th. Barrichello came in on lap 19, the Brazilian had made a lot of ground as he rejoined just behind Lewis after being around 10 seconds adrift. But most {{importantly}} for Brawn he had jumped the other McLaren of Kovalainen. On lap 24, a lot of smoke was pouring from the rear end of Vettel's car and he retired with a suspected engine failure. Hamilton was ordered over the radio to try to cool down his rear brakes as the temperature were getting out of control, but he was unable to shake off the challenge of Barrichello in second.|$|E

Experiments showed that the polonium vaporized well when the lead orthophosphate was heated to [...] for four hours. Unfortunately, the process then ran into problems with dust and other foreign matter, and with contamination of the personnel and equipment involved.|$|E

Acevedo explained in an interview, [...] "Charlie goes {{out on this}} call, and he gets attacked by this mythological, genetically enhanced griffin. He fights for his life throughout the episode". Acevedo suggested that his wife, actress Kiersten Warren, play his character's wife Sonia, and the producers duly cast her. Acevedo explained his choice was because, [...] "to create intimacy with someone who you don't know is actually not going <b>to</b> <b>work.</b> <b>So</b> to have your real wife do it, then {{you can be a}} lot better on screen".|$|E

Urey helped persuade NASA to make unmanned probes to a moon a priority. When Apollo 11 returned moon rock samples from the moon, Urey examined them at the Lunar Receiving Laboratory. The samples supported Urey's contention that the moon and the Earth shared a common origin. While at UCSD, Urey published 105 scientific papers, 47 of them about lunar topics. When asked why he continued <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>so</b> hard, he joked, [...] "Well, you know I’m not on tenure anymore." ...|$|E

500|$|Bakshi {{claimed he}} [...] "didn't start {{thinking}} about shooting the film totally in live action until I saw it really start <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>so</b> well. I learned lots of things about the process, like rippling. One scene, some figures were standing on a hill and a big gust of wind came up and the shadows moved {{back and forth on}} the clothes and it was unbelievable in animation. I don't think I could get the feeling of cold on the screen without showing snow or an icicle on some guy's nose. The characters have weight and they move correctly." [...] After the Spanish film development lab discovered that telephone lines, helicopters, and cars could be seen in the footage Bakshi had shot, they tried to incinerate the footage, telling Bakshi's first assistant director that [...] "if that kind of sloppy cinematography got out, no one from Hollywood would ever come back to Spain to shoot again." ...|$|E
500|$|Häkkinen {{said that}} his race was [...] "over" [...] when the rain started to fall having not {{managing}} to achieve a higher finishing position. Jos Verstappen scored points {{for the first time}} since the 1996 Argentine Grand Prix. Verstappen said that was pleased with the result and praised his team for switching to wet tyres as he kept in contact with his mechanics. Trulli remarked that he had [...] "never had <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>so</b> hard for one point" [...] after the amount of pressure he came under in the race. Coulthard said that he lost the chance of victory when he stalled his car and admitted it was his mistake. On the other hand, he criticised his penalty as Coulthard believed that the race stewards should have been given more freedom by Formula One's governing body, the FIA, to decide whether a driver gained an advantage. David Tremayne of The Independent noted had Coulthard raised his hand before the start, he might have started from the back of the grid. After the race, Villeneuve and Diniz were penalised 25 seconds–which were added to their total race times–for their collisions with Diniz and de la Rosa respectively.|$|E
500|$|... "Simpson Tide" [...] {{was one of}} two season nine episodes {{that was}} {{executive}} produced by Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who together were the showrunners for the third and fourth seasons. Although Jean would later return to run the show the following season, it was the last episode that Reiss received an executive producer credit for. Joshua Sternin and Jeffrey Ventimilia, the episode writers, were working on Jean and Reiss's show The Critic at the time, and pitched an episode where Homer joins the Naval Reserve. Although the episode is partly based on the film Crimson Tide, the original episode pitch was made before the film was released. After the release of the film, the writers decided to start incorporating things from the movie in the script. In the original draft, Bart sneaked on board the submarine with Homer. They were trying to do it [...] "for the comedy of it", but could not get the draft <b>to</b> <b>work,</b> <b>so</b> it was cut. It was difficult for them {{to figure out how to}} get the captain off of the sub and they eventually decided to have him shot out of the torpedo tube, which in the DVD commentary, Al Jean says that Steiger claimed that he really did get stuck in a torpedo tube once.|$|E

500|$|A [...] "major consequence" [...] of the typewriter's {{development}} was {{the entrance of}} women into the clerical work force. Although women were already employed in factories and certain service industries in the 1880s, the typewriter facilitated an influx of women into office settings. Before the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) established the first typing school in 1881, women were trained by the manufacturer and their typing services provided to customers along with the machine. The expansion of correspondence and paper work that demanded the efficiency of typewriters, however, also created demand for additional clerical workers. The low wages accepted by women—often 50% (or less) of those paid to a man—made them more attractive economically to businesses when filling the new positions. As typing and stenography positions could pay up to ten times more than those in factories, women were attracted in large numbers to office work. In 1874, less than 4% of clerical workers in the United States were women; by 1900, the number had increased to approximately 75%. Before his death, Sholes remarked of the typewriter, [...] "I do feel that I have done something for {{the women who have}} always had <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>so</b> hard. This will enable them more easily to earn a living." ...|$|E
500|$|Hale {{is universally}} {{considered}} an excellent judge and jurist, particularly {{due to his}} writings. Edward Foss wrote {{that he was an}} [...] "eminent judge, whom all look up to as one of the brightest luminaries of the law, as well for the soundness of his learning as for the excellence of his life". Similarly, John Campbell in his Lives of the Chief Justices of England, wrote that Hale was [...] "one of the most pure, the most pious, the most independent, and the most learned" [...] of judges. Henry Flanders, writing in the University of Pennsylvania Law Review, describes Hale during his lifetime as [...] "the most learned, the most able, the most honorable man {{to be found in the}} profession of the law". Hale's writings have been cited as recently as 1993, in the case of R v Kingston, where the Court of Appeal relied on his statement that [...] "drunkenness is not a defence" [...] to uphold a conviction. William Holdsworth argues that it was his learning in Roman law and jurisprudence which allowed him <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>so</b> effectively; because he had seen other legal systems at work, he [...] "could both criticise the defects of English law and state its rules in a more orderly form than they had ever been stated before". Hale's political neutrality and personal integrity has been attributed to his Puritanism, and his support of the common law; [...] "Regimes come and go, the common law abides...For Hale...legal continuity was vital for civic identity".|$|E
