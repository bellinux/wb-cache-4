50|$|The Oxfordshire {{was officially}} {{handed over to}} the Bibby Line on 14 February 1957 when she steamed towards Liverpool to {{commence}} her trooping role. On 28 February 1957 Oxfordshire left Liverpool on her maiden voyage under the command of Captain Norman Fitch, bound for Hong Kong via Cape Town. The vessel had the capacity to carry 1000 troops, 500 passengers (usually the families of the troops) and 409 crew members. Oxfordshire made an average of four trips per year between Britain and the Far East, calling en route at Ceylon, Aden, Port Said and Suez in Egypt. However, by the early 1960s the use of aircraft to fulfil transport requirements and the declining number of overseas British garrisons meant that trooping by sea was soon to be redundant. In 1962 the British Government finally decided to rely entirely on air trooping, so the long-term charters of Oxfordshire and near sister-ship Nevasa were terminated and the vessels withdrawn from service. The last active troopship Oxfordshire followed Nevasa (despatched in October 1962), <b>to</b> <b>lay-up</b> in the safe haven of Cornwall's River Fal in December of that year.|$|E
50|$|In 1950 {{the ship}} was bought by the former Russian emigre shipowner, Alexander Vlasov. Laid up for another two years, in 1952 she was renamed Castel Forte {{and sent to the}} Newport News {{shipyard}} in the United States, intended for conversion to a refrigerated cargo ship for Vlasovs Italian-managed Sitmar Line. However, this conversion was soon abandoned and the vessel returned <b>to</b> <b>lay-up.</b> In 1957, Sitmar secured a charter from the Australian government for Castel Forte to carry British migrants to Australia and major structural work started on the ship at the Bethlehem Steel shipyard in New York. The vessel was moved to Genoa in December 1957, where the interior refitting was completed in May 1958. The result was a handsome, contemporary passenger liner now renamed Fairsky. Tourist one class accommodation for a maximum of 1,461 was provided in 461 cabins over five decks. Reflecting similar arrangements in earlier company ships Fairsea and Castel Felice, Fairsky featured just seven cabins with private facilities, located forward on the Sun Deck, beneath the Bridge Deck. Air-conditioning was installed throughout the ship and a good range of comfortable public rooms was provided, mostly on the Boat Deck. Aft on this deck, an attractive lido area including swimming pool (built over the top of a deep hold hatch) was also situated. Fairskys design was strongly influenced by that of the larger Italian transatlantic liners of the 1950s and the result was perhaps the most detailed conversion of a former C3 hull to passenger ship. On 26 June 1958 the vessel commenced service from Southampton under the command of Sitmars senior Master, Captain Jorge Petrescu. Fairsky was registered in Panama under the nominal ownership of the Fairline Shipping Corporation, though remained operated by Sitmar while in Vlasov ownership. The port of registry was later changed to that of Monrovia, Liberia.|$|E
40|$|Commonly, {{composite}} panel optimization {{is based on}} a multi-level strategy. An important step of the strategy is to optimize the stacking sequence. In this paper, we are interested in this step through lay-up table optimization towards buckling. A lay-up table is used to define the stacking sequence associated with each integer thickness of the skin and <b>to</b> insure <b>lay-up</b> continuity between different thicknesses. A genetic algorithm performs the optimization of the lay-up table with a chromosome coding of lay-up table meeting directly the requirements of lay-up continuity between different thicknesses. The fitness function used in this study is a multi-objective one: - The first objective concerns percentages coming from the first level thickness law. - The second one concerns buckling behavior - And the last one deals with limitation of inter-laminar shear stresses. Two examples illustrate the ability of this methodology <b>to</b> provide optimized <b>lay-up</b> tables...|$|R

50|$|The mission {{began in}} November 2001, with an 8-man patrol from G Sqn's Air Troop {{performing}} the regiments first wartime HALO parachute jump from a United States Air Force (USAF) or Royal Air Force (RAF) C-130 Hecules {{flying out of}} Camp Rhino at 6110 m (other sources say 28000 ft) and parachuting through Sub-zero temperatures with their parachutes opening automatically at 1220 m) - onto a barren desert site in Registan in Helmand/Kandahar Province to test its suitability as an improvised airstrip for the landing of the main assault force in 6 USAF C-130 Hecules. The Air Troop team confirmed it was suitable and marked out the 900 x 40 ft runway and moved <b>to</b> <b>lay-up</b> positions. Seventeen hours later, the fleet of C-130s (flying out of Bagram Airfield) began to land, each touching down {{just long enough for}} the SAS to disembark in their vehicles. Operators from A Sqn G Sqn drove directly off the ramps as the aircraft moved along the desert strip before taking off again; driving 38 Land Rover DPV 110/"pinkies", 2 logistics vehicles and 8 Kawasaki dirt bikes, they formed up and proceeded towards their target. One Land Rover broke down due to an engine problem, the vehicle was left behind, its 3-man crew stayed to guard it (they were picked when the assault force exfilled). The assault force drove 190 km, (the drive was difficult due to poor visibility {{as a result of the}} fine dust) within a limited amount of time, to a previously agreed forming-up point and split into two elements - the main assault force and the FSB (fire support base), A Sqn was given the task of assaulting the target facility, whilst G Sqn took the role of FSB, G Sqn would suppress the enemy with vehicle-mounted 7.62 mm L7A2 GPMGs, 0.5 in M2 Browning HMGs, MILAN antitank missiles along with L16 81mm mortars and 0.5 in Barrett M82A1 sniper rifles, (from a position 0.8 km away) allowing A Sqn to close in on the target (the force was out of range of Coalition artillery). If necessary G Sqn would send in additional men if the attack got pinned down. The force lay in wait during the first hour of the early morning; just after 0700, A Sqn observed the enemy moving in and out of the trenches.|$|E

40|$|The latest {{generation}} of aircrafts, {{which are often}} in large parts made from fibre-forced-plastics, are prone due to common lightning strikes. Therefore, an extra treatment of the fuselage is {{necessary in order to}} prevent any damage. A special high conductive material (Lightning Strike Protection (LSP) material) is applied to the outermost layer of the fuselage. Currently, for double curved parts of the fuselage, this happens to be a very cost-intensive manual process. We have developed an automated solution for standard industrial robot which reduces the necessary manpower, speeds up the lay-up quantity and improves the process reproducibility. Our approach aims not only the draping process of the LSP material due to the constructed lay-up head but also the generation of the robot paths and optimised cuts of the material regarding to the curvature of the mould. The cuts are produced during the draping process directly from the material reel. Therefore our solution shortens the process chain by eliminating the pre-cutting of the material and allows <b>to</b> <b>lay-up</b> wider cuts and better utilisation of the material. The lay-up process itself is very precise, less stressful to the material and compliant to the manufacturing specifications...|$|E

40|$|DE 10060379 A UPAB: 20020823 NOVELTY - A process {{creates a}} {{thin-walled}} three-dimensional work piece using a layered combination of endless fibres and resin. The fibres and resin {{are placed in}} layers on a support base together with a fixing agent which is activated. The fibre layers or hanks are placed non-tensioned individually, in groups, regular patterns, in wave, loops or snake pattern in defined webs. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The fibre lay-ups are laid in regular cross lay-up web patterns on a previous fibre lay-up. The resulting panel is subsequently cut to required dimensions and shapes. The panel is then placed in a tool form and further shaped with additional artificial fibres and resin. The bottom layer (10) consists of fibres (101, 102) of limited strength resting between warp and weft (71, 72) fibre layers. Prior to the application of resin, the fibre positions are fixed by {{the application of a}} spray whose characteristics accord with those of the final material. The smallest average fibre radius is between 10 and 90 mm, and the fibre length is between 80 and 200 mm.

40|$|The {{majority}} of the wind turbine blade industry currently uses low cost hand <b>lay-up</b> manufacturing techniques <b>to</b> process composite blades. While there are benefits <b>to</b> the hand <b>lay-up</b> process, drawbacks inherent to this process along with advantages of other techniques suggest that better manufacturing alternatives may be available. Resin Transfer Molding (RTM) {{was identified as a}} processing alternative and shows promise in addressing the shortcomings of hand lay-up. This report details a comparison of the RTM process <b>to</b> hand <b>lay-up</b> of composite wind turbine blade structures. Several lay-up schedules and critical turbine blade structures were chosen for comparison of their properties resulting from RTM and hand lay-up processing. The geometries investigated were flat plate, thin and thick flanged T-stiffener, I-beam, and root connection joint. It was found that the manufacturing process {{played an important role in}} laminate thickness, fiber volume, and weight for the geometries investigated. RTM was found to reduce thickness and weight and increase fiber volumes for all substructures. RTM resulted in tighter material transition radii and eliminated the need for most secondary bonding operations. These results would significantly reduce the weight of wind turbine blades. Hand lay-up was consistently slower in fabrication times for the structures investigated. A comparison of mechanical properties showed no significant differences after employing fiber volume normalization techniques to account for geometry differences resulting from varying fiber volumes. The current root specimen design does not show significant mechanical property differences according to process and exceeds all static and fatigue requirements...|$|R
