The {{purpose of}} this {{cross-sectional}} single-blind {{study was to investigate}} the immediate effects of Kinesiology taping of quadriceps on motor performance after muscle fatigued induction. Design. Randomized controlled cross-sectional design. Subjects. Forty-five subjects participated in this study. Participants were divided into three groups: Kinesiology <b>taping</b> <b>group,</b> placebo <b>taping</b> <b>group,</b> and nontaping group. Methods. Subjects performed short-term exercise for muscle fatigued induction, followed by the application of each intervention. Peak torque test, one-leg single hop test, active joint position sense test, and one-leg static balance test were carried out before and after the intervention. Results. Peak torque and single-leg hopping distance were significantly increased when Kinesiology taping was applied (p< 0. 05). But there were no significant effects on active joint position sense and single-leg static balance. Conclusions. We proved that Kinesiology taping is effective in restoring muscle power reduced after muscle fatigued induction.

40|$|Question: Is taping of {{the knee}} {{effective}} in improving pain and disability in patients with osteoarthritis {{of the knee}}? Design Randomised controlled trial. Setting University and private practices in Melbourne, Australia. Patients: Volunteers who responded to advertisements in local newspapers. Inclusion criteria were symptoms of knee osteoarthritis {{as defined by the}} American College of Rheumatology. Exclusion criteria included allergy to tape, or history of joint replacement, symptoms or signs suggestive of another cause of knee pain, physiotherapy/steroid injection/surgery for the knee (previous six months), body mass index > 38 (owing to difficulties of taping the knee effectively), history of knee taping, and fragile skin around the knee. Patients were randomised into therapeutic tape (n = 29), control tape (n = 29) or no tape (n = 29) groups. Interventions Therapeutic tape provided medial glide, medial tilt, and anteroposterior tilt to the patella and either unloaded the infrapatellar fat pad or the pes anserinus. Hypoallergenic undertape was applied beneath the rigid tape to prevent irritation of the skin. The control tape was hypoallergenic tape alone, laid over the same areas of skin as the therapeutic tape. The tapes were worn for three weeks and reapplied weekly. Participants allocated to the no <b>tape</b> <b>group</b> received no intervention. Outcomes Primary outcomes were pain on movement and pain on worst activity measured on a 0 – 10 cm scale, and participant perceived rating of change. Secondary outcomes included the pain subscale of the WOMAC osteoarthritis index, the knee pain scale, and the bodily pain domain of the SF- 36. All outcomes were assessed at three and six weeks. Main results: The therapeutic <b>tape</b> <b>group</b> reported greater pain reduction than the other two groups, e. g. at six weeks the mean difference (95 % CI) for therapeutic tape versus no tape was 2. 4 (1. 1 to 3. 7) for pain on worst activity.

40|$|Subacromial {{impingement}} syndrome (SIS) {{has been}} described as {{the most common form of}} shoulder pathology argued that 100 % of impingement lesions and 95 % of rotator cuff pathology are caused by friction between the acromion and surrounding tissues within the subacromial space. Commonly, rest, Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDS), corticosteroid injections, and mobilization, strengthening exercises will resolve most cases of SIS. The results of the long-term outcome of these treatments, however, are not promising. Purpose: This study focuses on the effect of scapular taping and conventional Physical therapy in increasing isometric muscle strength, decreasing pain, improving function in patients with subacromial impingement syndrome. Study design: Double blinded randomised controlled clinical trial. Subjects were assessed by a blinded researcher using standard physiotherapy measures, Shoulder Pain and Disability Index questionnaire (SPADI), and isometric muscle strength measured using digital dynamo meter.

40|$|Introduction: The {{objective}} is to evaluate the accuracy of medication dosing and the time to medication administration in the prehospital setting using a novel length-based pediatric emergency resuscitation tape. Methods: This study was a two-period, two-treatment crossover trial using simulated pediatric patients in the prehospital setting. Each participant was presented with two emergent scenarios; participants were randomized to which case they encountered first, and to which case used the National Park Service (NPS) emergency medical services (EMS) length-based pediatric emergency resuscitation tape. In the control (without tape) case, providers used standard methods to determine medication dosing (e. g. asking parents to estimate the patient’s weight); in the intervention (with tape) case, they used the NPS EMS length-based pediatric emergency resuscitation tape. Each scenario required dosing two medications (Case 1 [febrile seizure] required midazolam and acetaminophen; Case 2 [anaphylactic reaction] required epinephrine and diphenhydramine). Twenty NPS EMS providers, trained at the Parkmedic/Advanced Emergency Medical Technician level, served as study participants. Results: The only medication errors that occurred were in the control (no <b>tape)</b> <b>group</b> (without tape: 5 vs. with tape: 0, p= 0. 024). Time to determination of medication dose was significantly shorter in the intervention (with <b>tape)</b> <b>group</b> than the control (without <b>tape)</b> <b>group,</b> for {{three of the four}} medications used. In case 1, time to both midazolam and acetaminophen was significantly faster in the intervention (with <b>tape)</b> <b>group</b> (midazolam: 8. 3 vs. 28. 9 seconds, p= 0. 005; acetaminophen: 28. 6 seconds vs. 50. 6 seconds, p= 0. 036). In case 2, time to epinephrine did not differ (23. 3 seconds vs. 22. 9 seconds, p= 0. 96), while time to diphenhydramine was significantly shorter in the intervention (with <b>tape)</b> <b>group</b> (13 seconds vs. 37. 5 seconds, p< 0. 05). Conclusion: Use of a length-based pediatric emergency resuscitation tape in the prehospital setting was associated with significantly fewer dosing errors and faster time-to-medication administration in simulated pediatric emergencies. Further research in a clinical field setting to prospectively confirm these findings is needed...|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} corneal injury during {{general anesthesia}} {{and analyze the}} protective effect of medical hydro-gel eye patch in clinics.

For the <b>tape</b> <b>group,</b> arch height ratio (=arch height/distance from heel to first metatarsophalangeal joint line) was greater by 0. 006 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 0002 - 0. 01, p = 0. 04) following the intervention period, whereas no change was observed for the control group (- 0. 003 (- 0. 01 - 0. 004), p = 0. 36). The difference between groups (0. 009 (0. 0004 - 0. 02), p = 0. 04) equated to a 0. 16 cm increase in arch height for the <b>tape</b> <b>group</b> following continual use of ALD tape.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Blisters {{are common}} foot {{injuries}} {{during and after}} prolonged walking. However, the best treatment remains unclear. The aim {{of the study was}} to compare the effect of 2 different friction blister treatment regimens, wide area fixation dressing versus adhesive tape. DESIGN: A prospective observational cohort study. SETTING: The 2015 Nijmegen Four Days Marches in the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 2907 participants (45 ± 16 years, 52 % men) were included and received 4131 blister treatments. INTERVENTIONS: Blisters were treated with either a wide area fixation dressing or adhesive tape. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Time of treatment application was our primary outcome. In addition, effectiveness and satisfaction were evaluated in a subgroup (n = 254). During a 1 -month follow-up period, blister healing, infection and the need for additional medical treatment were assessed in the subgroup. RESULTS: Time of treatment application was lower (41. 5 minutes; SD = 21. 6 minutes) in the wide area fixation dressing group compared with the adhesive <b>tape</b> <b>group</b> (43. 4 minutes; SD = 25. 5 minutes; P = 0. 02).

However, little objective evidence has been documented. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effect of elastic taping on the triceps surae during a maximal vertical jump. It was hypothesized that elastic taping to the triceps surae would increase muscle activity and cause positive effect to jump height. Methods Thirty-one healthy adults (19 males and 12 females with mean age, body weight and height for 25. 3 ± 3. 8 years old, 64. 1 ± 6. 2 kg, and 169. 4 ± 7. 3 cm, respectively) were recruited. All participants performed vertical jump tests prior to (without taping) and during elastic taping. Two elastic tapes, Kinesio tape and Mplacebo tape from two different manufacturers, were applied to the participants, respectively. Results The results showed that the vertical ground reaction force increased when Kinesio tape was applied even when the height of jump remained about constant. However, the height of the jump decreased, and there was no difference on the vertical ground reaction force in Mplacebo <b>taping</b> <b>group.</b> Although the EMG activity of medial gastrocnemius tended to increase in Kinesio <b>taping</b> <b>group,</b> we did not see differences in EMG activity for the medial gastrocnemius, tibialis anterior and soleus muscles in either group.

Methods Patients with acute ankle sprain received rest, ice, compression and elevation with an compressive bandage at the emergency department. After 5 - 7 [*]days, 100 patients with grade II and III sprains were randomized into two groups: one group was treated with tape and the other with a semi-rigid ankle brace, both for 4 [*]weeks. Post-injury physical and proprioceptive training was standardized. As primary outcome parameter patient satisfaction and skin complications were evaluated using a predefined questionnaire and numeric rating scale. As secondary outcome parameter the ankle joint function was assessed using the Karlsson scoring scale and range of motion. Results Patient-reported comfort and satisfaction during treatment with a semi-rigid brace was significantly increased. The rate of skin complication in this group was significantly lower compared to the <b>tape</b> <b>group</b> (14. 6 % versus 59. 1 %, P[*] Conclusion Treatment of acute ankle sprain with semi-rigid brace leads to significantly higher patient comfort and satisfaction, both with similar good outcome. </p...|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{investigated the}} role of intragroup communication in intergroup conflict (de-) escalation. Experiment 1 {{examined the effects of}} intragroup communication (vs. individual thought) and anticipated face-to-face intergroup contact (vs. no anticipated face-to-face intergroup contact). The group discussions of stigmatized group members who anticipated face-to-face intergroup contact revolved more around intergroup hostility. This boosted ingroup identification and increased social creativity but also led to steeling (a hardening of perceived intergroup relations). In Experiment 2, new participants listened to the <b>taped</b> <b>group</b> discussions. The discussions of groups anticipating face-to-face intergroup contact evoked more intergroup anxiety-related discomfort than discussions of groups not anticipating face-to-face intergroup encounters. Together, these results support the idea that steeling is a defensive reaction to prepare for an anxiety-arousing intergroup confrontation. Although steeling is also associated with positive consequences such as increased ingroup solidarity and social creativity, this hardened stance may be an obstacle to conflict de-escalation...|$|R
40|$|Background: Kinesio Tape (KT) is a {{somewhat}} {{new type of}} taping technique gaining popularity as both treatment and performance enhancement tool. Considering the fact that KT can improve muscle performance, however, limited {{research has been done}} on the different technique of strips application of KT on functional performance. Therefore {{purpose of this study is}} to compare Comparison of three kinesio technique application on jumping in collegiate female athletes. Methods: 45 healthy collegiate female athletes were recruited based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The subjects were randomly divided into three equal groups (group I, n= 15, Group II, n= 15 & group III, n= 15). Group I received Y application of kinesio <b>taping,</b> <b>Group</b> II received I application of kinesio <b>taping</b> while, <b>Group</b> III underwent combined Y & I application of kinesio tape on triceps surae. Pre and post measurement of vertical jump (in terms of power average, power peak) and horizontal distance were documented. Results: Statistically significant differences were found between the difference power average, difference power peak and difference horizontal jump in group I, II and III (p< 0. 001). Within group comparison also revealed statistically significant differences in power average, power peak and horizontal jump in all the three groups (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: Combined technique (Y and I) application of kinesio was more effective in improving vertical jump (power average, power peak) and horizontal jump as compared to Y and I application alone...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: {{to assess}} the {{effectiveness}} of the chlorhexidine antimicrobial dressing in comparison to the gauze and tape dressing in the use of central venous catheters. METHOD: a randomized clinical trial was conducted in the intensive care and adult semi intensive care units of a university hospital in the south of Brazil. The subjects were patients using short-term central venous catheters, randomly assigned to the intervention (chlorhexidine antimicrobial dressing) or control (gauze and micro porous <b>tape)</b> <b>groups.</b> RESULTS: a total of 85 patients were included: 43 in the intervention group and 42 in the control group. No statistically {{significant differences were found between}} dressings in regard to the occurrence of: primary bloodstream infections (p-value = 0. 5170); local reactions to the dressing (p-value = 0. 3774); and dressing fixation (p-value = 0. 2739). CONCLUSION: both technologies are effective in covering central venous catheters in regard to the investigated variables and can be used for this purpose. Registry ECR: RBR- 7 b 5 ycz...|$|R
