5|$|The game {{begins on}} Crater Planet and {{revolves}} around {{the story of an}} insane astrophysicist, Baron Aloha. Planning to make a large profit from his evil ingenuity, Aloha removes giant pieces of land from the planet using machines <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> private resorts. Aloha also removes and hides the twelve jet pods that propel each world. Witnessing the destruction, the residents of Crater Planet call for help, and in response the Universal City Hall dispatches one of their agents, a mechanical rabbit named Robbit. Robbit is ordered to explore each world to retrieve the jet pods, stop Aloha, and save Crater Planet from destruction. At the end of the game, Aloha flees to his home, Little Muu, and vows revenge on Robbit.|$|E
5|$|New World Pictures {{produced}} a 95-minute English-dubbed {{adaptation of the}} film, titled Warriors of the Wind, and it was released theatrically in the United States in June 1985, with the VHS video release in December 1985. In the late 1980s, Vestron Video would release the film and First Independent Video would re-release it in 1993 with another minute cut from the film. The voice actors and actresses were not informed of the film's plotline and the film was heavily edited to market it as a children's action-adventure film. Consequently, part of the film's narrative meaning was lost: some of the environmentalist themes were diluted as was the main subplot of the Ohmu, altered <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> aggressive enemies. Most of the characters' names were changed, including the titular character who became Princess Zandra. The United States cover for the VHS release featured a cadre of male characters {{who are not in}} the film, riding the resurrected God Warrior—including a still-living Warrior shown briefly in a flashback. Approximately 22 minutes of scenes were cut for the film's North American release.|$|E
25|$|The {{first draft}} of the DADVSI law criminalized {{peer-to-peer}} exchanges of copyrighted works (or, more precisely, copyrighted works whose licenses did not allow such exchanges). The case was made in Parliament that millions of French Internet users, especially among the young, currently traded files on computer networks {{and that it was}} thus unrealistic <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> felons. Since subsequent reading coincided with the examination of a controversial youth workforce clause known as the CPE, the opposition argued that the government was at war with the youth.|$|E

(Howe's involvement at this stage was minimal, mainly taking place {{towards the end of the}} sessions.)

They sought refuge with a butcher who lived outside the city. At night-time, however, the butcher killed them <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> aspic.

25|$|Yoav Gelber {{claims that}} the Arab Liberation Army {{embarked}} on a systematic evacuation of non-combatants from several frontier villages in order <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> military strongholds. Arab depopulation occurred most in villages close to Jewish settlements and in vulnerable neighborhoods in Haifa, Jaffa and West Jerusalem. The poorer inhabitants of these neighborhoods generally fled {{to other parts of}} the city. Those who could afford to fled further away, expecting to return when the troubles were over.

Juggernaut uses the tablet's power to become stronger, but Amazing Spider-Man defeats him and claims the fragment. In the Noir universe, The Goblin uses a fragment to become a monstrous goliath. After a battle under a circus tent, Goblin is defeated and Spider-Man Noir claims his fragment. Spider-Man 2099 encounters Doctor Octopus, head of Alchemax's Shadow Division, and the one who hired Scorpion. Driven insane by the fragment, she plans to use it to power a dangerous reactor. Spider-Man 2099 shuts down the reactor and claims the fragment. In the Ultimate universe, S.H.I.E.L.D. has acquired a tablet fragment and Carnage in the Triskelion. Carnage escapes, draining the life from the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents and using the fragment's power <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> his zombie minions. When Ultimate Spider-Man arrives, the Triskelion is already under Carnage's control. Ultimate Spider-Man stops Carnage and claims his fragment.

500|$|Sonic Advance is a side-scrolling, action-platform game {{reminiscent}} of the original Sonic the Hedgehog games released for the Sega Genesis. Players journey through the fictional South Island to defeat Doctor Eggman, who is attempting to capture the island's animal population <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> evil robots. At the game's start, players select one of four characters, each with their own unique set of moves.

With the exception of Amy, each character can defeat enemy robots by jumping and curling into a ball, or by performing a spin dash on the ground to gain speed. By entering a cheat code, players can also control Sonic while Tails runs alongside him, similar to Sonic the Hedgehog 2.|$|E

40|$|This article {{seeks to}} show that the rights which protect people’s {{autonomy}} should be entrenched in the constitution of a democratic state. It is firmly located in egalitarian liberal tradition, as it takes for valid the following claims: (1) people have a fundamental interest in autonomy; (2) people have rights that their interest in autonomy, and the interests to which it gives rise, be protected and promoted; (3) people’s respective interests in autonomy must be protected equally. The argument for a bill of rights unfolds as follows: first, it is argued that we have autonomy-protecting rights not only against private individuals but also against the state, and the meaning of having such rights against the state is explained; then it is shown that it is legitimate <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> certain autonomy-protecting moral rights into legal rights, and that doing so {{in the case of the}} rights we have against the state amounts <b>to</b> <b>turning</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> constitutional rights; lastly, two objections to the argument deployed earlier are countered...|$|R

Pauline's marriage to Joe {{was an attempt to}} give the character a [...] "new lease of life", and her wedding day was screened to coincide with EastEnders 21st anniversary.

500|$|Work on {{the story}} began in October 1999, and took longer than expected. The team {{estimated}} two months, but soon realised they lacked the necessary skills to meet this deadline. Bullfrog's James Leach, who had previously worked on titles such as Dungeon Keeper and Theme Hospital, was recruited, and wrote many challenges, all the dialogue, and enabled the team to make the advisers characters rather than just sources of information. The idea to make the advisers characters came from Alex Evans, who wanted them to interact with their lips synchronised. A system was developed that moved their mouths into common phoneme shapes, used as a basis <b>to</b> <b>turn</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> graphic equalisers that move into shapes according to the sounds being played. This facilitated localisation, as the game was to be translated into fifteen languages. Both advisers were voiced by Marc Silk, cutting the recording time by roughly half. The initial designs were produced artist Christian Bravery, but these were considered too similar to classic devils and angels. Healey redesigned the angel {{to be more like}} a fairy. He was accused of putting his girlfriend into the game, something which he agreed with on reflection: he admitted that it looked [...] "rather a lot like her". He then designed an old man resembling a cross between a hippy, a yogi, and a [...] "kindly old man". [...] The advisers' animations and emotions were triggered by keywords in the script document, a Microsoft Excel file consisting of several thousand lines. Much of the script was for the advisers, as they were to comment on everything happening {{as well as the other}} things players may want to do.|$|E
