5|$|The {{battle for}} Montbrehain raged until 20:00 that night, {{during which time}} the line had been linked up and consolidated.

5|$|An off spinner, Johnson was {{a member}} of Bradman’s first-choice team, playing in four of the five Tests before being dropped for the final match. However, he was not {{prominent}} in the Tests, taking seven wickets at a bowling average of 61.00. Among <b>the</b> <b>frontline</b> bowlers who played in four or more Tests, Johnson had the worst average by a factor of almost two and took the least number of wickets. Johnson had little impact with the bat, scoring 51 runs at a batting average of 10.20, but took five catches in the slips.|$|E
5|$|In December, Hitler {{ordered his}} final, desperate {{attack in the}} west - through the snow-covered forests of the Ardennes.

5|$|Ingram was {{promoted}} to lieutenant on 24 October, and was training away from <b>the</b> <b>frontline</b> with his battalion when the Armistice was signed on 11 November 1918; thus ending the war.

Boarding a troopship bound for Australia soon after, he arrived in Melbourne on 5 March and was discharged from the Australian Imperial Force on 2 June.|$|E
5|$|McCudden {{claimed his}} first victory in September 1916. He claimed his fifth victory—making him an ace—on 15 February 1917.

To retake the island of Ambon, Rijadi took half his forces and invaded the eastern shores, while the other half was tasked with invading from the northern coast. Although the second group experienced heavy resistance, Rijadi's group was able to take to the beach in native canoes unopposed; they later landed more infantry and armour.|$|E

5|$|Shazly {{visited the}} {{front in the}} early morning before the Israeli attack to form an {{assessment}} of the situation. He arrived at Second Army Headquarters where he was briefed on the situation, then went to 2nd Division's advanced headquarters, where he met Brigadier General Hasan Abu Sa'ada and visited <b>the</b> <b>frontline</b> troops. Many of the soldiers had not slept for two nights, but the successful crossing was a morale booster, a tonic as he described it.|$|E
5|$|The 18th Battalion was {{training}} away from <b>the</b> <b>frontline</b> when the Armistice was declared on 11 November 1918. On 8 March 1919, Maxwell was invested with his Victoria Cross by King George V {{in the ballroom}} of Buckingham Palace.

5|$|The {{changing}} strengths {{between the}} two opponents prompted the Luftwaffe to make operational changes for the battle. Previous offensive campaigns had been initiated with Luftwaffe raids against opposing airfields to achieve air superiority. By {{this point in the}} war Red Army equipment reserves were extensive and the Luftwaffe commanders realised that aircraft could be easily replaced, making such raids futile. Therefore, this mission was abandoned. In addition, previous campaigns had made use of medium bombers flying well behind <b>the</b> <b>frontline</b> to block the arrival of reinforcements. This mission, however, was rarely attempted during Citadel.|$|E
5|$|Under the D-series Tables of Organization (TO) from 1 July 1942, {{the role}} of AT weapons in Marine Corps service was officially {{entrusted}} to 20mm automatic guns, which were in the regimental weapon company (three platoons) and the battalion weapon company (one platoon). In practice, units used the World War I-era 37 mm M1916 for training. They were equipped with the M3 (four in each platoon) before being sent to <b>the</b> <b>frontline.</b> Additionally, a divisional special weapons battalion was equipped with self-propelled 37 mm GMC M6.|$|E
5|$|After a few days, {{the main}} {{thrust of the}} {{offensive}} was halted south of Rimini by strong resistance and severe weather, and the British and Indian flanking forces began to push westwards, taking <b>the</b> <b>frontline</b> towards San Marino. On 17 September the 4th Indian Infantry Division attacked forces of the 278. Infanterie-Division holding two hills just across the Sammarinese border; after heavy fighting to gain control of the hills, the situation stabilised on the 19th, and Allied forces began to push into the city of San Marino itself. The city was captured by the afternoon of 20 September, and the 4th Indian Division left the country on the 21st, leaving it {{under the control of the}} local defence forces.|$|E
