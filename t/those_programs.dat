5|$|The table below lists {{stations}} that carried Paramount Television Network programs, including the company's two owned-and-operated stations, KTLA and WBKB. DuMont's three VHF stations, WABD, WTTG and WDTV, which aired {{little or no}} Paramount programming but which the FCC ruled were O of the same entity, also appear in this list. Also included are DuMont's two short-lived UHF licenses: KCTY-TV – which only operated for a few months, and WHK-TV – which never signed on. A number of stations carried Armchair Detective, Sandy Dreams and Frosty Frolics when <b>those</b> <b>programs</b> aired on CBS and ABC.

5|$|Most {{software}} {{that runs on}} Linux can run on FreeBSD using an optional built-in compatibility layer. Hence, most Linux binaries can be run on FreeBSD, including some proprietary applications distributed only in binary form. This compatibility layer is not an emulation; Linux's system call interface is implemented in the FreeBSD's kernel and hence, Linux executable images and shared libraries are treated the same as FreeBSD's native executable images and shared libraries. Additionally, FreeBSD provides compatibility layers for several other Unix-like operating systems, in addition to Linux, such as BSD/OS and SVR4, however, it is more common for users to compile <b>those</b> <b>programs</b> directly on FreeBSD.|$|E

The relation between the results of the shown abilities for learning the pro­gram contents of fine arts and the objectively shown abilities for the applied tests have to be the basis for creating program contents adjusted for psycho-motor abilities for each pupil, and the working results can adequately be evaluated, i. e. the students can be assessed...|$|R

Wildwood, New Jersey-based NBC affiliate WMGM-TV (channel 40) picked up the pre-empted ABC shows until 1987, when <b>those</b> <b>programs</b> moved back to channel 29, which was now WTXF-TV. The preempted programs were usually magazine shows, game shows or reruns of ABC primetime sitcoms. By the early 1990s, WPVI preempted only the first half-hour of The Home Show.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of ABC losing Monday Night Football to now-sister network ESPN in the 2000s, WPVI has aired the Philadelphia Eagles' preseason and Monday night games, {{as well as the}} team's coaches' show (<b>those</b> <b>programs</b> moved to WCAU-TV in 2015). However, in recent years, the Monday games have aired on news partner WPHL, while WPVI has opted to air the regularly-scheduled ABC programming, which {{includes}} the popular Dancing with the Stars. The Eagles' remaining games are split between KYW-TV (CBS), WCAU-TV (NBC) and WTXF-TV (Fox) through their respectively owned networks' NFL broadcast rights and NFL Network through its Thursday Night Football package.

25|$|Older {{mainframe}} databases, and {{the newer}} microcomputer based systems that {{were based on}} them, generally {{did not have a}} SQL-like command processor between the user and the database engine. Instead, the data was accessed directly by the program – a programming library in the case of large mainframe systems, or a command line interface or interactive forms system in the case of dBASE and similar applications. Data from dBASE could not generally be accessed directly by other programs running on the machine. <b>Those</b> <b>programs</b> may be given a way to access this data, often through libraries, but it would not work with any other database engine, or even different databases in the same engine. In effect, all such systems were static, which presented considerable problems.|$|E
