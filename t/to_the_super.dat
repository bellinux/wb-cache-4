5|$|The format {{used in the}} 2007 World Cup {{involved}} 16 teams allocated {{into four}} groups of four. Within each group, the teams played {{each other in a}} round-robin format. Teams earned points for wins and half-points for ties. The top two teams from each group moved forward <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Super</b> 8 round. The Super 8 teams played the other six teams that progressed from the different groups. Teams earned points {{in the same way as}} the group stage, but carried their points forward from previous matches against the other teams who qualified from the same group <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Super</b> 8 stage. The top four teams from the Super 8 round advanced to the semi-finals, and the winners of the semi-finals played in the final.|$|E

As they advanced, the teams carried their points forward from previous matches against other teams advancing alongside them, giving them an incentive to perform well in the group stages. The top four teams from the Super 6 stage progressed to the semi-finals, with the winners playing in the final.|$|E
