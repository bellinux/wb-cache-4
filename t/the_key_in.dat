5|$|In Sir Thursday, {{readers are}} also {{introduced}} to the power issues that Arthur begins to struggle with – his natural compassion and desire for fairness and kindness, against the characteristics displayed by other senior denizens and Dame Primus, {{and the influence of}} <b>the</b> <b>key.</b> <b>In</b> addition, the idea of Arthur losing his mortality and becoming an immortal Denizen of the House, represented by the silver/gold crocodile ring that was introduced in Drowned Wednesday, is further explored, with Arthur often choosing to refrain from using the key – and the power it represents – to ensure he remains human.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Desmond and Locke {{discuss the}} purpose of the {{stations}} and discover that when Desmond accidentally allowed the timer to run out, the magnetic force pulled Oceanic Flight 815 toward the island, thus causing the crash. Locke continues to doubt that the timer has any meaning, but Desmond assures him that it is all real. As the timer passes zero, Desmond retrieves a failsafe key and crawls underneath the hatch, saying he will blow the dam. After he turns <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>in</b> the system termination switch, a shrill humming noise and violet-white light envelops the entire island, causing the Oceanic 815 survivors and the Others alike {{on opposite sides of the}} island to bend in apparent pain. That night, Charlie is the only person to return from the hatch; the whereabouts of Desmond, Eko, and Locke are not revealed. Charlie reconnects with Claire Littleton (Emilie de Ravin), and they kiss as they sit among their fellow plane survivors.|$|E

5|$|On {{board the}} Forerunner ship, the Master Chief is {{captured}} and interrogated by Covenant forces, but manages to escape using a concealed weapon. On Earth, Ruwan and Tyla escape detection by the Covenant and appropriate a vehicle {{in an effort}} to escape. Ruwan reveals that the Key is in fact a fictional object that he and his brother James Ackerson made up as children; James told the Covenant about <b>the</b> <b>Key</b> <b>in</b> order to prevent the outright destruction of Cleveland. After fighting Covenant forces, Ruwan and Tyla are rescued by marines and leave the city. The Master Chief attempts to kill the Covenant's leader, Prophet of Truth, but is discovered as he takes aim; Truth escapes as the Chief is left to kill the Prophet's guards and find a way off the ship. Learning {{that there is no way}} to change the Forerunner ship's destination, the Chief jumps to Earth using a piece of the vessel as a heat shield.|$|E
5|$|With {{the news}} of Khalid's arrival, Abu Ubaidah ordered Shurhabil ibn Hasana, {{one of the four}} corps commanders, to attack the city of Bosra. The latter laid siege to Bosra with his army of 4,000 men. The Byzantine and Christian Arab {{garrison}} which outnumbered Shurhabil's forces, made a sally and were likely to annihilate them when Khalid's cavalry arrived from the desert and attacked the rear of the Byzantine forces, relieving Shurhabil. The garrison retreated to the city's fortress. Abu Ubaidah joined Khalid at Bosra and Khalid, as per the caliph's instructions, took over the supreme command. The fortress of Bosra surrendered in mid-July 634, effectively ending the Ghassanid dynasty. After capturing Bosra, Khalid instructed all the corps to join him at Ajnadayn where they fought a decisive battle against the Byzantines on 30 July 634. Modern historians consider this battle to have been <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>in</b> breaking Byzantine power in Syria.|$|E

25|$|The label {{consists}} of a molecule called ubiquitin. This fastens to the protein to be destroyed, accompanies it to the proteasome where it is recognised as <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>in</b> a lock, and signals that a protein {{is on the way}} for disassembly. Shortly before the protein is squeezed into the proteasome, its ubiquitin label is disconnected for re-use. Examples of processes governed by ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation are cell division, DNA repair, quality control of newly produced proteins, and important parts of the immune defence.|$|E
25|$|More formally, {{the data}} being sorted can be {{represented}} as a record or tuple of values, and {{the part of the}} data that is used for sorting is called <b>the</b> <b>key.</b> <b>In</b> the card example, cards are represented as a record (rank, suit), and the key is the rank. A sorting algorithm is stable if whenever there are two records R and S with the same key, and R appears before S in the original list, then R will always appear before S in the sorted list.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, Alex Biryukov, Adi Shamir and David Wagner {{showed that}} A5/1 can be cryptanalysed {{in real time}} using a time-memory {{tradeoff}} attack, based on earlier work by Jovan Golic. One tradeoff allows an attacker to reconstruct <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>in</b> one second from two minutes of known plaintext or in several minutes from two seconds of known plain text, but he must first complete an expensive preprocessing stage which requires 248 steps to compute around 300 GB of data. Several tradeoffs between preprocessing, data requirements, attack time and memory complexity are possible.|$|E

25|$|Also, most of {{the coins}} of the Greek kings in India were bilingual, written in Greek {{on the front and}} in Pali on the back (in the Kharosthi script, derived from Aramaic, rather than the more eastern Brahmi, which was used only once on coins of Agathocles of Bactria), a {{tremendous}} concession to another culture never before made in the Hellenic world. From the reign of Apollodotus II, around 80 BC, Kharosthi letters started to be used as mintmarks on coins in combination with Greek monograms and mintmarks, suggesting the participation of local technicians to the minting process. Incidentally, these bilingual coins of the Indo-Greeks were <b>the</b> <b>key</b> <b>in</b> the decipherment of the Kharoshthi script by James Prinsep (1799–1840). Kharoshthi became extinct around the 3rd century AD.|$|E
25|$|The carillonneur or carillonist is {{the title}} of the {{musician}} who plays the carillon. The carillonneur usually sits in a cabin beneath the bells and presses down, with a loosely closed fist, on a series of baton-like keys arranged in the same pattern as a piano keyboard. The batons are almost never played with the fingers as one does a piano, though this is sometimes used as a special carillon playing technique. The keys activate levers and wires that connect directly to the bells' clappers; thus, as with a piano, the carillonneur can vary the intensity of the note according to the force applied to <b>the</b> <b>key.</b> <b>In</b> addition to the manual keys, the heavier bells are also played with a pedal keyboard. These notes can either be played with the hands or the feet.|$|E
