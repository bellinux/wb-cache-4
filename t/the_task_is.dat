30|$|In case A, {{the product}} backlog {{was located in}} Excel and it {{was derived from the}} {{schedule}} in MS Project. The iteration backlog was a physical whiteboard, where <b>the</b> <b>tasks</b> <b>were</b> printed from Excel. In the beginning, the whiteboard was similar to a Kanban board consisting of to-do, doing, and done, and each project had their own boards. During the pilot project, the board was changed to represent every day of the iteration and <b>the</b> <b>tasks</b> <b>were</b> allocated on a daily basis for each developer, in order to better visualize the amount of work spent in each project during the iteration. When <b>the</b> <b>task</b> <b>was</b> finished, <b>the</b> <b>task</b> <b>was</b> turned upside-down for visualization of the progress.|$|R
5|$|An early {{algorithmic}} use of pseudoforests {{involves the}} network simplex algorithm and {{its application to}} generalized flow problems modeling the conversion between commodities of different types. In these problems, one is given as input a flow network in which the vertices model each commodity and the edges model allowable conversions between one commodity and another. Each edge is marked with a capacity (how much of a commodity can be converted per unit time), a flow multiplier (the conversion rate between commodities), and a cost (how much loss or, if negative, profit is incurred per unit of conversion). <b>The</b> <b>task</b> <b>is</b> {{to determine how much}} of each commodity to convert via each edge of the flow network, in order to minimize cost or maximize profit, while obeying the capacity constraints and not allowing commodities of any type to accumulate unused. This type of problem can be formulated as a linear program, and solved using the simplex algorithm. The intermediate solutions arising from this algorithm, as well as the eventual optimal solution, have a special structure: each edge in the input network is either unused or used to its full capacity, except for a subset of the edges, forming a spanning pseudoforest of the input network, for which the flow amounts may lie between zero and the full capacity. In this application, unicyclic graphs are also sometimes called augmented trees and maximal pseudoforests are also sometimes called augmented forests.|$|E
5|$|In , Sora and Riku {{undertake}} a Mark of Mastery exam {{in response to}} Xehanort's return. The two are sent to awaken several worlds submerged in sleep after the defeat of Ansem, but once <b>the</b> <b>task</b> <b>is</b> complete, Sora's heart is damaged by Xemnas, whose companions plan to turn him into a vessel for Xehanort's heart. Riku and his friends save Sora and {{bring him back to}} Yen Sid's tower, where Riku dives into Sora's body and repairs his heart, awakening him from his coma. As Yen Sid promotes Riku as a Keyblade Master, Sora congratulates him and continues to train elsewhere. In the ending of Kingdom Hearts 0.2 Birth by Sleep – A Fragmentary Passage for Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue, Yen Sid reveals Sora lost most of his powers when Xehanort tried to take over his body. After advising Sora to seek out one who already went through a similar experience, Sora, Donald, and Goofy go to Olympus Coliseum.|$|E

In each task, participants performed two subtasks, namely, fixed speed and max speed subtasks. In the fixed speed subtask, participants performed one tap per second in time with a digital metronome (frequency: 1  Hz). In the max speed subtask, {{the participants were asked}} to tap the buttons as quick as they possibly could.

25|$|Groups {{also affect}} {{performance}} and productivity. Social facilitation, for example, {{is a tendency}} to work harder and faster in the presence of others. Social facilitation increases the dominant responses likelihood, which tends to improve performance on simple tasks and reduce it on complex tasks. In contrast, social loafing is the tendency of individuals to slack off when working in a group. Social loafing is common when <b>the</b> <b>task</b> <b>is</b> considered unimportant and individual contributions are not easy to see.|$|E
