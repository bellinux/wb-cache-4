In this paper we aim to offer a solution in the selection of the K-best disjoint paths through a network by using graph theoretic techniques. The basic approach is to map an arbitrary network graph into a trellis graph which allows the application of computationally efficient methods to find disjoint paths. Use of the knowledge of the K-best disjoint paths for improving the survivability of ATM networks at the virtual path and virtual circuit level is discussed.

We {{study the}} problem <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> in a {{population}} structured by a continuum vari-able corresponding to the quantity being <b>transferred.</b> The <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> the <b>quantity</b> occurs between individuals according to specified rules.

50|$|The {{system is}} delimited by walls or boundaries, either actual or notional, across which conserved (such as matter and energy) or unconserved (such as entropy) {{quantities}} can pass {{into and out}} of the system. The space outside the thermodynamic system is known as the surroundings, a reservoir, or the environment. The properties of the walls determine what transfers can occur. A wall that allows <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> a <b>quantity</b> is said to be permeable to it, and a thermodynamic system is classified by the permeabilities of its several walls. A transfer between system and surroundings can arise by contact, such as conduction of heat, or by long-range forces such as an electric field in the surroundings.|$|R
50|$|A contact {{equilibrium}} may {{be regarded}} also as an exchange equilibrium. There is a zero balance <b>of</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> some <b>quantity</b> {{between the two}} systems in contact equilibrium. For example, for a wall permeable only to heat, the rates of diffusion of internal energy as heat between the two systems are equal and opposite. An adiabatic wall between the two systems is 'permeable' only to energy transferred as work; at mechanical equilibrium the rates <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> energy as work between them are equal and opposite. If the wall is a simple wall, then the rates <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> volume across it are also equal and opposite; and the pressures {{on either side of}} it are equal. If the adiabatic wall is more complicated, with a sort of leverage, having an area-ratio, then the pressures of the two systems in exchange equilibrium are in the inverse ratio of the volume exchange ratio; this keeps the zero balance <b>of</b> rates <b>of</b> <b>transfer</b> as work.|$|R

One gets a much better agreement between observed and calculated transfer or relaxation cross-sections using Veff 2 rather than the Van der Waal's potential (no parameter has been adjusted in either case). The only failure of Veff 2 calculations bears on orientation transfer cross-sections; it suggests that close range collisions play a more significant role in this process than assumed here.

Four variations of the ant colony optimisation meta-heuristic that explore different construction modelling choices are developed. The effects of solution component assignment order and the form of local search heuristics are also investigated. The results reveal that each of the approaches can return optimal solution costs in a reasonable amount of computational time. This may be largely attributed to the combination of integer linear preprocessing, powerful multiple neighbourhood local search heuristic and the good starting solutions provided by the ant colonies...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The aim {{of this research is}} to improve the efficiency of the construction process through the application of electronic data interchange (EDI). This thesis describes the development and application of EDI messages. The messages described are targeted to provide a means for transferring construction specific information during the construction process. The definition of electronic data interchange and its technical issues are first described. The nature of EDI, replacing paper based communication with electronic messages, impacts on the way in which business is conducted, and also has far reaching legal implications due to the reliance of many legal systems on paper documents and signatures. The business and legal implications are therefore discussed in detail. The application of EDI in the construction industry is investigated by means of a literature review. This work is furthered by a longitudinal study of the construction industry's application of EDI, which consisted of two surveys at a five year interval. A model of the information flows within the traditional construction process is developed to assist in the identification of information flows suitable for EDI. A methodology for message development was produced. The methodology was then applied to develop a description data model that could be utilised in the existing bill <b>of</b> <b>quantity</b> and trading cycle messages. The bill <b>of</b> <b>quantity</b> message set was at a stage ready for trial. To determine the issues related to implementation specifically in the construction industry a trial implementation of this message set was undertaken. The official implementation undertaken by EDICON is described. Software was also developed to undertake the trial. This software was tested and proved the message set developed was suitable for the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> bill <b>of</b> <b>quantity</b> related information during a construction project. The factors causing the failure of the implementation of the bill <b>of</b> <b>quantities</b> message set are discussed. A number of these factors are considered valid for all construction project information flows. Finally, the use of shared project models to re-engineer construction information tasks is recommended as a means of achieving significant benefit from electronic data exchange in the construction process...|$|R

Studies {{of forest}} {{ecosystems}} {{have indicated that}} internal sources constitute a significant component of the acid load to forest soils and can result in significant decreases in soil pH, acid neutralising capacity and base status. Despite this, the possibility that these processes {{can result in a}} significant <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> acidity to drainage solutions and consequently to associated surface waters has, to a large extent, been discounted due to the self-limiting nature of " natural" acidification processes which purportedly do not involve significant concentrations of the strong acid anions NO₃⁻, SO₄²⁻ and Cl⁻. In South Africa, extensive plantations of Pinus spp. (pine) are developed in mountainous regions that were previously covered by grassland or fynbos (macchia) vegetation and are mostly not believed to be influenced by significant atmospheric pollution. Thus, a good opportunity exists to study the effects of afforestation without the superimposed influence of acid deposition.

The study focuses specifically on factors relating to the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> soil acidity to drainage waters. The key questions that are addressed are : 1) to what extent is soil acidification, as previously documented for plantations in the eastern seaboard region of southern Africa, prevalent in other forestry areas within South Africa?; 2) in the absence of acid deposition, can afforestation cause enhanced concentrations of strong acid anions in soil solutions and drainage waters, and can this lead to the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> large <b>quantities</b> <b>of</b> acidity from forest soils to surface waters ?; 3) does afforestation-induced acidification lead to increased concentrations of environmentally important metals such as Al and Mn in soil solutions and surface waters ?; and 4) how does afforestation affect the <b>quantity</b> <b>of</b> dissolved organic matter in soils and streams...|$|R
