5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the year}} the Americans felt that they were better {{prepared}} to deliver destruction <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> system. During Commando Hunt III (1 November 1969 to 30 April 1970), the Air Force claimed that 6,428 enemy trucks destroyed and another 3,604 damaged. 60 aircraft were shot down during this phase of the campaign by an estimated 743 anti-aircraft weapons. This increased number of aircraft losses forced the Air Force to decree that flak suppression missions would accompany the bombers on missions over the trail. Armed with cluster bomb units (CBUs), the fighter bombers were poised to pounce upon any enemy anti-aircraft positions identified by other aircraft.|$|E

5|$|United States {{officials}} had only estimates of its enemy's capabilities; intelligence collection agencies often conflicted with each other. Thanks to improvements <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> system (including opening new routes that would {{connect to the}} Sihanouk Trail in Cambodia), the amount of supplies transported during 1965 almost equaled the combined total for the previous five years. During the year interdiction of the system {{had become one of}} the top American priorities, but operations against it were complicated by the limited forces available at the time and Laos's ostensible neutrality.|$|E

25|$|As an {{alternative}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> {{called for by}} the act, hikers have adopted a route that utilizes existing roads and inland trails. The trail currently follows State Highway One and the Old Coast Road from Bixby Bridge. The trail south of Bixby Creek enters Brazil Ranch, which requires permission to enter. From Brazil Ranch the trail drops back to Highway One at Andrew Molera State Park. From Highway One, the trail then follows the Coast Ridge Road from the Ventana Inn area to Kirk Creek Campground. The trail then moves inland and follows the Cruikshank and Buckeye trails on the Santa Lucia Mountain ridges to the San Luis Obispo County line.|$|E
25|$|Positioned {{with its}} open mouth toward the enemy advance, {{this was a}} {{favorite}} of the VC. It was used in both fairly open terrain as well as jungle. The ambushers, in good concealment along the legs of the 'V', would wait until the enemy point had passed and then creep close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail.</b> The 'V' ambush was virtually undetectable by enemy point or flank security until at least a portion of the enemy force was in the kill zone. Enfilading fire was often directed down the enemy axis of advance, and interlocking fire from each leg across the 'V'. The 'V' ambush also lent itself to the use of controlled mines and booby traps.|$|E

25|$|The Arboretum Trail is {{a walking}} trail winding through {{a wooded area}} {{on the west side}} of the grounds. The trail takes walkers past 60-million-year-old petrified tree stumps from the Amidon, North Dakota area, as well as 75 {{different}} species of trees and shrubs which are all labeled with ground plaques. Various statues and memorials are also on the trail. The trail was created in 1985 in anticipation of the state's centennial and also as an opportunity for state employees and the general public to exercise while learning about various trees and the history of the buildings on the grounds. Many area schools take their students <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> for nature walks and students in the past have used the various trees for leaf collections. This damaged some of the trees, so signs that forbid leaf picking were posted.|$|E
25|$|Toward {{the end of}} the 19th {{century the}} philologist Paul Kretschmer made a strong case that Pelasgian was a pre-Greek substrate, perhaps Anatolian, taking up a {{classical}} theme of remnant populations existing in pockets among the Greek speakers, in mountainous and rural Arcadia and in inaccessible coasts of the far south. This view left Müller's proto-Greeks without a homeland, but Kretschmer did not substitute the Heracleidae or their Dorian allies from Macedon and Thessaly. Instead he removed the earliest Greeks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> leading from the plains of Asia, where he viewed the Proto-Indo-European language as having broken up about 2500 BC. Kretschmer suggested that somewhere between that Asian homeland and Greece a new cradle of the Greek tribes developed, from which Proto-Ionians at about 2000 BC, Proto-Achaeans at about 1600 BC and Dorians at about 1200 BC came to swoop down on an increasingly less aboriginal Greece as three waves of external Greeks.|$|E

500|$|Breyer cites several {{watershed}} {{moments in}} Supreme Court history to show why {{the consequences of}} a particular ruling should always be in a judge's mind.

[...] He also cites to the Dred Scott decision, which was an important precursor to the American Civil War.

500|$|In 2006, a local {{businessman}} donated {{an antique}} caboose <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> Association; this was placed beside the pavilion. Built in 1915, it was [...] "one of... the first cabooses {{made of steel}} instead of wood". An October2007 study of paint chips from the caboose found the paint contained lead. The study was released {{less than a week}} before a town supervisor election in Lloyd; one of the candidates, Ray Costantino, was president of the Hudson Valley Rail Trail Association, and one of the early proponents of the trail. He claimed the timing of the study was politically motivated. Costantino subsequently became town supervisor, and the caboose had its paint replaced and was repaired at a total cost of $4,500. A second caboose, dating from 1926, is located at the trail's parking lot on Haviland Road.|$|E
500|$|The {{design of}} the road was re-envisioned to include {{extensive}} wetland protection west of the parkway and in the parkway median, a trail system {{along the side of}} the parkway, and numerous pedestrian overpasses and underpasses for ease of access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> system. Many of the architectural features were also specially-designed to give the parkway a unique feel. There are a total of [...] of protected areas to the west of the highway, and an additional [...] of wetlands along the length of the highway. The Legacy Nature Preserve lays along the western border of the parkway near its southern terminus. Further north, the parkway forms much of the eastern border of the Farmington Bay Waterfowl Management Area. For the entirety of the parkway's length it is paralleled by the Legacy Parkway Trail, and is partially paralleled by the Denver and Rio Grande Western rail trail.|$|E
500|$|The Sublette-Greenwood Cutoff {{was opened}} in 1844 by the Stephens-Townsend-Murphy Party led by {{mountain}} men Caleb Greenwood and Isaac Hitchcock. Hitchcock, an old trapper {{and one of}} the first of his kind to have been in California in 1832, recommended that the wagon trail go due west from the Little Sandy and cross [...] of desert territory to the Green River and from there cross the ridge into the Bear River Valley, completely bypassing Fort Bridger and the crossing of Bear River Ridge. The route shaved about [...] and 7 days off the main route, but the decision to cross nearly 45 waterless miles before reaching the Green River was not one to be taken lightly. Settlers had to decide between time and the health of their livestock. A traveler in 1846 wrote: [...] The route reached the height of popularity during the California Gold Rush of the 1850s when a desire to speed to the California gold fields outweighed the risks. The route was named the Sublette cutoff by Joseph Ware in his popular 1849 guide book <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail</b> after an individual named Solomon Sublette who told him about the route, and not William Sublette as is popular myth. The popularity of the guide book during the 1850s cemented the name, though most scholars today call it the Sublette-Greenwood Cutoff after its original discoverer.|$|E

500|$|In early June, Nixon {{continued}} {{to be regarded as}} the favorite to win the nomination, but observers noted that he had not yet locked up the nomination. He still faced challenges from Nelson Rockefeller and Ronald Reagan, and was not on the ballot in California, where Reagan won a large slate of delegates. Behind the scenes, Nixon staff lobbied for delegates from [...] "favorite son" [...] candidates, resulting, in the backing of Senator Howard Baker of Tennessee, and his 28 pledged delegates, as well as those 58 delegates supporting Senator Charles Percy of Illinois. After the assassination of Robert Kennedy, like the other candidates, Nixon took a break from campaigning. Reports suggested that the assassination all but assured his nomination. Upon returning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trail,</b> Nixon found that Rockefeller had begun attacking him. Rockefeller described Nixon as a man [...] "of the old politics" [...] who has [...] "great natural capacity not to do the right thing, especially under pressure." [...] Nixon refused to respond to the jabs, stating that he would not participate in attacks. As he edged closer to the nomination, discussions about his running mate arose. Republicans in the Midwest pushed for Mayor John Lindsay of New York City. The endorsement of Nixon by Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon raised speculation that he might be chosen. Congressman George Bush of Texas and Senator Percy were also mentioned as possible selections. At the end of the month, Nixon had two thirds of the required 667 delegates necessary to win the nomination.|$|E
500|$|On July 20, 2012, Moore {{was traded}} to the Houston Rockets in a three team deal between the Celtics, Rockets and Portland Trail Blazers that sent Moore, JaJuan Johnson, Sean Williams and Jon Diebler to the Rockets, Courtney Lee to the Celtics and Sasha Pavlović <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Trail</b> Blazers [...] He was waived by the Rockets shortly afterwards. On September 6, 2012, he signed with the Orlando Magic. With Jameer Nelson and Hedo Türkoğlu {{beginning}} the season injured for the 2012–13 Orlando Magic, Moore began the 2012–13 NBA season as a starter. Moore posted a career-high 17 points on November 6, 2012, against the Chicago Bulls. He topped this with 18 points on November 6 against the Brooklyn Nets. Nelson returned to the starting lineup on November 16 after missing the first six games of the season. On December 28, Moore suffered an elbow sprain when he and Cartier Martin landed on his arm during a loose ball scramble against the Washington Wizards. The injury made his status day-to-day. Moore was unable to play the following night. He did not practice with the team again until January 13. Moore returned to the lineup the following day. He again scored 18 points to tie his career high on January 28 against the Detroit Pistons. When Nelson incurred a bruised left forearm, Moore returned to the starting lineup on February 2 against the Milwaukee Bucks. As a starter on February 4, he again tied his career high with 18 points against Philadelphia 76ers. Although Nelson returned to the starting lineup after two starts, J. J. Redick was injured prior to the game on February 4 and Arron Afflalo continued to be injured, necessitating Moore's continued role as a starter. On February 13, both Redick and Afflalo returned to the lineup, relegating Moore to a reserve role. On February 21, the Magic traded away Redick, and Nelson was diagnosed with a strained left knee patella tendon. Thus, Moore returned to the starting lineup on February 22. On March 1, Moore posted a career-high 11 assists against the Houston Rockets. On March 5, Nelson returned to the starting lineup.|$|E
