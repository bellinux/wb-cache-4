5|$|The {{garden was}} {{saved by the}} Member of {{parliament}} Albert Grant, who purchased the park in 1874 for £11,060 and donated it to the Metropolitan Board of Works. The title deed for the square passed to the succeeding public bodies {{and is now in}} the ownership of the City of Westminster. After the purchase, the architect James Knowles redesigned the park. A statue of William Shakespeare surrounded by dolphins was constructed in the centre. The four corner gates of the park had one bust each of famous former residents in the square: the scientist Sir Isaac Newton designed by W. Calder Marshall; Sir Joshua Reynolds, the first President of the Royal Academy by H. Weekes; John Hunter, a pioneer of surgery, by T. Wooler; and William Hogarth, the painter, by J. Durham. Ownership transferred to Westminster City Council in 1933. The most recent addition was a bronze statue of film star and director Charlie Chaplin, designed by sculptor John Doubleday in 1981. On the pavement were inscribed the distances in miles to several Commonwealth countries, including Canada, Kenya and Jamaica. After <b>the</b> <b>Great</b> <b>Outdoors</b> refurbishment of the square, only the statue of Shakespeare still remains.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century, Pau was still a resort town where European nobility spent the winter. Good English, American, Russian, Spanish or Prussian society met in the Béarnaise city. Many public amenities were from this period, including the Pau Funicular to connect the station to the upper town. Next to these public amenities, wealthy foreign visitors were building villas to improve the conditions of their stay. First built in the centre of town, these residences spread out more and more to enjoy <b>the</b> <b>great</b> <b>outdoors</b> and popular views of the Pyrenees. Between 1850 and 1910, many residences were thus built and still evoke the splendour of this period, today.

40|$|Abstract : In {{his study}} of the territorialisation of a natural {{climbing}} site by a small group of climbers, E. de Léséleuc described the construction and operation of a community type of organisation that was particularly closed to other participants and anchored in a public space that the members of the « community » were tending to privatise. According to the author, this form of collective withdrawal, based on defensive territorialisation, is an essential component of so-called sports of <b>the</b> « <b>great</b> <b>outdoors</b> ». Drawing on two earlier unpublished studies on this question, the present article discusses the possible generalisation, in the field of rock climbing, of this social and spatial configuration. We identify the specific characteristics of this physical activity and the diversity and complexity of socio-spatial forms of organisation associated with it, enabling us to put into perspective the role of a « defensive communitarianism » that might be assumed to be dominant.

40|$|Parks {{are places}} for recreation, and that {{suggests}} play, leisure, sport. Many parks are of exactly that kind, and fortunately so; {{we need our}} city parks for softball games, our state parks for a family reunion. Recreation re-creates, rejuvenates people when they are worn from work. But outdoor, natural parks are much more, and more fortunately so. These grander parks in <b>the</b> <b>greater</b> <b>outdoors</b> provide dimensions of depth belied by their vacational and recreational settings. Parks are places so protected that we can simultane-ously get "away from it all, " away from the workaday week, from the labors of town, factory, farm, and "back to it all, " encountering the park-protected reserves of elemental nature. This is recreation, if you like, but this recreation is set within creation. Some of the recreation is relaxation, unwinding from daily labors; deeper down the re-creation is restoration of perspective {{on the nature of}} life, reen-counter with the creation. Parks recreation preserves human life by re-creat-ing it. We figure out who we are and where we are. The last part of that ques-tion must be answered in culture, for human life is "by nature " cultural. But the first part, the fundamental ground, is answered in nature. "By nature, " too, we are embodied creatures, residents on landscapes, earthlings, placed in a more inclusive, more comprehensive community of life and life support. In that sense, parks protect a full {{answer to the question of}} human identity. Parks are philosophical places; let's play with that idea. "Know thyself. " Socrates insisted: "An unexamined life is not worth living " (Plato, Apology: 38). On that score he was quite right. Socrates also said, "You see, I am fond of learning. Now the country places and trees won't teach me anything, and the people in the city do " (Plato, Phaedrus: 230 d). So he loved his Athens, and we indeed ought to be good citizens. But Socrates was quite wrong about learnin...|$|R
