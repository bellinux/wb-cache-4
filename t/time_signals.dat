5|$|WWV is {{the call}} {{sign of the}} United States National Institute of Standards and Technology's (NIST) HF ("shortwave") radio station located near Fort Collins, Colorado. WWV {{continuously}} transmits official U.S. Government frequency and <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> on 2.5, 5, 10, 15, and 20 MHz. The 25 MHz frequency was last used in 2014 on an experimental basis. It was later dropped due to an insufficient solar flux level needed for propagation of the higher HF or shortwave frequencies. This condition began {{to occur in the}} latter years of the current sunspot cycle 24.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, WWV {{was nearly}} shut down. Its signal could only cover {{the eastern half}} of the United States, and other {{stations}} located in Minneapolis and at Stanford University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology were slowly making WWV redundant. The station's impending shutdown was announced in 1926, but it was saved by a flood of protests from citizens who relied on the service. Later, in 1931, WWV underwent an upgrade. Its transmitter, now directly controlled by a quartz oscillator, was moved to College Park, Maryland. Broadcasts began on 5MHz. A year later, the station was moved again, to Department of Agriculture land in Beltsville, Maryland. Broadcasts were added on 10 and 15MHz, power was increased, and <b>time</b> <b>signals,</b> an A440 tone, and ionosphere reports were all added to the broadcast in June 1937.|$|E
5|$|WWV {{had been}} {{broadcasting}} second pulses since 1937, but these pulses were {{not tied to}} actual time. In June 1944, the United States Naval Observatory allowed WWV to use the USNO's clock {{as a source for}} its <b>time</b> <b>signals.</b> Over a year later, in October 1945, WWV broadcast Morse code time announcements every five minutes. Voice announcements started on January 1, 1950, and were broadcast every five minutes. Frequencies of 600Hz and 440Hz were broadcast during alternating minutes. By this time, WWV was broadcasting on 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35MHz. The 30 and 35MHz broadcasts were ended in 1953.|$|E
50|$|Daytime {{reception}} of overseas shortwave and longwave <b>time</b> <b>signal</b> services in Australia (and New Zealand) is rather poor as the nearest HF (and longwave) <b>time</b> <b>signal</b> services are BPM (China), JJY (Japan) and WWVH (Hawaii, USA).|$|R
5000|$|The signal {{consists}} {{of a series of}} 300 ms [...] "pips" [...] of an [...] sine wave tone, each one starting at the top of each UTC second, up to ten seconds before the hour, followed by silence, and then a one second-long 800 Hz tone to mark the top of the hour. The CBC <b>time</b> <b>signal</b> is typically delayed by about 300 ms with respect to the CHU <b>time</b> <b>signal,</b> because each CBC radio station receives the actual <b>time</b> <b>signal</b> from Ottawa by satellite.|$|R

The Bureau des Longitudes started daily <b>time</b> <b>signal</b> service starting in May 1910.|$|R
25|$|<b>Time</b> <b>signals,</b> on the contrary, are not {{a problem}} in a {{well-defined}} network with a fixed delay. The DAB multiplexer adds the proper offset to the distributed time information. The time information is also independent from the (possibly varying) audio decoding delay in receivers since the time is not embedded inside the audio frames. This means that built in clocks in receivers will be spot on.|$|E

25|$|Rosewater {{was also}} {{the site of the}} AdelaideRadio (VIA) {{maritime}} radio station system, the sixth built in Australia and one of 19 around the country. Opened 1 October 1912 it operated from 8am to midnight every day of the week, {{and was one of the}} first points of contact for ships sailing south from Hong Kong and Japan. Apart from its major function of listening for ships' messages, Adelaide also handled traffic to and from the State telegraph system, and broadcast <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> to shipping. By 1963 the rapid industrialisation of the Rosewater area had increased electrical interference to the point where a move to a new site became necessary and the operation was moved to McLaren Vale where it operated until 1993 when it was shut down.|$|E
25|$|A global {{navigation}} satellite system (GNSS) provides autonomous geo-spatial positioning with global coverage. A GNSS allows small electronic receivers {{to determine their}} location such as longitude, latitude, and altitude to within a few meters using <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> transmitted along a line of sight by radio from satellites in outer space. Receivers {{on the ground with}} a fixed position {{can also be used to}} calculate the precise time as a reference for scientific experiments. The first such system was Transit, developed by the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory under the leadership of Richard Kershner. Development of the system for the United States Navy began in 1958, and a prototype satellite,Transit 1A, was launched in September 1959. That satellite failed to reach orbit. A second satellite, Transit 1B, was successfully launched April 13, 1960 by a Thor-Ablestar rocket. The last Transit satellite launch was in August 1988.|$|E
25|$|The 1939 World's Fair had two seasons: {{one each}} in 1939 and 1940, {{which ended in}} the fall months of the year. Service for the first season ended on November 1, 1939, and during this season the line's {{ridership}} was 7,066,966. The IND World's Fair Line was closed between seasons, {{and at the end}} of the Fair the line was set to be demolished. The last train ran on October 28, 1940, three days before the closure of the Fair. While most of the fairgrounds were torn down soon after the event, the line remained intact for several months afterward. Queens borough president George U. Harvey proposed extending the line to serve the then-developing neighborhoods of Flushing, College Point, and Whitestone, along with the recently opened Queens College. This plan was supported by the local communities, elected officials in Queens, and the president of Queens College. It was deemed to be unfeasible, however, by the Board of Transportation due to the fact that the trestle was constructed to be temporary, and due to regulations at the time which required permanent lines for subway service to be built underground. Parks and highway commissioner Robert Moses, meanwhile, wished to utilize the right-of-way for the further development of Flushing Meadows Park and the extension of the Van Wyck Expressway towards the Whitestone Expressway and the Whitestone Bridge. Demolition of the line was authorized in December 1940, and on January 15, 1941, removal of the line commenced. The right-of-way was replaced with an extension of 136th Street, and eventually the northern portion of the Van Wyck Expressway which formed today's Interstate 678. Today, the seven grade <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> installed for the line in the Jamaica Yard leads, used to control revenue traffic, are now used instead to control yard traffic.|$|E

500|$|WWV's {{primary purpose}} today (and {{for most of}} its existence) is to {{disseminate}} the [...] "official U.S. time" [...] (provided by government entities such as NIST and USNO) to ensure that uniform time is maintained throughout the United States and around the world. The <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> generated by WWV allow time-keeping devices such as radio-controlled clocks to automatically maintain accurate time without the need for manual adjustment. These <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> are used by commercial and institutional interests where accuracy is essential and time plays a vital role in daily operations - these include shipping, transport, technology, research, education, military, public safety and telecommunications. It is of particular importance in broadcasting, whether it be commercial, public, or private interests such as amateur radio operators. WWV provides a public service by making time information readily available at all hours and at no monetary charge (other than the cost of the receiving equipment itself).|$|E
500|$|These carrier {{frequencies}} and <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> {{are controlled by}} local atomic clocks traceable to NIST's primary standard in Boulder, Colorado by GPS common view observations and other time transfer methods.

500|$|Chronometers were {{formerly}} {{used for}} the accurate determination of longitude by ships at sea. [...] By measuring the time of local solar noon compared {{to the time of}} noon at a reference point the difference in longitude can be directly found. [...] For this system to work, a timepiece showing the time at the reference point must be carried to the measuring point. [...] A timepiece intended to remain accurate while subjected to the motions of a ship at sea and through extreme changes in environment, especially temperature, is called a chronometer. [...] These were first built in the 18th century and were used extensively by mariners in the 19th century and into the 20th century, even after the widespread use of radio for <b>time</b> <b>signals</b> – the time signal was used to set the chronometer, but the instrument was still necessary to display the time.|$|E
