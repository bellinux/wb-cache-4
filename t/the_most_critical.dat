5|$|Although many {{messages}} were sent by agents, the Twenty Committee considered that Ironside was quite unrealistic {{and as a}} result was cautious about promoting it too heavily. Most of the information was sent with words of caution or uncertainty to ensure that the agent would not be compromised. One of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>critical</b> Bodyguard agents, Garbo, did become involved on 5 June, but only in forwarding the message of a fictional sub-agent who he had already identified as unreliable (MI5 hoped that this would cover for, in their opinion, the implausible nature of the story). The agent's report explained that a US division based in Liverpool was preparing to head to Bordeaux.|$|E
5|$|At Los Alamos, Bradbury became head of E-5, the Implosion Experimentation Group, {{which put}} him {{in charge of the}} {{implosion}} field test program. In August, the laboratory's director, Robert Oppenheimer, implemented a sweeping reorganisation. E-5 became part of George Kistiakowsky's new Explosives Division (X Division), and was renumbered X-1. At this point, Bradbury was leading some of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>critical</b> work at the laboratory, as it struggled with the jets that spoiled the perfect spherical shape desired for the implosion process. These were examined with a combination of magnetic, X-ray and RaLa techniques.|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this {{research}} is the development of a success model of Knowledge Sharing 2. 0 (social knowledge sharing) through organizations. A three-step strategy is used in this research as stated below: In the first step, identification of social software and extraction of factors effective on success of each for knowledge sharing were obtained from literature review. Execution of Delphi method and identification of critical factors were done in the second step. At last, in the third step, a success model was developed based on the obtained results. According to the results obtained from this study, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> important social software in order of their importance for knowledge sharing along with <b>the</b> <b>most</b> significant success factor of each in knowledge sharing are known to be: social network software (<b>the</b> <b>most</b> important <b>critical</b> success factor: active presence of experts and influential individuals in the desired field of knowledge in the social network), weblog software (<b>the</b> <b>most</b> important <b>critical</b> success factor: quality of existing information in the weblog), wiki software (<b>the</b> <b>most</b> important <b>critical</b> success factor: wiki configuration based on key fields of knowledge in organization), podcast software (<b>the</b> <b>most</b> important <b>critical</b> success factor: extent of applicability and practicality of the podcast contents), mashup software (<b>the</b> <b>most</b> important <b>critical</b> success factor: quality of information from mashup sources), tag software (<b>the</b> <b>most</b> important <b>critical</b> success factor: regular and intelligent updating) and RSS software (<b>the</b> <b>most</b> important <b>critical</b> success factor: continuous updating- 7 × 24). Based on the information available for the researchers, originality and innovation of the current work stem from two viewpoints: first, development of the critical success factors of the social software for knowledge sharing and second, development of the success model of Knowledge Sharing 2. 0. The proposed model can be used as an appropriate tool for evaluation of success, assessment of status, prediction and related pathologies in connection with establishment of Knowledge Sharing 2. 0 in organizations...|$|R

5|$|Despite his successes, when Edward I died in 1307 {{he left a}} {{range of}} {{challenges}} for his son to resolve. One of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>critical</b> was the problem of English rule in Scotland, where Edward's long but ultimately inconclusive military campaign was ongoing when he died. Edward's control of Gascony created tension with the French kings. They insisted that the English kings should give homage to them for the lands; the English kings saw this demand as insulting to their honour, and the issue remained unresolved. Edward I also faced increasing opposition from his barons over the taxation and requisitions required to resource his wars, and left his son debts of around £200,000 on his death.|$|E

From a production perspective, it found that fossil-fuel combustion processes, agriculture and fisheries have the most important impacts. Meanwhile, from a final consumption perspective, it found that household consumption related to mobility, shelter, food and energy-using products cause the majority of life-cycle impacts of consumption.|$|E
5|$|The {{depth and}} {{duration}} of each stop is calculated to reduce the inert gas excess in <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>critical</b> tissues to a concentration which will allow further ascent without unacceptable risk. Consequently, {{if there is not}} much dissolved gas, the stops will be shorter and shallower than if there is a high concentration. The length of the stops is also strongly influenced by which tissue compartments are assessed as highly saturated. High concentrations in slow tissues will indicate longer stops than similar concentrations in fast tissues.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>critical</b> problem, however, was a {{shortage}} of ammunition for the PAVN's tanks and heavy artillery (field artillery and mortars 85mm or larger in caliber). By 1974, PAVN's entire stock of heavy artillery and tank ammunition, including all ammunition held by combat units at forward warehouses, and in the PAVN's strategic reserves, totaled just 100,000 rounds. The ammunition problem was so serious that the PAVN artillery command had to replace the larger weapons {{in a number of}} units with obsolete 76.2mm and 57mm artillery pieces drawn out of storage for which there still was adequate ammunition.|$|E
5|$|At Ostend, Vindictive did prevent larger {{warships}} {{passing through}} the channel, although smaller craft could still come and go at will. The larger warships in Bruges were trapped there for the remaining months of the war; the town was captured by the Allies in October 1918. The blockages at Ostend and Zeebrugge took several years to clear completely, not being totally removed until 1921. On a strategic scale {{the effects of the}} raids at Ostend and Zeebrugge on the battle of the Atlantic were negligible. Despite this, in Britain the Ostend Raid was feted as a success. Three Victoria Crosses and a host of lesser awards were given to the men involved. The Admiralty presented it as a fine example of daring and careful planning from the Royal Navy, providing a valuable morale boost at one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>critical</b> moments of the war.|$|E
5|$|Most {{planning}} {{focused on}} the first phase, which was seen as <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>critical.</b> This phase involved construction of defence works for Singapore. For the second phase, a naval base capable of supporting a fleet was required. While the United States had constructed a graving dock capable of taking battleships at Pearl Harbor between 1909 and 1919, the Royal Navy had no such base east of Malta. In April 1919, the Plans Division of the Admiralty produced a paper which examined possible locations for a naval base in the Pacific {{in case of a}} war with the United States or Japan. Hong Kong was considered but regarded as too vulnerable, while Sydney was regarded as secure but too far from Japan. Singapore emerged as the best compromise location.|$|E

5|$|Sharon {{planned for}} Raviv's brigade to {{attack from the}} east, {{diverting}} Egyptian attention away from Deversoir. Erez was tasked with transporting a pre-constructed roller bridge to the crossing area at Deversoir, while one of his tank battalions would {{be attached to the}} paratroopers. Colonel Reshef was given <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>critical</b> tasks of all. Accordingly, his brigade was heavily reinforced to incorporate four armored and three mechanized infantry battalions, in addition to the division's reconnaissance battalion, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Yaov Brom. His brigade would conduct a turning maneuver at 6:00 AM on October 15 south of Akavish Road, move through the sand dunes to reach Fort Lakekan, before heading north to occupy Fort Matzmed. Reshef's brigade would then split up to clear the Akavish and Titur Roads and seize the Chinese Farm, while occupying the crossing area and awaiting Matt's brigade. Matt's paratrooper brigade, containing an additional tank company and the armored battalion, would move south-west via Akavish to reach Fort Matzmed. From there, it would continue on to the Yard and cross the canal at 11:00 PM, using rubber dinghies and rafts for the tanks.|$|E

At <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>critical</b> period of the day's fighting, when the German and Ottoman force of 2,000 dominated the Romani area from Mount Royston, the five mounted brigades (still less the 5th Light Horse Regiment) began their counterattack at 14:00 from the west towards Mount Royston.|$|E
