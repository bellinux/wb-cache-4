50|$|Morawitz was {{a pioneer}} in the study of coagulation, and a 1905 {{landmark}} paper is still regarded as a springboard for further study of the physiology of blood; he perfected observations made earlier by Alexander Schmidt and described four coagulation factors: fibrinogen (I), prothrombin (II), <b>thrombokinase</b> (III) and calcium (IV). He also pioneered blood transfusion, initially without the benefit of blood typing, and studied angina and the use of quinidine as an antiarrhythmic. He established a blood bank in Leipzig.|$|E

40|$|Two {{classes of}} {{biologic}} agents can accelerate {{the production of}} thrombin from partially purified prothrombin. One class is well represented by platelets, the other by a factor obtainable from the plasma globulins. Representatives of both classes are found not only in blood, but also in crude tissue extracts.

The two groups of factors as studied in this laboratory"' 18 correspond essentially to two old factors; and these factors will be called by their old, familiar names.

40|$|The {{unraveling}} of {{the mechanisms of}} one of the most remarkable characteristics of blood, its ability to clot, has taken almost one century. The understanding of how coagulation works proceeded in a stepwise fashion as illustrated in Fig. 1. 1, which shows some of the milestones in blood coagulation research. A considerable amount of basic work on protein chemistry and enzymology was conducted at the beginning of the last century in Europe and the USA. At that time, Morawitz described the conversion of prothrombin to thrombin by <b>thrombokinase</b> and the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin by thrombin. In Morawitzâ€™s view, <b>thrombokinase</b> was derived from platelets and damaged tissue. A few years later, Howell coined the term â€˜â€˜thromboplastin,â€™â€™ by which he meant a complex with clotting-accelerating activity derived from tissue, with the ability to convert prothrombin to thrombin. The numerous studies on thromboplastin allowed the successive purification of tissue factor (TF) from human and bovine tissue. One important discovery in enzymology was â€˜â€˜limited proteolysisâ€™â€™ [1], i. e., the breaking of specific peptide bonds depending on the amino acid sequence of a protein (as opposed to â€˜â€˜unlimited proteolysis,â€™â€™ which refers to the complete breakdown of a peptide to amino acids). Limited proteolysis is common to those complex biological systems based on highly regulated cascades, such as the complement system, apoptosis pathways, and blood coagulation...|$|E

40|$|It is well {{established}} that deportation of trophoblast from the placental bed to the maternal system occurs during normal human pregnancy (see review by Bardawil & Toy, 1959). Trophoblastic `sprouts ' {{break away from the}} syncytium into the intervillous space and pass directly into the maternal venous system (Hamilton & Boyd, 1966). These cells {{can be found in the}} venous drainage of the uterus throughout most ofpregnancy (Douglas, Thomas, Carr, Cullen & Morris, 1959) and, although many are subsequently destroyed, probably by some lytic action of the blood, considerable numbers reach the maternal lungs (Attwood & Park, 1961). The functional significance of this phenomenon is obscure, but a number of suggestions have been put forward: that it is merely a physiological desquamation, that the trophoblast cells may have an endocrine function, or an immunological function, or that they may liberate <b>thrombokinase</b> and affect blood coagulation during pregnancy. The allied phenomenon of villous deportation is regarded as essentially acci-dental and probably of little significance (Hamilton & Boyd, 1966) ...|$|E
40|$|E VEN to {{the reader}} intimately acquainted wâ€™ith the field, several of the re-cent {{developments}} {{in the study of}} the mechanism by which blood clots have often proved extremely puzzling. The number of communications which have appeared on the subject, especially during the past ten years, is indeed amazing, and their quantity alone may â€˜el 1 preclude the possibility of fair criti-cal appraisal.

40|$|Since the hÃ¦molysins of {{the several}} venoms respond {{differently}} to photodynamic action, they may be regarded as possessing different chemical constitutions. As regards stability, cobra hÃ¦molysin ranks first, daboia second, and Crotalus third. The toxicity of all the venoms {{is more or less}} diminished by eosin and erythrosin in sunlight. This reduction in toxicity depends upon chemical changes, of more or less profound nature, taking place in certain of the active principles of the venom. The more stabile the predominant active principles the less the reduction in toxicity, and vice versa. Venom-neurotoxins are highly resistant to photodynamic action, venom-hÃ¦molysins are less resistant, while the hÃ¦morrhagin and <b>thrombokinase</b> of Crotalus and daboia venoms exhibit weak powers of resistance to their action. Hence it follows that while cobra venom remained almost unaltered, rattlesnake and daboia venoms were greatly reduced in toxicity when mixed with the fluorescent dyes and exposed to sunlight. There is an interesting parallel between the action of eosin and erythrosin upon the different venoms and their reactions to other injurious agencies. For example, the hÃ¦molysins of cobra and daboia venoms are more heat resistant than the hÃ¦molysin of Crotalus venom, and the former are less injured by the dyes than the latter. The neurotoxin of the former venoms is also more heat stabile than that of the rattlesnake, and the same relative degree of resistance holds for this substance and the anilines. Just as the hÃ¦morrhagin of rattlesnake venom and the <b>thrombokinase</b> of daboia venom are destroyed by a temperature of 75 Â° C., so are they readily inactivated by the photo dynamic substances employed. The globulin-precipitating and blood corpuscle-protecting principle of cobra venom is relatively thermostabile and in contradistinction to the immunity-precipitins it is also unaffected by eosin and erythrosin. This study of the action of photodynamic substances upon snake venoms serves again to bring out the fact of their highly complex nature, and while enlarging somewhat the field in which photodynamic activity is known to operate, it also proves that this form of destructive activity is affected by the same conditions of resistance as confront the action of the usual physical and chemical agents...|$|E
40|$|Ever since Morawitz {{published}} his classical review in 1905, {{it has been}} the custom to divide the blood-clotting process into two phases, or stages: (1) Prothrombin is converted to thrombin in the presence of calcium ions and certain factors derived from platelets and tissues. (2) Under the influence of thrombin, soluble fibrinogen is transformed to the insoluble fibrin. This formulation was put forth as tentative, and it was generally appreciated that a two-stage theory could not give an adequate exphnation of the mechanism. Several attempts were made to construct a three-stage framework on which further detail might be built. Morawitz (1904) suggested that prothrombin was first acted upon by <b>thrombokinase,</b> then by calcium. In somewhat similar fashion, Howell (1935) believed that cephalin freed prothrombin by removing heparin from it; then the prothrombin was activated directly by calcium. The 1940 schema of W~klisch postulated the conversion of prothrombin I to prothrombin II. Bordet (1919) had proposed that prothrombin must be "unmasked " in order to be readily convertible to thrombin; and his experiments had shown with particular clarity that some timeconsumin...|$|E
40|$|Vernon {{as early}} as 1901 {{discovered}} the remarkable fact that both "tryptic and rennet ferments " can be formed from their corresponding zymogens {{by the action of}} trypsin itself (1). Vernon's results were fully confirmed by Kunitz and Northrop who found that trypsin brings about the formation of chymotrypsin from crystalline chymotrypsinogen (2) as weU as the formation of trypsin from crystalline trypsinogen (3). The process of formation of chymotrypsin by trypsin follows the course of a catalytic unimolecular reaction; the formation of trypsin by trypsin, on the other hand, follows the course of an autocatalytic reaction. The rate of the autocatalytic formation of trypsin is greatly enhanced in the presence of high concentrations of ammonium or magnesium sulfate. Recently Anson (4) found that trypsin brings about the catalytic formation of carboxypeptidase from its inactive precursor found in beef pancreas. Trypsin has been found (5) to have an accelerating effect on the dotting of blood. Waldschmidt-Leitz, Stadtler, and Steigenwaldt suggested (6) that trypsin acts like thrombin on fibrinogen. Eagle and Harris found (7) that crystalline trypsin coagulated citrated plasma of the rabbit, guinea pig, horse, and man. They believe that the action of trypsin is due to its catalytic transformation of prothrombin into thrombin. MeUanby and Pratt (8) disagree with the conclusions of Eagle and Harris.
