40|$|Several {{theoretical}} studies [1] {{indicate that}} there is no any reasonable chance for 3 n and 4 n to be bound. GANIL experiment [2] suggesting <b>tetraneutron</b> has not been confirmed but these no-result had however the merit of pushing theoreticians at work to clarify the possible existence of small n-clusters.

The search of multi-neutron resonances raises also some interest and a recent experiment scanning the 4 n continuum in the d (8 He, 6 Li) 4 n reaction reports a 2 - 3 MeV width structure [3]. In this issue it is enlightening to make a parallel with a similar, better-known, fermionic system: the 3 He atomic clusters.

40|$|We present quantum Monte Carlo {{calculations}} of few-neutron systems confined in external potentials based on local chiral interactions at next-to-next-to-leading order in chiral effective field theory. The energy and radial densities for these systems are calculated in different external Woods-Saxon potentials. We assume that their extrapolation to zero external-potential depth provides a quantitative estimate of three- and four-neutron resonances. The {{validity of this}} assumption is demonstrated by benchmarking with an exact diagonalization in the two-body case. We find that the extrapolated trineutron resonance, {{as well as the}} energy for shallow well depths, is lower than the <b>tetraneutron</b> resonance energy. This suggests that a three-neutron resonance exists below a four-neutron resonance in nature and is potentially measurable. To confirm that the relative ordering of three- and four-neutron resonances is not an artifact of the external confinement, we test that the odd-even staggering in the helium isotopic chain is reproduced within this approach.
