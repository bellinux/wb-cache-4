25|$|There {{are several}} {{companion}} notions {{closely related to}} the notion of an isoperimetric function. Thus an isodiametric function bounds the smallest diameter (with respect to the simplicial metric where every edge has length one) of a van Kampen diagram for a particular relation w in terms of the length of w. A filling length function the smallest filling length of a van Kampen diagram for a particular relation w in terms of the length of w. Here the filling length of a diagram is the minimum, over all combinatorial null-homotopies of <b>the</b> <b>diagram,</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> maximal length of intermediate loops bounding intermediate diagrams along such null-homotopies. The filling length function is {{closely related to the}} non-deterministic space complexity of the word problem for finitely presented groups. There are several general inequalities connecting the Dehn function, the optimal isodiametric function and the optimal filling length function, but the precise relationship between them is not yet understood.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are many}} other forms of {{hopscotch}} played across the globe. In India it is called Stapu, Nondi (Tamil) or Kith-Kith, in Spain and some Latin American countries, it's rayuela, although {{it may also be}} known as golosa or charranca. In Turkey, it is Seksek (the verb [...] "sek" [...] means to jump with one foot). In Russian it is known as классики (diminutive for the word meaning classes). In Poland, it is called klasy, meaning classes (rectangular shape, with the use of no marker but with speaking names of various items of a given class, e.g. colours or flowers, while jumping on successive fields) or pajac, meaning buffoon (human shape, {{with the use of a}} thrown marker, e.g. a piece of glass or stone). Swedes name the game hoppa hage (lit. jumping the garden), while in Norway it is called paradis, or Paradise. [...] In Italy the game is known as campana (meaning bell), or mondo (meaning world). In the Netherlands and Flanders, it is called Hinkelen. In Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia it is called školica, meaning little school. In Malaysia the most popular variant is called tengteng. In Mexico, it is called bebeleche (mamaleche) meaning drink milk [...] or avioncito meaning little plane ("probably because of the shape"). In Cuba and in Puerto Rico it is called [...] "La Peregrina" [...] (meaning [...] "Pilgrim Girl") and the squares represent the 9 rings the pilgrim traveler has to pass in order to reach Heaven from Purgatory according to Dante's Inferno. In Romania the game is called șotron and is widely played by children all over the country. In Brazil it is called amarelinha. The name evolved from marelle, the French name for the game, but was identified to the radical amarelo (yellow) and its diminutive in -inho/a. In Breton, the name is reg or delech. The Albanian variant is called rrasavi, which is composed of two words: rrasa ("the flat stone", an object used to play the game) and vi ("line", a reference to the lines that comprise <b>the</b> <b>diagram</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> course). In Philippines, hopscotch is called [...] "piko" [...] (pee-ko) and sometimes also called kiki (ki-ki). Its common court in the Philippines has six squares. In India, hopscotch is called [...] "thikrya", because broken stones called 'thikrya' are slid across the grid as players hop to next squares. In South Korea, hopscotch is called [...] "ttangttamŏkki (meaning [...] "Scoring Land") and is widely played across the nation.|$|E

The crease (2) cuts the ridges on either side, at an angle of about 30 degrees.

6000|$|... [31] Of late it {{has been}} the custom to quote the {{so-called}} [...] "ridge" [...] down the centre of the Atlantic as indicating an extensive ancient land. Even Professor Judd at one time adopted this view, speaking of the great belt of Tertiary volcanoes [...] "which extended through Greenland, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, the Hebrides, Ireland, Central France, the Iberian Peninsula, the Azores, Madeira, Canaries, Cape de Verde Islands, Ascension, St. Helena, and Tristan d'Acunha, and which constituted as shown by the recent soundings of H.M.S. Challenger a mountain-range, comparable in its extent, elevation, and volcanic character with the Andes of South America" [...] (Geological Mag. 1874, p. 71). On examining <b>the</b> <b>diagram</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic Ocean in the Challenger Reports, No. 7, a considerable part of this ridge is found to be more than 1,900 fathoms deep, while the portion called the [...] "Connecting Ridge" [...] seems to be {{due in part to the}} deposits carried out by the River Amazon. In the neighbourhood of the Azores, St. Paul's Rocks, Ascension, and Tristan d'Acunha are considerable areas varying from 1,200 to 1,500 fathoms deep, while the rest of the ridge is usually 1,800 or 1,900 fathoms. The shallower water is no doubt due to volcanic upheaval and the accumulation of volcanic ejections, and there may be many other deeply submerged old volcanoes on the ridge; but that it ever formed a chain of mountains [...] "comparable in elevation with the Andes," [...] there seems not a particle of evidence to prove. It is however probable that this ridge indicates the former existence of some considerable Atlantic islands, which may serve to explain the presence of a few identical genera, and even species of plants and insects in Africa and South America, while the main body of the fauna and flora of these two continents remains radically distinct.|$|E
60|$|Two {{plants of}} each form were {{protected}} from the access of insects during two successive years, and in the autumn they yielded very few capsules and presented a remarkable contrast with the adjoining uncovered plants, which were densely covered with capsules. In 1863 a protected long-styled plant produced only five poor capsules; two mid-styled plants produced together the same number; and two short-styled plants only a single one. These capsules contained very few seeds; yet the plants were fully productive when artificially fertilised under the net. In a state of nature the flowers are incessantly visited for their nectar by hive- and other bees, various Diptera and Lepidoptera. (4/3. H. Muller gives {{a list of the}} species 'Die Befruchtung der Blumen' page 196. It appears that one bee, the Cilissa melanura, almost confines its visits to this plant.) The nectar is secreted all round the base of the ovarium; but a passage is formed along the upper and inner side of the flower by the lateral deflection (not represented in <b>the</b> <b>diagram)</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basal portions of the filaments; so that insects invariably alight on the projecting stamens and pistil, and insert their proboscides along the upper and inner margin of the corolla. We can now see why the ends of the stamens with their anthers, and the ends of the pistils with their stigmas, are a little upturned, so that they may be brushed by the lower hairy surfaces of the insects' bodies. The shortest stamens which lie enclosed within the calyx of the long- and mid-styled forms can be touched only by the proboscis and narrow chin of a bee; hence they have their ends more upturned, and they are graduated in length, so as to fall into a narrow file, sure to be raked by the thin intruding proboscis. The anthers of the longer stamens stand laterally farther apart and are more nearly on the same level, for they have to brush against the whole breadth of the insect's body. In very many other flowers the pistil, or the stamens, or both, are rectangularly bent {{to one side of the}} flower. This bending may be permanent, as with Lythrum and many others, or may be effected, as in Dictamnus fraxinella and others, by a temporary movement, which occurs in the case of the stamens when the anthers dehisce, and in the case of the pistil when the stigma is mature; but these two movements do not always take place simultaneously in the same flower. Now I have found no exception to the rule, that when the stamens and pistil are bent, they bend to that side of the flower which secretes nectar, even though there be a rudimentary nectary of large size on the opposite side, as in some species of Corydalis. When nectar is secreted on all sides, they bend to that side where the structure of the flower allows the easiest access to it, as in Lythrum, various Papilionaceae, and others. The rule consequently is, that when the pistils and stamens are curved or bent, the stigma and anthers are thus brought into the pathway leading to the nectary. There are a few cases which seem to be exceptions to this rule, but they are not so in truth; for instance, in the Gloriosa lily, the stigma of the grotesque and rectangularly bent pistil is brought, not into any pathway from the outside towards the nectar-secreting recesses of the flower, but into the circular route which insects follow in proceeding from one nectary to the other. In Scrophularia aquatica the pistil is bent downwards from the mouth of the corolla, but it thus strikes the pollen-dusted breast of the wasps which habitually visit these ill-scented flowers. In all these cases we see the supreme dominating power of insects on the structure of flowers, especially of those which have irregular corollas. Flowers which are fertilised by the wind must of course be excepted; but I do not know of a single instance of an irregular flower which is thus fertilised.|$|E
