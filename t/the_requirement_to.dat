They continued after World War II, and in the later decades of the 20th century the city began to grow again.

5|$|New Labour {{tended to}} emphasise social justice, {{rather than the}} {{equality}} which {{was the focus of}} previous Labour governments, and challenged the view that social justice and economic efficiency are mutually exclusive. The party's traditional attachment to equality was reduced: Minimum standards and equality of opportunity were promoted over the equality of outcome. The Commission on Social Justice, set up by John Smith, reported in 1994 that the values of social justice were: equal worth of citizens, equal rights to be able to meet their basic needs, <b>the</b> <b>requirement</b> <b>to</b> spread opportunities as much as possible, and the need to remove unjustified inequalities. The party viewed social justice primarily as <b>the</b> <b>requirement</b> <b>to</b> give citizens equal political and economic liberty and also as the need for social citizenship. It encompasses the need for equal distribution of opportunity, with the caveat that things should not be taken from successful people to give to the unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} John Hale {{considered the}} original castle {{to form a}} transitional design between older medieval English designs and the newer Italian styles of defence. The design of Deal, like its sister castles along the Downs, suffered from design problems: it needed too many guns to ever be fully equipped; its curved surfaces were vulnerable to attack; and despite attempts to keep the walls low and thick, its relatively high profile, driven by <b>the</b> <b>requirement</b> <b>to</b> support several tiers of defences, made it exposed to attack.|$|E

On 16 January 1537, Farel and Calvin presented their Articles concernant l'organisation de l'église et du culte à Genève (Articles on the Organization of the Church and its Worship at Geneva) to the city council.

5|$|Strong, royalty-based {{nation states}} rose {{throughout}} Europe in the Late Middle Ages, particularly in England, France, and the Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula: Aragon, Castile, and Portugal. The long conflicts {{of the period}} strengthened royal control over their kingdoms and were extremely hard on the peasantry. Kings profited from warfare that extended royal legislation and increased the lands they directly controlled. Paying for the wars required that methods of taxation become more effective and efficient, {{and the rate of}} taxation often increased. <b>The</b> <b>requirement</b> <b>to</b> obtain the consent of taxpayers allowed representative bodies such as the English Parliament and the French Estates General to gain power and authority.|$|E

5|$|The V-22's {{development}} {{process has been}} long and controversial, partly due to its large cost increases, {{some of which are}} caused by <b>the</b> <b>requirement</b> <b>to</b> fold wing and rotors to fit aboard ships. The development budget was first planned for $2.5 billion in 1986, which increased to a projected $30 billion in 1988. By 2008, $27 billion had been spent on the program and another $27.2 billion was required to complete planned production numbers. Between 2008 and 2011, the estimated lifetime cost for maintaining the V-22 grew by 61 percent, mostly allocated to maintenance and support.|$|E
