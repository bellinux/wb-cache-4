5|$|Ebert spent a {{semester}} as a master's {{student in the}} department of English there before attending the University of Cape Town on a Rotary fellowship for a year. He returned from Cape Town to his graduate studies at Illinois for two more semesters and then, after being accepted as a PhD candidate at the University of Chicago, he prepared to move to Chicago. He needed a job to support himself while he worked on his doctorate and so applied to the Chicago Daily News, hoping that, as he had already sold freelance pieces to the Daily News, including an article on the death of writer Brendan Behan, he would be hired by editor Herman Kogan. Instead Kogan referred Ebert to the city editor at the Chicago Sun-Times, Jim Hoge, who hired Ebert as a reporter and feature writer at <b>the</b> <b>Sun-Times</b> in 1966. He attended doctoral classes at the University of Chicago while working as a general reporter at <b>the</b> <b>Sun-Times</b> for a year. After movie critic Eleanor Keane left <b>the</b> <b>Sun-Times</b> in April 1967, editor Robert Zonka gave the job to Ebert. The load of graduate school and being a film critic proved too much, so Ebert left the University of Chicago to focus his energies on film criticism.|$|E

However, after losing the subsequent regional semifinal game to King College Prep High School the team finished with a 6–19 record.
