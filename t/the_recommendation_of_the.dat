5|$|Fraser {{was engaged}} to design the coin on <b>the</b> <b>recommendation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States Commission of Fine Arts. The coins were flown from the San Francisco Mint, where they were struck, to Washington state by {{airplane}} as a publicity stunt. They sold badly; much of the issue was returned for redemption and melting, and the failure {{may have been a}} factor in one official's suicide. Due to the low number of surviving pieces, the coins are valuable today.|$|E

5|$|The {{house was}} owned by several {{families}} by 1745 after which it fell into disrepair and {{was used as a}} tenant farm. After repair by architect Alfred Hoare Powell (1865–1960), it was the first house acquired by the National Trust, in 1907, on <b>the</b> <b>recommendation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> antiquarian Canon Hardwicke Rawnsley (1851–1920). In the 1920s the house was renovated, the stable block turned into a residence and several outbuildings, gardens and gateways constructed.|$|E
5|$|Also in that year, Barbara Kepler {{contracted}} Hungarian spotted fever, {{then began}} having seizures. As Barbara was recovering, Kepler's three children all fell sick with smallpox; Friedrich, 6, died. Following his son's death, Kepler sent letters to potential patrons in Württemberg and Padua. At the University of Tübingen in Württemberg, concerns over Kepler's perceived Calvinist heresies {{in violation of}} the Augsburg Confession and the Formula of Concord prevented his return. The University of Padua—on <b>the</b> <b>recommendation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> departing Galileo—sought Kepler to fill the mathematics professorship, but Kepler, preferring to keep his family in German territory, instead travelled to Austria to arrange a position as teacher and district mathematician in Linz. However, Barbara relapsed into illness and died shortly after Kepler's return.|$|E
