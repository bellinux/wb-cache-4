She praised the [...] "uniformly fantastic" [...] guest cast and the [...] "drop dead gorgeous" [...] {{exterior}} and interior locations. She singled out writer Phil Ford for considerable praise feeling that he wrote the episode true to the characters [...] "while filling in backstory we {{had no way of}} imagining" [...] and delivered [...] "drama, action, and laughs". Brad Trechak of AOL TV felt the more comic episode was a welcome respite from darker episodes. He praised the episode for being [...] "light and fluffy yet it furthered things along with regard to the Torchwood universe and its characters". Reviewing the episode Brigid Cherry of Total Sci-Fi felt that [...] "contrary to expectation– it’s hilarious". She praised the comedy provided from Eve Myles, Gareth David-Lloyd and Nerys Hughes in particular as well as the [...] "terrifying moments <b>that</b> <b>threaten</b> <b>to</b> tip over into gross-out horror-comedy." [...] She felt overall the [...] "offbeat self-parody" [...] made a welcome change from the show's more serious episodes and rated it eight out of ten. Den of Geek's Jack Kibble-White found the episode to be a [...] "surprise series highlight".|$|E

The demonic figure Azazel, depicted with goat-like features and in one instance as an unclean bird, is consigned to desert places as impure. The Babylonian Talmud says {{that a person who}} wanted to attract an impure spirit might fast and spend the night in a cemetery; in the traditional religions of the Near East and Europe, one ritual mode for seeking a divinely inspired revelation or prophecy required incubation at the tomb of an ancestor or hero. A cemetery, already a [...] of [...] "unclean" [...] spirits or a multiplicity of gods, was considered an appropriate dump when biblical leaders destroy sacred objects of other religions or statues representing the gods. To pneuma to akatharton appears in the Septuagint at , where pseudoprophetai ("false prophets") speak in the name of Yahweh but are possessed by an unclean spirit. This occurrence of [...] "unclean spirit" [...] is unique in the Tanakh; the Hebrew is rûah hattum’â.|$|E

2500|$|An {{immediate}} need {{in treatment}} {{is to ensure}} that the airway is open and not threatened (for example by tissues or foreign objects), because airway compromisation can occur rapidly and insidiously, and is potentially deadly. [...] Material in the mouth that threatens the airway can be removed manually or using a suction tool for that purpose, and supplemental oxygen can be provided. Facial fractures <b>that</b> <b>threaten</b> <b>to</b> interfere with the airway can be reduced by moving the bones back into place; this both reduces bleeding and moves the bone {{out of the way of}} the airway. Tracheal intubation (inserting a tube into the airway to assist breathing) may be difficult or impossible due to swelling. [...] Nasal intubation, inserting an endotracheal tube through the nose, may be contraindicated in the presence of facial trauma because if there is an undiscovered fracture at the base of the skull, the tube could be forced through it and into the brain. [...] If facial injuries prevent oraotracheal or nasotracheal intubation, a surgical airway can be placed to provide an adequate airway. [...] Although cricothyrotomy and tracheostomy can secure an airway when other methods fail, they are used only as a last resort because of potential complications and the difficulty of the procedures.|$|E

Critic Neil Kulkarni said it appraises [...] "the broken promises and bloody pathways {{in and out of}} America's heartland malaise", while Matthew Phillips from Tiny Mix Tapes wrote that the record offers [...] "dialectical account {{of the relationship between the}} constantly-emerging revolutionary consciousness of black culture and the bare materialism and institutionalization <b>that</b> <b>threaten</b> <b>to</b> destroy it". In an interview with MTV, Kendrick discussed the meaning behind the tracks [...] "Wesley's Theory" [...] and [...] "King Kunta". The album's opening track, [...] "Wesley's Theory", is a reference to Wesley Snipes and how the actor was jailed for tax evasion. In the interview Lamar stated that [...] "no one teaches poor black males how to manage money or celebrity, so if they do achieve success, the powers that be can take it from right under them". He continues by elaborating that [...] "King Kunta" [...] is concerned with the [...] "history of negative stereotypes all African-Americans have to reconcile". The interviewer finishes by asking about Lamar's criticism of rappers who use ghostwriters on [...] "King Kunta", after which Lamar reveals that he came to prominence as a ghostwriter, therefore having respect for writers, but says that [...] "as a new artist, you have to stand behind your work." ...|$|E
2500|$|Songs in A Minor {{received}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} contemporary music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, it received an average score of 78, based on 10 reviews. Sam Faulkner of NME described {{the balance between}} contemporary music and retrospective as [...] "an act of pure genius". Q magazine hailed it as [...] "a prime candidate to head up the nu-soul revolution ... with a voice that challenges Mary J. Blige's". Steve Jones of USA Today said that [...] "Keys already has a musical, artistic and thematic maturity that many more experienced artists never achieve". The Washington Posts Richard Harrington wrote favorably of Keys' musical influences on the album and expressed that she has [...] "vocal maturity and writing instincts beyond her years". PopMatters critic Mark Anthony Neal praised Keys' performance on the album and called it [...] "a distinct and oft-times brilliant debut from an artist who clearly has a fine sense of her creative talents". Robert Christgau, writing in The Village Voice, said that the [...] "grace and grit" [...] {{of the first half}} warrant the [...] "auspicious debut" [...] label and that, after some [...] "bores <b>that</b> <b>threaten</b> <b>to</b> sink the project midway through," [...] Keys sustains the album with the songs at the end.|$|E

"This {{monument}} {{symbolizes the}} pinnacle of successful {{for the construction of}} the North–South Expressway that connects Bukit Kayu Hitam bordering with Thailand in the North to Johor Bahru in the Causeway bordering with Singapore in the South. The construction of the 848km expressway, across the peat swamps and forests and hill untapped granite hills, is an amazing achievement. Also impressive is the pragmatic way in which the combined efforts between {{the public and private sectors}} has resulted in this achievement. The expressways is the result of joint efforts of the Malaysian Highway Authority, a statutory body, which has been planned early and begin construction, with the Projek Lebuhraya Utara-Selatan Berhad (PLUS) (North–South Expressway Project), a private company that was awarded concessions to finance, design, construct, operate and maintain the expressways. Such efforts shows an improvement visions into a reality after across a variety of challenges <b>that</b> <b>threaten</b> <b>to</b> stop. It acknowledged the success of the Government and represents a national effort funded and operated successfully by Malaysians. This monument also commemorates the efforts of leaders of the Government, public services, businesses, financial institutions, consultants, engineers and consultants, as well as contractors and labours, which has played an important role in facing their challenges and bring this project to a level of success. Those who use this expressway will be expected not only to enjoy the various parties in the construction efforts, but also can even appreciate this expressway contribution towards national development." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "This race of man," [...] {{said the}} old chestnut-tree, [...] "is never ceasing in its restless warfare on Nature. In our forest solitudes {{hitherto}} how peacefully, how quietly, how regularly has everything gone on! Not a flower has missed its appointed time of blossoming, or failed to perfect its fruit. No matter how hard has been the winter, how loud the winds have roared, and how high the snow-banks have been piled, all has come right again in spring. Not the least root has lost itself under the snows, {{so as not to}} be ready with its fresh leaves and blossoms when the sun returns to melt the frosty chains of winter. We have storms sometimes <b>that</b> <b>threaten</b> <b>to</b> shake everything to pieces,--the thunder roars, the lightning flashes, and the winds howl and beat; but, when all is past, everything comes out better and brighter than before,--not a bird is killed, not the frailest flower destroyed. But man comes, and in one day he will make a desolation that centuries cannot repair. Ignorant boor that he is, and all incapable of appreciating the glorious works of Nature, it seems to be his glory to be able to destroy in a few hours what it was the work of ages to produce. The noble oak, that has been cut away to build this contemptible human dwelling, had a life older and wiser than that of any man in this country. That tree has seen generations of men come and go. It was a fresh young tree when Shakespeare was born; it was hardly a middle-aged tree when he died; it was growing here when the first ship brought the white men to our shores, and hundreds and hundreds of those whom they call bravest, wisest, strongest,--warriors, statesmen, orators, and poets,--have been born, have grown up, lived, and died, while yet it has outlived them all. It has seen more wisdom than the best of them; but two or three hours of brutal strength sufficed to lay it low. Which of these dolts could make a tree? I'd like to see them do anything like it. How noisy and clumsy are all their movements,--chopping, pounding, rasping, hammering. And, after all, what do they build? In the forest we do everything so quietly. A tree would be ashamed of itself that could not get its growth without making such a noise and dust and fuss. Our life is the perfection of good manners. For my part, I feel degraded at the mere presence of these human beings; but, alas! I am old; a hollow place at my heart warns me of the progress of decay, and probably it will be seized upon by these rapacious creatures as an excuse for laying me as low as my noble green brother." ...|$|E
