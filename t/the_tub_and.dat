5|$|Lisa {{performs}} a science experiment {{to see if}} cola will dissolve a tooth, and Bart shocks Lisa {{as part of his}} project to prove that nerds conduct electricity. The tooth is also shocked; it undergoes an unusual reaction and creates a race of miniature beings. Lisa discovers this the next day and marvels at how the people in her universe evolve at a rapid rate. Bart destroys some of the ecosystem in Lisa's tub universe, and the people respond by sending a squadron of space ships to attack him. Lisa is shrunk and beamed down into the tub, where the citizens explain that they regard her as God, and they want her to do something about Bart, whom they regard as the Devil. She says she can help them if they unshrink her, but they tell her they have not figured out the technology to do that. Bart grabs <b>the</b> <b>tub</b> <b>and</b> submits it in the science fair, and Lisa is forced to watch from within as Bart wins first prize. Realizing that she is now stuck in the small universe forever, Lisa orders her citizens to grovel and bring her some shoes.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{discovering}} her pregnancy, Quinn convinces Finn {{that he is}} the father, {{despite the}} fact that they never actually had a sexual encounter. Quinn claims that due to his premature ejaculation problem, and during their time in a hot-tub, Finn had ejaculated in <b>the</b> <b>tub</b> <b>and</b> Quinn had received the sperm. The real father is Finn's best friend Puck (Mark Salling), who offers to support Quinn and the baby, but is rejected for his irresponsibility. Quinn decides to have the baby adopted, and agrees to give it to Terri (Jessalyn Gilsig), the wife of glee club director Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison), who is faking a pregnancy. When news of her pregnancy is revealed to the school, Quinn is cut from the cheerleading squad and her popularity declines. Her parents evict her, and Quinn moves in with Finn and his mother. She begins to reconsider having the baby adopted, and gives Puck a chance to prove himself, but he is not reliable so she returns to her plan of giving the baby to Terri. Quinn blackmails Sue into letting her rejoin the Cheerios, but ultimately decides against it, preferring to remain with the glee club, where she feels accepted. Finn learns the truth about the baby's paternity from Rachel, and breaks up with Quinn. Puck again offers to support her, but she turns him down and tells him that she wants to handle the pregnancy by herself. She moves in with Puck's family, but after forming a friendship with fellow New Directions member Mercedes Jones (Amber Riley), Quinn lives with her family instead. She gives birth to a daughter, named Beth by Puck, who is adopted by Shelby Corcoran (Idina Menzel), coach of rival glee club Vocal Adrenaline and Rachel's biological mother.|$|E

50|$|Wheelbarrow Run is {{a stream}} {{that runs through}} <b>the</b> <b>tubs</b> <b>and</b> {{eventually}} meets up with the larger Laurel Run.

He then ran, but she soon caught and drowned him. She left him floating in <b>the</b> <b>tub</b> <b>and</b> laid Mary in John's arms in the bed. She then called the police repeatedly saying she needed an officer but would not say why. Then she called Rusty, telling him to come home right away.|$|E
25|$|The Fishes {{are also}} {{associated}} with the German legend of Antenteh, who owned just a tub and a crude cabin when he met a magical fish. They offered him a wish, which he refused. However, his wife begged {{him to return to}} the fish and ask for a beautiful furnished home. This wish was granted, but her desires were not satisfied. She then asked to be a queen and have a palace, but when she asked to become a goddess, the fish became angry and took the palace and home, leaving the couple with <b>the</b> <b>tub</b> <b>and</b> cabin once again. The tub in the story is sometimes recognized as the Great Square of Pegasus.|$|E
500|$|Gilly later {{finds himself}} {{attracted}} to Lynsey Nolan (Karen Hassan); he initially fears he is {{moving on to}} soon. Whilst interviewed by Inside Soap Quinlan describes the scenes in which they share their first kiss stating: [...] "Gilly gets a new job at Look Sharpe as a personal trainer, and invites Lynsey for a free session, Lynsey's looking pretty good when she turns up, so Gilly gets a bit sweaty and hot under the collar - and she ends up hopping into <b>the</b> <b>tub</b> <b>and</b> dragging Gilly in fully clothed!" [...] They later meet up and feel awkward because of Gilly's grief for Steph, of this Quinlan adds: [...] "They're getting on well, {{but as soon as}} the word date is mentioned, it goes a bit wrong, nerves get the better of them and they have a huge row." [...] Off-screen Quinlan was not happy with the fact Gilly is trying to move on quick, of this he states: [...] "I thought it was a bit harsh, it feels like it's a little too soon, doesn't it? We'll just have to wait and see what the future holds for Gilly and Lynsey - but there's no comparison to Steph..." ...|$|E
6000|$|Penn and Uncle Salters {{cleaned up}} as Disko had ordained, {{but the boys}} profited little. No sooner were <b>the</b> <b>tubs</b> {{furnished}} than Tom Platt and Long Jack, who had been exploring {{the inside of a}} dory with a lantern, snatched them away, loaded up <b>the</b> <b>tubs</b> <b>and</b> some small, painted trawl-buoys, and hove the boat overboard into what Harvey regarded as an exceedingly rough sea. [...] "They'll be drowned. Why, the dory's loaded like a freight-car," [...] he cried.|$|R

500|$|The Simpson family {{visits a}} home and garden show where they decide to {{purchase}} a hot tub. They spend hours soaking in <b>the</b> <b>tub</b> <b>and</b> become so relaxed that they forget to visit Abraham [...] "Grampa" [...] Simpson at a family event. Grampa angrily unplugs and destroys the hot tub, scolding them for ignoring him. Homer decides {{to make up for}} their neglect and decides to do something Grampa wants to do. Grampa reminisces about a pub in Dunkilderry, Ireland called O'Flanagan's, where he claims to have had the best night of his life many years ago. Homer decides to take Grampa there for one last drink. When the family arrives they realize Ireland has become a commercialized, hi-tech country of consumers and workaholics. The pub itself has run out of business as many of the patrons are now yuppies who have no interest in drinking. The pub owner Tom O'Flanagan is happy to have customers again. Homer and Grampa sit down at the pub and start drinking while Marge, Bart and Lisa visit various Irish landmarks. They visit the Giant's Causeway, Blarney Castle, the Guinness brewery and Dublin.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2011, Lynsey became {{attracted}} to widower Gilly Roach (Anthony Quinlan) {{and they began}} a short relationship. After Gilly became a personal trainer at Look Sharpe, a local day spa, he invited Lynsey to come along for a free session. Quinlan told Inside Soap journalist, Steven Murphy, that Lynsey is [...] "looking pretty good when she turns up" [...] and she would eventually end up [...] "hopping into <b>the</b> <b>tub</b> <b>and</b> dragging Gilly in there fully clothed!" [...] Hassan said that she found the scene in which Lynsey pulled Gilly into the hot tub [...] "embarrassing", despite knowing Quinlan well. She added that the scenes were not romantic to film due to the water being cold. Lynsey and Gilly later arranged a date together, which prompted Gilly to remove his wedding ring. Quinlan thought that Gilly's decision was a [...] "bit harsh" [...] {{because it was too}} soon for him to consider moving on from his wife, Steph (Carley Stenson). The actor stated that viewers would have to wait {{to see what would happen}} between Lynsey and Gilly, but believed that there was no comparison when it came to her and Steph.|$|E

6000|$|She muttered unsteadily, [...] "Must {{run up and}} put on my shoes--slippers so cold." [...] In the {{not very}} romantic {{solitude}} of the locked bathroom {{she sat on the}} slippery edge of <b>the</b> <b>tub</b> <b>and</b> wept.|$|E

60|$|After {{the first}} feeling of awe and wonder is worn out, a mine becomes monotonous. There {{is only the}} humming, palpitating darkness, the rumble of <b>the</b> <b>tubs,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> endless {{procession}} of galleries to arrest the attention. And one pit to the uninitiated is as like to another as two peas. Tell a miner this and he laughs--slowly and softly. To him the pits have each distinct personalities, and each {{must be dealt with}} differently.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> wash <b>tub</b> is {{hexagonal}} <b>and</b> {{constructed of}} laser-perforated stainless steel, spinning above a half-octagonal stainless steel base. Because {{the distance between}} <b>the</b> spinning <b>tub</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> base is in constant flux, water is force-injected through the perforations into the clothes. Staber Industries received a patent for this wash tub configuration in 1994.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, he is cruel!" [...] Maggie sobbed aloud. She {{would stay}} {{up in the}} attic and starve herself--hide herself behind <b>the</b> <b>tub,</b> <b>and</b> stay there all night; {{and then they would}} all be frightened, and Tom would be sorry.|$|E
60|$|After that, Twinkle often sat {{for hours}} {{watching}} the turtle, which would crawl around {{the bottom of}} <b>the</b> <b>tub,</b> <b>and</b> swim in the little pool of water and eat the food placed before him in an eager and amusing way.|$|E

2500|$|The boiler {{dates from}} 1895 {{and is a}} twin furnace Lancashire boiler, {{delivering}} 12 psi. It consumed around 1 cwt of coal per hour. [...] Coal supplies were originally brought by barge, but after the land was successfully drained a railway line was laid from Spalding to Boston, and coals were delivered to a nearby goods facility. [...] They were then transported on a very short [...] narrow gauge railway line in colliery-style <b>tubs.</b> <b>The</b> motive power for this {{appears to have been}} human. One of <b>the</b> <b>tubs</b> <b>and</b> a metre or so of line is displayed at the museum.|$|R
60|$|When she {{got home}} she put the mud-turtle in a tub which her papa had made by sawing a barrel in two. Then she put a little water into <b>the</b> <b>tub</b> <b>and</b> blocked it up by putting a brick under one side, so that the turtle could either stay in the water or crawl up the {{inclined}} bottom of the tub {{to where it was}} dry, whichever he pleased. She did this because mamma said that turtles sometimes liked to stay in the water and sometimes on land, and Twinkle's turtle could now take his choice. He couldn't climb up the steep sides of <b>the</b> <b>tub</b> <b>and</b> so get away, and the little girl thoughtfully placed crumbs of bread and fine bits of meat, where the turtle could get them whenever he felt hungry.|$|E
60|$|But {{the whole}} shop, from the till {{down to the}} shavings, from that night changed their opinion of <b>the</b> <b>tub,</b> <b>and</b> they looked up to it, and had such faith in it that they were under the {{impression}} that when the grocer read the art and drama critiques out of the paper in the evenings, it all came from the tub.|$|E
6000|$|There {{is nothing}} mirth-provoking in going down a coal-mine--even though it {{be only a}} shallow incline running to one hundred and forty feet {{vertical}} below the earth.

50|$|Wildflowers are {{a common}} site among the foliage around <b>the</b> <b>tubs</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{surrounding}} forests.
