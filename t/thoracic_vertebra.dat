5|$|The {{esophagus}} {{is one of}} {{the upper}} parts of the digestive system. There are taste buds on its upper part. It begins {{at the back of the}} mouth, passing downwards through the rear part of the mediastinum, through the diaphragm, and into the stomach. In humans, the esophagus generally starts around the level of the sixth cervical vertebra behind the cricoid cartilage of the trachea, enters the diaphragm at about the level of the tenth <b>thoracic</b> <b>vertebra,</b> and ends at the cardia of the stomach, at the level of the eleventh <b>thoracic</b> <b>vertebra.</b> The esophagus is usually about 25cm (10in) in length.|$|E

He became assistant coach of the German women's national wheelchair basketball team in 2003, and then coach in 2006. The team won five consecutive European championships, in 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009 and 2011, and a silver medal at the 2008 Summer Paralympics in Beijing.|$|E

5|$|Pseudoryzomys has 19 or 20thoracic (chest) and lumbar vertebrae, 13 {{of which}} bear ribs, as is {{characteristic}} of oryzomyines. The first ribs contact both the seventh cervical (neck) vertebra and the first <b>thoracic</b> <b>vertebra,</b> an important character of the Sigmodontinae. Unlike in most sigmodontines, including Holochilus and Lundomys, the fourth lumbar vertebra lacks the processes known as anapophyses. There are three or four sacral and about 29caudal (tail) vertebrae. Between {{the second and third}} caudal vertebrae, separate bones called hemal arches are present. These display a spinous process at the back, as in both Holochilus and Lundomys. On the humerus, the upper arm bone, the entepicondylar foramen is absent, as in all members of the Sigmodontinae; in some other cricetids, it perforates the far (distal) end of the humerus.|$|E
25|$|The {{thoracic}} curve, concave forward, {{begins at}} {{the middle of the}} second and ends at the middle of the twelfth <b>thoracic</b> <b>vertebra.</b> Its most prominent point behind corresponds to the spinous process of the seventh <b>thoracic</b> <b>vertebra.</b> This curve is known as a kyphotic curve.|$|E

25|$|Research on the Lady's spine {{located a}} smooth lateral curve on the lumbar region (lower spine), with a {{convexity}} towards the left. This {{is an indication}} of lumbar scoliosis. The limits of the curve have been determined. The upper limit is between the twelfth <b>thoracic</b> <b>vertebra</b> and the first lumbar vertebra. The lower limit is between the fourth and fifth lumbar vertebrae. The center of the curve is between the second and third lumbar vertebrae. The scoliosis of the Lady is mild, with a Cobb angle of less than 20°. Researchers found no evidence of structural abnormalities in the vertebrae, no fractures, and no congenital anomalies (birth defects). The researchers suspect that the Lady may not have actually suffered from scoliosis while still alive. The curved spine of the mummy may be a postmortem condition, resulting from the position of the body during the mummification process.|$|E

40|$|Meat {{retailers}} have reported bone marrow discoloration to be a problem, especially in modified-atmosphere packages (MAP). To evaluate causes of bone marrow discoloration in different beef bones and packaging systems, 36 beef arm bones, ribs, shoulder blades, and <b>thoracic</b> <b>vertebrae</b> from USDA Select and Choice carcasses {{were obtained from}} a commercial abattoir, cut into 1 -inch-thick sections at 4 days postmortem, and packaged into 1) polyvinyl chloride film (PVC) overwrap; 2) high-oxygen (80 % O 2, 20 % CO 2) MAP; or 3) ultra-low-oxygen (70 % N 2, 30 % CO 2) MAP. Packages were displayed under continuous fluorescent lighting for 4 days at 35. 6 °F. Ribs, shoulder blades, and <b>thoracic</b> <b>vertebrae</b> packaged in PVC and high-oxygen MAP developed undesirable gray or black discoloration during display. In ultra-low-oxygen MAP, mean visual-color scores were acceptable throughout display. The a* values (larger values equate to redder color) for ribs, shoulder blades, and <b>thoracic</b> <b>vertebrae</b> decreased (P< 0. 05) over time. Arm-bone marrow had less oxidation and dramatically less total iron and hemoglobin than did marrow from ribs and <b>thoracic</b> <b>vertebrae.</b> The much larger amounts of iron and hemoglobin in ribs and <b>thoracic</b> <b>vertebrae</b> likely correspond to marrow discoloration. In summary, bone marrow discoloration occurs in ribs, shoulder blades, and <b>thoracic</b> <b>vertebrae</b> packaged in PVC or high-oxygen MAP. Bones packaged in ultralow- oxygen MAP or arm bones packaged in PVC or high-oxygen MAP had minimal oxidation and discoloration...|$|R
40|$|We {{explored}} intraspecific {{variation in}} vertebral formulae, more specifically {{the variation in}} the number of <b>thoracic</b> <b>vertebrae</b> and frequencies of transitional sacral vertebrae in Triturus newts (Caudata: Salamandridae). Within salamandrid salamanders this monophyletic group shows the highest disparity {{in the number of}} <b>thoracic</b> <b>vertebrae</b> and considerable intraspecific variation in the number of <b>thoracic</b> <b>vertebrae.</b> Triturus species also differ in their ecological preferences, from predominantly terrestrial to largely aquatic. Following Geoffroy St. Hilaire’s and Darwin’s rule which states that structures with a large number of serially homologous repetitive elements are more variable than structures with smaller numbers, we hypothesized that the variation in vertebral formulae increases in more elongated species with a larger number of <b>thoracic</b> <b>vertebrae.</b> We furthermore hypothesized that the frequency of transitional vertebrae will be correlated with the variation in the number of <b>thoracic</b> <b>vertebrae</b> within the species. We also investigated potential effects of species hybridization on the vertebral formula. The proportion of individuals with a number of <b>thoracic</b> <b>vertebrae</b> different from the modal number and the range of variation in number of vertebrae significantly increased in species with a larger number of <b>thoracic</b> <b>vertebrae.</b> Contrary to our expectation, the frequencies of transitional vertebrae were not correlated with frequencies of change in the complete vertebrae number. The frequency of transitional sacral vertebra in hybrids did not significantly differ from that of the parental species. Such a pattern could be a result of selection pressure against transitional vertebrae and/or a bias towards the development of full vertebrae numbers. Although our data indicate relaxed selection for vertebral count changes in more elongated, aquatic species, more data on different selective pressures in species with different numbers of vertebrae in the two contrasting, terrestrial and aquatic environments are needed to test for causality...|$|R

2500|$|Because central neuraxial {{blockade}} causes arterial and vasodilation, a drop {{in blood}} pressure is common.

60|$|Section 77. In Section 3 (which {{the student}} should refer to) {{we have a}} {{division}} of the vertebrae into four varieties. Of these most representative is the thoracic. A <b>thoracic</b> <b>vertebra</b> (Figure 4, Sheet 5, T.V.) consists of a central bony mass, the body or centrum (b.), from which there arises dorsally an arch, the neural arch (n.a.), completed by a keystone, the neural spine (n.s.); and coming off laterally from the arch is the transverse process (tr.p.). Looking at the vertebra sideways, we see that the arch is notched, for the exit of nerves. Jointed to the thoracic vertebrae on either side are the ribs (r.). Each rib has a process, the tuberculum, going up to articulate with the transverse process, and one, the capitulum articulating between the bodies of two contiguous vertebrae. The facets for the articulation of the capitulum are indicated in the side view by shading. At either end of the body of a vertebra of a young rabbit are bony caps, the epiphyses (ep.), separated from the body by a plane of unossified cartilage (indicated, by the dots). These epiphyses to the vertebral bodies occur only among mammals, and are even absent in some cases within the class. In the adult rabbit they have ossified continuously {{with the rest of the}} body.|$|E
