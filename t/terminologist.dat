CAOS supports terminological concept modelling. The backbone of this concept modelling is constituted by characteristics modelled by formal feature specifications, i. e. attribute-value pairs. Our use of feature specifications is subject to a number of principles and constraints.

40|$|Abstract: The {{creation}} of target language equivalents in bilingual dictionaries {{have always been}} a challenge to both lexicographers and <b>terminologists.</b> Lexicographers, <b>terminologists,</b> subject specialists and linguists face a challenging task of supplying term equivalents for foreign interna-tional languages. The lack of a sufficient technical vocabulary in the African languages poses chal-lenges to lexicographers and <b>terminologists</b> when supplying technical equivalents. They often regard transliteration as the quickest lexicographical and terminological procedure without taking the practical demands of users into account. This impedes the optimal retrieval of semantic infor-mation by the target users of dictionaries. This article discusses possible reasons why translitera-tion should not be regarded as the first but the last resort in lexicography and terminology. It pro-poses different lexicographical and terminological procedures lexicographers and <b>terminologists</b> can use to supply accurate and appropriate translation equivalents without making excessive use of transliteration. In this way a scientific language will develop which could assist users to com-municate successfully in the mother tongue...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} {{and tests}} a definition-oriented approach to concept analysis. In this approach, a computerized knowledge management system called CODE {{is used to}} help the <b>terminologist</b> carry out concept analysis specifically aimed at constructing intensional (Aristotelian) definitions for a terminological knowledge base (TKB). The approach is developed by first exploring what the literature {{has to say about}} the intensional terminological definition (ITD) as a process, a product, and a tool. The primary conclusion that arises from this exploration is that ITDs for co-concepts must be consistent in content and form, and must clearly indicate the place of their respective concepts in the concept system. Second, this thesis looks at how a specific feature of the CODE system, the Characteristic Comparison Matrix (CCM), can be enhanced to facilitate definition-oriented concept analysis. The result is a powerful, flexible feature that aids the <b>terminologist</b> in recording consistent characteristics and selecting characteristics for definition construction. Third, this thesis proposes enhancements to an existing general approach to concept analysis. These enhancements are based on definition research, knowledge of CODE, and introspection, supported by previous experience performing general concept analysis with the COGNITERM Project. The result is an approach which allows the <b>terminologist</b> to carry out concept analysis in a methodical manner, using CODE to create good, consistent ITDs for a TKB. This approach is tested by creating a TKB for the subject field of lasers (concentrating on 16 concepts), complete with ITDs. The approach works quite well, although it requires some minor modifications. The definitions are consistent and contain only that information necessary to distinguish co-concepts from one another and to indicate their place within a concept system. Although CODE is helpful in facilitating definition-oriented concept analysis, some enhancements to the technology would make it even more useful...|$|E

30|$|Although ATE {{has been}} {{researched}} for more than 20 years, there is still room for improvement since term extraction is a difficult task {{even when it is}} carried out manually by a <b>terminologist.</b> This is due to the characteristics of the terminological units, which will be discussed in Section ‘Problems of the automatic term extraction’. As a result, the units identified by terminologists in specialized discourses are denominated ‘candidate terms’, and they usually undergo a manual step of validation, carried out by at least one domain expert. Only after this process may the validated candidates be called ‘terms’.|$|E

This wise, the linguistic expression is finally selected by the <b>terminologist</b> and sent for the appreciation of an expert in the domain. However, it must be assumed that the use of frequency does not obtain a completely satisfactory result, because there are some candidates that have a high frequency but are not terms of the domain. For example, the word ‘se refere’ (‘refer(s)’), ‘definido como’ (‘defined as’), ‘nós’ (‘we’), and ‘aquele’ (‘that’).|$|E
40|$|This paper aims at {{discussing}} {{the advantages of}} a methodology design grounded on a concept-based approach to Terminology applied to the most prominent scenario of current Higher Education: blended learning. Terminology is a discipline that aims at representing, describing and defining specialized knowledge through language, putting order into our universe (Nuopponen, 2011). Concepts, as elements {{of the structure of}} knowledge (Sager, 1990) emerge as a complex research object. Can they be found in language? A concept-based approach to Terminology implies a clear-cut view of the role of language in terminological work: though language is postulated as being a fundamental tool to grasp, describe and organize knowledge, an isomorphic relationship between language and knowledge cannot be taken for granted. In other words, the foundational premise of a concept-based approach {{is that there is no}} one-to-one correspondence between atomic elements of knowledge and atomic elements of linguistic expression. This is why a methodological approach to Terminology merely based upon specialized text research is regarded as biased (Costa, 2013). As a consequence, we argue that interactional strategies between <b>terminologist</b> and domain expert deserve particular research attention. To our mind, the key to concept-based terminological work is to carry out a concept analysis of data gathered from a specialised text corpora combined with an elicitation process of the tacit knowledge and concept-oriented discursive negotiation. Following such view, we put forward a methodology to answer the question: how is blended learning defined in the Post-Bologna scenario? Even though there are numerous high-quality models and practical descriptions for its implementation (similarly to other concepts related to distance learning), the need to understand, demarcate and harmonize the concept of blended learning against the current Higher Education background results from the premise that the theoretical reflection on this concept is still insufficient. Therefore, we believe it is vital to understand blended learning as the new normal in Higher Education (Norberg et al., 2011), or a negotiable third way (Peres, 2011; Norberg & Jahnke, 2014). Our methodological model is built in three phases: (1) exploratory phase in the area/ object of the study; (2) conceptual analysis phase of discourse and textual documents; (3) modeling and result validation phase. We support the thesis that the experimental nature of this approach discloses productivity in a cyclical sequence between the discursive and textual analysis with conceptual objectives, collaborative interaction and introspection. In other words, even though the nature of this study does not allow for a generalization (apart from a dual relation in the mediation between the <b>terminologist</b> and the specialist), we advocate the relevance of an action-reflection procedure, both introspective and collaborative, one in which the <b>terminologist</b> will become a conceptualizer, a decision-maker and an interventionist...|$|E

The general goal of our work is to help the structuration of terminologies. Two kinds of seman- tic variants can be found in traditional termi- nologies: strict synonymy links and fuzzier relations like see-also. We have designed three rules which exploit general dictionary information to infer synonymy relations between complex candidate terms. The results have been examined by a human <b>terminologist.</b> The expert has judged that half of the overall pairs of terms are relevant for the semantic variation. He validated {{an important part of the}} detected links as synonymy.

By working through a few examples of the correspondence between parts of the textual definitions and the axioms, we show how to compare and contrast each and how each perspective reveals areas for improvement. Having established a correspondence between the textual and logical parts of ontology term definitions, we discuss the possibility of developing tools that help developers improve their ontologies. Such tools could be used to check both the textual definitions against the asserted axioms and vice versa. In addition, we propose a few other ways of checking the contents of textual definitions.

40|$|Maritime English (ME), the {{international}} working {{language in the}} maritime industry, is a Language for Special Purpose (LSP) of which a spoken variant, SMCP, acts as a controlled safety language. Text-based studies of Maritime English, although scarce, point to a concise syntax and grammar, a formal and impersonal style and a preference for nouns and nominal groups. Using the theory of LSP, the thesis finds that depending on content, situation and subdomain, ME can firstly be seen as restrictive language mode; secondly as a deviant language mode; and thirdly as a preferred language mode. More corpus-based descriptive research into the linguistic features of written ME and of the spoken version (SMCP) is advised. As terms typically belong to LSP, the thesis looks into the theory and methodology of terminology. They can be of assistance in setting up a corporate Terminology Management System. The terminological principles of concept structure, precise concept/term definitions and source and context information help create a reliable knowledge database. Focussing on maritime terminology, the thesis concludes with a case study illustrating how a structured approach to maritime terminology processing {{with the help of}} a terminology management tool results in a consistent corporate terminology and more reliable information benefitting translation quality. These tools should be freely available, easy to operate and should use standardized database exchange formats. More research is needed on the use of pictures in terminology including their "translatability" and their role in the information exchange. Consistent use of corporate terminology must be promoted. This is the task of an organization's corporate communications department and management. They should also define the needs for terminology management, specifying the problem areas which will benefit from it. Organizations are advised to set up a well-structured TMS. This is the task of a <b>terminologist</b> who should also be responsible for terminology work, terminology management and maintenance of the system.

40|$|<b>Terminologists</b> scan {{large amounts}} of {{specialized}} texts to discover the terms for the concepts in a given subject field and to extract knowledge-rich contexts. These contexts make explicit, by means of linguistic structures, the semantic relations that exist between the concepts. Developing the subject field's conceptual network is called concept analysis. To carry out concept analysis, many <b>terminologists</b> are still using paper-based corpora. Yet this is time-consuming and error-prone. This thesis explores a semi-automatic approach to concept analysis that involves electronic corpora and knowledge extraction technology. My research focused on a program called the Text Analyzer (TA), which I tested for its effectiveness in retrieving knowledge-rich contexts from French and English electronic corpora in the subject field of composting. I first discovered the linguistic patterns that French and English use to express three semantic relations. The TA was then programmed with these patterns {{to be able to}} extract knowledge-rich contexts from the corpora. I then tested the TA's extraction capabilities and prepared statistics showing its effectiveness. Analysing the test results revealed ways to enhance the TA's performance. As a small follow-up experiment, I added more patterns to the TA and again tested its extraction effectiveness, which was improved. Up to that point, my focus was on lexical patterns. As part of the follow-up experiment, I also performed an exploratory test of the potential of grammatical patterns for knowledge extraction. This research revealed that much work is still needed to produce highly effective knowledge extraction programs. Even so, the statistics were encouraging and showed this technology's potential for dramatically reducing the time <b>terminologists</b> spend scanning corpora...|$|R
