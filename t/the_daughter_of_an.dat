5|$|Marquis {{was born}} December 19, 1869, {{on a farm}} near Osceola, Missouri. The family surname came from French {{ancestors}} who had been granted the hereditary title of Marquis. Marquis' great-great-grandfather was disinherited around 1768 for marrying beneath his station, to <b>the</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> English merchant. With no prospects in France, he emigrated to Virginia, where he took Marquis as a surname.|$|E

Their son Jesse (Ulysses's father) was a Whig Party supporter and abolitionist.|$|E
5|$|In late 1814 {{and early}} 1815, a rumour swept London that a pig-faced woman {{was living in}} Marylebone, an inner-city area of central London. Said to be <b>the</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{unspecified}} noblewoman, she was supposedly young, wealthy and living in fashionable Manchester Square. In some reports she was described {{as the daughter of}} a noblewoman from Grosvenor Square. It was claimed that she would occasionally venture out of the house in a carriage, hidden by a heavy veil; several letters to the London newspapers reported sightings of a snout protruding from a window, or a veiled, silhouetted pig's head in a passing carriage.|$|E

In 1935, she rowed for the ladies' university eight, in the first real Women's boat race against Oxford. She gained an honours degree in physics, which was not awarded because it was before women were allowed Cambridge degrees. In her seventies, in 1987, she was honoured with the degree of Doctor of Laws honoris causa by the University of Strathclyde.|$|E

The marriage was unusual because he was a widower of fifty, while the bride was only seventeen. Very few details are known of their domestic life. They had three daughters, Martha, Margaret, and Elizabeth.|$|E
5|$|The Blaj-based Făgăraș and Alba Iulia Archdiocese {{arranged}} for Agârbiceanu {{to study at}} the theology faculty of Budapest University between 1900 and 1904. Publishing more works in Tribuna and Familia, he soon became {{a regular contributor to}} Luceafărul. Returning to Blaj after graduation, he supervised the local boys' boarding school, working there during the 1904–1905 academic year. Urged by friends and receiving a church scholarship, he returned to Budapest to study literature. He spent just one semester there, during which he also taught primary school catechism. In March 1906, he married Maria Reli Radu, <b>the</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> archpriest from Ocna Mureș.|$|E
5|$|Thored's {{relationship}} with the English monarchy under Æthelred II {{seems to have been}} good. Ælfgifu, the first wife of King Æthelred II, was probably Thored's daughter. Evidence for this is that in the 1150s Ailred of Rievaulx in his De genealogia regum Anglorum wrote that the wife of Æthelred II was <b>the</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ealdorman (comes) called Thored (Thorth). Historian Pauline Stafford argued that this marriage was evidence that Thored had been a local rather than royal appointment to the ealdormanry of York, and that Æthelred II's marriage was an attempt to woo Thored. Stafford was supported in this argument by Richard Fletcher.|$|E

5|$|To help {{publicize}} the production, Ince {{reported to the}} newspapers that lead-actress Tsuru Aoki {{was a native of}} the island of Sakura and she had lost all her relatives in the eruption—she was actually from Obara Tsuru city, Kyushu, 180 miles north of Sakura-Jima. Ince also embroidered her biography so that she would appeal to the middle-class audiences as the heroine of a melodrama, claiming that she was <b>the</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> illustrious Japanese artist. The biographical-type publicity added emotional and psychological authenticity to the character that Aoki played in the film.|$|E
5|$|William Shakespeare {{was the son}} of John Shakespeare, an {{alderman}} and {{a successful}} glover originally from Snitterfield, and Mary Arden, <b>the</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> affluent landowning farmer. He was born in Stratford-upon-Avon and baptised there on 26 April 1564. His actual date of birth remains unknown, but is traditionally observed on 23 April, Saint George's Day. This date, which {{can be traced back to}} an 18th-century scholar's mistake, has proved appealing to biographers because Shakespeare died on 23 April 1616. He was the third child of eight and the eldest surviving son.|$|E
5|$|According to Njáls saga, Gilli {{was seated}} on Kola or Kolu, an island {{that appears to}} refer to Coll or perhaps Colonsay. The saga also states that Gilli was married to Sigurðr's sister, Hvarflǫð. This marital {{alliance}} appears to further evince the southward extension of Sigurðr's influence. This union, along with the record of apparent amiable dealings with Sigurðr's associates, suggests that Gilli and Sigurðr indeed enjoyed close relations. The earl's family was clearly not adverse to marrying into native dynasties, as Sigurðr's own mother was <b>the</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Irish king, whilst his wife {{was the daughter of}} a Scottish king. In fact, the aforesaid sources appear to indicate that Gilli operated in the Hebrides as a tributary earl to his brother-in-law. Certainly, Eyrbyggja saga states that Sigurðr left menn ("agents") in the Hebrides to collect tax from Mann, whilst Orkneyinga saga reveals that, at a later period in time, Sigurðr's son and successor, Þórfinnr Sigurðarson, Earl of Orkney (died c. 1065), tasked a member of his own wife's family, Kálfr Árnason (died 1051), to impose Orcadian authority in the Isles.|$|E

5|$|Fakih {{was born}} in Gresik, East Java, Dutch East Indies, on 2 March 1904. His father, Usman Iskandar, was a wood merchant, and his mother, a housewife, was <b>the</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ulama (scholar of Islam). The couple, who were of modest means, had four other children, and the family's lack of a noble {{background}} meant the children were ineligible to receive an education at Dutch-run schools. Instead, Fakih studied Islam from a young age, receiving much of his instruction from his father. At the age of ten he began studying at a pesantren (Islamic boarding school) in Gresik, finishing four years later. In 1919 he continued his studies at several pesantren outside the city, including ones in rural Gresik and in nearby Bungah.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, at {{a psychic}} event in California, Ruth was {{introduced}} to Ernest Norman, who told her that in a past life she had been <b>the</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Egyptian Pharaoh and had protected Moses. Members of the organization they later established, the Unarius Academy of Science, affirm that Ernest and Ruth married on the day they met, and the group celebrates their anniversary as February14, 1954. However, Diana Tumminia of California State University, Sacramento, notes in her 2005 study {{of the group that}} Ruth was probably still married to George Marian in early 1954 and speculates that their divorce was a lengthy process; Tumminia posits that Ernest and Ruth married in 1956.|$|E
5|$|Santa Santita, or Magdalena, The Unholy Saint, is a 2004 Filipino film {{starring}} Angelica Panganiban and Jericho Rosales, {{directed by}} Laurice Guillen. The film follows Malen, <b>the</b> <b>daughter</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> intercessor, her {{love affair with}} a hustler and gigolo, and her confrontation of the evil within her life. Based on a script by Jerry Gracio, the film {{was picked up by}} Guillen in 2000 but did not start production because an appropriate actress for Malen could not be found. After picking Panganiban, Guillen began work, and the eventual film was released on November 17, 2004, in the Philippines and March 11, 2005, internationally. Receiving good reviews from Variety and the Philippine Daily Inquirer, Santa Santita was one of only two films to be rated as Grade A by the Cinema Evaluation Board of the Philippines, and represented the Philippines at the Asiaticafilmediale festival in Italy and the Bangkok International Film Festival.|$|E
