40|$|The survivable, {{adaptable}} {{fiber optic}} embeddable network (SAFENET) is a draft standard for local area networking (LAN) {{developed by the}} Navy which, when adopted, will become a military standard. The standard is being developed for procurement specifications of computer resources to be used on ships and aircraft and {{has some of the}} real-time concerns that network standards for space vehicles have. Architecture and survivability are considered. It is noted that the token-ring LAN must implement the IEEE 802. 5 recommended practice for dual ring reconfiguration, which is currently being reviewed for inclusion into the IEEE standard. A <b>trunk</b> <b>coupling</b> <b>unit</b> is used at each station to isolate a station from the ring in case of failure. Up to five stations can be bypassed in this fashion. Communication architecture has an OSI profile but differs from the standard concept of the seven layers by allowing alternate suits and breaking the layers into three groupings of services to allow for physical interfacing. It also provides several paths, even if only one profile is used. Management and synchronization protocols are discussed and security issues are addressed. Implications for aerospace applications are considered and it is projected that interoperability with the Navy and other U. S. Government systems may require SAFENET specifications for NASA systems...|$|E

40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the {{kinetics}} of condensation reactions in phosphotriester synthesis of oligonucleotides on polystyrene copolymer resin support, using monomers, dimers, and trimers as the <b>coupling</b> <b>units.</b> The condensations follow pseudo first order kinetics, with a rate constant that decreases from monomers to dimers to trimers. Arrhenius plots indicate a nearly constant activation energy of around 10. 4 kcal mol- 1. Extrapolation to find the Arrhenius preexponential factor, A, is inaccurate because of the limited temperature range studied. But if the assumption is made that Ea is the same for monomer, dimer, and trimer reactions, then the A values are inversely proportional to the surface areas of the <b>coupling</b> <b>units,</b> reinforcing the interpretation of A as a collision efficiency factor...|$|R

40|$|In the {{preparation}} of small organic paramagnets, these structures may conceptually be divided into spin-containing units (SCs) and ferromagnetic <b>coupling</b> <b>units</b> (FCs). The synthesis and direct observation {{of a series of}} hydrocarbon tetraradicals designed to test the ferromagnetic coupling ability of m-phenylene, 1, 3 -cyclobutane, 1, 3 - cyclopentane, and 2, 4 -adamantane (a chair 1, 3 -cyclohexane) using Berson TMMs and cyclobutanediyls as SCs are described. While 1, 3 -cyclobutane and m-phenylene are good ferromagnetic <b>coupling</b> <b>units</b> under these conditions, the ferromagnetic coupling ability of 1, 3 -cyclopentane is poor, and 1, 3 -cyclohexane is apparently an antiferromagnetic <b>coupling</b> <b>unit.</b> In addition, this is the first report of ferromagnetic coupling between the spins of localized biradical SCs. The poor coupling of 1, 3 -cyclopentane has enabled a study of the variable temperature behavior of a 1, 3 -cyclopentane FC-based tetraradical in its triplet state. Through fitting the observed data to the usual Boltzman statistics, {{we have been able to}} determine the separation of the ground quintet and excited triplet states. From this data, we have inferred the singlet-triplet gap in 1, 3 -cyclopentanediyl to be 900 cal/mol, in remarkable agreement with theoretical predictions of this number. The ability to simulate EPR spectra has been crucial to the assignments made here. A powder EPR simulation package is described that uses the Zeeman and dipolar terms to calculate powder EPR spectra for triplet and quintet states. Methods for characterizing paramagnetic samples by SQUID magnetometry have been developed, including robust routines for data fitting and analysis. A precursor to a potentially magnetic polymer was prepared by ring-opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP), and doped samples of this polymer were studied by magnetometry. While the present results are not positive, calculations have suggested modifications in this structure which should lead to the desired behavior. Source listings for all computer programs are given in the appendix. ...|$|R
