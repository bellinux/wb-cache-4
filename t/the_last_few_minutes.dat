Solskjær, Lauren and Forlán scored, but Pirès missed – his effort saved by Howard – which won United the Shield, 4–3 on penalties.|$|E
5|$|Beurre Maître d'Hôtel {{is usually}} served cold as sliced disks atop various foods, and {{sometimes}} {{as a side}} condiment. It is used on grilled meats such as steak and fish, and also on eggs, vegetables, potatoes and breads. Some variations exist, including a few sweet versions that include sugar, which may be used on dishes such as pancakes. When used as a topping, it is typically added just before the dish is served. It has also been served melted atop dishes, whereby it is placed atop foods during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> of cooking. It {{may be used in}} the place of a sauce, and a small amount can significantly add to a dish's overall flavor.|$|E

25|$|A {{team that}} is losing by one or two goals in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> of play will often elect to pull the goalie; that is, remove the goaltender and replace him or her with an extra {{attacker}} on the ice {{in the hope of}} gaining enough advantage to score a goal. However, it is an act of desperation, as it sometimes leads to the opposing team extending their lead by scoring a goal in the empty net.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the late}} 2000s, several American {{networks}} {{have begun to}} start certain shows shortly before or after :00 or :30 past the hour to avert audience loss. Global does not necessarily follow this practice, meaning <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> of the preceding show may be lost to those watching the U.S. network. For instance, if NBC schedules The Apprentice to start at 9:02, but Global schedules its start for exactly 9:00, the last two minutes of NBC's 8:00 program may be blocked by the Global signal. This {{is not unique to}} Global and may vary by service provider, since cable/satellite providers, not the networks, are responsible for scheduling and initiating simsubs.|$|E

25|$|Realising {{that she}} and K-9 are {{effectively}} on their own, she tries {{to figure out how}} to stop the sacrifice. Her first order of business is determining the when of it. Using Lavinia's books on witchcraft, she and K-9 deduce it must occur at midnight on the winter solstice, now just a few short hours away. The where of it is more elusive, however, causing the duo to drive around the shire looking at all the churches. As <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> before midnight tick away, they finally realise that there's an abandoned chapel on Lavinia's property. Rushing home, K-9 and Sarah are briefly upset at missing something that was right under their noses all along.|$|E
25|$|Four days later, Southampton {{travelled}} to Craven Cottage to face Fulham in the Boxing Day fixture. The game started poorly for the Saints, who conceded {{after only}} eight minutes when Dimitar Berbatov converted {{from inside the}} six-yard box to put the hosts up by one goal. The first half saw very few additional chances for either side, and Fulham went into half time a goal to the better. The second half was relatively uneventful, until in the 85th minute Southampton were awarded a penalty due to a handball by former Saints player Chris Baird. Rickie Lambert scored the penalty, and in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> Gastón Ramírez also came close, but ultimately it ended 1–1.|$|E
50|$|According to Albert W. Spruill, {{the origin}} of the school's Bulldog mascot stems from a tale of a {{shepherd}} dog, that was kept on the A&T farm to assist in herding the animals to shelter. During a football game the Aggies had become despondent and tn <b>the</b> game's <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> an A&T fullback broke through the opposition's defense and scored a touchdown that was ruled no good by a referee. It is said that at that moment, an unidentified person untied the bulldog which then attacked the referee. The incident was said to almost cost the school its membership in the CIAA, but it vindicated the Aggies. It is said that from that day on, the mascot for the football team has been a bulldog.|$|R

25|$|Task Review: Alpha wisely {{spent their}} time {{sourcing}} items before setting off, but had initial difficulties {{when they arrived}} at the market. However, they managed to collect all ten items without penalties, with Helene and Raef bargaining well for the cow hide and obtaining a second-hand Santos orange juicer in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes,</b> despite buying it for a fair price. Meanwhile, Renaissance's execution of the task was a shambles, as Jennifer paid little attention to the dossiers, deciding to straight to the market and thus resulting in the team being disorganised and making mistakes, such as buying the wrong colour of mosque alarm clock, while Jenny and Michael attempted to bribe a sports store so to sabotage Alpha's efforts. The team effectively lost the task due to a combination of these mistakes, and the fines they received for purchasing unbranded tajines and a halal chicken instead of a kosher chicken.|$|E
25|$|Jets quarterback Joe Namath made an {{appearance}} {{three days before}} the Super Bowl at the Miami Touchdown Club and brashly guaranteed a victory. His team backed up his words by controlling most of the game, building a 16–0 lead by the fourth quarter off of a touchdown run by Matt Snell and three field goals by Jim Turner. Colts quarterback Earl Morrall threw three interceptions before being replaced by Johnny Unitas, who then led Baltimore to its only touchdown, during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>few</b> <b>minutes</b> of the game. With the victory, the Jets became (and remain) the only winning Super Bowl team to score only one touchdown (either offensive, defensive, or special teams). Namath, who completed 17 out of 28 passes for 206 yards, was named as the Super Bowl's most valuable player, despite not throwing a touchdown pass in the game or any passes at all in the fourth quarter.|$|E

As the novel progresses, he becomes a religious celebrity and is credited for ideas and predictions that aren't really his. By {{the end of the}} story, he is wrongly believed to be a mass murderer. His story is recounted as an autobiography spoken into the black box of a plane he has hijacked and which is due to crash in just a few hours.

Ambient and diluted fractions of O2 and CO2 are measured for a known ventilation rate, and O2 consumption and CO2 production are determined and converted into Resting Energy Expenditure.|$|R
