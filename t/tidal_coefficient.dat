40|$|International audienceNumerous field-based {{investigations}} have highlighted that {{the production of}} extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) is physico-chemically and ecologically important for intertidal mudflats. EPS are largely secreted by marine benthic diatoms and their quantity and quality are environmental-dependant. This paper focused on the dynamic pathways, concentration rates and monosaccharides composition of colloidal, bound and residual carbohydrates extracted by using a cationic exchange resin from a diatom-dominated intertidal mudflat (Marennes-Oléron, France) during two different sampling periods: winter (February 2008) and summer (July 2008). A wide range of biotic and abiotic parameters were also studied {{to better understand the}} effect of environmental parameters, e. g., chlorophyll a, salinity, porewater amount, emersion time, luminosity, C:N ratio and <b>tidal</b> <b>coefficient.</b> Multiple colorimetric assays coupled to gas chromatographic analyseswere carried out to performthe biochemical characterizations. Firstly, the quantity of carbohydrates produced during winter (5. 28 μg*μg chl a− 1) was more important than during summer (2. 04 μg*μg chl a− 1). Yet, more proteins were found during summer for the colloidal and bound fractions (0. 73 and 1. 04 μg*μg chl a− 1). Further investigations showed that the dynamic pathways were equivalent between winter and summer: bound carbohydrates (BC) quantities increased during the sediment emersion periods on the contrary to colloidal carbohydrates (CC) which tended to drop throughout the emersion time. The quality in monosaccharides was fraction-dependant, whatever the season. CC were always glucose-rich confirming their role of carbon source. BC were mainly composed of rhamnose whose the ratio increased during the emersion period, thus conferring adhesive properties to the extracellular matrix bounding diatoms cells. Residual carbohydrates (RC) were composed of various monosaccharides and a major increase of glucose content was found at the end of emersion, corresponding to intracellular C-storage in prevention to immersion times. Summer-RC were composed of fucose, a monosaccharide specific to these fractions and which was non-present during the winter campaign. Environmental parameters, such as salinity, pore water amount, and <b>tidal</b> <b>coefficient</b> could {{have a significant impact on}} the concentration rates and pathways of carbohydrates...|$|E
40|$|Mineral {{suspended}} solids are a strong source of ackscattered light within coastal shelf seas. Backscattered light {{has a direct}} relationship to remotely-sensed reflectance, measured by satellites. For four decades, remote-sensing algorithms {{have been used to}} estimate the concentration of suspended particulate matter (SPM). Present algorithms for SPMassume that the mass-specific backscattering coefficient (b⇤bp(667 nm) = bbp(667 nm) /SPM) is constant. Chapter III aimed to explore how observations of the influence of particle compositon upon backscattering could be incorporated into remote-sensing algorithms to improve our representation of b⇤bp(667 nm). Field observations showed that bbp ⇤ (667 nm) varies with the size, cross-sectional surface area and mineral content of particles, in addition to the total concentration of {{suspended solids}}. Observations showed that the increase in concentration related to an increase in the mineral content of the particles, presumed to be causing the relationship between concentration and b⇤bp(667 nm). b⇤bp was shown to vary by a factor of 4, therefore using the latter relationship, iterative estimation of b⇤bp(667 nm) suggested that it could be possible to reduce the assumption made in future algorithms for the remotely-sensed SPM, by a similar factor. Using the ocean colour satellite archive of remotely-sensed SPM concentration from MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) on the Aqua satellite, it is possible to produce statistical models based upon dominant forcings of tides, wind-driven waves and chlorophyll-a. Chlorophyll-a is used as an estimation of phytoplankton biomass, with increases in concentration expected to relate to increased particle size and thus increases in the particle settling speed (ws) of suspended sediments. These have the potential to predict the concentration when atmospheric correction fails. Atmospheric correction failure is most commonly due to the presence of cloud (in addition to cloud shadowing, land, high concentrations of coccoliths or coastal adjacency), which lead to a lack of data in a given pixel (Ardanuy et al., 1991). Rivier et al. (2012) used average observed values of SPM concentration, a <b>tidal</b> <b>coefficient,</b> the significant wave height and chlorophyll-a concentration to predict the SPM concentration in the English Channel. Chapter IV aimed to improve upon Rivier et al. (2012), looking at a wider subject area and improving representation of tides and ws. Tidal inclusion was improved through the use of localised model predictions of tide for every pixel in comparison to a standardised single-location <b>tidal</b> <b>coefficient</b> based upon the tidal amplitude in Brest for the entire English Channel. This study expanded the region to the entire European shelf, included data from a global tidal model and used higher frequency wind speed observations to improve upon the results of Rivier et al. (2012). Furthermore, a crucial shortcoming of Rivier et al. (2012) is the use of single yearlong regression coefficients. The coefficients in this study were allowed to vary seasonally with a sinusoidal form, where the influence of forcings upon the subsequent concentrations varies seasonally. A sinusoidal coefficient was used upon the forcings to represent the e↵ect of flocculation and the influence upon ws. These improvements demonstrate a substantial improvement upon the framework of the present statistical model for suspended particulate matter concentration developed by Rivier et al. (2012). Chapter V aimed to test the influence of ws upon SPM concentration and how well a simple model could be used to represent remotely-sensed observations of SPM. To examine the influence of ws upon the SPM concentration, a simple numerical turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) based resuspension model was used to predict the surface concentration on the northwest European shelf (Elliot & Clarke, 1991; Bowers, 2003). Using a seasonally-imposed ws, the model was shown to perform well when compared to satellite observations. The model identified the importance of ws on the influence of the hydrodynamic forcings of the wind and tides. Bowers (2003) predicted that spring-neap variation in SPM would vary seasonally due to changes in ws. Chapter VI aimed to test this assumption using the remote-sensing archive and examine whether it was possible to quantify ws using the spring-neap variability. Spring-neap variation in the remotely-sensed SPM concentration was shown to be modulated seasonally. In the winter, the range of concentration observed was greater than in the summer. Following results from the numerical model, this variability was proposed to be due to seasonal changes in ws. Quantifying this variation, the bulk ws was estimated through remote-sensing using a novel method. Remotely-sensed observations of the range of concentrations observed over the spring-neap tidal cycle were related to the seasonal variability in ws. Estimates of bulk ws were comparable in magnitude to field observations. ws was shown to peak in the summer, with some locations experiencing additional peaks in the spring and autumn, corresponding with localised blooms. This was proposed to be due to increased phytoplankton productivity, which leads to increases in EPS (extracellular polymeric substances), promoting flocculation and therefore increasing the speed of particle settling...|$|E

40|$|European eels (Anguilla Anguilla), an {{endangered}} species with high economic value, exhibit very unusual features in their multistage catadromous life cycle at different life stages. The reproduction of eel {{takes place in the}} Sargasso Sea. Leptocephalus larvae use ocean currents (mainly the Gulf Stream) to migrate to European coastal areas, and then metamorphose into glass eels probably as they reach the continental shelf. Glass eel then, enter estuaries to join the fresh waters network. Knowledge about glass eel biology and migration has mainly increased in the eighties, and it is now well established that the activity during the estuary migration depends mainly on tidal cycle, even if lunar and circadian rhythms and/or direct influence of light and <b>tidal</b> <b>coefficient</b> may interact. Different migratory tactics are suspected on the basis of recent laboratory experiments (Bolliet & Labonne, 2008; Bureau du Colombier et al., 2009), notably the existence of individuals swimming only with the current, others swimming with and against the current, and others presenting a weak degree of activity. The propensity to migrate and glass eels energy content would be linked and may result in different migratory behaviours possibly leading to estuarine settlement (Bureau du Colombier et al., 2007; 2009). Unfortunately, few are known about the glass eel swimming behaviours in estuaries, a crucial point to better understand their estuarine migration: such knowledge would help to characterize the migratory tactics and to better understand the link with energy status. The videotracking system [EthoVision Color-Pro 3. 1 (Noldus Information Technology) ] which allows to measure automatically the movements of individuals represents an interesting tool to progress in this questioning. Nowadays, video tracking to measure fish behaviours is relatively frequent, but is rather rare in the ecological studies. Moreover, tracking a transparent animal, under water current conditions is a real challenge, particularly at night. To detect the individuals, several eels are marked by a fluorescent VIE tag (Visible Implant Elastomer, Northwest Marine Technology Inc.). VIE do no affect growth, survival and behaviour of tagged glass eels. Initially developed to improve the identification of individual tags in mark-recapture studies of aquatic animals, VIE tags are used here for a new extreme application in ethometry: the study of behaviours of transparent animals in weaker luminosity and in the dark by automatic tracking technology. The individual identification is based on the fluorescent color (red, blue, yellow and green) emitted by the VIE tag injected in the muscle mass on the basis of dorsal fin. The detection of the four marks is excellent. It allows measuring the activity (notably path and speed) of each tagged individuals as a function of tidal and nycthemeral rhythms in the same chronotron (circular aquarium simulating the estuarine conditions) and spatial use at a wide time scale from second to week. Another advantage is the possibility of tracked animals to go out the analysed arena without error of identification when it appears again in the analysed zone. This multitracking method by fluorescent VIE tags could be applied to a large number of species (crustaceans, fish, holothurians, amphibians, …).

Typical root-mean-square (RMS) differences of GNSS-MR derived sea level time series with respect to nearby tide gauges are {{on the order of}} 6 – 40 [*]cm, sufficiently accurate to estimate tidal and secular sea level variations but are possibly biased due to delay of the signal through the troposphere.

We find a bias in the estimated heights that is elevation and height dependent and can reach orders of 1 [*]m for a 90 [*]m site. Without correcting for tropospheric delay we find that GNSS-MR estimated <b>tidal</b> <b>coefficients</b> will be smaller than their true amplitudes by around 2 % while phases seem unaffected.

Multiple recent missions have mapped the global lunar gravity field, each one improving upon the resolution of the last. The details of the Moon's deepest structure, including the parameters that define the lunar core, however, were still largely unaddressed by pre-GRAIL gravity measurements, which were not high enough resolution to resolve the <b>tidal</b> <b>coefficients</b> at a sufficient degree of accuracy. Current constraints on core size and state arise from other indirect measurements, including lunar laser ranging, magnetic induction studies, and analyses of elemental abundances in depth-derived mare basalts.

Seismology provides the most direct constraints on the variables that govern the dynamic properties of the body. However, the GRAIL mission's high-resolution measurements of the lunar gravity field are being used to constrain the interior structure of the Moon using a "crust to core" approach. GRAIL's constraints on crustal thickness, mantle structure, core radius and stratification, and core state (solid vs. molten) therefore complement seismic investigations.

This development has incorporated {{the present state of}} the art results in satellite geodesy and have relied upon a more consistent set of reference constants than was heretofore utilized in GSFC's GEM models. The solutions are complete in spherical harmonic coefficients out to degree 50 for the gravity field parameters. These models include adjustment for a subset of 66 ocean <b>tidal</b> <b>coefficients</b> for the long wavelength components of 12 major ocean tides. This tidal adjustment was made in the presence of 550 other fixed ocean tidal terms representing 32 major and minor ocean tides and the Wahr frequency dependent solid earth tidal model. In addition 5 -day averaged values for Earth rotation and polar motion were derived for the time period of 1980 onward. Two types of models were computed. These are satellite only models relying exclusively on tracking data and combination models which have incorporated satellite altimetry and surface gravity data. The satellite observational data base consists of over 1100 orbital arcs of data on 31 satellites. A large percentage of these observations were provided by third generation laser stations (less than 5 cm). A calibration of the model accuracy of the GEM-T 2 satellite only solution indicated that it was a significant improvement over previous models based solely upon tracking data. The rms geoid error for this field is 110 cm to degree and order 36. This is a major advancement over GEM-T 1 whose errors were estimated to be 160 cm. An error propagation using the covariances of the GEM-T 2 model for the TOPEX radial orbit component indicates that the rms radial errors are expected to be 12 cm.

40|$|Abstract. Laskar and Robutel (1993) have {{globally}} {{analyzed the}} stability of the planetary obliquities in a conservative framework. Here the same model is extended by adding dissipative effects in the Earth–Moon system: the body tides and the friction between the core and the mantle. Some constraints on the poorly known coefficients of dissipation are determined with the help of paleogeological observations. One consequence is that the scenario proposed by Williams (1993) for the past history of the Earth’s obliquity seems unlikely. A synthesis of 500 numerical integrations of the Earth–Moon system with orbital perturbations for the next 5 Gyr is presented. It is shown that the time scale of the dissipative effects is long enough to induce an adiabatic–like evolution of the obliquity which is driven in the chaotic zone within 1. 5 to 4. 5 Gyr. A statistical study of possible evolutions conducted with a <b>tidal</b> dissipation <b>coefficient</b> ∆t of 600 seconds demonstrated that 68. 4 % of the trajectories attained an obliquity larger than 81 degrees, with a maximum of 89. 5 degrees.

We assume that the characteristic size of the perturbed two-body system is {{much smaller than the}} wavelength of the wave. Moreover, we also suppose that the wave's frequency is much smaller than the particle's orbital one. We make neither a priori assumptions about the direction of the wavevector nor on the orbital geometry of the planet. We find that, while the semi-major axis is left unaffected, the eccentricity, the inclination, the longitude of the ascending node, the longitude of pericenter and the mean anomaly undergo non-vanishing long-term changes. They are not secular trends because of the slow modulation introduced by the <b>tidal</b> matrix <b>coefficients</b> and by the orbital elements themselves. They could be useful to indepenedently constrain the ultra-low frequency waves which may have been indirectly detected in the BICEP 2 experiment.

Still, a 1 -D model of sea level rise in an estuary must account for the three-dimensional effects where increased depths will affect density driven (baroclinic) circulation and tidal dispersion of salt. In this paper, we use a simplified Delta network model with a tidally averaged computational approach to quickly perform multi-year simulations for sea level rise. The 1 -D model uses <b>tidal</b> dispersion <b>coefficients</b> developed from 3 -D hydrodynamic models. The resulting model is capable of performing very fast simulations over a wide range of conditions, providing guidance on what should be explored in depth with more detailed, but slower models. Comparisons of unimpaired Delta inflow with the historical case show that the south Delta and San Joaquin River would be much fresher without exports, while the Sacramento River would be fresher in spring and more saline in the fall. Sea level rise will increase salinity throughout the Delta over time. With peripheral conveyance of export, water salinity will intrude upstream in the Sacramento River, be slightly lower up the San Joaquin River and increase in the south Delta. With sea level rise, peripheral conveyance will have similar trends to changes to the historical case, but export salinity will be improved by the peripheral conveyance component. A larger peripheral conveyance can benefit both the ecosystem and exports if managed properly. ...|$|R
40|$|Variations in {{rotation}} and {{orientation of the}} Moon are sensitive to solid-body tidal dissipation, dissipation due to relative motion at the fluid-core/ solid-mantle boundary, and tidal Love number k 2. There is weaker sensitivity to flattening of the core-mantle boundary (CMB) and fluid core moment of inertia. Accurate Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR) measurements of the distance from observatories on the Earth to four retroreflector arrays on the Moon are sensitive to lunar {{rotation and}} orientation variations and tidal displacements. Past solutions using the LLR data have given results for dissipation due to solid-body tides and fluid core plus Love number. Past detection of CMB flattening has been marginal but is improving, while direct detection of the core moment {{has not yet been}} achieved. Three decades of Lunar Laser Ranging (LLR) data are analyzed using a weighted least-squares approach. The lunar solution parameters include dissipation at the fluid-core/solid-mantle boundary, <b>tidal</b> dissipation, dissipation-related <b>coefficients</b> for rotation and orientation terms, potential Love number k 2, a correction to the constant term in the tilt of the equator to the ecliptic which is meant to approximate the influence of core-mantle boundary flattening, and displacement Love numbers h 2 and l 2. Several solutions, with different combinations of solution parameters and constraints, are considered...|$|R
40|$|We present new Fokker-Planck {{models of}} the {{evolution}} of globular clusters, including gravitational tidal shocks. We extend our calculations beyond the core collapse by adopting three-body binary heating. Effects of the shocks are included by adding the <b>tidal</b> shock diffusion <b>coefficients</b> to the ordinary Fokker-Planck equation: the first order heating term, 〈∆E〉, and the second order energy dispersion term, 〈∆E 2 〉. As an example, we investigate the evolution of models for the globular cluster NGC 6254. Using the Hipparcos proper motions, we are now able to construct orbits of this cluster in the Galaxy. Tidal shocks accelerate significantly both core collapse and the evaporation of the cluster and shorten the destruction time from 24 Gyr to 18 Gyr. We examine various types of adiabatic corrections and find that they are critical for accurate calculation of the evolution. Without adiabatic corrections, the destruction time of the cluster is twice as short. We examine cluster evolution {{for a wide range of}} the concentration and tidal shock parameters, and determine the region of the parameter space where tidal shocks dominate the evolution. We present fitting formulae for the core collapse time and the destruction time, covering all reasonable initial conditions. In the limit of strong shocks, the typical value of the core collapse time decreases from 10 trh to 3 trh or less, while the destruction time is just twice that number. The effects of tidal shocks are rapidly self-limiting: as clusters lose mass and become more compact, the importance of the shocks diminishes. This implies that tidal shocks were more important in the past...|$|R
40|$|Although other {{engineers}} had considered {{the relationship between}} tidal prism and inlet crosssectional area before, it is O’Brien who is usually credited for deriving the familiar relationship A = aPm, where A is the cross-sectional area (relative to mean sea level) and P is the spring <b>tidal</b> prism. The <b>coefficients</b> a and m vary from entrance to entrance; however O’Brien (1969) showed that for 28 US entrances, a= 4. 69 10 - 4 and m= 0. 85 are best-fit values applicable to all entrances when P is measured in cubic meters (m³) and A in square meters (m²). Many different suggestions {{have been made in}} literature about the rationale behind the above relation. We explore here some theoretical elaborations inspired by this literature. The most popular elaboration is to express A in terms of the so named “stability shear stress”, which in the approaches of Gerritsen (1990) and Friedrichs (1995) is defined as the shear stress needed to maintain a zero net transport gradient along the channel, which is assumed close to the critical shear stress for sediment motion. However, one may claim as posed by Kraus (1998) that this shear stress is not necessarily equal to the critical shear stress, since a certain transport capacity is necessary to remove the sediment deposited by the littoral or alongshore drift. This contribution compares some theoretical elaborations both qualitatively and quantitatively, confront these with US and Dutch empirical data and discuss their pros and cons for practical applications.
