40|$|The {{majority}} of rabies cases {{reported to the}} Centers for Disease Control each year occur in wildlife including skunks, raccoons, bats, foxes, and coyotes. Currently, oral rabies vaccination campaigns are employed to immunize coyotes, foxes, and raccoons. Though skunks are vectors of 6 rabies strains, there is currently no effective oral vaccine or delivery system for skunks. More information {{is needed to determine}} if baits currently used are sufficiently attractive to skunks, or if the baits are difficult for skunks to handle and consume. We observed bait manipulation by skunks in penned/feeding trials to determine <b>the</b> <b>bait</b> <b>type</b> most conducive to ingestion and delivery of a mock vaccine to skunks. Smaller baits were easier for skunks to manipulate and consume, and vaccine containers coated with bait facilitated sachet puncture and increased the potential for vaccine delivery. Our information will be useful in the development of baits and vaccine containers for large-scale rabies vaccination campaigns that target skunks...|$|E
40|$|Most {{studies of}} factors {{affecting}} catching efficiency and selectivity in longlining {{have focused on}} various gear parameters (mainline and snood material, hook design and size, rigging) and on <b>the</b> <b>bait</b> (<b>type</b> and size), and few studies have investigated how catch rates {{are affected by the}} way the gear is operated during fishing. We carried out fishing experiments to study the effects of setting time, setting direction (relative to the current direction) and soak time on catch rates of cod (Gadus morhua) and haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus). Lines set before dawn and lines set across the current gave higher catch rates of haddock than lines set after dawn and {{in the same direction as}} the current, respectively. Similar effects were not found for cod, and these differences between haddock and cod were explained by differences in behaviour and interspecific competition for the available baits. Soak time was not found to significantly affect the catch rates of either species, indicating that other factors have a more pronounced effect on longline catch rates and may therefore mask the effect of soak time...|$|E

40|$|Summary: This {{study was}} {{initiated}} {{in response to}} concerns that vertebrate pest control operations in New Zealand may be having deleterious impacts on invertebrate populations and, secondarily, on insectivorous non-target vertebrate populations. Invertebrates feeding on non-toxic <b>baits</b> of <b>the</b> <b>types</b> used for vertebrate pest control were collected and identified. <b>The</b> <b>bait</b> <b>types</b> were diced carrots and three <b>types</b> of cereal-based <b>baits</b> (No. 7, RS 5, and AgTech). The {{study was conducted in}} two rata/kamahi dominated forests (Bell Hill Scenic Reserve and Kopara Forest, West Coast), in July and September 1996. The most common species found on <b>baits</b> was <b>the</b> ant Huberia brouni (Hymenoptera: Formicidae). Other common taxa were Orthoptera (at least eight species of weta including Zealandosandrus aff. gracilis, Gymnoplectron sp., and Pleioplectron sp.), Coleoptera (at least nine species of beetles including Saphobius nitidulus, Nestrius sp., and Phrynixus sp.), Dermaptera (at least one species of the earwig Parisolabis sp.), Opiliones (at least three species of harvestmen), and Acarina (at least three species of mites).

The main aim {{was to determine the}} effect of both hook size and <b>bait</b> <b>type</b> on <b>the</b> catch rate (mean weight) and size composition of Nile perch (Lates niloticus) (LINNE) fishery in the Napoleon Gulf, Lake Victoria. The main hook sizes investigated during the experiment were 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 that were dominantly used in harvesting Nile perch in Napoleon Gulf, Lake Victoria. In this study length, weight and <b>bait</b> <b>type</b> data were collected on site from each boat at that particular fishing spot; since most fishermen in the Napoleon Gulf could sell their fish immediately the catch is caught there and then. The results indicated a total of 873 Nile perch fish samples collected during the study. Statistical tests, descriptive statistics, regression and correlation were all carried out using the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) in addition to Microsoft excel. <b>The</b> <b>bait</b> <b>types</b> in <b>the</b> Gulf ranged from 5 - 10 cm Total length (TL) haplochromine, 24. 5 - 27 cm TL Mormyrus kannume and 9 - 24 cm TL Clarias species. <b>The</b> <b>bait</b> <b>types</b> had a significant effect on the catch rate and also on the size composition the fish harvested measured as Total length (ANCOVA F= 8. 231; P 0. 05). Hook sizes used by the fishers had a significant effect on the both the size (TL) composition (ANCOVA F= 3. 847; P< 0. 05) and the mean weight (ANCOVA F= 4. 599; P< 0. 005) of the Nile perch captured. Investigations indicated hook sizes seven (7) and eight (8) were the ones that harvested the Nile perch above the slot size of 50 cm total length. In general hook sizes indicated to be the main drive in the harvesting of the Nile perch though <b>bait</b> <b>type</b> also contributed toward that. Generally there is need for management to put a law in place on the minimum hook size to be used on the harvesting of the Nile perch and also monitored by the Fisheries Management as a regulatory measure. In addition to that aquaculture should be encouraged to farm <b>the</b> fish for <b>bait</b> at a higher scale in the region in order to avoid depleting the wild stocks already in danger of extinction.

40|$|ABSTRACT This {{study was}} the first to {{evaluate}} the efficiency of trapping methods in the study of small mammals in the Carajás National Forest, southeastern Brazilian Amazon. It is an area with a unique vegetation type (metalofilic savannah or Canga). The aims of this study were to compare the efficiency of two trapping methods (i. e. live-traps and pitfalls), <b>the</b> <b>bait</b> <b>types</b> used, and evaluate if trapping success varied seasonally. We used four sampling grids, each with six parallel transects. The trap effort for live-traps and pitfalls was 51, 840 trap*nights and 10, 800 bucket*nights, respectively. We used three types of bait: a paste of peanut butter and sardines, bacon, and bananas. We placed one <b>type</b> of <b>bait</b> in each trap, alternating between points. We recorded 26 species of small mammals, 11 from the order Didelphimorphia and 15 from the order Rodentia. Pitfalls captured a higher number of species compared with live-traps. The capture rate, the mortality rate and the quantity of juveniles and adults did not differ significantly between methods. Capture rate for pitfalls differed significantly between seasons. The majority of species were captured by a single method. Species were equally attracted to the traps regardless of <b>the</b> <b>type</b> of <b>bait</b> used. Some of our results differed significantly from other studies in Amazonia and such variation should be taken into account when designing survey methods for Amazonian small mammals...|$|R
40|$|Due {{to their}} {{widespread}} and specious nature, small mammals {{are ideal for}} biogeographical studies. Small mammals also effectively connect various trophic levels by being both consumers and prey items for other animals. The Great Escarpment is the dominant mountain landscape in South Africa. Yet, very little small mammal {{research has been conducted}} on the Great Escarpment outside of the Main Drakensberg Mountains. This is surprising given the importance of mountains in shaping regional ecology. In this study, I assessed the diversity and community composition of small mammals at three high altitude (> 1700 m) sites within the Sneeuberg Mountain Complex (SMC) from June 2009 to May 2010. I also tested the effectiveness of five different <b>bait</b> <b>types</b> for measuring small mammal diversity (i. e. number of individuals caught, species richness, Shannon diversity index and Simpson index of diversity). Out of a total of 423 captures, 292 individuals of 12 small mammal species (one shrew, one elephant shrew and 10 rodents) were recorded over 5280 trap nights. The species richness and diversity of small mammals captured at the three sites were similar and this homogeneity was probably related to the regional processes (e. g. climate and latitude) that govern species richness and diversity. <b>The</b> most effective <b>bait</b> <b>type</b> in terms of capture success, species richness and diversity measurements was peanut butter and oats. In addition, the use of richness estimators revealed that peanut butter and oats was <b>the</b> most effective <b>bait</b> for sampling <b>the</b> species richness of small mammals. The effectiveness of peanut butter and oats was related to this bait having a more attractive scent, when compared to <b>the</b> other <b>bait</b> <b>types.</b> Future studies should focus on researching the range of local and regional processes that drive small mammal diversity at high altitudes in South Africa. I also recommend the use of more than one <b>bait</b> <b>type</b> when planning to survey small mammal communities. ...|$|R

40|$|Baited remote {{underwater}} video stations (BRUVS) {{are increasingly}} being used to examine assemblages of fishes, yet critical methodological questions related to sampling limitations and bias, such as <b>the</b> influence of <b>bait</b> <b>type,</b> remain poorly understood. At multiple locations, we examined the hypothesis that diversity and abundance in temperate reef fish assemblages were independent of <b>bait</b> <b>type.</b> We used 3 <b>bait</b> <b>types</b> (abalone viscera, pilchards and crushed urchin) and quantified commonly used metrics for the fish assemblage, including species richness, time of first arrival and relative abundance on 3 shallow rocky reefs in southeastern Australia over 2 yr. We distinguished the following 6 feeding guilds: herbivore, zooplanktivore, alga/invertebrate consumers, invertebrate carnivore, macroinvertebrate carnivore and generalist carnivore. The response of fishes was dependent on <b>bait</b> <b>type,</b> with urchin <b>bait</b> performing particularly poorly. Although we did not detect statistical differences between the performance of pilchards and abalone viscera as bait, pilchards produced more consistent outcomes.

40|$|Baited remote {{underwater}} stereo-video systems (stereo-BRUVs) {{were developed}} to determine fish abundance and size structure in a more unbiased, and relatively non-invasive manner across {{a broader range of}} depths and habitats than conventional sampling methods achieve. These characteristics make stereo-BRUVs particularly useful for research inside marine protected areas (MPAs) where researchers are required to minimize disturbance to the protected environment. Although stereo-BRUVs have been widely used around the world, they are novel to South Africa and standardised protocols for their application are required. As such, this study aimed to address i) the effect of different <b>bait</b> <b>types,</b> namely pilchard (Sardinops sagax), squid (Loligo reynaudi) and bivalves (Crassostrea gigas and Perna perna) on the observed reef fish assemblage structure and ii) the effect of artificial illumination (lighting) on the observed reef fish assemblage structure sampled with stereo-BRUVs. One key component of the stereo-BRUVs methodology is <b>the</b> application of <b>bait</b> to attract fish into the field of view. Globally, pilchard is the most often used <b>bait</b> <b>type</b> for stereo- BRUVs, however, its suitability has never been tested comparatively against other <b>bait</b> <b>types</b> for South African conditions. Significant differences in fish abundance and assemblage structure were recorded between stereo-BRUVs deployments when applying <b>the</b> different <b>bait</b> <b>types.</b> <b>The</b> bivalve <b>baits,</b> oyster and mussel, were typically poor when sampling the reef fish assemblages of the region. Pilchard and squid were sampled in similar communities and were able to attract the majority of the reef fish from the region, suggesting they are suitable <b>bait</b> <b>types</b> for stereo-BRUVs in the Agulhas ecoregion. However, a power analysis indicated that roughly twice the amount of samples are required to effectively sample the same abundances of Chrysoblephus laticeps (roman) and Cheilodactylidae (fingerfins) species when sampling with squid as opposed to pilchard. Both <b>bait</b> <b>types</b> can be locally sourced, however, squid is considerably more expensive than pilchard. Considering the difference in cost, together with the fact that twice as much squid bait is required, squid is not a cost-effective option relative to pilchard. As such this study recommends that pilchard is <b>the</b> most appropriate <b>bait</b> for <b>the</b> Agulhas ecoregion of South Africa. Due to low light levels, artificial lighting is required when conducting remote video research in the sub-photic zone. Blue light has a shorter wavelength than other colour lights and attenuates slower through water. In addition, blue lighting has no recorded effect on fish behaviour and {{has proven to be a}} successful light colour for underwater sampling. The use of lighting is unavoidable for sub-photic stereo-BRUVs sampling and is recommended for all stereo-BRUVs sampling for comparability of data from environments characterised by different light levels. A study was conducted to test the necessity of artificial lighting when sampling from environments characterised by ambient light levels adequate for stereo- BRUVs sampling, a comparative to measure the effect of light on the fish assemblage structure. Of the more commonly detected fish species (those observed in > 50 % of the samples), most were seen at similar abundances in samples using lighting and in those without lighting. No significant differences were observed in fish length data between samples collected with and samples collected without lighting. This suggests that standardised stereo-BRUVs sampling across photic zones on the continental shelf of South Africa can be collected without blue lighting when ambient light levels are sufficient to see the survey area...|$|R
40|$|The U. S. East Coast pelagic {{longline}} fishery {{has a history}} of interactions with marine mammals, where animals are hooked and entangled in longline gear. Pilot whales (Globicephala spp.) and Risso’s dolphin (Grampus griseus) are the primary species that interact with longline gear. Logistic regression was used to assess the environmental and gear characteristics that influence interaction rates. Pilot whale inter-actions were correlated with warm water temperatures, proximity to the shelf break, mainline lengths greater than 20 nautical miles, and damage to swordfish catch. Similarly, Risso’s dolphin interactions were correlated with geographic location, proximity the shelf break, the length of <b>the</b> mainline, and <b>bait</b> <b>type.</b> <b>The</b> incidental bycatch of marine mammals is likely associated with depredation of the commercial catch and is increased by the overlap between marine mammal and target species habitats.

40|$|The primary aim of {{this thesis}} {{was to assess the}} {{palatability}} to North Island brown kiwi (Apteryx australis mantelli) of a range of non-toxic baits and flavours used to lure <b>baits.</b> During <b>the</b> wild <b>bait</b> trials incubation patterns of nesting male kiwi, chick behaviour and the presence of predators at the nesting burrow were recorded. A new 'improved' ground laid 1080 paste was also tested on a range of non-target bird species. All ten captive kiwi fed at least once on at least one <b>bait</b> <b>type</b> (i. e. carrot, No. 7, RS 5, apple pulp, and paste) but did not prefer any to their usual artificial diet. Wild kiwi did not feed on any <b>bait</b> <b>type</b> placed outside <b>the</b> nest entrance, but may have ingested apple pulp, or paste when they probed these baits. Results indicate that cereal-based <b>baits</b> are <b>the</b> safest <b>bait</b> <b>type</b> to sow aerially in kiwi habitat, while apple pulp baits are highly acceptable to kiwi. Cinnamon, aniseed, orange and clove flavours did not significantly attract or deter captive kiwi from feeding on portions of their usual diet. Insufficient flavoured cereal No. 7 baits were eaten to determine whether any bait and flavour combination affected kiwi response to these baits. No wild kiwi fed on any cinnamon or orange flavoured No. 7 cereal <b>baits</b> placed outside <b>the</b> nesting burrow, but kiwi did probe these baits. Incubating male kiwi left the nest once each night, except for two kiwi which sometimes left the nest twice in a night. One of these sometimes made three trips from the nest in a night. The active period of kiwi {{did not appear to be}} influenced by the number of times they emerged in a night. Male kiwi tended to spend less time away from the nest when chicks were due to hatch, following which they increased the time spent away. Possums, rats and mice regularly visited kiwi nests, but did not deter males from incubating, or harm kiwi eggs or chicks. Five species - robin, saddleback, blackbird, pukeko and weka, fed on a non-toxic cinnamon-lured form of 1080 paste. Species other than those mentioned rarely landed on the ground and therefore encountered paste infrequently. Captive weka found the paste highly palatable, while 24 % of robins and possibly half of a pukeko family fed on the paste. All bird visits to <b>the</b> paste <b>baits</b> declined after <b>the</b> first day of exposure. Recommendations are made on the safe laying of paste baits in areas where robin, saddleback, weka or pukeko are present...|$|R

40|$|Poison {{operations}} are a widely used technique for rodent {{control in the}} indigenous forests of New Zealand. This study examined the bait-take and rat monitoring data obtained for continuous poison operations at Boundary Stream Mainland Island (BSMI), Hawke’s Bay, between 1996 and 2007. Since {{the beginning of the}} Mainland Island project at BSMI in 1996, 800 ha of indigenous forest have been treated with an ‘Integrated Pest Management’ approach, in which rodents (primarily ship rats) have been targeted by consecutive ground poison operations. The aim of the intensive pest control was to allow the ecosystem to recover and provide a safe environment for threatened native bird species to recover or be re-introduced. Another important aim of this pest control is to provide experience and expert knowledge in management techniques especially applicable to the protection of indigenous habitat on the New Zealand mainland. This research study had two main aims: to identify spatial patterns of the rodent population at BSMI and to determine the efficacy of the different rodenticides applied for their control. The distribution of the rodent population was investigated by spatial analysis of bait-take across the reserve and through time. Visualisation of high and low bait-take areas revealed that there was a noticeable reinvasion from adjacent unmanaged native forests, but not markedly from exotic forest or pasture. Reinvasion from small and isolated adjacent forests ceased to be noticeable consistently after approximately four years of the poison operation, while a large scenic native reserve, as well as a narrow part of the treatment area surrounded by many native bush patches, were continuously affected by reinvasion through the entire project time. Bait-take was visibly higher after <b>the</b> <b>bait</b> had either been removed, or left in the field unserviced, over winter. No consistent areas of no bait-take were identified. Further statistical analysis of bait-take data revealed that bait-take was higher in bait stations within 150 m of the treatment edge than interior bait stations. Bait-take in broadleaf/tawa/podocarp forest was significantly higher than in kamahi/kanuka/rewarewa, beech and cloud-cap forest. The second aim {{of the study was to}} determine the efficacy of <b>the</b> various <b>bait</b> <b>types</b> with different active ingredients used during the operation. Rat monitoring data, namely rat tracking indices (RTI) obtained from tracking tunnels, were statistically modelled using Generalised Linear Models. Diphacinone cereal pellets (Pestoff® 50 D, 0. 05 g/kg diphacinone) obtained the lowest RTI, followed by pindone cereal pellets (Pindone Pellets®, 0. 5 g/kg pindone), brodifacoum cereal pellets (Pestoff® 20 p and Talon®, 0. 02 g/kg brodifacoum), coumatetralyl paste (Racumin®, 0. 375 g/kg) and diphacinone bait blocks (Ditrac®, 0. 05 g/kg). Cereal pellet baits worked better than any other <b>bait</b> <b>type</b> used at this location. Season had no statistically significant effect on either RTI or bait-take estimates. The overall goal of the poison operation to decrease rat numbers, and to maintain low levels, has been met. However, the results of this study suggest that baiting needs to be done continuously and over the entire treatment area. Edge bait stations – particularly next to adjacent native forests – should be prioritised to target reinvading rodents. Poisons presented in cereal pellet baits should be preferred to other <b>bait</b> <b>types.</b> Both pindone and brodifacoum showed very good results, as well as diphacinone in cereal pellet baits...|$|R

A tamper-resistant bait station with a wax block which is manufactured to fit within it so that it cannot be shaken out is considered the safest way to present <b>the</b> <b>bait.</b> However, some authors have expressed concern about the efficacy of this method. Research to examine <b>the</b> effects of <b>bait</b> stations on <b>the</b> feeding of mice infesting domestic dwellings was undertaken in the city of Manchester, UK. Working in conjunction with Manchester City Council, suitable sites were found. A balanced Latin Square experimental design was employed to overcome any operational biases that could have occurred. Non-toxic baits were presented in one of four ways: whole wheat in a cardboard box; whole wheat in a open tray; whole wheat in a tamper-resistant box; and a non-toxic wax block in a tamper-resistant box. Baits were placed in four different locations within dwellings and during the feeding trial; <b>the</b> <b>bait</b> stations were rotated, so that each <b>bait</b> <b>type</b> was presented in each location. <b>The</b> <b>bait</b> take from 12 dwellings within 3 housing blocks was recorded. Three-quarters of <b>the</b> <b>bait</b> consumed during <b>the</b> trial was taken from the cardboard box. No bait was taken from the tamper-resistant box containing the wax block. Risk assessments should drive the approach adopted in presenting rodenticide. Dwellings where vulnerable adults/children/pets are present may represent a risk of accidental poisoning may require a regime with tamper-resistant bait boxes containing wax blocks, to prevent baits being accessed. However, a balance between the safest and the most effective presentation of bait is needed and in areas where there is unlikely to be any access to baits (e. g. behind kitchen kickboards), use of alternatives must remain to ensure the shift resolution of infestations. Where bait can be placed safely and there are no children or pets present, cardboard boxes provide an effective means of ensuring that bait is consumed by the mice infesting domestic dwellings...|$|R
40|$|The {{spread of}} rabies in {{terrestrial}} wildlife throughout the United States is primarily controlled through oral rabies vaccination. Relatively low bait acceptance and seroconversion rates by some target species have prompted investigation into {{an alternative to}} <b>the</b> RABORAL V-RG <b>bait</b> currently used. In Canada, ONRAB Ultralite baits are used to vaccinate raccoons (Procyon lotor) and striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis). Comparative studies between RABORAL V-RG and ONRAB found higher seroconversion rates among raccoons that ingested ONRAB, suggesting {{that it may be}} a suitable alternative. However, ONRAB has not been evaluated in many rabies reservoir species, including coyotes (Canis latrans). Vaccination of coyotes is a critical element in preventing reemergence of canine strain of rabies in the United States. We evaluated flavor preference of ONRAB Ultralite oral rabies vaccine baits by coyotes. Preferences among <b>bait</b> <b>types</b> differed (Friedman c 2 ¼ 13. 28; df ¼ 5; P ¼ 0. 02). Of <b>the</b> 6 <b>bait</b> flavors evaluated, cheese ranked the highest, followed by fish, chicken, sugar-vanilla, egg, and bacon flavors. Pairwise trials among the top 3 flavors (cheese, fish, and chicken) showed no difference (Friedman c 2 ¼ 3. 00; df ¼ 2; P ¼ 0. 22).

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{quantify}} the risk to free-ranging, native birds from four new <b>types</b> of <b>bait,</b> which will be used with micro-encapsulated zinc phosphide (Zn₃P₂) for the control of possum. Six poisons are currently registered for possum control in New Zealand, with sodium monofluoroacetate (1080) being the most extensively used. This toxin {{can be incorporated into}} various <b>bait</b> <b>types</b> and {{has been shown to be}} an extremely cost-effective method of initially removing > 90 % of a possum population (Eason et al. 1994). However, due to ongoing public opposition to use of 1080 (Eason 1995), the Animal Health Board has funded extensive research to identify cost-effective alternatives for controlling possum. Opposition to 1080 is a manifestation of the perceived risk to human health, the risk of secondary poisoning for dogs (Meenken and Booth 1997), the incidental poisoning of feral deer (Fraser and Knightsbridge 1995), and the risk of primary poisoning for native birds (Spurr 1994). This study's objectives are {{to quantify the}} risk to native bird species from new cereal, paste, polymer and gel possum bait by: • calculating the palatability of each new <b>bait</b> <b>type</b> compared with an existing possum bait (cereal No. 7 bait); • measuring the mean consumption of each new <b>bait</b> <b>type</b> compared with an existing possum bait (cereal No. 7 bait); and • observing and recording the behaviour of native birds for each new <b>bait</b> <b>type</b> compared with an existing possum bait (cereal No. 7 bait) ...|$|R

40|$|Olfactory {{predators and}} {{scavengers}} rely on odors to locate food, and they forage primarily at night. We hypothesized that weather (e. g. wind speed, humidity, and temperature), vegetation, and landscape features affect the dissipation of odors {{in the atmosphere}} and, thus, impact the foraging efficiency of olfactory predators. We tested this hypothesis by assessing what conditions were correlated with <b>the</b> persistence of <b>bait</b> along <b>the</b> dike surrounding Willard Bay Reservoir, Utah. We distributed 124 chicken eggs and 199 dead European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) as bait over 21 separate occasions spanning from May 21, 2009, to August 18, 2009. We used timers to record the time of consumption and cameras to identify which species ate <b>the</b> <b>bait.</b> Sixty-six eggs and 87 dead European starlings were consumed. <b>The</b> <b>bait</b> was consumed mostly at night (83 %) and by striped skunks (Mephitis mephitis), raccoons (Procyon lotor), and red foxes (Vulpes vulpes). We used nest survival models in program MARK to determine which covariates influenced bait persistence. We tested nine variables and found that bait persistence was influenced by section of the dike, time since study initiation, temperature, humidity, and wind speed but not <b>bait</b> <b>type</b> (egg or dead European starling), terrain, or visual cover. How quickly scavengers were able to locate food, which was inversely related to rates of bait persistence, decreased with higher temperatures and wind speeds and increased with higher humidity.

40|$|Three {{types of}} {{long-life}} stoat bait (polymer, paste, and gel) were formulated from natural and synthetic bait ingredients after extensive testing of potential ingredients. Feeding trials demonstrated that baits containing natural extracts from rabbit and chicken were preferred to bait that contained only processed meals and synthetic flavours. The addition of preservatives and waterproofing agents to improve bait longevity, lowered palatability markedly in all <b>bait</b> <b>types.</b> <b>The</b> texture of <b>bait</b> also affected <b>the</b> amount of <b>bait</b> eaten, with most stoats rejecting baits that were hard or {{needed to be}} chewed before they could be swallowed.

Acute toxicity to cats of warfarin, cholecalciferol, and gliftor was tested. However, because the cat proved highly sensitive to 1080, we recommend its use at a dose of 2 mg per cat bait.

40|$|Abstract. —We {{examined}} <b>the</b> {{relationship between}} <b>bait</b> and lure size and type and body size, injury, and handling time for northern pike Esox lucius, an important recreational fisheries resource {{in much of}} North America and Europe. <b>Bait</b> <b>type</b> and size {{were significantly related to}} the size of fish captured and hooking location. Hooking in critical locations (i. e., gills, gullet) was more likely to occur with natural bait, soft plastic shads and jigs, and spoons than with spinners and wobblers (i. e., plugs). Small baits (, 75 mm) were more likely to hook the fish in the gills and less likely to hook the fish in the upper jaw than larger baits. It took longer to remove hooks from gills than from other hooking locations. Frequency of bleeding was related to depth of hooking but was unrelated to fish size, <b>bait</b> <b>type,</b> <b>bait</b> size, or fishing method. Initial mortality of northern pike was low (mean 6 95 % confidence interval 2. 4 6 1. 5 %), and hooking mortality was significantly related to the level of bleeding as a proxy for severity of injury. Results {{of this study suggest that}} using large artificial lures and large natural baits can effectively reduce the incidence of hooking small northern pike (i. e., those that are sublegal in some jurisdictions). However, the use of natural bait can also result in a higher incidence of deep hooking, which in turn increases the likelihood of injury and bleeding...|$|R
40|$|Food {{availability}} is {{an important}} factor influencing the lives of ant colonies. Wood ants consume protein-rich and sugary foods. Protein-rich food is comprised primarily of insects, a considerable proportion of which the ants acquire by direct predation. They therefore play an important function in biological protection of forests. The objective of our study was to determine if workers activity is dependent on habitat type, size of <b>the</b> nest, <b>bait</b> size and food type (sugar, protein). We selected 23 nests in a spruce forest and placed food baits of various sizes and types near each nest. The results obtained show that the number of individuals on <b>the</b> <b>baits</b> was substantially higher in clearings than within mature forest. The number of worker ants recorded on <b>the</b> <b>baits</b> was slightly higher for larger nests. <b>Bait</b> size and <b>type</b> had no influence on the number of workers present. Because wood ants do not focus solely on food of a certain size or quality, they can effectively decrease the abundance of forest pests...|$|R
40|$|European rabbits in Australia have a {{significant}} impact on the environment and the economy. It is therefore necessary to implement control programs. In rural areas a number of methods including warren ripping and poisoning are frequently used. In urban areas though, rabbit control is not as easily accomplished because the use of many control methods is not appropriate. For example, the poison 1080 often cannot be used due to public health concerns and warren ripping cannot be used in conservation areas. Poisoning with pindone, an anticoagulant, is therefore one of few options available to the managers of urban reserves. However, the use of pindone is not without risks to wildlife and domestic animals. This study was conducted in Bold Park, Perth, Western Australia, as tt was recognised that rabbits have a tremendous impact on the bushland. The study investigated <b>the</b> use of <b>bait</b> stations during a bailing program and was designed to: assess <b>the</b> <b>bait</b> uptake from two different bait station designs; identify animals visiting <b>the</b> <b>bait</b> stations; and determine whether these animals showed a preference for one of <b>the</b> <b>bait</b> station designs. Prior to the field trials, oat seed viability studies were carried out to ensure that the oat seeds used as bait would not germinate in the field. To identify animals visiting <b>the</b> <b>bait</b> stations (through tracks and scats), bait stations were placed onto existing sand plots. The study showed that rabbits accepted bait stations and fed from both <b>bait</b> station <b>types.</b> Although they preferred the slab design the difference in visitation was not significant. Bird visitation to the drum design was significantly lower than to the slab design and rodents visited the drum more often than the slab design. From these results it was concluded that bait stations similar to the drum design should be used whenever bird poisoning is a concern. When small native mammals are present in the area, additional precautions should be taken to protect these animals from being poisoned. Also discussed are potential problems associated with <b>the</b> use of <b>bait</b> stations...|$|R
