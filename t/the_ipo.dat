5|$|Ahead of {{the opening}} of <b>the</b> <b>IPO,</b> {{concerns}} were raised among both investors and Manchester United supporters regarding {{the details of the}} share offering. Although the share prospectus specified that the proceeds from the sale would go towards paying down the club's debts, it was revealed that much of the money would go directly to the Glazers. Furthermore, holders of class A shares would not be entitled to a regular dividend, and the structure of the share issue meant that the Glazers' class B shares had 10 times the voting power of class A shares, essentially denying a controlling interest in the club to anyone but the Glazers. These issues drove down interest and forced a drop in the share price from the planned $16–20 each to $14 each, representing a potential total sale value of $233million (£150million).|$|E
5|$|In 2007, KKR {{filed with}} the Securities and Exchange Commission to raise $1.25 billion by selling an {{ownership}} interest in its management company. The filing came {{less than two weeks}} after the initial public offering of rival private equity firm Blackstone Group. KKR had previously listed its KPE vehicle in 2006, but for the first time, KKR would offer investors an ownership interest in the management company itself. The onset of the credit crunch and the shutdown of <b>the</b> <b>IPO</b> market dampened the prospects of obtaining a valuation attractive to KKR. The flotation was repeatedly postponed, and called off by the end of August.|$|E
5|$|In August 2011, the Glazers were {{believed}} to have approached Credit Suisse {{in preparation for a}} $1billion (approx. £600million) initial public offering (IPO) on the Singapore stock exchange that would value the club at more than £2billion. However, in July 2012, the club announced plans to list its IPO on the New York Stock Exchange instead. Shares were originally set to go on sale for between $16 and $20 each, but the price was cut to $14 by the launch of <b>the</b> <b>IPO</b> on 10 August, following negative comments from Wall Street analysts and Facebook's disappointing stock market debut in May. Even after the cut, Manchester United was valued at $2.3billion, making it the most valuable football club in the world.|$|E
40|$|The {{efficient}} markets {{theory suggests}} that {{it is not possible to}} consistently achieve abnormal return on the capital market. In practice, however, there are a variety of market anomalies which undermine this claim. These include among others: IPOs underpricing phenomenon and IPOs medium and long-run underperformance phenomenon. In the first part of the article the most important theories and models explaining the cause of these anomalies from different research perspectives are discussed. The second part presents the methodology of the research. The next two parts of the article contain the results of studies on the occurrence of these anomalies on the Warsaw Stock Exchange. The following results were obtained: - the occurrence of the phenomenon of systematic IPOs underpricing; - no occurrence of <b>the</b> phenomenon of <b>IPOs</b> medium-run underperformance; - no occurrence of IPOs medium-run underperformance of <b>the</b> <b>IPOs</b> underpricing and <b>the</b> <b>IPOs</b> medium-run overperformance of <b>the</b> <b>IPOs</b> overpricing; - <b>the</b> occurrence of <b>the</b> phenomenon of <b>IPOs</b> long-run underperformance; - <b>the</b> occurrence of <b>IPOs</b> long-run underperformance of <b>the</b> <b>IPOs</b> underpricing and no ocurrence of IPOs long-run overperformance of <b>the</b> <b>IPOs</b> overpricing. ...|$|R

Although the Fortress' domain included both hedge funds and private-equity investments, Novogratz and his fellow Princetonian Briger ran the hedge funds. Although the stock price had risen to $35 at its IPO, by December 3, 2008, it dipped to as low as $1.87 after withdrawals from Novogratz' Drawbridge Global Macro fund were shut off.|$|E
5|$|On 15 October 2015, {{following}} years {{of criticism from}} the fans over {{the design of the}} 1997 badge, the club announced they intended to carry out a fan consultation on whether to disregard the club badge and institute a new design. After the consultation, the club announced in late November 2015 the current club badge would be replaced in due course by a new version which would be designed {{in the style of the}} older, circular variants. A design purporting to be the new badge was unintentionally leaked two days early prior to the official unveiling on 26 December 2015 by <b>the</b> <b>IPO</b> when the design was trademarked on 22 December. The new design was officially unveiled at the club's home match on 26 December against Sunderland.|$|E
5|$|The shares debuted on the NYSE on 10 August 2012, and {{initially}} showed a slight rise to $14.05 per share, but closed the day {{back at the}} offer price of $14 each, valuing the club as a whole at $2.3billion, and {{making it one of}} the most valuable sports teams in the world. One of the biggest investors in <b>the</b> <b>IPO</b> was American billionaire George Soros, whose investment company purchased about 3.1million class A shares (1.9% of the club), valued at $40.7million (£25.8million) at the time. Club records announced in November 2012 revealed that gross debt had fallen to £359.7million after the share sale paid off £62.6million of bonds. The club's debts were further remedied in May 2013, after a new loan deal was agreed that would save the club £10million a year in interest payments on debts now totalling around £307million.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} additional international {{evidence on}} <b>the</b> <b>IPOs</b> by examining <b>the</b> initial performance and two main determinants of short-run underpricing of 169 <b>IPOs</b> listed on <b>the</b> Athens Stock Exchange (ASE) {{over the period}} 1997 - 2002. The initial performance of <b>the</b> <b>IPOs</b> is measured by calculated two formulas: the raw returns and the excess or adjusted returns of the first, fifth and twenty first day respectively. Furthermore, we use a proxy to rank the underwriters’ prestige along with the times of oversubscription, which are introduced as explanatory variables in our model. The results of the analysis provide evidence of significant underpricing. Furthermore, the cross sectional analysis on the determinants of <b>the</b> <b>IPOs</b> shows that both the underwriters’ prestige and the times of oversubscription significantly affect the underpricing level of <b>the</b> <b>IPOs</b> over <b>the</b> most important and “hot” period for the Greek emerging stock market since its establishment, in terms of growth rates, acceleration of the going public process and volatility of market and stock returns.

5|$|On February 16, {{the company}} {{announced}} it had filed its registration for <b>the</b> <b>IPO</b> with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Burger King began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol BKC on May 18, 2006. The stock sale generated $425million in revenue, the largest IPO of a US-based restaurant chain on record. The proceeds from the sale were used by the company help pay back a loan taken out taken by the company in February used to pay dividends to the investment firms. According to one analyst at Renaissance Capital, Wall Street investors were not alarmed by the large payout due to the increased financial stability of the company resulting from changes made by the investor groups during the interim between the purchase in 2002 and the stock offering. Incoming CEO John W. Chidsey backed the payouts, stating that the financial firms spent considerable time and capital turning the company around.|$|E

25|$|When {{a company}} lists its {{securities}} {{on a public}} exchange, the money paid by the investing public for then newly issued shares goes directly to the company (primary offering) {{as well as to}} any early private investors who opt to sell all or a portion of their holdings (secondary offerings) as part of the larger IPO. An IPO, therefore, allows a company to tap into a wide pool of potential investors to provide itself with capital for future growth, repayment of debt, or working capital. A company selling common shares is never required to repay the capital to its public investors. Those investors must endure the unpredictable nature of the open market to price and trade their shares. After <b>the</b> <b>IPO,</b> when shares trade freely in the open market, money passes between public investors. For early private investors who choose to sell shares as part of <b>the</b> <b>IPO</b> process, <b>the</b> <b>IPO</b> represents an opportunity to monetize their investment. After <b>the</b> <b>IPO,</b> once shares trade in the open market, investors holding large blocks of shares can either sell those shares piecemeal in the open market, or sell a large block of shares directly to the public, at a fixed price, through a secondary market offering. This type of offering is not dilutive, since no new shares are being created.|$|E

40|$|Using data on IPOs {{that are}} issued in Japan during January 1975 –March 1989, {{we examine the}} {{deliberate}} underpricing and overreaction hypotheses to explain high initial returns at offering dates. Specifically, we analyze the cross-sectional pattern of the short- and long-run performance of <b>IPOs.</b> <b>The</b> obtained {{results indicate that the}} deliberate underpricing theories which we examine are unable to explain the high initial returns on <b>the</b> Japanese <b>IPOs.</b> Furthermore, for <b>the</b> average of <b>the</b> <b>IPOs,</b> <b>the</b> empirical results are not consistent with the overreaction hypothesis. However, there is evidence consistent with the hypothesis that for a certain minority group of <b>IPOs,</b> <b>the</b> high initial returns occur due to overreactions by investors. We interpret the overall results as indicating that the high initial returns on <b>the</b> Japanese <b>IPOs</b> can be attributed to a mixture of both underpricing and investor overreaction. We conjecture that the binding regulations in Japan led to underpricing.
