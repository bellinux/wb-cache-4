25|$|Nevertheless, we {{are forced}} to testify that Bourguiba's Tunisia could no more be called secular than Ben Ali's or the rest of the Arab Muslim states, for more than a {{neutrality}} of orientation and the religious freedom of the state, secularism implies the autonomy of public and religious institutions. <b>The</b> <b>reality</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> institutional presence of Islam in Tunisia, although strictly circumscribed, is truly a constant reference, implicit or explicit, legitimizing the regime's direction. Certainly, Tunisian public services are accessible to all without distinction of creed and the constitution guarantees religious freedom, so long as it does not threaten public order, but Islam remains the state religion, {{to the extent that it}} is said it is obligatory for the president of the republic to be able to assert it.|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{the fourth}} season, Lost {{continued}} to slip in the ratings. [...] The season premiered with 16 million American viewers, giving Lost its highest ratings in 17 episodes; however, {{the size of}} the audience steadily decreased throughout the season. The eighth episode, which served as the mid-season finale {{as a result of the}} writers' strike, brought in 11 million, setting a new series low. [...] The next episode and midseason premiere climbed slightly to 12 million, but the episode after that set the current record for lowest-rated episode in the United States with 11 million people watching. The finale was seen by 12 million, reaching the most viewers since the midseason premiere and making it Lost lowest-rated finale yet. [...] Despite the decline in viewers, Lost consistently ranked within the top 20 programs of the week with one exception. [...] The finale topped the chart, due to its broadcast being over a week after the official end of the television season. Entertainment president Stephen McPherson commented that while he would [...] "love to see the show grow … <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> numbers are pretty good." ...|$|E

50|$|Despite the {{terminology}} used {{which makes it}} appear as though a shareholder's limited liability emanates from the view that a corporation is a separate legal entity, <b>the</b> <b>reality</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> entity status of corporations has almost {{nothing to do with}} shareholder limited liability.

50|$|Other people, Internet, media, many researchers, and {{practitioners}} {{in this area}} also argue that a more-informed public would be more supportive of scientific inquiry and of emerging technologies, such as nanotechnology or agricultural technology.
