To this end, Powell addressed a plenary session of the United Nations Security Council on February 5, 2003, to argue in favor of military action. Citing numerous anonymous Iraqi defectors, Powell asserted that [...] "there {{can be no doubt}} <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>has</b> biological weapons and the capability to rapidly produce more, many more." [...] Powell also stated that there was [...] "no doubt in my mind" [...] that Saddam was working to obtain key components to produce nuclear weapons.|$|E

5000|$|As {{he leaves}} the building, he passes a {{newspaper}} stand where the headlines declare the official end of the Cold War. Four weeks later, whilst fishing outside his retirement cottage, he hears over the radio <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>has</b> invaded Kuwait.

5000|$|In the book, CIA {{director}} George Tenet {{is noted}} as stating the evidence <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> {{weapons of mass}} destruction was [...] "a slam dunk". Later, Tenet is forced to admit that his intelligence was flawed when months of post-war searches turned up nothing.|$|R
50|$|Aznar: It is very {{important}} to have a resolution. It is not the same to act with it as without it. It would be very advisable to have a majority in the Security Council that supported that resolution. In fact, {{it is important to have}} it passed by a majority, even if someone exercises a veto. Let us consider that the text of the resolution would have among other things to state <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>has</b> lost his opportunity.|$|E
5000|$|The {{transcript}} {{begins with}} Bush saying {{he wants to}} pursue a second resolution quickly, {{two or three days}} after the meeting. Aznar prefers three days later so the General Affairs and External Relations Council can meet beforehand. Bush envisions a resolution similar to one passed during the Kosovo conflict, and [...] "he wants it written so that it does not contain obligatory elements, that does not mention the use of force, and that states <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>has</b> been unable to fulfill his obligations." ...|$|E
5000|$|Bush: It {{could be}} in the evening Monday, {{considering}} the time difference. In any case, the next week. We will see that the resolution is written so that it does not contain obligatory steps Iraq, that it does not mention the use of force, and that it states <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>has</b> been unable to fulfill his obligations. That type of resolution can be voted for by many people. It would be something similar to the one passed regarding Kosovo 10th of June 1999.Aznar: Would it be presented to the Security Council before, and independently of, a parallel declaration? ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{few days}} before the U.S. Senate vote on the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution, about 75 {{senators}} are told in closed session <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>has</b> the means of delivering biological and chemical weapons of mass destruction by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) drones that could be launched from ships off the Atlantic coast to attack U.S. eastern seaboard cities. Colin Powell suggested in his presentation to the United Nations that UAVs were transported out of Iraq and could be launched against the U.S. In fact, Iraq had no fleet of UAVs nor any capability of putting UAVs on ships. [...] Iraq's UAV fleet consisted of less than a handful of outdated Czech training drones. At the time, there was a vigorous dispute within the intelligence community as to whether CIA had conclusions about Iraqi UAVs were accurate. The U.S. Air Force agency most familiar with UAVs denied outright that Iraq possessed any offensive UAV capability.|$|E
5000|$|Like {{many in the}} {{neoconservative}} movement, Perle {{had long}} been an advocate of regime change in Iraq. In 1998 Perle led an effort known as the Project for the New American Century with close neoconservative allies Wolfowitz, Woolsey, Elliott Abrams, and John Bolton. The Project culminated in a letter sent to US President Bill Clinton calling for the military overthrow of Saddam Hussein's regime. Prior to and after the 2003 invasion of Iraq, Perle held several exclusive meetings in his home where he discussed issues regarding American foreign policy on Iraq. In {{an effort to help}} fund their goals, Ahmed Chalabi an Iraqi-born businessman and founder of the Iraqi National Congress, helped Perle secure millions of dollars from the U.S. government in 1990. Chalabi was one of the key figures driving the war in Iraq and helped transmit important “information” to U.S congress and the public that would successfully help sell the war effort. Moreover, Perle and Chalabi also had very similar motives: they both wanted the Hussein regime deposed and Chalabi to be elected as president. In 2004, the FBI investigated Chalabi after U.S. intelligence sources revealed that he was working as a double agent for Iran. [...] Perle was also involved in efforts to develop alternative intelligence estimates to help justify the {{decision to go to war}} in Iraq. He and other neoconservative leaders claimed that the intelligence community had grossly underestimated threats to the national security of the U.S. Thus, they established two secret offices in the Pentagon after September 11 - the Counter Terrorism Evaluation Group and the Office of Special Plans. Nonetheless, Perle helped manage and hire neoconservative affiliated staff for both these organizations that created their own policies and intelligence reports by dodging existing government entities. [...] Perle’s reasoning for implementing the Office of Special Plans was essentially to “bring in people with fresh eyes to review the intelligence that the CIA and other agencies had collected.” In an interview with CNN on September 16, 2001 Perle announced [...] "Even if we cannot prove to the standards that we enjoy in our own civil society that they were involved, we do know, for example, <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>has</b> ties to Osama Bin Laden..." [...] Flynt Leverett, a senior staff member of the Bush National Security Council states: “There were constant efforts to pressure the intelligence community to provide assessments that would support their views. If they couldn’t get what they wanted out of the intelligence community, they simply created their own intelligence.” Moreover, Perle allegedly gave several speeches and talks throughout Europe trying to promote the war effort abroad. He allegedly told the British House of Commons that the U.S would attack Iraq even if UN weapons inspectors didn’t find anything. Lawrence Wilkerson, former chief of staff to Secretary of State Colin Powell announced that Perle was “making remarks as if he were an official inside the U.S government.” In countries like Germany, France, Britain, and Japan, people perceived him as a government authority whose knowledge and clout on U.S policy appeared legitimate.|$|E

2500|$|Cole {{rejects the}} Bush administrations early claims of Iraqi {{cooperation}} with Al-Qaeda, noting <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> [...] "persecuted and killed both Sunni and Shiite fundamentalists in great number", {{as well as}} claims {{to the effect that}} Iraq was developing weapons of mass destruction. Rather than making America safer, he says, the war has ironically had the opposite effect: inspiring anti-U.S. militants.|$|R
5000|$|Scott Shane of The New York Times said [...] "perhaps {{if we had}} {{had more}} {{information}} on these secret internal deliberations of governments prior to the invasion of Iraq in 2003, {{we would have had}} {{a better understanding of the}} quality of the evidence <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> weapons of mass destruction.

2500|$|Following the U.S. {{invasion}} of Iraq in 2003, American forces captured {{a number of}} documents detailing conversations <b>that</b> <b>Saddam</b> <b>Hussein</b> <b>had</b> with his inner sanctum.

5000|$|The UN itself {{never had}} the chance to declare that Iraq had failed to take its [...] "final opportunity" [...] to comply as the U.S. {{invasion}} made it a moot point.

As the deadline approached, the United States announced that forces would be sent to verify his disarmament and a transition to a new government.|$|R
2500|$|ElBaradei {{described}} the U.S. invasion of Iraq as [...] "a glaring example of how, in many cases, {{the use of}} force exacerbates the problem rather than [...] it."

40|$|Two recent {{failures}} of the United States intelligence system {{have led to the}} creation of high-level investigative commissions.

5000|$|British {{journalist}} Robert Fisk, {{a critic}} of Western policies in the Middle East, argues that recent Western conflicts against the Middle East, {{after the end of}} the Cold War, have been part of a new perpetual war.
