5|$|Crossing {{points in}} the defence network– bridges, tunnels and other weak spots– were called nodes or points of resistance. These were {{fortified}} with removable road blocks, barbed wire entanglements, and land mines. These passive defences were overlooked by <b>trench</b> <b>works,</b> gun and mortar emplacements, and pillboxes. In places entire villages were fortified using barriers of scaffolding, sandbagged positions and loopholes in existing buildings.|$|E
5|$|Securing an {{airstrip}} {{would be}} an important objective for the invader. Airfields, considered extremely vulnerable, were protected by <b>trench</b> <b>works</b> and pillboxes which faced inwards towards the runway, rather than outwards. Many of these fortifications were specified by the Air Ministry and defensive designs were unique to airfields—these would {{not be expected to}} face heavy weapons so the degree of protection was less and there was more emphasis on all-round visibility and sweeping fields of fire. It was difficult to defend large open areas without creating impediments to the movement of friendly aircraft. Solutions to this problem included the pop-up Picket Hamilton fort—a light pillbox that could be lowered to ground level when the airfield was in use.|$|E
25|$|To {{enable the}} digging of the <b>trench</b> <b>works</b> {{required}} for the CRL, the Downtown Shopping Centre was closed on 28 May 2016 and by 23 November had been demolished. It will be replaced with a 36-storey skyscraper which will include a new shopping centre in the lower levels. Auckland Council and proprietors Precinct Properties struck a deal to include tunnels for the City Rail Link directly underneath the premises.|$|E

40|$|<b>Trenching</b> <b>works</b> on road {{pavement}} is essential with most utility cables being underground. However, such works {{often leads to}} road deterioration due {{to a number of}} reasons. <b>Trenching</b> <b>works</b> on {{road pavement}} usually occurs in the road shoulder to minimize disturbance to traffic. This project aims to investigate the impact of such <b>trenching</b> <b>works</b> on urban road operation and maintenance work. Information regarding the impact of trenching, current standards and Codes of Practice, factors leading to the deterioration of roads after trenching and current methods used by local councils are researched. A number of sites around the Klang valley are then investigated and compared with the current standards available. The advantages and disadvantages of both methods are identified and the best possible methods are then determined. From the investigation, it can be concluded that both the standards employed by the local city council and the usual practice of the contractor have their own advantages. The standards and guidelines provided by the local city councils are found to be more effective whereas the usual practice of the sub-contractor is found to be more economical. Therefore, there should be a closer liaison between the road authority and utility department's personnel with the contractor...|$|R

25|$|Other buses {{depart from}} stops on {{surrounding}} streets, {{some of which}} are up to a block away from the station. The lack of more integrated bus facilities {{has been the subject of}} criticism, particularly due to the fact that the original design for the transport centre included an underground bus station, which was cut from the final design due to costs and the bus operators' preference for above-ground bus facilities. Until early 2016, buses arrived at and departed from Queen Street in front of the station building, but that portion of Queen Street is currently closed to vehicular traffic while <b>trench</b> <b>works</b> for the City Rail Link take place.|$|E

50|$|In {{the parish}} of Nether Wallop, {{northeast}} {{of the town of}} the same name, there is a fortress on the hill of Danebury dated to the Iron Age where a multitude of excavations have taken place between 1968 and 1988. There is no evidence of its occupation during the Roman period, but there is ample evidence of its fortification in Sub-Roman Britain. The perimeter of the defensive works has been lost to the years, but the <b>trench</b> <b>work</b> is still discernible, archaeologists having found ceramics from the 5th and 6th centuries. This allows the fortifications to be dated contemporarily to the battle between Vitalinus and Ambrosius.|$|R

50|$|The {{inscription}} on this stone consists of tightly bound columns of text within bands that end in snake heads, {{and may be}} indicative {{of the influence of}} earlier Danish inscriptions on decorated runestones in Sweden. This granite runestone, which is 2.07 meters in height, is classified as being carved in runestone style Fp, which is the classifiecation for inscriptions with bands that end in animal heads. It was raised in memory of a two men who died in Denmark. The runic text says that they were the ablest men in Sweden.

A defensive line had been started that was 5 - 7 km in depth, consisting of minefields, interconnected <b>trench</b> <b>works,</b> and strong points.

40|$|This {{research}} investigated how {{machine operator}} expertise, strategies, and decision-making {{can be integrated}} into operator models that simulate authentic human behavior in construction machine operations. Physical prototype tests of construction machines require significant time and cost. However, computer-based simulation is often limited by the fidelity in which human operators are modeled. A greater understanding of how highly skilled operators obtain high machine performance and productivity can inform machine development and advance construction automation technology. Operator interviews were conducted to build a framework of tasks, strategies, and cues commonly used while controlling an excavator through repeating work cycles. A closed loop simulation demonstrated that an operator model could simulate the <b>trenching</b> <b>work</b> cycle with multiple operator strategies, and adapt to different vehicle and work site settings. A Virtual Operator Model that captures human expert behaviors {{can be used to}} assess vehicle characteristics and efficiency, and inform the design of automation systems...|$|R
