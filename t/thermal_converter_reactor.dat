40|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>converters</b> are {{the most}} {{accurate}} standards for the transfer of alternating voltage and current to the equivalent dc quantities. Today, thin-film multijunction <b>thermal</b> <b>converters</b> {{are used in the}} frequency range from 10 Hz up to 1 MHz with measurement uncertainties below 10 "-" 6 in the audio-frequency range. For frequencies below 100 Hz, it is known that the ac-dc transfer differences of thin-film multijunction <b>thermal</b> <b>converters</b> as well as of all other types of <b>thermal</b> <b>converters</b> increase; their origin is believed to be in the temperature oscillation in the converter {{due to the lack of}} integration of the oscillating Joule heat at decreasing frequencies. To explore the low-frequency behaviour of <b>thermal</b> <b>converters,</b> the electric-to-thermal conversion in the heater, the heat transport mechanisms in the thin films and the thermal-to-electric conversion in the thermocouples of the thin-film or planar multijunction <b>thermal</b> <b>converter</b> (PMJTC) have been analysed. The dynamic nonlinear electro-thermal differential problem was solved using the finite element method. The knowledge of the temperature distribution with ac and dc input voltages allows the ac-dc transfer difference #delta#_L_F at low frequencies to be calculated. The temperature dependence of the heater resistance, of the heat transport mechanisms, i. e. radiation and conduction through layer materials and through the air, and of the Seebeck effect was included in the nonlinear model. The accuracy of the model was tested comparing the results of the simulation with those of measurements. Parameters in the simulation were adjusted by the measurement of the sensitivity and the thermal time constant of the manufactured PMJTC. A digital method was used as a reference for the measurements. The uncertainty of this measurement method was investigated.

40|$|<b>Thermal</b> <b>converters</b> are {{the most}} {{accurate}} devices used by National Metrology Institutes for the transfer of ac voltage and current to equivalent dc quantities. Today, thin-film or planar multijunction <b>thermal</b> <b>converters</b> are employed in the frequency range from 10 Hz up to 1 MHz with uncertainties between 1 #mu#V/V to 13 #mu#V/V. For frequencies above 100 kHz the ac-dc transfer difference of the standard thin-film or planar multijunction <b>thermal</b> <b>converter</b> (PMJTC) developed at the PTB and fabricated on a silicon chip show an increase towards negative values for high heater resistances. A model that explains the behaviour of the thin-film converter on a silicon chip at high frequencies was developed. This model shows that an improvement in performance in this frequency range is possible by the change of the geometry of the bonding pads of the heater. To improve the standards for the measurement of the ac-dc transfer difference {{in the range from}} 100 kHz up to 100 MHz, a new thin-film multijunction <b>thermal</b> <b>converter</b> on a quartz membrane and a quartz chip has been developed. The window with the membrane for the converter was anisotropically etched into the quartz crystal chip and the structure of the bifilar heater and the thermocouples was fabricated using standard photolithographic procedures. The converters fabricated show ac-dc transfer differences below 5 #mu#V/V in the frequency range from 100 kHz to 1 MHz. This is a reduction of more than one order of magnitude of the ac-dc voltage transfer difference in comparison to the PMJTC with an Si_ 3 N_ 4 /SiO_ 2 /Si_ 3 N_ 4 sandwich membrane on a silicon chip. An electrical model taking all sources of ac-dc transfer differences at high frequencies into account was developed. A comparison of the results of simulations with those of measurements for converters with different heater resistances show good agreement. Therefore, the model can be used for the optimisation of the converter at high frequencies. The uncertainty of this model was calculated. A further improvement of the frequency response of the new <b>thermal</b> <b>converter</b> in the range of 10 MHz to 100 MHz has been achieved. By using a built-in Tee structure the ac-dc transfer difference in the range from 10 MHz to 100 MHz decrease by a factor of 10. The decrease of the ac-dc difference allows to decrease the uncertainty of the PTB ac-dc transfer standards, using the developed model for the uncertainty analysis. (orig.)

40|$|In view of {{the fact}} that the world's {{high-grade}} natural uranium resources are limited, alternative ways of using these resources more efficiently are of interest in the line of research undertaken by IIASA's Energy Systems Program. Sole reliance on the currently predominant Light Water Reactors (LWRs) would mean to deplete these natural uranium resources rapidly. The present paper considers different strategies of uranium use involving, in addition to burners (LWRs), Fast Breeder Reactors (FBRs) and Advanced <b>Converter</b> <b>Reactors</b> (ACR) with an extremely high efficiency in using natural uranium. Breeder reactors in fact require only depleted natural uranium (left over from enriched LWR fuel), once a certain endowment of fissile plutonium (from burnt LWR fuel) has accumulated.

Although the efficiency in using natural uranium is less in advanced <b>converter</b> <b>reactors,</b> their uranium savings are enormous compared to the amounts used up in burners.

40|$|Under present {{technological}} and economic conditions, minimum fuel costs in thermal reactors {{are associated with}} systems having conversion ratios less than unity; however, when recycle of bred fuel becomes inexpensive (associated with rapid and inexpensive fuel fabrication, movement and processing), minimum fuel costs appear to occur with reactors having relatively high breeding ratios. Although the thorium cycle permits a higher breeding ratio than the uranium cycle, the fertile material and reactor concept which gives minimum fuel costs under present conditions is not clearly defined. This {{is due in part}} to inadequate information on the variation of eta with energy for the various fuels, particularly the eta values of Pu$^{ 239 }$ and Pu$^{ 241 }$, and to uncertainties in economic factors. Development of an "advanced" technology which permited inexpensive recycle of bred fuel would decrease the fuel cost in <b>converter</b> <b>reactors</b> as well as in breeders, and increase the conversion or breeding ratio of minimum-fuel-cost systems.
