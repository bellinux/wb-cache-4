5|$|HBC {{control of}} Rupert's Land ended in 1868; when Manitoba became a {{province}} in 1870, all land became {{the property of}} the federal government, with homesteads granted to settlers for farming.

5|$|The main {{method of}} Candides satire is to {{contrast}} ironically great tragedy and comedy. The story does not invent or exaggerate evils of the world—it displays real ones starkly, allowing Voltaire <b>to</b> <b>simplify</b> subtle philosophies and cultural traditions, highlighting their flaws.

5|$|At least 41 systems {{measure the}} severity, or grade, of a mild head injury, {{and there is}} little {{agreement}} about which is best. In an effort <b>to</b> <b>simplify,</b> the 2nd International Conference on Concussion in Sport, meeting in Prague in 2004, decided that these systems should be abandoned in favor of a 'simple' or 'complex' classification. However, the 2008 meeting in Zurich abandoned the simple versus complex terminology, although the participants did agree to keep the concept that most (80–90%) concussions resolve in a short period (7–10 days), and although the recovery time frame may be longer in children and adolescents.|$|E
5|$|Early {{difficulties}} with staff conditions and wages, {{which the company}} was attempting <b>to</b> <b>simplify</b> from the complex contracts arranged by LCBS, led to strike action by staff in February 1988. Performance levels on contracted routes were already below those expected by the local councils who had awarded LCNE the contracts, and by London Regional Transport. Following the strike three of the company's London contracts (routes 292, 298 and 313) were terminated and awarded to independents.|$|E

Passenger service commenced in November 1977, but after the 1978 crash the aircraft was taken out of service.

5|$|The Analytical Review {{was meant}} to {{enlighten}} the public as well as <b>to</b> <b>simplify</b> communication between authors separated by great distances; most importantly, the debates between those authors could be read by the public. In granting authors a public forum in which to communicate, periodicals such as the Analytical helped to define authorship—they encouraged the professionalization of writing and granted prestige to writers and journalists.|$|E

5|$|The University of Chicago's 1960–61 Group Theory Year brought {{together}} group theorists such as Daniel Gorenstein, John G.

This project exceeded previous mathematical endeavours by its sheer size, in both length of proof and number of researchers. Research is ongoing <b>to</b> <b>simplify</b> the proof of this classification. These days, group theory is still a highly active mathematical branch, impacting many other fields.|$|E
