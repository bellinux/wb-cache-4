500|$|The hearing {{took six}} days, {{finishing}} on 18 February 2008, with the judgment being made public on 17 March 2008. Mills was eventually awarded {{a lump sum}} of £16.5m, together with assets of £7.8m, which included the properties she owned at the time. The total was £24.3million (nearly $50 million in US currency,) plus payments of £35,000 per annum, for a nanny and school costs for their daughter. In his judgment, Justice Bennett [...] stated: [...] "The husband's evidence was, in my judgment, balanced. He expressed himself moderately though at times with justifiable irritation, if not anger. He was consistent, accurate and honest. But I regret <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> I cannot say the same about the wife's evidence. Having watched and listened to her give evidence, having studied the documents, and having given in her favour every allowance for the enormous strain {{she must have been}} under (and in conducting her own case) I am driven to the conclusion that much of her evidence, both written and oral, was not just inconsistent and inaccurate but also less than candid. Overall, she was a less than impressive witness." [...] Regarding her career, the judge said: [...] "I find that, far from the husband dictating to and restricting the wife's career and charitable activities, he did the exact opposite. He encouraged it and lent his support, name and reputation to her business and charitable activities. The facts as I find them do not in any way support her claim." [...] In anger at the judgment, Mills threw a pitcher of water on the head of Fiona Shackleton, McCartney's solicitor, in the courtroom.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his speech}} to the House of Commons on the Inquiry, British Prime Minister David Cameron stated: [...] "These are {{shocking}} conclusions to read and shocking words <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> But you do not defend the British Army by defending the indefensible." [...] He acknowledged that all those who died were unarmed when they were killed by British soldiers, and that a British soldier had fired the first shot at civilians. He also {{said that this was}} not a premeditated action, though [...] "there was no point in trying to soften or equivocate" [...] as [...] "what happened should never, ever have happened". Cameron then apologised on behalf of the British Government by saying he was [...] "deeply sorry".|$|E
2500|$|Miers {{met with}} the Senate Judiciary Committee after her {{nomination}} and in those meetings she was ill-prepared and uninformed on the law. Senator Tom Coburn told her privately that she [...] "flunked" [...] and [...] " [...] going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> something next time." [...] Miers had difficulty expressing her views and explaining basic constitutional law concepts. Miers had no experience in constitutional law {{and did not have}} extensive litigation experience; at her Texas law firm, she had been more of a manager. In addition, Miers had rarely handled appeals and did not understand the complicated constitutional questions senators asked of her. To White House lawyers, Miers was [...] "less an attorney than a law firm manager and bar association president." ...|$|E

"The Plum Line" [...] {{editorial}} in The Washington Post commented: [...] "The Tucson speech may {{go down as}} one of the most important of Barack Obama's presidency, so it's worth nailing down its most important accomplishment: He finally got conservatives to listen <b>to</b> what he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> - about them.|$|R
2500|$|In 1998, Tony Blair {{announced}} a new judicial inquiry, the Bloody Sunday Inquiry, into the killing of 14 unarmed civil rights marchers in Derry in 1972. A previous investigation, the Widgery Tribunal, into the same event had been discredited. During {{the debate in the}} House of Commons, Trimble was one of few dissenting voices. He said [...] "I am sorry <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> to the Prime Minister that I think that the hope expressed by the hon. Member for Foyle (Mr. Hume) that this {{will be part of the}} healing process is likely to be misplaced. Opening old wounds like this is likely to do more harm than good. The basic facts of the situation are known and not open to dispute." [...] Reporting in 2010, The Saville Inquiry confirmed that all of the 14 killings and 13 woundings were unjustified.|$|E

50|$|Commentators {{have also}} noted that the {{campaign}} was flawed {{to the extent that it}} shows Cameron in a positive light. It has been said that Conservative MPs like the Chameleon tag, as it encourages the idea that Cameron does not stick steadfastly to bad policies, and that he thus listens <b>to</b> what people <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b>|$|R
30|$|To Idealists like Green, {{citizenship}} {{implies a}} noble purpose. Citizenship is active and orientated to community life. Citizenship endorses {{the unity of}} the conscience of man and the public laws, of reason and authority, and of spirit and the flesh. The concept of citizenship has a remoteness, and somewhat lofty ring to it, even in the 1900 s. It presupposed an extensive educational background and awareness, which is in itself a severe drawbackae. It is clear that any theory of constructive citizenship is going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> something <b>to</b> <b>say</b> about educationaf.|$|R

25|$|Her {{original}} {{power was}} nothing more than was due to earnestness and intellectual clearness within a certain range. With small imaginative and suggestive powers, and therefore nothing approaching to genius, she could see clearly what she did see, and give a clear expression <b>to</b> what she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> In short, she could popularize while she could neither discover nor invent.|$|R
2500|$|Burns {{attributed}} {{all of the}} couple's {{early success}} to Allen, modestly ignoring his own brilliance as a straight man. He summed up their act in a classic quip: [...] "All I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do was <b>say,</b> 'Gracie, how's your brother?' and she talked for 38 years. And sometimes I didn't even <b>have</b> <b>to</b> remember <b>to</b> <b>say</b> 'Gracie, how's your brother?' ...|$|R

2500|$|In 2002, Manson {{appeared}} in Michael Moore's documentary, Bowling for Columbine; his appearance was filmed during the band's first show in Denver since the shooting.

2500|$|Historian Carol Polsgrove {{explored}} why Wright appeared <b>to</b> <b>have</b> little <b>to</b> <b>say</b> {{about the}} increasing activism {{of the civil}} rights movement during the 1950s in the United States. She found that Wright was under what his friend Chester Himes called [...] "extraordinary pressure" [...] to avoid writing about the US. As Ebony magazine delayed publishing his essay, [...] "I Choose Exile," [...] Wright finally suggested publishing it in a white periodical. He believed that [...] "a white periodical would be less vulnerable to accusations of disloyalty." [...] He thought the Atlantic Monthly was interested, but in the end, the piece went unpublished.|$|R
25|$|The poem {{allows the}} reader to {{experience}} this, her dying wish, in a very personal and powerful way as she entreats us to come in close and listen <b>to</b> what she <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> like a loved one and a confidence. Yet the reader is {{struck by the fact}} that even as we read her final request, we know it goes un-honored. This has a further social implication on the silencing of marginalized cultures and, additionally, women.|$|R

30|$|Without {{access to}} ICTs, {{women and girls}} lose the {{opportunity}} of having their voices heard especially on online platforms, as ICT promotes personal development and makes women feel safer and empowered.

2500|$|Marilyn Manson {{was blamed}} {{by the media}} {{in the wake of}} the Columbine shooting, and responded to {{criticism}} in an interview with Michael Moore, in which he was asked, [...] "If you were to talk directly to the kids at Columbine and the people in the community, what would you <b>say</b> <b>to</b> them if they were here right now?", to which he replied, [...] "I wouldn't say a single word to them—I would listen <b>to</b> what they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> and that's what no one did." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Russian {{newspaper}} Amurskii Krai {{criticized the}} killing of innocent civilians, charging that [...] "restraint" [...] "civilization" [...] and [...] "culture" [...] instead of [...] "racial hatred" [...] and [...] "destruction" [...] {{would have been more}} becoming of a [...] "civilized Christian nation". The paper asked [...] "What shall we tell civilized people? We shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> them: 'Do not consider us as brothers anymore. We are mean and terrible people; we have killed those who hid at our place, who sought our protection'".|$|R
