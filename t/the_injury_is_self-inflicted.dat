40|$|Child {{protection}} paediatricians {{have a role}} as forensic {{experts in}} the context of suspicious childhood injury. The task of forensic evaluation of suspicious injury is to reach a conclusion to support legal proceedings. For each injury, one of four conclusions should be reached: 1 The injury has been caused by another person and is considered to have been inflicted. 2 The injury is adequately explained by the circumstances of the injury event provided (by the carer or other witnesses). 3 <b>The</b> <b>injury</b> <b>is</b> <b>self-inflicted</b> – has been caused by the child’s own behaviour as a result of normal childhood activity (with no other person actively involved). 4 The mechanism or sequence of events leading to the injury remains indeterminate or unclear. An additional consideration is determining the extent to which an injury incident was foreseeable and therefore preventable, to form an opinion on whether lack of care (neglect) is involved. Opinions reflect a body of knowledge in forensic and medical literature of known mechanisms of injury including biomechanical aspects of tissue injury in trauma scenarios. Limitations in using research documenting injury type and prevalence at different developmental stages is discussed and in particular, the application of such research to support a conclusion that the injury must have been inflicted. Emerging recognition of research documenting injuries that overlap with those found in populations of children thought to have been physically assaulted creates some doubt on previous opinions regarding exclusivity of certain findings in children definitively indicating ‘abuse’. Forensic paediatricians should remain objective, limit their opinions to what can be confidently stated and exercise caution where reasonable doubt exists and avoid speculation.

50|$|The {{perpetrators}} {{and victims}} of accidental and negligent gun discharges {{may be of}} any age. Over 120 children 15 years old or younger were killed in gun accidents in 1998. Accidental <b>injuries</b> <b>are</b> most common in homes where guns are kept for self-defense. <b>The</b> <b>injuries</b> <b>are</b> <b>self-inflicted</b> in half of the cases.On January 16, 2013, President Obama issued 23 Executive Orders on Gun Safety, {{one of which was}} for the Center for Disease Control (CDC) to research causes and possible prevention of gun violence. The five main areas of focus were gun violence, risk factors, prevention/intervention, gun safety and how media and violent video games influence the public. They also researched the area of accidental firearm deaths. According to this study not only have the number of accidental firearm deaths been on the decline over the past century but they now account for less than 1% of all unintentional deaths, half of which <b>are</b> <b>self-inflicted.</b>|$|R
50|$|We sent {{a request}} for {{information}} to the Prosecutor’s General office {{to learn about the}} status of criminal proceedings # 42012220090000028-27-012 of December 12, 2012 under article 365 p. 2, mentioned by the convict V.Bordun in relation to the torture he was subjected to. He became the victim of torture for his refusal to report on other inmates. The ECHR decision in the case “Savenko vs. Ukraine” makes reference to a similar case. The administration of Temnivka CF #100 was trying to persuade S.Savenko to report any illegal activity of the other inmates. He refused. When the officials ran short of arguments, they resorted to torture. As a result, Savenko lost conscience and suffered a number of bodily <b>injuries</b> registered by <b>the</b> medical expert. Savenko’s attempts to complain of the administration’s actions brought no response. He was forced to say that <b>the</b> <b>injuries</b> <b>were</b> <b>self-inflicted.</b> But later, in court, he confessed that he had been forced to refute his own testimony and also showed the conclusion written by the expert with 37 years of professional experience to the effect that Savenko was by no means capable of inflicting <b>the</b> <b>injuries</b> himself.|$|R

500|$|The doctors alerted Brent {{police and}} social services, {{and she was}} placed under police {{protection}}, with a 72-hour protection order preventing her from leaving hospital. Kouao told the doctors that she had scabies, and that <b>the</b> <b>injuries</b> <b>were</b> <b>self-inflicted.</b> Many doctors and nurses suspected that <b>the</b> <b>injuries</b> <b>were</b> non-accidental. However, Ruby Schwartz, the consultant paediatrician and named child protection doctor at the hospital, diagnosed scabies and {{decided that it was}} scratching that caused <b>the</b> <b>injuries.</b> She made <b>the</b> diagnosis without speaking to Climbié alone. Schwartz later admitted that she made a mistake. Another doctor, one of Schwartz' juniors, misleadingly wrote to social services saying there was no child protection issue. When Michelle Hine, a child protection officer at Brent council, received a report notifying her of Climbié's injuries, she planned to open an investigation into the case. However, the next day she heard of Schwartz' diagnosis and downgraded Climbié's level of care, trusting Schwartz' judgement. She later expressed regret over her actions. Schwartz said in the inquiry that she expected social services to follow up the case. Neil Garnham QC, counsel to the inquiry following Climbié's death, later said to her, [...] "there is a terrible danger here—is there not, doctor—of social services {{on the one hand and}} you on the other each expecting the other to do the investigation, with the result that nobody does". The police officer allocated to Climbié's case for the Brent Child Protection team, Rachel Dewar, decided to lift the police protection, allowing Climbié to return home, when told by a social worker that she had scabies. Under the Children Act 1989, Dewar was obliged to see Climbié and tell her she was under police protection, but she did not do this. She also failed to see Kouao or Manning. At the time of the decision, Dewar was attending a seminar on child protection. Garnham later said, [...] "we will need to ask why it was thought more important for her to attend a seminar to learn how to deal with child protection cases than deal with the real child protection case for which she was responsible at the time". Kouao took Climbié home on 15 July 1999.|$|R

40|$|Several new and {{important}} objec-tives are introduced when the medico-legal post-mortem {{examination of the}} victim of a gunshot <b>injury</b> <b>is</b> under-taken. In ordinary practice an autopsy is performed to secure information of medical or scientific interest. In medico-legal practice it is performed primarily to determine, for legal purposes, the cause of death. Although both of these objectives are important, many medical examiners and investigating officers are unfamiliar with certain potentially rich sources of information which are ex-tremely useful in the investigation of the crime. To determine the cause of death is, of course, fundamental. But to determine, insofar as possible, the circumstances surrounding the fatal acts is often more useful in the admin-istration of justice. Among others, an-swers to the following questions should be sought. Was the wound produced by a bullet? Could <b>the</b> <b>injury</b> have <b>been</b> <b>self-inflicted?</b> From what direc-tion was the shot fired? How far was the gun from the victim when the shot was fired? What kind of ammunition was used? What kind of firearm was used? The answer to these and other ques-tions may depend entirely upon the ex-amination of the body and clothing of the victim. With the legal status of evidence of this kind already estab-lished in the higher courts (27), it...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the severity of}} nonfatal injuries to children caused by air guns and pellet guns. DESIGN: Case series (hospital chart review). SETTING: Inpatient wards of the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario. PATIENTS: All children under 18 years of age {{admitted to the hospital}} from Jan. 1, 1979, to Dec. 31, 1989, under ICD code E 917, E 922, E 955, E 965, E 970 or E 985 who had suffered air gun injuries. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Personal data, circumstances of event and clinical data. RESULTS: The 43 children (37 boys) had a median age of 12 years. The circumstances of the accident were known in 20 cases: 17 children were playing and 3 were cleaning the gun when it went off. Four children thought the gun was unloaded. In five cases the bullet ricocheted into <b>the</b> eye. Nine <b>injuries</b> <b>were</b> <b>self-inflicted.</b> <b>Injury</b> <b>was</b> to <b>the</b> extremities in 21 (49 %), the eyes in 15 (35 %) and the head and neck in 7 (16 %). The median length of hospital stay was 4 days. Six children had long-term disabilities, all the result of eye injuries; two had cataract surgery, and four required enucleation of the eye. CONCLUSIONS: Air guns can cause serious injury to children. Their sale needs to be banned or at least carefully regulated...|$|R
40|$|Traumatic {{cyclodialysis}} {{has been}} reported by several authors {{during the last decade}} (Sedan, I 966; Turut, Constantinides, and Asseman, I 971). Romem and Singer (1973) described a case of traumatic aniridia without prolapse of iris through an external wound. Trobe and Keeney (1974) reported three cases of traumatic aniridia all of which were accompanied by perforating wounds involving the cornea. This is a report of a case of traumatic cyclo-dialysis with extrusion of most of the iris through a scleral perforation. Case report A 25 -year-old White female agricultural worker was admitted to the ophthalmic department of the Barzilai Medical Centre, Ashkelon, after an injury to her left eye caused by a screwdriver (Figure). <b>The</b> <b>injury</b> had <b>been</b> accidentally <b>self-inflicted</b> two hours earlier as she had been trying to repair a tubing of metal in the cow-shed. The visual acuity in the right eye was 6 / 6, and examination of that eye including the fundus revealed nothing abnormal. The visual acuity in the left eye was hand movements with good perception of light. The upper lid was swollen with ecchymoses and abrasions of the skin. There was conjunctival injection. On the medial side about 4 mm from the limbus, a brown oval mass could be seen under the abraded conjunctiva. The cornea was clear and did not show any signs of per-foration. The anterior chamber was filled with blood and it was impossible to see any further details. The eye was hypotonic, tension by Schiotz tonometry was 5 - 5 /I 6. It was decided to proceed with exploration of <b>the</b> ocular <b>injury</b> under general anaesthesia. An operation was performed on the day of admission. On exposure of the sclera medially, a mass of soft brown tissue was seen within the scleral wound which extended along a course roughly parallel to the limbus from 7. 0 o'clock 3 mm from the limbus to io. o o'clock 9 mm from the limbus. It was necessary to separate the medial rectus from its insertion to obtain adequate exposure of the scleral wound. The brown mass was identified as prolapsed iris and it was excised level with the sclera. After the excision the intact ciliary body was seen in th...|$|R

50|$|Self-harm (SH), also {{referred}} to as self-injury (SI), self-inflicted violence (SIV), nonsuicidal self injury (NSSI) or self-injurious behaviour (SIB), refers to a spectrum of behaviours where demonstrable <b>injury</b> <b>is</b> <b>self-inflicted.</b> <b>The</b> behaviour involves deliberate tissue damage that is usually performed without suicidal intent. The most common form of self-harm involves cutting of the skin using a sharp object, e. g. a knife or razor blade. The term self-mutilation is also sometimes used, although this phrase evokes connotations that some find worrisome, inaccurate, or offensive. <b>Self-inflicted</b> wounds <b>is</b> a specific term associated with soldiers to describe non-lethal injuries inflicted in order to obtain early dismissal from combat.
