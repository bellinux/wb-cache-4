50|$|According to Schütz, we can avoid, {{compensate}} for, {{or ignore}} the probe effect. In critical real-time system, in which timeliness (i.e., {{the ability of}} a system to meet time constraints such as deadlines) is significant, avoidance is the only option. If we, for example, instrument a system for testing and then remove the instrumentation before delivery, this invalidates the results of most <b>testing</b> based <b>on</b> the <b>complete</b> <b>system.</b> In less critical real-time system (e.g., media-based systems), compensation can be acceptable for, for example, performance testing. In non-concurrent systems, ignorance is acceptable, since the behavior with respect to the order of execution is left unchanged.|$|R

40|$|This report {{focuses on}} the results of the {{acceptance}} test of the Topographical Mapping System (TMS) delivered to the Hanford site. The TMS was tested for accuracy over the specified range of 45 feet. The TMS was also tested to ensure that the unit could be deployed through multiple risers and maintain accuracy and registration of the surface mapping data. In addition, the TMS was disassembled and reassembled and redeployed to test field replacement of modules that make up the sensor head that is deployed in the vapor space of Underground Storage Tanks such as those located at the Hanford site in southeastern Washington State. The results from these tests along with temperature <b>testing</b> <b>on</b> the <b>complete</b> <b>system</b> and radiation testing of selected susceptible components are covered in this report. The primary purpose of the TMS is to generate reliable and accurate three-dimensional maps of the internal surfaces of storage tank. One use for these mapping systems is in creating and maintaining a current map of the tank interior as input to a robotic ``world model`` that is used to test remediation strategies or plan robot trajectories. Another use is tracking the movement of the waste surface as it responds to expanding bubbles of trapped Gas. A third use of the TMS is to perform a volumetric analysis of the amount of waste removed from the tanks during remediation...|$|R

This project designs a music search engine where a user can find a song by playing the tune on a keyboard or humming a tune into a microphone. First and foremost, we implemented an effective algorithm [1] to convert polyphonic music into an identifiable monophonic tune. Audio processing hardware was then used to extract the pitch of the input. Finally, a fast and effective search algorithm was implemented to provide the user with accurate results.

40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Electronical Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2007. The {{convergence}} {{of the cell}} phone industry and the Internet brings with it a myriad of services, to be accessed when on the move. It also brings {{a need for a}} paradigm shift in its billing mechanism. The current billing operation does not cater for different services on the same channel with different ratings. It also often makes it impossible to bill in real time. These two limitations may cause revenue loss for cell phone operators, especially since the South African market focuses on prepaid users requesting services that may range from as little as 5 c to R 10 or R 20 per service. Additional functionality is needed to eliminate discouraging, non-configurable error messages generated by the network when services are down, or when real-time hilling systems refuse delivery of a service due to insufficient funds on the user's account. Motivated by these restrictions, it seemed not only sensible but very important to assess the state of the industry and available technologies, in order to define a new content billing architecture. Specifications and requirements for such a solution were researched and formulated, in order to complete the design and implementation. The choice for a cell phone Internet technology to support the new system fell on the Wireless Internet Gateway (WIG), as it caters to 99 % of the South African market by delivering text-based Internet content to 2 G cell phones. The content-based billing application (CBA) was developed and tested in the laboratory to verify its functionality and performance. It implements all the specifications and requirements. The CBA was then installed on the network of a South African cell phone operator. End-to- end performance <b>tests</b> <b>on</b> the <b>complete</b> <b>system,</b> including its latency and throughput levels, confirmed that it successfully implemented all requirements and business logic.

40|$|In this project, the {{combining}} of {{photovoltaic cells}} and supercapacitors into a single, photocapacitor system, was studied. A <b>complete</b> photocapacitor <b>system</b> of commercial components was put together, and characterized. The components were first characterized on their own, {{and then as}} a part of the <b>complete</b> <b>system.</b> Some of characterization techniques normally used for individual components was observed to break down during <b>testing</b> <b>on</b> the <b>complete</b> photocapacitor <b>system,</b> giving inconclusive measurements. The mechanisms for charging and discharging of such a system was surmised, and compared to the experimental data. The comparison between the proposed model and the data showed a strong relation for the current and voltage responses during charging and discharging. The efficiency of the photovoltaic cell was determined, and through the charging curve, the efficiency in energy storage for the photocapacitor system. This efficiency was found to be 44. 3 % for the electricity-to-stored-energy conversion. A variety of electrochemical photovoltaic and supercapacitor electrodes were fabricated, and combined to form two-electrode photocapacitor devices. These devices were then characterized using the same methods as was used for the commercial components system. From the testing, a conflicting functionality requirement between the energy generating and energy storing parts of the system was observed. This proved to strongly limit the performance of the devices. The effects of shunt and series resistances of the <b>complete</b> photocapacitor <b>system</b> were also investigated, and related to the quality of the individual components in the fabricated devices...|$|R
40|$|Final {{results are}} {{presented}} from a program to develop a thin film static strain gage for use on the blades and vanes of running, test stand gas turbine engines with goals of an 3 x 3 mm gage area and total errors of less than 10 pct. of + or - 2, 000 microstrain after 50 hrs at 1250 K. Pd containing 13 Wt. pct. Cr was previously identified as a new strain sensor alloy {{that appeared to be}} potentially usable to 1250 K. Subsequently, it was discovered, in contrast with its behavior in bulk, that Pd- 13 Cr suffered from oxidation attack when prepared as a 4. 5 micron thick thin film. Continuing problems with electrical leakage to the substrate and the inability of sputtered alumina overcoats to prevent oxidation led to the discovery that sputtered alumina contains appreciable amounts of entrapped argon. After the argon has been exsolved by heating to elevated temperatures, the alumina films undergo a linear shrinkage of about 2 pct. resulting in formation of cracks. These problems can be largely overcome by sputtering the alumina with the substrate heated to 870 K. With 2 micron thick hot sputtered alumina insulation and overcoat films, total 50 hr drifts of about 100 microstrain (2 tests) and about 500 microstrain (1 test) were observed at 1000 and 1100 K, respectively. Results of <b>tests</b> <b>on</b> <b>complete</b> strain gage <b>systems</b> <b>on</b> constant moment bend bars with Pd temperature compensation grids revealed that oxidation of the Pd grid was a major problem even when the grid was overcoated with a hot or cold sputtered alumina overcoat...|$|R

40|$|Circular {{splicing}} {{systems are}} a formal {{model of a}} generative mechanism of circular words, inspired by a recombinant behaviour of circular DNA. Some unanswered questions {{are related to the}} computational power of such systems, and finding a characterization of the class of circular languages generated by circular splicing systems is still an open problem. In this paper we solve this problem for <b>complete</b> <b>systems,</b> which are special finite circular splicing systems. We show that a circular language L is generated by a <b>complete</b> <b>system</b> if and only if the set Lin(L) of all words corresponding to L is a pure unitary language generated by a set closed under the conjugacy relation. The class of pure unitary languages was introduced by A. Ehrenfeucht, D. Haussler, G. Rozenberg in 1983, as a subclass of the class of context-free languages, together with a characterization of regular pure unitary languages by means of a decidable property. As a direct consequence, we characterize (regular) circular languages generated by <b>complete</b> <b>systems.</b> We can also decide whether the language generated by a <b>complete</b> <b>system</b> is regular. Finally, we point out that <b>complete</b> <b>systems</b> have the same computational power as finite simple systems, an easy type of circular splicing system defined in the literature from the very beginning, when only one rule is allowed. From our results <b>on</b> <b>complete</b> <b>systems,</b> it follows that finite simple systems generate a class of context-free languages containing non-regular languages, showing the incorrectness of a longstanding result on simple systems...|$|R
