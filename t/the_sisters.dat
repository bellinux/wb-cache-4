5|$|The Misericorde Sisters {{were not}} well liked by the Montreal community. Throughout {{the early years}} of the Hospice de Sainte-Pélagie and the Institute, the {{locations}} in which Jetté and <b>the</b> <b>Sisters</b> worked were kept secret, in order to protect the single mothers from public hostility towards prostitutes and unwed mothers.

Combined with the competency of the Misericorde Sisters, and their non-profit mandate, this friction bloomed into hostility between <b>the</b> <b>Sisters</b> and Montreal physicians, who came to see the midwives as a professional threat.|$|E
