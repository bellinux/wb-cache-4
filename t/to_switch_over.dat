5|$|An {{agreement}} was signed with Amadeus in 2007 to upgrade Biman's ticketing system with an e-ticketing solution {{to comply with}} IATA rules, which set out a deadline of 31 December 2007 for all member airlines <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>over</b> their ticketing systems. E-ticketing has enabled major airlines to provide online check-in facilities, reducing the need to queue up at check-in counters. However, Biman has not made any attempts to improve customer service through the adoption of e-ticketing, {{although it has been}} able to reduce its own costs. In 2005, Biman had briefly stopped using the Amadeus ticketing system when the government suspended the operation of a local Amadeus subsidiary following a court order, after allegations of money laundering. The suspension, however, lasted only a month, and was lifted after the writ was appealed in the High Court.|$|E

He sought the co-operation of the then existing theatre groups to realize his plans to establish a bilingual theatre in Lucknow. But his effort failed to elicit any response from them. He even brought the production rights of Mohan Rakesh’s well known play, Adhe-Adhure, which he could not stage for want of a suitable cast.

25|$|The bailout {{block is}} a small {{manifold}} fitted either to the harness where {{it is in a}} convenient but protected position, commonly on the right side on the waist strap, or on the helmet, also usually {{on the right side of}} the temple, with the valve knob to the side to distinguish it from the free-flow or defogging valve which is commonly to the front. The bailout block has a connection for the main gas supply from the umbilical through a non-return valve. This route can not be closed and supplies the helmet demand valve and free flow valve under normal circumstances. The bailout gas from the back mounted cylinder passes through a conventional scuba first stage at the cylinder valve, to the bailout block, where it is normally isolated by the bailout valve. When the diver needs <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>over</b> to bailout gas he simply opens the bailout valve and the gas is supplied to the helmet or mask. As the valve is normally closed, a leak in the first stage regulator seat will cause the interstage pressure to rise, and unless an overpressure relief valve is fitted to the first stage the hose may burst. Aftermarket overpressure valves are available which can be fitted into a standard low-pressure port of most first stages.|$|E

500|$|After {{the release}} of The Jazz Singer in 1927—the first feature-length film with some audible dialog—sound films, or talkies as they became nicknamed, were all the rage. The {{transition}} from silent to sound panicked many—if not all—involved with the film industry; many silent film stars found themselves unemployable because of their undesirable voices and hard-to-understand accents or simply because of their refusal {{to make the transition}} to talkies. Many studios and stars avoided making the transition as long as possible, especially MGM, which was the last studio <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>over</b> to sound. The Hollywood Revue of 1929 (1929) was one of the studio's first all-talking films, and their first attempt to showcase their stars' ability to make the transition from silent to sound. Crawford was among the dozen or more MGM stars included in the movie; she sang the song [...] "Got a Feeling for You" [...] during the film's first act.|$|E

500|$|Stuntman Derek Mears {{was hired}} to portray Jason Voorhees at the {{recommendation}} of special make-up effects supervisor Scott Stoddard. Before the producers contacted him, Mears had already heard about {{the production of a}} new Friday the 13th and had decided to start physical training so he could pursue the role. He was unaware that Stoddard and other industry professionals were suggesting him to the producers. The studio worried that Mears' pleasant demeanor might affect his ability to portray a menacing character, but Mears assured them he was suitable for the role. According to Mears, [...] "They were like, 'You're really nice...are you going to be able <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>over,</b> right?' I was like, 'I cage fight..and I've got a lot of dad issues. So yeah.'". Mears said he related to [...] "Jason the victim" [...] when he was growing up, and he wanted to portray Jason as a victim in the film. To Mears, Jason represents people who were bullied in high schoolspecifically those with physical deformitiesfor being outcasts. Jason is unusual because he exacts his revenge on those trying to take over his territory at Crystal Lake.|$|E
500|$|An {{hour and}} a half later, another eight Helldivers from Intrepid {{attacked}} Musashi again. One bomb hit the upper deck and failed to detonate; another hit the port side of the deck and penetrated two decks before exploding above one of the engine rooms.

500|$|The {{concept for}} Nine {{originated}} during staff discussions about how Shin Megami Tensei would {{work as an}} online title. Development started {{at some point in}} 2001, and was still in its early stages of development in October of that year. During its early stages, the game was known as Shin Megami Tensei Online. Although the team had the option of making NINE an online-exclusive title, Okada wanted a single-player mode to introduce players to the workings and world of the game. A part of the planned online component was teaming up with or fighting different players depending on their alignment. Nine is not the ninth game in Shin Megami Tensei series; the title refers to the number of moral alignments that are available in the Shin Megami Tensei games. The decision to create a nine-tiered alignment system was because Okada wanted to explore the original game's moral alignments in more detail. This was also the reason why the game was set between Shin Megami Tensei and its sequel. The setting was directly based on Tokyo's Shinjuku, Shibuya and Ikebukuro districts. The game was the first Megami Tensei title developed for the Xbox; the first <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>over</b> to a third-person camera perspective from the first-person perspectives of earlier Megami Tensei titles; the first to feature a customizable player avatar; and the first Megami Tensei game to feature fully 3D graphics, something previously accomplished with Maken X, a 1999 standalone game for the Dreamcast. Okada described the development process as [...] "challenging", with developing the new real-time battle system being a large part of that challenge. Two prevalent issues were adjusting the balance of the battle system, and incorporating the second tactical system for the hacking segments.|$|E
500|$|On 26 July 1986, Hezbollah {{freed the}} American hostage Father Lawrence Jenco, {{former head of}} Catholic Relief Services in Lebanon. Following this, William Casey, head of the CIA, {{requested}} that the United States authorize sending a shipment of small missile parts to Iranian military forces {{as a way of}} expressing gratitude. Casey also justified this request by stating that the contact in the Iranian government might otherwise lose face or be executed, and hostages might be killed. Reagan authorized the shipment to ensure that those potential events would not occur. North used this release to persuade Reagan <b>to</b> <b>switch</b> <b>over</b> to a [...] "sequential" [...] policy of freeing the hostages one by one, instead of the [...] "all or nothing" [...] policy that the Americans had pursued until then. By this point, the Americans had grown tired of Ghobanifar who had proven himself a dishonest intermediary who played off both sides to his own commercial advantage. In August 1986, the Americans had established a new contact in the Iranian government, Ali Hashemi Bahramani, the nephew of Rafsanjani and an officer in the Revolutionary Guard. The fact that the Revolutionary Guard was deeply involved in international terrorism seemed only to attract the Americans more to Bahramani, who was seen as someone with the influence to change Iran's policies. Richard Secord, an American arms dealer who was being used as a contract with Iran wrote to North: [...] "My judgement is that we have opened up a new and probably better channel into Iran". North was so impressed with Bahramani that he arranged for him to secretly visit Washington D.C and gave him a guided tour at midnight of the White House.|$|E
