5|$|Bigg's {{techniques}} {{also revealed}} the Pacific Northwest population {{was in the}} low hundreds rather than the thousands that had been previously assumed. The southern resident community alone had lost 48 of its members to captivity; by 1976, only 80 remained.

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>species</b> <b>that</b> have {{cartilage}} in the sublingua or lytta, that cartilage is not {{derived from}} the hyoid bone or hyoid arch (the bone and cartilage that supports the tongue). Instead, the cartilage of the sublingua is a separately developed structure specifically adapted to support the sublingua.|$|E
5|$|Not every {{transitional}} form {{appears in}} the fossil record, because the fossil record is not complete. Organisms are only rarely preserved as fossils {{in the best of}} circumstances, and only a fraction of such fossils have been discovered. Paleontologist Donald Prothero noted that this is illustrated {{by the fact that the}} number of species known through the fossil record was less than 5% of the number of known living species, suggesting that the number of species known through fossils must be far less than 1% of all <b>the</b> <b>species</b> <b>that</b> have ever lived.|$|E

5|$|There {{are reasons}} that seamounts are biologically important. They rise {{high in the}} water column, {{creating}} complex current patterns that support life on, around, and above the seamount. The surface of the seamount also provides a substrate upon which organisms can attach themselves and grow. This in turn supports <b>the</b> <b>species</b> <b>that</b> feed on them, in turn supporting the whole ecological food web. Scientists have found that seamounts often provide a habitat for endemic species that are not found anywhere else.|$|E
5|$|Though P. rebeli parasitizes the Myrmica schencki ants and Gentiana cruciata food plant, it also {{acts as a}} host to the {{parasitoid}} ichneumon wasp (Ichneumon eumerus). The I. eumerus is a wasp {{that attempts}} to parasitize the P. rebeli {{after it has been}} introduced to the Myrmica ants' nests. The adult wasp searches for Myrmica ant nests by responding strongly to the scent of Myrmica schencki ants, <b>the</b> <b>species</b> <b>that</b> P. rebeli most commonly and successfully parasitizes.|$|E

5|$|A strain is a {{subgroup}} within <b>the</b> <b>species</b> <b>that</b> has {{unique characteristics}} that {{distinguish it from}} other strains. These differences are often detectable only at the molecular level; however, they may result in changes to the physiology or lifecycle of the bacterium. For example, a strain may gain pathogenic capacity, {{the ability to use}} a unique carbon source, the ability to take upon a particular ecological niche, or the ability to resist antimicrobial agents. Different strains of E. coli are often host-specific, making it possible to determine the source of fecal contamination in environmental samples. For example, knowing which E. coli strains are present in a water sample allows researchers to make assumptions about whether the contamination originated from a human, another mammal, or a bird.|$|E
5|$|Allosaurus is {{regarded}} as senior synonym of the genera Creosaurus, Epanterias, and Labrosaurus. Most of <b>the</b> <b>species</b> <b>that</b> are regarded as synonyms of A. fragilis, or that were misassigned to the genus, are obscure and were based on scrappy remains. One exception is Labrosaurus ferox, named in 1884 by Marsh for an oddly formed partial lower jaw, with a prominent gap in the tooth row {{at the tip of}} the jaw, and a rear section greatly expanded and turned down. Later researchers suggested that the bone was pathologic, showing an injury to the living animal, and that part of the unusual form of the rear of the bone was due to plaster reconstruction. It is now regarded as an example of A. fragilis.|$|E
5|$|Caron and Jackson {{found that}} about 25% of the 172 known species were {{abundant}} and widespread throughout the time {{range of the}} GPB, {{while the majority of}} species were rare, and occurred in a small area {{for a short period of}} time. In most layers the five most abundant species accounted for 50% to 75% of individual animals. <b>The</b> <b>species</b> <b>that</b> had wide ranges in time and space may have been generalists, while the rest were specialists in particular types of environment. Alternatively some wide-ranging species may have been opportunists that were quick to recolonize the area after each burial event. The 6 species that appeared in all layers were very probably generalists.|$|E

5|$|Catches in 2007 {{amounted}} to 384 Striped Dolphins, 300 Bottlenose Dolphins, 312 Risso's Dolphins and 243 Southern Short Finned Pilot Whales, {{for a total}} of 1,239 animals. These numbers do not include dolphins or other small whale species killed using various other methods, such as offshore harpoon hunts, in which mainly porpoises are killed. Another 77 Bottlenose Dolphins, 8 Risso Dolphins, 5 Southern Short Finned Pilot Whales were captured for use in the entertainment industry in Japan, China, Korea, and Taiwan. The quota set by the government for <b>the</b> <b>species</b> <b>that</b> were targeted in drive hunts that year allowed for the capture of 685 Striped Dolphins, 1,018 Bottlenose Dolphins, 541 Risso's Dolphins, and 369 Southern Short Finned Pilot Whales.

5|$|Conway Morris {{found that}} the shelly fossils in Walcott's Phyllopod Bed were about as {{abundant}} as in other shelly fossil deposits, but accounted for only 14% of the Phyllopod Bed fossils. Assuming that, as in modern marine ecosystems, about 70% of <b>the</b> <b>species</b> <b>that</b> lived in the Early Cambrian seas are unsuitable for fossilization, he estimated that the shelly fossils probably represent about 2% of the animals that were alive at the time. Since these shelly fossils are found {{in other parts of}} North America and, in many cases, over a much wider range, the Burgess Shale fossils, including the soft-bodied ones, probably show how much diversity could be expected at other sites if Burgess Shale type preservation were found there.|$|E
5|$|During the Cretaceous period, a few {{species of}} {{primitive}} ants ranged widely on the Laurasian supercontinent (the Northern Hemisphere). They were scarce {{in comparison to}} the populations of other insects, representing only about 1% of the entire insect population. Ants became dominant after adaptive radiation {{at the beginning of the}} Paleogene period. By the Oligocene and Miocene, ants had come to represent 20–40% of all insects found in major fossil deposits. Of <b>the</b> <b>species</b> <b>that</b> lived in the Eocene epoch, around one in 10 genera survive to the present. Genera surviving today comprise 56% of the genera in Baltic amber fossils (early Oligocene), and 92% of the genera in Dominican amber fossils (apparently early Miocene).|$|E

5|$|Like most seabirds, the {{majority}} of procellariids breed once a year. There are exceptions; many individuals of the larger species, such as the white-headed petrel, will skip a breeding season after successfully fledging a chick, {{and some of the}} smaller species, such as the Christmas shearwaters, breed on a nine-month schedule. Among those that breed annually, there is considerable variation as to the timing; some species breed in a fixed season while others breed all year round. Climate and the availability of food resources are important influences on the timing of procellariid breeding; species that breed at higher latitudes always breed in the summer as conditions are too harsh in the winter. At lower latitudes many, but not all, species breed continuously. Some species breed seasonally, to avoid competition with other species for burrows, to avoid predation or to take advantage of seasonally abundant food. Others, such as the tropical wedge-tailed shearwater, breed seasonally for reasons unknown. Among <b>the</b> <b>species</b> <b>that</b> exhibit seasonal breeding there can be high levels of synchronization, both of time of arrival at the colony and of lay date.|$|E
5|$|Poison dart frog (also {{known as}} dart-poison frog, poison frog or {{formerly}} known as poison arrow frog) is the common name {{of a group of}} frogs in the family Dendrobatidae which are native to tropical Central and South America. These species are diurnal and often have brightly colored bodies. This bright coloration is correlated with the toxicity of the species, making them aposematic. Some species of the family Dendrobatidae exhibit extremely bright coloration along with high toxicity, while others have cryptic coloration with minimal to no amount of observed toxicity. <b>The</b> <b>species</b> <b>that</b> have great toxicity derive this from their diet of ants, mites and termites. Other species however, that exhibit cryptic coloration and low to no amounts of toxicity, eat a much larger variety of prey. Many species of this family are threatened due to human infrastructure encroaching the places they inhabit.|$|E
5|$|Scyllarides latus was {{originally}} {{classified in the}} genus Scyllarus, along with the four other slipper lobsters known at the time (Scyllarus arctus, Scyllarides aequinoctialis, Thenus orientalis and Arctides guineensis). Separate genera were first introduced by William Elford Leach in 1815, namely Thenus and Ibacus. In 1849, Wilhem de Haan divided the genus Scyllarus into two genera, Scyllarus and Arctus, but made the error of including the type species of Scyllarus in the genus Arctus. This was first recognised by the ichthyologist Theodore Gill in 1898, who synonymised Arctus with Scyllarus, and erected a new genus Scyllarides to hold <b>the</b> <b>species</b> <b>that</b> De Haan had placed in Scyllarus. Scyllarides {{is placed in the}} subfamily Arctidinae, which is differentiated from other subfamilies by the presence of multiarticulated exopods on all three maxillipeds, and a three-segmented palp on the mandible. The only other genus in the subfamily, Arctides, is distinguished by having a more highly sculptured carapace, with an extra spine behind each eye, and a transverse groove on the first segment of the abdomen.|$|E

5|$|The {{barndoor}} skate {{is one of}} five skates in the Gulf of Maine that has commercial value, but of those, <b>the</b> <b>species</b> <b>that</b> are most frequently targeted are the winter skate (Leucoraja ocellata) and the thorny skate (Amblyraja radiata). The {{barndoor skate}} is most commonly considered by-catch by commercial trawlers operating in the northwestern Atlantic that target other commercially valuable species of fish using bottom trawling. When harvested, the flesh of the barndoor skate is used as bait, fish meal, pet food, and the meat from its wings is sold for human consumption. Since 1981, landings of skates have increased substantially, partly in response to increased demand for lobster bait, and more significantly, to the increased export market for skate wings. Currently, commercial retention and sale of barndoor skate is prohibited in the United States.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} spring, the queen {{comes out of}} {{diapause}} and finds a suitable place to create her colony. Then she builds wax cells in which to lay her eggs which were fertilised the previous year. The eggs that hatch develop into female workers, and in time, the queen populates the colony, with workers feeding the young and performing other duties similar to honeybee workers. In temperate zones, young queens (gynes) leave the nest in the autumn and mate, often more than once, with males (drones) that are forcibly driven out of the colony. The drones and workers die as the weather turns colder; the young queens feed intensively to build up stores of fat for the winter. They survive in a resting state (diapause), generally below ground, until the weather warms up in the spring with the early bumblebee being <b>the</b> <b>species</b> <b>that</b> is {{among the first to}} emerge. Many species of bumblebee follow this general trend within the year. Bombus pensylvanicus is a species that follows this type of colony cycle. For this species the cycle begins in February, reproduction starts in July or August, and ends in the winter months. The queen remains in hibernation until spring of the following year in order to optimize conditions to search for a nest.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>species</b> <b>that</b> Korhonen called EBSB {{was named}} A.bulbosa by Helga Marxmüller in 1982, {{as it was}} thought to be {{equivalent}} to Armillaria mellea var. bulbosa, first described by Joseph Barla in 1887, and later raised to species status by Josef Velenovský in 1927. In 1973, the French mycologist Henri Romagnesi, unaware of Velenovský's publication, published a description of the species he called Armillariella bulbosa, based on specimens he had found near Compiègne and Saint-Sauveur-le-Vicomte in France. These specimens were later demonstrated to be the same species as the EBSE of Korhonen; EBSB was later determined to be A.cepistipes. Therefore, the name A.bulbosa was a misapplied name for EBSE. In 1987 Romagnesi and Marxmüller renamed EBSE to Armillaria gallica. Another synonym, A.lutea, had originally been described by Claude Casimir Gillet in 1874, and proposed as a name for EBSE. Although the name had priority due to its early publication date, it was rejected as a nomen ambiguum {{because of a lack of}} supporting evidence to identify the fungus, including a specimen, type locality, and incomplete collection notes. A.inflata (Velenovský, 1920) may represent another synonym, but the type specimens were not preserved, so it is considered a dubious name (nomen dubium). As of 2010, both the Index Fungorum and MycoBank consider Armillaria gallica Marxm. & Romagn. to be the current name, with A.bulbosa and A.lutea as synonyms.|$|E
