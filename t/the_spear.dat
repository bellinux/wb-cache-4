5|$|Another {{follow-up}} {{game called}} Indiana Jones and <b>the</b> <b>Spear</b> of Destiny was planned, which revolved around <b>the</b> <b>Spear</b> of Longinus. Development was outsourced {{to a small}} Canadian studio, but eventually stopped as LucasArts did not have experience with the supervision of external teams. Elaine Lee loosely reworked the story into another four-part comic book series, released from April to July 1995.|$|E

50|$|As for <b>the</b> <b>Spears</b> issue, <b>the</b> SARU Presidents' Council {{issued a}} {{recommendation}} on 24 March that SA Rugby revisit {{the decision to}} admit <b>the</b> <b>Spears.</b> On 19 April, the decision to admit <b>the</b> <b>Spears</b> was officially overturned.|$|R
25|$|Originally, the fifth-place South African {{side was}} to be {{replaced}} by <b>the</b> <b>Spears,</b> who were initially planned to compete in the 2007 and 2008 competitions. However, the South African Rugby Union (SARU) revisited the decision to admit <b>the</b> <b>Spears,</b> and announced on 19 April 2006 that <b>the</b> <b>Spears</b> would not enter the competition.|$|R
50|$|On 21 July the Cape Town High Court {{heard the}} closing {{arguments}} from both <b>the</b> <b>Spears</b> and <b>the</b> SARU/SA Rugby (Pty) Ltd. Whilst <b>the</b> <b>Spears</b> argued that <b>the</b> SARU, and its commercial associate, SA Rugby were legally bound to include <b>the</b> <b>Spears</b> in competition, <b>the</b> {{counsel for the}} SARU argued {{that there was no}} legally binding contract between the two parties.|$|R
5|$|Chlamys hastata, <b>the</b> <b>spear</b> scallop, spiny scallop or {{swimming}} scallop, is {{a species}} of bivalve mollusc in the family Pectinidae found {{on the west coast}} of North America from the Gulf of Alaska to San Diego, California.

5|$|Mycenaean armies shared several common {{features}} with other significant Late Bronze Age powers: they were initially based on heavy infantry, which bore spears, large shields and, in some occasions, armor. Later in the 13th century BC, Mycenaean warfare underwent major changes both in tactics and weaponry. Armed units became more uniform and flexible, while weapons became smaller and lighter. <b>The</b> <b>spear</b> remained the main weapon among Mycenaean warriors until {{the collapse of}} the Bronze Age, while the sword played a secondary role in combat.|$|E
50|$|The High Court of South Africa gave <b>the</b> <b>Spears</b> a {{potential}} reprieve in August 2006 when it ruled that <b>the</b> <b>Spears</b> had a valid contract with SARU and its commercial arm, SA Rugby, to enter both the Currie Cup and Super 14. Both the SARU and SA Rugby planned to appeal this decision. In November 2006, all parties involved reached a settlement; <b>the</b> <b>Spears</b> dropped their suit and abandoned any attempts {{to enter the}} Super 14.|$|R
50|$|Shinji and Kaworu pilot Unit 13 {{on their}} mission to use <b>the</b> <b>Spears</b> of Cassius and Longinus, two ancient weapons, to undo Third Impact; Rei follows in Mark.09. When Unit 13 reaches {{the body of}} the alien lifeform Lilith, Kaworu realizes that <b>the</b> <b>spears</b> are not what he expected. Kaworu, Asuka and Mari attempt to stop Shinji, but Shinji removes <b>the</b> <b>spears.</b> On Gendo's orders, Mark.09 decapitates Mark.06 to release the Twelfth Angel, which is absorbed by Unit 13.|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{payments}} of salaries to Spears’ personnel were unilaterally suspended. <b>The</b> <b>Spears</b> were also due {{to compete in}} the 2006 Currie Cup competition, but that is in doubt due to the refusal by SA Rugby to continue financially supporting <b>the</b> <b>Spears.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{deaths of}} the men {{galvanized}} the missionary effort in the United States, sparking an outpouring of funding for evangelization efforts around the world. Their work is still frequently remembered in evangelical publications, and in 2006 {{was the subject of}} the film production End of <b>the</b> <b>Spear.</b> Several years after the death of the men, the widow of Jim Elliot, Elisabeth, and the sister of Nate Saint, Rachel, returned to Ecuador as missionaries with the Summer Institute of Linguistics (now SIL International) to live among the Huaorani. This eventually led to the conversion of many, including some of those involved in the killing. While largely eliminating tribal violence, their efforts exposed the tribe to increased influence from the outside.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{match was}} between Edge and Randy Orton. Edge took early {{control of the}} match by driving Orton into the {{barricade}} outside the ring. Orton was able to recover, and performed a rope hung DDT on Edge. While setting up for his finishing move, the RKO, Orton appeared to injure his arm, and went outside the ring {{in an attempt to}} recover. Edge followed him, trying to perform <b>the</b> <b>spear,</b> but Orton was able to avoid it, and Edge hit the barricade. Neither man was able to return to the ring before the count of ten, and as a result, the match ended in a double countout.|$|E
5|$|The three leading clans of Quraysh at {{that time}} were Banu Hashim, Banu Abd ad-Dar and Banu Makhzum, the latter clan being {{responsible}} for the matters of warfare. As {{a member of the}} Makhzum clan, who were amongst the best horsemen in Arabia, Khalid learned to ride and use such weapons as <b>the</b> <b>spear,</b> the lance, the bow and the sword. The lance was said to be his favorite among the weapons. In youth he was admired as a renowned warrior and wrestler among the Quraysh. Khalid was a cousin of Umar, the future second Caliph, and they looked very similar.|$|E
50|$|Following the High Court Ruling in mid-August, {{some have}} called into {{question}} how strong <b>the</b> <b>Spears</b> franchise would actually be in the 2006 Super 14 season. When <b>the</b> <b>Spears</b> future was cast into doubt, {{a lot of players}} were forced to join alternative clubs. Johnson signed with the Cheetahs, Dollie with the Western Province and Ashton Constant with the Pumas. In the three Unions that <b>the</b> <b>Spears</b> draw from, none are currently in the Premier Division of the Currie Cup.|$|R

5|$|They {{arrive at}} the Hall of the Grail, where the Knights are {{assembling}} to receive Holy Communion (""). The voice of Titurel is heard, telling his son, Amfortas, to uncover the Grail. Amfortas is wracked with shame and suffering ("").

He cries out for forgiveness ("") but hears only the promise that he {{will one day be}} redeemed by the pure fool.|$|E
5|$|After regrouping, Carter, Susan and Preacher go to a {{decompression}} {{chamber and}} swim to the surface. Carter {{realizes that the}} sharks made them flood the facility so they could escape through the weaker mesh fences at the surface. In an effort to distract the last shark from escaping to the open sea, Susan cuts herself and dives into the water. Although she manages to distract the shark, she is unable {{to get out of}} the water. Carter dives in, but is too late to save her from being devoured. While Carter is grabbing hold of the shark's dorsal fin, Preacher shoots the shark with a harpoon, but <b>the</b> <b>spear</b> also goes through Carter's thigh. As the shark breaks through the fence, Carter orders Preacher to connect the trailing wire to a battery, sending an electric current through the wire and to an explosive charge in the harpoon, killing the shark. In the end, Carter managed to free himself in time, and joins Preacher to see a workers' boat en-route on the horizon.|$|E
5|$|All {{but two of}} {{the fifteen}} {{multiplayer}} maps are based on locations explored throughout the God of War series, with eight of those based on locations explored in Ascension; for example, Desert of Lost Souls is from the original God of War, Bog of the Forgotten is from God of War II, and Labyrinth of Daedalus, Forum of Hercules, and Chamber of the Flame are from God of War III. The two original maps are the Coliseum of Persia and the Walls of Troy (which features the Trojan Horse). Every map features special power-ups awarded by the gods for earning points, such as the Boots of Hermes for acceleration and running attacks. Maps also have environmental obstacles or objectives to complete for more points. For example, on the Desert of Lost Souls map, the cyclops Polyphemus may attack nearby players and killing him with <b>the</b> <b>Spear</b> of Olympus will grant bonus points for that team.|$|E

5|$|Before her stasis aboard <b>the</b> <b>Spear</b> of Adun, Rohana was a driven protoss who was {{not afraid}} to seek out tasks others thought impossible. She {{displayed}} strict adherence to tradition, yet was creative {{when faced with the}} issues. After she was awakened, Rohana held on to the old ways of the Protoss Empire, openly speaking out against her Nerazim crew, Artanis' Terran allies, and the reawakening of the Purifiers. She served as a reminder of the past, clinging to old traditions and ways, and refusing to cut her connection from the Khala even as Amon continued to possess her, stating knowledge and history {{was the only thing that}} brought unity to the protoss. Though Artanis valued her memories and her ability to see into Amon's thoughts, he began to grow weary of her adherence to the old ways and her objections to his choices, becoming more of a critic than a councilor. Eventually, she came to terms with the Daelaam, and cut herself from the Khala, stating that perhaps history did not need to be recorded with perfect clarity.|$|E
5|$|David Scott's (1806–49) {{most ambitious}} {{historical}} work was the triptych Sir William Wallace, Scottish Wars: <b>the</b> <b>Spear</b> and English War: the Bow (1843). He also produced etchings for versions of Coleridge's Ancient Mariner, Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress and J. P. Nichol's Architecture of the Heavens (1850). Because of this early death {{he was known}} to, and admired by, the Pre-Raphaelite brotherhood mainly through his brother William Bell Scott (1811–90), who became {{a close friend of}} founding member D. G. Rossetti. The London-based Pre-Raphaelites rejected the formalism of Mannerist painting after Raphael. Bell Scott was patronised by the Pre-Raphaelite collector James Leathart. His most famous work, Iron and Coal {{was one of the most}} popular Victorian images and one of the few to fulfill the Pre-Raphaelite ambition to depict the modern world.|$|E
5|$|In the Prapancasarasara-samgraha, Dhumavati is {{described}} as having a black complexion and wearing ornaments made of snakes. Her dress is made of rags taken from cremation grounds. She holds a spear and a skull-cup (kapala) in her two hands. <b>The</b> <b>spear</b> is sometimes replaced by a sword. Another description in the same text says Dhumavati is aged with a wrinkled, angry face and cloud-like complexion. Her nose, eyes, and throat resemble a crow's. She holds a broom, a winnowing fan, a torch, and a club. She is cruel and frowning. Her hair appears dishevelled and she wears the simple clothes of a beggar. Her breasts are dry. Her hair is grey, her teeth crooked and missing, and her clothes old and worn.|$|E

5|$|Parsifal {{tells of}} his desire to return to Amfortas (""). He relates his long journey, how he wandered for years, {{unable to find a}} path back to the Grail. He had often been forced to fight, but never wielded <b>the</b> <b>Spear</b> in battle. Gurnemanz tells him that the curse {{preventing}} Parsifal from finding his right path has now been lifted, but that in his absence Amfortas has never unveiled the Grail, and lack of its sustaining properties has caused the death of Titurel. Parsifal is overcome with remorse, blaming himself for this state of affairs. Gurnemanz tells him that today is the day of Titurel's funeral, and that Parsifal has a great duty to perform. Kundry washes Parsifal's feet and Gurnemanz anoints him with water from the Holy Spring, recognizing him as the pure fool, now enlightened by compassion, and as the new King of the Knights of the Grail.|$|E
5|$|The Joker forces Batman {{into a game}} of {{hide and}} seek, giving him one hour to escape Arkham before his adversaries are sent to hunt him down. Although Batman {{initially}} refuses, he accepts the challenge after the Joker shoots a prison guard {{in the head and}} then threatens to kill Adams. However, unbeknownst to Batman, the Joker shortens the time from one hour to ten minutes after being pressured by the other inmates. Batman subsequently encounters Clayface, Mad Hatter, the Scarecrow, and Maxie Zeus, among other villains. During a struggle with Killer Croc, Batman is thrown out of a window, grabbing onto the statue of the angel Michael. Clutching the statue's bronze spear, Batman climbs back inside and impales Croc before throwing him out the window, sustaining a severe wound from <b>the</b> <b>spear</b> in the process.|$|E
