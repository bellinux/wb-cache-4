5|$|Both Lasser and Hornig printed fiction {{translated}} from French and German writers, including Otfrid von Hanstein and Otto Willi Gail. With {{the rise of}} Adolf Hitler in Germany in the 1930s a few readers (including Donald Wollheim) wrote letters complaining about the inclusion of German stories. The editorial response was a strong defense of the translations; Gernsback argued that events in Germany were irrelevant <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>of</b> selecting fiction.|$|E
5|$|In 1920, Donaldson made a then-controversial move {{by hiring}} an African-American {{journalist}} James Albert Jackson {{to write a}} weekly column devoted to African-American performers. According <b>to</b> <b>The</b> <b>Business</b> <b>of</b> Culture: Strategic Perspectives on Entertainment and Media, the column identified discrimination against black performers and helped validate their careers. Jackson {{was the first black}} critic at a national magazine with a predominantly white audience. According to his grandson, Donaldson also established a policy against identifying performers by their race. Donaldson died in 1925.|$|E
5|$|The papal entourage {{arrived in}} Trier on 30 November 1147, but shortly after arrival the pope {{decided to move}} the {{proceedings}} because of complaints from the residents of Trier, and announced in February 1148 that the council would move to Reims, but still on the date given before. A feature of the council was that the pope ordered the attendance of the various bishops and other officials. Although some requested attendees were excused, it was mostly due to ill health, not {{to the need to}} see <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>of</b> their offices. Those who did not attend were suspended from office. The Italian bishops, however, were mostly excused from attendance, as Eugene held a council at Cremona in July 1148 where the Reims decrees were announced.|$|E

5|$|The victor in {{the tale}} is the farmer's wife: she regains her errant duck and is {{rid of the}} predatory fox. Ostensibly, she confiscates Jemima's eggs believing Jemima will abandon them, but the eggs are not confiscated for the {{well-being}} of Jemima and her kin but {{for the well-being of}} the farmer's wife and her family: the eggs (or the ducks hatched from them) will end up on their dinner table. In this respect, the farmer's wife is a predator like the fox, but the fox is condemned for his predation. Human values are {{at the top of the}} tale's hierarchy. Potter argues for the well-ordered home and the practicalities of farm life over the fantasy lives of animals. It was the modus vivendi Potter was to incorporate in her own life as she devoted more of her thoughts and hours <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>of</b> farming and less to tales of fantasy animals.|$|E

25|$|The {{feelings}} {{of the members of}} this movement against the participation of foreign-born citizens in municipal affairs had grown very bitter, and Westervelt set himself so sternly against them that his house was mobbed again. Probably due to the paucity of support for his reformist efforts during his term, but also because he applied himself more and more <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>of</b> shipbuilding again, Westervelt declined a renomination, which for him was equivalent to an election, and was succeeded as Mayor by Fernando Wood.

25|$|Private motorcars were {{starting}} to become {{more common in the}} 1920s, but were initially more of a danger to tram passengers than <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>of</b> the Board. As many tramlines ran down the middle of a road, it was common to hail a tram by walking out into the road, which became more dangerous with the faster moving motorcars. Also, traffic behind a tram that had stopped to allow for the embarkation or disembarkation of passengers was only able to pass between the tram and curb, right into the path of passengers moving between the tram and footpath.|$|E

He began as a paymasters clerk on the gunboat Lexington, and was soon promoted to Master's Mate and then Ensign. During the war he saw action in the battles of Fort Henry, Donelson, Shiloh, Vicksburg and Red River. He was honorably discharged at New York in October 1865 and joined his brother, Alexander Megler, in Astoria, Oregon late that year. There he briefly joined his brother in running the Astoria Hotel; however within two years he sold his share in the business to Alexander Megler and returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>of</b> tinsmithing.|$|E

I therefore claimed {{to be included in the}} same category as the civilian railway officials and men of the breakdown gang, whose declared duty it was to clear the line, pointing out that though my action might differ in degree from theirs, it was of precisely the same character, and that if they were regarded as non-combatants I had a right to be considered a non-combatant too.|$|E

When carbon dioxide approaches dangerous levels, ground control must quickly invent {{a way to make}} the Command Module's square filters work in the Lunar Module's round receptacles. With the guidance systems on Aquarius shut down, the crew must make a difficult but vital course correction by manually igniting the Lunar Module's engine.|$|E

In the following season, the fourth division was renamed to the Championnat de France amateur and Valenciennes became inaugural champions of the league. Over the next seven seasons, Valenciennes played in the Championnat National, excluding one season back in the CFA. In the 2004–05 season, the club won National {{and returned to the}} second division, now called Ligue 2. Surprisingly, after one season, Valenciennes earned promotion back to the first division, now called Ligue 1, under the leadership of Antoine Kombouaré. After eight years in Ligue 1, {{the club was}} relegated to the second division in 2014. Because of this relegation, VAFC experienced financial problems and saw the return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>of</b> the former minister Jean-Louis Borloo.

25|$|Decades ago, Howard Stark {{worked with}} Anton Vanko {{to build the}} first arc reactor, but when Howard {{realized}} Vanko's greedy goals, he had him arrested and deported before, {{at the urging of}} Obadiah Stane, returning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>of</b> arms dealing that made him so successful in the past. In the present, Stark's son Tony uses the arc reactor technology to power his Iron Man armor, and after revealing this identity to the world, becomes a public hero. U.S. General Thaddeus Ross commissions Stark's business rival Justin Hammer to build a single-pilot vehicle to replace Iron Man, who has been interfering with and causing trouble for the military. When testing the new vehicle, the pilot crash lands in unfriendly territory, under attack from the Congolese army. Tony saves the airman, but, to the chagrin of Ross, refuses to return the Congolese soldiers' fire. Director Nick Fury and Agent Phil Coulson of S.H.I.E.L.D. later review Stark's actions.|$|E
25|$|While {{studying}} at the university, Kovalevsky {{participated in the}} 1869 student protests, meeting narodnik Sergey Nechayev there. For some time, he attended a group of Nechayev followers in St. Petersburg. In November 1869, Nechayev murdered his former follower I. I. Ivanov, and Kovalevsky gave him an opportunity to stay the night at his house. On 5 January 1870, Kovalevsky was arrested on accusations of sheltering Nechayev, and on 10 September he {{was transferred to the}} Peter-Paul Fortress. On 1 July 1871, Kovalevsky was brought to the court of the St. Petersburg judicial chamber on the accusation that without necessarily taking part in the plot to overthrow the existing order of control in Russia, he contributed in providing accommodation for Sergey Nechayev. On 22 August 1871, Kovalevsky was acquitted and released from the Peter-Paul Fortress on that same day. However, he was deprived of being able to work in any government service and was placed under police probation. In 1874, Kovalevsky planned to join the Circle of Tchaikovsky. As a result, he was also subject to a brief arrest relating <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>of</b> Sergey Stepnyak-Kravchinsky.|$|E
