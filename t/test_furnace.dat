40|$|Abstract In this work, the {{radiative}} {{heat transfer}} conditions in a 400 kWfuel <b>test</b> <b>furnace</b> were studied. The <b>test</b> <b>furnace</b> is a scaled pilot of a rotary kiln furnace used in iron ore pellet production. In particular, the study focuses on the choice of fuel and the subsequent effect on temperature and radiative conditions in the flame. Several co-firing flames of coal and biomass were investigated and also other fuels such as heavy fuel oil and natural gas. The <b>test</b> <b>furnace</b> {{was used in the}} experiments, and radiative intensity was measured with a narrow angle radiometer. Detailed radiation modelling was performed using spectral models for gas and particle properties. The results show that all co-firing flames give a shorter radiating flame length. Based on the radiation modelling, it was also shown that the particle radiation dominates the heat transfer from the flames. Due to the high pre-heating temperature of the combustion air (1100 °C), the flame temperatures were generally very high. The flame temperature in the natural gas flame was likely around 2000 °C while the coal flame temperatures were estimated to 1500 - 1600 °C. The two coals tested, having almost identical fuel specifications, resulted in a substantial difference in the radiation intensity emitted by the flame. This emphasizes the need of direct radiation measurements to evaluate fuel changes in industrial processes that are highly dependent on the heat transfer conditions...|$|E

A second set of experiments was performed in single runs in the furnace to show the effect of different types of sulfur source and feldspar on the quality and colour of ultramarine blue produced. Colour measurements indicate that the ultramarine with the best colour properties is produced when sodium sulfide is used as the sulfur source in the starting mixture. Analyses of products washed with different alkali solutions show that while washing with potassium hydroxide improves the colour properties of the pigment, it is less effective than sodium hydroxide at removing impurities in the product. The structures of the ultramarine blue products have been investigated using the Rietveld refinement of powder X-ray diffraction data.

40|$|This work {{studies the}} {{radiative}} heat transfer in a 580 kW(th) pilot scale <b>test</b> <b>furnace</b> that resembles a full-scale rotary kiln for iron ore pellet production. The aim is to quantify the {{radiative heat transfer}} in coal and cofiring flames and also to study the possibility to model the radiative heat transfer for such combustion conditions. Three combustion cases of coal and cofiring are studied, and an evaluation is made using a detailed radiation model. The <b>test</b> <b>furnace</b> is cylindrical and refractory lined but does not rotate and no iron ore pellet bed material is included. In-flame measurements of temperature, gas composition, particle concentration, radiative intensity, and radiative heat flux are conducted for the different fuels and fuel combinations. Overall, the differences in measured radiative intensities and heat fluxes among the three studied fuel cases are minor, which implies that introduction of renewable fuels by cofiring in a full-scale rotary kiln should be feasible with respect to heat transfer conditions. In the model, the furnace is treated as an axisymmetric and infinitely long cylinder, and gas properties are calculated with a statistical narrow-band model, while particle properties are calculated using Mie theory. The modeling results show reasonable to good predictivity compared to the measured intensity data. This indicates that the experimental data is of good quality but also indicates the potential use of the model in full-scale rotary kiln calculations in future work...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{discusses}} how {{a modified}} (variable heat flux) Cone Calorimeter {{can be used}} to approximately replicate heating regimes in standard <b>furnace</b> <b>testing.</b> The method is not exact as {{there are a number of}} physical differences between the two systems that are not accounted for, and the cone heater is unable to deliver sufficient heat flux to replicate aggressive furnace environments such as the hydrocarbon heating regime. Intumescent coatings testing is used (on an I-beam and a flat plate in the cone) to demonstrate the efficacy of the technique. The method as described relates to an internal <b>furnace</b> <b>test</b> (on an I-beam), but it is easily modifiable to other test scenarios such as a door test. Similarly, although the example discussed considers intumescent coatings testing, it is expected that a wide range of sample media could be tested in this way.

30|$|An {{example of}} a system {{which is based on}} a {{pre-existing}} standard <b>testing</b> <b>furnace</b> is the column testing facility at the Federal Institute for Materials Research and Testing (BAM), in Berlin, Germany. The BAM column testing facility is based on a standard column furnace, but rather than simply applying a constant axial testing load during fire, it can use a ‘hybrid’ sub-structuring system where the entire column is <b>tested</b> inside the <b>furnace</b> and measured forces are read and target displacements are controlled via simulated modeling into the substructure in real time (Korzen et al. 2010). The BAM furnace is capable of producing an ISO 834 (ISO 1999) fire on columns of up to 3.55 m in height. The furnace is fired by six oil burners. Six electro-hydraulic control channels are used to actively control mechanical boundary conditions (two bending rotations each at top and bottom, axial displacement at the bottom, and horizontal displacement at the top). This testing methodology allows single elements to be tested in isolation {{while the rest of the}} structure is ‘simulated’ by actively controlling the boundary conditions in real time during the test. A similar approach has recently been taken at the National Research Council of Canada, Ottawa, Canada, where an existing standard column <b>testing</b> <b>furnace</b> has been upgraded to permit ‘hybrid’ testing of isolated structural elements by active control of applied loads during testing, again using coupled numerical analysis of the full structure in real time (Mostafaei 2011).|$|R
