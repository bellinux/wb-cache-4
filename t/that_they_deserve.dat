The game is close, and Pam ends up injuring her ankle, although she wants to continue. Seeing an opportunity to remove Scranton's best player from the game, Charles insists that Pam take {{a seat on the}} grounds of her injury being a company liability. Determined to beat corporate, Jim takes Pam to a local hospital to get an X-ray while Dwight stalls the game to give them time to get back. When the doctor calls Jim into the room for an update, the doctor informs Jim and Pam of some news that causes them to be ecstatic, presumably that Pam is pregnant. Jim then calls Dwight to send in the substitute players.|$|E

I only care to speak the truth. The truth is that no one, not Natalie Portman, or even myself can come anywhere close {{to the level of a}} professional ballerina in a year and a half. Period. That doesn't mean that I don't admire Natalie and her acting. She is so talented and can inspire people, as well, with her own art form. She did an amazing job portraying her character in Black Swan. (Though the movie wasn't a completely realistic reflection of ballet or dancers.) My only wish is that Natalie, Darren, and certain others who worked closely on the movie could have grasped the beauty and the heart of true ballet. If they had, they would have advocated for this art more and given the real dancers the credit <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>deserve.</b>|$|E

500|$|Victor and Nikki are {{recognized}} as one of daytime television's most prominent couples. They have also garnered a large fan following, dubbed [...] "Niktor" [...] by viewers. In addition, the couple's weddings have been reported by mainstream media. Scott has said: [...] "Let’s face facts: [...] Victor and Nikki will always be a huge dynamic, they’ve been in a circular cycle for over 30 years! [...] Finding a new leading man that you have chemistry with is like finding gold." [...] In a 1994 interview with The Los Angeles Times, the newspaper reported that Victor's relationship with Nikki had [...] "registered an enduring appeal among viewers", with Braeden replying that, [...] "Arguably, it's the idea of this incredibly powerful, wealthy man taking a woman who comes from {{the wrong side of the}} tracks into his life, and shaping her and forming her more to his liking. But, of course, no one can shape or form anyone, she remains who she is, has retained her strength, and that causes conflict." [...] In other interviews, Braeden stated that he loves working with Scott and that he [...] "always thought it was an honestly felt love story with great material for conflict with Nikki". He also stated in an interview that he considers Victor's storylines with Nikki to be some of his favorites. Discussing Victor and Nikki's union, former As the World Turns actress Martha Byrne stated: [...] "Young and Restless Victor and Nikki are the perfect example of a couple who they can tear apart and put back together how many times? And [...] do it really well because they're so stable as characters that you can basically do anything with them now, and the audience will go on the journey with them." [...] The Museum of Television and Radio wrote: [...] "Combined with a series of social-issue storylines covering everything from AIDS to date rape to the plight of the elderly, as well as featuring a group of popular young African-American characters, and several long-term romantic and professional relationships, Victor and Nikki's love story has kept viewers enthralled for many years." [...] They also described their relationship as being a [...] "dominant force" [...] in the soap opera. Daytime journalist Michael Fairman stated: [...] "Victor and Nikki just can’t, we mean can’t, ever get it together long enough to find any happiness with each other. So, many would say <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>deserve</b> each other and the baggage and betrayals that come along with their co-dependent relationship." ...|$|E

2500|$|Although Satan's army inevitably {{loses the}} war against God, Satan {{achieves}} {{a position of power}} and begins his reign in Hell with his band of loyal followers, composed of fallen angels, which is described to be a [...] "third of heaven". Satan's characterization as the leader of a failing cause folds into this as well and is best exemplified through his own quote, [...] "to be weak is to be miserable; Doing or Suffering", as through shared solidarity espoused by empowering rhetoric, Satan riles up his comrades in arms and keeps them focused towards their shared goal. [...] Similar to Milton's republican sentiments of overthrowing the King of England for both better representation and parliamentary power, Satan argues that his shared rebellion with the fallen angels is an effort to [...] "explain the hypocrisy of God", and in doing so, they will be treated with the respect and acknowledgement <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>deserve.</b> As scholar Wayne Rebhorn argues, [...] "Satan insists that he and his fellow revolutionaries held their places by right and even leading him to claim that they were self-created and self-sustained" [...] and thus Satan's position in the rebellion is much like that of his own real world creator.|$|E

[...] Early in December, however, Australian captain Ricky Ponting drew considerable criticism for his comments about the ICC's wines and spirits. [...] "It has taken us a long time and a lot of great wins in different conditions around the world to get us to that number-one spot", Ponting declared, speaking to the Associated Press. [...] "If South Africa beat us three-nil I don't know if that gives them enough points to get over us. [...] But if they won the series one-nil or two-one, I don't think that would mean <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>deserve</b> to take over that mantle. [...] It's a bit the same with India last series.

In December 1967, during a forum in New York, Chomsky responded to criticisms of the Chinese revolution as follows, [...] "I don't feel <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>deserve</b> a blanket condemnation at all. There are many things to object to in any society. But take China, modern China; one also finds many things that are really quite admirable." [...] Chomsky continued: [...] "There are even better examples than China. But I do think that China is an important example of a new society in which very interesting positive things happened at the local level, in which {{a good deal of the}} collectivization and communization was really based on mass participation and took place after a level of understanding had been reached in the peasantry that led to this next step."

Additionally, every short was remastered in high definition, a first for the Stooge films. Previous DVD releases were based on themes (wartime, history, work, etc.), and sold poorly. Fans and critics alike praised Sony for finally giving the Stooges the proper DVD treatment. One critic states [...] "the Three Stooges on DVD has been a real mix'n match hodgepodge of un-restored titles and illogical entries.

[...] Videolibrarian.com critic added [...] "finally, the studio knuckleheads got it right!

[...] Critic James Plath of DVDtown.com added, [...] "Thank you, Sony, for finally giving these Columbia Pictures icons the kind of DVD retrospective <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>deserve.</b> Remastered in High Definition and presented in chronological order, these short films now give fans the chance to appreciate the development {{of one of the most}} successful comedy teams in history." ...|$|E
