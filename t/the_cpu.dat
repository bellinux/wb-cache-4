5|$|Podgorny {{became the}} Director of the Moscow Technological Institute of Food Industry in 1942, during the Great Patriotic War (World War II). After {{the liberation of}} Ukraine {{from the hands of}} Nazi Germany, Podgorny {{reestablished}} Soviet control over Ukraine on the orders of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (Ukrainian SSR) and the Soviet Government. In the post-war years Podgorny regained his old office of Deputy People's Commissar for Food Industry of the Ukrainian SSR, but was later appointed in 1946 as a Permanent Representative to the Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian SSR. In April 1950 he was made First Secretary of the Kharkiv Regional Committee of the Communist Party of Ukraine (CPU). In 1953 Podgorny was elevated to Second Secretary of the Central Committee (CC) of <b>the</b> <b>CPU.</b> From 1957 to 1963 he was First Secretary of the CC of <b>the</b> <b>CPU.</b> In this role, Podgorny worked on reorganising and modernising the Ukrainian economy, which had been destroyed during the war years. He worked to increase the rate of industrial and agricultural production and to improve people's welfare. He paid particular attention to improving party organisation and educating new cadres.|$|E

5|$|Backbreaker is a simulation-style American {{football}} game, {{which allows}} the player {{to take control of}} a team of football players and compete against <b>the</b> <b>CPU</b> or another player in a variety of game modes. The game features 56 built-in teams plus three unlockable teams, and also allows the player to create 32 additional ones for a total of 91 possible teams. It lacks any licensing from the National Football League, {{due to the fact that}} they were not able to negotiate a licensing agreement with the NFL or NFLPA Because of this, the developers emphasized the game's customization tools.|$|E
5|$|CAPS {{entreprise}} and Pathscale {{are also}} coordinating {{their effort to}} make hybrid multi-core parallel programming (HMPP) directives an open standard called OpenHMPP. The OpenHMPP directive-based programming model offers a syntax to efficiently offload computations on hardware accelerators and to optimize data movement to/from the hardware memory. OpenHMPP directives describe remote procedure call (RPC) on an accelerator device (e.g. GPU) or more generally a set of cores. The directives annotate C or Fortran codes to describe two sets of functionalities: the offloading of procedures (denoted codelets) onto a remote device and the optimization of data transfers between <b>the</b> <b>CPU</b> main memory and the accelerator memory.|$|E
5|$|Planning of the ZX Spectrum+ {{started in}} June 1984, {{and it was}} {{released}} in October the same year. This 48KB Spectrum (development code-name TB) introduced a new QL-style case with an injection-moulded keyboard and a reset button that was basically a switch that shorted across <b>the</b> <b>CPU</b> reset capacitor. Electronically, it was identical to the previous 48KB model. It was possible {{to change the system}} boards between the original case and the Spectrum+ case. It retailed for £179.95. A DIY conversion-kit for older machines was available. Early on, the machine outsold the rubber-key model 2:1; however, some retailers reported a failure rate of up to 30%, compared with a more usual 5–6% for the older model.|$|E

EFI handles booting differently from BIOS-based computers, but provides backwards compatibility, allowing dual and triple boot configurations. In addition to OS X, the Microsoft Windows operating system is installable on Intel x86-based Apple computers. Officially, this is limited to both 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 10 with the necessary hardware drivers included with the Boot Camp software. Other x86 operating systems such as Linux are also unofficially supported.

5|$|The morale {{system in}} the game is similar to {{previous}} Dynasty Warrior games. Morale is increased and decreased by performing a number of positive actions for the player’s army. Action that produce this effect include defeating enemies in multiples of fifty, defeating enemy officers, and completing special events such as ambushes, siege attacks, and finding enemy strongholds. Morale in the game has a strong effect on the player's forces, determining their strength and speed, {{as well as their}} ability to perform Berwald attacks. Morale will also affect how <b>the</b> <b>CPU</b> characters move along through battle. Example: Ally Oxenstiernas are winning.|$|E
5|$|Sarah gathers {{weapons from}} an old friend and plans to flee with John to Mexico, but after having a {{nightmare}} about Judgment Day, she instead sets out to kill Dyson {{in order to prevent}} Judgment Day from occurring. Finding him at his home, she wounds him but finds herself unable to kill him in front of his family. John and the Terminator arrive and inform Dyson of the future consequences of his work. They learn that much of his research has been reverse engineered from the damaged CPU and the right arm of the previous Terminator. Convincing him that these items and his designs must be destroyed, they break into the Cyberdyne building, retrieve <b>the</b> <b>CPU</b> and the arm, and set explosives to destroy Dyson's lab. The police arrive and Dyson is lethally shot, but he detonates the explosives when he dies. The T-1000 relentlessly pursues the surviving trio, eventually cornering them in a steel mill.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} toolkit for the Motorola CPU {{included a}} compiler for the C programming language, {{which the two}} programmers were familiar with. After Atari had conducted performance evaluations, it approved usage of the language. Cerny and Flanagan's decision to program Marble Madness in the C language had positive and negative consequences. Atari games had previously been programmed in assembly language. The C language was easier to program, but was less efficient, so the game operates at the slower speed of 30Hz instead of the normal 60Hz frequency of arcade games at the time. Cerny decided to use a trackball system (marketed by Atari as Trak-Ball) to give the game a unique control system, and he chose a motorized trackball for faster spinning and braking when the in-game ball traveled downhill and uphill, respectively. As it was building the prototypes, Atari's design department informed Cerny that the motorized trackball's design had an inherent flaw—one of the four supports had poor contact with the ball—and {{the use of a}} regular trackball was more feasible. Additionally, Cerny had anticipated the use of powerful custom chips that would allow RAM-based sprites to be animated by <b>the</b> <b>CPU,</b> but the available hardware was a less-advanced system using ROM-based, static sprites.|$|E
5|$|The story mode {{is split}} into several chapters. As the {{narrative}} plays out, the player swaps between different characters. Minigames are also {{incorporated into the}} story. The outcome of minigames can impact an upcoming battle, such as giving the player a health advantage over <b>the</b> <b>CPU</b> opponent. Additional game features include Battle Mode, Versus Mode, Training Mode, and S.T.A.R. Labs, which includes 240 character-specific challenges of varying difficulty. Online multiplayer modes include King of the Hill, a setup that allows up to eight players to spectate a match while waiting for their turn to fight, and Survivor, which carries over the current winner's health bar and character selection over each match. Playing through any of the game modes, including online matches with optional goal objectives, will net the player experience points {{that may be used}} to unlock alternate costumes, music, concept art, and other rewards.|$|E
