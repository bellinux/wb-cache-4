500|$|The script {{numbered}} roughly 550 pages when completed, {{about four}} {{times the size of}} an average Hollywood screenplay. It also included another 100 pages of storyboards representing a total of 800 scenes. In preparation for writing it, Williams spent six months watching horror films and reading horror novels, as well as reading books about how to write horror novels and screenplays. She also asked people she knew socially to tell her scary stories so she could identify the elements of fear. She immersed herself so deeply into the genre that she began having nightmares and had to scale back her reading. She also spent about six months researching historical aspects of the story before the writing process. Williams had a history of using female protagonists in her games, like the Laura Bow series and some of the King's Quest games. She said her own personality was a partial inspiration for the protagonist Adrienne, although it was not purposeful: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> kind of naturally worked out that way." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Soldier" [...] {{was written}} by Badu {{immediately}} after receiving Riggins' beat for the song. He said Badu wanted it to have a sound similar to J Dilla and his Detroit hip hop scene, which Riggins was inspired by: [...] "A lot of producers from Detroit have a certain sound, and I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> comes from being in the city." [...] Its sociopolitical lyrics have Badu expressing sympathy and solidarity for those facing oppression, with references to police corruption, black-on-black crime, and Hurricane Katrina. [...] "The Cell" [...] was produced by Husayn and features a lively, choral style and hard bop feel. Titled {{as a metaphor for}} both heredity and confinement, the song is a tableau of crime, drugs, and desperation in urban decay, streamlined by a stark story about Brenda, a character who falls victim to her environment. Cited by Chavarria as the album's most effects-heavy track, [...] "Twinkle" [...] features a futuristic sound, a convoluted beat, and abstract aural elements such as white noise bursts, high-pitched voices, abrasive instruments, and layers of twinkling keyboard bass. The lyrics lament the plight of the Black community and the cyclical effects on African Americans by the various failures of American social institutions such as the health care, education, and prison systems. Badu raps in the song's verse, [...] "Children of the matrix be hittin’ them car switches / Seen some virgin Virgos hanging out with Venus bitches", followed by her singing, [...] "They don’t know their language, they don’t know their God". Over humming keyboards, the closing minutes of the song feature a speech in the ancient African language of Mdw Ntchr, followed by a speaker's rant inspired by actor Peter Finch's own rant in the 1976 film Network. The speaker angrily laments the state {{of the world and the}} complacency of people. Philadelphia Weeklys Craig D. Linsey likened [...] "Twinkle" [...] to a denser version of Marvin Gaye's 1971 song [...] "Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)".|$|E

2500|$|Since 1999, Mary Ellen Matthews {{has been}} the {{official}} photographer of SNL, responsible for devising distinctive photo layouts and aesthetics for still imagery used on the show. Matthews creates photo portraits of the hosts and musical guests of each episode which are used as commercial bumpers. The limited time frame between the host's involvement in the production process and the Live show requires Matthews to create makeshift photo studios on site at 30 Rock, with Matthews attempting to shoot the host on Tuesday and the musical guest on Thursday, although the availability of either can mean the photoshoot for both occurs as late as Thursday. Matthews employs flattering portrait lighting with hard lights to achieve a Hollywood style. On the lighting, Matthews commented: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> helps the image pop off the screen...If you use soft or flat lighting, it becomes not as dimensional...The [...] gives a little more contrast, and if I use edge lights and then light the background, it goes farther and farther back. I try to achieve that depth as much as I can." [...] Matthews is also responsible for taking cast photos, behind the scenes images, documenting rehearsals, and promotional photos. As of 2010, she has also been involved in directing videos, including the show title sequence.|$|E
2500|$|Responses to Gamergate have {{encouraged}} {{the video game}} industry to review its treatment of women and minorities, and to make changes to support them. Intel, following its accidental involvement in Gamergate, pledged more than $300 million to help support a [...] "Diversity in Technology" [...] program with partners including Sarkeesian's Feminist Frequency organization and the IGDA, aimed at {{increasing the number of}} women and minorities in the industry. Intel CEO Brian Krzanich stated in announcing the program that [...] "it's not good enough to say we value diversity, and then have our industry not fully represent". Electronic Arts (EA) COO Peter Moore said the controversy made EA pay more attention to diversity and inclusion, telling Fortune [...] "f there's been any benefit to Gamergate, ... I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> makes us think twice at times". Speaking about Gamergate harassment to the Seattle Times, IGDA executive director Kate Edwards said, [...] "Gaming culture has been pretty misogynistic for a long time now.

2500|$|In a November 2012 {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, series creator Ryan Murphy {{spoke about the}} inspiration for [...] "Dark Cousin", [...] "Well the episode {{is one of my}} favorites because I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> has great performances and I really love what it's about. I love Franny [...] and she and I were presenting at the Creative Arts Emmys and I said, 'I think I have something really good for you, sort of the opposite of what you did last year.' She and Jessica [...] loved working together. So we came up with this character and I like that she's around in all the individual stories at that pivotal moment of are you going to fight {{or are you going to}} die." [...] He added, [...] "But when we were coming with the idea of it, I was meeting with hair and make up and Lou Eyrich, the costumer, and we at first came up with this idea that she was the black version of Miss Havisham. But I didn't like that. I thought let's do something unexpected. So our inspirations were very bizarre. We took sort of like 1940s, hard-boiled noir women and mixed it with a sort of Comme des Garçons meets Japanese thing. I was very proud of that look and I thought Franny was very yummy. You could see why people would want her to kiss them." ...|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the band}} {{continues}} to incorporate occasional elements of ska into their music, The Aquabats have since distanced {{themselves from their}} association with the ska genre after having moved away from an overtly ska-based sound in the early 2000s, having since labeled themselves as simply a [...] "rock band" [...] in their official press biographies. In a 2012 interview, singer Christian Jacobs stated [...] "I don't think we ever considered ourselves a ska band. We were just The Aquabats. And some of the songs we happened to play were ska", noting elsewhere, [...] "It was never a deliberate thing , but I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> naturally happened because there's {{a lot of different}} styles of music that we play. I've always been into bands like Ween and things like that, that can chameleon-like drift from genre to genre and play whatever music they want...there's no boundaries. If you set yourself up as a punk band, then you pretty much just have to play punk. Or if you're a ska band, you just play ska". Chad Larson, speaking on the same matter, explained [...] "Having the same guitar rhythm for every song gets kind of boring...even on the earlier albums that had ska rhythms we were focusing more on the 'adventure' songs than really 'ska' songs. So as we grew as musicians, we wanted to experiment with different rhythms", adding [...] "we were never really a good ska band anyway".|$|E
2500|$|Sam's {{return to}} Walford saw her reignite {{an affair with}} her former, now married lover Steve Owen (Martin Kemp), who was embroiled in a feud with her brother Phil. Medcalf has {{revealed}} that she was extremely nervous when she was informed {{that she would have}} to enact love scenes with Kemp, who aside from his part in EastEnders, was renowned to viewers as a member of the 1980s pop band Spandau Ballet. Speaking about the characters' affair, Medcalf has said, [...] "Steve Owen basically made a play for her because he was using her to get back at Phil. He knew that Phil would hate it [...] they were rivals. But then, in her defence, he was a charmer, and he managed to keep it all from his wife. He just played the game very well." [...] The relationship ended in [...] "tragedy" [...] when Steve, in an attempt to kidnap Phil's daughter Louise, was killed in a road accident. Medcalf has suggested that Sam was [...] "devastated" [...] by Steve's death: [...] "She fell for [...] hook, line and sinker. She really believed that he was going to be the man." [...] She subsequently moved on to her former lover Beppe di Marco, but according to Medcalf, that relationship finished because Beppe [...] "thought [...] was a bit full on [...] she was so desperate for a relationship that I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> scared [...]" [...] Another fling followed with abusive Trevor Morgan, played by Alex Ferns. According to Ferns, the relationship started because Trevor wanted to make his wife, Little Mo (Kacey Ainsworth) jealous. In the storyline, the romance ended when Trevor's true aggressive self emerged.|$|E

2500|$|Nick Monson {{booked a}} two-hour session with songwriters Julia Michaels and Justin Tranter to adjust {{one of their}} compositions. Finishing the {{adjustment}} in 45 minutes, they {{decided to use the}} remaining time to write another song so that they would not waste the money for the studio time they paid for. [...] "Good for You" [...] was subsequently written in 45 minutes. It began with Monson playing its bassline and putting a snap on it before Michaels freestyled the opening lyric, [...] "I'm on my 14 carats". Her lyrics were influenced by her boyfriend who told her, [...] "Julia, you never write any happy songs for me. It's kind of sad," [...] to which she responded: [...] "Fine, I'll write a good song about you, shut up!". Tranter's lyrics were inspired by his ex-boyfriend who preferred him to dress femme. Upon hearing [...] "Good for You", the trio's A told them that the song should be recorded by Selena Gomez, despite Tranter initially thinking the song was [...] "too indie" [...] for her. The A sent the track to the singer who [...] "freaked out", deeming it the artistic direction she had envisioned for her second studio album, Revival (2015). She described the song as [...] "a piece that was just everything I feel a woman should embody, but not in the obvious way" [...] and explained to iHeartRadio: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>just</b> sets the tone perfect for the record just because it's sexy, but not trying too hard. The track and everything kind of does it itself. It's sensual, it reps women in a good way. I think it does something to a woman when they look good".|$|E
