25|$|What {{disturbs}} Delano are incidents {{he observes}} among the hatchet polishers, oakum pickers, {{such as when}} a black boy stabs a white one. Apparently Cereno does not care about this behavior, not even when Atufal, a regal-looking slave appears in chains but still refusing to humble himself. The whispering between Cereno and Babo makes Delano feel uncomfortable. Gradually his suspicions increase, as he notes Cereno's sudden waves of dizziness and anxiety, the crew's awkward movements and whisperings, and the unusual interaction of the slaves and the whites. Yet Delano answers Cereno’s questions about the crew, cargo, and arms aboard the Bachelor’s Delight without reserve, reasoning that the innocent are protected by <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> <b>When</b> The Rover arrives with the supplies, Delano sends her back for more water while he continues to observe curious incidents.|$|E
25|$|According to the Buddhist tradition, the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta is {{the first}} {{teaching}} given by the Buddha after he attained enlightenment.

Afterwards, he remained silent for forty-nine days. The Buddha then journeyed from Bodhgaya to Sarnath, a small town near the sacred city of Varanasi in central India. There he met his five former companions, the ascetics {{with whom he had}} shared six years of hardship. His former companions were at first suspicious of the Buddha, thinking he had given up his search for <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> <b>when</b> he renounced their ascetic ways. But upon seeing the radiance of the Buddha, they requested him to teach what he had learned. Thereupon the Buddha gave the teaching that was later recorded as the Dhammacakkappavattana Sutta, which introduces fundamental concepts of Buddhist thought, such as the Middle Way and the Four Noble Truths.|$|E

25|$|Following the {{mobilization}} of 1915 the Bulgarian General Staff was left with few unmobilized reservists. In order to secure a source of reinforcements for the army it opened new military schools for young infantry, cavalry, artillery officers and soldiers. Thus {{from the end of}} 1915 until the beginning of 1918 the four regular annual contingents of young conscripts were called and received their training. Their total number was 214,343 and was sufficient for the replacing the 181,515 casualties that had occurred. The exact number of all the mobilized men during the war however remains unclear. Some sources point at a number of 1,200,000 men which seems to be on the high side but still may be close to <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> <b>When</b> trying to determine the precise number it {{must be taken into account}} that towards September 1918 the Bulgarian Army reached a strength ranging between 855,175 and 877,392 men under arms in all branches of the service, or some 18% of the population, and that for the duration of the war the army also used the manpower of the territories it had occupied – some 133,837 men from the Macedonian regions were mobilized.|$|E
