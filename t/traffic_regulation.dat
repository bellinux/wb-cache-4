The Metropolitan Manila Development Authority is responsible for <b>traffic</b> <b>regulation</b> in the metropolis. In 1995, they implement road space rationing called Unified Vehicular Volume Reduction Program to reduce the traffic congestion. In Makati, they implement the number coding to all road vehicles from 7:00a.m. to 7:00p.m. with window hours of 10:00a.m. to 3:00p.m., except on freeways.|$|E

25|$|A traffic {{enforcement}} camera (also {{red light}} camera, road safety camera, road rule camera, photo radar, photo enforcement, speed camera, Gatso, safety camera, bus lane camera, flash for cash, Safe-T-Cam, depending on use) is a camera {{which may be}} mounted beside or over a road or installed in an enforcement vehicle to detect <b>traffic</b> <b>regulation</b> violations, including speeding, vehicles going through a red traffic light, vehicles going through a toll booth without paying, unauthorized use of a bus lane, or for recording vehicles inside a congestion charge area.

Most Greenways are operational between 07.30 and 09.30 and 16.00 to 18.30 Monday to Friday and 08.30 to 18.30 on Saturdays. There are exceptions to this e.g. on Glasgow Road the Greenway is not operational at all on a Saturday and Sunday. On the main route into Edinburgh city centre from the west - the A8 - 55% of the 6.7km route is inbound bus lane, whilst 54% is outbound bus lane. Lothian Buses and First Scotland East are the main providers of bus services using the greenways scheme, with services every 12 minutes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Traffic {{signs and}} rules play an {{important}} role in our daily life. Knowledge of them is crucial for surviving. However, every country has its own <b>traffic</b> <b>regulations</b> and they often differ in subtle ways. Also, the official <b>traffic</b> <b>regulations</b> are often rather hard to read and comprehend for the average person. In a time of globalization when more and more people live or travel abroad there is a growing need for a universal tool which would easily explain differences between the <b>traffic</b> <b>regulations</b> in various countries. Due to the internationality of such a tool, the choice of language represents a huge problem. In this paper we present DynEST, a unique software solution for this problem. DynEST explains <b>traffic</b> <b>regulations</b> without words, just using dynamic i. e. animated symbols. A simple yet powerful architecture of the software provides great flexibility for e. g. cross-comparing any two countries in the world. We hope that DynEST is a first step towards a European driving license and more security in traffic...|$|R
