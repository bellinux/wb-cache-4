5|$|With Misery we had {{the luxury}} of doing a two-day shoot, which is totally luxurious these days. And we got to do what we love the most, which is just fashion and making {{beautiful}} images, and not having any rules. It was very much on the fly. We went downtown to the abandoned Sears building; it’s all destroyed and creepy in <b>there.</b> <b>We</b> <b>were</b> there for two days and it was like an art project.|$|E
500|$|Likewise {{the first}} film, {{the film was}} shot in and around Vancouver Island.

It was advantageous to us on so many levels, that it was just the right place to go for this movie," [...] Perry stated as the reason for the film's production in British Columbia. British Columbia Highway 19 was utilized as Route 23. The Plaza of Nations was used as a stand-in for Ellis Medical Complex, the site of Tim's death.|$|E
500|$|... "Bass Down Low" [...] {{was written}} by Dev {{alongside}} the production duo The Cataracs. The duo also produced the song, and recorded it at The Indie-Pop Sweat Shop. It was later mixed by Manny Marroquin at Larrabee Studios and mastered by Tom Coyne at Sterling Sound in New York City. The song was originally conceived with Dev as a featured act, but she was later made the main artist as they believed it represented her. Dev described [...] "Bass Down Low" [...] as [...] "sassy and fun" [...] and considered it a great follow-up to [...] "Like a G6". In an interview with teen magazine Seventeen, she spoke of the song's conception, stating: [...] "We'd been in the studio writing some really bossy, fun stuff. We've got a studio in the loft {{that we live in}} together, so it was made in <b>there.</b> <b>We</b> <b>were</b> just kind of kickin' it and it came. There's one version where The Cataracs are just rapping on it, which I love as well." ...|$|E

500|$|The Task Force began {{night flight}} {{training}} using night vision goggles (NVG) to develop nighttime extraction capabilities; however, {{they were doing}} so with AN/PVS-5 NVGs which were originally developed for ground forces. Never before had anyone in the U.S. Department of Defense flown in NVGs and the Task Force quickly adapted the NVGs for flying and by Brown's own words [...] "a warrant officer figured out we could cut them apart and mount them to our helmets and increase our efficiency and safety by a huge margin. So <b>there</b> <b>we</b> <b>were,</b> without authority, cutting up goggles and building our own NVGs." [...] Their nighttime training took place at Dugway Proving Ground, Utah. As {{a result of the}} night vision goggle training Brown asserted in a 2011 interview that [...] "most of today's NVG tactics, techniques, and procedures as well as Black Hawk and Chinook modifications came directly from that mission." [...] Ultimately Operation Credible Sport did not come to fruition due to a peaceful resolution to the crisis where the hostages were released as a result of long negotiations.|$|E

"I {{wrote the}} initial idea for 'One Sweet Day' with Walter, and I had the chorus...and I stopped and said, 'I really wanna {{do this with}} Boyz II Men,' because...obviously I'm {{a big fan of}} theirs and I just thought that the work was crying out for them, the vocals that they do, so I put it away and said, 'Who knows if this could ever happen, but I just don't wanna finish this song because I want it to be our song if we ever do it together. [...] whole idea of when you lose people that are close to you, it changes your life and changes your perspective. When they came into the studio, I played them the idea for the song and when [...] was finished, they looked at each other, a bit stunned, and told me that Nathan [...] "Nate" [...] Morris had written a song for his road manager who had passed away. It had {{basically}} the same lyrics and fitted over the same chord changes. It was really, really weird, we finished the song right then and <b>there.</b> <b>We</b> <b>were</b> all kinda flipped about it ourselves. Fate {{had a lot to do}} with that. I know some people won't believe it, but we wouldn't make up such a crazy story." ...|$|E
2500|$|In February 1921, the U.S. Senate held {{hearings}} on war expenditures. During heated testimony, Dawes burst out, [...] "Hell and Maria, we weren't {{trying to keep}} a set of books over <b>there,</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> trying to win a war!"

A couple of years after that, Sussex were playing against Essex in a Championship game at Chelmsford, when our wicketkeeper, Rupert Webb got injured. <b>There</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> in the Chelmsford dressing room before the start of play and we suddenly realised we've got no wicketkeeper.

The officers behaved gallantly, in order to encourage their men, for which they suffered greatly, there being near sixty killed and wounded; {{a large proportion of the}} number we had." ...|$|E

2500|$|The 1987–88 season saw {{the club}} {{promoted}} to the First Division, then the highest tier of English league football, for the first time. Sheringham scored the first goal in Millwall's first home game in Division One. Millwall briefly topped {{the table at the}} start of October 1988 and the goals of Sheringham (15) and Cascarino (15) kept Millwall in the top four for most of the season before fading after Easter to finish in 10th position. Sheringham said in his autobiography: [...] "It was a crazy exhilarating time. <b>There</b> <b>we</b> <b>were,</b> little Millwall, in our first season in the First Division and topping the table until about March. Everybody said it couldn't last and of course it couldn't and it didn't, but we gave them all a good run for their money.

2500|$|Following the {{recording}} of Go, the band {{set out on the}} [...] "4 Albums. 2 Nights. 7 Cities" [...] tour, which found the band performing their past discography over two nights. During that time period, they searched for the label to release Go, which was being mixed at the time. Several labels were interested from samples the band sent them. Another plan the band had was to pay entirely for mastering and manufacturing, and to then find a distributor. The band took meetings with various label heads, including with Brett Gurewitz, former Bad Religion guitarist and head of Epitaph Records, where the band was signed from 2003 to 2008. It was clear from the first meeting that the band would return to their [...] "first home," [...] with Pierre noting that, [...] "We had always enjoyed working with [...] and we loved the people <b>there.</b> <b>We</b> <b>were</b> taking meetings, but once we were hanging out with Brett, we got right back into the swing of things." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dickson {{approached}} the five original members of The Byrds {{in order to}} have them sign a letter of permission to authorize the release of these early recordings. [...] David Crosby was initially reluctant to sanction the release but he was eventually persuaded by his friend and singing partner, Graham Nash, who convinced Crosby of the musical worth and historical value of the recordings. [...] Dickson later recalled Nash's involvement during a 1977 interview: [...] "Graham Nash said that the songs were charming baby pictures. You have to get a little older before you can tolerate seeing your baby pictures out <b>there.</b> <b>We</b> <b>were</b> all babies once! Graham just charmed David's socks off." [...] With the permission of all five original members of the band secured, Together Records released the album in July 1969 {{with a great deal of}} publicity. [...] As a collection of previously unreleased demo recordings, Preflyte can be seen as one of the earliest examples of issuing outtakes by popular artists, a practice that is now commonplace in the reissue market.|$|E
2500|$|Robinson {{had told}} Billboard {{that he had}} been {{lobbying}} for the Miracles since his own induction, [...] "making calls and signing petitions and everything, because they really deserve it." [...] Though some felt Robinson should've been included as an inductee with the other Miracles, Robinson said, [...] "I don't really even care about that. I'm already in there. I don't understand why it was, like, a task to get the Miracles in <b>there.</b> <b>We</b> <b>were</b> one of the hottest and most prolific groups in the world at that time, so I don't understand the hesitancy." [...] Claudette Robinson stated, [...] "When I spoke to (Rock and Roll Hall of Fame & Museum President and CEO) Terry Stewart, he said he got no less than 900 e-mails per day saying the Miracles should be inducted, and why aren't they? I was surprised by that. I would think five or 10, but he said that amount, so it's {{a lot of people that}} were really pulling for us. You have to be thankful and grateful for that." [...] However, before this decision, Miracle Marv Tarplin died in September 2011 at the age of 70, just months before the induction ceremony.|$|E
2500|$|Havins {{agreed with}} Riegel that the reveal scenes were exciting. [...] "I'm always {{up for a}} {{challenge}} and I work best under pressure," [...] she said. [...] "My competitive side kicks in. So the thought that I maybe couldn't do it made me be like, 'Oh, yeah, I'm doin' it!' We put so much preparation into it." [...] Justin Bruening (Jamie Martin) and Jacob Young (JR) were the only other cast members in the episode. [...] "...I worked with a private coach, we worked on it together.... We {{put a lot of}} time into this episode," [...] Havins stated. [...] "We usually don't have that luxury, but this time we did; this took priority. And shooting it, too, we knew it was a big deal." [...] She revealed that the producers and director were patient with them. [...] "And if we felt we didn't like where a take went, usually they're like, 'No, it's fine, let's move on,' but this time they were like, 'Let's do it again. We loved that take, girls, but let's try something else,' and we'd go in a totally different direction." [...] She said, [...] "They took the time and they were as invested in this episode as [...] and I were, so that was a really good feeling. We were all <b>there,</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> all in it together, and hopefully, the finished product shows it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Howard D. Griffin (1911-1986) {{purchased}} a boat dealership in 1936 {{while he was}} a student at what became the University of Louisiana at Monroe. By the 1960s, Griffin's company had become the largest outboard motor dealership in the world. He also sold motorcycles. From 1965 to 1985, Griffin and his wife, Birdie M. Griffin (1915-1985), operated their seasonal Land O' Toys store on South Grand Street in Monroe. The motto was [...] "Land O’ Toys; Loads of fun for girls and boys; Bring the kids and look around; The biggest toy deal in the town." [...] Once Christmas was over, the toy store was quickly phased out, and the outboard motors returned to the showroom. From her childhood memories, Sherry Lynn Mason recalls the Land O' Toys: [...] "I loved that store. Every time [...] took me <b>there,</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> waiting for his outboard motor to be fixed across the street. It was a magical place to me!” Amy Berry Baker recalls, [...] "It wasn't Christmas until we went to Howard Griffin ... magical for kids," [...] according to an article in The Monroe News-Star. Mrs. Griffin died December 15, 1985, and the store close permanently a few days after Christmas of that year. In March 2011, the remaining abandoned building burned. All that remains are the memories of the former customers, now all adults. Cheri Chadduck recalled, [...] "Memories are completely magical, and I am so grateful for my childhood recollections of time there." ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 18, 1971, Michigan {{defeated}} , 56–0, in {{the home}} opener before a crowd of 81,391 at Michigan Stadium. Michigan took a 35–0 lead at halftime and used its reserves extensively, including five quarterbacks and 11 running backs. [...] Michigan's offense was heavily skewed {{in favor of the}} ground game, with 83 rushing carries and only 10 passes. The Wolverine backs carried the ball 83 times and totaled 495 rushing yards, including 107 yards by Ed Shuttlesworth and 89 yards, all in the first half, by Billy Taylor. Michigan scored seven rushing touchdowns, two each by Taylor and Alan Walker and one each by Shuttlesworth, Bob Thornbladh and Fritz Seyferth. Michigan's eighth touchdown was scored by Dave Elliott, the son of former Michigan player Pete Elliott, who fell on the ball after a Michigan kickoff was not fielded by Virginia as it made its way into the end zone. Kevin Casey started his second game at quarterback and completed two of five passes for 43 yards. Virginia completed only one pass and threw three interceptions. In total offense, Michigan out-gained Virginia, 566 yards to 78 yards. After the game, Virginia coach Don Lawrence praised Michigan's running backs: [...] "Those are the best six running backs I've ever seen together. We were there, but we just got knocked down." [...] Coach Schembechler opined, [...] "There's not much to say, is <b>there?</b> <b>We</b> <b>were</b> bigger and stronger physically than they were." ...|$|E
