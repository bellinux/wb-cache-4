5|$|Each {{state was}} allowed to cast a single vote either for or against a {{proposal}} during <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> {{in accordance with the}} majority opinion of the state's delegates. Throughout the Convention, delegates would regularly come and go, with only 30–40 being present on a typical day. Consequently, if a state's delegates were equally divided in their views on a given proposal, or if too few of the state's delegates were in attendance to establish a quorum for the delegation when votes were being cast on a particular proposal, that state's delegation had essentially no effect on the outcome of the vote on the proposal. Thus, for example, after two of New York's three delegates abandoned the Convention in mid July with no intention of returning, New York was left unable to vote on any further proposals at the Convention, although Hamilton would continue to periodically attend and occasionally to speak during <b>the</b> <b>debates.</b>|$|E
5|$|In July 2010, the {{citizens}} of Guangzhou opposed the proposal suggested by the city committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) to use Mandarin more in television news programmes, rather than Guangzhou's main language, Cantonese. <b>The</b> <b>debates</b> eventually led {{to a series of}} public protests.|$|E
5|$|The Analytical Review {{was meant}} to {{enlighten}} the public {{as well as to}} simplify communication between authors separated by great distances; most importantly, <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> between those authors could be read by the public. In granting authors a public forum in which to communicate, periodicals such as the Analytical helped to define authorship—they encouraged the professionalization of writing and granted prestige to writers and journalists.|$|E
5000|$|In Denver on October 3, {{the date}} of <b>the</b> first presidential <b>debate,</b> Stein and Occupy Denver marched in protest of third parties being left out of <b>the</b> <b>debate.</b> During <b>the</b> <b>debate,</b> Stein {{appeared}} on Democracy Now! to offer her own responses to the questions asked. After <b>the</b> <b>debate,</b> Stein and Honkala hosted an [...] "After <b>the</b> <b>Debate</b> Party" [...] at the Mercury Cafe in Denver where they addressed the crowd about <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> and <b>the</b> campaign.|$|R
25|$|Criteria for {{inclusion}} in <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> did not allow several other candidates, or potential candidates, to participate in <b>the</b> <b>debate,</b> including Buddy Roemer and Fred Karger, who {{did not meet the}} polling criterion of at least 1% in 5 national polls. Mitt Romney met <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> criteria, but rejected the invitation to appear in <b>the</b> <b>debate.</b> Newt Gingrich originally had planned to attend <b>the</b> <b>debate,</b> but did not meet additional criteria of forming an exploratory committee.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> second presidential <b>debate</b> {{was held}} on 13 February 2016 at the Serena hotel. Unlike <b>the</b> first <b>debate,</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> was {{attended}} by President Museveni. All eight candidates appeared at <b>the</b> <b>debate,</b> although Joseph Mabirizi arrived at <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> late. <b>The</b> <b>debate</b> was moderated by Dr. Shaka Ssali, who is a host of VOA's Straight Talk Africa, Dr. Joel Serunkuma Kibazo, the director of communications and external relations at the African Development Bank, and Dr. Suzie Muwanga, the head of political science and public administration at Makerere University. Foreign policy, national security and the economy were at the centre of <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> topics.|$|R
5|$|The {{first of}} three 2012 presidential {{election}} debates took place on October 3, in Denver. Media figures and political analysts widely viewed Romney as having delivered a stronger and more focused presentation than did President Obama. That initial debate overshadowed Obama's improved presentation {{in the last two}} debates later in October, and Romney maintained a small advantage in <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> when seen as a whole.|$|E
5|$|The {{memorials}} to World War I {{were frequently}} politicised, either by <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> over their construction and design, {{or by the}} symbolism incorporated into them. Even where {{attempts were made to}} ensure political neutrality, as in France where the inscriptions on memorials were usually deliberately neutral, avoiding political controversy, national politics influenced the symbolism and messages incorporated into the memorials.|$|E
5|$|While Biden's presidential {{campaign}} {{did not last}} beyond the first caucuses, he created a favorable impression during <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> and increased his stature among Washington politicos. In particular, Barack Obama changed his opinion of Biden, liking how he had handled himself at campaign stops and appreciating his appeal to working class voters.|$|E
5000|$|Tian hosted <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> of Salt and Iron in {{the sixth}} year of Shiyuan(81 BC). During <b>the</b> <b>debate,</b> Tian kept his silence without uttering a word. He was later criticized by Huan Kuan, the {{recorder}} of <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> for being extremely evasive. However, without further judgements, {{it can be said}} that Tian maintained his neutrality during <b>the</b> <b>debate.</b>|$|R
2500|$|CNN {{was criticized}} for not {{revealing}} during <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> that Keith Kerr, an openly gay military general who had submitted a question and spoke during <b>the</b> <b>debate,</b> was on a campaign advisory organization supporting Hillary Clinton. [...] CNN cut the question and candidate response in the subsequent airing of <b>the</b> <b>debate.</b> LA Times editorial writer Tim Rutten criticized CNN's handling of <b>the</b> <b>debate,</b> calling <b>the</b> network [...] "corrupt" [...] and accusing it of focusing <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> on immigration to benefit Lou Dobbs' ratings.|$|R
5000|$|A {{spokesman}} said <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> would exclude Sarvis for [...] "no other {{reason other than}} our tradition to provide a forum for the two major-party candidates." [...] Sarvis attended <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> and his campaign debuted a television ad, which aired in Northern Virginia. The Sarvis ad caused Peter Galuszka of The Washington Post to say Sarvis [...] "won" [...] <b>the</b> <b>debate.</b> Five days after <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> moderator Chuck Todd invited Sarvis onto his show, The Daily Rundown, and asked Sarvis questions from <b>the</b> <b>debate.</b>|$|R
5|$|Agagianian {{sat on the}} Board of Presidency of the Second Vatican Council (Vatican II), {{which took}} place from 1962 to 1965. He was {{appointed}} by Pope Paul VI {{as one of the}} four moderators who directed the course of <b>the</b> <b>debates,</b> along with Leo Joseph Suenens, Julius Döpfner, and Giacomo Lercaro. Agagianian {{was the only one of}} these four from the Curia, and represented the Eastern Catholic Churches. He had a special role in the preparation of the missionary decree Ad gentes and Gaudium et spes, the Constitution on the Church in the Modern World.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} post-Soviet states, {{the change in}} writing system and <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> {{surrounding}} it is closely intertwined with political themes. Although not having been used since the adoption of Cyrillic, the Latin script is supported by {{those who wish to}} bring the country closer to Uzbekistan, which has adopted the Latin-based Uzbek alphabet. The Persian alphabet is supported by the devoutly religious, Islamists, and by those who wish to bring the country closer to Iran and their Persian heritage. As the de facto standard, the Cyrillic alphabet is generally supported by those who wish to maintain the status quo, and not distance the country from Russia.|$|E
5|$|By early July, Butler had {{realized}} {{the futility of}} his race, and took to ignoring Tillman in his speeches, which the governor reciprocated, taking much of the drama from <b>the</b> <b>debates.</b> The two men even rode in the same carriage on July 4. Nevertheless, Butler refused to surrender, even after the primary for the legislature was overwhelmingly won by the Tillmanites, threatening action in the courts and an election contest before the Senate. On December 11, 1894, Benjamin Tillman {{was elected to the}} Senate by the new legislature with 131 votes. Butler received 21 and three votes were scattered.|$|E

5000|$|Both {{before and}} after <b>the</b> <b>debate,</b> {{commentators}} said <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> was focused on Sanders and his voting record on gun control and slights against President Obama, among other issues. During <b>the</b> <b>debate,</b> O'Malley interrupted to take 30 seconds to talk about [...] "homeland security and preparedness". Also during <b>the</b> <b>debate,</b> Clinton and Sanders had some back-and-forth exchanges to define themselves on Wall Street, foreign policy, and gun control.|$|R
50|$|Roxas {{said that}} {{there should have been}} more time for {{candidates}} to express their views, saying each candidate was only given about 15 minutes. Duterte had previously threatened to walk out from <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> if he was not given enough time to express his views. After <b>the</b> <b>debate,</b> Duterte reportedly requested the GMA hosts to extend <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> for almost two more hours, until 9pm. Liberal Party campaign spokesman Miro Quimbo compared <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> to Twitter, where messages are short. Binay, Poe, and Santiago were reportedly unsatisfied in regards to the time allotted to them in <b>the</b> <b>debate.</b>|$|R
5|$|By {{the time}} <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> and {{legislative}} maneuvering {{that went into}} crafting the Bill of Rights amendments was done, many personal opinions had shifted. A number of Federalists came out in support, thus silencing the Anti-Federalists' most effective critique. Many Anti-Federalists, in contrast, were now opposed, realizing that Congressional approval of these amendments would greatly lessen {{the chances of a}} second constitutional convention. Anti-Federalists such as Richard Henry Lee also argued that the Bill left the most objectionable portions of the Constitution, such as the federal judiciary and direct taxation, intact.|$|E
5|$|During {{and after}} <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> over church government, the Assembly framed other {{documents}} {{which did not}} cause open rifts. The Directory for Public Worship, which was to replace the Book of Common Prayer, was swiftly written in 1644 and passed by Parliament on 3January 1645. The Directory, accepted by the Scots as well, took a middle course between the presbyterians and congregationalists. The presbyterians {{for the most part}} preferred a fixed liturgy while congregationalists favoured extemporaneous prayer. The Directory consisted of an order for services with sample prayers. The Assembly also recommended a psalter, translated by Francis Rous for use in worship.|$|E
5|$|For twenty years, Americans {{had been}} bitterly divided over the nation's {{monetary}} standard. The gold standard, which the United States had effectively been on since 1873, limited {{the money supply}} but eased trade with other nations, such as the United Kingdom, whose currency was also based on gold. Many Americans, however, believed that bimetallism (making both gold and silver legal tender) was necessary for the nation's economic health. The financial Panic of 1893 intensified <b>the</b> <b>debates,</b> and when Democratic President Grover Cleveland continued to support the gold standard against the will of much of his party, activists became determined {{to take over the}} Democratic Party organization and nominate a silver-supporting candidate in 1896.|$|E
50|$|The {{day before}} <b>the</b> <b>debate,</b> November 13, {{was the day}} of the November 2015 Paris attacks, where nearly 130 civilians were killed by radical Jihadist terrorists - specifically, members of ISIS - across the city of Paris. As a result of the attacks, after initial {{speculation}} that <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> might be cancelled, CBS announced that, while <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> would go on as planned, the focus of <b>the</b> <b>debate's</b> content would be dramatically shifted over to foreign policy and terrorism. In addition, a moment of silence was held at the beginning of <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> in memory of the victims.|$|R

Iglesias and Rivera were not invited to <b>the</b> <b>debate,</b> with only Rajoy and Sánchez participating. The audience for <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> averaged 9.7 million.

50|$|Reflex {{magazine}} called <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> a tie. Marketing expert Tomáš Jindříšek praised performances of both candidates as outstanding but concluded that Zeman narrowly won <b>the</b> <b>debate.</b> Sanep agency held a poll {{according to which}} Zeman decisively won <b>the</b> <b>debate.</b> 54.5% of viewers voted for him while only 12.4% voted that Fischer won. 90.7% of people who plan to vote for either of candidates admitted that <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> influenced them in favor of Miloš Zeman.|$|R
5|$|In 1857, Deady {{was elected}} as a {{delegate}} to the Oregon Constitutional Convention. The convention {{was held in the}} territorial capital of Salem to prepare the territory for statehood. He became president of the body and was influential in shaping the new state constitution, which outlawed slavery but excluded African-Americans from settling in the new state. Deady successfully advocated for provisions in the document to set six-year terms for judges, four-year terms for state officers, and biennial sessions for the legislature. He also led the southern party, which opposed state education in all forms. During <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> Deady also advocated for discrimination towards Chinese immigrants and Blacks, as well as in favor for slavery in Oregon.|$|E
5|$|John Stuart Mill was {{impressed}} by remarks criticising English society that Wallace had included in The Malay Archipelago. Mill asked him to join the general committee of his Land Tenure Reform Association, but the association dissolved after Mill's death in 1873. Wallace had written {{only a handful of}} articles on political and social issues between 1873 and 1879 when, at the age of 56, he entered <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> over trade policy and land reform in earnest. He believed that rural land should be owned by the state and leased to people who would make whatever use of it that would benefit the largest number of people, thus breaking the often-abused power of wealthy landowners in British society.|$|E
5|$|Johnson was {{not invited}} to {{participate}} in the presidential debates because he did not meet the criteria of 15% support in five polls set by the Commission on Presidential Debates. In 2015, Johnson and Green Party nominee Jill Stein filed a lawsuit against the commission, arguing that the commission and its rules violated antitrust law and the First Amendment. In August 2016, the lawsuit was dismissed. Johnson's poll numbers have been averaging between 7 and 9 percent. Johnson's campaign manager Ron Nielson argued for Johnson's inclusion, citing Ross Perot's admission to <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> in the 1992 debates, when Perot was polling at 8 percent.|$|E
50|$|In 1985, Dr. Gary Habermas and Antony Flew <b>debated</b> <b>the</b> {{question}} of Jesus' resurrection as a literal and historical/physical event, before {{a crowd of}} 3000 people. Five philosophers and five professional <b>debate</b> judges judged <b>the</b> <b>debate.</b> Of <b>the</b> philosophers who judged {{on the content of}} <b>the</b> <b>debate,</b> four voted that Habermas won and the other was undecided. Of <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> judges who voted on debate technique, three voted for Habermas while two voted for Flew. <b>The</b> <b>debate</b> was published as a book under the title Did Jesus Rise from the Dead? <b>The</b> Resurrection <b>Debate</b> (Harper & Row).|$|R

5|$|Blankett and Elphinstone united off the Cape on 10 June 1795 and {{anchored}} in Simon's Bay. There messages {{were sent to}} Sluysken offering an alliance against the French. The Dutch governor was inclined to resist however, evacuating the civilian population from Simon's Town in early July and making preparations to raze the town. To prevent this, Craig landed 800 soldiers and Royal Marines on 14 July, who occupied Simon's Town while the Dutch withdrew to the pass at Muizenberg, through which passed the road to Cape Town. For the next month the two armies observed an uneasy truce, broken by occasional patrols and sniping. During this period, Elphinstone and Sluysken continued negotiations for the surrender of the colony. These negotiations were stalled by disputes in the colonial government regarding {{the legitimacy of the}} deposed William of Orange and suspicion concerning British intentions. While <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> continued, British envoys were permitted free movement in Cape Town, making detailed observations of the defences.|$|E
5|$|Both Block 37 and The Mills Corporation have {{histories}} of financial difficulties. Block 37 had been demolished in 1989 for a hotly contested redevelopment plan under the then new Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley. <b>The</b> <b>debates</b> included {{the demolition of}} the Chicago Landmark McCarthy Building, which proceeded after the Illinois Supreme Court decided private preservation groups did not have standing to challenge the city's decision. Once the site was cleared, the initial redevelopment plan fell through, as did several subsequent plans, leaving the block vacant and undeveloped for nearly a generation. The Mills Corporation has itself been in financial difficulty in the past. This reputation and changing financial climate caused a delay in 2006 as contractors feared not getting paid. During the construction, cost overruns and delays have forced the city of Chicago and the Chicago Transit Authority {{to make up for}} a shortfall of over $100million. In November 2009, the developer was declared in default and CB Richard Ellis was named receiver.|$|E
5|$|In 1801, when Breckinridge was 12 years old, {{his father}} {{was elected to the}} U.S. Senate. The family moved to Bedford County, Virginia, where they lived with {{relatives}} in order to be closer to the elder Breckinridge during the congressional session at Washington, D.C.. While there, Cabell Breckinridge attended New London Academy (now Colby–Sawyer College). A case of measles prevented him from attending William and Mary College (now College of William & Mary), his father's alma mater, where his cousin, future Congressman James Breckinridge, was enrolled. In 1803, he accompanied his father to the capital where he witnessed <b>the</b> <b>debates</b> over the Louisiana Purchase before returning to college in October. After Congress adjourned in March, John Breckinridge met his son in Virginia, and they arrived back at Cabell's Dale, the family estate near Lexington, on April 18, 1804. He did not return to Virginia with his father in late 1804, instead pursuing preparatory studies under Colonel Samuel Wilson in advance of his enrollment at the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University).|$|E
