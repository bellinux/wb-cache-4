The same month, the Singapore government enlisted Airbus Group to help local maintenance, repair, and operations providers <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>competitive</b> against neighbour countries like Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines which are cheaper. To improve productivity, Airbus Group launches, in October 2016, a testbed hangar where new technologies can be tested. Upon entering the hangar, cameras study the aircraft to detect damages.

5|$|Following the public's {{positive}} {{reaction to the}} graphics of the Final Fantasy VII Technical Demo for PS3 presented at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in 2005, {{it was decided to}} release the role-playing video game Final Fantasy XIII on the PlayStation 3 rather than the PlayStation 2 as originally planned. In August 2005, the Technology Division began working on the White Engine, a PlayStation 3 engine {{that was supposed to be}} exclusively used for Final Fantasy XIII. Eight months later, however, it was decided to repurpose the engine to further make it compatible with other projects such as the action RPG Final Fantasy Versus XIII (later rebranded and repurposed into Final Fantasy XV) and the massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) Final Fantasy XIV. In order for the company <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>competitive</b> in a multi-platform environment, support of the engine was extended from the PlayStation 3 to the Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows, both of which were successful in Western markets. This marked the official development start of a company-wide engine for whose purpose the Technology Division was expanded into the Research and Development Division in September 2006. Murata remained the division's general manager with a full-time staff at his disposal.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, the {{management}} of Braathens SAFE decided that it needed larger aircraft if the company was <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>competitive</b> on charter flights. Larger aircraft could be put into service on the main services from Oslo, Gothenburg and Stockholm, while the 737s {{could be used to}} smaller destination and from other cities. On 25 February 1980, the company announced that it had ordered two Boeing 767-200 planes, with an option for two addition craft. The cost of the two firm orders was about NOK500 million. This would allow the aircraft to be used for both domestic scheduled flights and for charter, and was configured with 242 seats. This was less than charter-only airlines, for instance Britannia had their planes configured with 273 seats. Braathens SAFE's planes were delivered on 23 March and in November 1984. The following year showed increasing charter traffic, although it only made up 25% of the company's revenue. The company had considered the smaller Boeing 757, but did not have sufficient range. Also the Airbus A310 was close to being chosen.|$|E

5|$|The current club {{ownership}} {{have stated}} that a larger stadium is necessary in order for Chelsea <b>to</b> <b>stay</b> <b>competitive</b> with rival clubs who have significantly larger stadia, such as Arsenal and Manchester United. Owing to its location next to a main road and two railway lines, fans can only enter the ground via the Fulham Road exits, which places constraints on expansion due to health and safety regulations. The club have consistently affirmed their desire to keep Chelsea at their current home, but have nonetheless been linked with a move to various nearby sites, including the Earls Court Exhibition Centre, Battersea Power Station and the Chelsea Barracks. In October 2011, a proposal from the club to buy back the freehold to the land on which Stamford Bridge sits was voted down by Chelsea Pitch Owners shareholders. In May 2012, the club made a formal bid to purchase Battersea Power Station, {{with a view to}} developing the site into a new stadium, but lost out to a Malaysian consortium.

By 1845, tolls on the Little Eaton line were less than half what they had been five years earlier. The Derby and Gainsborough Company wanted to buy the Little Eaton line in 1846, and were quoted £30,000, as were the Midland Railway in 1847.

A company farm was also established. St Chad's Chapel and the vicarage were commissioned by Charles Paget in 1876. The Chapel was opened in 1881, but was reputedly built in 1861 at Stuffynwood, Derbyshire, and later moved to its present site.

40|$|Abstract: Quite {{often in}} the {{industrial}} environment engineers are required to justify the addition or change of equipment when companies venture into investing in capital to increase production capacity or improve efficiency. Aged and outdated machinery and equipment are at times not economical to re-fabricate due to the improvement in manufacturing methods and obsolescence of old technology. Maintenance of machinery is often not done {{as it should be}} to achieve optimum availability where policies don’t exist. Technological improvement has resulted in less robust, advanced and often more complex designs where modern technology replaces older designs making the old designs more expensive to produce in some cases. As a consequence the re-fabrication of old equipment becomes difficult to justify with the high cost. The maintenance cost of previous equipment also does not compare to modern equipment and negatively affects the competitiveness of organisations against their peers that utilize modern methods. The solution <b>to</b> <b>staying</b> <b>competitive</b> is <b>to</b> re-design, upgrade equipment, change maintenance policy or introduce technology. This research will highlight methods that can be utilized to ensure that the reliability and availability of equipment remains at an acceptable level and also show evidence of improvement in reliability of equipment due to re-design and through continuous improvement initiatives at Everite Building Products a manufacturer of fibre cement products.

For Fog’s End, efficiency is key <b>to</b> <b>staying</b> <b>competitive.</b> In this project the efficiency of energy in vs product out will be calculated. While collecting this data the price/bottle for energy will be determined and used for an assembly cost. To determine the efficiency the fuel usage will be recorded for several distillation trials. The mash contents and product contents will all be measured and calculations will be performed to find the theoretical amount of energy required to heat up the mash and to evaporate the products collected. For sensible heat the equation =Δ will be used, and for latent heat the equation =± will be used. This project will not take into consideration many of the small factors that affect efficiency, such as burner efficiency, radiant heat loss, or energy loss from cooling water. 17 trials were conducted and it was found the average efficiency was 23. 8 % and the average cost/bottle for energy was $ 0. 76. There are many small factors that affect the efficiency, with more testing the most inefficient component could be isolated and adjusted. Monetary limitations prevent acquiring a larger and more efficient still. Energy cost/bottle will help Fog’s End distribute manufacturing costs properly...|$|R
