5|$|On April 22, 1992, {{less than}} a year after her kidnapping, a man called the Contra Costa County Sheriff's Department from a gas station less than two miles from the Garridos' home. <b>The</b> <b>caller</b> {{reported}} that he saw Dugard in the gas station staring intently at a missing child poster of herself. <b>The</b> <b>caller</b> then reported seeing her leave in a large yellow van, possibly a Dodge. In 2009, after Dugard's release, an old yellow Dodge van was recovered from the Garrido property that matched the description of the van given in the call. The license plate was not reported in the 1992 call; <b>the</b> <b>caller,</b> the girl, and the van were gone by the time police arrived. <b>The</b> <b>caller</b> never identified himself, and the police did not pursue the matter any further. In contradiction to this story, Dugard reported that she never left the Garrido property from the day she was kidnapped until shortly before her first child was born in August 1994.|$|E
5|$|The app {{displays}} {{information on}} callers, {{such as their}} latest social media posts, local weather at the caller's location and the identity of <b>the</b> <b>caller.</b> It originally {{had the ability to}} display information on callers, such as their latest social media posts, local weather at the caller's location and the identity of <b>the</b> <b>caller.</b> The ability for consumers to add themselves to the directory was added in the summer of 2009 and being able to edit existing entries was added that October.|$|E
5|$|In a {{telephone}} network, <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> {{is connected to}} the person they want to talk to by switches at various telephone exchanges. The switches form an electrical connection between the two users and the setting of these switches is determined electronically when <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> dials the number. Once the connection is made, the caller's voice is transformed to an electrical signal using a small microphone in the caller's handset. This electrical signal is then sent through the network to the user at the other end where it is transformed back into sound by a small speaker in that person's handset.|$|E
5000|$|Kramer Makes the Call - A weekly {{segment on}} Wednesdays with Attorney Steven Kramer. Two callers with a legal dispute, usually a divorce or family law related issue, each present their case by phone. Then Kramer tells <b>the</b> <b>callers</b> what a judge might {{do in their}} case. <b>The</b> <b>callers</b> receive a free {{mediation}} session.|$|R

5|$|Sridhar's {{computer}} data {{reveals a}} code, which when deciphered reveals Bhaskaran's phone number. Vidya calls Bhaskaran {{to tell him}} that she has retrieved sensitive documents from Sridhar's office. She asks Bhaskaran to help find her husband in exchange for the documents, but Bhaskaran tells her to contact the local police. Vidya soon gets a call from an unknown number however, warning her that she should hand over the documents to <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> if she wishes to see her husband alive. Khan thinks <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> is Milan Damji.|$|E
5|$|Jokes {{from earlier}} scripts were used. In one scene, Carla Tortelli orders a phone caller to do {{something}} about their unruly children. When one of the bartenders suggests hiring a babysitter, Carla replied that <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> was the babysitter. The cast did not know the ending of the pilot episode during production, since the final draft of the script was dated April 16, 1982.|$|E
5|$|The {{story begins}} {{three weeks after}} OCD {{received}} the package. Still unable to decode its meaning, the record company receives {{a phone call from}} an unknown source, tracked to Los Angeles, New York, Australia and Saturn. <b>The</b> <b>caller</b> claims to have received the same package five years ago and that it had brought destruction and chaos upon his society, and warns that they are coming after Octagon.|$|E
50|$|Basically a {{look into}} <b>the</b> <b>caller's</b> future with <b>the</b> {{use of a}} medium.|$|R
50|$|Another {{feature of}} his show was the sports trivia quiz show Sports or Consequences which ran during the 4:00 hour during his {{afternoon}} show on 700 WLW. The show was unusual in that <b>the</b> <b>callers</b> asked <b>the</b> hosts (Burbank and his supporting cast, plus {{a number of}} other WLW on air personalities) sports trivia questions, instead of the hosts asking <b>the</b> <b>callers</b> questions.|$|R
60|$|Violet got up. All <b>the</b> <b>callers</b> were gone, and {{she swept}} in to Mrs. Hill dramatically.|$|R
5|$|In August 2013 Whitepages {{purchased}} all {{the interests}} in the company owned by investors for $80 million. In 2015, WhitePages acquired San Francisco-based NumberCorp to improve the database of phone numbers used for scams in <b>the</b> <b>Caller</b> ID app. In April 2016, Whitepages spun-off its caller ID business into a separate company called Hiya {{with a staff of}} 40 in Seattle. In September 2016, Alex Algard stepped down as CEO of WhitePages, in order to focus on the mobile spam-blocking spin-off Hiya. He appointed Rob Eleveld as the new WhitePages CEO.|$|E
5|$|Several {{types of}} cricket songs {{are in the}} {{repertoire}} of some species. The calling song attracts females and repels other males, and is fairly loud. The courting song is used when a female cricket is near and encourages her to mate with <b>the</b> <b>caller.</b> A triumphal song is produced {{for a brief period}} after a successful mating, and may reinforce the mating bond to encourage the female to lay some eggs rather than find another male. An aggressive song is triggered by contact chemoreceptors on the antennae that detect the presence of another male cricket.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} being fired, Savage apologized {{on his radio}} program and on his website. He {{explained}} that he believed that MSNBC had gone to commercial to cover the gaffe of the attempted sabotage by a prank caller {{and that he was}} off the air {{at the time of the}} offensive comments, despite the fact that clips of the segment show Savage going to commercial after he made the comments. He also said his remarks were meant only to insult <b>the</b> <b>caller,</b> not all people with AIDS.|$|E
5000|$|Executing the [...] command {{within a}} script or batch file also has {{different}} effects in different operating systems. In DOS, <b>the</b> <b>caller's</b> current directory {{can be directly}} altered by the batch file's use of this command. In Unix, <b>the</b> <b>caller's</b> current directory is not altered by the script's invocation of the [...] command. This is because in Unix, the script is usually executed within a subshell.|$|R
5000|$|For call-in talk shows, {{screeners}} {{determine the}} air quality of the call (good connection or not) and if <b>the</b> <b>caller's</b> comments will further the topic or add a new point. Their job {{is to put the}} best calls on the air and filter out <b>the</b> <b>callers</b> that don't have anything worthwhile to add to the conversation. They also try to engage callers by acting as a [...] "warm up" [...] act for the host. Call screeners also typically provide a summary of pertinent information for the host or hosts to provide context for on air interaction, such as <b>the</b> <b>caller's</b> name, age, gender, location and a precis of what they intend to talk about.|$|R
50|$|Inbound sales {{enquiries}} can be relayed automatically to {{the regional}} sales manager appropriate for <b>the</b> <b>caller’s</b> location.|$|R
5|$|While {{the social}} {{organisation}} of the red-headed myzomela is relatively unknown, {{it is reported}} as being usually solitary or found in pairs, though it {{has been described as}} forming loose associations with brown honeyeaters, and other mangrove-feeding birds such as the northern fantail and yellow white-eye. It is an inquisitive bird and readily responds to pishing, coming close to <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> to investigate the source of the sound and to warn off the intruder. It calls throughout the day when feeding, and males sing from exposed branches in the upper canopy of the food trees.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, George thinks Liz {{is breaking}} the rules by taking a personal call; he gets angry and wrestles the handset from her. Later, Andy is upset that he listened to Chloe in her final moments, and Liz, {{who has made a}} complaint about George's conduct, tells him that she took a call from an ex-soldier, in tears because his mother committed suicide following the death of her cat. Andy realises that the man's mother is <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> from the previous night. George advises that Andy will not face any repercussions, and asks Andy to help Michael, new to the centre, with his first call. Chloe calls in and speaks to Michael, again claiming that she has taken an overdose. Andy snatches the phone and shouts at Chloe, hanging up on her.|$|E
5|$|At about 9:20am on Saturday 15 June 1996, the Ford van {{was parked}} on Corporation Street, outside the Marks & Spencer store, near the Arndale Centre. After setting the bomb's timer, two men – wearing hooded jackets, {{baseball}} caps and sunglasses – left {{the vehicle and}} walked to Cathedral Street, where a third man picked {{them up in the}} Ford Granada. The truck had been parked on double yellow lines with its hazard lights flashing. Within three minutes a traffic warden had issued the vehicle with a parking ticket and called for its removal. At about 9:40am, Granada Studios on Quay Street received a telephone call claiming that there was a bomb at the corner of Corporation Street and Cannon Street and that it would explode in one hour. <b>The</b> <b>caller</b> had an Irish accent and gave an IRA codeword so that police would know the threat was genuine. Four other telephoned warnings were sent to television/radio stations, newspapers and a hospital.|$|E

50|$|The pricing {{structure}} for UK directory enquiries was reformed by Ofcom on 1 July 2015. Call charges consist of an Access Charge and a Service Charge. The Access Charge is set and retained by <b>the</b> <b>caller's</b> landline or mobile provider. The Service Charge is {{set by the}} directory enquiries service but it is collected by <b>the</b> <b>caller's</b> phone provider and then {{passed on to the}} directory enquiries service.|$|R
50|$|The 1991 short {{television}} programme Night Caller followed <b>the</b> <b>callers</b> to Clive's through-the-night show. The programme {{is available on}} YouTube.|$|R

25|$|Allows <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> {{to ask the}} {{container}} to insert its menu items in an empty menu that will become the cooperative menu. Also allows <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> to ask {{the container}} to show or hide this menu, to show or hide dialog boxes, and to process accelerator keys received by the contained object intended for the container.|$|E
25|$|Long {{distance}} service (non-taxable):Long distance {{service is}} telephonic quality communication with persons whose telephones {{are outside the}} local telephone system of <b>the</b> <b>caller.</b>|$|E
5000|$|For example, a Data Access API such as [...] can be tuned {{differently}} {{depending on}} <b>the</b> <b>callers</b> of <b>the</b> method.|$|R
60|$|In {{half an hour}} most of <b>the</b> <b>callers</b> {{took their}} departure, then the marshal called Ronald into an inner room.|$|R
50|$|In the beginning, {{the hosts}} were hostile to callers that had differing opinions. The show seems, however, to be {{learning}} {{to harness the}} humor in other viewpoints and make callers feel more welcome. Treatment of callers varies with Patrick's mood and how eloquent or interesting <b>the</b> <b>callers</b> as a whole have been; Patrick {{has been known to}} shut down the live feed altogether if <b>the</b> <b>callers</b> have been particularly detrimental to the show's flow.|$|R
25|$|This {{interface}} allows <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> {{to obtain}} information on the container and location of an object, as well requesting that the object be saved, resized, shown, hidden, et cetera.|$|E
25|$|Allows <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> {{to ask for}} {{the object}} on this site to be {{activated}} immediately. If this interface is implemented, IOleClientSite, IOleInPlaceSite and IAdviseSink must be implemented as well.|$|E
25|$|A {{disinfector}} {{works on}} the side as a secretary for three call girls. While disinfecting, he receives a call, but <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> hangs up. While walking on the sidewalk, a payphone rings, but <b>the</b> <b>caller</b> also hangs up. He calls one of the business cards which propositions a date and pays a pimp. He discovers that the women {{is one of the}} call girls called Naomi who he had a crush on. Instead of having sex with her, he opens his disinfecting bag, causing her to leave. He receives a call for Naomi and cleans the handset instead.|$|E
50|$|Task ports {{can now be}} {{declared}} ref. A reference gives the task body {{direct access to the}} source arguments. in <b>the</b> <b>caller's</b> scope. Since it is operating on the original variable itself, rather than a copy of the argument's value, the task/function can modify variables (but not nets) in <b>the</b> <b>caller's</b> scope in realtime. The inout/output port-declarations pass variables by value, and defer updating the caller-scope variable until the moment the task exits.|$|R
50|$|In addition, US {{toll-free}} numbers may {{be accessed}} {{free of charge}} regardless of <b>the</b> <b>caller's</b> location by some IP telephone services.|$|R
2500|$|In {{many parts}} of the world, an {{emergency}} service can identify the telephone number that a call has been placed from. This is normally done using the system that the telephone company uses to bill calls, making the number visible even for users who have unlisted numbers or who block caller ID. For an individual fixed landline telephone, <b>the</b> <b>caller's</b> number can often be associated with <b>the</b> <b>caller's</b> address and therefore their location. However, with mobile phones and business telephones, the address may be a mailing address rather than <b>the</b> <b>caller's</b> location. <b>The</b> latest [...] "enhanced" [...] systems, such as Enhanced 911, are able to provide the address the cell phone tower a mobile telephone is bouncing off of. This is often specifically mandated in a country's legislation.|$|R
