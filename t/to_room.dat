5|$|Americium is {{paramagnetic}} {{in a wide}} temperature range, {{from that}} of liquid helium, <b>to</b> <b>room</b> temperature and above. This behavior is markedly {{different from that of}} its neighbor curium which exhibits antiferromagnetic transition at 52K. The thermal expansion coefficient of americium is slightly anisotropic and amounts to (7.5± 0.2)/°C along the shorter a axis and (6.2± 0.4)/°C for the longer c hexagonal axis. The enthalpy of dissolution of americium metal in hydrochloric acid at standard conditions is −620.6± 1.3kJ/mol, from which the standard enthalpy change of formation (ΔfH°) of aqueous Am3+ ion is −621.2± 2.0kJ/mol−1. The standard potential Am3+/Am0 is −2.08 ± 0.01V.|$|E
5|$|In {{accordance}} with magnetic data, electrical resistivity of curium increases with temperature – about twice between 4 and 60 K – and then remains nearly constant up <b>to</b> <b>room</b> temperature. There {{is a significant}} increase in resistivity over time (about 10 µΩ·cm/h) due to self-damage of the crystal lattice by alpha radiation. This makes uncertain the absolute resistivity value for curium (about 125 µΩ·cm). The resistivity of curium {{is similar to that of}} gadolinium and of the actinides plutonium and neptunium, but is significantly higher than that of americium, uranium, polonium and thorium.|$|E
5|$|Rhodocene {{itself is}} then formed by {{reduction}} of rhodocenium salts with molten sodium. If a rhodocenium containing melt is treated with sodium or potassium metals and then sublimed onto a liquid nitrogen-cooled cold finger, a black polycrystalline material results. Warming this material <b>to</b> <b>room</b> temperature produces a yellow solid which has been confirmed as the rhodocene dimer. A similar method {{can be used to}} prepare the iridocene dimer.|$|E

5|$|The {{safety issues}} for {{cryogenic}} helium {{are similar to}} those of liquid nitrogen; its extremely low temperatures can result in cold burns, and the liquid-to-gas expansion ratio can cause explosions if no pressure-relief devices are installed. Containers of helium gas at 5 to 10 K should be handled as if they contain liquid helium due to the rapid and significant thermal expansion that occurs when helium gas at less than 10 K is warmed <b>to</b> <b>room</b> temperature.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} other actinides, self-damage of the crystal lattice due to alpha-particle {{irradiation}} is intrinsic to americium. It is especially noticeable at low temperatures, where the mobility of the produced lattice defects is relatively low, by broadening of X-ray diffraction peaks. This effect makes somewhat uncertain the temperature of americium {{and some of its}} properties, such as electrical resistivity. So for americium-241, the resistivity at 4.2 K increases with time from about 2µOhm·cm to 10µOhm·cm after 40 hours, and saturates at about 16µOhm·cm after 140 hours. This effect is less pronounced at room temperature, due to annihilation of radiation defects; also heating <b>to</b> <b>room</b> temperature the sample which was kept for hours at low temperatures restores its resistivity. In fresh samples, the resistivity gradually increases with temperature from about 2 µOhm·cm at liquid helium to 69µOhm·cm at room temperature; this behavior {{is similar to that of}} neptunium, uranium, thorium and protactinium, but is different from plutonium and curium which show a rapid rise up to 60K followed by saturation. The room temperature value for americium is lower than that of neptunium, plutonium and curium, but higher than for uranium, thorium and protactinium.|$|E
5|$|On 20 September, German General Otto Liman von Sanders, the {{commander}} of the Yildirim Army Group, ordered Samakh's German and Ottoman garrison to prepare a strong rearguard defence of the town. By dawn on 25 September, when a regiment and two squadrons of the Australian 4th Light Horse Brigade attacked Samakh, the rearguard was strongly entrenched. The assault, which began with a mounted cavalry charge, ended two hours later after close quarter fighting in the village and the railway station. After fierce fighting with bayonets and swords, from room <b>to</b> <b>room</b> in the railway buildings, the town was captured. This victory, which captured the centre of the rearguard line, concluded the Battle of Sharon section of the Battle of Megiddo and opened the way for the cavalry pursuit to Damascus, which was captured on 1 October. By the time the Armistice of Mudros between the Allies and the Ottoman Empire was signed at the end of October, Aleppo had been captured and fighting was in progress further north.|$|E

They flew to Phuket on 15 March with Martin (still using his assumed name) who {{was sitting in the}} same row as them. He befriended the two and they checked into Nilly's Marina Inn facing Patong Beach. Martin was given Room 48 and the Damudes were given the adjacent Room 43. The Damudes were not seen again after they ate breakfast the next morning; at about 11a.m. THA (5a.m. UTC), Martin asked the inn's receptionist to switch his room <b>to</b> <b>Room</b> 43, saying that the Damudes had left and that he would pay their bill.|$|E
5|$|The {{security}} services took Biko to the Walmer police station in Port Elizabeth, {{where he was}} held naked in a cell with his legs in shackles. On 6 September, he was transferred from Walmer <b>to</b> <b>room</b> 619 of the security police headquarters in the Sanlam Building in central Port Elizabeth, where he was interrogated for 22 hours, handcuffed and in shackles, and chained to a grille. Exactly what happened has never been ascertained, but during the interrogation he was severely beaten {{by at least one}} of the ten security police officers. He suffered three brain lesions that resulted in a massive brain haemorrhage on 6 September. Following this incident, Biko's captors forced him to remain standing and shackled to the wall. The police later said that Biko had attacked one of them with a chair, forcing them to subdue him and place him in handcuffs and leg irons.|$|E
5|$|On December 15, the Mint shipped five kegs {{of the new}} coins, each holding 10,000 pieces, to Chicago. Each keg held five {{bags with}} a {{thousand}} coins each, though in one keg, one bag was intentionally short four coins, as also in that keg was a cigar box containing four envelopes, with coins number 1, 400, 1492, and 1892 {{from the first day}} of production. The kegs were taken to the Chicago Sub-Treasury, and on December 19 at 1:00pm conveyed <b>to</b> <b>Room</b> 404 of the Rand McNally Building, the exposition's headquarters. There, Harlow N. Higinbotham, president of the Exposition Company, took mallet and chisel in hand and opened the keg, removing the cigar box. Placing three of the envelopes in his pocket, he displayed the first coin to the assembled crowd, then exchanged it for a check—Wyckoff, Seamans & Benedict (later the Remington Typewriter Company and makers of the official typewriter of the fair), was purchasing the first coin struck for $10,000 as a publicity stunt. That coin was donated to the newly established Columbian Museum (today the Field Museum). The Company immediately put the pieces on sale for $1 each, and the first shipment was soon all sold to those who lined up to buy them, had ordered them by mail, or had purchased them at local banks that were given allocations. No official packaging was provided; the pieces exist in holders supplied by various banks.|$|E

5000|$|Originally {{built to}} {{accommodate}} the adventurous traveler of the 1930s and 1940s, motels were marketed as driver-friendly—motorists could drive right up <b>to</b> their <b>rooms.</b> Ironically, what was originally a selling point {{is now one of}} the most detrimental aspects of motels, from a crime prevention standpoint.

25|$|Sodium acetate is {{also used}} in heating pads, hand warmers, and hot ice. Sodium acetate trihydrate {{crystals}} melt at 136.4°F/58°C (to 137.12°F/58.4°C), dissolving in their water of crystallization. When they are heated past the melting point and subsequently allowed to cool, the aqueous solution becomes supersaturated. This solution is capable of cooling <b>to</b> <b>room</b> temperature without forming crystals. By pressing on a metal disc within the heating pad, a nucleation center is formed, causing the solution to crystallize back into solid sodium acetate trihydrate. The bond-forming process of crystallization is exothermic. The {{latent heat of fusion}} is about 264–289kJ/kg. Unlike some types of heat packs, such as those dependent upon irreversible chemical reactions, a sodium acetate heat pack can be easily reused by immersing the pack in boiling water for a few minutes, until the crystals are completely dissolved, and allowing the pack to slowly cool <b>to</b> <b>room</b> temperature.|$|E
