60|$|When Mr. Poplington got {{settled down}} in our spare room he blossomed {{out like a}} {{full-blown}} friend of the family, and accordingly began to give us advice.

So we had ever so much <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> although we all agreed it would be nicer not to take a public coach, but travel private, we didn't find it easy to decide as to the manner of travel. We all agreed that a carriage and horses would be too expensive, and Jone was rather in favor of a dogcart for us if Mr. Poplington would like to go on horseback; but the old gentleman said it would be too much riding for him, and if we took a dogcart he'd have to take another one. But this wouldn't be a very sociable way of travelling, and none of us liked it.|$|E

[...] "For the rest of it, {{there are a lot}} of songs that are dancier and a lot more R&B vocals."one of which is a duet with an R&B singer. She also worked with Dreamlab, who produced the title track, [...] "Hold Up" [...] and [...] "Mistake". The songs were recorded at Dreamlab Studios in Los Angeles, California and mixed by Serban Ghenea, with assistance from Phil Seaford, in Virginia Beach, Virginia at MixStar Studios. John Hanes was attributed with engineering for the songs. Rock Mafia, Ryan Tedder, and Kara DioGuardi. About working with Lovato, Tedder commented, [...] "Demi blew me out of the water vocally! I had no idea how good her voice is. She's one of the best singers I've ever worked with. Literally, that good... I mean, she's a Kelly Clarkson-level vocalist. And Kelly has a set of pipes". He also explained that the song they co-wrote together is much more upbeat than Skyscraper. [...] "I think everybody wanted to hear her <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>that,</b> <b>and</b> this is basically flipping it 180, saying, 'Oh, by the way, I'm still also just young and want to have fun.' There's even like a little rap feature on it." [...] In sessions with Tedder, Lovato recorded various songs, instead, only [...] "Who's That Boy" [...] was included on the album, commenting about the song, Lovato described it as [...] "flirty, it's sexy, it's exciting and I love it." ...|$|E
5000|$|In August 2013, in an {{interview}} with HipHopDX Krizz Kaliko explained where the album title Son of Sam came from, saying: [...] "I always keep titles for songs and albums kind of in the chamber, and I always wanted to do an album called Son Of Sam because Son Of Sam is just me, that’s what it means. My family name is Sam Watson, so that’s my legal name, my government name, to me it meant more of me. A lot of people know me from Tech N9ne’s music from the last 13 years you know, so I’ve always been kind of his co-writer, his sidekick, his hypeman. Travis O’Guin, who co founded Strange Music alongside Tech N9ne more than a decade ago, has been the business partner, I’ve always been Tech’s creative partner. So the more I put out albums the more I was becoming an individual artist. So I always wanted to do an album called Son Of Sam because it felt like to me {{a little bit of a}} liberation, not that I needed to be freed from that because that’s been a system that groomed me into being Krizz Kaliko. I’m giving you more of me and that’s pretty much where the title came from." [...] He also explained how he tries to reinvent himself every album, saying: [...] "I think that when you’re an artist like myself or Tech N9ne who have a fanbase and have people that are just loyal to us for years, you have to find ways to reinvent yourself every album and that’s what I did again with Son Of Sam. I wanna keep that core audience engaged. They love to hear me talk about what I’m going through in my life at the time and that makes it even easier to write, these albums kind of write themselves. I go through mental issues and a lot of people do, I think that’s what ended up engaging a core fanbase for me, I started having songs like ‘Anxiety’ and ‘Bipolar,’ so I just <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> all of sudden people are like, ‘Wow, I got the same problem too.’ So I engage them on a common playing field about emotional and mental disorders which I think all creative people have and I try to give them something new." ...|$|E

Many researchers <b>talked</b> <b>about</b> <b>that</b> <b>and</b> some of them introduce the use of semantic service discovery mechanisms {{to improve the quality}} of result. The key to searching service inventories is to find ways to represent them in a way that can be exploited by one of the standard methods like Google type search. In our work we introduce a review of ontology and mechanisms used there.
