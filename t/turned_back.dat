5|$|About 10:00, Kamimura's gunnery officer erroneously {{informed}} him that Izumo had expended three-quarters of her ammunition and he <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> after a five-minute rapid-fire barrage. He {{did not wish to}} leave the Tsushima Strait unguarded and thought that he could use his remaining ammunition on Rurik. By this time she had been sunk by Naniwa and Takachiho. They had radioed Kamimura that she was sunk, but he did not receive the message. Shortly after the Japanese <b>turned</b> <b>back,</b> Gromoboi and Rossia were forced to heave-to to make repairs. Iwate was the most seriously damaged Japanese ship and suffered a total of 40 killed and 37 wounded.|$|E
5|$|Before the {{completion}} of I-69 near Marshall in late 1967, US27 followed 17Mile Road and Kalamazoo Avenue into Marshall. That routing was <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> to local control after {{the completion}} of I-69 to I-94.|$|E

5000|$|The album version {{contains}} an opening with a backwards message. When {{the song is}} played in reverse, the message, in a masked heavy voice (performed by ELO drummer, Bev Bevan), can be heard stating, [...] "The music is reversible but time is not. <b>Turn</b> <b>back.</b> <b>Turn</b> <b>back.</b> <b>Turn</b> <b>back.</b> <b>Turn</b> back." [...] — ostensibly Jeff Lynne's shot at backmasking hysteria, after satanic allegations were made against their song [...] "Eldorado" [...] by Fundamentalist Christianity members. Snippets of Messiah by Handel can be heard during the album opening as well.|$|R

You hear, 'X number of people were killed today,' which I think does a huge disservice. It's like spitting on these {{young men and women}} who are over there fighting to help this country.|$|E
5|$|The Newberry Bus. M-28 was {{designated}} from 1936 until 1952 as M-28A. The MSHD {{maps of the}} time showed it signed as Bus. M-28 in 1952 before it was <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> to local control in 1953.|$|E
5|$|The highway {{designation}} {{was extended}} {{south to the}} then-new US16 freeway (now Interstate 96) around 1958. It was later truncated back to M-21 in Lowell in 1968. By 1980, the section of M-91 in Ionia County south of M-44 to the Kent County line was <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> to local control. The highway section in Kent County remained marked as M-91, resulting in a discontinuous highway. The southern section between Lowell and the county line was <b>turned</b> <b>back</b> by 1985, resulting in the modern routing of M-91.|$|E

5000|$|... "Fire on High" [...] {{contains}} a backwards {{message in the}} beginning. When the song is played backwards, drummer Bev Bevan can be heard saying [...] "The music is reversible, but time is not. <b>Turn</b> <b>back,</b> <b>turn</b> <b>back,</b> <b>turn</b> <b>back,</b> <b>turn</b> back...". This was, ostensibly, Jeff Lynne's response to accusations that the song [...] "Eldorado" [...] contained Satanic messages that could be heard when played backwards. [...] "Down Home Town" [...] begins with the chorus of [...] "Waterfall" [...] played backwards. A portion of the string crescendo from [...] "Nightrider" [...] was used backwards on [...] "Evil Woman".|$|R
