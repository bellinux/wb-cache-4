5|$|Hardware {{benchmarking}} {{conducted using}} Geekbench and GLBenchmark validates several claims that Apple included on their website and {{mentioned at the}} unveiling of the device, these include two times faster and two times the graphics performance. In the Geekbench overall hardware assessment, the iPhone 5 received a score that was approximately 2.5 {{times higher than the}} iPhone 4S. The benchmark conducted using GLBenchmark for the iPhone 5 returned a score that was 2 <b>times</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> the iPhone 4S. The result was however inconsistent as a 3D graphics benchmark assessment using Passmark returned a score that was only approximately 1.45 <b>times</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> the iPhone 4S. Battery life assessments conducted by AnandTech concluded that the battery life is shorter on the iPhone 5 than its predecessor when performing certain tasks, however when performing other tasks the iPhone 5 battery outlasts the iPhone 4S.|$|E

The tawny owl's hearing is ten <b>times</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> a human's, and it can hunt using this sense {{alone in the dark}} of a woodland on an overcast night, but the patter of raindrops makes it difficult to detect faint sounds, and prolonged wet weather can lead to starvation if the owl cannot hunt effectively.|$|E

5|$|An owl's {{eyes are}} {{placed at the}} front of the head and have a field overlap of 50–70%, giving it better {{binocular}} vision than diurnal birds of prey (overlap 30–50%). The tawny owl's retina has about 56,000 light-sensitive rod cells per square millimetre (36million per square inch); although earlier claims that it could see in the infrared part of the spectrum have been dismissed, it is still often said to have eyesight 10 to 100 <b>times</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> humans in low-light conditions. However, the experimental basis for this claim is probably inaccurate by at least a factor of 10. The owl's actual visual acuity is only slightly greater than that of humans, and any increased sensitivity is due to optical factors rather than to greater retinal sensitivity; both humans and owl have reached the limit of resolution for the retinas of terrestrial vertebrates.|$|E

Their analysis was inconclusive at best, and reported that the shoreline varies in elevation by several kilometers, rising and falling from one peak to the next for thousands of miles. This report cast doubt on whether the features truly mark a long-gone sea coast, and has been taken as an argument against the Martian shoreline (and ocean) hypothesis.|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} Heaven in Islam differs {{in many respects}} to the concept in Judaism and Christianity. Heaven is {{described}} primarily in physical terms {{as a place where}} every wish is immediately fulfilled when asked. Islamic texts describe immortal life in Heaven as happy, without negative emotions. Those who dwell in Heaven are said to wear costly apparel, partake in exquisite banquets, and recline on couches inlaid with gold or precious stones. Inhabitants will rejoice in the company of their parents, spouses, and children. In Islam if one's good deeds outweigh one's sins then one may gain entrance to Heaven. Conversely, if one's sins outweigh their good deeds they are sent to hell. The more good deeds one has performed the higher the level of Heaven one is directed to. It has been said that the lowest level of Heaven, the first one, is already over one-hundred <b>times</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> the greatest life on Earth. The highest level is the seventh Heaven. Houses are built by angels for the occupants using solid gold.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{prominence of}} standardized testing to assess student learning motivated the current investigation. We propose that standardized achievement test scores assess competencies determined more by intelligence than by self-control, whereas report card grades assess competencies determined more by self-control than by intelligence. In particular, {{we suggest that}} intelligence helps students learn and solve problems independent of formal instruction, whereas self-control helps students study, complete homework, and behave positively in the classroom. Two longitudinal, prospective studies of middle school students support predictions from this model. In both samples, IQ predicted changes in standardized achievement test scores over <b>time</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> did self-control, whereas self-control predicted changes in report card grades over <b>time</b> <b>better</b> <b>than</b> did IQ. As expected, the effect of self-control on changes in report card grades was mediated in Study 2 by teacher ratings of homework completion and classroom conduct. In a third study, ratings of middle school teachers about the content and purpose of standardized achievement tests and report card grades {{were consistent with the}} proposed model. Implications for pedagogy and public policy are discussed...|$|R
