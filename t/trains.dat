5|$|An {{alternative}} {{airport site}} to Gardermoen was proposed at Hurum, south-west of Oslo. Had Hurum been chosen, the Gardermoen Line {{would not have}} been necessary for the airport express train, but the planning documents recommended that construction still proceed to ease traffic congestion north of Oslo. The tunnel is used by all <b>trains</b> on the Gardermoen Line, including the Flytoget airport express, and the regional and express <b>trains</b> which continue via the Dovre Line.

40|$|As {{mnemonic}} utilization {{deficit in}} older adults associates with age-related decline in executive function, {{we hypothesized that}} memory strategy <b>training</b> combined with executive function <b>training</b> might induce larger <b>training</b> effect in memory and broader <b>training</b> effects in non-memory outcomes than pure memory <b>training.</b> The present study compared the effects of combined cognitive <b>training</b> (executive function <b>training</b> plus memory strategy <b>training)</b> to pure memory strategy <b>training.</b> Forty healthy older adults {{were randomly assigned to}} a combined cognitive <b>training</b> group or a memory strategy <b>training</b> group. A control group receiving no <b>training</b> was also included. Combined cognitive <b>training</b> group received 16 sessions of <b>training</b> (eight sessions of executive function <b>training</b> followed by eight sessions of memory strategy <b>training).</b> Memory <b>training</b> group received 16 sessions of memory strategy <b>training.</b> The results partly supported our hypothesis in that indeed improved performance on executive function was only found in combined <b>training</b> group, whereas memory performance increased less in combined <b>training</b> compared to memory strategy group. Results suggest that combined cognitive <b>training</b> may be less efficient than pure memory <b>training</b> in memory outcomes, though the influences from insufficient <b>training</b> time and less closeness between <b>trained</b> executive function and working memory could not be excluded; however it has broader <b>training</b> effects in non-memory outcomes.
