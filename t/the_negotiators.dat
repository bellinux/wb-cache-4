5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{collapse}} of the Russian Empire in 1917, the Armenian, Georgian, and Muslim leaders of the Caucasus united to create the Transcaucasian Federation in the winter of 1918. The Treaty of Brest-Litovsk had drastic consequences for the Armenians: Turkish forces reoccupied Western Armenia. The federation lasted for only three months, eventually leading to the proclamation of the Republics of Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan. <b>The</b> <b>negotiators</b> for Armenia were from the ARF.|$|E
5|$|When Richard left England in late 1189, the {{archbishop}} accompanied him to Normandy {{and then to}} Sicily, where Richard began the Third Crusade. In October 1190, Coutances was one of <b>the</b> <b>negotiators</b> between the city of Messina and the crusaders, and later was a guarantor of the peace treaty between King Richard and Tancred, the King of Sicily. The archbishop was also appointed one of the treasurers of the crusading army.|$|E
5|$|In {{the later}} part of 1186, {{after the death}} of King Henry's son Geoffrey– who was Duke of Brittany– King Philip II of France demanded that Geoffrey's daughters be placed in the French king's custody, and that the duchy of Brittany, which Geoffrey had ruled in right of his wife, be {{surrendered}} into French royal custody. Coutances was one of <b>the</b> <b>negotiators</b> sent by King Henry to secure a settlement, but they had to settle for a temporary truce. In January 1188 Coutances took the cross when he pledged to go on Crusade along with King Henry and King Philip of France.|$|E

5|$|The Pakistani negotiators {{inadvertently}} {{reveal the}} name of radio engineer Ali, whom the hijackers bring to the cockpit to use the radio for negotiations. Meanwhile, the Pakistani authorities try to stall for time. When a younger terrorist assaults the passengers and molests the attendants, the terrorist leader chastises him; humiliated, the younger terrorist storms into the cockpit and shoots Ali, screaming wild threats over the radio. While negotiations with the Pakistani air controllers drag on, <b>the</b> <b>negotiators</b> slowly lose control of the situation, with the hijackers becoming more agitated by the minute.|$|E
5|$|The delegates {{representing}} the provisional government departed for Ottawa in March. Although they initially met with legal difficulties {{arising from the}} execution of Scott, they soon entered into direct talks with Macdonald and George-Étienne Cartier. An agreement enshrining the demands {{in the list of}} rights was quickly reached, and this formed the basis for the Manitoba Act of 12 May 1870, which formally admitted Manitoba into the Canadian confederation. However, <b>the</b> <b>negotiators</b> could not secure a general amnesty for the provisional government.|$|E
5|$|The {{model of}} {{diplomatic}} {{spheres of influence}} resulting from the Congress of Vienna in 1814–15 after the Napoleonic Wars endorsed Austrian dominance in Central Europe. <b>The</b> <b>negotiators</b> at Vienna took no account of Prussia's growing strength within and among the German states and so failed to foresee that Prussia would rise to challenge Austria for leadership of the German peoples. This German dualism presented two {{solutions to the problem}} of unification: Kleindeutsche Lösung, the small Germany solution (Germany without Austria), or Großdeutsche Lösung, the greater Germany solution (Germany with Austria).|$|E

5|$|Among {{the mass}} protests that {{occurred}} {{at that time}} were the winter 1981 general strike in Bielsko-Biała, the nationwide warning strike {{in the spring of}} that year and hunger demonstrations in summer. The warning strike took place {{in the aftermath of the}} Bydgoszcz events (March 1981), during which the authorities resorted to violence to suppress Solidarity activists. The planned general strike was called off after Solidarity's questionable deal with the government, but <b>the</b> <b>negotiators</b> worked under a threat of Soviet intervention. Wałęsa's compromise prevented a confrontation with the regime or its foreign allies, at the price of the protest movement's loss of some of its dynamics. During the months that followed Solidarity kept getting weaker and its popular support was no longer capable of mass determined action.|$|E
5|$|The Gore letter did spur some {{progress}} in negotiations, as the Soviet Union allowed in late November 1958 for explicit control measures {{to be included}} in the text of the drafted treaty. By March 1959, <b>the</b> <b>negotiators</b> had agreed upon seven treaty articles, but they primarily concerned uncontroversial issues and a number of disputes over verification persisted. First, the Soviet verification proposal was deemed by the West to be too reliant on self-inspection, with control posts primarily staffed by citizens of the country housing the posts and a minimal role for officials from the international supervisory body. The West insisted that half of a control post staff be drawn from another nuclear state and half from neutral parties. Second, the Soviet Union required that the international supervisory body, the Control Commission, require unanimity before acting; the West rejected the idea of giving Moscow a veto over the Commission's proceedings. Finally, the Soviet Union preferred temporary inspection teams drawn from citizens of the country under inspection, while the West insisted on permanent teams composed of inspectors from the Control Commission.|$|E

25|$|In two {{meetings}} on February 23 and March 1, 1862, Union Major Gen. John E. Wool and Confederate Brig. Gen. Howell Cobb met {{to reach an}} agreement on prisoner exchanges.

25|$|In August, {{the first}} meeting between 12 victims of the {{conflict}} and <b>the</b> <b>negotiators</b> took place in Havana, an event hailed as a highly symbolic solemn exchange between the victims face-to-face with their victimizers. In a joint communiqué for the occasion, both sides reiterated that victims were {{at the core of}} the agreement. The second victims' delegation was received in September. Notwithstanding these encounters, victims of the FARC feeling that they had not been sufficiently taken into account organized a forum to have their voices taken into account. The forum brought together both opponents and supporters of the peace process.|$|E

Karen representatives played a relatively minor role in the conference and, as subsequent rebellions revealed, remained alienated from the new state. U Aung Zan Wai, U Pe Khin, Major Aung, Sir Maung Gyi, Dr Sein Mya Maung, and Myoma U Than Kywe were among <b>the</b> <b>negotiators</b> of the historic Panglong Conference negotiated with Aung San and other ethnic leaders in 1947.

30|$|In a {{real-world}} negotiation-based market, <b>the</b> <b>negotiator</b> tries {{to come close}} to the agreement by applying suitable negotiation strategy (amongst all feasible strategies) according to the evaluated critical condition of a trading market. That is, in {{a real-world}} negotiation-based market, instead of applying a single negotiation strategy during the negotiation process, a basket of negotiation strategies (i.e., negotiation_strategy_basket) is defined. This will increase the flexibility of <b>the</b> <b>negotiator</b> agents in <b>the</b> market environment to better respond to varying market conditions. Then, by considering the factors constituting the critical condition of a trading market as inputs, <b>the</b> <b>negotiator</b> agent decides to select the most suitable negotiation strategy from negotiation_strategy_basket as an output. It should be highlighted that in the negotiation_strategy_basket of <b>the</b> real-world <b>negotiators</b> <b>the</b> strategies such as: Normal movement, Reverse movement, and Relaxing movement can be found. These three early mentioned strategies are inspired from [5 – 8].|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> <b>Negotiator</b> is {{an element}} which embodies the negotiatory value of the clause. In BH, <b>the</b> <b>Negotiator</b> tends to be {{realized}} either as a juncture prosody towards {{the beginning of the}} clause or after the Finite/Predicator element. Teruya (Teruya 2004) defines <b>the</b> <b>Negotiator</b> in <b>the</b> Japanese clause as that element which “adds the negotiatory or attitudinal value of clause such as question, insistence or assertion”. Thai’s (Thai 2004) account of Vietnamese describes <b>the</b> <b>Negotiator</b> as “realized by one of the interpersonal particles: polar interrogative particles, elemental interrogative items or imperative particles”, which includes not only particles as traditionally understood, but also interrogative pro-forms which might be analyzed as Subject, Complement or Adjunct according to their functions in the clause. For examples of interrogative pro-forms which may be interpreted as Negotiators, see examples [22] through [24] above. BH also utilizes certain attitudinal Negotiators as well. These include the politeness marker nā and the emphatic marker -â discussed above in examples [20] and [21].|$|R
