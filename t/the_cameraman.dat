5|$|During the screening, {{the court}} heard that Muhammad had {{raised his hand}} to his {{forehead}} and moved his leg after <b>the</b> <b>cameraman</b> had said he was dead, {{and that there was no}} blood on his shirt. Enderlin argued that <b>the</b> <b>cameraman</b> had not said the boy was dead, but that he was dying. A report prepared for the court by Jean-Claude Schlinger, a ballistics expert commissioned by Karsenty, said that had the shots come from the Israeli position, Muhammad would have been hit in the lower limbs only.|$|E
5|$|Confusion arose {{about the}} timeline. <b>The</b> <b>cameraman</b> said the {{shooting}} began at noon and continued for 45 minutes. Jamal's account matched his: he and Muhammad {{arrived at the}} junction around noon, and were under fire for 45 minutes.|$|E

5|$|In October 2004 France 2 allowed three French {{journalists to}} view the raw footage—Denis Jeambar, {{editor-in-chief}} of L'Express; , former France 2 correspondent and head of news documentaries at Arte, a state-run television network; and , former editor-in-chief of Le Monde. They also asked to speak to <b>the</b> <b>cameraman,</b> who was in Paris at the time, but France 2 apparently told them he did not speak French and that his English was not good enough.|$|E
5|$|The {{director}} of has both been credited to Barry O'Neil and/or Lloyd B. Carleton by film historian Q. David Bowers. It {{is not known}} for certain who directed or if both them played a directorial {{a role in the}} production. Barry O'Neil was the stage name of Thomas J. McCarthy, who would direct many important Thanhouser pictures, including its first two-reeler, Romeo and Juliet. Lloyd B. Carleton was the stage name of Carleton B. Little, a director who would stay with the Thanhouser Company for a short time, moving to Biograph Company by the summer of 1910. The confusion between the directing credits stems from the industry practice of not crediting the film directors, even in studio news releases. There is also dispute over <b>the</b> <b>cameraman</b> credit for the film. Bower credits Blair Smith as <b>the</b> <b>cameraman,</b> but the American Film Institute adds that Carl Louis Gregory also could have been <b>the</b> <b>cameraman.</b> Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. Bowers believes that numerous releases were produced with Gregory operating the camera, but the role was uncredited in the 1910 era. Anna Rosemond was one of two leading ladies for {{the first year of the}} company. Rosemond joined in the autumn of 1909 and in their first year of productions. Frank H. Crane was involved in the very beginnings of the Thanhouser Company from 1909. Crane's was the first leading man of the company and acted in numerous productions before becoming a director at Thanhouser.|$|E

5|$|Enderlin {{responded to}} Leconte and Jeambar in January 2005 in Le Figaro. He thanked them for rejecting that the scene had been staged. He had {{reported}} that the shots were fired by the Israelis because, he wrote, he trusted <b>the</b> <b>cameraman,</b> {{who had worked for}} France 2 since 1988. In the days following the shooting, other witnesses, including other journalists, offered some confirmation, he said. He added that the Israeli army had not responded to France 2's offers to cooperate with their investigation.|$|E

Heuveldorp, unable to force the actors to play their roles seriously, shot several scenes with them acting as they wished before showing them the results; upon realising that their acting had been disappointing, the cast began to listen to stage directions. Afterwards they began rehearsing each scene at least twice, with Kartabrata standing behind <b>the</b> <b>cameraman</b> and giving directions.|$|E

5|$|Key issues include {{how much}} footage was shot; {{that it was}} blurred at the moment Jamal and Muhammad were hit; that France2 cut a few seconds in which the boy moves; and that <b>the</b> <b>cameraman</b> stopped filming at that point.

5|$|The film {{director}} is unknown, {{but it may}} have been Barry O'Neil. Film historian Q.

The role of <b>the</b> <b>cameraman</b> was uncredited in 1910 productions. Cast credits are unknown, but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary.

There is a burst of gunfire and the camera goes out of focus. When the gunfire subsides, Jamal is sitting upright and injured and Muhammad is lying over his legs. Enderlin cut a final few seconds from the footage that shows Muhammad lift his hand from his face. This cut became the basis of much of the controversy over the film.|$|E

The outcome {{of a lot of}} these effects would be unknown until the film was completed. Obayashi stated that sometimes the effects did not turn out how he originally envisioned them.|$|E
5|$|The {{adaptation}} of the scenario is credited to Lloyd F. Lonergan and Gertrude Thanhouser. While {{the director of the}} film is not known, two directors are possible. Barry O'Neil was the stage name of Thomas J. McCarthy, who would direct many important Thanhouser pictures, including its first two-reeler, Romeo and Juliet. Lloyd B. Carleton was the stage name of Carleton B. Little, a director who would stay with the Thanhouser Company for a short time, moving to Biograph Company by the summer of 1910. Bowers does not attribute either as the director for this particular production nor does Bowers credit a cameraman.

The other known credit, Frank H. Crane was a leading male actor of the company. Bowers states that most of the credits are fragmentary for 1910 Thanhouser productions.|$|E
5|$|The film's {{director}} is unknown, {{but it may}} have been Barry O'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson. Credit is sometimes given to Theodore Marston, an error that apparently originates with the American Film-Index 1908–1915. Film historian Q. David Bowers consulted one of the co-authors of the book, Gunnar Lundquist, and confirmed that the credit of Marston as director was in error. Marston worked with Pathé, Kinemacolor, Vitagraph and other companies, but there is no record of him working with Thanhouser. This error has persisted in several works including The Complete Index to Literary Sources in Film. Cameramen employed by the company at the time the film was made include Blair Smith, Carl Louis Gregory and Alfred H. Moses, Jr., but the role of <b>the</b> <b>cameraman</b> was uncredited in 1910 productions. This production is unique for having the cast members known, because most of the credits in Thanhouser's 1910 productions are fragmentary.|$|E
