50|$|Cables can be {{securely}} fastened and organized, such as by using <b>trunking,</b> <b>cable</b> trays, cable ties or cable lacing. Continuous-flex or flexible cables used in moving applications within cable carriers can be secured using strain relief devices or cable ties.|$|R
50|$|<b>Trunk</b> coaxial <b>cables</b> are {{connected}} to the optical node and form a coaxial backbone to which smaller distribution <b>cables</b> connect. <b>Trunk</b> <b>cables</b> also carry AC power which is added to the cable line at usually either 60 or 90 V by a power supply (with a lead acid backup battery inside) and a power inserter. The power is added to the cable line so that optical nodes, trunk and distribution amplifiers do not need an individual, external power source. The power supply might have a power meter next to it depending on local power company regulations.|$|R
50|$|Project Spinnaker was a defence {{research}} project initiated {{to develop the}} technologies needed to deploy acoustic listening posts on the seafloor in the coastal waters of interest. These arrays needed to be deployed in deep waters {{on the edge of}} the Continental Shelf; since these waters were ice-covered year round, a novel solution was needed to lay <b>trunk</b> <b>cables</b> from on-shore data processing centres out to the arrays.|$|R
50|$|The {{throughput}} of ports {{increased by}} 138 million tons and 12 new airports were built. 100,000 kilometers of long-distance <b>trunk</b> <b>cable</b> were finished, {{and the number}} of telephone switchboards increased to 58.95 million sets. Total installed generation capacity was increased to 75 million kilowatts, and annual electricity supply grew by 9%.|$|E
50|$|This is {{achieved}} by utilizing a split-architecture design that puts part of the barrier in an isolator card located in the safe area (power supply rack) & the other part {{in each of the}} spurs of field-mounted device couplers/segment. The barrier in the isolator allows 350 mA to be run through the segment up to the Spur/junction Box through <b>trunk</b> <b>cable.</b> Since infallible resistors are used, devices from Zone 0/1 or 2 can be direct connected. Having 350 mA, now allows users to power up to 16 Fieldbus devices (20 mA each) at 500 m while retaining intrinsic safety.|$|E
50|$|The {{company went}} {{underground}} {{in a big}} way in the 1920s, creating expensive new outside plant that fixed its geometry for the century to come. New cable ducts brought more reliable service to customers. They converged at approximately twenty wire centers, which were connected by larger <b>trunk</b> <b>cable</b> ducts running along the East and West Sides of Manhattan. The locations were a mile or two apart (2-3 km), close to concentrations of office workers without paying prime prices for land. At each wire center a new central office arose to house telephone switchboards, panel switches and other inside plant, and technicians, clerks, operators and other workers. The largest of these was also the corporate headquarters, at 140 West Street on the Lower West Side, about a kilometer (half mile) from AT&T HQ at 195 Broadway.|$|E
5000|$|From the <b>trunk</b> <b>cables,</b> smaller {{distribution}} cables {{are connected}} to a port of the trunk amplifier to carry the RF signal and the AC power down individual streets. If needed, line extenders, which are smaller distribution amplifiers, boost the signals to keep {{the power of the}} television signal at a level that the TV can accept. The distribution line is then [...] "tapped" [...] into and used to connect the individual drops to customer homes.|$|R
50|$|A {{more recent}} {{enhancement}} for intrinsically safe applications is the High Power Trunk (HPT) with field-based field barriers (FBs), which limits {{power at the}} spur, rather than the trunk.This method significantly changes the equation for end users of Fieldbus in hazardous settings. It increases the amount of available power and therefore the number of connected devices on a segment. It also lets end users maximize the length of their <b>trunk</b> <b>cables</b> without the restrictions of FISCO/Entity Barrier Concept.|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} {{production process}} of a <b>cable</b> <b>trunk</b> is plastic extrusion with PVC or other halogen containing materials.

A low smoke zero halogen (LSZH) <b>cable</b> <b>trunk</b> was designed and developed {{in the present study}} and the injection molding process was adopted to produce the LSZH <b>cable</b> <b>trunk.</b> Numerical simulations were applied to investigate the effects of the important process parameters on the warpage of the <b>cable</b> <b>trunk.</b> Comparing the simulation results under different process conditions and consideration both of the volumetric shrinkage and the total warpage displacement, it is found that the process parameters, including mold temperature 75 °C, melt temperature 265 °C, injection pressure 190 MPa, packing pressure 152 MPa, cooling water temperature 50 °C and injection time 3 s, are the optimal process conditions for the injection molding process of the new designed <b>cable</b> <b>trunk.</b> </p...|$|R
50|$|February 27, 1975 {{brought a}} fire in the {{telephone}} building at 204 Second Avenue, at East 13th Street. The MDF was destroyed, disconnecting tens of thousands of customers, and obsolescent switching equipment was destroyed or damaged by acrid smoke. Located {{at the south end of}} the East Side <b>trunk</b> <b>cable</b> duct under Second Avenue, this building connects many circuits to Brooklyn which were disrupted. A Bell System mobilization dealt with the crisis, including replacing the destroyed MDF. An obsolete and recently retired exchange at the West 18th Street office, not yet melted down for scrap metal, was temporarily resurrected to serve thousands of E13 customers though existing cross-town cables. The damaged Number One Crossbar Switching System (1XB switch) was cleaned, and a Number One Electronic Switching System (1ESS switch) that had been destined for the 104 Broad Street exchange was diverted. This was the largest loss of telephone service from fire in United States history until the September 11 attacks.|$|E
40|$|Web Based Cable Connectivity Monitoring System was {{the title}} of the project chosen to develop for Sri Lanka Telecom PLC in my partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirement of the degree of M. sc in Information Technology of the University of Moratuwa. Sri Lanka Telecom is the owner of the largest copper network in Sri Lanka which spans all over the island. Variety of services such as PSTN Voice Calls, ADSL Broadband Connections, IP-TV connections, Leased Line Connections uses this copper network as the communication media. So {{it is important to keep}} a track of this copper network, especially trunk cables which contain large number of wire pairs in order to provide uninterrupted and satisfactory service to subscribers. Currently there is no online monitoring system for this. SLT was seeking for a proper system to monitoring disconnected or damaged cables for last few years because it is so important to identify those disconnected cables as soon as possible and rectify them. Also Sri Lanka Telecom has to take rapid reactions to avoid stealing of these expensive cables. Therefore, under this project, monitoring <b>trunk</b> <b>cable</b> disconnections from a remote location by using an embedded system which contains Rabbit Core RCM 4010 microprocessor module and SNMP technology was proposed. This unit will send disconnected cable information with its position or segment using SNMP trap messages through Ethernet to SNMP trap detection unit which will be in a central location. And this will acknowledge the authorized persons in few seconds via email. This system also reduces the number of points have to be checked and makes easy to locate the fault. This system will detect, display & record cable disconnections with other features such as fault localization & security. This will reduce time taken to report cable faults and rectify them which will make a direct impact on customer satisfaction. And also will increase revenue of Sri Lanka Telecom by effectively using manpower...|$|E
50|$|After the attack, {{the cell}} phone network of New York City was rapidly {{overloaded}} (a mass call event) as traffic doubled over normal levels. Cell phone traffic also overloaded across the East Coast, leading to crashes of {{the cell phone}} network. Verizon's downtown wire phone service was interrupted for days and weeks because of cut subscriber cables, and to the 140 West Street exchange being shut for days. Capacity between Brooklyn and Manhattan was also diminished by cut <b>trunk</b> <b>cables.</b>|$|R
50|$|Amphenol Socapex {{is still}} {{manufacturing}} and selling the original Socapex.

While some companies use Socapex as a rigging motor power cable, this is generally not recommended as differences in voltage (i.e., 400 V vs. 230 V) can be misinterpreted, causing extensive equipment damage.|$|R
50|$|In 2011 {{the entire}} lineup was {{replaced}} with the 3rd generation M215, combining {{the features of the}} M190 and D380. Like the M190, the M215 was a single inverter, now in a much smaller box. Like the D380, the M215 used a <b>trunk</b> <b>cabling</b> system with short connector cables on the inverters. However, instead of one or three-drop cable, the M215's Engage system, used a long roll of cables with connectors spliced into it. The installer cuts the Engage cable to the required length, and then caps the open ends that result.|$|R

50|$|In telephony, a main {{distribution}} frame (MDF or main frame) is a signal distribution frame for connecting equipment (inside plant) to cables and subscriber carrier equipment (outside plant). The MDF is a termination point within the local telephone exchange where exchange equipment and terminations of local loops are connected by jumper wires at the MDF. All cable copper pairs supplying services through user telephone lines are terminated at the MDF and distributed through the MDF to equipment within the local exchange e.g. repeaters and DSLAM. Cables to intermediate distribution frames (IDF) terminate at the MDF. <b>Trunk</b> <b>cables</b> may terminate on the same MDF or on a separate trunk {{main distribution}} frame (TMDF).|$|R

40|$|Cable {{television}} (CATV) systems generally {{consist of}} a headend, <b>trunk</b> <b>cables,</b> distribution cables in the neighborhood, drop cables to a home and in-house wiring, and terminal equipment. Coaxial cables bring a CATV signal to customer premises through a service drop, an overhead or underground cable. Hermetic inline amplifiers are used to amplify the attenuated CATV signal due to propagation loss or splitting the coaxial cable. They are usually installed on utility poles. Therefore, maintenance methods for inline amplifiers on utility poles are important issues in CATV operations. This paper proposes a new maintenance system for inline amplifiers in CATV systems, and develops a prototype implementation. The proposed system consists of an amplifier gain analyser to measure amplification performance of inline amplifiers, a special smartphone application, and a cloud server. The proposed amplifier gain analyser is composed of three functions: a generation of high frequency signals for testing, measurement of the test signal gain, and wireless communication based on Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE). We develop a signal generation circuit for a test signal and a smoothing circuit for converting the high frequency test signals into DC signals. The amplifier gain analyser can evaluate an amplifier gain by comparing an input test signal from the signal generation circuit and an output test signal from an inline amplifier. The measurement function uses Nordic nRF 51822, which is a System on Chip (SoC) for BLE because Nordic nRF 51822 has some AD converter ports for evaluating the DC signals. The smartphone application employs BLE communication function to collect the measured amplifier gain from the amplifier gain analyser. Therefore, we developed a special data collection application for iOS. The data collection application has a central function of BLE, and can find a target peripheral device that is the amplifier gain analyser in this paper. Therefore, technicians of CATV systems can easily check the operational status of inline amplifiers on utility poles. Additionally, the smartphone application can upload the measured information to a cloud storage server. We employ Google App Engine and use Cloud Datastore to implement the cloud storage service. Therefore, our storage service has flexibility for various kinds of information...|$|R

40|$|The {{communication}} networks, {{that we know}} nowadays {{has been}} changing since the time when Alexander Graham Bell discovered the great invention of that time – the telephone. It was mainly {{the level of the}} technique and electronics that helped to improve the first systems of connection between each other. This process caused the first communication networks. All the changes were done on the field of the radio operation. The networks were analog and were contained mainly by metallic – cooper wire. On the field of radio communication were mainly electromagnetic waves which maintained the connection of the places where was not able to stretch <b>trunk</b> <b>cables.</b> Communication has made huge qualitative improvement. This process has used different types of wire that were able to transmit higher and higher frequencies and to raise a number of made connections. All those changes were involved in radio network. In 1950 s the entertainment was made mainly through television broadcast. This improvement needed the new studios and broadcast systems and also the radio improved. In that time there was huge automatic PBX equipped with stepper drivers matrix switches. The networks started to be divided into access drivers which resulted from the subscriber terminal to the first connection point, for example, the first public telephone exchange. Among these exchanges was formed their interlinking transport or transportation network, to finally, after reaching the target (last panel) would be merged back into the network access for remote users. The aim is to describe some properties of transport networks, the contemporary, which has been fully digital technology. We will focus on data networks, i. e. those that are available to contemporary man, and describe some of the technologies and components that can be used. We meet with OPNET Modeler software and the philosophy of working with him. We recommend optimalization of the designed transportation network on the basis of OPNET Modeler simulation results. Afterwards we design a suitable laboratory task for bachelor degree students of Teleinformatics...|$|R

40|$|As the {{complexity}} of communication networks increases, it becomes increasingly difficult to isolate and diagnose network faults. This maintenance problem {{is due to the}} large number of functional elements within the networks, the elements' technical complexity, and their inherent interaction.

Several tugboats were required to pull the ship out of the mud and into the river channel. A month later Willamette visited Portland, Oregon and transited to the ship's namesake, the Willamette River. While mooring at Portland, the ship hit an underwater cement pier containing a main telephone <b>trunk.</b> The phone <b>cable</b> was cut, the cement pier destroyed, and the western half of the city of Portland lost phone services for several days.

Damping ratios were calculated from the power spectral density plots using the half power bandwidth method. Trees with steel support cables had higher natural frequencies than trees without steel support cables. Sample trees had higher natural frequencies in the leaf off condition than the leaf on condition. The increase in natural frequency associated with the steel support cable was less pronounced in the leaf on condition.

40|$|Exercise {{is one of}} the few {{effective}} {{treatments for}} LBP. Although exercise is often based on the premise of reduced spinal stiffness, trunk muscle adaptation may increase stiffness. This study developed and validated a method to assess trunk stiffness and damping, and tested these parameters in 14 people with recurring LBP and 17 pain-free individuals. Effective trunk stiffness, mass and damping were estimated with the trunk modeled as a linear second-order system following trunk perturbation. Equal weights (12 – 15 % body weight) were attached to the front and back of the trunk via pulleys such that the trunk could move freely and no muscle activity was required to hold the weights. The trunk was perturbed by the unexpected release of one of the weights. <b>Trunk</b> kinematics and <b>cable</b> force were used to estimate system properties. Reliability was assessed in 10 subjects. Trunk stiffness was greater in recurrent LBP patients (forward perturbation only), but damping was lower (both directions) than healthy controls. Estimates were reliable and validated by accurately estimated mass. Contrary to clinical belief, trunk stiffness was increased, not reduced, in recurrent LBP, most likely due to augmented trunk muscle activity and changes in reflex control of trunk muscles. Although increased stiffness may aid in the protection of spinal structures, this may have long-term consequences for spinal health and LBP recurrence due to compromised trunk dynamics (decreased damping) ...|$|R
