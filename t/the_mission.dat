Bachelot and Short {{traveled}} to <b>the</b> <b>Mission</b> San Gabriel Arcángel, {{where they were}} welcomed by the Franciscans who staffed <b>the</b> <b>mission.</b> Bachelot later became the pastor of a church in Los Angeles, served as an assistant minister for <b>the</b> <b>mission,</b> and led <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> on an interim basis after its priest was reassigned in 1834. He also taught in Los Angeles schools during a teacher shortage. He ministered in California until 1837 and became popular with Angelenos.|$|E
5|$|The crew's {{preparation}} for <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> had begun some thirteen months earlier in 1994, {{with the crew}} being trained {{in the operation of}} the space shuttle, the mating and docking procedures that would be required as Atlantis approached Mir later in <b>the</b> <b>mission,</b> and the management of the various scientific experiments being carried on the orbiter during <b>the</b> <b>mission.</b>|$|E

50|$|After {{the death}} of Father Francisco Oliñano in 1647, the missionary Baltasar Xavier Loaisa took charge of all <b>the</b> <b>missions</b> {{previously}} directed by Olidaño, but because <b>the</b> <b>missions</b> territory was extensive, Olidaño only took charge of <b>the</b> <b>missions</b> on <b>the</b> {{eastern side of the}} Yaqui River, which were only Ónabas and Tecoripa. Thus the visiting Pedro Pantoja made Molarja in charge of <b>the</b> <b>missions</b> on <b>the</b> western side of the river, which were Rebeico, Soyopa and Suaqui.|$|R
40|$|Several robotic {{exploration}} {{missions to}} Mars that are proposed {{for inclusion in}} <b>the</b> Space Exploration <b>Mission</b> are reviewed. <b>The</b> <b>missions</b> discussed range from remote sensing orbital missions to landed missions, such as simple surface stations and roving vehicles.

5|$|The fourth {{mission in}} the World Heritage Site, <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> of Concepción, was {{initially}} founded in 1699 by the Jesuit priests Fr. Francisco Lucas Caballero and Fr. Francisco Hervás. A nearby mission, San Ignacio de Boococas, was incorporated in 1708. <b>The</b> <b>mission</b> was moved three times: in 1707, 1708 and 1722. <b>The</b> <b>mission</b> was inhabited by the Chiquitanos, the largest tribe in the region. <b>The</b> <b>mission</b> church was constructed between 1752 and 1756, by Fr. Martin Schmid and Fr. Johann Messner. From 1975 to 1996 <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> was reconstructed as part of Hans Roth's restoration project.|$|E
5|$|After {{selecting}} the landing site for Apollo 16, sampling the Descartes and Cayley formations, two geologic {{units of the}} lunar highlands, was determined by mission planners {{to be the primary}} sampling interest of <b>the</b> <b>mission.</b> It was these formations that the scientific community widely suspected were formed by lunar volcanism, but this hypothesis was proven incorrect by the composition of lunar samples from <b>the</b> <b>mission.</b>|$|E
50|$|With {{the loss}} of <b>the</b> <b>missions,</b> <b>the</b> places held by the royalists were largely without a source to supply their armies & were at risk of hunger. Brigadier La Torre left Angostura for <b>the</b> <b>missions</b> in order to reconquer the area and its resources. It had about 1,600 infantry, 200 cavalry and 2 guns with him, and {{traveled}} to <b>the</b> <b>missions</b> through <b>the</b> castles of old Guayana.|$|R
2500|$|The {{establishment}} of these missions {{was not without}} difficulty and danger. The Guaraní shamans resisted {{the imposition of a}} new religion and up to 7 Jesuits were killed by Indians during the first few years after <b>the</b> <b>missions</b> were established. In 1618 began {{the first of a series}} of epidemics that would spread among <b>the</b> <b>missions</b> and kill thousands of the Guaraní. The congregation of the Guaraní into large settlements at <b>the</b> <b>missions</b> facilitated <b>the</b> spread of disease. [...] Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>missions</b> soon had 40,000 Guaraní in residence. However, tens of thousands of Guaraní living in the same region remained outside <b>the</b> <b>missions,</b> living in their traditional manner and practicing their traditional religion.|$|R
50|$|Previous <b>missions</b> include <b>the</b> 2010 <b>mission,</b> which visited three moons of Jupiter, <b>the</b> 2009 <b>mission</b> to Iapetus, <b>the</b> 2008 <b>mission</b> to Mars, and <b>the</b> 2007 <b>mission</b> to Borrelly.|$|R
5|$|Apaches shunned <b>the</b> <b>mission,</b> and on March 16, 1758, {{a band of}} Comanche, Tonkawa, and Hasinai tribes, {{angry that}} the Spaniards were {{assisting}} their enemies, pillaged and burned <b>the</b> <b>mission,</b> killing eight people. The San Sabá mission was the only Spanish mission in Texas to be completely destroyed by Indians, and it was never rebuilt. Although the Indian force had 2000members, they chose not to attack the fort.|$|E

The player may also find numerous in-game upgrades that enhance aspects of the game's weapons and armor.|$|E
5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> status briefing, Jennifer Wiseman, Chief of Exoplanet and Stellar Astrophysics for Goddard Space Flight Center, {{noted that}} the repair of STIS was a major victory for both <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> and the science community, as {{that part of the}} {{telescope}} performed unique functions, helping scientists understand the materials planets are composed of, and looking at things like the motion of stars around black holes.|$|E
5|$|FreeSpace 2 {{has many}} helpful {{features}} available. The player can target enemies attacking a protected objective or match speeds with them. Power can be shunted between shields, engines, and weapons, thereby allowing faster recharge of shields, afterburners, and weapons {{at the expense}} of other subsystems. These features can be ignored without any detrimental effects on gameplay. <b>The</b> <b>mission</b> parameters are not rigidly fixed, as there is an allowance for the failures of some primary objectives. When <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> is concluded, a post-mission briefing will be conducted to discuss <b>the</b> <b>mission,</b> and the performance of the player, before the next mission can be taken on.|$|E
50|$|A multi-university {{study in}} 2015 {{questioned}} {{the effectiveness of}} <b>the</b> Bolivarian <b>missions,</b> showing that only 10% of Venezuelans studied benefitted from <b>the</b> <b>missions.</b> Of that 10%, almost half were not affected from poverty.

25|$|In 1875 American {{illustrator}} Henry Chapman Ford began visiting each of <b>the</b> twenty-one <b>mission</b> sites, {{where he}} created a historically important portfolio of watercolors, oils, and etchings.

5|$|In May 1769, Gaspar de Portolà {{established}} the Fort Presidio of San Diego {{on a hill}} near the San Diego River.

By 1797, <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> boasted the largest native population in Alta California, with over 1,400 neophytes living in and around <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> proper. Mission San Diego was the southern anchor in California of the historic mission trail El Camino Real. Both the Presidio and <b>the</b> <b>Mission</b> are National Historic Landmarks.|$|E

50|$|The {{influence}} of <b>the</b> Fransciscan <b>missions</b> declined during <b>the</b> 20th century. A Chiriguano leader named Ubaldino Cundeye, his wife, Octavia, and relatives moved to La Paz in 1930 and {{asserted that the}} Chiriguanos had rights as citizens of Bolivia. Cundeye campaigned for the Chiriguanos to reclaim land from <b>the</b> <b>missions.</b> However, <b>the</b> Chaco War (1932-1935) resulted in the dispossession {{of much of the}} remaining land belonging to <b>the</b> <b>missions</b> and <b>the</b> Chiriguanos. The Chiriguanos largely became migrant, landless workers, many in Argentina. <b>The</b> <b>missions</b> were finally dissolved in 1949.|$|R
5|$|In taking {{leadership}} of the diocese, Archbishop Le Hunsec noted that the island of Carabane, heavily populated when trading was concentrated there, had lost its influence and now had fewer than 500inhabitants. He considered transferring <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> to Oussouye, which became a reality in 1927.
