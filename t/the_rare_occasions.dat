5|$|It {{has been}} known to kill deer, {{especially}} in winter when smaller prey is scarce, or when deer populations become more abundant. One study in the Everglades showed a large majority of kills (33 of 39) were fawns, but prey up to eight times the bobcat's weight could be successfully taken. It stalks the deer, often when the deer is lying down, then rushes in and grabs it by the neck before biting the throat, base of the skull, or chest. On <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> a bobcat kills a deer, it eats its fill and then buries the carcass under snow or leaves, often returning to it several times to feed.|$|E

25|$|As {{fluoroquinolone}} {{is one of}} the few antibiotics widely {{effective against}} P. aeruginosa, in some hospitals, its use is severely restricted to avoid the development of resistant strains. On <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> where infection is superficial and limited (for example, ear infections or nail infections), topical gentamicin or colistin may be used.|$|E
25|$|Since World War II Maltese {{political}} culture has {{developed into a}} two-party system dominated by the Labour Party and the Nationalist Party. Although other political parties have presented candidates and, in some cases, elected MPs, in most cases these were splinter groups of the main parties and, on <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> when they were successful, this success was short-lived.|$|E

25|$|Mount Binuluan {{is usually}} covered in cloud or mist and so {{photographs}} could {{be difficult to}} obtain. The village of Bangtitan in Upper Uma in Lubuagan is a good vantage point for views and photography of the mountain on <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> when the primary peak is not mist-enshrouded. It is not known if Binuluan itself has ever been climbed as access to the site is very difficult. The terrain is rugged and undeveloped.|$|E
25|$|Ridgway {{was born}} in Stockport, Cheshire, England on 10 August 1923. As a county cricketer, Ridgway, {{although}} not appearing a likely successful pace bowler because of his slight build, was the mainstay of Kent's opening attack for a decade after World War II, except on <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> that Jack Martin could get away from business. Ridgway did not play regularly in 1946, but the following year he jumped into prominence with 12 for 86 on a rain-affected pitch against Yorkshire.|$|E

25|$|Flyer was {{faster than}} Indianapolis. Although {{steamboat}} races were by then officially forbidden by company officials, Flyers crews were continually challenging their counterparts to a race. Finally on 28 July 1910, the superior {{speed of the}} Flyer was firmly established, at least to her partisans, when on one of <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> when the two vessels left the Seattle dock at the same time, Flyer beat Indian to Tacoma, unloading her passengers and departing for the fuel dock before the Indian had arrived.|$|E
25|$|On the Royalist side, the {{campaign}} of 1645 opened in the west, where Charles II, the young prince of Wales was sent with Hyde (later, Earl of Clarendon), Hopton, and others as his advisers. General (Lord) Goring, however, now {{in command of the}} Royalist field forces in this quarter, was truculent, insubordinate and dissolute.

25|$|A {{total of}} up to eight chariots (two chariots per team), powered by four horses each, competed on the racing track of the Hippodrome. These races were not simple {{sporting}} events, but also provided some of <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> in which the Emperor and the common citizens could {{come together in a}} single venue. Political discussions were often made at the Hippodrome, which could be directly accessed by the Emperor through a passage that connected the Kathisma (Emperor's Loge at the eastern tribune) with the Great Palace of Constantinople.|$|E
50|$|There {{is little}} mixing between the castes. On <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasion</b> that an Oto {{man has a}} child with a Twa woman, the child is raised as Twa.

25|$|The New York parade {{is moved}} to the {{previous}} Saturday (16 March) in years where 17 March is a Sunday. The event also has been moved on <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> when, due to Easter's falling on a very early date, 17 March would land in Holy Week. This same scenario arose again in 2008, when Easter fell on 23 March, but the festivities occurred on their normal date and were enjoyed by {{a record number of}} viewers. In many other American cities (such as Philadelphia), the parade is always held on the Sunday before 17 March, regardless of the liturgical calendar.|$|E
25|$|For state ceremonies, the dignitaries {{would enter}} through the Kenreimon (建礼門), {{which has a}} cypress-wood roof, and is {{supported}} by four unpainted wooden pillars. This gate would have been used on <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> of the emperor welcoming a foreign diplomat or dignitary, {{as well as for}} many other important state ceremonies. Passing through the Kenreimon, the inner gate Jomeimon would appear, which is painted in vermilion and roofed in tile. This leads to the Shishin-den, which is the Hall for State Ceremonies. The Gekkamon is a smaller gate {{on the west side of}} the main courtyard.|$|E
25|$|Hungry ghost realm (Preta): hungry ghosts {{suffer from}} extreme hunger and thirst. They wander {{constantly}} {{in search of}} food and drink, only to be miserably frustrated any time they come close to actually getting what they want. For example, they see a stream of pure, clear water in the distance, but {{by the time they get}} there the stream has dried up. Hungry ghosts have huge bellies and long, thin necks. On <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> that they do manage to find something to eat or drink, the food or water burns their neck as it goes down to their belly, causing them intense agony.|$|E
50|$|There are few {{differences}} between eledhel and the moredhel. They are most distinct in their ways of thinking. On <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasion</b> that a moredhel {{turns away from}} his ways, an event known as Returning, and reaches the eledhel he {{is considered one of}} them. For an outsider, from that moment on the moredhel is eledhel.|$|R
50|$|When {{the tunnel}} is open, the lake's {{turbidity}} increases. The sudden influx of the Adige's water, {{which is both}} appreciably colder and more polluted than the lake's, causes a considerable heat shock and significantly worsens the habitat for fish.For these reasons the tunnel is used only on <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasion</b> {{when there is a}} flood risk in the Veronese basin.|$|R

25|$|During {{this period}} Torquay also {{encountered}} political developments. In 1926, the former Liberal MP for Chertsey Francis John Marnham served a one-year term as Mayor of Torquay; {{it was one}} of <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> when the Town Council selected a chief magistrate from outside its own members. A few years later, Oswald Mosley's British Union of Fascists attempted to move into the region following great success in the city of Plymouth where the Union had upwards of 1,500 members in 1933, and Mosley spoke to packed meetings in Plymouth's Guildhall and the Drill Hall in Millbay to great acclaim. However, the Torquay branch of the Fascists never took off to the same extent and at its peak in 1933 only had 34 members. By 1935 it had been absorbed back into the Plymouth branch.|$|E
25|$|The Bulgarians usually avoided frontal {{assault and}} waited the enemy to attack first. After the {{opponent}} inevitably breaks his battle formation the Bulgarians would counter-attack with their heavy cavalry. In several battles the Bulgarian troops waited the Byzantines for {{days until the}} latter attack— for instance at Marcelae (792) or Versinikia (813) - and scored decisive victories. In one of <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasions</b> in which the army made a frontal attack on the enemy, {{the result was a}} defeat despite the heavy casualties the enemy suffered - battle of Anchialus (763). After a successful battle the Bulgarian would pursue the enemy in depth in order to eliminate as much soldiers as possible and not to allow him to reorganize his forces quickly and effectively. For instance after the victory at Ongal in 680 the Byzantines were chased for 150–200km. After the success at Anchialus in 917 the Byzantines were not given time to prepare their resistance properly and the result was the annihilation of their last forces in the battle of Katasyrtai.|$|E

Tesla would then resume his work, often until 3:00a.m." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{government}} had {{a policy of}} total silence on {{the actions of the}} maquis. For this reason, outside of the areas of maquis activity, the population had practically no knowledge of the maquis. On <b>the</b> <b>rare</b> <b>occasion</b> that an item appeared in the press, the maquis were always referred to as [...] "bandoleros" [...] (bandits), in order to strip the actions of all political context.|$|R
5000|$|Parker married Wendy Cherry in Ballito, KwaZulu-Natal, on 16 June 2012 at a {{ceremony}} attended by 170 guests.
