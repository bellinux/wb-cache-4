5|$|At {{the same}} time, recent studies show an {{increasingly}} positive attitude {{of patients and}} physicians (M.D. and D.O.) towards the use of manual therapy as a valid, safe and effective <b>treatment</b> <b>modality.</b> One survey, published in the Journal of Continuing Medical Education, found {{that a majority of}} physicians (81%) and patients (76%) felt that manual manipulation (MM) was safe, and over half (56% of physicians and 59% of patients) felt that manipulation should be available in the primary care setting. Although less than half (40%) of the physicians reported any educational exposure to MM and less than one-quarter (20%) have administered MM in their practice, most (71%) respondents endorsed desiring more instruction in MM. Another small study examined the interest and ability of M.D. residents in learning osteopathic principles and skills, including OMT. It showed that after a 1-month elective rotation, the M.D. residents responded favorably to the experience.|$|E
5|$|One area of {{clinical}} research {{is focused on}} treating the underlying disease pathology. Reduction of beta-amyloid levels is a common target of compounds (such as apomorphine) under investigation. Immunotherapy or vaccination for the amyloid protein is one <b>treatment</b> <b>modality</b> under study. Unlike preventative vaccination, the putative therapy {{would be used to}} treat people already diagnosed. It is based upon the concept of training the immune system to recognise, attack, and reverse deposition of amyloid, thereby altering the course of the disease. An example of such a vaccine under investigation was ACC-001, although the trials were suspended in 2008. Another similar agent is bapineuzumab, an antibody designed as identical to the naturally induced anti-amyloid antibody. However, immunotherapeutic agents have been found to cause some concerning adverse drug reactions, such as amyloid-related imaging abnormalities. Other approaches are neuroprotective agents, such as AL-108, and metal-protein interaction attenuation agents, such as PBT2. A TNFα receptor-blocking fusion protein, etanercept has showed encouraging results.|$|E

25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that, in Hodgkin lymphoma, fever and weight loss are much more prognostically significant than night sweats.

However, fever and weight loss had a pronounced negative impact on cure and survival rates, regardless of <b>treatment</b> <b>modality.</b>|$|E
25|$|CRT: People with NYHA class III or IV, left {{ventricular}} ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35% or less and a QRS interval of 120 ms or more {{may benefit from}} cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT; pacing {{both the left and}} right ventricles), through implantation of a bi-ventricular pacemaker.

25|$|Recompression {{treatment}} in a hyperbaric chamber was initially {{used as a}} life-saving tool to treat decompression sickness in caisson workers and divers who stayed too long at depth and developed decompression sickness.

25|$|The risk of {{malignancy}} {{is highest}} in the U.S. in Caucasian men over fifty years of age with {{more than five years}} of symptoms. Current recommendations include routine endoscopy and biopsy (looking for dysplastic changes). Although in the past physicians have taken a watchful waiting approach, newly published research supports consideration of intervention for Barrett's esophagus. Balloon-based radiofrequency ablation, invented by Ganz, Stern, and Zelickson in 1999, is a new <b>treatment</b> <b>modality</b> for the treatment of Barrett's esophagus and dysplasia, and {{has been the subject of}} numerous published clinical trials. The findings demonstrate radiofrequency ablation has an efficacy of 90% or greater with respect to complete clearance of Barrett's esophagus and dysplasia with durability up to five years and a favorable safety profile.|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of HPV within the tumour has been realised {{to be an}} important factor for predicting survival since the 1990s. Tumor HPV status is strongly associated with positive therapeutic response and survival compared with HPV-negative cancer, independent of the <b>treatment</b> <b>modality</b> chosen and even after adjustment for stage. While HPV+OPC patients have a number of favourable demographic features compared to HPV-OPC patients, such differences account for only about ten per cent of the survival difference seen between the two groups. Response rates of over 80% are reported in HPV+ cancer and three-year progression free survival has been reported as 75–82% and 45–57%, respectively, for HPV+ and HPV- cancer, and improving over increasing time. It is likely that HPV+OPC is inherently less maligant than HPV-OPC, since patients treated by surgery alone have a better survival after adjustment for stage. In one study, less than 50% of patients with HPV-OPC were still alive after five years, compared to more than 70% with HPV+OPC and an equivalent stage and disease burden.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Although cost−utility {{models are}} often used to {{estimate}} the value of treatments for metastatic cancer, limited information {{is available on the}} utility of common <b>treatment</b> <b>modalities.</b> Bisphosphonate <b>treatment</b> for bone metastases is frequently administered via intravenous infusion, while a newer treatment is administered as a subcutaneous injection. This study estimated the impact of these <b>treatment</b> <b>modalities</b> on health state preference. Methods: Participants from the UK general population completed time trade-off interviews to assess the utility of health state vignettes. Respondents first rated a health state representing cancer with bone metastases. Subsequent health states added descriptions of <b>treatment</b> <b>modalities</b> (ie, injection or infusion) to this basic health state. The two <b>treatment</b> <b>modalities</b> were presented with and without chemotherapy, and infusion characteristics were varied by duration (30 minutes or 2 hours) and renal monitoring.

2500|$|In {{contrast}} to this, {{a number of}} facts about Kraig have become public information, including: {{that he was a}} gay man; that according to his family, he never recovered from these treatments; and that in 2003, at the age of 38, he committed suicide. [...] Even without confirmed knowledge of such outcomes, by the mid 1970s Rekers' publications on his <b>treatment</b> <b>modality</b> were already attracting harsh criticism from scholarly and popular media sources and Bryant speculates that this is one possible explanation for why many clinicians do not publish on their treatment techniques, focusing instead on less controversial aspects of GIDC, such as diagnostic criteria. [...] At present, the nature of current treatments administered on children diagnosed with GIDC are poorly explained in the work of prominent clinicians such as Kenneth Zucker; however, first-person accounts of treatment in popular media sources would seem to indicate that feminine behaviours in boys continue to be identified and selected for elimination, hence the mounting opposition to this practice.|$|E
