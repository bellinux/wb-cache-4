The fluids can be either liquids or gases on either the shell or the <b>tube</b> <b>side.</b> In order to transfer heat efficiently, a large heat transfer area should be used, leading {{to the use of}} many tubes.

40|$|In {{this paper}} is to study the {{performance}} of heat exchangers by using computational analysis method. In past decade years, many researchers had discovered that nanofluids have a brilliant efficient in the heat transfer process. They believes that applied the nanofluids in the heat transfer equipment would brings a better enhancement compare with the conventional cooling fluids. In the literature journals, the authors have specified focused on the thermal conductivity specific, heat, density, and viscosity of nanofluids. They believe these are the most significant factors of the working fluids that would influence the efficiency of heat exchanger. In this study, an imitated real-life marine transport used of shell and tube heat exchanger to be analyzed. The shell and <b>tube</b> <b>sides</b> of heat exchanger will be filled with Water or nanofluids and Water or SeaWater in respectively. The nanofluids will be assumed as single-phase nanofluids with variant of volume fraction of copper and alumina. The computational result of Water at the shell and <b>tube</b> <b>sides</b> will be used as validation of data compared with the technical performance specification given by the supplier. Further, the efficiency of different volume fraction of nanofluids and the optimum of volume fraction of nanofluids in this system would be discussed in the simulation results...|$|R

50|$|A surface {{condenser}} {{is an example}} of such a heat-exchange system. It is a shell and tube heat exchanger installed at the outlet of every steam turbine in thermal power stations. Commonly, the cooling water flows through the <b>tube</b> <b>side</b> and the steam enters the shell side where the condensation occurs {{on the outside of the}} heat transfer tubes. The condensate drips down and collects at the bottom, often in a built-in pan called a hotwell. The shell side often operates at a vacuum or partial vacuum, produced by the difference in specific volume between the steam and condensate. Conversely, the vapor can be fed through the tubes with the coolant water or air flowing around the outside.|$|E
50|$|Tubular Forced Circulation Evaporators employs an axial {{circulation}} pump which navigates {{the flow of}} liquid in a circular motion through the system’s heat exchanger {{in which it is}} superheated. Thereafter, when the liquid reaches the separator the liquid pressure decreases dramatically forcing a portion of the liquid to be rapidly boiled off. This design is specifically for products and/ or particulates with a diameter of over 2mm. As the evaporation action occurs only in the separator and not in the heat exchanger, fouling is reduced despite higher levels of turbulence in the design. Alternatively, another design parameter is the optimisation of liquid velocity in the <b>tube</b> <b>side</b> flow which is regulated by the {{circulation pump}}.|$|E
5000|$|In {{commercial}} power plants, {{there are}} two to four steam generators per reactor; each steam generator can measure up to 70 ft in height and weigh as much as 800 tons. Each steam generator can contain anywhere from 3,000 to 16,000 tubes, each about [...]75 in in diameter. The coolant (treated water), which is maintained at high pressure to prevent boiling, is pumped through the nuclear reactor core. Heat transfer takes place between the reactor core and the circulating water and the coolant is then pumped through the primary <b>tube</b> <b>side</b> of the steam generator by coolant pumps {{before returning to the}} reactor core.

50|$|The {{temperature}} difference which is log mean {{temperature difference}} between the heating media and the boiling liquid must be high enough to generate sufficient ascending force of the steam vapour in the <b>tube</b> <b>side</b> to force the liquid film to flow upwards. In general, the greater the temperature difference, the better {{the driving force of}} the steam. Additionally, having a high temperature difference will also increase the flow rate of the liquid and vapour within the tube. This increase in flow rate causes higher turbulence which results in an increase of the heat transfer coefficient. However, the overall temperature difference has to be within the range of boiling points of the two components as it could affect the quality and the purity of the products.|$|E
50|$|The {{reactor vessel}} holds 764 fuel {{assemblies}} and 185 control rods which modulate the power. The fuel assemblies are about 6 inches square by about 12 feet long. The turbine generator is an English Electric unit, {{but the company}} {{changed its name to}} General Electric Company later. Water flowing through the reactor vessel changes to saturated steam and then travels to the main turbine-generator to produce electricity. After that, the steam drops into a main condenser where it is condensed to liquid water and is recycled. A secondary loop of water which enters the <b>tube</b> <b>side</b> of the condenser is non-radioactive. It flows to two large cooling towers which stand 400 feet tall where the hot water is cooled by natural circulation with ambient air. This is a closed loop with only a small amount of make-up water needed from Lake Erie to replace any evaporation.|$|E

50|$|The {{flowers are}} usually borne singly, {{sometimes}} {{in groups of}} up to 3, in leaf axils on a hairy stalk 3.5-12 mm long. There are 5 green to purplish, overlapping sepals which differ in shape from each other, ranging from egg-shaped to lance-shaped and from 10 to 13 mm long. Both surfaces of the sepals are mostly glabrous except for the margins. The petals are 18-21 mm long and are joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is purple with darker bands inside the <b>tube</b> <b>side</b> walls. The outside of the petal lobes {{and most of the}} tube are hairy, the inside of the lobes is glabrous and the inside of the tube is filled with woolly hairs. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed in the petal tube.

5000|$|To {{be able to}} {{transfer}} heat well, the tube material should have good thermal conductivity. Because heat is transferred from a hot to a cold side through the tubes, there is a temperature difference through {{the width of the}} tubes. Because of the tendency of the tube material to thermally expand differently at various temperatures, thermal stresses occur during operation. This is in addition to any stress from high pressures from the fluids themselves. The tube material also should be compatible with both the shell and <b>tube</b> <b>side</b> fluids for long periods under the operating conditions (temperatures, pressures, pH, etc.) to minimize deterioration such as corrosion. All of these requirements call for careful selection of strong, thermally-conductive, corrosion-resistant, high quality tube materials, typically metals, including aluminium, copper alloy, stainless steel, carbon steel, non-ferrous copper alloy, Inconel, nickel, Hastelloy and titanium. [...] Fluoropolymers such as Perfluoroalkoxy alkane (PFA) and Fluorinated ethylene propylene (FEP) are also used to produce the tubing material due to their high resistance to extreme temperatures. Poor choice of tube material could result in a leak through a tube between the shell and tube sides causing fluid cross-contamination and possibly loss of pressure.|$|E
5000|$|There can be many {{variations}} on the shell and tube design. Typically, the ends of each tube are connected to plenums (sometimes called water boxes) through holes in tubesheets. The tubes may be straight or bent {{in the shape of}} a U, called U-tubes. [...] In nuclear power plants called pressurized water reactors, large heat exchangers called steam generators are two-phase, shell-and-tube heat exchangers which typically have U-tubes. They are used to boil water recycled from a surface condenser into steam to drive a turbine to produce power. Most shell-and-tube heat exchangers are either 1, 2, or 4 pass designs on the <b>tube</b> <b>side.</b> This refers to the number of times the fluid in the tubes passes through the fluid in the shell. In a single pass heat exchanger, the fluid goes in one end of each tube and out the other. [...] Surface condensers in power plants are often 1-pass straight-tube heat exchangers (see Surface condenser for diagram). Two and four pass designs are common because the fluid can enter and exit on the same side. This makes construction much simpler. There are often baffles directing flow through the shell side so the fluid does not take a short cut through the shell side leaving ineffective low flow volumes. These are generally attached to the tube bundle rather than the shell in order that the bundle is still removable for maintenance.|$|E
