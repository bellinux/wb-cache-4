5|$|The Smoking Man seeks Gibson Praise, who is {{undergoing}} brain surgery {{at that very}} moment. Mulder and Scully head to the home where the alien gestated, finding an alien's nail in the wall. The Smoking Man arrives soon after with Gibson, who tells him that the alien is no longer there. At <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> plant, the alien kills another person, but Mulder and Scully are denied access by Spender and Fowley. Upon returning to their car they find Gibson inside, who has escaped from The Smoking Man. Later that night, Fowley tells Mulder she was offered the X-Files and is protecting his interest. Mulder leaves Gibson with Scully and heads off with her. Mulder and Fowley believe the alien is seeking heat, {{which is why it}} is in <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> plant. Inside they find organic material on the ground and cooling pipes.|$|E
5|$|Bulgaria's {{strategic}} {{geographic location}} and well-developed energy sector {{make it a}} key European energy centre despite its lack of significant fossil fuel deposits. Nearly 34 percent of its electricity is produced by <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> station at Kozloduy and public opinion strongly supports nuclear energy development. The rapid expansion of alternative energy sources such as wind and solar power stations make Bulgaria {{one of the fastest-growing}} wind energy producers in the world. The country aims to produce 16 percent of its electricity from renewable energy sources by 2020.|$|E
50|$|The {{evidence}} that Ticehurst presents {{is that just}} as in 1899 there was a disagreement between the great powers and the minor powers {{that lead to the}} formulation of the Clause, so in 1996 a similar divergence of views exists between <b>the</b> declared <b>nuclear</b> <b>powers</b> and <b>the</b> non <b>nuclear</b> <b>powers</b> with <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>powers</b> taking a narrow view of the Clause and <b>the</b> non <b>nuclear</b> <b>powers</b> taking a more expansive view.|$|R

5|$|In 2011, Kalam was criticised {{by civil}} groups over his {{stand on the}} Koodankulam Nuclear Power Plant; he {{supported}} the establishment of <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> plant and was accused of not speaking with the local people. The protesters were hostile to his visit as they saw him as a pro-nuclear scientist and were unimpressed by the assurances he provided regarding the safety features of the plant.|$|E
5|$|Large {{stockpiles}} of weapons-grade plutonium were built up {{by both the}} Soviet Union and the United States during the Cold War. The U.S. reactors at Hanford and the Savannah River Site in South Carolina produced 103tonnes, and an estimated 170tonnes of military-grade plutonium was produced in the USSR. Each year about 20tonnes of the element is still produced as a by-product of <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> industry. As much as 1000tonnes of plutonium may be in storage with more than 200tonnes of that either inside or extracted from nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|Unsatisfied {{with his}} own efforts, Homer takes on the biggest danger in Springfield, <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> plant. After Homer rallies people to his cause, Mr. Burns decides to end the furor he is {{creating}} by offering him a new position as the plant safety inspector, along with a higher salary. Homer, torn between his principles and his livelihood, tearfully tells his followers that they must fight their battles alone {{from this point on}} and takes the job.|$|E

5|$|The Three Mile Island {{power station}} is near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania in the United States. The {{accident}} described in Three Mile Island began on Wednesday, March 28, 1979, and ultimately {{resulted in a}} partial core meltdown in Unit 2 of <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> plant. Unit 2's pressurized water reactor was of 900 MWe capacity. The scope and complexity of this reactor accident became clear {{over the course of}} five days, as a number of agencies at the local, state and federal levels tried to solve the problem and decide whether the ongoing accident required an emergency evacuation, and to what extent.|$|E
5|$|Two {{other factors}} {{have often been}} cited in Stroma's depopulation: the {{building}} of <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> station at nearby Dounreay in the 1950s, which created many new jobs on the mainland, {{and in the same}} decade the construction of a harbour on Stroma on which many islanders were employed. Although it has been claimed that this gave the islanders the incentive (and the means) to leave, local historian Donald A. Young points out that of islanders who left after 1945, only one went directly from Stroma to Dounreay. Most of the rest either continued fishing or carried on crofting on the mainland, while others found alternative jobs. Some ex-islanders eventually found jobs at Dounreay, but they had already moved to the mainland for work or education.|$|E
5|$|Belgium {{has seven}} nuclear {{reactors}} that provide about 52% of its electricity. Belgian {{spent nuclear fuel}} was initially sent for reprocessing in France. In 1993, reprocessing was suspended following {{a resolution of the}} Belgian parliament; spent fuel is since being stored on the sites of <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> plants. The deep disposal of high-level radioactive waste (HLW) has been studied in Belgium for more than 30 years. Boom Clay is studied as a reference host formation for HLW disposal. The Hades underground research laboratory (URL) is located at −223 m in the Boom Formation at the Mol site. The Belgian URL is operated by the Euridice Economic Interest Group, a joint organisation between SCK•CEN, the Belgian Nuclear Research Centre which initiated the research on waste disposal in Belgium in the 1970s and 1980s and ONDRAF/NIRAS, the Belgian agency for radioactive waste management. In Belgium, the regulatory body in charge of guidance and licensing approval is the Federal Agency of Nuclear Control, created in 2001.|$|E

5|$|Spotnitz {{found that}} the main problem with {{developing}} the episode was segueing from a movie that some—but not necessarily all—viewers had seen. The writers sought to bring back characters like Gibson Praise, Diana Fowley and Jeffrey Spender who {{were not in the}} movie. In addition, the writers also wanted to bring back elements that were also seen in the movie, like the alien. Carter claims to have been thinking about what the episode would entail almost two years prior, when he was working on developing The X-Files movie. The character Sandy, who is killed in the teaser sequence, was played by the show's casting director Rick Millikan on the request of Carter. Millikan later joked that he spent most of the shoot on his cell phone casting other individuals for other X-Files episodes. One of <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> plant workers is named Homer, a reference to Homer Simpson, one of the main characters from the animated Fox television series The Simpsons.|$|E
5|$|The 1789 {{discovery}} of uranium in the mineral pitchblende is credited to Martin Heinrich Klaproth, who named the new element after the planet Uranus. Eugène-Melchior Péligot {{was the first}} person to isolate the metal and its radioactive properties were discovered in 1896 by Henri Becquerel. Research by Otto Hahn, Lise Meitner, Enrico Fermi and others, such as J. Robert Oppenheimer starting in 1934 led to its use as a fuel in <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> industry and in Little Boy, the first nuclear weapon used in war. An ensuing arms race during the Cold War between the United States and the Soviet Union produced tens of thousands of nuclear weapons that used uranium metal and uranium-derived plutonium-239. The security of those weapons and their fissile material following the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 is an ongoing concern for public health and safety. See Nuclear proliferation.|$|E
5|$|Cavallo began {{a second}} wave of privatizations with the Correo Argentino and <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> plants. He also limited {{the amount of money}} {{released}} to the provinces. He still had the full support of Menem, despite growing opposition within the PJ. The Mexican Tequila Crisis impacted the national economy, causing a deficit, recession, and a growth in unemployment. The government further reduced public expenditures, the wages of state workers, and raised taxes. The deficit and recession were reduced, but unemployment stayed high. External debt increased. The crisis also proved that the economic system was vulnerable to capital flight. The growing discontent over unemployment and the scandals caused by the privatization of the Correo led to Cavallo's removal as minister, and his replacement by Roque Fernández. Fernández maintained Cavallo's fiscal austerity. He increased the price of fuels, sold the state shares of YPF to Repsol, fired state employees, and increased the value-added tax to 21%. He also undertook more privatization. A new labor law was met with resistance, both by Peronists, opposition parties, and unions, and could not be approved by Congress. The 1997 Asian financial crisis and the 1998 Russian financial crisis also affected the country with consequences that lasted longer than the Tequilla Crisis and started a depression.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} refuel their nuclear power plants, the {{carriers}} each undergo a Refueling and Overhaul (RCOH) once in their service lives. This {{is also the}} most substantial overhaul the ships undergo while in service and involves bringing the vessels' equipment up to the standards of the newest ships. The ship is placed in dry dock, and essential maintenance is carried out including painting of the hull below the waterline and replacement of electrical and mechanical components such as valves. Because of the large time periods between the ships' constructions, the armament and designs of the newer ships are more modern than those of the older ships. In RCOH, the older ships are refitted to the standards of the newer ships, which can include major upgrades to the flight deck, aircraft catapults and combat systems as well as other upgrades such as improved radar systems, although precise details can vary significantly between the ships. The improvements normally take around four years to complete. The RCOH for USS Theodore Roosevelt took four years to complete (2009–2013) and cost about US$2.6 billion. Planned Incremental Availability is a similar procedure, although it is less substantial and does not involve refueling of <b>the</b> <b>nuclear</b> <b>power</b> plants.|$|E
