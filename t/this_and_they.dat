5|$|Chelicerates were {{originally}} predators, {{but the group}} has diversified to use all the major feeding strategies: predation, parasitism, herbivory, scavenging and eating decaying organic matter. Although harvestmen can digest solid food, the guts of most modern chelicerates are too narrow for <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> generally liquidize their food by grinding it with their chelicerae and pedipalps and flooding it with digestive enzymes. To conserve water, air-breathing chelicerates excrete waste as solids that are removed from their blood by Malpighian tubules, structures that also evolved independently in insects. While the marine horseshoe crabs rely on external fertilization, air-breathing chelicerates use internal but usually indirect fertilization. Predatory species generally use elaborate courtship rituals to prevent males from being eaten before they can mate. Most lay eggs that hatch as what look like miniature adults, but all scorpions and a few species of mites keep the eggs inside their bodies until the young emerge. In most chelicerate species the young have to fend for themselves, but in scorpions and some species of spider the females protect and feed their young.|$|E
5|$|Miles {{turns up}} in Summer Bay {{and decides to}} stick around after he thinks it is a {{familiar}} setting. He has nowhere to live and is starving. Irene Roberts (Lynne McGranger) becomes annoyed with him for stealing food out of the bins, but Roman Harris (Conrad Coleby) takes pity on him and feeds him. He sees Sally {{on the beach and}} writes Milco in the sand. They later become friends and she feels like she has a close connection. He reveals his family's death to be the reason why he became a drifter. He eventually reveals the truth to Sally, that he is Milco and her twin brother. After it sinks in she is delighted with <b>this</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> become close. Miles stays with her and one night forgets to lock the door. Johnny Cooper (Callan Mulvey) enters the house and stabs Sally, however she survives but he blames himself. He decides to get his life back on track and becomes an English teacher at the school. Aden Jefferies (Todd Lasance) initially gives him a hard time, but he is well liked after he and Ric Dalby (Mark Furze) arrange a leaving party for Sally, who has decided to move away. At the party Steven Matheson (Adam Willits) and Carly Morris (Sharyn Hodgson) are startled to meet the person they heard so much about whilst growing up.|$|E

25|$|The first {{ascent of}} the Matterhorn {{was made by}} Edward Whymper, Lord Francis Douglas, Charles Hudson, Douglas Hadow, Michel Croz, and two Zermatt guides, Peter Taugwalder and his son of the same name, on 14 July 1865. Douglas, Hudson, Hadow and Croz were killed on the descent when Hadow slipped and pulled the other three with him down the north face. Whymper and the Taugwalder guides, who survived, were later accused of having cut the rope below {{to ensure that they}} were not dragged down with the others, but the {{subsequent}} inquiry found no evidence of <b>this</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> were acquitted.|$|E
25|$|Zimbabwe, naturally, {{could not}} answer <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> were {{up against a}} much {{stronger}} bowling attack than their own. The openers Brendan Taylor and Stuart Carlisle survived 14 overs, scoring 62 runs, but Chris Cairns and Andre Adams inspired a collapse to 123 for 6. At one point, Zimbabwe threatened to break the record of highest ODI defeat ever (256 runs), but 45 from Heath Streak, including two sixes, took them past 200. Overall, 205 all out wasn't such a bad score. The problem {{was that they had}} been so utterly demolished in the first innings – and two days later, they were to meet India's feared batting line-up, including people like Sourav Ganguly, Rahul Dravid and Virender Sehwag.|$|E
25|$|There {{were several}} aspects of Nixon's life that were not brought to the {{attention}} of the jury. He had twice saved people from death — once a drowning boy in a flooded irrigation ditch and the other a woman from a burning plane crash at Houston International Airport (now William P. Hobby Airport) in 1966. He had volunteered to serve in the United States Navy during World War II and received an honorable discharge. He later enlisted in the United States Army, getting a hardship discharge after his father abandoned his mother. Nixon did not tell his lawyers any of <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> had to discover it through their own private investigations.|$|E

25|$|Sri Lanka {{got off to}} a bad {{start with}} wicketkeeper Rohan Jayasekera dropped opening batsman Graham Gooch off the very first {{delivery}} from Ashantha de Mel. The English opening pair took their team's score to 55 before Geoff Cook was dismissed as their first wicket. When the next batsman, David Gower, was run out with England's total on 83, Ian Botham joined Gooch at the crease and put together a strong partnership. At one stage, these two batsmen scored 43 runs off 5 overs. Gooch was dropped two more times before he was dismissed for 64 with the total on 152, followed by Botham with their team total on 191. However, the English batting collapsed after <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> were all out for 211 in the last over of the innings.|$|E
25|$|Poirot {{arrives in}} the middle of the night. They tell him the {{sequence}} of events and their suspicions regarding Mrs. Vanderlyn. Investigating the grass leading off the terrace, Poirot confirms that there are no footprints, which means that someone in the house committed the theft and the papers are still there. He questions each person in turn. He understands that Leonie saw no ghost; she screamed because Reggie sneaked up on her to snatch a kiss. Poirot suggests to Lord Charles that he end the party so that his guests will leave the house. The next morning the guests begin to leave. Lady Julia believes that her son Reggie stole the plans since he is very short of money and was not in his room for a period the previous evening. She promises Poirot that they will be returned within twelve hours if no further action is taken. Poirot agrees to <b>this</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> all depart.|$|E

Cherones said that Padnick was relieved to hear <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> both discussed the problem with Charles, and decided not to use the script. Commenting on the episode, Charles stated [...] "You know, it would have been an interesting show, but [...] we couldn't solve the funny problem of it. It never seemed to quite be as funny as it should be and, because of that, the balance was off and the darkness kind of enveloped it, and it could never really emerge from that darkness and become what it should have been. So, it was disappointing but also understandable." [...] The replacement episode called [...] "The Phone Message" [...] was written by David and Seinfeld in two days.|$|E

500|$|Fox left Wellington in late July 1888 for the Caucasus Mountains in the Russian Empire, joining up with William Frederick Donkin and Clinton Dent. The {{three were}} aiming {{to become the}} first climbers to scale Koshtan-Tau, one of the few {{mountains}} in the region yet to be scaled. The three started from Nalchik, though Dent was forced to return home due to ill-health, leaving Fox and Donkin to attempt the climb, along with two Swiss guides. Their initial plan was to climb a glacier on the northern slopes of the mountain, and then make their final ascent on the western side. However, a rock wall on the western slopes prevented <b>this,</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> changed their plans to attack the mountain from the east. They planned to meet up with their outfitter to the south-east of the mountain, but after they missed that meeting, a message was sent back to Dent reporting the climbers missing. The Times reported on 6 October that Donkin and Fox, along with their guides, had suffered a mountaineering accident that had led [...] "to the almost certain loss of four lives".|$|E
500|$|In 1538, {{the king}} and Cromwell {{arranged}} with Lutheran princes to have detailed discussions on forming a political and religious alliance. Henry had been seeking a new embassy from the Schmalkaldic League since summer 1537. The Lutherans were delighted by <b>this</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> sent a joint delegation from various German cities, including a colleague of Martin Luther, Friedrich Myconius. The delegates arrived in England on 27 May 1538. After initial meetings with the king, Cromwell, and Cranmer, discussions on theological differences were transferred to Lambeth Palace under Cranmer's chairmanship. Progress on an agreement was slow partly due to Cromwell being too busy to help expedite the proceedings and {{partly due to the}} negotiating team on the English side, which was evenly balanced between conservatives and reformers. The talks dragged on through the summer with the Germans becoming weary despite the Archbishop's strenuous efforts. The negotiations, however, were fatally neutralised by an appointee of the king. Cranmer's colleague, Edward Foxe, who sat on Henry's Privy Council, had died earlier in the year. The king chose as his replacement Cranmer's conservative rival, Cuthbert Tunstall, who was told to stay near Henry to give advice. On 5 August, when the German delegates {{sent a letter to the}} king regarding three items that particularly worried them (compulsory clerical celibacy, the withholding of the chalice from the laity, and the maintenance of private masses for the dead), Tunstall was able to intervene for {{the king and}} to influence the decision. The result was a thorough dismissal by the king of many of the Germans' chief concerns. Although Cranmer begged the Germans to continue with the negotiations using the argument [...] "to consider the many thousands of souls in England" [...] at stake, they left on 1 October having made no substantial achievements.|$|E
500|$|In the 1909–10 English winter, MCC toured South Africa {{with a team}} below full Test strength. Rhodes {{opened the}} batting {{throughout}} the tour, partnering Jack Hobbs for the first time. However, Wisden stated that only Hobbs would have been sure of his batting place in a full strength England team, and that both Rhodes and David Denton, the next best batsmen, were a long way behind Hobbs. In all first-class matches, Rhodes scored 499 runs {{at an average of}} 26.26, with three fifties, and took 21 wickets at 25.47. In the Test series, which South Africa won 3–2, Rhodes took only two wickets in the five games. As a batsman, however, he [...] shared some large partnerships with Hobbs. England lost the first two Tests, although in the first Rhodes and Hobbs put on 159 for the first wicket, of which Rhodes made 66. In the second Test the pair put on 94 in the first innings and 48 in the second, Rhodes made little impact on the third and fourth Tests; in the final Test, an England victory, he and Hobbs scored 221 together, Rhodes making what was then his highest Test score of 77. [...] Wisden stated that while overshadowed by the brilliance of Hobbs, Rhodes in this innings batted without mistakes. [...] In the five Tests Rhodes scored 226 runs, [...] averaging 25.11. During the tour Rhodes and Hobbs developed mutual trust while batting together, {{to the point where they}} could score runs without having to call to each other. This degree of understanding was unusual at the time. After the Test series ended, several amateur members of the team wanted to extend the tour into Rhodesia, but the professionals refused to take part as their contracts did not cover <b>this</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> would have effectively played for no wages. Rhodes, although not the ring-leader, was influential in this strike, and a sports newspaper, Winning Post, singled him out as responsible in an article highly critical of him and the other professionals.|$|E

2500|$|The pirates still paid no {{attention}} and continued on with their attempt {{to make it to}} shore so the 4-inch (102-mm) gun was opened up on them again. By this time the L5 had arrived in the area and her crew counted eight muzzle flashes from the L4s deck gun. Lieutenant Gilbert Hackforth Jones reported that they were too far away at that time to open fire themselves, but they could see the Irene burning after being struck by multiple rounds. At that point Lieutenant Halahan signaled the L5 that lifeboats were being lowered from the steamer and that he was maneuvering in to rescue the survivors. The L5 followed suit and both submarines dispatched a boat with one officer and one sailor each to go aboard the burning Irene. The pirates on board were counting on <b>this</b> <b>and</b> <b>they</b> were waiting for the British to move in close before responding and when it came they revealed themselves from their hiding places and opened fire. Their shots were inaccurate though and went {{over the heads of the}} sailors in the boats which then turned around so the submarines could open fire again with their deck guns. After a few additional shots one shot struck something flammable on board the steamer and a large [...] "blinding" [...] explosion was observed. Following that the pirates offered no more resistance and abandoned ship, some of them drowned in the cold water.|$|E
