EGP is best known for manufacturing heat-reflective glass panels for use in high-temperature home appliances such as self-cleaning ovens. In 2002, EGP introduced a glass panel that not only reflected heat but also generated it. These glass panels {{could be used as a}} heating element in home appliances and other commercial applications. EGP marketed these glass panels under the brand name [...] "Thermique heated glass". The first commercial use of <b>Thermique</b> heated glass was in a display case for warm foods. In 2005, EGP introduced a towel warmer with a glass heating element called the <b>Thermique</b> Towel Warmer. That same year, EGP became the first company to earn UL approval to manufacture a heated glass pane for architectural window units. In 2006, EGP created <b>Thermique</b> Technologies as a separate entity in charge of its heated glass products and product development. EGP also continues to manufacture heat-reflective glass under another subsidiary, Marsco Glass Products.|$|E
40|$|Methods of calculating design heat {{requirements}} of embedded snow-melting systems are assessed, particularly for those operating in cold climates. Formulas for estimating design heat requirements developed from snow-melting tests carried out during three winters at Ottawa, Canada, are {{compared with those}} recommended in the Guide and Data Book of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air- Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), the only comprehensive guidelines available in North America. The relation between convective coefficients and wind speed at an exposed site compares reasonably well with that recommended by ASHRAE, provided adjustments are made for {{the size of the}} heated area, the exposure to wind, and the height at which wind speeds are measured. Evaporative coefficients recommended by ASHRAE also need to be adjusted for the size of heated area and the exposure to wind. Radiative coefficients need to be adjusted for cloud conditions. The design heat requirements for systems operating in cold climates are determined by the maximum rate of surface heat loss from bare, wet pavements for weather conditions that will probably prevail immediately after snowstorms. Design heat requirements calculated for an exposed site at Ottawa by using the heat transfer coefficients obtained are 170 Btu/ft[2]-hour (536 W/m[2]). This agrees quite well with current practice in this region. Two case histories of snow-melting tests are presented to illustrate that the use of insulation will practically eliminate ground heat loss and the need to allow for it in design calculations.

40|$|Walls and roofs {{designed}} today often incorporate {{details that}} have a lower resistance to heat flow than the main construction. In general, these details are thermally weak because high-conductivity structural elements project partly or wholly through materials of lower conductivity; in this Digest they {{are referred to as}} "thermal bridges". To provide a basis for recognizing and minimizing the problems presented by thermal bridges, this Digest deals with a few examples and illustrates factors that influence their thermal performance.

The choice of windows {{may be influenced by}} the inside relative humidity conditions desired or anticipated and the amount of condensation that can be tolerated. The thermal limitations of double windows must be recognized in establishing building humidity. For some applications and window constructions it is necessary to determine the surface temperature characteristics by individual tests. For general-purpose rating for thermal performance the test conditions must be standardized, particularly the surrounding construction and the surface heat exchange conditions.

40|$|In thermal {{transformation}} {{processes for}} the production of metal parts of complex shape, shaping tools are frequently used. In die forging as an example, the tools are exposed to high mechanical and thermal loads and therefore subject to heavy wear. For fast feedback directly in the production process the accuracy to size of metal parts produced in such a way is at present frequently checked with groping measuring tools. This is unsatisfactory because of the complex forms, the broad product range and the thermal conditions. A 3 D – measurement system for highest possible flexibility and industrial environment, conceived for this application and based on a 3 D- sensor attached to an industrial robot for positioning is described here. The Structured – Light approach is used, i. e. the sensor consists of one or several CCD- cameras, combined with a programmable line projector. Two different calibration procedures of the line projector system are compared, on the one hand based on a polynomial model with a large number of coefficients, on the other hand based on a model targeted towards the actual optical / physical conditions with a significantly smaller number of coefficients. Finally a procedure for the solution of the Sensor to Hand calibration of the measuring robot is shown.

40|$|The use {{of ancient}} {{temperature}} data need {{knowledge of the}} history of thermometers, of researches done by erudites, of their operating and how they were produced and used. The history of thermometers specifies {{for the first time that}} the thermoscope was invented in 1608 by the Doctor Sanctorius, and that florentine thermometer appeared about 1649 - 1650 resulting of underground researches. The appearance of the meteorological screen at the middle of nineteenth century modified the conditions of observation. A statistical study comparing the two methods of observing the air temperature, highlights the reasons of the main differences. The investigation of manuscript from The Royal Society of Medecine including observations of temperature between 1776 and 1792 shows that in spite of reliability of the doctors, the temperature cannot be used previously to a metrological analysis. The outline of climate of this age done by Le Roy Ladurie deserves to be reviewed using the methodology used in this thesis.

Atmospheric effects can also be corrected using radiative transfer models that require knowledge of atmospheric status. The latter can be accurately characterized from radiosoundings, but these are usually unavailable. It can also be derived from meteorological model simulations, but spatial and temporal resolution are often too coarse. This study proposes performing atmospheric corrections by using temperature and relative humidity profiles acquired in flight from onboard sensors during data collection.

40|$|Thermal {{performance}} plays a {{major role}} in determining the success or failure of a roof system, and it can be controlled to a high degree by the designer. Thermal considerations in the design of roofs can be divided into two general categories: control of heat loss and heat gain of the space below the roof, and the effects of extremes and variations of temperature on the roof system. In Canadian buildings where temperature control through winter heating and summer cooling is common, heat gain and heat loss are of economic importance. Some roofs may only control heat gain by providing shade from the sun, but all roofs exposed to the weather experience wide variations of temperature. The effects of extremes and variations of temperature are of major importance because they influence the durability of the total roof system.

5000|$|After World War I, Milanković {{returned}} to Belgrade {{with his family}} on 19 March 1919. He continued his professorial career, becoming a full professor at the University of Belgrade. From 1912 to 1917, he wrote and published seven papers on mathematical theories of climate both on the Earth {{and on the other}} planets. He formulated a precise, numerical climatological model with the capacity for reconstruction of the past and prediction of the future, and established the astronomical theory of climate as a generalized mathematical theory of insolation. When these most important problems of the theory were solved, and a firm foundation for further work built, Milanković finished a book which was published in 1920, by the Gauthier-Villars in Paris under the title [...] "Théorie mathématique des phénomènes <b>thermiques</b> produits par la radiation solaire" [...] (Mathematical Theory of Heat Phenomena Produced by Solar Radiation). Immediately after the publication of this book in 1920, meteorologists recognized it as a significant contribution to the study of contemporary climate. The works of Vilhelm Bjerknes in 1904, and Lewis Fry Richardson in 1922 are the foundation of modern numerical weather prediction.|$|R
