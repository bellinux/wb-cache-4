40|$|AbstractThe rank {{of a set}} of {{alternatives}} can change if a new criterion is introduced into <b>the</b> set <b>of</b> criteria, but it can also change if <b>the</b> <b>importances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> criteria depend on <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> alternatives and on <b>the</b> strength <b>of</b> their ranking. As a result a new alternative may change <b>the</b> relative order <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous set. This is allowed to happen by making paired comparisons {{of alternatives}} with respect to criteria. It is particularly useful in a complex structure where <b>the</b> <b>importances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> criteria are not well established. If on the other hand they are, then the alternatives can be scored with respect to intensities <b>of</b> <b>the</b> criteria and a new alternative would not change <b>the</b> relative rank <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old ones.
