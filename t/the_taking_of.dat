5|$|Baleen whales {{continue}} to be harvested. However, only three nations take whales: Iceland, Norway, and Japan. All these nations {{are part of the}} IWC, with Norway and Iceland rejecting the moratorium and continuing commercial whaling. Japan, being part of the IWC, whales under the Scientific Permit stated in Article VIII in the Convention for the Regulation of Whaling, which allows <b>the</b> <b>taking</b> <b>of</b> whales for scientific research. Japan has had two main research programs: the Joint Aquatic Resources Permit Application (JARPA) and the Japanese Research Program in the North (JARPN). JARPN is focused in the North Pacific and JARPA around the Antarctic. JARPA mainly caught Antarctic minke whales, catching nearly 7,000; to a far lesser extent, they also caught fin whales. Animal-rights activist groups, such as the Greenpeace, object to Japan's scientific whaling, with some calling it a substitute for commercial whaling. In 2014, the International Court of Justice (the UN judicial branch) banned <b>the</b> <b>taking</b> <b>of</b> whales for any purpose in the Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary; however, Japan refuses to stop whaling and has only promised to cut their annual catches by a third (around 300 whales per year).|$|E
5|$|Because the {{bigeye sand tiger}} is {{encountered}} so infrequently, it has no commercial importance. It {{is caught}} incidentally on longlines and in gillnets and purse seines, though the paucity of captures suggest that it mostly lives in waters too deep for commercial fisheries. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species as Data Deficient, citing a lack of biological and population data. Since 1997, the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) has prohibited <b>the</b> <b>taking</b> <b>of</b> this species in United States waters.|$|E

5|$|Besides these {{international}} initiatives, {{some countries}} {{are taking their}} own actions. New Zealand has banned <b>the</b> <b>taking</b> <b>of</b> manta rays since {{the introduction of the}} Wildlife Act in 1953. In June 1995, the Maldives banned the export of all ray species and their body parts, effectively putting a stop to manta fishing as there had not previously been a fishery for local consumption. The government reinforced this in 2009 with the introduction of two marine protected areas. In the Philippines, <b>the</b> <b>taking</b> <b>of</b> mantas was banned in 1998, but this was overturned in 1999 under pressure from local fishermen. Fish stocks were surveyed in 2002, and the ban was reintroduced. The taking or killing of mantas in Mexican waters was prohibited in 2007. This ban may not be strictly enforced, but laws are being more rigidly applied at Isla Holbox, an island off the Yucatán Peninsula, where manta rays are used to attract tourists.|$|E
5|$|Details of {{the modern}} climate record are known through <b>the</b> <b>taking</b> <b>of</b> {{measurements}} from such weather instruments as thermometers, barometers, and anemometers {{during the past few}} centuries.

5|$|Following {{the end of}} {{the civil}} {{conflict}} came a small lull in fighting between the expanding Ottomans and Byzantines. In 1361 Didymoteichon fell to the Turks. Orhan's successor, Murad I was more concerned with his Anatolian positions. However, just like Alp Arslan of the Seljuk Turks, Murad I left <b>the</b> <b>taking</b> <b>of</b> Byzantine territory to his vassals with Philippopolis falling after major campaigning between 1363–4 and Adrianople succumbing to the Ottomans in 1369.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, the FAA {{mandates}} <b>the</b> <b>taking</b> <b>of</b> weather observations at larger airports {{for safety}} reasons. To help facilitate {{the purchase of}} an automated airport weather station, such as ASOS, the FAA allows federal dollars {{to be used for}} the installation of certified weather stations at airports. The airport observations are then transmitted worldwide using the METAR observing code. METAR reports typically come from airports or permanent weather observation stations. Reports are generated once an hour; however, if conditions change significantly, they may be updated in special reports called SPECIs.|$|E

5|$|Nicolls {{participated in}} an {{unsuccessful}} land and naval attack on Fort Bowyer on 15 September.

There, Nicolls regrouped at Prospect Bluff, and rallied Indians and refugee ex-slaves living free in Florida, recruiting the latter into his detached unit of the Corps of Colonial Marines.|$|E
5|$|On 10 and 11 April 1994, {{during the}} Bosnian War, the United Nations Protection Force called in air strikes {{to protect the}} Goražde safe area, {{resulting}} in the bombing of a Bosnian Serb military command outpost near Goražde by two US F-16 jets acting under NATO direction. This resulted in <b>the</b> <b>taking</b> <b>of</b> 150U.N. personnel hostage on 14April. On 16April a British Sea Harrier was shot down over Goražde by Serb forces. A two-week NATO bombing campaign, Operation Deliberate Force, began in August 1995 against the Army of the Republika Srpska, after the Srebrenica massacre.|$|E
5|$|Paracetamol {{poisoning}} {{can occur}} accidentally {{or as an}} attempt to end one's life. Risk factors for toxicity include alcoholism, malnutrition, and <b>the</b> <b>taking</b> <b>of</b> certain other medications. Liver damage results not from paracetamol itself, but from one of its metabolites, N-acetyl-p-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI). NAPQI decreases the liver's glutathione and directly damages cells in the liver. Diagnosis is based on the blood level of paracetamol at specific times after the medication was taken. These values are often plotted on the Rumack-Matthew nomogram to determine level of concern.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} was {{confused by the}} legal position. Disturbing a grave was a criminal offence, as was <b>the</b> <b>taking</b> <b>of</b> property from the deceased. Stealing the body was not an offence, as it did not legally belong to anyone. The price per corpse changed depending on the season. It was £8 during the summer, when the warmer temperatures brought on quicker decomposition, and £10 in the winter months, when the demand by anatomists was greater, because the colder temperatures meant they could store corpses longer so they undertook more dissections.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>taking</b> <b>of</b> black swans to Europe in the 18th {{and early}} 19th centuries brought the birds {{into contact with}} another aspect of European mythology: the {{attribution}} of sinister relationships between the devil and black-coloured animals, such as a black cat.

This may explain why black swans have never established a sizeable presence as feral animals in Europe or North America.|$|E
