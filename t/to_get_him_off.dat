5|$|Meryl gets a {{voicemail}} from Sully, and Veronica {{agrees to}} track her. Veronica and Keith have another fight, with Veronica insulting his character {{for having a}} relationship with Harmony. Veronica and Meryl track the cell phone in the Fitzpatricks’ bar. Liam Fitzpatrick drunkenly picks up Veronica and carries her around, but Vinnie supposedly takes {{a picture of it}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>off</b> her. Veronica and Meryl go to the police station and find that Sully washed up on shore after surfing with a bump on his head and had mild amnesia. While cleared, Mercer is still being held in custody.

There is a buzzing sound the scene cuts to a nearby Logan hearing the alarm. Logan finds Veronica's car with her unconscious on the ground next to it. He picks her up to reveal some locks of Veronica's hair on the ground and a bald spot {{on the back of her}} head.|$|E
500|$|In one storyline, Aden loans {{money from}} [...] "shady bookie" [...] Clint Mailer (Matt Zeremes). Clint then forces Aden to throw {{football}} matches so Clint can win bets. Aden {{is described as}} being desperate for money so goes along with the plan. Geoff finds out and is [...] "appalled" [...] by Aden's behaviour, as the storyline progresses Clint tries {{to force him to}} end Geoff's career. Lasance added, [...] "Aden tries <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>off</b> the field, but that backfires - and Geoff scores the winning try." [...] This results in Aden being badly assaulted by Clint.|$|E

50|$|On December 21, 2010 Guillermo Rivarola {{was named}} Manager of Sporting Cristal from Peruvian First Division League for the 2011 season.

500|$|Although Washington and {{his aides}} arrived from the command post at Harlem Heights soon after the landing began, {{they were unable to}} rally the {{retreating}} militia. About a mile (1.6km) inland from Kip's Bay, Washington rode his horse among the men, trying to turn them around and impose some order on them, cursing furiously and violently. By some accounts, he lost control of his temper; he brandished a cocked pistol and drew his sword, threatening to run men through and shouted, [...] "Take the walls! Take the cornfield!" [...] When no one obeyed, he threw his hat to the ground, exclaiming in disgust, [...] "Are these the men with which I am to defend America?" [...] When some fleeing men refused to turn and engage a party of advancing Hessians, Washington reportedly struck some of their officers with his riding crop. The Hessians shot or bayoneted a number of American troops who were trying to surrender. Two thousand Continental Army troops under the command of Generals Samuel Parsons and John Fellows arrived from the north, but {{at the sight of the}} chaotic militia retreat, they also turned and fled. Washington, still in a rage, rode within a hundred yards of the enemy before his aides managed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>off</b> the field. More and more British soldiers came ashore, including light infantry, grenadiers, and Hessian Jägers. They spread out, advancing in several directions. By late afternoon another 9,000 British troops had landed at Kip's Bay, and Howe had sent a brigade toward New York City, officially taking possession. While most of the Americans managed to escape to the north, not all got away. [...] "I saw a Hessian sever a rebel's head from his body and clap it on a pole in the entrenchments," [...] recorded a British officer. The southern advance pushed for a half mile (0.8km) to Watts farm (near present-day 23rd Street) before meeting stiff American resistance. The northern advance stopped at the Inclenberg (now Murray Hill, a rise west of Kip's Bay), just west of the present Lexington Avenue, under orders from General Howe to wait for the rest of the invading force. This was extremely fortunate for the thousands of American troops south of the invasion point. Had Clinton continued west to the Hudson he would have cut off General Putnam's troops, nearly one third of Washington's forces, from the main army, trapping them in lower Manhattan.|$|E
2500|$|Jason Holland testified he {{was drunk}} and lagging behind the others and did not see how the {{argument}} between his brother Micah and McLoren started. [...] As he entered, the two dropped their heads and started fighting. [...] Brandon Hein, 18, jumped into the fight, as did Jason, {{who says he was}} trying to get the bigger McLoren off his brother Micah's back. [...] Jason opened a folding pocketknife and [...] "pricked" [...] McLoren twice in the back <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>off</b> his brother, then stabbed him in the chest. [...] When Farris entered the fort to help McLoren, Jason stabbed him twice and Hein punched him in the head and face. [...] McLoren survived his wounds but Farris died in the emergency room. [...] When Jason Holland learned from his mother that he was wanted for murder, he went into hiding but several weeks later voluntarily surrendered.|$|E
2500|$|... "I have a countryman of ours with me, who {{was pinned}} on me by {{our friends in}} London. I was ordered to put him into your hands, and I long for an {{opportunity}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>off</b> my own. I don’t {{know if he was}} designed for my guide, but I find myself under a necessity of being his, for to take him out of his wooden world, he knows no more about travelling than a child of six. He is in a prodigious hurry to be at Dunkirk before Saturday. I wish to God he maybe soon wanted. He is in such haste that I was forced to go halves with him in hiring a packet boat at the rate of £5 on purpose to be almost “drounded,” or what was very near as extravagant a reason, to humour my fellow traveller, for we came over in so prodigious a storm that nothing but our light heads could have kept us from the bottom." ...|$|E

5000|$|Ratcliffe was {{renowned for}} his robust {{approach}} to the game and for being a tough tackler. He was sent off {{early in his career}} for a head butt in 1981 on Tommy Hutchison against Manchester City in 1981. He was also involved in an infamous incident with Vinnie Jones in 1989 against Wimbledon. In a bad tempered match, Jones had put in a late tackle against striker Graeme Sharp flooring him, and Ratcliffe steamed forward to challenge Jones aggressively. Jones brushed his head forward {{in what appeared to be}} a headbutt, with Ratcliffe going down. Jones later claimed in his autobiography that his head barely touched Ratcliffe's and Ratcliffe had feigned contact <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> sent <b>off,</b> and expressed disappointment at the dishonesty of his fellow [...] "hard man". This was later confirmed in Graeme Sharp's book, Sharpy, My Story when he admitted both him and Ratcliffe exaggerated Jones's contact on them both <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> sent <b>off</b> <b>to</b> their pleasure.|$|R
50|$|Rick, Jaka's ex-husband from Jaka's Story, {{unexpectedly}} {{shows up}} in the tavern that Cerebus has inhabited for the duration of Guys. Rick is writing a book about his relationship with Jaka. He looks up to Cerebus and constantly pesters him for advice. Cerebus feels like his babysitter and constantly tries <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Rick <b>to</b> leave, even try <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> married <b>off</b> <b>to</b> Joanne from Minds, who has also shown up. Rick has descended into religious madness, and starts telling the story of Cerebus as an angel/demon in faux-King James Bible-style English.|$|R
2500|$|In 1922, {{while in}} Europe for General Patrick, Mitchell met the Italian air power theorist Giulio Douhet and soon {{afterwards}} an excerpted translation of Douhet's The Command of the Air began to circulate in the Air Service. In 1924, Gen. Patrick again dispatched him on an inspection tour, {{this time to}} Hawaii and Asia, <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>off</b> the front pages. Mitchell {{came back with a}} 324-page report that predicted future war with Japan, including the attack on Pearl Harbor. Of note, Mitchell discounted the value of aircraft carriers in an attack on the Hawaiian Islands, believing they were of little practical use because they were incapable of operating effectively on the high seas, nor capable of delivering [...] "sufficient aircraft in the air at one time to insure a concentrated operation." [...] Mitchell believed instead, a surprise attack on the Hawaiian Islands would be conducted by land-based aircraft operating from islands in the Pacific. His report, published in 1925 as the book Winged Defense, foretold wider benefits of an investment in air power, believing it at the time, and for the future, [...] " [...] a dominating factor in the world's development", both for national defense and economic benefit. Winged Defense sold only 4,500copies between August 1925 and January 1926, the months surrounding the publicity of the court martial, and so Mitchell did not reach a wide audience.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2017, Jack Off Jill vocalist Jessicka Addams {{alleged that}} she was sexually {{assaulted}} by the band's bassist Twiggy Ramirez in their shared apartment while the pair were a couple in the mid-90s. She wrote on Facebook: [...] "He forced me on {{to the floor with}} his hand around my neck. I said NO. I said it so loud enough, that my friend Pete came rushing in from the other room <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>off</b> of me. But I had been raped. I had been raped by somebody I thought I loved." [...] Manson responded: [...] "I knew Jessicka and Twiggy had a romantic relationship many years ago and I considered and still consider Jessicka to be a friend. I knew nothing about these allegations until very recently and am saddened by Jessicka's obvious distress." [...] Soon after, Manson announced on Twitter that Twiggy had been fired from the band. Several days later, Twiggy said in a statement: [...] "I have only recently been made aware of these allegations from over 20 years ago. I do not condone non-consensual sex of any kind. I will be taking some time to spend with my family and focus on maintaining my several years of sobriety. If I have caused anyone pain, I apologize and truly regret it." ...|$|E
2500|$|The 2003 {{event was}} {{disrupted}} by a defrocked priest, Cornelius Horan, who ran onto the Hangar Straight {{during the race}} while cars were coming at him at 160+ mph. Marshals were able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>off</b> the track before he hurt himself or anyone else and he was later arrested; Brazilian Rubens Barrichello won the race for Ferrari. A dispute between Silverstone's owners, the British Racing Drivers' Club (BRDC), and the Formula One authorities in 2003 over the funding of necessary improvements to the track's facilities led to doubts {{over the future of}} the race. In October 2004 the British Grand Prix was left off the preliminary race schedule for 2005 because the BRDC refused to pay the race fee demanded by Bernie Ecclestone. However, after months of negotiation between the BRDC, Ecclestone and the Formula One constructors, a deal was made for the Grand Prix to be held at Silverstone until 2009. 2008 saw Briton Lewis Hamilton win for McLaren; and on 4 July, it was announced that Donington Park had been awarded the contract to host the British Grand Prix for 10 years from 2010. However, Donington failed to secure the necessary funding to host the race, and its contract was terminated in November 2009. On 7 December 2009, Silverstone signed a 17-year contract to host the British Grand Prix from 2010 onwards. The 2010 race saw a new circuit configuration being used, using the brand new [...] "Arena" [...] layout. For 2011 a new pit complex was built between Club and Abbey Corners, to where the start/finish line was moved. Silverstone is still a very fast circuit- with average speeds up in the 145mph range for Formula 1 cars; one of the highest average speeds on the F1 calendar.|$|E
5000|$|Ron Washington {{and first}} base coach Gary Pettis were both {{ejected from the}} July 3 game after a close call by first base umpire Ángel Hernández. Washington did not engage in the {{argument}} between Pettis and Hernández, but began yelling at the umpire after Hernández, according to Washington, [...] "told me my job is <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> (Pettis) <b>off</b> the field. You don't tell me what my job is..... You can't talk to Angel. Angel is the smartest umpire in baseball." [...] Washington was later fined for his comments.|$|R
5000|$|During {{the course}} of The Next Iron Chef, many people {{perceived}} Knowlton as being too hard on Chef Aarón Sanchez. Anthony Bourdain said that [...] "Knowlton {{seems not to have}} disclosed a prior schoolyard incident with a young Aaron [...] "El Guapo" [...] Sanchez—in which Sanchez (it would appear) bullied him mercilessly. He seemed unnaturally eager to send him packing." [...] Michael Ruhlman referred to Knowlton as [...] "cranky," [...] and said Knowlton [...] "is every bit the menace he appears. And it was hard <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>to</b> know <b>him</b> <b>off</b> camera—he had a lot of handlers, so it was difficult <b>to</b> <b>get</b> any time with him." [...] Ruhlman intended the comments as a joke, but people responding on his website and others let go on Knowlton with abandon.|$|R
5000|$|Miller {{would later}} tell American Enterprise {{that one of}} the reasons he became more {{conservative}} was due to liberal critiques of Mayor Rudy Giuliani's approach to fighting crime in New York City (which began around 1994). [...] "When I kept hearing liberals equating Giuliani with Hitler--that's when I really left the reservation. Even before 9/11, I'd travel to New York and say, 'Wow, this city certainly seems to be running better. Giuliani is the kind of leader I admire. When it's five below zero and you arrest somebody <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> inside <b>off</b> the street--that's not something Hitler would do. It made me realize that I was with the wrong group if that's what Hitler looked like to them." ...|$|R

5000|$|In 2010, Pathways to Housing set up {{a mobile}} video exhibit at nine {{locations}} in New York City where there were over 36,000 homeless people in 2009. [...] The exhibit featured {{an image of a}} homeless man sleeping on the sidewalk in downtown Manhattan projected on to a building. Words also projected asked passersby to send a text message <b>to</b> help <b>get</b> <b>him</b> <b>off</b> the streets. A text message sent triggered a new video loop in which the man gets up and walks in the door of his new apartment. The idea is to convey visually the organization’s approach to combatting homelessness, which emphasizes getting people who are homeless into housing first and then tackling issues like mental health and addiction.|$|R

I {{interposed}} with a few words to the effect of how well aware I was that wherever he should go, whatever he should do, he would miss our old friend terribly--miss him even more than I should, having been with him so much more. This led him to make the speech that has remained with me as the very text of the whole episode.|$|R
50|$|High Noons {{production}} and release also intersected {{with the second}} Red Scare and the Korean War. Foreman was called before HUAC while he was writing the film. Foreman {{had not been in}} the Communist Party for almost ten years, but declined to 'name names' and was considered an 'un-cooperative witness' by HUAC. When Stanley Kramer found out some of this, he forced Foreman to sell his part of their company, and tried <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>him</b> kicked <b>off</b> the making of the picture. Fred Zinnemann, Gary Cooper, and Bruce Church intervened. There was also a problem with the Bank of America loan, as Foreman hadn't yet signed certain papers. Thus Foreman remained on the production, but moved to England before it was released nationally, as he knew he would never be allowed to work in America.|$|R
