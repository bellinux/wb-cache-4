25|$|It is {{important}} <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>where</b> these cultural variations {{come from and}} how they root themselves into differing perceptions of infidelity. While many cultures report infidelity as wrong and admonish it, some are more tolerant of such behavior. These views are generally linked to the overall liberal nature of the society. For instance, Danish society is viewed as more liberal than many other cultures, and as such, have correlating liberal views on infidelity and extramarital affairs. According to Christine Harris and Nicholas Christenfeld (1996), societies that are legally more liberal against extramarital affairs judge less harshly upon sexual infidelity because it is distinct from emotional infidelity. In Danish society, having sex does not necessarily imply a deep emotional attachment. As a result, infidelity does not carry such a severe negative connotation (Harris and Christenfeld).|$|E

2500|$|In his book, Fischer {{brings up}} several points.

Rather, there are only four regional cultures as described above, and understanding this helps one to more clearly understand American history as well as contemporary American life. Fischer asserts {{that it is not}} only important <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>where</b> different groups came from, but when. All population groups have, at different times, their own unique set of beliefs, fears, hopes and prejudices. When different groups came to America and brought certain beliefs and values with them, these ideas became, according to Fischer, more or less frozen in time, even if they eventually changed in their original place of origin.|$|E
2500|$|Regardless of the {{validity}} of, or benefit of, belief in free will, it may be beneficial <b>to</b> <b>understand</b> <b>where</b> the idea comes from. [...] One contribution is randomness. [...] While it is established that that randomness {{is not the only}} factor in the perception of the free will, {{it has been shown that}} randomness can be mistaken as free will due to its indeterminacy. [...] This misconception applies both when considering oneself and others. Another contribution is choice. It has been demonstrated that people’s belief in free will increases if presented with a simple level of choice. The specificity of the amount of choice is important, as too little or too great a degree of choice may negatively influence belief. It is also likely that the associative relationship between level of choice and perception of free will is influentially bidirectional. [...] It is also possible that one’s desire for control, or other basic motivational patterns, act as a third variable.|$|E
