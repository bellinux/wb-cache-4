5|$|An eclipse is {{a natural}} phenomenon. However, in some ancient and modern cultures, solar eclipses were {{attributed}} to supernatural causes or regarded as bad omens. A total solar eclipse can be frightening <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> unaware of its astronomical explanation, as the Sun seems to disappear {{during the day and}} the sky darkens in a matter of minutes.|$|E

Those who do not must repay the AOG. Marion Military Institute, New Mexico Military Institute, Georgia Military College, Hargrave Military Academy, Greystone Preparatory School at Schreiner University, and Northwestern Preparatory School are approved programs that students attend on the AOG scholarship prior to admission to West Point.|$|E
5|$|The initialism, LGBT, is {{intended}} to emphasize a diversity of sexuality and gender identity-based cultures. It {{may be used to}} refer to anyone who is non-heterosexual or non-cisgender, instead of exclusively <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. To recognize this inclusion, a popular variant adds the letter Q for those who identify as queer or are questioning their sexual identity; LGBTQ has been recorded since 1996. Those who add intersex people to LGBT groups or organizing use an extended initialism LGBTI. Some people combine the two acronyms and use the term LGBTIQ or LGBTQI. Others use LGBT+ to encompass a spectrum of gender and sexuality.|$|E

The unavoidable delay, typing errors, lack of editing, and high cost mean that real-time translation subtitling is in low demand. Allowing the interpreter to directly speak to the viewers is usually both cheaper and quicker; however, the translation is not accessible <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> deaf and hard–of–hearing.|$|E
25|$|We {{knew that}} we had created a new means of warfare, and the {{question}} as to what nation, to what victorious nation we were willing to entrust this brainchild of ours was a moral decision more than anything else. We wanted to see the world spared another conflict such as Germany had just been through, and we felt that only by surrendering such a weapon <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> guided by the Bible could such an assurance to the world be best secured.|$|E
25|$|On 12 August 2015, Mordechai Vanunu and {{his wife}} applied for family reunification via the Norwegian embassy in Tel Aviv. Vanunu’s exit to Norway must be {{accepted}} by Israel and his entry approved by Norway. Norway had previously said that they could only issue emergency passports <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> already on Norwegian soil. However, his wife is a Professor at the School of Theology in Oslo, and thus fulfills the requirement that one {{must be able to}} provide for their spouse.|$|E

25|$|The Bayesian {{approach}} {{is superior to}} use in decision making {{when there is a}} high level of uncertainty or limited information in which to base decisions on and where expert opinion or historical knowledge is available. Bayes is also useful when explaining the findings in a probability- sense <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> less familiar and comfortable with comprehending statistics. It is in this sense that Bayesian methods are thought of as having created a bridge between business judgments and statistics for the purpose of decision-making.|$|E
25|$|In astronomy, an {{asterism}} is any {{pattern of}} stars {{recognized in the}} Earth's night sky. It {{may be part of}} an official constellation or it may be composed of stars from more than one constellation. Asterisms are composed of stars which, although visible in the same general area of the sky as viewed from Earth, are located at very different distances from Earth, at great distances from each other. Many asterisms are simple shapes composed of a few bright stars, making them easy to identify, and particularly useful <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> familiarizing themselves with the night sky.|$|E
25|$|Access to {{protected}} information must {{be restricted}} <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> authorized {{to access the}} information. The computer programs, {{and in many cases}} the computers that process the information, must also be authorized. This requires that mechanisms be in place to control the access to protected information. The sophistication of the access control mechanisms should be in parity with the value of the information being protected – the more sensitive or valuable the information the stronger the control mechanisms need to be. The foundation on which access control mechanisms are built start with identification and authentication.|$|E

25|$|The code {{of ethics}} that is {{affiliated}} with traditional marketing can also be applied to social media. However, with social media being so personal and international, there is another list of complications and challenges that come along with being ethical online. With the invention of social media, the marketer no longer has to focus solely on the basic demographics and psychographics given from television and magazines, but now they can see what consumers {{like to hear from}} advertisers, how they engage online, and what their needs and wants are. The general concept of being ethical while marking on social network sites is to be honest with the intentions of the campaign, avoid false advertising, be aware of user privacy conditions (which means not using consumers' private information for gain), respect the dignity of persons in the shared online community, and claim responsibility for any mistakes or mishaps that are results of your marketing campaign. Most social network marketers use websites like Facebook and MySpace to try to drive traffic to another website. While it is ethical to use social networking websites to spread a message <b>to</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> genuinely interested, many people game the system with auto-friend adding programs and spam messages and bulletins. Social networking websites are becoming wise to these practices, however, and are effectively weeding out and banning offenders.|$|E
