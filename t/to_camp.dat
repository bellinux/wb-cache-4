40|$|Mucosal barrier {{formed by}} {{cationic}} antimicrobial peptides (<b>CAMPs)</b> is believed <b>to</b> be crucial for host protection from pathogenic gut infection. However, some pathogens can develop resistance <b>to</b> the <b>CAMPs</b> <b>to</b> survive in hosts. Salmonella enterica {{is a common}} cause of acute diarrhea. During {{the course of this}} disease, the pathogen must continuously colonize the gut lumen, which contains CAMPs. However, it is incompletely understood whether the resistance of Salmonella strains <b>to</b> <b>CAMPs</b> contributes <b>to</b> the development of gut infections. PhoPQ two-component system-dependent lipid A modifications confer resistance <b>to</b> <b>CAMPs</b> in S. enterica serovar Typhimurium. Therefore, we introduced mutations into the PhoPQ-regulated genes in an S. Typhimurium strain, obtaining pagP ugtL and pmrA mutant strains. Each mutant strain demonstrated a distinct spectrum of the resistance <b>to</b> <b>CAMPs.</b> Using streptomycin mouse model for Salmonella diarrhea, we show that the pagP ugtL, but not pmrA, mutant strain had a gut colonization defect. Furthermore, the pagP ugtL, but not pmrA, mutant strain had decreased outer membrane integrity and susceptibility to magainin 2, an alpha-helical CAMP. Taken together, the PagP- and UgtL-dependent resistance <b>to</b> <b>CAMPs</b> was demonstrated <b>to</b> contribute to sustained colonization in the gut. This {{may be due to the}} robust outer membrane of S. Typhimurium, inducing the resistance <b>to</b> alpha-helical <b>CAMPs</b> such as α-defensins. Our findings indicate that the development of resistance <b>to</b> <b>CAMPs</b> is required for the S. Typhimurium gut infection...|$|R

However, they failed to find the Murrumbidgee, and Smith declared that the river did not exist.

5|$|After {{the death}} of owner Charles van Raalte in 1907, his wife Florence stayed on Brownsea until 1925. Mary Bonham-Christie bought the island at an auction in 1927. In 1932, Bonham-Christie allowed 500 Scouts <b>to</b> <b>camp</b> there to {{celebrate}} the Silver Jubilee of Scouting, but shortly afterwards she closed the island {{to the public and}} it became very overgrown. In 1934, some Sea Scouts were camping on the island when a fire broke out. Mrs. Bonham-Christie blamed the Sea Scouts, although the fire did not start where the Sea Scouts were camping. The fire engulfed most of the island, burning west to east. The eastern buildings were only saved by a subsequent change in wind direction. Although it was not known how the fire started, Scouts were not allowed <b>to</b> <b>camp</b> on the island again until after Bonham-Christie's death in 1961. Her family becoming liable for inheritance tax on her estate, they put the island up for sale. Interested citizens who feared that the island would be bought by developers helped raise an endowment, and in 1962 the government allowed the National Trust to take over management of the island in lieu of the death duties.|$|E
