5|$|Stela 10 {{was found}} in Group 21 {{together}} with Altar 6. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>among</b> the very few monuments that were placed outside of the ceremonial centre of the city. Stela 10 was carved with a frame containing a figure, now badly eroded. The figure is standing with feet separated and turned outwards. Small hieroglyphic panels accompany it. Stela 10 had been moved from its original location, which was probably somewhere nearby.|$|E

5|$|The first {{poultry breed}} {{to have its}} own {{specialist}} club for enthusiasts, Sebrights were admitted to poultry exhibition standards not long after their establishment. Today, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>among</b> the most popular of bantam breeds. Despite their popularity, Sebrights are often difficult to breed, and the inheritance of certain unique characteristics the breed carries has been studied scientifically. As a largely ornamental chicken, they lay tiny, white eggs and are not kept for meat production.|$|E
5|$|All have paddle-like {{tails and}} many have {{laterally}} compressed bodies that give them an eel-like appearance. Unlike fish, {{they do not have}} gills and must surface regularly to breathe. Along with whales, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>among</b> the most completely aquatic of all air-breathing vertebrates. Among this group are species {{with some of the most}} potent venoms of all snakes. Some have gentle dispositions and bite only when provoked, but others are much more aggressive. Currently, 17genera are described as sea snakes, comprising 62 species.|$|E

5|$|American {{alligators}} {{have been}} documented using lures to hunt prey such as birds. This means <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>among</b> the first reptiles recorded to use tools. By balancing sticks and branches on their heads, American alligators are able to lure birds looking for suitable nesting material to kill and consume. This strategy, which is shared by the mugger crocodile, is particularly effective during the nesting season, in which birds {{are more likely to}} gather appropriate nesting materials.|$|E
5|$|Nymphs live {{primarily}} in streams under rocks, in decaying vegetation, or in sediments. Few species live in lakes, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>among</b> the most prolific. For example, {{the emergence of}} one species of Hexagenia was recorded on Doppler weather radar by the shoreline of Lake Erie in 2003. In the nymphs of most mayfly species, the paddle-like gills do not function as respiratory surfaces because sufficient oxygen is absorbed through the integument, instead serving to create a respiratory current. However, in low-oxygen environments such as the mud {{at the bottom of}} ponds in which Ephemera vulgata burrows, the filamentous gills act as true accessory respiratory organs and are used in gaseous exchange.|$|E
5|$|The Yaghnobi {{people living}} in the Sughd {{province}} of Tajikistan still speak a dialect of the Sogdian language. Yaghnobi is largely a continuation of the medieval Sogdian dialect from the Osrushana region of the western Fergana Valley. The great majority of the Sogdian people assimilated with other local groups such as the Bactrians, Chorasmians, and in particular with Persians and came to speak Persian. In 819 the Persians founded the Samanid Empire in the region. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>among</b> the ancestors of the modern Tajiks. Numerous Sogdian cognates {{can be found in the}} modern Tajik language, although the latter is a Western Iranian language.|$|E

5|$|The oldest {{rocks of}} Scotland are the Lewisian gneisses, which were {{formed in the}} Precambrian period, up to 3,000 Ma (million years ago). <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>among</b> the oldest rocks in both Europe and the World. They form the {{basement}} {{to the west of}} the Moine Thrust on the mainland, in the Outer Hebrides and on the islands of Coll and Tiree. These rocks are largely igneous in origin, mixed with metamorphosed marble, quartzite and mica schist and intruded by later basaltic dykes and granite magma. One of these intrusions forms the summit plateau of the mountain Roineabhal in Harris. The granite here is anorthosite, and is similar in composition to rocks found in the mountains of the Moon.|$|E
5|$|They {{were created}} either as pendants, that is {{conceived}} as a pair and intended to hang alongside each other, or diptych wings. However this formation {{may have been a}} later conception; Barbara's portrait seems to have been executed some time after her husband's and it is unusual for a husband to be placed to the viewer's right in paired panels. His father's panel is considered the superior work and has been described as one of Dürer's most exact and honest portraits. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>among</b> four paintings or drawings Dürer made of his parents, each of which unsentimentally examines the deteriorating effects of age. His later writings contain eulogies for both parents, from which the love and respect he felt toward them is evident.|$|E
5|$|This species {{lives in}} many habitats, {{including}} deserts, forests, woodland and urban areas. They nest underground below logs, stones, twigs, and shrubs, or in decayed wooden stumps, and are sometimes found living in termite mounds. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>among</b> the first insects {{to be found}} in burnt-off areas after the embers have stopped smouldering. Rain presents no threat to colonies {{as long as it is}} a light shower in continuous sunshine. The green-head ant is diurnal, active throughout the day, preying on arthropods and small insects or collecting sweet substances such as honeydew from sap-sucking insects. They play an important role in seed dispersal, scattering and consuming seeds from a variety of species. Predators include the short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus) and a number of bird species.|$|E

5|$|Pelicans {{are very}} large birds with very long bills characterised by a downcurved hook {{at the end}} of the upper mandible, and the {{attachment}} of a huge gular pouch to the lower. The slender rami of the lower bill and the flexible tongue muscles form the pouch into a basket for catching fish and, sometimes, rainwater, though in order not to hinder the swallowing of large fish, the tongue itself is tiny. They have a long neck and short stout legs with large, fully webbed feet. Although <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>among</b> the heaviest of flying birds, they are relatively light for their apparent bulk because of air pockets in the skeleton and beneath the skin enabling them to float high in the water. The tail is short and square. The wings are long and broad, suitably shaped for soaring and gliding flight, and have the unusually large number of 30 to 35 secondary flight feathers.|$|E
5|$|The Galilean moons are {{the four}} largest moons of Jupiter—Io, Europa, Ganymede, and Callisto. They were first seen by Galileo Galilei in January 1610, and {{recognized}} by him as satellites of Jupiter in March 1610. They {{are the first}} objects found to orbit another planet. Their names derive from the lovers of Zeus. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>among</b> the largest objects in the Solar System {{with the exception of}} the Sun and the eight planets, with a radius larger than any of the dwarf planets. Ganymede is the largest moon in the Solar System, and is even bigger than the planet Mercury. The three inner moons—Io, Europa, and Ganymede—are in a 4:2:1 orbital resonance with each other. Because of their much smaller size, and therefore weaker self-gravitation, all of Jupiter's remaining moons have irregular forms rather than a spherical shape.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to deep fractures and grooved lanes, Enceladus has several {{other types of}} tectonic terrain. Many of these fractures are found in bands cutting across cratered terrain. These fractures probably propagate down {{only a few hundred}} meters into the crust. Many have probably been influenced during their formation by the weakened regolith produced by impact craters, often changing the strike of the propagating fracture. Another example of tectonic features on Enceladus are the linear grooves first found by Voyager 2 and seen at a much higher resolution by Cassini. These linear grooves can be seen cutting across other terrain types, like the groove and ridge belts. Like the deep rifts, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>among</b> the youngest features on Enceladus. However, some linear grooves have been softened like the craters nearby, suggesting that they are older. Ridges have also been observed on Enceladus, though not nearly to the extent as those seen on Europa. These ridges are relatively limited in extent and are up to one kilometer tall. One-kilometer high domes have also been observed. Given the level of resurfacing found on Enceladus, it is clear that tectonic movement has been an important driver of geology for much of its history.|$|E
