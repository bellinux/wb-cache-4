5|$|Holden {{declined}} <b>the</b> <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> {{become a}} Royal Academician in 1942, having previously been nominated, but refused {{because of his}} connection to Epstein. He twice declined a knighthood, in 1943 and 1951, as he considered it to {{be at odds with}} his simple lifestyle and considered architecture a collaborative process.|$|E

She is the third First Lady with a postgraduate degree, after her two immediate predecessors, Hillary Clinton and Laura Bush. She would later say her education gave her opportunities beyond what she had ever imagined. In July 2008, she accepted <b>the</b> <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> become an honorary member of the 100-year-old black sorority Alpha Kappa Alpha, which had no active undergraduate chapter at Princeton when she attended.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the regular season and prior to North Carolina's acceptance of <b>the</b> <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> play in the Gator Bowl, Tar Heels head coach Mack Brown received an offer from the Texas Longhorns to become that school's head coach. A day and a half after Texas extended the offer, Brown resigned his position as North Carolina's head coach and accepted the Texas job. He replaced John Mackovic, who was fired three days earlier after finishing the season with a 47 record.|$|E

5|$|Years later Armstrong remembered <b>the</b> <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> {{join the}} tour as having arisen in a casual conversation, {{during which he}} did not believe the King was serious. He {{realized}} the proposed tour was not just idle conversation when the King informed his Cabinet of his plans and chose Armstrong, Judd, and his personal cook Robert von Oelhoffen as his only traveling companions. At a state dinner held by Kalākaua and his ministers a week before departure, Armstrong spoke of their youthful dreams of sailing around the world finally being brought to fruition.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his failure}} to defeat Liu Kang in the Mortal Kombat tournament, the evil Shang Tsung begs his master Shao Kahn, supreme ruler of Outworld and the {{surrounding}} kingdoms, to spare his life. He tells Shao Kahn that if they hold it in Outworld the invitation for the next Mortal Kombat cannot be turned down, and the Earthrealm warriors must attend. Kahn agrees to this plan and also restores Shang Tsung's youth. He then extends <b>the</b> <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> the thunder god and Earthrealm's protector, Raiden, who gathers his warriors and takes them into Outworld. The new tournament is much more dangerous, as Shao Kahn has the home field advantage, and an Outworld victory {{will allow him to}} subdue Earthrealm.|$|E
5|$|On April 17, Parker {{declared}} for the 2014 NBA {{draft in}} an exclusive autobiographical story in Sports Illustrated. According to Bleacher Report, he signed with sports agent Rich Paul, who is LeBron James's agent, but other sources, such as SLAM Magazine, suggest that he signed with BJ Armstrong, who is Derrick Rose's agent. Parker (along with other top prospects Andrew Wiggins and Joel Embiid) decided to decline <b>the</b> <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> participate in the NBA Draft Combine. On June 26, Parker was selected no. 2 overall by the Milwaukee Bucks. Just prior to the draft, Parker became the second member of the 2014 draft class to sign a shoe contract when he signed an endorsement deal with the Jordan Brand.|$|E

5|$|With {{many players}} indisposed and his options limited, Allen {{requested}} reinforcements and the MCC sent out Len Hutton {{in time for}} the third Test; in the meantime, Allen asked S. C. Griffith, not a highly regarded batsman, to open the batting for England in the second Test. Griffith responded by batting the entire first day and scoring 140 runs in total, his maiden century in first-class cricket. The West Indies won the last two Tests (the first two having been drawn) to win the series; the MCC team did not win a single match on the tour. Allen later regretted accepting <b>the</b> <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> lead the team. In three Tests, he scored 94 runs and took five wickets. Allen did not play any more Test cricket; in 25 matches, he scored 750 runs at an average of 24.19 and took 81 wickets at 29.37.|$|E
5|$|Constantin von Tischendorf, {{who worked}} with {{numerous}} Bible manuscripts, was known as somewhat flamboyant, and had ambitiously sought money from several royal families for his ventures, who had indeed funded his trips. Simonides, whose name may be a synonym mocking Tischendorf, had a somewhat obscure history, as he claimed he was at Mt. Athos in the years preceding Tischendorf's contact, making the claim at least plausible. Simonides also claimed his father had died and <b>the</b> <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> Mt. Athos came from his uncle, a monk there, but subsequent letters to his father were found among his possessions at his death. While the word 'forgery' has been bandied about among scholars regarding the claims on the Sinaiticus by Tischendorf, perhaps a more accurate rendering would be recollation and 'adjusted' restoration as Simonides, an expert on hieroglyphics which are represented throughout the Sinaiticus. Simonides claimed the false nature of the document in The Guardian in an exchange of letters among scholars and others, at the time. Henry Bradshaw, a British librarian known to both men, defended the Tischendorf find of the Sinaiticus, casting aside the accusations of Simonides. Since Bradshaw was a social 'hub' among many diverse scholars of the day, his aiding of Tischendorf was given much weight. Simonides died shortly after, and the issue lay dormant for many years.|$|E
5|$|The 1976 Winter Olympics {{had been}} awarded in 1970 to Denver, United States, but in November 1972 {{the voters of}} the state of Colorado voted against public funding of the games by a 3 to 2 margin. The IOC turned to offer the Games to Vancouver-Garibaldi, British Columbia, which had been a {{candidate}} for the 1976 Games. However, a change in provincial government brought in an administration which did not support the Olympic bid, so the offer was rejected. Salt Lake City, a candidate for the 1972 Games, offered itself, but the IOC opted to ask Innsbruck, which had maintained most of the infrastructure from the 1964 Games. Despite only having half the time to prepare for the Games, Innsbruck accepted <b>the</b> <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> replace Denver in February 1973. Two Olympic flames were lit because it was the second time the Austrian town had hosted the Games. The 1976 Games featured the first combination bobsleigh and luge track, in neighbouring Igls. The Soviet Union won its fourth consecutive ice hockey gold medal.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, {{the conference}} added Arizona and Arizona State from the Western Athletic Conference, {{becoming}} the Pacific-10 Conference or Pac-10. <b>The</b> <b>invitations</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> schools were extended in December 1976, {{and the expansion}} formally announced in May 1977.|$|R

5|$|The 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, {{the capital}} of the Soviet Union, were the first to include a {{competition}} in women's field hockey. Pre-tournament favourites included Australia, the Netherlands and West Germany, but the American-led Western boycott of the Moscow Olympics led to these teams and others withdrawing, leaving only the Soviets in the women's hockey event. The Soviet and international Olympic authorities filled the gaps by inviting teams from countries that had not qualified. Among the nations invited was Zimbabwe, which had become an internationally recognised country in April 1980 following seven years of civil war. Moscow marked the southern African nation's return to the Olympics after 16 years; as Rhodesia it had been excluded from the 1968, 1972 and 1976 Games for political reasons following the mostly white government's declaration of independence from Britain in 1965. The Zimbabwe Olympic Committee received <b>the</b> <b>invitation</b> <b>to</b> send men's and women's hockey squads to Moscow on 14 June 1980, 35 days before the Olympics were due to start. They were taken totally by surprise—they had not prepared hockey teams for the Games—but nevertheless agreed to send a women's squad. No women's hockey team representing the country had ever played overseas before.|$|E
