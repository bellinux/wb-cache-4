50|$|Each unit {{is made up}} {{of three}} sections. The middle section, with a carbody made of steel, is fitted with {{electrical}} equipment and traction motors driving a <b>twin</b> <b>axle</b> bogie. Each of the lightweight outer sections, made of aluminium, has a passenger compartment, a driver's workstation, and an unpowered <b>twin</b> <b>axle</b> bogie. The three sections are connected together by steel-rubber joints.|$|E

50|$|Variable Nozzle Turbines (VNT) use nine {{moveable}} vanes, an electrohydraulic actuator and a proportional solenoid for variable control {{throughout the}} engine’s power curve. This means the air passageway of the turbo varies {{to meet the}} engine’s needs at different RPMs. Forty million VNT turbochargers have been sold since the 1990s. VNT DutyDrive, previously called Double Axle VNT, uses 12-19 turbine nozzle vanes supported by <b>twin</b> <b>axles</b> for trucks and buses.|$|R
50|$|At its height, the Bournville Works Railway ran to some 6 mi in length. There were {{extensive}} {{rail lines}} within the works, which with tight radii limited maximum vehicle wheelbase to <b>twin</b> <b>axles</b> on a maximum 7 ft length. The exchange sidings with the BWSR {{consisted of two}} parallel loops, {{at the north end}} of which was an extension spur containing a weighbridge. The wheelbase limit meant that the ideal locomotive was an 0-4-0, which were steam fired by coke due to its cleaner burning capabilities, highly important in a food factory. The company owned up to six private locomotives, initially steam powered and finally replaced by diesel, which marshalled three outbound trains every day except Sundays.|$|R
5000|$|So {{successful}} was {{the project}} for Cargowaggon, they extended the project. The problem of the <b>twin</b> <b>axle</b> design was that although its short length meant that it easily fitted on the cross-English Channel rail ferry, its long wheelbase restricted the minimum radius on which it could be used. The resultant longer length wagon, based on a twin EVA bogie, <b>twin</b> <b>axle</b> design, the IGA spawned three basic variants: ...|$|E
50|$|Although the K-44 was {{originally}} designed for hauling a logging semi-trailer, the trucks were soon {{being used to}} tow conventional <b>twin</b> <b>axle</b> trailers, which permitted a significantly greater overall load capacity.|$|E
50|$|The hull {{is divided}} in two parts, each one {{with its own}} <b>twin</b> <b>axle</b> bogie, plus a central bogie in the middle.Each bogie mounts four DC motors, each {{providing}} , {{for a total of}} 12.|$|E
5000|$|In 1965 {{the range}} covered rigid trucks with gross weights from 5.2 to 12.75 British tons, and tippers from 10.8 to 12.75 tons. [...] Higher gross weights became {{available}} with the subsequent introduction of versions featuring <b>twin</b> rear <b>axles</b> and articulated models were also quickly {{added to the}} range.|$|R
50|$|The SNCF Class BB 36000 {{locomotives}} (named Astride) are a {{class of}} triple voltage 4 <b>axle</b> <b>twin</b> bogie electric locomotives built by GEC-Alsthom (later Alsthom) between 1996 and 2001 for SNCF.|$|R
25|$|For {{the first}} time the Panorama was offered on all chassis types, {{including}} Ford R226 and Bedford VAL, looking particularly well-suited to the latter, where the chrome trim on the first window bay harmonised with the <b>twin</b> steering <b>axles</b> below. There was even a Panorama for the Bedford SB and Ford Thames 570E, although here the thickened window pillar was absent, and the chrome trim did not extend across the front of the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|In 1931, the tramway network {{reached its}} {{greatest}} extent, at 25 tram routes. From that year to 1940, (almost) all the {{districts in the}} city could be reached by tram. Between 1900 and 1930, the fleet grew to 445 motorised trams and approximately 350 trailers. These were all <b>twin</b> <b>axle</b> vehicles with wooden bodies.|$|E
50|$|The {{two members}} of the ABDeh 6/6 class each had a pair of {{passenger}} car bodies connected together, and three <b>twin</b> <b>axle</b> bogies. Each body was mounted, at its outer end, on an outer bogie, via two side frames. At each body's other end, that body was connected, in combination with the other body, to a central Jacobs bogie, in each case via a central pedestal.|$|E
5000|$|Eight <b>twin</b> <b>axle</b> {{electrically}} powered tramcars were acquired {{for the network}} from the , and fitted out appropriately. They were 7.9 m long and 2 m wide, with 24 seats. Six of the eight are described as incorporating a baggage trunk (Con bagagliaio laterale). Each tramcar was powered by two 26 kW Siemens motors. One of the eight tramcars was reserved for the exclusive use of the city's [...] "Hotel Palace".|$|E
50|$|A swap-cab {{armouring}} solution {{known as}} the Integrated Armour Cabin (IAC) is also available. The IAC was originally developed in conjunction with Krauss-Maffei Wegmann (KMW) for the SX range of trucks, this suited to models with <b>twin</b> front <b>axles</b> only. A Rheinmetall-developed IAC option is now available, this suitable for all HX range trucks, depending on front axle rating and protection levels. Australia, Norway, and Sweden are receiving trucks with this cab which is manufactured at a purpose-constructed facility recently opened at Rheinmetall's facility in Unterluss, Germany.|$|R
50|$|In August 2012 CNR Datong {{announced}} {{the production of}} a new variant of its <b>twin</b> section, 8 <b>axle,</b> 10MW freight locomotive using domestically produced traction and control systems; the first unit was numbered HXD2-1001. The two first units have corrugated sides, following ones have smooth sides.|$|R
5000|$|The Gmeinder {{company in}} Mosbach / Baden {{put forward a}} design for a 4 <b>axle,</b> <b>twin</b> bogied machine, which {{was similar to the}} MaK 400 BB {{machines}} made in 1959 for the Alsen´sche Portland-Cementfabrik KG in Itzehoe which had a gauge of [...] - having similar power transmission via a hydraulic gearbox.|$|R
50|$|In the mid-1950s, (modern) tramcars {{came back}} into the spotlight. The 25 {{articulated}} trams ordered in 1955 to serve only the Leidsestraat routes 1 and 2 were well received, and secured the future of trams in Amsterdam. Between 1957 and 1968, 160 new articulated vehicles, manufactured by Beijnes and Werkspoor in the Netherlands, were added to the fleet; they were numbered 551-587 and 602-724. The old <b>twin</b> <b>axle</b> trams from the prewar period were withdrawn from service between 1945 and 1968.|$|E
50|$|Like the ABDeh 6/6s, each ABDeh 8/8 {{is made up}} of a pair of {{passenger}} car bodies connected together, but the newer class has an extra intermediate body, and an extra <b>twin</b> <b>axle</b> bogie, to make up a total of four bogies. Each ABDeh 8/8 body is mounted, at its outer end, on an outer bogie, via two side frames. However, at each body's other end, that body is connected by a central pedestal to another bogie, and also connected, via a coupling, to the other body.|$|E
5000|$|With {{the opening}} of the new line, the network {{acquired}} route numbers. The new line was Line 2, while the [...] "Saggen" [...] line from Museum Street became Line 1. The original city line became Line 3 and the meter gauge railway to Hall in Tirol was integrated into the tram network as Line 4, although it continued to be known locally as the [...] "The Haller line", Haller being the adjective form of the placename Hall. For the newly electrified Line 4, eight four-axle powered tramcars were ordered from the Graz railcar company, and these took over the identity numbers 1-8 from the steam locomotives which they replaced. For Line 2 a further six powered two-axle city tramcars were acquired. These used the numbers 48-54. (Tramcar 53 can be seen at the nearby railway museum.) This latest batch used so-called [...] "Fast running motors" [...] ("Schnellläufermotoren") which were more powerful than the motors of the existing <b>twin</b> <b>axle</b> city trams.|$|E
50|$|The {{coach at}} the end of the film was a 1964 Bedford VAL with Harrington Legionnaire Body, {{distinctive}} for its <b>twin</b> front steering <b>axles.</b> Following the filming, the coach had its improvised rear doors welded and was used on a Scottish school bus route until the mid-1980s when, according to the Legionnaire register, it was scrapped.|$|R
50|$|The RENFE Class 352 (formerly the T-2000) was a {{class of}} <b>twin</b> engined four <b>axle</b> diesel-hydraulic {{locomotives}} built by Krauss-Maffei, designed solely for passenger traffic; in particular they were responsible for towing Andalusian Talgo III trains. The class were very successful, heralding {{a new era of}} passenger trains in Spain. They were delivered in 1964 and 1965, and were fully withdrawn during the 1990s.|$|R
5000|$|The 4wd F150 {{continued}} {{the use of}} the Dana 44 Twin-Traction Beam axle from the 80-91 trucks, and the Ford 8.8" [...] Rear Straight axle. The 4wd F250 carried the Dana 50 <b>Twin</b> Traction Beam <b>axle,</b> the Sterling 10.25 from the previous generation for the rear; full float on heavy duty 3/4 ton trucks and the 4wd F350 used the Dana 60 Straight Axle front, and the Sterling 10.25" [...] rear Straight axle.|$|R
5000|$|The Folk Museum {{houses a}} variety of old {{buildings}} and dwellings which have been collected from various parts of Ireland and rebuilt in {{the grounds of the}} museum, brick by brick. 170 acre are devoted to illustrating the rural way of life in the early 20th century, and visitors can stroll through a recreation of the period's countryside complete with farms, cottages, crops, livestock, and visit a typical Ulster town of the time called [...] "Ballycultra", featuring shops, churches, and both terraced and larger housing and a Tea room run by Eurest Services, a sub division of the Compass Catering Service. Regular activities include open hearth cooking, printing, needlework, and traditional Irish crafts demonstrations. The allocation of a considerable sum of lottery money has enabled the museum to build a large outhouse in the centre of Ballycultra town. This new structure houses unusual relics from Ulster's past, such as an unusual waffle iron from the mid-19th century, an old 'poteen' distillery from Portmore and the first <b>twin</b> <b>axle</b> bicycle ever seen in Ireland. A little more offbeat is the 'Worlds Largest Sausage', a 17 ft banger, the creation of Newtownards man Seamus McTavish. All these new developments have aided UFTM in developing a new visitor base and have gained the site international recognition.|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the high}} level of {{investment}} needed in countries such as e. g. Europe and Asia, there is an increasing demand for machines for the manufacture of rails, railway wheels and railway axles. At the moment railway axles are in most cases forged in a series of different forming processes. In an initial rolling process for example possible defects in the starting material are closed {{in order to get a}} homogenous microstructure. In a subsequent forging process, due to the low depth penetration capacity of the plants used, only the contouring of the axle is carried out. The SMS Meer presentation shows that using the SMX hydraulic radial forging machine from SMS Meer it is possible to produce railway axles in a single forming process. This means that pore-free railway axles with an excellent microstructure can be produced from conventional continuous cast material without any upstream rolling process being required. Using the hydraulic radial forging machine, continuous cast carbon steel with defects running in an axial direction can be forged into a railway <b>twin</b> <b>axle</b> in only one heat. The high forming potential of the hydraulic radial forging machine makes this possible. The analyses with regard to microstructure, grain size and pore detection will show very good results. In the zone with the least degree of forming, a homogeneous microstructure evenly distributed across the radius was achieved. The average grain size of 8. 5 (ASTM) is likewise evenly distributed across the radius. An ultrasonic analysis of the forged axles showed that there are no pores larger than 3 mm. As these results are very promising, the forging time will be optimized in subsequent tests and the forged axles will be finish machined for a final analysis in accordance with the railway standard...|$|E
30|$|This {{paper has}} been {{developed}} to expose some serious shortcomings in the content and conclusions of the paper written by Clausen and Voll [4]. Their paper discusses much of the economic issues surrounding European wagonload freight services and attempts to relate this back to infrastructural and institutional differences between the US and Canada and the generalised European model. Wagonload in the European context applies to the movement of cargo in individual wagons or wagon groups between a loading point and delivery point with these single units or groups marshalled into train length formations for the longer transit. The wagon types for this are multitudinous and includes covered wagons (sometimes designated as vans) capable of carrying {{a wide variety of}} merchandise traffic. They can also be used for the movement of palletised or unitised commodities such as lumber, bagged minerals (cement). In the European context these types of vehicles can be either <b>twin</b> <b>axle</b> or four axle designs. Wagonload can also include hopper wagons for the movement of fuels, minerals, ores, timber again of varying size, weight and volumetric capability. Tanker wagons are also used in wagonload traffic to service the oil and chemical sectors. The intimation in the paper is that the North American model is inherently a more efficient and effective option without analysing much of the context that underpins the differences. It omits recent major railroad consolidations, the rapid rise of inter-modal freight, the rising importance of the regional and short line operators and growth within the US railroad sector for block trains and also a strong residual market for carload (wagonload) traffic commodities some of which move in carload blocks. The term carload in the North American context applies to those movements undertaken in separate rail vehicles which can include box cars of varying dimensions which are used primarily for higher value merchandise traffic and can be moved in single units or as blocks of vehicles to be assembled into train formations for long haul movements. Box cars {{can also be used to}} move products such as grain and lumber. Other carload traffic can include hopper wagons for minerals, agricultural products, solid fuel (Iess common now), ores and similar products, tank cars for liquids, powders, granules, pellets and gases. Again these types of rail vehicle can be moved as single units or as parts of a group of vehicles). It also appears to downplay the routing and scheduling options that exist between the Class 1 and regional railroads with short line operations to facilitate carload or carload block movements. [2], p. 1) defines that U.S. Class I Railroads are line haul freight railroads with 2010 operating revenue of $ 398.7 million or more. The AAR (American Association of Railroads, effectively an industry representative body) (2013, p. 1) reports that there are over 560 freight railroads of which only seven are “Class I” railroads that accounts for 69  % of freight rail mileage typically operating in many different states. The AAR [1] report also suggests that the non-Class I railroads, also known as short line and regional railroads, range in size from tiny operations with handling of a few carloads per month to multi-state operators not far from Class I size.|$|E
50|$|The trailer axle(s) {{are driven}} by an drive shaft exiting {{the rear of the}} {{transmission}} with splines and universal joints to accommodate the movements between them. All axles are portals with hub reduction and locking differentials. Initially the axle differentials were permanently locked but recently some models can run with open but lockable differentials for better high-speed capabilities. The usual <b>twin</b> back <b>axles</b> are combined in a separate frame that is can pivot in relation to the trailer frame, keeping all wheels on the ground, but until recently always unsprung. Likewise the occasional single back axle usually are unsprung, while the front axle have suspension to give the operator a better ride. The reinforced cab is sometimes also sprung, as is done in modern cab-over-engine trucks, as is the drivers seat.|$|R
50|$|The {{truck had}} <b>twin</b> rear <b>axles,</b> a CAT 1674 {{turbocharged}} engine with a 13-speed transmission, making it capable of hauling loads over 30 tons and top speeds reaching 75-80 mph. During the original filming, the crew {{only had one}} truck, so the shots of the truck falling off the cliff had {{to be completed in}} one take. For the film's theatrical release, though, two additional trucks were purchased in order to film the additional scenes that were not in the original made-for-television version (the school bus scene and the railroad crossing scene). One of these, a 1964 Peterbilt 351, virtually identical to the original truck except for its air intake, was later destroyed in another movie production. Only one of those trucks has survived, a 1960 Peterbilt 281 that was kept and prepared as a back up truck for the 351 truck, but went unused.|$|R
50|$|The Dana 50 axle {{featured}} on most F-250 Super Dutys differs greatly {{from the early}} models. The Dana 50 {{started out as a}} <b>Twin</b> Traction Beam <b>axle</b> (much like independent suspension) in 1980. This lasted all the way to 1997 models. The Super Duty models then used a solid axle version of this axle. The ring, pinion, carrier and u joints all remained the same however. The Dana 50 was phased out of the trucks in 2004, in favor of the Dana 60 and was last used in the Ford Excursion.|$|R
2500|$|Construction of the {{aircraft}} was almost entirely of wood or plywood with fabric covering, steel detail fittings and struts. The wings were three bay strutted and wire-braced assemblies supporting the engine nacelles, at around mid gap and the single axle main undercarriage units. Despite the wide variations between all the Staaken R-series variants in their engine configurations, the identical 42.2 meter wingspan figures for {{nearly all of them}} indicate that nearly identical wing layouts were likely shared by almost all the Zeppelin-Staaken R-series designs built. The square-section fuselage, with curved decking forward of the wings, supported the tail unit and nose <b>twin</b> wheel single <b>axle</b> nose undercarriage and housed the majority of the crew, defensive armament positions, cockpit, cabin, and bomb load.

40|$|AbstractAs {{a result}} of {{successful}} initiatives in Australia, New Zealand and Canada, {{the introduction of a}} Smart Truck or performance-based standards (PBS) approach in the heavy vehicle sector in South Africa was identified by the CSIR as a research area warranting funding because of the potential benefits in terms of transport efficiency, road/vehicle safety and the protection of road infrastructure. The PBS approach involves setting standards to specify the performance required from the operation of a vehicle on a network rather than prescribing how the specified level of performance is to be achieved. A need was identified to design, manufacture and operate a number of PBS demonstration projects in South Africa in order to gain practical experience in the PBS approach and to quantify and evaluate potential benefits. The Smart Truck demonstration projects have been designed and manufactured to comply with the safety standards of the Australian PBS system. These include directional and non-directional manoeuvres such as acceleration capability, slow speed swept path, static rollover threshold and rearward amplification. In order to evaluate the impact of the PBS vehicles on pavements, the South African Mechanistic-Empirical Design and Analysis Methodology was used to calculate the road wear characteristics of various baseline and PBS vehicle combinations. In most cases, the PBS vehicles were found to be significantly more road-friendly per ton of payload than the corresponding baseline vehicles. Modifications for reducing road wear were identified such as load redistribution {{in order to reduce the}} load on the steering axle, replacing wide-based single tyres with dual tyres and, where appropriate, replacing a single steer <b>axle</b> with a <b>twin</b> steer <b>axle</b> unit. The paper describes the results of road wear analyses of five PBS vehicles and the corresponding baseline vehicles...|$|R
50|$|When the Subway first opened, single-carriage four <b>axle</b> (<b>twin</b> truck) trains were operated. Late in {{the evening}} on the opening day, after 11pm, one car laden with 60 {{passengers}} was run into by another under the River Clyde. Four people were injured, one being taken to the infirmary. This entailed {{the closure of the}} Subway until 19 January 1897. The 20 original wooden bodied carriages were built by the Oldbury Railway Carriage and Wagon Company, of Oldbury, Worcestershire. Many continued in service until 1977 in an upgraded form. A further 10 were delivered by the same manufacturer in 1897. From 1898, second four axle (trailer) carriages without a cable gripper mechanism were added, though they were considerably shorter than the front (gripper) carriage. These additional carriages, eventually numbering 30, were built by Hurst Nelson & Company, Motherwell, Lanarkshire. These carriages were soon expanded to match the length of the front carriages, although carriage 41T has been restored to its original length and cut longitudinally and can be seen preserved at Buchanan Street subway station and number 39T is preserved in the Riverside Museum. Most of the gripper carriages were subsequently converted to electric traction in 1935. All carriages were originally built with lattice gates (instead of doors) at the ends; many were converted to air-operated sliding doors in the 1960s, but a few retained the gates until 1977.|$|R
