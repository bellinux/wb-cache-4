5|$|Insane Clown President: Dispatches {{from the}} 2016 Circus is a non-fiction book by Matt Taibbi about Donald Trump and the 2016 United States presidential election. The book {{contains}} illustrations by Rolling Stone artist Victor Juhasz. Taibbi's choice of {{title for the}} book was motivated by Trump's marketing style. His work was inspired by Hunter S. Thompson, who had previously published Fear and Loathing on <b>the</b> <b>Campaign</b> <b>Trail</b> '72.|$|E
5|$|Obama {{endorsed}} Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton {{and made}} several high-profile speeches {{in favor of}} her, including an address at the 2016 Democratic National Convention. She also appeared multiple times on <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>trail</b> in either solo or joint appearances with Clinton. On October 13, 2016, Obama heavily criticized Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for the statements he made in a 2005 audio recording while at a Clinton rally in Manchester, New Hampshire. A week later, Trump attempted to revive past comments Obama made in regards to Clinton during the 2008 presidential election.|$|E

5|$|Paul {{returned}} to <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>trail</b> {{and entered the}} General election stretch of the campaign a year ahead of the nominees for the two major parties. He traveled to Universities held press conferences and filmed an eight-minute television advertisement, to be shown in small states and on cable television, to help spread his message. He focused on gaining enough support to win {{a place in the}} League of Women Voters-sponsored presidential debates.|$|E
5|$|Undaunted by {{this lack}} of {{confidence}} from his peers, Johnson continued to campaign to retain his office. Although his campaign was more vigorous than that of Van Buren, his behavior on <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>trail</b> raised concern among voters. He made rambling, incoherent speeches. During one speech in Ohio, he raised his shirt in order to display to the crowd the wounds he received during the Battle of the Thames. Charges he leveled against Harrison in Cleveland were so poorly received that they touched off a riot in the city.|$|E
5|$|After the South Carolina debate, Biden campaigned in California {{to begin}} May 2007 {{attending}} events in San Francisco. Later {{in the month}} after President George W. Bush enacted economic sanctions against Sudan to pressure the government to end the genocide in Darfur, Biden momentarily shifted focus from Iraq to the crisis in Darfur. He released a statement on <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>trail</b> that expressed his belief that Bush was right to enact the sanctions. However, Biden {{argued that it was}} not enough, calling for a No-Fly Zone over the region and a possible commitment of United States forces to the nation.|$|E

5|$|Breathitt enraged Chandler by {{charging}} that, when Chandler was a senator, he had {{voted in favor}} of declaring World War II, but soon after resigned his commission as a reserve army captain. According to Chandler's version of events, after he {{voted in favor of}} the war declaration, he called Secretary of War Henry Stimson and asked to be put on active duty. Chandler said Stimson told him he would rather have a senator than a captain, after which Chandler resigned his commission. Chandler's explanation did not stop Breathitt from repeating the charge often on <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>trail.</b>|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} of the 2008 Democratic National Convention in August, media outlets {{observed}} that her presence on <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>trail</b> had grown softer than {{at the start of the}} race, focusing on soliciting concerns and empathizing with the audience rather than throwing down challenges to them, and giving interviews to shows like The View and publications like Ladies' Home Journal rather than appearing on news programs. The change was even reflected in her fashion choices, wearing more informal clothes in place of her previous designer pieces. The View appearance was partly intended to help soften her public image, and it was widely covered in the press.|$|E
5|$|In the gubernatorial {{election}} of 1911, Republicans were divided {{as to whether}} they should celebrate Willson's administration or downplay it. His actions to quell the violence in the Black Patch Wars and his pardons to Taylor and Powers were both unpopular with many voters. The eventual candidate, Edward C. O'Rear, was lukewarm at best to Willson's administration. Willson was upset by this hesitancy and lent O'Rear only modest support on <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>trail.</b> Former governor Bradley also disagreed with O'Rear's selection and engaged in minimal campaigning. The failure of the party to unite behind their candidate gave Democrat James B. McCreary an easy victory.|$|E

5|$|Neither Wetherby nor Clements {{enjoyed the}} support of Governor Chandler. Coupled with this, Senate Majority Leader Lyndon B. Johnson {{suffered}} a heart attack during the campaign, and as majority whip, Clements assumed the role of acting majority leader. This took him away from <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>trail</b> for extended periods of time. During the infrequent visits he was able to make to the state, he campaigned for his former lieutenant governor, Wetherby. In the general election, Cooper defeated Wetherby by 65,000 votes and Clements lost to Thruston Ballard Morton by about 7,000 votes. It was the first time Clements had lost a race in thirty years, and Kentucky Democrats would not elect a senator again for another sixteen years.|$|E
5|$|Reverting to the pre-Roosevelt custom that presidents seeking {{re-election}} did not campaign, Taft spoke publicly only once, {{making his}} nomination acceptance speech on August 1. He had difficulty in financing the campaign, as many industrialists had concluded {{he could not}} win, and would support Wilson to block Roosevelt. The president issued a confident statement in September after the Republicans narrowly won Vermont's state elections in a three-way fight, but had no illusions he would win his race. He had hoped to send his cabinet officers out on <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>trail,</b> but found them reluctant to go. Senator Root agreed to give a single speech for him.|$|E
5|$|After {{the victory}} over Mattau the {{governor}} {{decided to make}} use of the soldiers to cow other recalcitrant villages, starting with Taccariang, who had previously killed both VOC employees and Sinkan villagers. The villagers first fought with the Sinkanders who were acting as a vanguard, but on receiving a volley from the Dutch musketeers the Taccariang warriors turned and fled. The VOC forces entered the village unopposed, and burnt it to the ground. From Taccariang they moved on to Soulang, where they arrested warriors who had participated in the 1629 massacre of sixty Dutch soldiers and torched their houses. The last stop on <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>trail</b> was Tevorang, which had previously sheltered wanted men from other villages. This time the governor decided to use diplomacy, offering gifts and assurances of friendship, with the consequences of resistance left implicit. The Tevorangans took the hint, and offered no opposition to Dutch rule.|$|E

5|$|Diefenbaker {{began his}} {{campaign}} with {{a week of}} local campaigning in his riding, after which he went to Toronto for the Massey Hall speech. After two days in Ontario, he spoke {{at a rally in}} Quebec City, before spending the remainder of the first week in the Maritimes. The next week saw Diefenbaker spend two days in Quebec, after which he campaigned in Ontario. The next two weeks included a Western tour, with brief returns to Ontario, the most populous province. The final two weeks saw Diefenbaker spend much of the time in Ontario, though with brief journeys east to the Maritimes and Quebec and twice west to Saskatchewan. He returned to his riding for the final weekend before the Monday election. He spent 39days on <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>trail,</b> eleven more than the Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|In Your Honor is {{the fifth}} studio album by American rock band Foo Fighters, {{released}} on June 14, 2005 by RCA Records. It is a double album, with one disc containing heavy rock songs and a second disc with mellower acoustic songs. Frontman Dave Grohl decided to do a diverse blend of songs as he felt that after ten years of existence, the band had to break new ground with their music. The album was recorded at a newly built studio in Northridge, Los Angeles, and featured guests such as John Paul Jones, Norah Jones and Josh Homme. The lyrics deal with both resonating and introspective themes, with a major influence from Grohl's involvement on <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>trail</b> with John Kerry during the 2004 presidential election. It is the first album to feature keyboardist Rami Jaffee, although he would not join the band as full-time member until 2017.|$|E
5|$|The next year, 1894, saw {{pay cuts}} and labor disturbances, {{including}} a massive strike by the {{workers at the}} Pullman Company. A group of unemployed workers, known as Coxey's Army, marched on Washington that spring. Weaver met with them in Iowa and expressed sympathy with the movement, {{so long as they}} refrained from lawbreaking. He then returned to <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>trail,</b> stumping for Populist candidates in the 1894 midterm elections. The election proved disastrous for the Democrats, but most of the gains went to the Republicans rather than to the Populists, who gained a few seats in the South but lost ground in the West. During the election, Weaver became friendly with William Jennings Bryan, a Democratic Congressman from Nebraska and a charismatic supporter of free silver. Bryan had lost his bid for the Senate in the election, but his reputation as an exciting speaker made him a presidential possibility in 1896.|$|E
5000|$|Accounts of Stewart-Olsen vary widely. On <b>the</b> 2005-06 <b>campaign</b> <b>trail,</b> a {{reporter}} for The Record who had been physically restrained from asking a question {{by a member of}} Harper's RCMP security detail found Stewart-Olsen [...] "diminutive and soft-spoken;" [...] she defused the situation and arranged a short interview. Calgary Sun writer Licia Corbella calls her [...] "competent and charming".|$|R
5000|$|No {{civil rights}} {{legislation}} for lesbian or gay individuals passed during Reagan's tenure. On <b>the</b> 1980 <b>campaign</b> <b>trail,</b> {{he spoke of the}} gay civil rights movement: My criticism is that gay movement isn’t just asking for civil rights; it’s asking for recognition and acceptance of an alternative lifestyle which I do not believe society can condone, nor can I.|$|R

5|$|In digital puppetry, machinima creators become virtual actors; each {{crew member}} {{controls}} {{a character in}} real-time, as in a multiplayer game. The director can use built-in camera controls, if available. Otherwise, video is captured {{from the perspectives of}} one or more puppeteers who serve as camera operators. Puppetry allows for improvisation and offers controls familiar to gamers, but requires more personnel than the other methods and is less precise than scripted recordings. However, some games, such as the Halo series, (except for Halo PC and Custom Edition, which allow AI and custom objects and characters), allow filming only through puppetry. According to Marino, other disadvantages are the possibility of disruption when filming in an open multi-user environment and the temptation for puppeteers to play the game in earnest, littering the set with blood and dead bodies. However, Chris Burke intentionally hosts This Spartan Life in these unpredictable conditions, which are fundamental to the show. Other works filmed using puppetry are the ILL Clan's improvisational comedy series On <b>the</b> <b>Campaign</b> <b>Trail</b> with Larry & Lenny Lumberjack and Rooster Teeth Productions' Red vs. Blue. In recamming, which builds on puppetry, actions are first recorded to a game engine's demo file format, not directly as video frames. Without re-enacting scenes, artists can then manipulate the demo files to add cameras, tweak timing and lighting, and change the surroundings. This technique is limited to the few engines and software tools that support it.|$|E
5|$|Nixon {{wanted to}} get rid of Goodell, a Republican who had been {{appointed}} by Governor Rockefeller after the assassination of Robert F. Kennedy, and who had shifted considerably to the left while in office. Goodell could be sacrificed as there was a Conservative Party candidate, James Buckley, who might win the seat. Nixon did not want to be seen as engineering the defeat of a fellow Republican, and did not have Agnew go to New York until after Nixon left on a European trip, hoping Agnew would be perceived as acting on his own. After dueling long-distance with Goodell over the report of the Scranton Commission on campus violence (Agnew considered it too permissive), Agnew gave a speech in New York in which, without naming names, he made it clear he supported Buckley. That Nixon was behind the machinations did not remain secret long, as both Agnew and Nixon adviser Murray Chotiner disclosed it; Goodell stated he still believed he had Nixon's support. Although it was by then deemed unlikely the Republicans could gain control of the Senate, both Nixon and Agnew went on <b>the</b> <b>campaign</b> <b>trail</b> for the final days before the election. The outcome was disappointing: Republicans gained only two seats in the Senate, and lost eleven governorships. For Agnew, one bright spot was Goodell's defeat by Buckley in New York, but he was disappointed when his former chief of staff, Charles Blair, failed to unseat Governor Marvin Mandel, Agnew's successor and a Democrat, in Maryland.|$|E
