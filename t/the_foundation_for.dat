Thus, the PRE Mundial registry asserts that their registry is the most authentic, purest PRE registry functioning today.|$|E
5|$|Although {{contemporary}} historians vilified Domitian {{after his}} death, his administration provided <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> <b>for</b> the peaceful empire of the 2nd century CE, and {{the culmination of}} the 'Pax Romana'. His successors Nerva and Trajan were less restrictive, but in reality their policies differed little from Domitian's. Much more than a gloomy coda to the 1st century, the Roman Empire prospered between 81 and 96, in a reign which Theodor Mommsen described as the sombre but intelligent despotism of Domitian.|$|E

5|$|For {{most of its}} history, {{agriculture}} {{has been}} organic, without synthetic fertilisers or pesticides, and without GMOs. With the advent of chemical agriculture, Rudolf Steiner called for farming without synthetic pesticides, and his Agriculture Course of 1924 laid <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> <b>for</b> biodynamic agriculture. Lord Northbourne developed these ideas and presented his manifesto of organic farming in 1940. This became a worldwide movement, and organic farming is now practiced in most countries.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} (GR) is {{a theory}} of gravitation that was developed by Einstein between 1907 and 1915. According to general relativity, the observed gravitational attraction between masses results from the warping {{of space and time}} by those masses. General relativity has developed into an essential tool in modern astrophysics. It provides <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> <b>for</b> the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where gravitational attraction is so strong that not even light can escape.|$|E

It provides <b>the</b> <b>foundation</b> <b>for</b> the current understanding of black holes, regions of {{space where the}} gravitational effect {{is so strong that}} even light cannot escape. Their strong gravity is thought to be responsible for the intense radiation emitted by certain types of astronomical objects (such as active galactic nuclei or microquasars). General relativity is also part of the framework of the standard Big Bang model of cosmology.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, Singh and {{his colleagues}} {{discovered}} that a tiny portion of the short arm of sex-determining Y chromosome was necessary and sufficient to convert a female mouse to male.
