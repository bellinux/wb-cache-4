5|$|Gestational period varies among bovids - while duiker {{gestation}} {{ranges from}} 120 to 150 days, gestation in African buffalo ranges from 300 to 330 days. Usually, a single offspring is born (twins are less frequent), {{and it is}} able to stand and run by itself within an hour of birth. In monogamous species, males assist in defending their young, but <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> in polygynous species. Most newborn calves remain hidden for a week to two months, regularly nursed by their mothers. In some bovid species the neonates start following about their mothers immediately or within a few days, as in the impala. Different bovids have different strategies for defence of juveniles. For instance, while wildebeest mothers solely defend their young, buffaloes exhibit collective defence. Weaning might occur as early as two months (as in royal antelope) or as late as a year (as in muskox).|$|E
5|$|Like {{almost all}} Coraciiformes the bee-eaters are cavity nesters. In {{the case of}} the bee-eaters the nests are burrows dug into the ground, either into the sides of earth cliffs or {{directly}} into level soil. Both types of nesting site are vulnerable, those on level ground are vulnerable to trampling and small predators, whereas those in cliffs, which are often the banks of rivers, are vulnerable to flash floods, which can wipe out dozens or hundreds of nests. Many species will nest either on cliffs or on level ground but prefer cliffs, although Böhm's bee-eater always nests on level ground. The burrows are dug by both birds in the pair, sometimes assisted by helpers. The soil or sand is loosened with jabs of the sharp bill, then the feet are used to kick out the loose soil. It has been suggested that riverine loess deposits that do not crumble when excavated may be favoured by the larger bee-eaters. There may be several false starts where nests are dug partway before being abandoned; in solitary species this can give the impression of colonial living even when <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> The process of nest building can take as long as twenty days to complete, during which time the bill can be blunted and shortened. Nests are generally used only for a single season and are rarely used twice by the bee-eaters, but abandoned nests may be used by other birds, snakes and bats as shelter and breeding sites.|$|E

However, {{there are a}} few ways to cope with memory loss if <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> One of these ways is cognitive or occupational therapy. In therapy, amnesiacs will develop the memory skills they have and try to regain some they have lost by finding which techniques help retrieve memories or create new retrieval paths. This may also include strategies for organizing information to remember it more easily and for improving understanding of lengthy conversation.|$|E
25|$|In Germany, Article 7, Paragraph 4 of the Grundgesetz, the {{constitution}} of Germany, guarantees the right to establish private schools.
