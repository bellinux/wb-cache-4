5|$|Within Xeromphalina, X.setulipes {{is part of}} {{the section}} Mutabiles, which also {{contains}} X.campanelloides, X.cauticinalis, X.cirris, X.cornui, and X.fraxinophila. Phylogenetic analysis performed by Esteve-Raventós and colleagues concluded that X.setulipes appears to be most closely related to X.fraxinophila, X.cornui, X.campanelloides and X.cauticinalis, <b>the</b> <b>five</b> <b>of</b> which are clearly separate from the group containing X.campanella, X.kauffmanii, X.brunneola, and, possibly, X.junipericola. Data from the large subunit (60S) of the nuclear ribosomal RNA gene suggests that the species is most closely related to X.campanelloides, while internal transcribed spacer (ITS) data place it closest to a clade containing X.cauticinalis and X.aff.parvibulbosa (an unidentified species similar, but not identical, to X.parvibulbosa). Further research, analysing the ITS or RPB2 loci, could serve to help clarify the precise relationships of species and positions of clades within the genus.|$|E
5|$|Angered by the situation, {{the group}} and their {{supporters}} decide to protest peacefully at India Gate, a war memorial in New Delhi. Police forcefully break up their protest using batons; in the process, Rathod's mother (Waheeda Rehman) is severely injured and slips into a coma. DJ, Karan, Aslam, Sukhi, and Laxman decide that they must emulate the early freedom fighters and resort to violence to achieve justice. As a result, they kill the defence minister to avenge Rathod's death, while Karan murders his father for his corrupt actions. The minister {{is reported to have}} been killed by terrorists and is hailed as a martyr by the media. To bring forth their intentions behind the killings, <b>the</b> <b>five</b> <b>of</b> them attempt to reach the public through a radio station. They forcibly take over the All India Radio station premises after having evacuated its employees. Karan goes on air and reveals the truth about the defence minister and his wrongdoings. While still on the air, the police proclaim that they are dangerous terrorists who have forcefully taken over the AIR, and therefore they are to be shot on sight. The first to be shot is Daljit, who tries to get out of cover and establish that they are not terrorists. Sukhi, unable to control his anger, shows himself and is instantly shot. As they are trying to lock the terrace doors, Aslam and Pandey are then killed by a grenade and the once archenemies die holding hands and smiling, as they have visions of Ram Prasad Bismil and Ashfaqullah Khan.|$|E

25|$|On January 9, 2009, {{national}} news media reported that <b>the</b> <b>five</b> <b>of</b> the seven CtW unions {{had met with}} seven of the largest unions in the AFL-CIO in talks which explored {{the possibility of the}} five CtW unions rejoining the larger labor federation. Impetus for the talks came as the Obama administration signalled to both labor federations that it preferred to deal with a united rather than fragmented labor movement. Also, several Change to Win unions also concluded that they were not getting any significant advantage from being in a separate labor federation, and that a fragmented labor union was doing more harm than good. David Bonior, a former U.S. Congressman who once led the AFL-CIO's American Rights at Work division and {{who was a member of}} Barack Obama's presidential transition team, facilitated the meeting, and said talks were scheduled to last several weeks. The five CtW unions present included the Laborers, SEIU, the Teamsters, UFCW, and UNITE HERE. AFL-CIO unions present included AFSCME, the AFT, the Electrical Workers, the UAW, and the United Steelworkers. Also in attendance was Dennis Van Roekel, president of the National Education Association, which is independent and belongs to neither group.|$|E

She has BA from Smith College, an MD from Stanford University and a PhD from University of California, Berkeley, making her a [...] "double doctor". While her emotional pragmatism, competitive perfectionism, and logical nature lead many to view her as a cutthroat [...] "robot", Cristina hits it off with Meredith on their first day and the pair soon become best friends and each other's [...] "person", sharing the same [...] "dark and twisty" [...] sense of humor.|$|E

500|$|Dream Days at the Hotel Existence was {{recorded}} at Sunset Sound Studio, Los Angeles, California, in early 2007 by producer Rob Schnapf, {{best known for}} his work with Beck and The Vines. Powderfinger had already written most of the album before departing to the United States. In particular, Powderfinger wrote songs in parts and brought them together; some songs were written in pairs or trios, while others were written in parts by different people, and then combined. According to the band, this brought a [...] "diverse" [...] and [...] "fresh" [...] approach to songwriting. The band used different methods in putting the album together as [...] "it comes back to the sound <b>the</b> <b>five</b> <b>of</b> us can make together". Powderfinger guitarist Darren Middleton commented that as a rule they preferred not to put together an album that was just [...] "plain". As the style of writing differed, the band identified the need for piano performances in many of their songs, enlisting veteran pianist Benmont Tench to play parts throughout.|$|E
500|$|George O'Malley is {{introduced}} {{as a fellow}} surgical intern to Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) and Alex Karev (Justin Chambers); <b>the</b> <b>five</b> <b>of</b> them working under Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson). O'Malley and Stevens move in with Meredith, for whom he has romantic feelings but did not express them due to his fear of rejection {{and the fact that}} she and one of the attendings Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) had a mutual interest in one another. On the first day of internship, O'Malley is selected by chief of cardiothoracic surgery Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington) as the first intern to perform surgery. He freezes in the operating room, and is mocked by his peers, and earns the nickname [...] "007" [...] because of almost killing a patient in such a simple operation (referring to James Bond's [...] "licence to kill"). O'Malley dates nurse Olivia Harper (Sarah Utterback), breaking up with her when he contracts syphilis from her, which she in turn contracted from Karev. His friendship with Karev is further strained when the two become trapped in an elevator with a patient who begins to bleed out. Karev freezes, and O'Malley is able to save the patient single-handedly. He goes on to admit his feelings to Meredith, and the two have a one-night stand. When Meredith tells him that sleeping together was a mistake, O'Malley begins avoiding her and starts dating orthopedic surgeon Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez).|$|E
500|$|The {{triumph of}} the Belyayev circle {{could be seen as}} the worst of both worlds from The Five and Tchaikovsky for two reasons. First, from Tchaikovsky and Rimsky-Korsakov, the Belyayevets {{realized}} the importance of a solid academic grounding, but they took the importance of their conservatory training to extremes, and devolved into academicism and [...] They failed to take into account that Tchaikovsky transcended what authority David Brown calls [...] "the heavy conditioning of his conservatory training" [...] through his [...] "innate Russianness and his love of his own country's folk music", and that Rimsky-Korsakov similarly transcended a period of extremely pedantic music writing to arrive at a more balanced style. Second, the Belyayevets got the idea from <b>The</b> <b>Five</b> <b>of</b> a school to which all members would adhere, but they took adherence to their school to the point of mediocrity, with [...] "a safe conformism" [...] becoming [...] "increasingly the rule". This was the point that composer César Cui, a former member of The Five, made in his article [...] "Fathers and Sons" [...] in 1888, when he wrote, [...] "Despite the frequent contact of all the fathers with one another, each of them preserved intact his individuality. It is enough to glance at a single page of music by one of the fathers to say with certainty that it is the work of Borodin, Balakirev, Mussorgsky, Tchaikovsky, or Korsakov.
