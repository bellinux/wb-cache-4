5|$|The {{location}} of the G-spot is typically reported as being about 50 to 80mm (2 to 3in) inside the vagina, on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wall.</b> For some women, stimulating this area creates a more intense orgasm than clitoral stimulation. The G-spot area {{has been described as}} needing direct stimulation, such as two fingers pressed deeply into it. Attempting to stimulate the area through sexual penetration, especially in the missionary position, is difficult because of the particular angle of penetration required.|$|E
5|$|The top tower along <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wall</b> of {{the forward}} compound, tower 6, has a square base which was {{reinforced}} with a six-sided foundation. Working west, the square base of tower 7 was reinforced with a circular foundation. Tower 8, {{on the upper}} side of the front portcullis, has an irregular, but generally square, base. It is also the shortest of the first nine towers. Guarding {{the other side is}} tower 9, which has a square base reinforced by an eight-sided foundation.|$|E
5|$|Group 18 Structure 2 is on {{the east}} side of the plaza. Its {{earliest}} phase dates to the Late Preclassic. The Preclassic remains consist of a low north wall running east-west. A later construction phase was built over this. It consisted of a rectangular platform that supported a bench. A small pyrite disc was found near <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wall.</b> Obsidian prismatic blades were found on top of the platform, together with pieces of a thin earthenware bowl. Burial 69 was found in front of the base of the platform.|$|E

5|$|The current {{building}} {{was constructed in}} the 15th century {{on the site of}} a wooden building dating from the 12th century. In the 16th century a new facade was added to the original building. It is possible that the stonework and window of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wall</b> were removed from the abbot's lodgings behind the great kitchen of the Abbey as similar features can be identified in a 1712 engraving, and it is known that the {{building was}} ruined and without its front wall by 1723.|$|E
5|$|Much more {{is known}} of the {{hundreds}} of unique cleitean that decorate the archipelago. These dome-shaped structures are constructed of flat boulders with a cap of turf on the top. This enables the wind to pass through the cavities in the wall but keeps the rain out. They were used for storing peat, nets, grain, preserved flesh and eggs, manure, and hay, and as a shelter for lambs in winter. The date of origin of this St Kildan invention is unknown, but they were in continuous use from prehistoric times until the 1930 evacuation. More than 1,200 ruined or intact cleitean remain on Hirta and a further 170 on the neighbouring islands. House no. 16 in the modern village has an early Christian stone cross built into <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wall,</b> which may date from the 7th century.|$|E
5|$|Through {{the main}} {{doors of the}} Main Stand is a wood-panelled hallway. A {{staircase}} leads to the boardroom and trophy room. Inglis compared Ibrox to Highbury, in that it combined corporate power {{with a sense of}} tradition and solidity. It was originally constructed as a 10,000-seat stand above a standing enclosure. It was redeveloped in the early 1990s with the addition of the Club Deck and seating in the enclosure. It is now a three-tier all-seated structure, accommodating approximately 21,000 spectators. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>wall</b> of the middle tier {{is one of the last}} surviving examples of the Leitch style of criss-cross detailing. The middle tier is split into front and rear sections, while the enclosure is split into east and west sections, either side of the retractable tunnel cover.|$|E

5|$|On 10 October 1872 at St Mary's Church, Balmain Selfe married Emily Ann Booth, the {{daughter}} of John Booth, a well-known shipbuilder and Balmain's first mayor (and formerly the member for East Macquarie in the colonial parliament). They lived for many years at Rockleigh in Donnelly Street, Balmain, a house that has since been demolished. In 1884 their first daughter Rhoda Jane was born, followed by a stillborn daughter in 1886, and then Norma Catherine in 1888. In 1885 Selfe bought land in Ashfield and designed a grand house called Amesbury. Described {{at the time as}} having “more novelties both externally and internally than any other house in the colony” including terracotta lyrebird reliefs by artist Lucien Henry on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wall,</b> and a tower purpose-built for Selfe to pursue his hobby of astronomy. Built around 1888 to honour the centenary of the colony, Amesbury still stands at 78 Alt Street and was used by Brahma Kumaris from 1986 as its Australian headquarters until 2014 when it was auctioned for over $3.5 million. As children, Rhoda and Norma attended their Aunt Maybanke's school in Dulwich Hill. As adults, they trained in Italy with educator Maria Montessori and returned to Sydney to open a Montessori school of their own in the building known as Warwick on Bland Street, Ashfield.|$|E
25|$|There {{are four}} walls to a squash court. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>wall,</b> on which three {{parallel}} lines are marked, {{has the largest}} playing surface, whilst the back wall, which typically contains {{the entrance to the}} court, has the smallest. The out line runs along the top of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wall,</b> descending along the side walls to the back wall. There are no other markings on the side or back walls. Shots struck above or touching the out line, on any wall, are out. The bottom line of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wall</b> marks the top of the 'tin', a half metre-high metal area which if struck means that the ball is out. In this way the tin can be seen as analogous to the net in other racket sports such as tennis. The middle line of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wall</b> is the service line and is only relevant during serves.|$|E
25|$|Boast: The ball {{is played}} off a side wall at an angle, or the back wall, before hitting <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wall.</b> A 'three wall boast' has the ball hit at a side wall {{such that the}} ball hits <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wall</b> {{followed}} by the opposite side wall before finally hitting the floor. A 'back wall boast' has the ball struck {{against the back wall}} before reaching <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wall.</b> It is typically not recommended to beginners due to the risk of hitting spectators above and behind players on solid backed courts. A 'trickle boast' is a boast performed at a shallow angle with <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wall</b> at a low trajectory. A 'reverse boast' is a boast played towards the sidewall furtherst from the striker. It is played rarely at high levels due to the high risk of hitting the opponent and the typical ease of counterattack.|$|E
50|$|It is {{also known}} by some who live there as the 'village of the saints' because of the 19 statues of saints in niches on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>walls</b> of houses and other {{buildings}} in Upper Froyle. They were bought by Sir Hubert Miller in the early 20th century from Italy.|$|R

25|$|After the serve, {{the players}} take turns {{hitting the ball}} against <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wall,</b> above the tin and below the out line. The ball may strike the side or back walls at any time, {{as long as it}} hits below the out line. It must not hit the floor after hitting the racket and before hitting <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wall.</b> A ball landing on either the out line or the line {{along the top of the}} tin is {{considered}} to be out. After the ball hits <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wall,</b> it is allowed to bounce once on the floor (and any number of times against the side or back walls) before a player must return it. Players may move anywhere around the court but accidental or deliberate obstruction of the other player's movements is forbidden and could result in a let or a stroke. Players typically return to the centre of the court after making a shot.|$|E

For a legal serve, one of the server's feet must be in the service box, not {{touching}} any part of the service box lines, as the player strikes the ball. After being struck by the racket, the ball must strike <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wall</b> above the service line and below the out line and land in the opposite back quarter court. The receiving player can choose to volley a serve after it has hit <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wall.</b> If the server wins the point, the two players switch sides for the following point.|$|E
