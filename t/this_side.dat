5|$|Baker {{was also}} the {{inspiration}} for literary works. In 1913 F. Scott Fitzgerald enrolled at Princeton as a freshman, when Baker was a senior. Though he only spoke to Baker once during their time at Princeton, Fitzgerald idolized him. His first novel, <b>This</b> <b>Side</b> of Paradise, has several references to Baker: the main character is named Amory Blaine after Baker's middle name, and the minor character Allenby is Baker himself. Mark Goodman's 1985 novel Hurrah for the Next Man Who Dies is a fictionalized account of Baker's life.|$|E
5|$|F. Scott Fitzgerald idolized Baker {{and based}} Allenby, a minor {{character}} in the 1920 novel <b>This</b> <b>Side</b> of Paradise, on him. In 1921, Princeton named its new hockey arena the Hobey Baker Memorial Rink. The National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), the governing body of college sports in the United States, introduced the Hobey Baker Award in 1980; it is awarded annually to the best collegiate hockey player.|$|E

50|$|A {{number of}} sidings also {{exist on the}} NHRR. At Buckingham Valley, a small siding that once served the Buckingham Valley Trolley Association is {{presently}} used as a Repair-in-progress, or RIP-track. At Wycombe, the team track once used for less-than-carload deliveries is utilized as car storage {{for a number of}} NHRR's out-of-service passenger cars. At Grenoble, another siding created by severing the southern switch of a passing <b>siding</b> is present. <b>This</b> <b>siding</b> once held a number of pieces of equipment that were eventually scrapped. Today only passenger car 1542 remains on <b>this</b> <b>siding</b> as it was flipped over onto its side by vandals. At Ivyland, exists another RIP-track, typically used for storing MoW equipment. The final siding on the railroad is in Warminster {{on the north side of}} the Street Road crossing. <b>This</b> <b>siding</b> is used for short-term storage of interchange freight equipment and storing the diesel locomotive assigned to freight service when not in use.|$|R
5|$|However, not all peptide {{bonds are}} formed in this way. In a few cases, {{peptides}} are synthesized by specific enzymes. For example, the tripeptide glutathione {{is an essential}} part of the defenses of cells against oxidative stress. This peptide is synthesized in two steps from free amino acids. In the first step, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase condenses cysteine and glutamic acid through a peptide bond formed between the side chain carboxyl of the glutamate (the gamma carbon of <b>this</b> <b>side</b> chain) and the amino group of the cysteine. This dipeptide is then condensed with glycine by glutathione synthetase to form glutathione.|$|E
5|$|It {{has also}} been {{reported}} that phosphoramidites activated with 1H-tetrazole react, to a small extent, with the O6 position of guanosine. Upon oxidation with I2 /water, <b>this</b> <b>side</b> product, possibly via O6-N7 migration, undergoes depurination. The apurinic sites thus formed are readily cleaved {{in the course of}} the final deprotection of the oligonucleotide under the basic conditions (see below) to give two shorter oligonucleotides thus reducing the yield of the full-length product. The O6 modifications are rapidly removed by treatment with the capping reagent as long as the capping step is performed prior to oxidation with I2/water.|$|E

5|$|The fruit bodies contain unique {{chemical}} compounds that {{are derived from}} phenylpropanoids. The compounds, named squarrosidine and pinillidine, inhibit the enzyme xanthine oxidase. Xanthine oxidase catalyzes the crystallization of uric acid in the joints, a main cause of gouty arthritis, and inhibitors of this enzyme are being used clinically to reduce <b>this</b> <b>side</b> effect. The natural function of these compounds may be to quench reactive oxygen species produced by plants as a defensive response to fungal infection.|$|E
5|$|The north façade {{has three}} bays {{separated}} by windows and features a loggia, typical of early 17th-century houses, {{with a central}} arched entrance to accommodate coaches. The central bay is crowned by an ornamental pierced parapet below a niched Dutch gable, which shelters a small statue of Lord Zouche or James I. There are small obelisks at {{either side of the}} gable. Thorpe originally intended the main entrance of the house to be on <b>this</b> <b>side,</b> building on the gatehouse of the earlier Foxley house.|$|E

5|$|A non-pegylated {{liposomal}} doxorubicin, called Myocet, {{is approved}} in Europe and Canada {{for treatment of}} metastatic breast cancer in combination with cyclophosphamide, but has not {{been approved by the}} FDA for use in the United States. Unlike Doxil, the Myocet liposome does not have a polyethylene glycol coating, and therefore does not result in the same rate of hand-foot syndrome. The minimization of <b>this</b> <b>side</b> effect may allow for one-for-one (1:1) substitution with doxorubicin in the same treatment regimen, thereby improving safety with no loss of efficacy. Like Doxil, the liposomal encapsulation of the doxorubicin limits the cardiotoxicity. In theory, by limiting the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin through liposomal encapsulation, it can be used safely in concurrent combination with other cardiotoxic chemotherapy drugs, such as trastuzumab. There is an FDA black box warning that trastuzumab cannot be used in concurrent combination with doxorubicin, only in sequential combination. Though concurrent combination of trastuzumab and doxorubicin in clinical studies found superior tumor response, the combination resulted in unacceptable cardiotoxicity, including risk of cardiac failure manifesting as congestive heart failure (CHF). Published phase II study results have shown that Myocet, trastuzumab, and paclitaxel can safely be used concurrently without the cardiac risk, as measured by reduction in LVEF function, while still achieving superior tumor response. This finding is the basis for the ongoing phase III trial for FDA approval.|$|E
5|$|A route {{popular with}} {{experienced}} hillwalkers starts at Torlundy, {{a few miles}} north-east of Fort William on the A82 road, and follows the path alongside the Allt a' Mhuilinn. It can also be reached from Glen Nevis by following the Pony Track as far as Lochan Meall an t-Suidhe, then descending slightly to the CIC Hut. The route then ascends Càrn Mòr Dearg and continues along the Càrn Mòr Dearg Arête ("CMD Arête") before climbing steeply to the summit of Ben Nevis. This route involves a total of 1,500 metres of ascent and requires modest scrambling ability and a head for heights. In common with other approaches on <b>this</b> <b>side</b> of the mountain, it {{has the advantage of}} giving an extensive view of the cliffs of the north face, which are hidden from the Pony Track.|$|E
5|$|A station {{house is}} located above both platforms, {{containing}} a crossover, waiting area and fare control. The single street staircase outside of fare control {{goes down to}} West Road by the intersection of Noel Road next to the Rockaway-bound platform. This platform also has a set of exit-only turnstiles leading directly to this staircase so riders exiting the station on <b>this</b> <b>side</b> {{do not have to}} go through the station house. The station house is heated, while the platforms feature passenger-activated heaters; these heaters, and the doors separating the station house and staircases, were not originally part of the station. The station house used to have 1950s-era signage at its front entrance reading, but now only has modern MTA entrance signs.|$|E
50|$|Shortly {{after passing}} Jewell's, a branch line curved {{off to the}} right to the John Darling mine, the catch points to <b>this</b> <b>siding</b> {{actually}} joining the derelict duplication and by the layout it was apparently intended to work each road as an independent single line as far as Redhead.|$|R
50|$|<b>This</b> <b>siding</b> {{served the}} Aladdin lamp factory, a short {{distance}} south of the British Bath Company and Kelvin factories. It was lifted when the factory closed in the early 1980s (although the main factory building is still extant), and the area is now occupied by a business park.|$|R
50|$|The station {{opened in}} 1895 as Cheltenham, serving both rail {{passengers}} and race-goers.

5|$|Based on a {{courtyard}} house layout, externally the harled whinstone rubble mansion {{is a combination}} of Elizabethan and Jacobean (or Gothic) design, similar to Smith's work at Slains. A spacious central courtyard is surrounded by buildings three storeys high. Within the back of the courtyard, circular towers enclose the service stairways. A large Elizabethan-style tower housing the main stairway is also set within the courtyard but sited to the front behind the reception rooms. Other external features include: canted and box bays; a variety of lofty towers that are round, square or octagonal; many different gables; and numerous diagonally set stone flues. The southeast facing front elevation lacks symmetry with the main Tudor style entranceway set off centre and extending out. A plaque commemorating the building dates of 1839–1842 and a central armorial are above the round arched entrance. There is also an eight-sided tower positioned at the front corner. A separate driveway accesses the outside kitchen yard {{at the back of the}} north west elevation. <b>This</b> <b>side</b> of the mansion is plainer, more restrained and built into the slope of the hillside. A lengthy one storey lean-to houses fuel supplies and servants toilets and provides additional ground support. The northeast elevation is also more architecturally reserved than the front.|$|E
5|$|During the English {{winter of}} 1922–23, the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) {{selected}} {{a team to}} tour Australia and New Zealand. <b>This</b> <b>side,</b> captained by Archie MacLaren and composed mainly of amateurs, was not particularly strong and contained several players chosen for their social standing rather than cricketing ability. The team played four first-class games in Australia against state teams; the first was drawn {{and the others were}} lost. After scores of 75 and 58 against Western Australia, Chapman played consecutive innings of 53, 73 and 69 against South Australia and Victoria, followed by 100 in the most eagerly awaited match of the tour against a strong New South Wales side. The press and public praised his attacking batting and his fielding, although Frank Iredale, a former Test cricketer, noticed some flaws in his technique. When the team moved on to New Zealand, after an uncertain start Chapman scored 533 runs at an average of 48.45, including two centuries. The tourists returned to Australia for the last leg of the tour; Chapman scored 91 against New South Wales and 134 in 142 minutes against South Australia. In all the Australian games, he totalled 782 runs at 65.16; in all the matches on tour he had 1,315 runs at an average of 57.15.|$|E
5|$|Each {{side has}} {{two sets of}} street stairs, with the {{full-time}} entrance at Grand Avenue and Broadway on the west end. There are two additional staircases by the crossovers; however, these are closed at night. HEET access {{at both ends of}} the mezzanine allow people to exit fare control without having to walk down to the middle of the mezzanine. Originally, there were two fare control areas at each end, which is clear from the presence of two closed staircases at the Manhattan-bound side. The mezzanine narrows to about two-thirds of its width on the southern side of the mezzanine directly to the opposite of the closed staircases. The narrowing of the mezzanine did not allow for staircases on the Queens-bound side in this location like on the Manhattan-bound side. Chain-link fence is used to separate the area inside and outside fare control. In total, <b>this</b> <b>side</b> of the station has four staircases in addition to the two closed ones mentioned, while the other side has five staircases.|$|E
50|$|The {{section of}} line near Melba Flats was {{operational}} by December 1900. The Rosebery to Zeehan connection {{closed on the}} 14 August 1965, however the Rosebery to Melba Flats section re-opened on the 15 January 1970.The Mount Lyell company had trucks deliver the ore along the Queenstown to Zeehan road to <b>this</b> <b>siding.</b>|$|R
50|$|The eastern {{section of}} the line had {{previously}} been used as siding to the Erin colliery. This ran at first from Herne CME station for several kilometres parallel to the CME’s original line. With the establishment of Castrop (Stadt) station on 1 December 1874, <b>this</b> <b>siding</b> was converted from a freight siding into a line for general traffic.|$|R
50|$|There {{was also}} a {{locomotive}} siding at the junction. The locomotive siding was used by electric locomotives waiting to take over car trains from Elderslie having been hauled by diesel locomotives for the first short section of their journey. <b>This</b> <b>siding</b> {{was close to the}} former signal box which was removed during the 1960s electrification project.|$|R
