5|$|In 1908, the Dip the Dips Scenic Railway {{roller coaster}} opened but was soon overshadowed in 1912 {{by the larger}} Leap the Dips ride. In 1917, Dip the Dips was razed and {{replaced}} by <b>the</b> <b>Leap</b> Frog Scenic Railway. With three roller coasters and a growing variety of other rides, Cedar Point was beginning to grow as an amusement park, though that was not Boeckling's priority. He marketed the peninsula primarily as a bathing resort complete with shows, exhibits, motion pictures, {{and other forms of}} entertainment, but did not emphasize the park's rides.|$|E
5|$|Kundla was {{succeeded by}} Bowling Green head coach Bill Fitch.

Fitch did recruit Jim Brewer before he left, laying the first seed for the 1972 Big Ten title. George Hanson, a longtime assistant coach at the school, was hired as his replacement, but resigned after only one season.|$|E

5|$|To {{perform a}} bicycle kick, the ball must be {{airborne}} {{so that the}} player can hit it while doing a backflip; the ball can either come in the air towards the player, such as from a cross, or the player can flick the ball up into the air. The non-kicking leg should rise first to help propel the body up while the kicking leg makes the jump. While making <b>the</b> <b>leap,</b> the body's back should move rearwards until it {{is parallel to the}} ground. As the body reaches peak height, the kicking leg should snap toward the ball as the non-kicking leg is simultaneously brought down to increase the kick's power. Vision should stay focused on the ball until the foot strikes it. The arms should be used for balance and to diminish the impact from the fall.|$|E

25|$|The ballet {{became famous}} for Nijinsky's leap {{through one of}} the two large windows {{at the back of the}} stage. The height of <b>the</b> <b>leap</b> was an {{illusion}} though. Nijinsky took five running steps from the middle of the stage and leapt through the window on the sixth step. The skirting board (base board) under the window was very low, giving the illusion that <b>the</b> <b>leap</b> was higher than it actually was. Behind the set, four men caught Nijinsky in the air and put warm towels on him. No one in the audience saw Nijinsky land. It looked like he would soar on for all time. The illusion was helped by the conductor in the orchestra pit who held the penultimate chord. In doing so, <b>the</b> <b>leap</b> was given a sense of great length and height.|$|E

5000|$|While The Mystery of <b>the</b> <b>Leaping</b> Fish is now {{considered}} something of a cult film due its comedic dealings of drug use, Fairbanks hated the film and reportedly wanted to have it withdrawn from circulation.

25|$|In 2011, Chunhao Han of the Beijing Global Information Center of Application and Exploration said China had {{not decided}} what its vote {{would be in}} January 2012, but some Chinese {{scholars}} consider it important to maintain a link between civil and astronomical time due to Chinese tradition. The 2012 vote was ultimately deferred. At an ITU/BIPM-sponsored workshop on <b>the</b> <b>leap</b> second, Dr. Han expressed his personal view in favor of abolishing <b>the</b> <b>leap</b> second, and similar support for the redefinition was again expressed by Dr. Han, along with other Chinese timekeeping scientists, at the URSI General Assembly in 2014.|$|E
