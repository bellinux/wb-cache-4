5|$|The British {{expedition}} {{was led by}} Vice-Admiral Sir George Keith Elphinstone {{and sailed}} in April 1795, arriving off Simon's Town at the cape in June. Attempts were made to negotiate a settlement with the colony, but talks achieved nothing and an amphibious landing was made on 7 August. A short battle was fought at Muizenberg, and skirmishing between British and Dutch forces continued until September when a larger military force landed. With Cape Town under threat, Dutch governor, Abraham Josias Sluysken, surrendered the colony. Elphinstone subsequently strengthened the garrison against counterattack and stationed a Royal Navy squadron off the port. Almost a year later a Dutch reinforcement convoy reached the colony only <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was badly outnumbered, and surrendered without a fight. The British occupation continued until the Peace of Amiens in 1802 when it was returned to the Dutch. In 1806, during the Napoleonic Wars, a second British invasion reoccupied the colony after the Battle of Blaauwberg and it remained a British colony until {{the establishment of the}} Union of South Africa in 1910.|$|E

Arriving in Tientsin, the Australians {{provided}} 300 men to an 8,000-strong {{multinational force}} tasked with capturing the Chinese forts at Pei Tang, which dominated a key railway. They arrived {{too late to}} take part in the battle, but were involved in the attack on the fortress at Pao-ting Fu, where the Chinese government was believed to have found asylum after Peking was captured by western forces. The Victorians joined a force of 7,500 men on a ten-day march to the fort, once again only <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had already surrendered. The Victorians then garrisoned Tientsin and the New South Wales contingent undertook garrison duties in Peking. HMCS Protector was mostly used for survey, transport, and courier duties in the Gulf of Chihli, before departing in November. The naval brigades remained during the winter, unhappily performing policing and guard duties, as well as working as railwaymen and fire-fighters. They left China in March 1901, having played only a minor role in a few offensives and punitive expeditions and in the restoration of civil order.

25|$|In the meantime, the IV Corps {{had been}} tasked with making a frontal assault from Granny White and Hillsboro Pikes {{on the left}} end of the Confederate line.

While the Confederates had originally established their line there, they had withdrawn to equally strong positions on the south side of Brown's Creek, as the original positions were exposed to artillery fire from the Nashville forts. The IV Corps proceeded deliberately up Montgomery Hill, only <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was defended by a thin skirmish line. They stopped to reorganize, and at about the same time that Smith's Detachment was rolling up the Confederate redoubts, they advanced on the main Confederate line.|$|E

Crook ordered Crazy Horse's arrest and then departed, leaving the post commander at Fort Robinson, Lieutenant Colonel Luther P. Bradley, to carry out his order. Additional troops were brought in from Fort Laramie. On the morning of September 4, 1877, two columns moved against Crazy Horse's village, only <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> had scattered during the night.

They arrive at the light source only <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a torch on a raft belonging to the world-renowned sumo wrestler Maruyama, whom they feared. In spite of becoming acquainted, Maruyama teases Paifu and picks up two sticks producing a cross gesture to scare him off believing he, like some vampires in stories, fear a cross. On the contrary, this action forces Paifu to transform into a rampaging were-koala. His rage is halted by José, who shape-shifts into a round object to revert him back to normal. José tells Maruyama that Paifu can not look at a cross figure for more than three seconds before transforming. When asked by Maruyama about Paifu's father, Paifu replies that he was shot to death in a human city when he shape-shifted into a were-koala. After getting to know a little about Maruyama's past, it turns out that he is not as frightening as rumored to be.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the troops on Kiska, Japan had an Aleutian garrison on Attu; a U.S. Navy force of cruisers and destroyers bombarded Attu in late April 1943, but Kawase missed a chance to attack that force when a false report of an enemy ship off Shumushu in the Kurile Islands caused him instead to divert forces to deal with it, only <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was a neutral Soviet ship laying mines in Soviet waters off the Kamchatka Peninsula. By early May 1943, Japan had alerted the troops on Attu that an American invasion of the island was imminent. One of Kawases first priorities as the new fleet commander was to send reinforcements to Attu to aid {{in defense of the}} island. However, heavy losses in the Guadalcanal campaign and the ongoing Solomon Islands campaign had forced Japan to divert forces to the defense of the Solomon Islands and New Guinea, and Kawase was forced to inform the island commander, Imperial Japanese Army Colonel Yasuyo Yamasaki, that no reinforcements could arrive until late May, when increased fog in the Aleutians would help a reinforcement convoy avoid detection by American forces and by which time Japanese merchant ships earmarked for the reinforcement operation would have radar installed. Meanwhile, Kawase ordered Yamasaki to hold Attu with the forces he already had.|$|E

The shadowy quality for which the work is renowned came to be called [...] "sfumato", or Leonardo's smoke. Vasari, who is generally thought to have known the painting only by repute, said that [...] "the smile was so pleasing that it seemed divine rather than human; and those who saw it were amazed <b>to</b> <b>find</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was as alive as the original".|$|E
