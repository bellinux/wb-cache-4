5|$|The {{first edition}} of this work, {{published}} in 1861, was received so favourably that the author has felt bound to bestow his utmost care upon a minute and thorough revision of his book, {{in the hope of}} bringing up the information it contains to the existing state of knowledge. In this endeavour he has been assisted as well by Canon Lightfoot, to whom he is indebted for that section of the third chapter which treats of Egyptian versions of the New Testament (pp. 319-357), as also by much unsought for and most welcome help, especially on <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> scholars who are named in p. 164, note. Without wishing to speak harshly of writers who are not very scrupulous in such matters, he has always thought it became him to borrow from no quarter without making a full and frank avowal of the fact. The author will be much rejoiced if this new edition shall be judged not less worthy than its predecessor to become a text book in Universities and Theological Celleges.|$|E

The publication stresses careful planning prior to the incorporation of group counseling. The booklet contains discussions of various aspects of the leader's role including: What does the leader represent to the group? What are his responsibilities to the members? What are the leader's goals for the group? How does he steer the members toward these goals?

25|$|In the 1870s–90s, {{large-scale}} socialist, nationalist, agrarian {{and other}} political movements of great ideological fervor became established in partitioned Poland and Lithuania, along with corresponding political parties to promote them. Of the major parties, the socialist First Proletariat was founded in 1882, the Polish League (precursor of National Democracy) in 1887, the Polish Social Democratic Party of Galicia and Silesia in 1890, the Polish Socialist Party in 1892, the Marxist SDKPiL in 1893, the agrarian People's Party of Galicia in 1895 and the Jewish socialist Bund in 1897. Christian democracy regional associations allied with the Catholic Church were also active; they united into the Polish Christian Democratic Party in 1919. The main minority ethnic groups of the former Commonwealth, including Ukrainians, Lithuanians, Belarusians and Jews, were getting involved in their own national movements and plans, which met with disapproval on <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> Polish independence activists who counted on an eventual rebirth of the Commonwealth or {{the rise of a}} Commonwealth-inspired federal structure (a political movement referred to as Prometheism).|$|E
25|$|The next 140 {{years were}} marked by an {{inability}} to take action on <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> responsible {{for the maintenance of}} the drainage scheme. Once completed, it came {{under the jurisdiction of the}} Commissioners of Sewers, and routine maintenance did not take place. In 1811, the Commissioners pinned their hopes on the proposed Bristol to Taunton canal, which would have crossed the drain by an aqueduct, which would have included a new clyse at a lower level than the Dunball outlet, but the canal project came to nothing. The banks continued to slip, and the peat continued to rise up in the bottom of the drain. They asked Robert Anstice to produce a report on the condition of the drain in 1816, but it was 1818 before the report was produced and highlighted the poor state of repair of the system. They also asked for a report on ways to make the bridges wider, but nothing came of it. Ten years later, they commissioned another report, but the local landowners took matters into their own hands and asked Josiah Easton to inspect the drain.|$|E
25|$|Resolving the {{statutory}} conflict {{in this way}} allows the disparate-impact prohibition {{to work in a}} manner that is consistent with other provisions of Title VII, including the prohibition on adjusting employment-related test scores on the basis of race. See §2000e–2(l). Examinations like those administered by the City create legitimate expectations on <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who took the tests. As is the case with any promotion exam, some of the firefighters here invested substantial time, money, and personal commitment in preparing for the tests. Employment tests can be an important part of a neutral selection system that safeguards against the very racial animosities Title VII was intended to prevent. Here, however, the firefighters saw their efforts invalidated by the City in sole reliance upon race-based statistics. If an employer cannot rescore a test based on the candidates' race, §2000e–2(l), then it follows a fortiori that it may not take the greater step of discarding the test altogether to achieve a more desirable racial distribution of promotion-eligible candidates— absent a strong basis in evidence that the test was deficient and that discarding the results is necessary to avoid violating the disparate-impact provision. Restricting an employer's ability to discard test results (and thereby discriminate against qualified candidates on the basis of their race) also is in keeping with Title VII's express protection of bona fide promotional examinations.|$|E

Many military historians have cited the Battle of Carillon as a classic example of tactical military incompetence. Abercrombie, confident of a quick victory, ignored several viable military options, such as flanking the French breastworks, waiting for his artillery, or laying siege to the fort. Instead, relying on a flawed report from a young military engineer, and ignoring some of that engineer's recommendations, he decided in favor of a direct frontal assault on the thoroughly entrenched French, without the benefit of artillery. Montcalm, while concerned about the weak military position of the fort, conducted the defense with spirit. However, due in part to a lack of time, he committed strategic errors in preparing the area's defenses that a competent attacker could have exploited, and he made tactical errors that made the attacker's job easier.|$|E

One North Carolina doctor described [...] "an unwritten policy on <b>the</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> who control the State to eliminate the Negro Mississippian either by driving {{him out of the}} State or starving him to death." [...] When Stennis and Eastland accused the doctor of committing libel against the welfare workers of their state, he invited them and other state officials to go see conditions for themselves, to which none accepted. On the second day of proceedings Secretary Freeman and Senator Javits got into a shouting match, with the senator arguing that the secretary should disregard local authorities' opinions, declare an emergency, and immediately supply food to the region. He remarked, [...] "We {{seem to be able to}} send airplanes to the Congo in a terrible hurry. We first heard of the desperation point of poor Mississippi Negroes 18 months agoand we are still hearing that there is starvation in Mississippi."

40|$|Haematite and {{goethite}} are {{the predominant}} pedogenic mineral phases in terra rossa from Istria. Limited variation of selected Fe oxide characteristics in analysed samples indicates the specific pedogenic {{environment in which}} terra rossa is formed. The mean value of the Fed/Fet ratio, taken as an index of weathering is 0. 7 and reflects quite {{a high degree of}} weathering of Fe-containing primary silicates. Relatively uniform Fed/clay ratios clearly indicate a predominance of co-illuviation of clay and Fe oxides. Low values of Feo point to the low content of poorly crystalline Fe oxides in analysed terra rossa. Feo/Fed ratios in the analysed profiles vary. In <b>the</b> upper <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pomer, Porec and Novigrad profiles Feo/Fed ratios are higher than in <b>the</b> lower <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> profiles which may be explained as a result of different pedogenic environments and/or additions of external materials in <b>the</b> upper <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>those</b> profiles. <b>The</b> lack of positive correlation between Mnd and clay and Mnd and Fed is a consequence of remobilization of manganese due to hydromorphic processes which post-dated co-illuviation of clay and Fe oxides. During the Late Tertiary and Quaternary the pedogenic environment on hard carbonate rocks of the Jurassic-Cretaceous-Palaeogene carbonate plain of southern and western Istria generally remained suitable for rubification. However, (Neo) tectonic activity and the input of external material, as well as various climatic fluctuations might have significantly effected terra rossa through the processes of erosion, colluviation, yellowing and secondary hydromorphy...|$|R
