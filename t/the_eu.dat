This was backed up by requests from other nations including Japan and New Zealand to permit metric-only labelling as an aid to trade with those countries. Opinion in the United States was split – a bill to permit metric-only labelling at the federal level was to have been introduced in 2005 but significant opposition from the Food Marketing Institute, representing US grocers, has delayed the introduction of the bill. During a routine decennial review of the directive in 2008, <b>the</b> <b>EU</b> postponed the sunset clause for dual units indefinitely.|$|E

40|$|The article {{seeks to}} explain the {{emergence}} of <b>the</b> European Union (<b>EU)</b> ’s international investment policy since the 1980 s. The article develops two competing explanations.

The article traces <b>the</b> <b>EU’s</b> involvement in international investment policy through history. It examines policy-making instances, which shaped <b>the</b> <b>EU’s</b> de facto competences in international investment negotiations and its legal competences under European law.

First, has <b>the</b> <b>EU's</b> comprehensive approach been able to supersede the compartmentalisation of <b>the</b> <b>EU's</b> political system?

These questions are answered by investigating the nexus between <b>the</b> <b>EU's</b> security, democracy, development and humanitarian aid policies in Chad from 2006 onwards. This analysis confirms the compartmentalisation scenario, especially regarding development and humanitarian aid where the relation with security policies was at times openly conflicting.
