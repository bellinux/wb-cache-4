5|$|Alex Cox had <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> Mars Attacks {{film in the}} 1980s before Burton and Gems began {{development}} in 1993. When Gems turned in his first draft in 1994, Warner Bros. commissioned rewrites from Gems, Burton, Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski {{in an attempt to}} lower the budget to $60 million. The final production budget came to $80 million, while Warner Bros. spent another $20 million on the Mars Attacks! marketing campaign. Filming took place from February to November 1996. The film was shot in California, Nevada, Kansas, Arizona and Argentina. The soundtrack became famous for the Martians' quirky speech pattern, which was created by reversing the sound of a duck's quack.|$|E
5|$|Newspapers {{across the}} country defended the union workers, and the trio decided to assassinate Frick. They {{believed}} the assassination would arouse the working class to unite and revolt against the capitalist system. Berkman's plan was to assassinate Frick and then kill himself; Goldman was to explain Berkman's motives after his death; and Aronstam was to follow Berkman {{in the event that}} he failed in his mission. Emulating his Russian idols, Berkman <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> bomb, but when that failed, he went to Pittsburgh with the plan to use a handgun.|$|E
5|$|Washington shared {{time at the}} Trail Blazers {{power forward}} spot with Maurice Lucas at first, but after Lucas' trade to the New Jersey Nets, he became the {{full-time}} starter. He played three seasons in Portland, during which he earned {{a spot in the}} 1980 NBA All-Star Game, after some of the top players sat out due to injury. During that All-Star weekend, which was held in Landover, Maryland, nearby American U. held a halftime ceremony in which they retired Washington's number. He was named a team captain for the following season. In his post-punch career, numerous players, coaches, and officials noted that he became less aggressive on the court out of fear of getting into another fight; something he never did. Washington started experiencing pain in his back and knees during the 1980–81 season. The pain became unbearable during the 1981–82 season, and he retired in January 1982 after missing all but 20 games. In 1987, after more than five years out of the league, he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> comeback with the Warriors, but lasted only eight games on the roster (playing in six of them) before being cut.|$|E

25|$|The British {{government}} {{was able to}} summon {{a large amount of}} public support, including the nationalist press, for the excesses committed on such communities. This is because the Criminal Tribes Act was posed widely as a social reform measure which reformed criminals through work. However, when they <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> living like everybody else, they did not find work outside the settlement because of public prejudice and ostracisation. The situation has continued to this day.|$|E

However, only three Croatians provided testimony which supported the notion that there were British tanks in the proximity of the column, but with no mention of such a grave incident. These kinds of unconfirmed reports of British military involvement, coupled with the actually legitimate acts of repatriation, were subsequently exaggerated by Ustaša supporters, particularly in the Croatian diaspora, in biased published works to accuse the British of war crimes.|$|E

Being a bodyguard for Gallucci was considered an unsafe way to make a living, as ten of them had been killed. The year before, Gallucci was wounded and two of his bodyguards were killed when he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> collection in a shop on First Avenue.

The Courtney-coached crew {{continued}} to build on their lead while Harvard sputtered and fell well behind Yale. Throughout the race, Cornell’s coxswain, Freddie Colson, motivated his teammates by reminding them of what their critic had said about them before the race.

25|$|Caesar {{addressed}} {{the people and}} asked Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus, the other consul, if he disapproved of the law. Calpurnius Bibulus just {{said that he would}} not tolerate any innovations during his year of office. Caesar did not ask any questions to other officials. Instead he brought forward the two most influential men in Rome, Pompey and Crassus, who were private citizens. They both declared their support for the law. Caesar asked Pompey if he would help him against the opponents of the law. Pompey said that he would and Crassus seconded him. Bibulus, supported by three plebeian tribunes, obstructed the vote. When he ran out of excuses for delaying he declared a sacred period for all the remaining days of the year. This meant that the people could not legally even meet in their assembly. Caesar ignored him and set date for the vote. The senate met at the house of Calpurnius Bibulus because it had not been convened. It planned that Bibulus was to oppose the law so that it would look that the senate was overcome by force, rather than through inaction. On the day of the vote Bibulus forced {{his way through the crowd}} with his followers to the temple of Castor where Caesar was making his speech. When he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> speech he and his followers were pushed down the steps. There was a scuffle and some of the tribunes were wounded. Bibulus defied some men who had daggers, but he was dragged away by his friends. Cato pushed through the crowd and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> speech, but was lifted up and carried away by Caesar’s supporters. He made a second attempt, but nobody listened to him.|$|E
