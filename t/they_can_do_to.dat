25|$|Most {{charges of}} {{discrimination}} based on price are difficult to verify, without significant documentation. Studies indicate that less than 10% of all {{discrimination based on}} price is actually reported to any authority or regulatory body, and {{much of this is}} through class-action lawsuits. Furthermore, while a number of monitoring services and consumer interest groups take an interest in this form of discrimination, there is very little <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> change it. Most discrimination based on price occurs in situations without a standardized price list that can be compared against. In the cases of per diem charges, this is easily concealed as few consumers can exchange estimates and work rates, and even if they do the business in question can claim that the services provided had different baseline costs, conditions, etc.|$|E
25|$|Most of the area's native mammal {{species are}} present in the wilderness, with the {{exception}} of grizzly bears, which have become locally extinct. Gray wolves were reintroduced to the SNRA amidst controversy in the mid-1990s and now occupy most of the forest except for the Minidoka District. They were reintroduced to restore the ecosystem stability that they provide as top predators, including managing high elk populations, which had inhibited new vegetation growth. Opponents to the reintroduction included hunters concerned that wolves would inhibit their ability to hunt the highest number of game species possible, ranchers concerned for the welfare of their animals, and land developers concerned that a species listed under the Endangered Species Act may restrict what <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> their land. Plans for the reintroduction of grizzly bears to central Idaho have been proposed since the 1990s, but have not progressed because of concerns similar to those with the wolf reintroduction but also concerns for personal safety. The wilderness contains habitat for wolverines and the endangered Canada lynx, but no recent sightings of these species have been reported.|$|E

She had met him at My Friend’s Place, an organization that helps homeless youth find shelter, work, health care and education. His acceptance speech encouraged musicians to learn more about homeless youth in Los Angeles and what <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> help at Cyrus's Facebook page.

500|$|Eragon {{becomes a}} Dragon Rider through his bond with Saphira. He {{is the only}} known Rider in Alagaësia other than King Galbatorix, who, {{with the help of}} the now-dead Forsworn, a group of {{thirteen}} dragon riders loyal to Galbatorix, killed every other Rider a hundred years ago. On the journey, Brom teaches Eragon sword fighting, magic, the ancient elvish language, and the ways of the Dragon Riders. [...] Their travels bring them to the city of Teirm, where they meet with Brom's friend Jeod. Eragon's fortune is told by the witch Angela, and her companion, the werecat Solembum, gives Eragon some mysterious advice. With Jeod's help, they are able to track the Ra'zac to the southern city of Dras-Leona. Although they manage to infiltrate the city, Eragon encounters the Ra'zac in a cathedral and he and Brom are forced to flee. Later that night, their camp is ambushed by the Ra'zac. A stranger named Murtagh rescues them, but Brom is gravely injured. Saphira watches over Brom as the night progresses, yet when morning comes they realize there is nothing <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> save him. Brom gives Eragon his blessing, reveals that he was also once a dragon rider and that his dragon's name was Saphira, and dies. Saphira then encases Brom in a tomb made of a diamond.|$|E

2500|$|But {{how does}} Deleuze square his pessimistic diagnoses with his ethical naturalism? Deleuze claims that {{standards}} of value are internal or immanent: to live well is to fully express one's power, {{to go to}} the limits of one's potential, rather than to judge what exists by non-empirical, transcendent standards. Modern society still suppresses difference and alienates persons from what <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>do.</b> <b>To</b> affirm reality, which is a flux of change and difference, we must overturn established identities and so become all that we can become—though we cannot know what that is in advance. The pinnacle of Deleuzean practice, then, is creativity. [...] "Herein, perhaps, lies the secret: to bring into existence and not to judge. If it is so disgusting to judge, it is not because everything is of equal value, but on the contrary because what has value can be made or distinguished only by defying judgment. What expert judgment, in art, could ever bear on the work to come?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Stories {{are based}} on values passed down by older generations to shape the {{foundation}} of the community. Storytelling is used as a bridge for knowledge and understanding allowing the values of [...] "self" [...] and [...] "community" [...] to connect and be learned as a whole. Storytelling in the Navajo community for example allows for community values to be learned at different times and places for different learners. Stories are told from the perspective of other people, animals, or the natural elements of the earth. In this way, children learn to value their place in the world as a person in relation to others. Typically, stories are used as an informal learning tool in Indigenous American communities, and can act as an alternative method for reprimanding children's bad behavior. In this way, stories are non-confrontational, which allows the child to discover for themselves what they did wrong and what <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> adjust the behavior.|$|E
2500|$|A {{variation}} of downloadable content is expansion packs. Unlike DLC, expansion packs add a whole section {{to the game}} that either already existed in the game's code or was recently developed after the game had already been released. Expansions add new maps, missions, weapons, {{and other things that}} weren't previously accessible in the original game. An example of an expansion is Bungie's most recent game, Destiny, when they released the [...] expansion. The expansion added new weapons, new maps, higher levels, and also remade old missions so that the difficulty would be meet the new levels that were added to the characters. Expansions are added to the base game to help prolong the life of the game itself until the company is able to produce a sequel or a new game all together. Developers at times plan out their games life and already have the code for the expansion in the game but inaccessible by players and they would unlock the expansions as time went on to the players, sometimes at no extra cost and other times it costs extra to get the expansion. There are also some developers who make the game and then make the expansions as time goes on so that they could see what the players would like to have and what <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>to</b> make the game better. There are also expansions that are set apart from the original game and are considered a stand-alone game, an example of that is Ubisoft's expansion [...] Freedom's Cry which takes place control of a different character than that of the original game.|$|E
