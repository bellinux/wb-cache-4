He goes on further to argue that we do not assume newborn infants, people suffering from neurodegenerative brain diseases or people with learning disabilities experience less pain <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>would.</b>|$|E

2500|$|He {{declined}} to reassess the alternative, objective test of entrapment proposed by Justice Owen Roberts in his Sorrells concurrence, {{that the focus}} should be on how the government acted rather than the defendant's state of mind. He believed that such a focus would unnecessarily burden prosecutors as {{they would not be}} able to raise predisposition in response to any defense attempt to examine police conduct; and that lower courts had ruled that juries should be allowed to consider entrapment, not judges as Roberts had proposed. [...] "To dispose of this case on the ground suggested would entail both overruling a leading decision of this Court and brushing aside the possibility that we would be creating more problems <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> supposedly be solving," [...] he said in conclusion.|$|E
2500|$|Although serial {{correlation}} {{does not affect}} the consistency of [...] the estimated regression coefficients, it does affect our ability to conduct valid statistical tests. First, the F-statistic to test for overall significance of the regression may be inflated under positive {{serial correlation}} because the mean squared error (MSE) will tend to underestimate the population error variance. Second, positive serial correlation typically causes the ordinary least squares (OLS) standard errors for the regression coefficients to underestimate the true standard errors. As a consequence, if positive serial correlation is present in the regression, standard linear regression analysis will typically lead us to compute artificially small standard errors for the regression coefficient. These small standard errors will cause the estimated t-statistic to be inflated, suggesting significance where perhaps there is none. The inflated t-statistic, may in turn, lead us to incorrectly reject null hypotheses, about population values of the parameters of the regression model more often <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> if the standard errors were correctly estimated.|$|E
2500|$|Rufus Wilmot Griswold, a {{well-known}} critic and anthologist {{as well as}} Poe's greatest rival, took over editing after Poe's departure in April 1842. The replacement was so quick, a rumor persisted for years that Poe went to work one day and saw Griswold already in his chair. Though the story is not true, Griswold's hiring and Poe's departure were somewhat controversial. As reported in the Washington Index Jesse E. Dow wrote: [...] "We would give more for Edgar A. Poe's toe nail, <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> for Rueful Grizzle's soul, unless we wanted a milk-strainer. Them's our sentiments." [...] Griswold was reportedly paid a salary of $1000 a year, $200 more than Poe. As an editor, Griswold had some success, including a contract with Henry Wadsworth Longfellow to write for Graham's exclusively for a time. Longfellow was paid about $50 for each poem printed. Graham's {{was also the first}} to publish Longfellow's play The Spanish Student in 1842; he was paid $150 for it.|$|E

While we can't talk about DLC right now, I'd say the content easily amounts to {{hundreds and hundreds of}} hours.

On October 14, 2011, Justin Richmond, confirmed that it won't be releasing any downloadable content for Uncharted 3: Drake's Deceptions single-player mode.

2500|$|When {{the case}} was resolved, control of the Legacy of Kain {{trademark}} belonged to Crystal Dynamics, and Kain II was either canceled or superseded when Shifter became Soul Reaver.

He said that [...] "many people ask us if we like the direction they have gone in but it is so alien to what we created it is pointless to answer now. We understand that some people love the Soul Reaver series and we think that is great. However, it is not what we would ever have done". In a 2008 interview, he elaborated his sentiment that [...] "if you look at Legacy of Kain where it is right now -- so diluted, so dysfunctional -- as a property itself, it's pretty much gone in a completely different direction <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> have ever taken it. [...] Even if the developer's good, and I think Crystal Dynamics is not a bad developer, you get this dilution of the content, because the original author is gone".|$|E
2500|$|Sites such as Facebook are {{becoming}} increasingly popular tools for methods of ending relationships and friendships, proving that although new media is {{being used as a}} tool for connecting with individuals, it is now creating new problems associated with disconnecting from others. Instead of the traditional phone call or face-to-face interaction between individuals, people are now starting to end relationships by simply changing their relationship status, knowing full well that their significant other will see it shortly. The problem with that is that you are left with no closure and the entire online world now knows you are no longer in a relationship. In a 2010 study conducted online, nearly one-quarter of the 1,000 individuals surveyed found out that their own relationship was over by seeing it on Facebook. New media websites have made our private lives much more public, {{especially when it comes to}} breaking up, since updates are able to be immediately viewed by everyone in our networks (which tend to be more people <b>than</b> <b>we</b> <b>would</b> normally tell personally); for example, having friends comment on your newly changed [...] "single" [...] relationship status, and having to explain what happened can be distressing.|$|E
