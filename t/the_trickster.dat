5|$|Since the Bronze Age of Comics, the Joker {{has been}} {{interpreted}} as an archetypal trickster, displaying talents for cunning intelligence, social engineering, pranks, theatricality, and idiomatic humor. Like <b>the</b> <b>trickster,</b> the Joker alternates between malicious violence and clever, harmless whimsy. He is amoral and not driven by ethical considerations, but by a shameless and insatiable nature, and although his actions are condemned as evil, he is necessary for cultural robustness. <b>The</b> <b>trickster</b> employs amoral and immoral acts to destabilize {{the status quo and}} reveal cultural, political, and ethical hypocrisies that society attempts to ignore. However, the Joker differs in that his actions typically only benefit himself. The Joker possesses abnormal body imagery, reflecting an inversion of order. <b>The</b> <b>trickster</b> is simultaneously subhuman and superhuman, a being that indicates a lack of unity in body and mind. In Arkham Asylum: A Serious House on Serious Earth, the Joker serves as Batman's trickster guide through the hero's own psyche, testing him in various ways before ultimately offering to cede his rule of the Asylum to Batman.|$|E
5|$|The game {{continues}} {{the story of}} Garrett (voiced by Stephen Russell), the cynical master thief who defeated <b>the</b> <b>Trickster.</b> Pursuing Garrett is the new sheriff, Gorman Truart (voiced by Sam Babbitt), who has imposed a zero tolerance policy on crime. Viktoria (voiced by Terri Brosius), the former ally of <b>the</b> <b>Trickster,</b> eventually joins with Garrett to combat the Mechanists. The game's primary antagonist {{is the founder of}} the Mechanists, Father Karras (also voiced by Russell), a mentally unstable inventor who despises the natural world.|$|E
5|$|To {{reach the}} cathedral, Garrett ventures through Old Quarter, a haunted, {{abandoned}} district of the City. Through {{an opening in}} the cathedral, The Eye informs Garrett of a nearby Keeper sanctuary, where he may learn how to unseal the cathedral. There, Garrett discovers that the cathedral was sealed to prevent the City's destruction by <b>the</b> <b>Trickster.</b> He learns that there are four talismans needed to remove the seal: two hidden in ancient ruins beneath the City, and two inside a Hammerite temple (in Thief Gold, one talisman is in possession of the mages and another was found at an opera house after it was taken from the caves below, while the other two are in the Lost City and the Hammerite Temple as in the original game). Garrett recovers the talismans and returns to the cathedral. After unsealing the cathedral, he learns that its inhabitants had been killed and made undead by The Eye. He returns The Eye to Constantine, who reveals himself to be <b>the</b> <b>Trickster.</b> Viktoria says that The Eye requires a flesh eye to function; she binds Garrett with vines and removes his right eye. <b>The</b> <b>Trickster</b> places it on the gemstone, and the two disappear through a portal. Garrett, left for dead, is found and freed by two Keepers. During his escape from the Trickster's mansion, he learns that <b>the</b> <b>Trickster</b> plans to use The Eye to revert the world to a wild state.|$|E

5|$|I will confess {{up front}} that I love Anonymous, {{but not because}} I think they're the heroes.

But they are not your personal army – that's Rule 44 – yes, there are rules. And when they do something, it never goes quite as planned. The internet has no neat endings.|$|E

25|$|In addition, {{some of the}} Norse gods {{were capable}} of {{changing}} sex at will, for example Loki, <b>the</b> <b>trickster</b> god, frequently disguised himself as a woman. In one myth, he turned himself into a mare and, after having sex with the stallion Svaðilfari, he {{gave birth to a}} foal. Comparison of a man to a child-bearing woman was a common insult in Scandinavia, and some myths say that Loki is bisexual.|$|E
25|$|A later {{sixteenth century}} Scottish {{attitude}} to {{the futility of}} the battle was given by Robert Lindsay of Pitscottie, in the words he attributed to Patrick Lord Lindsay at council before the engagement. Lord Lindsay advised the King withdraw, comparing their situation to an honest merchant playing dice with a trickster, and wagering a gold rose-noble against a bent halfpenny. Their King was the gold piece, England <b>the</b> <b>trickster,</b> and Thomas Howard the halfpenny.|$|E
25|$|In theory, Jungian archetypes {{refer to}} unclear {{underlying}} forms or the archetypes-as-such from which emerge images and motifs {{such as the}} mother, the child, <b>the</b> <b>trickster,</b> and the flood among others.

However {{it is common for}} the term archetype to be used interchangeably to refer to both archetypes-as-such and archetypal images.|$|E

25|$|Archetypal {{literary}} criticism argues that archetypes determine {{the form and}} function of literary works, and therefore, that a text's meaning is shaped by cultural and psychological myths. Archetypes are the unknowable basic forms personified or concretized in recurring images, symbols, or patterns which may include motifs such as the quest or the heavenly ascent, recognizable character types such as <b>the</b> <b>trickster</b> or the hero, symbols such as the apple or snake, or images such as crucifixion (as in King Kong, or Bride of Frankenstein) are all already laden with meaning when employed in a particular work.|$|E
