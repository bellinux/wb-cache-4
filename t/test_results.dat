5|$|A {{scientific}} study of the water quality parameters of physico-chemical and microbiological characteristics and role of phumdis in the Loktak Lake has been conducted by collecting surface water samples on monthly basis from 15 stations, representing 5 zones; northern, western, eastern, middle and southern. The <b>test</b> <b>results</b> indicated that water quality in the phumdi area was poor in {{the northern and southern}} zones of the lake; <b>test</b> <b>results</b> indicated low dissolved oxygen, low pH (normal range for pH in surface water systems is 6.5 to 8.5) high CO2 and high Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) but the water quality was good in the open water area. Assessment of the total nitrogen content of the macrophyte species of phumdis indicated that the following were present in descending order: Salvinia natans (1.8%), Zizania latifolia (1.6%), Capillipedium sp. (1.3%), Brachiaria mutica (1.2%), Cyperus brevifolius (1.2%), Echinochloa stagnina (1.0%), Phragmites karka (1.0%) and Hedychium coranarium (0.94%). The <b>test</b> <b>results</b> confirmed the fact that the phumdis were efficient in absorbing nutrients from the lake water. However, they deteriorated water quality due to reduced light penetration and accumulation of organic matter in the lake ecosystem.|$|E

In some jurisdictions, suppliers of breathing gases are required by legislation to periodically test the quality of compressed air produced by their equipment and to display the <b>test</b> <b>results</b> for public information. The standards for industrial gas purity and filling equipment and procedures may allow some contaminants at levels unsafe for breathing, and their use in breathing gas mixtures at high pressure could be harmful or fatal.|$|E

Methods that require observation {{of one or more}} of the three primary fertility signs (basal body temperature, cervical mucus, and cervical position) are known as symptoms-based methods. Urine test kits are available that detect the LH surge that occurs 24 to 36 hours before ovulation; these are known as ovulation predictor kits (OPKs). Computerized devices that interpret basal body temperatures, urinary <b>test</b> <b>results,</b> or changes in saliva are called fertility monitors.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{maiden flight}} in March 1958, {{evaluation}} of the RP-77D by the U.S. Army took place throughout the remainder of that year, nearly 40 test flights being conducted. Although the <b>test</b> <b>results</b> were generally satisfactory, {{it was determined that}} the performance of the aircraft was an insufficient improvement over existing types in service to have the aircraft ordered into production, and the project was cancelled, along with the improved RP-86, a dedicated reconnaissance variant.|$|E

OLSR was used as a routing protocol and NRL Mobile Network Emulator (MNE) for dynamic topology control and manipulation. Five Linux based laptops, equipped with IEEE 802. 11 b wireless network cards were used for testbed implementation.

40|$|The {{effect of}} prior {{administration}} of 400 mg of cimetidine {{on the outcome}} of the PABA test was investigated. In 8 patients the PABA <b>test</b> <b>result</b> rose with on average 27. 5 % after the administration of cimetidine. Four of them were selected for these investigations, because a much lower PABA <b>test</b> <b>result</b> had been obtained than was expected from the Lundh <b>test</b> <b>result.</b> In one patient, the low PABA <b>test</b> <b>result</b> was in conflict with faecal fat excretion and the clinical condition. Three patients were selected with severe pancreatic dysfunction, as demonstrated by the PABA test, Lundh test and faecal fat excretion. The change effected by cimetidine was shown to be significantly related to duodenal pH and mean trypsin activity as measured in the Lundh test. In a control group of four patients with a PABA <b>test</b> <b>result</b> in the normal range, no significant effect of cimetidine administration was seen. The beneficial effect of cimetidine can be explained by its known inhibiting influence on gastric acid production, resulting in higher intraduodenal pH with subsequent enhanced enzymatic activity. The importance of intraduodenal pH for the PABA <b>test</b> <b>result</b> is further stressed by these result...|$|R

5|$|Many HIV-positive {{people are}} unaware {{that they are}} {{infected}} with the virus. For example, in 2001 less than 1% of the sexually active urban population in Africa had been tested, and this proportion is even lower in rural populations. Furthermore, in 2001 only 0.5% of pregnant women attending urban health facilities were counselled, tested or receive their <b>test</b> <b>results.</b> Again, this proportion is even lower in rural health facilities. Since donors may therefore be unaware of their infection, donor blood and blood products used in medicine and medical research are routinely screened for HIV.|$|E

The aircraft became operational with Russian Naval Aviation (AV-MP) in 1993.

40|$|The {{psychological}} impact of an unfavorable genetic <b>test</b> <b>result</b> for counselees {{at risk for}} hereditary cancer seems to be limited: only 10 - 20 % of counselees have psychological problems after testing positive for a known familial mutation. The objective {{of this study was}} to find prognostic factors that can predict which counselees are most likely to develop psychological problems after presymptomatic genetic testing. Counselees with a 50 % risk of BRCA 1 / 2 or Lynch syndrome completed questionnaires at three time-points: after receiving a written invitation for a genetic counseling intake (T 1), 2 - 3 days after receiving their DNA <b>test</b> <b>result</b> (T 2), and 4 - 6 weeks later (T 3). The {{psychological impact}} of the genetic <b>test</b> <b>result</b> was examined shortly and 4 - 6 weeks after learning their <b>test</b> <b>result.</b> Subsequently, the influence of various potentially prognostic factors on psychological impact were examined in the whole group. Data from 165 counselees were analyzed. Counselees with an unfavorable outcome did not have more emotional distress, but showed significantly more cancer worries 4 - 6 weeks after learning their <b>test</b> <b>result.</b> Prognostic factors for cancer worries after genetic testing were pre-existing cancer worries, being single, a high risk perception of getting cancer, and an unfavorable <b>test</b> <b>result.</b> Emotional distress was best predicted by pre-existing cancer worries and pre-existing emotional distress. The psychological impact of an unfavorable genetic <b>test</b> <b>result</b> appears considerable if it is measured as "worries about cancer. " Genetic counselors should provide additional guidance to counselees with many cancer worries, emotional distress, a high risk perception or a weak social network...|$|R

5|$|Proposals were {{submitted}} by Bell, Boeing Vertol/Grumman team, Hughes, Lockheed, and Sikorsky. In July 1973, the U.S. Department of Defense selected finalists Bell and Hughes Aircraft's Toolco Aircraft Division (later Hughes Helicopters). This began the phase 1 of the competition. Each company built prototype helicopters {{and went through}} a flight test program. Hughes' Model 77/YAH-64A prototype first flew on 30 September 1975, while Bell's Model 409/YAH-63A prototype first flew on 1 October 1975. After evaluating the <b>test</b> <b>results,</b> the Army selected Hughes' YAH-64A over Bell's YAH-63A in 1976. Reasons for selecting the YAH-64A included its more damage tolerant four-blade main rotor and the instability of the YAH-63's tricycle landing gear arrangement.|$|E
5|$|The {{commission}} {{blamed the}} failings primarily on Perkin-Elmer.

NASA found that Perkin-Elmer did not review or supervise the mirror construction adequately, did not assign its best optical scientists to the project (as it had for the prototype), and in particular did not involve the optical designers in the construction and verification of the mirror. While the commission heavily criticized Perkin-Elmer for these managerial failings, NASA was also criticized for not picking up on the quality control shortcomings, such as relying totally on <b>test</b> <b>results</b> from a single instrument.|$|E
