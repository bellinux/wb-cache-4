A micro-propagation system using Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium with 6 -benzylaminopurine (BA), kinetin and naphthaleneacetic acid (NAA) was developed for guava (Psidium guajava L) from mature cultivar. As part of this research various disinfection methods and plant growth regulators were tested in vitro. The most effective method involved treating explants in a 15 % bleach solution for 20 mins followed by culturing them in MS medium with 250 mg/L polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). This method maximized the percentage of bud breakage (53. 3 %), while producing the minimum browning rate (18. 3 %) for the explants. The best observed proliferation rate (71. 2 %) occurred on the MS medium supplemented with 4. 44 μM BA, 4. 65 μM kinetin (KT) and 0. 54 μM NAA. It produced the highest mean number of shoots (2. 2).

40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2011. Includes bibliographical references. Papaya (2 n = 2 x = 18) is a <b>tropical</b> <b>and</b> <b>subtropical</b> <b>fruit</b> tree grown worldwide. In recent years, the papaya genome {{has been}} sequenced and genetic maps have become {{available}} for analyzing genomic {{structure of the}} male-determining region of Y chromosome (MSY). However, research in the cytological aspect lags behind the model crops. One reason for slow cytological progress is because the papaya condensed chromosomes are small and similar in size, {{making it difficult to}} distinguish among them based on chromosomal morphology or staining pattern. By probing nine microsatellite marker-tagged BAC clones on papaya chromosome spread using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques, individual papaya metaphase chromosomes were distinguished and integrated with a genetic map. Then, a detailed cytogenetic map was constructed for the papaya sex chromosome (chromosome 1) by probing 15 microsatellite marker-tagged and 2 cytological-feature associated BAC clones on highly resolved papaya pachytene chromosomes. This cytogenetic map integrated the chromosomal features with genetic and physical data. Analysis of recombination rates along chromosome 1 revealed a small non-recombining region (12. 2 % of chromosome length) where the MSY is located, suggesting that papaya has a pair of young evolving homomorphic sex chromosomes. Sequence analysis of euchromatic and heterochromatic regions on the X chromosome showed an uneven distribution of genes and transposable elements.

It exceeds most <b>tropical</b> <b>and</b> <b>subtropical</b> <b>fruit</b> plants in adaptability and productivity. This thesis {{focused on the}} physiology of freezing tolerance and cold acclimation in guava. Freezing tolerance tests, growth and leaf relative water content measurements, anthocyanin content analyses, and protein analyses were performed on nonacclimated and cold-acclimated leaves of guava cultivars Lucknow- 49 and Ruby y Supreme. The freezing tolerance of nonacclimated leaves were - 2. 3 yC and 2. 7 yC, and enhanced to - 4. 2 yC and - 4. 6 yC after cold acclimation for `Lucknow- 492 ̆ 7 and `Ruby y Supreme 2 ̆ 7, respectively. Growth and leaf relative water content reduced, while anthocyanins accumulated in guava during cold acclimation. Protein analyses which were performed after cold acclimation and drought stress by electrophoresis and immunoblots revealed that three proteins (69, 23. 5, and 17. 4 kDa) accumulated in response to low temperatures, and three proteins (78, 17. 4, and 16 kDa) accumulated in response to drought stress. One common 17. 4 kDa dehydrin accumulated in response to cold and drought stresses. In summary, we indicated that guava possesses some freezing tolerance, and also is able to cold acclimated. Diverse mechanisms are used by guava to tolerate freezing stress. Cold acclimation in guava appears to involve complex physiological and biochemical changes, and also overlapping responses with drought stress...|$|E
40|$|Fruitspotting bugs, Amblypelta nitida Stal, and A. lutescens lutescens Distant (Hemiptera: Coreidae), are polyphagous, native Australian pests of a {{wide range}} of <b>tropical</b> <b>and</b> <b>subtropical</b> <b>fruit</b> and nut crops. Both species occur {{predominantly}} along Australia 2 ̆ 7 s eastern coastline, A. nitida from c. 17 degrees S- 35 degrees S and A. l. lutescens from c. 11 degrees S- 27 degrees S, and as such, they are distributed across some of Australia 2 ̆ 7 s most important horticultural regions. Adults are cryptic and highly mobile, making population monitoring within affected tree crops difficult. Nymphs and adults inject salivary sucrase into plant tissue while feeding; this causes significant damage to fruiting structures and often renders them unsaleable. Despite their economic importance, many aspects of fruitspotting bug biology and ecology remain understudied; their chemical ecology, host-plant relationships, movements into, out of and within crops, and interactions with natural enemies are poorly understood. Currently, control of both species relies on applications of synthetic broad-spectrum insecticides, and the recent withdrawal of endosulfan has resulted in an increased use of more disruptive compounds. This paper reviews current knowledge of fruitspotting bug biology and ecology, and the strategies that are currently employed for control. Importantly, a synthetic lure based on some of the volatile compounds emitted by male A. l. lutescens has recently been developed and incorporated into a prototype trap. The device offers a promising new approach to population monitoring and the development of integrated management strategies for this species. Areas of research critical to the development of sustainable management strategies for fruitspotting bugs include: (1) host-plant relationships between fruitspotting bugs and their crop and non-crop host plants; (2) fruitspotting bug dispersal behaviour and movement patterns between and within crops, and between crops and non-crop vegetation; (3) methods for implementing biological control strategies; (4) utilising pheromone traps for monitoring and capture of fruitspotting bugs; and (5) screening of selective insecticides...|$|E
40|$|The {{macadamia}} nut is a high-value product {{for which there}} is considerable demand: world production currently represents less than one half of a percent of world edible tree nut production. Despite its earlier lack of success in Fiji, the considerable export potential of the crop, particularly {{in the context of the}} growing tourist trade, resulted in the decision to re-assess the potential of the crop in Fiji. These projects covered a short preliminary assessment mission in July and August 1989, and a more detailed examination, over one year, from December 1989, of the possible future development of macadamia in FijiA macadamia production expert, supported by consultants in macadamia genetic improvement and breeding, horticulture and bioclimatology, and farming systems, reviewed the various factors governing the crop's potential, particularly crop physiology, agroclimatology, and the adaptability of various genotypes. Also, training activities were undertaken, including a workshop and specialist training for staff of the Ministry of Primary Industries and Cooperatives. A study tour to Australia and Hawaii allowed two middle-level professional officers to gain experience of large-scale macadamia productionAs a result of the assessment conducted, it was concluded that macadamia deserves to be systematically evaluated as a potential crop in certain, selected areas where factors such as wind risk and temperature should not be limiting. In this regard, a longer- term evaluation of the improved important varieties, a careful selection of sites, and a further study of the farming systems involved, was neededIt was therefore recommended that the Government proceed with a programme for the introduction of a wide range of improved macadamia varieties. These should be observed, and evaluated, in various climatological environments in Fiji, to verify the agronomic and economic viability of the crop. At the same time, a programme investigating other <b>tropical</b> <b>and</b> <b>subtropical</b> <b>fruit</b> crops should be undertaken, with the aim of identifying income-generating opportunitiesThe project therefore prepared a follow-up project proposal for fruit and nut research and development.

40|$|Thesis (PhD (Agric) (Conservation Ecology and Entomology)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. Six tortricid {{species are}} of major {{economic}} {{importance to the}} South African fruit industry. They are the codling moth Cydia pomonella, the oriental fruit moth Grapholita molesta, the false codling moth Thaumatotibia leucotreta, the macadamia nut borer T. batrachopa, the litchi moth Cryptophlebia peltastica and the carnation worm Epichoristodes acerbella. For phytosanitary purposes and to aid the management of population levels of the aforementioned species, their identities at species and population level were investigated using morphological and molecular genetic techniques. Morphological characteristics were used to distinguish and differentiate between the final instar larvae and pupae of the six species. For this purpose the morphology of the final instar larvae and pupae of the Afrotropical species T. leucotreta, T. batrachopa, Cr. peltastica and E. acerbella was described and illustrated using line drawings and scanning electron micrographs. Taxonomic characters found to be useful for {{the identification of the}} larvae were the presence and structure of the anal comb and the number and arrangement of crochets on the prolegs. The pupae could be distinguished based on {{the presence or absence of}} a distinct cremaster, the shape of the spiracle, the position of the setae on the anal rise, the structure of the mouthparts and the length of the procoxa in relation to that of the protarsus. These characters were used to develop keys to distinguish between the tortricid species occurring on <b>tropical</b> <b>and</b> <b>subtropical</b> <b>fruit</b> (T. leucotreta, T. batrachopa and Cr. peltastica) and deciduous fruit (E. acerbella, C. pomonella, G. molesta and T. leucotreta). At population level, molecular techniques were employed to compare geographic populations of each of the six species. Amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) analysis with five selective primer pairs was used to investigate genetic diversity. In addition, host populations of species were compared where relevant. No evidence was found to suggest that populations from different hosts were genetically differentiated. However, geographic populations were found to be genetically distinct in each of the six species, with extensive genetic divergence apparent over local geographic scales and significantly high estimates of population differentiation ranging between Gst = 0. 2625 and 0. 3778. Factors influencing the genetic population structure of the six species were investigated by comparing the amount and distribution of genetic variation between oligophagous and polyphagous species as well as introduced and native species. Results indicated that host range and population history did not have a major effect on population genetic structure. It was therefore suggested that other factors such as limited dispersal were responsible for the extensive genetic divergence observed between geographic populations of each of the six tortricid species. These results should be incorporated into existing pest management programs and taken into consideration when designing new control strategies. This is the first report of its kind to identify, with a high level of accuracy, the aforementioned tortricids and the first to determine the population genetic structure of these species...|$|E

Many persons throughout the united States have eaten "Chinese lychee nuts", which formerly were imported into this country from China in large quantities. The "lychee nut" is the dried form, having about the same relation to the fresh fruit as a raisin does to a grape. In recent years, many persons, in many parts of the country, have had the opportunity to sample fresh fruit produced in Florida. The lychee was introduced into the United States and established successfully in Florida about 1870. Trees were reported to be bearing in that State in 1883. Up to 15 years ago, however, the lychee was still grown very little in Florida, and then, only as a home garden tree. Today, it is being set out in commercial orchards, with possibly as many as 500 acres already planted. In 1952, the Florida Lychee Growers Association was founded by a group of forehanded individuals who saw the need for an organization to disseminate information on lychee culture and to assist in marketing the fruit.

40|$|Fresh {{fruits and}} {{vegetables}} have a short postharvest life and are prone to postharvest losses due to mechanical injury, physiological causes and decay. Low temperature storage (LTS) is widely used as a postharvest treatment applied to delay senescence in vegetables and ornamentals and ripening in fruits, so upholding their postharvest quality. But the problem of its application to <b>tropical</b> <b>and</b> <b>subtropical</b> <b>fruits</b> <b>and</b> vegetables is the susceptibility of these to chilling injury (CI) at temperatures below 12. ̊C. Chilling injury is a physiological disorder that greatly reduces fruit quality, frequently rendering the product unsellable. To increase the tolerance of produce to CI and extend storage life, postharvest protocols such as cold storage coupled with heat treatments, temperature preconditioning, intermittent warming, modified and controlled atmosphere storage, ultraviolet (UV) light, and salicylates and jasmonates treatments have been developed. Membrane damage and reactive oxygen species (ROS) production are multifaceted adverse effects of chilling stress in sensitive {{fruits and vegetables}}. They {{have been attributed to}} the higher CI tolerance of horticultural products to production and accumulation of heat shock proteins (HSPs), suggesting a central role of HSPs in the acquired tolerance to chilling stress. This beneficial action of HSPs is possible thanks to their chaperone activity. Besides chaperone activity, small HSPs (sHSPs) are able to function as membrane stabilizers and ROS scavengers or to act synergistically with antioxidant system. sHSPs {{play a key role in}} maintaining membrane quality attributes such as fluidity and permeability under chilling stress. In fact, the analysis of sHSPs could be envisaged as an ideal method for the assessment of fruits and vegetables' tolerance to CI and for evaluating the efficiency of postharvest treatments in avoiding CI incidence. This review discusses HSPs and their language of action in mitigation of CI and their potential use as biochemical markers to optimize the use of postharvest treatments. It bridges the division between basic and applied research, and proposes the use of HSPs as biochemical markers of CI. © 2013 Elsevier B. V. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
5|$|Volcanic eruptions about 44million {{years ago}} during the Eocene {{deposited}} lavas accompanied by debris flows (lahars) atop the older {{rocks in the}} western part of the province. Containing fragments of shale, siltstone, conglomerates, and breccias, the debris flows entombed plants and animals caught in their paths; the remnants of these ancient flows comprise the rock formations exposed in the Clarno Unit. Preserved in the Clarno Nut Beds are fossils of <b>tropical</b> <b>and</b> <b>subtropical</b> nuts, <b>fruits,</b> roots, branches, and seeds. The Clarno Formation also contains bones, palm leaves longer than , avocado trees, <b>and</b> other <b>subtropical</b> plants from 50million years ago, when the climate was warmer and wetter than it is in the 21stcentury. Large mammals that inhabited this region between 50 and 35million years ago included browsers such as brontotheres and amynodonts, scavengers like the hyaenodonts, as well as Patriofelis and other predators. Eroded remnants of the Clarno stratovolcanoes, once the size of Mount Hood, are still visible near the monument, for example Black Butte, White Butte, and other buttes near Mitchell.|$|R

40|$|The genus Capsicum (pepper) {{comprises}} a {{large number}} of wild and cultivated species. The plants are grown all over the world, primarily in <b>tropical</b> <b>and</b> <b>subtropical</b> countries. The <b>fruits</b> are an excellent source of health-related compounds, such as ascorbic acid (vitamin C), carotenoids (provitamin A), to copherols (vitamin E), flavonoids, and capsaicinoids. Pepper fruits have been used for fresh and cooked consumption, as well as for medicinal purposes, such as treatment of asthma, coughs, sore throats, and toothache. Depending on its uses, there are several main characters important for product quality; pungency, bright attractive colors, highly concentrated extracts, and a small number of seeds are the main characters on which quality is based and priced. Herein, a general overview of biochemical composition, medical properties of these compounds, and characteristics of quality attributes of pepper fruits is presented...|$|R
40|$|The braconid wasp Fopius arisanus (Sonan) is an {{important}} biological control agent of <b>tropical</b> <b>and</b> <b>subtropical</b> pest <b>fruit</b> flies, including two important global pests, the Mediterranean fruit fly (Ceratitis capitata), and the oriental fruit fly (Bactrocera dorsalis). The goal {{of this study was}} to develop foundational genomic resources for this species to provide tools that can be used to answer questions exploring the multitrophic interactions between the host and parasitoid in this important research system. Here, we present a whole genome assembly of F. arisanus, derived from a pool of haploid offspring from a single unmated female. The genome is ∼ 154  Mb in size, with a N 50 contig and scaffold size of 51, 867  bp and 0. 98  Mb, respectively. Utilizing existing RNA-Seq data for this species, as well as publicly available peptide sequences from related Hymenoptera, a high quality gene annotation set, which includes 10, 991 protein coding genes, was generated. Prior to this assembly submission, no RefSeq proteins were present for this species. Parasitic wasps play {{an important}} role in a diverse ecosystem as well as a role in biological control of agricultural pests. This whole genome assembly and annotation data represents the first genome-scale assembly for this species or any closely related Opiine, and are publicly available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Genome and RefSeq databases, providing a much needed genomic resource for this hymenopteran group...|$|R
