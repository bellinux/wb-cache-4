500|$|Milo says {{goodbye and}} drives {{back through the}} tollbooth. Suddenly he is back in his own room, and discovers he has been gone only an hour, though his journey seemed to take weeks. He awakens {{the next day with}} plans to return to the kingdom, but finds the tollbooth gone when he gets home from school. A note instead is there, [...] "For Milo, who now knows the way." [...] The note states that the tollbooth is being sent to another child who needs help finding his {{direction}} in life. Milo is somewhat disappointed but agrees and looks at a now-interesting world around him, concluding that even if he found a way back, he might not have time to go, for <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> do right where he is.|$|E
500|$|He {{was elected}} {{a member of}} the International Astronomical Union in 1966; having twice edited the Union's General Assembly newsletters. He {{attempted}} to establish an International Union of Amateur Astronomers, which failed due to lack of interest. During the 1970s and 80s, he reported on the Voyager and Pioneer programs, often from NASA headquarters. At this time he became increasingly annoyed by conspiracy theorists and reporters who asked him questions such as [...] "Why waste money on space research when <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> be done here?". He said that when asked these type of questions [...] "I know that I'm dealing with an idiot." [...] Another question that annoyed him was [...] "what is the difference between astronomy and astrology?" [...] Despite this he made a point of responding to all letters delivered to his house, and sent a variety of standard replies to letters asking basic questions, as well as those from conspiracy theorists, proponents of hunting and 'cranks'. Despite his fame, his telephone number was always listed in the telephone directory and he was happy to show members of the public his observatory.|$|E
