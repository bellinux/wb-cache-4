This work considers the effects of turbulent eddy size on the thrust and wake behind a porous disc rotor simulator commonly used to represent marine current turbines in small scale experiments. The results show an increase in thrust coefficient with increasing length scale and a corresponding reduction in velocity deficit in the wake. These findings have implications to array special planning and hence energy yields...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedClimate change {{has resulted in}} an increase in naval activity in the Arctic Ocean. While extensive research has been done on the interaction between different forms of ice and conventional steel hulls, little work has been done to assess the potential for composite-hulled vessels to operate safely in Arctic sea lanes. The goal of this experiment was to determine how well a composite hull can withstand ice loading and impacts with free-floating ice and whether a tumblehome, conventional, or a vertical hull performs best in the presence of ice. In order to do this, the <b>tow</b> <b>tank</b> at the Naval Postgraduate School was used. An ice equivalent was found which allowed for repeatable experimentation. Strain gauges were attached to critical locations of the composite plate <b>towed</b> through the <b>tank.</b> Both plate deformation and the resulting hydrodynamic force were measured for various ice conditions. A high-speed camera was used to qualitatively understand the flow characteristics of the ice around the composite plate. Finally, Ansys was used to determine if it was possible to replicate the experimental results.

50|$|A <b>towing</b> <b>tank</b> is a basin, several metres {{wide and}} {{hundreds}} of metres long, equipped with a towing carriage that runs on two rails on either side. The towing carriage can either tow the model or follow the self-propelled model, and is equipped with computers and devices to register or control, respectively, variables such as speed, propeller thrust and torque, rudder angle etc. The <b>towing</b> <b>tank</b> serves for resistance and propulsion tests with towed and self-propelled ship models {{to determine how much}} power the engine will have to provide to achieve the speed laid down in the contract between shipyard and ship owner. The <b>towing</b> <b>tank</b> also serves to determine the maneuvering behaviour in model scale. For this, the self-propelled model is exposed to a series of zig-zag maneuvers at different rudder angle amplitudes. Post-processing of the test data by means of system identification results in a numerical model to simulate any other maneuver like Dieudonné spiral test or turning circles. Additionally, a <b>towing</b> <b>tank</b> can be equipped with a PMM (planar motion mechanism) or a CPMC (computerized planar motion carriage) to measure the hydrodynamic forces and moments on ships or submerged objects under the influence of oblique inflow and enforced motions. The <b>towing</b> <b>tank</b> can also be equipped with a wave generator to carry out seakeeping tests, either by simulating natural (irregular) waves or by exposing the model to a wave packet that yields a set of statistics known as response amplitude operators (acronym RAO), that determine the ship's likely real-life sea-going behavior when operating in seas with varying wave amplitudes and frequencies (these parameters being known as sea states). Modern seakeeping test facilities can determine these RAO statistics, with the aid of appropriate computer hardware and software, in a single test.|$|E

40|$|A unique, highly modular and {{flexible}} underwater system for stereoscopic particle image velocimetry (PIV) measurements is presented. The instrument {{is intended for}} planar three-dimensional velocity measurements in large facilities such as <b>towing</b> <b>tanks</b> and tunnels. A novel stereo-PIV calibration technique is adopted for the probe. The central feature of the proposed technique is that the calibration of the stereoscopic system {{is based upon the}} measurement of a calibrated flow. This is achieved through a first two-dimensional calibration of the measurement plane using a single target point, followed by a perspective and laser sheet thickness optimization that makes use of the measurement of a known flow, e. g. a uniform flow. This technique results in three-dimensional measurements of enhanced accuracy with a simpler calibration phase, which compensates for the mechanical misalignment and eliminates the errors deriving from the classical target dot identification. The technique is particularly well suited for <b>towing</b> <b>tanks</b> and other large facilities. Finally the flow survey around an underwater vehicle by SPIV is presented.
