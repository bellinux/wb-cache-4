40|$|The {{fuel gas}} (LPG) is natural gas {{that has a}} sizable {{reserves}} in Indonesia. With the utilization of gas fuel is expected the problem of energy needs and environmental pollution can be solved. Gasoline engine can be operated by using LPG gas fuel, Nevertheless, the performances of gasoline engine is decrease when it using LPG. This performance reduction {{is caused by the}} different characteristics of the two fuels. One way to improve the performance of these machines is <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> <b>ignition</b> timing so that the ignition timing is more appropriate with the characteristics of LPG gas and gasoline. One way to improve gasoline engine performance that used LPG gas fuel by controlling ignition timming more accurate. Controlling ignition timming is done by sliding angle position on pulser to get ignition timming accurately. The result of test indicated that usage of LPG as fuel on single cylinder gasoline engine result dropping of power till 25...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a control called Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) for photovoltaic (PV) {{system in a}} solar car. The main purpose of this system is to extracts PV power maximally while keeping small losses using a simple design of converter. Working principle of MPPT based fuzzy logic controller (MPPT-FLC) is to get desirable values of reference current and voltage. MPPT-FLC compares them with {{the values of the}} PV 2 ̆ 7 s actual current and voltage to control duty cycle value. Then the duty cycle value is used <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> angle of <b>ignition</b> switch (MOSFET gate) on the Boost converter. The proposed method was shown through simulation performed using PSIM and MATLAB software. Simulation results show that the system is able to improve the PV power extraction efficiency significantly by approximately 98...|$|R
50|$|Performance {{gains are}} {{realized}} by <b>adjusting</b> <b>the</b> <b>ignition</b> timing advance. Different timing {{may result in}} better performance. However, to cope with advanced timing, one must run high-octane gasoline to avoid pre-ignition detonation or pinging. Manufacturers design for a specific timing and this may limit performance accordingly.|$|R

50|$|A phasor is {{a network}} of {{capacitors}} and variable inductors used <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> relative amplitude and phase of the current being distributed to each tower in a directional array. A typical phasor has separate controls <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> phase of the current going to each tower, adjustable power divider controls, and a common point impedance matching network <b>to</b> <b>adjust</b> <b>the</b> system input impedance to 50 ohms with no reactance without disturbing the phase or amplitude of the tower currents.|$|R
25|$|A fuel with {{a higher}} octane rating is less prone to {{knocking}} (extremely rapid and spontaneous combustion by compression) and the control system of any modern car engine {{can take advantage of}} this by <b>adjusting</b> <b>the</b> <b>ignition</b> timing. This will improve energy efficiency, leading to a better fuel economy than the comparisons of energy content different fuels indicate. By increasing the compression ratio, further gains in fuel economy, power and torque can be achieved. Conversely, a fuel with lower octane rating is more prone to knocking and will lower efficiency. Knocking can also cause engine damage. Engines designed to run on 87 octane will not have any additional power/fuel economy from being operated with higher octane fuel.|$|R
