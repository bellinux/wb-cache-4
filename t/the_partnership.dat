5|$|On 18 August 1997, Braathens SAFE {{announced}} a strategic {{partnership with the}} Dutch airline KLM. <b>The</b> <b>partnership</b> replaced the agreement with British Airways, and became active in 1998. Analysts stated that <b>the</b> <b>partnership</b> came {{as a reaction to}} SAS' alliance with Lufthansa, the Star Alliance, that had been created the previous year. Braathens SAFE had also been in negotiations with British Airways. The agreement involved KLM purchasing a 30% stake in Braathens SAFE from Ludvig G. Braathens Rederi for NOK800 million. In addition, Braathens SAFE started flying from several Norwegian cities to KLM's main hub at Schiphol Airport in Amsterdam. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>partnership</b> involved a coordination of scheduling, prices, frequent flyer programs, corporate customer agreements, maintenance and procurement. <b>The</b> <b>partnership</b> also involved cooperation with the American airline Northwest Airlines. In 1997, Braathens SAFE and Transwede had a revenue of NOK5.4 billion and made a profit of NOK206 million, down 88 million from 1996.|$|E

United Nations membership, which Kosovo does not have, is considered to be necessary for NATO membership.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Type II <b>partnerships</b> {{developed}} at <b>the</b> Johannesburg summit demonstrated a paradigm-shifting impact upon sustainable development discourse and the conceptualisation of global environmental governance.

Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>partnerships</b> exemplify <b>the</b> use of transnational governance networks as a mechanism by which to implement environmental policy at local and regional level.
