40|$|A {{model of}} {{randomly}} advected solenoidal field is presented. The model is formally derived by a linearization <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Navier-Stokes equation {{with respect to}} the perturbation to a basic state and by assuming <b>the</b> characteristic time <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basic state to be very short. The model includes a nonlocal (in space) effect through a pressurelike term that keeps the advected field solenoidal, but still yields exact equations for multipoint moments. The advecting field is assumed to be statistically homogeneous and isotropic with zero mean and structure function with exponent xi. An analysis is made <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> steady second-order moments <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solenoidal field in two dimensions. <b>The</b> <b>scaling</b> exponent zeta(l) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> isotropic part (l= 0) and the anisotropic part for the angular wave number l= 2 is obtained analytically or numerically. <b>The</b> <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> isotropic part does not depend on whether the pressurelike term is present or not while <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> anisotropic part is affected by the pressurelike term.

40|$|Effects of size are {{pervasive}} and affect nearly all aspects <b>of</b> <b>the</b> biology <b>of</b> animals and plants. Theoretical scaling {{models have been}} developed to predict <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> size on <b>the</b> functioning <b>of</b> musculo-skeletal systems. Although numerous experimental studies have investigated <b>the</b> effects <b>of</b> size on <b>the</b> movements <b>of</b> skeletal elements during locomotion and feeding in vertebrates, relatively little is known about <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> muscles and bones responsible for the actual movements. Here, we examine <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> external morphology, skeletal elements <b>of</b> <b>the</b> feeding system, and a number of cranial muscles to understand how this may affect the movements observed during suction feeding in the African catfish, Clarias gariepinus. The results show that neither the head nor the cranial elements themselves scale according to geometric similarity models. Relative to head size, distinct changes in the mass and configuration <b>of</b> <b>the</b> feeding structures takes place. Unexpectedly, different cranial muscles show different scaling patterns that ultimately all lead to a positive allometry of muscle cross-sectional area relative to fish head size. This suggests that (1) <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cranial elements cannot be predicted a priori based on <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> external head dimensions and (2) <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> feeding system is optimised towards high force output in the larger animals. An analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> consequences <b>of</b> <b>the</b> observed changes in morphology with size on performance traits, including bite force and jaw closing velocity, suggests a tight link between <b>the</b> <b>scaling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> feeding system and <b>the</b> natural diet <b>of</b> these fish.

5|$|Another {{feature of}} the French Revolutionary Wars was the effect of British {{blockade}} on French movements. The Royal Navy maintained an active close blockade of all major French ports during the conflict, which resulted in every French ship that left port facing attack from squadrons and individual ships patrolling the French and allied coasts. The losses the French Navy suffered {{as a result of}} this strategy were high, and the blockade was so effective that even movement between ports along the French coasts was restricted. In the Indian Ocean however the huge distances between the French bases on Réunion and Isle de France and the British bases in India meant that close blockade was an ineffective strategy: <b>the</b> <b>scale</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> forces required to maintain an effective constant blockade of both islands, as well as the Dutch ports at the Cape of Good Hope and in the Dutch East Indies were too large to be worth their deployment to such a distant part of the world.
