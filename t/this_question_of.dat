500|$|Following the election, {{there was}} unrest near Albany among tenant farmers {{on the land}} owned by Dutch-descended patroons of the van Rensselaer family. [...] These tenancies allowed the landlords {{privileges}} such as enlisting the unpaid labor of tenants, and any breach could result in termination of tenure without compensation for improvements. [...] When sheriff's deputies in Albany County were obstructed from serving eviction writs, Seward was asked to call out the militia. After an all-night cabinet meeting, he did so, though quietly assuring the tenants that he would intervene with the legislature. [...] This mollified the settlers, though Seward proved unable to get the legislature to pass reforming laws. <b>This</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> tenants' rights was not settled until after Seward had left office.|$|E
500|$|During {{the second}} half of 1978, Vietnamese leaders devoted much of their energy towards the {{military}} campaign against the Khmer Rouge regime, by seeking political support from the Soviet Union. In a briefing with Vietnamese Foreign Ministry officials on 25 July 1978, the Soviet chargé d'affaires in Hanoi was told that the Kampuchean Government had deployed 14 of its 17 regular army divisions and 16 local regiments along the border with Vietnam. Then, in early September 1978, Lê Duẩn informed the Soviet ambassador that Vietnam aimed to [...] "solve fully <b>this</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> Kampuchea by the beginning of 1979". While Vietnam was laying the political foundation for the military campaign against Kampuchea, Soviet ships were reported to be unloading military hardware and ammunition in Cam Ranh Bay. In October 1978, Vietnamese radio broadcast what they claimed were accounts of uprisings against the Khmer Rouge regime, urging members of the Kampuchean military either to overthrow the [...] "Pol Pot-Ieng Sary clique" [...] or defect to Vietnam.|$|E

2500|$|<b>This</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> {{the exact}} {{relationship}} between the Father and the Son (a part of the theological science of Christology) had been raised some fifty years before Arius, when Paul of Samosata was deposed in 269 for agreeing with those who used the word homoousios (Greek for same substance) to express {{the relation between the}} Father and the Son. This term was thought at that time to have a Sabellian tendency, [...] though—as events showed—this was on account of its scope not having been satisfactorily defined. In the discussion which followed Paul's deposition, Dionysius, the Bishop of Alexandria, used much the same language as Arius did later, and correspondence survives in which Pope Dionysius blames him for using such terminology. Dionysius responded with an explanation widely interpreted as vacillating. [...] The Synod of Antioch, which condemned Paul of Samosata, had expressed its disapproval of the word homoousios in one sense, while Bishop Alexander undertook its defense in another. [...] Although the controversy seemed to be leaning toward the opinions later championed by Arius, no firm decision had been made on the subject; in an atmosphere so intellectual as that of Alexandria, the debate seemed bound to resurface—and even intensify—at some point in the future.|$|E
2500|$|Muriel's {{participation}} in the Student Christian Movement (SCM) at McGill was a life-changing experience. [...] "Looking back over the years," [...] she told her biographer, [...] "I've felt always {{that the experience of}} the SCM {{was the most important thing}} that happened to me, probably the most important aspect of my college life, more important than any of the courses that I took." [...] The SCM conducted small study groups in which students were encouraged to discuss their beliefs freely and come to their own conclusions about how to interpret the Gospels. For Muriel, such discussions were unsettling and painful, yet also exciting. [...] "I had always before treated the Gospel as though its authors had set down day by day events in the life of Jesus as they happened," [...] she said. [...] "To face the implication that nothing was written down until after Jesus died was itself a shock. But <b>this</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> free and open discussion, that everything needed to be challenged, to be questioned, to be talked about, that was completely opposite to the authoritarian approach in the church." [...] The SCM study groups fostered independent thinking. [...] "This was the beginning of my adult search for truth," [...] Muriel told her biographer, [...] "and my sense that all things must be open to me." ...|$|E

2500|$|After the 1995 {{referendum}} very narrowly defeated {{a proposal}} on Quebec sovereignty, Chrétien started to champion what eventually become the Clarity Act {{as part of}} his [...] "Plan B". In August 1996, the lawyer Guy Bertrand won a ruling in a Quebec court declaring that the sovereignty question was not just a political matter between Quebec City and Ottawa, but also a legal matter which was subjected to the rulings of the courts. Following that ruling, Chrétien decided that here was a means of defeating the Quebec sovereignty movement, and in September 1996, ordered the Justice Minister Allan Rock to take <b>this</b> <b>question</b> <b>of</b> the precise legality of Quebec separating to the Supreme Court. Stéphane Dion advised Chrétien that if the federal government won the reference to the Supreme Court as expected, that the government should then draft a bill that stated what were the precise rules for Quebec to leave, telling the Prime Minister if the people of Quebec could be shown how difficult it would be to leave, then support for separatism would fall. Along the same lines, Dion started to send much publicised open letters to Quebec ministers questioning the assumptions behind the separatist case. The new policy of [...] "Plan B" [...] towards Quebec created much tension within the Cabinet with the [...] "soft federalist" [...] fraction led by Martin opposing the [...] "Plan B" [...] policy, especially the Clarity Act, and instead preferred a new Meech Lake-like constitutional deal while the [...] "hard federalist" [...] fraction led by Chrétien championed the new policy of confronting the Bouchard government and were against any concessions on the constitution. The [...] "hard federalist" [...] Chrétien fraction took to disparagingly referring to the [...] "soft federalist" [...] Martin fraction as [...] "the appeasers".|$|E
