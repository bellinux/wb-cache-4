The first edition is of 1854, and was published at a time of general excitement about 'table-turning' and 'spirit-rapping,' an excitement which only old people remember, and which it is amazing to read about.|$|E

50|$|Demand {{has also}} experimented with film in {{works such as}} Tunnel (1999), a {{tracking}} shot from a driver’s perspective through an empty tunnel lined by concrete pillars; the tunnel is modelled on the Paris underpass where Princess Diana died. Recorder (2002) is a 35 mm-film loop in which a paper model of an eight-track reel-to-reel recording device appears to play the Beach Boys album Smile (1966), a recording that was until recently lost; {{the sound of a}} piano playing a variation on ‘Bicycle Rider’, an instrumental from the Smile sessions, can be heard on the soundtrack. Rolltreppe (Escalator) (2000) is an animation of 24 still images shown in a continual loop. Showing an escalator without people, taken from surveillance footage, Demand here is referencing an escalator near Charing Cross Bridge in London where a gang was caught on surveillance camera shortly after they had robbed two men and thrown them into the Thames, killing one of them. Trick (2004) refers back to the beginnings of cinema and is based on one of the first films of the Lumière brothers, Assiettes <b>tournantes</b> (Turning Plates) of 1896. The one-minute film re-creates a sequence in which a performer executes a stunt by spinning a set of bowls and plates on a tabletop. Camera (2007) presents a surveillance camera as it pans a public space, complete with ambient sound. In Rain (2008), Demand painstakingly re-created the effect of raindrops falling onto a hard surface, using cellophane candy wrappers and a sound track of eggs frying.|$|E

40|$|Iain Sinclair’s London is a labyrinthine city split by {{multiple}} forces deliriously replicated in {{the complexity and}} contradiction of his own hybrid texts. Sinclair played an integral role in the ‘psychogeographical turn’ of the 1990 s, imaginatively mapping the secret histories and occulted alignments of urban space {{in a series of}} works that drift between the subject of topography and the topic of subjectivity. In the wake of Sinclair’s continued association with the spatial and textual practices from which such speculative theses derive, the trajectory of this variant psychogeography appears to swerve away from the revolutionary impulses of its initial formation within the radical milieu of the Lettrist International and Situationist International in 1950 s Paris towards a more literary phenomenon. From this perspective, the return of psychogeography has been equated with a loss of political ambition within fin de millennium literature. However, the tangled contexts from which Sinclair’s variant psychogeography emerges have received only cursory scholarly attention. This study will unravel these contexts in order to clarify the literary and political ramifications of the seemingly incompatible strands that Sinclair interweaves around the term. Are Sinclair’s counter-narratives to the neoliberal consensus of the early twenty-first century comparable to the critique of capitalism and urbanism advanced by the Situationists? Or is his appropriation of psychogeography emblematic of a broader contemporary recuperation of the oppositional tactics and strategies associated with counter-cultural currents from a more politically adversarial era? Is Sinclair’s transition from the margins of experimental poetry to the literary mainstream correlative with urban gentrification? By examining these questions through the orientating device of a series of psychogeographical plaques <b>tournantes</b> with which Sinclair is preoccupied, this study facilitates a more nuanced evaluation of Sinclair’s compulsively associative use of psychogeography to navigate the split city of London...|$|E
40|$|Since 1912, Canadians {{have used}} {{aircraft}} as {{aids in the}} protection of field crops, orchards, and forests from the ravages of fungi, insects, frost, and fire. At first, only fixed-wing aircraft could be used, but from 1947 both fixed-wing and rotary-wing aircraft have been employed. This review also relates the involvement of pioneering people and companies that have developed aerial control methods against biotic and abiotic agents damaging to our plants. [Utilisation d’avions pour la protection des plantes au Canada] Depuis 1912, les Canadiens ont souvent effectué la protection des cultures agricoles, des vergers et des forêts contre les dommages causés par des agents pathogènes, des insectes, le gel et le feu à l’aide d’avions. On utilisa en premier lieu l’avion à ailes fixes seulement, mais à partir de 1947, celui-ci ainsi que l’aéronef à voilures <b>tournantes</b> ont été utilisés. Cette synthèse retrace de plus l’implication de personnes et de compagnies qui furent des pionniers lors du développement de méthodes de contrôle aériens de plusieurs agents biotiques et abiotiques dommageables pour nos plantes. FIXED-WING AIRCRAFT In {{the early days of}} wheat farming in western Canada, it was somewhat of a mystery just how the rust dis-ease of wheat could suddenly appear in many wide-spread locations at the same time. In their study of this mysterious situation, plant pathologists assumed that spores of the rust fungus (Puccinia graminis Pers. :Pers.) were wind-blown, in the spring, from areas in the United States where wheat was already mature and infected with rust. Canadian plant pathologist, Arthur W. Henry (1896 - 1989) proved this, in 1912 - 1913, by being part of an aircraft crew that exposed glass microscope-slides, smeared with Vaseline, while the aircraft was flying at various heights. By thus catching rust spores they proved that the disease-inducing fungus {{came in the form of}} air-borne spores that were scattered over vast areas at the same time (Stakman et al. 1923). That was the earliest use of aircraft as an aid to plant disease control in Nort...|$|E
