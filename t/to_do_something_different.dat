5|$|Despite the {{positive}} response the game {{would go on}} to receive, Year of the Dragon was developer Insomniac Games' last Spyro title. In an interview, CEO Ted Price said that the company stopped producing the games because they could not do anything new with the character, and that after five years of development on a single series, the team wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>different.</b> Future Spyro games were produced by, among other developers, Digital Eclipse, Equinox Digital Entertainment, Eurocom, Krome Studios, Étranges Libellules, and Tantalus Media.|$|E
25|$|According to Ne-Yo, {{the idea}} for the album emerged from three influences: his desire <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>different</b> instead of a {{standard}} compilation; his interest in science fiction, comic books and Japanese animation; and inspiration from the works of Michael Jackson, particularly Thriller, Moonwalker, and Bad. Originally a short movie was to accompany the album, but such proved not to be viable given time and monetary constraints, so Ne-Yo chose to develop a series of six extended music videos instead. Nevertheless, the film concept continues to influence the work, as he has stated the songs on the album are inspired by the script of the film that he wrote. The album features a number of songs which follow the story of Jerome and Pretti Sinclair.|$|E
25|$|Takahashi {{created the}} {{majority}} of the main scenario himself. Takahashi worked on the script alongside Yuichiro Takeda, a writer who had previously worked on Xenoblade Chronicles; and Kazuho Hyodo, who had written episodes for multiple Gundam series. The story of Xenoblade Chronicle X was substantially larger than Xenoblade Chronicles, with Takahashi and Takeda feeling that they could not handle the entire scenario themselves. On advice from Takeda, he brought in Hyodo. Due to Hyodo's extensive involvement in science fiction stories, Takahashi felt confident leaving much of the work to him. The choice of a science fiction setting was influenced by Takahashi's wish <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>different</b> from the fantasy setting of Xenoblade Chronicles. Xenoblade Chronicles X was the first time Hyodo had worked on a video game. One of the main goals for Takahashi was having humans and the robot Skells coexisting and functioning in the world. Due to the scale and experimental nature of the game, the Monolith Soft team made an effort {{to move away from the}} philosophical storylines their company had become known for with previous titles. Speaking about his goals for the game, Takahashi felt that he had finally created what he had wanted to since first founding Monolith Soft in 1999.|$|E

500|$|On Inflikted, Max was the group's {{songwriter}} and lyricist. At {{the time}} of the album recording, he was watching the same four movies almost every day: Apocalypse Now, City of God, A Clockwork Orange, and La Haine. Max revealed to Revolver that he wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>different,</b> and it gave him a lot of ideas.

500|$|Feeling {{the need}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>different,</b> Planché {{turned to a}} {{translation}} of the féerie folie (French: fairy tale) Riquet à la Houppe, which he had written some years earlier. The play was a success, {{and became the first}} of 23 [...] "fairy extravaganzas", most of which were based on the fairy tales of Madame d'Aulnoy. Planché's fascination with her work led the press to refer to him as Madame d'Aulnoy's [...] "preux chevalier" [...] (French: devoted knight) and similar epithets. Planché's coined the term [...] "extravaganza", defining it as [...] "the whimsical treatment of a poetical subject".|$|E

500|$|Entertainment Weeklys Ken Tucker {{enjoyed the}} [...] "nervy attempt <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>different</b> with the TV Western" [...] {{in the pilot}} and said that [...] "Brisco County is less a satire of the Western's cliches than a {{revitalization}} of them." [...] Writing in the Toronto Star, Greg Quill said that the pilot introduced Brisco as [...] "a western in the loosest use of the term". Quill noted that the pilot includes [...] "every cliche in the western movie arsenal", but that [...] "everything, from characters to plot turns, is skewed away from the norm", and that the pilot episode rose above the level of western spoof to become an [...] "outrageously confident tribute to... {{the best of the}} genre".|$|E
500|$|While {{writing the}} song, Leto was {{influenced}} by the culture of Los Angeles and inspired by his relationship with it. He explained that pursuing his creative ambitions in Los Angeles had led to a [...] "love/hate relationship" [...] with the city. Leto told Interview magazine, [...] "the song is about people coming to the City of Angels to live their dreams and to make their dreams their reality. It's about how the other people they've met in the city have helped them—you know, a group of people all kind of joining together into a community of outsiders, of mavericks, of freaks, of artists. It's about coming to a place <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>different</b> and something special." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{director}} {{was inspired by}} his own experiences: [...] "The germ for that comes from my own childhood memories of school-time friends. I have lived in boarding school {{for most of my}} childhood and the friends that I have today are the ones whom I got in touch with during 4th/5th standard. I may not speak to them for years but they are a family whom I can call up at 4 am without hesitation." [...] Manuskhani soon realised that Bollywood had explored friendship, live–in relationships, marriage and divorce many times, and he wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>different</b> for his debut film. He decided to use sexuality to shed light on the issue, untouched by Bollywood, for the Indian audience.|$|E
5000|$|We wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> {{completely}} <b>different</b> {{from the}} first record because we had changed dramatically and had {{learned a lot from}} personal relationships.

500|$|Between series one and two, Wood {{said she}} thought {{it was a mistake to}} do another As Seen On TV series, and had {{attempted}} to write a play instead: [...] "I've been seeking to branch out, but it hasn't happened. I wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>different</b> before I went back on TV." [...] However, she soon decided that the play was [...] "too Alan Ayckbourn", threw it away and began writing the second run instead. [...] She aimed to write 18 minutes of script a week. In the end it took six months to complete, an experience she did not enjoy. [...] "You pour everything you've got into one sketch and you don't ever want to write another - only you realise there are fifty-nine more to go before you've got enough for a series, it's torment".|$|E
500|$|Described by Stephen Becker as [...] "modern {{and almost}} too intellectual", the strip eschewed {{many of the}} pulp fictional detective tropes (e.g. alcoholism, two-fisted assistants, and an {{assortment}} of interchangeable femmes fatale).

500|$|Daft Punk {{have said}} that they donned their robot outfits to easily merge the {{characteristics}} of humans and machines. However, Bangalter later stated that the costumes were initially the result of shyness. [...] "But then it became exciting from the audience's point of view. It's the idea of being an average guy with some kind of superpower." [...] When asked whether the duo expressed themselves differently within the robotic suits, Bangalter stated [...] "No, we don't need to. It's not about having inhibitions. It's more like an advanced version of glam, where it's definitely not you." [...] With the release of Human After All, the musical duo's outfits became slightly less complicated by consisting of black leather jacket and pants and simplified versions of the Discovery headgear. The attire was designed by Hedi Slimane. Bangalter stated that, [...] "We never like {{to do the same thing}} twice. It's more fun and entertaining for us <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>different,</b> whether it's wearing masks or developing a persona that merges fiction and reality.

500|$|Actor George Clooney {{provided}} the small {{role of the}} voice of Sparky, which is limited entirely to dog barks. Clooney was a vocal South Park fan and was largely responsible for generating news about [...] "The Spirit of Christmas", a 1995 animated short film by Parker and Stone {{that served as a}} precursor to South Park. Parker said they decided to cast a famous actor in the small role of Sparky because [...] "we thought it was funny", and because they wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>different</b> from the animated series The Simpsons, which is known for having prominent guest appearances on a regular basis. Parker added, [...] "Since South Park is sort of a show that rips on celebrity, we wanted to degrade them in other ways too. And we thought let's have celebrities on, but have them do really minor, unimportant things". Comedy Central executives were excited at the prospect of having Clooney appear on the show, but Parker said they were disappointed to learn his role was so small.|$|E
500|$|The band's style {{changes from}} album to album. Songs About Jane {{consists}} of songs about Levine's ex-girlfriend Jane Herman. On It Won't Be Soon Before Long, however, {{the songs are}} less personal and are more electric with more use of synthesizers, creating a retro feel. Hands All Over continues the band's lost love theme, along with songs about infatuation and was re-released in 2011, with the hit single [...] "Moves like Jagger", an electropop song which represents a drastic change in the band's sound, with more of a dance feel to it. [...] "It {{was one of those}} songs that was definitely a risk," [...] Levine said. [...] "It's a bold statement. We've never really released a song like that. But it's exciting <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>different,</b> do something new. I'm just glad that everyone likes it." [...] James Valentine called Overexposed [...] "our most 'pop' record ever and we weren’t shy about really going for it."

500|$|However, {{before the}} filming of the video, the band was still {{finishing}} the album and when the time to shoot the video came, Lee didn't conceive an idea about how it should look like.

Her sister said that they should film the video for the song in New York and Lee agreed with her idea, [...] "She just started saying things that were right on. She was like, 'This should be in New York. You guys need <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>different,</b> this song feels different.' And she started talking about running across the Brooklyn Bridge, and it being where I live, and I was like, 'Oh my God, this is great.'" [...] However, the final shot of the video filmed at Coney Island was Lee's own idea. The shot represented the band coming back in the world and [...] "heading into the unknown, coming into a new world".|$|E

500|$|At the 2004 San Diego Comic-Con International, she {{encountered}} now-former Tokyopop editors Mark Paniccia and Lillian M. Diaz-Przybyl, who helped to pitch 12 Days to their publisher. Kim later expressed surprise for her successful pitch of 12 Days, and commented: [...] "It made me {{believe there is}} room for diverse stories." [...] Resuming work on 12 Days in early 2005, Kim felt that her [...] "slow speed, other projects and family matters" [...] delayed [...] its production. Additionally, the South Korean-native Kim, who speaks Korean, English, and Japanese fluently, would think of ideas in Korean that did not translate well over to English, ultimately leading her to change her method of thinking for the comic. She considered her creation of a global manga [...] "a bit ironic," [...] because she [...] "wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>different</b> from manhwa or manga," [...] which she had grown up around. Completed in the middle of August 2006, 12 Days was published by Tokyopop in North America in November of the same year.

500|$|The game's overall {{narrative}} {{was highly}} praised by critics; many considered it compelling, engaging, riveting, and mature, and {{viewed it as}} the standout feature of the game. Some believed that the story had an excellent presentation with decent voice-acting, memorable characters, and atmospheric soundtracks. North's performance was particularly praised. Many critics {{thought it was a}} bold attempt by Yager and that the story about mistakes and consequences allowed the game's narrative to exceed its competitors in terms of quality. Some critics believed that Yager deserves respect for successfully creating a message through the story and delivering it to the player, and trying <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>different.</b> Mitch Dyer of IGN thought that the game's narrative made violence [...] "meaningful", and that the story was unexpectedly good and personal. Some believed the story is impactful and at times shocking, and that the plot would make [...] "Modern Warfare 2s nefarious No Russian look pretty tame". The game's choices were praised for being [...] "powerful" [...] despite not offering a branching storyline. Some critics believed that these choices are provocative, organic, impactful, upsetting, and thematically correct, though unsatisfying and sometimes hollow and binary. The endings of the game were praised. Some critics noted that emotionally Spec Ops: The Line is not a pleasant game.|$|E

In an interview with The Independent, Rowland admitted that with her first two albums she struggled to find her sound. [...] "I was in a stage with the first two records where I was searching and I was like, let me try a rock-dance approach, the label [...] wanted me to try it and I did it...And then after that came a more urban approach with Ms. Kelly in 2007." [...] Her third album Here I Am (2011) consisted of a pop and R sound, with subtle influences of dance. Rowland stated that meeting David Guetta had influenced her to record dance music. During production of the album, Rowland stated {{that part of the}} reason for the new sound on Here I Am was wanting <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> <b>different,</b> saying [...] "I knew I couldn't be afraid of this direction, and I wasn't going to let the thoughts and opinions of others make me afraid to go in this direction".|$|E
