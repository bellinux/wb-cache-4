5|$|The 48th Panzer Corps {{had fewer}} than 100 {{serviceable}} modern tanks to combat Soviet armor. Furthermore, they lacked fuel, and {{the shortage of}} tanks forced commanders to organize tank crews into infantry companies; the 22nd Panzer Division, which formed part of the corps, was almost completely destroyed in the fighting that ensued. The 22nd had entered the fighting with fewer than thirty working tanks, and left with a company of tanks. The Romanian 1st Armored Division, attached to the 48th Panzer Corps, engaged the Soviet 26th Tank Corps after having lost communications with their German corps commanders, and were defeated by 20 November. As the Soviets continued to advance southwards, many Soviet tank crews began to suffer from the worsening blizzard, which affected men and equipment, and blocked gunsights. It was not uncommon for tanks to lose traction on the ground, and for a crew member to have an arm broken as he was <b>thrown</b> <b>around</b> inside the hull. However, the blizzard also neutralized the German corps' coordination.|$|E

In late-February 2005, In Demand ran a preview and stated {{that there would be}} two steel cage matches held at Lockdown. A Six Man Tag Team match that featured Sean Waltman was <b>thrown</b> <b>around</b> prior to the event. TNA created a section for the event on their official website before it started. On the April8, 2005 episode of TNA's television program TNA Impact!, Director of Authority (DOA) Dusty Rhodes announced that all matches at Lockdown would be held inside a six sided steel structure known as the Six Sides of Steel. TNA followed up with a press release through their website that confirmed this. TNA issued a parental advisory {{a few days after the}} announcement due to violence associated with steel cage matches. A thirty-minute pre-show was planned before the spectacle that featured a Three Way Tag Team match between 3Live Kru (Ron Killings and Konnan), David Young and Lex Lovett, and The Naturals (Andy Douglas and Chase Stevens).|$|E

25|$|In 1986, {{the first}} SuperPrix was held. The circuit was drenched by torrential downpours from {{the tail end}} of Hurricane Charley. Being laid out on public roads the circuit was bumpy, and the cars were <b>thrown</b> <b>around</b> badly. Pierluigi Martini and Luis Pérez-Sala {{qualified}} on the front row, followed by Andrew Gilbert Scott. The championship leader Ivan Capelli span early on, in his March 86B Cosworth powered car. Because of long delays, the first race was run at a shorter distance. At every corner there seemed to be someone crashing. The race was red flagged when Andrew Gilbert Scott was experiencing handling problems after an earlier spin. When he exited the Bristol Street Motors Bend on the 21st lap, he lost it and crashed into Alain Ferté's stationary car, blocking part of the track, with Sala still fighting for the win from a fast catching up Martini. Luis Pérez-Sala was given the win, and Pierluigi Martini given second, with Michel Ferté taking third. The top six drivers were awarded half points as the race was red-flagged on the 24th lap, just before the halfway point of the 51 lap race.|$|E

500|$|Thirty-eight {{percent of}} the 1,044 {{were found in the}} ash fall deposits, the {{majority}} inside buildings. These are thought to have been killed mainly by roof collapses, with the smaller number of victims found outside of buildings probably being killed by falling roof slates or by larger rocks thrown out by the volcano. The remaining 62% of remains found at Pompeii were in the pyroclastic surge deposits, and thus were probably killed by them – probably from a combination of suffocation through ash inhalation and blast and debris <b>thrown</b> <b>around.</b> In contrast to the victims found at Herculaneum, examination of cloth, frescoes and skeletons show that it is unlikely that high temperatures were a significant cause. Herculaneum, which was much closer to the crater, was saved from tephra falls by the wind direction, but was buried under [...] of material deposited by pyroclastic surges. It is likely that most, or all, of the known victims in this town were killed by the surges.|$|E

[...] Her conclusion of the video and of Kesha was that as simple as it may be, [...] "she manages to be both sexy and fun while rolling around in the desert." [...] Melinda Newman of HitFix criticized the video's first half, calling it [...] "predictable." [...] The video's second half, however, was met with praise with Newman commenting that the 'special effects at the end almost redeem it." ...|$|E
500|$|The Cybermats, {{which had}} not been seen on screen since 1975's Revenge of the Cybermen, were {{redesigned}} to appear more high-tech. The top was designed to recall {{the head of a}} Cyberman, and piranha-like teeth were added to suggest that they were converted animals, just as Cybermen were converted humans. Three versions of the Cybermat were made. The first was simply a [...] "stunt double" [...] which did not have teeth and was meant for being <b>thrown</b> <b>around</b> or laid still. The second was a cable-controlled [...] "close-up" [...] version that had teeth and thrashed, and was used for when the characters handled it. Smith broke this one when he hit it with a frying pan in the scene where Craig is being attacked, and it was subsequently repaired with tape. The third was radio-controlled to dash along the floor. The post-production special effects team The Mill created a computer-generated Cybermat that leapt up to attack Craig.|$|E

500|$|The {{music video}} premiered on May 19, 1995, through MTV. It {{features}} Madonna, her dancers, and her chihuahua Chiquita in black leather and latex outfits. The S inspired outfits were {{to symbolize the}} [...] "breaking out of the restraints" [...] as the lyrics described. Her hair, which appears brown in the video was actually blonde at the time. She had leather strips painstakingly braided into her hair to blend with her dark roots. The frizzy afro she sports halfway through the video was actually a hairpiece. During {{the middle of the}} video, Madonna and her dancers appear in a series of boxes, trying to break free. Another sequence shows the singer being <b>thrown</b> <b>around</b> within a series of ropes managed by her dancers. As the video concludes there is a shot of Madonna sitting in a chair, looking straight into the camera as she says the line [...] "Absolutely no regrets!".

500|$|Originally, the {{character}} resembled a [...] "burlier leading man", described by Greno as [...] "a muscular commoner/farm boy". However, the directors had always envisioned Flynn as [...] "a dashing thief". To {{assist with the}} development of Flynn's design, Howard and Greno held a large meeting with thirty of Tangleds female employees. Calling it the [...] "Hot Man Meeting", the employees were encouraged to [...] "bring in pictures of their favorite hunky men". The Hot Man Meeting was created because the directors, who found that they were very much impressed with Rapunzel's design, felt that [...] "Flynn [...] to be up to [...] level". Greno described the Hot Man Meeting as [...] "crazy", elaborating, [...] "Photos of all the hottest men in Hollywood [...] being <b>thrown</b> <b>around</b> a room. Photos being torn in half and pasted back together. Eyes were ripped from one picture and put on another. Heads were torn from photos," [...] concluding, [...] "I've never seen anything like it." [...] Howard cited American actor Clark Gable and English footballer David Beckham among several celebrities by whom Flynn was influenced during the meeting, joking that the employees eventually [...] "started using Nathan and me as examples of what not to do".|$|E
500|$|Siwiec {{obtained}} {{passes to}} a national harvest festival taking place on 8 September 1968 at the 10th-Anniversary Stadium in Warsaw. His goal was to have his act be witnessed by nearly 100,000 spectators, including numerous journalists and the national leadership of the Polish United Workers' Party. He set himself ablaze {{during one of the}} festival dances using a flammable solvent. This method of protest was likely inspired by recent series of similar protests by Buddhist monks in Vietnam, most notably that of Thích Quảng Đức. He had a banner with the words [...] "For our freedom and yours" [...] and [...] "Honour, Fatherland" [...] as well as some leaflets, which he is said to have <b>thrown</b> <b>around</b> right before the incident, though neither attracted much attention, and both items are primarily mentioned only in the documents of the investigating secret police. He refused immediate help and shouted [...] "I protest". He retained consciousness after the flames had been extinguished, giving brief statements, as well as later when he was transferred to a hospital (Szpital Praski), where he was able to communicate with the medical personnel, and where he received a brief visit from his wife. In the hospital, he was put under police surveillance, dying four days later on 12 September.|$|E

500|$|According to {{the game}} {{director}} Katsura Hashino, while [...] "ideas [...] <b>thrown</b> <b>around</b> earlier", development on Persona 4 in Japan did not begin until {{after the release of}} Persona 3. The development team consisted of the team from Persona 3 and new hires which included fans of Persona 3. Atlus intended to improve both the gameplay and story elements of Persona 3 for the new game, to ensure it was not seen as a [...] "retread" [...] of its predecessor. Hashino said that [...] "to accomplish that, we tried to give the players of Persona 4 a definite goal and a sense of purpose that would keep motivating them as they played through the game. The murder mystery plot was our way of doing that." [...] The plot of Persona 4 was [...] "greatly inspired", according to Hashino, by mystery novelists such as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Agatha Christie and Seishi Yokomizo. Persona 4 was officially unveiled in the Japanese gaming magazine Famitsu in March 2008. An article in the issue detailed the game's murder mystery premise, rural setting, and new weather forecast system. The game's North American release date was announced at the 2008 Anime Expo in Los Angeles, California. Atlus would not make an add-on disc or epilogue for Persona 4, as had been done with the Persona 3 FES. Persona 4 allowed players full control of characters in battle. This was due to negative comments from players about most of the player team in Persona 3 being controlled by the game's AI. The amount of data the team ended up incorporating around school life, character relationships and spoke character dialogue was so large that there were fears it would not fit onto a single disc. The anime cutscenes were produced by Studio Hibari.|$|E

2500|$|Until around 1973, {{the word}} [...] "Deutsch-Rock" [...] ("German Rock") {{was used to}} refer to the new groups from West Germany. [...] "Krautrock" [...] was {{originally}} a humorous term coined in the early 1970s by British disc jockey John Peel or by the UK music newspaper Melody Maker, in which experimental German bands found an early and enthusiastic following, and ironically retained by its practitioners. The term derives from the ethnic slur [...] "kraut", and its use by the music press was inspired by a track from Amon Düül's Psychedelic Underground titled [...] "Mama Düül und Ihre Sauerkrautband Spielt Auf" [...] ('Mama Düül and her Sauerkrautband Strike Up'). According to author Ulrich Adelt, {{it should be noted that}} [...] "kraut" [...] in German can refer to herbs, weeds, and drugs.

Deadbolt is known for its use of power tools during their live sets, and it is customary for the audience to be showered with sparks of red-hot metal during their live shows. King Kurt, a 1980s band, was known for its infamous [...] "food fight" [...] gigs, in which eggs and bags of flour were <b>thrown</b> <b>around</b> on and off stage and audience members were given free haircuts.
