5|$|Although not well-studied, {{there is}} growing {{acceptance}} of <b>three</b> <b>species</b> of Malagasy hippopotamus. It is not known when or exactly how these hippos arrived {{on the island of}} Madagascar. As hippos are semi-aquatic, it is possible that they survived the 400km (248mi) trek across the channel, although presumably when the water was shallower and there were perhaps small islands along the way. It is possible that the <b>three</b> <b>species</b> of hippopotamus represent three distinct and successful colonizations of the island. Hippos are the only endemic ungulates ever to have lived on Madagascar.|$|E

30|$|Molecular phylogenetic {{analyses}} {{based on}} nuclear ITS and chloroplast trnL-F and trnH-psbA sequences strongly support the placement the <b>three</b> new <b>species</b> in Primulina.

50|$|Cetopsidium was {{described}} in 2005, its name coming from the Cetopsis, the first described cetopsid genus, and idium which means dimunutive, {{in reference to the}} relatively small size of Cetopsidium <b>species.</b> <b>Three</b> existing <b>species</b> were transferred to this genus and <b>three</b> new <b>species</b> were described.

5|$|Taxonomists S. A. Forbes and R. E. Richardson {{classified}} the pallid sturgeon in 1905, grouping it in {{the genus}} Parascaphirhynchus and the family Acipenseridae, which includes all sturgeon worldwide. Its closest relatives are the shovelnose sturgeon (Scaphirhyncus platorhynchus), which is still relatively common, and the critically endangered Alabama sturgeon (Scaphirhynchus suttkusi), which may soon become extinct. These <b>three</b> <b>species</b> belong to the subfamily Scaphirhynchinae, which has only one other genus, Pseudoscaphirhynchus, represented by <b>three</b> <b>species</b> found in west-central Asia.|$|E

5|$|A recent {{molecular}} {{study indicates}} that the song thrush's closest relatives are the similarly plumaged mistle thrush (T. viscivorus) and Chinese thrush (T. mupinensis); these <b>three</b> <b>species</b> are early offshoots from the lineage of Turdus thrushes before they diversified and spread across the globe, and hence are less closely related to other European thrush species such as the blackbird (T. merula).|$|E
5|$|Carl Linnaeus, {{the founder}} of modern {{binomial}} nomenclature, gave lemurs their name as early as 1758, when he used it in the 10th edition of Systema Naturae. He included <b>three</b> <b>species</b> under the genus Lemur: Lemur tardigradus (the red slender loris, now known as Loris tardigradus), Lemur catta (the ring-tailed lemur), and Lemur volans (the Philippine colugo, now known as Cynocephalus volans).|$|E

5|$|Conant (1929) gave a {{detailed}} account of the feeding behavior of a captive specimen from South Carolina. When prey was introduced, the snake quickly became attentive and made an attack. Frogs and small birds were seized and held until movement stopped. Larger prey was approached in a more cautious manner; a rapid strike was executed after which the snake would withdraw. In 2.5 years, the snake had accepted <b>three</b> <b>species</b> of frogs, including a large bullfrog, a spotted salamander, water snakes, garter snakes, sparrows, young rats, and <b>three</b> <b>species</b> of mice. Brimley (1944) described a captive specimen that ate copperheads (A. contortrix), as well as members of its own species, keeping its fangs embedded in its victims until they had been immobilized.|$|E
5|$|Cormorants are {{medium to}} large aquatic birds, usually with mainly dark plumage {{and areas of}} colored skin on the face. The bill is long, thin, and sharply hooked. Their feet are four-toed and webbed. <b>Three</b> <b>species</b> have been {{recorded}} in New Jersey.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{differences}} among the <b>three</b> <b>species,</b> each has been placed within a different genus, each consisting of one species. In the older literature, these three genera were placed within a family of their own, Desmodontidae, but taxonomists have now grouped them as a subfamily, the Desmodontinae, in the leaf-nosed bat family, Phyllostomidae.|$|E
