5|$|There are two {{approaches}} <b>to</b> <b>treating</b> Chagas disease: antiparasitic treatment, {{to kill the}} parasite; and symptomatic treatment, to manage the symptoms and signs of the infection. Management uniquely involves addressing selective incremental failure of the parasympathetic nervous system. Autonomic disease imparted by Chagas may eventually result in megaesophagus, megacolon and accelerated dilated cardiomyopathy. The mechanisms that explain why Chagas targets the parasympathetic autonomic nervous system and spares the sympathetic autonomic nervous system remain poorly understood.|$|E
50|$|Other {{medications}} are occasionally used <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> {{side effects}} or prevent complications. They include antihypertensives <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> high blood pressure; ephedrine or phenylephrine <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> low blood pressure; salbutamol <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> asthma, laryngospasm, or bronchospasm; and epinephrine or diphenhydramine <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> allergic reactions. Glucocorticoids or antibiotics are sometimes given to prevent inflammation and infection, respectively.|$|R

5|$|Epileptic {{seizures}} {{are thought}} to relate to abnormal electrical activity. Seizure activity can manifest as absence (of consciousness), focal effects such as limb movement or impediments of speech, or be generalized in nature. Status epilepticus refers to a seizure or series of seizures that have not terminated within 30 minutes, although this definition has recently been revised. Seizures have {{a large number of}} causes, however many seizures occur without a definitive cause being found. In a person with epilepsy, risk factors for further seizures may include sleeplessness, drug and alcohol intake, and stress. Seizures may be assessed using blood tests, EEG and various medical imaging techniques based on the medical history and exam findings. In addition <b>to</b> <b>treating</b> an underlying cause and reducing exposure to risk factors, anticonvulsant medications can play a role in preventing further seizures.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{well-established}} {{treatment for}} self-injurious behaviour in children or adolescents. Cognitive behavioural therapy {{may also be}} used to assist those with Axis I diagnoses, such as depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) can be successful for those individuals exhibiting a personality disorder, and could potentially be used for those with other mental disorders who exhibit self-harming behaviour. Diagnosis and treatment of the causes of self-harm is thought {{by many to be the}} best approach <b>to</b> <b>treating</b> self-harm. But in some cases, particularly in people with a personality disorder, this is not very effective, so more clinicians are starting to take a DBT approach in order to reduce the behaviour itself. People who rely on habitual self-harm are sometimes hospitalised, based on their stability, their ability and especially their willingness to get help. In adolescents multisystem therapy shows promise. Treatments such as CBT, family intervention, interpersonal therapy, and various psychodynamic therapies were all shown to be possibly effective in treating self-injurious behaviour in children and adolescents.|$|E

25|$|Of note is that Cavalieri only {{compared}} {{areas to}} areas and volumes to volumes – these always having dimensions, while {{the notion of}} considering an area as consisting of units of area (relative to a standard unit), hence being unitless, appears to have originated with Wallis; Wallis studied fractional and negative powers, and the alternative <b>to</b> <b>treating</b> the computed values as unitless numbers was to interpret fractional and negative dimensions.|$|E
50|$|Sulfacetamide is a sulfonamide antibiotic, {{that is used}} as a cream <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> skin {{infections and}} as eye drops <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> eye infections.

It can also be used orally <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> urinary tract infections. It kills the bacteria by restricting the production of folic acid, which is essential for bacterial growth. It mainly inhibits the multiplication of bacteria as it acts in a competitive inhibitor.|$|R

25|$|During lethal rabies {{infection}} of mice, the blood–brain barrier (BBB) {{does not allow}} anti-viral immune cells to enter the brain, the primary site of rabies virus replication. This aspect contributes to the pathogenicity of the virus and artificially increasing BBB permeability promotes viral clearance.

25|$|Prior to the {{invention}} of modern medicines, sexually transmitted diseases were generally incurable, and treatment was limited <b>to</b> <b>treating</b> the symptoms of the disease. The first voluntary hospital for venereal diseases was founded in 1746 at London Lock Hospital. Treatment was not always voluntary: {{in the second half}} of the 19th century, the Contagious Diseases Acts were used to arrest suspected prostitutes. In 1924, a number of states concluded the Brussels Agreement, whereby states agreed to provide free or low-cost medical treatment at ports for merchant seamen with venereal diseases.|$|E

There were about 43 species of medicinal plants found used by the Brunei community <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> 15 type of diseases. The {{findings of this study}} show that one plant was used <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> eye diseases; two plants were used <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> the otorhinolaryngologic disease; three plants were used <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> the stomatognathic disease; four plants were used <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> endocrine system diseases; six plants were used <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> skin diseases and substance-related disorders; eight plants were used <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> bacterial infections, mycoses, and viruses, musculoskeletal diseases, hemic and lymphatic diseases, pregnancy complications and female urogenital disease; nine plants were used <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> occupational diseases; 13 plants were used <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> digestive system diseases, immune system diseases and respiratory tract diseases; and 19 plants were used <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> wounds and injuries. The most common part of plants used in preparing herbal medicine is the leaves. The most common method of preparation is decoction and poultice. The plants came from 29 families. This study is helpful to assist us in recognising other potentials of the plants {{that can be used for}} medicinal purposes.

25|$|In some {{countries}} (such as Finland) convertibles of various structures may {{be treated as}} equity by the local accounting profession. In such circumstances, the accounting treatment may result in less pro-forma debt than if straight debt was used as takeover currency or to fund an acquisition. The perception was that gearing was less with a convertible than if straight debt was used instead. In the UK the predecessor to the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) put a stop <b>to</b> <b>treating</b> convertible preference shares as equity. Instead {{it has to be}} classified both as (1) preference capital and as (2) convertible as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{column was}} {{initially}} accompanied by about 200 Ngwato {{provided by the}} Tswana chief Khama, who had firmly aligned his country with Britain. The Ngwato provided much assistance in building the new road, but animosity soon developed {{between them and the}} whites, principally because the latter were not used <b>to</b> <b>treating</b> blacks as equals. By mutual consent, the Ngwato returned home. As the column continued its march north, Selous split off with a small section and headed east to challenge the Portuguese in Manicaland.

25|$|In the United Kingdom group {{psychotherapy}} initially developed independently, with pioneers S. H. Foulkes and Wilfred Bion using group therapy as an approach <b>to</b> <b>treating</b> combat fatigue in the Second World War. Foulkes and Bion were psychoanalysts and incorporated psychoanalysis into group therapy by recognising that transference can arise not only between group {{members and the}} therapist but also among group members. Furthermore, the psychoanalytic concept of the unconscious was extended with a recognition of a group unconscious, in which the unconscious processes of group members could be acted out {{in the form of}} irrational processes in group sessions. Foulkes developed the model known as group analysis and the Institute of Group Analysis, while Bion was influential in the development of group therapy at the Tavistock Clinic.|$|E
