5|$|Masked shrikes {{are most}} similar in {{appearance}} to woodchat shrikes, but are smaller, more slender and longer-tailed. Adults {{of the two}} species are easily distinguished, since <b>the</b> <b>masked</b> shrike has white on its head and a dark rump, whereas the woodchat shrike has a black crown, rusty nape and white rump. Juveniles are more similar, but <b>the</b> <b>masked</b> shrike has a longer tail, paler face, and grey back and rump, whereas the woodchat shrike has a sandy back and pale grey rump.|$|E

Devastated, James remembers an old radio transmitter in the backyard shed. He leaves and encounters the blonde woman. When James tries to shoot her, <b>the</b> <b>masked</b> man knocks him unconscious. Kristen hears the shot and runs to the shed. She finds the radio, but the pin-up girl smashes it. Kristen rushes back to the house, where she is incapacitated by <b>the</b> <b>masked</b> man. Both James and Kristen are now unconscious.|$|E
5|$|The fourth {{match was}} between The Undertaker and Muhammad Hassan (managed by Daivari). During Hassan's entrance, men in masks {{accompanied}} {{him to the}} ring to represent his Arabic culture. <b>The</b> <b>masked</b> men proceeded to interfered in the match, but Undertaker retaliated and removed all of <b>the</b> <b>masked</b> men from the ring. Midway through the match, Undertaker attempted to use a Tombstone piledriver on Hassan, but Hassan escaped the move and attempted a Clothesline. The Undertaker countered by chokeslamming Hassan and scored the pinfall on Hassan to win the match. Following this, Undertaker executed a Last Ride through the stage floor on Hassan, writing him out of storylines.|$|E

25|$|When {{entering}} the water while wearing <b>the</b> <b>mask,</b> <b>the</b> diver {{may need to}} manually prevent water impact from dislodging or knocking off <b>the</b> <b>mask.</b> Alternatively, a diver can enter the water with <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> off {{and then put it}} on or use an entry method which does not result in fast water flow over <b>the</b> <b>mask.</b> Wearing <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> pushed up onto the forehead while out of the water or on the surface increases the risk of <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> falling or being knocked off.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>masked</b> shrike feeds {{mainly on}} large insects, {{although}} other arthropods and small vertebrates are also caught. Shrikes fatten up before migration, {{but to a}} lesser extent than other passerines because they can feed on the way, sometimes taking other tired migrants. Despite its relatively small size, <b>the</b> <b>masked</b> shrike has been recorded as killing species such as lesser whitethroat and little swift. Vertebrates are killed by bill blows {{to the back of the}} head, and the tomial teeth are then used to separate the neck bones.|$|E

Chaco berates them for killing one of their own, but Harold chastises him for allowing the Creutzfeldt–Jakob epidemic to occur and has Chaco executed by <b>the</b> <b>masked</b> figure. Scully herself is about to be killed when Mulder arrives and shoots the figure; he is revealed to be Sheriff Arens. Harold tries to shoot Mulder, but is trampled to death by the fleeing townsfolk.|$|E

5|$|Texas Tech's other mascot, Raider Red, is a {{more recent}} creation. Beginning with the 1971 {{football}} season, the Southwest Conference forbade the inclusion of live animal mascots to away games unless the host school consented. For situations where the host school {{did not want to}} allow <b>the</b> <b>Masked</b> Rider's horse, an alternate mascot was needed. Jim Gaspard, a member of the Saddle Tramps student spirit organization, created the original design for the Raider Red costume, basing it on a character created by cartoonist Dirk West, a Texas Tech alumnus and former Lubbock mayor. Though <b>the</b> <b>Masked</b> Rider's identity is public knowledge, it has always been tradition that Raider Red's student alter ego is kept secret until the end of his or her tenure.

5000|$|Dr. Neuman - Stanley's cynical {{psychiatrist}} and a recurring character. Stanley typically goes {{to see him}} to talk about his problems and <b>The</b> <b>Mask.</b> Dr. Neumann doesn't believe in <b>The</b> <b>Mask,</b> which he thinks is Stanley's [...] "imaginary friend". This is a running gag of the show. However, he later gains <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> from Stanley, who {{wanted to get rid of}} it. Neumann tries <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> on and with it on, becomes crazy and psychotic. He also wears a yellow coat and blue pants with sneakers as well as a huge bow tie with the same color scheme as <b>the</b> <b>Mask's</b> tie. While wearing <b>The</b> <b>Mask,</b> Neumann puts Stanley and other people in straitjackets (using their underwear), believing they suffer from an illness called Ipkissia maskosis. He also teams with Pretorius, but is ultimately defeated and separated from <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> after trying to kill Stanley. Even after this, and the fact that <b>the</b> <b>Mask</b> has appeared in the news and even on television, Neumann is still not convinced. Neumann wore <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> in Shrink Rap.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>masked</b> shrike's {{preferred}} {{habitat is}} open woodland with bushes and some large trees. It is less conspicuous than its relatives, avoiding very open country and often perching in less exposed locations. The nest is a neat cup {{built in a}} tree by both adults, and the clutch is normally 4–6 eggs, which are incubated by the female for 14–16 days until hatching. The chicks are fed by both parents until they fledge 18–20days later, and remain dependent on the adults for about 3–4 weeks after leaving the nest. <b>The</b> <b>masked</b> shrike eats mainly large insects, occasionally small vertebrates; it sometimes impales its prey on thorns or barbed wire. Populations are decreasing {{in parts of the}} European range, but not rapidly enough to raise serious conservation concerns, and the species is therefore classified by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of least concern.|$|E

5|$|As {{noted by}} several critics and commentators, the film's story and style mirror {{elements}} from Gaston Leroux's The Phantom of the Opera.

V and Evey's relationship also parallels many of the romantic elements of The Phantom of the Opera, where <b>the</b> <b>masked</b> Phantom takes Christine Daaé to his subterranean lair to re-educate her.|$|E

5000|$|Stanley Ipkiss/The Mask (voiced by Rob Paulsen) - The primary {{protagonist of}} the series. Instead {{of getting rid}} of <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> as in <b>the</b> movie, he kept it, and {{whenever}} he tries getting rid of [...] "The Mask", he gets into trouble and is often forced to use <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> to overcome these problems, eventually coming to actively rely on <b>the</b> <b>Mask</b> to fight supernatural enemies (even facing Satan at one point). Stanley Ipkiss is portrayed as a push over good guy, once described as [...] "repressed, with an overactive superego", but inside of him he has a [...] "wild man under the surface, just waiting to get out". Meanwhile, <b>The</b> <b>Mask,</b> unlike his violent comic book counterpart, is more of a mischievous superhero, who, as Stanley had put it, [...] "Would rather go to water polo night at the Coco Bongo than fight crime". <b>The</b> <b>Mask</b> is also apparently even aware of the surroundings when he isn't being worn as during one episode Stanley attempts to control <b>the</b> <b>Mask</b> with <b>the</b> Sister <b>Mask</b> which seems to work at first only for <b>the</b> <b>mask</b> to go back to normal and state <b>the</b> sister <b>mask</b> doesn't work at all (though this may actually be due to <b>The</b> <b>Mask</b> and Stanley sharing knowledge). <b>The</b> <b>Mask</b> also works when broken (when <b>the</b> <b>Mask</b> was split in two each half still works but only does half the transformation, finally allowing Stanley and <b>the</b> <b>Mask</b> to converse). To date the only thing that truly affects <b>The</b> <b>Mask</b> is <b>the</b> Common Cold which throws his powers out of whack and will result in the death of both <b>The</b> <b>Mask</b> and <b>the</b> wearer. Also, <b>The</b> <b>Mask's</b> powers are quite dependent on the restraint of its wearer's personality; in one episode, Stanley tries to act like <b>The</b> <b>Mask</b> would in order to improve his life at Dr. Neuman's counseling; while Stanley becomes more assertive and confident, <b>The</b> <b>Mask</b> stops functioning properly, due to it bringing out the repressed sides of his personality. Due to the different personalities <b>The</b> <b>Mask</b> and Stanley have, they often refer to each other as separate people (such as <b>The</b> <b>Mask</b> remarking [...] "Oh Stanley is going to hate me in the morning"). In [...] "Split Personalities", it is revealed that <b>the</b> <b>Mask</b> always wanted to give Stanley a wedgie (he even manages to give him a [...] "half-wedgie"). In the same episodes (as pointed out by Stanley), possibly the only thing <b>The</b> <b>Mask</b> and Stanley have in common is their lack of success with women (though Mask has more luck and self-confidence in this area, failing only due to the interference of other characters). <b>The</b> <b>Mask</b> is shown to be very impulsive, fun-loving and cynical and several times has been shown to have a humongous appetite, once eating twenty pizzas in one bite, loves dancing and impressing ladies at the Coco Bongo, his favorite nightspot, and giving atomic wedgies to his enemies and people who annoy him or Stanley. The one redeeming feature of <b>The</b> <b>Mask</b> is his desire not to hurt anyone as shown in [...] "Sister Mask" [...] where he was most displease that his array of gag guns were now firing real bullets as oppose to [...] "Bang flags". <b>The</b> <b>Mask</b> does have a big-heart and cares for others and comes to rescues them when in need, especially his friends like Milo and Peggy.|$|R

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>masked</b> shrike breeds in the Balkans, {{northeast}} Greece {{and some}} of the Greek islands, Turkey, Cyprus and from Syria south to Israel. It also nests in eastern Iraq and western Iran. The range in the east is uncertain, and may include Afghanistan and northern Saudi Arabia. It is migratory, wintering south of the Sahara, mainly in Chad, Sudan and Ethiopia. Smaller numbers are found west to eastern Mali and Nigeria, and in northern Kenya and southern Saudi Arabia. Most birds leave the breeding areas in late August and September, and return north in February and March.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>masked</b> shrike {{gives the}} harsh calls typical of this family, with {{repeated}} tsr, tzr or shek notes and some whistles, and when alarmed produces a rattling krrrr.
