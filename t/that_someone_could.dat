Instead, Part 4 removed a limitation on detention powers imposed by the requirements of Article 5(1)(f) of the European Convention on Human Rights (which provided, among other things, <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>could</b> only be detained for a short period prior to deportation). This was achieved by the British government derogating from the ECHR on the basis that the threat to the UK amounted to a 'public emergency threatening the life of the nation' within the meaning of Article 15.|$|E
25|$|Several peer based organisations {{exist for}} sex workers. The aim of these organisations {{is to support}} the health, rights and well being of sex workers and {{advocate}} on their behalf for law reform {{in order to make}} working safer. Sex work is work and {{there are many people who}} willingly choose it as a job/career. While sex trafficking does exist, not everyone who does sex work is doing so under duress. Social stigma is a major hurdle sex workers encounter, with many people trying to 'save' them. Peer support workers and peer educators are seen as best practice by the Sex Industry Network (SIN) when engaging with community members because peers can understand <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>could</b> willingly choose to do sex work.|$|E
25|$|The Case of Two Nails (雙釘記): Bao Zheng {{investigated}} a man's suspicious death whose cause {{had been}} ruled as natural. After an autopsy, his coroner confirmed the earlier report {{that there was}} no injury to the whole body. At home, the coroner discussed the case with his wife, who mentioned <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>could</b> force long steel nails into the brain without injuring the body. The next day, the coroner indeed found a long nail, and the dead man's widow was arrested; she confessed to adultery and mariticide. Afterwards, Bao Zheng began to question the coroner's wife and learned that the coroner is her second husband, as her first husband had died. Bao ordered his guards to go to the cemetery and unearth her first husband's coffin. Sure enough, there was also a nail driven into the skull.|$|E

25|$|Negative {{criticism}} of Mann's works {{is not hard}} to find. One of her detractors, Pat Robertson of the Christian Broadcasting Network, has said that “selling photographs of children in their nakedness for profit is an exploitation of the parental role and I think it’s wrong.” He views such work as a violation of the responsibility of parents to do everything in their power to protect, shelter, and nurture their children. More negative criticism came from Raymond Sokolov’s article Critique: Censoring Virginia in the Wall Street Journal. He questioned whether children should be photographed nude and whether federal funds should be appropriated for such artworks. Accompanying his article was a modified image by Mann of her daughter Virginia (Virginia at 4), in which her eyes, nipples, and pubic region were now covered with black bars. Mann said he used the image without permission “to illustrate that {{this is the kind of}} thing that shouldn’t be shown.” She was devastated and insulted <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>could</b> mutilate her photograph that way. Virginia was also upset about the article. She wrote a letter to the author saying “Dear Sir, I don’t like the way you crossed me out.” Mann said that after Virginia saw the article, she started touching herself on the areas that were blacked out, saying, “what’s wrong with me?” It was somewhat difficult for Mann to understand the harsh {{criticism of}} these photographs, for she did not stage these moments — instead when she saw a photo opportunity unfolding, she simply asked her children stop moving until she could capture it. When Mann was young, she was often nude, so she raised her children similarly.|$|E
500|$|Give Me My Remote's Kath Skerry {{speculated that}} after several episodes of a [...] "semi-normal" [...] Michael, the writers [...] "were aching {{to bring back}} cringe worthy Michael."

It just seems implausible <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>could</b> be so very clueless that they would act like that in public." [...] Skerry however did find high points, such as the opening sequence and any scene with Dwight and Angela. Television Without Pity graded the episode with an [...] "A".|$|E
500|$|After {{the release}} of the video, critics commented on the {{resemblance}} between Rihanna's ex-boyfriend Chris Brown and her fictional love interest in the video, Dudley O'Shaughnessy, and how the video's content appeared to be somewhat of a reenactment of the assault upon Rihanna by Brown on the evening of the 2009 Grammy Awards. Chris Doplan of Consequence of Sound said that O'Shaughnessy strongly resembled Brown in his appearance. Amanda Dobbins of New York magazine concurred with Doplan, and wrote that O'Shaughnessy has short blond hair like Brown once had. Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine also thought that O'Shaughnessy's character is a depiction of Brown, especially in relation to the scene which features the couple in a car, with O'Shaughnessy driving recklessly and Rihanna begging him to stop. William Goodman of Spin provided an analysis of the video with regard to the Brown comparisons. Like many reviewers, he noted the resemblance between Brown and O'Shaughnessy, writing [...] "The clip stars a dead ringer for Brown, complete with dyed hair and bulging biceps". Goodman commented upon the video's opening narration, which was actually voiced by Agyness Deyn, [...] "The video opens with a Rihanna voice-over that warns, 'You almost feel ashamed <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>could</b> be that important. No one will ever understand how much it hurts... you almost wish that you could have all that bad stuff back, so that you have the good." [...] In conclusion, Goodman commented that [...] the scene showing an altercation in a car is reminiscent of Brown's assault on Rihanna, which occurred inside a car. Goodman wrote: [...] "during a heated argument between the couple in a muscle car, the Brown look-alike gives the Barbadian beauty a slap on the face. Convinced yet?" ...|$|E

500|$|In {{their book}} Who is the Doctor, Graeme Burk and Robert Smith {{described}} Adam in [...] "Dalek" [...] as [...] "somewhat annoying". Burk {{referred to him}} in [...] "The Long Game" [...] as [...] "arrogant and narcissistic", which made Rose appear shallow for insisting he travel with them, but felt that Langley did [...] "a superb job" [...] conveying the character's flaws. He stated that it was [...] "a shame" [...] that the backstory of Adam's motivations were cut from the script, {{as it would have}} made his character more believable. The two found a logical flaw in the Doctor's decision to drop Adam off, as it was a possibility <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>could</b> get their hands on the future technology. Radio Times reviewer Patrick Mulkern gave a positive overview of Adam, describing the character as [...] "bumptious yet likeable" [...] and his departure as [...] "literary precision". He commented that Adam [...] "adds an interesting dynamic, subtly different" [...] from Mickey Smith and Captain Jack Harkness, who also worked with Rose and the Ninth Doctor. Instead of threatening the Doctor and Rose's relationship, Adam [...] "serves to strengthen it". In 2010 Mark Harrison of Den of Geek listed the character's exit from the TARDIS as the tenth greatest companion farewell scene stating that it was [...] "great {{to get a glimpse of}} the Doctor outright booting someone out." [...] He felt that the character [...] "struck out in spectacular fashion" [...] by attempting to steal future technology and that his eventual fate was an example of poetic justice. Charlie Jane Anders also praised the concept of Adam's story arc positioning his departure as the seventh most depressing exit from a companion in Doctor Whos history. She felt that to have [...] "a companion who flunks out" [...] was one of Davies' [...] "cleverest ideas" [...] as executive producer of the series and that Adam's human flaws made him relatable. In 2010 readers of the Radio Times voted Adam the 45th most popular companion, out of forty-eight viable options.|$|E

2500|$|Of {{filming the}} moment in which Rebecca pushes Paul, Hall said [...] "The way Stefan Dennis (who plays Paul) and I {{interpreted}} it and acted it was we had to satisfy ourselves {{that it was one}} of those random and instantaneous mistakes people make.

[...] Hall knew that viewers would be surprised at Rebecca being the culprit and she herself was surprised by the fan's reactions. Some women questioned how Rebecca could do such a thing to Paul, even though he cheated on her and lied to her. Hall thought <b>that</b> <b>someone</b> <b>could</b> get [...] "so fed up" [...] that they made a rash decision that is not something they thought they could ever do. In September 2010, Rebecca's confession and explanation for the night she pushed Paul was broadcast. The episode initially saw Declan Napier (Erin Mullally) admit to Kate Ramsay (Ashleigh Brewer) that he was responsible to protect his mother. Hall added that [...] "the ramifications of Rebecca pushing Paul over the mezzanine are far-reaching".|$|E
