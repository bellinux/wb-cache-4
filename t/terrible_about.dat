The same thing happens to Jenna and in retaliation, she starts singing [...] "Wind Beneath My Wings", prompting Kenneth to start singing [...] "99 Bottles of Beer", to which everyone in the elevator joins in. As revenge for upstaging them, Tracy and Jenna start doing his page duties which confuses Kenneth. After Tracy explains what Kenneth was doing, Kenneth feels <b>terrible</b> <b>about</b> it and swears never to upstage them again.|$|E
500|$|President Clinton {{stated that}} after seeing images of babies being {{pulled from the}} wreckage, he was [...] "beyond angry" [...] and wanted to [...] "put [...] fist through the television". Clinton and his wife Hillary {{requested}} that aides talk to child care specialists about how {{to communicate with the}} children regarding the bombing. President Clinton spoke to the nation three days after the bombing, saying: [...] "I don't want our children to believe something <b>terrible</b> <b>about</b> life and the future and grownups in general because of this awful thing... most adults are good people who want to protect our children in their childhood {{and we are going to}} get through this". On April 22, 1995, the Clintons spoke in the White House with over 40federal agency employees and their children, and in a live nationwide television and radio broadcast, addressed their concerns.|$|E
500|$|The {{author was}} further {{prompted}} {{to write about}} grace when a friend told him about encountering a homeless prostitute in Chicago who began to cry as {{she told him that}} she had raised money for drugs by prostituting her two-year-old child. When Yancey's friend asked the woman if she had sought help at a local church, she answered, [...] "Church? Why would I ever go there? I was already feeling <b>terrible</b> <b>about</b> myself. They'd just make me feel worse." [...] This story convinced Yancey that Christians are doing a poor job of communicating the message that God is willing to accept people, regardless of what they have done; the story haunted him, he said, because the woman was [...] "the type of person who would have gone to Jesus. The more unrighteous a person was, the more comfortable they felt around Jesus".|$|E

Diana suspects that Paul is not being genuine, but Paul insists that he is and describes Rebecca as [...] "collateral damage." [...] Paul believes that sleeping with Diana is the only option he has got to keep her on side. Dennis added that Paul feels guilty when he takes off his wedding ring and <b>terrible</b> <b>about</b> betraying Rebecca. Badler said that the situation is an [...] "ego thing" [...] for Diana and afterwards she makes it clear that her plans to destroy Paul have not changed. Badler said she enjoyed working with Stefan Dennis and said he is [...] "fantastic" [...] and that she felt comfortable with him. She said [...] "I kind of felt like it was a well-played tennis match – every time you zing him something, he zings it right back. He's right there for you, so I absolutely loved working with him.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2007, Boxer was in {{the news}} for {{comments}} she made when responding to Bush's plans to send an additional 20,000 troops to Iraq. [...] "Who pays the price?" [...] Boxer asked Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. [...] "I'm {{not going to pay}} a personal price. My kids are too old and my grandchild is too young. You're not going to pay a personal price with an immediate family. So who pays the price? The American military and their families... not me, not you." [...] When Rice interjected, Boxer responded by saying, [...] "Madam Secretary, please. I know you feel <b>terrible</b> <b>about</b> it. That's not the point. I was making the case as to who pays the price for your decisions. And the fact that this administration would move forward with this escalation with no clue as to the further price that we're going to pay militarily... I find really appalling." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{a private}} dinner in November 2014, Emil Michael, senior vice {{president}} of Uber, suggested that Uber hire a team of opposition researchers and journalists, with a million-dollar budget, to dig into the personal lives and backgrounds of media figures who reported negatively about Uber. Specifically, he targeted Sarah Lacy, editor of the technology website PandoDaily, who has accused Uber of sexism and misogyny. The controversy made national news and stirred criticism against Uber. [...] "The comments, reportedly made by {{senior vice president}} for business Emil Michael at a New York dinner attended by BuzzFeed editor-in-chief Ben Smith," [...] wrote a Washington Post columnist, [...] "ignited a powder keg of criticism about a company already perceived as cut-throat – landing Uber on the front pages of The Washington Post, USA Today and The New York Times." [...] Michael issued a public apology. Later, he sent an email to Lacy: [...] "I was at an event and was venting, but what I said was never intended to describe actions that would ever be undertaken by me or my company toward you or anyone else. I was definitively wrong and I feel <b>terrible</b> <b>about</b> any distress I have caused you." ...|$|E

War had a profound selective value, perfectly in accord with the teachings of Darwin and Mendel and others.

60|$|He {{was very}} tall and noble-looking, dressed in rich {{garments}} of velvet adorned by {{a gold chain}} that hung about his neck, and as I judged about forty years of age. But it was his face which chiefly caught my eye, for at that moment there was something <b>terrible</b> <b>about</b> it. It was long, thin, and deeply carved; the eyes were large, and gleamed like gold in sunlight; the mouth was small and well shaped, but it wore a devilish and cruel sneer; the forehead lofty, indicating a man of mind, and marked with a slight scar. For the rest the cavalier was dark and southern-looking, his curling hair, like my own, was black, and he wore a peaked chestnut-coloured beard.|$|E

60|$|It is a {{long time}} since we met; and I fear these letters may never reach you. But in these violent times I {{remember}} with a curious vividness how you brandished a paintbrush about your easel when I was a boy; and how it thrilled me to think that you had so brandished a bayonet against the Teutons--I hope with the same precision and happy results. Round about that period, the very pigments seemed {{to have some sort of}} picturesque connection with your national story. There seemed to be something gorgeous and <b>terrible</b> <b>about</b> Venetian Red; and something quite catastrophic about Burnt Sienna. But somehow or other, when I saw in the street yesterday the colours on your flag, it reminded me of the colours on your palette.|$|E
60|$|That night I {{passed in}} Leo's room, but he slept through {{it like the}} dead, never once stirring. I also slept fairly well, as, indeed, I needed to do, but my sleep was full of dreams of all the horrors and wonders I had undergone. Chiefly, however, I was haunted by that frightful piece of diablerie by which Ayesha left her finger-marks upon her rival's hair. There was {{something}} so <b>terrible</b> <b>about</b> her swift, snake-like movement, and the instantaneous blanching of that threefold line, that, if the results to Ustane had been much more tremendous, I doubt {{if they would have}} impressed me so deeply. To this day I often dream of that awful scene, and see the weeping woman, bereaved, and marked like Cain, cast a last look at her lover, and creep from the presence of her dread Queen.|$|E

[...] and all this terrifies me the more, and makes me sure something has happened. And I am so weak; since yesterday I cannot stand on my feet anymore. And within this hour the servants, looking toward the sun where it was sinking out of sight and the night chill coming on, said things I could not understand, but they carried something cold to my heart.|$|E
