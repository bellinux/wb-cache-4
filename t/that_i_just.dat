500|$|Series creator Dave Hughes {{first started}} working for Adult Swim in 2003 after an eight-year stint with MTV Animation, {{where he had}} edited series such as Beavis and Butt-head and Celebrity Deathmatch. Hughes, who saw Adult Swim [...] "slipping away from its more {{experimental}} roots" [...] as it got popular, had the concept for Off the Air in mind before, but never {{thought he would be}} the one to make it. While living in New York, 120 Minutes, Concrete TV, Liquid Television and Night Flight were among some of the experimental programming that exposed him [...] "to a whole new world of ideas, music and people <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> didn't see anywhere else on television." ...|$|E

I've got a lot of things and stuff built in me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> want to let go of." [...] He further noted that, for the most part, the album's subject matter is [...] "very personal". Dupri {{expected}} people to question some of the personal lyrics they associated in the song.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Jackson {{started working}} on her ninth studio album, 20 Y.O., with her then partner, record {{producer}} Jermaine Dupri, who was commissioned as the executive producer.

[...] "I started asking questions like, 'What was the feeling of life when you were 20?' I was so intrigued with {{what was going on}} in her life then <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> thought her album should be called that", Dupri commented. Jackson wanted to maintain a R sound from her most recent albums, but with an emphasis on dance music. In June 2006, rapper Khia was confirmed on a song titled [...] "So Excited".

[...] Samir Nasri, who left Arsenal to join Manchester City in 2011, in the lead-up to the match described the abuse he received from Arsenal supporters since his transfer as [...] "stupid." [...] He went on to explain: [...] "They see it as treason or that I betrayed them but it’s not like <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> look what’s best for me ...

500|$|During {{and after}} the final debate, McCain {{compared}} Obama's proposed policies to socialism and often invoked [...] "Joe the Plumber" [...] {{as a symbol of}} American small business dreams that would be thwarted by an Obama presidency. McCain barred using the Jeremiah Wright controversy in ads against Obama, but the campaign did frequently criticize Obama regarding his purported relationship with Bill Ayers. [...] McCain's rallies became increasingly vitriolic, with attendees denigrating Obama and displaying a growing anti-Muslim and anti-African-American sentiment. After one female McCain supporter said she did not trust Obama because [...] "he's an Arab", McCain pointedly replied to the woman, [...] "No ma'am. He's a decent family man, citizen, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues." [...] McCain's response was considered one of the finer moments of the campaign and was still being viewed several years later as a marker for civility in American politics.

500|$|One of Usher's {{first steps}} in {{recording}} Confessions was deciding to reveal [...] "his own little secrets".

Prather said, [...] "The music {{has never been the}} question, but people tend to buy into the artist. The more they know about you, the more they feel like they're there with you." [...] Primarily because of the album's personal content, Usher said that this is his chance to be real. He named the album Confessions because he felt it is his most personal record to date: [...] "All of us have our Pandora's boxes or skeletons in our closets. I let a few of them out, you know. I've got a lot to say. I've got a lot of things and stuff built in me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> want to let go of." [...] He wrote more songs than he contributed to his previous album.|$|E

500|$|A {{follow-up}} to Smith's 2000 album was originally planned {{to happen with}} Rob Schnapf, but their sessions were abandoned. Smith also began distancing himself from manager Margaret Mittleman, who had handled him since the Roman Candle days. He finally began recording a new album with only himself and Jon Brion as producers sometime during 2001. The pair had recorded {{a substantial amount of}} music for the album when Brion confronted Smith about his drug and alcohol abuse. Their friendship promptly ended, and Smith scrapped all of their work until that point. He later said [...] "There was even a little more than half of a record done before this new one <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> scrapped because of a blown friendship with someone that made me so depressed I didn't want to hear any of those songs. He was just helping me record the songs and stuff, and then the friendship kind of fell apart all of a sudden one day. It just made it kind of awkward being alone in the car listening to the songs." ...|$|E
500|$|Vincent Kartheiser, then 23, {{was looking}} for {{something}} more stable than the usual feature movies. He decided to audition after his agent sent him the role and tapes of all previous seasons. The producers wanted the character to be a surprise to audiences, so not even Kartheiser was informed that he was trying out for Angel's son. Instead he auditioned for a character created for the purpose of audition, ‘the Street Kid’, a normal teenager who had Angel as his guardian. [...] "Right away everyone kind of had a good feeling about me joining the cast," [...] Vincent says. [...] "It seemed <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> fit right in." [...] Kartheiser was excited after learning that his real role was 'Angel's son, a demon killer from Quor'toth.’ He was confused about his portrayal, thinking that the character was to have a [...] "living-in-the-brush kind of ‘failed being’ attitude." [...] Instead, he was told to just [...] "stand up straight, [...] normal voice," [...] and let a regular boy come on. Vincent Kartheiser was initially contracted for three episodes with an option to pick him up further.|$|E
500|$|In 2006, Bono stated [...] "When things aren't {{going right}} and I'm feeling like we're not communicating, I go through terrible things on stage." [...] He likened his {{emotions}} on those occasions to [...] "a big blackness", {{and found that}} performing the song helped him to purge them from his mind on some occasions. Several scenes in the 1988 film Rattle and Hum depict Bono with his arm in a sling, {{a result of his}} falling and dislocating his shoulder during a performance of [...] "Exit" [...] on 20 September 1987 in Washington. The concert was being filmed for the movie, and the Edge stated that [...] "the show was not going well". Bono fell while running across the stage [...] "in an attempt to try [...] get something going". Recalling the incident, Bono said [...] " [...] had taken me to some ugly place... but it was rage that caused it. That was when I realized rage is an expensive thing for your general well-being." [...] On another occasion he said [...] "I just want to take a bath after we do <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> want to wash it off my skin." [...] Graham wrote that [...] "performances of 'Exit' would grow ever more fraught and purgative." ...|$|E

500|$|A {{reporter}} for the Daily Planet newspaper and the love interest of Clark Kent. Adams was selected {{from a list of}} actresses that included Olivia Wilde and Mila Kunis. [...] "There was a big, giant search for Lois," [...] Snyder said. [...] "For us, it was a big thing and obviously a really important role. We did a lot of auditioning, but we had this meeting with Amy Adams and after <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> felt she was perfect for it." [...] Adams auditioned for the role three times: once for the unproduced Superman: Flyby, and the second time for Superman Returns before landing the current role. Adams was confirmed to play Lois Lane in March 2011. While announcing the role, Snyder said in a statement, [...] "We are excited to announce the casting of Amy Adams, one of the most versatile and respected actresses in films today. Amy has the talent to capture all of the qualities we love about Lois: smart, tough, funny, warm, ambitious and, of course, beautiful." [...] On portraying Lois Lane, Adams stated that the film would feature a Lois Lane who is an [...] "independent, feisty woman ... but set in a more identifiable world." [...] Adams said that [...] "She has become more of a free-ranging journalist, someone who likes to be hands-on. The nature of the newspaper business has changed so much. There is so much more pressure." ...|$|E
500|$|The Atlantic writer Scott Meslow praised Scott's performance, {{as well as}} how {{the writers}} have [...] "smartly underplayed" [...] the {{relationship}} between Leslie and Ben. Meslow also liked that the April-Andy subplot was now resolved, as he called it the [...] "weakest plotline of the season", but he felt the scenes between Chris and Ann in [...] "Media Blitz" [...] were a rehash of the previous episode. Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic praised Scott's performance, calling him a master at the straight man role, but said he was funnier the previous week in [...] "Ron & Tammy: Part Two": [...] "The laughs weren't as loud on [...] "Media Blitz," [...] as {{it was more of a}} squirm-inducing half hour of television." [...] Matt Fowler of IGN called it a fine episode that was [...] "dominated, in a good way, by its softer, sweeter moments", particularly the kiss between Andy and April, which he said [...] "was so damn sweet <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> couldn't resist it". Although he enjoyed the Perd Hapley interview, Fowler said he did not find Scott's performance otherwise especially funny. Entertainment Weekly writer Hillary Busis also praised Scott's performance, adding, [...] "Did anyone else's heart melt just a little bit at the proud smile that crept across Leslie’s face when Ben found his voice?" [...] Busis also said she was glad the April and Andy reconciled, as April's constant mistreatment of Andy was making it harder and harder to like her character. Busis criticized the Ann and Chris subplot, of which she said, [...] "Wake me up when something actually happens." ...|$|E
500|$|Bono {{wrote the}} lyric of the 1988 song [...] "All I Want Is You" [...] as a {{meditation}} {{on the idea of}} commitment. He later said, [...] "'s clearly about a younger version of myself and my relationship with Ali," [...] and added that by nature he was a wanderer, not a family man, and that [...] "The only reason I'm here is because I met someone so extraordinary <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>just</b> couldn't let that go." [...] U2 lyrics usually have several possible levels of interpretation, and it is not always possible to definitively ascribe Hewson's influence upon them, but music writer Niall Stokes believes that inspiration from Hewson is pronounced throughout the group's 1997 album Pop, particularly on [...] "Staring at the Sun", which he believes reflects her Chernobyl Children's Project involvement and the feelings of both danger and hopefulness that it triggered in Bono. Stokes also believes that the 2000 song [...] "When I Look at the World" [...] is an explicit acknowledgement of Hewson's strength and commitment as exemplified by that Chernobyl work, while others think it is about Jesus or God. Bono has seemed to deflect those interpretations, saying that song is in part a hard-edged look at himself from the eyes of one losing faith. In any case, Bono has said that he does not feel constrained in his writing or interviews by what Hewson might think, as [...] " [...] doesn't read newspapers. Or listen to the radio. There's a mysterious distance between us." [...] Not known for being musical herself, Hewson did perform Lady Gaga's [...] "Telephone", as a duet with her husband, to serenade their daughter Eve at her 21st birthday celebration at a club in Las Vegas in 2012.|$|E
