In 1812, Napoleon {{introduced}} a system known as mesures usuelles, which used the names of pre-metric units of measure, but defined <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of metric units – for example, the livre metrique (metric pound) was 500g and the toise metrique (metric fathom) was 2metres. After the Congress of Vienna in 1815, France lost the territories that she had annexed; some, such as the Papal States reverted to their pre-revolutionary units of measure, others such as Baden adopted {{a modified version of the}} mesures usuelles, but France kept her system of measurement intact.|$|E
5|$|Nectar-eating bats have {{acquired}} specialized adaptations. These bats possess long muzzles and long, extensible tongues covered in fine bristles that aid them in feeding on particular flowers and plants. The tube-lipped nectar bat (Anoura fistulata) has the longest tongue of any mammal relative to its body size. This is beneficial to <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of pollination and feeding. Their long, narrow tongues can reach {{deep into the}} long cup shape of some flowers. When the tongue retracts, it coils up inside the rib cage. However, because of these features, nectar-feeding bats cannot easily turn to other food sources in times of scarcity, making them more prone to extinction than {{any other type of}} bat. Nectar feeding also aids a variety of plants, since these bats serve as pollinators (as pollen can get attached to their fur while they are feeding). Around 500 species of flowering plant rely on bat pollination and thus tend to open their flowers at night. Rainforests are said to benefit the most from bat pollination, because of the large variety of plants that depend on it.|$|E

25|$|Although {{clomipramine}} {{is similarly}} or {{more effective in}} the treatment of OCD compared to SSRIs, it is greatly inferior to <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of tolerability and safety due to its lack of selectivity for the SERT and promiscuous pharmacological activity. In addition, clomipramine has high toxicity in overdose and can potentially result in death, whereas death rarely, if ever, occurs with overdose of SSRIs. It is for these reasons that clomipramine, in spite of potentially superior effectiveness to SSRIs, is now rarely used as a first-line agent {{in the treatment of}} OCD, with SSRIs being used as first-line therapies instead and clomipramine generally being reserved for more severe cases.|$|E
25|$|In any {{analysis}} of spacetime, evidence of gravitation requires that one observe the relative accelerations of two bodies or two separated particles. In Fig.5‑1, two separated particles, free-falling in the gravitational {{field of the}} Earth, exhibit tidal accelerations due to local inhomogeneities in the gravitational field such that each particle follows a different path through spacetime. The tidal accelerations that these particles exhibit with {{respect to each other}} do not require forces for their explanation. Rather, Einstein described <b>them</b> <b>in</b> <b>terms</b> of the geometry of spacetime, i.e. the curvature of spacetime. These tidal accelerations are strictly local. It is the cumulative total effect of many local manifestations of curvature that result in the appearance of a gravitational force acting at a long range from Earth.|$|E

25|$|Although a {{strengthened}} public-health {{system has}} accelerated the national tuberculosis control effort, progress in tuberculosis control has also strengthened the public-health system. In terms of policy, the national tuberculosis control program has clear targets and well-defined technical policies {{based on the}} DOTS strategy. National and international partners work in a cohesive manner toward the same targets, with the same implementation framework. Other public-health programs are learning from this successful model. In financial terms, funding from different partners is harmonized under one financing plan with clear funding needs and gaps—another model for other programs. Furthermore, the failure to control tuberculosis in the past—when tuberculosis services were not free—and the success in tuberculosis control {{over the past few}} years—when tuberculosis services have been free—have provided policymakers with arguments to increase funding for public health from the government. With regard to management, several features of DOTS—e.g., directly observed therapy to manage treatment of patients and the management of logistics and drugs—are now used to tackle HIV/AIDS and in other public-health programs. Furthermore, although many public-health workers are being trained to implement DOTS, setbacks caused by inadequate numbers of trained workers have shown governmental leaders the importance of such resources in public health, and thus they have increased planning for <b>them.</b> <b>In</b> <b>terms</b> of information systems, the tuberculosis program's quarterly recording and reporting system has long been a model for other disease control programs. With the new internet-based reporting system for communicable diseases, the tuberculosis program leads the way in the use of information to improve public-health outcomes. Finally, the model of collaboration between hospitals and CDC facilities provided by the tuberculosis control program {{is one of the best}} examples to date of how hospitals should be involved in the prevention and control of infectious diseases, and has influenced the development of new policies that involve hospitals in the work of public health.|$|E
