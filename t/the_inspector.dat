Complicating matters further is the UN inspector, who moves at random between regions on each turn. <b>The</b> <b>inspector</b> blocks all diamond extraction from the region in which he is present, and can confiscate diamonds from agents within that region.

5|$|Both <b>the</b> <b>Inspector</b> and Governor were {{responsible}} for inspecting commandery-level Administrators and their staffs, {{as well as the}} semi-autonomous kingdoms and their staffs. They evaluated officials on criteria of competence, honesty, obedience to the imperial court, adherence to the law, their treatment of convicts, and any signs of extortion, nepotism, or factionalism. These reports were submitted to the Palace Assistant Imperial Clerk and Imperial Counselor during Western Han, but by Eastern Han these reports were submitted to each of the Three Excellencies. The reports were then used to promote, demote, dismiss, or prosecute local officials.|$|E
5|$|By 1914 the Territorial Force {{had some}} 30,000 men {{involved}} in divisional level training camps; two years previously, the manpower and logistical {{constraints of the}} force was such that only battalion level camps could be achieved. When General Ian Hamilton, <b>the</b> <b>Inspector</b> General of Overseas Forces, visited New Zealand in 1914, he {{was impressed with the}} level of preparedness of the country's military. This reflected positively on Godley's work, and he was appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George the same year.|$|E
5|$|Following the Polish campaign, Hitler {{approved}} {{the expansion of}} the SS combat troops to three divisions as well as bringing the LSSAH up to the strength of a reinforced motorised regiment. To achieve this goal before the commencement of the planned invasion of France and the Low Countries, Berger needed at least partially-trained personnel. To do this, he circumvented the recruiting primacy of the Wehrmacht by transferring men from forces already under Himmler's control, the SS-Totenkopfverbände (SS-TV) that ran the concentration camps, and combat-trained police reinforcements of the Ordnungspolizei (Order Police or Orpo). By adding these men to the LSSAH and the existing three regiments of the SS-VT, he expanded the force to the approved ceiling, including 50,000 trained replacements. The three new divisions were: the SS-Verfügungs-Division (later given the name Reich and then Das Reich) commanded by <b>the</b> <b>Inspector</b> of the SS-VT, SS-Gruppenführer Paul Hausser; the SS-Division-Totenkopf commanded by <b>the</b> <b>Inspector</b> of Concentration Camps, SS-Gruppenführer Theodor Eicke; and the Polizei-Division, commanded by SS-Gruppenführer und Generalleutnant der Polizei Karl Pfeffer-Wildenbruch. This rapid transformation was theoretical to a significant extent, as Eicke and the SS-TV continued to resist exchanges of personnel with the SS-VT.|$|E

40|$|To avert {{environmental}} degradation, {{the governments}} of most nations have put in place environmental regulations to ensure sustainable development. But environmental laws can {{not solve the problem}} alone; communication is an important tool in ensuring environmental regulation and avoiding conflict during the process of environmental inspection. The aim of this paper was to study the role of communication in environmental inspection. Interviews were used as the principle method for data collection. Results obtained revealed that lack of communication led to conflict between <b>the</b> environmental <b>inspectors</b> and <b>the</b> economic operators. Strategies were used by both <b>the</b> <b>inspectors</b> and their clients to avoid conflict or to avoid misunderstanding escalating in to conflict. It was also revealed that the clients saw <b>the</b> <b>inspectors</b> as having power of sanctioning them, and that trust existed between <b>the</b> <b>inspectors</b> and their clients. One other finding was that environmental inspections made use of participatory approach. This ensured that the opinions of both <b>the</b> <b>inspectors</b> and their clients were taken in to account during inspection thus making it possible for the exploration of both parties' perspective...|$|R
