5|$|In October 2001 Adams left Brighton {{to become}} {{assistant}} manager <b>to</b> <b>Dave</b> Bassett at Leicester City. Peter Taylor, the former Leicester manager, was drafted in to complete Brighton's promotion campaign. Adams chose the move {{in an attempt}} to get closer to his dream of managing a Premiership club. He understood that Bassett was to move 'upstairs' {{at the end of the}} season, leaving Adams free to take the management job for 2002–03.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>Dave</b> Tough and Jo Jones, Manne {{admired and}} learned from contemporaries like Max Roach and Kenny Clarke, and later from younger drummers like Elvin Jones and Tony Williams. Consciously or unconsciously, he borrowed a little {{from all of}} them, always searching to extend his playing into new territory.|$|E
5|$|The 7 {{trillion}} year {{figure was}} first changed to 7 billion {{years and then}} to 3 million and the characters of Arnold Rimmer and the Cat were created. The name Dave Hollins was changed <b>to</b> <b>Dave</b> Lister when a football player called Dave Hollins became well-known, and Hab was replaced by Holly. One of the voice actors from Son of Cliché, Chris Barrie went on to portray Arnold Rimmer in the Red Dwarf TV series.|$|E
60|$|The hot {{blood had}} rushed <b>to</b> <b>Dave's</b> face, {{and he was}} still trembling.|$|R
60|$|Oliver Wadsworth listened <b>to</b> <b>Dave’s</b> {{words with}} deep interest. Then he shrugged his shoulders.|$|R

5|$|Before the event, the GFW {{broadcasts}} experienced setbacks. Many {{cable companies}} {{decided not to}} air the event live, opting instead for a replay of UFC 182, and the stream would not run on {{three of the four}} most used devices compatible with Flipps: Chromecast, Xbox 360 and Xbox One. According <b>to</b> <b>Dave</b> Meltzer, NJPW undercut GFW by including the event in the $8.42 monthly price for New Japan Pro Wrestling World; the GFW broadcast of Wrestle Kingdom 9 alone was $34.95. The New Japan Pro Wrestling World stream had Japanese commentary only.|$|E
5|$|In 2005 {{members of}} the All Blacks {{witnessed}} the unveiling of a plaque at Gallaher's birthplace in Ramelton, which was presented {{in conjunction with the}} renaming of Letterkenny RFC's home ground <b>to</b> <b>Dave</b> Gallaher Memorial Park. Gallaher's name is also incorporated into the club's crest. The ground was upgraded following its renaming, and in 2012 the Letterkenny section of the ground was opened by former All Black, and Ponsonby stalwart, Bryan Williams. An Ireland-produced documentary about Gallaher's life, The Donegal All Black, was aired in 2015. Later that year, a jersey worn by Gallaher during the 1905 British Isles tour was sold at auction in Cardiff for £180,000—nearly 10 times the previous record auction price for a rugby jersey.|$|E
5|$|Sales fell to {{just under}} 14,000 by issue 12, and {{continued}} to fall during the series' second year until the 24th issue sold just over 9,000 copies. In December 2015, the 35th issue sold an estimated 6,500 copies. According <b>to</b> <b>Dave</b> Carter, a writer for Comics Beat, this is a typical sales pattern for a modern comic. The series concluded with issue 47 in February 2017, which had estimated sales of about 6,300. Because {{of the decline in}} Revivals sales, Seeley expressed skepticism about doing another project of similar length in the future.|$|E
60|$|As was usual with him, Job Haskers was {{exceedingly}} dictatorial, {{and said}} some cutting things {{that brought the}} blood <b>to</b> <b>Dave's</b> face.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's the talk!" [...] put in Roger. He turned <b>to</b> <b>Dave's</b> uncle. [...] "Can't you bind them or something, so {{that they}} can't get away?" ...|$|R
60|$|An angry remark arose <b>to</b> <b>Dave's</b> lips. But {{he checked}} it {{and turned toward}} the school building, and Roger and Phil followed. Job Haskers marched after them.|$|R
5|$|Dave Piaseki (Steven Demarco) and Linda Chapman (Zakiya Cook) {{are found}} shot dead {{in their car}} at Fairmount Park. When Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) and detectives Bud Morris (John Carroll Lynch) and Samantha Baker (Sonja Sohn) arrive, they think the case is a Murder–suicide, but Megan finds two bullets in Dave and concludes that someone murdered them. Megan meets Linda's parents, Al (Barry Shabaka Henley) and Laura (Brenda Pressley), and tells them the news, leaving them devastated. Megan links Linda's ex-boyfriend Brian Hall (Brian White) <b>to</b> <b>Dave</b> and finds out that Dave was at Brian's {{restaurant}} the night he died. However, Brian has an alibi as he was with employee Nina Wheeler (Sherri Saum). The police find out that Linda {{used to work at}} Brian's restaurant and received psychological abuse until Dave found out and confronted him. Brian has started to abuse Nina, so the police get Nina away from Brian, as he caused Linda to suffer from bulimia due to the abuse.|$|E
5|$|Shankly {{tried to}} keep busy in {{retirement}} and {{stay in touch with}} football. He worked for Radio City 96.7, a Liverpool station on which he presented his own chat show, once interviewing prime minister Harold Wilson, and was a pundit on its football coverage. He briefly took up advisory roles at Wrexham and then at Tranmere Rovers, helping former Liverpool captain Ron Yeats at the latter. In November 1976, the press speculated that Shankly would make a return to management as the successor <b>to</b> <b>Dave</b> Mackay at Derby County, but the position went to Colin Murphy instead. John Toshack recalled that Shankly was a great help to him when he went into management with Swansea City in 1978. Despite being in his sixties, Shankly kept himself fit and often took part in five-a-side football. If nothing else was available he would join teams of youngsters in kickabouts.|$|E
5|$|The Browns {{had three}} quarterbacks on their roster {{entering}} the 1970 season in Gault, Bill Nelsen, and Mike Phipps. As training camp began, Browns coach Blanton Collier {{planned to use}} Gault in exhibition games, as he was throwing the ball well in practice during the summer. By the end of preseason, Gault {{was named to the}} active roster as the Browns retained all three quarterbacks, an uncommon move at the time. During the Browns' second game against the San Francisco 49ers, starting quarterback Nelsen was injured, leading Gault to enter the game in the fourth quarter. He completed a pass to Gary Collins for 23 yards, threw an incompletion, and threw an interception <b>to</b> <b>Dave</b> Wilcox, allowing the 49ers to go on a game-winning drive in a 34-31 Browns loss.|$|E
5000|$|In October 2016, Drake premiered a remix <b>to</b> <b>Dave's</b> song [...] "Wanna Know" [...] on OVO Sound Radio, {{which also}} {{featured}} Drake {{and was released}} as a single.|$|R
50|$|As of mid-2008, the UK Pitbulls {{are no more}} due <b>to</b> <b>Dave's</b> career-ending injuries. Mike {{is still}} wrestling {{occasionally}} for some UK companies. Both are now happily enjoying retirement.|$|R
60|$|The {{discharge}} {{of the weapon}} echoed and reechoed throughout the cave and brought down several small stones. Then, <b>to</b> <b>Dave's</b> intense surprise and joy, an answering shot came back.|$|R
5|$|Whilst Wigan Warriors and Wigan Athletic {{flourished in}} the new stadium (Wigan Athletic in {{particular}} would achieve significant success, rising up the English football pyramid to the Premier League by 2005), Orrell R.U.F.C. did not. Dave Whelan and Maurice Lindsay decided to invest heavily in the club, {{with the aim of}} having the club play in rugby union's Guinness Premiership at the stadium. After failing to win 2004's National Division Two, Whelan pulled a large amount of investment from the club, to a more modest GB£30,000 a year. This was the beginning of Orrell's demise, as players left during the summer of that year and the club were consequently relegated the season after. Ownership eventually passed from Lindsay back to the club's members, but by this point, Orrell had sold their former Edge Hall Road ground <b>to</b> <b>Dave</b> Whelan's company, Whelco Holdings, and therefore had no assets apart from their rebuilt clubhouse following a fire in 2002. Orrell never settled at the JJB Stadium, and were eventually de-professionalised {{at the end of the}} 2006–07 season.|$|E
25|$|Millwall made {{a trip to}} {{the seaside}} on 24 February, and they {{returned}} to London with all three points thanks <b>to</b> <b>Dave</b> Brammer's strike just shy of the thirty-minute mark.|$|E
25|$|In the UK, {{the show}} began airing on BBC Four in 2013. The first three seasons aired on this channel before moving <b>to</b> <b>Dave</b> {{in the summer}} of 2015, {{starting}} with Season 4.|$|E
60|$|Then <b>to</b> <b>Dave's</b> ears {{came the}} thunder of the herd's hoofs, and {{he saw that the}} cattle were on a mad run. He drew rein and stood up in his stirrups.|$|R
50|$|Agents {{from the}} IRS {{threaten}} <b>to</b> send <b>Dave</b> <b>to</b> {{six months in}} jail unless he helps them bust the local moonshine ring.|$|R

25|$|On 15 January 2014 {{president}} Paul Riedlinger {{announced that}} the company was for sale. In mid-2014 the company was sold <b>to</b> <b>Dave</b> Hertner, owner of Effectus AeroProducts, and moved to Dorchester, Ontario.|$|E
25|$|With {{the game}} tied 14–14 {{early in the}} fourth quarter, an injured Beban gamely threw a {{touchdown}} pass <b>to</b> <b>Dave</b> Nuttall. The extra point attempt by Andrusyshyn was tipped by Hayhoe and went wide, resulting in a 20–14 UCLA lead.|$|E
5000|$|The second episode {{also makes}} {{references}} <b>to</b> <b>Dave's</b> trip <b>to</b> a glacier in Norway, parodying Cameron's similar visit; {{it makes the}} point that for an apparently pointless trip, the harm on the environment from Dave's flight would be high. Dave is shown [...] "turning into his greenest green" [...] and the Conservative election slogan, [...] "Vote blue, go green" [...] is highlighted <b>to</b> indicate <b>Dave's</b> colour changing tendencies.|$|R
60|$|Much <b>to</b> <b>Dave's</b> disgust Lieutenant Naster {{was placed}} {{in charge of the}} batteau, which {{contained}} besides Dave several soldiers who were hardly known to our young soldier. When Naster saw Dave, he scowled but said nothing.|$|R
