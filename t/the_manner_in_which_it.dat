5|$|Former McKinsey senior executives, Rajat Gupta and Anil Kumar, {{were among}} those convicted in a {{government}} investigation into insider trading for sharing inside information with Galleon Group hedge fund owner Raj Rajaratnam. Though McKinsey was not accused of any wrongdoing, the convictions were embarrassing for the firm, since it prides itself for integrity and client confidentiality. Following the initial allegations McKinsey no longer maintains a relationship with either senior partner, though <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> severed ties attracted controversy.|$|E

5|$|The {{function}} of adverbs is {{to modify the}} action or event described by the verb by providing additional information about <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> occurs. Many adverbs are derived from adjectives with the suffix -ly, but not all, and many speakers tend to omit the suffix in {{the most commonly used}} adverbs. For example, in the phrase the woman walked quickly the adverb quickly derived from the adjective quick describes the woman's way of walking. Some commonly used adjectives have irregular adverbial forms, such as good which has the adverbial form well.|$|E
5|$|Another legacy was <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> {{led to the}} emergence—albeit only fleetingly—of an {{independence}} in Australian foreign affairs. Although previously Australian foreign interests had been largely handled by Britain, as a combatant Australia sent its own delegation to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919, while it also began {{to take a more}} assertive role in regional affairs in the Pacific. At the peace conference Prime Minister Hughes pushed aggressively for reparations and an Australian mandate over German New Guinea; a stance which conflicted with the liberal internationalist inspired Fourteen Points put forward by American President Woodrow Wilson. Regardless, following the war there was little real change in Imperial relations and Dominion affairs, and as a result the war arguably did not lead to any significant change in Australia's perception of its role in the world. Indeed, profound change would only occur following the Japanese crisis of 1942, which ultimately saw Australia pursue a foreign policy more independent of Britain, and an alliance with the United States.|$|E
5|$|Some {{academics}} {{suggest that}} the insurgency in Kashmir is at least partly a result of <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> was integrated into India. Kashmir, uniquely amongst princely states, was not required to sign either a Merger Agreement or a revised Instrument of Accession giving India control over {{a larger number of}} issues than the three originally provided for. Instead, the power to make laws relating to Kashmir was granted to the Government of India by Article 5 of the Constitution of Jammu and Kashmir and was, under Article 370 of the Constitution of India, somewhat more restricted than in relation to other states. Widmalm argues that during the 1980s, a number of Kashmiri youth began to feel that the Indian government was increasingly interfering in the politics of Jammu and Kashmir. The elections of 1987 caused them to lose faith in the political process and begin the violent insurgency which is still ongoing. Similarly, Ganguly suggests that the policies of the Indian government towards Kashmir meant that the state, unlike other parts of India, never developed the solid political institutions associated with a modern multi-ethnic democracy. As a result, the growing dissatisfaction with the status quo felt by an increasingly politically aware youth was expressed through non-political channels which Pakistan, seeking to weaken India's hold over Kashmir, transformed into an active insurgency.|$|E

25|$|Art remains {{relevant}} {{to issues of}} identity and representation. San art, which has been created with intense political intent, has awakened the San politically. Western collectors of art often interpret and classify San Art as ‘primitive art’ which creates a challenge in changing the stereotypes linked to San Art.

25|$|Some {{criticisms of}} the {{amendment}} related merely to <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> was proposed. Some argued that the amendment had been rushed through without proper debate and consultation. Because the constitutional right to citizenship had been introduced {{as part of the}} Good Friday Agreement it was argued that there should have been consultation with Northern Ireland political parties. In the lead-up to the referendum the Irish and British governments issued a joint statement saying that they did not regard the proposed constitutional change as affecting the British-Irish Agreement (this being the inter-governmental component of the Good Friday Agreement). The Democratic Unionist Party cited the amendment as evidence that the Agreement could be changed.|$|E
25|$|Sourav Ganguly (51) {{given out}} by Mark Benson – While the TV {{evidence}} was inconclusive {{as to the}} correctness of the decision, <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> was delivered has generated controversy. Sourav Ganguly edged the ball to Michael Clarke at slip who was engulfed by his team-mates in celebration of an apparent catch. Umpire Benson appeared unsure {{as to whether it}} carried and instead of referring to third umpire asked captain Ricky Ponting for clarification. There was a prior agreement between the teams that the fielders would be honest about whether the catch had carried. Ponting, having already consulted Clarke about the validity of the catch, raised his finger, telling the umpire that he thought the catch was cleanly taken.|$|E
25|$|The book {{is perhaps}} most {{important}} in <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> provides the viewpoint of one of Wellington's foot soldiers {{at a time when}} so many were illiterate. Whilst some officers kept diaries or wrote memoirs of their service, The Recollections of Rifleman Harris is rare because unlike the grand actions or great people recalled by his superiors, Harris mentions dozens of men whose history is no longer remembered and whose names would otherwise be lost, and records the details of daily ennui with interesting and colloquial prose. He describes medicine from a patient's point of view, punishment from a friend of the victim's view, and military life from the bottom up, giving insight to the daily life of a soldier in the Napoleonic Wars, as well as a valuable primary source to some of the British campaigns of the period.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after this}} happened, WWF President Gorilla Monsoon {{conducted}} {{an interview with}} McMahon in the ring. Monsoon validated Austin's victory, saying that the longstanding policy of the WWF was that {{the decision of the}} officials was final. However, Monsoon declared that while Austin was the official winner of the Royal Rumble, his victory did not entitle him to a championship match due to <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> had been achieved. Monsoon then said he had signed a four-way, no disqualification elimination matchup for the WrestleMania title shot, which became known as the Final Four and was to serve as the main event for In Your House 13. The participants in the match were to include Austin, the official winner of the Royal Rumble, and the three men he eliminated after he illegally re-entered the match: Vader, The Undertaker, and Hart if he reconsidered his actions from before. As Austin argued with Monsoon over his decision, Hart returned to the arena, attacked Austin, and accepted the offer.|$|E
25|$|Next in {{importance}} is the speech Against Agoratus (388 BC), {{one of our}} chief authorities for the internal history of Athens during the months which immediately followed; the defeat at Aegospotami. The Olympiacus (388 BC) is a brilliant fragment, expressing {{the spirit of the}} festival at Olympia, and exhorting Greeks to unite against their common foes. The Plea for the Constitution (403 BC) is interesting for <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> argues that the well-being of Athens—now stripped of empire—is bound up with the maintenance of democratic principles. The speech For Mantitheus (392 BC) is a graceful and animated portrait, of a young Athenian hippeus, making a spirited defence of his honor against the charge of disloyalty. The defence For the Invalid is a humorous character-sketch. The speech Against Pancleon illustrates the intimate relations between Athens and Plataea, while it gives us some picturesque glimpses of Athenian town life. The defence of the person who had, been charged with destroying a mona, or sacred olive, places us amidst the country life of Attica. And the speech Against Theomnestus deserves attention for its curious evidence {{of the way in which}} the ordinary vocabulary of Athens had changed between 600 and 400 BC.|$|E
25|$|A junior {{representative}} for South Australian National Football League (SANFL) club Central District {{as well as}} playing cricket, Lehmann left school {{at the age of}} 16 to work on the assembly line of Holden car manufacturers in Elizabeth, South Australia. He declined selection to the first intake of the newly formed Australian Cricket Academy, a full-time cricket centre, citing his enjoyment of the factory life. Lehmann entered the first-class scene as a 17-year-old in the 1987/88 season for South Australia, playing one match against Victoria at the Melbourne Cricket Ground after both Tim May and Peter Sleep were called into the national team. After making 10, Lehmann was omitted upon their return and did not play any further part in the season. In 1988/89, South Australia were {{at the bottom of the}} ladder, when coach Barry Richards called Lehmann into the team, playing against Western Australia at the WACA. Lehmann remembered little of the match; after being struck in the right temple by a Bruce Reid bouncer, he was knocked unconscious and temporarily ceased breathing. Lehmann made his mark in the following match against New South Wales Blues at Adelaide Oval, reaching 50, but the innings was marred by <b>the</b> <b>manner</b> <b>in</b> <b>which</b> <b>it</b> was ended. Going for a quick single, Lehmann collided with bowler Geoff Lawson and was run out after falling over. However, Richards and South Australian captain David Hookes claimed that Lawson had tripped Lehmann, leading to a confrontation between the two teams.|$|E
