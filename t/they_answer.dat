There are also spotlights situated {{at the bottom of}} the set area that zoom down on the contestant when <b>they</b> <b>answer</b> a major question; to increase the visibility of the light beams emitted by such spotlights, oil is vaporized, creating a haze effect. Media scholar Dr. Robert Thompson, a professor at Syracuse University, stated that the show's {{lighting system}} made the contestant feel as though they were outside of prison when an escape was in progress.|$|E

25|$|On the ACT, each {{question}} correctly answered is worth one raw point. There is no penalty for marking incorrect answers on the multiple-choice {{part of the}} test. Therefore, a student can answer all questions without suffering a decrease in their score for questions <b>they</b> <b>answer</b> incorrectly. This is parallel to several AP Tests eliminating the penalties for incorrect answers. To improve the result, students can retake the test: 55% of students who retake the ACT improve their scores, 22% score the same, and 23% see their scores decrease.|$|E

25|$|Ahmadiyya Muslims {{see this}} episode as {{reminiscent}} of the prophecy of the Biblical Prophet Jonah {{to the city of}} Nineveh. <b>They</b> <b>answer</b> the critics by claiming that the original prophecy which was published in the book Jang e Muqaddas was conditional upon Atham not inclining towards 'truth' as was stated: provided he does not incline towards truth. They argue that Atham was in constant fear and backed out of his Anti-Islamic stance for the 15 months of the prophecy. Ahmadiyya Muslims say that after much jubilation was shown by the opponents of Ahmad upon Atham being alive once the time limit of the original prophecy expired, Ghulam Ahmad invited him to swear on oath that he did not entertain the least thought of the truth of Islam and the falsehood of Christianity, later offering him a promise of 4,000 rupees if he did. Atham never took an oath, which Ahmadiyya Muslims see as Atham admitting that he retracted his beliefs against Islam.|$|E
25|$|One early {{application}} of knapsack algorithms {{was in the}} construction and scoring of tests in which the test-takers have a choice as to which questions <b>they</b> <b>answer.</b> For small examples it is a fairly simple process to provide the test-takers with such a choice. For example, if an exam contains 12 questions each worth 10 points, the test-taker need only answer 10 questions to achieve a maximum possible score of 100 points. However, on tests with a heterogeneous distribution of point valuesi.e. different questions are worth different point values {{it is more difficult}} to provide choices. Feuerman and Weiss proposed a system in which students are given a heterogeneous test with a total of 125 possible points. The students are asked to answer all of the questions {{to the best of their}} abilities. Of the possible subsets of problems whose total point values add up to 100, a knapsack algorithm would determine which subset gives each student the highest possible score.|$|E

500|$|The American {{version of}} the show follows the same general format as the {{original}} UK version, but with teams of three contestants instead of four. The game is a quiz competition in which contestants attempt to win money by challenging a quiz show genius known as the chaser. Each contestant participates in an individual [...] "chase" [...] in which they attempt to earn {{as much money as}} possible to contribute to a prize fund for the team. The contestant must answer enough questions to stay ahead of the chaser on the gameboard; otherwise they lose their winnings for that round. The contestants who successfully complete their individual chases without being caught advance to the Final Chase, in which <b>they</b> <b>answer</b> questions as a team playing for an equal share of the prize fund accumulated throughout the episode.|$|E

Berrien had refused to associate with Mr. Eaton. Eaton wrote to all three men demanding that <b>they</b> <b>answer</b> for the article. Ingham sent back a contemptuous letter stating that, while he was not the source for the article, the information was still true. On June 18, Eaton challenged Ingham to a duel through his second, a Dr. Randolph, who visited him twice and the second time threatened him with personal harm if he did not comply with Eaton's demands. Randolph was dismissed, and the next morning Ingham sent a note to Eaton declining the invitation. Eaton wrote a letter back to Ingham accusing him of cowardice. Ingham was then informed that Eaton, Randolph, and others were looking to assault him. He gathered together his own bodyguard, and was not immediately molested. However, he reported that for the next two nights Eaton and his men continued to lurk about his dwelling and threaten him. He then left the city, and returned safely to his home. Ingham communicated to Jackson his version of what took place, and Jackson then asked Eaton to answer for the charge. Eaton admitted that he [...] "passed by" [...] the place where Ingham had been staying, [...] "but at no point attempted to enter...or besiege it." ...|$|E

2500|$|The grading {{scale is}} {{different}} {{for the team}} round. [...] Questions are given one by one, whereas in the individual round students are given the test in its entirety. [...] There are usually 12 questions(not including tie-breakers), and each team has 4 minutes to answer the question. [...] If <b>they</b> <b>answer</b> the question correctly before the first minute, they receive 16 points, if <b>they</b> <b>answer</b> before the second they receive [...] 12 points, before 3 minutes, 8 points, 4 points before 4 minutes has expired and 0 points for anything, even the correct answer, after 4 minutes. In some competitions, a sliding scale is used. For example, if no team turned in an answer to a particular question in the first minute but another team answered correctly in the second minute, the team will be awarded the full 16 points even though they answered it in the second minute; a third minute-answering team would get twelve minutes; and the fourth minute-answering team would get eight points. The answer is usually written in and the students are not penalized for guessing. The team score from the team round is then summed up with the score of the individuals of the team to acquire the total team score used in rankings.
