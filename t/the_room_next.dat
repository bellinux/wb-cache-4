5|$|During the {{construction}} of residential housing and other buildings on the site in 1988–89, several underground sections of the bunker complex were uncovered by work crews. In April 1988, the East German government allowed several visits to the site by photo-journalists. Water was pumped out of the Vorbunker for four days before access could be made via the underground passageway which led from the Chancellery. The interior floor of the Vorbunker {{was covered with a}} muddy sludge from having been underwater for so many years. Old empty wine bottles were found {{on the floor of the}} kitchen and wine store room. Still present in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>next</b> to the kitchen were the broken frames of the bunk beds used by the Goebbels children. At the end of the hallway were the stairs leading down to the Führerbunker. However, the men could go no further than the mid-landing, as the Führerbunker was still underwater and the ceiling beyond the doorway had collapsed due to the demolitions performed in 1947. After these inspections, work crews for the most part removed and destroyed the bunker complex. The Vorbunkers top and external walls were the first structures to be torn down. The construction of buildings in the area around the complex was a strategy for ensuring the surroundings remained anonymous and unremarkable. The emergency exit point for the Führerbunker (which had been in the Chancellery gardens) was occupied by a car park.|$|E
5|$|On 16 January 1945, {{following}} the Wehrmacht's {{defeat in the}} Battle of the Bulge, Misch {{and the rest of}} Hitler's personal staff moved into the Führerbunker and Vorbunker under the Reich Chancellery garden in Berlin. His FBK commanding officer, Franz Schädle, appointed Misch to be the bunker telephone operator. Misch handled all of the direct communication from the bunker. He did not leave it for any significant period of time until the war ended in May 1945. On 22 April 1945, Schädle called him on the phone and told him there was a place reserved for his wife and young daughter on one of the last planes out of Berlin. Misch was temporarily released from duty and drove to pick up his family to take them to the aircraft. However, his wife refused to take their daughter and leave him and her parents in Berlin. Upon returning to the Reich Chancellery, Misch learned that Hitler was releasing most of the remaining staff to leave Berlin. By that date, as the Red Army was entering Berlin, propaganda minister Joseph Goebbels and his wife Magda brought their six young children to stay in the Vorbunker. Joseph Goebbels moved into <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>next</b> to Misch's telephone exchange in the lower level of the Führerbunker. The Goebbels children would play in the corridor around Misch's post.|$|E

It was reported that police took <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>next</b> to Chen and Norman. In the evening of Sunday 17 April, appearing like tourists, Nguyen, Chen and Norman checked into the Melasti Hotel. Sukumaran, who was also with them, with his bags, left them with the others as {{he decided to go}} to the Hard Rock Hotel complex.|$|E
25|$|As Romans was evacuated, one of {{the other}} SWAT {{officers}} then spotted Mixon beside the bedroom door, equipped with the SKS rifle, and fired at him. Mixon was forced to retreat inside the room and close the door. The team moved towards the bedroom and partially forced the door open. As he managed to get inside, Sakai was shot and mortally wounded by Mixon. Gonzales rushed into <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>next</b> and tripped on the floor, falling in front of Mixon. Mixon shot at Gonzales while he was falling and may have struck Gonzales in the head, although the bullet was deflected by Gonzales' tactical helmet, which protected him from injury. Spotting Mixon, Gonzales opened fire and was joined by Alameda County Sheriff's Deputy Derrick Pope; Mixon was felled by the barrage of gunfire and died from his wounds at 3:20p.m.|$|E

500|$|In {{his first}} meeting with Capitol Pictures boss Jack Lipnick, Barton {{explains}} that he chose the Earle because he wants lodging that is (as Lipnick says) [...] "less Hollywood". Lipnick promises that his only concern is Barton's writing ability and assigns his new employee to a wrestling film. Back in his room, however, Barton is unable to write. He is distracted by sounds coming from <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>next</b> door, and he phones the front desk to complain. His neighbor, Charlie Meadows, {{is the source of the}} noise and visits Barton to apologize, insisting on sharing some alcohol from a hip flask to make amends. As they talk, Barton proclaims his affection for [...] "the common man", and Charlie describes his life as an insurance salesman. Later, Barton falls asleep, but is awakened by the incessant whine of a mosquito.|$|E
500|$|As Moe's {{voice is}} based on Al Pacino's, {{likewise}} many of Azaria's other recurring characters are based on existing sources. He took Apu's voice from the many Indian and Pakistani convenience store workers in Los Angeles that he had interacted with when he first moved to the area, and also loosely based it on Peter Sellers' character Hrundi V. Bakshi from the film The Party. Originally, {{it was thought that}} Apu being Indian was too offensive and stereotyped, but after Azaria's reading of the line [...] "Hello, Mr. Homer", which the show's producers thought was hilarious, the character stayed. Azaria, however, disputed this on LateNet with Ray Ellin, claiming that Apu was always intended to be stereotypical. Chief Wiggum's voice was originally a parody of David Brinkley, but when Azaria was told it was too slow, he switched it to that of Edward G. Robinson. Officer Lou {{is based on}} Sylvester Stallone, and Dr. Nick is [...] "a bad Ricky Ricardo impression." [...] The [...] "Wise Guy" [...] voice is [...] "basically Charles Bronson," [...] while Carl is [...] "a silly voice [...] always did." [...] Two of the voices come from his time at college: Snake's is based on Azaria's old college roommate, while Comic Book Guy's voice is based on a student who lived in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>next</b> door to Azaria and went by the name [...] "F". Professor Frink is based on Jerry Lewis' performance in the original The Nutty Professor, and the Sea Captain is based on English actor Robert Newton's portrayal of many pirates. Azaria based his performance for the one-time character Frank Grimes, from the episode [...] "Homer's Enemy", on actor William H. Macy. He counts Grimes as the hardest, most emotional performance he has ever had to give in the history of The Simpsons.|$|E
500|$|Makriyannis {{stopped working}} on his memoirs in 1850, so {{information}} {{about the rest of}} his life, including his trial, comes from other sources. He was always outspoken about his views, and as a result he stirred negative reactions among his opponents. He opposed what he perceived as a continued degradation of the veterans of the War of Independence, and had repeatedly been considered suspect of plotting against King Otho. Furthermore, the King never quite forgave him for his part in the 3 September movement. When summoned to the palace and asked to denounce all the conspirators of 1843, Makriyannis refused, saying [...] "I am not a slave". Eventually, in 1852, he was accused of planning to [...] "overthrow the establishments and assassinate the King". On 13 April 1852 he was placed under house arrest, heavily guarded and with an officer posted in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>next</b> to his own. On 16 March 1853 he was sentenced to death, in what has been called a [...] "pre-fabricated trial". According to Vidal-Naquet, the prosecution brought up false testimonies and false evidence. Furthermore, the president of the tribunal, Kitsos Tzavelas, was a personal enemy of Makriyannis. Five out of the six judges voted for the death sentence, and requested the King to extend royal clemency. His sentence was commuted to life imprisonment by the King, but he only spent 18 months in prison. King Otho reduced the sentence first to twenty, and later to ten years. He was finally pardoned and released on 2 September 1854, thanks to the Crimean War. The blockade of Peiraeus by the French and British fleets also led to the imposition of Kallergis as Minister of War, despite his previous attempts at overthrowing the King. Thus, Kallergis used his newly acquired influence to have Makriyannis released. Makriyannis suffered greatly in prison, and after his release suffered from hallucinations. His condition did not improve with the death of one of his younger sons in the cholera epidemic that struck Athens.|$|E
50|$|The {{building}} was constructed mainly from brick and iron, {{in hopes of}} minimising the risk of fire; only the stage was made of wood.

The flat roof over <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> <b>next</b> to <b>the</b> stalls was done in cement. Lighting was electric.|$|R

2500|$|They {{pulled up}} beside a {{dumpster}} rather than pulling up beside the rooms, which the motel manager {{claimed to have}} found strange. Jenkins stayed in the car while a young woman paid cash for three nights' accommodation.

The guest in <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>next</b> door said the woman stayed for about 20 minutes with Jenkins in Room 2 and then left the motel. The woman, {{who turned out to}} be his half sister Alena Jenkins, was never seen again. The manager saw Jenkins walking outside the motel the next day, August 21, 2009. The manager said Jenkins looked exhausted and he was not recognizable from his picture on television.|$|E

[...] According to Looney, Casolaro claimed that his source was scheduled to arrive by 9:00p.m. Around that time, Casolaro left Looney, explaining that he had to make a telephone call. He returned a few minutes later and said that his source might have [...] "blown him off." [...] Casolaro and Looney talked until about 9:30p.m. At about 10.00 p.m., Casolaro bought coffee at a nearby convenience store. That was the last time anyone reported seeing him alive.|$|E
2500|$|He {{was taken}} to a {{building}} where he was attached to a pulley from the ceiling, suspended by handcuffs on his wrists and hoisted off his feet, left there to dangle hour after hour. Each time he was let down, a uniformed officer with a patch on his chest that said [...] "doctor" [...] examined him and took his pulse, said [...] "okay," [...] and the soldiers hoisted him back up again. They also hung him up backwards, with his hands bound behind his back. Kurnaz is not sure how long he was suspended by his arms, but other prisoners informed him it was five days.

2500|$|Poirot {{explains}} that Princess Shaista is an impostor: the real Shaista had been kidnapped earlier in Switzerland, and the apparent abduction was the impostor's {{escape from the}} school.

The murderer knew where the jewels were concealed, having been in Ramat to see Bob Rawlinson hide them. Eileen Rich, who was thought to be sick at the time, was in Ramat. Jennifer thought she had recognised her, although the woman she saw was far heavier. (Miss Rich had been in Ramat for the delivery of an illegitimate child, who was stillborn.) Just as it seems that Miss Rich is becoming a suspect, Mrs Upjohn enters the room and identifies the woman whom she had known fifteen years earlier in her intelligence work: Ann Shapland, known in intelligence circles as [...] "Angelica", a ruthless espionage agent and a mercenary.

After Hutchence's death, Geldof and Yates each gave police statements on the phone calls they exchanged with Hutchence that morning but did not volunteer their phone records. Yates's statement on 26 November included [...] "He was frightened and couldn't stand a minute more without his baby ... was terribly upset and he said, 'I don't know how I'll live without seeing Tiger'". Yates contended that Geldof had repeatedly said, [...] "Don't forget, I am above the law", referring to his influence since Live Aid. Geldof's police statements and evidence to the coroner indicated that he patiently listened to Hutchence who was [...] "hectoring and abusive and threatening".

2500|$|Olivia is {{revealed}} {{to be linked to}} the drug Cortexiphan, a chemical developed by William Bell, which supposedly allows children injected with it to retain higher brain functions which would normally deteriorate with age. Olivia was {{one of a group of}} preschool-age children who served as subjects of the experiment in her childhood home of Jacksonville, Florida. [...] As a result, Olivia is capable of unspecified psychic abilities, as demonstrated when she shuts off a series of lights wired into a bomb as a kill switch simply by thinking it. Walter has a video of Olivia as a child, ostensibly recorded during the drug trials, which shows her curled up in the corner of <b>the</b> <b>room</b> <b>next</b> to a badly charred bed with Walter saying: [...] "It's all right, you didn't mean it." [...] We later learn that Olivia started the fire with her mind. Olivia also had the ability to discern if an object originated in the alternate dimension due to a [...] "glimmer" [...] that only she could see. When trying to reawaken this ability in her as an adult, Dr. Bishop hypothesized that this ability was partially derived from Olivia's fear about seeing into the alternate dimension. [...] When Olivia regains part of her memories of her meeting with Bell, she is told that she is the only successful subject suitable to pass through dimensions without many known negative side-effects. She has been called the guardian of the gateway by Bell, who will prevent the invasion by the alternate dimension.|$|E
