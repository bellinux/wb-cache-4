5|$|Despite having dark plumage in a {{tropical}} climate, frigatebirds have found ways not to overheat—particularly as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> full sunlight when on the nest. They ruffle feathers to lift {{them away from}} the skin and improve air circulation, and can extend and upturn their wings to expose the hot undersurface to the air and lose heat by evaporation and convection. Frigatebirds also place their heads in the shade of their wings, and males frequently flutter their gular pouches.|$|E
5|$|Noise as {{high volume}} {{is common for}} musicians from {{classical}} orchestras to rock groups as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> high decibel ranges. Although some rock musicians experience noise-induced hearing loss from their music, it is still debated as to whether classical musicians are exposed to enough high-intensity sound to cause hearing impairments. Music-induced hearing loss is still a controversial topic for hearing researchers. While some {{studies have shown that}} the risk for hearing loss increases as music exposure increases, other studies found little to no correlation between the two.|$|E
5|$|The British Armed Forces use CS gas {{annually}} {{to test their}} CBRN equipment. During initial training they introduce recruits to CS gas by introducing them into a small enclosed space known as a Respirator Testing Facility (RTF) and igniting chemical tablets to induce CS production. After recruits have carried out their CBRN drills, they must remove their respirators so that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> the CS for up to 20 seconds to experience its effects and become confident their respirators work.|$|E

40|$|This study {{explored}} if Chinese students experienced {{cognitive dissonance}} when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> Christianity {{at a large}} southeast Christian university in the United States, and what were their responses regarding the reduction, increase or change of the cognitive dissonance after <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> Christianity in the United States. Utilizing a qualitative study, the researcher interviewed twelve undergraduate students who were studying at a large southeast Christian university in the United States with eight primary questions and five sub-questions. The ages of the interviewees {{in this study were}} from 18 to 22 years old. The results of the current study indicated that Chinese students experienced cognitive dissonance when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> Christianity in the United States. The three themes that emerged from those twelve interview responses were awareness, uncertainty, and denial. In addition, those Chinese students tended to reduce their cognitive dissonance either by ignoring the new beliefs or by changing their existing beliefs and accepting Christianity...|$|R

5|$|The mycelia (but not {{the fruit}} bodies) of Armillaria gallica {{are known to}} be bioluminescent. Experiments have shown that the {{intensity}} of the luminescence is enhanced when the mycelia are disturbed during growth or when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> fluorescent light. Bioluminescence is caused by the action of luciferases, enzymes that produce light by the oxidation of a luciferin (a pigment). The biological purpose of bioluminescence in fungi is not definitively known, although several hypotheses have been suggested: it may help attract insects to help with spore dispersal, it may be a by-product of other biochemical functions, or it may help deter heterotrophs that might consume the fungus.|$|E
5|$|The {{orange and}} brown {{coloration}} {{in the clouds}} of Jupiter are caused by upwelling compounds that change color when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> ultraviolet light from the Sun. The exact makeup remains uncertain, but the substances {{are thought to be}} phosphorus, sulfur or possibly hydrocarbons. These colorful compounds, known as chromophores, mix with the warmer, lower deck of clouds. The zones are formed when rising convection cells form crystallizing ammonia that masks out these lower clouds from view.|$|E
5|$|Artyom {{finds the}} Dark One, a child, but is {{captured}} by {{soldiers of the}} Fourth Reich. Pavel Morozov, a captured Red Line soldier, and Artyom escape through the Metro tunnels and across the devastated surface. When they reach the Red Line, however, Pavel is revealed to be a high-ranking officer; he detains Artyom {{to learn more about}} the Rangers and the Dark One. Artyom escapes and races Pavel's forces to locate the Dark One and Anna, who has been kidnapped by Lesnitsky, an ex-Ranger and Red Line spy. En route, he finds a contingent of Red Line forces massacring the inhabitants of a station, supposedly to contain a mysterious epidemic. It was the Red Line that introduced the virus to the station – weaponized Ebola acquired from the D6 vault by Lesnitsky. Artyom finds Anna and frees her but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> the virus and are quarantined after rescue. Afraid that she will die, Anna seduces Artyom.|$|E
40|$|A 2 by 2 {{factorial}} experiment {{was conducted to}} examine how positive and negative mood and types of ad appeals influence people 2 ̆ 7 s information processing styles, and evaluations of the ad, product and purchase intention. A total of 263 undergraduate students at Iowa State University were recruited as participants in this study. The {{study was conducted in}} two separate phases; the first phase involved mood manipulation and the second phase focused on ad and brand evaluation. The findings showed that people in a positive mood were more likely to utilize relational processing, whereas people in a negative mood were more likely to utilize item-specific processing. Also, people tended to utilize relational processing when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> an experiential appeal, whereas people tended to utilize item-specific processing when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> a utilitarian appeal. However, the study failed to find any significant interaction effects between mood and message characteristics. The results showed that people in both positive and negative mood states evaluated ad and product more positively when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> ad with an experiential appeal. Mood and message characteristics did not have significant influence on people 2 ̆ 7 s purchase intention...|$|R

25|$|These {{results show}} that {{at the age of}} 6 months infants are {{sensitive}} to how often certain sounds occur in the language <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> and they can learn which cues are important to pay attention to from these differences in frequency of occurrence. In natural language exposure this means typical sounds in a language (such as prevoiced /d/ in Spanish) occur often and infants can learn them from mere exposure to them in the speech they hear. All of this occurs before infants are aware of the meaning of any of the words <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to,</b> and therefore the phenomenon of statistical learning has been used to argue for the fact that infants can learn sound contrasts without meaning being attached to them.|$|E

25|$|Babbling {{is assumed}} to occur in all {{children}} acquiring language. Particularly it has been studied in English, Italian, Korean, French, Spanish, Japanese and Swedish. Infants across the world follow general trends in babbling tendencies. Differences that do appear {{are the result of}} the infants' sensitivity to the characteristics of the language(s) <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to.</b> Infants mimick the prosody of the language(s) <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to.</b> They use intonation patterns and timing that matches the characteristics of their parent language. Infants also babble using the consonants and vowels that occur most frequently in their parent language. Most babbling consists of a small number of sounds, which suggests the child is preparing the basic sounds necessary to speak the language to which it is exposed.|$|E
25|$|Expanded worldview: TCKs have an {{understanding}} {{that there is more}} than one way to look at situations that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> or experience.

25|$|At 6 months, infants {{are also}} able {{to make use of}} {{prosodic}} features of the ambient language to break the speech stream <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> into meaningful units, e.g., they are better able to distinguish sounds that occur in stressed vs. unstressed syllables. This means that at 6 months infants have some knowledge of the stress patterns in the speech they are exposed and they have learned that these patterns are meaningful.|$|E
25|$|Malignant {{hyperthermia}} is {{a disorder}} {{that can be}} considered a gene-environment interaction. In most people with malignant hyperthermia susceptibility, they have few or no symptoms unless <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> a triggering agent. The most common triggering agents are volatile anesthetic gases, such as halothane, sevoflurane, desflurane, isoflurane, enflurane or the depolarizing muscle relaxants suxamethonium and decamethonium used primarily in general anesthesia. In rare cases, the biological stresses of physical exercise or heat may be the trigger.|$|E
40|$|This {{experiment}} {{investigated the}} prime frequency effect of masked affective stimuli on effort-related cardiovascular response. Cardiovascular reactivity was recorded during a baseline period and an attention task in which either 1 / 3, 2 / 3, or 3 / 3 {{of the trials}} included the presentation of masked emotional facial expressions (sad vs. happy). In the resting trials participants <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> masked neutral expressions. As expected, and replicating previous findings (Gendolla and Silvestrini, in press), participants in the 1 / 3 priming condition showed stronger systolic blood pressure reactivity – indicating more effort – when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> masked sad faces than when <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> masked happy faces. This effect disappeared in the 2 / 3 and 3 / 3 conditions. Findings are interpreted as demonstrating habituation effects of masked affective stimuli on effort mobilization...|$|R

25|$|Infants {{are able}} to extract {{meaningful}} distinctions in the language <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> from statistical properties of that language. For example, if English-learning infants are exposed to a prevoiced /d/ to voiceless unaspirated /t/ continuum (similar to the /d/ - /t/ distinction in Spanish) {{with the majority of}} the tokens occurring near the endpoints of the continuum, i.e., showing extreme prevoicing versus long voice onset times (bimodal distribution) they are better at discriminating these sounds than infants who are exposed primarily to tokens {{from the center of the}} continuum (unimodal distribution).|$|E
25|$|Birds {{have both}} REM and NREM sleep, and the EEG {{patterns}} of both have similarities {{to those of}} mammals. Different birds sleep different amounts, but the associations seen in mammals between sleep and variables such as body mass, brain mass, relative brain mass, basal metabolism and other factors (see below) are not found in birds. The only clear explanatory factor for the variations in sleep amounts for birds of different species is that birds who sleep in environments where <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> predators have less deep sleep than birds sleeping in more protected environments.|$|E
