5|$|One of the {{innovations}} of the Dewey Decimal system {{was that of}} positioning books on <b>the</b> <b>shelves</b> {{in relation to other}} books on similar topics. When the system was first introduced, most libraries in the US used fixed positioning: each book was assigned a permanent shelf position based on the book's height and date of acquisition. Library stacks were generally closed to all but the most privileged patrons, so shelf browsing was not considered of importance. The use of the Dewey Decimal system increased during the early 20th century as librarians were convinced of the advantages of relative positioning and of open shelf access for patrons.|$|E

5|$|A toyline for {{the film}} was {{confirmed}} by Hasbro in February 2012. Despite the movie's release being moved from June 2012 to March 2013, the initial assortments of figures, vehicles, and role-play items were shipped to retailers, and appeared on store shelves in May 2012. A Variety article was published stating that the already released figures had been pulled from <b>the</b> <b>shelves</b> and recalled by Hasbro, although the company's official statement indicated that existing product would be sold through. New product shipments were halted by Hasbro, but existing Retaliation figures were available in Target, Wal-Mart, and Toys R Us as late as December 2012.

5|$|Sirrus and Achenar beg the Stranger not {{to touch}} the green book that is stored in the same {{location}} as their final pages. They claim {{that it is a}} book like their own that will trap the Stranger. In truth, it leads to D'ni, where Atrus is imprisoned. When the book is opened, Atrus asks the Stranger to bring him a final page that is hidden on Myst Island; without it, he cannot bring his sons to justice. The game has several endings, depending on the player's actions. Giving either Sirrus or Achenar the final page of their book causes the Stranger to switch places with the son, leaving the player trapped inside the Prison book. Linking to D'ni without the page Atrus asks for leaves the Stranger and Atrus trapped on D'ni. Linking to D'ni with the page allows Atrus to complete his Myst book and return to the island. Upon returning to the library, the player finds the red and blue books gone, and burn marks on <b>the</b> <b>shelves</b> where they used to be.|$|E

40|$|Material {{property}} distributions on continental <b>shelves</b> {{result from}} <b>the</b> mixing and modifications of estuarine and deep-ocean source waters. How this occurs {{depends on the}} momentum and buoyancy that are input either locally on <b>the</b> <b>shelf</b> or from <b>the</b> deep-ocean at <b>the</b> <b>shelf</b> break. We address this question of local versus deep-ocean forcing for <b>the</b> West Florida <b>Shelf</b> (WFS) using in situ data and a numerical circulation model. The spring and summer seasons of 1998 and 1999 show distinctively different water properties on <b>the</b> <b>shelf</b> and at <b>the</b> <b>shelf</b> break. We account for these differences {{by a combination of}} local forcing, independent of the adjacent Gulf of Mexico Loop Current, and interactions of the Loop Current with <b>the</b> <b>shelf.</b> <b>The</b> primary role of the deep ocean is to set the height of material isopleths along <b>the</b> <b>shelf</b> slope. Whether or not these material isopleths broach <b>the</b> <b>shelf</b> break is then a consequence of local, shelf-wide wind and buoyancy forcing. The subsequent along- and across-shelf distributions are accomplished through a combination of local and deep-ocean effects, with the bottom Ekman layer being the major conduit for the across-shelf transport of ecologically important materials...|$|R
5|$|Kenwood {{has three}} floors: {{on the ground}} floor during the Lennon period the front door opened onto an {{entrance}} hall, where Lennon placed a suit of armour and a gorilla suit. Across the hall was a large living room, which had black carpets, two 18-foot sofas and a marble fireplace. To the left of the hall was a toilet, and through the living room was a dining room, where purple, velvet wallpaper was put up. Adjacent to the dining room, {{at the back of the}} house, was a small sunroom. This was decorated with various pictures, caricatures and stickers, such as the one from the Safe as Milk debut album (1967) by Captain Beefheart & His Magic Band, and one advertising the Monterey Pop Festival. Photos published by The Beatles Book Monthly show <b>the</b> <b>shelves</b> of the sunroom filled with articles such as a large, ornate cross, a Mickey Mouse doll and a mortar and pestle, reportedly used by Lennon to mix various combinations of cocaine, amphetamine, barbiturates and LSD. There was also a yellow sofa or chaise-longue upon which Lennon would spend much of his time. It was a present from his aunt, Elizabeth Smith (née Stanley) also known as Mimi. Behind the sunroom was the split-level kitchen where state-of-the-art appliances were installed, so complex that a tutor had to come and give the Lennons lessons in their use.|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>shelf</b> usually ends at a {{point of}} {{increasing}} slope (called <b>the</b> <b>shelf</b> break). <b>The</b> sea floor below the break is the continental slope. Below the slope is the continental rise, which finally merges into the deep ocean floor, the abyssal plain. <b>The</b> continental <b>shelf</b> and <b>the</b> slope {{are part of the}} continental margin. <b>The</b> <b>shelf</b> area is commonly subdivided into <b>the</b> inner continental <b>shelf,</b> mid continental shelf, and outer continental shelf, each with their specific geomorphology and marine biology. The character of <b>the</b> <b>shelf</b> changes dramatically at <b>the</b> <b>shelf</b> break, where <b>the</b> continental slope begins.

40|$|The {{water quality}} on <b>the</b> {{southern}} <b>shelf</b> of Cayuga Lake {{is of interest}} locally - it is used for recreation, water supply, and the disposal of treated wastewater, but also more broadly since the factors that control the water quality in this system are common to many lakes and coastal systems. The configuration of a shallow shelf that receives both natural flows and anthropogenic nutrient loads, {{while at the same}} time being connected to a larger body of water whose dynamics strongly affect the system is commonly found in many embayment and estuarine systems. The question of what mechanisms control the water quality of the system and how is complicated by the fact that the processes of interest are highly intermittent, both in frequency and in magnitude, and vary both randomly and on seasonal and interannual timescales. Using an 11 year (1998 - 2008) record of water quality data collected biweekly during the April - October months of each year at 9 sites in the lake, we examine the response of the water quality on <b>the</b> southern <b>shelf</b> of Cayuga Lake to various physical forcing conditions (e. g., surface runoff and internal seiche dynamics) and various loading and flow rates from natural and anthropogenic sources. Several cases of extreme forcing and system response are examined and metrics of correlation of water quality parameters with forcing conditions are calculated. We hypothesize that in the absence of strong forcing in the form of high flow rates in the tributaries to <b>the</b> <b>shelf,</b> water quality on <b>the</b> <b>shelf</b> and <b>the</b> spatial gradients in water quality on <b>the</b> <b>shelf</b> are controlled by the interaction of basin scale internal waves and <b>the</b> <b>shelf</b> slope. When <b>the</b> wind blows from the south for a duration greater than the lake's uninodal horizontal seiche period (T/ 4), the thermocline tilts up in the vicinity of <b>the</b> <b>shelf.</b> This leads to reduced exchange between <b>the</b> <b>shelf</b> and <b>the</b> main basin's epilimnion, resulting in higher nutrient levels near loading sources on <b>the</b> <b>shelf.</b> When <b>the</b> wind blows from the north the thermocline is tilted down near <b>the</b> <b>shelf,</b> exchange across <b>the</b> <b>shelf</b> break is increased, resulting in lower levels of nutrients on <b>the</b> <b>shelf.</b> Gradients in averaged metrics of water quality exist between different parts of <b>the</b> <b>shelf.</b> We suggest that these gradients can in part be explained by effects of the earth's rotation, which cause runup of internal waves on <b>the</b> <b>shelf</b> slope to generally be higher on the western part of <b>the</b> <b>shelf</b> than <b>the</b> eastern, leading to increased mixing with hyplimnetic water and reduced levels of metrics such as chlorophyll-a concentrations...|$|R
