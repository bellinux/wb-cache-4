25|$|Anesthesia awareness, also {{referred}} to as accidental awareness during general anaesthesia (AAGA) or unintended intra-operative awareness, is a potential complication occurring during general anesthesia where the intended state of complete unconsciousness is not maintained throughout the whole procedure. It can occur either because of failure to deliver sufficient anesthetic medication to the patient's body, or because of individual patient factors <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> the patient is resistant to what would normally be an adequate dose of anesthetic medication.|$|E
25|$|Another {{controversy}} {{involved the}} Reparations Agreement between Israel and West Germany. Should kibbutz members turn over income {{that was the}} product of a very personal loss? If Holocaust survivors were allowed to keep their reparation money, what would <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> for the principle of equality? Eventually, many kibbutzim made this one concession to inequality by letting Holocaust survivors keep all or a percentage of their reparations. Reparations that were turned over to the collective were used for building expansion and even recreational activities.|$|E

25|$|A {{method to}} {{estimate}} the reference range for a parameter with log-normal distribution is to logarithmize all the measurements with an arbitrary base (for example e), derive the {{mean and standard deviation}} of these logarithms, determine the logarithms located (for a 95% prediction interval) 1.96 standard deviations below and above <b>that</b> <b>mean,</b> and subsequently exponentiate using those two logarithms as exponents and using the same base as was used in logarithmizing, with the two resultant values being the lower and upper limit of the 95% prediction interval.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{the pure}} science of optics is called optical science or optical physics to {{distinguish}} it from applied optical sciences, which {{are referred to as}} optical engineering. Prominent subfields of optical engineering include illumination engineering, photonics, and optoelectronics with practical applications like lens design, fabrication and testing of optical components, and image processing. Some of these fields overlap, with nebulous boundaries between the subjects terms <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> slightly different things {{in different parts of the}} world and in different areas of industry. A professional community of researchers in nonlinear optics has developed in the last several decades due to advances in laser technology.|$|E
25|$|Other {{scholars}} explain team {{performance by}} aggregating team members' general intelligence {{to the team}} level instead of building an own overall collective intelligence measure. Devine and Philips (2001) showed in a meta-analysis <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> cognitive ability predicts team performance in laboratory settings (.37) as well as field settings (.14) – note that {{this is only a}} small effect. Suggesting a strong dependence on the relevant tasks, other scholars showed that tasks requiring a high degree of communication and cooperation are found to be most influenced by the team member with the lowest cognitive ability. Tasks in which selecting the best team member is the most successful strategy, are shown to be most influenced by the member with the highest cognitive ability.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of the CSF is formed in the choroid plexus and flows through the brain along a distinct pathway: moving through the cerebral ventricular system, into the subarachnoid space surrounding the brain, then draining into the systemic blood column via arachnoid granulations of the dural sinuses or to peripheral lymphatics along cranial nerve sheathes. Many researchers {{have suggested that the}} CSF compartment constitutes a sink for interstitial solute and fluid clearance from the brain parenchyma. However, the distances between the interstitial fluid and the CSF in the ventricles and subarachnoid space are too great for the efficient removal of interstitial macromolecules and wastes by simple diffusion alone. Helen Cserr at Brown University calculated <b>that</b> <b>mean</b> diffusion times for large molecules such as albumin would exceed 100hrs to traverse 1cm of brain tissue, a rate that is not compatible with the intense metabolic demands of brain tissue. A clearance system based on simple diffusion would additionally lack the sensitivity to respond rapidly to deviations from homeostatic conditions.|$|E

Parker said, [...] "We kept hearing that word so much. We were like, 'What does <b>that</b> <b>mean,</b> sold out? What did we get and what did we do?'

[...] Nevertheless, the episode received generally positive reviews, and has been described as one of South Park [...] "classic episodes".|$|E

500|$|Under {{new manager}} Charlie Manuel, whose {{offensive}} strategy predominantly revolved around hitting lots of home runs, Rollins struggled {{to post a}} strong batting average early in the Phillies' 2005 season, as he too tried to hit home runs. Nevertheless, he was again selected to the NL All-Star team. His offensive strategy changed in early August, when he began a hitting streak that spanned the season's final 36 games; during the streak, he hit [...]379. It was the longest hitting streak in Phillies' history, surpassing Ed Delahanty, whose streak lasted 31 games. Throughout the streak, Rollins aspired to maintain a team-first mentality, and noted that he would trade the streak for a playoff berth: [...] "If we lose and I keep the streak, what does <b>that</b> <b>mean?</b> The season is automatically over. The playoffs is everything. That's what we all want." [...] Ultimately, the Phillies missed the playoffs by one game. Overall, Rollins compiled his fourth career quadruple-double, tying Johnny Damon for most among active players, and posted a [...]290 batting average with 12 home runs, 54 RBIs, and 41 stolen bases.|$|E
500|$|Two {{new family}} attractions called Pipe Scream and Lake Erie Eagles were added in 2014, {{along with a}} pay-per-ride thrill ride named SlingShot. Camp Snoopy and the Gemini Midway {{underwent}} renovations the same year, and some rides within those areas were relocated and given new themes. In 2015, the stand-up coaster Mantis {{was transformed into a}} floorless roller coaster called Rougarou, receiving new trains and a new green and orange paint scheme in the process. Also in 2015, Hotel Breakers received a $25-million renovation. A new roller coaster called Valravn debuted in 2016 as the tallest, fastest, and longest dive coaster in the world. The [...] ride replaced the 40-year-old Good Time Theater along with an antique car ride known as Turnpike Cars. Calypso was also moved in the process to the beach area near Wicked Twister, where it was renamed Tiki Twirl. Raptor and Top Thrill Dragster were repainted as well.

500|$|On August 1, 2016, Cedar Point {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>Mean</b> Streak {{would offer}} its last rides {{to the public}} on September 16, 2016. Park officials, however, declined {{to confirm that the}} ride was being torn down. Following its closure, unconfirmed rumors emerged that the roller coaster was being refurbished by Rocky Mountain Construction (RMC), a manufacturing company well-known for its restoration work on existing roller coasters. The company has refurbished, and in many cases completely transformed, other wooden roller coasters with applications of either of its two patented technologies: I-Box and Topper track. Cedar Point began teasing the public on the ride's future with the release of an 18-second teaser video entitled [...] "They're Coming" [...] on April 1, 2017. Cedar Point showed video shots briefly panning several elements of the rumored conversion. Another similar video showing snippets of the new ride was released a few months later in June. Three more videos would be released over the summer of 2017, with catchphrases “They‘re rollin’ in like thunder”, [...] "There's a score to settle", and [...] "They stake their claim". On August 16, 2017, Cedar Point held an official announcement for Steel Vengeance.|$|E
