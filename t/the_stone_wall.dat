5|$|The British waited half an {{hour before}} attacking again. This time when they {{attacked}}, they attacked with all 4,000 men and seven cannon. The British bombarded the American position behind <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> as their infantry advanced. The cannon fire was ineffective, and when the British were 50 yards away the Americans fired a volley which stopped the British infantry. The British returned fire, and musket and rifle fire ensued for 20 minutes, the British supported by cannon, at which point the lead American regiment fell back under cover of the next reserve regiment. The 3rd Continental Regiment was stationed behind <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> {{on the opposite side of}} the road.|$|E

This is where a merchant contract between the Republic of Venice and the Serbian Despotate was signed.|$|E

40|$|The authors {{investigated}} the damage situation of masonry structures {{caused by the}} 2016 Kumamoto earthquake. In this paper, the damage situation of <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> in Kumamoto castle is reported and the mechanisms of failure and collapse of <b>stones</b> are discussed. <b>The</b> 3 -D laser scanner was also applied to obtain the 3 D geometry and the displacement/deformation of <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> was analyzed by comparing with the previous measurement results before the earthquake. The 3 D laser scanning results clearly show the unnatural shape of <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> caused by <b>the</b> movement of the backfill. This unnatural shape of <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> can be observed even in <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> <b>walls</b> which avoid <b>the</b> collapse.

5|$|St Leonard's Tower {{is located}} {{on the edge of the}} village of West Malling, on a {{sandstone}} promontory, overlooking a valley leading down to the river River Medway. The base of the tower rests directly on the rock, levelled up with masonry to form a plinth. The tower was probably originally surrounded by service buildings, possibly within a walled enclosure, part of which may survive in <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> running from the castle to the north-east.|$|E
5|$|To {{film the}} scenes at the Wall the {{production}} built a {{set on the}} abandoned quarry of Magheramorne, a few minutes north of Belfast. The composite set (with both exteriors and interiors) consisted of a large section of Castle Black including the courtyard, the ravenry, the mess hall and the barracks, and used <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> of the quarry {{as the basis for}} the ice wall that protects Westeros from the dangers that dwell beyond. They also made a real elevator to lift the rangers to the top of the Wall.|$|E

The Americans retreated across a bridge over the Hutchinson stream, their retreat covered by the 150 men of the 14th Continentals who engaged in an artillery duel with the British. Howe camped on a hill {{on the opposite side of}} the stream but made no attempt to cross the stream.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí {{carried out}} a second {{commission}} from Eusebi Güell between 1884 and 1887, the Güell Pavilions in Pedralbes, now {{on the outskirts of}} Barcelona. Güell had a country residence in Les Corts de Sarrià, consisting of two adjacent properties known as Can Feliu and Can Cuyàs de la Riera. The architect Joan Martorell had built a Caribbean-style mansion, which was demolished in 1919 {{to make way for the}} Royal Palace of Pedralbes. Gaudí undertook to refurbish the house and construct a wall and porter's lodge. He completed <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> with several entrances, the main entrance with an iron gate in the shape of a dragon, with symbology allusive to the myths of Hercules and the Garden of the Hesperides. The buildings consist of a stable, covered longeing ring and porter's lodge: the stable has a rectangular base and catenary arches; the longeing ring has a square base with a hyperboloid dome; the porter's lodge consists of three small buildings, the central one being polygonal with a hyperbolic dome, and the other two smaller and cubic. All three are topped by ventilators in the shape of chimneys faced with ceramics. The walls are of exposed brick in various shades of reds and yellows; in certain sections prefabricated cement blocks are also used. The Pavilions are now the headquarters of the Real Cátedra Gaudí, of the Polytechnic University of Catalonia.|$|E
5|$|In 1776 the Marquess {{began to}} {{renovate}} the property {{with the intention of}} turning it into a residence for his son, John. The grounds were radically altered under a programme of work that involved Capability Brown and his son-in-law, Henry Holland. <b>The</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> that separated the inner and outer baileys was destroyed using gunpowder, the Shire Hall and the knights' houses in the outer bailey were destroyed and the remaining ground partially flattened; the whole of the area was laid with turf. Considerable work was carried out on the main lodgings, demolishing the Herbert additions, building two new wings and removing many of the older features to produce a more contemporary, 18th century appearance. The keep and motte was stripped of the ivy and trees that had grown up them, and a spiral path was laid down around the motte. The motte's moat was filled in as part of the landscaping. A summer house was built in the south-east corner of the castle. Further work was planned on the property, including a reported proposal to roof the keep in copper, insert new windows and turn it into an assembly room for dances, but these projects were cut short by the Marquess's son's death in 1794.|$|E

5|$|Andrianampoinimerina {{removed the}} twin houses {{to build his}} much larger Mahandrihono residence, which was {{decorated}} with silver birds and chains. He also expanded the compound and added a second enclosure of voafotsy wood (replaced annually) around {{the exterior of the}} stone walls. Mandraimanjaka was removed and in its place Andrianampoinimerina built a house with a small tower, which he named Manjakamiadana ("where it is good to rule"), designating it as the residence for the royal sampy (idol) called Imanjakatsiroa and the guardians assigned to protect it. Two other idols were kept nearby: Ifantaka, kept in a house in the Bevato compound, and Kelimalaza, guarded in its house at the Ambohimanga neighborhood of Ambohimirary. Under Radama I, <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> was reinforced with palisades that enclosed three houses, two of which were twin houses like those that Andriambelomasina had built. Ranavalona I enlarged the compound's courtyard and expanded Manjakamiadana. She constructed the stone walls that currently enclose the compound, as well as its two stone gateways. Ranavalona II re-added palisades to the compound's stone walls. She demolished Manjakamiadana and in its place constructed two hybrid Malagasy-European pavilions using wood from the historic and spiritually significant Masoandro house, which had been removed from the royal compound of Antananarivo by Ranavalona I. French general Joseph Gallieni used these European-influenced buildings as his summer residence {{in the early years of}} the French colonial period. In 2013, Andrianampoinimerina's original house, the reconstructed tombs, and the two royal pavilions are preserved in the compound, which also includes a watchtower, a pen for sacrificial zebu, and two pools constructed during the reign of Ranavalona I.|$|E

25|$|The Julian Street Jr. {{residence}} {{is still}} extant. By 1974, {{the house was}} owned by Howard and Janette R. Tomkins and the property was subdivided to allow a separate building lot. Other changes were the removal of <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> and guardrail by the driveway, which was then paved with asphalt, and building a playhouse {{at the top of}} a rock pile in front of the house. The house was also changed: <b>the</b> <b>stone</b> <b>wall</b> behind the house was extended into a curve while the front gravel walkway was retained, the ramp behind the serpentine wall had stairs added to it, a curved wall was added in front of the front door, and a flagstone terrace was added to the back and side of the west part of the house. By the late 1970s, the house was owned by the Birnbaum family, who added steps to the front ramp up to the house, reduced the height of the serpentine wall, and added a raised entertainment area in part of the large living room.|$|E
25|$|During {{the phase}} of {{occupation}} from 160AD, a number of turrets fell out of use, and their doorways were blocked up.
