Figure  9 illustrates this classification of arcs in GMAW (Iordachescu and Quintino 2008). The figure shows the controlled, fundamental, and transfer modes in the same diagram, and each part is separated by <b>transition</b> <b>current</b> zones. The first <b>transition</b> <b>current</b> separates the controlled and fundamental modes, and the second <b>transition</b> <b>current</b> separates the spray and globular fundamental group areas. In addition, the mode of arc changes with increasing welding current and arc voltage.

A <b>transition</b> <b>current</b> density was noticed above which a transition from normal to anomalous deposition took place.

This <b>transition</b> <b>current</b> density that resulted in normal to anomalous deposition was attributed to the shift in cathodic potential or polarization. However, it was found that under certain conditions the transition occurred from very high wt. % Co to almost equal to the amount of Co in the electrolyte. The increase of Fe 2 + ions in the electrolyte assisted in increasing the Co content and decreasing the Zn content in the deposits.

40|$|The gauging of {{equations}} method, {{introduced in}} the preceding paper, {{is applied to the}} four-dimensional integral equations describing the strong interactions of three identical relativistic particles. In this way we obtain gauge invariant expressions for all possible electromagnetic <b>transition</b> <b>currents</b> of the identical three-particle system. In the three-nucleon system with no isospin violation, for example, our expressions describe the electromagnetic form factors of ^ 3 H, pd->pd gamma, gamma ^ 3 He-> pd, gamma ^ 3 He-> ppn, etc. A feature of our approach is that gauge invariance is achieved through the coupling of the photon to all possible places in the (nonperturbative) strong interaction model. Moreover, once the proper identical particle symmetry is incorporated into the integral eqations describing the strong interactions, the gauging procedure automatically provides electromagnetic <b>transition</b> <b>currents</b> with the proper symmetry. In this way the gauging of equations method results in a unified description of strong and electromagnetic interaction of strongly interacting systems.

40|$|Transistlw-level power simulators, {{which are}} more {{accurate}} than logic-level power estimators, have been popularly used to estimate the power dissipation of CMOS circuits. In this papel; we introduce c c 1 method which extends the Monte-Carlo approach for deriving the average power dissipation of a circuit using transistor-level power simula-tors. To reduce the simulation time, we propose a mixed-level extrapolation technique {{to speed up the}} convergence rate of the process, and thereby to achieve a good balance between simulation time and accuracy. Experimental results show that this is a promising method for deriving the accurate power dissipation of a circuit within reasonable time budget. 1. Introdiuction For a CIMOS circuit, the power dissipation is primarily caused by three types of currents: device leakage current, short-circuit current, and dynamic <b>transition</b> <b>current.</b> It is known that the power dissipation caused by device leakage current (staric current) is usually very small and negligible as compared with the dynamic <b>transition</b> <b>current.</b> The short-circuit curre:nt occurs whenever a path from v,d to ground is conducted at a device {{for a short period of}} time. In some cases, shon:-circuit current cannot be ignored. However, only the trimistor-level simulators with continuous-time modeling of the device can accurately take this part into consideration [4]. Logic-level power estimators usually ignore the short-circuit current and focus on the dynamic <b>transition</b> <b>current,</b> which is well recognized as the most dominating factor of power dissipation in a CMOS circuit. Dynamic transition power is strongly related to the tran-sition densities/probabilities of internal signals [2]. Almost all logic-level power estimators [5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 14] rely on deriving these transition densities/probabilities to estimate the power dissipation. A stochastic approach proposed i...|$|E

The wires were made of niobium, niobium alloyed with 10 %, 25 % and 33 % zirconium, and PbBi 18 %. The wire diameters ranged from 10 mils to 62. 5 mils. Near 4. 2 °K all the wires containing niobium remained superconducting until the peak value of the 60 cps. magnetic field at some point on the wire surface had reached or exceeded the bulk critical field of niobium. For the lead alloy the peak value was higher than expected for pure lead. The d. c. <b>transition</b> <b>currents</b> were also measured and were usually greater than the peak a. c. values.
