The dominant challenge {{for the remainder of}} the 1960s was to obtain low <b>threshold</b> <b>current</b> density at 300 K and thereby to demonstrate continuous-wave lasing at room temperature from a diode laser.|$|E

Strength-duration curves are useful in studies where the current required is changed when the pulse duration is changed.|$|E
25|$|A {{laser diode}} is {{electrically}} a PIN diode. The active {{region of the}} laser diode is in the intrinsic (I) region, and the carriers (electrons and holes) are pumped into that region from the N and P regions respectively. While initial diode laser research was conducted on simple P-N diodes, all modern lasers use the double-hetero-structure implementation, where the carriers and the photons are confined {{in order to maximize}} their chances for recombination and light generation. Unlike a regular diode, the goal for a laser diode is to recombine all carriers in the I region, and produce light. Thus, laser diodes are fabricated using direct band-gap semiconductors. The laser diode epitaxial structure is grown using one of the crystal growth techniques, usually starting from an N doped substrate, and growing the I doped active layer, followed by the P doped cladding, and a contact layer. The active layer most often consists of quantum wells, which provide lower <b>threshold</b> <b>current</b> and higher efficiency.|$|E
2500|$|However {{this does}} not mean the current is harmless. [...] Even a small Tesla coil {{produces}} many times the electrical energy necessary to stop the heart, if the frequency happens to be low enough to cause ventricular fibrillation. [...] A minor misadjustment of the coil could result in electrocution. [...] In addition, the RF current heats the tissues it passes through. Tesla coil currents, applied directly to the skin by electrodes, were used in the early 20th century for deep body tissue heating in the medical field of longwave diathermy. [...] The amount of heating depends on the current density, which depends on the power output of the Tesla coil and the cross-sectional area of the path the current takes through the body to ground. [...] Particularly if it passes through narrow structures such as blood vessels or joints it may raise the local tissue temperature to hyperthermic levels, [...] "cooking" [...] internal organs or causing other injuries. [...] International ICNIRP safety standards for RF current in the body in the Tesla coil frequency range of 0.1 - 1MHz specify a maximum current density of 0.2mA per square centimeter and a maximum power absorption rate (SAR) in tissue of 4W/kg in limbs and 0.8W/kg average over the body. [...] Even low power Tesla coils could exceed these limits, and it is generally impossible to determine the <b>threshold</b> <b>current</b> where bodily injury begins. [...] Being struck by arcs from a high power (> 1000 watt) Tesla coil is likely to be fatal.|$|E

40|$|Abstruct- We {{demonstrated}} the successful operation of long-wavelength InGaAsP low threshold-current index-coupled and gain-coupled DFB lasers grown by chemical beam epitaxy (CBE). For index-coupled DFB lasers, buried-heterostructure six-QW DFB lasers (250 pm long and as-cleaved) operated at 1. 55 Lrm with CW <b>threshold</b> <b>currents</b> 10 - 15 mA and slope efficiencies up to 0. 35 mW/mA (both facets). A side-mode suppression ratio (SMSR) {{as high as}} 49 dB was obtained. The lasers operated in the same range even at high temperatures (70 "C checked). For gain-coupled DFB lasers, gain-coupling is accomplished by using a InGaAsP quaternary grating or quantum-well grating that absorbs the DFB emission. The use of a quantum-well grating, in particular, greatly facilitates the reproducible regrowth (defect-free) over grating and {{the control of the}} coupling coefficient.

40|$|The {{temperature}} dependence of <b>threshold</b> <b>currents</b> in constricted double-heterojunction diode lasers with strong lateral mode confinement {{is found to}} be significantly milder than for other types of lasers.

5000|$|In {{addition}} to inhibiting neural excitability, {{it has been}} observed that preceding an electrical stimulus with a depolarizing pre-pulse allows one to invert the current-distance relationship controlling nerve fiber recruitment, where the current-distance relationship describes how the <b>threshold</b> <b>current</b> for nerve fiber excitation is proportional to the square of the distance between the nerve fiber and the electrode. [...] Therefore, if the region of influence for the depolarizing pre-pulse is less than that for the stimulus, the nerve fibers closer to the electrode will experience a greater increase in their <b>threshold</b> <b>current</b> for excitation. Thus, provided such a stimulus, the nerve fibers closest to the electrode may be inhibited, while those further away may be excited. [...] A simulation of this stimulation, constructed by Drs. Warren Grill and J. Thomas Mortimer, may be observed in the adjacent image. Building upon this, a stimulus with two depolarizing pre-pulses, each of an amplitude slightly below the <b>threshold</b> <b>current</b> (at the time of delivery), should increase the radii of influence for nearby nerve fiber inactivation and distant nevre fiber excitation.|$|E
