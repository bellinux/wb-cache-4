40|$|Continuous {{monitoring}} of structural vibrations {{is becoming increasingly}} common as sensors and data acquisition systems become more affordable, and as system and damage identification methods develop. In vibration-based structural health monitoring, the dynamic modal parameters of a structure are usually used as damage-sensitive features. The modal parameters are often sensitive to changing environmental conditions such as temperature, humidity, or excitation amplitude. Environmental conditions can have as large {{an effect on the}} modal parameters as significant structural damage, so these effects should be accounted for before applying damage identification methods. This paper presents results from a continuous monitoring system installed on the Dowling Hall Footbridge on the campus of Tufts University. Significant variability in <b>the</b> <b>identified</b> natural <b>frequencies</b> is observed; these changes in natural frequency are strongly correlated with temperature. Several nonlinear models are proposed to represent the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>identified</b> natural <b>frequencies</b> and measured temperatures.

The success of these applications depends on the fidelity of <b>the</b> <b>identified</b> <b>frequency</b> responses and the de-gree to which the process is automated, as well as the costs, in terms of gate count, time duration of identification, and effect on output voltage, incurred to obtain these benefits. This paper demonstrates the feasibility of incorporating fully automated frequency response measurement capabilities in digital PWM controllers at relatively low additional cost. In particular, it is shown that relatively accurate and smooth frequency response data can be obtained using a Verilog-coded implementation with low tens of thousands of logic gates and about 10 kB of memory. The identification process can be accomplished in several hundred milliseconds and the output voltage can be kept within speci-fied bounds during the entire process.

A Magnetic Exciter was installed at the shaft end in order to excite the first lateral mode of the rotor at running conditions, the frequency and logarithmic decrement of the first mode was identified by analyzing the Frequency Response Functions with classic techniques (D. J. Ewins, 1984). A new method for turbomachinery applications based on Operational Modal Analysis (OMA) is presented for the identification of modal parameters. Thanks to the natural excitation exerted by the gas flow on the rotor {{it is possible to}} avoid the use of any external device to perform the identification. The vibration signals have been recorded over proper measurement time windows with the compressor at steady state.

The LSCF models the frequency response function (FRF) obtained from a vibration test using a matrix-fraction description and obtains the coefficients of the common denominator polynomial by minimizing the least squares error of the fit between the FRF and the model. System frequency and damping information is obtained from {{the roots of the}} denominator; a stabilization diagram is used to separate physical from mathematical poles. The LSCF estimator is known for its good performance when separating closely spaced modes, but few quantitative analyses have focused on the sensitivity of the identification with respect to mode concentration. In this study, the LSCF estimator is applied on both computational and experimental forced responses of an embedded compressor rotor in a three-stage axial research compressor. the LSCF estimator is first applied to computational FRF data obtained from a mistuned first-torsion (1 T) forced response prediction using FMM (Fundamental Mistuning Model) and is shown to be able to identify the eigenvalues with high accuracy. Then the first chordwise bending (1 CWB) computational FRF data is considered with varied mode concentration by varying the mistuning standard deviation. These cases are analyzed using LSCF and a sensitivity algorithm is developed to evaluate the influence of the mode spacing on eigenvalue identification. Finally, the experimental FRF data from this rotor blisk is analyzed using the LSCF estimator.

40|$|The unmitigated {{transmission}} of undesirable vibration {{can result in}} problems by way of causing human discomfort, machinery and equipment failure, and affecting {{the quality of a}} manufacturing process. When identifiable transmission paths are discernible, vibrations from the source can be isolated {{from the rest of the}} system and this prevents or minimises the problems. The approach proposed here for vibration isolation is active force cancellation at points close to the vibration source. It uses force feedback for multiple-input and multiple-output control at the mounting locations. This is particularly attractive for rigid mounting of machine on relative flexible base where machine alignment and motions are to be restricted. The force transfer function matrix is used as a disturbance rejection performance specification for the design of MIMO controllers. For machine soft-mounted via flexible isolators, a model for this matrix has been derived. Under certain conditions, a simple multiplicative uncertainty model is obtained that shows the amount of perturbation a flexible base has on the machine-isolator-rigid base transmissibility matrix. Such a model is very suitable for use with robust control design paradigm. A different model is derived for the machine on hard-mounts without the flexible isolators. With this model, the level of force transmitted from a machine to a final mounting structure using the measurements for the machine running on another mounting structure can be determined. The two mounting structures have dissimilar dynamic characteristics. Experiments have verified the usefulness of the expression. The model compares well with other methods in the literature. The disadvantage lies with the large amount of data that has to be collected. Active force cancellation is demonstrated on an experimental rig using an AC industrial motor hard-mounted onto a relative flexible structure. The force transfer function matrix, determined from measurements, is used to design H and Static Output Feedback controllers. Both types of controllers are stable and robust to modelling errors within <b>the</b> <b>identified</b> <b>frequency</b> range. They reduce the RMS of transmitted force by between 30 ? 80 % at all mounting locations for machine running at 1340 rpm. At the rated speed of 1440 rpm only the static gain controller is able to provide 30 ? 55 % reduction at all locations. The H controllers on the other hand could only give a small reduction at one mount location. This is due in part to the deficient of the model used in the design. Higher frequency dynamics has been ignored in the model. This can be resolved by the use of a higher order model that can result in a high order controller. A low order static gain controller, with some tuning, performs better. But it lacks the analytical framework for analysis and design...|$|E
40|$|Manufactured products, such as furniture, {{laminate}} flooring, {{and large}} signs, are very labour intensive, time-consuming, and costly to produce as they require multiple coating and cutting operations {{on a series}} of independent machines, which can each introduce manufacturing errors between the tools and the work piece. By combining the processes of printing and milling, printing integrated manufacturing has the potential to eliminate some of these steps, significantly reduce errors, and preserve resources. Inkjet printing is an ideal method for both image transfer and coating operations due to its non-contact method of directly depositing various types of fluid onto a substrate. With improved positioning accuracy and droplet miniaturisation, inkjet printing could even be used for future applications like the mass-production of MEMS devices, which are traditionally fabricated with a highly complex process involving photolithography. 	This thesis presents the integration of a Xaar 126 inkjet printing system with an existing industrial flatbed CNC router to develop a combined printing and cutting system. This integration required modification to the overall system through mechanical, electrical, and software means to the existing 3 -axis CNC milling system. A secondary z-axis was installed onto the router gantry for positioning of the printheads relative to the substrate, which required development of a separate homing routine to consistently position the printheads to a specified location. Based on <b>the</b> <b>identified</b> <b>frequency</b> response of the machine, a loop-shaping controller was designed for improved y-axis positioning, {{which is one of the}} main contributions to droplet placement accuracy. This resulted in a continuous motion tracking accuracy within ± 20. 2 µm at 250 mm/sec along a print pass (measured by 1. 22 nm resolution linear encoder), which is significantly better than the industrial benchmark of ± 100 µm. 	Extensive image processing and calibration methods were utilised on various substrate preparations of paper, wood, and coatings, to demonstrate the capability of the printing system and quantify the quality of print resolution. Calibration results tested on high-gloss Hewlett-Packard paper showed that the swath angle could be aligned within ± 1 °. Also, bidirectional printing could be used to reduce print time by at least 15 % in multi-colour printing with comparable droplet placement accuracy to unidirectional printing. The inkjet system was successfully used to print custom designs on paper and, to a certain extent, on medium density fibreboard at a feed rate of 250 mm/sec. It was difficult to achieve satisfactory image results on wood, as the wood or paint grain was visible through the ink. Thus, without a white pre-coat, the printed image would appear significantly darker than the original image, even after adjusting the image in a graphics editor. For better quality results, it is recommended that greyscale printheads be implemented for greater resolution and a UV system should be investigated for more versatility in printing on different substrates such as glass, metals, plastics, and ceramics...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The sound radiated during a tennis impact {{has been shown to}} greatly influence the perception of ‘feel’ but has also been suggested to contribute to the perception of equipment quality, {{as is the case with}} many other consumer products. In an industry that is governed by design limitations, tennis racket manufactures are continually aiming to differentiate their products from their competitors’ and the sound character of a racket is seen as one such method to do so. In order to control the sound radiated from a tennis racket it was first necessary to identify how a tennis racket radiates sound. Through a number of controlled player tests, involving groundstrokes and serves, the sound was recorded along with measurements of the physical vibrations excited in the frame. Analysis of the data revealed typical characteristics of the sound in the time and frequency domain. The sound was split into two sections to aid the analysis; an initial impulsive component that decayed very quickly and a ringing component that was of much lower amplitude but decayed at a much slower rate. The evolution of the frequency content over time was also investigated, however, the data provided much more information as to where each frequency component originated by analysing the data together with the experimental modal analysis data. The experimental modal analysis of a tennis racket was a vital stage in understanding which components of the racket were responsible for radiating <b>the</b> <b>identified</b> <b>frequency</b> component in the sound spectrum. The investigations identified frame bending modes, out-of-plane and inplane, as well as torsional modes, hoop modes and stringbed modes. To enable direct comparison between the natural frequencies excited during a tennis shot and the frequencies recorded from a freely suspended racket, the effect of the hand on the modal behaviour of the racket was analysed; experimental modal analysis data from a hand-gripped racket was compared with data generated by adding simulated mass to the modal model of the freely suspended racket. The first stringbed mode was identified as a key contributor to the sound of the racket, especially in the ringing component of the sound. Analysis of the physical vibrations in the frame following a tennis shot revealed that the first stringbed mode excited the frame of the racket, which is iv thought to be the reason why stringbed modes contribute to the sound more so than their surface area would suggest that they are capable of. Analysis of the relationship between subjective perceptions of players and calculated sound metrics suggest a negative correlation exists between the duration and loudness of a tennis shot and the appeal of the sound. Further investigations involving a jury to evaluate the appeal of a tennis impact sound, modified in terms of duration, revealed further evidence to support the theory that tennis impact sounds of greater duration are less appealing than those that decay quickly. This is the first study to investigate the sound radiated from a tennis racket and has identified how the sound is radiated from the racket and also suggests which parameters of the sound are considered appealing to tennis players. With this information it is possible to suggest design modifications that would influence the sound of a tennis racket in a predictable manner...|$|E

40|$|Although human {{sustained}} control {{movements are}} continuous in nature {{there is still}} controversy on the mechanisms underlying such physiological systems. A popular topic of debate is whether human motor control mechanisms could be modelled as engineering control systems, and if so, what control algorithm is most appropriate. Since {{the early years of}} modelling sustained control tasks in human motor control the servomechanism has been an adequate model to describe human tracking tasks. Another continuous-time system model that is often used to model sustained control tasks is the predictive controller which is based on internal models and includes prediction and optimisation. On the other hand, studies have suggested intermittent behaviour of the "human controller" in sustained motor control tasks. This thesis investigated whether intermittent control is a suitable approach to describe sustained human motor control. It was investigated how well an intermittent control system model could approximate both the deterministic and non-deterministic parts of experimental data, from a visual-manual compensatory tracking task. Finally, a preliminary study was conducted to explore issues associated with the practical implementation of the intermittent control model. To fit the deterministic part of experimental data, a frequency domain identification method was used. Identification results obtained with an intermittent controller were compared against the results using continuous-time non-predictive and predictive controllers. The results show that <b>the</b> <b>identified</b> <b>frequency</b> response functions of the intermittent control model not only fit the frequency response functions derived from the experimental data well, but most importantly resulted in identified controller parameters which are similar to those identified using a predictive controller, and whose parameter values appear to be physiologically meaningful. A novel way to explain human variability, as represented by the non-deterministic part of the experimental data (the remnant), was developed, based on an intermittent control model with variable intermittent interval. This model was compared against the established paradigm, in which variability is explained by a predictive controller with added noise, either signal dependent control signal noise, or observation noise. The study has shown that the intermittent controller with a variable intermittent interval could model the non-deterministic experimental data as well as the predictive controller model with added noise. This provides a new explanation for the source of remnant in human control as inherent to the controller structure, rather than as a noise signal, and enables a new interpretation for the physiological basis for human variability. Finally, the theoretical intermittent control model was implemented in real-time {{in the context of the}} physiological control mechanism of human standing balance. An experimental method was developed to apply automatic artificial balance of an inverted pendulum in the context of human standing, via functions electrical stimulation control of the lower leg muscles of a healthy subject. The significance of this study is, firstly, that frequency domain identification was applied for the first time with intermittent control, and it could be shown that both intermittent and predictive control models can model deterministic experimental data from manual tracking tasks equally well. Secondly, for the first time the inherent variability, which is represented by the remnant signal, in human motor control tasks could be modelled as part of the structure of the intermittent controller rather than as an added noise model. Although, the experimental method to apply automatic artificial balance of an inverted pendulum in the context of human standing was not successful, the intermittent controller was implemented for the first time in real-time and combined with electrical muscle stimulation to control a physiological mechanism...|$|E
40|$|The {{hard disk}} drive (HDD) {{industry}} strives for higher storage densities and capacities. The critical factor {{for the performance of}} HDDs in this regard is the track mis-registration (TMR) which is the statistical number to indicate the performance of track-following control. After traditional track-following servo control, several visible frequency components remain in the spectrum of non-repeatable position error signal (PES). The dominant ones among these frequency components are a main contributor to the TMR. The rejection of these dominant components via servo control is difficult {{due to the fact that}} the frequency of the dominant component is not exactly known. This dissertation introduces several adaptive control schemes to reject the dominant frequency component (narrow band disturbance with the largest magnitude) to reduce TMR for higher achievable areal density of HDDs. A natural approach to narrow band disturbance rejection is indirect adaptive control, which involves two steps both performed in real time. At the first step, the frequency of the dominant component is estimated. Two frequency estimation methods are investigated in this dissertation. The discrete Fourier transform (DFT) method results in fast and accurate frequency estimation, but its large computational amount makes it an impratical approach for on-line identification. The least mean squares (LMS) algorithm is a computationally simple method for frequency identification. Carefully choosing the step size profile, the frequency estimate converges within one revolution and the resulting bias is small. The second step of the indirect adaptive control is to apply an add-on compensator based on the frequency estimate to reject the dominant component. Two choices for the add-on compensator are discussed in this dissertation. One is to identify the magnitude and phase of the dominant component. With <b>the</b> <b>identified</b> <b>frequency,</b> magnitude and phase, an estimate of the dominant component is constructed and then canceled by the control signal. This scheme is further extended to rejecting multiple frequency components. Another proposed compensator adopts the structure of a disturbance observer (DOB). The Q filter in DOB is selected to be a narrow band-pass filter centered at the estimated frequency. A deep notch in the error rejection function is introduced by the DOB with such a Q filter to reject the dominant component. Two direct adaptive control schemes, which adapt compensator parameters directly, are also applied to compensate for the dominant component. One scheme applies a finite-impulse-response (FIR) Q filter built around the baseline servo controller to reject the dominant component based on Youla-Kucera parameterization. The coefficients of the Q filter are updated in such a way that the resulting controller incorporates the internal model of the narrow-band disturbance. To make the scheme suited for HDD systems, two modifications are proposed: 1) adding a pre-specified term to the Q filter to avoid large transient oscillation, and 2) cascading a bandpass filter to the Q filter to deal with inaccurate HDD plant model as well as to limit the waterbed effect to a certain frequency range. Another direct adaptive controller adopts the disturbance observer (DOB) loop with a narrow bandpass Q filter. The frequency parameter of the Q filter is directly adapted to the optimal value in the sense of minimizing the track-following TMR. Realistic simulation tools are used to show that all adaptive control schemes described in this dissertation are effective in terms of rejecting narrow band disturbances to achieve smaller TMR. The advantages and disadvantages of each scheme are also discussed...|$|E

For instance, the damping ratio of <b>the</b> YN-GZ mode <b>identified</b> from tie-line YM is roughly half of <b>the</b> damping ratios <b>identified</b> from other tie-lines. Similar phenomenon {{can be found in}} the results obtained by N 4 SID and Prony. This fact prevents system operators from monitoring system dynamic stability accurately.|$|R

SDSS J 034917. 41 - 005917. 9 is therefore a member of the GW Vir class of pulsating pre-white dwarfs. We have identified 10 independent pulsation frequencies that can be fitted by an asymptotic model with a constant period spacing of 23. 61 +/- 0. 21 s, presumably associated with a sequence of l = 1 modes. The highest amplitude peak in the suite of frequencies shows evidence for a triplet structure, with a frequency separation of 14. 4 microHz. Five of <b>the</b> <b>identified</b> <b>frequencies</b> do not fit the l = 1 sequence, but are, however, well-modeled by an independent asymptotic sequence with a constant period spacing of 11. 66 +/- 0. 13 s. It is unclear to which l mode these frequencies belong. Comment: Accepted for publication in MNRAS; 5 pages, 6 figures and 4 table...|$|R
40|$|Since {{its first}} {{application}} to structural vibration {{in the late}} 1970 ’s, the autoregressive moving average (ARMA) model has been {{considered one of the}} most appropriate mathematical models for dynamic modeling of structures. This paper presents the development of a multivariable autoregressive (AR) model along with a critical assessment of its application for structural modal analysis. The model parameters are estimated using QR factorization which is fast and provides a conditioned estimate. This model is very effective for the identification of modal parameters in cases of ambient responses when carrying out modern modal analysis using only output data. A system with two degrees of freedom (2 DOF) is presented and the model is assessed by evaluating the following criteria; accuracy of <b>the</b> <b>identified</b> <b>frequencies,</b> damping ratio and mode shape of each mode at different noise-to-signal ratios and model orders. As a further evaluation the method is applied to dynamic testing data from a steel plate and found to be in close agreement with results of finite element analysis. 1...|$|R

40|$|For cable bridges, {{the cable}} tension force plays {{a crucial role}} in their construction, {{assessment}} and long-term structural health monitoring. Cable tension forces vary in real time with the change of the moving vehicle loads and environmental effects, and this continual variation in tension force may cause fatigue damage of a cable. Traditional vibration-based cable tension force estimation methods can only obtain the time-averaged cable tension force and not the instantaneous force. This paper proposes a new approach to <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> time-varying cable tension forces of bridges based on an adaptive sparse time-frequency analysis method. This is a recently developed method to estimate the instantaneous frequency by looking for the sparsest time-frequency representation of the signal within the largest possible time-frequency dictionary (i. e. set of expansion functions). In the proposed approach, first, the time-varying modal <b>frequencies</b> are <b>identified</b> from acceleration measurements on the cable, then, the time-varying cable tension is obtained from the relation between this force and <b>the</b> <b>identified</b> <b>frequencies.</b> By considering <b>the</b> integer ratios of the different modal frequencies to the fundamental frequency of the cable, the proposed algorithm is further improved to increase its robustness to measurement noise. A cable experiment is implemented to illustrate the validity of the proposed method. For comparison, the Hilbert–Huang transform is also employed to <b>identify</b> <b>the</b> time-varying <b>frequencies,</b> which are then used to calculate the time-varying cable-tension force. The results show that the adaptive sparse time-frequency analysis method produces more accurate estimates of the time-varying cable tension forces than the Hilbert–Huang transform method...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} initial {{results of}} Generalized Compressed Network Search (GCNS), {{a method for}} automatically <b>identifying</b> <b>the</b> important <b>frequencies</b> for neural networks encoded as Fourier-type coefficients (i. e. “compressed ” networks [7]). GCNS is a general search procedure in this coefficient space – both the number of frequencies and their value are automatically determined by employing the use of variable-length chromosomes, inspired by messy genetic algorithms. The method achieves better compression than our previous approach, and promises improved generalization for evolved controllers. Results for a high-dimensional Octopus arm control problem show that a high fitness 3680 -weight network can be encoded using less than 10 coefficients using <b>the</b> <b>frequencies</b> <b>identified</b> by GCNS. ...|$|R
30|$|In this study, {{we chose}} an {{approach}} with semiautomatic identification of UHR frequency {{by the computer}} and a human operator. First, we applied an algorithm for identification of the UHR frequency to the HFA spectrogram data. The algorithm was developed not to <b>identify</b> UHR <b>frequency</b> in all cases but to identify it in easy cases. Then, a human operator checked the identifications made by the computer and corrected them if needed. A similar approach was also used by Kurth et al. (2015) to <b>identify</b> UHR <b>frequency</b> in spectrograms obtained by the Van Allen Probe. They also mentioned that inspections and corrections by a human operator were necessary. They used an algorithm called AURA (automated upper hybrid resonance detection algorithm), which <b>identifies</b> <b>the</b> UHR <b>frequency</b> {{at the peak of}} the spectrum weighted by a Gaussian function whose peak is at <b>the</b> previously <b>identified</b> UHR <b>frequency.</b> Although <b>the</b> algorithm is quite simple, and seems sufficiently effective, we used another step-by-step algorithm so that we could arrange multiple criteria and parameters manually to improve UHR identification.|$|R
