5|$|Abantiades latipennis {{is one of}} {{fourteen}} species currently identified within the genus Abantiades, {{all of which are}} found exclusively in Australia. <b>The</b> <b>species</b> was first described in 1932 by Norman Tindale, an Australian entomologist and anthropologist. Tindale described <b>the</b> <b>species,</b> under its current name, but provided no etymology for the specific epithet latipennis. He based <b>the</b> <b>species</b> description on specimens from Lorne (including the holotype male and allotype female), Pomonal and Mount Mistake (in the Langi Ghiran State Park), Victoria, and from Zeehan, Eaglehawk Neck and Launceston, Tasmania.|$|E
5|$|Aloe vera {{has been}} widely grown as an {{ornamental}} plant. <b>The</b> <b>species</b> is popular with modern gardeners as a putatively medicinal plant and for its interesting flowers, form, and succulence. This succulence enables <b>the</b> <b>species</b> to survive in areas of low natural rainfall, making it ideal for rockeries and other low water-use gardens. <b>The</b> <b>species</b> is hardy in zones 8–11, and is intolerant of heavy frost and snow. <b>The</b> <b>species</b> is relatively resistant to most insect pests, though spider mites, mealy bugs, scale insects, and aphid species may cause a decline in plant health. This plant has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.|$|E
5|$|Apart from {{underwater}} ecosystem, Weh {{island is}} the only habitat of one threatened species of toad, Duttaphrynus valhallae (formerly Bufo valhallae). <b>The</b> <b>species</b> is only known from the holotype from the island. Due to heavy forestation on the island, the survival of <b>the</b> <b>species</b> is uncertain.|$|E
30|$|The {{relationship}} between <b>the</b> two <b>species</b> is commensalism, i.e., <b>the</b> second <b>species</b> has {{positive effect on}} <b>the</b> first <b>species,</b> while <b>the</b> first <b>species</b> has no influence on <b>the</b> second <b>species,</b> we describe such of relationship by using the bilinear function a_ 12 xy.|$|R

5|$|Arctic terns are {{considered}} threatened or {{a species of}} concern in certain states. They are also among <b>the</b> <b>species</b> to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds applies. <b>The</b> <b>species</b> reduced population in New England in the late nineteenth-century because of hunting for the millinery trade.

5|$|Brown {{published}} a formal description and name for <b>the</b> <b>species</b> in his 1810 On the Proteaceae of Jussieu. He did not designate a type specimen (a specimen to {{be representative of}} <b>the</b> <b>species)</b> for <b>the</b> <b>species,</b> but the one specimen in his collection has since been formally declared the lectotype for <b>the</b> <b>species.</b> He also did not state the etymology of the specific epithet, but it is accepted that the name derives from the Ancient Greek sphaera- ("round"), and carpos ("fruit"), {{in reference to the}} shape of its infructescences.|$|E

5|$|During the Cold War, the Warsaw Pact {{countries}} {{launched a}} widespread {{war against the}} potato beetle, blaming the introduction of <b>the</b> <b>species</b> from America on the CIA, demonising <b>the</b> <b>species</b> in propaganda posters, and urging children to gather the beetles and kill them.|$|E
5|$|First {{described}} in 1829, <b>the</b> <b>species</b> {{has long been}} prized as a table fish and is commonly sought by both recreational and commercial fishermen in New South Wales and Queensland. The sand whiting fishery is most prolific in southern Queensland and northern New South Wales where <b>the</b> <b>species</b> is most abundant, often caught along other species of whiting in estuaries and from beaches. Due to its importance as a commercial fish, substantial research {{has been carried out}} on <b>the</b> <b>species,</b> especially feasibility studies involving the use of sand whiting in aquaculture.|$|E
5|$|Inocybe saliceticola {{grows in}} {{mycorrhizal}} association with willow trees, {{and it is}} for this that <b>the</b> <b>species</b> is named. However, particular species favoured by the fungus are unclear and may include beech and alder taxa. The mushrooms grow from the ground, often among mosses or detritus. I.saliceticola was first described in 2009, and within the genus Inocybe, <b>the</b> <b>species</b> {{is a part of the}} section Marginatae. <b>The</b> <b>species</b> has been recorded in Finland and Sweden and is relatively common in some areas.|$|E
40|$|Interaction of methanol, ethanol, and 2 -propanol with {{polycrystalline}} {{as well as}} (0001) {{surfaces of}} Zn has been investigated by photoelectron spectroscopy and vibrational energy loss spectroscopy. All the alcohols show evidence for <b>the</b> condensed <b>species</b> along with <b>the</b> chemisorbed <b>species</b> at 80 K. With increase in temperature to similar to 120 K, <b>the</b> condensed <b>species</b> desorbs, leaving <b>the</b> chemisorbed <b>species</b> which decomposes to give <b>the</b> alkoxy <b>species.</b> <b>The</b> alkoxy <b>species</b> is produced increasingly at lower temperatures as we go from methanol to 2 -propanol, <b>the</b> 2 -propoxy <b>species</b> occurring even at 80 K. <b>The</b> alkoxy <b>species</b> undergo C-O bond scission giving rise to a hydrocarbon <b>species</b> and oxygen. <b>The</b> C-O bond cleavage occurs at a relatively low temperature of similar to 150 K. The effect of preadsorbed oxygen is to stabilize <b>the</b> methoxy <b>species</b> and prevent C-O bond scission. On the other hand, coadsorption of oxygen with methanol favors the formation of <b>the</b> methoxy <b>species</b> and gives rise to hydrocarbon <b>species</b> arising from <b>the</b> C-O bond scission even at 80 K...|$|R
50|$|In other situations, <b>the</b> {{undesired}} <b>species</b> is more shade tolerant than <b>the</b> desired <b>species.</b> In this case, foresters will {{forgo the}} preparatory cut (which might invite early germination of the undesired shade-tolerant) and perform a heavier than normal establishment cut, giving <b>the</b> desired <b>species</b> enough resources {{to establish and}} outgrow <b>the</b> undesired <b>species.</b> <b>The</b> (partial) overstory removal quickly follows, continuing to give <b>the</b> desired <b>species</b> <b>the</b> resources to outgrow its competitor. In the example below, the very shade tolerant balsam fir established in an earlier harvest, and is preventing the establishment of moderately shade tolerant eastern white pine.|$|R

Both Galorrheus vietus and Lactifluus vietus are now considered obligate synonyms (different names for the same species based on one type) of Lactarius vietus. The specific epithet is from the Latin , meaning shrunken. It is commonly known as the grey milkcap.|$|E
5|$|N. menagensis {{is listed}} in CITES Appendix I, which {{prevents}} international commercial trade; it is also protected by Indonesian law. <b>The</b> <b>species</b> is often confused with other slow lorises in animal rescue centers, as it is not well-covered in field guides. <b>The</b> <b>species</b> occurs {{in a number of}} protected areas throughout its range, including some fragmented forests. Threats to <b>the</b> <b>species</b> include the illegal local exotic pet trade and habitat loss due to burning and conversion to palm oil plantations. Additionally, uncontrolled release of pets in some areas is also a threat to <b>the</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E
