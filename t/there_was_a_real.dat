5|$|Given {{its subject}} matter, the episode {{features}} many references to witchcraft and occultism. The nurse from the episode, Rebecca Waite, was originally {{named after a}} friend of the writers called Rebecca White. However, this was changed because <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> nurse from Chicago whose last name was White. Some viewers ended up believing that Waite's name as a reference to either Rebecca Nurse, an innocent woman prosecuted during the Salem witch trials, or the Rider-Waite tarot deck, the most popular tarot deck utilized in the world. The episode itself directly references Gerald Gardner, a wiccan known for publishing several books on witchcraft and founder of the Gardnerian Tradition. While the Mayhew sisters tried to depict occultism without offending anybody by not connecting Franklin or Waite to any known cult, many Wiccans sent angry letters and e-mails to Fox regarding the portrayal of their beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Mark Webster, {{an expert}} {{instructed}} by Bamber's defence team, argued that Hayward's tests had been inadequate, and that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> possibility, not a remote one, {{that the blood}} had come from Nevill and June. This was a critical point, because the prosecution case rested on the silencer having been on the gun when Sheila was shot, something {{she could not have}} done herself because of the length of her arms. If she was shot with the silencer on the gun, it meant that someone else had shot her. If her blood was inside the silencer, it supported the prosecution's position that she had been shot by another party, but if the blood inside the silencer belonged to someone else, that part of the prosecution case collapsed.|$|E
5|$|One change {{made during}} {{production}} was augmented pitch control to avoid deep stall conditions at high angles of attack. The stall issue {{had been raised}} during development, but had originally been discounted. Model tests of the YF-16 conducted by the Langley Research Center revealed a potential problem, but no other laboratory was able to duplicate it. YF-16 flight tests were not sufficient to expose the issue; later flight testing on the FSD aircraft demonstrated <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> concern. In response, {{the areas of the}} horizontal stabilizer were increased 25% on the Block 15 aircraft in 1981 and later retrofitted to earlier aircraft. In addition, a manual override switch to disable the horizontal stabilizer flight limiter was prominently placed on the control console, allowing the pilot to regain control of the horizontal stabilizers (which the flight limiters otherwise lock in place) and recover. Besides reducing the risk of deep stalls, the larger horizontal tail also improved stability and permitted faster takeoff rotation.|$|E

25|$|New York was {{the largest}} state in the union, and victory <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> possibility. Catt agreed to turn the New York work over to others and to accept the NAWSA {{presidency}} in December, 1915 {{on the condition that}} she could name her own executive board, which previously had always been elected by the annual convention. She appointed to the board women of independent means who could work for the movement full-time.|$|E
25|$|In early June 1913, around seven {{thousand}} rifles being stored by Crawford in a disused inn in Hammersmith were seized by police. The inn was being rented out to Crawford by a brother-in-law of staunch Unionist Sir William Bull, 1st Baronet. One week later, Crawford openly transported weapons to Belfast from several locations across England, which were intercepted by customs officials, {{with the intention}} of forcing the government to accept that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> risk of armed resistance to Home Rule in Ulster.|$|E

25|$|Expected to {{challenge}} for the title the next year, the now traditional slow start to the season had left Blackburn off the pace, behind the previous years champions Whitley Warriors and the runaway leaders Billingham Stars. However boosted by the signing of Finnish import Sami Narkia, the Hawks finished with an impressive run of results, and although the gap {{at the top of}} the league would prove just out of reach, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> belief that the squad was now capable of winning the playoffs.|$|E
25|$|The {{price of}} land was the {{dominant}} election issue: The business strategy of the Canterbury Association was to sell land at a price that was sufficient to finance all the development that was necessary for the new settlement. The other two candidates, James FitzGerald and Henry Tancred, were therefore both proponents of a high land price. Campbell {{on the other hand}} was in favour of setting a low price for land outside the Canterbury Block. Hence <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> possibility that vote splitting would result in neither Tancred nor FitzGerald being elected.|$|E
25|$|If an adjudicator has a pecuniary or {{monetary}} {{interest in}} the matter {{he or she is}} presiding over, no matter how small it is, he or she is automatically disqualified from making the decision. The decision, if made, may be set aside. Thus, in Dimes v. Grand Junction Canal Proprietors (1852), the House of Lords held that the Lord Chancellor, who was a shareholder of one of the companies that was a party to certain legal proceedings he was presiding over, was disqualified from hearing the case. His ruling had to be annulled. This was not because <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> possibility of bias, but because the situation created a possibility that a reasonable person might suspect the existence of bias, which would taint the fairness of the proceedings.|$|E

25|$|In 1930, Don Azpiazú had {{the first}} million-selling record of Cuban music: The Peanut Vendor (El Manisero), with Antonio Machín as the singer. This number had been orchestrated and {{included}} in N.Y. theatre by Azpiazú before recording, which no doubt helped with the publicity. The Lecuona Cuban Boys became the best-known Cuban touring ensemble: {{they were the ones}} who first used the conga drum in their conjunto, and popularized the conga as a dance. Xavier Cugat at the Waldorf Astoria was highly influential. In 1941 Desi Arnaz popularized the comparsa drum (similar to the conga) in the U.S with his performances of Babalú. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> 'rumba craze' at the time. Later, Mario Bauza and Machito set up in New York and Miguelito Valdés also arrived there.|$|E
25|$|Following the 2008/09 season, Conor Henry was {{replaced}} by former Sydney Spirit head coach Rob Beveridge. However, in May 2009, the Wildcats came within weeks of folding unless they raised {{a million dollars in}} sponsorship. The NBL itself was also in strife; with the competition falling on tough times, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> possibility at the time {{that there would be no}} league in 2009/10. The Wildcats eventually received backing from property developer Diploma Group, while the NBL made significant changes to the competition. One of Basketball Australia's moves for the 2009/10 season was to return the NBL game to a 40-minute format from the 48-minutes it adopted in 1984, ostensibly to accommodate the international game. This was done to bring Australia back in step with the rest of the world (outside the NBA) and to be more attractive to television as a package because a 40-minute game slots well into a two-hour timeslot.|$|E
25|$|On June 26, 1939, the Royal Navy and the Foreign Office {{reported}} to the British Cabinet {{that the only way}} of ending the blockade was to send the main British battle fleet to Far Eastern waters, and the current crisis with Nazi Germany threatening Poland made it militarily unadvisable. If the bulk of the Royal Navy was sent to Singapore, Britain {{would not be able to}} impose a blockade on Germany should the Reich invade Poland, and as such one of Britain's main deterrents against Adolf Hitler invading Poland would be removed, something that would encourage Hitler to choose war. In addition, Chamberlain faced strong pressure from the French not to weaken British naval strength in the Mediterranean given the danger that Benito Mussolini might honor the Pact of Steel should war break out in Europe. The Pact of Steel signed in Rome in May 1939 was an offensive-defensive German-Italian alliance, which meant <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> possibility that if war with Germany began, Italy would join in.|$|E

500|$|Daladier, the French Prime Minister, {{told the}} US {{ambassador}} to France that [...] "he hoped to {{live long enough}} to pay Poland for her cormorant attitude in the present crisis by proposing a new partition." [...] The Soviet Union was so hostile to Poland over Munich that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> prospect that war between the two states might break out quite separate from the wider conflict over Czechoslovakia. The Soviet Prime Minister, Molotov, denounced the Poles as [...] "Hitler's jackals".|$|E
500|$|When this failed, {{it seems}} Sejanus turned his {{attention}} toward eliminating Drusus. By AD 23 the enmity {{between the two men}} had reached a critical point. During an argument Drusus had struck the prefect with his fist, and he openly lamented that [...] "a stranger was invited to assist in the government while the emperor's son was alive". With Tiberius already in his sixties, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> possibility of Drusus succeeding his father in the near future. To secure his position, Sejanus secretly plotted against Drusus and seduced his wife Livilla. With her as an accomplice, Drusus was slowly poisoned and died of seemingly natural causes on September 13, AD 23.|$|E
500|$|The Hungarian Revolution of 1956 {{produced}} a powerful echo within the city; <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>real</b> possibility that demonstrations by students sympathizing {{with their peers}} across the border could escalate into an uprising. The protests provided the Romanian authorities with a pretext {{to speed up the}} process of [...] "unification" [...] of the local Babeș (Romanian) and Bolyai (Hungarian) universities, allegedly contemplated before the 1956 events. Hungarians remained the majority of the city's population until the 1960s. [...] Then Romanians began to outnumber Hungarians, due to the population increase {{as a result of the}} government's forced industrialisation of the city and new jobs. During the Communist period, the city recorded a high industrial development, as well as enforced construction expansion. On 16 October 1974, when the city celebrated 1850 years since its first mention as Napoca, the Communist government changed the name of the city by adding [...] "Napoca" [...] to it.|$|E
