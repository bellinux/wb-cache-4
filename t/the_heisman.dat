He was voted by his {{teammates}} as Ohio State's Most Valuable Player. He also won <b>the</b> <b>Heisman</b> Trophy, an award given each year to the best college football player in the country. Horvath was the first Ohio State player to win <b>the</b> <b>Heisman,</b> and he remains the only Heisman winner not to have played football the previous season. In early 1945, Horvath played in the annual East–West Shrine Game, a college all-star game. While at Ohio State, {{he was a member}} of Delta Tau Delta fraternity.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} balloting, the fifty {{states of the}} U.S. are split into six regions (Far West, Mid Atlantic, Mid West, North East, South, South West), and six {{regional}} representatives are selected to appoint voters in their states. Each region has 145 media votes, {{for a total of}} 870 votes. In addition, all previous Heisman winners may vote, and one final vote is counted through public balloting. <b>The</b> <b>Heisman</b> ballots contain a 3-2-1 point system, in which each ballot ranks the voter's top three players and awards them three points for a first-place vote, two points for a second-place vote, and one point for a third-place vote. The points are tabulated, and the player with the highest total of points across all ballots wins <b>the</b> <b>Heisman</b> Trophy.|$|E
5|$|Media {{attention}} was also {{directed at the}} teams' offensive capabilities. Boston College quarterback Matt Ryan was named the Atlantic Coast Conference Player of the Year in the week {{leading up to the}} game. In {{the first half of the}} 2007 season, Ryan had been prominently mentioned in candidate lists for <b>the</b> <b>Heisman</b> Trophy, college football's highest individual award. Although Ryan's late-game comeback in their previous game against Virginia Tech had made him a front-runner, the team's two subsequent losses to unranked teams dropped him from contention for <b>the</b> <b>Heisman.</b> Excellent performances in a division-clinching win at Clemson and against Miami seemed to return Ryan to Heisman-candidate form, however, and heading into the ACC Championship Game, Ryan appeared to be the biggest offensive threat for Boston College.|$|E
