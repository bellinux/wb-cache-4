40|$|Pile {{foundations}} {{are used}} extensively {{around the world}} to support both inland and offshore structures, including important structures such as nuclear plants and oil drilling platforms. Pile foundations are known to resist higher compression and uplift loading as compared to shallow foundations. The common factor in resisting the compression and the tensile loading is the friction, which takes place between <b>the</b> <b>pile</b> and <b>the</b> soil. <b>Pile</b> foundations can be categorized as bored and driven piles. Bored piles installed in sand are known to provide relatively low capacity as compared to driven <b>piles</b> under <b>the</b> same condition. This is due the effect of <b>the</b> <b>pile</b> driving process. <b>The</b> estimation of the shaft resistance of driven piles remains empirical at best. The changes in the in situ stress levels as a result of pile installation are quite often overestimated/underestimated leading to unsafe/uneconomic design of the foundations. The objective {{of this study is to}} examine the changes in the in situ stresses during <b>the</b> <b>pile</b> driving process, and accordingly to predict <b>the</b> <b>pile</b> capacity. In order to achieve these objectives, numerical model is developed to simulate <b>the</b> process of <b>pile</b> installation and link the cavity expansion to <b>the</b> <b>pile</b> installation and pile diameter.

40|$|Since 1986, I {{have been}} {{pursuing}} my passionate interest in handwoven velvet, both practically and academically. By velvet, I mean extra-warp pile, rather than weft-woven types of pile, such as weft-looping or knotting. Simple, monochrome plain velvets have been woven {{since the early}} Coptic period, requiring only simple looms and two simple warp tensioning systems, one for the foundation cloth and another for <b>the</b> <b>pile</b> warp. 1 (On the basis of such a simple set-up, early velvet figuration could be created through the following colour effects using: (a) striped pile warp; (b) ikat/chiné (spaced dyed) pile warp; (c) painted or printed pile warp; (d) 2 striped warps mounted counterchange style (e. g. DLDLDL/LDLDLD); or (e) 2 contrasting warps, motifs picked up by hand or held {{on a set of}} half-heddle rods. Simple textural effects include: (a) alternating stripes or bands of velvet (cut and/or uncut) and flat cloth; and (b) bands of differing heights of pile (cut or uncut). All of the above variations can be created using simple looms with as few as three or four shafts. 2 For example, the elaborate figuration of Uzbeki velvet ikats is provided by the ikat dyed patterning of <b>the</b> <b>pile</b> warp, which is then woven as a “solid” velvet, whose <b>pile</b> uniformly covers <b>the</b> whole fabric surface. 3 This velvet can be woven on a 4 shaft counter-balanced loom with both foundation warp and pile warp separately tensioned with “live” or gravity weighting provided by bags of bricks. Solid velvet pile warps can also be mounted on a single warp beam with uniform tension because all <b>the</b> <b>pile</b> warps are taken up identically. Examples of chequered patterning in silk velvets date back at least to the 11 th century. 4 Simple counterchange chequered designs can be woven with a minimum of two <b>pile</b> <b>shafts</b> and two <b>pile</b> warps, one of each of two contrasting colours. The two contrasting colours, let us say L 2 ̆ 6 D, can also be wound together as a pair and mounted as a single pile warp in which the two colours alternate. A 4 -shaft loom is sufficient for such patterns. To create the chequered pattern, <b>the</b> <b>pile</b> <b>shafts</b> 3 and 4 are ordered in blocks as follows: 3 rd shaft – LDLDLD… DLDLDL… 4 th shaft – DLDLDL… LDLDLD… Although the loom mounting for a chequered velvet is simple, the alternation of colours, although likely balanced over the whole piece, requires a separate tension for the ends on each of <b>the</b> two <b>pile</b> <b>shafts.</b> This is best facilitated by weighting the ends of each <b>pile</b> <b>shaft</b> separately on uniformly tensioned warp beams or with live weights.

40|$|AbstractAxial {{and lateral}} dynamic pile {{analyses}} are generally handled separately; and consequently, dynamic soil reactions {{are assumed to}} be uncoupled. However, pure loading is rarely encountered as combined loading occurs in many situations (offshore piles, pile driving as well as pile groups and pile rafts). In this study, the effects of nonlinear lateral pile vibrations on the in-phase nonlinear axial pile response of a pile shaft are studied. New approximate nonlinear solutions for both axial and lateral pile behavior, developed from general elastodynamic equations, are presented. The solutions are obtained by extending the elastodynamic solution for plane strain cases with a view to model soil nonlinearity. Since axial soil resistance depends on the confining stress around <b>the</b> <b>pile</b> <b>shaft,</b> the effect of the lateral soil behavior on the confining pressure of the pile circumference is investigated and the axial soil reaction from coupled in-phase vibrations is derived. It is concluded that the axial unit shear strength significantly increases when lateral soil vibrations involve plasticity, which in turn results in an increase in the axial dynamic resistance of <b>the</b> <b>pile</b> <b>shaft...</b>|$|E
40|$|Several {{bored pile}} field-testing {{observations}} showed the arching phenomena {{and its effect}} on side shear resistance. Finite element numerical model is developed in this paper to study the arching phenomena of bored <b>pile</b> and <b>the</b> effect on the overall compression capacity of single board <b>piles.</b> <b>The</b> numerical models developed apply a hardening/softening model (multi-surface) constitutive model to account for sandy soil nonlinear behavior. 2 D-axisymmetric Finite Elements single pile model has been developed and validated using several field-testings available in the literature. The numerical study has been conducted to investigate the effect of arching close to <b>the</b> single <b>pile</b> <b>shaft</b> on <b>pile</b> bearing capacity considering three major influence factors: pile length, pile diameter and sand relative density. The numerical analyses conducted show the importance of the arching phenomenon on the overall behavior of <b>piles</b> and on <b>the</b> prediction of bored piles bearing capacity...|$|R
40|$|The {{settlement}} {{behavior of}} a pile-raft foundation is analyzed {{with the help of}} a multiphase model aimed at describing the overall response of the reinforced ground. According to this model, <b>the</b> group of <b>piles</b> is treated as a homogenized continuous medium in interaction with the soil along <b>the</b> <b>pile</b> length, as well as at their lower tips. These two kinds of interaction, which play a decisive role in <b>the</b> way <b>the</b> <b>piles</b> are actually working as strengthening elements, are described by specific constitutive laws which can be directly introduced in the general governing equations of the multiphase model. Thus improved, the multiphase model can then be incorporated in a finite element code developed in the context of an elastoplastic behavior of the soil, provided that the constitutive parameters of the interaction laws have been previously identified. This identification procedure is performed through numerical simulations of the simple problem of a single pile, loaded at its top. The global response of vertically loaded piled-raft foundations, expressed in the form of load settlement curves, is finally presented, clearly highlighting the decisive influence of <b>the</b> mobilized <b>pile</b> <b>shaft</b> friction and tip resistance on the foundation settlement reduction...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe jacket type {{offshore}} wind turbine transfers efficiently the horizontal load applied on the wind turbine to an axial load on <b>the</b> four <b>piles</b> of its foundation. The axial behaviour of one single <b>pile</b> of <b>the</b> foundation is investigated in a geotechnical centrifuge. <b>The</b> model <b>pile,</b> tested under a 100 g centrifuge acceleration, is designed to represent a cast-in-place pile with a 1. 8 m diameter and a 40 m embedded length. <b>The</b> <b>pile,</b> installed in dense Fontainebleau sand, is instrumented with a load sensor at its end to measure the tip resistance. By subtracting the total load applied on <b>the</b> <b>pile,</b> its <b>shaft</b> capacity is also calculated. Different axial loading paths are applied: i) monotonic loadings in compression and tension to obtain ultimate capacities and ii) cyclic loadings which represent a more realistic loading path applied by the jacket during its life {{time in order to}} observe the tip and shaft capacities reductions...|$|R
