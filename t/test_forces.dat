For {{the problem}} {{that the value of}} <b>test</b> <b>force</b> will influence the result of instrumented indentation hardness test, the relation between <b>test</b> <b>force</b> and instrumented indentation hardness, indentation modulus were investigated. 55 groups of tests were carried out, in which the <b>test</b> <b>force</b> were divided to 11 different levels.

30|$|Spinal {{instrumentation}} surgeries are popular, and {{an increasing}} number of surgeries is being performed annually [1, 2]. Implant stability is important in spinal instrumentation surgeries, as it ensures secure fixation of the implant to the bone and prevents implant fixation failure [3, 4]. In particular, in the field of spinal surgery, the rate of postoperative pedicle screw loosening has been reported to be up to 12 % [5, 6]. Galbusera et al. [7] reported a screw loosening incidence of up to 60 % among patients with osteoporosis. Pedicle screw loosening {{is one of the major}} indications for revision after spinal surgery [8]. An appropriate initial <b>test</b> <b>force</b> is important to achieve good surgical results and prevent screw loosening. To overcome these issues, both the prediction of <b>test</b> <b>force</b> using preoperative images and establishment of an intraoperative <b>test</b> <b>force</b> evaluation system are required.|$|R

30|$|With {{regard to}} the {{establishment}} of an intraoperative <b>test</b> <b>force</b> evaluation system, pull-out force [3, 15, 16] and insertion torque [3, 17] are the <b>test</b> <b>force</b> measures generally used to evaluate screw stability. Pull-out force is measured destructively through laboratory testing and is defined as the maximum axial force required to pull a screw out from the bone [18]. Additionally, {{it is not possible to}} measure insertion torque more than once after screw fixation. Thus, pull-out force and insertion torque are not used as intraoperative measures.|$|R

30|$|The {{significant}} correlations of volume BMD, BV/TV, and SMI {{with the two}} conventional <b>test</b> <b>forces</b> observed {{in this study are}} in agreement with those reported in previous studies using a cadaveric femoral head [37, 38].

These results indicate that a plate-like bone structure with high BMD or BV exhibits high <b>test</b> <b>forces,</b> as reported in a previous study [17]. Among the volume BMD and micro-architectural parameters in this study, BS/TV was the parameter that best predicted the two <b>test</b> <b>forces</b> by itself. The BS/TV value rises when the bone quality improves with high BMD.|$|E

30|$|The {{present study}} found that peak torque and {{pull-out}} force had the strongest correlations with BS/TV and that the ISQ value had the strongest correlation with NNd/TV on micro-CT and MSCT. Our findings indicate that <b>test</b> <b>forces,</b> including the ISQ value, can be predicted by CT parameters on both micro-CT and MSCT. Many trials have evaluated the stability of orthopedic implants (i.e., insertion torque and pull-out force) [9, 15, 17, 33 – 35].

The ISQ value showed a lower but significant correlation with BS/TV (ρ[*]=[*] 0.267, p[*]=[*] 0.0427). However, it was not significantly correlated with volume BMD, BV/TV, BS/TV, trabecular thickness, trabecular separation, and trabecular number.

40|$|Abstract The direct {{verification}} of Rockwell testing machines comprises four parts such as <b>test</b> <b>force,</b> indenter, depth measuring device, and testing cycle {{as seen in}} ISO 6508 - 2. Among them, the {{verification of}} testing cycle is generally carried out by using a stopwatch on industrial sites, which is not so reliable. In addition to this, most of commercial hardness testing machines produced nowadays are automatically controlled by the embedded software, which makes {{it much more difficult}} to calibrate the testing cycle. It implies that even though hardness testing machines are advanced more, the calibration of the testing cycle does not keep up with their advancement. To overcome this problem, an on-site calibration system was developed to calibrate the testing cycle of both the automatically controlled as well as manually controlled Rockwell hardness testing machines. The calibration system is composed of load cell, indentation depth measuring apparatus and embedded clock. Using this system, measurement of <b>test</b> <b>force,</b> application velocity of <b>test</b> <b>force,</b> and indentation depth are possible simultaneously in real time, which enhances the efficiency and reliability of calibration procedure...|$|R

30|$|A strong {{relationship}} {{was found between}} peak torque and pull-out force (Fig.  4 a), suggesting that peak torque, which {{is close to the}} operator’s hand, may be similar to pull-out force, which reflects axial load [18]. Siddiqui et al. [36] reported a strong correlation between the subjective assessment of screw hold and pull-out force. A similar result was obtained in the present study. In this study, RFA was used to evaluate pedicle screw stability. RFA involving the Osstell ISQ system has been used to evaluate dental implant stability [23]. Our research group [19] reported that RFA in spinal surgery reflects multidirectional load, which represents in vivo physiological loading conditions unlike conventional <b>test</b> <b>forces</b> (insertion torque and pull-out force), in a model bone study. In the present study using cadaveric vertebrae, the correlation of RFA with conventional <b>test</b> <b>forces</b> was low (Fig.  4 b, c), similar to the finding in the previous report [19].|$|E
