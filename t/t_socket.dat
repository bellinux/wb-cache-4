50|$|LGA 775, {{also known}} as <b>Socket</b> <b>T,</b> is an Intel desktop CPU socket. LGA stands for land grid array. Unlike earlier common CPU sockets, such as its {{predecessor}} Socket 478, the LGA 775 has no socket holes; instead, it has 775 protruding pins which touch contact points {{on the underside of}} the processor (CPU).|$|R
50|$|The 'Presler Extreme Edition' was {{intended}} to only be combined with the Intel 975X chipset, it could also work with the 955X chipset, though this combination was not supported by Intel. The i975X featured the ICH7R southbridge and supported all LGA 775 (<b>Socket</b> <b>T)</b> Pentium 4, Pentium D, and Pentium Extreme Edition branded processors.|$|R
40|$|There is a {{considerable}} demand for lower limb prostheses globally due to vascular disease, war, conflict, land mines and natural disasters. Conventional composite materials used for prosthetic limb sockets include acrylic resins, glass and carbon fibres, which produce harmful gasses and dust in their manufacture. To investigate the feasibility of using a renewable plant oil-based polycarbonate-polyurethane copolymer resin and plant fibre composite, instead of conventional materials, to improve safety and accessibility of prosthetic limb manufacture. Test pieces of the resin {{with a range of}} plant fibres (10. 0 % by volume) were prepared and tensile strengths were tested. <b>Test</b> <b>sockets</b> of both conventional composite materials and plant resin with plant fibres were constructed and tested to destruction. Combinations of plant resin and either banana or ramie fibres gave high tensile strengths. The conventional composite material socket and plant resin with ramie composite socket failed at a similar loading, exceeding the ISO 10328 standard. Both wall thickness and fibre-matrix adhesion {{played a significant role in}} socket strength. From this limited study we conclude that the plant resin and ramie fibre composite socket has the potential to replace the standard layup. Further mechanical and biocompatibility testing as well as a full economic analysis is required. Using readily sourced and renewable natural fibres and a low-volatile bio-resin has potential to reduce harm to those involved in the manufacture of artificial limb sockets, without compromising socket strength and benefitting clinicians working in poorer countries where safety equipment is scarce. Such composite materials will reduce environmental impact...|$|R
50|$|The 3100 series, codenamed Wolfdale (product code 80570) dual-core Xeon (branded) CPU, {{was just}} a rebranded version of the Intel's {{mainstream}} Core 2 Duo E7000/E8000 and Pentium Dual-Core E5000 processors, featuring the same 45 nm process and 6 MB of L2 cache. Unlike most Xeon processors, they only support single-CPU operation. They use LGA 775 (<b>Socket</b> <b>T),</b> operate on a 1333 MHz front-side bus, support Enhanced Intel Speedstep Technology and Intel Virtualization Technology but do not support Hyper-Threading.|$|R
50|$|LGA 1366, {{also known}} as Socket B, is an Intel CPU socket. This socket {{supersedes}} Intel's LGA 775 (<b>Socket</b> <b>T)</b> in the high-end and performance desktop segments. It also replaces the server-oriented LGA 771 (Socket J) in the entry level and is superseded itself by LGA 2011. LGA stands for land grid array. This socket has 1,366 protruding pins which touch contact points {{on the underside of}} the processor (CPU) and accesses up to three channels of DDR3 memory via the processor's internal memory controller.|$|R
50|$|Pentium 4 {{processors}} have {{an integrated}} heat spreader (IHS) that prevents the die from accidentally being damaged when mounting and unmounting cooling solutions. Prior to the IHS, a CPU shim was sometimes used by people worried about damaging the core. Overclockers sometimes removed the IHS from Socket 423 and Socket 478 chips {{to allow for}} more direct heat transfer. On processors using the Socket LGA 775 (<b>Socket</b> <b>T)</b> interface, the IHS is directly soldered to the die or dies, {{making it difficult to}} remove.|$|R
5000|$|The 3000 series, codenamed Conroe (product code 80557) dual-core Xeon (branded) CPU, {{released}} {{at the end}} of September 2006, was the first Xeon for single-CPU operation. The same processor is branded as Core 2 Duo or as Pentium Dual-Core and Celeron, with varying features disabled.They use LGA 775 (<b>Socket</b> <b>T),</b> operate on a 1066 MHz front-side bus, support Enhanced Intel Speedstep Technology and Intel Virtualization Technology but do not support Hyper-Threading.

5000|$|The Prescott and Cedar Mill Pentium 4 cores, {{as well as}} the Smithfield and Presler Pentium D cores, {{used the}} LGA 775 socket. In July 2006, Intel {{released}} the desktop processor Core 2 Duo (codenamed Conroe), which also uses this socket, as does the subsequent Core 2 Quad. Intel changed from Socket 478 to LGA 775 because the new pin type offers better power distribution to the processor, allowing the front-side bus to be raised to 1600 MT/s. The 'T' in <b>Socket</b> <b>T</b> was derived from the now cancelled Tejas core, which was to replace the Prescott core. Another advantage for Intel with this newer architecture is that it is now the motherboard which has the pins, rather than the CPU, transferring the risk of pins being bent from the CPU to the motherboard.The CPU is pressed into place by a [...] "load plate", rather than human fingers directly. The installer lifts the hinged [...] "load plate", inserts the processor, closes the load plate {{over the top of the}} processor, and pushes down a locking lever. The pressure of the locking lever on the load plate clamps the processor's 775 copper contact points firmly down onto the socket's 775 pins, ensuring a good connection. The load plate only covers the edges of the top surface of the CPU (integrated heat spreader). The center is free to make contact with the cooling device placed on top of the CPU. The spacing for the CPU cooler mounting holes is 72mm x 72mm.|$|R
