5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1958, Nasser formed a <b>tripartite</b> <b>committee</b> {{consisting}} of Zakaria Mohieddin, al-Hawrani, and Salah Bitar to oversee developments in Syria. By moving the latter two, who were Ba'athists, to Cairo, he neutralized important political figures who had their own ideas about how Syria should be run. He put Syria under Sarraj, who effectively reduced the province to a police state by imprisoning and exiling landholders who objected {{to the introduction of}} Egyptian agricultural reform in Syria, as well as communists. Following the Lebanese election of Fuad Chehab in September 1958, relations between Lebanon and the UAR improved considerably. On 25 March 1959, Chehab and Nasser met at the Lebanese–Syrian border and compromised on an end to the Lebanese crisis.|$|E

500|$|On 1 May 2010, the Greek {{government}} announced {{a series of}} austerity measures (the Third austerity package within months) to secure a three-year [...] loan (First Economic Adjustment Programme). This was met with great anger by some Greeks, leading to massive protests, riots, and social unrest throughout Greece. The Troika, a <b>tripartite</b> <b>committee</b> formed by the European Commission, the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund (EC, ECB and IMF), offered Greece a second bailout loan worth [...] in October 2011 (Second Economic Adjustment Programme), but with the activation being conditional on implementation of further austerity measures and a debt restructure agreement. Surprisingly, the Greek prime minister George Papandreou first answered that call by announcing a December 2011 referendum on the new bailout plan, but had to back down amidst strong pressure from EU partners, who threatened to withhold an overdue [...] loan payment that Greece needed by mid-December. On 10 November 2011, Papandreou resigned following {{an agreement with the}} New Democracy party and the Popular Orthodox Rally to appoint non-MP technocrat Lucas Papademos as new prime minister of an interim national union government, with responsibility for implementing the needed austerity measures {{to pave the way for}} the second bailout loan.|$|E

2500|$|The {{issue of}} the region's public {{finances}} also influenced continued talk of reinforcing the archipelago's autonomy following a memorandum of understanding signed between the Portuguese and (proposed by) the Azorean Regional Governments, that provided for a 10-year 135 million Euro loan. Among the requirements of this understanding, the loan was dependent on: the guarantee that the Azores followed {{the objectives of the}} Programa de Ajustamento Econónomico e Financeiro (Program for Economic and Financial Adjustment); stabilized public finances; refrain from aggravating public finances (directly or indirectly) through the remuneration of public service employees, the reduction of public servants inline with the objectives of the PAEF; a promise not to create new public-private partnerships that resulted in new financial burdens; an analysis of existing public-partnerships (within three months from the memorandum's signing) as a precondition for funding; regular monthly bulletins on the state of Regional finances, remitted to the Direção-Geral do Orçamento (Directorate-General for the Budget); full cooperation with the Inspecção-Geral de Finanças (General Inspection for Finances); among other details. Many of the parties protested that agreement was equivalent to transferring the control of the Azores to the Ministry of Finances, requesting a debate on the issue in the Regional Assembly. Berta Cabral, leader of the PSD Açores, although aligned with the national government, cited her willingness to alter the terms of the memorandum if her party was elected. This stance was criticized by both the CDS-PP and PS leaders the next day, who cited the legality of the document and the desperation {{on the part of the}} PSD (stating that the understanding did not demand anything more than what was already required by Regional Finance Laws), respectively. Nonetheless, the PS leader used his campaign to criticize the national government for policies that [...] "brought more austerity to the Azores", citing measures by Vitor Gaspar (Minister of Finances) following the fifth intervention by the Troika (a <b>tripartite</b> <b>committee</b> led by the European Commission with the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund) delegation.|$|E

40|$|This article {{studies the}} effect of recent labor market reforms on {{industrial}} relations in new democracies (1994 – 2003). The literature on labor politics posits two channels through which labor market deregu-lation may relate to industrial conflict. Wage deregulation may lower wage costs, increasing industrial conflict. Employment deregulation, however, can reduce the ability of workers to act collectively. Using methods uniquely suited for panel data analysis, the study reveals {{a number of important}} findings. First, whereas labor quiescence went hand in hand with relatively modest increases in earnings in a number of established democracies, modest wage increases are generally linked with more labor militancy in new democracies. Higher wage and employment regulation minimize wage reductions, lowering the inci-dence of strikes. Finally, wage regulation has the largest effect on aggregate wages and consequently on the incidence of strikes and lockouts. While democratization expands popular participation, it also increases pressures for redistribution, particularly from the working class (Nelson, 1991; Rodrik, 1999). One way governments in new democracies 1 have addressed this challenge is through the creation of institutions of national social dialogue. Over the last two decades, participation by representatives of trade union and employer associations in economic and social policy-making (Ishikawa, 2003, p. 3) has featured promi-nently in processes of democratic transition and consolidation. In many new democracies, social dialogue has assumed special importance, both in terms of its ability to maintain social cohesion and of the economic reforms which it has made possible (ILO, 1997). Tripartite institutions have been instru-mental in the reform of labor market policies and institutions in Latin America and Southern Europe (Cook, 2007, p. 11). 2 In all Central and Eastern European democracies, <b>tripartite</b> <b>committees</b> have become the mechanism through which wage increases are regulated and minimum wages set (Borisov and Clarke, 2006...|$|R
25|$|Between 1945 and 2005, the {{economic}} structure of Luxembourg changed significantly. The {{crisis of the}} metallurgy sector, {{which began in the}} mid-1970s and lasted till the late 1980s, nearly pushed the country into economic recession, given the monolithic dominance of that sector. The <b>Tripartite</b> Coordination <b>Committee,</b> consisting of members of the government, management representatives, and trade union leaders, succeeded in preventing major social unrest during those years, thus creating the myth of a “Luxembourg model” characterised by social peace. Although {{in the early years of}} the 21st century Luxembourg enjoyed one of the highest GNP per capita in the world, this was mainly due to the strength of its financial sector, which gained importance at the end of the 1960s. Thirty-five years later, one-third of the tax proceeds originated from that sector. The harmonisation of the tax system across Europe could, however, seriously undermine the financial situation of the grand duchy.|$|R

50|$|The {{government}} had not however awaited the crisis {{to begin a}} reflection on the structural {{strengths and weaknesses of}} Luxembourg. Commissioned by the previous coalition, professor Lionel Fontagné of the University of Paris I presented a report in November 2004 on Luxembourg's competitivity, entitled A crack in the steel (Une paille dans l’acier). The conclusions of this analysis fed in to the work of the <b>Tripartite</b> Coordination <b>Committee</b> which included the government and the social partners. The Tripartite managed to agree on the structural determinants of competitivity, namely education and innovation. Public and private efforts would increase spending on research and development. A national action plan was to allow the country to reach the Lisbon goals. The government increased its commitments to finance the activities of the University of Luxembourg, set up in 2003. In 2006, a multi-year contract was signed between the State and the University, providing the latter with long-term planning security.|$|R

5000|$|In July 1975, the {{government}} introduced a law {{allowing it to}} take measures to avoid layoffs and to assure full employment. This law also established an [...] "economic committee" [...] charged with closely monitoring the economic situation. A second law opened a budget credit of 250 million francs to finance extraordinary works in the general interest. In 1977, faced with the worsening of the steel crisis, {{the government}} created an additional body for dialogue and consultation: a <b>Tripartite</b> Coordination <b>Committee,</b> including representatives of the government, employers, and the trade unions. The Tripartite conference for the steel industry came to a first agreement, concluded on 19 March 1979 and included in the law of 8 June 1979, on restructuring and modernisation of the steel industry. This institutionalised cooperation between the social partners has since {{been described as the}} [...] "Luxembourg model". The Tripartite made it possible to use consensus to manage a structural crisis which was becoming a problem of national solidarity. Two measures in particular allowed heavy industry to reduce its headcount without massive layoffs: on the one hand, the creation of a [...] "Division Anti-Crise" [...] - the DAC - employing the workers who were the victims of rationalisation efforts, on the other hand, the installation of an obligatory pre-retirement at 57 years for steel industry workers. The operation was financed by a national solidarity tax.|$|R

Acting as a joint labor-management alliance of the International Brotherhood of Boilermakers and industry owners and contractors, the Committee enrolled the assistance of Cornell University’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations to research, conduct pilots, and produce this Gainsharing Handbook. This Handbook offers an introductory outline of the components of a gainsharing program. The overall goal is to help industry partners understand whether and how to implement a gainsharing approach that can best match their needs and circumstances. Toward these goals the handbook provides background information together with guidance based on the experience of this industry and other construction-related and manufacturing environments. Sample worksheets and templates are included to illustrate how to develop the specifics of gainsharing in your situation. Pilot case studies are also presented highlighting lessons learned by those who have recently implemented programs in a variety of energy construction industry situations...|$|R
