Current research is primarily concerned with: analytic nonlinear systems, crosscorrelation functions under nonlinear <b>transformation,</b> <b>output</b> probability densities of linear systems, signal theory, second-order correlation functions, and probability distribution analyzers. 1. A generalization of time-invariant linear systems to some nonlinear systems is being developed. The generalization is based upon replacing the condition of linearity by that of analyticity (expressibility in a power series). An analytic system is charac-terized by an infinite sequence of system functions. One advantage of this development is that two analytic systems in cascade are equivalent to one analytic system, the Fourier transforms of whose system functions are series of products of the transforms of the system functions of the components. 2. The relationship between the crosscorrelation functions of two time functions before and after nonlinear transformation is of considerable theoretical and practical importance.

In particular, the paper provides a model based on the safety-first rule under uncertainty to measure the risk premium in banking operations that are subject to loan default and other investment risks. Using panel data of forty banks in 1981 - 1996, a translog cost function and the associated share equations are used to estimate the dual rate of total cost diminution, the dual returns to scale, and the derived primal rate of total factor productivity. A constant elasticity of <b>transformation</b> <b>output</b> function is employed to construct an aggregated output index of loan and investment activities. The empirical results indicate a zero productivity growth and a highly risk averse banking industry. Government-owned banks are generally more risk averse than privately owned banks.

The algorithms process raw ultrasonic signals in backscattered spectrum domain, which is obtained using two time-frequency methods: short-time Fourier and Hilbert-Huang transformations.

In 26 cases of ocular tissues classification, one error occurred, when tissues were classified into classes of corpus vitreum blood, extraocular muscle, and orbit tissue. In this pilot classification parameters of spectral intercept and Nakagami parameter for instantaneous frequencies distribution of the 1 st intrinsic mode function were found specific for corpus vitreum blood, orbit and extraocular muscle tissues.

30|$|A {{straightforward}} {{approach for}} transferring this value to processor (x,y) {{is for a}} processor “near” the point (x^',y^') to send these data. Specifically, the processor (x^',y^') could estimate the intensity value Ĩ_n - 1 (x^',y^') by getting the intensity of pixels stored in neighboring processors (if needed) and then it could send that intensity value to the processor (x,y). The problem arising with {{this approach is that}} the processor (x^',y^') should know the processors to which it should send the intensity value it has just estimated. Since, for each block, the parameters of the bilinear transformation are different, this processor should estimate the transform parameters of a number of different blocks in order that it can determine which pixels are mapped after truncation to its position. Moreover, even if only one block was mapped to the “area” of this processor and hence only one instance of bilinear transformation was to be applied, still, it would be possible that more than one pixels could be mapped on the same pixel due to the truncation of the <b>transformation</b> <b>output</b> to the nearest integer. This holds even without applying this truncation, since reversing the bilinear transformation requires the solution of a quadratic equation anyhow (Wolberg 1990).|$|E
40|$|Control of {{wheeled chassis}} does not {{constitute}} {{a problem in the}} area of mobile robotic solely. Rather, it can be encountered in transportation, both at close range and long range. In this thesis, mobile chassis are characterized as kinematic models. These models prove to be erroneous at high speed, whereas they sufficiently accurately represent the real robotic system in situations when slow, autonomous motion of the robot is desired. In comparison with dynamic models, both their project and implementation are simpler, too. The first part of this thesis is focused on a basic description of the motion of a robot in-plane. In the next part, five, most frequently used wheels in robotics are described and characterized - standard fixed wheels, standard steering wheels, castor wheels, multidirectional wheels and omnidirectional wheels. The motion conditions are deduced from each type of wheel. There are two methods of projecting the mobile robot model – full modelling and generic modelling. Based on these two methods, six models of mobile robots with different motion properties are proposed and described. The last and most extensive part of this thesis deals with simulator of robot motion created in Matlab/Simulink. It includes users guide which allows the configuration of random chassis and various trajectories of motion. In this way, it is possible to visually evaluace and classify the the different types of robots.

40|$|Abstract. Analyzing desired generic {{properties}} of hash functions {{is an important}} current area in cryptography. For example, in Eurocrypt 2009, Dodis, Ristenpart and Shrimpton [7] introduced the elegant notion of “Preimage Awareness ” (PrA) of a hash function H P, and they showed that a PrA hash function followed by an <b>output</b> <b>transformation</b> modeled to be a FIL (fixed input length) random oracle is PRO (pseudorandom oracle) i. e. indifferentiable from a VIL (variable input length) random oracle. We observe that for recent practices in designing hash function (e. g. SHA- 3 candidates) most <b>output</b> <b>transformations</b> are based on permutation(s) or blockcipher(s), which are not PRO. Thus, a natural question is how the notion of PrA can be employed directly with these types of more prevalent <b>output</b> <b>transformations?</b> We consider the Davies-Meyer’s type <b>output</b> <b>transformation</b> OT(x) : = E(x) ⊕ x where E is an ideal permutation. We prove that OT(H P (·)) is PRO if H P is PrA, preimage resistant and computable message aware (a related but not redundant notion, needed in the analysis that we introduce in the paper). The similar result is also obtained for 12 PGV <b>output</b> <b>transformations.</b> We also observe that some popular double block length <b>output</b> <b>transformations</b> can not be employed as <b>output</b> <b>transformation...</b>|$|R
