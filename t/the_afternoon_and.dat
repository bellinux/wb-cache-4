5|$|On 14 June 1945 British {{aircraft}} {{conducted a}} series of raids against Japanese positions at Truk. The next morning, several islands were bombarded by British and Canadian cruisers, though only one of the four warships involved achieved any success. Further air strikes took place in <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>and</b> night of 15 June before the Allied force returned to its base.|$|E
5|$|The {{outbreak}} {{was caused}} by a vigorous upper-level trough that moved into the Southern Plains states on April 25. An extratropical cyclone developed ahead of this upper-level trough between northeastern Oklahoma and western Missouri, which moved northeast. Conditions were similar on April 26, with a predicted likelihood of severe thunderstorms, including an extended threat of strong to violent long-track tornadoes during <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>and</b> evening hours; mixed-layer CAPE values were forecast to be around 3000–4000 J/kg, around east Texas, Louisiana and Arkansas. The storm mode on April 26 was predicted to consist of mostly discrete supercells during <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>and</b> early evening, shifting over to a mesoscale convective complex, with more of a threat of damaging winds and hail during the nighttime hours.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there were}} minor exchanges {{of fire and}} some patrol activity, there was a lull in the battle on 14March in the {{northern}} sector. The following day, three Japanese infantry battalions fell on the US positions before dawn. They made some progress around Cox's Creek, but US forces counterattacked with air support, bazookas and flamethrowers, retaking part of the line. A platoon of M4 Sherman tanks arrived during <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> <b>and</b> at around 3:00pm they attacked the Japanese with supporting artillery fire and regained more of the perimeter. From there, the battle followed a similar pattern, with a lull in the fighting on 16March, followed by a renewed effort by the Japanese the next day, with several US positions being overrun.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, two tank {{companies}} and mechanized infantry attacked Nefisha, supported with close air support. The Egyptian commando battalion {{in charge of}} Nefisha managed to repel the attack after prolonged, heavy fighting that closed to very short distances. The Israelis lost three tanks, two half-tracks, {{and a large number}} of men. For their part the Sa'iqa at Nefisha lost 24 commandos, including four officers, and 42 wounded, including three officers. Edgar O'Ballance mentions a counterattack by the Sa'iqa which took place during <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>and</b> pushed some of Sharon's troops back along the Sweetwater Canal.

5|$|During {{the morning}} of July 5, deep {{convection}} rapidly increased and banding features formed despite strong easterly wind shear. The convection persisted into <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>and</b> the low was upgraded to Tropical Depression Five-E accordingly. Weak steering currents persisted as the depression moved towards the northwest at 4mph (6km/h) to 5mph (8km/h). Following the storm's upgrade, further development did not occur as the system tracked steadily towards the north-northwest. Early on July7, the depression made landfall near Lazaro Cardenas with winds of 35mph (55km/h). Rapid weakening followed shortly after landfall and the storm dissipated several hours later over the mountains of Mexico.|$|E
5|$|For {{two weeks}} the British and French squadrons watched one another, the British unable to attack and the French unable to escape. In {{an effort to}} break the deadlock, Cochrane sent to Martinique for a body of 3,000 men under Major-General Frederick Maitland. With this force he {{launched}} a surprise invasion of the islands on 14 April, the amphibious operation commanded by Captain Philip Beaver in HMS Acasta and executed successfully with only minor casualties. Parties of seamen went ashore {{in the wake of}} the soldiers, working rapidly to establish a battery of two 8-inch howitzers on Morne-Russell. These guns began firing during <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>and</b> by 20:00 Troude had given orders for his squadron to sail through the western channel during the night.|$|E
5|$|Liman von Sanders had no combat {{formations}} {{available to}} stop the cavalry advance up the coast and across the Esdraelon Plain; Allenby's attack forced the Yildirim Army Group and its commander to retire.

At the same time, African Americans ended their six-week-old boycott of the downtown stores. The plan continued successfully and the lunch counters were integrated without any further incidents of violence. Nashville thus became the first major city in the South to begin desegregating its public facilities.|$|E
5|$|The Allied commanders {{planned to}} defeat Turkey and force a supply route through to Russia via the Bosporus and the Black Sea. As such they planned a land {{invasion}} on the Gallipoli Peninsula. On {{the afternoon of}} 25 April 1915, Murray's 16th Battalion landed at Ari Burnu, Gallipoli. Setting their machine gun on Pope's Hill, Black and Murray fired their gun throughout <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>and</b> into the night. The following day, the battalion's two machine gun crews sniped at the Turkish soldiers on Russell's Top, and Murray and his gunner continued fighting during the counterattack on 26–27 April, despite being wounded.|$|E

5|$|The raid was {{postponed}} {{for several days}} after the 23 February rehearsal due to weather conditions, but on 27 February the weather proved to be ideal, with clear skies and good visibility for the aircraft of 51 Squadron, and a full moon which would provide illumination for the evacuation of the raiding force. The naval force under Commander Cook departed from Britain during <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> <b>and</b> the Whitley transport aircraft carrying C Company took off from RAF Thruxton in the evening.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea otter}} is diurnal. It has {{a period of}} {{foraging}} and eating in the morning, starting {{about an hour before}} sunrise, then rests or sleeps in mid-day. Foraging resumes for a few hours in <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>and</b> subsides before sunset, and a third foraging period may occur around midnight. Females with pups appear to be more inclined to feed at night. Observations of the amount of time a sea otter must spend each day foraging range from 24 to 60%, apparently depending on the availability of food in the area.|$|E
5|$|Willaumez's fleet {{discovered}} Beresford's ships off Lorient at 16:30 in <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>and</b> Willaumez {{ordered his}} second-in-command, Contre-amiral Antoine Louis de Gourdon, to drive Beresford away.

5|$|A {{high risk}} of severe storms—the first such {{issuance}} since April7, 2006—was issued for {{a large part of}} the Deep South for March1 as the cold front moved eastward. The activity began almost immediately, with several isolated tornadoes taking place that morning across the Mississippi Valley, with one of them leading to the first fatality of the outbreak. Isolated tornadoes were also reported as far north as Illinois, near the center of the low. However, the most intense activity began around noon and continued throughout <b>the</b> <b>afternoon</b> <b>and</b> evening, with southern Alabama and southern Georgia hit the hardest. Nearly continuous supercells formed north of the Gulf of Mexico and produced many tornadoes, some of which hit large population centers with devastating effects. Twenty people were killed by those tornadoes.|$|E
5|$|A lull {{probably}} occurred {{early in}} <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> <b>and</b> {{a break for}} rest and food {{would probably have been}} needed. William may have also needed time to implement a new strategy, which may have been inspired by the English pursuit and subsequent rout by the Normans. If the Normans could send their cavalry against the shield wall and then draw the English into more pursuits, breaks in the English line might form. William of Poitiers says the tactic was used twice. Although arguments have been made that the chroniclers' accounts of this tactic were meant to excuse the flight of the Norman troops from battle, this is unlikely as the earlier flight was not glossed over. It was a tactic used by other Norman armies during the period. Some historians have argued that the story of the use of feigned flight as a deliberate tactic was invented after the battle; most historians agree that it was used by the Normans at Hastings.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} {{vigilance}} behaviour of herds revealed that individuals on {{the borders of}} herds {{tend to be more}} cautious; vigilance decreases with group size. Group size and distance from roads and bushes were found to have major influence on vigilance, more among the grazing springbok than among their browsing counterparts. Adults were found to be more vigilant than juveniles, and males more vigilant than females. Springbok passing through bushes tend to be more vulnerable to predator attacks as they can not be easily alerted, and predators usually conceal themselves in bushes. Another study calculated that the time spent in vigilance by springbok on the edges of herds is roughly double that spent by those in the centre and the open. Springbok were found to be more cautious in the late morning than at dawn or in <b>the</b> <b>afternoon,</b> <b>and</b> more at night than in the daytime. Rates and methods of vigilance were found to vary with the aim of lowering risk from predators.|$|E
