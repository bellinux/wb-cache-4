After learning of Jack's situation from Sawyer, Kate goes to help, leaving the job of <b>turning</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> signal to Sawyer. Charlie squeezes through an opening at the cave and finds Jack, but while doing so, the opening collapses and traps Charlie and Jack inside. Charlie hesitantly pops Jack's shoulder back into place at Jack's request. Jack correctly guesses that Charlie is suffering from withdrawal, and Charlie assures Jack he's okay. Kate desperately tries to dig them out {{along with the other}} castaways, while the two worry about losing oxygen. Charlie sees a moth which leads him to an opening and the pair dig out of the cave.|$|E
5|$|The team of Chris Jericho and The Miz {{had begun}} feuding with The Hart Dynasty (Tyson Kidd and David Hart Smith) over the Unified WWE Tag Team Championship. The Miz's feud with The Hart Dynasty had begun while The Miz was {{one-half}} of the Unified Tag Team Champions with Big Show. During the Draft episode of Raw, The Hart Dynasty defeated The Miz and Big Show to win the championship, which led to Big Show <b>turning</b> <b>on</b> <b>The</b> Miz. The following week, The Miz and Jericho, another former tag team partner of Big Show, teamed up to attack The Hart Dynasty. Jericho went on to defeat Smith to earn a championship match for himself and The Miz at Over the Limit.|$|E
5|$|After {{trekking}} {{across the}} desert and nearly dying of dehydration, Tintin and Haddock are rescued and taken to a French outpost, where they hear on the radio the storm sunk the Karaboudjan. They travel to a Moroccan port, {{and along the way}} are attacked by Tuareg tribesmen, defending themselves with French MAS-36 rifles. At the port, members of his old crew kidnap the Captain after he recognises their disguised Karaboudjan. Tintin meets Thomson and Thompson who got his message, and they learn that the wealthy merchant Omar ben Salaad sold the crab tins; Tintin tells Thomson and Thompson to discreetly investigate. Tintin tracks down the gang and saves the Captain, but they both become intoxicated by the fumes from wine barrels breached in a shootout with the villains. Haddock chases a gang-member from the cellar to an entrance behind a bookcase in Salaad's house. Upon sobering up, Tintin discovers a necklace of a crab with golden claws on the now-subdued owner of the wine cellar, Omar ben Salaad, and realizes that he {{is the leader of the}} drug cartel. Allan steals a boat and tries escaping, but Tintin captures him. The police arrest the gang and free the Japanese man, who introduces himself as Bunji Kuraki, a police detective who was trying to warn Tintin of the group he was up against. He had been investigating the sailor on Haddock's crew who drowned; the sailor was on the verge of bringing him opium before he was eliminated. <b>Turning</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> radio, Tintin learns that, thanks to him, the entire organisation of the Crab with the Golden Claws is behind bars.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} {{movements}} {{in place that}} are commonly used in dressage training: <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> forehand, <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> haunches, and the pirouette. Additionally, <b>the</b> pivot <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hindquarters and <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> center are seen in Western riding. The roll-back turn, seen in jumping events and in reining, is a variation <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pirouette. All these movements are performed in relatively one place, in a circular motion.|$|R

5|$|The murals {{are one of}} {{the best}} {{representations}} of Byzantine art outside the traditional borders of Byzantium. The majority of the murals bear scriptures in Greek. The murals were painted under the patronage of atabek Ivane Zakarian between 1205 and 1216. Parallels have been drawn between the murals and the 11th century Armenian miniature paintings of the Mugni Gospels. The coloring of the murals is characteristic of typical Byzantine art while the thematic solutions are more Armenian. New and Old Testaments scenes as well as various saints including Saint Gregory the Illuminator are depicted on the murals. A large image of the Holy Virgin is depicted in the dome holding Jesus. The mural has been badly damaged and only parts of it survived. Below the Holy Virgin, the Communion is shown where Jesus is depicted twice, <b>turning</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> right and left sharing bread with the Apostles. The images of the Apostles Peter, John the Evangelist, Paul and Matthew have survived. The common Christians saints are depicted below the Communion scene, including Pope Sylvester, Saint James the son of Alpheus, Saint John Chrysostom, Basil the Great, Gregory the Illuminator, Jacob of Mtsbin, Clement of Rome, Gregory the Thaumaturgist, Cyril of Alexandria and Eusebius of Caesarea. The murals on the western wall depict the Kingdom of Heaven. The northern wall depicts the trial of Jesus by the high priest of Caiaphas and by the Roman Procurator Pontius Pilate. Some of the murals were renovated in 1979. The arches, niches and columns are also covered by murals.|$|E
25|$|It is even {{possible}} to have cases in which an experiment's results differ when the potentials are changed, even if no charged particle is ever exposed to a different field. One such example is the Aharonov–Bohm effect, shown in the figure. In this example, <b>turning</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> solenoid only causes a magnetic field B to exist within the solenoid. But the solenoid has been positioned so that the electron cannot possibly pass through its interior. If one believed that the fields were the fundamental quantities, then {{one would expect that}} the results of the experiment would be unchanged. In reality, the results are different, because <b>turning</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> solenoid changed the vector potential A in the region that the electrons do pass through. Now that it has been established that it is the potentials V and A that are fundamental, and not the fields E and B, we can see that the gauge transformations, which change V and A, have real physical significance, rather than being merely mathematical artifacts.|$|E

25|$|During {{the final}} Allied {{offensive}} into Burma in 1945, there were then {{a series of}} uprisings in Burma against the Japanese, which Force 136 supported although it had little control or even influence over the rebellious BNA and its supporters. The first rebellion involved a locally recruited force known as the Arakan Defence Army <b>turning</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Japanese in Arakan. The second involved an uprising by BNA units near Toungoo in Central Burma, beginning on 8 March 1945. The final uprising occurred when the entire BNA changed sides on 27 March.|$|E
25|$|On August 10, 2008, Compass-1 entered Emergency mode.

A hard reset occurred, only to bring the satellite into a circle of powering up, <b>turning</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> heaters, and then dying again. The only way to exit this loop was to avoid starting the heaters. The team needed as much Telemetry from the ground as possible, which was from amateur radio enthusiasts.|$|E
50|$|Common {{problems}} with <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> haunches include pivoting on one leg, backing through the turn (it {{is a much}} lesser sin for the horse to be moving slightly forward and make a wider circle), and loss of rhythm, {{as well as an}} incorrect turn (such as doing a <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> forehand or a <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> center if the rider allows the hindquarters to swing out). The horse should also remain straight (i.e. correctly bent) through the turn, rather than overbent in the neck or tilting the head.|$|R

25|$|The {{following}} {{night on}} Raw is War, Austin and The Rock {{faced each other}} in a rematch held in steel cage which Triple H entered the cage and teased a fight with Austin before <b>turning</b> <b>on</b> <b>The</b> Rock. For several minutes Austin, Triple H, and Vince McMahon triple teamed the outnumbered Rock forging an alliance with Triple H and Austin called The Two-Man Power Trip. The Rock was written out of the WWF's storylines with McMahon giving him a suspension. This allowed The Rock time off to begin filming The Scorpion King. The Rock returned on the edition of July 30 of Raw is War and chose to fight for Team WWF over Team WCW/ECW. Three weeks later at SummerSlam, Rock won his first WCW Championship by defeating Booker T. Rock and Austin would face each other again at WrestleMania XIX in a rematch that would also be known as Austin's last match to date, with Rock winning that match.|$|E
25|$|The main rivalry on the Raw brand {{was between}} John Cena and Shawn Michaels over the WWE Championship. After The Undertaker, {{the winner of}} the 2007 Royal Rumble match, made his {{decision}} to face Batista for the World Heavyweight Championship at WrestleMania, a match to determine the next challenger to the WWE Championship was announced. Michaels defeated Randy Orton and Edge in a match involving three wrestlers to win a chance to face Cena at WrestleMania. On an edition of Raw, Orton and Edge, who were tag team partners as Rated-RKO, attempted to attack Cena, but Michaels ran-in and attacked them with steel chairs. Before a scheduled tag team match between Rated-RKO and Cena and Michaels, Orton played a video that highlighted the past friendships that Michaels was involved in, before <b>turning</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> friend. In the match, Michaels nearly superkicked Cena after Orton moved. Due to a later disagreement, Edge left Orton and walked off backstage, which allowed Cena and Michaels to win the match. The following week, Michaels responded to the video set-up by Orton, and made comments regarding Cena.|$|E
25|$|On the March 4 {{episode of}} SmackDown, Big Show faced Kane in a {{confrontation}} until the Corre interfered on Kane's behalf. However, a miscommunication led to Kane <b>turning</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Corre. Big Show and Kane thus reunited {{to take on}} the Corre. At WrestleMania XXVII, Big Show and Kane teamed with Santino Marella and Kofi Kingston to beat The Corre. On the April 22 episode of SmackDown, the duo defeated Corre members Justin Gabriel and Heath Slater to win the WWE Tag Team Championship, their second championship win as a team. Big Show was drafted to Raw {{as a part of the}} 2011 WWE Draft. He and Kane then started feuding with the New Nexus. After defending the titles against Wade Barrett and Ezekiel Jackson at Extreme Rules and CM Punk and Mason Ryan at Over the Limit, Kane and Big Show lost their titles to Michael McGilligutty and David Otunga on the following day on Raw. After losing the titles, Show was run over by Alberto Del Rio's car, driven by his ring announcer Ricardo Rodriguez, and was sidelined with an injury for almost a month. He returned during a match between Kane and Del Rio, attacking both Del Rio and Rodriguez.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> {{forehand}} is {{the simplest}} of the exercises, asking the horse to move his hindquarters around his forehand, so that the hindquarters inscribe an arc. <b>The</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> haunches asks the horse to move his forehand around the hindquarters, so that the forelegs inscribe an arc, with the horse bent {{in the direction of}} the turn. It is therefore more difficult than <b>the</b> <b>turn</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> forehand, requiring better balance and engagement. The pirouette is the most difficult and advanced maneuver, asking the horse to bend in the direction of movement and remain engaged, and requiring collection.|$|R

La Parka entered the ring to seemingly confront his longtime partner, but then also attacked Wagner along with Octagón, Aguayo, Konan Big and Silver King, joining La Sociedad. At the first post-Héroes Inmortales television tapings on October 21, Parka blamed his turn on AAA for bringing back L.A. Park after his 15 years of loyal service, and the promotion's fans for choosing {{to root for}} both Park and Cibernético over him during his past two rivalries. On December 1, Parka and Park put their past differences aside, when they teamed {{together for the first}} time, defeating Dr. Wagner Jr. and Electroshock in a tag team main event. On March 18, 2012, at Rey de Reyes, La Parka, Dark Dragon and Tito Santana were defeated by Cibernético, Billy el Malo and Escoria in what was billed as the final chapter in the rivalry between Parka and Cibernético. After the match, Octagón turned on Parka, attacking him with Dragon and Santana, which led to Los Bizarros returning to the ring and chasing them away. After initially trying to save his alliance with La Sociedad, La Parka officially turned tecnico and rejoined AAA on April 30.|$|E
25|$|At about 00:00 on 17 April 1961, the two CIA LCIs Blagar and Barbara J, {{each with}} a CIA 'operations officer' and an Underwater Demolition Team (UDT) of five frogmen, entered the Bay of Pigs (Bahía de Cochinos) on the {{southern}} coast of Cuba. They headed a force of four transport ships (Houston, Río Escondido, Caribe and Atlántico) carrying about 1,400 Cuban exile ground troops of Brigade 2506, plus tanks and other vehicles in the landing craft. At about 01:00, Blagar, as the battlefield command ship, directed the principal landing at Playa Girón (code-named Blue Beach), led by the frogmen in rubber boats followed by troops from Caribe in small aluminium boats, then LCVPs and LCUs. Barbara J, leading Houston, similarly landed troops 35km further northwest at Playa Larga (code-named Red Beach), using small fiberglass boats. Unloading troops at night was delayed, due to engine failures and boats damaged by unforeseen coral reefs. As the frogmen came in, they were shocked {{to discover that the}} Red Beach was lit with floodlights, which led to the location of the landing being hastily changed. As the frogmen landed, a firefight broke out when a jeep carrying Cuban militia happened by. The few militia in the area succeeded in warning Cuban armed forces via radio soon after the first landing, before the invaders overcame their token resistance. Castro was woken up at about 3:15 am to be informed of the landings, which led him to put all militia units in the area on the highest state of alert and to order airstrikes. The Cuban regime planned to strike the brigadistas at Playa Larga first as they were inland before <b>turning</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> brigadistas at Girón at the sea. El Comandante departed personally to lead his forces into battle against the brigadistas.|$|E
500|$|At WrestleMania XXX, Triple H lost to Bryan, thereby {{granting}} Bryan {{a part in}} {{the subsequent}} title match against Batista and champion Randy Orton. Triple H assaulted Bryan after the match and later attempted to prevent Bryan from winning the title by interfering and recruiting Scott Armstrong as a crooked referee, but these attempts were unsuccessful as Bryan won the title by making Batista submit. In order to end Bryan's title reign, Triple H re-formed Evolution with Orton and Batista on the April 18 episode of SmackDown, but Bryan remained champion due to The Shield <b>turning</b> <b>on</b> <b>The</b> Authority. At Extreme Rules, Evolution lost to The Shield and again at Payback in a No Holds Barred elimination match. On the June 2 episode of Raw, Batista would leave the group after Triple H refused to grant him his shot at the WWE World Heavyweight Championship.
