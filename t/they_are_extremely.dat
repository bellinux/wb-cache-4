5|$|The UCSC {{campus is}} also one of the few homes to Mima Mounds in the United States. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> rare in the United States and in the world in general.|$|E
5|$|Common ravens have coexisted {{with humans}} for {{thousands}} of years and in some areas have been so numerous that people have regarded them as pests. Part of their success as a species is due to their omnivorous diet; <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> versatile and opportunistic in finding sources of nutrition, feeding on carrion, insects, cereal grains, berries, fruit, small animals, and food waste.|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>extremely</b> ugly, all of them, {{but very}} happy-looking and good-natured.|$|R
60|$|They {{would not}} come off the plates, but <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>extremely</b> beautiful.|$|R

5|$|The true {{honey bees}} (genus Apis, {{of which there}} are seven currently-recognized species) are highly eusocial, and are among the best known of all insects. Their colonies are {{established}} by swarms, consisting of a queen and several hundred workers. There are 29 subspecies of one of these species, Apis mellifera, native to Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. Africanized bees are a hybrid strain of A. mellifera that escaped from experiments involving crossing European and African subspecies; <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> defensive.|$|E
5|$|Military {{ambulances}} {{have historically}} included vehicles based on civilian designs {{and at times}} also included armored, but unarmed, vehicles ambulances based upon armoured personnel carriers (APCs). In the Second World War vehicles such as the Hanomag Sd Kfz 251 halftrack were pressed into service as ad hoc ambulances, and in more recent times purpose built AFVs such as the U.S. M1133 Medical Evacuation Vehicle serve the exclusive purpose of armored medical vehicles. Civilian based designs may be painted in appropriate colours, depending on the operational requirements (i.e. camouflage for field use, white for United Nations peacekeeping, etc.). For example, the British Royal Army Medical Corps has a fleet of white ambulances, based on production trucks. Military helicopters have also served both as ad hoc and purpose-built air ambulances, since <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> useful for MEDEVAC.|$|E
5|$|Prior to this burst, astronomers had {{not reached}} {{consensus}} regarding {{how far away}} GRBs occur from Earth. Although the isotropic distribution of bursts suggested {{that they do not}} occur within the disk of the Milky Way, some astronomers supported the idea that they occur within the Milky Way's halo, concluding that the bursts are visibly faint because they are not highly energetic. Others concluded that GRBs occur in other galaxies at cosmological distances and that they can be detected because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> energetic. The distance measurement and the calculations of the burst's total energy release unequivocally supported the latter theory, effectively ending the debate.|$|E
50|$|ICRC and Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) said <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>extremely</b> {{concerned}} about {{damage to the}} airports at Sanaa and {{the port city of}} Hodeidah.|$|R
50|$|As nasty as some {{of these}} jokes <b>were,</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>extremely</b> popular, and it became {{inevitable}} that someone would appropriate {{the name of the}} character.|$|R
50|$|From {{time to time}} postal administrations {{also try}} {{experiment}}s. For instance, the US tried issuing very small stamps during the 1970s, as a cost savings measure. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>extremely</b> unpopular, and the experiment was abandoned.|$|R
5|$|The animal faces {{a variety}} of {{critical}} threats. Poaching {{has long been a}} problem. Statistics show between 1959 and 1969 Amazonian Brazil alone accounted for 1,000 to 3,000 pelts annually. The species was so thoroughly decimated, the number dropped to just 12 in 1971. The implementation of CITES in 1973 finally brought about significant hunting reductions, although demand did not disappear entirely: in the 1980s, pelt prices were as high as US$250 on the European market. The threat has been exacerbated by the otters' relative fearlessness and tendency to approach human beings. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> easy to hunt, being active through the day and highly inquisitive. The animal's relatively late sexual maturity and complex social life makes hunting especially disastrous.|$|E
5|$|Thomson and Thompson (Dupont et Dupond in Hergé's {{original}} version) are two incompetent detectives {{who look}} like identical twins, their only discernible difference being the shape of their moustaches. First introduced in Cigars of the Pharaoh, they provide much of the comic relief throughout the series, being afflicted with chronic spoonerisms. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> clumsy, thoroughly incompetent, and usually bent on arresting the wrong character. The detectives usually wear bowler hats and carry walking sticks except when sent abroad; during those missions they attempt the national costume of the locality they are visiting, but instead dress in conspicuously stereotypical folkloric attire. The detectives were in part based on Hergé's father Alexis and uncle Léon, identical twins who often took walks together, wearing matching bowler hats while carrying matching walking sticks.|$|E
5|$|By 24–28days after hatching, {{the young}} birds start to perch on {{branches}} near the nest {{and take their}} first flight. They are fed by their parents for a further 28–30days, staying close to the nest while growing and practicing flying. At this stage <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> vocal, and their cries to their parents can often be heard a considerable distance away. The young hawks disperse after their parents stop provisioning them. Though they receive {{the same amount of}} food, male chicks (roughly half the size of females) mature more quickly and seem to be ready to leave the nest sooner. In a study in the Forest of Ae, south-west Scotland, it was found that 21% of nestlings over two days old died, with the causes of death being starvation, wet weather, predation and desertion by the parents. The parasite Leucocytozoon toddi can be passed from parent to nestling at the nest, possibly {{because of the number of}} birds sharing a small space, thus allowing transmission.|$|E
50|$|According to Lin Chi-ling, {{during the}} process of making the movies, she dared not to look at Chen Kun's eyes, because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>extremely</b> attractive. She <b>was</b> afraid of falling in love with Chen Kun during filming.|$|R
6000|$|But the Roman Candle and the Bengal Light {{were quite}} indignant, and kept saying, [...] "Humbug! humbug!" [...] {{at the top}} of their voices. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>extremely</b> practical, and {{whenever}} they objected to anything they called it humbug.|$|R
50|$|In Transformers: Energon, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>extremely</b> {{loyal to}} Scorponok. When Galvatron ordered all Terrorcons to bath in Super Energon, some were {{destroyed}} by it, but some were changed, growing a lot bigger. Scorponok had tons of trouble trying to control them.|$|R
25|$|Warlocks {{are also}} part of the fairy world. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> magical fairies that {{originate}} under unknown circumstances.|$|E
25|$|<b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> flexible. They {{can be used}} as CHP (combined {{heat and}} power) in the winter and as coolers in summer.|$|E
25|$|Young {{leaves and}} shoots, which look like asparagus, are used. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> sour; the fibrous outer skin must be peeled, soaked {{in water for}} half a day raw or after parboiling, before being cooked.|$|E
50|$|Their {{name was}} {{in honor of}} the {{original}} Kentucky Rifles which were a militia unit commanded by Andrew Jackson. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>extremely</b> skilled in long-range warfare and guerrilla tactics. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> utilized with great effect in the American campaign against the British Empire during The War of 1812.|$|R
60|$|Anna did {{not care}} much for other children. She domineered them, she treated them as if <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>extremely</b> young and incapable, to her <b>they</b> <b>were</b> little people, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> not her equals. So she was mostly alone, flying round the farm, {{entertaining}} the farm-hands and Tilly and the servant-girl, whirring on and never ceasing.|$|R
50|$|Little Blue Books are {{a series}} of small staple-bound books {{published}} in 1919-1978 by the Haldeman-Julius Publishing Company of Girard, Kansas. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>extremely</b> popular, and achieved a total of 300-500 million booklets sold over the series' lifetime. A Big Blue Book range was also published.|$|R
25|$|As cricket {{balls are}} hard and can travel {{at high speeds}} off the bat, {{protective}} equipment is recommended to prevent injury. There {{have been a few}} recorded deaths in cricket, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> rare, and not always related to fielding.|$|E
25|$|Carlito Pizarras {{serves as}} the Field Supervisor of the sanctuary, as {{employee}} of the foundation, assuming responsibility {{for the maintenance of}} the net enclosure and its inmates. Because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> shy and nervous, tarsiers can only be handled by an experienced keeper.|$|E
25|$|If {{the sample}} has outliers, they {{necessarily}} include the sample maximum or sample minimum, or both, {{depending on whether}} <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> high or low. However, the sample maximum and minimum need not be outliers, {{if they are not}} unusually far from other observations.|$|E
5000|$|From the Basque Pelota {{modalities}} {{played in}} the Basque Country the ones called [...] "bote luzea", [...] "mahi jokoa" [...] are extinct but, by all accounts <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>extremely</b> similar {{to what has been}} preserved in Valencian Pilota as Llargues, but using a bigger and heavier ball.|$|R
50|$|The company {{continued}} building mostly Stephenson long boiler locomotives, some 2-2-2 {{followed by}} outside-cylindered 2-4-0 with the firebox behind the wheels. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>extremely</b> unstable due the long overhang at each end. The six-coupled engines for goods work were more successful since speed {{was not a}} requirement.|$|R
6000|$|The smaller canoes, {{which were}} of one piece {{hollowed}} out by fire, usually had [...] "outriggers,"--boards projecting from, and parallel to, the canoes--to prevent their overturning, and occasionally two canoes were joined {{together for the}} same purpose, as, if unsupported, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>extremely</b> liable to upset.|$|R
25|$|Outliers, {{being the}} most extreme observations, may include the sample maximum or sample minimum, or both, {{depending}} on whether <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> high or low. However, the sample maximum and minimum are not always outliers because {{they may not be}} unusually far from other observations.|$|E
25|$|Incubating {{females are}} {{sometimes}} pulled from their nests at night. Female pinyon jays may {{be vulnerable to}} nocturnal and diurnal predators because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> reluctant to leave their nests. Because pinyon jays breed in loose colonies, a predator attuned to finding nests could potentially specialize on incubating or brooding females.|$|E
25|$|Llamas, {{which are}} well-socialized and trained to halter and lead after weaning, are very {{friendly}} and pleasant to be around. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>extremely</b> curious and most will approach people easily. However, llamas that are bottle-fed or over-socialized and over-handled as youth will become {{extremely difficult to}} handle when mature, when they will begin to treat humans as they treat each other, which is characterized by bouts of spitting, kicking and neck wrestling.|$|E
5000|$|Harriet Cains as Jemima [...] "Jem" [...] Walker, Kieren Walker's {{sister and}} a member of the local militia, the Human Volunteer Force (HVF). She has trouble {{accepting}} Kieren's return but still seems to care for her brother. She was especially troubled by Kieren's death as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>extremely</b> close.|$|R
5000|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the huge {{popularity}} of Oscar's decoys <b>is</b> that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>extremely</b> good at attracting fish. Even today, decoy carvers make [...] "honest copies" [...] of Oscar Peterson's fish since they claim that there are times that [...] "nothing else will attract a fish".|$|R
60|$|Near Fuentes {{we saw a}} large {{flock of}} guinea-fowl--probably fifty or sixty in number. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>extremely</b> wary, and could not <b>be</b> approached. <b>They</b> avoided us, like {{partridges}} on a rainy day in September, running with their heads cocked up; and if pursued, they readily took to the wing.|$|R
