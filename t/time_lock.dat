25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1957, Connery hired agent Richard Hatton who got him a role as Spike, a minor gangster with a speech {{impediment}} in Montgomery Tully's No Road Back alongside Skip Homeier, Paul Carpenter, Patricia Dainton and Norman Wooland. In April 1957, Rakoff—after being disappointed by Jack Palance—decided to give the young actor his first chance in a leading role, and cast Connery as Mountain McLintock in BBC TV's outstanding production of Requiem For a Heavyweight, which also starred Warren Mitchell and Jacqueline Hill. He then played a rogue lorry driver, Johnny Yates, in Cy Endfield's Hell Drivers (1957) alongside Stanley Baker, Herbert Lom, Peggy Cummins and Patrick McGoohan. Later in 1957, Connery appeared in Terence Young's poorly received MGM action picture Action of the Tiger opposite Van Johnson, Martine Carol, Herbert Lom and Gustavo Rojo; the film was shot on location in southern Spain. He also had a minor role in Gerald Thomas's thriller <b>Time</b> <b>Lock</b> (1957) as a welder, appearing alongside Robert Beatty, Lee Patterson, Betty McDowall and Vincent Winter; this commenced filming on 1 December 1956 at Beaconsfield Studios.|$|E

Three men entered the bank, two guarded the door outside, and three remained near a bridge across an adjacent square. The robbers inside the bank were thwarted when acting cashier Joseph Lee Heywood refused to open the safe, falsely claiming that it was secured by a <b>time</b> <b>lock</b> even as they held a Bowie knife to his throat and cracked his skull with a pistol butt.

Meanwhile, the citizens of Northfield grew suspicious of the men guarding the door and raised the alarm. The five bandits outside fired into the air to clear the streets, driving the townspeople to take cover and fire back from protected positions. They shot two bandits dead and wounded the rest in the barrage. Inside, the outlaws turned to flee. As they left, one shot the unarmed cashier Heywood in the head. Historians have speculated about the identity of the shooter but have not reached consensus.|$|E

Davros makes his first official appearance in the episode [...] "The Stolen Earth" [...] (2008), portrayed by Julian Bleach. The episode reveals that Davros was thought to have died {{during the first year of}} the Time War, when his command ship [...] "flew into the jaws of the Nightmare Child" [...] at the Gates of Elysium despite the Doctor's failed efforts to save him. But Davros was pulled out of the <b>time</b> <b>lock</b> of the war by Dalek Caan (voiced by Nicholas Briggs), using his own flesh to create a [...] "new empire" [...] of Daleks who place him in the Vault as their prisoner to make use of his knowledge.

From there, once the signal is made tangible enough, a Whitepoint Star, a diamond only found on Gallifrey, is used to create a link between {{the final day of the}} Time War and Earth so the Master could release Gallifrey from the <b>Time</b> <b>Lock.</b> The plan ultimately failed, as the Doctor destroyed the diamond link and the Master apparently sacrificed his life to take revenge on Rassilon, sending the Time Lords back to their apparent doom. Unknown to almost everyone involved however, this was not the final end of the Time Lords. As [...] "the Moment" [...] had a will of its own, it showed the War Doctor an alternative solution and ultimately enabled thirteen incarnations of the Doctor, ranging from the First Doctor through the Twelfth Doctor, to gather to save Gallifrey by freezing it in time and removing it from the universe. The sudden disappearance of Gallifrey left the Daleks firing upon and subsequently annihilating themselves, while the Time Lords remained, albeit powerless and forgotten.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "The Stolen Earth" [...] (2008), both Davros {{and a red}} Supreme Dalek {{are seen}} as rulers of the New Dalek Empire. It is {{revealed}} that Caan forced himself into the Time War to save Davros from destruction at the Gates of Elysium. He took his creator to safety, but the ordeal from forcing himself into the time-locked moment allowed him to [...] "see all of time", although it left him insane but able to predict about a forthcoming showdown with the Tenth Doctor. While Davros provides scientific and strategic guidance, he is still essentially subservient to the Supreme Dalek. Davros used cells from his own body {{to create a new}} race of Daleks which begin stealing planets from across time and space, creating an artificial solar system. They are arranged {{in such a way that}} they uniquely channel energy that can be harnessed. These planets are placed in the rift in the Medusa Cascade, which is set a second out of sync from time, making it the perfect hiding place. Follow-up episode [...] "Journey's End" [...] (2008) shows Davros gloating that his plan is to destroy reality itself. [...] "The Crucible" [...] is revealed to be a gigantic space station that houses the entire empire and is used for experimentations with Davros' invention, the reality bomb. The bomb is a device that uses the energy of the 27 planets, and is powerful enough to cancel out even the slightest atoms outside of the Medusa Cascade. The Supreme Dalek plans to use this device to destroy reality itself, using Davros' genius and Caan's prophetical powers for guidance. Ultimately, the Daleks hope to make themselves the sole living race in the universe. The interference of the Doctor and his companions stops Davros' plans, who learns that Caan engineered it so the Daleks would be destroyed forever. With the Crucible exploding from all the Daleks self-destructing and the Supreme Dalek destroyed, the fates of both Davros and Caan are left ambiguous. In [...] "The Waters of Mars" [...] (2009), Adelaide Brooke recalls how a Dalek spared her life during the 2009 invasion. The Tenth Doctor concludes that the Dalek knew she was a fixed point in time, and thus could not kill her without threatening the laws of time. Subsequently, in 2009–2010 two-part special The End of Time, the Time Lords nearly escape the <b>Time</b> <b>Lock,</b> which would also release the horrors of the Time War upon the universe once again, including the full Dalek Empire, but this eventuality is averted by the Tenth Doctor.|$|E

Automation of the derivatisation process offers excellent repeatability, and the time between sample preparation and analysis was short and constant, reducing artifact formation. Retention <b>time</b> <b>locked</b> (RTL) gas chromatography-mass spectrometry was used, resulting in reproducible retention times and GC-MS profiles. Two approaches were used for data analysis. XCMS followed by principal component analysis (approach 1) and AMDIS deconvolution combined with a commercially available program (Mass Profiler Professional) followed by principal component analysis (approach 2) were compared. Several features that were up- or down-regulated in the different types were detected. (C) 2011 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A <b>Time</b> Action <b>Lock</b> is a {{state of}} a Real-time system at which neither time can {{progress}} nor an action can occur. <b>Time</b> Action <b>Locks</b> are often seen as signs of errors in the model or inconsistencies in the specification. As a result, finding out and resolving <b>Time</b> Action <b>Locks</b> is a major task for the designers of Real-time systems. Verification is one of the methods of discovering deadlocks. However, due to state explosion, the verification of deadlock freeness is computationally expensive. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present a computationally cheap testing method for Timed Automata models and pointing out any source of possible <b>Time</b> Action <b>Locks</b> to the designer. We have implemented the approach presented in the paper, which is based on the geometry of Timed Automata, via a Testing Tool called TALC (<b>Time</b> Action <b>Lock</b> Checker). TALC, which is used in the conjunction with the model checker UP-PAAL, tests the UPPAAL model and provides feedback to the designer. We have illustrated our method by applying TALC to a model of a simple communication protocol...|$|R

A lengthy <b>lock</b> <b>time</b> gives time for the shooter to drift off target, and so it is advantageous to minimize the <b>lock</b> <b>time</b> and reduce the window for error. Reductions in <b>lock</b> <b>time</b> are generally performed by lightening parts that move as part of the firing operation, such as the hammer and firing pin or striker, shortening to distance parts that move as part of the firing operation have to cover, and using a more powerful spring. Further reductions in <b>lock</b> <b>time,</b> to near zero levels, can be achieved with electrical primers.|$|R
