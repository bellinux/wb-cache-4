Although these may seem fanciful to modern eyes, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>better</b> preserved sites which share some features. Tutbury and Pontefract Castles both have similar gatehouses and chapels, and Tutbury's motte and Pontefract's curtain wall are also close in style to those in the illustrations. Sandal Castle has a multi-angular tower like those depicted, and this feature is confirmed at Melbourne by foundations which still remain.|$|E
5|$|Completely unskilled at combat, Quark {{stands to}} either lose Grilka or be killed. Worf again helps the Ferengi; using a special device {{implemented}} by Dax, Worf {{is able to}} control Quark's body movements from an adjacent holosuite and help Quark defend himself with a bat'leth. Although the device temporarily malfunctions, he ultimately defeats the bodyguard. The scene concludes with Grilka and Quark alone and enamored with one another. Worf opines to Jadzia that Quark is unworthy of such a great Klingon woman, and she counters that Worf's interest in Grilka is superficial, asserting that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>better</b> options awaiting him. Observing that Worf still fails to see the subtext in her hints, Dax initiates an aggressive romantic encounter. In the next scene, both couples are shown in the infirmary; Doctor Julian Bashir (Alexander Siddig) treats their wounds and quickly deduces {{the source of their}} injuries.|$|E
5|$|A sexual {{harassment}} lawsuit was filed against Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) {{in the previous}} episode, and she must take a {{sexual harassment}} training as a result. In addition, she cannot return to work until she is done with her training. Liz, however, cannot handle life without work, as she needs the stress. Her attitude changes when she meets one of her neighbors, Emily (Elizabeth Marvel). She understands how Liz feels because she was just like Liz and tells her <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>better</b> ways to live. Liz hangs out with Emily and her friends (Mary Catherine Garrison, Kerry Butler, and Christina Gausas), who spend majority of their time getting spa treatments and going shopping. Liz gets {{so caught up in}} their lifestyle that she forgets to watch her show, The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS). Not wanting to come back to work—as she is intrigued by her new friends' lifestyle—Liz sexually harasses her counselor, Jeffrey Weinerslav (Todd Buonopane). She goes back to hanging out with Emily and her friends, but soon discovers that they are a Girl Fight Club, which disappoints Liz. In order for her to get out, Liz needs to fight them.|$|E

25|$|Several {{bird species}} thrive on Niʻihau. The largest lakes {{on the island}} are Hālaliʻi Lake, Halulu Lake and Nonopapa Lake. These {{intermittent}} playa lakes on the island provide wetland habitats for the ʻalae keʻokeʻo (Hawaiian coot), the āeʻo (black-winged stilt), and the koloa maoli (Hawaiian duck). The critically endangered Hawaiian monk seal (Monachus schauinslandi) is found in high numbers on Niʻihau's shores. Robinson states that Niʻihau's secluded shoreline offers them a safe haven from habitat encroachments. According to Robinson, conditions <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>better</b> than the government refuges of the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands. When the Robinsons originally purchased Niʻihau, no monk seals were present, because {{they lived in the}} northwestern part of the Hawaiian island chain, Necker and Midway islands. They have been relocated to the main Hawaiian island chain by NOAA fisheries over the past thirty years, and some have found homes on Niʻihau.|$|E
500|$|Following the {{publication}} of the compilations Head Comix and R. Crumb's Fritz the Cat, Crumb received increased attention and Fritz the Cat {{became one of the most}} familiar features on the underground comix scene and Crumb's most famous creation. These stories served as the basis for a pair of film adaptations produced by Steve Krantz, Fritz the Cat 1972, directed by Ralph Bakshi, and The Nine Lives of Fritz the Cat 1974, directed by Robert Taylor. According to Dez Skinn, author of Comix: The Underground Revolution, the strip served as an inspiration for Omaha the Cat Dancer. In Graphic Novels: A Bibliographic Guide to Book-Length Comics, D. Aviva Rothschild criticized the stories printed in the collection The Life & Death of Fritz the Cat as being misogynist, racist, and violent. He felt that, [...] "They also tend to ramble, as if Crumb were making them up as he went along." [...] Rothschild concluded that, [...] "Even though Fritz the Cat is a classic, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>better,</b> more coherent Crumb books around." [...] The 1972 film adaptation of Fritz the Cat was ranked 51st on the Online Film Critics Society's list of the top 100 greatest animated films of all time and 56th on Channel 4's list of the 100 Greatest Cartoons.|$|E

Bill Lamb from About.com commented that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>better</b> songs on Good Girl Gone Bad, but [...] "Shut Up and Drive" [...] captures [...] "the spirit of summer {{just as well}} as Rihanna's first hit 'Pon de Replay'". Lamb further continued, [...] "The lyrics are pure fluff, and the vocals have the now familiar thin and reedy quality common to many of Rihanna's efforts. However, like any successful sports car, the look, feel, and speed of 'Shut Up and Drive' pull you in despite the model's shortcomings." [...] Quentin B. Huff from PopMatters wrote that [...] "Shut Up and Drive" [...] is a sassier version of Aretha Franklin's [...] "Freeway of Love" [...] and Michael Jackson's [...] "Speed Demon". He also stated that the song would have fit comfortably on Gwen Stefani's first album. Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine found that the song did not live up to its campy title, while Rodney Dugue from The Village Voice described it as simultaneously [...] "goofy and sexually daring". Andy Kellman from AllMusic also referred to it as [...] "a sleek, forthcoming proposition...as undeniable and rocking as Sugababes' 2002 UK smash 'Freak Like Me'". [...] "Shut Up and Drive" [...] won Most Popular R Song at the People's Choice Music Awards.|$|E

500|$|Researchers [...] {{from the}} SENSOR-Pesticides program {{published}} an article in 2005 in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) on pesticide poisoning in schools. The article, which included data collected by SENSOR, described illnesses in students and school employees associated with pesticide exposures. [...] The study found that rates of pesticide-related illnesses in children rose significantly from 1998 to 2002 {{and called for a}} reduction in pesticide use to prevent pesticide-related illness on or near school grounds. [...] The article generated media coverage and drew attention to pesticide safety in schools and to safer alternatives to pesticides through integrated pest management (IPM). [...] "he study does provide evidence that using pesticides at schools is not innocuous and that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>better</b> ways to use pesticides," [...] said study co-author Dr. Geoffrey Calvert. [...] Officials in organizations supporting the pesticide industry, such as CropLife America and RISE (Responsible Industry for a Sound Environment, a trade association representing pesticide manufacturers and suppliers), reacted strongly to the report, calling it “alarmist” and “incomplete” in its health reporting. CropLife America president Jay Vroom claimed that the report was “written without context about the proper use of pesticides in schools and [...] not mention the positive public health protections they provide" [...] and stated that pesticide use in schools is [...] "well regulated" [...] and can be managed so that the risk is low. [...] RISE president Allen James faulted the article for relying on unverified reports and said that evidence suggested that such incidents were extremely rare. [...] The increased awareness of pesticide use in schools influenced parents and other stakeholders in numerous states to call for the adoption of integrated pest management programs. [...] According to the National Pest Management Association, three more states passed IPM rules or laws between October 2005 and October 2008.|$|E
2500|$|However, Sondheim decided [...] "that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>better</b> {{places to}} start a show" [...] and found a new {{collaborator}} in James Lapine after he saw Lapine's Twelve Dreams off-Broadway in 1981: [...] "I was discouraged, and I don't know {{what would have happened}} if I hadn't discovered Twelve Dreams at the Public Theatre"; Lapine has a taste [...] "for the avant-garde and for visually-oriented theatre in particular". Their first collaboration was Sunday in the Park with George (1984), with Sondheim's music evoking Georges Seurat's pointillism. Sondheim and Lapine won the 1985 Pulitzer Prize for Drama for the play, and it was revived on Broadway in 2008, and again in a limited run in 2017.|$|E
2500|$|A {{study by}} the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in 2000 {{concluded}} that while fatal attacks on humans {{appeared to be a}} breed-specific problem (pit bull-type dogs and Rottweilers), other breeds may bite and cause fatalities at higher rates, and that since fatal attacks represent a small proportion of dog bite injuries to humans, <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>better</b> alternatives for prevention of dog bites than breed-specific ordinances. Given many media sources incorrectly reported that this study suggested that pit bull-type dogs and Rottweilers are disproportionately more dangerous than other dog breeds, the American Veterinary Medical Association whose journal published the original article released a statement detailing that this study [...] "cannot be used to infer any breed specific risk for dog bite fatalities".|$|E

Kurosawa biographer Stuart Galbraith IV, reviewing the Criterion Collection DVD, called the work [...] "archetypal postwar Ozu" [...] and [...] "a masterful distillation of themes its director would return to again and again... <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>better</b> Ozu films, but Late Spring impressively boils the director's concerns down to their most basic elements." [...] Norman Holland concludes that [...] "Ozu has created—in the best Japanese manner—a film explicitly beautiful but rich in ambiguity and the unexpressed."

[...] Dukakis replied, [...] "No, I don't, and I think you know that I've opposed the death penalty during all of my life.

I felt like I was given the minor league version of The Fellowship, with archetypes of characters I knew [...] Their names and stories seemed so irrelevant and uninteresting compared to the real thing." [...] However, he praised the graphics, calling the game [...] "a treat for the eyes and ears. The visuals are fantastic, much like the other The Lord of the Rings games. It's a phenomenal re-creation of Middle-earth that fans will totally drool over." [...] He concluded [...] "there are better RPGs on the market. <b>There</b> <b>are</b> <b>better</b> TLotR games on the market too.
