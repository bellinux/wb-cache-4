50|$|The subscapularis tendon lies {{approximately}} 3 to 5 centimeter {{under the}} surface. Quite deep for ultrasonography, and therefore displaying through a highly penetrative 5 MHz linear applicator {{is worth a}} try. And it really turned out to ease a detailed examination of the muscle which just abuts to the scapula. However, the so primarily interested tendon does not get mapped as closely as desired. As anatomical analysis showed, it is only by external rotation possible to see the ventral part of the joint socket and its labrum. While at the neutral position the <b>tuberculum</b> <b>minus</b> occludes the view. Summing up it is through an external arm rotation and a medially applied 5 MHz sector sonic head possible to display the ventral part of the joint socket and its labrum with notedly lower echogenicity.|$|E
40|$|In illegal hunting it {{is often}} {{possible}} only {{on the basis of}} morphological characteristics to determine the animal species. By the method of comparison there was performed the forensic analysis of roe deer and sheep osteological features. For the purpose of investigating the shoulder blade (Scapula) and shoulder bone (Humerus) comparative characteristics, there were used 6 shoulder blades and 6 shoulder bones of roe deer and 8 shoulder blades and 8 shoulder bones of sheep. After the skin, muscles, arterial, venous and lymphatic vessels as well as nerves were removed from the bones, they were thermally treated in an autoclave. Subsequently, the bones were placed in 3 % solutioin of hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) for bleaching and degreasing. Then they were air dried and then photographed. Shoulder blade (Scapula) is a bone plate (Ossa plana) roughly triangular in shape. Scapular spine (Spina scapulae) is much more prominent in roe deer with acromion blade in the form of spike, while in sheep it is shorter and ends with acrimion at a right angle. Shoulder blade cup (Cavitas glenoidalis) in roe deer is round in shape, and in sheep it is oval. Tuberculum supraglenoidale and Processus coracoideus in sheep are more and in roe deer less developed. Shoulder bone (Humerus) in roe deer is relatively long, slender bone with proximal convexity turned cranially in regard to the same bone in sheep, which is stronger and heavier. Tuberculum majus in roe deer is less developed, and in sheep it is in a form of solid bone protuberance. <b>Tuberculum</b> <b>minus</b> and Tuberositas deltoidea in sheep are more developed than in roe deer. At medial condyle (Condylus medialis) in sheep there is shallow and wide groove, while in roe deer it is deeper and narrower. On the basis of morphological differences of roe deer and sheep bones, it can be determined with certainty which animal spesies they belong to...|$|E
