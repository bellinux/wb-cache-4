5000|$|Many {{governments have}} criticized {{the failure of the}} United States to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, which was signed but not {{submitted}} <b>for</b> <b>ratification</b> by the previous administration. Former President Bill Clinton recommended that his successor not submit the treaty <b>for</b> <b>ratification</b> until the wording was altered to reflect U.S. concerns. Bush, who was opposed to the treaty, rescinded U.S. executive approval from the proposed treaty. In 1997, prior to the Kyoto negotiations, the Byrd-Hagel Resolution passed in the U.S. Senate by a 95-0 vote. The resolution stated that the United States should not be a signatory to any protocol that did not include binding targets and <b>timetables</b> <b>for</b> developing nations as well as industrialized ones, or that [...] "would result in serious harm to the economy of the United States".|$|R

On 12 November 1998, Vice President Al Gore symbolically signed the protocol. Both Gore and Senator Joseph Lieberman indicated that the protocol would not be acted upon in the Senate until there was participation by the developing nations.
