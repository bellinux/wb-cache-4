25|$|Crisólogo and Legasto {{began the}} novena, {{and on the}} third and fourth day, Legasto {{reported}} that she experienced a very strange feeling. This sensation, she said, was as though something heavy was moving from {{the top of her head}} down <b>through</b> <b>her</b> <b>body</b> before leaving her. Her health then gradually improved to the point that she travelled to the United States for further treatment. Before she left, she had a checkup; no pleurisy was found but the doctors found a benign tumor. She reported that she still felt some pain; despite the discomfort, she considers the pains she suffers as a blessing, an offering to our Lord in atonement for her sins.|$|E
25|$|At sunset Ra {{passes through}} the akhet, the horizon, in the west. At times the horizon is {{described}} as a gate or door that leads to the Duat. At others, the sky goddess Nut is said to swallow the sun god, so that his journey through the Duat is likened to a journey <b>through</b> <b>her</b> <b>body.</b> In funerary texts, the Duat and the deities in it are portrayed in elaborate, detailed, and widely varying imagery. These images are symbolic of the awesome and enigmatic nature of the Duat, where both the gods and the dead are renewed by contact with the original powers of creation. Indeed, although Egyptian texts avoid saying it explicitly, Ra's entry into the Duat is seen as his death.|$|E

25|$|The only clue into Marie de Romieu’s {{education}} is found <b>through</b> <b>her</b> <b>body</b> of work, which was {{heavily influenced by}} Pierre de Ronsard and classical writers such as Hesiod, Ovid and Virgil. It is speculated that she either learned from her brother Jacques, or at least shared some of his lessons. In 1584, some of her works appear as introductory poems in her brother’s poetic anthology, which included Latin translations. Since her poetry included translations of Renaissance Neo-Latin Poets, it can be inferred that she was proficient in Latin, which suggests {{a higher level of}} education than most women, and one only attained by those in the elite. She may also have been fluent in Italian due to her translations of Italian authors such as Petrarch. However, her fluency in Italian is not certain, for French translations of the works were available at the time.|$|E

She can create precipitation at higher or lower altitudes than normal, make whirlwinds travel pointing lengthwise in any direction, channel ambient electromagnetism <b>through</b> <b>her</b> <b>body</b> to generate electric blasts, flash freeze objects and people, coalesce atmospheric pollutants into acid rain or toxic fog, and, along with her natural ability of flight, summon wind currents strong enough to support her weight to elevate herself (or others) to fly at high altitudes and speeds. Her control {{is so great that}} she can even manipulate the air in a person's lungs. She can also control the pressure inside the human inner ear, an ability she uses to cause intense pain. She can also bend light using moisture in the air and her manipulation of mist and fog to appear partially transparent, and in later comics, nearly invisible.|$|E
25|$|Indira Gandhi {{was brought}} at 9:30 AM to the All India Institutes of Medical Sciences where doctors {{operated}} on her. She was declared dead at 2:20 PM. The post-mortem examination {{was conducted by}} a team of doctors headed by Dr. Tirath Das Dogra. Dr Dogra stated that as many as 30 bullet wounds were sustained by Indira Gandhi, from two sources, a Sten gun and a pistol. The assailants had fired 31 bullets at her, of which 30 had hit; 23 had passed <b>through</b> <b>her</b> <b>body</b> while 7 were trapped inside her. Dr Dogra extracted bullets to establish the identity of the weapons and to match each weapon with the bullets recovered by ballistic examination. The bullets were matched with respective weapons at CFSL Delhi. Subsequently, Dr Dogra appeared in the court of Shri Mahesh Chandra as an expert witness (PW-5), and his testimony lasted several sessions. The cross examination was conducted by Shri Pran Nath Lekhi, the defence counsel. Salma Sultan gave the first news of the assassination of Indira Gandhi on Doordarshan's evening news on 31 October 1984, more than 10 hours after she was shot.

25|$|In an {{alternate}} timeline {{referred to as}} Flashpoint, Artemis is the personal bodyguard for Hippolyta's sister Penthesileia. Penthesileia is upset by the upcoming wedding between Wonder Woman and Aquaman. She conspires with Aquaman's brother Ocean Master to stop it from happening. Penthesileia orders Artemis to disguise herself in Garth's armor in order to murder Wonder Woman on the wedding day. Hippolyta however stops the assassination from happening by blocking the attack. This ultimately kills Hippolyta in the process. Artemis is caught by Garth wearing his armor. She quickly defeats him and uses his unconscious body to frame him for the murder. Aquaman and the Atlanteans then visit Themyscira to negotiate for peace, while Artemis has bombs dropped on Themyscira. Later, Artemis joins the Amazons in conquering the United Kingdom, renaming it New Themyscira. During this same period, Artemis attempts to kill the resistance movement member Lois Lane. Although, Lois is rescued by Resistance member Britannia using the smoke grenades to escape, Britannia is seriously wounded by Artemis. Later, when Artemis and the Furies battle the Resistance, Artemis follows Lois and Britannia in Westminster's lair. She hits Britannia {{in the back with}} an arrow. When Lois prevents her attack, Artemis grabs her and attempts to kill her, but Britannia is able to reach her armour and kills Artemis by flying <b>through</b> <b>her</b> <b>body,</b> tearing it in half and saving Lois.|$|E

500|$|Wright {{initially}} rejected Lovecraft's [...] "The Call of Cthulhu", {{but eventually}} bought it, and printed {{it in the}} February 1928 issue. [...] This was the first tale of the Cthulhu Mythos, a fictional universe in which Lovecraft set several stories. [...] Over time other writers began to contribute their own stories with the same shared background, including Frank Belknap Long, August Derleth, E. Hoffman Price, and Donald Wandrei. [...] Robert E. Howard and Clark Ashton Smith were friends of Lovecraft's, but did not contribute Cthulhu stories; instead Howard wrote sword and sorcery fiction, and Smith produced a series of high fantasy stories, {{many of which were}} part of his Hyperborean cycle. [...] Robert Bloch, later to become well known as the writer of the movie Psycho, began publishing stories in Weird Tales in 1935; he was a fan of Lovecraft's work, and asked Lovecraft's permission to include Lovecraft as a character in one of his stories, and to kill the character off. [...] Lovecraft gave him permission, and reciprocated by killing off a thinly disguised version of Bloch in one of his own stories not long afterwards. Edmond Hamilton, a leading early writer of space opera, became a regular, and Wright also published science fiction stories by J. Schlossel and Otis Adelbert Kline. [...] Tennessee Williams' first sale was to Weird Tales, with a short story titled [...] "The Vengeance of Nitocris". This was published in the August 1928 issue under the author's real name, Thomas Lanier Williams.Weird Tales subtitle was [...] "The Unique Magazine", and Wright's story selections were as varied as the subtitle promised; he was willing to print strange or bizarre stories with no hint [...] of the fantastic if they were unusual enough to fit in the magazine. [...] Although Wright's editorial standards were broad, and although he personally disliked the restrictions that convention placed on what he could publish, he did exercise caution when presented with material that might offend his readership. [...] E. Hoffman Price records that his story [...] "Stranger from Kurdistan" [...] was held after purchase for six months before Wright printed it in the July 1925 issue; the story includes a scene in which Christ and Satan meet, and Wright was worried about the possible reader reaction. [...] The story nevertheless proved to be very popular, and Wright reprinted it in the December 1929 issue. [...] He also published [...] "The Infidel's Daughter" [...] by Price, a satire of the Ku Klux Klan, which drew an angry letter and a cancelled subscription from a Klan member. [...] Price later recalled Wright's response: [...] "a story that arouses controversy is good for circulation... and anyway it would be worth a reasonable loss to rap bigots of that caliber". [...] Wright also printed George Fielding Eliot's [...] "The Copper Bowl", a story about a young woman being tortured; she dies when her torturer forces a rat to eat <b>through</b> <b>her</b> <b>body.</b> [...] Weinberg suggests that the story was so gruesome {{that it would have been}} difficult to place in a magazine even fifty years later.|$|E
