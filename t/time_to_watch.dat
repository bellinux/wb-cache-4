25|$|Frank Solich {{was named}} the 28th {{football}} coach of the Bobcats on December 16, 2004. Prior to coming to Ohio, Solich spent many years {{as a part of}} the University of Nebraska football program, as a player, an assistant coach, and later as the head coach. Solich was head coach of the Cornhuskers from 1998–2003 where he directed Nebraska to 6 consecutive bowl games, including the national championship game in the 2002 Rose Bowl. Solich's impact on the Ohio program was immediate, as plans were put in place to renovate Ohio's football facilities and increase financial support for the football program. Also, Ohio was selected to appear on national television 6 times for the 2005 football season, a record for the program. Frank Solich's first home game as coach of Ohio was a memorable one, as Peden Stadium brought in its largest crowd ever at the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> the Bobcats defeat the University of Pittsburgh Panthers 16-10 in overtime.|$|E

Similarly, CraveOnline's William Bibbiani [...] "wouldn't have missed it for the world" [...] but qualified it by noting that the film often lacked [...] "cohesion and clarity".|$|E

Since there was not enough time for him to do his own research and maintain a monthly schedule, Brubaker hired Amy Condit as a research assistant. Condit, who is the manager of the Los Angeles Police Museum, supplied Phillips with thousands of reference photos. Phillips also bought some DVDs he thought might be useful, but never found <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> them.|$|E

Leaf's wrist had still not healed, and [...] doctors recommended surgery. After mediocre preseason performances, he was asked to accept demotion to fourth quarterback status on the team and accept a lower salary.

500|$|... "The Man in the Blue Flannel Pants" [...] {{was written}} by Jeff Westbrook and {{directed}} by Steven Dean Moore. It featured John Slattery, Matthew Weiner, and Kevin Michael Richardson as guest voices. Weiner is the creator, writer, and showrunner of the television show Mad Men, in which Slattery portrays the character Roger Sterling. The entire A-Plot of the episode was a parody of Mad Men. Homer transforms into the lead character from Mad Men, Don Draper, and Slattery's character Robert Marlowe shares similarities with Roger Sterling. Weiner's role in the episode was a brief cameo {{as one of the}} businessmen on the rafting trip with Mr. Burns. The lead actor of Mad Men, Jon Hamm, did not appear in the episode, but previously appeared in the season 22 episode [...] "Donnie Fatso" [...] as a different character. [...] "The Man in the Blue Flannel Pants" [...] even recreated a scene from Mad Men, in which a lawnmower runs loose in an office. In an interview with IGN in 2011, the showrunner of the episode, Al Jean, named Mad Men as one of the two television shows he always makes <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch.</b>|$|E

500|$|In {{winning the}} trophy, Manchester United {{became the first}} English team to be crowned European champions since the Heysel Stadium {{disaster}} ban in 1985, which had resulted in English clubs being excluded from UEFA competitions for five years, and also {{the first team to}} achieve a unique treble of the Premier League, FA Cup and European Cup in the same season. It {{was the first time the}} Treble had been won since PSV Eindhoven in 1988; it would not be won again until Barcelona beat Manchester United in the 2009 UEFA Champions League Final 10 years later. After becoming the first manager to achieve this honour, Alex Ferguson was made a Knight Bachelor on 12 June 1999 in recognition of his services to football, as well as a bonus from the club reported to be in the region of £350,000 (the players received bonuses of £150,000 each). In a post-match interview with ITV's Gary Newbon, Ferguson provided a succinct summary of the game: [...] "Football, eh? Bloody hell". After the treble was secured, much debate arose among English football fans as to whether the 1999 Manchester United team was the greatest club side ever, alongside past European Cup-winning teams. It was such a significant achievement for an English football club that Prime Minister Tony Blair took the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> part of the match and congratulate Manchester United from the opening of the new National Assembly for Wales in Cardiff.|$|E
500|$|When Gretta sees Dave {{accepting}} {{an award}} on television, she criticizes him for selling {{out to the}} music industry and she expresses her grievances {{with him in a}} song which she records on his voice mail. A remorseful Dave, who is back in New York to promote his new album, returns her call and asks to see her. After some consideration, she decides to meet with him and they critique each other's albums. Gretta feels betrayed by Dave's heavily commercialized rendition of [...] "Lost Stars," [...] a love ballad she had once written and composed for him as a Christmas present, believing that the true meaning of the song has been lost. Dave tells her that the audiences love when he plays it in the new way, and that their energy fills the room. [...] He believes that music is about sharing it with people, but Gretta tells him that's not what she intended for that song. Nevertheless, Dave invites her to come and hear him play the song at the Gramercy Theatre that weekend so that she can see the impact it has had on his fans. She arrives at the venue just in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> him play her original arrangement of the song. After tearfully watching him play and seeing the reaction of the crowd to their song, Gretta decides to leave the concert and cycles through the city with a smile slowly dawning on her face.|$|E

Of course, I would have to pay Stanton Friedman $10,000 — based on my long-standing wager that UFOs will never be proven real — but I would expect to become wealthy from the royalties of a new book titled Why Me, ET?. And instead of spending many hours each week 'debunking' UFOs, I'll finally have <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> some TV, go to the movies, and perhaps get to read a few non-UFO books for enjoyment." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1746 a {{bill was}} {{introduced}} in the Irish House of Commons [...] "for naturalising persons professing the Jewish religion in Ireland". This was the first reference to Jews in the House of Commons up to this time. Another {{was introduced in}} the following year, agreed to without amendment and presented to the Lord Lieutenant to be transmitted to England but it never received the royal assent. These Irish bills, however, had one very important result; namely, the formation of the Committee of Diligence, which was organized by British Jews at this <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> the progress of the measure. This ultimately led to the organisation of the Board of Deputies, an important body which has continued in existence to the present time. Jews were expressly excepted from the benefit of the Irish Naturalisation Act of 1783. The exceptions in the Naturalisation Act of 1783 were abolished in 1846. The Irish Marriage Act of 1844 expressly made provision for marriages according to Jewish rites.|$|E

There, he saw hundreds of civilians shot which confirmed that stories of reprisals were not all invented by the Serbs. Capt Vercoe, still unable to walk, was captured near Gornja Mutnica on 24 Mar 1944. Both men {{ended up in the}} notorious Oflag 4c (Colditz Castle). Vercoe was repatriated in Jan 1945 while Hargreaves was freed by the American troops in Apr 1945.|$|R
2500|$|When the DVD was released, Monsters and Critics {{said of the}} season, [...] "The {{second season}} of Body of Proof takes what worked with the first season and {{continues}} {{to build on the}} premise. The series still feels formulaic to me, but the cast make it worth taking the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> and help it overcome any short comings. The second season sees more medical mysteries and twist with each episode as Dr. Megan Hunt (Dana Delany) and her team are back to handle everything from a child kidnapping to a murder where the entire city could be suspect. Along with murder and other crimes, the team deals with a new romance and Hunt continues to work around strained relationships with her ex-husband and boss. The series still feels formulaic and doesn't quite fire on all cylinders for me, but season two was an improvement. The series leaves you wanting to see what will happen in season three.|$|E
2500|$|The Sun Run and Malvern Challenge {{were two}} weekend events for Scouts and Explorer Scouts in the United Kingdom held {{every year in}} July.

Lindhome took the <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>watch</b> the original movie and read an article in Vanity Fair about the film, giving her some familiarity with the story and her role when she went to audition. Lindhome says she finds her character [...] "creepy for no apparent reason", because the film does not attempt to justify why the three antagonists do what they do. The actress characterizes Sadie as being [...] "equally as bad as [...] ", being just as vicious as the others. Lindhome admits that early in production it was easier for her to detach herself from the violent character she was portraying, but as filming continued and the cast grew closer she says that it became more difficult and [...] "upsetting" [...] to perform some of the scenes. According to Lindhome, as a response to seeing how some of the scenes were affecting the women, the producers sent Paxton, Lindhome, and Martha MacIsaac to a spa for a weekend.|$|E

2500|$|Later {{that same}} season, the Green Hornet and Kato {{appeared}} in the two-part second-season episodes A Piece of the Action and Batman's Satisfaction, which aired on March 1–2, 1967. In the two episodes, the Green Hornet and Kato are in Gotham City to bust a counterfeit stamp ring run by Colonel Gumm (portrayed by Roger C. Carmel). The Batman's Satisfaction episode leads to a mixed fight, with both Batman & Robin and The Green Hornet & Kato fighting Colonel Gumm and his gang. Once Gumm's crew was defeated, Batman and Robin squared off against The Green Hornet and Kato, resulting in a stand-off that was interrupted by the police. In this episode, Batman, Robin and the police consider the Green Hornet and Kato to be criminals, although Batman and Robin were cordial to the duo in the earlier window appearance.
