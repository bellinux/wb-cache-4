40|$|Coal {{pyrolysis}} is {{a complex}} process involving {{a large number of}} chemical reactions. The most accurate and up to date approach to modeling coal pyrolysis is to adopt the Distributed Activation Energy Model (DAEM) in which the reactions are assumed to consist of a set of irreversible first-order reactions that have different activation energies and a constant frequency factor. The differences in the activation energies have usually been repre-sented by a Gaussian distribution. This thesis firstly compares the Simple First Order Reaction Model (SFOR) with the Distributed Activation Energy Model (DAEM), to explore why the DAEM may be a more appropriate ap-proach to modeling coal pyrolysis. The second part of the thesis uses the inverse problem approach together with the smoothing function (iterative method) to provide an improved estimate of the underlying distribution in the wide distribution case of the DAEM.

40|$|Abstract — Temporal classification, such as {{activity}} recognition, is a {{key component}} for creating intelligent robot systems. In the case of robots, classification algorithms must robustly incorporate complex, non-independent features extracted from streams of sensor data. Conditional random fields are discriminatively trained temporal models that can easily incorporate such features. However, robots have few computational resources to spare for computing {{a large number of}} features from high bandwidth sensor data, which creates opportunities for feature selection. Creating models that contain only the most relevant features reduces the computational burden of temporal classification. In this paper, we show that ℓ 1 regularization is an effective technique for feature selection in conditional random fields. We present results from a multi-robot tag domain with data from both real and simulated robots that compare the classification accuracy of models trained with ℓ 1 regularization, which simultaneously smoothes the model and selects features; ℓ 2 regularization, which <b>smoothes</b> <b>to</b> avoid over-fitting, but performs no feature selection; and models trained with no smoothing.

However, it eliminates noise and detects features at different scale levels by building or approximating the Gaussian scale space based on linear. Gaussian blurring does not respect the natural boundaries of objects and <b>smoothes</b> <b>to</b> the same degree details and noise, reducing localization accuracy. To solve this problem, we proposed an improved KAZE algorithm which can build stable nonlinear scale space. Firstly, the extreme points are detected through building stable nonlinear scale space. Secondly, The match result by optimizing the feature points and strictly limiting matching threshold is used to calculate geometric transformation model parameters between two image. Finally, we can use this geometric transformation model to restrict the search space for feature points matching. Experimental results show that the improved KAZE algorithm is significantly better than the before KAZE. Moreover, for detail and texture blurred images, KAZE and its improved algorithm have unique advantages compared to the SIFT...|$|R

To you, therefore, I owe the apology: and on you I expressly and earnestly desired Tobin to call and to explain for me, that I had been in an utterly incompatible state of bodily feeling the whole evening at Mr. Renny's; that I was much hurt by the walk home through the wet; instantly on my return here had an attack in my bowels; that this had not wholly left me, and therefore that I could not come, unless the weather altered. By which I did not mean merely its 'holding up' (though even this it did not do at four o'clock at Barnard's Inn, the sleety rain was still falling, though slightly), but the drying up of the rawness and dampness, which would infallibly have diseased me, before I had reached the Institution--not to mention the effect of sitting a long evening in damp clothes and shoes on an invalid, scarcely recovered from a diarrhoea.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, we {{introduce}} KAZE features, a novel multiscale 2 D {{feature detection}} and description algorithm in nonlinear scale spaces. Previous approaches detect and describe features at different scale levels by building or approximating the Gaussian scale space of an image. However, Gaussian blurring does not respect the natural boundaries {{of objects and}} <b>smoothes</b> <b>to</b> the same degree both details and noise, reducing localization accuracy and distinctiveness. In contrast, we detect and describe 2 D features in a nonlinear scale space by means of nonlinear diffusion filtering. In this way, we can make blurring locally adaptive to the image data, reducing noise but retaining object boundaries, obtaining superior localization accuracy and distinctiviness. The nonlinear scale space is built using efficient Additive Operator Splitting (AOS) techniques and variable conductance diffusion. We present an extensive evaluation on benchmark datasets and a practical matching application on deformable surfaces. Even though our features are somewhat more expensive to compute than SURF due {{to the construction of}} the nonlinear scale space, but comparable to SIFT, our results reveal a step forward in performance both in detection and description against previous state-of-the-art methods. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{estimate}} the general-equilibrium labor market {{effects of a}} large-scale randomized intervention in which we designed and marketed a rainfall index insurance product across three states in India. Marketing agricultural insurance to both cultivators and to agricultural wage laborers allows us to test a general-equilibrium model of wage determination in settings where households supplying labor and households hiring labor face weather risk. Consistent with theoretical predictions, we find that both labor demand and equilibrium wages become more rainfall sensitive when cultivators are offered rainfall insurance, because insurance induces cultivators to switch to riskier, higher-yield production methods. The same insurance contract offered <b>to</b> agricultural laborers <b>smoothes</b> wages across rainfall states by inducing changes in labor supply. Policy simulations based on our estimates suggest that selling insurance only to land-owning cultivators and precluding the landless from the insurance market (which is the current regulatory practice in India and other developing countries), makes wage laborers worse off relative to a situation where insurance does not exist at all. The general-equilibrium analysis reveals that the welfare costs of current regulation are borne by landless laborers, who represent the poorest segment of society and whose risk management options are the most limited...|$|R
40|$|The {{first part}} of this thesis is {{concerned}} with trend modelling of breast cancer mortality rates. By using an age-period-cohort model, the relative contributions of period and cohort effects are evaluated once the unquestionable existence of the age effect is controlled for. The result of such a modelling gives indications in the search for explanatory factors. While this type of modelling is usually performed with 5 -year period intervals, the use of 1 -year period data, as in Paper I, may be more appropriate. The main theme of the thesis is the evaluation of the ability to detect signals in x-ray images of breasts. Early detection is the most important tool to achieve a reduction in breast cancer mortality rates, and computer-aided detection systems can be an aid for the radiologist in the diagnosing process. The evaluation of computer-aided detection systems includes the estimation of distributions. One way of obtaining estimates of distributions when no assumptions are at hand is kernel density estimation, or the adaptive version thereof that <b>smoothes</b> <b>to</b> a greater extent in the tails of the distribution, thereby reducing spurious effects caused by outliers. The technique is described in the context of econometrics in Paper II and then applied together with the bootstrap in the breast cancer research area in Papers III-V. Here, estimates of the sampling distributions of different parameters are used in a new model for free-response receiver operating characteristic (FROC) curve analysis. Compared to earlier work in the field, this model benefits from the advantage of not assuming independence of detections in the images, and in particular, from the incorporation of the sampling distribution of the system's operating point. Confidence intervals obtained from the proposed model with different approaches with respect to the estimation of the distributions and the confidence interval extraction methods are compared in terms of coverage and length of the intervals by simulations of lifelike data...|$|R

For companies that produce to order it is not unreasonable to assume the company knows next period's revenue when periods are relatively short. Defense contractors, for example, know relatively well what next quarter's revenue will be. Hence the model describes income smoothing rather than earnings management. ...|$|E

40|$|Improved {{efficiency}} in manufacturing systems to achieve increased output and thus reduced production disturbances {{is a vital}} area. DES (Discrete-Event Simulation) can visualize and study the dynamic issues related to total {{efficiency in}} manufacturing systems. A methodology for production disturbance reduction is presented. Increased performance of manufacturing systems means not only enhanced value for the company {{but in the long}} run for the society as a whole. Manufacturing companies are the basis of a country which many other activities rely on. Different production improvement techniques, for example TPS (Toyota Production System), have been shown <b>to</b> <b>smoothe</b> production flows and raise overall quality. Implementation of production disturbance reduction ideas must be conducted according to all basic rules of manufacturing. Contemporary production improvement techniques based on supply chains between different suppliers and limited products in stock make it necessary to focus on production disturbance reduction. The presented methodology is based on three main stages: (1) planning and data gathering, (2) analysis and implementation, and (3) continuous improvement. The planning stage includes project plan, goal and objectives of the study, definition of production disturbances, gathering of input data and logics and the conceptual model. The analysis and implementation stage comprises DES model translation, verification, validation, and experiments. The experiments are based on alternative tests in production disturbance reduction to increase equipment efficiency. The enhanced results in the model should be verified before they are implemented in the real world. Continuous improvement of the proposed methodology includes improvement in model design, studies of production improvement techniques, training of operators, follow-up of implemented changes, investigations in measurement of production disturbances and key figures. The improvement process is a continuing procedure. A model is seldom so good that it yet can not still be improved. With feedback various variables can be altered and the DES model can be improved in several phases. The potential of the methodology was shown in several case studies. The industrial case studies showed improved performance of 6 %, 12 %, 14 %, 18 %, respectively. No larger investments were needed to increase the performance. The suggested methodology may enable in increase of total output in a manufacturing system if it is applied...|$|E
