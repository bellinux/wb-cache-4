5|$|Bach {{composed}} the cantata {{in his fourth}} year as Thomaskantor (musical director) in Leipzig. The text {{is based on the}} day's prescribed reading from the Gospel of Mark, the healing of a deaf mute man. The librettist is Georg Christian Lehms, whose poetry Bach had used already in Weimar as the basis for solo cantatas. The text quotes ideas from the gospel and derives from these the analogy that as the tongue of the deaf mute man was opened, the believer should be open to admire God's miraculous deeds. The cantatas for <b>this</b> <b>Sunday</b> have a positive character, which Bach stressed in earlier works for the occasion by including trumpets in the score. In this work, he uses instead an obbligato solo organ in several movements.|$|E

500|$|Film {{critic and}} radio host Michael Medved criticized New Line Cinema for agreeing to re-shoot scenes {{so that the}} film would receive an R rating from the Motion Picture Association of America to match fan expectations. He argued that the film would have grossed more revenue {{at the box office}} with a PG-13 rating, stating that the {{demographic}} most likely to be drawn to a movie titled Snakes on a Plane is males between the ages of 12 and 15. [...] "My fourteen-year-old son, Danny, for instance, felt a powerful inclination to go out and see the movie with his two sleep-over friends <b>this</b> <b>Sunday</b> night," [...] he explained, [...] "but I wouldn't permit it. It's rated R for good reason." [...] Medved ultimately awarded the film 2 1/2 stars out of 4 in a radio review, but said that he did so [...] "grudgingly." ...|$|E

[...] The Neu Leipziger Gesangbuch, which was the standard hymnal in Leipzig since the late 17th century, specifies Luther's [...] "Wär Gott nicht mit uns diese Zeit" [...] as one of five hymns for the occasion.

2500|$|The {{radio show}} was {{run on a}} tight schedule. It was {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} best organized broadcasts on the networks. Jim Jordan insisted that after the Tuesday broadcast everyone affiliated with the program must take a two-day rest. Nothing is done about the following Tuesday's show until Friday morning. Then Jim and Marian Jordan get together with writer Don Quinn and agency producer Cecil Underwood to talk the next script into shape. They work in a business office because they're convinced that the businesslike and efficient atmosphere helps them to get the work done in two hours. By Saturday morning, Quinn had the first draft of the script ready, and [...] "Fibber" [...] reads it, after which Quinn goes ahead to write the final, working script. He does <b>this</b> <b>Sunday</b> night, working all night and finishing Monday morning.

Tuesday morning the entire cast, including Billy Mils' orchestra, rehearse about four times, concluding with a complete run-through about three o'clock. At five-thirty, Pacific time, they go on the air. And this program of preparation never varies by much more than an hour from week to week.
