5|$|The James Tiptree, Jr. Award honours {{works of}} science fiction or fantasy that expand or explore one's {{understanding}} of gender. Thus, it often goes to works which deal directly or <b>tangentially</b> with gay, lesbian, bisexual or transgender issues.|$|E
5|$|In fluid dynamics, Couette flow is {{the flow}} of a viscous fluid {{in the space between}} two surfaces, one of which is moving <b>tangentially</b> {{relative}} to the other. The configuration often takes the form of two parallel plates or the gap between two concentric cylinders. The flow is driven by virtue of viscous drag force acting on the fluid, but may additionally be motivated by an applied pressure gradient in the flow direction. The Couette configuration models certain practical problems, like flow in lightly loaded journal bearings, and is often employed in viscometry and to demonstrate approximations of reversibility. This type of flow is named in honor of Maurice Couette, a Professor of Physics at the French University of Angers in the late 19th century.|$|E
5|$|Miyazaki's biggest {{addition}} to {{the plot of the}} book was the use of the war as {{a large part of the}} plot. In the book, the war is only <b>tangentially</b> referred to; the king orders Howl to find the king's missing brother Justin, because Justin's military skills are needed for a forthcoming war. Howl's frequent disappearances are because of his womanizing habits, which makes Sophie see him as a superficial and cowardly person. In the film, however, Howl disappears from the scene in order to transform into a giant bird and disrupt the battle plans of both armies.|$|E
5|$|The {{problem of}} {{counting}} {{the number of}} solutions to different types of Apollonius' problem belongs to the field of enumerative geometry. The general number of solutions for each of the ten types of Apollonius' problem is given in Table1 above. However, special arrangements of the given elements may change the number of solutions. For illustration, Apollonius' problem has no solution if one circle separates the two (Figure11); to touch both the solid given circles, the solution circle would have to cross the dashed given circle; but that it cannot do, if it is to touch the dashed circle <b>tangentially.</b> Conversely, if three given circles are all tangent at the same point, then any circle tangent at the same point is a solution; such Apollonius problems have an infinite number of solutions. If any of the given circles are identical, there is likewise an infinity of solutions. If only two given circles are identical, there are only two distinct given circles; the centers of the solution circles form a hyperbola, as used in one solution to Apollonius' problem.|$|E
5|$|Developing neurons travel {{toward the}} {{olfactory}} bulb along the RMS via glial tubes, which mark {{the division between}} the differentiated nervous tissue and the tissue with embryonic characteristics. Uniquely, the cells travel tangential to the brain surface, parallel to the pial surfaces rather than radially like most developing neurons. Neurons that migrate <b>tangentially</b> are typically believed to migrate independently of radial glia but in the RMS researchers believe {{this is not the}} case. Adult rat glial tubes have been observed via light and electron microscopy and described as a meshwork of astrocytic bodies and processes. They have been determined to be astrocytes based on the typical expression of GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) and more specifically as protoplasmic astrocytes based on their morphology. Furthermore, these glial cells were found to be positive for vimentin expression, a protein commonly found in embryonic or immature glial cells. The developing neurons are identified by their expression of the cell surface molecule, a polysialylated (PSA) embryonic form of the neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) called PSA-NCAM, as well as β-tubulin, a protein often found in postmitotic neuroblasts, proving the cells of RMS are committed to developing into neurons and will do so upon entry into the olfactory bulb. With the removal of NCAM, the neuroblasts scatter, proving the importance of NCAM in chain formation. The neurons form both clusters and chains along the lumen of these glial tubes.|$|E
5|$|The meeting {{lasted from}} morning to midnight, {{including}} {{the reading of}} the proclamation, the debate and the vote. There was no secret ballot; votes were heard one at a time and recorded in the minutes. The main themes of the debate were the legitimacy of the government and the authority of the Viceroy. The principle of retroversion of the sovereignty to the people stated that, {{in the absence of the}} legitimate monarch, power returned to the people; they were entitled to form a new government. This principle was commonplace in Spanish scholasticism and rationalist philosophy, but had never been applied in case law. Its validity divided the assembly into two main groups: one group rejected it and argued that the situation should remain unchanged; this group supported Cisneros as Viceroy. The other group supported change, and considered that they should establish a junta, like the ones established in Spain to replace the Viceroy. There was also a third position, taking the middle ground. The promoters of change did not recognize the authority of the Council of Regency, and argued that the colonies in America were not consulted in its formation. The debate <b>tangentially</b> discussed the rivalry between criollos and peninsulars; the Viceroy supporters felt that the will of peninsulars should prevail over that of criollos.|$|E

25|$|However, {{his work}} was only <b>tangentially</b> politicized and was {{primarily}} regarded on its artistic merits. George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend produced {{some of the first}} overtly political cartoons and caricatures in the 1750s.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} articles, pamphlets, and books {{directly}} or <b>tangentially</b> relating to Communism in America and the CPUSA is vast, numbering into {{the thousands of}} titles. For a selection {{of the most important}} titles, see Bibliography on American Communism.|$|E
25|$|Note {{that the}} triple ('(x),'(y),'(z)) yields the same {{solutions}} as (x,y,z), {{but with an}} overall reversal of orientation. Thus there are at most 8 solution circles to the Apollonian problem unless all three circles meet <b>tangentially</b> at a single point, when there are infinitely many solutions.|$|E
25|$|Cajal–Retzius {{cells were}} {{described}} to migrate <b>tangentially</b> in the marginal zone, a superficial {{layer of the}} preplate in the cortical neuroepithelium, According to some studies, this migration depends on {{the site where the}} cell was generated, showing a link between the origin, the migration and the destination of the cell.|$|E
25|$|Because low speeds are {{required}} for traffic entering roundabouts, they are physically designed to slow traffic entering the junction to improve safety, so that the roads typically approach the junction radially; whereas rotaries are frequently designed to try to increase speeds, and thus have roads that enter the traffic circle <b>tangentially.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Fourth Anglo–Dutch War (1780–1784) was a {{conflict}} between the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Dutch Republic. The war, <b>tangentially</b> related to the American Revolutionary War, broke out over British and Dutch disagreements on the legality and conduct of Dutch trade with Britain's enemies in that war.|$|E
25|$|Even in free space, {{longitudinal}} {{field components}} {{can be generated}} in focal regions, where the plane wave approximation breaks down. An extreme example is radially or <b>tangentially</b> polarized light, at the focus of which the electric or magnetic field respectively is entirely longitudinal (along the direction of propagation).|$|E
25|$|The latest {{episode of}} tectonic {{activity}} {{led to the}} formation of the lobate scarp, which actually runs <b>tangentially</b> to the ring of wrinkle ridges. This indicates that the ring, which may correspond to a buried interior basin ring, influenced the scarp formation. After that, the internal activity probably ended, and the surface was shaped only by relatively infrequent impacts.|$|E
25|$|In 1938, Langmuir's {{scientific}} interests {{began to}} turn to atmospheric science and meteorology. One of his first ventures, although <b>tangentially</b> related, was a refutation of the claim of entomologist Charles H. T. Townsend that the deer botfly flew at speeds of over 800 miles per hour. Langmuir estimated the fly's speed at 25 miles per hour.|$|E
25|$|For over a millennium, {{throughout}} the world, Buddhist practices {{have been used}} for non-Buddhist ends. More recently, clinical psychologists, theorists and researchers have incorporated Buddhist practices in widespread formalized psychotherapies. Buddhist mindfulness practices have been explicitly incorporated into a variety of psychological treatments. More <b>tangentially,</b> psychotherapies dealing with cognitive restructuring share core principles with ancient Buddhist antidotes to personal suffering.|$|E
25|$|Science {{magazines}} such as New Scientist, Science & Vie, and Scientific American {{cater to}} the needs of a much wider readership and provide a non-technical summary of popular areas of research, including notable discoveries and advances in certain fields of research. Science books engage the interest of many more people. <b>Tangentially,</b> the science fiction genre, primarily fantastic in nature, engages the public imagination and transmits the ideas, if not the methods, of science.|$|E
25|$|Normal {{rocket launch}} {{vehicles}} fly almost vertically before rolling over {{at an altitude}} of some tens of kilometers before burning sideways for orbit; this initial vertical climb wastes propellant but is optimal as it greatly reduces airdrag. Airbreathing engines burn propellant much more efficiently and this would permit a far flatter launch trajectory, the vehicles would typically fly approximately <b>tangentially</b> to Earth's surface until leaving the atmosphere then perform a rocket burn to bridge the final delta-v to orbital velocity.|$|E
25|$|Vortex tubes {{were used}} by South Africa in their Helikon vortex {{separation}} process. The gas is injected <b>tangentially</b> into a chamber with special geometry that further increases its rotation to a very high rate, causing the isotopes to separate. The method is simple because vortex tubes have no moving parts, but energy intensive, about 50 times greater than gas centrifuges. A similar process, known as jet nozzle, was created in Germany, with a demonstration plant built in Brazil, and they {{went as far as}} developing a site to fuel the country's nuclear plants.|$|E
25|$|Though not {{the focus}} of the test, {{calcification}} within the artery walls, located in the outer edges of atheroma within the artery walls, is sometimes recognizable on fluoroscopy (without contrast injection) as radiodense halo rings partially encircling, and separated from the blood filled lumen by the interceding radiolucent atheroma tissue and endothelial lining. Calcification, even though usually present, is usually only visible when quite advanced and calcified sections of the artery wall happen to be viewed on end <b>tangentially</b> through multiple rings of calcification, so as to create enough radiodensity to be visible on fluoroscopy.|$|E
25|$|To {{generate}} {{a signal that}} is detectable, approximately 50,000 active neurons are needed. Since current dipoles must have similar orientations to generate magnetic fields that reinforce each other, it is often the layer of pyramidal cells, which are situated perpendicular to the cortical surface, that gives rise to measurable magnetic fields. Bundles of these neurons that are orientated <b>tangentially</b> to the scalp surface project measurable portions of their magnetic fields outside of the head, and these bundles are typically located in the sulci. Researchers are experimenting with various signal processing methods {{in the search for}} methods that detect deep brain (i.e., non-cortical) signal, but no clinically useful method is currently available.|$|E
25|$|The 1970 Spanish film Tristana is only <b>tangentially</b> {{related to}} the Tristan story. The Tristan role is assumed by the female {{character}} Tristana, who is forced {{to care for her}} aging uncle, Don Lope, though she wishes to marry Horacio. This was followed by the avant-garde French film Tristan et Iseult in 1972 and the Irish Lovespell, featuring Nicholas Clay as Tristan and Kate Mulgrew as Iseult; coincidentally, Clay went on to play Lancelot in John Boorman's epic Excalibur. The popular German film Fire and Sword premiered in 1981; it was very accurate to the story, though it cut the Iseult of Brittany subplot.|$|E
25|$|The gas {{centrifuge}} process uses {{a large number}} of rotating cylinders in series and parallel formations. Each cylinder's rotation creates a strong centripetal force so that the heavier gas molecules containing 238U move <b>tangentially</b> toward the outside of the cylinder and the lighter gas molecules rich in 235U collect closer to the center. It requires much less energy to achieve the same separation than the older gaseous diffusion process, which it has largely replaced and so is the current method of choice and is termed second generation. It has a separation factor per stage of 1.3 relative to gaseous diffusion of 1.005, which translates to about one-fiftieth of the energy requirements. Gas centrifuge techniques produce about 54% of the world's enriched uranium.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to {{a popular}} myth, the AMC V8 was not built by Ford or anyone else {{although}} it bears an uncanny resemblance to the later Buick V8 engines (400, 430, 455). It shares the same design employing a timing gear case that mounts both distributor and oil pump. It also shares the same oiling scheme employing a single passage to feed both cam and crank from the right lifter bank by <b>tangentially</b> intersecting the cam bore instead of two drilled passages, one from the cam to crank and another from the crank to the right lifter bank. Some electrical parts (starter and distributor) were shared with Fords, and some models used Motorcraft (Ford) carburetors, but {{the balance of the}} engine design is unique.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} development, the human {{central nervous system}} is often {{classified}} based on the original three primitive vesicles from which it develops: These primary vesicles form in the normal development of the neural tube of the embryo and initially include the prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon, in rostral to caudal (from head to tail) orientation. Later in development {{of the nervous system}} each section itself turns into smaller components. During development, the cells that migrate <b>tangentially</b> to form the basal ganglia are directed by the lateral and medial ganglionic eminences. The following table demonstrates this developmental classification and traces it to the anatomic structures found in the basal ganglia. The structures relevant to the basal ganglia are shown in bold.|$|E
25|$|Cruikshank {{was later}} {{transferred}} to a Methodist church in New Haven, Connecticut, where he continued his social work. Cruikshank worked closely with local labor unions, eventually splitting his time between pastoral work and union organizing. He became close friends with Frank Fenton, who later became the director of organizing for the American Federation of Labor (AFL). Working with the Connecticut AFL-CIO, he organized unions {{at a number of}} local businesses—even serving briefly as the business agent for a local of the UE at the Whitney Blake Company. He also became <b>tangentially</b> involved in the Workers' Education Bureau of America. But Cruikshank was dissatisfied with pastoral work. He saw his career as a pastor taking him away from felt that people's needs were so great that in 1936, Cruikshank moved to Washington, D.C. and took a series of government jobs. He first worked for the Farm Security Administration (FSA) as a labor relations officer. He later transferred to the FSA's Migratory Farm Labor Program, where he worked to establish several hundred camps for farm workers migrating out of the Dust Bowl—a program later made famous in John Steinbeck's novel The Grapes of Wrath.|$|E
25|$|In January 1946 Beria {{resigned}} {{as chief of}} the NKVD while retaining general control over national security matters as Deputy Prime Minister and Curator of the Organs of State Security under Stalin. However, the new NKVD chief, Sergei Kruglov, was not a Beria man. Also, {{by the summer of}} 1946, Beria's man Vsevolod Nikolayevich Merkulov was replaced as head of the Ministry for State Security (MGB) by Viktor Abakumov. Abakumov had headed SMERSH from 1943 to 1946; his relationship with Beria involved close collaboration (since Abakumov owed his rise to Beria's support and esteem), but also rivalry. Stalin had begun to encourage Abakumov to form his own network inside the MGB to counter Beria's dominance of the power ministries. Kruglov and Abakumov moved expeditiously to replace Beria's men in the security apparatus leadership with new people. Very soon Deputy Minister Stepan Mamulov of the Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs was the only close Beria ally left outside foreign intelligence, on which Beria kept a grip. In the following months, Abakumov started carrying out important operations without consulting Beria, often working in tandem with Zhdanov, and sometimes on Stalin's direct orders. Some observers argue that these operations were aimed – initially <b>tangentially,</b> but with time more directly – at Beria.|$|E
500|$|Due to Bungie's {{commitment}} {{to the development of}} Halo 2 during I Love Bees run, they were unable to assist 42 Entertainment with story creation, and so the ARG's story is only <b>tangentially</b> related to the main Halo storyline. The events of I Love Bees were, therefore, originally not considered to be Halo canon. In a 2006 interview, however, Bungie's content manager Frank O'Connor expressly confirmed that I Love Bees is part of [...] "things that we embrace as canon." [...] References to elements of I Love Bees have since appeared in the 2006 Halo Graphic Novel and the 2009 Halo Encyclopedia, both of which are official canon.|$|E
500|$|Kroonland was <b>tangentially</b> {{involved}} in a more sinister affair in July 1910. American physician Hawley Crippen and his lover, Ethel La Neve, had fled England after the circumstances around his wife's death were questioned. After a {{body was found in}} the basement of Crippen's North London residence, Scotland Yard Chief Inspector Walter Dew sought the couple for murder charges. One theory had the couple sailing from Dover on Kroonland, but when inspected in New York on arrival, Crippen and Le Neve were not to be found. The fleeing couple had instead sailed from Antwerp on the Canadian Pacific liner [...] Crippen, identified during Montroses crossing, was arrested, convicted of his wife's murder, and hanged; La Neve was acquitted.|$|E

They are yellow, and stain reddish-brown when bruised. The yellow pores are large (1–2mm diameter) and angular, and tend to become darker as they age. The pores are slightly wider than long, so that there are about 9–10 pores per centimeter measured radially, but 12 to 13 per centimeter when measured <b>tangentially,</b> about halfway to the edge. [...] As is the case with all boletes, spores form on the inner surfaces of the tubes and sift through their openings to be borne away on the air currents outside.|$|E
500|$|Whatever {{the true}} story of the {{rebellion}} on the ice, neither Worsley nor McNish ever mentioned the incident in writing. Shackleton omitted it entirely from South, his account of the expedition, and referred to it only <b>tangentially</b> in his diary: [...] "Everyone working well except the carpenter. I shall never forget him in this time of strain and stress". The event was recorded in the ship's log, but the log entry was struck during the sea voyage in the James Caird, Shackleton being impressed by the carpenter's show of [...] "grit and spirit". Nevertheless, McNish's name appeared on the list of the four men not recommended for the Polar Medal in the letter sent by Shackleton on his return.

500|$|The Ecstatic was {{packaged}} {{with few}} liner notes and a two-sheet booklet featuring {{a photo of}} Mos Def taken using the Photo Booth software application. The front cover photo reproduced a still in red tint from Killer of Sheep, a low-budget 1978 film by Charles Burnett about African-American life in 1970s Watts, Los Angeles. According to Dale Eisinger from Complex, the [...] "subtle and still-moving" [...] front cover photo reflected the ideas of cultural justice and global inequality present throughout Mos Def's career while capturing the [...] "sonic construction" [...] of The Ecstatics music.
