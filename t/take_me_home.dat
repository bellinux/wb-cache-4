5|$|The album's {{songs are}} characterised by metronomic pop, vocal harmonies, hand claps, {{prominent}} electric guitar riffs, bright synthesizers, a homogeneous sound and message, and rotations of lead vocals. The members' voices are presented individually on the record, and its lyricism speaks of falling in love, unrequited love, the insistence that flaws are what {{make a person}} unique, commitment, jealousy, and longing for past significant others. <b>Take</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Home</b> garnered mostly positive reviews from music critics. There was praise for its quality of production, while criticism hinged on its generic, rushed nature.|$|E
5|$|The Official Charts Company {{revealed}} that One Direction had sold 2,425,000 {{records in the}} UK by February 2013.

5|$|Globally, {{the album}} topped the charts {{in more than}} 35 countries, and was the fourth best-selling album of 2012, selling 4.4 million units. The album's number-one debut on the US Billboard 200 chart made One Direction the first group to bow atop the Billboard 200 with their first two albums since American girl group Danity Kane entered with Welcome to the Dollhouse in 2008 and their self-titled debut in 2006. One Direction also became the second act in 2012 to achieve two number-one albums within a 12-month period, and the first boy band in US chart history to land two number-one albums in a {{calendar}} year. Their debut album and <b>Take</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Home</b> were the third and fifth best-selling albums of 2012 in the United States, respectively, making the band the first act to place two albums in the year-end top five in the Nielsen SoundScan era.|$|E

5|$|In Europe, {{the album}} was {{similarly}} successful. It debuted at {{number one on the}} UK Albums Chart as the Official Charts Company predicted, with 136,391 copies sold in its first week, thus becoming the third fastest-selling album recorded by an artist in 2012, after Mumford & Sons's Babel, and <b>Take</b> <b>Me</b> <b>Home</b> by One Direction. It first brought total sales to over 100,000 copies in the United Kingdom, thus earning a Gold certification, but was later certified three times Platinum by the British Phonographic Industry (BPI). It has sold over 987,000 copies in the UK as of November 2016. In France, Unorthodox Jukebox debuted in the top ten and spent the whole year within the top twenty, except for two weeks.

As of 2014, the record sold 580,000 units in that territory. In Switzerland, the album debuted atop the charts and was certified Platinum, while opening at number four on the Danish Albums Chart and earning a Gold disc there after five months.

Columbia Records allowed the record to stream in full on iTunes in the week leading up to its 13 November 2012 release. In addition, One Direction promoted the album {{in a series of}} live appearances from October toward December, notably on television programmes The X Factor USA, The X Factor UK, The Today Show, which drew a record crowd of 15.000 people to the Rockefeller Center, and the BBC's Children in Need 2012 telethon. Additional live appearances include at the Royal Variety Performance, in the presence of Queen Elizabeth II, the Bambi Awards, and a headlining sold-out show at New York City's Madison Square Garden.
