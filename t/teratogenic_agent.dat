40|$|The {{development}} of effective methods for prevention of embryo disorders and congenital defects {{appears to be}} one of the cardinal tasks of modern medicine. The {{development of}} man and the health of future generations depends upon a successful solution to this complex problem. The etiology of congenital defects in humans is multifactored since they occur as a result of the injurious effect of environmental <b>agents</b> (so-called <b>teratogenic</b> <b>agents)</b> or because of genetic factors (mutant genes and chromosome aberrations). They also occur as a result of the combined effects of <b>teratogenic</b> <b>agents</b> and genetic factors. The latter is the most frequent etiology of developmental abnormalities.

40|$|Objectives: To {{study the}} overall and {{individual}} incidence of clinically detectable congenital malformations in newborns delivered at a tertiary hospital {{and to find}} out the associated maternal factors. Methodology: The present study is a prospective study of all the newborns delivered at Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, SSG Hospital, Baroda for a period of one year in which total 4058 consecutively born babies were examined for all visible structural anomalies and associated maternal factors were studied.

It is therefore urgent to better define the spectrum of anomalies observed in infected fetuses to provide adequate parental counseling. In this review, we provide a comprehensive analysis of major cases described to date and highlight specific prenatal and postnatal radiological findings of congenital ZIKV infection.
