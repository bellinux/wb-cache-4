Data on the time-frequency spread of masking evoked by a single Gaussian-shaped <b>tone</b> <b>pulse</b> are presented in an accompanying study at the same conference (Necciari et al.). The current study gathers data on the additivity of masking by up to four, approximately equally effective Gaussian maskers (ERB= 600 Hz, ERD= 1. 7 ms), separated either along the time or the frequency axis. For temporal shift, the amount of masking increases with the number of maskers, with excess masking (exceeding linear additivity) of up to 25 dB. For frequency separation excess masking amounts up to 15 dB, and the higher-frequency masker (relative to the target) contributes more to the additivity than the lower-frequency maskers. The data suggest strong basilar membrane compressivity even for such short stimuli. Combined with the single masker time-frequency spread data, these data may serve as a basis for modeling time-frequency masking effects in complex signals...|$|E

Objective The aim of the present study is to assess temporal resolution and active auditory discrimination skill in vocal musicians. Method The study participants included 15 vocal musicians with a minimum professional experience of 5 years of music exposure, within the age range of 20 to 30 years old, as the experimental group, while 15 age-matched non-musicians served as the control group. We used duration discrimination using pure-tones, pulse-train duration discrimination, and gap detection threshold tasks to assess temporal processing skills in both groups. Similarly, we assessed active auditory discrimination skill in both groups using Differential Limen of Frequency (DLF). All tasks were done using MATLab software installed in a personal computer at 40 dBSL with maximum likelihood procedure. The collected data were analyzed using SPSS (version 17. 0).

Anesthetized guinea pigs were inoculated intracranially with 7. 5 log 10 CFU of either (i) wild-type Streptococcus pneumoniae D 39 (n = 8), (ii) PLN-A, a defined isogenic derivative of D 39 deficient in pneumolysin (n = 5), or (iii) deltaNA 1, a new derivative of D 39 deficient in neuraminidase constructed by insertion-duplication mutagenesis of the nanA gene (n = 5). To quantify hearing loss, the auditory nerve compound action potential evoked by a <b>tone</b> <b>pulse</b> was recorded from the round window membrane of the cochlea every 3 h for 12 h. The organ of Corti was intravitally fixed for subsequent examination by high-resolution scanning and transmission electron microscopy. All animals sustained similar meningeal inflammatory responses. PLN-A induced significantly less hearing loss than D 39 over the frequency range of 3 to 10 kHz. Levels of mean hearing loss at 10 kHz 12 h postinoculation were as follows: D 39, 50 dB; deltaNA 1, 52 dB (P = 0. 76 versus D 39), and PLN-A, 12 dB (P < 0. 0001 versus D 39). The mean rates of hearing loss at 10 kHz were 4. 4 dB/h for D 39, 4. 3 dB/h for deltaNA 1, and just 1. 0 dB/h for PLN-A (P < 0. 0001 versus D 39). Suppurative labyrinthitis was universal. PLN-A induced the accumulation of less protein in the cerebrospinal fluid (P = 0. 04 versus D 39).

Behaviorally mediated, psychophysical {{measurements}} of passive sound localization acuity (minimum audible angle, MAA) have been determined in the bottlenose porpoise, Tursiops truncatus. A sub-adult male was {{tested in a}} pen acoustically open to Kaneohe Bay at the Naval Undersea Center facilities, Oahu, Hawaii. Localization thresholds were measured for pure <b>tone</b> <b>pulse</b> trains which varied {{as a function of}} 1) frequency (Horizontal, 6 - 100 kHz; Vertical, 20 - 100 kHz); 2) signal parameters (Horizontal, number of pulses, pulse duration and rise-decay times); and, 3) azimuth (Horizontal, 0 °, 15 °, 30 °, 330 ° and 345 °; Vertical 0 ° and 15 °). Localization capability was also determined for click trains containing 166 clicks each of 35 usec duration, centered at 64. 35 kHz at 0 ° azimuth in both the horizontal and vertical planes. Total signal duration was maintained at either 0. 5 or 1. 0 seconds. The discrimination task was of a spatial, forced choice, two alternative design. The MAAs for pure tones were determined at the 70 th percentile on the psychometric function of localization using a modified up-down staircase method of stimulus presentation. Click trains were presented using the method of constants and MAAs again were determined at the 70 th percentile of correct responses. Calculated MAAs were the mean of a minimum of seven sessions each containing an average of 60 - 80 trials (pure tones) or 90 trials (clicks). The animal maintained a fixed spatial relationship to two underwater transducers by biting a stationary bar (depth 77 cm) placed 18. 6 meters from and midway between the transducers. Sound pressure levels measured at the bite bar were 20 dB: re 1 ubar. The animal indicated the source of the signal by swimming to his right or left and hitting a response paddle. The experimental results demonstrate that the bottlenose porpoise is capable of localizing spatial positions of sound sources within 2 - 3 degrees in both the horizontal and vertical planes. Angular resolution of pure tones was greatest for frequencies of 20 - 60 kHz (MAAs: 2. 1 ° to 2. 5 °); and, MAAs increased at both higher and lower frequencies. The MAA of 3. 6 ° at 6 kHz suggests that the animal is using binaural differences in phase and time at lower frequencies and binaural intensity information at frequencies of 20 kHz and above as localization cues. It also suggests that the tissue overlying the ear and not the mandibular fat body is the main route of sound transmission to the middle ear at frequencies below 20 - 30 kHz. Pure tone thresholds were not significantly altered by changes in pulse duration (3 msec to 500 msec) or rise-decay times greater than 0. 25 msec. Horizontal localization capability to a pulsed 40 kHz signal significantly improved when the porpoise positioned 15 ° to the right or left of the midline between the two transducers (MAAs: 1. 7 ° and 1. 4 ° respectively. Increase in acuity at these azimuths is possibly a function of differential, binaural intensity information which would be greater in this situation than when the animal is at 00 because of the importance of angle of incident sound on the lower jaw (sound is funneled to the middle ear by the mandibular fat body). Maximal MAAs of 5. 3 ° and 5. 2 ° were measured at horizontal azimuths of 30 ° and 330 °. Greatest localization resolution occurred when the animal was presented click trains containing extremely fast rise times and a broadband spectrum of frequencies. The horizontal and vertical MAAs for click trains presented at 0 ° azimuth were 0. 9 ° and 0. 7 ° respectively. These low MAAs for click trains possibly result from the two transmission routes being used simultaneously in conjunction with binaural intensity comparisons and possible binaural comparisons of spectral characteristics in the central nervous system. The rigorous testing situation in pure tone experiments presented minimal auditory information to an immobile animal. This was necessary for determining what acoustic cues are most important for localization. The pulse durations and rise-decay times of the tested stimuli were much longer than that used in active sonar, and the information contained in broadband clicks was absent. The MAAs reported indicate the animal's capabilities only under restricted conditions; and therefore are conservative...|$|E

Where an area is marked as noisy if it is neither tonal nor pulsal. To investigate whether a similar separation indeed underlies human perceptual organization we introduce tract based descriptors: tonality, pulsality, and noisiness. These descriptors keep track of either the total energy or the cochleagram area marked as respectively tonal, pulsal, and noisy. Energy based tonality and pulsality is strongly correlated with the first perceptual dimension of human subjects, while energy based noisiness correlates moderately with the second perceptual dimension. We conclude that harmonic, impact and continuous process sounds can be largely separated with energy based tonality, pulsality and noisiness. Comment: 20 pages, 6 figures.

Furthermore, the model correctly predicts the nonlinear wave-V amplitude behavior in response to the chirp stimulation both as a function of chirp sweeping rate and level.

A model incorporating a compressive input/output function, followed by a linear summation stage, underestimated excess masking when using an input/output function derived from literature data for longer maskers and comparable target levels. The data could be predicted with a more compressive input/output function. Stronger com- pression may be explained by assuming that the Gaussian stimuli were too short to evoke the medial olivocochlear reﬂex (MOCR), whereas for longer maskers tested previously the MOCR caused reduced compression.
