5|$|The mansion at Wappocomo {{is unique}} among the {{historic}} residences along the South Branch Potomac River, in that its formal façade faces <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> {{and the western}} flanks of South Branch Mountain rather than toward the river. The original 1774 portion of the mansion is a square two-story Georgian-style structure, an architectural style prevalent in Virginia {{at the time of}} Wappocomo's construction. The bricks used to build the 1774 structure were manufactured in England, and used as ballast to stabilize ships loading tobacco in the James River. The interior of the 1774 structure contains a grand stairway in the center hall and all the original handmade woodworking. A stone addition to the mansion with two stories of deep verandas was completed in 1861. The principal passenger depot for the Potomac Eagle Scenic Railroad, Wappocomo Station, is located at the farm.|$|E
5|$|North of {{the railway}} line, the 156th and 10th Parachute Battalions became engaged with the German {{defensive}} line as {{they attempted to}} seize the high ground in the woods north of Oosterbeek. Both battalions' advances were blunted against the well-defended German positions and by early afternoon they had not advanced any further than their original positions. Urquhart—realising the need to assume a more defensive stance and prevent the two battalions being cut off north of the railway—ordered them to fall back to Wolfheze and Oosterbeek. Making a fighting withdrawal with the Germans of Kampfgruppe Krafft closely pursuing them, the units fell back across LZ 'L', defended by the King's Own Scottish Borderers who were awaiting {{the arrival of the}} Glider borne elements of the Polish Parachute Brigade. Heavy fighting ensued as the gliders arrived {{in the middle of the}} retreat and Polish losses were heavy. All four Allied units streamed south and west <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> crossings over the steep railway cutting at Oosterbeek and Wolfheze and gathered in ad hoc units in the woods on the south side, where most of them spent the night. Some German units followed them across the railway and an SS battalion reached Wolfheze where it was strafed by its own air force.|$|E
25|$|The {{last days}} of the Qing Dynasty were marked by civil unrest and foreign invasions. Responding to these civil {{failures}} and discontent, the Qing Imperial Court did attempt to reform the government in various ways, such as the decision to draft a constitution in 1906, the establishment of provincial legislatures in 1909, and the preparation for a national parliament in 1910. However, many of these measures were opposed by the conservatives of the Qing Court, and many reformers were either imprisoned or executed outright. The failures of the Imperial Court to enact such reforming measures of political liberalization and modernization caused the reformists to steer <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> of revolution.|$|E

25|$|During the shad bake {{lunch at}} Rosser's camp, two of Munford's pickets rode up {{to report that}} Union forces were {{advancing}} on all roads. Fitzhugh Lee and Pickett decided that since they could not hear an attack, due {{as it turned out}} to the thick pine forest and heavy atmosphere between the camp and Five Forks and an acoustic shadow, there was little to worry about. Soon after 4:00p.m., Pickett asked Rosser for a courier to take a message to Five Forks. Not long after that, two couriers were dispatched, the officers heard gunfire and saw the lead courier captured by Union horsemen on Ford's Road just across Hatcher's Run. Then they saw a Union Army battle line coming <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b>|$|E
25|$|White Battalion was now lifted into Vang Tai. While it marched east to join Green battalion, Bataillon Commando 203 (BC 203) was airlifted in by RLAF Sikorsky H-34s {{to secure}} Vang Tai and its {{airstrip}} while White and Green Battalions moved <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> intersection. As of 1 September 1969, air support {{was limited to}} 12 A-1 sorties daily, supported by a flareship by night and two forward air controllers (FACs) by day. On 2 September, Red Battalion was halted when it took 17 casualties in a brief clash with the communists. That same day, Green and White Battalions were halted by high water in the Se Thamouak River. Forcing a crossing two days later, they peacefully occupied the 9/23 intersection. On 6 September, Red Battalion joined them. At this point, the Rules of Engagement were changed to allow air strikes on Moung Phine.|$|E
25|$|Before {{reaching}} the 28th Gurkha Brigade Shimada's tanks were offered a perfect {{target in the}} form of Lt. Col. Cyril Stokes' 5/14th Punjabis, who were in marching order (long columns of units following each other) {{on either side of the}} road to Trolak. Stokes' Punjabis were heading up to reinforce Stewart's brigade. Commanding Shimada's three leading tanks was Lt. Sadanobu Watanabe, who led his tanks straight through Stokes' Punjabis, machine guns firing at the perfect target offered by the lined up soldiers. Lt.Col.Stokes was mortally wounded and his battalion suffered heavy casualties before Watanabe's tanks carried on <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> bridge (5/14th Punjabis mustered 146 officers and soldiers by 8 January). By 8:00a.m. the leading Japanese tanks were within Selby's brigade H.Q. area. The 28th Brigade were completely unaware of what had happened to Stewart's entire brigade and the Japanese tore through them faster, scattering both the 2/2nd and 2/9th Gurkhas, which were spread around Selby's brigade H.Q. Although they suffered heavy casualties many of the soldiers from these two battalions made it across the rail bridge before the main Japanese force got to their position.|$|E

2500|$|In 1978, King {{returned}} to his alma mater, the University of Maine at Orono, to teach for {{a year as a}} gesture of gratitude for the education he had received there. During this time his family rented a house on a busy road in Orrington. The road claimed the lives of a number of pets, and the neighborhood children had created a pet cemetery in a field near the Kings' home. King's daughter Naomi buried her cat [...] "Smucky" [...] there after it was hit, and shortly thereafter their son Owen had a close call running <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>road.</b> King wrote the novel based on their experiences, but feeling he had gone too far with {{the subject matter of the}} book, he discarded the idea of having it published, particularly since both his wife Tabitha and friend Peter Straub agreed Pet Sematary was too dark and unenjoyable. However, needing a final book for his contract King reluctantly submitted it to Doubleday on the advice of his wife Tabitha. The subsequent success of the book made King note how both Americans and British readers liked it despite him considering Pet Sematary too bleak in how [...] "it just spirals down into darkness. It seems to be saying that nothing works and nothing is worth it, and I don’t really believe that.” ...|$|E
2500|$|When Hooker {{received}} the {{report about the}} Confederate movement, he thought that Lee might be starting a retreat, but he also realized that a flanking march might be in progress. He took two actions. First, he sent a message at 9:30a.m. to {{the commander of the}} XI Corps, Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard on his right flank: [...] "We have good reason to suppose the enemy is moving to our right. Please advance your pickets for purposes of observation as far as may be safe in order to obtain timely information of their approach." [...] At 10:50a.m., Howard replied that he was [...] "taking measures to resist an attack from the west." [...] Hooker's second action was to send orders to Sedgwick ("attack the enemy in his front" [...] at Fredericksburg if [...] "an opportunity presents itself with a reasonable expectation of success") and Sickles ("advance cautiously <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>road</b> followed by the enemy, and harass the movement as much as possible"). Sedgwick did not take action from the discretionary orders. Sickles, however, was enthusiastic when he {{received the}} order at noon. He sent Birney's division, flanked by two battalions of Col. Hiram Berdan's U.S. sharpshooters, south from Hazel Grove with orders to pierce the column and gain possession of the road. [...] But the action came too late. Jackson had ordered the 23rd Georgia Infantry to guard the rear of the column and they resisted the advance of Birney and Berdan at Catherine Furnace. The Georgians were driven south and made a stand at the same unfinished railroad bed used by Wright's Brigade the day before. They were overwhelmed by 5 p.m. and most were captured. Two brigades from A.P. Hill's division turned back from the flanking march and prevented any further damage to Jackson's column, which by now had left the area.|$|E
