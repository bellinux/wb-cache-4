25|$|After being {{introduced}} by a college friend in 1965 to {{the producers of}} Take 30 an afternoon variety show run by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) Clarkson {{was hired by the}} Crown corporation as a freelance book reviewer. This marked the start of her nearly 30-year career with the CBC, as, after less than a year in her initial position, Clarkson was promoted to co-host, thus becoming one of the first members of a visible minority to obtain a prominent position on Canadian television. She remained with Take Thirty for a decade, while also branching into print journalism by becoming a regular contributor to such publications as Maclean's and Chatelaine. Similarly, Clarkson wrote and published her own romantic fiction novels: A Lover More Condoling in 1968, and Hunger Trace in 1970. Beyond these, her non-fiction book True <b>to</b> <b>You</b> <b>in</b> My Fashion: A Woman Talks to Men About Marriage a collection of interviews with men on the subject of divorce was published in 1971, during which time her first marriage had hit a hard patch.|$|E
500|$|One of my very {{greatest}} fears as a {{child was}} being ridiculed in public. And there it was coming true. As a television presenter, I'd been respected. People come up <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> the street and shake your hand and talk <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> a respectful way. And suddenly, overnight, this was transformed into [...] "Icke's a nutter." [...] I couldn't walk down any street in Britain without being laughed at. It was a nightmare. My children were devastated because their dad was a figure of ridicule.|$|E
6000|$|O thou bright moon! thou {{object of}} my first love! thou shalt not escape an invocation, {{although}} perchance {{at this very moment}} some varlet sonnetteer is prating of [...] "the boy Endymion" [...] and [...] "thy silver bow." [...] Here <b>to</b> <b>thee,</b> Queen of the Night! in whatever name thou most delightest! Or Bendis, as they hailed <b>thee</b> <b>in</b> rugged Thrace; or Bubastis, as they howled <b>to</b> <b>thee</b> <b>in</b> mysterious Egypt; or Dian, as they sacrificed <b>to</b> <b>thee</b> <b>in</b> gorgeous Rome; or Artemis, as they sighed <b>to</b> <b>thee</b> on the bright plains of ever glorious Greece! Why is it that all men gaze on thee? Why is it that all men love thee? Why is it that all men worship thee? ...|$|R

500|$|The tenor recitative, [...] "" [...] (If {{you wish}} to be called God's child and Christ's brother), {{contains}} extended arioso passages, to stress [...] "" [...] (the Christians' crown and glory) [...] and [...] "" [...] (back the heavy stones of sin). The voice and the continuo are at times set in imitation, an image for the [...] (following), as they go together to express the unity achieved, on the words [...] "" [...] (so that He may unite Himself <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> faith).|$|E
500|$|People {{from all}} around the world {{provided}} sympathy to the families and the community of Bath, Michigan, including letters from some Italian schoolchildren. One 5th grader wrote: [...] "Even though we are small, we understand all the sorrow and misfortune that has struck our dear brothers." [...] And another wrote: [...] "We are [...] praying to God to give to the unfortunate mothers and fathers, the strength to bear the great sorrow that has descent on them, we are near <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> spirit." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{continued}} to socialize and {{keep up with}} his correspondence well into his seventies, and his fame and popularity {{continued to}} soar. [...] "I don't believe that any man, in any country, has ever had a more affectionate admiration for him than that given <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> America", wrote Senator William C. Preston {{in a letter to}} Irving. [...] "I believe that we have had but one man who is so much in the popular heart". By 1859, author Oliver Wendell Holmes Sr. noted that Sunnyside had become [...] "next to Mount Vernon, the best known and most cherished of all the dwellings in our land".|$|E

500|$|The {{track is}} built on a {{recreation}} of electronic musician Aphex Twin's piano composition [...] "Avril 14th". The song begins with a minute long introduction sung by Legend. [...] "Blame Game" [...] has a lush, cello-driven production with predominant piano. After Legend's introduction, West raps his verses in a highly melodic manner, almost singing his lines. West's forceful delivery expresses hurt and contempt. The song's soulful sound juxtaposes West's angry lyrics: [...] "been {{a long time since}} I spoke <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> a bathroom, ripping you up, fuckin' and chokin' you". He subsequently raps less antagonistically and repeatedly confesses [...] "I can't love you this much".|$|E
500|$|In 1999, Lavigne won a radio {{contest to}} perform with the Canadian singer Shania Twain at the Corel Centre in Ottawa, before an {{audience}} of 20,000 people. Twain and Lavigne sang Twain's song, [...] "What Made You Say That", and Lavigne told Twain {{that she was going}} to be [...] "a famous singer". During a performance with the Lennox Community Theatre, Lavigne was spotted by local folksinger Stephen Medd. He invited her to contribute vocals on his song, [...] "Touch the Sky", for his 1999 album, Quinte Spirit. She later sang on [...] "Temple of Life" [...] and [...] "Two Rivers" [...] for his follow-up album, My Window <b>to</b> <b>You,</b> <b>in</b> 2000.|$|E
500|$|Four {{songs from}} the episode were {{released}} in the US as singles available for digital download: Taylor Swift's [...] "Mean" [...] performed by Jones and Salling, Jason Mraz's [...] "I Won't Give Up" [...] performed by Michele, Irene Cara's [...] "Flashdance... What a Feeling" [...] performed by Michele and Ushkowitz, and Celine Dion's [...] "Because You Loved Me" [...] performed by Ushkowitz as Rachel. [...] "I Won't Give Up" [...] is also featured on the soundtrack album [...] A fifth song, an excerpt of [...] "Always True <b>to</b> <b>You</b> <b>in</b> My Fashion" [...] from Kiss Me Kate, is performed by an unnamed male student (Derek L. Butler) singing in a master class for Carmen; it was not released as a single.|$|E
6000|$|... "To answer <b>you</b> <b>in</b> the spirit, Master Varney," [...] said Foster, [...] "were--excuse the parable--to fling {{sacred and}} {{precious}} things before swine.

6000|$|When sinks the soul, subdued by toil, to slumber, [...] Its closing eye {{looks up}} <b>to</b> <b>thee</b> <b>in</b> prayer, [...] Sweet the repose beneath thy wings o'ershading, [...] But sweeter still to wake and find thee there.|$|R
500|$|When {{the ground}} was finally cleared Gregory insisted, {{according}} to Harris, that Coulthard be replaced. When Harris would not agree, Gregory said, [...] "Then the game is at an end". Harris asked Barton whether he could claim the match on a forfeit. Barton replied [...] "I will give it <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> two minutes if the batsmen don't return". Harris then asked Barton to speak with Gregory to ascertain his intentions. When Barton came out he announced that Alick Bannerman and Nat Thomson would resume the NSW innings. They walked onto the arena and reached the stumps, but before they could receive a ball, the crowd again invaded the pitch, and remained there until the scheduled end of play. According to The Sydney Mail approximately 90 minutes' play had been lost. Lord Harris maintained {{his position on the}} ground, standing [...] "erect" [...] with [...] "moustache bristling" [...] among the spectators, fearful that his leaving the arena would lead to a forfeit.|$|E
500|$|Hellyeah {{received}} generally positive reviews. William Ruhlmann of Allmusic {{awarded the}} album {{three and a}} half stars out of five, commenting; [...] "Their album is a competent example of its genre, in which Tribbett and Maxwell combine to create crushing riffs over the pummeling rhythm section of Paul, while Gray howls typically enraged, expletive-littered lyrics to songs". However, Ruhlmann believes Hellyeah is not a notable variation from members' previous bands. Blabbermouth.net reviewer Don Kaye awarded the album 7 out of 10, praising the track [...] "Matter of Time" [...] for its slashing main riff, and [...] "One Thing" [...] as it [...] "marches to the finish line with a rumbling, crunching wall of guitars worthy of Dimebag himself". Kaye thought that Hellyeah's first studio effort was not equal to any of its members' main output. KNAC contributor Andrew Depedro stated [...] "it's a set of good songs recorded by 5 accomplished musicians from diverse backgrounds not letting their pasts define them and those songs {{in one form or another}} speak <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> different ways".|$|E
500|$|Elizabeth's senior adviser, William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley, died on 4 August 1598. His {{political}} mantle {{passed to}} his son, Robert Cecil, who soon became {{the leader of}} the government. One task he addressed was to prepare the way for a smooth succession. Since Elizabeth would never name her successor, Cecil was obliged to proceed in secret. He therefore entered into a coded negotiation with James VI of Scotland, who had a strong but unrecognised claim. Cecil coached the impatient James to humour Elizabeth and [...] "secure the heart of the highest, to whose sex and quality nothing is so improper as either needless expostulations or over much curiosity in her own actions". The advice worked. James's tone delighted Elizabeth, who responded: [...] "So trust I that you will not doubt but that your last letters are so acceptably taken as my thanks cannot be lacking for the same, but yield them <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> grateful sort". In historian J. E. Neale's view, Elizabeth may not have declared her wishes openly to James, but she made them known with [...] "unmistakable if veiled phrases".|$|E

500|$|... "SIR:– Among {{the members}} of the Legislature of West Virginia there is a general desire to express <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> some formal way their {{appreciation}} of the great zeal, ability and untiring industry that have marked your course in the Legislature this session. As chairman of the Finance Committee and one of the Judiciary Committee of the House, the duties incumbent upon you have been exceeding [...] important and exacting, both in committee room and {{on the floor of the}} House. In the performance of these duties you have been so zealous, industrious, painstaking and conservative as to attract the attention and win the respect and confidence of the entire legislature and to deserve thanks and gratitude not only of your fellow members but of the people of the state at large. Permit us, therefore, to tender to you some expression of our appreciation of the benefit of the State derived from your earnest labors to say that we all feel that you have fully deserved not only our commendation but a right to the gratitude and respect of your fellow citizens throughout the State of West Virginia." ...|$|E
500|$|Harry Clork and Doris Malloy put {{together}} a 34-page treatment which Laemmle approved in April. The pair completed their draft on May 20, 1935. Whale had Dan Totheroh re-write the dialogue and the draft was ready for submission to the PCA on July 15. When Breen reviewed the draft, his objections centered on the excessive alcohol use. [...] "We take this opportunity of pointing out <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> <b>in</b> regard to {{the matter of the}} treatment of drinking in this story, that, generally speaking, it is presented in a light, facetious, acceptable, amusing, and desirable mode of behavior. It is upon this that we feel rejection may be reasonably based." [...] A revised script with the drinking toned down slightly was submitted on July 24, the same day Whale started shooting. Remember Last Night? was budgeted at $385,000. [...] Whale inserted lines that made fun of horror pictures, a genre with which he no longer wished to be associated. Carlotta is shown jumping on a diving board flapping a towel and exclaiming [...] "Look, I'm Dracula's Daughter!" [...] and in another scene she says [...] "I feel like the Bride of Frankenstein!" [...] Shooting wrapped on September 14. Whale was nine days over schedule and $75,000 over budget.|$|E
500|$|After the {{boarding}} school was discontinued in 1850, Liliʻuokalani {{lived with her}} hānai parents at Haleʻākala, which she referred to in later life as her childhood home. Around this time, her hānai sister Pauahi married the American Charles Reed Bishop against the wishes of their parents but reconciled with them shortly before Pākī's death in 1855. Kōnia died two years afterward and Liliʻuokalani came under the Bishops' guardianship. During this period, Liliʻuokalani {{became a part of}} the young social elite under the reign of Kamehameha IV who ascended to throne in 1855. In 1856, Kamehameha IV announced his intent to marry Emma Rooke, one of their classmates. However, according to Liliʻuokalani, certain elements of the court argued [...] "there is no other chief equal <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>in</b> birth and rank but the adopted daughter of Paki," [...] which infuriated the King and brought the Queen to tears. Despite this upset, Liliʻuokalani was regarded as a close friend of the new Queen, and she served as a maid of honor during the royal wedding alongside Princess Victoria Kamāmalu and Mary Pitman. At official state occasions, she served as an attendant and lady-in-waiting in Queen Emma's retinue. Visiting British dignitaries Lady Franklin and her niece Sophia Cracroft noted in 1861 that the [...] "Honble. Lydia Paki" [...] was [...] "the highest unmarried woman in the Kingdom".|$|E
6000|$|... [Another parenthesis.--"We hope <b>to</b> see <b>you</b> <b>in</b> town, Mr. Titmarsh." [...] Foolish mockery! If all {{the people}} whom one has met abroad, and who have said, [...] "We hope <b>to</b> meet <b>you</b> often <b>in</b> town," [...] had but made any the {{slightest}} efforts to realize their hopes by sending a simple line of invitation through the penny post, what an enormous dinner acquaintance one would have had! But I mistrust people who say, [...] "We hope <b>to</b> see <b>you</b> <b>in</b> town."] ...|$|R
