5|$|His {{appointment}} in September 1990 as Personal Representative of the UN Secretary-General for Humanitarian Assistance Relating to the Crisis between Iraq and Kuwait required diplomatic finesse. Iraq's President Saddam Hussein was deeply {{suspicious of the}} UN, and was loath {{to do anything that}} would benefit the country's Shia Muslims. Despite this, Prince Sadruddin was able to successfully negotiate with Foreign Minister <b>Tariq</b> <b>Aziz</b> {{for the establishment of a}} UN relief program for tens of thousands of Shia Muslims trapped in worsening conditions in the marshlands of southern Iraq.|$|E

The dinner {{was attended by}} such notables as Iraqi foreign minister <b>Tariq</b> <b>Aziz</b> and Syrian defense minister Mustafa Tlass. Between 2000 and 2006 Atrash {{was a member of}} an organization in support of the Palestinian uprising against Israel. Between 2001 and 2006 he presided over the Syrian Arab Committee, which aimed to end the sanctions against Iraq and later support it after the 2003 invasion.|$|E
5|$|Together with {{partners}} from Egypt and the Arab world, Qandil co-founded the Eastern Satellite Communications Company in 1987. Its main {{purpose was to}} serve broadcasting station that would target Arabic-speaking communities in the Western world and to counter what Qandil perceived as Western bias in global media. However, in 1992, {{as a result of}} financial difficulties the company was sold and subsequently became the Middle East Broadcasting Center (MBC). Qandil worked at MBC for roughly three months until he quit, citing political differences with the station's managers, who considered him a Nasserist. That same year, he was offered to host his own show at Arab Radio and Television (ART), but initially opted to work on a project setting up a private Egyptian station for Al-Ahram. The station was not launched and Qandil took up a position at ART in 1996 where he hosted his own show called With Hamdi Qandil. Qandil's arrangements to interview Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi on the anniversary of the 1969 coup that brought him to power, and also <b>Tariq</b> <b>Aziz,</b> the vice president of Iraq at the time, aroused controversy among ART's managers. He quit thereafter.|$|E

25|$|On 26 October 2010, Saddam's top {{minister}} <b>Tariq</b> <b>Aziz</b> {{was sentenced}} to hang for persecuting the members of rival Shi'a political parties. His sentence was commuted to indefinite imprisonment after Iraqi president Jalal Talabani did not sign his execution order and he died in prison in 2015.|$|E
25|$|Because Saddam Hussein rarely left Iraq, <b>Tariq</b> <b>Aziz,</b> one of Saddam's aides, {{traveled}} abroad extensively {{and represented}} Iraq at many diplomatic meetings. In foreign affairs, Saddam sought to have Iraq play {{a leading role}} in the Middle East. Iraq signed an aid pact with the Soviet Union in 1972, and arms were sent along with several thousand advisers. However, the 1978 crackdown on Iraqi Communists and a shift of trade toward the West strained Iraqi relations with the Soviet Union; Iraq then took on a more Western orientation until the Gulf War in 1991.|$|E
25|$|On 26 October 2010, he {{was sentenced}} to death by the Iraqi High Tribunal, which sparked {{regional}} and international condemnation from Iraqi bishops and other Iraqis, the Vatican, the United Nations, the European Union and the human rights organization Amnesty International, as well as various governments around the world, such as Russia. On 28 October 2010, it was reported that <b>Tariq</b> <b>Aziz,</b> as well as 25 fellow prison inmates, had begun a hunger strike to protest the fact that they could not receive their once-monthly visit from friends and relatives, which was normally set for the last Friday of each month.|$|E
25|$|Pakistan Hockey Federation (PHF) {{has said}} that any player who participates in the WSH will be banned from {{domestic}} competitions. This declaration hinders the plans of several Pakistan hockey stars, including former captain Rehan Butt. FIH {{wrote a letter to}} PHF which clearly stated that the league is unsanctioned and national team members and players not part of the team too would not take part in it. Earlier, the FIH had stated that those who had signed their contracts before 28 March 2011 could play in the league, but now the situation has changed as FIH has termed the league unsanctioned. Apart from Rehan, Zeeshan Ashraf, Mudassar Ali, <b>Tariq</b> <b>Aziz,</b> Adnan Maqsood, Waseem Ahmad, Syed Imran Warsi and Shakeel Abbasi were signed to play in WSH.|$|E
25|$|Pakistan won {{its second}} Olympic Games {{gold medal in}} Mexico at the 1968 Summer Olympics. It fielded what has since then often been {{considered}} the best hockey squad ever led by captain <b>Tariq</b> <b>Aziz</b> with Saeed Anwar, Khalid Mahmood, Gulraiz Akhtar and Tariq Niazi. Even though Rasool had retired, this team was still {{a force to be}} reckoned with. They won all six of their games—against Kenya, Great Britain, Malaysia, Australia, France and the Netherlands during group play, and against West Germany in the knockout round. Pakistan made the final for the fourth straight Olympics, and won the gold medal, as they had in 1960, this time by defeating Australia, 2–1 with goals from Muhammad Asad Malik and Abdul Rashid. Rashid was the top scorer for Pakistan with seven goals; Tanvir Dar finished with six goals.|$|E
25|$|In 1987, {{the last}} Iraqi census counted 1.4million Christians. They were tolerated under the secular regime of Saddam Hussein, who even {{made one of}} them, <b>Tariq</b> <b>Aziz</b> his deputy. However {{persecution}} by Saddam Hussein continued against the Christians on an ethnic, cultural and racial level, as the vast majority are Mesopotamian Eastern Aramaic speaking Ethnic Assyrians (aka Chaldo-Assyrians). The Assyrian -Aramaic language and written script was repressed, the giving of Hebraic/Aramaic Christian names or Akkadian/Assyro-Babylonian names forbidden (Tariq Aziz's real name is Michael Youhanna for example), and Saddam exploited religious differences between Assyrian denominations such as Chaldean Catholics, Assyrian Church of the East, Syriac Orthodox Church, Assyrian Pentecostal Church and Ancient Church of the East, {{in an attempt to}} divide them. Many Assyrians and Armenians were ethnically cleansed from their towns and villages under the al Anfal Campaign in 1988, despite this campaign being aimed primarily at Kurds.|$|E

Qandil started his journalism career in the 1950s when he wrote for the Akher Sa'a ("Last Hour") magazine {{at the invitation of}} veteran journalist Mustafa Amin. In 1961 he began broadcasting a news show called Aqwal al-Suhf ("In the Press") until 1969 when he was appointed director of the Arab Broadcasting Studios Union. In 1971 he left his post in protest at a government inspection of his technical staff. He later worked with UNESCO from 1974 to 1986, specializing in the field of international media. In 1987 he co-founded a satellite broadcasting company that later became known as MBC, where he worked for three months before leaving because of political differences with its management. Qandil briefly presented the show Ma'a Hamdi Qandil ("With Hamdi Qandil") for ART, but left amid disagreements between him and his managers regarding Qandil's planned interviews with Muammar Gaddafi and <b>Tariq</b> <b>Aziz.</b>|$|E

2500|$|By {{the time}} of the 1977 census, Assyrians were being {{incorrectly}} referred to as either Arabs or Kurds. Assyrian Christians were forced to deny their identity as Assyrian nationalism was harshly punished. One example of this [...] "Arabization" [...] program was Iraqi deputy prime minister, <b>Tariq</b> <b>Aziz,</b> an Assyrian member of the Chaldean Catholic faith who changed his surname from Mikhael Youhana upon joining the Baath Party.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Tariq</b> <b>Aziz</b> ( [...] , born Mikhail Yuhanna, [...] , [...] , baptized Manuel Christo; 28 April 1936 – 5 June 2015) was Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister (1979–2003) and Foreign Minister (1983–1991) {{and a close}} advisor of President Saddam Hussein. Their {{association}} {{began in}} the 1950s when both were activists for the then-banned Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party. Although he was an Arab nationalist he was in fact an ethnic Chaldean, {{and a member of}} the Chaldean Catholic Church.|$|E
2500|$|When Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, <b>Tariq</b> <b>Aziz</b> {{served as}} the {{international}} spokesman {{in support of the}} military action. He claimed the invasion was justified because Kuwait's increased oil production was harming Iraqi oil revenues. He condemned Arab states for [...] "subservience to the United States' hegemony in the Middle East and their support for punitive sanctions." [...] On 9 January 1991, Aziz was involved in the Geneva Peace Conference which included the United States Secretary of State, James Baker. The goal of the meeting was to discuss a possible resolution to the occupation of Kuwait.|$|E
2500|$|When Rumsfeld visited Baghdad on December 20, 1983, he met Saddam Hussein at Saddam's {{palace and}} had a 90-minute discussion. They largely agreed on {{opposing}} Syria's occupation of Lebanon; preventing Syrian and Iranian expansion; and preventing arms sales to Iran. Rumsfeld suggested that if U.S.-Iraq relations could improve the U.S. might support a new oil pipeline across Jordan, which Iraq had opposed but was now willing to reconsider. Rumsfeld also informed Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister <b>Tariq</b> <b>Aziz</b> that [...] "Our efforts to assist were inhibited by certain things that {{made it difficult for}} us ... citing the use of chemical weapons." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mikhail Yuhanna (English: Michael John) {{was born}} on 28 April 1936, in the Chaldean Catholic town of Tel Keppe in {{northern}} Iraq, to an ethnic Assyrian family, members of the Chaldean Catholic church. [...] He studied English at Baghdad University and later worked as a journalist, before joining the Ba'ath Party in 1957. [...] He changed his distinctly Christian name to the more Arabic sounding <b>Tariq</b> <b>Aziz</b> to gain acceptance by the Arab and Muslim majority. [...] In 1963, he was editor of the newspaper Aj-Jamahir (al-Jamaheer) and al Thawra, the newspaper of the Ba'ath party.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Tariq</b> <b>Aziz</b> died on 5 June 2015 in al-Hussein {{hospital}} {{in the city of}} Nasiriyah, at the age of 79. According to his lawyer, he was being treated well in prison but suffered from ill health and simply wanted an end to his [...] "misery". The incarcerated Aziz suffered from depression, diabetes, heart disease, and ulcers. Aziz's daughter, Zeinab, claimed his body was stolen at Baghdad International Airport en route to Jordan by unidentified men on 11 June, but it was recovered the day after. Jordanian authorities said the body had not been stolen, but merely delayed until the relevant paperwork was filled out. Aziz was buried in Amman.|$|E
2500|$|Later that month, Hage {{met with}} General Habbush and Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister <b>Tariq</b> <b>Aziz.</b> He was offered top {{priority}} to U.S. firms {{in oil and}} mining rights, UN-supervised elections, U.S. inspections (with up to 5,000 inspectors), to have al-Qaeda agent Abdul Rahman Yasin (in Iraqi custody since 1994) handed over {{as a sign of}} good faith, and to give [...] "full support for any U.S. plan" [...] in the Israeli–Palestinian peace process. They also wished to meet with high-ranking U.S. officials. On 19 February, Hage faxed Maloof his report of the trip. Maloof reports having brought the proposal to Jaymie Duran. The Pentagon denies that either Wolfowitz or Rumsfeld, Duran's bosses, were aware of the plan.|$|E
2500|$|On 26 October 2010, the Iraqi High Tribunal {{handed down}} a death {{sentence}} against Aziz for the offense of [...] "persecution of Islamic parties," [...] amongst them the serving Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's Islamic Dawa Party, following a crackdown on a Shia uprising after the 1991 Gulf War. The Associated Press reports that [...] "the judge gave no details of Aziz's specific role" [...] in the crackdown. His lawyer stated that Tariq Aziz's role in the former Iraqi government was {{in the arena of}} [...] "Iraq's diplomatic and political relations only, and {{had nothing to do with}} the executions and purges carried during Hussein's reign." [...] His lawyer further stated that the death sentence itself was politically motivated and that timing of the death sentence may have been aimed at diverting international attention away from documents released by WikiLeaks, which detailed crimes in which Maliki government officials have been implicated. His lawyers have 30 days to lodge an appeal, following which the court would have another 30 days to look into the appeal; if the appeal is turned down the sentence would be carried out after another 30 days. On 26 October 2010 the Vatican urged the Iraqi government not to carry out his execution, and European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton stated that Aziz's execution would be [...] "unacceptable and the EU will seek to commute his sentence." [...] That same day, the human rights organization Amnesty International issued a statement condemning the use of the death penalty in this case, as well as for the cases of two other former Iraqi officials; the statement also expressed concern regarding the manner in which trials may have been conducted by the Iraqi High Tribunal. On 27 October 2010, Greek President Karolos Papoulias and the Russian Foreign Ministry both released statements urging the Iraqi government not to carry out the death penalty against <b>Tariq</b> <b>Aziz.</b> Also on 27 October 2010, a spokesperson for United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon was reported to have [...] "stressed that the UN is against the death sentence and in this case, as in all others, it is calling for the verdict to be cancelled." [...] On 28 October 2010, it was reported that some Iraqi Bishops and many ordinary Iraqis also condemned the death penalty for <b>Tariq</b> <b>Aziz.</b> Furthermore, according to the Wall Street Journal, [...] "several international human-rights groups have criticised the procedures and questioned the impartiality of the court." ...|$|E
