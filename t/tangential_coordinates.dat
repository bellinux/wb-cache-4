Titles of 29 works were given in the Royal Society Catalogue of Scientific Papers. They were republished, with additions, as A Treatise on Some New Geometrical Methods. The first volume, relating mainly to <b>tangential</b> <b>coordinates</b> and reciprocal polars, was issued in 1873; the second, containing papers on elliptic integrals and one on conic sections, came out in 1877. Booth was the independent inventor of the <b>tangential</b> <b>coordinates</b> that became known as [...] "Boothian co-ordinates", which, however, were previously introduced by Julius Plücker in 1830 in a paper in Crelle's Journal. The lemniscate of Booth, a figure-eight shaped curve, and the oval of Booth, another curve with a similar defining equation, are named after Booth, who studied them both.|$|E

50|$|A linear {{equation}} in line coordinates has the form al + bm + c = 0, where a, b and c are constants. Suppose (l, m) {{is a line}} that satisfies this equation. If c is not 0 then lx + my + 1 = 0, where x = a/c and y = b/c, so every line satisfying the original equation passes though the point (x, y). Conversely, any line through (x, y) satisfies the original equation, so al + bm + c = 0 is the equation of set of lines through (x, y). For a given point (x, y), the equation of the set of lines though it is lx + my + 1 = 0, so this may {{be defined as the}} tangential equation of the point.

The transformed conservation equations are solved numerically subject to physically appropriate boundary conditions using a versatile, implicit, finite-difference technique. The numerical code is validated with previous studies. The {{influence of a}} number of emerging non-dimensional parameters, namely with Deborah number (De), surface suction parameter (S), Prandtl number (Pr), ratio of relaxation to retardation times (λ) and dimensionless <b>tangential</b> <b>coordinate</b> (ξ) on velocity and temperature evolution in the boundary layer regime are examined in detail. Furthermore, the effects of these parameters on surface heat transfer rate and local skin friction are also investigated. It is found that the velocity is reduced with increasing Deborah number whereas temperature is enhanced. Increasing λ enhances the velocity but reduces the temperature. The heat transfer rates is found to be depressed with increasing Deborah number, De, and enhanced with increasing λ. Local skin friction is found to be decreased with a rise in Deborah number whereas it is elevated with increasing values of relaxation to retardation time ratio (λ). Increasing suction decelerates the flow and cools the boundary layer i. e. reduces temperatures. With increasing <b>tangential</b> <b>coordinate,</b> the flow is also decelerated whereas the temperatures are enhanced. The simulation is relevant to polymer coating thermal processing.

40|$|The thalamocortical {{projection}} to rodent somatosensory ("barrell") cortex {{is highly}} ordered {{in both the}} radial and the tangential dimensions. During {{a brief period of}} postnatal development, thalamocortical axons establish two tiers of terminations, in the deep layers and in layer IV, and form whisker-specific clusters within layer IV; however, {{little is known about the}} cues that guide them to their appropriate radial and tangential positions. To gain insight into potential mechanisms underlying this process, we studied the development of thalamocortical termination patterns in mouse barrel cortex at high spatial resolution. Developing thalamocortical axons were labeled in fixed slices with the lipophilic carbocyanine dye Dil and imaged with a laser scanning confocal microscope. On the day of birth (postnatal day 0, P 0) axons coursed through layers VI and V, with little or no branching. By P 2 the lower tier of terminations, at the border of layers VI and V, was clearly identifiable. Below this tier axons coursed obliquely or tangentially, forming a dense meshwork of intersecting fibers, but with no apparent branching. By P 4 the upper tier of terminations, in layer IV, was clearly recognizable, and consisted of periodic, dense clusters of terminal arborizations. In marked contrast to the oblique and apparently disorderly course followed by axons in layer VI and lower layer V, axons in upper layer V heading toward the upper tier were organized in loose bundles running radially, suggesting that axons destined to terminate in a particular layer IV barrel had already reached their appropriate <b>tangential</b> <b>coordinates</b> within the lower tier. Thus, the pattern of thalamocortical terminations in layer IV seems to be projected from the deep tier of terminations, and does not develop from an initially profuse arborization pattern through pruning of inappropriate branches...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} {{axisymmetric}} transonic flow {{is of interest}} {{not only because of}} the practical application to missile and launch vehicle aerodynamics, but also because of its relation to fully three-dimensional flow in terms of the area rule. The RAXBOD computer program was developed for the analysis of steady, inviscid, irrotational, transonic flow over axisymmetric bodies in free air. RAXBOD uses a finite-difference relaxation method to numerically solve the exact formulation of the disturbance velocity potential with exact surface boundary conditions. Agreement with available experimental results has been good in cases where viscous effects and wind-tunnel wall interference are not important. The governing second-order partial differential equation describing the flow potential is replaced by a system of finite difference equations, including Jameson's "rotated" difference scheme at supersonic points. A stretching is applied to both the normal and <b>tangential</b> <b>coordinates</b> such that the infinite physical space is mapped onto a finite computational space. The boundary condition at infinity can be applied directly and there is no need for an asymptotic far-field solution. The system of finite difference equations is solved by a column relaxation method. In order to obtain both rapid convergence and any desired resolution, the relaxation is performed iteratively on successively refined grids. Input to RAXBOD consists of a description of the body geometry, the free stream conditions, and the desired resolution control parameters. Output from RAXBOD includes computed geometric parameters in the normal and tangential directions, iteration history information, drag coefficients, flow field data in the computational plane, and coordinates of the sonic line. This program is written in FORTRAN IV for batch execution and has been implemented on a CDC 6600 computer with an overlayed central memory requirement of approximately 40 K (octal) of 60 bit words.

40|$|Axial {{positron}} {{emission tomography}} (PET) scanners are composed of layers of scintillating crystals aligned with the main axis of the scanner. The axial coordinates of photon interaction events are obtained using a matrix of wavelength shifting strips placed orthogonally to the crystals. This construction allows acquiring depth of interaction information of the events, which removes the parallax error enabling simultaneous improvement of the scanners' sensitivity and spatial resolution. In this thesis a computer model of the axial PET demonstrator called AvanTomography was built using GATE simulation toolkit. The model {{is based on the}} real demonstrator that is being constructed at Tampere University of Technology; the purpose of the model is to help in designing the demonstrator by enabling easy testing and characterisation using Monte Carlo simulations. This thesis describes the construction and validation of the model, and the initial results of performance testing. The model includes the demonstrator's modular structure with scintillating crystals and wavelength shifting strips, signal read out and processing electronics. The axial coordinates of events are determined by simulating event positioning with the strips. As GATE does not currently support such novel event positioning, a new processing module was written into GATE source code as part of this thesis work. This new module simulates analytically the transport and distribution of scintillation photons in the scintillating crystals and wavelength shifting strips, and processes the signals {{in order to determine the}} axial coordinate of the events. In addition, the module handles pulse adding and discretisation of event radial and <b>tangential</b> <b>coordinates.</b> The built model was then used to run simulations to study the model and the demonstrator system. Firstly, the model was validated for produced energy spectra, event rates, and axial coordinate determination. Scanner constructions having 2, 4 and 8 modules were tested for sensitivity, as well as the increase of sensitivity when radial layers of modules are added. Then scatter fraction and noise equivalent count rate were simulated using a rat sized phantom. The results show that the model can be used in simulating the functionality of an axial PET scanner, and could in future be used to determine the performance, including spatial resolution and image quality, of a full-scale scanner. As it is easier to make changes to the model than the real scanner, running simulations with the constructed model is an efficient method for testing planned changes before implementation...|$|E

The conducting sheet is modeled as an idealized hypersurface with an effective electric conductivity. The requisite weak discontinuity for the tangential magnetic field across the hypersurface can be incorporated naturally into the variational formulation.

40|$|The laminar {{boundary}} layer flow and heat transfer of Casson non-Newtonian fluid from a permeable isothermal sphere {{in the presence of}} thermal and hydrodynamic slip conditions is analyzed. The surface of the sphere is maintained at a constant temperature. The {{boundary layer}} conservation equations, which are parabolic in nature, are normalized into non-similar form and then solved numerically with the well-tested, efficient, implicit, stable Keller-box finite-difference scheme. Increasing velocity slip induces acceleration in the flow near the surface of the sphere and the reverse effect further from the surface. Increasing velocity slip consistently enhances temperatures throughout the boundary layer regime. An increase in thermal slip parameter strongly decelerates the flow and also reduces temperatures in the boundary layer regime. An increase in Casson rheological parameter acts to elevate considerably the skin friction (non-dimensional wall shear stress) and this effect is pronounced at higher values of <b>tangential</b> <b>coordinate.</b> Temperatures are however very slightly decreased with increasing values of Casson rheological parameter. Increasing mass flow injection (blowing) at the sphere surface causes a strong acceleration, whereas increasing suction is found to induce the opposite effect.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the derivation of a frequency domain theory and working equations for radiation of propeller harmonic {{noise in the}} presence of angular inflow. In applying the acoustic analogy, integration over the <b>tangential</b> <b>coordinate</b> of the source region is performed numerically, permitting the equations to be solved without approximation for any degree of angular inflow. Inflow angle is specified in terms of yaw, pitch, and roll angles of the aircraft. Since these can be arbitrarily large, the analysis applies with equal accuracy to propellers and helicopter rotors. For thickness and loading, the derivation is given in complete detail with working equations for near and far field. However, the quadrupole derivation has been carried only far enough to show feasibility of the numerical approach. Explicit formulas are presented for computation of source elements, evaluation of Green's functions, and location of observer points in various visual and retarded coordinate systems. The resulting computer program, called WOBBLE has been written in FORTRAN and follows the notation of this report very closely. The new theory is explored to establish the effects of varying inflow angle on axial and circumferential directivity. Also, parametric studies were performed to evaluate various phenomena outside the capabilities of earlier theories, such as an unsteady thickness effect. Validity of the theory was established by comparison with test data from conventional propellers and Prop Fans in flight and in wind tunnels under a variety of operating conditions and inflow angles...|$|R

Furthermore, the effects of these parameters on surface heat transfer rate and local skin friction are also investigated. It is observed that velocity, surface heat transfer rate and local skin friction are reduced with increasing Weissenberg number, but temperature is increased. Increasing m enhances velocity and surface heat transfer rate but reduces temperature and local skin friction. An increase in non-isothermal power law index (n) is observed to decrease the velocity and temperature. Increasing magnetic parameter (M) is found to decrease the velocity and increase the temperature. Overall, the primary influence on free convection is sustained through the magnetic body force parameter, M, and also the surface mass flux (injection/suction) parameter, fw. The rheological effects, while still prominent, are not as dramatic. Boundary layers (both hydrodynamic and thermal) are, therefore, most strongly modified by the applied magnetic field and wall mass flux effect.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The goal of the present work {{is the development of}} a numerical method for compressible viscous flows on mixed unstructured grids. The discretisation is based on a vertex-centred finite-volume method. The concept of grid transparency is developed as a framework for the discretisation on mixed unstructured grids. A grid-transparent method does not require information on the cell types. For this reason, the numerical method developed in the present work can be applied to triangular, quadrilateral, and mixed grids without modification. The inviscid fluxes are discretised using the approximate Riemann solver of Roe. A limited linear-reconstruction method leads to monotonic capturing of shock waves and second-order accuracy in smooth regions of the flow. The discretisation of the viscous fluxes on triangular and quadrilateral grids is first studied by reference to Laplace's equation. A variety of schemes are evaluated against several criteria. The chosen discretisation is then extended to the viscous fluxes in the Navier-Stokes equations. A careful study of the various terms allows a form to be developed which may be regarded as a thin-shear-layer approximation. In contrast to previous implementations, however, the present approximation does not require knowledge of normal and <b>tangential</b> <b>coordinate</b> directions near solid surfaces. The effects of turbulence are modelled through the eddy-viscosity hypothesis and the one-equation model of Spalart and Allmaras. The discrete equations are marched to the steady-state solution by an explicit Runge-Kutta method with local time-stepping. The turbulence-model equation is solved by a point-implicit method. To accelerate the convergence rate, an agglomeration multigrid method is employed. In contrast to previous implementations, the governing equations are entirely rediscretised on the coarse grid levels. The solution method is applied to various inviscid, laminar, and turbulent flows. The performance of the multigrid method is compared for triangular and quadrilateral grids. Care is taken to assess numerical errors through grid-refinement studies or comparisons with analytical solutions or experimental data. The main contributions of the present work are the careful development of a solution method for compressible viscous flows on mixed unstructured grids and the comparison of the impact of triangular, quadrilateral, and mixed grids on convergence rates and solution quality...|$|R
40|$|The {{flow pattern}} and {{distribution}} of energy dissipation rate in a batch rotor-stator mixer fitted with disintegrating head have been numerically investigated. Standard k-e turbulence model in conjunction with sliding mesh method was employed and the simulation results were verified by laser Doppler anemometry (LDA) measurements. The agreement between predicted and measured velocity profiles in the bulk and of jet emerging from stator hole was very good. Results showed that the interaction between stator and rotating blades generated periodic fluctuations of jet velocity, flowrate, torque and energy dissipation rate around the holes. The kinetic energy balance based on measured velocity distribution indicated that about 70 % of energy supplied by the rotor was dissipated {{in close proximity to}} the mixing head, while the simulation predicted that about 60 % of energy dissipated in the same control volume. Both simulations and measurements showed that jet velocity and total flowrate through holes were proportional to rotor speed, while the energy dissipation rate scaled with the cube of rotor speed. The effect of stator geometry on the flow pattern and energy dissipation rate was also numerically investigated using standard k-e model and sliding mesh method. The simulations showed that flow patterns in the holes were similar regardless of holes sizes and shapes, i. e. jets emerged in the proximity of the leading edge and they induced circulation flows behind them. The radial velocities of jets emerging from various stators plotted against normalized <b>tangential</b> <b>coordinate</b> were practically the same, however, jets tangential velocities were affected by hole width-to-depth ratio. Jets emerging from holes with large width to-depth ratio had negative tangential velocity component (the same as rotor rotation) while those from holes with small width-to-depth ratio had positive tangential velocity component (against rotor rotation). Jets emerging from stators with small hole spacing tended to merge and move tangentially, while those emerging from stators with large hole spacing tended to move radially as free jets. The power number correlated well with the total flowrate and the total flowrate correlated well with the total hole area. Both power number and flowrate were practically not affected by hole shape, hole spacing and stator thickness. For all stators investigated, high energy dissipation rate occurred in the regions around the leading and trailing edges due to stagnations in those regions. Stators with narrow holes generated more uniform energy dissipation rate profile around the holes than those with wide holes since the regions with high energy dissipation rate around the leading and trailing edges merged. The simulations also predicted that about 50 – 60 % of total energy supplied by rotor was dissipated in the rotor swept volume regardless of stator geometries.

However, these stresses are also representative of the other two adhesives’ behaviour (although there are small differences in the peak stresses because of the differences in E; see Table  1). In general, it is known that the use of smaller values of α leads to higher LS and, thus, to higher joint strengths.

40|$|Correct {{positioning}} of cortical neurons during development {{depends on the}} radial migration of the projection neurons and on the <b>coordinated</b> <b>tangential</b> and radial migrations of the subcortically generated interneurons. As previously shown, a transient and moderate maternal deficiency in thyroxin during early corticogenesis alters the radial migration of projection neurons. To determine if a similar effect might also affect tangential migration of medial ganglionic eminence (MGE) -derived neurons at the origin of cortical interneurons, explants of MGE from green fluorescent protein (GFP) -transgenic embryos were implanted into flat cortical mounts from wild-type embryos. The distances covered and the preferential migration (medially) of GFP-MGE neurons from embryos of hypothyroxinemic dams are not affected in their tangential migration into wild-type control cortices. In contrast, when GFP-MGE neurons from embryos of control or hypothyroxinemic dams migrate within cortices from embryos of hypothyroxinemic dams, the GFP-MGE-derived neurons lose their preferential direction of migration, although they still migrate for long distances throughout the cortex. Our results show that maternal hypothyroxinemia alters the tangential migration of GFP-MGE-derived neurons in the neocortex of the progeny and suggest that this alteration is not derived from the migratory neurons themselves but through undefined short- and long-range cues responsible for the guidance of their migration. © Federation of European Neuroscience Societies.
