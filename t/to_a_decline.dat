5|$|By {{the early}} twentieth century, the Shetland was {{perceived}} as threatened by cross-breeding, leading <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decline</b> in wool quality. To combat this, the Shetland Flock Book Society was formed in 1927, and this remains the body responsible for the sheep's protection on their native islands.|$|E
5|$|However, the boar and its {{relative}} the pig started {{being seen as}} polluting since the 12th century, due to Muslim influence on India. Muslims consider the pig and its meat unclean. This led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decline</b> in Varaha worship to a certain extent.|$|E
5|$|On February 28, {{the police}} stormed the lodge. Two police {{officers}} {{were killed in the}} assault, the hostage was rescued and the URA radicals were taken into custody. The incident contributed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decline</b> in popularity of leftist movements in Japan.|$|E

5|$|Timmons was {{strongly}} associated with the soul jazz style that he helped initiate; this link to apparently simple writing and playing, coupled with drug and alcohol addiction, led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decline</b> in his career. Timmons died, aged 38, from cirrhosis. Several critics have commented that his contribution to jazz remains undervalued.|$|E
5|$|According to this view, {{the barbarian}} {{officers}} and men {{recruited by the}} late army, coming from tribes that were traditional enemies of Rome, had no real loyalty to Rome and often betrayed her interests, colluding with invading barbarian tribes, especially if those tribes were their own. At the same time, the spread of barbarian customs and culture led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decline</b> in traditional military discipline, and internal army disunity due to friction between Romans and barbarians. Ultimately, the army degenerated into just a collection of foreign mercenary bands that were incapable of defending the empire effectively.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{half of the}} {{economically}} active population of Frome commute to work outside the town (in Bath, Bristol, Warminster, Westbury or further afield). About 2,700 people commute into the town. A substantial part of the workforce has no formal qualifications and is poorly skilled, leaving them vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decline</b> in manufacturing work. There is no major local government employment in the town, and the principal public sector employers are the Primary Care Trust and the schools.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from around}} 50 songs, Meyerbeer wrote little {{except for the}} stage. The {{critical}} assaults of Wagner and his supporters, especially after his death, led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decline</b> in the popularity of his works; his operas were suppressed by the Nazi regime in Germany, and were neglected by opera houses {{through most of the}} twentieth century. In the 21st century, however, the composer's major French grand operas have begun to reappear in the repertory of numerous European opera houses.|$|E
5|$|Between World WarI and World WarII Australia {{suffered}} {{greatly from}} the Great Depression {{which started in}} 1929. This limited Australian defence expenditure and led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decline</b> in the size and effectiveness {{of the armed forces}} during the 1930s. In 1931, the Statute of Westminster granted the Australian government independence in foreign affairs and defence. Nevertheless, from the mid-1930s, Australian governments generally followed British policy towards Nazi Germany, supporting first the appeasement of Hitler and the British guarantee of Polish independence.|$|E

5|$|In Anglo-Saxon {{times the}} river formed a {{boundary}} between Wessex and Dumnonia. It later served the Port of Bridgwater, and enabled cargoes {{to be transported}} inland. The arrival of the railways led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decline</b> in commercial shipping, and the only working docks are at Dunball. Man's influence on the river has left a legacy of bridges and industrial artefacts. The Parrett along with its connected waterways and network of drains supports an ecosystem that includes several rare species of flora and fauna. The River Parrett Trail has been established {{along the banks of}} the river.|$|E
5|$|In North America, Battarrea phalloides {{has been}} {{collected}} from the Yukon Territory, western Canada; the USA, where it is confined to the west— Southern California, New Mexico, and Arizona— Mexico, and Hawaii. It has also been reported growing in South America (Brazil), Africa (Morocco), Europe (Belgium), China, and Australia. Due <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decline</b> in sightings, B.phalloides was granted legal protection in Hungary in 2005, making it a finable offense to pick them. It received similar protected status in the United Kingdom in 1998.|$|E
5|$|In the past, the Newfoundland pony {{was used}} for ploughing, {{assisting}} with gardens, hauling kelp from the beaches, gathering hay, and carrying wood, and they were also used for transportation. They were successfully used and bred to withstand the hard climate, and by 1935 there were over 9,000 ponies on the island. During the mid-20th century, however, increasing mechanization and a ban on free-roaming ponies contributed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decline</b> in the population, and increased exports to France for horse meat in the 1970s almost led to the extinction of the breed.|$|E

5|$|Little {{is known}} about sivaladapid ecology. Gingerich and Sahni {{suggested}} that Indraloris was probably arboreal and {{that it may have}} been more frugivorous (eating fruit) than Sivaladapis, which they interpreted as a folivore (leaf-eater). Flynn and Morgan interpreted I.kamlialensis as a mixed feeder. The Late Miocene extinction of Indian sivaladapids may be related <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decline</b> in forest cover in Asia and to competition by immigrating colobine monkeys.|$|E
5|$|Significant mammals {{endemic to}} {{forests in the}} bioregion include various species of glider, such as Sugar Gliders (Petaurus breviceps), Feathertail Gliders (Acrobates pygmaeus) and Squirrel Gliders (Petaurus norfolcensis) as well as Koalas (Phascolarctos cinereus) A wide variety of birdlife makes its home in {{wetlands}} in the Riverina, including many migratory species. Competition from introduced species {{and the effect of}} clearing, grazing and pasture improvement has led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decline</b> in the diversity of native flora and fauna in the area.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} Tvrtko's {{maternal}} uncle Mladen III Šubić, in 1348, led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decline</b> of the Šubić noble {{family and a}} long conflict over their lands. In May 1355, Jelena and Tvrtko marched with an army to Duvno in order to claim Tvrtko's share of his uncle's patrimony. An agreement was reached with the vice-Ban of Dalmatia by which Tvrtko was to inherit all the cities held by his maternal grandfather and a city which belonged to his aunt Katarina, but it is unknown whether he actually took possession of them.|$|E

5|$|The {{issues of}} federalism, {{ethnicity}} {{in politics and}} state centralisation were not resolved by the crisis and partly contributed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decline</b> in support for {{the concept of the}} state among Congolese people. Mobutu was strongly in favour of centralisation and one of his first acts, in 1965, were to reunify provinces and abolish much of their independent legislative capacity. Subsequent loss of faith in central government {{is one of the reasons}} that the Congo has been labeled as a failed state, and has contributed violence by factions advocating ethnic and localised federalism.|$|E
5|$|The {{plight of}} Cordyline australis in the Sudden Decline {{epidemic}} {{drew attention to}} another widespread threat to the tree in rural areas throughout New Zealand. Rural Decline was the name proposed by botanists to refer <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>decline</b> in health of older trees in pasture and grazed shrubland, leading over many years {{to the loss of}} upper branches and eventual death.|$|E
5|$|The road {{outside was}} hit by a small bomb during the Second World War, but the cinema (which was showing several films at the time) survived with only minor damage.
