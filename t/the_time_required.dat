40|$|Most of {{the large}} number of {{internal}} sorting algorithms are based on the use of arrays or linked lists. This report highlights the use of tree structures for internal sorting. It is shown that the ordered binary tree can be used very effectively for sorting data, whatever the initial ordering of the input may be. It is also shown that the B-Trees, normally used to process large files on disks, can also be effectively employed to sort data in main memory. In both cases, a simple inorder traversal of the tree can retrieve data in sorted order. Algorithms based on binary- and B-tree structure are compared with Quick Sort and Heap Sort algorithms in terms of <b>times</b> <b>required</b> to sort various input lists.

5|$|In 1795, Rowan began {{construction}} of Federal Hill, his family estate, on land that his father-in-law gave {{him as a}} wedding present. Due to limited financial resources, <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>required</b> to import building materials from the east, and the craftsmanship required to construct the large home, the mansion was not completed until 1818.

To give itself extra time, the CLR had obtained an extension of time to 1899 by the Central London Railway Act, 1894. Construction works were let by the ETCL as three sub-contracts: Shepherd's Bush to Marble Arch, Marble Arch to St Martin's Le Grand and St Martin's Le Grand to Bank. Work began with demolition of buildings at the Chancery Lane site in April 1896 and construction shafts were started at Chancery Lane, Shepherd's Bush, Stanhope Terrace and Bloomsbury in August and September 1896.|$|E

Following the conversation, 1 PARA (with 2 PARA's D Company replacing A Company, who were on exercise in Jamaica, and with several attached assets including artillery) moved to the Air Movements Centre in South Cerney, Gloucestershire. The following day Richards was designated Joint Task Force Commander and his ORLT became the forward headquarters for a British deployment.

5|$|Sir Stanley V. Goodall, Director of Naval Construction (DNC), {{proposed}} {{a variety of}} designs, both open and closed hangar. On 8 October 1943, the Board of Admiralty selected a closed-hangar design with an armoured flight deck and five propeller shafts. Reports of American operations in the Pacific convinced the Board to reconsider hangar design; American experience had shown {{that the ability to}} fly off all of a carrier's aircraft in a single airstrike was vital. That required a well-ventilated, open-hangar design, which would reduce <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>required</b> to launch the aircraft by allowing them to begin the typical 15-minute engine warm-up while still in the hangar. On 15 May 1944, the Board reversed itself and ordered the DNC to produce an open-hangar design with deck-edge lifts. An unarmoured flight deck was agreed upon in June by the Controller of the Navy and the Fifth Sea Lord.|$|E
