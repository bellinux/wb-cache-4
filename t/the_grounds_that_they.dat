5|$|The New Jersey Supreme Court {{issued a}} ruling in 1942 {{upholding}} a Teaneck ordinance that had banned pinball machines on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were gambling devices {{rather than a}} form of amusement.|$|E
5|$|Literacy {{began to}} decline, perhaps dramatically, during the socio-political Crisis of the Third Century. Although the Church Fathers were well-educated, they {{regarded}} Classical literature as dangerous, if valuable, and reconstrued it through moralizing and allegorical readings. Julian, the only emperor after {{the conversion of}} Constantine to reject Christianity, banned Christians from teaching the Classical curriculum, on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> might corrupt the minds of youth.|$|E
5|$|The Christian Democrats, led by Päivi Räsänen, had {{announced}} {{that they would not}} support any governing coalition that plans on legalising same-sex marriage. Räsänen has also said that Christian refugees ought to be favoured in Finland's refugee policy on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> have better potential for successful integration to the society than refugees of other religions.|$|E
50|$|He {{closed down}} The Tribune and its sister {{newspaper}} The Weekend Tribune, on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> did not inform {{him of a}} change of ownership.|$|R
50|$|Many Germans {{objected to}} the {{confession}} of guilt, on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had also suffered in the war, {{as a result of}} Allied wrongdoing (particularly Soviet).|$|R

5|$|Wood {{pleaded not}} guilty to the murder of Danielle and instead entered a {{manslaughter}} plea on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had agreed to a suicide pact. The prosecution did not accept the manslaughter plea and pursued a trial for the murder of Danielle. However, Wood pleaded guilty to the murder of Stephanie and the attempted murder of Christopher. He also pleaded guilty to stealing £84,000 from clients.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{directly}} involved with Sheffield football, Charles Alcock {{had a major}} role in relations between the local and London associations. He acted as a go between encouraging the FA to accept rules from the Sheffield Rules. When the FA declined an inter-association match in Sheffield on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> could not play under Sheffield Rules it fell to Alcock to organise a team of London players to fulfil the fixture. The success of the match led to it becoming a regular event in the following years.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{deadline}} of June 5, the final number of signatures was never determined because the petitions were sent {{out of state}} to avoid a subpoena from the Sauk County district attorney, an ardent McCarthy supporter who was investigating {{the leaders of the}} recall campaign on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had violated Wisconsin's Corrupt Practices Act. Chicago newspapermen later tallied 335,000 names while another 50,000 were said to be hidden in Minneapolis, with other lists buried on Sauk County farms.|$|E
5000|$|In September 1948, Jews were {{dismissed}} from the railways, the post office, the telegraph {{department and the}} Finance Ministry on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were suspected of [...] "sabotage and treason".|$|R
60|$|Captain Smith said {{everything}} he could to persuade these people, who were content to live in a hole in <b>the</b> <b>ground,</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were little better than beasts of the field.|$|R

5|$|In 2002, Scottish {{toxicologist}} John Duffus {{reviewed the}} definitions used {{over the previous}} 60 years and concluded they were so diverse as to effectively render the term meaningless. Along with this finding, the heavy metal status of some metals is occasionally challenged on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are too light, or are involved in biological processes, or rarely constitute environmental hazards. Examples include scandium (too light); vanadium to zinc (biological processes); and rhodium, indium, and osmium (too rare).|$|E
5|$|Men without property, {{who were}} thereby {{excluded}} from the qualifying social classes of the adsidui, were exempted from military service on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were too poor to provide themselves with any arms whatsoever. However, in the most pressing circumstances, even these proletarii were pressed into service, though their military worth was probably questionable. Troops {{in all of these}} classes would fight together on the battlefield, {{with the exception of the}} most senior troops, who were expected to guard the city.|$|E
5|$|Originally it was {{believed}} that Lake Cahuilla formed around 900 AD and existed until 1500 but with fluctuations as the Colorado River changed its course. In 1978, Philip J. Wilke proposed that two highstands occurred, one between 900 and 1250 and another between 1300-1500. Another proposal by Waters in 1983 suggested highstands 700-900, 940-1210 and after 1250, the latter with some brief recessions to lower lake levels. Both proposals were criticized on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> came to definite conclusions with insufficient information.|$|E

25|$|Separate suits {{were brought}} by the American Independent Party and the Socialist Labor Party, {{challenging}} the validity of Ohio election laws insofar as they precluded the parties' being placed on the ballots to choose electors pledged to particular candidates for the Presidency and Vice Presidency of the United States; {{the attack on the}} validity of these laws was rested on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> violated <b>the</b> equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment—on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> denied plaintiffs and the voters who might wish to vote for them the equal protection of the laws, guaranteed against state abridgment by the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend. XIV.|$|R
50|$|Land Restrictions. SMCRA prohibits {{surface mining}} {{altogether}} on certain lands, {{such as in}} National Parks and wilderness areas. It also allows citizens to challenge proposed surface mining operations on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> will cause too much environmental harm.|$|R
5|$|Sir William Blackstone {{published}} a critical {{edition of the}} 1215 Charter in 1759, and gave it the numbering system still used today. In 1763, Member of Parliament John Wilkes was arrested for writing an inflammatory pamphlet, No. 45, 23 April 1763; he cited Magna Carta continually. Lord Camden denounced the treatment of Wilkes as a contravention of Magna Carta. Thomas Paine, in his Rights of Man, would disregard Magna Carta and the Bill of Rights on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were not a written constitution devised by elected representatives.|$|E
5|$|The GDR's {{government}} nonetheless remained {{opposed to}} emigration {{and sought to}} dissuade would-be émigrés. The process of applying for an exit permit was deliberately made slow, demeaning, frustrating and often fruitless. Applicants were marginalised, demoted or sacked from their jobs, excluded from universities and subjected to ostracism. They faced the threat of having their children taken into state custody on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were unfit to bring up children. The law was used to punish those who continued to apply for emigration; over 10,000applicants were arrested by the Stasi between the 1970s and 1989.|$|E
5|$|The Modi {{government}} {{launched a}} crackdown against {{a number of}} civil society organisations. Several {{tens of thousands of}} organisations were investigated by the Intelligence Bureau {{in the first year of}} the administration, on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were slowing economic growth. International humanitarian aid organisation Medecins Sans Frontieres was among the groups that were put under pressure. Other organisations affected included the Sierra Club and Avaaz. Cases of sedition were filed against individuals criticising the government. This led to discontent within the BJP regarding Modi's style of functioning and drew comparisons to the governing style of Indira Gandhi.|$|E
5000|$|The petitioners {{were mostly}} {{environmental}} groups, including Natural Resources Defense Council and Jean-Michel Cousteau's Ocean Futures Society, among others. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the exercises on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> violated NEPA {{and other environmental}} laws.|$|R
50|$|In 1384 Eleanor and {{her second}} husband were {{divorced}} on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were within <b>the</b> second and three degrees of consanguinity.

50|$|In 2004, the Greens regained <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{had lost}} in 1999 and won two {{additional}} {{seats in the}} Chamber. Although they got 15% of the votes in the coinciding European elections, placing them third, they couldn't add to their single seat.|$|R
5|$|The {{expedition}} made Rogers {{a national}} hero, but {{his brother was}} killed and Rogers was badly wounded in fights in the Pacific. On his return, he was successfully sued by his crew on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had not received {{their fair share of}} the expedition profits, and Rogers was forced into bankruptcy. He wrote of his maritime experiences in the book A Cruising Voyage Round the World, which sold well, in part due to public fascination at Selkirk's rescue.|$|E
5|$|After the war Helm {{identified}} with the Democratic Party, and {{he returned to the}} state senate in 1865. During his tenure he chaired the Committee on Federal Relations and fought against punitive and restrictive laws against ex-Confederates. On January 22, 1866 he presented to the state senate a protest against the actions of the United States Congress during the Civil War. It denounced the Reconstruction Amendments on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> granted powers to the federal government that were reserved for the states, and that they were passed while many southern states were not represented in Congress. He also decried the creation and operation of the Freedmen's Bureau. On January 29, 1867, Helm introduced legislation to organize a meeting in Louisville to rally support for President Andrew Johnson and his efforts to restore the Union.|$|E
5|$|Clement criticizes Greek paganism in the Protrepticus on {{the basis}} that its deities are both false and poor moral examples, and he attacks the mystery {{religions}} for their obscurantism and trivial rituals. In particular, the worshippers of Dionysus are ridiculed for their ritual use of children's toys. He suggests at some points that the pagan deities are based on humans, but at others that they are misanthropic demons, and he cites several classical sources in support of this second hypothesis. Clement, like many pre-Nicene fathers, writes favourably about Euhemerus and other rationalist philosophers, on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> at least saw the flaws in paganism. However, his greatest praise is reserved for Plato, whose apophatic views of God prefigure Christianity.|$|E
50|$|On 14 February 2013, {{hundreds}} of Oltchim employees protested {{in front of}} the Ministry of Economy headquarters, on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> didn't receive wages for two months. At least 24 employees went on hunger strike. Two of them needed medical care.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{different}} {{economic and}} moral arguments {{were made to}} either justify or else criticise the incomes gained from different activities, on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were [...] "productive" [...] or [...] "unproductive", [...] "earned" [...] or [...] "unearned", [...] "wealth-creating" [...] or [...] "wealth-consuming".|$|R
60|$|He soon spied {{the three}} hens {{strutting}} proudly about, {{though they were}} really anxiously wondering if there were not some grains lying on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> might be glad to eat. And as the last one passed by him, he saw she had one feather missing from her tail.|$|R
5|$|In August 2005, CP+B and Burger King {{became the}} target of lawyers of the band Slipknot, who alleged the mask-wearing rooster rockers were a blatant copy of the band's style. The band claimed that CP+B had {{approached}} Slipknot's record company, Roadrunner Records, with an offer to appear in another commercial for Burger King. The band declined on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> {{did not want to}} be associated with a burger chain and they felt that the Coq Roq advertisements were deliberately co-opting the band's signature look and style in order to influence its fans to purchase the chain's products. The band issued a cease and desist letter to CP+B and BK requesting the advertisements be pulled. When the two parties declined, the band sued for an undisclosed amount.|$|E
5|$|In February 1944, Meyszner's {{campaign}} against the German-Chetnik agreements escalated sharply. He had unusual allies in this, as Nedić and Ljotić also opposed them, in their case because the agreements tended to sideline them in favour of the Chetniks. In particular, Meyszner strongly opposed the further arming of the Chetniks led by Đurišić and Lukačević, on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had not upheld their previous agreements and that the Croats, as well as Muslims in Albania, Kosovo and the Sandžak, had expressed concerns about any strengthening of the Chetniks. The commander of the Bulgarian 1st Occupation Corps, General Asen Nikoloff, also opposed the agreements. Meyszner's increasing objections to the agreements coincided with growing Partisan pressure from {{the west and the}} advance of the Red Army from the east.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Jacobite defeat, on 13 February 1692, in an incident known as the Massacre of Glencoe, 38 members of the Clan MacDonald of Glencoe were killed by members of the Earl of Argyll's Regiment of Foot, who had accepted their hospitality, on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> had not been prompt in pledging allegiance to the new monarchs. Another forty women and children died of exposure after their homes were burned. The brutality of the incident was embarrassing for the new government and after a subsequent inquiry Dalrymple, who had ordered the massacre, was forced to resign. The massacre helped create greater sympathy for the Stuart cause and may have contributed to later support for Jacobite risings.|$|E
50|$|The {{reasons for}} refusing to serve are varied. Some {{conscientious}} objectors are so for religious reasons—notably, {{the members of the}} historic peace churches, pacifist by doctrine; Jehovah's Witnesses, while not strictly pacifists, refuse to participate in the armed forces on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> believe Christians should be neutral in worldly conflicts.|$|R
60|$|She added a {{piece of}} green ribbon round each hat. Leigh objected to this, on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> might {{sometimes}} have to enter towns, and that any badge of this sort would be speedily noticed; but as she said, they would only have to take them off, when engaged in such service.|$|R
25|$|India's {{chief of}} army staff urged {{negotiations}} on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were running out ammunition and their number of tanks had become seriously depleted. In fact, {{the army had}} used less than 15% of its ammunition compared to Pakistan, which had consumed closer to 80 percent and India had {{double the number of}} serviceable tanks.|$|R
