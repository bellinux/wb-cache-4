5|$|All LMS tenders {{were given}} {{their own unique}} {{identity}} numbers and <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> be constructed {{in advance of the}} locomotives they would be paired with. Hence, they were made in four batches, Nos. 9703–9709, 9743–9752, 9798–9817 and 10622-10624.|$|E
5|$|In 1932 Ralph Budd met Edward G. Budd (no relation), an {{automotive}} steel pioneer who was {{founder and}} president of the Budd Company. Edward Budd was demonstrating his new Budd-Michelin rail motorcar built of stainless steel. Pneumatic-wheeled railcars never found popularity for actual service in the US - <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> derail - but they demonstrated the successful construction of lightweight stainless steel unibody railcars.|$|E
5|$|Later {{studies of}} the {{events leading up to}} the tragedy found several factors {{contributing}} to the extent of the damage. A. Malheiro (2006) linked five major causes to damage from these earthquakes. The buildings most damaged by the earthquake were near fault lines on top of loosely packed soil. <b>They</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> be of poor construction and did not conform to proper building code, nor had they been adequately examined.|$|E
25|$|Unlike their children, <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> rely {{primarily}} on Japanese-language media (newspapers, television, movies), {{and in some}} senses, <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> {{think of themselves as}} more Japanese than Canadian or American.|$|R
50|$|<b>They</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> breed from January-October in Colombia and March-December in Ecuador. They do not migrate, {{making them}} a {{resident}} bird. <b>They</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> make mossy ball nests on banks containing 4 creamy white eggs.|$|R
5000|$|Hormonal {{treatments}} for such underlying conditions are very common, and <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> produce good results with time. Laparoscopic methods have also become quite common in treating retroverted uterus and <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be quite effective.|$|R
5|$|Six {{species of}} honeyeater have been {{observed}} feeding at its flowers, as have insects including honeybees, ants, butterflies, beetles and native bees. Both birds and insects function as pollinators, but honeybees are probably not very effective: in one study only about 4% of honeybees collected pollen, and <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> move from inflorescence to inflorescence on the same plant, rather than moving between plants.|$|E
5|$|A {{large number}} of civic or {{municipal}} botanical gardens were founded in the 19th and 20th centuries. These did not develop scientific facilities or programmes, but the horticultural aspects were strong and the plants often labelled. They were botanical gardens {{in the sense of}} building up collections of plants and exchanging seeds with other gardens around the world, although their collection policies were determined by those in day-to-day charge of them. <b>They</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> become little more than beautifully maintained parks and were, indeed, often under general parks administrations.|$|E
5|$|Most border {{units were}} based in forts as were their predecessors, the legions and {{auxiliary}} {{units of the}} Principate; {{in many cases they}} were based in the same forts. Some of the larger limitanei units (legiones and vexillationes) were based in cities, probably in permanent barracks. Because units of limitanei operated in one area, had their own camps, and often recruited from the same area, <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> maintain better relations with the locals than the comitatenses and palatini, who would often be transferred to other areas, and were often quartered in civilian homes.|$|E
5000|$|Artvoice {{notes that}} [...] "many books by BlazeVox have {{received}} national acclaim," [...] while Coal Hill Review has observed that [...] "BlazeVOX poetry collections <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> have three things in common: physically, <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be oversized and very attractive; stylistically, <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be experimental; and quality-wise, <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be strong." [...] Drunken Boat, an {{international journal of}} literature and the arts, credits BlazeVOX Books with offering its readers [...] "an eclectic mix of today's experimental voices." ...|$|R
50|$|The usual categorizations of {{community}} relations {{have a number}} of problems: 1. <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> give the impression that a particular community can be defined as just this kind or another; 2. <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> conflate modern and customary community relations; 3. <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> take sociological categories such as ethnicity or race as given, forgetting that different ethnically defined persons live in different kinds of communities — grounded, interest-based, diasporic, etc.|$|R
50|$|Adults emerge {{once a year}} to mate. In the {{northern}} part of their range <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> emerge mid summer (June-August), while in the southern half <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> emerge at more varied times (April-October). A linked pair is vulnerable to predators, particularly foraging raccoons.|$|R
5|$|There are no {{traces of}} the fabric of the {{original}} clas church. Most buildings in the sixth century were of wood, wattle and daub. Even churches were wooden. Although the use of stone was not unknown elsewhere in Britain at this time, it was not used in Wales (it was rare anywhere in Britain until the eleventh century). Churches were also distinguished by their comparatively small size and simplicity. <b>They</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> be under 40 feet long, with a single tall, aisleless nave, and with a small square chancel attached. They were often oratories, rather than full churches.|$|E
5|$|I {{realized}} {{that for a}} long time I had been holding onto this whole dogma of nonracism almost like a religion... But in the course of that debate I began to feel there was a lot lacking in the proponents of the nonracist idea... they had this problem, you know, of superiority, and <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> take us for granted and wanted us to accept things that were second-class. They could not see why we could not consider staying in that church, and I began to feel that our understanding of our own situation in this country was not coincidental with that of these liberal whites.|$|E
5|$|The most {{masculine}} {{women were}} not necessarily common, though they were visible so <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> attract women interested in finding other lesbians. Women had to broach the subject about their interest in other women carefully, sometimes taking days to develop a common understanding without asking or stating anything outright. Women who did not enter the military were aggressively called upon to take industrial jobs left by men, {{in order to continue}} national productivity. The increased mobility, sophistication, and independence of many women during and after the war made it possible for women to live without husbands, something {{that would not have been}} feasible under different economic and social circumstances, further shaping lesbian networks and environments.|$|E
5000|$|Defence/Defender: These Beyblades specialise in {{knocking}} back attacks. <b>They</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> travel {{slowly and}} are heavier than other types, resulting in opponents being deflected. Their weight also {{causes them to}} launch slower, resulting in less stamina. <b>They</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> wear down Attack-types but are outlasted by Stamina.|$|R
50|$|Lutzomyia anthophora {{are found}} in Mexico and in the U.S. <b>They</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> feed on small mammals and {{therefore}} {{can be found in}} these mammals nests (this is also the where it might be easiest to collect these flies). Also, <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> develop faster at higher temperatures.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{there are}} people and groups who make their living from {{shoplifting}} and other crimes. <b>They</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be more skilled career criminals who use more sophisticated shoplifting tactics. Researchers call professional thieves [...] "boosters," [...] as <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> resell what <b>they</b> steal [...] on the black market.|$|R
5|$|Archaeological {{investigation}} of Olmec basalt workshops {{suggest that the}} colossal heads were first roughly shaped using direct percussion to chip away {{both large and small}} flakes of stone. The sculpture was then refined by retouching the surface using hammerstones, which were generally rounded cobbles that could be of the same basalt as the monument itself, although this was not always the case. Abrasives were found in association with workshops at San Lorenzo, indicating their use in the finishing of fine detail. Olmec colossal heads were fashioned as in-the-round monuments with varying levels of relief on the same work; <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> feature higher relief on the face and lower relief on the earspools and headdresses. Monument20 at San Lorenzo is an extensively damaged throne with a figure emerging from a niche. Its sides were broken away and it was dragged to another location before being abandoned. It is possible that this damage was caused by the initial stages of re-carving the monument into a colossal head but that the work was never completed.|$|E
5|$|Attempting {{to combine}} his two main product lines, cars and stereos, Muntz invented the Muntz Stereo-Pak 4-track tape cartridge. 4-track was the direct {{predecessor}} of the Stereo 8 cartridge, {{also known as}} the 8-track, later developed by American inventor Bill Lear. The Stereo-Pak cartridge was based on the endless-loop Fidelipac cartridge, which was being used by radio stations, designed by inventor George Eash. Muntz chose stereo recording as a standard feature because of its wide availability. Before Muntz developed the Stereo-Pak, the only in-car units capable of recorded playback were phonograph-based players, such as the Highway Hi-Fi invented by Peter Goldmark. These units played special 16 rpm records or 45 rpm records, however <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> skip whenever the vehicle hit a bump in the road, and attempts to alleviate this by increasing the pressure on the arm caused discs to wear out prematurely.|$|E
5|$|Kosovo Albanians were {{generally}} less hospitable to Jews {{than their counterparts}} in Albania. Due to their historical experiences with Serbs and the Ottoman Empire, <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> be more unfriendly towards local non-Albanians. Many enthusiastically supported the Germans as a result. Claims have been made that Kosovo Albanians protected Jews after German forces took over territories that Italian authorities had controlled during the war, but the protection that Jews received in Kosovo {{in the early years of}} the war was due more to the Italian authorities than to the local Albanian population. It is estimated that 210 Jews from Kosovo perished during the war. An official Yugoslav state report published in 1964 recorded 74 Jewish wartime fatalities in the region. Approximately 600 Jews were killed in Albania, Kosovo and other Albanian-controlled territories during the war. A somewhat greater number, as well as several hundred refugees, hid and survived with the assistance of the local Albanian population.|$|E
50|$|P. truei are omnivores {{and have}} been found with insects, {{invertebrates}} and fungi, but <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be more specialists, compared to other Peromyscus when searching for food. In burned out areas <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> stick to the edges instead of moving into the burn area. Finding water is usually a challenge in most of their habitats and they adjust their diet accordingly.|$|R
5000|$|Bipolar {{disorder}} (acute mania {{and mixed}} episodes) may {{be treated with}} either typical or atypical antipsychotics, although atypical antipsychotics are usually preferred because <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> have more favourable adverse effect profiles and, {{according to a recent}} meta-analysis, <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> have a lower liability for causing conversion from mania to depression.|$|R
5000|$|E [...] - [...] Extraversion {{preferred}} to introversion: ENFJs often feel motivated by their interaction with people. <b>They</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> enjoy a wide circle of acquaintances, and they gain energy in social situations. <b>They</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> turn to external sources when making decisions, and want approval from others. (whereas introverts expend energy).|$|R
5|$|Several senior German {{military}} officials were tried and convicted for {{their involvement in}} the reprisal shootings at the Nuremberg trials and the subsequent Nuremberg trials. The massacre {{had a profound effect}} on the course of the war in Yugoslavia. It exacerbated tensions between the two guerrilla movements, the communist-led Partisans and the royalist, Serbian nationalist Chetniks, and convinced Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović that further attacks against the Germans would only result in more Serb civilian deaths. The Germans soon found mass executions of Serbs to be ineffectual and counterproductive, as <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> drive the population into the arms of insurgents. The ratio of 100executions for one soldier killed and 50executions for one soldier wounded was reduced by half in February 1943, and removed altogether later in the year. The massacre is commemorated by the October in Kragujevac Memorial Park and the co-located 21stOctober Museum, and has been the subject of several poems and feature films. The day the massacre took place is commemorated annually in Serbia as the Day of Remembrance of the Serbian Victims of World War II.|$|E
5|$|The VNQDD contested their {{national}} elections of 1967, the first elections {{since the fall}} of Diem, which were riggedDiem and his people invariably gained more than 95% of the vote and sometimes exceeded the number of registered voters. The campaign was disorganised {{due to a lack of}} infrastructure and some VNQDD candidates were not formally sanctioned by any hierarchy. The VNQDD focused on the districts in I Corps in central Vietnam where they were thought to be strong. There were 60 seats in the senate, and the six victorious tickets would see all ten of their members elected. The VNQDD entered eight tickets in the senate election, and while they totalled 15% of the national vote between them, the most of any grouping, it was diluted between the groupings; none of the tickets and thus none of the candidates were elected. This contrasted with one Catholic alliance with three tickets that won only 8% of the vote, but had all 30 candidates elected. They won nine seats in the lower house, a small minority presence, all from districts in central Vietnam, where <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> poll between 20 and 40% in various areas. The VNQDD members made several loose alliances with Hòa Hảo members of the lower house.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of Gedi's structures were domestic residences made of thatched-roofed mud buildings concentrated between the outer and inner walls; however, the only buildings that survived {{to the present}} were constructed using coral stones extracted from the Indian Ocean. Although several of the buildings predate the fourteenth century, coral became a more common construction material for important structures and elite residences during that time period. All of the buildings at Gedi are single-story structures. The walls and other coral structures were constructed {{in a similar manner}} using lime mortar, with most foundations no greater than one foot in depth and filled with stones. Where foundations were used, <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> be no wider than the wall they supported. There are several examples of non-utilitarian design elements. Doorways for the buildings consist of square framed pointed archways, with tombs and mosques containing spandrels and architraves that have been carved or inlaid with porcelain.|$|E

5|$|Due to a {{shortage}} of Brownings, which had been selected as the new standard rifle calibre machine gun for the RAF in 1934, early Spitfires were fitted with only four guns, with the other four fitted later. Early tests showed that while the guns worked perfectly {{on the ground and}} at low altitudes, <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> freeze at high altitude, especially the outer wing guns. This was because the RAF's Brownings had been modified to fire from an open bolt. While this prevented overheating of the cordite used in British ammunition, it allowed cold air to flow through the barrel unhindered. Supermarine did not fix the problem until October 1938, when they added hot air ducts {{from the rear of the}} wing mounted radiators to the guns, and bulkheads around the gunbays to trap the hot air in the wing. Red fabric patches were doped over the gun ports to protect the guns from cold, dirt and moisture until they were fired. Even if the eight Brownings worked perfectly, pilots soon discovered that they were not sufficient to destroy larger aircraft. Combat reports showed that an average of 4,500 rounds were needed to shoot down an enemy aircraft. In November 1938, tests against armoured and unarmoured targets had already indicated that the introduction of a weapon with a calibre of at least 20mm was urgently needed.|$|E
25|$|However, early MEMS {{resonators}} did {{not have}} sufficiently stable frequencies {{to be used for}} timing references or clock generation. The metallic resonator elements tended to shift frequency with time (they aged) and with use (they fatigued). Under temperature variation <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> have large and not entirely predicable frequency shifts (they had large temperature sensitivity) and when they were temperature cycled <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> return to different frequencies (they were hysteretic).|$|E

50|$|The ideological {{views of}} most low-information voters <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be more {{moderate}} {{than those of}} high-information voters.

Researchers attribute this to low-information voters not having developed clear cut ideological preferences.|$|R
