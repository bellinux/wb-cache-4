In May 2000, The Smashing Pumpkins disbanded and Auf der Maur did not have plans to continue her music career. In an interview with Jam!, Auf der Maur said: [...] "one {{of the reasons why}} I took 2001 off is I didn't even know what I was going to do with music.

[...] In late 2001, Auf der Maur discovered [...] "old demos" [...] in her Montréal residence and [...] "realized [...] had an entire album's worth of material that had been sitting there for years." [...] Among the demos was [...] "Real a Lie", a song written with frequent collaborator Steve Durand, that was released as a single by the duo's former band Tinker in 1994. Auf der Maur said that the decision to record an album [...] "happened very naturally." ...|$|E

In 2006, she was acknowledged for her meticulous classical performance style in Giselle {{and created a}} role in Jorma Elo's Glow–Stop.

500|$|On {{the final}} cut privilege, Spielberg was {{dissatisfied}} with the film. Columbia Pictures was experiencing financial problems, and they were depending on this film to save their company. [...] "I wanted to have another six months to finish off this film, and release it in summer 1978. They told me they needed this film out immediately," [...] Spielberg explained. [...] "Anyway, Close Encounters was a huge financial success and I told them I wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> director's cut. They agreed {{on the condition that}} I show the inside of the mothership so they could have something to hang a [...] campaign on. I never should have shown the inside of the mother ship." [...] In 1979, Columbia gave Spielberg $1.5million to produce what became the [...] "Special Edition" [...] of the film. Spielberg added seven minutes of new footage, but also deleted or shortened various existing scenes by a total of ten minutes, so that the Special Edition was three minutes shorter than the original 1977 release. The Special Edition featured several new character development scenes, the discovery of the SS Cotopaxi in the Gobi Desert, and a view of the inside of the mothership. Close Encounters of the Third Kind: The Special Edition was released in August 1980, making a further $15.7million, accumulating a final $303.7million box office gross. Roger Ebert [...] "thought the original film was an astonishing achievement, capturing the feeling of awe and wonder we have when considering the likelihood of life beyond the Earth. ...

2500|$|Marshall {{received}} attention for an attempted touchdown celebration during the Broncos' 34–30 comeback road {{victory over the}} Cleveland Browns in a Thursday Night Football matchup on November 6, 2008. With over a minute left in the game, Marshall caught the go-ahead touchdown pass {{and then began to}} pull a glove from his pants. Denver wide receiver Brandon Stokley rushed over to Marshall to urge him to put the glove away, as it could be considered a touchdown celebration prop, which is against NFL rules (a 15-yard penalty on the kickoff could be assessed). Marshall later explained that he was intending to put on the glove (which was white with one half of it painted black) as a means to honor racial progress and unity in the United States, following the country electing Barack Obama as President two days earlier. Regarding the attempted touchdown celebration, Marshall said, [...] "I know at the 1968 Olympics in Mexico, Tommie Smith and John Carlos raised that black glove and that fist as a silent gesture of black power and liberation. Forty years later, I wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> statement. I wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>my</b> <b>own</b> statement and gesture to represent the progress we made." [...] Smith and Carlos didn't initially see Marshall's attempted gesture when it happened live, but both said they appreciated and understood Marshall's intent. [...] "He wanted to make a mark in history and feel that he {{was a part of the}} change for the better," [...] Smith said.

He would rather read a good baseball novel than a complex statistical analysis of the game. 'I found that players are very suspicious of computers, much like the general public,' he said.
