25|$|Doors can be hinged so {{that the}} axis of {{rotation}} {{is not in the}} plane of the door to reduce the space required on the side to which <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>opens.</b> This requires a mechanism {{so that the}} axis of rotation is on the side other than that in which <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>opens.</b> This is sometimes the case in trains or airplanes, such as for the door to the toilet, which opens inward.|$|E

25|$|Where {{the doorway}} is wide enough, many Ashkenazi Jews tilt the mezuzah {{so that the}} top slants toward the room into which <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>opens.</b> This is done to {{accommodate}} the variant opinions of Rashi and of his grandson, Rabbeinu Tam, {{as to whether it}} should be placed vertically (Rashi) or horizontally (Rabbeinu Tam), and also to imply that God and the Torah (which the mezuzah symbolizes) are entering the room. The compromise solution has been suggested by Rabbi Jacob ben Asher.|$|E
25|$|Day {{five of the}} {{proceedings}} saw conflict as the prosecution again attempted to introduce evidence {{that had not been}} shared with both the court and the defense during pre-trial.

25|$|The Dennis Otte Round Barn is 54 feet (16.5 m) in {{diameter}} and stands upon a poured concrete foundation. The barn's main entrance is found in its east quadrant, where it faces due east. <b>The</b> <b>door</b> <b>opens</b> into a central crib which bisects the building. Animal stalls are arranged {{on either side of}} the crib in a semi circular pattern, they are divided with hewn and sawed posts which support a concentric loft plate with a radius of about 27 feet (8.2 m). The single hip roof is supported by a 2 by 6inch (5.1 by 15.2cm) beam nailed to each rafter four feet (1.2 m) above, and four feet (1.2 m) below on the opposite side, the roof hip. This is similar to the nearby Gerald Harbach Round Barn. The wooden shingled roof is capped by a short, squat cupola. The loft plate, the flooring and the loft piers were all constructed from previously used materials.|$|E

500|$|Former GameSpot {{reviewer}} Greg Kasavin, though awarding {{the game}} {{a score of}} 8.2 of 10, was disappointed by the security and lockpicking mechanics. [...] "Such instances are essentially noninteractive", he wrote.

[...] Kasavin made similar complaints about the hacking interface, noting that, [...] "Even with basic hacking skills, you'll {{still be able to}} bypass the encryption and password protection ... by pressing the 'hack' button and waiting a few seconds." ...|$|E

2500|$|Whenever a door {{is opened}} {{outwards}} {{there is a}} risk that it could strike another person.

2500|$|A {{safety door}} {{prevents}} finger injuries near the hinges {{without the use}} of door guards. [...] Rather than cover the danger area, the approach is to change the shape of the door so that an accessible gap does not form in the first place. [...] This is achieved by adding a perfectly circular ("bull-nose" [...] shaped) extension to the door, which moves {{in and out of a}} cavity as <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>opens</b> and closes. [...] This prevents any part of a hand being crushed near the hinges – either inside or outside. These doors have an operating range of slightly over 90 degrees, so their use is limited to where they come into contact with a side wall when fully open (or where they can be prevented from opening too far by a doorstop).|$|E
