40|$|This study {{explored}} {{a number}} of issues dealing {{with the use of a}} <b>text</b> <b>synthesis</b> paradim and feedback. Subjects reconstructed a 26 sentence passage dealing with Watergate. The passage was presented in either scrambled form or in the original order of sentences. The major dependent variables were recall, recognition, and concordance (tau) between the subject-ordered sequence of sentences and the original order. Among the major findins were: (1) no differences in recall and recognition scores between limited and unlimited feedback, (2) tau increased with unlimited feedback, but had no significant impact on retrieval, (3) reconstruction assisted recognition as compared to simply reading the materials, and (4) there were no differences in recall or recognition as a function of whether the material was scrambled or in the original order. The results confirmed previous findings which suggest feedback may be subject and content specific. Limitations of Feedback on Retrieval Using a <b>Text</b> <b>Synthesis</b> Approach An axiomatic belief in instruction is that feedback in the form of assurance or guidance is conducive to improved achievement. Kulhavy (1977), for example, suggests that feedback should be prompt and frequent, while Frederiksen (1984) declares that appropriate feedback is an integral part of problem solving processes. Unfortunately, this reliance on the efficacy of feedback is not completely warranted, especially in the area of text processing (Langer, Keenan, & Medosch-Schonbeck, 1985 a) ...|$|E
40|$|Symbolic {{resources}} for <b>text</b> <b>synthesis</b> and text analysis are typically created and stored separately. In our case, {{we have a}} KPML-resource (Nigel) and a CCG for English. In this paper, we argue that reversing efficient resources such as ours cannot in general be achieved. For this reason, we propose a symbolic map that can be converted automatically into both synthesis- and analysis-oriented resources. We show that completeness of description can only be achieved by such a map while efficiency concerns can only be tackled by the directed rules of task-oriented resources {{not because of the}} current state of the art, but because reversing task-oriented symbolic resources is impossible in principle. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—In {{developing}} a text-to-speech system, {{it is well}} known that the accuracy of information extracted from a text is crucial to produce high quality synthesized speech. In this paper, a new scheme for converting text into its equivalent phonetic spelling is introduced and developed. This method is applicable to many applications in text to speech converting systems and has many advantages over other methods. The proposed method can also complement the other methods with a purpose of improving their performance. The proposed method is a probabilistic model and is based on Smooth Ergodic Hidden Markov Model. This model can be considered as an extension to HMM. The proposed method is applied to Persian language and its accuracy in converting text to speech phonetics is evaluated using simulations.

40|$|This article {{describes}} two technologies, speech recognition and speech synthesis, that manipulate speech {{in terms of}} its information content. Recognition is the transformation of human speech into text to be used literally (e. g., for dictation) or interpreted as commands to control applications. Synthesis allows the generation of spoken utterances from <b>text.</b> <b>Synthesis</b> is desirable when a large number of utterances must be available or when message content is unpredictable, requirements that make pre-recording of speech impractical. The technologies covered in this article are of particular interest because they support direct communication between humans and computers through a mode that humans commonly use for communication amongst themselves and at which they are highly skilled. Other speech technologies of note, not discussed here, include speaker recognition (automatically establishing a speaker's identity) as well as speech editing and indexing (the manipulation of speech without the extraction of linguistic information). 1 RECOGNITIO...|$|E
40|$|Game {{semantics}} is {{a powerful}} method of semantic analysis for programming languages. It gives mathematically accurate models ("fully abstract") {{for a wide variety}} of programming languages. Game semantic models are combinatorial characterisations of all possible interactions between a term and its syntactic context. Because such interactions can be concretely represented as sets of sequences, it is possible to ask whether they can be learned from examples. Concretely, we are using long short-term memory neural nets (LSTM), a technique which proved effective in learning natural languages for automatic translation and <b>text</b> <b>synthesis,</b> to learn game-semantic models of sequential and concurrent versions of Idealised Algol (IA), which are algorithmically complex yet can be concisely described. We will measure how accurate the learned models are as a function of the degree of the term and the number of free variables involved. Finally, we will show how to use the learned model to perform latent semantic analysis between concurrent and sequential Idealised Algol. Comment: In Proceedings ICE 2017, arXiv: 1711. 1070...|$|E

40|$|In the {{traditional}} object recognition pipeline, descriptors are densely sampled over an image, pooled into a high dimensional non-linear representation and then passed to a classifier. In recent years, Fisher Vectors have proven empirically {{to be the}} leading representation for a large variety of applications. The Fisher Vector is typically taken as the gradients of the log-likelihood of descriptors, {{with respect to the}} parameters of a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Motivated by the assumption that different distributions should be applied for different datasets, we present two other Mixture Models and derive their Expectation-Maximization and Fisher Vector expressions. The first is a Laplacian Mixture Model (LMM), which is based on the Laplacian distribution. The second Mixture Model presented is a Hybrid Gaussian-Laplacian Mixture Model (HGLMM) which is based on a weighted geometric mean of the Gaussian and Laplacian distribution. An interesting property of the Expectation-Maximization algorithm for the latter is that in the maximization step, each dimension in each component is chosen to be either a Gaussian or a Laplacian. Finally, by using the new Fisher Vectors derived from HGLMMs, we achieve state-of-the-art results for both the image annotation and the image search by a sentence tasks.

HTS, the leading paramet-ric synthesis system, {{can use a}} number of different front-ends to generate full context models for synthesis and training. In this paper we explore the use of a new text processing front-end that has been added to the speech recognition toolkit Kaldi as part of an ongoing project to produce a new parametric {{speech synthesis}} system, Idlak. The use of XML specification files, a modular design, and modern coding and testing approaches, make the Idlak front-end ideal for adding, altering and experi-menting with the contexts used in full context acoustic models. The Idlak front-end was evaluated against the standard Festival front-end in the HTS system. Results from the Idlak front-end compare well with the more mature Festival front-end (Idlak- 2. 83 MOS vs Festival- 2. 85 MOS), although a slight reduction in naturalness perceived by non-native English speakers can be attributed to Festival’s insertion of non-punctuated pauses.
