500|$|Germanium {{has largely}} been {{replaced}} by silicon in semiconducting devices, being cheaper, more resilient at higher operating temperatures, and easier to work during the microelectronic fabrication process. Germanium is still a constituent of semiconducting silicon-germanium [...] "alloys" [...] and these have been growing in use, particularly for wireless communication devices; such alloys exploit the higher carrier mobility of germanium. The synthesis of gram-scale quantities of semiconducting germanane was reported in 2013. This comprises one-atom <b>thick</b> <b>sheets</b> of hydrogen-terminated germanium atoms, analogous to graphane. It conducts electrons more than ten times faster than silicon and five times faster than germanium, and {{is thought to have}} potential for optoelectronic and sensing applications. The development of a germanium-wire based anode that more than doubles the capacity of lithium-ion batteries was reported in 2014. In the same year, Lee at al. reported that defect-free crystals of graphene large enough to have electronic uses could be grown on, and removed from, a germanium substrate.|$|E
500|$|Hawley {{noted that}} many US {{television}} series are filmed in Vancouver, and it [...] "offers an amazing array of looks and feels and, obviously, a great crew base and everything." [...] Sets {{for the series}} were constructed in a former supermarket warehouse in Burnaby, including a [...] "23,000-square-foot set" [...] for the interior of Clockworks Mental Hospital. Wylie called this the most complicated set, and felt [...] "trying to make a hospital feel fun is a perfect challenge." [...] The most difficult set for Wylie to create was the ice room inhabited by Oliver Bird in the astral plane, which he had to create in seven days. Wylie initially looked to have the set built by [...] "those people who make giant sheets of ice for ice sculptures and stuff", before eventually building the set out of visqueen. However, this did not work, and was a [...] "gigantic disappointment". Wylie had the set rebuilt within a week, with the second version using acrylic molded to look like <b>thick</b> <b>sheets</b> of ice. Another notable set featured a giant volume knob which Haller turns to [...] "control {{the volume of the}} voices he hears in his head". This was compared to the effects of films like Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and The Incredible Shrinking Man, and described by Gonzales as [...] "classic Noah Hawley". The sequence was filmed at the end of production on the season, and added to the second episode. All of Wylie's sets were built with [...] "external lighting features" [...] that could be controlled from a board, allowing the cinematographers to be flexible with lighting [...] "given that the reality of a location can change drastically depending on our main character’s perceptions and actions." ...|$|E

[...] While in New York, he continued to innovate and developed a technique known as [...] "Beaten Lead" [...] which involved the creation of three-dimensional sculptures from one-quarter inch <b>thick</b> <b>sheets</b> of lead. His process involved suspending a lead sheet from the ceiling with clamps, and using ball peen hammers to work {{both sides of the}} sheet simultaneously.

40|$|The {{original}} {{notch stress}} approach for fatigue design {{is limited to}} <b>thick</b> <b>sheet</b> structures and a fixed notch radius of 1 [*]mm. Concepts utilizing the effective notch stress claim {{to account for the}} variation of the weld shape parameters, however, size effects are not taken into account. Therefore, an expansion of the notch stress approach has been developed, which includes consideration of the geometrical and statistical size effect in order to extend the application to thin and <b>thick</b> <b>sheet</b> structures. It is also capable of evaluating highly localized three-dimensional stress concentrations at weld start and end points. To validate the quality of this approach, experimentally determined fatigue data for thin steel sheet specimens from the Institute of Material Mechanics, including weld start and end points, and data from the literature regarding conventional <b>thick</b> <b>sheet</b> components without weld start and end points were reevaluated. The final result is a unified scatter band of fatigue lives of thin and <b>thick</b> <b>sheet</b> specimens, with and without weld start and end points, including also several modes of seam weld end point loading: transversal and longitudinal tension compression as well as shear loading at seam welds...|$|R

40|$|Clinching as an {{alternative}} joining technology to welding or bolting today is restricted up to circa 4 mm single sheet thickness. There is no industrial experience in clinching higher sheet thickness up to 10 mm. However, the branches of industry working with <b>thick</b> <b>sheet</b> metal (utility and rail vehicle engineering, shipbuilding and general structural steel engineering) represent a major potential for using this highly efficient and economic joining technology.
