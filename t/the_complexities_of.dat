5|$|Aaliyah is an R and neo soul {{record with}} music drawing from funk, hip hop, {{alternative}} rock, and electronica, among other styles.

Most {{of the songs}} were written by lyricist Static Major, who shared a close friendship and strong rapport with Aaliyah.

5|$|As {{a thought}} {{experiment}} in economics, many international trade economists {{have found this}} simplified and idealized {{version of the story}} important due to its ability to simplify <b>the</b> <b>complexities</b> <b>of</b> the real world. The implicit assumption is that the study of a one agent economy will provide useful insights into the functioning of a real world economy with many economic agents. This article pertains to the study of consumer behaviour, producer behaviour and equilibrium as a part of microeconomics. In other fields of economics, the Robinson Crusoe economy framework is used for essentially the same thing. For example, in public finance the Robinson Crusoe economy is used to study the various types of public goods and certain aspects of collective benefits. It is used in growth economics to develop growth models for underdeveloped or developing countries to embark upon a steady growth path using techniques of savings and investment.|$|E
5|$|Electrical {{generators}} and alternators are frequently used as portable welding power supplies, {{but because of}} lower efficiency and greater costs, they are less frequently used in industry. Maintenance also {{tends to be more}} difficult, because of <b>the</b> <b>complexities</b> <b>of</b> using a combustion engine as a power source. However, in one sense they are simpler: the use of a separate rectifier is unnecessary because they can provide either AC or DC. However, the engine driven units are most practical in field work where the welding often must be done out of doors and in locations where transformer type welders are not usable because there is no power source available to be transformed.|$|E
5|$|In August 1701, George was {{invested}} with the Order of the Garter and, within six weeks, the nearest Catholic claimant to the thrones, the former king James II, died. William III died the following March and was succeeded by Anne. Sophia became heiress presumptive {{to the new}} Queen of England. Sophia was in her seventy-first year, older than Anne by thirty-five years, but she was very fit and healthy and invested time and energy in securing the succession either for herself or her son. However, it was George who understood <b>the</b> <b>complexities</b> <b>of</b> English politics and constitutional law, which required further acts in 1705 to naturalise Sophia and her heirs as English subjects, and to detail arrangements for the transfer of power through a Regency Council. In the same year, George's surviving uncle died and he inherited further German dominions: the Principality of Lüneburg-Grubenhagen, centred at Celle.|$|E

5|$|The use of sleeve {{valves and}} oil baths to {{lubricate}} {{the moving parts}} of the engine units was inspired by contemporary internal combustion engine practice. This included oscillating gear that gave a 25-degree axial movement to the sleeves, allowing even lubrication of the moving parts. However, this resulted in an over-complicated mechanism that was difficult to maintain, perpetuating the seizures {{it was meant to}} eradicate. This feature was removed from both bogies of the prototype as the trials progressed. Another innovative feature of the steam bogie assembly was the ability to interchange them when faults occurred, an easy operation for maintenance staff when compared to <b>the</b> <b>complexities</b> <b>of</b> overhauling a regular steam locomotive's motion.|$|E

However, Renwick briefly felt emotional as he watched Victor's arm falling into the shot and his cap drift away in the gutter. After the exterior sequences had been filmed, the remainder of the episode was recorded at BBC Television Centre in West London on 17 September 2000.

5|$|Critics {{reported}} that players rarely {{need to use}} Undead Nightmare new weapons. Whitehead (Eurogamer) said that Marston's firearms are mostly indistinguishable apart from the blunderbuss, which is only useful when the player is overrun by zombies. GameSpot added that the game's combat is repetitive and less fun in the expansion, as zombies barely pose a threat. The zombies, without guns, cover, horses, lack <b>the</b> <b>complexities</b> <b>of</b> cowboys and, apart {{from some of the}} special zombie types, are only a threat at short distances. The reviewer found little variation between weapons when firing at close range, which is more effective than aiming at a distance. The fun of the new guns quickly faded for the critic, who found little incentive to use traditional gunfight strategies. Whitehead (Eurogamer) too noted that the base game relied on its use of cover during gunfights, which the expansion jettisons altogether. Thus the player is forced into the technique of backtracking and turning to use the time-slowing Dead Eye mode to clear zombies with headshots. The reviewer also found the controls clumsy and often tripped on piles of zombie bodies or became stuck in doorways. While the idea of zombie animals scared Whitehead, he was both relieved and disappointed to find that bears and cougars, like the humans, died with a single bullet.|$|E
