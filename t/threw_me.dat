500|$|Shafer was an {{outstanding}} fielder. Fellow major league right fielder Paul Radford, when writing {{about how to}} play the position, said: [...] "I always considered 'Orator' Shaffer a splendid right fielder, because of his skill in throwing out men at the initial bag. I know he <b>threw</b> <b>me</b> out thus in two successive games at Buffalo." [...] According to The Sporting Life, Shafer [...] "was for years considered the best man in his position." [...] In 2001, statistician Bill James ranked Shafer as the 99th greatest right fielder of all-time.|$|E
500|$|Wilkinson, by then Leeds United manager, {{returned}} to his former club in July 1991 to sign two young centre-backs, Jon Newsome first and Wetherall a few days later, for a combined fee of £275,000. The 20-year-old Wetherall's first season at Leeds was {{the final year of}} his degree course, so he played for the reserves while training part-time. He made a brief debut in the First Division, on 3 September 1991 at Elland Road as a late substitute against Arsenal; Leeds {{went on to win the}} 1991–92 league title. He remembers it as [...] "With 20 minutes to go, we were 2–1 down and I was on the touchline ready to go on, then Lee Chapman scored and the gaffer (Howard Wilkinson) told me to sit down again. But he <b>threw</b> <b>me</b> on for the last two minutes. I always tell people that made the difference in winning the title!" [...] As his teammates took the league trophy on a celebratory open top bus tour, Wetherall chose to revise for his examinations, a decision he came to regret, because [...] "those experiences don't come around that often". Though the revision bore fruit: he graduated with first-class honours.|$|E
500|$|The album's {{production}} expanded on that of The Chronic, with new, sparse {{beats and}} reduced use of samples which were prominent on his debut album. Co-producer Scott Storch talked of how Dr. Dre used his collaborators during recording sessions: [...] "At the time, I saw Dr. Dre desperately needed something. He needed a fuel injection, and Dre utilized {{me as the}} nitrous oxide. He <b>threw</b> <b>me</b> into the mix, and I sort of tapped on a new flavor with my whole piano sound and the strings and orchestration. So I'd be on the keyboards, and Mike [...] was on the bass guitar, and Dre was on the drum machine." [...] Josh Tyrangiel of Time has described the recording process which Dr. Dre employs, stating [...] "Every Dre track begins the same way, with Dre behind a drum machine {{in a room full}} of trusted musicians. (They carry beepers. When he wants to work, they work.) He'll program a beat, then ask the musicians to play along; when Dre hears something he likes, he isolates the player and tells him how to refine the sound." ...|$|E

500|$|During pre-season, Wenger {{arranged}} {{a meeting with}} the players to examine why they lost the league. Martin Keown felt the manager harmed their chances by boasting they could go the season unbeaten. [...] "Look, I said that because I think you can do it. But you must really want it," [...] was Wenger's reply, as he believed the squad had the right mixture of technique, intelligence and physique. Arsenal did little transfer business given the financial demands that came with their new stadium project; their only major signing was Jens Lehmann, who replaced David Seaman as goalkeeper. Wenger retained his best players, despite interest shown by Chelsea's new owner Roman Abramovich. Six games into the league season, Arsenal were involved in a brawl against Manchester United; the ill-feeling stemmed from Vieira's dismissal late on. Several players were charged and fined accordingly by the FA and Wenger apologised for his team's overreaction. The team restored their image with an entertaining performance against Newcastle; Henry Winter in his match report wrote: [...] " [...] encapsulated all that is good about Arsenal, the slick passing and intelligent movement." [...] Wenger led his side to league triumph without a single defeat – an accomplishment last achieved by Preston North End 115 years before, in the Football League. [...] "Somebody <b>threw</b> <b>me</b> a T-shirt after the trophy was presented which read 'Comical Wenger says we can go the whole season unbeaten.' I was just a season too early!," [...] he remarked during the club's victory parade.|$|E
500|$|Forman and {{his colleagues}} were {{committed}} to the strategy of casting non-professionals and utilizing dialogue improvisation whenever possible. Most of the actors were chosen from among relatives, friends and acquaintances of Forman and his crew, {{to the point where}} Forman was later to liken the atmosphere to making a [...] "home movie". For the title role, Forman selected his 18-year-old ex-sister-in-law, Hana Brejchová, not because, as was rumored at the time, he wanted revenge on his ex-wife, movie-star Jana Brejchová, but because he had known Hana a long time, trusted her, and had great respect for her natural talents: [...] "She had an amazing ability of free expression, but with the risk that she didn’t recognize the extent. However, Vlada Pucholt [...] held her firmly in the rhythm of the scene, in a professional position.” The character of Milda's father was played by the uncle of Forman's cameraman, and Milda's mother was played by a factory lathe operator whom Passer and Papoušek had met on a streetcar, and who struck them as someone who [...] "seemed so interested in things around her, no matter how silly". The factory supervisor was played by the actual public relations manager of the factory at Zruč nad Sázavou, where location shooting took place. For the main trio of reservists, Forman wanted to use non-professionals, including the writer Josef Škvorecký, but found that, while the three men did well improvising together whenever they appeared in pairs, they lost their rhythm when all three were included in the same shot. So Forman went to Škvorecký and told the writer that he looked too intelligent to play his role and replaced him with the professional actor Vladimir Mensik. [...] In Škvorecký's words: [...] "To tell someone that he is too intelligent to be an actor is a very nice way of letting him know that he should stay with screen-play writing. [...] Milos is a very considerate person. The fact that he so gently <b>threw</b> <b>me</b> out made possible the greatest scene of Loves of a Blonde". Forman was later to justify his decision to add a professional: [...] "While nonactors keep the actors honest and real, the actors give the scene the rhythm and shape that the nonactors don't feel. A nonactor inhabits the situation so completely that he or she isn't able to view it from the outside, to perceive it as a rhythmic whole with its punctuation and its larger dramatic purpose. Nonactors are perfectly content to repeat themselves and ramble on, so an actor can pull them through the dramatic arch of the scene and draw out the emotional contours of the situation." ...|$|E

At first, Earl Long let Fowler speak on the platform, but Dodd said that [...] "the public felt that I was the real Long candidate, and Fowler finally quit making our meetings. Miss Blanche <b>threw</b> <b>me</b> a couple of curves, including the printing up of some Earl Long ticket sample ballots with my number beside Fowler's name. But we caught her trick and corrected it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Nevertheless, Verdi still {{refused to}} compose the music, taking the {{manuscript}} {{back to the}} impresario the next day. But Merelli would accept no refusal and he immediately stuffed the papers back into Verdi's pocket and [...] "not only <b>threw</b> <b>me</b> out of his office, but slammed the door {{in my face and}} locked himself in". Verdi claims that gradually he worked on the music: [...] "This verse today, tomorrow that, here a note, there a whole phrase, and little by little the opera was written" [...] so that by the autumn of 1841 it was complete. At the very least, both Verdi's and Lessona's versions end with a complete score.|$|E
2500|$|The two {{planned to}} live {{together}} after Edleston grew older, but the two parted and Byron would never see the boy again as Edleston died from consumption in 1811. As well as spending time with friends, Byron did join in {{with the rest of}} the community; however, he did not enjoy this time because, as he said, [...] "I could not share in the commonplace libertinism of the place and time without disgust. And yet this very disgust, and my heart thrown back upon itself, <b>threw</b> <b>me</b> into excesses perhaps more fatal than those from which I shrunk, as fixing upon one (at a time) the passions which, spread amongst many, would have hurt only myself".|$|E

Verburgh's Janitor Union lawyer got Verburgh released on a writ of habeas corpus. Verburgh said of the experience:Oh, they hanged me up, they blindfolded me ... I can't put up my arms, they are sore.

2500|$|More than a {{thousand}} people turned out March 16, 2008, forty years after the massacre, to remember the victims {{of one of the}} most notorious chapters of the Vietnam War. The Son My Memorial drew survivors of the massacre, the families of the victims and returning U.S.war veterans alike. One survivor, who was an 8-year girl on March 16, 1968, said, [...] "Everyone in my family was killed in the My Lai massacre — my mother, my father, my brother and three sisters. They <b>threw</b> <b>me</b> into a ditch full of dead bodies. I was covered with blood and brains".

2500|$|Throughout {{the history}} of jazz, {{there have always been}} musicians who sought to combine it with {{classical}} music. Ebony Concerto is one {{in a long line of}} music from the twenties to the present day that seeks to do this. Herman said about the Concerto: [...] " [...] very delicate and a very sad piece." [...] Stravinsky felt that the jazz musicians would have a hard time with the various time signatures. [...] Saxophonist Flip Philips said, [...] "During the rehearsal [...] there was a passage I had to play there and I was playing it soft, and Stravinsky said 'Play it, here I am!' and I blew it louder and he <b>threw</b> <b>me</b> a kiss!" [...] In his own original way Stravinsky noticed the massive amount of smoking at the recording session: [...] "the atmosphere looked like Pernod clouded by water." [...] Ebony Concerto was performed live by the Herman band on March 25, 1946 at Carnegie Hall.|$|E
2500|$|Warnke's {{popularity}} {{earned him}} {{the cover of the}} September 1976 issue of the Christian magazine, Harmony. In 1977, Warnke released his second album, Jester In The King's Court. In 1978, Warnke recounted his Vietnam experiences on his third album, Hey, Doc!. His albums became [...] "the most popular Christian comedy albums ever produced". During a tour to Hazard, Kentucky, Warnke met Rose Hall, a thrice-divorced mother of three children. At this time, Warnke began courting Hall while still married to his second wife. Warnke's second marriage came to an end when, as Alberty stated in an interview, [...] " [...] <b>threw</b> <b>me</b> into a wall and split my head open. He said, 'If you go to a local hospital and tell them what your name is, I'll kill you.'" [...] Alberty fled to Florida. By November 1979, their divorce was final, and Warnke moved to Hall's farm in Kentucky. On January 2, 1980, Warnke and Hall were married.|$|E

[...] One of the men forced me {{to look into the}} mirror. [...] There I saw − not the reflection of myself, but rather of some thin, ape-like man, gruesome and horrible looking, grinding his teeth. [...] I thought to myself, 'Maybe I've really gone mad!' It was a terrible moment, but I regained my bearings and spat upon the mirror. [...] You know I think they liked that....I thought a great deal:'Will I survive or will I really go mad?' That was not good. [...] I did not have faith in myself, see?..., of course, know their business, their science. [...] But they do not know the Caucasians. [...] Maybe every Caucasian is insane, as far as they are concerned. [...] Well, who will drive whom mad? [...] Nothing developed. [...] They stuck to their guns and I to mine.

She also claims {{that she was}} only used for two-thirds of her contracted appearances. She said: [...] "In the 18 months I was in EastEnders, I had no impact. There was nothing that made people sit up and take notice of what Josie was doing. It was like they remembered I was around and <b>threw</b> <b>me</b> a line where I would slide into the bar and say, 'Hello, how are you' and then sit on a stool and say nothing {{for the rest of the}} episode. I came to feel that I was letting the black community down because my character was so empty. People of my own colour often accosted me in public and accused me of playing a token black. I was so little-used that they even wrote me cheques for episodes I never appeared in. So why did they not use me? Why are they wasting the taxpayers' money? It was very dispiriting." ...|$|E
2500|$|Recording for {{the album}} began in 1991, and {{continued}} into 1992, while {{taking place at}} Ian London Studios, North Shore Soundworks, and Power Play Studios. During this time, Redman did another collaboration with EPMD on their fourth album Business Never Personal (1992). As EPMD member Parish Smith was often credited for mentoring Hit Squad artists Das EFX and K-Solo, Erick Sermon helped mentor Redman throughout the album, while receiving co-production credits {{for most of the}} album's songs. In spite of this, Redman was still left alone throughout the majority of the writing and recording process. He later recollected [...] "For that whole album I was {{under a lot of pressure}} to learn, and learn quickly. Erick showed me a couple of recording moves, then <b>threw</b> <b>me</b> in the studio and just left me there. I had to learn and do it myself. Erick was always there if I really needed him, so it wasn't that bad. But he had his own shit to deal with and he figured I was okay on my own." [...] Redman further stated [...] "When I first started doing the album I was mad at Erick for leaving me in the studio. I was like 'what the fuck am I doing here?' I had an album to hit the world with, and it was just up to me. But I'm glad he did it, because I learned everything that I needed to." ...|$|E

They stopped performing the quad twist because it made no significant improvement to their marks, [...] making the added physical stress unnecessary. [...] Katia states in her book, [...] "My Sergei: A Love Story" [...] that this element raised her heart rate and blood pressure to levels that alarmed the Soviet team's Doctors: [...] "That summer we had learned a very difficult move called the quadruple split twist, in which Sergei <b>threw</b> <b>me</b> in the air, I did a split, then closed my legs and made four turns before he caught me.
