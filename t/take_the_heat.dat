5|$|The {{resultant}} Cleveland Street scandal implicated other high-ranking {{figures in}} British society, and rumours swept upper-class London of {{the involvement of}} a member of the royal family, namely Prince Albert Victor. The prostitutes had not named Albert Victor, and it is suggested that Somerset's solicitor, Arthur Newton, fabricated and spread the rumours to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> off his client. Letters exchanged between the Treasury Solicitor, Sir Augustus Stephenson, and his assistant, Hamilton Cuffe, make coded reference to Newton's threats to implicate Albert Victor.|$|E
25|$|On 11 November, Callaghan {{gave his}} first budget and {{announced}} increases in income tax, petrol tax {{and the introduction}} of a new capital gains tax, actions which most economists deemed necessary to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> out of the balance and sterling deficit. The budget also contained measures to increase the state pension, a measure which was disliked by the City and speculators, causing a run on the pound. On 23 November, it was decided to increase the bank rate from 2% to 7% which generated a large amount of criticism. Handling the crisis was made more difficult by the attitude of Lord Cromer, the Governor of the Bank of England, who argued against the fiscal policies of the new Labour government. When Callaghan and Wilson threatened to call a new general election, the governor soon raised a £3billion loan to stabilise the reserves and the deficit.|$|E
500|$|In June 2006, Colonel Sean MacFarland and the 1st Brigade Combat Team (BCT) of the 1st Armored Division {{were sent}} to Ramadi. Colonel MacFarland was told to [...] "Fix Ramadi, but don't do a Fallujah." [...] Many Iraqis assumed the 1st BCT was {{preparing}} for exactly that type of operation, with over 77 M1 Abrams tanks and 84 Bradley Fighting Vehicles, but Colonel MacFarland had another plan. Prior to Ramadi, the 1st BCT had been stationed in {{the northern city of}} Tal Afar, where Colonel H. R. McMaster in 2005 had pioneered a new type of operation: [...] "Clear, Hold, Build". Under McMaster's approach, his commanders saturated an area with soldiers until it had been cleared of insurgents, then held it until Iraqi security forces were gradually built to a level where they could assume control. As in other offensive operations, many insurgents fled the city in anticipation of a big battle. The 1st BCT moved into some of Ramadi's most dangerous neighborhoods and, beginning in July, built four of what would eventually become eighteen Combat Outposts. The soldiers brought the territory under control and inflicted many casualties on the insurgents in the process. On 24 July, AQI launched a counterattack, launching 24 assaults, each with about 100 fighters, on American positions. Despite the reported presence of AQI leader Abu Ayyub al-Masri, the insurgents failed in all of their attacks and lost about 30 men. Several senior American officers, including General David Petraeus, later compared the fighting to the Battle of Stalingrad. Despite the success, Multi-National Force– Iraq continued to view Ramadi as a secondary front to the ongoing civil war in Baghdad and considered moving two of Colonel MacFarland's battalions to Baghdad. Colonel MacFarland even publicly described his operations as [...] "trying to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> off Baghdad." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Goshawk was {{developed}} from the Kestrel IV prototype engine, to use evaporative (also known as [...] "steam") cooling. Rather than keep the cooling liquid below its boiling point in the cooling system, the coolant was allowed to boil; the phase change from liquid to vapour takes more heat from the engine, so less coolant is needed. However, instead of a radiator to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> from the coolant, a condensor was required to turn the vapour back to liquid. This had to be much larger than a radiator and added drag to the aircraft design.|$|E

2500|$|Media {{commentators}} stated Jackson {{was treated}} too harshly {{by the media}} and public, while Timberlake's career was not affected much by the incident. Shannon L. Holland in Women's Studies in Communication argued that the media reaction after the incident focused disproportionately on Jackson, [...] "represent her as a contemporary Jezebel in that her racial and gendered Otherness was often juxtaposed with the 'normalcy' of Timberlake's white masculinity. That is, she emerged in a public discourse as the primary (if not sole) instigator of the lewd act, a scheming seductress who manipulated Timberlake for her own economic gain." [...] In 2014, former FCC chairman Michael Powell, who had enforced fines on the conglomerates involved with the broadcast following the incident, stated: [...] "I personally thought that was really unfair. It all turned into being about her. In reality, if you slow the thing down, it's Justin ripping off her breastplate." [...] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone stated [...] "Justin isn't exactly Mr. Loyalty -- he totally left Janet Jackson to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> after the Super Bowl.'" [...] E! Online also commented [...] "Timberlake wasted no time placing the bulk of the blame for the incident on Jackson. And, of course, the woman takes the blame even though the man stripped her.

2500|$|Jobs' {{letter was}} met with mixed reactions. Bloomberg {{highlighted}} several viewpoints. David Pakman, President of non-DRM music retailer eMusic, agreed with Jobs, stating that [...] "consumers prefer {{a world where the}} media they purchase is playable on any device, regardless of its manufacturer, and is not burdened by arbitrary usage restrictions. DRM only serves to restrict consumer choice, prevents a larger digital music market from emerging, and often makes consumers unwitting accomplices to the ambitions of technology companies". Mike Bebel, CEO of music subscription service Ruckus, explained his view that the letter was an effort to shift focus, saying that [...] "This is a way for Steve Jobs to <b>take</b> <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> off the fact that he won't open up his proprietary DRM. ... The labels have every right to protect their content, and I don't see it as a vow of good partnership to turn the tables on the labels and tell them they should just get rid of all DRM... He is trying to spin the controversy." [...] An anonymous music label executive said that [...] "it's ironic that the guy who has the most successful example of DRM at every step of the process, the one where people bought boatloads of music last Christmas, is suddenly changing his tune". In an article from The New York Times, Ted Cohen, managing partner at TAG Strategic, commented that the change could be [...] "a clear win for the consumer electronics device world, but a potential disaster for the content companies". The Recording Industry Association of America put particular emphasis on Jobs' self-rejected idea about licensing its FairPlay technology to other companies, saying that such licensing would be [...] "a welcome breakthrough and would be a real victory for fans, artists and labels".|$|E
