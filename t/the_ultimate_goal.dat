Then, a forward-looking aggregate demand-aggregate supply model for a small open economy is specified, and policy discretion is included in this model. Finally, the model is estimated by a linear state space model and is used to analyse the short-run effects of a systematic monetary change. ...|$|R

5|$|The Ottoman–Russian {{occupation}} prolonged itself until 1851, {{while the}} 1849 Convention of Balta Liman awarded the Wallachian crown to Barbu Dimitrie Știrbei. In {{contrast to the}} 18481849 setbacks, the period inaugurated by the Crimean War disestablished both Russian domination and the Regulamentul Organic regime, and, within the space of one generation, brought about the fulfillment of virtually all revolutionary projects. The common actions of Moldavians and Wallachians, in pace {{with the presence of}} Wallachian activists in Transylvania, helped circulate the ideal of national unity, with <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> <b>goal</b> of reuniting all majority-Romanian territories within one state.|$|E
5|$|The module's plot {{revolves}} around {{the tomb of the}} demilich Acererak.

5|$|According to Russell's {{outlook on}} power, {{there are four}} {{conditions}} under which power ought to be pursued with moral conviction. First, it must be pursued only {{as a means to}} some end, and not as an end in itself; moreover, if it is an end in itself, then it must be of comparatively lower value than one's other goals. Second, <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> <b>goal</b> must be to help satisfy the desires of others. Third, the means by which one pursues one's goal must not be egregious or malign, such that they outweigh the value of the end; as (for instance) the gassing of children for the sake of future democracy (Russell 1938:201). Fourth, moral doctrines should aim toward truth and honesty, not the manipulation of others (Russell 1938:216–218).|$|E

5|$|Catching Pokémon {{is another}} {{essential}} element of the gameplay. While battling with a wild Pokémon, the player may throw a Poké Ball at it. If the Pokémon is successfully caught, it will come under the player's ownership. Factors in the success rate of capture include the HP of the target Pokémon {{and the type of}} Poké Ball used: the lower the target's HP and the stronger the Poké Ball, the higher the success rate of capture. <b>The</b> <b>ultimate</b> <b>goal</b> of the games is to complete the entries in the Pokédex, a comprehensive Pokémon encyclopedia, by capturing, evolving, and trading to obtain all 151 creatures.|$|E
5|$|In September 1915, {{after the}} Italian {{declaration}} of war on the Central Powers, {{the transfer of the}} B-class boats to the Adriatic was suggested by the Admiralty. Originally they were to be based at Brindisi, but this was changed to Venice as there were already 14 British and French submarines based at Brindisi. B4, B7, and B9 were the first to arrive, but B4 collided en route with the Italian tug escorting them and required immediate docking upon her arrival. B9 made the first patrol on 18 October and a total of 81 patrols were made by the B-class submarines before they ceased in October 1916. Nothing of note was directly accomplished by the submarines, but they fulfilled <b>the</b> <b>ultimate</b> <b>goal</b> of keeping the Austro-Hungarians from attacking the Italian coast.|$|E
5|$|In ancient China, {{biological}} topics can {{be found}} dispersed across several different disciplines, including the work of herbologists, physicians, alchemists, and philosophers.

The system of classical Chinese medicine usually revolved around the theory of yin and yang, and the five phases. Taoist philosophers, such as Zhuangzi in the 4th century BCE, also expressed ideas related to evolution, such as denying the fixity of biological species and speculating that species had developed differing attributes in response to differing environments.|$|E
