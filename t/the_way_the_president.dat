Phillip Graham, the publisher of The Washington Post at the time, recommended Horsky to Kennedy as the man to help improve conditions in the District, and in 1962 Horsky was appointed as the first-ever Presidential Advisor on National Capital Affairs. On Horsky's recommendation, President Kennedy changed significantly <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> presented the annual District budget to Congress. Instead of merely mentioning the DC budget in an appendix of the national budget, Horsky helped create a separate budget document including {{a statement from the}} President addressing current issues facing the District and proposing how to solve them. This structural change elevated the status and treatment of the District's annual budget by the Office of the President and {{played a key role in}} adjusting attitudes towards the District as an autonomous governmental unit, and not merely an appendage to the federal government.|$|E

40|$|The past years’ {{experience}} has proven {{that in the}} relations between the President and the Parliament, on the one hand, and between the President and the Government, on the other hand, a chain of failures appeared determined by the different interpretations of some constitutional provisions. These norms are designed {{in such a way that}} they create the possibility for some different interpretations which are not in accordance with the legislator’s intention and can cause a chain of political crises. Most discussions relate to <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> <b>President</b> designates a candidate for the office of Prime Minister when no political party has obtained an absolute majority in the Parliament, but it has formed a majority coalition in the Romanian Parliament pre or post-election. In this situation, that has been found in the past and will be found in the future in Romania, the specialists’ opinions are different, meaning that some of them identify the Parliament majority formed from multiple political parties or formations in the Parliament with the Parliament majority of a single political party, and some do not accept such an equation. This interpretation is very important because it is determinant for the person which shall be designated as candidate for the office of Prime Minister. The article emphasizes these aspects and makes proposals for the modification and expanding of some constitutional norms, so that the President’s prerogatives in his relations with the Parliament and the Government are very clearly defined. </p...|$|E

40|$|This article aims at {{examining}} {{the language of}} a political speech through the linguistic theory of pragmatics. The focus of the study is, specifically, to identify speech acts used in Buhari’s address at the 71 st session of the UN General Assembly.   Such an analysis is meant to emphasize <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>the</b> Nigerian <b>president</b> conveyed his intentions and his country’s priorities {{in line with the}} general theme of the Assembly. The paper has adopted Searle’s (1969) speech act theory. The identification of illocutionary acts in the speech through a tabulated statistics shows that there are 52. 56 % of representative acts, 19. 23 % of directive acts, 16. 66 % of expressive acts, 11. 53 % of commissive acts and  00 % of declaration acts. The findings reveal the dominance of representative illocutionary acts showing that Buhari has mainly expressed his beliefs regarding the theme of the assembly and the priorities of his country. Directive acts are used to make suggestions whereas commissives are used to point out the challenges to be taken up by Buhari and his audience and expressives reflect his psychological state while addressing the world leaders. The paper concludes that this study of speech acts has made it easy to comprehend the message of <b>the</b> Nigerian <b>president</b> in his address...|$|R
