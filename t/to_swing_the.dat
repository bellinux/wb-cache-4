5|$|Epaminondas {{was given}} {{charge of the}} Boeotian army, with the other six Boeotarchs in an {{advisory}} capacity. Pelopidas, meanwhile, was captain of the Sacred Band, the elite Theban troops. Before the battle, there was evidently much debate amongst the Boeotarchs about whether to fight or not. As a consistent advocate of an aggressive policy, Epaminondas wished to fight, and supported by Pelopidas, he managed <b>to</b> <b>swing</b> <b>the</b> vote in favour of battle.* Sage, Warfare in Ancient Greece, 138; Seager, The King's Peace, 183 During {{the course of the}} battle, Epaminondas was to display a grasp of tactics hitherto unseen in Greek warfare.|$|E
5|$|He also {{continued}} his prolific wicket-taking in the ODIs, taking eight wickets at 17.87 at an economy rate of 4.76 in three matches, including three top-order wickets in the deciding fifth ODI in Lahore. He also scored 36 runs at 36.00 in the ODIs. His ability <b>to</b> <b>swing</b> <b>the</b> ball both ways and his innings in Lahore led to speculation {{that he could}} become an all rounder. In recognition of his performances {{at the start of}} his international career, Pathan was named the ICC Emerging Player of the Year in 2004.|$|E

5|$|Taylor v. Beckham, , {{was a case}} {{heard before}} the Supreme Court of the United States on April 30 and May 1, 1900, to decide {{the outcome of the}} disputed Kentucky gubernatorial {{election}} of 1899. The litigants were Republican gubernatorial candidate William S. Taylor and Democratic lieutenant gubernatorial candidate J. C. W. Beckham. In the November 7, 1899, election, Taylor received 193,714 votes to Democrat William Goebel's 191,331. This result was certified by a 2–1decision of the state's Board of Elections. Goebel challenged the election results on the basis of alleged voting irregularities, and the Democrat-controlled Kentucky General Assembly formed a committee to investigate Goebel's claims. Goebel was shot on January 30, 1900, one day before the General Assembly approved the committee's report declaring enough Taylor votes invalid <b>to</b> <b>swing</b> <b>the</b> election to Goebel. As he lay dying of his wounds, Goebel was sworn into office on January 31, 1900. He died on February 3, 1900, and Beckham ascended to the governorship.|$|E
5|$|After lunch, Australia scored {{slowly as}} Loxton {{struggled}} {{to come to}} grips with the bowling. Yardley took the new ball in an attempt to trouble the batsmen, but instead, Loxton began to settle in as the ball came onto the bat more quickly. He lofted Pollard to the leg side, almost for six, and then hit three boundaries off another over from the same bowler. Harvey accelerated as well, and 80 minutes into the session, reached his century to a loud reception as Australia passed 250. On each occasion, umpire Frank Chester walked to the edge of the playing field and tried to inspect where the ball landed amongst the crowd, trying to see if the point of impact was beyond the original playing arena. They were ruled as sixes in any case and some thought Chester’s actions to be more for theatrical than umpiring purposes. Loxton then dominated the scoring with a display of power hitting. He brought up his 50 by hitting Cranston into the pavilion for six, eliciting spontaneous applause from the English players. It also brought up a century stand, which yielded 105 in only 95 minutes. Harvey was out for 112 from 183 balls, but not before the high run rate during the partnership had helped <b>to</b> <b>swing</b> <b>the</b> match back from England's firm control.|$|E
5|$|Pathan gained {{selection}} for the 2007–08 tour of Australia, {{but did not}} play {{in the first two}} Tests with only two pacemen chosen. Zaheer and Singh were the first-choice pace duo before the former was injured and replaced by Ishant, who had taken five wickets in the first innings of the Bangalore Test. With the Third Test held on the bouncy WACA Ground in Perth, Pathan replaced second spinner Harbhajan Singh. He batted well with scores of 28 and 46 respectively. His second innings performance came as a nightwatchman in order to shield other batsmen from the new ball late in the second day. After entering at the fall of the first wicket, he batted {{for more than two hours}} and was the sixth man to fall. Pathan rediscovered his ability <b>to</b> <b>swing</b> <b>the</b> ball, taking 2/63 and 3/54, including both Australian openers in each innings, having the hosts two wickets down in both innings before 50 runs had been scored. He had four of his victims caught behind the wicket off an edge and trapped Chris Rogers lbw. India won by 72 runs and Pathan was recognised with the man of the match award.|$|E

5|$|Throughout gameplay, {{the player}} {{encounters}} various minigames, {{which range from}} simple to more complex. The first type of minigame encountered is a battle sequence that resembles a fighting game, but no interaction from the player is required to fight. These recurring battle sequences represent when {{the members of the}} Little Busters get into physical fights with either each other or with others. Each member of the fight has a set of statistics attributed to them (which includes strength, stamina, agility, reflex, concentration, judgment, and luck) along with a life bar to keep track of how many hit points a fighter has left. The maximum number of hit points is determined by the given fighter's stamina rating. Weapons may be used along with any accessories the fighter has in their possession, and these items may be exchanged with other characters. Another recurring minigame involves the player being able to play baseball batting practice with members of the Little Busters. The player, as Riki, controls his position and when <b>to</b> <b>swing</b> <b>the</b> bat.|$|E

25|$|For {{detecting}} the targets, GL was largely ineffective. From a mechanical standpoint, the need <b>to</b> <b>swing</b> <b>the</b> entire system around for tracking presented a major problem. A more serious limitation was the displays themselves, which showed {{only a small}} portion of the sky in the range display, and a single on-target/off-target indication in bearing. Although it might be possible <b>to</b> <b>swing</b> <b>the</b> antenna in bearing to find a target, the direction was accurate to only 20 degrees, enough to keep the antennas aligned with the target, but of little use directing optical instruments onto a target, especially at night. Additionally, the bearing display only showed whether the antennas were aligned or not, but not to which side or the other the target lay if it was mis-aligned, requiring more work to determine which direction to turn the antenna for tracking.|$|E
25|$|After playing English club cricket as a {{professional}} and a few non-first-class matches for Warwickshire, Joseph Lawton was engaged as the coach to the Otago Cricket Association in 1890. He was a useful batsman, but primarily a medium-paced bowler with a low action who bowled with great accuracy and troubled batsmen with his ability <b>to</b> <b>swing</b> <b>the</b> ball.|$|E

25|$|Les Jackson was {{genuinely}} quick from a slingy action, and remarkably accurate and economical. He was able <b>to</b> <b>swing</b> <b>the</b> ball both ways and move off the seam, and his six-foot height {{enabled him to}} make the ball lift awkwardly from just short of a length. He bowled from a short run-up, which enabled him to continue bowling for lengthy periods, and was particularly difficult to play on the uncovered wickets used in county cricket.|$|E

The technique can also be used for less physical actions, such as a character looking off-screen to anticipate someone's arrival, or attention focusing on an object that a character is about to pick up.|$|E
25|$|Waqar is one {{of several}} Pakistani fast bowlers, {{beginning}} with Sarfraz Nawaz, who have been successful at bowling reverse swing, because he was used as an old-ball bowler early in his career until Imran Khan retired. In partnership with Akram, Younis opened the Pakistan bowling attack in the 1990s. Cricket critics and scholars attribute Younis and Akram {{to be one of the}} most effective fast bowling partnerships in cricket history, due to their ability <b>to</b> <b>swing</b> <b>the</b> ball at high speed. The ability to reverse swing and his speed led to him becoming one of the most talented bowlers in modern cricket.|$|E
