Previous generations of the ENose have been described in prior NASA Tech Briefs issues. Sensor selection is critical in both (prefabrication) sensor material selection and (post-fabrication) data analysis of the ENose, which detects several analytes {{that are difficult to}} detect, or that are at very low concentration ranges. Existing sensor selection approaches usually include limited statistical measures, where selectivity is more important but reliability and sensitivity are not of concern. When reliability and sensitivity can be major limiting factors in detecting target compounds reliably, the existing approach is not able to provide meaningful selection that will actually improve data analysis results. The approach and software reported here consider more statistical measures (factors) than existing approaches for a similar purpose. The result is a more balanced and robust sensor selection from a less than ideal sensor array. The software offers quick, flexible, optimal sensor selection and weighting for a variety of purposes without a time-consuming, iterative search by performing sensor calibrations to a known linear or nonlinear model, evaluating the individual sensor s statistics, scoring the individual sensor s overall performance, finding the best sensor array size to maximize class separation, finding optimal weights for the remaining sensor array, estimating limits of detection for the target compounds, evaluating fingerprint distance between group pairs, and finding the best event-detecting sensors...|$|R

40|$|The {{utilization}} of CO 2 to produce life support consumables, such as O 2 and H 2 O, via the Sabatier reaction {{is an important}} aspect of NASA <b>s</b> <b>cabin</b> Atmosphere Revitalization System and In-Situ Resource Utilization architectures for both low-earth orbit and long-term manned space missions. In the current International Space Station (ISS) and other low orbit missions, metabolically-generated CO 2 is removed from the cabin air and vented into space, resulting in a net loss of O 2. This requires a continuous resupply of O 2 via water electrolysis, and thus highlights the need for large water storage capacity. For long-duration space missions, the amount of life support consumables is limited and resupply options are practically nonexistent, thus atmosphere resource management and recycle becomes crucial to significantly reduce necessary O 2 and H 2 O storage. Additionally, the potential use of the Martian CO 2 -rich atmosphere and Lunar regolith to generate life support consumables and propellant fuels is of interest to NASA. Precision Combustion, Inc. (PCI) has developed a compact, lightweight Microlith(Registered TradeMark) -based Sabatier (CO 2 methanation) reactor which demonstrates the capability of achieving high CO 2 conversion and near 100 % CH 4 selectivity at space velocities of 30, 000 - 60, 000 hr- 1. The combination of the Microlith(Registered TradeMark) substrates and durable, novel catalyst coating permitted efficient Sabatier reactor operation that favors high reactant conversion, high selectivity, and long-term durability.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} behavior of prejudiced discourse in the most representative narratives against inhumane slavery written in Cuba and the United States in the nineteenth century: Autobiografía de un esclavo, by Juan Francisco Manzano; Francisco, by Anselmo Suárez y Romero; Narrative of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave, by Frederick Douglass; and Uncle Tom 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Cabin,</b> by Harriett Beecher Stowe. This study deals with the identification between race and slavery {{that occurred in the}} American continent, using racial prejudice to justify the enslavement of human beings. Such concepts were maintained, diffused and perpetuated by the dominant discourse. ^ In the nineteenth century, intellectuals from both Cuba and the United States were highly influenced by the modern philosophical ideas rooted in the European Enlightenment. These ideas contradicted by principle the 2 ̆ 2 peculiar institution 2 ̆ 2 of slavery, which supported {{a great deal of the}} economy of both nations. This conflict of principles was soon reflected in literature and led to the founding of Cuban and African-American narrative respectively. The common exposure to slavery brought together two nations otherwise highly dissimilar in historical and cultural circumstances. Based on the theories of discourse by Foucault, Terdiman, and van Dijk, the analysis of the discourse displayed in these literary works helps understand how discourse is utilized to subvert the dominant discourse without being expelled or excluded by it. This subversion was successfully accomplished in the American narratives, while only attempted in the Cuban works, given Cuba 2 ̆ 7 s colonial status and the compromised economic loyalties of the Delmontino cenacle which produced these works. ...|$|R

Along with popular literature, she was also writing and publishing tracts, novels, and articles on the conditions Native Americans were living under after a century {{of dealing with the}} U.

While the nonfiction A Century of Dishonor, written after extensive research and intrepid travel, brought attention to what was happening to Indians, it was Ramona that captured the public 2 ̆ 7 s imagination.

40|$|In {{this work}} an {{application}} was developed which uses the Sequential Quadratic Pro- gramming (SQP) optimisation algorithm to optimise boundary absorption {{in order to}} reduce the sound pressure level in a localised sampling region in a small enclosure over a low frequency range. Three different boundary absorber models were used; an unconstrained complex impedance, a porous absorber and a composite absorber. Absorbers were applied either as panels or using smaller area patches. Experiments were performed to test the methodology on a simplified computationally conservative rectangular enclosure, specially designed to be computationally efficient, and on a more realistic and computationally intensive train driver 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>cabin.</b> The methodology was shown to be successful since the sound pressure level in the localised sampling region was reduced significantly on average in all cases tested. The sound pressure was not only reduced from the initial random designs used to initiate the optimi- sation but also from the rigid and uniform absorption backgrounds. Furthermore the global sound pressure level evaluated over the entire enclosure was also reduced, a desirable side effect of the local optimisation. Remarkably, patch applications of absorber were shown to be very successful at reducing the local sound pressure level despite their small area (i. e. approximately one sixth the size of a panel). Even using just one or two patches could have a significant effect. In general, the results validate the use of optimisation for acoustic design of small enclosures, and since re-alistic boundary absorption was designed and placed in a realistic train drivers cabin to reduce the real problem of lowering sound level for the train driver, optimisation has been demonstrated to be a practical approach for real world problems...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} considers how Hawthorne 2 ̆ 7 s, Dickinson 2 ̆ 7 s, and Stowe 2 ̆ 7 s writing {{express the}} prevailing culture 2 ̆ 7 s {{attitudes toward the}} operation of meaning in religion. It poses the question: Is a crisis of meaning threatening to the religious sensibility? Looking at Hawthorne 2 ̆ 7 s The Scarlet Letter and specific poems of Dickinson, I show how their writing gestures {{to a kind of}} religious sensibility that is not threatened by such a crisis, but suggests, rather, that it is essential to a genuine openness to otherness, and ultimately to the Divine. The fiction and poetry of these two authors express this both negatively, as an attack on conventional religion as well as particular nineteenth-century trends in religion, but also positively by expressing themes of possibility and hope in a posture of uncertainty. It is also expressed through their particular use of associative language and metaphor. By emphasizing the ever-shifting mechanism of signification, their writing emphasizes the contingency of language and of subjectivity. This contingency is experienced in the chaos of physical desire and suggests that it is not antithetical to religious belief but the very foundation of it, challenging the common religious binary of the spirit and the flesh. The historical conflation of the material realm with women leads this discussion in areas of feminist thought and theory, in particular, l 2 ̆ 7 é;criture fé;minine, due to the emphasis on language materiality. Stowe 2 ̆ 7 s writing in Uncle Tom 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Cabin</b> supports another stream of religious thought that relies more on discreet boundaries and assurances of belief. By appealing to common Christian principles in the novel, Stowe relies on and reinforces universal religious and ethical constructs. Her use of sentimental rhetoric is based on assumptions that clearly delineate between right and wrong, male and female, and even black and white. All writing around the same time, Hawthorne 2 ̆ 7 s, Dickinson 2 ̆ 7 s, and Stowe 2 ̆ 7 s texts express attitudes toward religion that would later burgeon within American culture and are still prominent today...|$|R
40|$|The German writer Ernst Kreuder (1903 – 1972, Büchner Prize 1953), {{best known}} for his book Die Gesellschaft vom Dachboden (The Attic Pretenders, 1946), the very first book by a German author {{published}} in Germany after World War 2, {{is now one of the}} lesser known authors to both academic circles and the general public. The academic interest in Kreuder 2 ̆ 7 s work has been focused primarily on his role as a postwar writer, either in connection with romantic tradition, social criticism or in the context of autobiography. This dissertation offers a new reading of Kreuder 2 ̆ 7 s work in the intersection between literature and ecology. The fact that the relationship between man and nature from the ecological point of view was not the object of literary representation in German prose until the 1970 s makes Kreuder one of the pioneers of the ecological approach in West German literature. The analysis of Kreuder 2 ̆ 7 s works presented in this dissertation lies within the scope of a relatively new research paradigm in German literary studies, the “ecologically oriented” literary criticism, which has developed as a continuation of, and later parallel to, the Anglo-American Ecocriticism. This dissertation argues that, through the constant creation and reinvention of forms of literary representation of the relationship between man and nature, Kreuder developed in his works a conceptually sophisticated and aesthetically appealing ecologically oriented Weltanschauung, which manifests itself differently in his various works and culminates at the end of Kreuder 2 ̆ 7 s literary career in his last novel, Der Mann im Bahnwärterhaus (The Man in the Signalman 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Cabin,</b> 1974, posth.). Methodologically my research and interpretation is based on the discursive models developed by Hubert Zapf in the functional approach of the cultural ecology, which examines the ecological function of the fictional texts in the cultural context. The outcome of this research includes an appreciation of the ecological potential of Kreuder 2 ̆ 7 s work, provides insight into strategies and techniques employed by Kreuder to express the ecological concepts, and positions Ernst Kreuder among the pioneers of the ecologically oriented literature. This ultimately contributes to a critical reexamination of the literary canon of 20 th Century German literature. ...|$|R

40|$|Offshore {{shipbuilding}} {{industry is}} known for its highly customized products, which are in most cases tailor-made for specific missions. Being a traditionally conservative industry, it follows conventional design practices. Because of the urge to quickly respond to changing market situations and the need for a structured method to reuse design knowledge across different projects, modern design methodologies like modularization are of considerable interest in this industry. To implement modular thinking, it has to overcome many challenges such as non-functional engineering description of design, scaling, clustering, logistical issues, structural complexities etc. Different modular methodologies can be adopted to establish a modular product platform. Modular Function Deployment (MFDTM) is a popular theory of modularization with five distinct steps to identify the objects that should be modularized and optimize them for the whole manufacturing system. Application of MFDTM method reveals that among various spaces inside the accommodation of an OSV, crew single, crew double and officer <b>s</b> <b>cabins</b> are the most appropriate ones to be modularized. Based on the output of MFDTM method and the vessel database from System Based Ship Design (SBSD) approach for OSVs, a decision support framework has been developed to assist the naval architect of the vessel to design the accommodation block. Standardized templates are used for arrangement of the modules. The spaces in the accommodation are categorized into three module classes. The DSF can calculate the optimum size, type and location of the modules according to design requirements and system constraints. The vessel database is used here to determine the required area for the spaces that are not standardized. The DSF is demonstrated by an illustrative example and later by a simplified real case study. A mock up of a user interface has also been developed to give an idea of user interaction with a computer tool based on the DSF. For the real case study, a small program has been developed containing some 1200 + lines of code, which can process simplified accommodation design cases. To build an effective DSS for designing the accommodation block of OSVs, standardization of spaces by modularization must be done with enough room for flexibility of design by designer intervention. This DSF exhibits the underlying logics and structure of such DSS, which can be very useful to the designers upon further development...|$|R
40|$|American Abolitionist Geographies {{argues that}} {{literary}} abolition was {{a movement that}} challenged the geographic integrity of the American nation. As a category of literary texts emerging in dialogue with the most active years of the American abolitionist movement (1840 – 1861), I argue that literary abolition accentuated the anti-national and counter-national investments of abolitionism. In the years 1840 – 1850, literary abolitionism engaged with the persons, locales and texts of the international (and particularly British) antislavery movement. In the years between 1850 and {{the outbreak of the}} Civil War in 1861, literary abolitionism turned geographically inward. During this latter period, literary abolitionism criticized the expansionist tendencies of the state by focusing on the insuperability of regional differences and on the hidden resistant histories within regions. Literary abolitionism, I conclude, made possible a surprising range and complexity of geographic reference that has gone unrecognized by Americanist critics 2 ̆ 7 persistently nationalist reading strategies. ^ Chapter 1 begins by examining the centrality of both Garrisonian abolitionism and West Indian emancipation to Ralph Waldo Emerson 2 ̆ 7 s famous 1841 essay, “Self-Reliance. ” The chapter goes on to analyze how Emerson 2 ̆ 7 s 1844 “Address on the Emancipation of the Negroes in the British West Indies” both engages with the rhetoric of abolitionism and proposes a novel ethics of non-mastery to match the address 2 ̆ 7 s politics. Chapter 2 explores William Wells Brown 2 ̆ 7 s changing attitudes toward the British West Indies as both reformist exemplum and possible destination for fugitives displaced by the Fugitive Slave Law. Brown 2 ̆ 7 s dialectical engagement with British reformism, the chapter argues, conditioned his shift toward a more revolutionary politics. Chapter 3 offers a reassessment of Harriet Beecher Stowe 2 ̆ 7 s politics of space in Uncle Tom 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Cabin</b> by arguing against a critical consensus that the novel endorses the ideology of manifest destiny. Chapter 4 examines Stowe 2 ̆ 7 s Dred, James Redpath 2 ̆ 7 s The Roving Editor, and multiple works by Thomas Wentworth Higginson to document a broad shift in the literature of late abolitionism toward the maroon warrior as an object of radical identification and the maroon community as a place of refuge. ...|$|R
40|$|In A Key to Uncle Tom 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Cabin</b> (1853), Harriet Beecher Stowe {{identifies}} 2 ̆ 2 {{two great}} foundation principles of slave jurisprudence; namely, that a slave cannot bring a suit {{in any case}} [...] . and that a slave cannot bear testimony in any case in which whites are implicated. 2 ̆ 2 Despite the official 2 ̆ 2 rejection of colored testimony 2 ̆ 2 in both Northern and Southern courtrooms, African-Americans repeatedly took the witness stand against slavery throughout the antebellum period. Presenting themselves, in Frederick Douglass 2 ̆ 7 words, as 2 ̆ 2 eye-witness (es) to the cruelty 2 ̆ 2 of slavery and their narratives, in Harriet Jacobs 2 ̆ 7 phrase, as 2 ̆ 2 testimony to [...] . what Slavery really is, 2 ̆ 2 African-American former slaves joined abolitionists like Stowe in indicting slaveholders before {{the court of public}} opinion. They did so by consistently employing in their antislavery writing a juridical metaphor that figured slavery as a crime, slaveholders as perpetrators and defendants, slaves as victims and eyewitnesses, abolitionists as advocates for the slave, and the American reading public as judge and jury. Although the dissertation focuses on the works of literary abolitionists Douglass, Stowe, and Jacobs, I contend that participants on all sides of the controversy used the juridical metaphor to frame their contributions to the national debate over slavery, thereby contributing to the emergence of a culture of testimony. I trace the popularity of the juridical metaphor to three sources: the power of legal discourse in the early republic, the widespread association of slavery with the law through precedent-setting court cases and landmark legislation, and the inherent inclusiveness of the trial process 2 ̆ 7 adversarial structure, which encouraged full (albeit stratified) participation. Reading Douglass 2 ̆ 7 Narrative (1845) and My Bondage and My Freedom (1855), Stowe 2 ̆ 7 s Dred (1856), and Harriet Jacobs 2 ̆ 7 Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl (1861), I consider how literary abolitionists drew on the juridical metaphor not only to indict the peculiar institution, but also to negotiate the relationship between former slaves and their white sympathizers in the antebellum culture of testimony. For African-Americans, I conclude, the witness stand proved to be at once a liberating and a confining space from which to address the court of public opinion. ...|$|R
40|$|The fact {{of class}} {{has been a}} {{powerful}} tool {{in the process of}} identity formation, particularly in the American South, which has been viewed as a region apart from the national imaginary. To counter this exclusion, Southerners have often relied on stereotypes. One of the most prevalent and tragic of these is the stereotype of poor white trash, a construction that has been utilized to insist upon elite white Southerners 2 ̆ 7 exceptionalism and innocence and to assert their rightful place in American historiography. While it is difficult to calculate their level of success, as perceptions of the region have varied through the decades, the destructive power of white trash cannot be disputed. This work utilizes a number of texts to demonstrate the myriad ways in which white trash, a relatively static construction of undesirable attitudes and beliefs since the antebellum era, has nonetheless been adapted to promote disparate agendas. At the same time, I explore the impact of the epithet on poor whites themselves, examining the stereotype 2 ̆ 7 s deleterious effects upon the economically disadvantaged and politically powerless. In Uncle Tom 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Cabin,</b> Harriet Beecher Stowe uses the threat of upper-class contamination by white trash to expose the ills of slavery. Charles Chesnutt 2 ̆ 7 s The Marrow of Tradition demonstrates the displacement of the nation 2 ̆ 7 s long and shameful history of African-American disfranchisement onto white trash. In his Snopes trilogy, William Faulkner attempts to negotiate Southern past and present through white trash 2 ̆ 7 s intrusion on civilized society. Erskine Caldwell tries to shed light on poor white oppression, but his Tobacco Road is too steeped in stereotype to prove his assertions. In Deliverance, James Dickey fashions white trash monsters to exacerbate middle-class fears of poor white mobility, and Harry Crews 2 ̆ 7 s A Childhood: The Biography of a Place examines the poor white 2 ̆ 7 s initial resistance but ultimate resignation to the limiting functions of the stereotype. A hopeful shift in poor white depictions occurs in Dorothy Allison 2 ̆ 7 s Bastard Out of Carolina and Amy Greene 2 ̆ 7 s Bloodroot, two works which seek to confront the stereotype and call for a reevaluation of the beliefs and practices that have suppressed poor whites for centuries...|$|R
40|$|In EEOC v. Lee 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> Log <b>Cabin,</b> the Seventh Circuit {{followed}} the Supreme Court precedent {{of the last}} decade that has increasingly narrowed the determination of what constitutes a disabled individual under the Americans with Disabilities Act. In 2008, Congress passed the ADA Amendments Act in an attempt to restore the ADA to its original purpose and the original vision of the ADA 2 ̆ 7 s drafters and supporters. Whether these amendments will produce dramatic changes in the way the administrative agencies and courts apply the ADA remains to be seen. Nonetheless, the only way the ADA or its amendments will successfully protect against disability discrimination is if the concept of disability in America changes along with the laws. To help break down the myths, stereotypes, and fears surrounding the concept of disability that continues today, this article suggests that instead of the dichotomous nature of determining disability, we instead consider everyone to be on a continuum of disability. By locating every individual on the disability spectrum, not only do we change the concept of disability, but we also make it easier for people to fall under the protections of the ADA so that a determination of discrimination claims can be based on the merits of the case, not merely on a narrow rendering of the definition of disability...|$|R

40|$|In White-Smith Music Co. vs. Apollo Co. (1908), the United States Supreme Court {{rules that}} player pianos (2 ̆ 2 pianolas, 2 ̆ 2 for short) perform no {{activity}} against which a musical composer might reasonably seek copyright protection. The Constitution 2 ̆ 7 s copyright guarantees, the Court reasons, govern only 2 ̆ 2 {{the concrete and}} not [...] . the abstract right of property 2 ̆ 2 [...] protect 2 ̆ 2 the tangible thing, 2 ̆ 2 or 2 ̆ 2 copy, 2 ̆ 2 which, distinct from 2 ̆ 2 the intellectual conception, 2 ̆ 2 requires (and presumes) the presence of 2 ̆ 2 a written or printed record of it in intelligible notation. 2 ̆ 2 Music, a clearly intangible thing, can only become tangible, receive protection, and satisfy the standard of intelligibility when transformed into a writing. These conditions do not obtain, it concludes, with the pianola. ^ The Court 2 ̆ 7 s dilemma (that of fixing intangible sound as a property) arises from the novel forms of property made available by the inventions of the late-nineteenth century [...] phonographs and player pianos introduce the ephemeral property of sound; cinema transforms an ever-elusive motion, a recognized literary property, {{as well as a}} carnate yet intangible 2 ̆ 2 personality 2 ̆ 2 into less familiar (and, hence, legally suspect) forms of cinematic property. How is the acoustic sign, necessarily ephemeral and intangible, to be 2 ̆ 2 fixed 2 ̆ 2 as property? How is motion, a temporal as well as spatial phenomena that seems incapable of clear demarcation, to be turned into a recognizable property of the medium of film? Etienne-Jules Marey 2 ̆ 7 s claim that motion expresses une langue inconnue of the human body, one captured, in the end, by his methode graphique, betrays a shared set of mechanisms between legal semiotics and technological form. Similarly, Thomas Edison 2 ̆ 7 s claim that his phonograph is best suited to 2 ̆ 2 letter-writing [...] . dictation 2 ̆ 2 and the reproduction of books anticipates the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s dilemma, as well as its efficacious legal mechanisms and rhetoric. ^ There are numerous ways in which the narrative and textual forms of early cinema elucidate the Court 2 ̆ 7 s dilemma in White-Smith. The various turn-of-the-century versions of Harriet Beecher Stowe 2 ̆ 7 s Uncle Tom 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Cabin</b> mark significant steps in the transformation of literary property into cinematic property; the late-nineteenth century products of the earliest film production companies struggle to give shape to motion and the body 2 ̆ 7 s langue inconnue; the event of history is turned into cinematic property in D. W. Griffith 2 ̆ 7 s The Birth of a Nation (1915); and recorded sound marks a pivotal shift in cinematic practice in The Jazz Singer (1927). Importantly, each of these moments deals, via a number of explicit means, with blackness. The Subject of Property looks to these and other texts for evidence of the problem (and efforts toward the resolution) of the complex discrepancy between the material and the immaterial. This dissertation argues that, through rhetorical, legal, and structural means, blackness figures the breach between the corporeal, visible, and tangible, on the one hand, and the incorporeal, invisible, and intangible, on the other, lending to the latter properties present in the former. ...|$|R
