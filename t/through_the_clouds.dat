B-17 pilotless drone aircraft were flown <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>clouds,</b> and a drone light tank was used to recover soil samples from the crater. Unfortunately, it became bogged and had to be towed out ten days later.|$|E

Introduced by Steve Martin and Itzhak Perlman.|$|E
5|$|The repentant Carl goes outside, {{only to see}} Russell sailing {{off with}} some {{balloons}} and the propulsive leaf blower to try to rescue Kevin. By throwing out his furniture and keepsakes, Carl manages to lighten the house enough to follow. Russell is captured by Muntz, but Carl manages to board the dirigible, tether the house, and free Russell and Kevin. Dug inadvertently saddles Alpha with his cone of shame and becomes the dogs' new leader. Muntz pursues them around the airship, trapping Dug, Kevin and Russell inside Carl's house. Carl lures Kevin back onto the airship, with Dug and Russell clinging to her back. Muntz leaps after them, but snags his foot on some balloon lines and falls to his death. The house then descends out of sight <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>clouds.</b>|$|E

5|$|Upon {{returning}} to Ark Royal, the Swordfish loaded torpedoes equipped with contact detonators. The second attack comprised fifteen aircraft and was launched at 19:10. At 20:47, the torpedo bombers began their attack descent <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>clouds.</b> As the Swordfish approached, Bismarck fired her main battery at Sheffield, straddling the cruiser with her second salvo. Shell fragments rained down on Sheffield, killing {{three men and}} wounding several others. Sheffield quickly retreated under cover of a smoke screen. The Swordfish then attacked; Bismarck began to turn violently as her anti-aircraft batteries engaged the bombers. One torpedo hit amidships on the port side, just below the bottom edge of the main armour belt. The force of the explosion was largely contained by the underwater protection system and the belt armour but some structural damage caused minor flooding.|$|E
5|$|No. 77 Wing {{conducted}} further {{combat operations}} during early March. On {{the second of}} the month, 24 Vengeances attacked Japanese positions on Karkar Island, encountering only light anti-aircraft gunfire. Over the next two days the wing targeted Japanese positions on the Rai coast in preparation for a US Army landing scheduled for 5 March. On 3 March, Nos. 23 and 24 Squadrons attacked Mindiri village and a nearby camp site. Aircraft from all three of the wing's squadrons attacked a camp at Pommern Bay on two occasions the next day. One Vengeance was damaged in a forced landing. The US Army unit's landing at Mindiri on 5 March did not encounter any opposition. On 8 March a force of 36 Vengeances from all three of No. 77 Wing's squadrons was dispatched to strike Rempi village near Alexishafen. Due to bad weather, No. 23 Squadron aborted its attack, and bombed a target {{to the north of the}} village. The other two squadrons successfully approached Rempi by making shallow dives <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>clouds,</b> and bombed the target area. Four Vengeances were lightly damaged by anti-aircraft fire.|$|E
5|$|On 8 January 1967, the VPAF High Command {{convened a}} meeting to examine what had gone wrong. The actions of 2 January had exposed the flawed tactics {{employed}} by MiG-21 pilots; they broke <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>clouds</b> too quickly, {{and they did not}} join up with each other before they attacked the U.S. fighters waiting above them. The VPAF High Command then devised a new tactic which required the deployment of between two or four aircraft for each attack, with a maximum of ten aircraft for each mission to perform guerrilla-style attacks on U.S. bomber formations. Furthermore, after they had examined U.S. air tactics, North Vietnamese commanders decided that MiG-17 pilots should attack U.S. formations from either side, while MiG-21 pilots would strike from above. Before the North Vietnamese Air Force could implement their new tactics, however, the VPAF 921st Fighter Regiment was withdrawn from combat for several months to recover from the bloody defeat it had suffered as a result of Operation Bolo.|$|E

5|$|Attempting {{his usual}} tactic, the British crew {{approached}} {{from behind and}} below. Suddenly the Heinkel lurched into a tight left-hand turn allowing the gunners to fire a broad-side. The bomber disappeared into the mist. Cunningham asked GCI for help. They tracked the Heinkel flying north near Shaftesbury. Engaging again the German pilot managed {{to turn into a}} head-on position and dive past almost upside down. He continually evaded Cunningham by turning in underneath him at near-impossible angles. Cunningham and Rawnsley came to understand they were not dealing with a novice. Soon a turning match began and then the German attempted to escape by twisting and diving. Cunningham forced him down to 900 feet but Rawnsley and GCI lost contact when the ground clutter hid the Heinkel's signal. Cunningham returned to base. News soon came through the He 111 had crashed onto the slopes on Cranborne Chase. Apparently, the Heinkel had broken <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>clouds</b> at only a hundred feet and dived vertically into the ground near the isolated village of Alvediston at 17:05. Intelligence later determined that the machine was a He 111H-6, Werknummer 4627, code 6N+FR, from 7./KGr 100. The bomber disintegrated upon impact. The pilot, Staffelkapitän ("squadron leader") Hauptmann Siegried Langer was killed along with his crew; Oberfeldwebel G. Schmidt, Feldwebel D. Hoffmann, P. Gaidies and Gefreiter W. Worring. It was a unique victory for Cunningham. He had not fired his guns in the 150-minute chase.|$|E
25|$|For {{several years}} {{following}} the eruption, {{it was reported that}} the moon appeared to be blue and sometimes green.

25|$|Another {{problem was}} navigation. As night-flying aids {{in a day}} fighter were rudimentary, an {{elaborate}} system of visual aids to navigation had to be established, encompassing light beacons, searchlight patterns, flak guns firing combinations of various tracer colours <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>clouds</b> and parachute flares. To {{make up for the}} lack of visual aids initially, converted bomber pilots had to be used, because they already had experience with navigating at night. Another navigation aid was simply the Allied bombing target; a city illuminated as it burned would guide the fighters to their target.|$|E

25|$|Of the 20 serials {{making up}} the two missions, nine plunged into the cloud bank and were badly dispersed. Of the six serials which {{achieved}} concentrated drops, none flew <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>clouds.</b> However the primary factor limiting success of the paratroop units, because it magnified all the errors resulting from the above factors, was the decision to make a massive parachute drop at night, a concept that was not again used in three subsequent large-scale airborne operations. This was further illustrated when the same troop carrier groups flew a second lift later that day with precision and success under heavy fire.|$|E

25|$|In 1891 the Silver Beach Amusement Park {{was opened}} on land between {{the lake and}} mouth of the river in St. Joseph. Logan Drake and Louis Wallace bought the land from the Pere Marquette Railroad and added cottages to lure {{tourists}} to the lake front. As the park aged and grew in popularity, the pair added many attractions, including concessions, games, pool, a boardwalk and different rides. The first roller coaster was built in 1904 and was called the Chase <b>Through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Clouds,</b> which {{was replaced by the}} Velvet roller coaster (renamed the Comet). Among the most popular attractions were the carousel and the Shadowland Ballroom, built in 1927. During the 1960s and 1970s, the buildings decayed and the crowds decreased. Finally, crime in the park caused it to be shut down by police in 1970.|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{after this}} engagement, {{a group of}} over one dozen Zeros broke through the cloud layer above Intrepids divisions.

500|$|From above [...] U.S. F-4 fighters had {{a greater}} energy level over North Vietnamese MiG-17 and MiG-21 fighters, and U.S. pilots had no trouble seeing or {{identifying}} North Vietnamese fighters flying up from below. Furthermore, weather conditions on the day allowed radar and missile systems on the F-4 fighters to perform at their maximum level, an advantage which U.S. pilots fully exploited as North Vietnamese MiG fighters flew up to engage them. Just after 3:00pm North Vietnamese MiG-21 fighters appeared <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>clouds</b> and began attacking U.S. fighters circling above. One by one the MiG-21 fighters were picked off by AIM-7 and AIM-9 missiles launched by U.S. pilots.
