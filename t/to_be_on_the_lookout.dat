5|$|On April 6, 2007 at {{approximately}} 10 AM, Howard and Maureen Cotterman drove from Mexico to the Lukeville Port of Entry (POE). Upon arrival, the inspector checked the U.S. Customs and Border Protection electronic database {{and found a}} computer-generated alert, based upon Howard Cotterman's prior conviction for child sex crimes in 1992. The alert advised the inspector <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> for child pornography and due to the warning, the Cottermans were sent to a secondary inspection area.|$|E

25|$|Additional {{testimony}} {{indicated that}} Detective Scott inquired of a railroad engineer named Rush, where {{would be the}} worst place for a train wreck. Rush pointed out the high bridge where, if a rail was pulled, the train would crash three or four hundred feet down an embankment, killing or injuring all on the train. Scott told Rush <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> for damaged track that night at that spot. Later that evening Rush stopped his train, walked ahead on the track and discovered that spikes had been pulled.|$|E
25|$|Rustin and Walter Fauntroy {{negotiated}} some {{security issues}} with the government, gaining approval for private marshals {{with the understanding that}} these {{would not be able to}} act against outside agitators. The FBI and Justice Department refused to provide preventive guards for buses traveling through the South to reach D.C. William Johnson recruited more than 1,000 police officers to serve on this force. Julius Hobson, an FBI informant who served on the March's security force, told the team <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> for FBI infiltrators who might act as agents provocateurs.|$|E
25|$|Fouke {{estimated}} {{the man to}} be 35–45 years old, while the kids who observed the killer in Stine's cab mentioned he was 25–30 year old white male adult at about 5'8"-5'9". The radio dispatcher had alerted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> for a black suspect, so they drove past him without stopping; the mix-up in descriptions remains unexplained to this day. A search ensued, but no possible suspects were found. The three teen witnesses worked with a police artist to prepare a composite sketch of Stine's killer; then, a few days later, this police artist returned, working with the witnesses to prepare a second composite sketch of the killer.|$|E

Originally, the Convention decided that only two choices <b>were</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ballot: restoration of responsible government and the continuation of the Commission of Government.|$|R

A yellow life raft was later spotted by Omahas lookouts. The occupants were German sailors that had survived the sinking of their boat, , that had been sunk by a Consolidated PB4Y-1 Liberator from Bombing Squadron (VB) 107 that was operating out of Ascension Island. U-177 had been sitting on the surface while some of the crew where sunning and swimming.|$|E

2500|$|Initial {{deliveries}} went to {{post offices}} on Monday, May 13. Aware {{of the potential}} for inverts, a number of collectors went to their local post offices to buy the new stamps and {{keep an eye out for}} errors. Collector William T. Robey was one of those; he had written to a friend on May 10 mentioning that [...] "it would pay <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> for inverts". On May 14, Robey went to the post office to buy the new stamps, and as he wrote later, when the clerk brought out a sheet of inverts, [...] "my heart stood still". He paid for the sheet, and asked to see more, but the remainder of the sheets were normal.|$|E
2500|$|Pirates did {{not have}} the luxury of {{building}} their ships; they were [...] "acquired." [...] As a result, a pirate captain had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> for a vessel that would serve his purpose and procure the ship without harming {{it in such a way}} as to make it unfit for service. There is consensus among scholars that pirates would use both small vessels like a sloop or a full-rigged pinnace, as well as the larger slave ships (but not as often), and on rare occasions the warship. Along these lines, the naval historian David Cordingly categorized pirate attacks that had been reported along the North American seabord between 17101730. by the numbers of recorded attacks, with an overwhelming 55% involving sloops, 25% in the larger ships, 10% in brigs and brigantines, 5% in schooners, 3% in open sail-less boats, and 2% in snows.|$|E

2500|$|Prince {{was caught}} in February 1991 after he tried to break into a Scripps Ranch house. A woman, whom he had {{followed}} home from the Miramar Road health club, {{was getting ready to}} shower when she heard a noise at the front door. She ran from the house and sought help from a neighbor who came and confronted Prince. Prince claimed he was trying to find a female friend who had entered the woman's home but eventually gave up and scuttled away. The eyewitnesses took down Prince's license plate number and identified Prince from photographs, and he was arrested on [...] {{in the parking lot of}} a health club after police alerted health club workers <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> for Prince's automobile. After his arrest, he agreed to provide blood and saliva samples, and the DNA results connected him to the murder of Janene Weinhold. That murder connected him to the others by the pattern presented by the murders.|$|E
2500|$|By April 23, Lt. John Costello of the Hinman Street station {{told reporters}} that every [...] "kidnapping" [...] clue had been exhausted. He was sure Elsie had been [...] "attacked and mistreated," [...] was now dead, and her body hidden in the cellar of an empty house or deserted barn. He brought detectives to begin {{investigating}} empty buildings, barns, sheds, elevators, catchbasins, and basements on or near South Albany Avenue. Several of the detectives brought spades planning to dig in every plot of earth that {{appeared to have been}} recently disturbed. [...] Inspector Healey joined in this search along with Detectives Perry and Egan. At the same time, Costello sent two officers to {{the outskirts of the city}} on a lead which he had received by telephone but refused to reveal to reporters. Capt. Stephen Wood of the detective bureau was having all [...] "gypsy" [...] wagons followed and wrote to every police official in the vicinity of Belvidere, Rockford and Janesville, Wisconsin <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>lookout</b> for Elsie. However, he too was now certain Elsie was either being held for ransom, had been in an accident and was either dead or in some hospital, unable to speak, or had been [...] "slain by some degenerate" [...] from one of the shanties in the alley near her home.|$|E
