50|$|In 1968 Wedberg and Lewis {{reported}} {{on the distribution of}} widespread <b>translocation</b> <b>heterozygosity</b> and supernumerary chromosomes in C. williamsonii.They found that there was a correlation between <b>translocation</b> <b>heterozygosity</b> and supernumerary chromosomes and habitat. Populations in the yellow pine forest consistently had low frequencies of <b>translocation</b> <b>heterozygosity</b> and low frequencies of supernumerary chromosomes. Populations in foothill woodlands had high frequencies of both chromosomal types. They concluded that <b>translocation</b> <b>heterozygosity</b> had an adaptive role in woodland habitats but not at the higher elevations; it was theorized that <b>translocation</b> <b>heterozygosity</b> was helping to preserve genetic heterozygosity under conditions of enforced inbreeding that would occur at low elevations from periodic drought. The supernumerary chromosomes could have provided either more genetic variability or have been a biproduct of <b>translocation</b> <b>heterozygosity,</b> and occur as a matter of chance.|$|E
5000|$|A unique {{feature of}} this species is its {{tendency}} to have widespread reciprocal translocations. Wedberg et al. http://www.jstor.org/stable/2406654?seq=1 showed that populations of this plant {{in the foothills of}} California had frequencies of <b>translocation</b> <b>heterozygosity</b> approaching 50%, while those in higher elevations in alpine regions have frequencies of less than 10%.|$|E

40|$|The Endangered Allen Cays Rock Iguana (Cyclura cychlura inornata) is {{endemic to}} the Allen Cays, a tiny cluster of {{islands in the}} Bahamas. Naturally {{occurring}} populations exist on only two cays (< 4 ha each). However, populations of unknown origin were recently discovered on four additional cays. To investigate patterns of genetic variation among these populations, we analyzed nuclear and mitochondrial markers for 268 individuals. Analysis of three mitochondrial gene regions (2, 328 bp) and data for eight nuclear microsatellite loci indicated low genetic diversity overall. Estimates of effective population sizes based on multilocus genotypes were also extremely low. Despite low diversity, significant population structuring and variation in genetic diversity measures were detected among cays. Genetic data confirm the source population for an experimentally translocated population while raising concerns regarding other, unauthorized, <b>translocations.</b> Reduced <b>heterozygosity</b> {{is consistent with a}} documented historical population decline due to overharvest. This study provides the first range-wide genetic analysis of this subspecies. We suggest strategies to maximize genetic diversity during ongoing recovery including additional translocations to establish assurance populations and additional protective measures for the two remaining natural populations...|$|R
40|$|Break-induced {{replication}} (BIR) is {{an important}} process of DNA metabolism that has been implicated in the restart of collapsed replication forks, {{as well as in}} various chromosomal instabilities, including loss of <b>heterozygosity,</b> <b>translocations,</b> and alternative telomere lengthening. Therefore, knowledge of how BIR is carried out and regulated is important for better understanding the maintenance of genomic stability in eukaryotes. Here we present a new yeast experimental system that enables the genetic control of BIR to be investigated. Analysis of mutations {{selected on the basis of}} their sensitivity to various DNA-damaging agents demonstrated that deletion of POL 32, which encodes a third, nonessential subunit of polymerase δ, significantly reduced the efficiency of BIR, although some POL 32 -independent BIR was still observed. Importantly, the BIR defect in pol 32 Δ cells was associated with the formation of half-crossovers. We propose that these half-crossovers resulted from aberrant processing of BIR intermediates. Furthermore, we suggest that the half-crossovers observed in our system are analogous to nonreciprocal translocations (NRTs) described in mammalian tumor cells and, thus, our system could represent an opportunity to further study the NRT mechanism in yeast...|$|R
40|$|The {{overall goal}} of this {{collaborative}} project {{was to investigate the}} role in malignant cells of both chromosome telomeres, and telomerase, the enzyme that replicates telomeres. Telomeres are highly conserved nucleoprotein complexes located at the ends of eucaryotic chromosomes. Telomere length in somatic cells is reduced by 40 [...] 50 nucleotide pairs with every cell division due to incomplete replication of terminal DNA sequences and the absence of telomerase, the ribonucleoprotein that adds telomere DNA to chromosome ends. Although telomerase is active in cells with extended proliferative capacities, including more than 85 % of tumors, work performed under this contract demonstrated that the telomeres of human cancer cells are shorter than those of paired normal cells, and that the length of the telomeres is characteristic of particular types of cancers. The extent of telomere shortening ostensibly is related to the number of cell divisions the tumor has undergone. It is believed that ongoing cell proliferation leads to the accumulation and fixation of new mutations in tumor cell lineages. Therefore, it is not unreasonable to assume that the degree of phenotypic variability is related to the proliferative history of the tumor, and therefore to telomere length, implying a correlation with prognosis. In some human tumors, short telomeres are also correlated with genomic instabilities, including interstitial chromosome <b>translocation,</b> loss of <b>heterozygosity,</b> and aneuoploidy. Moreover, unprotected chromosome ends are highly recombinogenic and telomere shortening in cultured human cells correlates with the formation of dicentric chromosomes, suggesting that critically short telomeres not only identify, but also predispose, cells to genomic instability, again implying a correlation with prognosis. Therefore, telomere length or content could be an important predictor of metastatic potential or responsiveness to various therapeutic modalities...|$|R
50|$|Research {{has been}} done in order to test the {{hybridization}} between different species of the genus Gaura and to describe why many members of this genus are so similar morphologically. According to Carr et al., Gaura biennis is readily crossbred with Gaura longiflora, showing it is a direct derivative from G. longiflora, but the specialized feature of permanent <b>translocation</b> <b>heterozygosity</b> set G. biennis apart as a unique genetic system amongst the genus.|$|E
40|$|Sex-associated and {{floating}} translocation complexes {{are characteristic of}} dioecious species of  Viscum,  but are virtually absent in monoecious species. The majority of dioecious species has fixed sex-associated translocation complexes with the male being the heterozygous sex. The sex-associated multivalent is usually O 4 (ring-of-four) or O 6, rarely O 8. Dioecious species without sex-associated translocations are much less common. Most of the dioecious species are also polymorphic for floating translocations, producing one or more additional multivalents ranging from O 4 to O 12. Floating translocations may be more frequent in species {{that do not have}} sex-associated translocations. Supernumerary chromosomes are also present in several species. Sex ratios are at unity in most dioecious species, but female-biased ratios may occur in some species. The high correlation between dioecy and <b>translocation</b> <b>heterozygosity</b> suggests that translocations are primarily associated with the origin and establishment of dioecy. Any róle in the maintenance of biased sex ratios through meiotic drive is probably secondary. Sex-associated translocations may serve to stabilize dioecy by bringing the sex factors into close linkage. Subsequent structural rearrangements within a sex-associated translocation complex may bring the sex factors together in one chromosome pair, releasing floating translocations. The high frequencies of floating <b>translocation</b> <b>heterozygosity</b> in some species indicate that such heterozygosity also has adaptive value. </p...|$|E
40|$|Meiotic {{nondisjunction}} can {{be induced}} by external agents, such as heat, radiation, and chemicals, and by internal genotypic alterations, namely, point mutations and chromosomal rearrangements. In many cases, nondisjunction arises from a reduction or elimination of crossing over, {{leading to the}} production of homologous univalents which fail to co-orient on the metaphase plate and to disjoin properly. In some organisms, e. g., Drosophila and perhaps man, distributive pairing (i. e., a psot-exchange, size-dependent pairing) ensures the regular segregation of such homologous univalents. When a nonhomologous univalent is present, which falls within a size range permitting nonhomologous recognition and pairing, distributive nondisjunction of the homologues may follow. Examples of nondisjunction induced by inversion heterozygosity, <b>translocation</b> <b>heterozygosity,</b> chromosome fragments, radiation, heat, and recombination-defective mutants are presented...|$|E
40|$|Drug {{resistance}} {{has become}} a major problem in the treatment of Candida albicans infections. Genome changes, such as aneuploidy, <b>translocations,</b> loss of <b>heterozygosity,</b> or point mutations, are often observed in clinical isolates that have become resistant to antifungal drugs. To determine whether these types of alterations result when DNA repair pathways are eliminated, we constructed yeast strains bearing deletions in six genes involved in mismatch repair (MSH 2 and PMS 1) or double-strand break repair (MRE 11, RAD 50, RAD 52, and YKU 80). We show that the mre 11 Δ/mre 11 Δ, rad 50 Δ/rad 50 Δ, and rad 52 Δ/rad 52 Δ mutants are slow growing and exhibit a wrinkly colony phenotype and that cultures of these mutants contain abundant elongated pseudohypha-like cells. These same mutants are susceptible to hydrogen peroxide, tetrabutyl hydrogen peroxide, UV radiation, camptothecin, ethylmethane sulfonate, and methylmethane sulfonate. The msh 2 Δ/msh 2 Δ, pms 1 Δ/pms 1 Δ, and yku 80 Δ/yku 80 Δ mutants exhibit none of these phenotypes. We observed an increase in genome instability in mre 11 Δ/mre 11 Δ and rad 50 Δ/rad 50 Δ mutants by using a GAL 1 /URA 3 marker system to monitor the integrity of chromosome 1. We investigated the acquisition of drug resistance in the DNA repair mutants and found that deletion of mre 11 Δ/mre 11 Δ, rad 50 Δ/rad 50 Δ, or rad 52 Δ/rad 52 Δ leads to an increased susceptibility to fluconazole. Interestingly, we also observed an elevated frequency of appearance of drug-resistant colonies for both msh 2 Δ/msh 2 Δ and pms 1 Δ/pms 1 Δ (MMR mutants) and rad 50 Δ/rad 50 Δ (DSBR mutant). Our data demonstrate that defects in double-strand break repair lead to an increase in genome instability, while drug resistance arises more rapidly in C. albicans strains lacking mismatch repair proteins or proteins central to double-strand break repair...|$|R
40|$|Many Oenothera {{species are}} {{complete}} translocation heterozygotes and arose by hybridization. Since complete <b>translocation</b> <b>heterozygosity</b> suppresses nuclear genetic recombination, examination of any chloroplast gene effects on hybridization is particularly suitable in these flowering plants. ^ To verify translocation status in Oenothera villaricae, Oe. picensis ssp. picensis and lines of their interspecific hybrids, meiotic figures {{from parents and}} hybrids were obtained using confocal optical sectioning (a new application of this technique). These data confirm published results, and are consistent with a bivalent-forming common ancestor which underwent translocations to produce each of the parent species. The full translocation ring appeared in {{only one of the}} four possible hybrid nuclei. ^ Oenothera species of hybrid origin form translocation rings at meiosis; progenitor species are structurally homozygous and form seven bivalents.

40|$|The {{permanent}} translocation heterozygote, Rhoeo spathacea shows {{a characteristic}} ring of all chromosomes at metaphase-I of male meiosis. Elimination of bivalent formation completely due to extreme heterozygosity poses a special problem for reductional division at meiosis-I where the maternal and the paternal sets {{need to be}} separated to different poles. Unlike bivalent meiosis, the functions of SC formation, pairing and recombination required for reductional segregation have to be fulfilled by only telomeres which are the only areas of contact among the chromosomes in the ring. The participation of telomeres in these events assumes significance {{in view of the}} balanced lethal gene system imposed by <b>translocation</b> <b>heterozygosity,</b> and the particular requirement that only alternate chromosomes segregated to the same pole results in fertile pollen. This paper throws some light on the telomere functions in R. spathacea in the light of our present understanding of telomere biology. The prospects of using R. spathacea as a model organism to dissect molecular aspects of several telomere related functions are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Salient {{features}} of the first meiotic division are independent segregation of chromosomes and homologous recombination (HR). In no sexually reproducing, homozygous species studied to date HR is absent. In this study, we constructed the first linkage maps of homozygous, bivalent-forming Oenothera species and provide evidence that HR was exclusively confined to the chromosome ends of all linkage groups in our population. Co-segregation of complementary DNA-based markers with the major group of AFLP markers indicates that HR has only a minor role in generating genetic diversity of this taxon despite its efficient adaptation capability. Uneven chromosome condensation during meiosis in Oenothera may account for restriction of HR. The use of plants with ancient chromosomal arm arrangement demonstrates that limitation of HR occurred before and independent from species hybridiza-tions and reciprocal translocations of chromosome arms—a phenomenon, which is widespread in the genus. We propose that consecutive loss of HR favored the evolution of reciprocal translocations, beneficial superlinkage groups and ultimately permanent <b>translocation</b> <b>heterozygosity...</b>|$|E
40|$|Spermatogenic dysfunction, {{characterized}} by {{varying degrees of}} spermatogenic arrest and enhanced production of morphologically abnormal spermatozoa, {{has been reported in}} mammals heterozygous for certain chromosome translocations, especially those involving an X chromosome. However, the effects of chromosome translocations on spermatogenesis and fertility in organisms with male homogameity, such as birds, remain largely unknown. To investigate possible spermato-genie anomalies owing to <b>translocation</b> <b>heterozygosity,</b> we used domestic fowl singly or doubly heterozygous for 2 different Z-autosome translocations. The analysis of 10 different semen charac-teristics in groups of cockerels bearing the translocations revealed no significant difference from a control group bearing the normal chromosome complement. Estimates of the fertilizing ability of spermatozoa collected from cockerels within each karyotypic group also were not significantly different. These results indicate that 1) neither the fertilizing ability nor the phenotype of sper-matozoa is adversely affected by their chromosome complement and 2) the spermatogenic process in the domestic fowl is not arrested by meiotic barriers which, as reported for mammals, act to prevent the transmission of certain chromosome translocations. Results obtained from the domestic fowl are discussed in terms of proposed genetic mechanisms for spermatogenic dysfunction in mammalian translocation heterozygotes...|$|E
40|$|The {{flowering}} plant genus Oenothera is uniquely suited for studying molecular mechanisms of speciation. It assembles an intriguing combination of genetic features, including permanent <b>translocation</b> <b>heterozygosity,</b> biparental transmission of plastids, {{and a general}} interfertility of well-defined species. This allows an exchange of plastids and nuclei between species often resulting in plastome–genome incompatibility. For evaluation of its molecular determinants we present the complete nucleotide sequences of the five basic, genetically distinguishable plastid chromosomes of subsection Oenothera (=Euoenothera) of the genus, which are associated in distinct combinations with six basic genomes. Sizes of the chromosomes range from 163 365 bp (plastome IV) to 165 728 bp (plastome I), display between 96. 3 % and 98. 6 % sequence similarity and encode a total of 113 unique genes. Plastome diversification is caused by an abundance of nucleotide substitutions, small insertions, deletions and repetitions. The five plastomes deviate from the general ancestral design of plastid chromosomes of vascular plants by a subsection-specific 56 kb inversion within the large single-copy segment. This inversion disrupted operon structures and predates the divergence of the subsection presumably 1 My ago. Phylogenetic relationships suggest plastomes I–III in one clade, while plastome IV appears to be closest to the common ancestor...|$|E
40|$|Presently Mertensia echioides Benth. (Boraginaceae) {{collected}} from Kashmir Himalaya, India, is cytologically analyzed {{for the first}} time revealing 2 n= 2 x= 24 (diploid). Interestingly we found 4. 3 – 6. 2 % syncytic meiocytes/PMCs with 2 n= 4 x= 48 (tetraploid) in addition to normal meiocytes (2 n= 24) during male meiosis. These comparatively larger PMCs (pollen mother cells) lead to the formation of fertile giant 2 n pollen grains. A frequency of 6. 4 – 13. 3 % PMCs shows transfer of chromatin material at prophase-I and, therefore, results in aneuploid meiocytes. Whole chromatin transfer by the process of cytomixis could also have {{led to the formation of}} tetraploid cells. <b>Translocation</b> <b>heterozygosity</b> is also evident in the form of multivalents in 12 – 17 % diploid (2 x) meiocytes at diakinesis and metaphase-I and is reported {{for the first time}} in this species. The syncytes formed depict open chain hexavalent and quadrivalent formation in the three populations with different frequencies. Moreover chromatin stickiness at metaphase-I is observed in 45 % of PMCs in population- 1 (P- 1). Syncyte or unreduced PMC formation leading to unreduced fertile gametes is here speculated to act as a possible way out for infraspecific polyploidization in the species...|$|E
40|$|The {{karyotype}} of Baccharis coridifolia DC., a dioecious diploid species {{consists of}} 16 chromosomes with median (m) and 2 with submedian centromeric positions (sm) (2 n = 18). Meiotic analyses of 219 male plants belonging to 12 populations showed {{across a wide}} geographical range one quadrivalent and seven bivalents in all of them. The quadrivalent involves the four biggest m chromosomes and probably constitutes a sex multivalent carrying in tight linkage the sex genes and provides a mechanism whereby permanent <b>translocation</b> <b>heterozygosity</b> is maintained. In metaphase I alternate orientation of the quadrivalent was predominant (85. 71 %). Fourteen megaspore mother cells were analyzed and did not show the quadrivalent. A model for the origin and maintenance of the sexual translocation system is presented. It is assumed {{that there are two}} non-allelic factors M and n; M would be a dominant female suppresor and n a recessive male-suppresor. The excess of male plants observed in several populations at different localities might result from heterotic effects of some gene complexes carried by the translocation. This excess probably ensures a good supply of pollen for the vagaries of insect pollination at flowering time. Fil:Wulff, A. F. Universidad de Buenos Aires.

40|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} is nearly universal among eukaryotes. Theory {{predicts that the}} rarity of asexual eukaryotic species is in part caused by accumulation of deleterious mutations and heightened extinction risk associated with suppressed recombination and segregation in asexual species. We tested this prediction with a large data set of 62 transcriptomes from 29 species in the plant genus Oenothera, spanning ten independent transitions between sexual and a functionally asexual genetic system called permanent <b>translocation</b> <b>heterozygosity.</b> Illumina short-read sequencing and de novo transcript assembly yielded an average of 16. 4 Mb of sequence per individual. Here, we show that functionally asexual species accumulate more deleterious mutations than sexual species using both population genomic and phylogenetic analysis. At an individual level, asexual species exhibited 1. 8 higher heterozygosity than sexual species. Within species, we detected {{a higher proportion of}} nonsynonymous polymorphism relative to synonymous variation within asexual compared with sexual species, indicating reduced efficacy of purifying selection. Asexual species also exhibited a greater proportion of transcripts with premature stop codons. The increased proportion of nonsynonymous mutations was also positively correlated with divergence time between sexual and asexual species, consistent with Muller’s ratchet. Between species, we detected repeated increases in the ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous divergence in asexual species compared with sexually reproducing sister taxa, indicating increased accumulation of deleterious mutations.

40|$|Genic {{heterozygosity}} and variation {{were studied}} in the permanent translocation heterozygotes Oenothera biennis I, Oe. biennis II, Oe. biennis III, Oe. strigosa, Oe. parviflora I, Oe. parviflora II, and in the related bivalent formers Oe. argillicola and Oe. hookeri. From variation at 20 enzyme loci, we find that <b>translocation</b> <b>heterozygosity</b> for the entire chromosome complex is accompanied by only moderate levels of genic heterozygosity: 2. 8 % in Oe. strigosa, 9. 5 % in Oe. biennis and 14. 9 % in Oe. parviflora. Inbred garden strains of Oe. argillicola exhibited 8 % heterozygosity; neither garden nor wild strains of Oe. hookeri displayed heterozygosity and only a single allozyme genotype was found. The mean number of alleles per locus is only 1. 30 in Oe. strigosa, 1. 40 in Oe. biennis, and 1. 55 in Oe. parviflora, compared to 1. 40 in Oe. argillicola. Clearly, the ability to accumulate and/or retain heterozygosity and variability has not been accompanied by extraordinary levels of either. Clinal variation is evident at some loci in each ring-former. A given translocation complex may vary geographically in its allozymic constitution. From gene frequencies, Oe. biennis I, II, and III, Oe. strigosa and Oe. hookeri are judged to be very closely related, whereas Oe. argillicola seems quite remote; Oe. parviflora is intermediate to the two phylads. Gene frequencies also suggest that Oe. argillicola diverged from the Euoenothera progenitor about 1, 000, 000 years ago, whereas {{most of the remaining}} evolution in the complex has occurred within the last 150, 000 years...|$|E
40|$|More than 200 {{years after}} the {{discovery}} of the platypus, monotreme chromosomes remain deeply puzzling. Karyotypes of both sexes were claimed to contain a set of chromosomes for which no homologues could be identified. At male meiosis these presumably translocated chromosomes assemble in a multivalent chain involving the X chromosome. Such a system of <b>translocation</b> <b>heterozygosity</b> is unprecedented in vertebrates, although similar systems are found naturally in some plants and a few social insects. Mice heterozygous for autosomal translocations can be deliberately bred, but have severe meiotic defects and produce high proportions of aneuploid sperm. The number, identity and homology relationships of the translocated chromosomes have been controversial over the past 30 years, as has their role in sex determination and their segregation to form balanced gametes. In order to solve the complex chromosome system in platypus we have generated chromosome paints for 20 platypus chromosomes and hybridised these paints on male and female metaphase chromosomes as well as meiotic cells and sperm. Five paints show a different hybridisation pattern on male and female chromosomes. Four chromosomes (including the X) were identified that are present in one copy in males and in two copies in females. Additionally, four male-specific chromosomes have been identified that detect no homologues in females, but share sequences with other unpaired chromosomes. One of these has complete homology to the short arm of the X. BAC clones from one of the male specific chromosomes contain male-specific sequences. Position of these chromosomes at different meiotic stages revealed a consistent order of chromosomes within the meiotic chain. Co-localisation of these elements on mature sperm provides the first direct evidence that two different sperm types are produced as a result of alternate segregation in platypus.
