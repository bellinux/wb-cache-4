Structures can {{be far more}} elaborate than a single thin film: films can be stacked up to give strong iridescence, to combine two colours, or to balance out the inevitable change of colour with angle to give a more diffuse, less iridescent effect. Each mechanism offers a specific solution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> creating a bright colour or combination of colours visible from different directions.|$|E
5|$|According to the anti-nuclear movement, {{most of the}} {{problems}} with nuclear power today are much the same as in the 1970s. Nuclear reactor accidents still occur and there is no convincing solution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> long-lived radioactive waste. Nuclear weapons proliferation continues to occur, notably in Pakistan and North Korea, building on facilities and expertise from civilian nuclear operations. The alternatives to nuclear power, efficient energy use and renewable energy (especially wind power), have been further developed and commercialised.|$|E
5|$|Einstein {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> thermodynamic fluctuations, {{giving a}} {{treatment of the}} density variations in a fluid at its critical point. Ordinarily the density fluctuations are controlled by the second derivative of the free energy {{with respect to the}} density. At the critical point, this derivative is zero, leading to large fluctuations. The effect of density fluctuations is that light of all wavelengths is scattered, making the fluid look milky white. Einstein relates this to Rayleigh scattering, which is what happens when the fluctuation size is much smaller than the wavelength, and which explains why the sky is blue. Einstein quantitatively derived critical opalescence from a treatment of density fluctuations, and demonstrated how both the effect and Rayleigh scattering originate from the atomistic constitution of matter.|$|E

5|$|Following initial {{interest}} in brachytherapy in Europe and the US, its use {{declined in the}} middle of the twentieth century due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> radiation exposure to operators from the manual application of the radioactive sources. However, the development of remote afterloading systems, which allow the radiation to be delivered from a shielded safe, and the use of new radioactive sources in the 1950s and 1960s, reduced the risk of unnecessary radiation exposure to the operator and patients. This, together with more recent advancements in three-dimensional imaging modalities, computerised treatment planning systems and delivery equipment has made brachytherapy a safe and effective treatment for many types of cancer today.|$|E
5|$|Historian Robert Powell {{opined that}} Wickliffe's break from party loyalty may explain {{his lack of}} {{committee}} appointments in his early years in the House. Beginning in 1829, however, he chaired the Committee on Public Lands. In this capacity, he attacked Clay's plan to distribute surplus revenue among the states as being unfair to younger states. He also differed with Clay over Clay's willingness to limit slavery. He wrote Clay concerning his slowness to respond <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> fugitive slaves; Clay never responded. Neither was Wickliffe loyal to the Jacksonian platform, however. In {{a letter to his}} brother, he lamented Jackson's attacks on the Second Bank of the United States.

5|$|John Hick {{published}} Evil and the God of Love in 1966, {{in which}} he developed a theodicy {{based on the work}} of Irenaeus. Hick distinguished between the Augustinian theodicy, based on free will, and the Irenaean theodicy, based on human development. Hick framed his theodicy as an attempt to respond <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> evil in light of scientific development, such as Darwin's theory of evolution, and as an alternative to the traditionally accepted Augustinian theodicy. Rejecting the idea that humans were created perfectly and then fell away from perfection, Hick instead argued that humans are still in the process of creation. He interpreted the fall of man, described in the book of Genesis, as a mythological description of the current state of humans.|$|E

5|$|Many of the {{important}} mathematical applications of mirror symmetry belong to the branch of mathematics called enumerative geometry. In enumerative geometry, one is interested in {{counting the number of}} solutions to geometric questions, typically using the techniques of algebraic geometry. One of the earliest problems of enumerative geometry was posed around the year 200 BCE by the ancient Greek mathematician Apollonius, who asked how many circles in the plane are tangent to three given circles. In general, the solution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> Apollonius is that there are eight such circles.|$|E

When Albert Einstein formulated his theory of general relativity (GR) {{he turned his attention}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> Mercury's orbit and found that his theory added a correction, which could account for the discrepancy.

5|$|Natural {{selection}} therefore {{explains why}} wheels are an unlikely solution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> locomotion: a partially evolved wheel, missing {{one or more}} key components, would probably not impart an advantage to an organism. The exception to this is the flagellum, the only known example of a freely rotating propulsive system in biology; {{in the evolution of}} flagella, individual components were recruited from older structures, where they performed tasks unrelated to propulsion. The basal body that is now the rotary motor, for instance, might have evolved from a structure used by the bacterium to inject toxins into other cells. This recruitment of previously evolved structures to serve new functions is called exaptation.|$|E

5|$|The Irenaean theodicy is a Christian theodicy {{designed}} to respond <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> evil. As such, it defends {{the probability of}} an omnipotent and omnibenevolent (all-powerful and perfectly loving) God {{in the face of}} evidence of evil in the world. Numerous variations of theodicy have been proposed which all maintain that, while evil exists, God is either not responsible for creating evil, or he is not guilty for creating evil. Typically, the Irenaean theodicy asserts that the world is {{the best of all possible}} worlds because it allows humans to fully develop. Most versions of the Irenaean theodicy propose that creation is incomplete, as humans are not yet fully developed, and experiencing evil and suffering is necessary for such development.|$|E
5|$|The {{model of}} {{diplomatic}} {{spheres of influence}} resulting from the Congress of Vienna in 1814–15 after the Napoleonic Wars endorsed Austrian dominance in Central Europe. The negotiators at Vienna took no account of Prussia's growing strength within and among the German states and so failed to foresee that Prussia would rise to challenge Austria for leadership of the German peoples. This German dualism presented two solutions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> unification: Kleindeutsche Lösung, the small Germany solution (Germany without Austria), or Großdeutsche Lösung, the greater Germany solution (Germany with Austria).|$|E
5|$|The second {{approach}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>of</b> sets {{belonging to}} themselves took as its base {{the notion of}} class, and defines a set as a class which belongs to other classes, while a proper class {{is defined as a}} class which does not belong to other classes. Under the Zermelo–Fraenkel approach, the axioms impede the construction of a set of all sets which do not belong to themselves. In contrast, under the von Neumann approach, the class of all sets which do not belong to themselves can be constructed, but it is a proper class and not a set.|$|E
