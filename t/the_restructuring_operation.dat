40|$|Abstract: Data {{restructuring}} {{is often}} an integral but non-trivial part of information processing, especially when the data structures are fairly complicated. This paper describes the underpinnings of a program, called the Restructurer, that relieves the user of the �thinking and coding &quot; process normally associated with writing procedural programs for data <b>restructuring.</b> <b>The</b> process is accomplished by the Restructurer in two stages. In the �rst, the di�erences in the input and output data structures are recognized and the applicability ofvarious transformation rules analyzed. The result is a plan for mapping the speci�ed input to the desired output. In the second stage, the plan is executed using embedded knowledge about both the target language and run-time e�ciency considerations. The emphasis {{of this paper is}} on the planning stage. <b>The</b> <b>restructuring</b> <b>operations</b> and <b>the</b> mapping strategies are informally described and explained with mathematical formalism. The notion of solution of a set of instantiated forms with respect to an output form is then introduced. Finally, itisshown that such a solution exists if and only if the Restructurer produces one. Key Words: non-�rst normal form databases, data restructuring, instantiated forms, hierarchical structures, solution of a set of instantiated forms. Category: H. 2, E. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we pursue {{the study of}} Alignment Calculus, a {{declarative}} string database query language that supports both string querying and restructuring. This language is aimed for applications such as molecular biology databases, where the basic data type is a string, and the queries are combinatorial in nature. The declarative nature of our language does, however, require some additional effort in its implementation. Here we solve this problem by first defining a domain independent syntactic subset of the full language and then developing a query evaluation mechanism for this sublanguage. This mechanism then handles <b>the</b> required <b>restructuring</b> <b>operations</b> in a finite manner. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{electronic}} commerce over the Internet, business transactions are frequently long-duration activities, exhibit complex interaction dependencies, and {{are prone to}} failures or unpredictable situations. As an adaptive engineering approach todeveloping exible and reliable {{electronic commerce}} systems, we present the distributed transactional activity model (TAM) in this paper and report our experience in designing and implementing TAM. A distinct feature {{of this approach is}} the utilization of a family of dynamic activity <b>restructuring</b> <b>operations</b> that allow ongoing transactional activities to bypass some unexpected execution bottlenecks, and the notion of validity thatprovides correctness guarantees for <b>the</b> activity <b>restructuring</b> <b>operations.</b> Another advantage of TAM is its facilities that help business process designers to deal with business structure changes adaptively and incrementally. Our implementation method is based on component technology and using plug-in adaptors on top of commercial OLTP systems. We argue that TAM, its dynamic activity <b>restructuring</b> <b>operations,</b> and our implementation method together provide a viable and practical foundation towards e ectively building and e ciently managing electronic commerce applications. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{link between}} <b>restructuring</b> <b>operations</b> and <b>the</b> {{increase}} of accidents for blue-collar workers in plants is well proved by academic literature. However, several large industrial companies publish accidents decrease indicators {{in spite of}} <b>the</b> continuous <b>restructuring</b> <b>operations.</b> A monograph on a multinational steel corporation shows that this paradox is explained by two factors : risk prevention measures introduced by the management for various reasons (moral, financial, competitive, media-related); development of diverse forms of “quantitative disappearance” of injuries in the workplace. In the Belgian plants studied, blue-collar workers face a continual dilemma between preserving their physical well-being and protecting their position (and future) fragilized by various uncertainties. In this regard, continuous restructuring have multi-dimensional effects on the management of workers’ health and safety, the reporting of injuries, but also on blue-collars ambivalent attitudes to danger and accidents...|$|R

40|$|Towards a {{restructuring}} of Flemish secondary education: Evaluative remarks ex-ante from a Dutch perspective The Flemish administration opts {{for a major}} <b>restructuring</b> of <b>the</b> secondary education system. Its major objectives are narrowing the gap between low and high achieving students, decreasing the reproduction of socioeconomic inequalities and reducing the disparity between the school environment and outside world. This article discusses {{some of the most}} notable aspects of <b>the</b> planned <b>restructuring</b> <b>operation,</b> namely <b>the</b> underlying problem analysis, the decision to promote early specialisation for specific content areas, the (assumed) equivalence of these content areas, the decision not to interfere with the organizational structure of schools (comprehensive vs. selective) and the choice for constructivist oriented teaching. The current plans for educational restructuring in Flanders show some striking similarities with attempts previously undertaken in the Netherlands.

40|$|There is a {{conspicuous}} absence {{in the literature}} on local authority economic policies of any wide searching analysis of local Government as an institution of the state and component of the overall State structure. This research on economic policy development in Cleveland has arisen from the need to undertake a more in depth critical approach to understanding the mechanisms of local economic policy formation in relation to State intervention in the economy. The major objectives of this research are:(1) Analyse and evaluate State economic policy initiatives in the Teesside and Cleveland economy with particular emphasis upon the development of local government policies;(2) From the above analysis, identify central constraints upon the formation and implementation of policies and consider the underlying reasons for there being a gap between policy objectives and outcomes as well as the existence of conflicts and tensions which arise in the course of policy development. The Study concentrates upon two major components of local government economic policy: industrial land allocation (in relation to steel and chemicals), industrial estate provision and urban renewal in Middlesbrough - the latter two policies forming a central plank in achieving objectives for diversifying the local economy. After discussing the emergence of consensus policies about perceived problems and solutions the Thesis concentrates upon the impacts of these policies. These impacts can be identified in <b>the</b> <b>restructuring</b> <b>operations</b> of ICI and BSC which have been facilitated by local authority infrastructural provision, land management policies and Regional Development Grant expenditures. The Thesis argues that with the failure to attract new service and other types of 'growth' industry to compensate for job losses in the base manufacturing industry the local economy is undergoing a severe structural crisis giving rise to unemployment rates the highest in mainland Britain. The current situation owes much to the forces of international competition and changes in the international division of labour in petro-chemical production, the mobility of capital and general responses to the crisis in profitability (in the case of BSC, crisis in financial structure). This crisis has sharpened the conflict of interests over policy objectives - between the environmental lobby, interests representing 'capital intensive' industries, community groups, small businesses, central Government etc. The Thesis concludes by analysing how these developments raise critical questions about whether there is still a consensus around policy objectives and about the possibilities of local and central State economic planning...|$|R

The theoretical aim is to establish a conceptual framework for logistics. The concept of logistics is analysed and Logistics Concept development is suggested as a particular approach to the design of effective logistics systems. In the past 5 or 10 years, the manufacturing industry has been under constant pressure to improve competitiveness and logistics is generally seen as one of the important means. Both the literature and the practice highlight numerous examples of how effective logistics may contribute to manufacturing excellence, but the logistics manager who asks how to deploy logistics in his specific situation may find the answers and concepts quite diffuse and ambiguous.
