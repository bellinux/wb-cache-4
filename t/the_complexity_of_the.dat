5|$|A {{problem with}} early bombsights {{was that they}} could only correct {{for the effects of}} the wind in a simple way and {{required}} the bomber to fly directly up- or down-wind from the target, to minimise <b>the</b> <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> required calculations. This made it difficult to attack moving targets and allowed anti-aircraft artillery to sight their weapons along the wind line.|$|E

5|$|At dawn on 6 April, the JNA {{launched}} a fresh attack towards Kupres and Kupreška Vrata, leaving {{the bulk of}} the 13th Partisan Brigade in reserve and employing the rest of the force at the plateau. The artillery was used so intensely that the 30th Partisan Division had to request resupply of its depleted stocks. The most effective part of the advance was the 9th Tank Company, which quickly pushed through the defensive positions, bypassed Zlosela and reached Olovo. In contrast, the Bosnian Croat TO command in Kupres was overwhelmed by <b>the</b> <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> situation and could not track which units it had at its disposal—even losing track of units physically near the command post.|$|E

There are also some resemblances to the early rodents Ivanantonia from Asia and Nonomys from North America, but Ivanantonia has a central groove and lacks fossae, and Nonomys has a prominent cingulum (shelf) {{at the edges of the}} tooth and also lacks the fossae of LACM 149371.|$|E
5|$|Because of <b>the</b> <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{missile and}} the need for {{extensive}} testing prior to launch, the V-2's designers at the Peenemünde Army Research Center favoured using heavily defended fixed sites where the missiles could be stored, armed, and fuelled from an on-site LOX production plant before launching. But the German Army and the V-2 project's head, Major-General Walter Dornberger, were concerned that the sites would be vulnerable to aerial attack by the Allies. The Army's preferred option was to use Meillerwagens, mobile firing batteries, which presented a much smaller target for the Allied air forces.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{critical}} acclaim, The Wire received poor Nielsen ratings, which Simon attributed to <b>the</b> <b>complexity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plot; a poor time slot; heavy use of esoteric slang, {{particularly among the}} gangster characters; and a predominantly black cast.

5|$|Sir Gawain and the Green Knight {{was adapted}} into an opera called Gawain by Harrison Birtwistle, first {{performed}} in 1991.

This opera uses Sir Gawain as the backdrop but refocuses {{the story on}} Gawain's female squire, Gwyneth, {{who is trying to}} become a knight. Plowman's version was praised for its approachability, as its target is the family audience and young children, but criticised for its use of modern language and occasional preachy nature.|$|E
