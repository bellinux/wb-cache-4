5|$|At midnight, Homer quietly {{gets out}} of bed, visits each family member, who are all asleep, and says goodbye. Feeling glum, {{he goes to the}} living room and listens to Larry King read the Bible on tape. The tape plays out to which {{suddenly}} his head drops and it appears he has succumbed to the poison. Marge awakens the next morning and is panicked that her husband is not by her side. She runs downstairs and finds Homer, collapsed in the armchair. As she mourns, she realizes that his drool is still warm. She wakes him up and drums in {{the fact that he is}} alive and had not been poisoned after all. Homer then prances around in an overjoyed state and vows to live life to its fullest. Back to living his normal life, Homer returns <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> watching a bowling tournament and eating pork rinds.|$|E
5|$|Homer trips over Bart's {{skateboard}} {{and falls}} down the stairs, hurting his back, and is confined <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> for several days. Marge sends Bart to clean {{his room and}} while doing so, he discovers an old cherry bomb among his things. At school the next day, he decides to flush it down the toilet in the boys' restroom with friends, Milhouse, Richard and Lewis. On the same day, Principal Skinner's mother, Agnes, is visiting the school and Bart ends up pulling his prank the same time Agnes is using the facilities in an adjacent girls' restroom. The resulting explosion blows her off of her seat and enrages Principal Skinner. In order to punish him, Principal Skinner proposes deportation to Homer and Marge, by having Bart participate in a foreign exchange program. They decide to send Bart to France, while the Simpsons host a student from the Socialist People's Republic of Albania, named Adil Hoxha. Bart is shown {{a picture of a}} lovely château in the heart of France and he immediately agrees to go, much to Homer and Skinner's delight.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, {{he began}} his comedy career by {{following}} up on a suggestion by David Lawrence (a disc jockey friend who had been paying Drew to write jokes for David's radio show in Cleveland) {{to go to the}} library and borrow books on how to write jokes. The following year, after winning an open-microphone contest, he became Master of Ceremonies at the Cleveland Comedy Club. He performed at comedy clubs {{over the next few years}} in Cleveland and Los Angeles. He first came to the national eye as a comedian when he competed in the 1988 Star Search. Carey was working as a stand-up comedian when he appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in November 1991. His performance that night impressed Carson, who invited Carey <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> next to his desk; this was considered a rare honor for any comedian. In that same year, Carey joined the 14th Annual Young Comedians Special on HBO and made his first appearance on Late Night with David Letterman. In 1994, Carey wrote his own stand-up comedy special, Drew Carey: Human Cartoon, which aired on Showtime and won a CableACE Award for Best Writing.|$|E

25|$|Despite tensions, the band, {{and in fact}} Tech's {{music program}} as a whole, {{underwent}} significant growth and changes during Bridges' tenure as band director {{and head of the}} music department. In the summer of 1975, the music department moved from the Crenshaw building <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Couch</b> Building, formerly Couch Elementary School. In 1976, an institute restructuring moved the Music Department from the general college to the College of Sciences and Liberal Studies. This eventually allowed band members and members of other music programs to count their participation toward their degrees' humanities requirement rather than just a free elective.|$|E
25|$|When Breakfast {{launched}} on 23 February 2012, it was hosted by Henry, Robinson and Rochford and aired from 6am until 9am. Robinson would present news and sport updates on the half-hour with Roze presenting weather forecasts. The set {{consisted of a}} large red couch where Henry, Robinson and Rochford would generally present from. An Australiana backdrop existed behind the couch and was coupled with various props including an outback windmill, a moped and a wooden crate as a coffee table. A large screen, made up of 16 flat panel displays, was located adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> and was used by Roze to present weather updates.|$|E
500|$|Many reviews complimented the episode's songs. Huffington Post {{reviewer}} Mike Moody {{noted that}} both the dry humor in the episode and its songs were humorous, writing, [...] "I usually find myself heading to the kitchen when the songs come on -- but I usually glance back at the TV to see if Jemaine is making a funny face – and I rush back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> once the last note drops. But I can't wait to download tonight's Police-inspired [...] jam." [...] The Guardian named [...] "Sugalumps" [...] {{one of the top}} five best season two Flight of the Conchords songs.|$|E

50|$|After {{walking for}} a few kilometers, the duo rest on <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> when an Ilonggo woman in a taxicab meets them. She offers them a truck for them to borrow for free <b>to</b> deliver <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>the</b> next day, but Manuel politely declines the offer because they would have <b>to</b> leave <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> at that spot overnight, much to Dado's dismay. Manuel offers to buy Dado a snack to calm him down, but when he returns, he sees Dado give <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> away <b>to</b> a junk collector; eventually, the duo chase after and hitch {{a ride on the}} junk collector's three-wheeler pickup. They fall asleep during the trip and wake up to {{discover}} that they are at a recycling plant. The duo get into an argument and Dado threatens to leave Manuel at the plant, but he changes his mind when he steals a shopping cart from a group of kids and they strap <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> on it. Later, Manuel and Dado argue over using <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> as a side business at the dormitory when a news reporter stops to interview them after they indirectly prevented a young man from jumping off an apartment building during their journey. After they run away from the reporter, she broadcasts a report on them, asking if they are thieves or heroes.|$|R
500|$|That night, Theo {{moves into}} Eleanor's room and they fall {{asleep in the}} same bed. [...] Eleanor is awakened by {{the sounds of a}} man {{speaking}} indistinctly and a woman laughing. [...] Fearful, Eleanor asks Theo to hold her hand and she feels it being crushed. As Eleanor hears the sound of a young girl crying, she shouts at whoever is causing the child pain. Theo awakens with a start and turns on the light. Eleanor then sees that she has moved from the bed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> and realizes that Theo was not the one she felt holding her hand.|$|E
500|$|A shot where Lester and Ricky share a {{cannabis}} joint {{behind a}} building {{came from a}} misunderstanding between Hall and Mendes. Mendes asked Hall to prepare the shot in his absence; Hall assumed the characters would look for privacy, so he placed them in a narrow passage between a truck and the building, intending to light {{from the top of}} the truck. When Mendes returned, he explained that the characters did not care if they were seen. He removed the truck and Hall had to rethink the lighting; he lit it from the left, with a large light crossing the actors, and with a soft light behind the camera. Hall felt the consequent wide shot [...] "worked perfectly for the tone of the scene". Hall made sure to keep rain, or the suggestion of it, in every shot near the end of the film. In one shot during Lester's encounter with Angela at the Burnhams' home, Hall created rain effects on the foreground cross lights; in another, he partly lit the pair through French windows to which he had added material to make the rain run slower, intensifying the light (although the strength of the outside light was unrealistic for a night scene, Hall felt it justified because of the strong contrasts it produced). For the close-ups when Lester and Angela move <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> Hall tried to keep rain in the frame, lighting through the window onto the ceiling behind Lester. He also used rain boxes to produce rain patterns where he wanted without lighting the entire room.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} opens with Williams waking up {{on a couch}} next to an unnamed {{sleeping}} male and writes a note that says [...] "I'm sorry". From there she walks to a room and hugs her father, who's mentioned in song. A conversation ensues with Williams taking a photo of someone presumed to be her mother. The video continues with Williams in her room staring at the photo on a mirror, singing about how love, [...] "does not exist." [...] She moves through a costume closet and into a restaurant set, where a rotating cast of men pose as her date. Then into the next room, there's a wedding — everyone is wearing white (the other band members in attendance), but Williams comes dressed in black; she flees the scene from where the bride enters. During the chorus of the song, the clip cuts to the scenes where Williams is lying down on a giant pile of Valentine-themed cards. Throughout the video, clips of Williams singing {{with the rest of}} Paramore in a dim-lighted background are shown. In the video's final moments, Williams spots the same male she woke up to {{at the beginning of the}} video in the crowd at a rock show. After fantasizing of the two being together through all sets from the start of the video, she makes her way back through the various rooms to the original set in the beginning. When Williams sings [...] "And I'm on my way to believing", she returns <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> where the male is still asleep, and hides the note she wrote in her pocket as she lies back down next to him.|$|E

50|$|A subplot of {{the episode}} {{involves}} Homer and Marge's relationship where, during {{the morning after the}} incident, Marge tries to cheer Lisa up by pointing out the contributions of <b>the</b> women <b>to</b> society. When Homer and Bart interfere with the conversation remarking that the men are more important than the women, Marge retaliates by forcing Homer <b>to</b> sleep on <b>the</b> <b>couch.</b> <b>The</b> next night, Homer tries to apologize for his sexism, but lacks both intellect and sensitivity to this and is once again forced <b>to</b> sleep on <b>the</b> <b>couch.</b> When Homer tries to get comfort from Santa's Little Helper, he unwittingly insults him by claiming that he is dumber than he himself. The offended dog then kicks Homer {{out of the house and}} forces him to sleep in his dog house, where Homer wonders what he did to deserve these punishments.|$|R

40|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the last century, when Freud introduced <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> in <b>the</b> psychoanalytic room, a number of “objects” have been removed or renovated, yet <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> has almost always remained in place, at least officially. This article has two distinct aims. <b>The</b> first is <b>to</b> offer a reconstruction of the psychoanalytic history of this element of the setting. <b>The</b> second is <b>to</b> rethink <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> saving it from being reduced to a mere icon. Recent contributions coming from affective neurosciences, infant research, and psychotherapy research seem <b>to</b> question <b>the</b> utility of this element {{and the nature of the}} very mechanisms of its therapeutic action. The authors wonder whether the use of <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> is primarily protective for the therapist rather than necessarily helpful for all patients. Taking into account these observations implies bringing <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> out from a silent dimension and reflecting on its role in the conception of therapeutic action and mental functioning...|$|R
50|$|As the duo {{talk about}} their heartbreaking {{experiences}} over lunch, they notice a Taiwanese couple arguing over a red couch that is delivered on their doorstep. When the couple and delivery workers abandon <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> Manuel {{sees it as a}} sign from God and decides that he and Dado bring it back to their dormitory. After a friend overcharges them for offering to deliver it on his truck and the local bus refuses to accommodate it, Dado and Manuel have no choice but <b>to</b> carry <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> on foot. In the middle of their journey, they cross a street when a drunk motorcyclist collides with <b>the</b> <b>couch.</b> <b>The</b> motorcyclist argues heavily with the duo until all three men are sent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> police station when the motorcyclist accidentally hits a policewoman with his helmet. At the precinct, Manuel begins to fear of being deported when an officer wonders if the duo stole <b>the</b> <b>couch,</b> but <b>the</b> policewoman lets the duo go after filing her report.|$|R
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{distinctive}} aspects of the opening is that three of its elements change from episode to episode: Bart writes different things on the school chalkboard, Lisa plays different solos on her saxophone and different gags accompany the family as they enter their living room <b>to</b> sit on <b>the</b> <b>couch.</b>|$|R

40|$|For {{specific}} {{radiation therapy}} (RT) treatments, it is advantageous <b>to</b> use <b>the</b> isocenter-to-couch distance (ICD) for initial patient setup. (1) Since sagging of <b>the</b> treatment <b>couch</b> is not properly {{taken into account}} by the electronic readout of the treatment machine, this readout cannot be used for initial patient positioning using the isocenter-to-couch distance (ICD). Therefore, initial patient positioning <b>to</b> <b>the</b> prescribed ICD {{has been carried out}} using a ruler prior to each treatment fraction in our institution. However, the ruler method is laborious and logging of data is not possible. The objective of this study is <b>to</b> replace <b>the</b> ruler-based setup of <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> height with an independent, user-friendly, optical camera-based method whereby the radiation technologists have <b>to</b> move only <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> correct <b>couch</b> height, which is visible on a display. A camera-based independent couch height measurement system (ICHS) was developed in cooperation with Panasonic Electric Works Western Europe. Clinical data showed that the ICHS is at least as accurate as the application of a ruler <b>to</b> verify <b>the</b> ICD. <b>The</b> camera-based inde-pendent <b>couch</b> height measurement system has been successfully implemented in seven treatment rooms, since 10 September 2012. The benefits of this system are a more streamlined workflow, reduction of human errors during initial patient setup, and logging of <b>the</b> actual <b>couch</b> height at <b>the</b> isocenter. Daily QA shows that the systems are stable and operate within the set 1 mm tolerance. Regular QA of the system is necessary <b>to</b> guarantee that <b>the</b> system works correctly...|$|R

40|$|What is {{the length}} of the longest ladder that can be carried {{horizontally}} around the right-angled corner, created by hallways of widths a and b? To put it more mathematically, how long a line segment can be manoeuvred around the L-shaped corner? This is The Ladder Problem. <b>The</b> Moving <b>Couch</b> Problem: Given hallways of widths and meeting at a right angle, where, what is <b>the</b> longest rectangular <b>couch</b> of width, where, that can be manoeuvred around the corner? Similarly, <b>the</b> <b>couch</b> has <b>to</b> be horizontal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground. These are the problems we were dealing with. Both were solved in four different ways. The Ladder Problem always results in the same way. On the other hand, <b>the</b> solutions <b>to</b> <b>The</b> Moving <b>Couch</b> Problem are not the same. The first three solutions give us the sixth-degree polynomial and the equation for {{the length of}} <b>the</b> <b>couch.</b> <b>The</b> fourth solution provides a theorem by which we can calculate the widths of the hallways. The Ladder Problem is a mathematical problem because an infinitely thin ladder does not exist. <b>The</b> Moving <b>Couch</b> Problem is a more useful one. The solutions of <b>The</b> Moving <b>Couch</b> Problem can be used to help moving furniture in case you have a house or an apartment with rectangular corners where the hallways meet. ...|$|R
