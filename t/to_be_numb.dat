5|$|During the First World War, Manstein {{served on}} both the German Western and Eastern Fronts. At the {{beginning}} of the war he was promoted to lieutenant and participated in the invasion of Belgium with the 2nd Guard Reserve Infantry Regiment. In August 1914 he took part in the capture of Namur, the site of a massive citadel surrounded by outlying forts. In September, Manstein's unit was one of two transferred to East Prussia and attached to the Eighth Army, commanded by Hindenburg. After seeing action in the First Battle of the Masurian Lakes, his unit was soon reassigned to the Ninth Army, which was in the process of advancing from Upper Silesia to Warsaw. Overstretched, the Ninth Army was forced to withdraw in the face of a Russian counterattack, and on 16 November Manstein was wounded during the retreat when he was among a detachment that stormed a Russian entrenchment. He was shot in the left shoulder and the left knee; one bullet hit his sciatic nerve, causing the leg <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>numb.</b> Recovery took six months in hospital in Beuthen and Wiesbaden.|$|E

60|$|By {{this time}} the sun was well up, and {{the warmth of the}} hour, season, and latitude, was shed on the sufferers. There was an old sail in the boat, and in this the party dried their limbs and feet, which were getting <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>numb</b> by their long immersion. Then the mate {{produced}} the bag and opened it, in quest of bread. A small portion was given to each, and, on looking farther, the mate discovered that a piece of boiled ship's beef had been secreted in this receptacle. Of this also he gave each a moderate slice, taking a larger portion for himself, as requiring less precaution. The suffering of the party from hunger was far less than that they endured from thirst. Neither had been endured long enough seriously to enfeeble them or render a full meal very dangerous, but the thirst had been much the hardest to be borne. Of this fact Biddy soon gave audible evidence.|$|E

60|$|Gradually {{there came}} a sort of vague {{beginning}} of consciousness; then a sense of weariness that was dreadful. For a time I remembered nothing; but slowly my senses returned. My feet seemed positively racked with pain, yet I could not move them. They seemed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>numbed.</b> There <b>was</b> an icy feeling {{at the back of}} my neck and all down my spine, and my ears, like my feet, were dead, yet in torment; but there was in my breast a sense of warmth which was, by comparison, delicious. It was as a nightmare--a physical nightmare, if one may use such an expression; for some heavy weight on my chest made it difficult for me to breathe.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He set alight the two fires {{with the}} {{prepared}} materials, and began, at {{first in a}} low voice, but rising by degrees, the invocations of the Ritual. The flames invested every object with a wavering light. Presently they went out. He set more twigs and perfumes on the brazier, and when the flame started up once more, he saw distinctly before the altar a human figure larger than life, which dissolved and disappeared. He began the invocations again and placed himself in a circle, which he had already traced between the altar and the tripod. Then {{the depth of the}} mirror which was in front of him grew brighter by degrees, and a pale form arose, and it seemed gradually to approach. He closed his eyes, and called three times upon Apollonius. When he opened them, a man stood before him, wholly enveloped in a winding sheet, which seemed more grey than black. His form was lean, melancholy, and beardless. Eliphas felt an intense cold, and when he sought to ask his questions found it impossible to speak. Thereupon, he placed his hand on the Pentagram, and directed the point of his sword toward the figure, adjuring it mentally by that sign not to terrify, but to obey him. The form suddenly grew indistinct and soon it strangely vanished. He commanded it to return, and then felt, as it were, an air pass by him; and, something having touched the hand which held the sword, his arm was immediately benumbed as far as the shoulder. He supposed that the weapon displeased the spirit, and set it down within the circle. The human figure at once reappeared, but Eliphas experienced such a sudden exhaustion in all his limbs that he was obliged to sit down. He fell into a deep coma, and dreamed strange dreams. But of these, when he recovered, only a vague memory remained to him. His arm continued for several days <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>numb</b> and painful. The figure had not spoken, but it seemed to Eliphas Levi that the questions were answered in his own mind. For to each an inner voice replied with one grim word: dead.' ...|$|E

50|$|Prior to {{beginning}} these procedures, the patient <b>is</b> generally <b>numbed</b> {{in the area}} intended for instrumentation. Because of the deeper nature of periodontal scaling and root planing, either one half or {{one quarter of the}} mouth is generally cleaned during one appointment. This allows the patient <b>to</b> <b>be</b> entirely <b>numbed</b> in the necessary area during treatment. It is usually not recommended to have the entire mouth scaled at one appointment because of the potential inconveniences and complications of numbing the entire mouth- i.e., inability to eat or drink, likelihood of self injury by biting, etc.|$|R

50|$|Widowmaker's fictional {{biography}} details {{her real}} name: Amélie Lacroix, age: 33, and base of operations: Annecy, France. In Overwatch lore, her former life included {{her marriage to}} Gérard Lacroix, an Overwatch agent leading operations against Talon, a terrorist organization, and her former occupation as a Ballet Dancer. Talon opted to kidnap Amélie after several failed attempts to kill Gérard. After kidnapping Amélie, Talon subjected her to an intensive neural reconditioning program, breaking her will and reprogramming her as a sleeper agent for Talon. Sometime after this, she was found by Overwatch agents, seemingly unaffected by Talon's methods. Two weeks after returning to her normal life, she killed Gérard in his sleep, and returned to Talon, where she was fully converted into one of their agents. The extensive training she underwent caused her physiology to change, dramatically slowing her heart, lowering the temperature of her skin, and turning her skin a blue color. Now, her character is noted <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>numb</b> to human emotion.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the first}} episode of season 5, {{we find out that}} Chuck has spent his summer {{traveling}} the world with Nate. The two arrive in Los Angeles to meet up with Serena, who is working as an assistant on a film set. Seemingly over his break up with Blair, Chuck exhibits a positive outlook on life, telling Serena and Nate that he's seeking to experience everything he can in life. However, his heartbreak soon becomes apparent when he receives an invitation to Blair's upcoming wedding, which causes him to drive recklessly and get into a motorbike accident. In the following episode, it is revealed that Chuck has an emotional disorder {{as a result of his}} losing Blair, and which now causes him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>numb</b> to physical and emotional stimuli. Dan decides to help Chuck break through this emotional barrier, and gets him a dog, hoping to spark some emotion. However, it is only when Blair reveals to him that she is pregnant with Louis's baby does Chuck begin feel again - he is shown crying over the revelation at the end of the episode. He names the dog [...] "Monkey" [...] (a homage to the pet monkey Chuck's character had in the books). He forms a reluctant friendship with Dan from here on.|$|E
5000|$|During {{repression}} of gliogenesis, {{expression of the}} Notch-binding protein, <b>Numb,</b> <b>is</b> elevated. <b>Numb</b> <b>is</b> suggested <b>to</b> function in two manners: 1) When expressed, Numb will interact with specific endocytic proteins and create {{a link between the}} notch receptor and the endocytic vesicles. The vesicle-receptor complex generated will <b>be</b> targeted back <b>to</b> the cell membrane and the membrane receptor will <b>be</b> recycled <b>to</b> the cell surface never reaching the nucleus. Alternatively, 2) <b>Numb</b> <b>is</b> suggested <b>to</b> recruit additional molecules other than endocytic proteins. In particular, ubiquitin ligases <b>are</b> shown <b>to</b> <b>be</b> recruited by <b>Numb</b> in mammals. The ubiquitin ligases ubiquitinates Notch and targets it for degradation [...] Whatever the mechanism of Numb, the Notch receptor does not reach the nucleus and the transcription factors required for gliogenesis are not generated.|$|R
5000|$|The word torpedo {{comes from}} {{the name of a}} genus of {{electric}} rays in the order Torpediniformes, which in turn {{comes from the}} Latin [...] "torpere" [...] (<b>to</b> <b>be</b> stiff or <b>numb).</b> In naval usage, the American Robert Fulton introduced the name to refer to a towed gunpowder charge used by his French submarine Nautilus (first tested in 1800) to demonstrate that it could sink warships.|$|R
50|$|The protein <b>Numb</b> <b>is</b> coded {{for by the}} gene, NUMB, whose {{mechanism}} appears <b>to</b> <b>be</b> evolutionarily conserved. <b>Numb</b> has <b>been</b> extensively {{studied in}} both invertebrates and mammals, though its function is best understood in Drosophila. Numb {{plays a crucial role}} in asymmetrical cell division during development, allowing for differential cell fate specification in the central and peripheral nervous systems. During neurogenesis, Numb localizes {{to one side of the}} mother cell such that it <b>is</b> distributed selectively <b>to</b> one daughter cell. This asymmetric division allows a daughter cell containing Numb to acquire a different fate than the other daughter cell.|$|R
5000|$|All {{of their}} {{training}} is done {{in an effort to}} balance their magic. Falcons who <b>are</b> too weak <b>to</b> control their magic or whose magic <b>is</b> too strong <b>to</b> control fall to the goddess Ecl. Ecl is described by Servos as a void of nothingness, everything that never was and never can be. Her world (called Ecl'gah, which means illusion) often appears as a plain of black ice under a silver moon. It <b>is</b> somewhat akin <b>to</b> the dreamworld, being manipulated by the [...] "dreamers" [...] within it. It can show those who 'ride' the Ecl the past, the present, and possible futures, and those who enter it willingly and with no demands for the Ecl cannot be taken by it. This allows them to use their magic without fear, and bear the title [...] "Mana'Ecl." [...] Those who enter looking for its ability to numb them owe the Ecl, and she takes it by leaving them in a dreamlike coma. They are then known as shm'Ecl. They are between life and death, usually still, but occasionally lashing out with magic at the nightmares they see. The pain of coming closer to reality usually drives them deeper into Ecl, ever more unlikely to return. Shm'Ecl can sometimes sense those of royal blood despite their state, and since some have purposely fled into Ecl <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>numbed</b> <b>to</b> the pain of the world, they are not always pleased <b>to</b> <b>be</b> awakened. The only way to pull oneself out of Ecl <b>is</b> <b>to</b> have worldly bonds and vows to call you back. This includes things like vows to spouses, partners, or monarchs. Falcons with great skill in mindwalking could technically help the shm'Ecl, but the few with that kind of power are needed for more important tasks.|$|R
5000|$|... "Sober" [...] {{is a power}} pop song, {{featuring}} heavy {{guitars and}} booming snare. It is written in the key of E minor (recorded in D minor) and set at a moderately slow tempo of 91 beats per minute, following a chord progression of D5-B5-F. In the song, Pink's vocals span from the low-note of E3 to the high-note of D5. Lyrically, the song speaks about the quiet sense of comfort in being sober. Lucy Davies of BBC Music went further, writing that the song [...] "discusses the blackouts resulting from drinking to avoid becoming those she sneers at." [...] Chris William, writing for Entertainment Weekly, commented that the song finds Pink [...] "questioning her need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>numbed</b> by booze and noise." [...] Mark Blankenship of New Now Next analyzed the song, writing that it is [...] "about a woman who only loves herself when she’s drunk, who wishes she could like herself this much when she’s sober, but who can’t seem to pull herself out of her spiral. She later discussed the song's lyrics in an interview, stating: I wrote a song called [...] "Sober", which is actually really dark. I was at a party at my own house, I didn't want <b>to</b> <b>be</b> there, I didn't want anyone else there. And I had this line in my head saying, 'How do I feel this good sober?', it's not just about alcohol, it's about vices, we all have different ones. We try {{to get away from}} ourselves, and find our 'true selves' and then we do these things that take us so far from the truth, I guess that 'Sober' is 'How do I feel this good when it's just me, without anything to lean on?'.|$|R
