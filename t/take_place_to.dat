5|$|Six Flags ordered {{two more}} {{versions}} of the attraction for the 2003 season for Six Flags Great Adventure in Jackson Township, New Jersey, and Six Flags Great America in Gurnee, Illinois. Six Flags Great Adventure's version of the ride officially {{opened to the public}} on April 17, 2003. In preparation for the ride's installation at Six Flags Great America, the park removed Shockwave, an Arrow Dynamics roller coaster that was located on part of the park's parking lot. Grading works also had to <b>take</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> convert the parking lot into something more suitable for Superman: Ultimate Flight. The ride at Six Flags Great America opened on May 3, 2003.|$|E
5|$|The {{pipeline}} is surveyed {{several times}} per day, mostly by air. Foot and road patrols also <b>take</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> check for {{problems such as}} leaks or pipe settling or shifting. The pipeline can be surveyed {{in as little as}} two hours, but most surveys take longer to ensure thoroughness. These external inspections are only part of standard maintenance, however. The majority of pipeline maintenance is done by pipeline pigs—mechanical devices sent through the pipeline to perform a variety of functions.|$|E
5|$|Regular {{elections}} <b>take</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> the City of Ely Council, East Cambridgeshire District Council and Cambridgeshire County Council. The {{civil parish}} {{is divided into}} four wards called Ely North, Ely South, Ely East and Ely West. Fourteen councillors are elected to the parish council. The East Cambridgeshire District Council is also based in Ely. For elections to the East Cambridgeshire District Council the four wards of Ely South, Ely East and Ely West each return two district councillors; and Ely North returns three. In 2011, the seats were held by four Liberal Democrat and five Conservative councillors. For elections to the Cambridgeshire County Council the city returns two councillors, {{both of whom were}} Conservatives in 2013. For elections to the UK Parliament, Ely is part of the South East Cambridgeshire constituency. James Paice held the seat from 1987 until he stepped down in 2015. For elections to the European Parliament, Ely is part of the East of England constituency.|$|E

5|$|Significant {{logistical}} operations <b>take</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> {{bring people}} into the festival by public transport each year. Additional festival trains are provided to Castle Cary railway station, mostly from London Paddington. The station operates as a mini hub with waiting shuttle buses transferring passengers from Castle Cary to the festival site as required. This is an intensive operation on the Wednesday and Thursday each year with local bus and coach operators providing these buses over the two days. Additional extra buses normally provided by Go South Coast run from Bristol to the festival. On the Monday, passengers are transferred back in just one day with additional buses provided to meet the increased requirement. National Express provide extra coaches direct to the festival site from major UK towns and much of this work is subcontracted to smaller coach operators to provide the capacity required.|$|E

On the August14 {{episode of}} TNA Impact!, Management Director Jim Cornette {{announced}} that Joe would defend the championship at TNA's next PPV event No Surrender on September14 in a Four Ways to Glory match. Cornette stated {{that over the}} weeks leading to the show three qualification matches would <b>take</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> determine the challengers to Joe. Booker T won the first qualifying match was on the August21 episode of Impact! by defeating Rhino. Kurt Angle defeated Kevin Nash on the August28 episode of Impact! {{to qualify for the}} contest.

Rather than the teams in the All-Star Game being made up of players from certain teams, the game would be contested by Team Australia and a team of World All-Stars, selected from the import or international players participating in the ABL at the time.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} calls by some, such as former German {{interior}} minister and current {{minister of finance}} Wolfgang Schäuble, for direct elections to <b>take</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> give the President a mandate, this would strengthen the post within the European Council allowing for stronger leadership in addition to addressing the question of democratic legitimacy in the EU. However, this might cause conflict with Parliament's democratic mandate or a potential mandate for the Commission (see section below). To give a mandate to the European Council's president would signify a development of the Union's governance towards a presidential system, rather than a parliamentary system.|$|E
25|$|As a wider {{part of the}} Manukau Harbour Crossing Project, the {{motorway}} {{was also}} to be widened between Walmsley Road {{in the south and}} Queenstown Road in the north from four lanes to six lanes. This widening was to predominantly <b>take</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> the east of the existing motorway. The Onehunga interchange (known as the Gloucester Park Interchange) was to be significantly reworked, to provide a more logical link with the motorway, and to ease congestion along Onehunga Harbour Drive. A standard diamond interchange was initially chosen by Transit, but after consultation with Auckland City Council this was then reworked into a quarter-diamond design, with the northbound onramp hooking underneath a proposed Neilson Road bridge.|$|E
25|$|Exposure to {{weightlessness}} causes {{changes to}} the signals from the receptors to touch, pressure, and gravity, i.e., all information necessary for postural stability. Adaptive modifications in the central processing of sensory information <b>take</b> <b>place</b> <b>to</b> produce motor responses that are appropriate for the new gravitational environment. As a result, terrestrial motor strategies are progressively abandoned in weightlessness, as astronauts adapt to the weightless environment. This is particularly true for the major postural muscles found in the lower legs. The modifications in posture, movement, and locomotion acquired in reduced gravity are then inappropriate for Earth's gravity upon return. After landing, postural instability approaching clinical ataxia is manifested {{as a result of}} this in-flight neural reorganization.|$|E
