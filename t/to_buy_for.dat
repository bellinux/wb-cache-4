While he {{received an}} expense allowance of over $75,000, more than most senators received (because California {{was one of the}} most populous states), that money went to pay his staff of 12 and to cover the cost of stationery, telephone service, telegrams, and other office expenses. It also paid for the one set of round-trip airline tickets between Washington, D.C., and California that Nixon was allowed <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>for</b> himself and his family at taxpayer expense each Congressional session.|$|E
5|$|In 1911, as the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad {{continued}} {{the project of}} eliminating at-grade crossings between streets and railroads, the Montclair Branch was the next to receive the structural change. Bloomfield criticized the Lackawanna railroad for making a disgrace of the community. The railroad proposed using $700,000 (1911 USD) of funds to construct a brand new station at Watsessing Avenue along with a new downtown Bloomfield Station. The cost of elevating and depressing the railroad came up to about $20,000 (1911 USD) for the Lackawanna. This contract by the railroad and township was approved after negotiations dating back to 1908. The negotiations included a park to be built between both stations {{on both sides of}} the railroad. The park land cost the township $50,000 <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>for</b> the construction, and it was to be turned over to the Essex County Park Commission.|$|E

Later that month, PSG signed Kylian Mbappé from AS Monaco on loan with an option <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>for</b> €180m that could make him the second-most expensive player in the world. As a result, UEFA opened a new FFP investigation into PSG.|$|E
25|$|As {{the early}} stages of the 2009–10 season progressed, the {{finances}} dried up and the club admitted on 1 October that some of their players and staff had not been paid. On 3 October, media outlets started to report that a deal was nearing completion for Ali al-Faraj to take control of the club. On 5 October, a deal was agreed for al-Faraj and his associates, via BVI-registered company Falcondrone, to hold a 90% majority holding, with Al-Fahim retaining 10% stake and the title of non-executive chairman for two years. Falcondrone also agreed a deal with Alexandre Gaydamak the right <b>to</b> <b>buy,</b> <b>for</b> £1, Miland Development (2004) Ltd., which owns various strategic pockets of land around the ground, once refinancing was complete. Two days after the al-Faraj takeover was completed, Portsmouth's former technical director Avram Grant returned as director of football. Because of the financial problems, however, the Premier League placed the club under a transfer embargo, meaning the club were not allowed to sign any players.|$|E
25|$|Parma's {{first move}} {{of the summer}} was to {{activate}} their option on newly capped Italian international Sebastian Giovinco, {{who had been on}} loan the previous season and on whom Parma had an option <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>for</b> 50% for €3 million, despite parent club Juventus' interest in the player. Soon after, Parma resolved a number of co-ownership deals and secured former Parma player Jonathan Biabiany and Gonçalo Brandão on one-year loans. Paolo Castellini, also out on loan the previous year, was again farmed out, this time to relegated side Sampdoria. Meanwhile, right-sided Brazilian Ângelo left the club after the expiry of his contract for Serie A rivals Siena. Despite speculation about his future, Parma legend Hernán Crespo signed a new deal that tied him to the club for another year the day before, later adding that his two objectives for 2011–12 were to help the club avoid relegation and to score a 100th goal for Parma; before the season's start he had bagged 91.|$|E

25|$|The Wallis Annenberg Photography Department was {{launched}} in 1984 with {{a grant from the}} Ralph M. Parsons Foundation. It has holdings of more than fifteen thousand works that span the period from the medium's invention in 1839 to the present. Photography also is integrated into other departments. Although LACMA's photo collection encompasses the entire field, it has many gaps and is far smaller than that of the J. Paul Getty Museum. In 1992 Audrey and Sydney Irmas donated their entire photography collection, creating what is now the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's Audrey and Sydney Irmas Collection of Artists' Self-Portraits, a large and highly specialized selection spanning 150 years. The couple donated the collection two years before a major exhibition of the collection was mounted at LACMA; the display included photos of and by artistic photographers ranging from chemist Alphonse Poitevin in 1853 to Robert Mapplethorpe in 1988. Among other self-portraits in the collection were those of Andy Warhol, Lee Friedlander, and Edward Steichen. Audrey Irmas continues <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>for</b> the collection, but now all the additions are gifts to LACMA. In 2008 LACMA announced that the Annenberg Foundation was making a $23 million gift for the acquisition of the Marjorie and Leonard Vernon collection of 19th- and 20th-century photographs. Among the 3,500 master prints are works by Steichen, Edward Weston, Ansel Adams, Eugène Atget, Imogen Cunningham, and Man Ray. The gift also provided an endowment and capital to help build storage facilities for the museum’s photographic holdings, leading to the its photography department being renamed the Wallis Annenberg Department of Photography. In 2011 LACMA and the J. Paul Getty Trust jointly acquired Robert Mapplethorpe’s art and archival material, including more than 2,000 works by the artist.|$|E
500|$|The new director’s taste {{was for the}} Northern and Early Italian Renaissance masters or [...] "primitives", who {{had been}} {{neglected}} by the Gallery’s acquisitions policy but were slowly gaining recognition from connoisseurs. Eastlake made annual tours to the continent and to Italy in particular, seeking out appropriate paintings <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>for</b> the Gallery. In all, he bought 148 pictures abroad and 46 in Britain, among the former such seminal works as Paolo Uccello’s Battle of San Romano. Eastlake also amassed a private art collection during this period, consisting of paintings that he knew did not interest the trustees. His ultimate aim, however, was for them to enter the National Gallery; this was duly arranged upon his death by his friend and successor as director, William Boxall, and his widow Lady Eastlake.|$|E

Gardening allows players to raise plants in their residence, or [...] "Mog House" [...] {{as it is known}} in the game. The raising and breeding of Chocobos was a long-requested activity enabled in the summer 2006 update.

It deals with the events seventy years earlier when Sayo was friends with Sota, a poor village boy who lived with his grandfather and dreamt of being a painter. The film moves back to that time, when a circus came to the town where Sayo and Sota lived. Despite Sota's grandfather warning him not to go near the circus, Sota goes with Sayo. After the performance, they sneak backstage and are caught by the circus clown Haigo, who kindly gives Sota an egg, which he had intended <b>to</b> <b>buy</b> <b>for</b> his grandfather.

500|$|Woodward {{was one of}} {{the oldest}} public schools in the country, founded as the Woodward Free Grammar School in 1831; it was named for William Woodward, a local tanner who donated the land to provide, in his words, [...] "facilities to educate the {{children}} of persons who could not afford the expense of private schooling". The building was replaced once in 1855, and again in 1907 when President William Howard Taft, who graduated from Woodward in 1874, laid the cornerstone of the current building; it opened in 1910. The site is linked to the Underground Railroad, an informal network of secret routes and safe houses used by 19th-century black slaves in the United States; Levi Coffin (known as [...] "The President of the Underground Railroad") had a home there from 1856 to 1863. The five-story brick, stone, and terra cotta building is approximately [...] Designed by Gustav Brach, it was considered [...] "an architectural gem" [...] in its time, {{with some of the most}} modern facilities of its day, including flush toilets, central heating, and two swimming pools.

Midrash Pliah says that Isaac told Esau, [...] "Your brother came with trickery" [...] (Genesis 27:35), adding, [...] "and he took out the afikoman."
