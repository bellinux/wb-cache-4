5|$|In Harry Patch's book The Last Fighting Tommy, {{the author}} claims that Allingham planned {{to leave his}} body to medical science. In his own book, Kitchener's Last Volunteer, Allingham {{confirmed}} that he was intending to leave his body to medical science. However he was persuaded by Denis Goodwin to change his mind, as he {{became a symbol of}} World War I <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>people</b> of the sacrifices made during the conflict. To that end he agreed to a funeral and cremation.|$|E
5|$|The postwar climate sees {{a period}} of {{austerity}} and mistrust towards the machines. Returning from {{the horrors of the}} war, Marke becomes the Consul of Berlin and instates a reign of isolation and deurbanization. Advanced weapons are destroyed, people are driven out into the countryside to cultivate the land, and the giant energy accumulators are destroyed. Columns made to look like bulls are erected in city squares and at crossroads, and roar twice a day like a dying animal <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>people</b> of the catastrophe of the Ural War. Marduk succeeds Marke as the Consul and continues the period of brutal authoritarian rule.|$|E

5|$|Treatment of TB uses {{antibiotics}} to {{kill the}} bacteria. Effective TB treatment is difficult, due to the unusual structure and chemical composition of the mycobacterial cell wall, which hinders the entry of drugs and makes many antibiotics ineffective. The two antibiotics most commonly used are isoniazid and rifampicin, and treatments can be prolonged, taking several months. Latent TB treatment usually employs a single antibiotic, while active TB disease is best treated with combinations of several antibiotics {{to reduce the risk}} of the bacteria developing antibiotic resistance. People with latent infections are also treated to prevent them from progressing to active TB disease later in life. Directly observed therapy, i.e., having a health care provider watch the person take their medications, is recommended by the WHO in an effort to reduce the number of people not appropriately taking antibiotics. The evidence to support this practice over people simply taking their medications independently is of poor quality. There is no strong evidence indicating that directly observed therapy improves the number of people who were cured or the number of people who complete their medicine. Moderate quality evidence suggests that there is also no difference if people are observed at home versus at a clinic, or by a family member versus a health care worker. Methods <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>people</b> of the importance of treatment and appointments may result in a small but important improvement.|$|E
5|$|With all of Memorize's secret {{operations}} taken down, Edge presses Nilin to {{find the}} Conception Cube, Memorize's central base, and destroy H3O, the Memorize Central Server. Once there, she encounters her father, Charles Cartier-Wells, {{the creator of the}} Sensens. Upon finding him, she sees that, fuelled by the car accident that injured his wife, he has become lost in a dream of an ideal world free from painful memories, all inspired by the desire to help Nilin forget about the accident. Nilin makes him see the harm his technology causes, and Scylla arrives to convince Charles to help Nilin enter the Central Server. Once {{in the presence of the}} Central Server, it is revealed to Nilin that Edge is a self-aware entity created by the amalgamation of unwanted memories within H3O. Nilin, who unwittingly started Edge with the memories of her unhappy childhood, enters the Server and, at H3O/Edge's will, she destroys him and releases the memories back into the general population. As the memories are released, Nilin remembers Edge's words about the mind being a fortress, and says that Edge died <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>people</b> that memories should not become open to all, and that painful memories should be lived with rather than forcibly removed. She comes to the conclusion that outside her now-restored mind she has a family again and a damaged world to heal.|$|E

50|$|The lake derives {{its name}} from the Wendigo or Windigo of Ojibwe mythology. A cryptoid was a malevolent, cannibalistic spirit that could possess people and inspire cannibalism, {{particularly}} during times of famine.

50|$|For Christmas, 2013, Coke Zero {{launched}} an interactive website that allowed people to customize {{the designs of}} their Christmas sweater.

25|$|Since the pre-Columbian era Mexican {{culture has}} {{maintained}} a certain reverence towards death, which {{can be seen in}} the widespread commemoration of the Day of the Dead. Elements of that celebration include the use of skeletons <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>people</b> of their mortality. The worship of Santa Muerte is condemned by the Catholic Church in Mexico as invalid, but it is firmly entrenched among an increasing percentage of Mexican culture.|$|E
25|$|Only {{four years}} later, when Olomouc was besieged by a Prussian {{army and the}} Holy Trinity Column was hit by shots from Prussian cannons several times, Olomouc {{citizens}} went in a procession to beg the Prussian general not to shoot at the monument. General James Keith complied with their wishes. The column was repaired soon {{after the war and}} a replica of a stone shot was half-buried in its stem on the place where it was hit <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>people</b> of this event.|$|E
25|$|Batteries {{are used}} either as sole or as backup power for {{residential}} smoke detectors. Mains-operated detectors have disposable or rechargeable batteries; others run only on 9-volt disposable batteries. When the battery is exhausted a battery-only smoke detector becomes inactive; most smoke detectors chirp repeatedly if the battery is low. It {{has been found}} that battery-powered smoke detectors in many houses have dead batteries. It has been estimated that in the UK over 30% of smoke alarms may have dead or removed batteries. In response public information campaigns have been created <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>people</b> to change smoke detector batteries regularly. In Australia, for example, a public information campaign suggests that smoke alarm batteries should be replaced on April Fools' Day every year. In regions using daylight saving time, campaigns may suggest that people change their batteries when they change their clocks or on a birthday.|$|E
50|$|Auril {{is similar}} to Umberlee in many ways. She is worshipped out of fear, she serves Talos, and much of her ethos {{is similar to}} that of the god of nature's destruction. Like Umberlee, she has seen much of her {{personal}} power eroded by Talos himself, and as a result, the winters have grown colder <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> the <b>people</b> who still controls the power of cold.|$|R

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the nineteenth century while Napoleon’s cannons were changing the political map of Europe, and Karadjordje’s rebels were fighting for Serbian independence, a prominent merchant from Novi Sad Sava Vuković of Beregsova, was thinking of leaving something permanent <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> his <b>people</b> of himself. On St. Sava’s Day 1810, blind and seriously ill, Vukovic donated 20 000 forints for foundation of a Serbian grammar school in Novi Sad.|$|R
25|$|The Centre Block, {{departmental}} buildings, {{and a new}} {{residence for}} the governor general were each awarded separately, the team of Thomas Fuller and Chilion Jones, under the pseudonym of Semper Paratus, winning the prize for the first category with their Victorian High Gothic scheme of a formal, symmetrical front facing a quadrangle, and a more rustic, picturesque back facing the escarpment overlooking the Ottawa River. The team of Thomas Stent and Augustus Laver, under the pseudonym of Stat nomen in umbra, won the prize for the second category, which included the East and West Blocks. These proposals were selected for their sophisticated use of Gothic architecture, which was thought <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>people</b> of parliamentary democracy's history, would contradict the republican Neoclassicism of the United States' capital, and would be suited to the rugged surroundings while also being stately. $300,000 was allocated for the main building, and $120,000 {{for each of the}} departmental buildings.|$|E
25|$|State Guards were {{reformed}} {{for internal}} security duties {{to replace the}} National Guardsmen who were federalized and sent overseas. The Civil Air Patrol was established, which enrolled civilian spotters in air reconnaissance, search-and-rescue, and transport. Its Coast Guard counterpart, the Coast Guard Auxiliary, used civilian boats and crews in similar rescue roles. Towers were built in coastal and border towns, and spotters were trained to recognize enemy aircraft. Blackouts were practiced in every city, even those far from the coast. All exterior lighting had to be extinguished, and black-out curtains placed over windows. The main purpose was <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>people</b> {{that there was a}} war on and to provide activities that would engage the civil spirit of millions of people not otherwise involved in the war effort. In large part, this effort was successful, sometimes almost to a fault, such as the Plains states where many dedicated aircraft spotters took up their posts night after night watching the skies in an area of the country that no enemy aircraft of that time could possibly hope to reach.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} year Hawke received the Michael Mendelson Award for Outstanding Commitment to the Theater. In {{his acceptance speech}} Hawke said [...] "I don't know why they're honoring me. I think the real reason they are honoring me is to help {{raise money for the}} theater company. Whenever the economy gets hit hard, one of the first thing [...] to go is people's giving, and last on that list of things people give to is the arts because they feel it's not essential. I guess I'm here <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>people</b> that the arts are essential to our mental health as a country." ...|$|E
500|$|Springsteen himself {{remained}} quite {{interested in}} his and the band's commercial fortunes. [...] He said before the tour's start that remaining popular {{had been one of}} his motivations for the Super Bowl appearance: [...] "I've said no for about 10 years or however long they've been asking, but, I tell you, we played on the last tour and there were some empty seats here and there and, well, there shouldn't be any empty seats at an E Street Band show. I hold pride that we remain one of the great wonders of the world ... so sometimes you got <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> <b>people</b> a little bit." ...|$|E
5000|$|Produced by {{frontman}} Dan Whitford, Free Your Mind {{was recorded}} in Cut Copy's hometown of Melbourne and later mixed by Dave Fridmann in Upstate New York. According to its press release, the album {{was inspired by the}} two different Summers of Love (San Francisco's in 1967 and Britain's in 1988 and 1989). [...] "The concept of freedom is one that's universally positive and timeless, and whatever each person's version of that freedom is, it's a good thing <b>to</b> be <b>reminding</b> <b>people</b> or even just ourselves to be 'free'", Whitford stated.|$|R
30|$|The exiled prophet Ezekiel’s God {{is above}} all a ‘holy’ being (Ezekiel 36 : 23), that is, one who utterly transcends {{all forms of}} human comprehension, manipulation, and calculation. God are {{unconstrained}} by any human claim, He act for His own purposes for love and salvation (Ezekiel 36 : 22). Being a watchman in but not of this emerging Open Science power/knowledge-space would necessitate the prophet’s unfailing repeated efforts <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> his <b>peoples</b> that God cannot be controlled and constrained by any human will and purpose.|$|R

We feel now {{it is the right}} time <b>to</b> <b>remind</b> the <b>people</b> where we come from and that's exactly what 'Above' will do. It is like an enhanced version of our three or four first albums, maybe the missing link between 'Ceremony of Opposites' and 'Passage'. With the 'Era One' project we've tried to work on different influences; with 'Above' we stripped everything down." ...|$|R
