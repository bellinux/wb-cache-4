There {{he worked as a}} screenwriter for Warner Bros. until 1941, and then interrupted his career to serve until 1944 as the chairman of the Hollywood Writers Mobilization, a body to organize writers for <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>in</b> World War II. In 1945 he joined a picket line against Warner Bros. After making one film for Hal Wallis's newly formed production company, Rossen made one for Columbia Pictures, another for Wallis and most of his later films for his own companies, usually in collaboration with Columbia.|$|E

A further court hearing resulted in the election being conducted in-person rather than by mail, which also led to Giron complaining of voter suppression.|$|E
5|$|Edward VI acceded to the English throne in 1547, and the Protestant reformers there {{hoped to}} take the {{opportunity}} to more thoroughly reform the Church of England. Archbishop Thomas Cranmer invited Vermigli and Ochino to assist in <b>the</b> <b>effort.</b> <b>In</b> addition, the victory of Catholic Emperor Charles V in the Schmalkaldic War and the resulting Augsburg Interim led to a hostile environment for Protestants in Germany. Vermigli accepted the invitation in November and sailed with Ochino to England. In 1548, he replaced Richard Smyth, becoming the second Regius Professor of Divinity at Oxford. This was a very influential post at a university which had been slow to accept reform.|$|E

This research study is aimed at investigating <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fulfillment of safety needs conducted by the students’ activity unit of full body contact sports in order to prevent accidents which can end in injury, physical defect, or even death during the training sessions. This is a descriptive research study involving the safety needs as the only variable. The population involved in this research was the students of Yogyakarta State University who were the members of the students’ activity unit in the area of full body contact sports. The researcher took 100 samples out of 465 members using proportionate stratified random sampling. The instrument to collect the data was in the form of questionnaires. The researcher analyzed the data using the descriptive quantitative method with percentage. The results of this study show that <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>in</b> fulfilling <b>the</b> safety needs conducted by the students’ activity unit in the area of full body contact sports in Yogyakarta State University were generally good (66 %). In details, it can be described that: (1) <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>in</b> fulfilling <b>the</b> safety needs from the inside of the students’ activity unit were good (64 %), (2) <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>in</b> fulfilling <b>the</b> safety needs from the inside of the students’ activity unit were good (71 %), (3) <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>in</b> fulfilling <b>the</b> safety needs in terms of the health of the students’ activity unit were poor (40 %), (4) <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>in</b> fulfilling <b>the</b> safety needs in terms of the equipment of the students’ activity unit were good (67 %), (5) <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>in</b> fulfilling <b>the</b> safety needs in terms of the foods were good (70 %), (6) <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>in</b> fulfilling <b>the</b> safety needs in terms of the training processes were good (79 %), (7) <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>in</b> fulfilling <b>the</b> safety needs in terms of tools and facilities were fair (52 %), (8) <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>in</b> fulfilling <b>the</b> safety needs in terms of the regulation were good (75 %), (9) <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>in</b> fulfilling <b>the</b> safety needs in terms of the coaches were very good (86 %), and (10) <b>the</b> <b>efforts</b> <b>in</b> fulfilling <b>the</b> safety needs in terms of the weather were good (71 %) ...|$|R

5|$|Eliot invokes {{images of}} {{original}} sin and Adam's fall when talking about the past and points out that such events can be forgotten but can still affect mankind. Eliot brings {{in the image of}} Krishna to discuss how the past and future are related: Krishna, speaking to Arjuna, claims that death can come at any time and that men should always find the divine will instead of worrying about what their actions will bring. If an individual were to follow Krishna's words then {{they would be able to}} free their self from the limitations of time. Even if it cannot be fully attained, <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>in</b> attempting it is still important. The way for mankind to understand the divine will is through prayer and through the power of the Holy Spirit.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the failure}} of the landing at Porton Plantation, the planned Australian advance into the Bonis Peninsula was called off. The Australian high command decided to refocus their efforts upon the drive towards Buin in the south and as a result <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>in</b> the north was reduced to that of a holding action as further {{resources}} were transferred out of the sector. Following the withdrawal, the 31st/51st Infantry Battalion continued fighting along the Ratsua front before being relieved on 28 June by the 8th Infantry Battalion and withdrawing to Torokina, where they remained {{until the end of the}} war. The 23rd Brigade under Brigadier Arnold Potts took over control of the sector, and for a period of four weeks along the Ratsua front the 8th and 27th Infantry Battalions carried out patrolling operations before the Australians decided to withdraw to the Buoi Plantation in mid-July, by which time the Japanese forces in the area, boosted by their victory at Porton, had begun to seize the initiative through the use of harassment tactics. Following this several small-scale actions continued along the front until offensive action was discontinued on 11 August 1945 as the war came to a conclusion.|$|E

5|$|Sentiment {{against the}} Coinage Act of 1873 gained {{strength}} {{as the economy}} worsened following the Panic of 1873. Democratic Representative Richard P. Bland of Missouri proposed {{a bill that would}} require the United States buy as much silver as miners could sell the government and strike it into coins, a system that would increase the money supply and aid debtors. In short, silver miners would sell the government metal worth fifty to seventy cents and receive back a silver dollar. The pro-silver idea cut across party lines, and William B. Allison, a Republican from Iowa, led <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>in</b> the Senate. Allison offered an amendment in the Senate requiring the purchase of two to four million dollars per month of silver, but not allowing private deposit of silver at the mints. Thus the seignorage, or the difference between the face value of the coin and the worth of the metal contained within it, accrued to the government's credit, not private citizens. The resulting Bland–Allison Act passed both houses of Congress in 1878. Hayes feared that the act would cause inflation through the expansion of the money supply that would be ruinous to business. Sherman's opinion was more complicated. He knew that silver was gaining popularity, and opposing it might harm the party's candidates in the 1880 elections, but he also agreed with Hayes in wanting to avoid inflation.|$|E
5|$|Stigand {{may have}} been in charge of the royal administration. He may also have been behind the effort to locate Edward the Atheling and his brother Edmund after 1052, {{possibly}} to secure a more acceptable heir to King Edward. His landholdings were spread across ten counties, and in some of those counties, his lands were larger than the king's holdings. Although Norman propagandists claimed that as early as 1051 or 1052 King Edward promised the throne of England to Duke William of Normandy, who later became King William the Conqueror, there is little contemporary evidence of such a promise from non-Norman sources. By 1053, Edward probably realised that he would not have a son from his marriage, and he and his advisors began to search for an heir. Edward the Atheling, the son of King Edmund Ironside (reigned 1016), had been exiled from England in 1017, after his father's death. Although Ealdred, the Bishop of Worcester, went to the Continent in search of Edward the Exile, Ian Walker, the biographer of King Harold Godwinson, feels that Stigand was behind <b>the</b> <b>effort.</b> <b>In</b> the end, although Edward did return to England, he died soon after his return, leaving a young son Edgar the Ætheling.|$|E
5|$|The {{attempt at}} repeal {{did not end}} the {{controversy}} over silver. Democratic Representative Richard P. Bland of Missouri proposed {{a bill that would}} require the United States to buy as much silver as miners could sell the government and strike it into coins, a system that would increase the money supply and aid debtors. In short, silver miners would sell the government metal worth fifty to seventy cents, and receive back a silver dollar. Randall allowed the bill to come to the floor for an up-or-down vote during a special session in November 1877: the result was its passage by a vote of 163 to 34 (with 94 members absent). The pro-silver idea cut across party lines, and William B. Allison, a Republican from Iowa led <b>the</b> <b>effort</b> <b>in</b> the Senate. Allison offered an amendment in the Senate requiring the purchase of two to four million dollars per month of silver, but not allowing private deposit of silver at the mints. Thus, the seignorage, or difference between the face value of the coin and the worth of the metal contained within it accrued to the government's credit, not private citizens. President Hayes vetoed the bill, but Congress overrode the veto, and the Bland–Allison Act became law.|$|E
