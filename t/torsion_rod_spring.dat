50|$|Recently {{another type}} of opener, known as the {{jackshaft}} opener, has become more popular. This style of opener was used frequently on commercial doors {{but in recent years}} has been adapted for residential use. This style of opener consists of a motor that attaches to the side of the <b>torsion</b> <b>rod</b> and moves the door up and down by simply spinning the rod. These openers need a few extra components to function safely for residential use. These include a cable tension monitor, to detect when a cable is broken, and a separate locking mechanism to lock the door when it is fully closed. These have the advantage that they free up ceiling space that an ordinary opener and rail would occupy. These also have the disadvantage that the door must have a <b>torsion</b> <b>rod</b> to attach the motor to.|$|R

Whereas conventional variable-pitch propellers rotate at the blade root, the Ivoprop design has its blade fixed. The blade is hollow, containing a steel <b>torsion</b> <b>rod</b> {{fixed to the}} blade tip. By mechanically turning the rod within the hub, a twist is achieved which adjusts the blade's angle of attack.|$|R

We are interested in establishing whether solutions exist whose gradient "avoids" the region of non-strict convexity.

40|$|Polycrystalline {{samples of}} hcp ⁴He of molar volume Vm = 19. 5 cm³ with {{small amount of}} ³He {{impurities}} were grown in an annular container by the blocked-capillary method. Three concentrations of ³He, x₃, were studied: isotopically purified ⁴He with the estimated x₃ < 10 ⁻¹⁰, commercial ‘well-grade’ helium with x₃ 3 ⋅ 10 ⁻⁷ and a mixture with x₃ = 2. 5 ⋅ 10 ⁻⁶. Torsional oscillations at two frequencies, 132. 5 and 853. 6 Hz, and thermal conductivity were investigated before and after annealing. The solid helium under investigation was located {{not only in the}} annular container but also in the axial fill line inside two <b>torsion</b> <b>rods</b> and dummy bob of the doublefrequency torsional oscillator. The analysis of the frequency shifts upon loading with helium and changing temperatures of different parts of the oscillator suggests that the three techniques probe the properties of solid helium in three different locations: the two different torsion modes respond to the changes of the shear modulus of solid helium in either of the two <b>torsion</b> <b>rods</b> while the thermal conductivity probes the phonon mean free path in solid helium inside the annular container. The temperature and width of the torsional anomaly increase with increasing frequency and x₃. The phonon mean free path increases with increasing x 3. Annealing typically resulted in an increased phonon mean free path but often in little change in the torsional oscillator response. While the magnitude of the torsional anomaly and phonon mean free path can be very different in different samples, no correlation was found between them...|$|R

Dealers already up and running did not always have good things to say, such as one Los Angeles agency who said [...] "Motors too small and <b>torsion</b> <b>rod</b> weakness not improved".

50|$|With {{electronic}} (indicating) torque wrenches, measurement is {{by means}} of a strain gauge attached to the <b>torsion</b> <b>rod.</b> The signal generated by the transducer is converted to the required unit of torque (e.g. N·m or lbf·ft) and shown on the digital display. A number of different joints (measurement details or limit values) can be stored. These programmed limit values are then permanently displayed during the tightening process {{by means of}} LEDs or the display. At the same time, this generation of torque wrenches can store all the measurements made in an internal readings memory. This readings memory can then be easily transferred to a PC via the interface (RS232) or printed straight to a printer. A popular application of this kind of torque wrench is for in-process documentation or quality assurance purposes. Typical accuracy level would be +/- 0.5% to 4%.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} use of nanomechanical torsional resonators for frequency-shift-based infrared (IR) thermal sensing. Nanoscale <b>torsion</b> <b>rods,</b> ~ 1 μm {{long and}} 50 – 100 nm in diameter, provide both extraordinary thermal isolation and excellent angular displacement and torque sensitivities, of order ~ 10 ^(– 7) rad·Hz^(– 1 / 2) and 10 ^(– 22) (N·m) Hz^(– 1 / 2), respectively. Furthermore, these nanorods act as linear torsional springs, yielding a maximum angular displacement of 3. 6 ° and a dynamic range of over 100 dB; this exceeds {{the performance of}} flexural modes {{by as much as}} 5 orders of magnitude. These attributes lead to superior noise performance for torsional-mode sensing. We demonstrate the operational principles of torsional-mode IR detection, attaining an uncooled noise equivalent temperature difference (NETD) of 390 mK. By modeling the fundamental noise processes, we project that further reduction of device size can significantly improve thermal responsivity; a room-temperature NETD below 10 mK appears feasible...|$|R
40|$|We have {{measured}} {{the response of}} a torsional oscillator containing polycrystalline hcp solid ^ 4 He to applied steady rotation {{in an attempt to}} verify the observations of several other groups that were initially interpreted as evidence for macroscopic quantum effects. The geometry of the cell was that of a simple annulus, with a fill line of relatively narrow diameter in the centre of the <b>torsion</b> <b>rod.</b> Varying the angular velocity of rotation up to 2 rad s^- 1 showed that there were no step-like features in the resonant frequency or dissipation of the oscillator and no history dependence, even though we achieved the sensitivity required to detect the various effects seen in earlier experiments on other rotating cryostats. All small changes during rotation were consistent with those occurring with an empty cell. We thus observed no effects on the samples of solid ^ 4 He attributable to steady rotation.

5000|$|One {{can measure}} the {{superfluid}} {{response of the}} film by measuring the moment of inertia. An indispensable tool {{for this is the}} Torsional Oscillator, and early design was first used by Andronikashvili to detect superfluid in bulk fluid 4He and later modified by John Reppy and co-workers at Cornell in the 1970s. In the torsional oscillator, the experimental volume is suspended by a <b>torsion</b> <b>rod</b> and made to oscillate at resonance via capacitive coupling with a fin or pair of fins, depending on the configuration (shown below in grey). When part of the film becomes superfluid, it no longer has any viscosity and will remain at rest in the lab frame, lowering the moment of inertia of the cell. Recall that the resonant period of a torsional oscillator is [...] Therefore, lowering the moment of inertia reduces the resonant period of the oscillator. By measuring the period drop as a function of temperature, and total loading of the film from the empty cell value, one can deduce the fraction of the film that has entered the superfluid state. A typical set of data clearly showing the superfluid decoupling in helium films is shown in ref. 2.|$|R
