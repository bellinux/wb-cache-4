On Lewis's analysis, however, both (1) and (2) are false, for <b>the</b> <b>worlds</b> <b>where</b> <b>the</b> coin lands heads are no more or less close than <b>the</b> <b>worlds</b> <b>where</b> they land tails.

5|$|Diptera {{is one of}} {{the major}} insect orders and are of {{considerable}} ecological and human importance. Flies are important pollinators, second only to the bees and their Hymenopteran relatives. Flies may have been among the evolutionarily earliest pollinators responsible for early plant pollination. Fruit flies are used as model organisms in research, but less benignly, mosquitoes are vectors for malaria, dengue, West Nile fever, yellow fever, encephalitis, and other infectious diseases, and houseflies spread food-borne illnesses. Flies can be annoyances especially in some parts of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>where</b> they can occur in large numbers, buzzing and settling on the skin or eyes to bite or seek fluids. Larger flies such as tsetse flies and screwworms cause significant economic harm to cattle. Blowfly larvae, known as gentles, and other dipteran larvae, known more generally as maggots, are used as fishing bait and as food for carnivorous animals. They are also used in medicine in debridement to clean wounds.|$|E

5|$|From 20 to 24 February, Gočeva held five concerts at the Macedonian Opera and Ballet (MOB) {{during which}} she {{performed}} songs from Makedonsko Devojče 2 live for the first time. The concertgoers {{were the first to}} receive copies of the album along with their tickets which were put on sale on 9 December 2013. In 2014, 15,000 tickets were sold for Gočeva's concerts in Skopje. In January 2014, a listening party for the album was held at the club XO in Skopje on which Gočeva was also present; the event represented the first of such kind in Macedonia and according to Gočeva, the inspiration for it came from a similar trend popular across <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>where</b> the artist and the team working behind the album listen to the full final version of the project together with a group of fans and music journalists.|$|E

5|$|In {{the eastern}} Pacific, hawksbills {{are known to}} occur from the Baja Peninsula in Mexico south along the coast to {{southern}} Peru. Nonetheless, as recently as 2007, the species had been considered largely extirpated in the region. Important remnant nesting and foraging sites have since been discovered in Mexico, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Ecuador, providing new opportunities for research and conservation. In contrast to their traditional roles {{in other parts of}} <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>where</b> hawksbills primarily inhabit coral reefs and rocky substrate areas, in the eastern Pacific, hawksbills tend to forage and nest principally in mangrove estuaries, such as those present in the Bahia de Jiquilisco (El Salvador), Gulf of Fonseca (Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Honduras), Estero Padre Ramos (Nicaragua), and the Gulf of Guayaquil (Ecuador). Multi-national initiatives, such as the , are currently pushing efforts to research and conserve the population, which remains poorly understood.|$|E

5|$|Modern animal {{husbandry}} relies on production systems {{adapted to the}} type of land available. Subsistence farming is being superseded by intensive animal farming in the more developed parts of <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>where</b> for example beef cattle are kept in high density feedlots, and thousands of chickens may be raised in broiler houses or batteries. On poorer soil such as in uplands, animals are often kept more extensively, and may be allowed to roam widely, foraging for themselves. Most livestock are herbivores, except for the pig which is an omnivore. Ruminants like cattle and sheep are adapted to feed on grass; they can forage outdoors, or may be fed entirely or in part on rations richer in energy and protein, such as pelleted cereals. Pigs and poultry cannot digest the cellulose in forage, and require cereals and other high-energy foods.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the Spanish flu pandemic, and the {{relationship}} between the near-simultaneous outbreaks in humans and swine, have been controversial. One hypothesis is that the virus strain originated at Fort Riley, Kansas, in viruses in poultry and swine which the fort bred for food; the soldiers were then sent from Fort Riley around <b>the</b> <b>world,</b> <b>where</b> they spread the disease. Similarities between a reconstruction of the virus and avian viruses, combined with the human pandemic preceding the first reports of influenza in swine, led researchers to conclude the influenza virus jumped directly from birds to humans, and swine caught the disease from humans.|$|E
5|$|The subgenre has {{its origins}} in open world action {{adventure}} games popularized in Europe (and particularly the United Kingdom) throughout the 1980s and 1990s. The release of Grand Theft Auto (1997) marked a major commercial success for open-ended game design in North America, and featured a more marketable crime theme. But it was the popularity of its 3D sequel Grand Theft Auto III in 2001 {{that led to the}} widespread propagation of a more specific set of gameplay conventions consistent with a subgenre. The subgenre now includes many games from different developers all over <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>where</b> the player can control wide ranges of vehicles and weapons. The subgenre has evolved with greater levels of environmental detail and more realistic behaviors.|$|E

5|$|There are {{virtually}} no {{parts of the}} world left where the weapon dance is directly connected with imminent or recent combat. This is especially true of European states, which have long since moved away from the tribalism that usually gives rise to such folk dances. It is, however, also true of parts of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>where</b> tribal traditions have succumbed to colonialism and the forces of globalism. The dances that one sees today are often part of general movements to preserve and rejuvenate tribal or local traditions. Some of these movements are quite strong now, such as those among native North American tribes and the aboriginal peoples of Australia.|$|E
5|$|A further Scottish {{distinction}} {{from the}} UK flag days {{is that on}} Saint Andrew's Day, (30 November), the Union Flag will only be flown where a building {{has more than one}} flagpole; the Saltire will not be lowered {{to make way for the}} Union Flag where a single flagpole is present. If there are two or more flagpoles present, the Saltire may be flown in addition to the Union Flag but not in a superior position. This distinction arose after Members of the Scottish Parliament complained that Scotland was the only country in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>where</b> the potential existed for the citizens of a country to be unable to fly their national flag on their country's national day. (In recent years, embassies of the United Kingdom have also flown the Saltire to mark St Andrew's Day). Many bodies of the Scottish Government use the flag as a design basis for their logo; for example, Safer Scotland's emblem depicts a lighthouse shining beams in a saltire shape onto a blue sky. Other Scottish bodies, both private and public, have also used the saltire in similar ways.|$|E
5|$|Many of Gibraltar's fortifications {{were already}} {{redundant}} {{well before the}} British garrison was withdrawn from the territory in the 1990s, and the rapid military rundown in the 1980s and the 1990s left the civilian authorities with {{a large amount of}} surplus military property. Many of the best-preserved fortifications are in the Upper Rock Nature Reserve, a conservation area that covers about 40% of the area of Gibraltar. A few of the Upper Rock batteries have been preserved intact; all three of the 5.25-inch guns at Princess Anne's Battery are still in place, making it the only place in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>where</b> a complete 5.25-inch battery can still be seen. The 9.2 inch guns at Breakneck, Lord Airey's and O'Hara's Batteries are still in situ and can now be visited. Elsewhere, most of the ordnance has been removed. Two surviving 6-inch guns remain at Devil's Gap Battery, one of which is the gun that engaged a German U-boat in August 1917. At Napier of Magdala Battery one of the two 100-ton RML 17.72 inch guns is still in situ and has been restored, along with a 3.7 inch quick-firing anti-aircraft gun. The site is now run by the Gibraltar Tourist Board in conjunction with the Nature Reserve.|$|E
