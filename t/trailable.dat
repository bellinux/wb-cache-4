50|$|The first marine ply <b>trailable</b> yacht {{designed}} for home construction was the Silhouette, designed in 1953 by Robert Tucker in the UK. By 1960 {{there were over}} a thousand sailing throughout the world. The concept was adopted by Richard Hartley in New Zealand with the Hartley TS16/18/21, a range of multichine plywood <b>trailable</b> yachts.|$|E

50|$|The Hartley TS16 is a clean-lined, {{conventional}} <b>trailable</b> yacht that is {{the most}} popular in Australia. It is light, easy to rig, launch and retrieve and can be towed by a family car; many have been built by amateur builders. The later advent of fiberglass <b>trailable</b> boats and increasing materials cost reduced the popularity of home builds. Many of them are raced, but are not allowed to use a spinnaker.|$|E

50|$|The Bay to Bay {{race was}} {{originally}} conceived {{by members of}} the Hervey Bay Sailing Club on 18 April 1980. Originally suggested as a one-day <b>Trailable</b> Yacht race from Tin Can Bay to Hervey Bay, the course length of approximately 87km saw it modified to a two-day event, with an overnight stop at Garry's Anchorage part way up the Great Sandy Strait. Although it was originally thought that no more than 30 people would participate in the race, over 114 vessels arrived to compete in the inaugural event in 1981.|$|E

50|$|When the Yachting Australia <b>Trailable</b> Yacht & Sports Boat Rule was {{established}} in 2008 it used the MA designation of 0.600 in common use throughout Australia but mistakenly included the CBH list of the TYA of NSW based in southern NSW which had the 3/4 rig at 0.625 based on the Mk2 racing version and a CBH for a MH* without spinnaker which had never raced. In 2010 the CBH list was changed to 0.625 for both rigs based on the racing version of the Hartley 18 but with the class rules that of the Hartley 18-21 YC of Victoria for their smaller sailed cruising version. Thus, the racing version was excluded from Yachting Australia events as a standard class yacht.|$|E
50|$|Between 1956 and 1968 Fairey Marine {{produced}} some 291 Atalanta class sailing yachts, designed by Uffa Fox: The Atalanta was conceived in 1955 by Alan Vines, a senior executive at Fairey, with {{the expertise of}} Uffa Fox who was their Design Consultant. It was envisaged as a <b>trailable</b> shallow draft performance cruiser with the sea keeping capabilities and safety of a fin keel yacht. Over the succeeding decades the distinctive centre cockpit design with its rolled decks and generous accommodation has more than fulfilled expectations, offering a respectable turn of speed in light airs while her retractable cast iron keels give outstanding heavy weather performance in a seaway. Robust enough to carry its full sail in winds up to force five, the Atalanta retains many of the handling characteristics of a classic dinghy.|$|E
