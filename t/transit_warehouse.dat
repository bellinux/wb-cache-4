5000|$|The [...] "D" [...] Shed is a {{cast-iron}} framed structure with cruciform columns, a roof structure {{and a variety}} of similarly unique features. The structure is five 20 foot bays long and two 20 foot bays wide. It was erected as a <b>transit</b> <b>warehouse</b> and appeared on the first edition Ordnance Survey map from surveys carried out in the 1870s. Originally sited alongside Bute East Dock Basin it was also served by rail. The “D Shed” has a Grade II listing and is one of only a few mid-nineteenth century buildings in Cardiff Bay. It has wholly cast cruciform columns and the eaves beams have been constructed out of simple available riveted sections. The cast iron used in the eave beams is stamped 'Rhymney' so it is assumed manufacture was in the Rhymney Ironworks. The roof truss design includes a bent bottom member and cast iron stays.|$|E
50|$|It {{was built}} during the Nasrid reign before 1336, and his {{original}} name was Al-Funduq al-Gidida or New Alhóndiga. Located {{south of the}} Muslim city, next to the silk market or Alcaicería, to the souk of the Medina and to the Main Mosque, served as inn for merchants in <b>transit,</b> <b>warehouse</b> and wholesale market. A small bridge was called al-qantara al-yadída (new bridge) until 1501, and later puente del carbón or puente del Álamo or puente de los Curtidores (qantarat al-Dabbayin), located on the Darro River communicated the Alhóndiga with the souk. In general, as described Leopoldo Torres Balbás (Chronicles of Archaeology of Muslim Spain, XIX. Tomo 2. PP 235), this building responds to an Oriental model, but the decor and the details are distinctly Grenadian. Its ancestry can be traced from the Greek agoras, through the after the Roman horreum until Islamic times. The monumental cover comes from the eastern iwan, whose origins have been much discussed, and that {{is already in the}} Sassanian palaces. The transmission to the West would be through the Egypt, where the entrance portico opened by a large arch, vaulted with mocárabes, and at the bottom is the lintel door of access to the building, and a twin window above, is architectural layout very widespread. It is for example in Cairo in the Al-Zahir of Baybars I (665-1309) or Granada with the Gate of Justice in Alhambra (749-1348).|$|E

50|$|After the American Civil War, Detroit-Windsor was a {{destination}} stop for railroads in the area. The Michigan Central and the Great Western railroads {{in addition to}} others operated {{on either side of}} the border connecting Chicago with the Atlantic Seaboard. To cross the Detroit River, these railroads operated ferries between docks on either side. The ferries lacked the capacity to handle the shipping needs of the railroads, and frequently there were 700-1,000 freight cars waiting to cross the river, with numerous passengers delayed in <b>transit.</b> <b>Warehouses</b> in Chicago were forced to store grain that could not be shipped to eastern markets and foreign goods were stored in eastern warehouses waiting shipment to the western United States. The net effect of these delays increased commodity prices in the country, and both merchants and farmers wanted a solution from the railroads.|$|R

This site was a three-story stable for the horses that pulled Toronto Street Railways horsecars in the late 19th century, {{as well as an}} electrical generating plant and a Toronto <b>Transit</b> Commission <b>warehouse.</b> The warehouse sat empty for much of the 20th century and was ready for demolition before it was chosen by YPT as its home. The building was renovated in 1977 by Zeidler Partnership Architects to contain a large main stage (the current day Susan Douglas Rubes Theatre) and a smaller studio (the Nathan Cohen Studio). YPT was given an Award of Merit by the Toronto Historical Board in 1979, [...] "for its imaginative and sympathetic treatment of a landmark that might otherwise have been destroyed".|$|R

To analyze a system like this, a simulation model has been developed with a flexible AGVs transport system, a <b>Transit</b> Point <b>Warehouse</b> acted by AS/RS, used also as sorting media. The size of the warehouse incoming bay, number of warehouse sub allocation zones or aisles, the capacity of all queues, all control logics for AGV's have been evaluated in a pre-modeling phase, and then evaluated by the model. © 2013 DIME UNIVERSITÀ DI GENOVA...|$|R
5000|$|Although still a port, Barry {{is more of}} a {{manufacturing}} town and as a service centre for the Vale of Glamorgan. Barry Docks and the adjoining industrial area form the largest employment centre in the town. The docks, whose road links were dramatically improved {{with the opening of the}} Docks Link Road in 1981, now have direct road access with the M4 motorway. The docks can handle vessels up to 23,000 tonnes and the first-class tidal position close to the deep-water channel of the Severn Estuary, allows for scheduled sailings. With its <b>transit</b> sheds, <b>warehouses</b> and open storage, the docks are equipped to handle bulk cargoes but with the scrapping of their former electric cranes, ships’ own derricks have to be used or cranes hired in by ABP as required. Two roll on/roll off berths are available and have been used by routes to Ireland and West Africa. As at January 2016, Intermodal raifreight traffic is being operated from No.2 Dock. With a new presence on the Mole in No.1 Dock and the provision of a concrete slipway from it, leisure rowing and dinghy sailing is available (2016).|$|R
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{determine}} the fundamental factors influencing maintenance costs of logistic buildings and to provide benchmark indications for designing maintenance efficient warehouses that contribute to the enhancement of business performance. Design/methodology/approach - The relations between factors and indicators of building facilities maintenance costs are examined using regression analysis of a dataset collected from about 100 distribution warehouses leased by a leading global freight provider throughout Italy. Findings - Maintenance cost reduction can only be achieved by making appropriate design decisions on the strategic characteristics of warehouse facilities. In particular, the location and the age of a building are relevant factors of breakdown maintenance, while the monthly volume of freight <b>transiting</b> the <b>warehouse</b> is a significant cost factor of maintenance due to damage. Research limitations/implications - This paper is limited to logistic service providing organisations, has local impact, and does not consider operational requirements in suggesting design criteria. Further research may gainfully generalise the model by examining other businesses, geographical areas and industrial operations issues. Leasing and frequently relocating facilities have emerged as appropriate distribution management strategies to control location, size and age of a building, and thus to face dynamic business conditions. Originality/value - This paper provides maintenance cost benchmarks and supports design decision making of distribution warehouse facilities...|$|R
30|$|It is {{anticipated}} that Malaysia’s ports, {{such as the}} Port Klang, Johor Port and Port of Tanjung Pelepas, will lose ship calls and traffic volume, which will lead to significant losses in port business due to the Kra Canal. On the other hand, the Penang Port has an advantage {{as a result of}} its geographical location which is close to the canal. Therefore, the Penang Port can be promoted as the hub port of Malaysia. Consequently, current facilities such as berth areas (e.g., container, break bulk, dry bulk, liquid, passenger, and bunker berths), storage (e.g., <b>warehouses,</b> <b>transit</b> sheds, covered storage, and open yards), equipment (e.g., quay cranes, pilot and tug boats, trailers, prime movers, and stackers) and information technology (e.g., Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) system), need to be upgraded and significantly optimised. In addition, port efficiency also needs to be assessed and enhanced in order to provide competitive services. Collaborative research, and domestic and foreign investments should be encouraged to hasten the process.|$|R
25|$|From 1905 to 1919, major {{improvements}} {{took place in}} the port under the stewardship of the visionary Sir Francis Spring. Being an artificial harbour, the port was vulnerable to cyclones and accretion of sand inside the basin due to underwater currents, which reduced the draft. To charter the course of the port development, Spring, who assumed charge as the chief engineer of the port in 1906, drew a long-term plan in a scientific manner to overcome challenges, both artificial and natural. The shifting of the entrance of the port from eastern side to the northeastern side protected the port to a large extent from the natural vulnerabilities. By this time, the port covered an area of 400 acres. By the end of 1920, the port had a dock consisting of four berths in the west quays, one each in the east and south quay along with the <b>transit</b> sheds, <b>warehouses</b> and a marshalling yard to facilitate the transfer of cargo from land to sea and vice versa. In 1929, the Mercantile Marine Department, which was working directly under the Ministry of Shipping till the establishment of the Directorate General of Shipping at Mumbai in 1949, was established to implement the first SOLAS and Load Line conventions. Additional berths were added in the 1940s with a berth at south quay and another between WQ2 and WQ3. The year 1946 saw the establishment of the Port Health Organisation. In 1947, when India gained independence, Chennai became the capital of the Madras State, renamed as Tamil Nadu in 1969.|$|R
