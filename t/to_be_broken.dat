5|$|After 1544 {{the estate}} began <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>broken</b> up; first the parks were sold {{and then the}} castle itself, bought by Lord Richard Rich from Edward VI for £700 in 1551. Rich {{dismantled}} the castle {{for the value of}} its stone, primarily between 1551 and 1575, and the castle, now thoroughly ruined, passed through Rich's descendants.|$|E

5|$|Miami's Jimmy Cox {{was named}} the game's most {{valuable}} player after catching five passes for 77yards—accounting for nearly half of Miami's total offensive output. Miami earned just three rushing first downs during the game, setting a Liberty Bowl record that has yet <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>broken.</b>|$|E

5|$|Occasionally, {{individual}} murderers {{were perceived}} to have been so heinous that standard punishments like beheading or <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>broken</b> on the wheel were not regarded as sufficiently commensurate with their crimes, and extended rituals of execution that might include impalement were devised. The case of Pavel Vašanský (Paul Wasansky in German transcript) may serve as an example here.|$|E
5|$|The {{doctrine}} {{emphasizes the}} importance of personal empowerment, proposing that it is God's will for his people to be happy. The atonement (reconciliation with God) is interpreted to include the alleviation of sickness and poverty, which are viewed as curses <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>broken</b> by faith. This is believed to be achieved through donations of money, visualization, and positive confession.|$|E
5|$|This final voyage was {{depicted}} in a J. M. W.

5|$|After {{end of the}} war in November, {{the ship}} was {{relieved}} of her assignment with the 4th Battle Squadron and assigned to the Nore in February 1919 and placed in reserve there the following month. She was paid off on 18 February 1920 at Chatham Dockyard and was used for harbour service at Dartmouth until she was sold for scrap on 13 July 1926 <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>broken</b> up at Alloa, Rosyth.|$|E
5|$|After the {{decision}} was taken to cancel all the stories previously commissioned for Season 23, new stories were sought for the shortened 14 episode series. The plan was for three production blocks, divided up into two four-episode lots and one block of six episodes. Robert Holmes was assigned the opening four-part story and Philip Martin the second four-part story. The final six episodes were <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>broken</b> up into three two-part stories.|$|E
5|$|As on the White Pass trail, {{supplies}} needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>broken</b> {{down into}} smaller packages and carried in relay. Packers, prepared to carry supplies for cash, were available {{along the route}} but would charge up to $1 ($27) per lb (0.45kg) on the later stages; many of these packers were natives: Tlingits or, less commonly, Tagish. Avalanches were common in the mountains and, on April 3, 1898, one {{claimed the lives of}} more than 60 people travelling over Chilkoot Pass.|$|E

5|$|Demolition {{began in}} August 1967. The {{contract}} {{was awarded to}} Nordman Construction after an unsuccessful tender process. The company brought in the Magnus II, a floating crane with a lifting capacity of 400tons, which could remove {{all but two of}} the spans. These longer spans were pulled sideways off the piers, expecting that they would break into manageable pieces under their own weight. They proved stronger than this and remained intact, needing <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>broken</b> up in the river, with much sinking into the bed instead of being recovered.|$|E
5|$|In February 1917, Prince of Wales {{was ordered}} {{to return to the}} United Kingdom. On her voyage home, she called at Gibraltar from 28 February 1917 to 10 March 1917 and arrived at Devonport Dockyard later in March. She was placed in reserve on arrival and used as an {{accommodation}} ship. Prince of Wales was placed on the disposal list on 10 November 1919, and was sold for scrap to Thos W Ward on 12 April 1920. The ship arrived at Milford Haven, Wales, <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>broken</b> up in June 1920.|$|E
5|$|In January 1923, {{the ship}} {{returned}} home {{and became a}} gunnery training ship at Devonport. She was relieved of that duty in November and King George V was reduced to reserve. She was then assigned to the training establishment HMS Impregnable. On 28 September 1926, the ship {{was taken out of}} service and was listed for disposal on 1 December to meet the tonnage limitations of the Washington Naval Treaty. Later that month, King George V was sold to the Alloa Shipbreaking Company and arrived at Rosyth on 27 January 1927 <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>broken</b> up.|$|E

5|$|In June 1873, Lee left Dublin for London {{and never}} returned. A {{fortnight}} later, Bessie followed him; {{the two girls}} joined her. Shaw's explanation of why his mother followed Lee was that without the latter's financial contribution the joint household had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>broken</b> up.

5|$|Two earlier {{business}} decisions by the Chicago Sun-Times led to substantial savings {{of time and}} money during the Trump Tower's construction. The original 1950s sea wall was built by the newspaper company to bomb-shelter thickness, to withstand a Cold War attack, and thus did not have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>broken</b> down and rebuilt. Furthermore, the company decided in the 1970s to switch from petroleum-based to soy-based ink, which reduced ground pollution from the printing plant. This considerably reduced the costs and time for cleaning up the site prior to building anew.|$|E
5|$|After {{undergoing}} substantial repairs, Temeraire {{was employed}} blockading the French fleets and supporting British operations off the Spanish coasts. She {{went out to}} the Baltic in 1809, defending convoys against Danish gunboat attacks, and by 1810 was off the Spanish coast again, helping to defend Cadiz against a French army. Her last action was against the French off Toulon, when she came under fire from shore batteries. The ship returned to Britain in 1813 for repairs, but was laid up. She was converted to a prison ship and moored in the River Tamar until 1819. Further service brought her to Sheerness as a receiving ship, then a victualling depot, and finally a guard ship. The Admiralty ordered her to be sold in 1838, and she was towed up the Thames <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>broken</b> up.|$|E

5|$|Almost {{immediately}} after it returned to Baghdad, in January 803, the Abbasid court witnessed the abrupt {{fall of the}} Barmakid family from power. On the one hand, this decision may {{reflect the fact that}} the Barmakids may have become indeed too powerful for the Caliph's liking, but its timing suggests that it was tied to the succession issue as well: with al-Amin siding with the abnaʾ and al-Ma'mun with the Barmakids, and the two camps becoming more estranged every day, if al-Amin was {{to have a chance to}} succeed, the power of the Barmakids had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>broken.</b> Indeed, the years after the fall of the Barmakids saw an increasing centralization of the administration and the concomitant rise of the influence of the abnaʾ, many of whom were now dispatched to take up positions as provincial governors and bring these provinces under closer control from Baghdad.|$|E
5|$|Ammiraglio di Saint Bon {{served in}} the active {{squadron}} of the Italian navy for the first several years of her career. She {{was assigned to the}} 3rd Division during the Italo-Turkish War of 1911–1912. During the war, she was involved in the seizure of the island of Rhodes, where she provided gunfire support to Italian infantry. The ship was obsolescent by World War I and was slated <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>broken</b> up in 1914–15, but the need for warships granted Ammiraglio di Saint Bon a respite. She spent the war as a harbor defense ship in Venice and, after April 1916, was used primarily as a floating anti-aircraft battery. She was stricken from the naval register in June 1920 and subsequently broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Beecham {{began making}} {{recordings}} in 1910, when the acoustical process obliged orchestras {{to use only}} principal instruments, placed {{as close to the}} recording horn as possible. His first recordings, for HMV, were of excerpts from Offenbach's The Tales of Hoffmann and Johann Strauss's Die Fledermaus. In 1915, Beecham began recording for the Columbia Graphophone Company. Electrical recording technology (introduced in 1925–26) made it possible to record a full orchestra with much greater frequency range, and Beecham quickly embraced the new medium. Longer scores had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>broken</b> into four-minute segments to fit on 12-inch 78-rpm discs, but Beecham was not averse to recording piecemeal– his well-known 1932 disc of Chabrier's España was recorded in two sessions three weeks apart. Beecham recorded many of his favourite works several times, taking advantage of improved technology over the decades.|$|E
