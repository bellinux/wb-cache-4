40|$|Pension funds manage {{approximately}} 45 % of US {{capital market}} equity capitalization, about US$ 7. 1 trillion, and manage 55 % of the Australian one, about US$ 0. 65 trillion. Their yearly fee charges exceed US$ 100 billion. We ask whether US and Australian investors would earn, on average, higher net returns {{by investing in}} equity retirement funds than by investing in publicly traded passive index funds. We use twenty years of Morningstar data covering 8 % and 23 % of total pension assets in the US and Australia, respectively. We perform Sharpe Style analysis replicating pension funds styles by using <b>Treasury</b> <b>assets</b> and traded index funds. We find that both US and Australian investors who invest in actively managed equity pension funds would earn no higher net returns than those generated from the passive style-matching portfolios. Also, we do not find risk-adjusted abnormal returns of US equity pension funds, while we do find negative risk-adjusted abnormal returns of Australian equity pension funds, after controlling for risk using unconditional and conditional sensitivities to the Fama, French, and Carhart factors. Because ETFs (exchange-traded funds) were introduced relatively recently, sufficient data is not available for this study; ETF investments, with typically lower expense ratios, would have enhanced our results. As most retirement savings are compulsory and regulated, there are policy implications to governments, public and private employers, and pension savers. In particular, facilitating investing in traded passive index funds, or facilitating switching from actively managed pension funds to traded passive index funds would increase societal welfare by increasing retirement contribution values and might free significant human capital to productive ventures...|$|E

40|$|Monetary {{policy has}} become {{difficult}} to characterize or follow since 2007. A debate {{as to whether}} interest rate targets or monetary aggregate targets are better indicators of policy and prospective outcomes {{has given way to}} a new credit policy built on inflating the Federal Reserve (Fed) balance sheet to provide private sector credit. This policy grew out of the Great Depression and has led the Fed to ignore monetary growth and render a federal funds rate target impotent by pushing it to zero. To implement the more than doubling of the Fed’s assets, the Fed took up commercial banking policies. Three examples are: selling <b>Treasury</b> <b>assets</b> to fund private assets, paying subsidies to banks for holding reserves and attracting a new class of Treasury debt sterilized in Fed deposits. These actions insulated monetary aggregates and the effective monetary base from the explosion in the Fed’s balance sheet. The new credit policy severed the tight link that had existed for over 70 years between Fed credit and its effective monetary base. Fortunately, it also insulated the economy from a more than doubling of the general price level. But these actions have turned the balance sheet of the Fed into a collection of illiquid and risky private assets. A similar portfolio of government securities that has the longest duration in history and therefore the greatest interest rate risk limits the Fed’s ability to reduce its assets or the excess reserve position of banks, exceeding $ 1. 5 trillion and costing the taxpayer over $ 3. 3 billion, from 2009 to mid- 2011. The subsidy and excess reserve levels {{of the first half of}} 2011 will cost $ 2. 3 billion per year going forward. Finally, the paper rebuts claims by Fed officials that the Fed has successfully followed the framework of monetary policy developed by Milton Friedman. The paper concludes with recommendations for Congressional restrictions on the Fed and Treasury to ensure that the Fed focus on responsible monetary policy and not its failed credit policy. ...|$|E
