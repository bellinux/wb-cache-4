40|$|By human sensory analyses, {{we found}} that various {{extracellular}} calcium-sensing receptor (CaSR) agonists enhance sweet, salty, and umami tastes, although they have no taste themselves. These characteristics are known as “kokumi taste” and often appear in traditional Japanese cuisine. Although GSH is a typical kokumi <b>taste</b> <b>substance</b> (<b>taste</b> enhancer), {{its mode of action}} is poorly understood.

We identified a large number of CaSR agonist γ-glutamyl peptides, including GSH (γ-Glu-Cys-Gly) and γ-Glu-Val-Gly, and showed that these peptides elicit the kokumi taste. Further analyses revealed that some known CaSR agonists such as Ca 2 +, protamine, polylysine, l-histidine, and cinacalcet (a calcium-mimetic drug) also elicit the kokumi taste and that the CaSR-specific antagonist, NPS- 2143, significantly suppresses the kokumi taste.

When the dielectric material of an IDC sensing element comes into contact with a taste substance, its dielectric properties change with the capacitance of the IDC sensing element; this, in turn, changes the voltage across the IDC, {{as well as the}} output voltage of each channel of the system. In order to assess the effectiveness of the sensing system, four <b>taste</b> <b>substances,</b> namely sourness (HCl), saltiness (NaCl), sweetness (glucose) and bitterness (quinine-HCl), were tested. The IDC taste sensor array had rapid response and recovery times of about 12. 9 s and 13. 39 s, respectively, with highly stable response properties. The response property of the proposed IDC taste sensor array was linear, and its correlation coefficient R 2 was about 0. 9958 over the dynamic range of the taste sensor array as the taste substance concentration was varied from 1 μM to 1 M.

40|$|The {{sense of}} taste is {{important}} for providing animals with valuable information about the qualities of food, such as nutritional or harmful nature. Mammals, including humans, can recognize at least five primary taste qualities: sweet, umami (savory), bitter, sour, and salty.

Little, however, {{is known about the}} mechanisms controlling the removal of elevated [Ca 2 +] c from the cytosol of taste receptor cells (TRCs) and how the disruption of these mechanisms affects taste perception. To investigate the molecular mechanism of Ca 2 + clearance in TRCs, we sought the molecules involved in [Ca 2 +]c regulation using a single-taste-cell transcriptome approach. We found that Serca 3, a member of the sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca 2 +-ATPase (SERCA) family that sequesters cytosolic Ca 2 + into endoplasmic reticulum, is exclusively expressed in sweet/umami/bitter TRCs, which rely on intracellular Ca 2 + release for signaling.

[...] Over 670 bitter-tasting compounds have been identified, on a bitter database, of which over 200 have been assigned to one or more specific receptors.

Taste receptors in the gastrointestinal tract might as well impact appetitive or aversive behavior and thus influence learning tasks and a close relation of neural taste processing and working memory networks seems plausible. Methods: In the present pilot study, we determined the effects of five taste qualities “bitter” (quinine), “sweet” (glucose), “sour” (citric acid), “salty” (NaCl) and “umami” (monosodium glutamate, MSG) on working memory processing using functional MRI and their effect on plasma insulin and glucose levels. On six separate occasions, subjects received one of the following test substances dissolved in 200 mL tap water via a nasogastric tube (to circumvent the oral cavity) : 1) 2 g citric acid corresponding to 52 mM, 2) 2 g NaCl; 171 mM, 3) 0. 017 g quinine; 0. 26 mM, 4) 1 g monosodium glutamate; 30 mM, 5) 25 g glucose; 694 mM and 6) 200 mL tap water (placebo). Results: The taste qualities “bitter” and “umami” significantly altered brain activation patterns in the primary gustatory cortex as well as in subcortical structures, previously reported to be involved in emotional learning and memory.
