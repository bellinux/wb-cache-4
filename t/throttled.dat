5|$|Each Space Shuttle {{had three}} RS-25 engines, {{installed}} in the aft structure of the Space Shuttle orbiter in the Orbiter Processing Facility prior to the orbiter being transferred to the Vehicle Assembly Building. If necessary the engines could be changed on the pad. The engines, drawing propellant from the Space Shuttle external tank (ET) via the orbiter's main propulsion system (MPS), were ignited at T−6.6 seconds prior to liftoff (with each ignition staggered by 120ms), which allowed their performance to be checked prior to ignition of the Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Boosters (SRBs), which committed the shuttle to the launch. At launch, the engines would be operating at 100% RPL, throttling up to 104.5% immediately following liftoff. The engines would maintain this power level until around T+40 seconds, {{where they would be}} <b>throttled</b> back to around 70% to reduce aerodynamic loads on the shuttle stack as it passed through the region of maximum dynamic pressure, or max Q. The engines would then be <b>throttled</b> back up until around T+8 minutes, at which point they would be gradually <b>throttled</b> back down to 67% to prevent the stack exceeding 3g of acceleration as it became progressively lighter due to propellant consumption. The engines were then shut down, a procedure known as main engine cutoff (MECO), at around T+8.5 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Each 22-minute episode takes {{approximately}} {{a year to}} complete; three to four episodes are produced simultaneously. Storyboard artists depict scenes using SketchBook Pro. Adapting these boards to limited animation, studio DHX Media handles the designs, poses and key frames of movement for each character appearing in a given scene for an episode, as well as background art. DHX hands these assets to a separate studio, where the remaining animation is finished using Adobe Flash. The speed of production is <b>throttled</b> slightly by Blythe having two unique outfits per episode, according to director Joel Dickie. Supervising director Dallas Parker similarly explained that the variety of assets created for each episode challenged the process of Flash animation in reusing movements.|$|E

5000|$|On many cars, the {{accelerator}} pedal motion is communicated via the <b>throttle</b> cable, {{to activate the}} <b>throttle</b> linkages, which move the <b>throttle</b> plate. In cars with electronic <b>throttle</b> control (also known as [...] "drive-by-wire"), an electric motor controls the <b>throttle</b> linkages and {{the accelerator}} pedal connects not to the <b>throttle</b> body, but to a sensor, which sends the pedal position to the Engine Control Unit (ECU). The ECU determines the <b>throttle</b> opening based on accelerator pedal position and inputs from other engine sensors.|$|R
50|$|As the <b>throttle</b> {{is opened}} up {{slightly}} from the fully closed position, the <b>throttle</b> plate uncovers additional fuel delivery holes behind the <b>throttle</b> plate {{where there is a}} low pressure area created by the <b>throttle</b> plate/Valve blocking air flow; these allow more fuel to flow as well as compensating for the reduced vacuum that occurs when the <b>throttle</b> is opened, thus smoothing the transition to metering fuel flow through the regular open <b>throttle</b> circuit.|$|R
50|$|Usually, the <b>throttle</b> valve is {{controlled}} with a <b>throttle</b> pedal or lever via a direct mechanical linkage. In vehicles with electronic <b>throttle</b> control, the manual <b>throttle</b> control sends {{a signal to}} the Engine Control Unit (ECU), which then directly controls the position of the <b>throttle</b> valve. This means that the operator does not have direct control over the <b>throttle</b> valve; the ECU can finely control the valve in order to reduce emissions or maximize performance.|$|R

25|$|Virgin Broadband {{employs a}} form of {{bandwidth}} throttling whereby customer bandwidth is reduced temporarily after a threshold is reached during peak periods. The company has experimented with and revised all parameters involved in the throttling, such as threshold size, peak period definitions, throttling percentage and duration. Separate thresholds are applied to upstream and downstream, and thresholds vary between packages. From 28 February 2014, Virgin Media announced that they were scrapping traffic management for downstream traffic on 30Mb or higher packages, which was welcomed by many customers. As a result of this, 30Mb or higher packages are only <b>throttled</b> on the upstream, where as 20Mb or below packages are <b>throttled</b> on both the upstream and the downstream.|$|E
25|$|Due to a {{more mature}} {{manufacturing}} process, the CPUs in the second-generation MacBook Air perform better under load, as the first generation chips ran at a higher temperature—the processor needed to be <b>throttled</b> to avoid overheating and this further degraded performance.|$|E

50|$|When {{the driver}} presses on the {{accelerator}} pedal, the <b>throttle</b> plate rotates within the <b>throttle</b> body, opening the <b>throttle</b> passage to allow more air into the intake manifold. Usually an airflow sensor measures this change and communicates with the ECU. The ECU then increases the amount of fuel {{being sent to the}} fuel injectors in order to obtain the desired air-fuel ratio. Often a <b>throttle</b> position sensor (TPS) is connected to the shaft of the <b>throttle</b> plate to provide the ECU with information on whether the <b>throttle</b> is in the idle position, wide-open <b>throttle</b> (WOT) position, or somewhere in between these extremes.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>throttle</b> {{position}} sensor (TPS) is a sensor {{used to monitor}} the <b>throttle</b> position of a vehicle. The sensor is usually located on the butterfly spindle/shaft {{so that it can}} directly monitor the position of the <b>throttle.</b> More advanced forms of the sensor are also used, for example an extra closed <b>throttle</b> {{position sensor}} (CTPS) may be employed to indicate that the <b>throttle</b> is completely closed. Some engine control units (ECUs) also control the <b>throttle</b> position electronic <b>throttle</b> control (ETC) or [...] "drive by wire" [...] systems and if that is done the position sensor is used in a feedback loop to enable that control.|$|R
25|$|Spark offers {{asymmetric}} {{digital subscriber}} line (ADSL), very-high-bit-rate {{digital subscriber line}} (VDSL) and fibre to the premises (FTTP) fixed-line broadband. FTTP customers may choose either 30/10Mbit/s, 100/20 Mbit/s, 200/20 Mbit/s, 200/200 Mbit/s, or in selected areas, 1000/500Mbit/s maximum speed (down/up); ADSL and VDSL customers' download speeds are only limited to what their line and equipment can handle, while upload speeds are limited to 1Mbit/s and 10Mbit/s respectively. All three offer both data-capped and unlimited plans. Data-capped customers may choose either to pay extra per GB (or part thereof) over their data cap, or have their speed <b>throttled</b> back to 128kbit/s at no charge once they exceed the cap. Unlimited plans have no data caps, but a customer's download and upload speeds may be <b>throttled</b> during times of network congestion.|$|E
25|$|A {{limitation}} of the flash distiller is its sensitivity to seawater inlet temperature, as this affects {{the efficiency of the}} condenser coils. In tropical waters, the distiller flowrate must be <b>throttled</b> to maintain effective condensation. As these systems are more modern, they are generally fitted with an electric salinometer and some degree of automatic control.|$|E

25|$|In {{the last}} two decades of the 19th century, the quality of Alger's books deteriorated, and his boys' works became nothing more than reruns of the plots and themes of his past. The times had changed, boys {{expected}} more, and a streak of violence entered Alger's work. In The Young Bank Messenger, for example, a woman is <b>throttled</b> and threatened with death—an episode that would never have occurred in his earlier work.|$|E
25|$|As the {{remaining}} propellant decreases, rocket vehicles become lighter and their acceleration tends to increase until the propellant is exhausted. This means {{that much of}} the speed change occurs {{towards the end of the}} burn when the vehicle is much lighter. However, the thrust can be <b>throttled</b> to offset or vary this if needed. Discontinuities in acceleration also occur when stages burn out, often starting at a lower acceleration with each new stage firing.|$|E
25|$|Example of {{throttling}} {{in action}} (based on May 2009 scheme): Customer has an L (10 Mbit/s) package, {{which has a}} 3GB threshold during 10am-3pm and a 1.5 GB threshold between 4pm-9pm with a 75% throttle for five hours. Customer downloads over 3GB on Tuesday morning between 10am-3pm. The customer is then <b>throttled</b> to 2.5 Mbit/s {{for the next five}} hours from the time that they exceed the threshold, after which normal service is resumed.|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation on}} ignition characteristics with air-throttling in an ethylene-fueled scramjet under flight Ma 6. 5 conditions was conducted. The dynamic process of air-throttling ignition was explored systematically. The influences of <b>throttling</b> parameters, i. e., <b>throttling</b> mass rate and duration, were investigated. When the <b>throttling</b> mass rate was 45 % of the inflow mass rate, ambient ethylene could be ignited reliably. The delay time from ignition to <b>throttling</b> was about 45 – 55  ms. There was a threshold of <b>throttling</b> duration under a certain <b>throttling</b> mass rate. It was shorter than 100  ms when the <b>throttling</b> mass rate was 45 %. While a 45 % <b>throttling</b> mass rate {{would make the}} shock train propagate upstream to the isolator entry in about 10 – 15  ms, four lower <b>throttling</b> mass rates were tested, including 30 %, 25 %, 20 %, and 10 %. All of these <b>throttling</b> mass rates could ignite ethylene. However, combustion performances varied with them. A higher <b>throttling</b> mass rate made more ethylene combust and produced higher wall pressure. Through these experiments, {{some aspects of the}} relationships between ignition, flame stabilization, combustion efficiency, and air-throttling parameters were brought to light. These results could also be a benchmark for CFD validation...|$|R

40|$|A new <b>throttling</b> system far SI engines is examined. The SMD of {{the fuel}} {{droplets}} in the induction system is measured to evaluate {{the performance of the}} new device with respect to the conventional <b>throttle</b> plate arrangement. The measurements are conducted at steady now conditions. A forward angular scattering technique with a He-Ne laser beam is used for droplet size measurement. The experiments are carried out with different mixture strength, stream velocity and <b>throttle</b> positions. It is observed that A/F ratio has no effect on SMD. However, stream velocity and <b>throttle</b> position have a significant influence on SMD. The new <b>throttling</b> method is found to be more effective in reducing the SMD, particularly at low <b>throttle</b> opening and high stream velocity compared to the conventional <b>throttle</b> plate...|$|R

25|$|The main {{circulating}} pumps {{have the capacity}} of 5,500–12,000m³/h and are powered by 6kV electric motors. The normal coolant flow is 8000m³/h per pump; this is <b>throttled</b> down by control valves to 6000–7000m³/h when the reactor power is below 500MWt. Each pump has a flow control valve and a backflow preventing check valve on the outlet, and shutoff valves on both inlet and outlet. Each of the pressure channels in the core has its own flow control valve so that the temperature distribution in the reactor core can be optimized. Each channel has a ball type flow meter.|$|E

In this study, the three-dimensional (3 D) {{model of the}} secondary <b>throttling</b> pipeline was constructed according to the actual structure and parameters. Adopting the finite element method (FEM) for flow field calculation, the secondary and ordinary <b>throttling</b> pipelines have been calculated respectively under different working conditions, and the distribution maps of velocity and pressure fields in the pipelines have been constructed. The analyzed results demonstrate {{the applicability of the}} calculating model. It has also been shown that the cavitation erosion resistance of the secondary <b>throttling</b> pipeline is better than that of the ordinary <b>throttling</b> pipeline. Cavitations first appear at the entrance of <b>throttling</b> pipelines, and as the pressure difference between the two ends increases, the cavitations appears inwards. This result is significant for choosing and designing the <b>throttling</b> pipelines...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} air <b>throttling</b> on flame {{stabilization}} of an ethylene fueled scramjet combustor was investigated by numerical simulation and experiments in this paper. The results were obtained under the inflow condition with Mach number of 2. 0, total temperature of 900 [*]K, total pressure of 0. 8 [*]MPa, and total equivalence ratio of 0. 5. The shock train generated by air <b>throttling</b> {{had a big}} effect on the flow structure of the scramjet combustor. Compared with the combustor without air <b>throttling,</b> the flow field with air <b>throttling</b> had a lower velocity and higher pressure, temperature, and vortices intensity. Air <b>throttling</b> was {{an effective way to}} achieve flame stabilization; the combustion in the combustor without air <b>throttling</b> was nearly blowout. In the experiment, the combustion was nearly blowout with air <b>throttling</b> location of 745 [*]mm, and the fuel/air mixture in the combustor with air <b>throttling</b> location of 875 [*]mm was burned intensively. It was important to choose the location and time sequence of air <b>throttling</b> for fuel ignition and flame stabilization.
