5|$|Like the {{components}} of other intermediate filaments, the lamin monomer contains an alpha-helical domain used by two monomers <b>to</b> <b>coil</b> around each other, forming a dimer structure called a coiled coil. Two of these dimer structures then join side by side, in an antiparallel arrangement, to form a tetramer called a protofilament. Eight of these protofilaments form a lateral arrangement that is twisted to form a ropelike filament. These filaments can be assembled or disassembled in a dynamic manner, meaning that changes in {{the length of the}} filament depend on the competing rates of filament addition and removal.|$|E
5|$|Lungless {{salamanders}} in {{the family}} Plethodontidae are terrestrial and lay {{a small number of}} unpigmented eggs in a cluster among damp leaf litter. Each egg has a large yolk sac and the larva feeds on this while it develops inside the egg, emerging fully formed as a juvenile salamander. The female salamander often broods the eggs. In the genus Ensatinas, the female has been observed <b>to</b> <b>coil</b> around them and press her throat area against them, effectively massaging them with a mucous secretion.|$|E

25|$|Packaging {{is cited}} as both an {{advantage}} and disadvantage of the transverse FRP leaf spring, as compared <b>to</b> <b>coil</b> springs, {{depending on the}} application. The FRP spring is typically set low in the suspension, resulting in a low center of gravity. It also allows manufactures to avoid tall spring mounts, thus resulting in a flatter load floor about the suspension. James Schefter reports that, as used on the C5 and later Corvettes, the use of OEM coilover damper springs would have forced the chassis engineers to either vertically raise the shock towers or move them inward. In the rear this would have reduced trunk space. In the front this would have interfered with engine packaging. The use of the leaf spring allowed the spring to be placed under the chassis, out of the way, while keeping {{the diameter of the}} shock-absorber assembly to that of just the damper, rather than damper and spring. However, in other applications, such as race car designs, the need to span the width of the vehicle resulted in significant design limitations. Coil and torsion springs present better packaging options for racing applications. FRP springs also have limited availability and selection as compared <b>to</b> <b>coil</b> springs. Higher cost has also been cited as a disadvantage, when comparing FRP springs <b>to</b> <b>coil</b> springs on production road cars.|$|E
25|$|Only {{the early}} fully {{imported}} 200B sedans and coupes retained the {{independent rear suspension}} from the 180B, locally assembled 200B sedans instead switched <b>to</b> <b>coil</b> springs with a live axle, while the wagon (imported from Japan) had a live axle in the rear with leaf springs. Seen as a giant step backwards, {{the reason for the}} change was certainly not a cost-cutting measure, but simply the need for Nissan to reach an 85% local content quota that the then Federal Government demanded of Australian car manufacturers. However, in practice the live rear axle, being an Australian development, proved to actually benefit the car's overall handling dynamics.|$|E
25|$|This period saw Land Rover {{market the}} utility Land Rover {{as a private}} {{recreational}} vehicle. While the basic pick-up, 4x4 and van versions were still working vehicles, the County 4x4s were sold as multi-purpose family vehicles, featuring improved interior trim and more comfortable seats. This change was reflected in Land Rover starting what had long been common practice in the car industry— detail changes and improvements to the County model {{from year to year}} in order to attract new buyers and to encourage existing owners to trade in for a new vehicle. These changes included different exterior styling graphics and colour options, and the introduction of new options, such as radio-cassette players, Rostyle wheels, headlamp wash and wipe systems, as well as accessories such as surfboard carriers and bike racks. The switch from leaf spring <b>to</b> <b>coil</b> spring suspension was {{a key part of the}} new model's success. It offered improved off-road ability, load capacity, handling, and ride comfort.|$|E

25|$|Henry {{excelled at}} his studies (so much so, {{that he would}} often help his {{teachers}} teach science) and in 1826 was appointed Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy at The Albany Academy by Principal T. Romeyn Beck. Some of his most important research was conducted in this new position. His curiosity about terrestrial magnetism led him to experiment with magnetism in general. He was the first <b>to</b> <b>coil</b> insulated wire tightly around an iron core {{in order to make}} a more powerful electromagnet, improving on William Sturgeon's electromagnet which used loosely coiled uninsulated wire. Using this technique, he built the strongest electromagnet at the time for Yale. He also showed that, when making an electromagnet using just two electrodes attached to a battery, it is best to wind several coils of wire in parallel, but when using a set-up with multiple batteries, there should be only one single long coil. The latter made the telegraph feasible. Because of his early experiments in electromagnetism some historians credit Henry with discoveries pre-dating Faraday and Hertz, however, Henry is not credited due to not publishing his work.|$|E
500|$|Lobatus gigas is gonochoristic, {{which means}} each {{individual}} snail is either distinctly male or distinctly female. Females are usually larger than males in natural populations, with both sexes existing in similar proportion. After internal fertilization, the females lay eggs in gelatinous strings, {{which can be}} as long as [...] These are layered on patches of bare sand or seagrass. The sticky surface of these long egg strings allows them <b>to</b> <b>coil</b> and agglutinate, mixing with the surrounding sand to form compact egg masses, the shape of which {{is defined by the}} anterior portion of the outer lip of the female's shell while they are layered. Each one of the egg masses may have been fertilized by multiple males. The number of eggs per egg mass varies greatly depending on environmental conditions such as food availability and temperature. Commonly, females produce 8–9 egg masses per season, each containing 180,000–460,000 eggs, but numbers can be as high as 750,000 eggs. L.gigas females may spawn multiple times during the reproductive season, which lasts from March to October, with activity peaks occurring from July to September.|$|E

40|$|Inductive power {{transfer}} (IPT) is {{an application of}} electromagnetic induction principle. Since electromagnetic induction phenomena is directly proportional to the operating frequency, so as we increase the operating frequency, amount of energy transfer from one <b>coil</b> <b>to</b> another <b>coil</b> will also increase. As our power supply frequency is 50 Hz so at this frequency, amount of energy transfer from one <b>coil</b> <b>to</b> another <b>coil</b> will be very less. In this thesis it is shown that, to transfer maximum amount of energy from one <b>coil</b> <b>to</b> another <b>coil,</b> {{it is necessary to}} use IPT at high frequency. At high frequency skin effect is more pronounced but there is a resonant frequency where overall efficiency is more in spite skin effect. To increase the power factor of IPT circuit compensated capacitor has used.

A small number of genetic loci have been reported to be juxtaposed <b>to</b> <b>coiled</b> bodies, including the genes for U 1 and U 2 small nuclear RNA as well as the two major histone gene clusters.

The most commonly observed of the coiled coils, the parallel dimeric, is yet to be fully characterized for this structural class in general. Nonetheless, strict rules have emerged for the necessity of specific types of amino acids at specific positions. In this chapter, we discuss this system in light of existing coiled coil structures and in applying rules <b>to</b> <b>coiled</b> <b>coils</b> that are <b>to</b> be designed or optimized. Understanding and expanding on these rules is crucial in using these motifs, which play key roles in virtually every cellular process, to act as drug-delivery agents by sequestering other proteins that are not behaving natively or that have been upregulated (for example, by binding <b>to</b> <b>coiled</b> coil domains implicated in oncogenesis). The roles of the a and d “hydrophobic” core positions and the e and g “electrostatic” edge positions in directing oligomerization and pairing specificity are discussed.
