The tour {{features}} 28 shows and ended on June 1, 2013. The tour was in promotion of My Name Is My Name and Fabolous' sixth studio album Loso's Way 2: Rise to Power. On December 9, 2013, {{it was revealed}} that Pusha T would be co-headlining the 2 Good 2 Be T.R.U.

The tour will also feature August Alsina and Cap1 as opening acts.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Life</b> <b>is</b> {{difficult}} to follow and extremely vague on any facts. Typically the author takes facts and traditions known {{to him and}} transfers them to the saint himself. Thus there was in the twelfth century a holy relic at Llanbadarn {{believed to have been}} Padarn's staff, Cyrwen, which could well be the origin of the place name Llangorwen. The writer obviously knew very little indeed about Padarn, except that he was seen as a contemporary of David and Teilo, who certainly lived during the sixth century.|$|E
5|$|The Life of Saint Edward {{claims that}} while Godwin was in exile Robert {{tried to persuade}} King Edward to divorce Edith, Godwin's daughter, but Edward refused and instead she {{was sent to a}} nunnery. However, <b>the</b> <b>Life</b> <b>is</b> a hagiography, written soon after Edward's death to show Edward as a saint. Thus it {{stresses}} that Edward voluntarily remained celibate, something unlikely to have been true and not corroborated by any other source. Modern historians have felt it more likely that Edward, at Robert's urging, wished to divorce Edith and remarry in order to have children to succeed him on the English throne, although it is possible that he merely wished to be rid of her, without necessarily wanting a divorce.|$|E

5|$|Pope Gregory VII canonised Ælfheah in 1078, with a feast day of 19April. Lanfranc, {{the first}} post-Conquest archbishop, was dubious {{about some of}} the saints venerated at Canterbury. He was persuaded of Ælfheah's sanctity, but Ælfheah and Augustine of Canterbury were the only pre-conquest Anglo-Saxon archbishops kept on Canterbury's {{calendar}} of saints. Ælfheah's shrine, which had become neglected, was rebuilt and expanded in the early 12th century under Anselm of Canterbury, who was instrumental in retaining Ælfheah's name in the church calendar. After the 1174 fire in Canterbury Cathedral, Ælfheah's remains together with those of Dunstan were placed around the high altar, at which Thomas Becket is said to have commended his life into Ælfheah's care shortly before his martyrdom during the Becket controversy. The new shrine was sealed in lead, and was north of the high altar, sharing the honour with Dunstan's shrine, which was located south of the high altar. A Life of Saint Ælfheah in prose and verse was written by a Canterbury monk named Osbern, at Lanfranc's request. The prose version has survived, but <b>the</b> <b>Life</b> <b>is</b> very much a hagiography: many of the stories it contains have obvious Biblical parallels, making them suspect as a historical record.|$|E

500|$|The early {{manuscript}} of the Life {{does not appear}} to have been widely known in medieval times. Only one copy is known to have survived into modern times. It is known as Cotton MS Otho A xii, and was part of the Cotton library. It was written about 1000 and was destroyed in a fire in 1731. The lack of distribution may be because Asser had not finished the manuscript and so did not have it copied. However, the material in <b>the</b> <b>Life</b> <b>is</b> recognizable in other works. There is some evidence from early writers of access to versions of Asser's work, as follows: ...|$|E

500|$|The first single, [...] "No Place to Hide", {{spawned a}} Grammy {{nomination}} for Best Metal Performance. [...] "A.D.I.D.A.S." [...] was released {{as the second}} single on March 4, 1997. It became the band's first charting single on Billboard, peaking at number thirteen on the Bubbling Under Hot 100 chart. The third single, [...] "Good God", was released on July 14, 1997. The band gained more popularity after co-headlining the Lollapalooza music festival in 1997 with Tool. However, Korn was forced to stop touring after Shaffer was diagnosed with viral meningitis. A promotional disc was released in 1997 to promote both the band and <b>the</b> <b>Life</b> <b>Is</b> Peachy Tour featuring Incubus and The Urge, and included three live tracks.|$|E
500|$|Antoinist beliefs combine some {{elements}} of Catholicism, reincarnation, and healing. In the Antoinist views, the man must reach consciousness by {{getting rid of the}} illusion of matter produced by his intelligence—the source of evil and suffering. The purpose of <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> to release oneself from the cycle of reincarnation through a moral progression aided by [...] "fluids"—all human actions, acquired by silent prayer and the harm caused by diseases and enemies. As freedom of conscience and free will are considered very important in Antoinist creed, the religion does not practice proselytism and is not exclusive. It does not provide any prescription on social issues. Although focused on healing, Antoinism does not interfere with the medical field, and does not discourage the resort to traditional medicine.|$|E
500|$|The basic {{gameplay}} {{system of}} Guilty Gear Isuka {{is like the}} other games in the series. The game uses a four attack button configuration that consists of punch, kick, slash, and high slash. Unlike previous games, it features a [...] "turn" [...] button, since a character does not automatically turn around if its opponent moves {{to the other side}} of the screen. Each character (or team) starts a fight with at least a [...] "soul"; when a character life bar is emptied, its life is filled while the player lost a soul. If <b>the</b> <b>life</b> <b>is</b> depleted when the player has no souls, it is defeated. It also features previous installments features like the tension gauge, which allows the player to perform super moves, and the burst gauge, which allows the player to break combinations and super moves.|$|E

500|$|Asser drew on {{a variety}} of texts to write his Life. The style {{is similar to that of}} two biographies of Louis the Pious: Vita Hludovici Imperatoris, written c. 840 by an unknown author usually called [...] "the Astronomer", and Vita Hludowici Imperatoris by Thegan of Trier. It is {{possible}} that Asser may have known these works. He also knew Bede's Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum; the Historia Brittonum, a Welsh source; the Life of Alcuin; and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle. It is also clear from the text that Asser was familiar with Virgil's Aeneid, Caelius Sedulius's Carmen Paschale, Aldhelm's De Virginitate, and Einhard's Vita Karoli Magni ("Life of Charlemagne"). He quotes from Gregory the Great's Regula Pastoralis, a work he and Alfred subsequently collaborated in translating, and from Augustine of Hippo's Enchiridion. About half of <b>the</b> <b>Life</b> <b>is</b> little more than a translation of part of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle for the years 851–887, though Asser adds personal opinions and interpolates information about Alfred's life. Asser also adds material relating to the years after 887 and general opinions about Alfred's character and reign.|$|E
