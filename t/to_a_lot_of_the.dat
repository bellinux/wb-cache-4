25|$|The club's {{board of}} {{directors}} has nine members, with each director serving a three-year term before their position is put up for re-election at an AGM. Only one-third of the board is contested at each AGM due to the rolling structure {{of the terms of}} the directors. This structure safeguards the entire board from being ousted at a single AGM and has made North Melbourne immune <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> in-house fighting witnessed at other AFL football clubs. The board governs the club as well as selecting a chairman to head the club through a majority vote of directors.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of the events are categorized as seemingly peaceful by many students, stating that they consist mainly of students standing around, chanting and singing. There is also still debate among UMass students {{as to whether or}} not the term “riot” applies <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> occurrences since they seldom involve violence or aggressive behavior from the vast {{majority of}} students present. Nevertheless, each event is met with police interference due to a fear of the unsafe environments that large unattended crowds could create. In the past there has been friction between members of the student body and the UMass Police Department around their methods of crowd control; students have been displeased with what they see as unnecessary force.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the serial}} was filmed on {{location}} in Aldbourne, Wiltshire. The location shoot was awarded two weeks' filming, {{more than double the}} usual amount at the time, leading <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finished story being set outside, rather than in studio. Membury airfield in Berkshire and Bridge Farm, Ramsbury, were also used briefly as locations. Filming began on 19 April 1971 and saw pleasant, sunny weather for the first week, leading to sudden overnight snow in the second week - causing filming to be delayed. Some episode one scenes were filmed at night - a rarity for the show, although some of these scenes were filmed during daylight with a dark filter put over the camera lens. Other dark indoor scenes were filmed in a disused aircraft hangar at Bridge Farm, Ramsbury. Filming for the serial caused great excitement in Aldbourne, {{with a lot of the}} village residents appearing as extras, as well as the Headington Quarry Morris dancers performing a routine in episode four.|$|E

However, this {{proved to be}} his last appearance for the club during the 2008–09 season. Despite this, O'Keefe was nominated for the League One Apprentice of the Year award, eventually losing out to Carlisle United defender Tom Aldred. The following season, O'Keefe featured more regularly for the first team, making nine appearances in total despite missing two months of the season due to a hernia injury sustained in a match against Millwall on 26 January 2010. Following his departure from Roots Hall, the club's head of youth director Ricky Duncan praised O'Keefe's attitude, stating [...] "Stuart was always very driven and single-minded and he was different <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other lads in that regard." ...|$|E
500|$|Although he {{required}} Robinson to {{keep the}} arrangement a secret for the time being, Rickey committed to formally signing Robinson before November 1, 1945. On October 23, it was publicly announced that Robinson would be assigned to the Royals for the 1946 season. On the same day, {{with representatives of the}} Royals and Dodgers present, Robinson formally signed his contract with the Royals. In what was later referred to as [...] "The Noble Experiment", Robinson was the first black baseball player in the International League since the 1880s. He was not necessarily {{the best player in the}} Negro leagues, and black talents Satchel Paige and Josh Gibson were upset when Robinson was selected first. Larry Doby, who broke the color line in the American League the same year as Robinson, said, [...] "One of the things that was disappointing and disheartening <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> black players at the time was that Jack was not the best player. The best was Josh Gibson. I think that's one of the reasons why Josh died so early – he was heartbroken." ...|$|E
500|$|Bilinda Butcher's vocals {{have been}} {{referred}} to as a trademark of My Bloody Valentine's sound, alongside Shields' guitar techniques. On a number of occasions during the recording of Isn't Anything and Loveless, Butcher was awoken and recorded vocals, which she said [...] "influenced [...] sound" [...] by making them [...] "more dreamy and sleepy". The vocals in most My Bloody Valentine's recordings are low in the mix as Shields intended for the vocals to be used as an instrument. Critics have often described an androgynous sound to the band's vocals. My Bloody Valentine's lyrics are mostly written by Shields. However, Butcher wrote a third of the lyrics on both Isn't Anything and Loveless, but has referred <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lyrics as [...] "plain nonsense." [...] According to Butcher, she [...] "didn't have a plan and never thought about lyrics {{until it was time to}} write them. I just used whatever was in my head for the moment." [...] Some of her lyrics were written as a result of attempting to interpret rough versions of songs Shields had recorded. Butcher has said: [...] "He [...] never sang any words on the cassettes I got but I tried to make his sounds into words." [...] Butcher and Shields would often spend eight to ten hours a night writing lyrics, even though few changes actually resulted, as Shields believed [...] "there's nothing worse than bad lyrics." [...] Spin writer Simon Reynolds has noted that the band's lyrics often contain sexual themes, which are [...] "a paradoxical blend of force and tenderness".|$|E

500|$|Considered nu metal, {{the album}} {{features}} a more prominent hip hop influence than the band's self-titled debut, with James [...] "Munky" [...] Shaffer recalling [...] "We were listening <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> hip hop, I was probably listening <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> Mr. Bungle, hip hop like early Outkast and The Pharcyde, Sepultura records, and Rage Against the Machine, just <b>to</b> name <b>a</b> few." ...|$|R
500|$|Stipe {{later called}} chorus lyrics of [...] "Sitting Still" [...] from R.E.M. debut album, Murmur, [...] "nonsense", {{saying in a}} 1994 online chat, [...] "You all know there aren't words, per se, <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early stuff. I can't even {{remember}} them." [...] In truth, Stipe carefully crafted the lyrics to many early R.E.M. songs. Stipe explained in 1984 that when he started writing lyrics they were like [...] "simple pictures", but after a year he grew tired of the approach and [...] "started experimenting with lyrics that didn't make exact linear sense, and it's just gone from there." [...] In the mid-1980s, as Stipe's pronunciation while singing became clearer, the band decided that its lyrics should convey ideas on a more literal level. Mills explained, [...] "After you've made three records and you've written several songs and they've gotten better and better lyrically the next step {{would be to have}} somebody question you and say, are you saying anything? And Michael had the confidence at that point to say yes [...] [...] [...]" [...] Songs like [...] "Cuyahoga" [...] and [...] "Fall on Me" [...] on Lifes Rich Pageant dealt with such concerns as pollution. Stipe incorporated more politically oriented concerns into his lyrics on Document and Green. [...] "Our political activism and the content of the songs was just a reaction to where we were, and what we were surrounded by, which was just abject horror," [...] Stipe said later. [...] "In 1987 and '88 {{there was nothing to do}} but be active." [...] Stipe has since explored other lyrical topics. Automatic for the People dealt with [...] "mortality and dying. Pretty turgid stuff", according to Stipe, while Monster critiqued love and mass culture.|$|E
500|$|Cobain {{stated in}} a 1993 {{interview}} with The Observer that [...] "for {{the most part}} 's very impersonal". [...] The songwriter also told Q that year that the abundance of infant and childbirth imagery on the album and his newfound fatherhood were coincidental. [...] However, Azerrad argued {{that much of the}} album contains personal themes, noting that Grohl held a similar view. [...] Grohl said, [...] "A lot of {{what he has to say}} is related <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> shit he's gone through. [...] And it's not so much teen angst anymore. [...] It's a whole different ball game: rock star angst." [...] Cobain downplayed recent events ("I really haven't had that exciting a life") and told Azerrad that he did not want to write a track that explicitly expressed his anger at the media, but the author countered that [...] "Rape Me" [...] seemed to deal with that very issue. [...] While Cobain said the song was written long before his troubles with drug addiction became public, he agreed that the song could be viewed in that light. [...] "Serve The Servants" [...] contains comments about Cobain's life, both as a child and as an adult. [...] The opening lines [...] "Teenage angst has paid off well/Now I'm bored and old" [...] were a reference to Cobain's state of mind in the wake of Nirvana's success. [...] Cobain dismissed the media attention given to the effect his parents' divorce had on his life with the line [...] "That legendary divorce is such a bore" [...] from the chorus, and directly addressed his father with the lines [...] "I tried hard to have a father/But instead I had a dad/I just want you to know that I don't hate you anymore/There is nothing I could say that I haven't thought before". [...] Cobain said he wanted his father to know he did not hate him, but had no desire to talk to him.|$|E

2500|$|The Winter of Mixed Drinks {{was written}} over seven weeks, {{in the coastal}} town of Crail, Fife, {{following}} heavy touring {{in support of the}} band's second album, The Midnight Organ Fight. Drummer Grant Hutchison states that [...] "the location had a big impact on the songs. There's definitely a nautical theme <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tracks and a feeling of testing yourself to the limit which the sea plays a big part in. Scott [...] had a daily routine of walking along the beach until an idea came into his head and he would then turn round and develop it on the way home."
