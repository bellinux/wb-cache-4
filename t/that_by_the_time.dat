5|$|As {{with many}} types Asian and African megafauna, the Javan rhino was relentlessly hunted by trophy and big-game hunters for decades {{following}} {{the arrival of}} Europeans in its range. The rhinos being easy targets, this was as severe a contributor to its decline as was poaching for its horns. Such was the toll of big-game hunting <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> the rhino's plight was made known to the world, only the Javan and the (then unknown) Vietnamese populations remained.|$|E
5|$|During the 26th Dynasty (c. 685-525 BC) Userkaf's temple {{had become}} a burial ground: a large shaft tomb was dug in its midst thus {{rendering}} modern reconstruction of its layout difficult.

5|$|When Ohno was 12, {{he won the}} Washington state {{championship}} in the breaststroke but preferred inline speed skating over swimming.

5|$|A {{secondary}} theme which {{drives the}} contest for the champion's portion is the rivalry between the royal provinces of Connacht and Ulster, {{resolved in the}} contest of the two heroes Cet Mac Mágach and Conall Cernach. The presentation of this rivalry is coloured by the author's peculiar Leinster viewpoint. He turns both provinces to ridicule by the cunning of Mac Da Thó, King of Leinster; in particular, the author's political sympathies favour Connacht and remain hostile to Ulster to the end. To the heroes assembled, Mac Da Thó boasts that all the food provided for the feast is a mere trifle for the Leinstermen. It is tempting {{to conclude that the}} inspiration of the story is the claim of Leinster to supersede both Ulster and Connacht. However, it is apparent <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> of the tale's composition, even the story-teller does not take the political issues very seriously, using the theme instead as a vehicle for a good story.|$|E
5|$|After {{separating}} from Leissègues on 15 December, Willaumez sailed south, capturing {{a number}} of vessels from a British troop convoy and sending the prizes, with the frigate Volontaire, to Tenerife. Willaumez's intention was to raid the China Fleet, a large convoy of valuable East Indiamen that sailed from the Far East to Britain every year. However, on 23 December he was pursued by Duckworth and driven far off course, so <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> he reached the Cape of Good Hope, where he planned to resupply his ships, {{it had already been}} captured by a British expeditionary force. Turning westwards, Willaumez raided shipping in the South Atlantic until April, when he anchored at Salvador in neutral Brazil. By early May, Willaumez was at sea again, stopping at Cayenne and then splitting his force to raid shipping in the Leeward Islands prior to reuniting at Fort-de-France on Martinique in June.|$|E

5|$|Anticipating {{that people}} {{would come to the}} area to indulge in the newly fashionable pastime of sea-bathing, an {{activity}} with perceived health benefits, Tregonwell built a series of villas on his land between 1816 and 1822, which he hoped to let out. The common belief that pine-scented air was good for lung conditions, and in particular tuberculosis, prompted Tregonwell and Tapps to plant hundreds of pine trees. These early attempts to promote the town as a health resort meant <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> Tregonwell had died in 1832, Bournemouth had grown into a small community with a scattering of houses, villas and cottages. The town would ultimately grow up around the scattered pines and tree-lined walk to the beach, later to become known as the Invalids' Walk.|$|E
5|$|As a result, a {{bill was}} {{proposed}} in the House of Commons that sought to punish the City of Edinburgh for the behaviour of its citizens by disenfranchising the city. Murray represented the City in both the House of Commons and the House of Lords, and eventually whittled down the bill so much <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> it was voted on, it simply proposed to fine the city and disqualify the Provost. In exchange for his work, the citizens of Edinburgh gave him the Freedom of the City and a diamond, which {{is still in the}} possession of his family. Murray's reputation continued to grow; in 1738, he was involved in 11 of the 16 cases heard in the House of Lords, and in 1739 and 1740 he acted as legal counsel in 30 cases there.|$|E
5|$|During World War II the {{battalion}} {{was sent to}} New Guinea in 1942 {{as part of the}} 30th Brigade to defend the territory against a Japanese attack. Subsequently, between July and August of that year the unit was heavily engaged in the defence of Port Moresby, fighting along the Kokoda Track. The 39th fought several desperate actions against the Japanese as they attempted to hold out until further reinforcements could be brought up from Port Moresby. They were also later involved in the fighting around Buna–Gona. Such was their involvement in the battle <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> they were withdrawn they could only muster 32 men and following its return to Australia, the unit was disbanded in early July 1943.|$|E
50|$|By early January, 1899, the regiment's {{headquarters}} {{was established}} at Morro Castle with Sigerfoos acting as battalion adjutant of the depot battalion.

5|$|Eguchi and Matsueda {{are noted}} for {{creating}} mainly jazzy and electronic tracks for the scores they have collaborated on; Eguchi is credited {{for most of}} the electronic music. The soundtrack to The Bouncer, of which Eguchi and Matsueda co-composed a lot of the pieces, featured among other genres rock, electronica, and jazz fusion. A professional pianist, Eguchi often utilizes the piano in his compositions. He has stated that {{most of the time he}} composes and arranges music is at his home studio, where his friends help out by recording acoustic instruments; if the quality of these recordings are not adequate, however, Eguchi replaces them at the company's studio. He has said <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> he is finished creating the music, he is only sleeping three to four hours a week.|$|E
5|$|Generalfeldmarschall Walter Model—commander of Army Group B—had {{moved his}} {{headquarters}} to Arnhem and was re-establishing defences {{in the area}} and co-ordinating the reorganisation of the scattered units so <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> the Allies launched Market Garden there would be several units opposing them. To the west of Arnhem was Kampfgruppe Von Tettau, a force equivalent to seven battalions made up of all manner of German units (including Das Heer, Luftwaffe, Kriegsmarine, rear echelon and Waffen-SS troops) under the command of General Hans von Tettau at Grebbeberg. This included the SS Non-commissioned officer school SS Unteroffizierschule Arnheim and the 16th SS Training Battalion under the command of SS Sturmbannführer Sepp Krafft whose unit would {{play a crucial role in}} the opening phases of the battle. Within Arnhem itself, the town garrison was under the command of Major-General Friedrich Kussin.|$|E
5|$|If tanks or a {{large number}} of troops were seen passing, they would radio the LRDG {{headquarters}} at Siwa immediately so <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> the enemy reached the front line, GHQ at Cairo would know they were coming. Once a patrol was relieved they would transmit details of all they had seen back to Siwa. The LRDG did not lose any men or vehicles when on the road watch, but they did have some close encounters. On 21 March 'R1' Patrol was surrounded by a convoy of 27 vehicles and about 200 men who stopped for the night between the watchers and their vehicles. While the road watch was ongoing, other patrols would be attacking targets along other stretches of the Tripoli to Benghazi road, by planting mines or attacking vehicles with machine gun fire. The road was kept under constant observation around the clock from 2 March to 21 July 1942.|$|E

The 1st Airlanding Brigade took part in Operation Ladbroke and the 1st Parachute Brigade in Operation Fustian. Both brigades suffered heavy casualties, so <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> Operation Slapstick was proposed, only the 2nd and 4th Parachute Brigades were up to strength. Slapstick was in part a deception operation to divert German forces from the main Allied landings and also an attempt to seize intact the Italian ports of Taranto, Bari and Brindisi.|$|E
5|$|Morales {{was born}} in the small rural village of Isallawi in Orinoca Canton, part of western Bolivia's Oruro Department, on 26 October 1959. One of seven {{children}} born to Dionisio Morales Choque and Maria Ayma, only he and two siblings, Esther and Hugo, survived past childhood. His mother almost died from a postpartum haemorrhage following his birth. Ethnically identifying {{as a member of the}} indigenous Aymara people, in keeping with Aymara custom, his father buried the placenta produced after his birth in a place specially chosen for the occasion. His childhood home was a traditional adobe house, and he grew up speaking the Aymara language, although later commentators would remark <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> he had become president he was no longer an entirely fluent speaker.|$|E
5|$|On February 7, 2006, a {{settlement}} was reached {{in which the}} trophy could be awarded to non-NHL teams should the league not operate for a season. The dispute lasted so long <b>that,</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> it was settled, the NHL had resumed operating for the 2005–06 season, and the Stanley Cup went unclaimed for the 2004–05 season. Furthermore, when another NHL lockout commenced in 2012 the Trustees stated that the 2006 agreement did not oblige them to award the Cup {{in the event of}} a lost season, and that they were likely to reject any non-NHL challenges for the Cup in the event the 2012–13 season were cancelled, which it was not.|$|E

5|$|On two issues, women's suffrage, and the {{prohibition}} of alcohol, where picking the wrong side would have damaged his presidential prospects in 1920, he prospered by taking nuanced positions. As senator-elect, he indicated {{that he could not}} support votes for women until Ohio did. Increased support for suffrage there and among Senate Republicans meant <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> Congress voted on the issue, Harding was a firm supporter. Harding, who drank, initially voted against banning alcohol. He voted for the Eighteenth Amendment, which imposed Prohibition, after successfully moving to modify it by placing a time limit on ratification, which was expected to kill it. Once it was ratified anyway, Harding voted to override Wilson's veto of the Volstead Bill, which implemented the amendment, assuring the support of the Anti-Saloon League.|$|E

5|$|The SSR Abkhazia was an {{ethnically diverse}} region. The {{demographics}} of Abkhazia shifted considerably {{in the decades}} following its annexation by Russia. Large numbers of ethnic Abkhaz had been deported {{in the late nineteenth}} century, with up to 100,000 expelled, mainly sent to the Ottoman Empire. The result was <b>that</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> the SSR Abkhazia was formed, ethnic Abkhaz comprised less than 30% of the population (55,918), which numbered 201,016 according to the 1926 Soviet census, the only census conducted during the existence of the SSR Abkhazia. The korenizatsiia policy implemented in this era, which was to promote minority groups within the USSR, saw the numbers of Abkhaz increase: between 1922 and 1926, ethnic Abkhaz grew by roughly 8%, and constituted about 27.8% of the population; in this same time-frame, the number of ethnic Georgians fell from 42% to 36% (67,494). Other major ethnic groups counted in the 1926 census were Armenians (25,677, or 12.7%), Greeks (14,045, or 7%), and Russians (12,553, or 6.2%).|$|E
