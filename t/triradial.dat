40|$|Genome {{integrity}} is maintained during DNA replication by coordination of various replisome-regulated processes. Although {{it is known}} that Timeless (Tim) is a replisome component that participates in replication checkpoint responses to genotoxic stress, its importance for genome maintenance during normal DNA synthesis has not been reported. Here we demonstrate that Tim reduction leads to genomic instability during unperturbed DNA replication, culminating in increased chromatid breaks and translocations (<b>triradials,</b> quadriradials, and fusions). Tim deficiency led to increased H 2 AX phosphorylation and Rad 51 and Rad 52 foci formation selectively during DNA synthesis and caused a 3 - 4 -fold increase in sister chromatid exchange. The sister chromatid exchange events stimulated by Tim reduction were largely mediated via a Brca 2 /Rad 51 -dependent mechanism and were additively increased by deletion of the Blm helicase. Therefore, Tim deficiency leads to an increased reliance on homologous recombination for proper continuation of DNA synthesis. Together, these results indicate a pivotal role for Tim in maintaining genome stability throughout normal DNA replication...|$|R
40|$|Third instar larvae of the Oregon R stock {{were treated}} for 25 or 30 min with vapour of methyl methanesulphonate (MMS). At various times after the {{treatment}} (4, 8 and 12 h), microscope specimens of the nerve ganglia were prepared. At {{all the times}} of fixation, only aberrations of a chromatid type were found, but with different frequencies in the two sexes. The females were about 3 times more sensitive than the males to MMS. An analysis {{of the distribution of}} the breaks between and within chromosomes showed that they were not localized at random but were clustered in the heterochromatic centromere regions of the X chromosome and the autosomes. The Y chromosome, although entirely heterochromatic, on the other hand, was highly resistant to MMS. However, this phenomenon had only a very weak effect upon the variation with sex of MMS-induced chromosome damage. Among the aberrations induced, although interchanges were normally present, neither intra-exchanges nor <b>triradials</b> were found. In the interchanges, there was a greater tendency for the homologous chromosomes to be involved, and these rejoined symmetrically. The above results are discussed in relation to data previously obtained with X-rays...|$|R
40|$|Regioisomers of pyrene and benzo[a]pyrene quinones {{were tested}} {{for their ability}} to induce {{structural}} and numerical aberrations and spindle disturbance in Chinese hamster epithelial liver (CHEL) cells in culture. All quinones tested were clastogenic. Pyrene- 1, 8 -quinone (P- 1, 8 -Q) and benzo[a]pyrene- 3, 6 -quinone (BP- 3, 6 -Q) induced strikingly high levels of <b>triradials.</b> In addition, dicentrics and ring chromosomes were very common in BP- 3, 6 -Q-treated cultures. Isomers of these compounds, pyrene- 1, 6 -quinone (P- 1, 6 -Q) and benzo[a]pyrene- 1, 6 -quinone (BP- 1, 6 -Q), induced unobtrusive patterns of chromosomal aberrations. We suspect that the P- 1, 8 -Q and BP- 3, 6 -Q moieties bound to the DNA were still reactive, and formed crosslinks and/or underwent redox cycling leading to high local concentrations of reactive oxygen species. In addition, P- 1, 8 -Q and BP- 3, 6 -Q induced c-mitoses, hyperdiploidies and polyploidies, in particular endoreduplications. These effects were not seen with the other two test compounds, or they were only detected at the highest concentrations used, which were strongly cytotoxic (c-mitoses with P- 1, 6 -Q, polyploidies with BP- 1, 6 -Q) ...|$|R

40|$|Multiple myeloma (MM) is a {{malignant}} plasma cell proliferation (chronic lymphoproliferative disorder). Phenotype / cell stem origin Phenotype of mature differentiated B-cell, {{but also with}} CD 56 expression, which origin is not found in normal plasma cell; CD 38 +, CD 40 +, CD 138 +. Etiology Differents factors like cytotoxic drugs, ionizing radiation or oncogenic viruses are suspected to induce decondensation of pericentric heterochromatin, which, in turn, favours the formation of <b>triradials,</b> giving rise to 1 q extra copies; such could be the case during evolution of multiple myeloma. Epidemiology Multiple myeloma’s annual incidence: 30 / 106; mean age: 62 yrs; rearrangements of chromosome 1 q {{are one of the}} most frequent structural abnormalitie in MM (16 - 26 % of abnormal cases), but always as a secondary change. Clinics Bone pain; susceptibility to infections; renal failure; neurologic dysfunctions. Pathology MM staging:- stage I: low tumour cell mass; normal Hb; low serum calcium; no bone lesion; low monoclonal Ig rate;- stage II: fitting neither stage I nor stage II;- stage III: high tumour cell mass; low Hb and/or high serum calcium and/or advanced lytic bone lesions and/or high monoclonal Ig rate.

40|$|Genomic {{instability}} is {{a characteristic}} of most cancers and it refers to an increased tendency of alterations in the genome during {{the life cycle of}} cells. The fidelity of DNA replication is highly ensured by different checkpoints; the activation of spindle checkpoints prevents cells from premature entry into mitosis, avoiding incorrect chromosome segregation and aneuploidy, a typical feature of many cancers. Mitostatin, a novel protein, endowed with tumor suppressor activity, has been reported to bind centrosomal proteins Odf 2 and ninein, and its depletion causes an alteration of the anchorage of microtubules to the centrosome. Since functional defects of centrosomes are associated to mitotic failure, Mitostatin may have a key role in guarding the fidelity of mitosis in cells. Here we show that the depletion of Mitostatin in cancer cells, synchronized by aphidicolin (G 1 /S) block and released into nocodazole-containing medium, leads to mitotic slippage and adaptation to the spindle checkpoint (SAC) {{in the presence of a}} spindle inhibitor. Concomitantly, Mitostatin depletion promotes the early degradation of Mad 2 and cyclin B 1. Since the activated spindle checkpoint delays cell exit from mitosis by preventing cyclin B 1 proteolysis, the cyclin B 1 early degradation leads to mitotic checkpoint escape and resulting chromosome instability. In this study, we report for the first time that the depletion of Mitostatin induces an increase of numerical and structural chromosomal aberrations compared to control cells. These aberrations include aneuploidy, the formation of <b>triradials</b> and broken chromosomes. Taken together, our observations suggest that Mitostatin plays a critical role in guarding the fidelity of mitosis, enabling the optimal activation of the spindle checkpoint (SAC). Thus, low levels of Mitostatin found in certain human tumors may contribute to cellular transformation by promoting genomic instability...|$|R

These were produced only at the energies of 69 MeV/n (34. 6 keV/ mu m), almost absent at the energy of either 58. 6 McV/n (46. 07 keV/mu m) or 19. 3 MeV/n (97 keV/mu m), nor were they found after low-LET X-rays. Mechanisms potentially responsible for their formation are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The results {{obtained}} {{in the treatment of}} seventeen cases of long established (more than six years) congenital dislocation of the hip are reported. They were followed up for one to five years after operation. The writers consider osteotomy to correct leg length discrepancy to be unnecessary. <b>Triradial</b> osteotomy of the pelvis ensures optimal epiphyseal coverage and permits moderate lengthening of the limb. In the writers' experience, osteochondrosis is not related to the type of osteotomy, nor to operations to produce leg lengthening; it can be avoided by the use of prolonged post-operative traction...|$|E
40|$|Medulloblastoma is an {{invasive}} embryonal tumor of the cerebellum with predominant neuronal differentiation. Although several genes {{have been}} implicated in medulloblasoma formation, such as Patched (Ptc 1) and the adenomatous polyposis coli gene (Apc), {{the majority of these}} tumors cannot be explained by mutations in these genes. The cellular origin as well as the genetic and molecular changes involved in the genesis and progression of human medulloblastomas remain largely unknown. Here we show that disruption of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP- 1) causes a high incidence (49 %) of aggressive brain tumors in p 53 null mice, with typical features of human cerebellar medulloblastomas. At as early as 8 weeks of age, lesions started on the outer surface of the cerebellum from remnant granule cell precursors of the developmental external germinal layer. Progression of these tumors is associated with the re-activation of the neuronal specific transcription factor Math 1, dysregulation of Shh/Ptc 1 signaling pathway, and chromosomal aberrations, including <b>triradial</b> and quadriradial chromosomes. The present study indicates that the loss of function of DNA double-strand break-sensing and repair molecules is an etiological factor {{in the evolution of the}} cerebellar medulloblastomas. These PARP- 1 /p 53 double null mice represent a novel model for the pathogenesis of human medulloblastomas...|$|E
40|$|The pentaradial {{organisation}} of echinoderms is postulated to {{have evolved}} {{as the result}} of the reorganisation of the internal U-shaped mesentery of the intestinal tract during inflation of the trunk of a pterobranch-like ancestor. Under this scenario, loops of the mesentery developed between five hydraulic bulges by three different mechanisms: (1) by the early formation of two additional loops resulting directly in five hydraulic bulges, (2) by the subsequent formation of two additional loops resulting in the formation of initially three and then five hydraulic bulges or (3) by the inflation of the body without formation of loops. Accordingly there are at least three main evolutionary pathways within the echinoderms. The anatomical structures, such as the ambulacral system or the skeletal capsule, which characterize the echinoderms, developed independently in both lineages. From all the three pathways various body structures can be derived matching those found in fossil and extant echinoderms. The eleutherozoans and the earliest pentaradial echinoderms most likely evolved from the direct-pentaradial pathway whereas triradiate echinoderms and those which show a pentaradial organisation superimposed on <b>triradial</b> symmetry, likely evolved along the indirect pathway. The asymmetric or bilateral symmetric echinoderms evolved from the third paythway. The most important morphological transformations leading to the directly and indirectly pentaradial echinoderms are discussed and described. Comment: 10 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|This text is {{a general}} {{description}} of a curettage of an aneurysmal bone cyst (ABC) in the acetabular-roof. Focus is on anatomic structures and muscle resection. Good pre‐operative imaging is needed which allows adequate pre‐operative planning. To expose the anterior and posterior columns both from both extra- as well as intrapelvically, many anatomic structures have to be identified. Normal structures and its localizations should be known to avoid nerve or vessels damage. Approaches to the acetabulum are very complex and demanding. Because each approach only gives access to a limited part of the acetabulum, preoperative planning {{and understanding of the}} anatomy is crucial for the success of the surgery. Therefore, preoperative radiological imaging including computerized tomography and MRI are instrumental. The anterior approach allows access to the anterior column and anterior lip of the acetabulum. The posterior approach allows access to the posterior column and posterior wall of the acetabulum. The ilioinguinal approach allows access to the medial part of the acetabulum and the anterior column. Because of the wide expansion of the ABC into the roof and posterior wall of the acetabulum with involvement of the anterior and posterior columns, we decide to use a iliofemoral approach with the option to extend it into a modified <b>triradial</b> approach. In addition, this approach allows us to control the ABC from the inside of the pelvis and offers the expansion to the quadrilateral wall in case of brake-through during surgery...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the Charles Bridge in Prague, which forms an {{important}} part of the changing topography of Prague as the seat of the Holy Roman Emperor. For this reason, the thesis considers first the role that the evolution of Prague's topography had on its early medieval bridges and the role of its first stone bridge in the life and the fabric of the city. The next part of this thesis examines the bridge and its tower in its chronological context – confirming Charles IV as the patron of the bridge, setting the date for the completion of its bridge tower, and supporting the role of Peter Parler in its execution. In this section, I also discuss the architecture of the bridge tower and especially its relationship with the contemporary works on Prague cathedral’s choir. Particular focus will be given to the bridge’s <b>triradial</b> net vault, the first of its kind in Bohemia. Iconographically, this thesis interprets the sculptural programme of the bridge tower in the context of royal and legal rituals of the city. I argue that the sculptural programme emphasizes the envisioned continuity of the Luxembourg dynasty in Bohemia and the Holy Roman Empire. This sculpted tableau of royal power acted as a powerful backdrop to royal processions — most notably the pre-coronation procession — as a part of a series of genealogical stations laid out across the city. In the day to day life of Prague, the Charles Bridge is presented as a strategically important place for the execution of law and justice. Lastly, this thesis presents the changing focus of the Bohemian court after the death of Charles IV and how the emblems of Wenceslas IV, which were added to the bridge tower, demonstrate the development of a new chivalric language in the last decades of the fourteenth century...|$|E
40|$|The {{geometrical}} {{elements in}} the architecture of Lincoln Cathedral, in the vaulting and elevations, {{can be compared to}} the geometries described by Robert Grosseteste in his cosmologies. The architecture can be read as a catechism of the cosmologies. The geometries appear in the cathedral {{for the first time in}} the history of architecture to explain the generation, emanation, reflection, refraction and rarefaction of light as it forms the material world. The proposition is that the geometries of the architecture of Lincoln Cathedral can be understood in relation to the geometries which are the basis of the cosmologies of Robert Grosseteste, Bishop of Lincoln 1235 – 53, in particular De lineis, angulis et figuris (On Lines, Angles and Figures, c. 1235), and De luce (On Light, c. 1215). Many of the architectural forms at Lincoln Cathedral are unprecedented in their appearance or use, and they form the basic vocabulary for the entire development of English Gothic architecture. Their radically new appearance has never been adequately explained. Vocabulary elements such as the ridge pole, tierceron or non-structural rib, lierne or segmented ridge rib, flying rib, conoid springer vault or cone of ribs rising from the springer pole in the elevation, <b>triradial</b> vaulting or three ribs meeting at the ridge pole, double syncopated or overlapping arcading, and the bundled and ribbed umbrella column, all originate in some form or are developed for the first time in Lincoln. All of the geometries which appear for the first time in the architecture appear in the cosmologies of Grosseteste, for the purpose of explaining the generation, emanation, reflection, refraction, and rarefaction of light as it forms the material world in geometrical configurations. The cathedral would thus be a catechism of the geometrical substructure of the physical world, in the tradition of the Timaeus of Plato. There is no evidence that the concepts were dictated by Grosseteste directly to masons, but it is well known that such concepts permeated medieval architecture and city planning, and that they were filtered down through all trades involved in construction of the city and the cathedral. Grosseteste’s cosmologies represent a core achievement of Scholasticism, the synthesis of classical philosophy (cosmology) and Catholic theology (light mysticism), which is embodied in the architecture of the cathedral...|$|E
