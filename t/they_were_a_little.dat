500|$|The Giants {{started the}} season with a 27–20 home win over the Philadelphia Eagles. Despite sitting out {{training}} camp and the preseason in a contract dispute, linebacker Lawrence Taylor recorded three sacks and a forced fumble. The Giants' defense forced three turnovers and held the Eagles to 83 rushing yards. The Giants' offense scored three touchdowns in a 13-minute span in the third and early fourth quarters, but head coach Bill Parcells felt the offensive performance was lackluster overall: [...] "Our runners didn't run the way we wanted them to. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> impatient. There were five or six vivid examples of cutting back too soon. You just have to give the play a chance and let it go where it's supposed to." ...|$|E
500|$|Warner Bros. held test {{screenings}} {{and audience}} comments were largely mixed. The studio suggested re-shoots, but the Coens, who held final cut privilege, refused {{because they were}} very nervous working with their biggest budget to date and were eager for mainstream success. The producers eventually added footage that had been cut and also shot minor pick-ups for the ending. Variety magazine claimed that the pick-ups were done {{to try to save}} the film because Warner feared {{it was going to be}} a box office bomb. Joel Coen addressed the issue in an interview: [...] "First of all, they weren't reshoots. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit of additional footage. We wanted to shoot a fight scene at the end of the movie. It was the product of something we discovered editing the movie, not previewing it. We've done additional shooting on every movie, so it's normal." ...|$|E
500|$|Grizzly Rage {{was filmed}} in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada. It breaks from the {{standard}} mold many natural horror films follow in that the bear attacking the main characters is not a mutant or genetically altered, rather it is a normal, but furious mother bear. The mother bear is played by Koda, a [...] male grizzly bear, working {{at the direction of}} a trainer. To induce the bear to appear to be roaring, the trainer gave it marshmallows to make it smile. The roaring sounds were dubbed in later. Both Tyler Hoechlin and Graham Kosakoski noted that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> afraid of the bear and director David DeCoteau felt that working with such a powerful live animal added element of danger for the cast and crew during filming. As such, the bear is never actually filmed together with any of the actors. For scenes where the bear is supposed to interact with the characters, a man in a bear suit takes over the role.|$|E

2500|$|Days of Blood and Starlight {{still had}} {{positive}} reviews, but <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more mixed. Publishers Weekly gave the novel a starred review, praising {{the world that}} it was set in, Taylor's writing, and the suspense. Kirkus Reviews {{said that while the}} characters were a high point of the novel, they were left unimpressed by the plot. Booklist called the novel's plot [...] "dark and brutal", as well as [...] "bitter" [...] and [...] "violent". Entertainment Weekly was more positive, giving Days of Blood and Starlight an [...] "A" [...] and saying that the novel is [...] "richly imagined and compelling".|$|E
2500|$|... {{there is}} not a single {{incident}} in the novel which is borrowed from his real circumstances except the fact that he resided in an old house near a flourishing seaport, and that the Author chanced to witness a scene betwixt him and the female proprietor of a stage coach, very similar to that which commences the history of The Antiquary. [...] An excellent temper, with a slight degree of subacid humour; learning, wit, and drollery, the more piquant that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> marked by the peculiarities of an old bachelor; a soundness of thought rendered more forcible by an occasional quaintness of expression, were, the Author avers, the only qualities in which the creature of his imagination resembled his benevolent and excellent old friend.|$|E
2500|$|The K-car {{was always}} {{the first to arrive}} at the scene. [...] The K-car Commander, using the radio callsign One-Nine, Two-Nine, Three-Nine, or Four-Nine, {{depending}} on the Commando, had to first attempt to confirm the precise area where the enemy had been spotted by the Observation Post. [...] Usually the terrain was extremely broken and covered in vegetation, which made this task particularly difficult. [...] The K-car Commander then had to devise a plan of attack including initial placement of the first stops and where and in what direction to make the main sweep. The first stops to arrive were ferried in by the G-cars, which followed the K-car in a column (sometimes a long way behind, for <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> slower than the K-car).|$|E

5000|$|Life Science Identifiers <b>are</b> <b>a</b> way to {{name and}} locate pieces of {{information}} on the web.
