40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{evaluate}} the applicability of surface electromyography (EMG) for evaluation of training related changes in muscle contractile properties. Eight nationally ranked junior tennis players participated in a six weeks training program designed to increase speed and explosiveness. Their physical characteristics were evaluated before and after the <b>training</b> <b>period</b> by: tennis-specific field tests, measuring isometric twitch contraction of the medial gastrocnemius muscle, and by monitoring the frequency spectrum of the EMG at 50 % of the maximal voluntary contraction. All the players improved the results of tennis specific field tests after the <b>training</b> <b>period,</b> but only three players were recognized to increase contractile speed of the medial gastrocnemius muscle expressed by shorter twitch contraction times after the <b>training</b> <b>period.</b> The same three players exhibited higher characteristic frequency (defined as the mean frequency lying between the sixth and ninth decile of the spectral distribution function) and a wider EMG amplitude spectrum after the <b>training</b> <b>period.</b> A good correlation was found between the number of the parameters of the isometric twitch contraction that were improved by more than 2 % after the <b>training</b> <b>period</b> (N P) and the ratio between characteristic frequency after the <b>training</b> <b>period</b> (f A) and characteristic frequency before the <b>training</b> <b>period</b> (f B) (f A /f B) (p = 0. 0065), as well as between N P and the slope of the linear approximation of the dependence between decile frequencies of the EMG signal after the <b>training</b> <b>period</b> (dAf) and decile frequencies of the EMG signal before the <b>training</b> <b>period</b> (dBf) (dAf = f(dBf)) (p = 0. 0035). The correlation between the number of parameters of the isometric twitch contraction that were improved after the <b>training</b> <b>period</b> and the changes in characteristic parameters of EMG suggests the applicability of EMG for following-up sports training efficiency...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn Japan, transcatheter {{aortic valve}} {{implantation}} (TAVI) with Edwards-SAPIEN XT valve (Edwards Lifesciences Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) started in October 2013. All institutions should undergo a <b>training</b> <b>period</b> to perform TAVI independently. Balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) {{as a bridge}} to TAVI during the <b>training</b> <b>period</b> should be performed with caution to avoid severe aortic regurgitation (AR) because bailout TAVI is not possible. We present {{a case in which}} BAV was successfully performed as a bridge to TAVI during the <b>training</b> <b>period.</b> The patient was an 85 -year-old man with medically uncontrollable congestive heart failure due to severe aortic valve stenosis. The aortic valve area was 0. 60 cm 2 with a left ventricular ejection fraction of 20 %. TAVI was considered a safe but high-risk strategy owing to the unstable hemodynamic condition. We chose BAV as a bridge therapy to TAVI. The aortic annulus diameter was 25. 3 mm on computed tomography scans. We chose a 20 -mm balloon catheter to avoid BAV-induced AR. Transfemoral TAVI was performed successfully 16 days after BAV using a 26 -mm SAPIEN XT valve. The postoperative course was uneventful. The case demonstrated BAV as a bridge therapy to TAVI can be safely and effectively performed during the <b>training</b> <b>period.</b> <Learning objective: All institutions should undergo a <b>training</b> <b>period</b> to start transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI). Balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) during the <b>training</b> <b>period</b> should be performed with caution. The present case suggests that BAV as a bridge therapy to TAVI can be safely performed during the <b>training</b> <b>period.</b> An accurate measurement of aortic annulus diameter and the use of an undersized balloon catheter might reduce the risk of BAV-related aortic regurgitation. ...|$|R
