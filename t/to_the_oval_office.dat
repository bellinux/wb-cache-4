5|$|Francis {{spends most}} of the season as the newly {{appointed}} Vice President of the United States. In early episodes Frank vanquishes reporters on the trail of a murder he committed in the previous season. However, the drama soon shifts to tensions involving Frank, President Walker, the Chinese government, and the wealthy Raymond Tusk, eventually culminating in a bitter political war between Frank and Tusk. Frank's wife Claire publicly reveals that she was raped in college by a prominent general and pursues anti-rape legislation. The most significant new character is Jackie Sharp, Frank's successor as House Whip, who soon finds herself embroiled in Frank's plans. As the war between Frank and Tusk consumes the Presidency, things culminate in a scandal that leads to Walker resigning, Tusk being arrested, and Frank ascending <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office.</b>|$|E
5|$|Claire's main storyline {{in season}} 2 is her advocacy, as Second Lady, for {{a sexual assault}} {{prevention}} bill. During her campaign for the bill a skeleton from her college days emerges: during a nationally televised interview, she admits that she was raped in college and that her rapist, Dalton McGinnis (Peter Bradbury), is now a high-ranking general. (She had earlier had an uncomfortable encounter with McGinnis at a White House dinner, during which she had told Frank what the general had done to her.) She also admits to having aborted a pregnancy that she claims {{was the result of}} the rape; it is later revealed that she in fact aborted Frank's child, with his consent. She then converts the focus on that issue into political support that becomes critical to the Underwoods' ascension <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office.</b>|$|E
5|$|On July 2, 1996, an {{enormous}} alien mothership, that has one fourth {{the mass of}} the Moon, enters orbit around Earth, deploying gargantuan assault fortress saucers, each fifteen miles wide, that take positions over some of Earth's major cities and military bases. David Levinson, an MIT-trained satellite technician, decodes a signal embedded in the global satellite transmissions that he determines is a timer counting down to a coordinated attack. With the help of his former wife, White House Communications Director Constance Spano, David, and his father Julius, gain access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office</b> and warn President Thomas J. Whitmore that the aliens are hostile. Thomas orders large-scale evacuations of New York City, Los Angeles, and Washington D.C., but it is too late; the timer reaches zero and the saucers activate devastating directed-energy weapons, killing millions. Thomas, the Levinsons, and a few others narrowly escape aboard Air Force One as the capital is destroyed, along with other locations over which the saucers are positioned.|$|E

25|$|President Jimmy Carter {{brought the}} desk back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office</b> in 1977, where Presidents Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W.

25|$|When {{president}} Lyndon B. Johnson {{took office}} in 1963, he found he was too large for the desk, and instead commissioned a plainer replacement which was built for him by the Senate cabinet shop. Richard Nixon, who succeeded Johnson in 1969, used the Wilson desk, the desk from the Vice President's Room at the United States Capitol, which he had used as Eisenhower's Vice President and believed {{to be that of}} former president Woodrow Wilson. Gerald Ford, who succeeded to the presidency in 1974 following the resignation of Nixon, used the Wilson desk throughout his term. Jimmy Carter, Ford's successor, brought the Resolute desk back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office,</b> where it remained until George H. W. Bush returned the Wilson desk to the Senate, preferring the C desk that he used while serving as Vice President during the Reagan Administration. Bill Clinton subsequently brought the Resolute desk back again <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office,</b> where it has remained since.|$|E
25|$|The United States has {{a history}} of {{recognizing}} and celebrating Hanukkah in a number of ways. The earliest Hanukkah link with the White House occurred in 1951 when Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion presented United States President Harry Truman with a Hanukkah Menorah. In 1979 president Jimmy Carter took part in the first public Hanukkah candle-lighting ceremony of the National Menorah held across the White House lawn. In 1989, President George H.W.

Reed prepares to execute Sam and the President, revealing that Caldwell was going to shut down Third Echelon after Lambert's death. Reed plans to frame Sam for assassinating Caldwell as supposed proof <b>to</b> <b>the</b> country that Third Echelon is still needed. At this point, Sam and Grim spring into action, disarming Reed and killing his escorts. Sam interrogates Reed while United States Army soldiers extract Caldwell.

Canonically, Fisher spares Reed only for Grim to execute him.|$|R
50|$|Despite Agnew's {{continued}} loyalty <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Nixon administration, {{his relationship}} with Nixon deteriorated almost {{from the start of}} their political affiliation. Although Nixon initially liked and respected Agnew, as time progressed he felt his vice president lacked the intelligence and vision, particularly in foreign affairs, <b>to</b> sit in <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office,</b> and he began freezing Agnew out of the White House decision-making process. By some accounts, the President was also resentful that the self-confident Agnew was so popular with many Americans. By 1970, Agnew was limited <b>to</b> seeing <b>the</b> president only during cabinet meetings or in the occasional and brief one-on-one, with Agnew given no opportunity to discuss much of substance.|$|R
25|$|Theodore Roosevelt hired {{architect}} Charles Follen McKim {{to reorganize}} the layout {{and use of}} the White House. This included constructing the West Wing in 1902 and moving executive offices out of the central White House. The original structure, some of which is still extant in the present West Wing, was originally intended to be temporary. With some modifications by William Howard Taft the West Wing remained largely unchanged until a fire on December 24, 1929 during the administration of Herbert Hoover. Because of the recent stock market crash, Hoover chose only to repair rather than expand. In 1933, early in the administration of Franklin Roosevelt, the president began a series of meetings with staff architect Eric Gugler to enlarge and modify the West Wing. Roosevelt moved Taft's Oval Office, centered {{on the south side of}} the wing, to its present location in the southeast corner adjacent to the Rose Garden. This made moving to and from the Executive Residence <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office</b> quicker, and allowed for more privacy, a concern in concealing FDR's paralysis.|$|E
500|$|Rob Roy {{was known}} as Coolidge's [...] "favorite" [...] among a menagerie of pets he kept that {{included}} dogs, birds, cats, and raccoons. Coolidge himself described Rob Roy as a [...] "stately gentleman of great courage and fidelity". Rob Roy was known to lead Coolidge <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office</b> each morning in a stoic manner with gaze fixed forward. Rob Roy's stately characteristics aside, Coolidge frequently tried to trick the dog into chasing animals that appeared on screen during the showing of films at the White House. According to Harry Truman, Coolidge once ordered Senator Morris Sheppard to surrender his sausage to the dog while Coolidge and Sheppard were having breakfast.|$|E
500|$|According to a 1996 {{issue of}} U.S. News & World Report, a [...] tunnel was {{dug into the}} White House {{connecting}} the Oval Office to a location in the East Wing. The tunnel is purportedly accessed through a door adjacent to the president's restroom, {{which leads to a}} staircase used to enter the tunnel. The excavation of this tunnel, called [...] "Project ZP", was undertaken in 1987 to provide a route for the president to be quickly and privately moved to the Presidential Emergency Operations Center {{in the event of an}} emergency. [...] During the last days of the Reagan presidency, the Project ZP tunnel was allegedly used, in combination with the White House to Treasury Building tunnel, to allow Richard Nixon discreet access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office</b> for at least one consultation with Ronald Reagan.|$|E
500|$|The {{chief of}} {{thoracic}} surgery, Benjamin L. Aaron, decided {{to perform a}} thoracotomy lasting 105 minutes because the bleeding persisted. Ultimately, Reagan lost over half of his blood volume {{in the emergency room}} and during surgery, which removed the bullet. In the operating room, Reagan removed his oxygen mask to joke, [...] "I hope you are all Republicans." [...] The doctors and nurses laughed, and Giordano, a liberal Democrat, replied, [...] "Today, Mr. President, we are all Republicans." [...] Reagan's post-operative course was complicated by fever, which was treated with multiple antibiotics. The surgery was routine enough that they predicted Reagan would be able <b>to</b> leave <b>the</b> hospital in two weeks and return <b>to</b> work at <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office</b> within a month.|$|R

2500|$|The United States presidential {{election}} of 1980 was the 49th quadrennial {{presidential election}}. It {{was held on}} November 4, 1980. The contest was between the Democratic national ticket of incumbent President Jimmy Carter from Georgia and Vice President Walter Mondale from Minnesota, and the Republican national ticket of [...] Ronald Reagan, a former Hollywood actor and former Governor from California with his running mate George H.W. Bush, a former Congressman and CIA Director from Texas who would eventually win the presidency eight years later, as well as Republican Congressman John B. Anderson, who ran as an independent. Reagan, aided by the Iran hostage crisis and a worsening economy at home marked by high unemployment and inflation, won the general election in a landslide and received {{the highest number of}} electoral votes ever won by a non-incumbent presidential candidate. Reagan was 69 at the time and became <b>the</b> oldest person <b>to</b> ever assume <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office</b> at nearly 70; [...] this record would be surpassed 36 years later by Donald Trump, who was a year older at 70, and assumed <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office</b> at just over 70 and a half.|$|R
500|$|Reagan {{became the}} First Lady of the United States when Ronald Reagan was inaugurated as {{president}} in January 1981. Early in her husband's presidency, Reagan stated {{her desire to}} create a more suitable [...] "first home" [...] in the White House, as the building had fallen into a state of disrepair following years of neglect. White House aide Michael Deaver described the second and third floor family residence as having [...] "cracked plaster walls, chipped paint [...] beaten up floors"; rather than use government funds to renovate and redecorate, she sought private donations. In 1981, Reagan directed a major renovation of several White House rooms, including all of the second and third floors and rooms adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office,</b> including the press briefing room. The renovation included repainting walls, refinishing floors, repairing fireplaces, and replacing antique pipes, windows, and wires. The closet in the master bedroom was converted into a beauty parlor and dressing room, and the West bedroom was made into a small gymnasium.|$|E
500|$|Reagan {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office</b> on April 25 {{and received}} a standing ovation from staff and Cabinet members. He referred to their teamwork in his absence and insisted, [...] "I should be applauding you." [...] He made his first public appearance in an April 28 speech before the joint houses of Congress. In the speech, [...] he introduced his planned spending cuts, which had been a campaign promise. He received [...] "two thunderous standing ovations", which The New York Times deemed [...] "a salute to his good health" [...] {{as well as his}} programs, which the president introduced using a medical recovery theme. Reagan installed a gym in the White House and began regularly exercising there, gaining so much muscle that he had to buy new suits. The shooting caused Nancy Reagan to fear for her husband's safety, however. She asked him to not run for reelection in 1984, and, because of her concerns, began consulting astrologer Joan Quigley.|$|E

[...] In response, White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer wrote on the official White House blog the following day, [...] "t is telling that Vice President Cheney and others seem to be more focused on criticizing the Administration than condemning the attackers. Unfortunately too many are engaged in the typical Washington game of pointing fingers and making political hay, instead of working together to find solutions to make our country safer." ...|$|E

Pharr, 706 / 542 - 5172, pharr@arches. uga. edu CONTACT: Prof. Ron Carlson, 706 / 542 - 5186 (O); (706) / 548 - 6771 (H) WITHOUT FRAUD, NO INVALIDATION OF SEMINOLE VOTES, SAYS UGA LAW PROFESSOR ATHENS, Ga. - The {{ballot box}} feud being waged in a Seminole County, Florida {{courtroom}} isn 2 ̆ 7 t likely to help Vice President Al Gore in his legal bid <b>to</b> claim <b>the</b> <b>Oval</b> <b>Office,</b> says UGA law professor Ron Carlson, a nationally renowned trial law expert. The reason: {{the absence of}} a key element in the case. 2 ̆ 2 Nobody claims that any of the absentee votes in Seminole or Martin County, Florida are fraudulent, 2 ̆ 2 says Carlson. 2 ̆ 2 Dead people did note vote. Absent a showing of fraud, the votes will not be thrown out. 2 ̆ 2 He continues: 2 ̆ 2 The burden of proof on the Gore team is even higher in these cases than in the one that went sour for them on Monday in the court of Judge Sanders Sauls. Two specific problems confront Gore. First, if there was a negligent but non-malevolent oversight by the election supervisor in allowing others to put numbers on the ballot, the ballot is voided only if the will of the voter is subverted. Nobody says that occurred. Second, in Democratic counties (counties other than Seminole and Martin), the election supervisors in isolated cases permitted ballots to be counted which had no numbers or to which they had placed the numbers. 2 ̆ 2 Carlson says there might be a case to sanction some election officials, but little legal basis <b>to</b> throw out <b>the</b> ballots. 2 ̆ 2 Al Gore 2 ̆ 7 s best hope remains the Sanders Sauls case, which he already lost at trial but may secure a glimmer of hope on appeal, 2 ̆ 2 says Carlson. 2 ̆ 2 But appeals from bench trials are much more limited and much less successful than those from jury trials. The Florida Supreme Court has much less leeway to give Al Gore a favorable decision. 2 ̆ 2 Carlson says the fat lady is 2 ̆ 2 definitely singing 2 ̆ 2 in this political war. 2 ̆ 2 I believe Al Gore, although he 2 ̆ 7 s desperately anxious to win this election, is an astute enough politician to see that {{in the very near future}} there is such a pessimistic outlook for the legal remedies that he will stop and say, 2 ̆ 7 enough is enough. 2 ̆ 72 ̆ 2 Carlson, a nationally recognized expert in trial practice, has litigated many cases and has been admitted <b>to</b> practice before <b>the</b> United States Supreme Court. He has written numerous books on trial techniques and provided extensive commentary for the national media in high-profile trials.
