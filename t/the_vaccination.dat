5|$|The first {{candidate}} polio vaccine, {{based on}} one serotype of a live but attenuated (weakened) virus, {{was developed by the}} virologist Hilary Koprowski. Koprowski's prototype vaccine was given to an eight-year-old boy on 27 February 1950. Koprowski continued to work on the vaccine throughout the 1950s, leading to large-scale trials in the then Belgian Congo and <b>the</b> <b>vaccination</b> of seven million children in Poland against serotypes PV1 and PV3 between 1958 and 1960.|$|E
5|$|Tuberculosis {{prevention}} and control efforts rely primarily on <b>the</b> <b>vaccination</b> of infants and the detection and appropriate treatment of active cases. The World Health Organization has achieved some success with improved treatment regimens, {{and a small}} decrease in case numbers.

5|$|Given these risks, as {{smallpox}} became effectively eradicated and {{the number}} of naturally occurring cases fell below the number of vaccine-induced illnesses and deaths, routine childhood vaccination was discontinued in the United States in 1972, and was abandoned in most European countries in the early 1970s. Routine vaccination of health care workers was discontinued in the U.S. in 1976, and among military recruits in 1990 (although military personnel deploying to the Middle East and Korea still receive <b>the</b> <b>vaccination).</b> By 1986, routine vaccination had ceased in all countries. It is now primarily recommended for laboratory workers at risk for occupational exposure.|$|E

5|$|There are {{side effects}} and risks {{associated}} with the smallpox vaccine.

Potentially life-threatening reactions occurred in 14 to 500 people out of every 1 million people vaccinated for the first time. Based on past experience, it is estimated that 1 or 2 people in 1 million (0.000198 percent) who receive the vaccine may die as a result, most often the result of postvaccinial encephalitis or severe necrosis in the area of vaccination (called progressive vaccinia).|$|E

40|$|Individuals {{deficient}} in C 3 or a late complement component {{are susceptible to}} recurrent meningococcal infections. Since they experience meningococcal episodes mostly with uncommon meningococcal serogroups, vaccination with a tetravalent vaccine containing A, C, Y and W 135 polysaccharides has been suggested. We vaccinated a cohort of two C 3 and 17 late complement component-deficient (LCCD) patients, revaccinated them 7 years later and investigated {{the development of their}} IgG antibodies to the capsular polysaccharides of the meningococcal vaccine. Seven years after <b>the</b> first <b>vaccination</b> levels of IgG antibodies declined compared with the levels present at 6 months after <b>the</b> first <b>vaccination,</b> but were still at least four times higher than before vaccination. Levels of antibodies to Y polysaccharide in serum of complement-deficient patients were rather low but they did not differ significantly from those in serum of healthy non-related controls (P = 0. 07). Three months after <b>the</b> second <b>vaccination</b> IgG antibodies against all polysaccharides increased, exceeding those measured at 6 months after <b>the</b> first <b>vaccination.</b> In <b>the</b> 8 years of observation after <b>the</b> first <b>vaccination</b> two new meningococcal infections with strains related to the vaccine (serogroup Y strains) occurred in two patients, 3. 5 and 5 years after <b>the</b> first <b>vaccination.</b> Our findings show that high IgG antibody levels against the tetravalent meningococcal polysaccharide vaccine were reached after revaccination of two C 3 and 17 LCCD individuals 7 years after <b>the</b> first <b>vaccination.</b> Whether revaccination should be required within a period shorter than 7 years is discussed, since two vaccinees developed meningococcal disease to vaccine serogroup Y...|$|R
