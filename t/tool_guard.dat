40|$|A three {{jaw chuck}} set from a lathe machine tool failed whilst in use. At some prior {{point in time}} the {{case-hardened}} chuck jaw set had sustained damage to its gripping serrations, thus requiring refurbishment of the jaws. Shortly after re-entering service, the refurbished jaw number one (of three) failed traumatically. Sudden loss of grip allowed a large rapidly rotating work piece to be thrown free, hitting and inflicting seriously injury to the machine tool operator. Analysis of the broken jaw revealed sub-surface case-cracking, initiated {{as a result of}} metallurgical changes induced by thermal processing undertaken as part of the refurbishment cycle. Fatigue propagation of a case-crack had then ensued, driving the crack to final traumatic failure. Further analysis revealed stress raising features on a second jaw. This particular jaw had initiated a longitudinal crack that, at the time of observation, had not propagated to failure. Therefore, both thermal processing and design shortcomings were found to be at issue with this incident. When considering the safety critical nature of lathe chuck jaws, a question to consider is whether a more prudent route of action is required for the future. Rather than attempting refurbishment, it would be reasonable simply to scrap worn jaws. This is considered a sensible course of future action, rather than running the risk of being overtaken by a similar failure. Finally, the issue of ineffective or non-existent machine <b>tool</b> <b>guarding</b> was considered, with the outcomes effectively reducing injury compensation awarded to the machine tool operator. ...|$|R

How important are they for {{the way we are}} governed? How can the ever-expanding impact of the media be controlled? In this up-to-the-minute book, a group of Britain's best-known journalists and media analysts tackle one of the most testing issues facing the nation in the next century. Each essay focuses on the central role of newspapers, broadcasting and information technology in our political life. Peter Riddell shows how the demands of the press and broadcasting have drained Parliament of much of its democratic purpose. Tony Wright gives a fascinating insider's account of the politician-journalist nexus. Andrew Graham points to the monopolistic pressures of the new technology. Colin Seymour-Ure discusses the effects {{of the end of the}} party-political allegiances of newspapers. Philip Schlesinger considers the impact of the Scottish media as catalyst for a political micro-climate. Steve Barnett examines the concept of "tabloidization".

40|$|DRC Guard’s {{real-time}} {{design rule}} check (DRC) verifies entered or modified objects after the objects are edited. DRC Guard detects and flags violations in real-time, eliminating all errors {{by the time}} the design is complete. In the past, DRC was executed once editing and modifications were already complete. Further changes necessitated another DRC, and so on until all violations were detected. The real-time DRC provided by DRC Guard checks for violations during the editing process, eliminating the need for several iterations of verification and editing. The real-time DRC is useful not only for fullcustom layout such as analog blocks, but also for the modification of auto-generated layout from a P&R <b>tool.</b> DRC <b>Guard</b> uses the same DRC rule files as Guardian DRC. This reduces the setup effort and permits the use of complex DRC operations like layer derivations. In addition, DRC Guard reduces workload by choosing the necessary DRC commands from the target object’s setup rule file and by executing as a background process. As a result, even extensive execution of long DRC scripts has little or no impact on layout design performance. Figure 1. DRC Guard shows errors just after entering the object. The latest version of DRC Guard features the "Critical Zone " detector that shows a user precisely how to modify an object in order to solve the detected DRC violation(s). Previous versions required the manual modification of objects based on a ruler or visual grid. Older DRC Guard version required a Guardian (Savage) DRC license in order to use more than ten DRC commands. A new, exclusive license is available so the new version is easier to rollout and introduce to new users. Continued on page 4 [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|Chemical {{movement}} {{is fundamental to}} production agriculture. Crop roots and nutrients must be in contact for optimum crop growth. In the pursuit of this goal, nitrogen that is applied in fertilizers is often leached prior to crop uptake. Means to limit fertilizer leaching to conserve resources are needed;Application method {{plays a role in}} the way chemicals move through soil. Structured soil column effluent studies suggest that leaching could be reduced if chemicals are allowed to penetrate soil aggregates prior to saturation by an infiltrating solution. In well structured soil, mixing chemicals with a limited volume of soil and destroying structure in that region further delay chemicals from traveling through the structured soil. These data suggest that isolating chemicals in zones that contain fewer large pores than the bulk soil should reduce chemical leaching from surface soils;In addition to isolating chemicals in soil that has fewer large pores (as a result of mechanical disturbance), chemical application strategies include placing chemicals under a ridge, and using a hydraulic barrier above the applied chemical. A ridge will divert surface water away from the ridge peak, so it will infiltrate the soil at the ridge valley, bypassing the chemicals below the ridge. Hydraulic barriers will serve a similar purpose, to limit water flow through chemically treated soil. A prototype N-fertilizer applicator was designed and constructed (patent pending), to apply N-fertilizer to locally tilled soil, construct a hydraulic barrier (compacted soil) over the fertilizer, and form a surface dome or ridge. This localized compaction and doming (LCD) applicator was compared with conventional knife applicators by investigating nitrate redistribution in an Iowa corn field and measuring tile drain water concentrations to determine leaching rates of surface applied chemicals;Soil nitrate concentrations were closer to the surface and less dilute when fertilizer was applied by the LCD versus the conventional knife. Tile drain water concentrations show that after 10 cm of drainage, 5 % of knife injected chemicals were recovered, compared to just 1 % of LCD applied chemicals. Modifying surface soils to alter water flow paths is a valuable <b>tool</b> to <b>guard</b> against ground water or tile drain contamination by N-fertilizers...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{previous}} {{efforts in}} auditing software manually and automatically, buffer overruns {{are still being}} discovered in programs in use. A dynamic bounds checker detects buffer overruns in erroneous software before it occurs and thereby prevents attacks from corrupting {{the integrity of the}} system. Dynamic buffer overrun detectors have not been adopted widely because they either (1) cannot guard against all buffer overrun attacks, (2) break existing code, or (3) incur too high an overhead. This paper presents a practical detector called CRED (C Range Error Detector) that avoids each of these deficiencies. CRED finds all buffer overrun attacks as it directly checks for the bounds of memory accesses. Unlike the original referent-object based bounds-checking technique, CRED does not break existing code because it uses a novel solution to support program manipulation of out-of-bounds addresses. Finally, by restricting the bounds checks to strings in a program, CRED’s overhead is greatly reduced without sacrificing protection in the experiments we performed. CRED is implemented {{as an extension of the}} GNU C compiler version 3. 3. 1. The simplicity of our design makes possible a robust implementation that has been tested on over 20 open-source programs, comprising over 1. 2 million lines of C code.

The scientific community's improving ability to interpret individuals' genetic materials and the growing size of genetic database populations have been aggravating the potential consequences of data breaches. The prevalent use of passwords to generate encryption keys thus poses an especially serious problem when applied to genetic data. Weak passwords can jeopardize genetic data in the short term, but given the multi-decade lifespan of genetic data, even the use of strong passwords with conventional encryption can lead to compromise. We present a <b>tool,</b> called Geno <b>Guard,</b> for providing strong protection for genomic data both today {{and in the long}} term. Geno Guard incorporates a new theoretical framework for encryption called honey encryption (HE) : it can provide information-theoretic confidentiality guarantees for encrypted data. Previously proposed HE schemes, however, can be applied to messages from, unfortunately, a very restricted set of probability distributions. Therefore, Geno Guard addresses the open problem of applying HE techniques to the highly non-uniform probability distributions that characterize sequences of genetic data. In Geno Guard, a potential adversary can attempt exhaustively to guess keys or passwords and decrypt via a brute-force attack. We prove that decryption under any key will yield a plausible genome sequence, and that Geno Guard offers an information-theoretic security guarantee against message-recovery attacks. We also explore attacks that use side information. Finally, we present an efficient and parallelized software implementation of Geno Guard. © 2015 IEEE...|$|R

It may be possible to suggest something {{of the nature of the}} thing, but a static medium such as an article or a photograph cannot possibly capture the complete scope and impact of such a dynamic phenomenon. Although microcomputers are in many ways a natural, evolutionary outgrowth of previously existing computer developments, their effect has surely been revolutionary in its breadth anddepth. Despite great advances in the use of shared computer systems and telecommunications networks, the mainframe computer was and is the province of the wealthy institution. The minicomputer brought computing power to mid-sized institutions, but was still beyond the grasp of most small institutions and virtually all individuals. The microcomputer has made automation accessible to nearly every small business or individual with a desire and need for a computer. The availability of relatively inexpensive, independently operated personal computers has brought automation to people, situations, and tasks that might otherwise never have been automated. At the same time, microcomputers used as intelligent terminals have led to great improvements in the use of larger computers.

40|$|We extract a novel quantum {{programming}} paradigm - superposition {{of programs}} - from the design {{idea of a}} popular class of quantum algorithms, namely quantum walk-based algorithms. The generality of this paradigm is guaranteed by the universality of quantum walks as a computational model. A new quantum programming language QGCL is then proposed to support the paradigm of superposition of programs. This language {{can be seen as}} a quantum extension of Dijkstra's GCL (Guarded Command Language). Surprisingly, alternation in GCL splits into two different notions in the quantum setting: classical alternation (of quantum programs) and quantum alternation, with the latter being introduced in QGCL for the first time. Quantum alternation is the key program construct for realizing the paradigm of superposition of programs. The denotational semantics of QGCL are defined by introducing a new mathematical <b>tool</b> called the <b>guarded</b> composition of operator-valued functions. Then the weakest precondition semantics of QGCL can straightforwardly derived. Another very useful program construct in realizing the quantum programming paradigm of superposition of programs, called quantum choice, can be easily defined in terms of quantum alternation. The relation between quantum choices and probabilistic choices is clarified through defining the notion of local variables. We derive a family of algebraic laws for QGCL programs that can be used in program verification, transformations and compilation. The expressive power of QGCL is illustrated by several examples where various variants and generalizations of quantum walks are conveniently expressed using quantum alternation and quantum choice. We believe that quantum programming with quantum alternation and choice will play an important role in further exploiting the power of quantum computing.

40|$|Abstract Due to the {{increasing}} number of Information Communication Technology (ICT) environments, security is becoming a concern for many researchers and organisations. Organisations have implemented different security measures to protect their assets. Different industries—such as power plants and water, oil, and gas utilities—are adapting different network modelling <b>tools</b> for <b>guarding</b> their assets and are preparing for incidents that might occur in the future. Modelling tools are very important for the visualisation of computer networks. There are currently many modelling tools with different modelling and visualisation capabilities for computer networks. The aim of this research is to make a thorough assessment of the different modelling tools’ capabilities of modelling computer networks and visualising computer network communication. Furthermore, it hopes to show areas for improvement in order to increase the quality of modelling tools based on industry requirements. The research methodology of this research {{takes the form of a}} case study. First, the study analyses previous research in order to illustrate gaps in the literature, as well as identifying the strengths and weaknesses of existing network modelling tools. The empirical part of the research includes first, studying and evaluating seven open-source modelling tools based on different types of capabilities, this may limit the generalisability of the findings to some extent; and second, selecting four modelling tools for further study. Once four modelling tools were evaluated based on literature reviews and the requirements set in this study, the top two open-source (OSS) modelling tool packages were selected, downloaded, installed, and evaluated further. The criteria set to evaluate the four modelling tools in this research are based on the requirements provided by the European company nSense, which provides different vulnerability assessments, security consulting, and training, and the existing literature. The evaluation of the tools resulted in the screens that were copied and presented in this document for verification. Finally, the one tool which was the most suitable for further studies, and which fulfilled most of the requirements set in this research, was recommended for further research. In total, four modelling tools were chosen for the evaluation, using different literature reviews based on the requirements (see Appendix A) in this research. The results showed that the two top modelling tools were OMNeT++ and IMUNES. After practical analysis of these tools, OMNeT++ was found to be the best tool based on the aims and requirements of this research. Further, the study found that usability problems played a large part in evaluating different modelling tools, which might have changed the outcomes of the result. It can therefore be concluded that this type of evaluation is highly dependent on the evaluator’s knowledge and skill, as well as the usability of the tool...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background A common {{limitation}} in {{guard cell}} signaling research {{is that it}} is difficult to obtain consistent high expression of transgenes of interest in Arabidopsis guard cells using known guard cell promoters or the constitutive 35 S cauliflower mosaic virus promoter. An additional drawback of the 35 S promoter is that ectopically expressing a gene throughout the organism could cause pleiotropic effects. To improve available methods for targeted gene expression in guard cells, we isolated strong guard cell promoter candidates based on new guard cell-specific microarray analyses of 23, 000 genes that are made available together with this report. Results A promoter, pGC 1 (At 1 g 22690), drove strong and relatively specific reporter gene expression in guard cells including GUS (beta-glucuronidase) and yellow cameleon YC 3. 60 (GFP-based calcium FRET reporter). Reporter gene expression was weaker in immature guard cells. The expression of YC 3. 60 was sufficiently strong to image intracellular Ca 2 + dynamics in guard cells of intact plants and resolved spontaneous calcium transients in guard cells. The GC 1 promoter also mediated strong reporter expression in clustered stomata in the stomatal development mutant too-many-mouths (tmm). Furthermore, the same promoter::reporter constructs also drove guard cell specific reporter expression in tobacco, illustrating the potential of this promoter as a method for high level expression in guard cells. A serial deletion of the promoter defined a guard cell expression promoter region. In addition, anti-sense repression using pGC 1 was powerful for reducing specific GFP gene expression in guard cells while expression in leaf epidermal cells was not repressed, demonstrating strong cell-type preferential gene repression. Conclusion The pGC 1 promoter described here drives strong reporter expression in guard cells of Arabidopsis and tobacco plants. It provides a potent research <b>tool</b> for targeted <b>guard</b> cell expression or gene silencing. It is also applicable to reduce specific gene expression in guard cells, providing a method for circumvention of limitations arising from genetic redundancy and lethality. These advances could be very useful for manipulating signaling pathways in guard cells and modifying plant performance under stress conditions. In addition, new guard cell and mesophyll cell-specific 23, 000 gene microarray data are made publicly available here. </p...|$|R
