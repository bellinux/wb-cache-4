5000|$|School Bus Three-Point Turn: While {{challenges}} {{involving a}} three-point turn are commonplace for the show, {{the task is}} much harder this year, as the drivers each have to drive a school bus (which Andrew adds {{is being used to}} give the drivers a lesson in front-end swing) into a large <b>turning</b> <b>space</b> bordered by cars, and make a three-point turn without hitting anything. Each driver has 40 minutes in which to complete the challenge. Chanie, who didn't even know what a three-point turn was until a few days ago, initially doesn't use her mirrors and makes no effort to avoid hitting the cars. Andrew draws her a map to illustrate how to do the challenge, and she completes it on her next turn. Tyler also didn't know what a three-point turn was, but he manages to carry it out on his first turn without Andrew even needing to explain it, finally passing a challenge. Jason fails all of his first three runs within seconds, as the front-end swing causes him to hit the barriers leading into the <b>turning</b> <b>space.</b> He fails after running out of time, though is able to work {{out how to do it}} after the fact. Siham technically succeeds on her first go, but it isn't considered a true pass since Wayne directed her throughout. Mariah ends up using the entire 40 minutes on her first attempt alone, as her overly-tight turning causes her to get stuck, and her inability to get out causes her to fail. However, Andrew teaches her how to do the three-point turn after the challenge has officially ended.|$|E

5000|$|Cadillac Challenge: The Reverse Flick: In {{an attempt}} to take {{advantage}} of the previous lesson still being fresh in the heads of the drivers, the show's other car-spinning challenge is the next one to be held. This time the drivers have to reverse into a <b>turning</b> <b>space</b> at 40 km/h, and again spin the car around 180 degrees, with the number of chances also being three. Due to Andrew only narrowly passing his demonstration, the course is widened to make life easier for the others. Jason again gets the first run, and fails all three attempts; on his first go he leaves it far too late to steer, and on his second and third attempts he doesn't even get into the <b>turning</b> <b>space,</b> crashing through the barriers that make up the entry lane. Mariah also smashes the entry barriers on her first attempt due to not looking where she wants to go, but passes on her second attempt after she focuses properly. On his first attempt, Tyler hits the entry barriers; he fails his second attempt due to driving too fast (at 60 km/h) and turning too late, and his third attempts ends in failure for largely the same reason, along with Q still telling him what to do. A clearly unenthusiastic Siham becomes the third driver in a row to hit the barriers in her first run, and take it a step further by not even bothering to stop and smashing one of the turning area's walls. Before she takes another run, Siham gets a private lesson from Andrew, in which her erratic driving ends up triggering Wayne's motion sickness. She then takes her second run with Andrew as her passenger, and passes. Chanie has the final run, and after drastically failing her first run by smashing the entry barriers at high speed, she admits to having no reversing experience whatsoever before being on the show. On her second run however, she passes with ease.|$|E
50|$|Three-Point Turning: A small <b>turning</b> <b>space</b> is set {{up using}} a variety of cars, and the drivers are each given thirty minutes in which to pull off a three-point turn using a Jeep Wrangler (previously used as Flora's car in the Gas Station {{challenge}} in Episode 5). Kevin takes the challenge first and soon finds it tough going due to his lack of understanding of the technique, repeatedly crashing into things and taking far more steps than allowed. He ultimately runs out of time, never managing better than a five-point turn. Flora is next, and in a change of form actually solicits Frank's advice to complete the challenge. Even with his help however, she fails to complete the challenge; like Kevin, the shortest she manages is a five-point turn. Diane takes her first run without any real thought as to how she's going to accomplish the challenge, and duly gets stuck. During the second run, Stephane works out a way of completing the challenge that even the producers had not thought possible, and with his help Diane is able to pass the challenge, getting much credit from Andrew for pulling off a very tricky series of turns. Margherita is in an extremely foul mood during the challenge (why she's in a bad mood isn't stated, though Margherita mentions that she's having personal problems), and thus never really makes an effort in the challenge, repeatedly running into cars and snapping at Cheryl, who for once is the more subdued of the two. She duly fails the challenge, with Andrew advising her to talk to Shyamala, a notion which she has refused until now.|$|E

5000|$|Camaro Challenge: The Mega-Challenge: For what Andrew {{claims to}} be the show's most {{demanding}} Mega-Challenge yet, the drivers will each begin with a combined Eye of the Needle and Slalom, which ends in an Icy Corner that they have to safely negotiate. The drivers then have to navigate a forward section of wheel rims, then turn the car around in a space enclosed by concrete barriers, before ending the challenge with a reverse-flick. Sly goes first and hits nearly every arch and foam person in the initial section, then fails the Icy Corner. He then hits a lot of wheel rims in the forward section, dents and scrapes the Camaro in the concrete <b>turning</b> <b>space,</b> and knocks over even more wheel rims in the reversing section. After getting wedged on some rims, he gets out to remove them, but accidentally leaves the Camaro in reverse, resulting in it taking off without him and not stopping until it gets wedged on more rims. Finally, Sly attempts the reverse flick far too late and understeers, ensuring a total failure in every aspect of the challenge. Kevin gets off to a great start, and performs both the Eye of the Needle/Slalom combo and the Icy Corner flawlessly, causing Andrew to congratulate him just before he begins the wheel rim section. His congratulations prove premature however, as Kevin starts knocking down the rims, and his mounting stress causes the run to rapidly fall apart, with Kevin again heavily scraping the car while turning it around, knocking down even more wheel rims in reverse, and then getting the reverse flick spectacularly wrong and destroying the left-hand side of the turning area. Michael has the final run, and gets the initial straight right without hitting any arches or foam people, but then fails the Icy Corner. Like Kevin, his mounting stress then causes him to start knocking down the wheel rims; he at least turns the Camaro around without hitting anything, but continues to knock down rims in the reverse section, and then fails the reverse flick when he turns the steering wheel the wrong way, leaving Michael visibly angry with himself.|$|E
5000|$|Charger Challenge: The Mega Challenge: This year's {{incarnation}} of the Mega Challenge is largely {{the same as those}} used in the previous two years, beginning with an Eye of the Needle and Slalom combo, followed by a precision drive forwards and then backwards through a short course of wheel rims (turning the car around in a section of concrete Jersey barriers in the middle), before attempting a reverse flick, and then navigating a short second Eye of the Needle course into an Icy Corner. Polly gets off to a decent start, carrying out the Eye of the Needle and Slalom combo flawlessly and only hitting two things in the forward precision steering section, but things quickly start going wrong when she turns the car around, as she hits it twelve times, before hitting several things while reversing. She then fails to even make it into the <b>turning</b> <b>space</b> for the Reverse Flick before hitting an arch in the second Eye of the Needle, before her run ends in disaster as she speeds, locks up her brakes and understeers on the Icy Corner, smashing through the wall. Jillian goes too slowly on the Eye of the Needle and Slalom (though doesn't hit anything), before hitting several things in the precision steering section, albeit while doing a much better job of turning the car around than Polly. She then fails the Reverse Flick by understeering, breaks that Charger's passenger-side wing mirror in the second Eye of the Needle, and then speeds and brakes too late in the Icy Corner. Sholom gets off to a terrible start, smashing two of the arches (and another passenger-side wing mirror) in the opening section, but does navigate the Charger through the first precision steering section and turn it around in the concrete barriers without hitting anything. He hits a lot of things while reversing however, and while he comes closest to passing the Reverse Flick, he fails it by clipping the barrier leading into the turning section. He also comes the closest to passing the Icy Corner, but fails after steering too late and hitting {{near the end of the}} boxes.|$|E
5000|$|Mustang Challenge: Reverse Flick: In what Andrew {{describes}} as the most difficult lesson of the season, the drivers are taught how to rapidly spin their cars 180 degrees. They will then be required to reverse at 40 km/h in a large space bordered by a barrier and cityscape, and upon entering the space spin their cars without hitting anything; each driver will be allowed five attempts at this challenge. Azim takes the challenge first, and after hitting the outer barrier on his first run, he goes far too slow in the three subsequent runs (at around only 10 km/h), only succeeding in turning his car 90 degrees and hitting the barrier or cityscape each time. On his final run, he goes too fast and oversteers, plowing through the cityscape and into the adjoining field. Margherita does poorly at first, crashing into the outer barrier twice and oversteering the other two times. After taking some time to relax before her fifth and final run, and focusing more during the run itself, she manages to successfully pull off the manoeuvre and passes the challenge. In her first run, Diane waits too long before steering, crashing into the far barrier and causing the Mustang's badly damaged front bumper to finally give out. Subsequently, she hits the outer barrier on her second run, then nearly succeeds on her third but fails for clipping the wall, and failing her last two runs for similar reasons. Afterwards, she ascribes her failure {{to the fact that}} she only looked at her steering wheel and not her mirrors. Flora's run is the worst yet; she never once makes it into the <b>turning</b> <b>space,</b> crashing through the outer wall and cityscape on every single attempt. Despite Flora's horrid performance in this challenge, Andrew considers Frank more directly at fault for his repeated badgering. Kevin takes an unusual approach during his first four runs, only looking out the back window and relying on Lenny to tell him what speed he was driving at. This results in him crashing into the outer barrier on each of the four goes, and after Andrew reminds Kevin what he was taught to do in the lesson, he succeeds on his final attempt, passing his first challenge.|$|E

40|$|In English Question+Answer (Q+A) pairs, {{periodicity}} typically emerges across <b>turn</b> <b>space,</b> to {{a degree}} of precision matching standards of music perception. Interactionally- aligned Q+A pairs display such shared periodicity across the turn, while unaligned pairs do not. Periodicity is measured as temporal location of f 0 maxima or minima, ‘pikes’, in successive accented syllables. This study asks whether periodicity of pikes across a turn is accompanied by systematic use of musical pitch intervals across the <b>turn</b> <b>space.</b> Recordings of 77 Q+A pairs from 8 pairs of native English speakers talking naturally. Ratios of f 0 in the last pike of the Question and {{the first of the}} Answer fell more reliably into Western musical interval categories when the Q+A pair’s turn transition was periodic (the Answer was aligned or preferred, re the Question) than when it was aperiodic (disaligned, dispreferred). Similar results were found for ratios of modal f 0. Such pitch ratios are better described by musical interval categories of Western tuning systems than by those of three non-Western systems, and best of all by semitones, suggesting close connections between culturally-specific uses of pitch in conversation and in music. Judgments of arousal/valence suggest weak relations with specific pitch intervals. Theoretical implications are discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Charger Challenge: Reverse Flick: Philippe gives each of {{the drivers}} a lesson in how to {{unbalance}} the car with a swift, slight turn of the steering wheel, and then spin it around 180 degrees with a larger turn of the wheel. The drivers are then given five chances to reverse the Charger into a turning area bordered by foam blocks, and spin it around in the area. Sholom is up first, and defies the dire predictions of Andrew and the experts by succeeding on his first attempt, finally passing a challenge. Actually getting the car into the turning area proves to be Renee's major issue, as it takes her until her fourth attempt {{to get in there}} without hitting the entry lane markers; once she actually does so however, she passes with ease. Andrew then tells her that with all the extra lessons that Jillian's been getting to help with her anxiety, it's only fair that Renee get the same for her fear of the highway. She's then sent with Tim for a drive on-and-off the Chedoke Expressway, which she then has to repeat three times; though she's initially very nervous, by her fourth and final run she's able to handle being on the expressway relatively calmly. Jordan fails his first attempt when he fails to steer in the reverse portion and hits the entry lane barriers, but on his second attempt he manages to pass despite not quite turning the car around fully. Polly fails to get into the <b>turning</b> <b>space</b> in four out of her five runs, and in the remaining run doesn't turn the wheel nearly far enough and skids through one of the side walls. After her run ends, Polly admits that her reversing is so bad that she had to cut down two trees next to her driveway at home, as she was constantly hitting them. Jillian also hits the entry barriers in her first run, after which Mitchell volunteers to monitor her speed while she focuses on where she's going; Andrew overhears this, however, and orders him out of the car {{for the rest of her}} run. All her subsequent attempts end with her needlessly hitting the brakes, which causes her to lose control and repeatedly crash through the walls.|$|E
5000|$|Forward Handbrake J-Turn: In what {{is noted}} {{to be one}} of the show's harder challenges, the drivers must each drive a Ford Mustang coupe into a small <b>turning</b> <b>space</b> at 50 km/h, and use the {{handbrake}} to spin the car around 180 degrees while dodging an oversized foam birthday cake, before safely driving out of the space. Each driver has three chances to succeed. In his first turn, Jason somehow forgets that he's supposed to use the handbrake, and hits the far wall with the car still entirely facing forwards. He makes a similar mistake (using the footbrake) on his second turn, and his inability to even comprehend the difference between how a footbrake and a handbrake works causes the experts to again question Jason's suitability to drive at all. He finally gets the technique somewhat correct on his third attempt, but carries it out too late and hits a side wall, failing. Tyler relies on Q to read out his speed during his first two attempts, and he fails his first attempt when he uses the footbrake. His second attempt goes better, but only spins the car by about 140 degrees. His final attempt is taken too fast, at 60 km/h, but he still carries out the technique correctly; Andrew tells him that his speeding would normally cause this to be deemed a failure, but agrees to call it a pass since he did it without Q's help. Chanie appears to pass the challenge on her first attempt, but the experts and Andrew refuse to consider it a pass, as she pulled the handbrake early and missed the cake by just inches. She's forced to take her second run, and becomes unresponsive, forcing Jeremy to pull the handbrake for her. Jeremy is asked to sit out Chanie's third run, and she finally passes the challenge. Wayne asks to sit out Siham's run, afraid that the challenge would trigger his motion sickness, and Andrew is all too happy to take his place in the car, which will force Siham to think for herself. Unfortunately this does not lead to Andrew's hoped-for result, and she posts the worst performance of the day, smashing through the outer walls on all three attempts, causing Andrew to realize that her self-confidence is even lower than he (and Shaymala) previously thought it was. Mariah's run is less dramatic, but she fails all three attempts due to her using the footbrake instead of the handbrake.|$|E
