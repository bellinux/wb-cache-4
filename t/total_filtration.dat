Because the users cannot legally remove the x-ray movable diaphragm of the x-ray source device, <b>total</b> <b>filtration,</b> which {{is the sum of}} the additional filtration diaphragm movable for specific filtration and x-ray, cannot be measured.

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine whether ACE inhibition increases renal filtration surface area in the spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). MethodsSHR were treated with the ACE inhibitor perindopril at a high dose (3 mg/kg/day) or a low dose (0. 1 mg/kg/day) during the period of hypertension development, from 7 to 14 weeks of age. Some animals were treated concomitantly with the bradykinin B 2 receptor antagonist, S 16118. Tail-cuff systolic blood pressure and body weights were measured twice weekly. At termination of treatment, glomerular number and volume, length, and surface area of glomerular capillaries and renal filtration surface area were estimated using unbiased stereological techniques. ResultsThere were significant dose-related reductions in blood pressure with high- and low-dose perindopril treatment. Neither low- nor high-dose perindopril treatment had any effect on glomerular number or size or glomerular capillary length and surface area. Hence, there was no significant difference in <b>total</b> renal <b>filtration</b> surface area between any of the experimental groups (8721 ± 610 mm 2 in untreated SHR and 7879 ± 338 mm 2 and 8767 ± 437 mm 2 in the low and high dose perindopril-treated groups, respectively).

Additionally, this paper uses a simple model and available data to estimate the energy and total costs of the filtration options. Predicted reductions in cat and dust-mite allergen concentrations range from 20 % to 80 %. To obtain substantial, e. g., 50 %, reductions in indoor concentrations of these allergens, the rate of airflow through the filter {{must be at least}} a few indoor volumes per hour. Increasing filter efficiencies above approximately ASHRAE Dust Spot 65 % does not significantly reduce predicted indoor concentrations of these allergens. For environmental tobacco smoke particles and outdoor fine mode particles, calculations indicate that relatively large, e. g., 80 %, decreases in indoor concentrations are attainable with practical filter efficiencies and flow rates. Increasing the filter efficiency above ASHRAE 85 % results in only modest predicted incremental decreases in indoor concentration. Energy costs and total costs can be similar for filtration using filters {{with a wide range of}} efficiency ratings. <b>Total</b> estimated <b>filtration</b> costs of approximately $ 0. 70 to $ 1. 80 per person per month are insignificant relative to salaries, rent, or health insurance costs...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} the large pore {{radius of the}} glomerular capillary filter, plasma-to-urine fractional clearances {{of a number of}} endogenous proteins were assessed in normal and in nephrotic Wistar rats in which proximal tubular reabsorption had been inhibited using lysine. The proteins studied varied in radius from 16. 2 A (Beta 2 -microglobulin) to 90 A (alpha 2 -macroglobulin). The nephrotic syndrome was induced by puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN). A marked restriction of the transport of large proteins across the glomerular capillary wall was found, indicating that there are no non-discriminatory 'shunt pathways' in the glomerular barrier. Rather, there seems to be large pores of radius 110 to 115 A accounting for the clearance of large proteins into the primary urine. This protein excretion pattern was almost the same for control and nephrotic rats, except that in the latter, the number of large pores was increased 170 times. The ratio between the number of large and small pores was calculated to be approximately equal to 7 x 10 (- 7) in normal rats and to 1. 2 x 10 (- 4) in PAN nephrotic rats, assuming no classic shunt pathways. If classic shunt pathways had still existed, they would normally contribute to no more than approximately equal to 10 (- 5) of the <b>total</b> glomerular <b>filtration</b> rate. We postulate that very large macromolecules like IgM will not pass the glomerular filter at all under normal conditions, whereas the urine concentration of alpha 2 -macroglobulin will normally be extremely low...|$|R
40|$|The glomerular dynamic {{correlates}} of failed filtration were studied in volume replete rats with established glycerol-induced {{acute renal failure}} (ARF). Over one-half of all nephrons formed virtually no filtrate, while the single nephron glomerular filtration rate (SNGFR) of fluid-filled nephrons, measured at the glomerulotubular junction to preclude the possibility of covert tubular leakage, averaged one-sixth of control (P less than 0. 001). Even that low mean value was elevated by a few nephrons with a near normal SNGFR. Renal failure thus reflected both <b>total</b> <b>filtration</b> failure {{in the majority of}} nephrons and massively reduced filtration in most of the remainder. Glomerular capillary pressure (Pg) averaged some 14 mmHg below control (P less than 0. 001), whereas the arterial colloid osmotic and Bowman's space pressures were not significantly altered. Renocortical and whole kidney blood flow were also unchanged. Marked internephron functional heterogeneity precluded estimates of the ultrafiltration coefficient. However, the fall in SNGFR correlated well with the markedly depressed Pg and afferent net filtration pressure (delta PnetA, P less than 0. 001), which in turn were caused by increased preglomerular resistance and a reciprocal fall in efferent arteriolar resistance. This complex change in intrarenal resistances was largely, if not entirely, responsible for failed filtration in this ARF model...|$|E
40|$|Introduced Pacific oysters Crassostrea gigas have {{expanded}} {{rapidly in the}} Dutch Oosterschelde estuary, while stocks of native bivalves declined slightly. As a consequence, <b>total</b> <b>filtration</b> pressure increased significantly, which may affect the mortality of bivalve larvae. Better escape abilities in Pacific oyster larvae might be a contributing factor to their rapid geographic expansion. To study whether C gigas larvae are filtered less than larvae of native bivalves, we investigated filtration and ingestion of the larvae of the native Mytilus edulis and introduced C. gigas by the adults of C gigas and M. edulis {{as well as the}} native Cerastoderma edule. We measured filtration rates of C gigas and M. edulis larvae by the adult bivalves (C gigas, M. edulis and C. edule), and compared these to filtration rates of algae. Additionally, we studied the fate of filtered larvae. All three adult species filtered both C gigas and M. edulis larvae. M. edulis larvae were filtered by all three bivalve species with the same filtration rates as algae, whereas filtration rates of C gigas larvae were roughly 50 % lower than filtration rates of algae. This suggests that C. gigas larvae can somehow reduce their filtration risk, whereas larvae of M. edulis cannot. The majority of filtered C. gigas and M. edulis larvae were ingested.

40|$|Abstract Introduction: The dental {{radiology}} {{represents about}} 20 % of human {{exposure to radiation}} in radio diagnostic. Although the doses practiced in intraoral dentistry are considered low, {{they should not be}} ignored due to the volume of the performed procedures. This study presents the radiation protection conditions for intraoral radiology in Curitiba - PR. Methods Data was collected through a quantitative field research of a descriptive nature during the period between September of 2013 and December of 2014. The survey sample consisted of 97 dentists and 130 intraoral equipments. The data related to the equipments was collected using structured questions and quality control evaluations. The evaluations of the entrance skin dose, the size of the radiation field and the <b>total</b> <b>filtration</b> were performed with dosimetry kits provided and evaluated by IRD/CNEN. The exposure time and voltage were measured using noninvasive detectors. The occupational dose was verified by thermoluminescent dosimeters. The existence of personal protection equipment, the type of image processing and knowledge of dentists about radiation protection were verified through the application of a questionnaire. Results Among the survey's results, it is important to emphasize that 90 % of the evaluated equipments do not meet all the requirements of the Brazilian radiation protection standards. Conclusion The lack of knowledge about radiation protection, the poor operating conditions of the equipments, and the image processing through visual method are mainly responsible for the unnecessary exposure of patients to ionizing radiation...|$|E
40|$|Almost {{a billion}} persons lack access to {{improved}} drinking water, and diarrheal diseases cause an estimated 1. 87 million deaths per year. Sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC) tablets are widely recommended for household water treatment to reduce diarrhea. Because NaDCC is directly added to untreated water sources, concerns {{have been raised}} about the potential health impact of disinfection by-products. This study investigated trihalomethane (THM) production in water from six sources used for drinking (0. 6 – 888. 5 nephelometric turbidity units) near Arusha, Tanzania. No sample collected at 1, 8, and 24 hours after NaDCC addition exceeded the World Health Organization guideline values for either individual or <b>total</b> THMs. Ceramic <b>filtration,</b> sand filtration, cloth filtration, and settling and decanting were not effective mitigation strategies to reduce THM formation. Chlorine residual and THM formation {{were not significantly different}} in NaDCC and sodium hypochlorite treatment. Household chlorination of turbid and non-turbid waters did not create THM concentrations that exceeded health risk guidelines...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} nephrotomy on renal function in clinically normal cats. ANIMALS: 20 specific-pathogen-free, 9 - to 11 -month-old female mixed-breed cats. PROCEDURE: Serum chemistry analyses, CBC determinations, urinalyses, microbiologic urine cultures, renal ultrasonography, abdominal radiography, and single-kidney and <b>total</b> glomerular <b>filtration</b> rate (GFR) determinations by use of renal scintigraphy and measurements of plasma disappearance of technetium 99 m-diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid were performed before surgery and at 3, 12, 26, 52, and 78 weeks after surgery in 10 cats that underwent unilateral nephrotomy and in 10 control cats that underwent a sham surgical procedure. RESULTS: Two cats (1 from each group) did not complete the study, and their data were eliminated from analyses. Unilateral nephrotomy resulted in a 10 % to 20 % reduction in mean single-kidney GFR, {{compared with that of}} nephrotomy contralateral control kidneys. However, mean total GFR in nephrotomy-group cats was not significantly different from that of sham-group cats. Over the 78 weeks of study, mean total GFR declined 34 % and 40 % in nephrotomy- and sham-group cats, respectively. Adverse events associated with nephrotomy included persistent microscopic hematuria, renal pelvis hyperechogenicity with distant shadowing on ultrasonographic evaluation, dilatation of renal pelves, and hydronephrosis. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Nephrotomy in normal functioning feline kidneys results in a modest relative reduction in renal function, compared with contralateral kidney controls, but has minimal effect on total GFR when compared with sham-operated control cats. However, any detrimental effects of nephrotomy may be magnified in cats with diseased kidneys, which may have little or no capacity for repair or compensation...|$|R
