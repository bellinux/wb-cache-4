5|$|Heart {{conditions}} in the Sussex Spaniel can include pulmonary valve stenosis, {{which is the most}} common of the congenital heart defects. Essentially, in an animal with <b>this</b> <b>condition,</b> the pulmonary valve is improperly formed which causes the heart to work much faster to pump blood around the body. The final results of <b>this</b> <b>condition</b> can be swelling of fluid in the chambers of the heart, thickening of the heart muscle known as ventricular hypertrophy leading to eventual heart failure.|$|E

5|$|An {{incidental}} finding {{associated with}} <b>this</b> <b>condition</b> is a heel spur, a small bony calcification on the calcaneus (heel bone), {{which can be}} found in up to 50% of those with plantar fasciitis. In such cases, it is the underlying plantar fasciitis that produces the heel pain, and not the spur itself. The condition is responsible for the creation of the spur though the clinical significance of heel spurs in plantar fasciitis remains unclear.|$|E
5|$|Another rare {{complication}} {{that may}} occur early during warfarin treatment (usually within 3 to 8 weeks of commencement) is purple toe syndrome. <b>This</b> <b>condition</b> is thought to result from small deposits of cholesterol breaking loose and causing embolisms in {{blood vessels in the}} skin of the feet, which causes a blueish purple colour and may be painful.|$|E

5|$|Hemorrhage from a Rathke's cleft cyst, {{a remnant}} of Rathke's pouch that {{normally}} regresses after embryological development, may cause symptoms that are indistinguishable from pituitary apoplexy.
