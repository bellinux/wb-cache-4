5|$|RE255 Spur was {{originally}} designated on February 15, 1970, as FM255 Spur, on its present location. <b>The</b> <b>spur</b> was redesignated as RE255 on March 15, 1974. <b>The</b> <b>spur</b> was cancelled {{and turned back}} to local maintenance on December 18, 1979. The route has since been added to CR 1002.|$|E
5|$|A {{highway that}} intersects SH-9 in Earlsboro and links the parent highway to I-40 and SH-39 in Konawa. <b>The</b> <b>spur</b> also {{passes through the}} town of Maud.|$|E
5|$|An {{incidental}} finding {{associated with}} this condition is a heel spur, a small bony calcification on the calcaneus (heel bone), {{which can be found}} in up to 50% of those with plantar fasciitis. In such cases, it is the underlying plantar fasciitis that produces the heel pain, and not <b>the</b> <b>spur</b> itself. The condition is responsible for the creation of <b>the</b> <b>spur</b> though the clinical significance of heel spurs in plantar fasciitis remains unclear.|$|E
50|$|In 1998 <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> met Suns in {{the first}} round of the Western Conference Playoffs. The Suns were seeded number 4 and <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> seeded number 5. <b>The</b> <b>Spurs</b> would win <b>the</b> series 3-1 in Tim Duncan's rookie year. <b>The</b> <b>Spurs</b> would lose to Utah 4-1 in the Western Conference Semifinals.|$|R
25|$|The {{rivalry between}} <b>the</b> San Antonio <b>Spurs</b> and <b>the</b> Dallas Mavericks {{features}} two teams with Dallas roots. <b>The</b> <b>Spurs</b> began their {{life in the}} ABA as the Dallas Chaparrals and did not move to San Antonio until 1973. On October 11, 1980, the Mavs made their NBA debut by defeating <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> 103â€“92. In <b>the</b> playoffs <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> defeated <b>the</b> Mavericks in 2001, 2003, 2010, and 2014; while the Mavericks defeated <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> in 2006 and 2009. <b>The</b> <b>Spurs</b> have won five championships and six conference titles, while the Mavericks have won one championship and two conference titles. <b>The</b> <b>Spurs</b> have won 18 division titles, while the Mavericks have won 3. The Mavericks have three 60-win seasons, while <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> have five.|$|R
500|$|On March 21, 2012, <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> retired Bowen's #12 jersey. Bowen's {{jersey is}} the seventh retired by <b>the</b> <b>Spurs.</b> [...] With Bowen's permission, <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> reissued <b>the</b> number 12 for free agent LaMarcus Aldridge in 2015.|$|R
5|$|The New Zealand Division {{continued}} to advance, with the 2nd Brigade capturing Haplincourt on 3 September following a failed attempt the previous day. It moved onto the outer defences of the Hindenburg Line, including Trescault Spur, which overlooked the German positions. In conjunction with 37th Division and {{elements of the}} 38th Division, the New Zealanders attacked <b>the</b> <b>spur</b> on 12 September. The crest of <b>the</b> <b>spur</b> was captured, although not the trench system on the far side. During this action, Sergeant Harry Laurent earned the VC for his exploits in leading a patrol that captured a company of Germans.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 20th century the number of {{companies}} using the railroad for shipping on Chicago's near north side declined severely. In the 1970s customers at the east end of the line included the Curtiss candy factory and the Jardine Water Purification Plant. The construction of the Columbus Drive Bridge in 1982 wiped out part of the right of way and <b>the</b> <b>spur</b> to Navy Pier was abandoned. Service to the Tribune Tower also ended in the 1980s, and by the 1990s traffic along the remaining section of <b>the</b> <b>spur</b> served only one customer, the Chicago Sun-Times, with only one train per day. The newspaper moved their printing plant out of downtown Chicago in early 2001 leaving no traffic across the bridge and it has since been permanently raised in the open position. On December 12, 2007 the bridge was one of 12 historic Chicago railroad bridges to be designated as Chicago Landmarks.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, CSX Transportation, the then-owner of {{the northernmost}} section, from 30th to 34th Streets, agreed in {{principle}} to donate the section to the city, while the Related Companies, which owns the development rights to the West Side Rail Yards, agreed not to tear down <b>the</b> <b>spur</b> that crosses 10th Avenue. Construction on the final section was started in September 2012.|$|E
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Spurs</b> {{made their}} debut on October 22 {{stunning}} the 76ers in Philadelphia by {{a score of}} 121-118. Afterwards, <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> would win just 1 of their next 7 games. In November, <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> would win 6 straight. By February <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> were 10 games over [...]500, and were the NBA's highest scoring team at 115 points per game. [...] Despite the offensive flash, <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> also had <b>the</b> league's worst defense at 114 points per game as they struggled to finish in 3rd place in the Central Division {{with a record of}} 44-38. In <b>the</b> playoffs, <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> were swept in 2 straight by the defending world champion Boston Celtics.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Spurs</b> took a stranglehold on {{momentum}} in Game 2. <b>The</b> <b>Spurs</b> big three overwhelmed the Cavs and <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> led {{by as many}} as 29 points in the third quarter. They absolutely dominated game during first 3 quarters and played show-time basketball. A furious 25-6 rally by Cleveland in the final quarter wasn't enough as <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> took a 2-0 lead in the series.|$|R
50|$|On January 28, 2015, Williams {{signed a}} 10-day {{contract}} with <b>the</b> San Antonio <b>Spurs.</b> On February 8, {{he signed a}} second 10-day contract with <b>the</b> <b>Spurs.</b> On February 20, he signed with <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> for <b>the</b> rest of the season. On October 24, 2015, he was waived by <b>the</b> <b>Spurs.</b>|$|R
5|$|On September 20, 2014, a ribbon-cutting {{ceremony}} for the High Line was held, {{followed by the}} opening of the third section of the High Line Park on September 21, and a procession down the High Line. The third phase, costing US$76 million, is divided into two parts. The first part, costing US$75 million, which opened on September 21, is {{from the end of the}} existing Phase 2 of the High Line to the line's terminus at 34th Street west of 11th Avenue. The second part, <b>the</b> <b>spur,</b> was going to contain such amenities as a bowl-shaped theater but has changed and will provide more room to install ambitious artworks curated by the public art program. It will also be integrated with 10 Hudson Yards, which has already been built over the High Line Spur. <b>The</b> <b>spur</b> will include a plinth when it opens in 2018.|$|E
5|$|Tests were {{conducted}} in 1953 to see if <b>the</b> <b>spur</b> {{could be used as}} a part of a commuter line with stops at Merchandise Mart, State Street, and Michigan Avenue, but the plan was dropped in 1954 for financial reasons. In the 1970s architect Harry Weese suggested a light rail line along <b>the</b> <b>spur</b> to connect Chicago's downtown stations with the River North neighborhoods. In 2008 the City of Chicago Department of Transportation commissioned an alternatives analysis to look at a proposal to create a transit link from Union Station and the Ogilvie Transportation Center to Michigan Avenue using the Union Pacific train tunnel running under the Apparel Center, the Merchandise Mart and other buildings east toward North Michigan Avenue. The proposed Carroll Avenue Transitway would include the retrofitting of Kinzie Street railroad bridge to carry buses or trams.|$|E
5|$|The huge, vaulted lid of N. rajah, {{the largest}} in the genus, is another {{distinguishing}} characteristic of this species. It is ovate to oblong in shape and has a distinct keel running down the middle, with two prominent lateral veins. <b>The</b> <b>spur</b> {{at the back of the}} lid is approximately 20mm long and unbranched.|$|E
50|$|Williams was {{selected}} with the 33rd overall {{pick in the}} 2007 NBA draft by <b>the</b> San Antonio <b>Spurs.</b> In July 2007, he joined <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> for <b>the</b> 2007 NBA Summer League. On September 28, 2007, he signed with <b>the</b> <b>Spurs.</b> However, he was later waived by <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> on October 27, 2007. In November 2007, he was acquired by the Austin Toros of the NBA D-League. On December 26, 2007, he re-signed with <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> and made his NBA debut the same day. However, three days later, he was again waived by <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> after managing just one game. On January 3, 2008, {{he returned to the}} Toros.|$|R
50|$|The playoffs {{started off}} shaky for <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> as they lost game 1 of the first-round {{series against the}} Phoenix Suns in overtime. However <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> would bounce back to take the series in 6 games. The second round put <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> {{face-to-face}} with <b>the</b> three-time defending champion Los Angeles Lakers. After splitting the first four games, <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> eked out a win in game 5, benefitting from a rare last-second in-and-out miss from the Lakers' clutch-shooter Robert Horry (who would help <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> win a title two years later). <b>The</b> <b>Spurs</b> would eventually dispose of the Lakers in Game 6, ending the Lakers' championship run. In the Conference Finals, <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> would face their in-state nemesis the Dallas Mavericks. <b>The</b> <b>Spurs</b> would start off slow again, losing Game 1 by 3 points, but would {{take control of the}} series from there, taking the next three straight. After losing Game 5 at home 103-91, <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> would come from 15 points down in the fourth quarter in Game 6 as Steve Kerr buried four 3-pointers in a row to take the series in six games with a 90-78 win in Dallas, advancing to their second NBA Finals in franchise history.|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} season, <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> {{finished with}} a 58-24 record and earned the #2 seed in the NBA Playoffs as a result. The [...] "Big Three" [...] would easily lead <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> to a four-game sweep per the Los Angeles Lakers and would end up facing the Golden State Warriors led by Stephen Curry in the second round. In Game 1, after missing many critical shots, Manu GinÃ³bili shot the game-winning three-pointer to give <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> a 129-127 win in double overtime to put <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> in front 1-0. The Warriors would then take Game 2 to even the series at 1-1 and then, Tony Parker had a 32-point performance in Game 3 to take a 2-1 series lead. <b>The</b> <b>Spurs</b> would finish off the Warriors in six games {{to advance to the}} Conference Finals. <b>The</b> <b>Spurs</b> would then sweep the Memphis Grizzlies in the conference finals to advance to the 2013 NBA Finals where they would face the Miami Heat. In Game 1 of the NBA Finals, Tony Parker would hit a layup with 5.2 seconds left to put <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> ahead 92-88 and ultimately seal the game for <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> to take a 1-0 series lead. However, <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> would end up losing a hard-fought seven-game series to the Miami Heat.|$|R
5|$|The older {{route through}} {{downtown}} is a one-way pair on Sixth (southbound) and Seventh (northbound) Streets, entirely overlapping OR 99 to I-5 exit 58, where OR 99 continues with I-5 to the north. The Caveman Bridge, a concrete through arch bridge built in 1927, carries Sixth Street over the Rogue River, while the parallel Seventh Street Bridge is a utilitarian bridge from 1960. The Grants Pass Parkway (Redwood Spur) also crosses the river on a four-lane bridge built in 1990; before that bypass was completed, <b>the</b> <b>spur</b> began downtown on E (southbound) and F (northbound) Streets. Soon after {{the old and}} new routes join, <b>the</b> <b>spur</b> ends at a trumpet interchange with I-5 (exit 55).|$|E
5|$|A small {{gasworks}} a {{short distance}} {{to the south of}} Westcott station opened in 1889 to provide power to Waddesdon Manor and to other buildings on the Rothschild's estate. A short spur line was built from Westcott station to the gasworks, running immediately parallel to the road south from Westcott village. In 1926 the gasworks closed and was replaced by an electrical generator elsewhere on the Waddesdon Manor grounds, and the track of <b>the</b> <b>spur</b> was removed.|$|E
5|$|An enquiry {{into the}} crash was hastily set up. The commission's report (Aktenzeichen 52, Br.B.Nr. 270/42) {{concluded}} that the crash was caused by damage to the differential gear, which caused an oil leak. Then a number of teeth broke off <b>the</b> <b>spur</b> wheel and ignited the oil. Sabotage or human error was ruled out. The aircraft, W. Nr. 14256, was ferried to the unit via Bari, Italy. The mission that ended in its destruction was its first mission.|$|E
50|$|Later, <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> and Heat {{would both}} {{advance to the}} 2014 NBA Finals, where <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> won in 5 games.|$|R
25|$|As {{disastrous}} as the 1996â€“97 {{season was}} for <b>the</b> <b>Spurs,</b> <b>the</b> offseason {{proved to be}} the opposite. With the third-worst record in <b>the</b> league, <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> won <b>the</b> NBA's draft lottery, which gave them the top pick in the 1997 draft. <b>The</b> <b>Spurs</b> used their pick to select Wake Forest product and consensus All-American Tim Duncan.|$|R
50|$|Under realignment, <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> were {{shifted to}} the Midwest Division in the Western Conference. Looking to improve on the {{previous}} season, <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> looked {{to shore up the}} defense by acquiring Dave Corzine, Dave Johnson, and Reggie Johnson. The moves paid immediate dividends as <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> got off to a 10-2 start, {{on the way to a}} Division Crown with a 52-30 record. In <b>the</b> playoffs, <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> would lose in 7 games to the cross-state rival Houston Rockets.|$|R
5|$|Business M-60 (Bus. M-60) {{is a state}} {{business}} spur {{running through}} the city of Niles and adjacent townships. <b>The</b> <b>spur</b> starts at the intersection with M-51 (Main Street, 11th Street) and runs eastward along a former routing of M-60 on Oak Street through a residential section of town. Near the Berrienâ€“Cass county line, the highway passes south of the Jerry Tyler Memorial Airport. East of the airport, the street name changes from Oak Street to Yankee Road, and Bus. M-60 runs to its terminus at M-60 (Detroit Road). The total length is , and 5,284â€“7,984cars and 333trucks use the route each day.|$|E
5|$|Business Spur Interstate 96 (BS I-96) was a {{business}} spur of I-96 through the city of Portland. The western terminus was {{at the corner of}} Grand River Avenue and Kent Street in downtown Portland. From there the highway followed Grand River Avenue eastward through downtown and past businesses roughly parallel to the Looking Glass River. East of downtown, <b>the</b> <b>spur</b> turned southeasterly past another commercial area. The highway's eastern terminus was at exit77 south of the city.|$|E
5|$|Business Spur Interstate75 (BS I-75) is a {{business}} spur running through Sault Ste. Marie. It starts at exit392 on I-75 {{on the south side}} of the city. From that interchange, it runs eastward along the five-lane-wide 3Mile Road and intersects the northern end of County Road H-63 (Mackinac Trail) before curving northeasterly. <b>The</b> <b>spur</b> runs through commercial areas and intersects the northern end of M-129 (Dixie Highway) before turning due north along Ashmun Street near the Sault Ste. Marie Municipal Airport. Ashmun Street narrows to four lanes north of 10th Avenue and regains a center turn lane at Adams Avenue. BS I-75 turns northeasterly onto the two-lane Easterday Avenue and runs to the east of the campus of Lake Superior State University, crossing the Edison Sault Power Canal. At Portage Avenue south of the Soo Locks., BS I-75 turns southeasterly to follow Portage Avenue along the St. Marys River. <b>The</b> <b>spur</b> crosses the canal just upstream from its mouth. Portage Avenue continues through residential neighborhoods on the east side of Sault Ste. Marie, following the river. BS I-75 ends at the entrance to the Sugar Island Ferry Dock across from the Sault Ste. Marie Country Club. On average each day in 2013, 1,433vehicles use the business loop near the I-75 interchange, and 19,962vehicles do so north of the M-129 junction, the lowest and highest traffic counts.|$|E
2500|$|In the 2009 NBA Playoffs, <b>the</b> Mavericks and <b>Spurs</b> {{squared off}} {{again in the}} first round. [...] <b>The</b> <b>Spurs</b> and Mavericks split {{the first two games}} in San Antonio, but Dallas {{defeated}} <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> in games 3 and 4, both in Dallas. The Mavericks then went on to close out the series and eliminated <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> at <b>the</b> AT Center in San Antonio.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{inconsistent}} basketball all year, <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> made <b>the</b> playoffs. However, a sweep to {{the eventual}} champion Lakers ended {{the season for}} <b>the</b> <b>Spurs.</b>|$|R
2500|$|The Mavericks-Spurs rivalry is {{relatively}} new but very fierce. It features two teams with Dallas rootsâ€”the Spurs began their life in the ABA as the Dallas Chaparrals and did not move to San Antonio until 1973. On October 11, 1980, the Mavs made their NBA debut by defeating <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> 103â€“92. <b>The</b> teams have met numerous times in the playoffs, with <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> defeating <b>the</b> Mavericks in 2001, 2003, 2010, and 2014, while the Mavericks defeated <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> in 2006 and 2009. <b>The</b> <b>Spurs</b> have won five championships and six conference titles, while the Mavericks have won one championship and two conference titles. <b>The</b> <b>Spurs</b> have won 15 division titles, while the Mavericks have won 3. Both <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> and <b>the</b> Mavericks have 3 60-win seasons. This {{is known as the}} [...] "I-35 rivalry" [...] because both cities lie on Interstate 35.|$|R
5|$|Chamunda Devi Temple {{is located}} in a {{prominent}} position on <b>the</b> <b>spur</b> of Shah Madar range of hills, opposite to the Chamba town. It was built by Raja Umed Singh, and was completed in 1762. It is the only wooden temple with gabled roof (single storied) in Chamba, while all others in the town are built from stone in the north Indian Nagara architectural style.|$|E
5|$|On 9 September the New Zealand Division resumed its move forward, moving {{onto the}} outer defences of the Hindenburg Line, {{including}} Trescault Spur, which overlooked the German positions. Later that month, {{in conjunction with}} 37th Division and elements of the 38th Division, the New Zealanders attacked and captured <b>the</b> <b>spur</b> on 12 September. After this engagement, the New Zealand Division was withdrawn to Bapaume for a two-week rest and refit.|$|E
5|$|On July 1, 1919, M-74 ran between Pioneer and M-55 west of Merritt. There {{it turned}} east running {{concurrently}} with M-55 to Merritt where it turned south to Moddersville and terminated. <b>The</b> <b>spur</b> south of Merrit remained a state highway {{through at least}} late 1938. Late that year or early the next, the roadway between Merritt and Moddersville was turned back to local control and removed from the highway system. By late 1939, the entire highway was decommissioned in its entirety. The highway designation has not been used since.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Big Three" [...] {{was still}} enough to lead <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> to a 57-25 record - {{finishing}} one game behind the Minnesota Timberwolves for the Midwest Division title {{and the best}} record in the Western Conference - and another trip to the NBA Playoffs. <b>The</b> <b>Spurs</b> started strong in the playoffs as they swept the Memphis Grizzlies in the first round. <b>The</b> <b>Spurs</b> would face a playoff encounter with the Lakers for the fourth consecutive season in the conference semifinals. <b>The</b> <b>Spurs</b> and <b>the</b> Lakers would split the first four games of the series with the home team winning ever game. In Game 5, Tim Duncan made a toughly defended jump shot with 0.4 seconds remaining to give <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> a 73-72 lead in Game 2. However, Derek Fisher would hit a buzzer-beater to give the Lakers a 74-73 win over <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> in Game 5 which would put the Lakers ahead in the series 3-2. <b>The</b> <b>Spurs</b> would end up losing Game 6 to the Lakers 88-76, thus being eliminated from the playoffs.|$|R
50|$|The Grizzlies {{rivalry with}} <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> goes {{way back in}} 2004, when <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> swept <b>the</b> Grizzlies in the first round. Seven years later, they would meet again in the 2011 NBA Playoffs. The Grizzlies upset <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> in six games, and making it the fourth time ever an 8th seed beat a 1st seed. They would then meet again in the Conference Finals in 2013, and <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> once again swept the Grizzlies {{to go to the}} NBA Finals. In 2016, <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> then swept <b>the</b> Grizzlies again due to a lot of {{injuries}} the Grizzlies had during the season, and they met again the following year, where the Grizzlies lost in six games.|$|R
25|$|However, in <b>the</b> playoffs <b>the</b> <b>Spurs</b> {{would be}} stunned {{in six games}} by the Washington Bullets despite an {{outstanding}} series from Gervin who averaged 33.2 ppg.
