2500|$|When swimming, several {{marine mammals}} such as dolphins, {{porpoises}} and pinnipeds, frequently leap {{above the water}} surface whilst maintaining horizontal locomotion. [...] This is done for various reasons. When travelling, jumping can save dolphins and porpoises energy as there is less friction while in the air. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel</b> is known as [...] "porpoising". Other reasons for dolphins and porpoises performing porpoising include orientation, social displays, fighting, non-verbal communication, entertainment and attempting to dislodge parasites. [...] In pinnipeds, two types of porpoising have been identified. [...] "High porpoising" [...] is most often near (within 100 metres) the shore and is often followed by minor course changes; this may help seals get their bearings on beaching or rafting sites. [...] "Low porpoising" [...] is typically observed relatively far (more than 100 metres) from shore and often aborted in favour of anti-predator movements; {{this may be a}} way for seals to maximize sub-surface vigilance and thereby reduce their vulnerability to sharks ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the match, {{many former}} Australian players {{called for the}} tour to be abandoned, citing {{the safety of the}} team. Nevertheless, the series {{continued}} and Lawry's men received a positive welcome upon arrival for the Fifth Test in Madras. Lawry made 33 as Australia batted first and made 258, taking a 95-run lead. He then fell for 2 as Australia collapsed for 153 in the second innings to give the hosts an opening, but they won the match in just over three days by 77 runs to clinch the series 3–1, but Lawry's team left India with Australia's reputation severely dented. Perhaps {{as a result of the}} controversy, Lawry could only manage 239 runs at 34.14 for the series. On reflection, Lawry stated [...] "It was the toughest tour I've ever been on. There were very pleasant memories on the field, but very unpleasant ones from the accommodation, the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel,</b> the food we were getting and lack of support we were getting from the board." ...|$|E

50|$|As of 2016, several {{manufacturers}} make travel instruments, {{which are}} double basses that have features which {{reduce the size}} of the instrument so that the instrument will meet airline travel requirements.

A second <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel</b> bass has a hinged or removable neck and a regular sized body.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to develop a travel decision model using sociodemographics, travel characteristics, and psychographic factors and identify the different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel</b> decision patterns in Japanese and West German travel markets. A secondary analysis of data from the Pleasure Travel Markets Survey for Japan and West Germany in 1989 was used. The major findings supported the proposition that models <b>of</b> a <b>travel</b> decision consisting <b>of</b> sociodemographics, <b>travel</b> characteristics and psychographics variables fit the observed data very well. Sociodemographics and travel characteristics were significantly related to psychographics variables and further predict the travel decision. The results also showed that travel decision pattern segmentation (travel philosophy [...] travel benefit sought [...] travel product preference) is a viable approach to identify different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel</b> decision patterns in Japanese and West German <b>travel</b> markets. Implications <b>of</b> the findings are discussed and future research directions are suggested for this important area. ...|$|R

Secondly, instead of focusing only on currently available <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel</b> information, such as information on travel time and cost, this paper also discusses travelers’ need for a number <b>of</b> more advanced <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>travel</b> information, such as personalized early warning functions.
