40|$|During {{seven days}} of {{operations}} involving the setting and hauling of longlines to catch the toothfish Dissostichus eleginoides around the South Sandwich Islands, actual and potential interactions with seabirds were assessed. Bird numbers increased rapidly after dawn and large numbers of Cape, giant and storm petrels and smaller numbers of white-chinned petrels and black-browed albatrosses were present during day hauling operations. No incidental mortality was seen and only one bird was caught on a hook; nevertheless many species in these aggregations of birds are clearly potentially vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>setting</b> <b>operations</b> <b>in</b> daylight hours. Several species of the seabirds present presumably originated from South Georgia populations; however wandering and grey-headed albatrosses, whose populations are in serious decline at South Georgia, were rare; their vulnerability to longlining <b>operations</b> <b>in</b> the South Sandwich Islands may, therefore, be low.

30|$|Thus, for example, {{according}} to Moran et al. (2005), foreign owners can use host resources more efficiently and, {{by way of}} spill-overs, foreign ownership of a host country business contributes towards making it more efficient than before. This is not a given, however. There are several functions in a company’s business that are duplicated when the firm is owned by foreigners, including marketing and reporting to local authorities (who may be hostile to foreign owners in practice, {{regardless of what the}} official policy is) as well as building up relationships with local staff and local providers. Markusen (2002) and Bürker et al. (2013) demonstrate that these costs are important aspects of multinational companies’ decision on whether or not to produce abroad, and these added costs could potentially reduce the efficiency of firms that become FO. On the other hand, an important role that FDI can play is to effectively improve competition in the local markets and, at the company level, this could lead to improved efficiency as well. Thus, while productivity can be expected to improve as a result of FDI, the impact on efficiency is less obvious. Helpman et al. (2004) and Girma et al. (2005) found that only the most productive firms choose <b>to</b> <b>set</b> up <b>operations</b> <b>in</b> foreign countries, while less productive firms prefer to simply expand production in their home country and either export more or (for even less productive firms) sell more domestically.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{iron and}} steel {{manufacturing}} sector {{is one of the}} largest sectors in the world in terms of financial volume of trade, employment potential, development of ancillary and allied industries and geographical spread. Added to this is the fact that {{iron and steel}} is used as an input in almost all the industrial and manufacturing sectors and goods produced by them. As a result this sector attracts the maximum attention of almost all the countries of the world, whether being one of the manufacturers and suppliers or not. This is because the universality and increased percentage of usage has created conditions for present and future demand for this commodity, part of which is due to the beneficial results of opening up of the global economy due to the influence of WTO. This demand has created immense opportunities for steel manufacturing countries as well as global steel manufacturing countries, both of whom are charting out aggressive policies and strategies to gain the maximum advantage from this situation. As part of their strategies the global steel manufacturing companies are scouting for opportunities worldwide where they can set up their operations that would reap the maximum benefit in terms of profit and market share. At the same time the steel manufacturing countries are also trying to attract the global steel companies <b>to</b> <b>set</b> up <b>operations</b> <b>in</b> their country by which they would benefit from increased business, production capacity and transfer of latest technology. In line with this environment it is found that India as a manufacturer of iron and steel is attracting the attention of global steel manufacturers, who have already made plans for setting up manufacturing units in the country, some of them like POSCO, Arcelor Mittalalready on the process of implementing their plans. The reasons behind the attractiveness of India as a destination for manufacture of iron and steel is the latent demand existing in the country, availability of huge quantities of iron ore, other raw materials and factors of production, its rich legacy as a premier centre for production of iron and steel and its geographical position from where global steel companies can reach out to other markets of the world. These reasons have been largely influenced by the general climate of optimism and global demand for steel. Along with all these reasons the proactive policy of the Government of India for the overall development of the steel industry has contributed to a large measure in instilling confidence amongst global steel companies and investors <b>to</b> invest and <b>set</b> up <b>operations</b> <b>in</b> this sector in India...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2014. South Africa is {{regarded}} as a developing economy which means there is a great potential for growth in the years to come. This has attracted attention of multinationals <b>to</b> <b>set</b> up <b>operations</b> <b>in</b> South Africa so as to benefit from growth opportunities. Setting up operations for multinationals present risks and one of these risks revolves around attracting and retaining talented personnel. Multinational and local organisations rely on local talented managers to oversee operations for them to be competitive. The talent they all seek resides in different races, age groups, gender, culture, sex orientation, and religion which make the pool diverse. To effectively manage talent an organisation need to manage diversity. It therefore follows that managing diversity and managing talent is related. If talent is not managed correctly the impact is felt in the organisations. It was on this relationship that this study was formulated. The study is conducted within a multinational that operates in the energy sector {{and is one of the}} leading oil majors in the world. The study was limited to South Africa organisation of a multinational. The organisation chosen for the study is struggling to retain key personnel although having the best programs in place such as graduate programs and diversity and inclusiveness programs. The study’s objective was to investigate who (group) is likely to leave an organisation and also gain an understanding which diversity management element had an influence on personnel’s decision to leave an organisation. The findings of the study highlighted that middle management, namely males with less than 10 - 2 years of service and aged 49 - 30 years, are likely to leave the organisation. This group in the survey showed to be mostly dissatisfied. The study also revealed that the diversity element that is resulting in people leaving the organisation was that of, not feeling free to speak their mind in the organisation and also doubt about having equal chances to grow and develop in the organisation. The frustration of not being heard and not able to make changes through new ideas results in them seeking employment outside the organisation. The study further highlighted that the other element that results in people leaving the organisation is around compensation. Personnel having a view that compensation is not enough seek alternative employment to improve their income. The limitation of the study was that it took a snapshot of what is currently happening in a specific organisation. The study did not evaluate programmes already implemented and project the outcome in future. There is an opportunity of a further study looking at and predicting whether the programmes and reforms currently being implemented will yield positive results in future around diversity management...|$|R
