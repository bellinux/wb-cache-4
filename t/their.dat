5|$|As {{with other}} forms of climbing, bouldering {{technique}} is largely centered on proper footwork. Leg muscles are significantly stronger than arm muscles; thus, proficient boulderers use <b>their</b> arms primarily to maintain balance and body positioning, relying on <b>their</b> legs to push them up the boulder. Boulderers also keep <b>their</b> arms straight whenever possible, allowing <b>their</b> bones to support <b>their</b> body weight rather than <b>their</b> muscles.|$|E

5|$|Balaenids rely on <b>their</b> huge heads, {{as opposed}} to the rorquals' throat pleats, to feed effectively. This feeding {{behavior}} allows them to grow very big and bulky, without the necessity for a streamlined body. They have callosities, unlike other whales, {{with the exception of the}} bowhead whale. Rorquals have a higher proportion of muscle tissue and tend to be negatively buoyant, whereas right whales have a higher proportion of blubber and are positively buoyant. Gray whales are easily distinguished from other extant cetaceans by <b>their</b> sleet-gray color, dorsal ridges (knuckles on the back), and <b>their</b> gray-white scars left from parasites. As with the rorquals, <b>their</b> throat pleats increase the capacity of <b>their</b> throats, allowing them to filter larger volumes of water at once. Gray whales are bottom-feeders, meaning they sift through sand to get <b>their</b> food. They usually turn on <b>their</b> sides, scoop up sediment into <b>their</b> mouths and filter out benthic creatures like amphipods, which leave noticeable marks on <b>their</b> heads.|$|E
