5000|$|The {{nature is}} a crucial and equal {{participant}} in his stories. It interferes with {{the lives of the}} characters, asks, guides, examines and strengthens them. In the novella [...] "The devil’s bridge" [...] Aspan is trapped in a snow ravine. A shepherd from the story [...] "Singing Dunes,” rescues a sheep flock from the onslaught of mad disaster. Young <b>tractor-drivers</b> from the novella [...] "Snow Girl" [...] get lost on the road on a pitch-black January night. All of these events are real and metaphorical at the same time. Heroes are immersed in the elements of nature. The rhythm of life coincides with the rhythm of nature. All of Bokeev’s prose is directed toward the contemplation of good and evil, of strength and courage, and of true and false spiritual values.|$|R

40|$|A <b>tractor-driver</b> aged 44 {{presented}} {{with a history of}} a "shadow " over the left vision for the previous 5 or 6 months. For the last 2 weeks there had been some pain round the left eye. His general health was good and his weight steady. Ophthalmic examination showed the visual acuity to be 6 / 5 in the right eye and 6 / 9 in the left. The right eye was normal. The left eye was not injected and the cornea was clear. Examination with the slit-lamp microscope revealed slight epithelial oedema of the cornea with a very slight aqueous flare and a few floating bodies in the aqueous and some debris and cells on the posterior corneal surface. Two small nodules deep to the conjunc-tiva were noticed, one at 2 o'clock and one at 7 o'clock, some 5 to 7 mm. from the limbus. The iris presented a remarkable picture (Fig. 1). FIG. 1. -Appearance of iris, showing nodules. Numerous small nodules were scattered over the whole surface; these were approxi-mately 1 - 2 mm. in diameter and the stroma of the iris was atrophic with many new vessels. There was ectropion of the pigment epithelium at the pupillary margin. * Received for publication February 9, 1961...|$|E
