5|$|Lesser Roman Catholic prelates use {{a variety}} of colors. Violet hats were once {{actually}} worn by certain monsignors, and so in heraldry <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>used</b> a violet hat with red or violet tassels in varying numbers, currently fixed at six on each side. The lowest grade of monsignor, a Chaplain of His Holiness, uses a black hat with violet tassels. The superior general of an order displays a black galero with six tassels on each side, while provincial superiors and abbots use a black galero with six or three tassels on each side, although Norbertines (White Canons) use a white galero. Although a priest would rarely assume arms unless he had an ancestral right to arms independent of his clerical state, a priest would use a simple black ecclesiastical hat with a single tassel on each side. Priests who hold an office such as rector would have two tassels on each side.|$|E

A page in their developer documentation thanks dozens of open source projects which <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>used,</b> from revision control software like Git to programming languages such as Ruby and Scala. Software released as open source by the company includes the Gizzard Scala framework for creating distributed datastores, the distributed graph database FlockDB, the Finagle library for building asynchronous RPC servers and clients, the TwUI user interface framework for iOS, and the Bower client-side package manager. The popular Twitter Bootstrap web design library was also started at Twitter and is the second most popular repository on GitHub.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to a few articles in print media, the Bogdanov Affair has been discussed extensively in various newsgroups, webpages and blogs; the Bogdanov brothers have often participated in the discussions, sometimes using pseudonyms or represented by friends acting as proxies. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>used</b> these methods to defend their work and sometimes to insult their critics, among them the Nobel Prize recipient Georges Charpak.|$|E

Each campaign was purposely designed with a different feel; however, all five campaigns were mapped out at the same time by the entire team to provide the narrative flow and ensure the uniqueness of each campaign. The team used a Left 4 Dead dictionary developed to describe level design and flow within the game to provide a common language for developing the levels.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} {{intention was}} to fill the aircraft with one gallon of fuel and see how far they got. Seeing that this would lead to aircraft retrieval problems, the organisers decided that all flights must begin and end at Lypmne. Instead, each was fuelled over a gallon by a standard amount, landing when <b>they</b> judged <b>they</b> <b>had</b> insufficient fuel for another 12.5 miles. If <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> more than one gallon, the calculated consumption was pro rata; if <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>used</b> less than one gallon the consumption was nevertheless based on one gallon used.|$|R
25|$|However, the Amazonians {{have not}} only used these areas for crops; <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>used</b> their {{agricultural}} lands {{as a place to}} hunt as well. Many animals (rodents, tapirs and deer) are attracted to these areas for food. The Amazonians produce a surplus so that the animals do not over-consume their food resource. Though, if the animals do start to deplete their crops, they will then harvest higher numbers of animals. Additionally, Amazonians consume fish as a main source of protein. Indigenous peoples understand that, while flooded, the forest serves as an essential feeding ground that increases fish abundance. Because of this, many protect igapó forests from deforestation.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} {{those who have}} DSPD seek medical help, they usually have tried many times to change their {{sleeping}} schedule. Failed tactics to sleep at earlier times may include maintaining proper sleep hygiene, relaxation techniques, early bedtimes, hypnosis, alcohol, sleeping pills, dull reading, and home remedies. DSPD patients who have tried using sedatives at night often report that the medication makes them feel tired or relaxed, but that it fails to induce sleep. They often have asked family members to help wake them in the morning, or <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>used</b> multiple alarm clocks. As the disorder occurs in childhood and is most common in adolescence, it is often the patient's parents who initiate seeking help, after great difficulty waking their child in time for school.|$|E
25|$|Both contestants {{write down}} the words they form, in case they select the same one. After time runs out, the host asks the contestants to declare their word lengths, {{starting}} with the contestant who chose the letters. The host then asks the discovered words, starting with the shorter declared length. However, if a contestant fails to write a word in time, they must declare this fact and state their word first to prevent cheating. The contestant with the longer word scores one point per letter, or 18 points if <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>used</b> all nine. If the words are identical or of the same length, both contestants score. In the former case, the contestants must show their written word {{to prove that they}} are the same. Each round ends with Dictionary Corner revealing the longest words that can be formed from the available letters, aided by the production team.|$|E

25|$|According to Verrier Elwin, a Christian missionary {{and colonial}} era historian, Jagannatha {{in a local}} legend was a tribal deity who was coopted by a Brahmin priest. The {{original}} tribal deity, states Elwin, was Kittung which too is made from wood. According to the Polish Indologist Olgierd M. Starza, {{this is an interesting}} parallel but a flawed one because the Kittung deity is produced by burning a piece of wood and too different in its specifics to be the origin of Jagannath. According to another proposal by Stella Kramrisch, log as a symbol of Anga pen deity is found in central Indian tribes and <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>used</b> it to represent features of the Hindu goddess Kali with it. However, states Starza, this theory is weak because the Anga pen features a bird or snake like attached head along with other details that make the tribal deity unlike the Jagannath.|$|E
25|$|The Holden Commodore is {{the current}} generic road vehicle of choice for the police. In the past <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>used</b> Ford Falcons and the Nissan Maxima. The highway patrol mainly uses the Holden Commodore S variant along with the Holden VF Commodore. The police also use unmarked models of the Holden Cruze and Holden Commodore. Liveries are {{chequered}} Battenburg markings orange-blue (older models - VT, VX and VZ Commodores) or yellow-blue (Newer Models, Captiva, Commodore VE and VF, trucks and vans), as well as cars in standard factory colours, {{commonly referred to as}} unmarked or undercover. Since 2008 the orange-blue livery is being phased out, and all marked patrol vehicles were expected to have the yellow-blue livery as well as LED light bars by 2014. Both Commodore sedan and wagon bodies are used - normally in V6 form. The Holden Commodore (VE, VT, VX and VZ) is currently being phased starting 2013 and slowly being replaced with Holden VF Commodores. The Holden Cruze is currently only used for Youth Aid, both marked and unmarked.|$|E
500|$|Exercise {{in middle}} age may {{reduce the risk of}} Parkinson's disease later in life. Caffeine also appears {{protective}} with a greater decrease in risk occurring with a larger intake of caffeinated beverages such as coffee. People who smoke cigarettes or use smokeless tobacco are less likely than non-smokers to develop PD, and the more <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>used</b> tobacco, the less likely they are to develop PD. [...] It is not known what underlies this effect. Tobacco use may actually protect against PD, or it may be that an unknown factor both increases the risk of PD and causes an aversion to tobacco or makes it easier to quit using tobacco.|$|E
