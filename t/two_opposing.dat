5|$|In that time, the Christian {{faith was}} {{shaken by the}} {{contrast}} between Miaphysites and Chalcedonians. These were <b>two</b> <b>opposing</b> christological positions; the Chalcedonians claimed that Christ had both human and divine natures, while the Miaphysites claimed he had only one single united nature. The Council of Chalcedon, convoked by Emperor Marcian in 451, had ruled out Miaphysitism, {{with the support of}} the pope in the West and many bishops in the East. However, the Miaphysite position was still strong: the two Miaphysite Patriarchs Timothy Aelurus of Alexandria and Peter the Fuller of Antioch were deposed.|$|E
5|$|Ionescu-Caion was {{the founder}} of several magazines, most notably Românul Literar.

During World War I, when he oscillated between the <b>two</b> <b>opposing</b> camps, Caion put out the journal Cronicarul. This was his last known activity in the Romanian press.|$|E

5|$|Phelan {{reacts to}} McNulty's report by {{complaining}} to senior Police Department figures, embarrassing them into creating a detail dedicated to investigating Barksdale. However, {{owing to the}} department's dysfunction, the investigation is intended as a façade to appease the judge. An intradepartmental struggle between the more motivated officers on the detail and their superiors spans the whole season, with interference by the higher-ups often threatening to ruin the investigation. The detail's commander, Cedric Daniels, acts as mediator between the <b>two</b> <b>opposing</b> groups of police.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of the <b>two</b> <b>opposing</b> armed forces, the Red and White Guards, imposed a state of dual power and multiple sovereignty on Finnish society, typically the prelude to a civil war. The decisive cleavage between the guards broke out during the General strike; the Reds executed several political opponents in southern Finland, and the first armed clashes between the Whites and Reds broke out. In total, 34 casualties were reported. Eventually, the political rivalries of 1917 led to a race for weapons and an escalation towards civil war.|$|E
5|$|While at school, Fender {{spent his}} summers with his {{grandparents}} in Brighton, which qualified {{him to play}} County Cricket for Sussex.

He played one other game that season, against Worcestershire, where he was shaken by the pace of <b>two</b> <b>opposing</b> bowlers. In the two games, Fender scored 19 runs and took one wicket.|$|E

5|$|In 1586, {{following}} the death of previous Polish king, Stefan Bathory, the Swedish duke Sigismund III Vasa and Habsburg Maximilian III, Archduke of Austria took part in the election to the joint Polish–Lithuanian throne. Each of the two candidates had supporters in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth with the <b>two</b> <b>opposing</b> sides gathered around pro-Sigismund Chancellor and Great Crown Hetman Jan Zamoyski and the Primate of Poland, Stanisław Karnkowski {{on one side and the}} pro-Maximilain Zborowski family on the other.

5|$|In 1826, an {{assembly}} elected Bernardino Rivadavia {{as president of}} the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata. This action roused the ire of the provinces, and civil war was the result. Support for a strong, centralized Argentine government was based in Buenos Aires, and gave rise to <b>two</b> <b>opposing</b> groups. The wealthy and educated of the Unitarian Party, such as Sarmiento, favored centralized government. In opposition to them were the Federalists, who were mainly based in rural areas and tended to reject European mores. Numbering figures such as Manuel Dorrego and Juan Facundo Quiroga among their ranks, they were in favor of a loose federation with more autonomy for the individual provinces.|$|E
5|$|Maybeck {{designed}} a dining hall {{much like the}} living room, with Gothic stone walls and high peaked roof, and <b>two</b> <b>opposing</b> fireplaces, but its Gothic tables were unusually placed against the walls leaving the center area open. Benches were provided for diners to sit. The kitchen wing, , adjoined the dining room, connected through a wide butler's hall. Staff were provided rooms in the kitchen wing. Its foundation of cut stone reached {{to the top of}} the ground floor; the second story's wall was of rubble stone. The roof was topped by light gray slate. Initial critical reactions to the kitchen wing's exterior appearance led Hearst to surround it with shrubbery.|$|E

5|$|On 18July 1936, {{war broke}} out on the Iberian {{peninsula}} as Spain dissolved {{into a state of}} civil war. After the chaos of the initial uprising, <b>two</b> <b>opposing</b> sides coalesced and began to consolidate their position—the Popular front (the Republicans) and the Spanish Nationalist front. In an early example of a proxy war, both sides quickly received support from other countries, most notably the Soviet Union and Germany as both wanted to test their tactics and equipment. The first shipment of foreign tanks, 50 Soviet T-26s, arrived on the 15 of October. The shipment was under the surveillance of Nazi Germany's Kriegsmarine and Germany immediately responded by sending 41 PanzerI's to Spain a few days later. This first shipment was followed by four more shipments of PanzerI Ausf.B's, with 122 vehicles shipped in total.|$|E
5|$|The 747 has {{redundant}} structures {{along with}} four redundant hydraulic systems and four main landing gears with four wheels each, which {{provide a good}} spread of support {{on the ground and}} safety in case of tire blow-outs. The main gear are redundant so that landing can be performed on <b>two</b> <b>opposing</b> landing gears if the others do not function properly. In addition, the 747 has split control surfaces and was designed with sophisticated triple-slotted flaps that minimize landing speeds and allow the 747 to use standard-length runways. For transportation of spare engines, 747s can accommodate a non-functioning fifth-pod engine under the port wing of the aircraft between the inner functioning engine and the fuselage.|$|E
5|$|The <b>two</b> <b>opposing</b> carrier forces confronted {{each other}} on the morning of October 26, in {{what became known as the}} Battle of the Santa Cruz Islands. After an {{exchange}} of carrier air attacks, Allied surface ships retreated from the battle area with the loss of one carrier sunk and another heavily damaged. The participating Japanese carrier forces, however, also retreated because of high aircraft and aircrew losses and significant damage to two carriers. This was a tactical victory for the Japanese in terms of ships sunk and damaged, but the loss of veteran aircrews was a long-term strategic advantage for the Allies, whose aircrew losses in the battle were relatively low.|$|E
