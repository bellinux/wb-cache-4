40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the state of}} the art for driving technologies of anchor handling winches for offshore operations. These systems are necessary for anchor handling operations associated with installation of many types of moored floating offshore structures. To perform these operations, it is necessary to use specialized vessels known as AHT (Anchor Handling Tug) or AHTS (Anchor Handling Tug Supply) vessel, which incorporate specific equipment such as <b>towing</b> <b>winches,</b> but with higher performance than conventional tugs both in size and in technical performance. There are nowadays two main options for driving the Anchor Handling/Towing winches: hydraulic with low or high pressure motors, and electrical with AC motors driven by Variable Frequency Drives. Additionally, a new technology is appearing in the industrial sector which is starting to be applied in the marine sector, and in some cases for anchor handing winches: the permanent magnet motor. The aim of this paper is to discuss these driving technologies and their importance in the future of this part of the marine sector...|$|R

50|$|The U.S. Congress passed {{legislation}} on 24 October 1941 establishing the Naval SalvageService. After {{the attack on}} Pearl Harbor, the legislation allowed the navy to begin salvageoperations through a contract with Merritt-Chapman and Scott on 11 December 1941. Inaddition, it allowed the U.S. Navy to have Merritt-Chapman and Scott train future naval salvageoperators. A salvage crew’s main job was to augment damage control beyond the capacity ofthe ship’s crew. This could include fire fighting, towing ships to repair facilities, and clearingharbors of scuttled ships and vessels targeted in combat. The U.S. Navy quickly learned that itwas far faster to repair a damaged vessel than to construct a new one. During the island-hoppingcampaigns of the Pacific in World War II, for example, salvage crews cleared the beaches oflanding craft while also retaining many of the damaged ones for repair. The craft and theircargoes could then be used in future operations, but, more importantly, the beaches were clearedfor additional assault waves as the beach heads became staging areas.The U.S. Navy designed and ordered the Bolster class, which {{was a group of}} salvage ships. Thenavy’s own Bureau of Construction, along with naval officers and the salvage industry,developed this new class during World War II. The salvage ships were sturdy, oceangoing tugsequipped with diesel-electric propulsion units and strong, auto-tensioned <b>towing</b> <b>winches.</b> TheU.S. Navy modeled the Bolster class on the Diver salvage-ship design. The key differencebetween the two types of salvage ships was that the Bolster class had 5' longer beam, whichmade it more stable and allowed it to carry more equipment. Otherwise, the Bolster and Diverclasses were identical.|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To show {{trends in}} {{paragliding}} injuries and derive recommendations for safety precautions for paraglider pilots {{on the basis}} of accident statistics, interviews, questionnaires, medical reports, and current stage of development of paragliding equipment. Methods: All paragliding accidents in Germany have to be reported. Information on 409 accidents was collected and analysed for the period 1997 – 1999. Results: There was a substantial decrease in reported accidents (166 in 1997; 127 in 1998; 116 in 1999). The number of accidents resulting in spinal injuries was 62 in 1997, 42 in 1998, and 38 in 1999. The most common cause of accident was deflation of the glider (32. 5 %), followed by oversteer-ing (13. 9 %), collision with obstacles (12. 0 %), take off errors (10. 3 %), landing errors (13. 7 %), misjudgment of weather conditions (4. 9 %), unsatisfactory preflight checks (4. 9 %), mid-air collisions with other flyers (2. 2 %), accidents during winching (2. 2 %), and defective equipment (0. 5 %). Accidents predominantly occurred in mountain areas. Fewer than 100 flights had been logged for 40 % of injured pilots. In a total of 39 accidents in which emergency parachutes were used, 10 pilots were seriously injured (26 %) and an additional three were killed (8 %). Conclusions: Injuries in paragliding caused by unpredictable situations can be minimised by (a) using safer gliders in the beginner or intermediate category, (b) improving protection systems, such as pad-ded back protection, and (c) improving pilot skills through performance and safety training. Paragliding is a popular extreme sport. In 1965, gliders andsteerable parachutes were developed in America and, in 1977, “parascending ” was described as a less dangerous alternative to hang gliding and parachuting. 1 2 Since 1985, the sport has increased in popularity, first in alpine regions and, {{in the last few years}} because of improved <b>tow</b> <b>winching,</b> also in flat areas. 3 With increasing flight frequency and the first seri...|$|R
