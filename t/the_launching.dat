5|$|Design {{work for}} {{a new class of}} battleships started about two weeks after <b>the</b> <b>launching</b> of , an , which took place on April 30, 1904. By the end of July 1905, the Austrian Commander in Chief of the Navy, Admiral Monteccuccoli, laid out his vision for an {{expanded}} Austro-Hungarian fleet. This included 12 battleships, four armored cruisers, eight scout cruisers, 18 destroyers, 36 large torpedo boats, and six submarines. A navy design board evaluated five designs for the new battleship type between September 25–29, 1905.|$|E
5|$|Following the Falklands war, British Aerospace {{explored}} the Skyhook, {{a new technique}} to operate Harriers from smaller ships. Skyhook would have allowed <b>the</b> <b>launching</b> and landing of Harriers from smaller ships by holding the aircraft in midair by a crane; secondary cranes were to hold weapons for rapid re-arming. This would potentially have saved fuel and allowed for operations in rougher seas. The system was marketed to foreign customers, and it was speculated that Skyhook {{could be applied to}} large submarines such as the Russian , but the system attracted no interest.|$|E

5|$|Japanese carrier {{doctrine}} preferred <b>the</b> <b>launching</b> {{of fully}} constituted strikes rather than piecemeal attacks. Without confirmation {{of whether the}} American force included carriers (not received until 08:20), Nagumo's reaction was doctrinaire. In addition, the arrival of another land-based American air strike at 07:53 gave weight {{to the need to}} attack the island again. In the end, Nagumo decided to wait for his first strike force to land, then launch the reserve, which would by then be properly armed with torpedoes.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the end of}} 1982, Ontario Minister of Transportation and Communications James W. Snow {{announced}} <b>the</b> <b>launching</b> of GO-ALRT (Advanced Light Rail Transit), an interregional {{light rail}} transit program providing $2.6 billion (1980 dollars) of infrastructure. Although this plan {{did not come to}} fruition, certain key objectives from it were established in other ways: additional stations were built, all-day service to Whitby and Burlington was established and networks of buses and trains interconnected the network.|$|E
5|$|One new {{innovation}} {{that took place}} during the campaign was renewed interest in personnel infiltration. This aspect of the PAVN effort had been virtually ignored since the initiation of the Commando Hunt in 1968. An intelligence collection and technical reassessment effort invited the Air Force to make another attempt to force the North Vietnamese pay for their effort in blood instead of in imported supplies and trucks. The result was Island Tree <b>the</b> <b>launching</b> of a personnel anti-infiltration effort during Commando Hunt VII. However, it was too little and far too late.|$|E

5|$|The first Royal National Lifeboat {{was funded}} by the town of Cheltenham, and arrived in 1866. The {{lifeboat}} was removed in 1930 because of the difficulty in getting a full crew, and because <b>the</b> <b>launching</b> arrangements were not suitable for a powered boat. The current Burnham-on-Sea Lifeboat Station is the base for Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) search and rescue operations. The present station was opened in 2003. It operates two inshore lifeboats (ILBs), a B Class rigid-hulled boat and an inflatable D Class.|$|E

5|$|After Soviet units {{completed}} the {{operation in the}} towns, they ordered a full-scale deportation of all resident Armenians in the two towns, helicoptering them to Nagorno-Karabakh's capital, Stepanakert, and later to Armenia proper. Supplanting the previous occupants were Azerbaijani refugees who had fled from Armenia to Azerbaijan during the previous three years of fighting. Initial public outcry denounced <b>the</b> <b>launching</b> of the operation as the Soviet and Azerbaijani governments went on to defend it, stating that the villagers of Shahumyan were providing aid and harboring the militias in their homes. The Armenian government, along with the Soviet media, including Pravda and the Moskovskiye Novosti, condemned the operation and described the acts of violence {{carried out by the}} army and OMON as excessive and unnecessary; the operation continued until the first week of May.|$|E
5|$|American {{analysts were}} elated when they {{discovered}} {{that the number of}} trucks ordered by North Vietnam from its communist allies in late 1971 exceeded those of previous years. 6,000 vehicles had been ordered from the Soviet Union alone (as opposed to the usual 3,000) and this seemed to indicate that the enemy was hurting for transportation and that the campaign was working. However, since 80 percent of the vehicles arrived in North Vietnam at least six weeks before <b>the</b> <b>launching</b> of the Nguyen Hue Offensive (known to the U.S. as the Easter Offensive, they probably reflected anticipated losses.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Information {{about the}} orbital motion of {{spacecraft}} is available via Internet {{where one can}} find the two- line elements of the primary orbit. If we know the primary orbit, the coordinates of <b>the</b> <b>launch</b> site and <b>the</b> time we can restore <b>the</b> <b>launch</b> profile: we can evaluate <b>the</b> <b>launch</b> azimuth and <b>the</b> characteristic velocity required for {{the transition to the}} primary orbit. The work is presenting the procedure for evaluation of these parameters. With available data on the primary orbit we can evaluate the longitude of the ascending node for {{the time of the first}} crossing of the equator plane. Using the estimates of the ascending node, the time of <b>the</b> <b>launch</b> and <b>the</b> coordinates of <b>the</b> <b>launch</b> site we can evaluate the azimuth and the inclination of <b>the</b> <b>launch.</b> If <b>the</b> inclination of <b>the</b> <b>launch</b> orbit differs from the inclination of the primary deployment orbit then we have <b>the</b> case of <b>launch</b> with change of the inclination. The other parameters of <b>the</b> <b>launch</b> orbit and <b>the</b> characteristic velocity can be evaluated by solving Lambert problem for determination of orbital parameters using two positions and two reference times. The position for the left end should be above <b>the</b> <b>launch</b> site. <b>The</b> time corresponding to the left end belongs to the interval, which is located to the right from the time of <b>the</b> <b>launch.</b> Then we perform the search on possible positions and the times at the left end. The parameters of <b>the</b> <b>launch</b> orbit are selected to satisfy the conditions for the minimum altitude of <b>the</b> <b>launch</b> orbit and minimum module of characteristic velocity. The paper presents the analysis for <b>the</b> <b>launches</b> from Canaveral, Vandenberg, Kuru and Sychuan launch sites. Note: Publication language:russia...|$|R

This conventional attack, backed by armor, heavy artillery, and anti-aircraft units (including SAMs) rolled over the two northernmost provinces of South Vietnam while two smaller offensives were launched in central and southern parts of the country. All U.S. and South Vietnamese air assets were diverted to first slowing, and then halting the onslaught. They were then utilized in the first sustained bombing of North Vietnam since late 1968 (see Operation Linebacker). Interdiction missions were then diverted to carry out an even heavier aerial offensive against the north (see Operation Linebacker II). The end was nigh for Commando Hunt. With the signing of the Paris Peace Accord in March 1973, the Vietnam War finally came to an end for the U.S.|$|E
