25|$|The {{internal}} energy representation and the enthalpy representation are partial Legendre transforms of one another. They contain the same physical information, written in different ways. Like the {{internal energy}}, the enthalpy stated {{as a function}} of its natural variables is a <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>potential</b> and contains all thermodynamic information about a body.|$|E
25|$|In {{this case}} a given set of {{chemicals}} at a given entropy and volume will have a single numerical value for this <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>potential.</b> A multi-state system may complicate or simplify the problem because the Gibbs phase rule predicts that intensive quantities {{will no longer be}} completely independent from each other.|$|E

25|$|The Gibbs energy (also {{referred}} to as G) is also the <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>potential</b> that is minimized when a system reaches chemical equilibrium at constant pressure and temperature. Its derivative {{with respect to the}} reaction coordinate of the system vanishes at the equilibrium point. As such, a reduction in G is a necessary condition for the spontaneity of processes at constant pressure and temperature.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} energy {{is a state}} function of a system, because its value depends only on {{the current state of}} the system and not on the path taken or processes undergone to prepare it. It is an extensive quantity. It is the one and only cardinal <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>potential.</b> Through it, by use of Legendre transforms, are mathematically constructed the other thermodynamic potentials. These are functions of variable lists in which some extensive variables are replaced by their conjugate intensive variables. Legendre transformation is necessary because mere substitutive replacement of extensive variables by intensive variables does not lead to thermodynamic potentials. Mere substitution leads to a less informative formula, an equation of state.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1870s, Josiah Willard Gibbs unified a large {{quantity}} of 19th century thermochemistry into one compact theory. [...] Gibbs's theory incorporated the new {{concept of a}} chemical potential to cause change when distant from a chemical equilibrium into the older work begun by Carnot in describing thermal and mechanical equilibrium and their potentials for change. [...] Gibbs's unifying theory resulted in the <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>potential</b> state functions describing differences from thermodynamic equilibrium.|$|E
2500|$|In thermodynamics, the Gibbs {{free energy}} (IUPAC {{recommended}} name: Gibbs energy or Gibbs function; {{also known as}} free enthalpy to distinguish it from Helmholtz free energy) is a <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>potential</b> {{that can be used}} to calculate the maximum of reversible work that may be performed by a thermodynamic system at a constant temperature and pressure (isothermal, isobaric). [...] The Gibbs free energy (J in SI units) is the maximum amount of non-expansion work that can be extracted from a thermodynamically closed system (one that can exchange heat and work with its surroundings, but not matter); this maximum can be attained only in a completely reversible process. When a system transforms reversibly from an initial state to a final state, the decrease in Gibbs free energy equals the work done by the system to its surroundings, minus the work of the pressure forces.|$|E
2500|$|Exergy is a {{combination}} property of a system and its environment because {{it depends on the}} state of both the system and environment. [...] The exergy of a system in equilibrium with the environment is zero. Exergy is neither a thermodynamic property of matter nor a <b>thermodynamic</b> <b>potential</b> of a system. [...] Exergy and energy both have units of joules. The internal energy of a system is always measured from a fixed reference state and is therefore always a [...] state function. [...] Some authors define the exergy of the system to be changed when the environment changes, in which case it is not a state function. [...] Other writers prefer a slightly alternate definition of the available energy or exergy of a system where the environment is firmly defined, [...] as an unchangeable absolute reference state, and in this alternate definition exergy becomes a property {{of the state of the}} system alone.|$|E
