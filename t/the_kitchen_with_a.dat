25|$|The palace {{was mainly}} {{designed}} for comfort. On {{the ground floor}} of the palace was <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> large fireplace and oven. The first floor has the banqueting hall, and above on the second hall had bedrooms for the family. The original staircase leading up to the first floor was a wooden one which ran up the outside of the building; however, due to the wet climate a stone staircase was later added inside the palace.|$|E
25|$|Bimbo's has {{a second}} bar near <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dance floor and {{performance}} space suitable for DJs or showcasing new acts. The room holds 150–200 people. In the main performance area, {{there are no}} balconies, and 125–475 people can be accommodated in booths and at tables on the terrace and dance floor for sit-down dinner served from the venue's full kitchen, available to outside caterers. If no dinner is planned, some 700 can watch the main stage, with theater-style seating {{on the dance floor}} and standing room at the bar.|$|E
500|$|Somerhill {{is built}} of sandstone. The stone also {{contains}} iron, which {{gives it a}} red colour. This stone is known as Calverley Stone. The house is {{in the shape of}} a letter [...] "H", with the main hall forming the bar of the [...] "H". The main elevation of the house faces west. The building is three storeys high, with a half-basement. It has five gables on the main elevation. The roof is of an A-frame construction, clad in Kentish peg tiles. The south wing houses the library, the second longest room in Kent at [...] long, exceeded only by the Gallery at Knole House, Sevenoaks. The main staircase is in the south wing. The north wing housed service rooms and <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> parlour at the rear.|$|E
60|$|Aunt Hitty soon {{appeared}} in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> armful of stockings, which, {{kneeling on the}} floor, she began counting and laying out.|$|R
60|$|On this mental {{reference}} to a First Secretary of a great Embassy, Mr Verloc stopped in the doorway, and looking down into <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> angry face and clenched fists, addressed his wife.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, and she's {{the kindest}} {{lady in the}} world! I'll {{tell you all about}} her some day, it's real interesting; now I must see to my pies, and get the {{vegetables}} on," [...] answered Becky, glancing at the gay clock in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> anxious look.|$|R
2500|$|In 2007, Burger King {{introduced}} a television advertising campaign {{in which a}} Burger King restaurant in Las Vegas, Nevada told customers {{that the company had}} stopped selling the Whopper sandwich. [...] The ads showed the startled reactions of customers that Burger King would discontinue selling its most popular sandwich. [...] A second round of related commercials showed actual customers who had ordered a Whopper instead being provided with a Big Mac from McDonald's or a hamburger from Wendy's. [...] After the customers complained to the Burger King restaurant manager, the King would emerge from <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> Whopper on a silver platter.|$|E
2500|$|Wolfe has {{an aversion}} to {{physical}} contact, even shaking hands. Early in the first novel Archie explains why there is a gong under his bed that will ring upon any intrusion into or near Wolfe's own bedroom: [...] "Wolfe told me once ... that he really had no cowardice in him, he only had an intense distaste for being touched by anyone …" [...] When Jerome Berin, creator of saucisse minuit, repeatedly taps Wolfe on the knee, Archie grins at [...] "Wolfe, who didn't like being touched, concealing his squirm {{for the sake of}} sausages." [...] In Prisoner's Base, Wolfe speaks coldly as he tells the DA and Inspector Cramer that the despised Lieutenant Rowcliff [...] "put a hand on me. ... I will not have a hand put on me, gentlemen. I like no man's hand on me, and one such as Mr. Rowcliff's, unmerited, I will not have." [...] Wolfe's prejudices make it all the more surprising when, in [...] "Cordially Invited to Meet Death", Archie finds Wolfe in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> woman who has solved the problem of preparing corned beef: [...] "Standing beside him, closer to him than I had ever seen any woman or girl of any age tolerated, with her hand slipped between his arm and his bulk, was Maryella." ...|$|E
6000|$|The old fellow {{received}} his dismissal {{with a low}} bow, and left <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> look at the Lodger which revealed (unless I was entirely mistaken) a sly sense of triumph. What did it mean? ...|$|E
5000|$|Udo [...] "King" [...] Cropa, {{the head}} chef played by Edoardo Ballerini. Udo is a {{brilliant}} chef, but disapproves of the traditional Italian dishes favored by his father. In the movie, the viewer sees him prepare a shelled and chopped-up lobster dish in a cream sauce flavored with vanilla, with fried spaghetti used as garnish. He commands <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> iron fist, and feels {{that he should be}} made partner in the restaurant, since much of the business's success is due to Udo's original recipes.|$|R
50|$|In the {{basement}} is <b>the</b> original <b>kitchen,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> large fireplace and bread ovens. Below it is <b>a</b> sub-basement <b>with</b> <b>a</b> datestone giving {{the names of}} the contractors and a built-in safe.|$|R
60|$|Rollo was {{beginning}} to get a little excited and vexed. People who boast of excellences which they do not possess, are very apt to be unreasonable and angry when any body seems to doubt whether their boastings are true. He was thus going on, insisting upon it that he should have acted as Maria had done, and was just saying that he should prefer another person's pleasure rather than his own, when Jonas came into the entry from <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> armful of wood, which he was carrying into the parlor.|$|R
60|$|And {{all laughed}} and drank; while Elsley's dark face looked {{in at the}} doorway, and half turned to escape. Handsome lady-like Mrs. Owen, bustling out of <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> supper-tray, ran full against him, and uttered a Welsh scream.|$|E
60|$|Presently, to Winnie's surprise, Moses {{was seen}} issuing from <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{petroleum}} lamp in one hand, the brilliant light of {{which not only}} glittered on his expressive black visage but sent a ruddy glare all over the cavern.|$|E
60|$|Jernyngham {{rose and}} moved away. Returning, he {{disappeared}} into <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dripping pail and Ellice's voice {{was raised in}} harsh upbraiding. Then the man came out, looking a trifle weary, though he sat down by Prescott with a smile.|$|E
50|$|Jenner's autobiography, Kris Jenner... and All Things Kardashian, was {{released}} in November 2011. She later wrote a cookbook entitled In <b>the</b> <b>Kitchen</b> <b>with</b> Kris: <b>A</b> Kollection of Kardashian-Jenner Family Favorites which {{was released}} in October 2014.|$|R
60|$|The {{softening}} of Miss Cynthia {{was a very}} gradual process, but {{it reached}} a climax one September morning, when Mrs. John Joe came into <b>the</b> former's <b>kitchen</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> important face. Miss Cynthia was preserving her plums.|$|R
5000|$|April 2:Ralph [...] "Bucky" [...] Phillips, who {{has spent}} 20 of the past 23 years in state prison, escapes from the Alden Correctional Facility in Erie County near Buffalo, cutting through <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> ceiling <b>with</b> <b>a</b> can opener.|$|R
6000|$|... "Is father {{coming home}} to dinner to-day?" [...] asked Richard, a little later on, as he entered <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> pail of water which Nancy, the oldest of his three sisters, {{had asked him to}} draw from the well.|$|E
60|$|But Ernest for {{the first}} time did not obey. He {{snatched}} his cap {{from the back of his}} chair, dashed it down over his eyes, and ran from <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sob choking his breath. Uncle Richard looked angry, but Aunt Kate hastened to soothe him.|$|E
60|$|It was vacation, {{and there}} was not much to do that day; we were soon free to seek the orchard. But the Story Girl would not come. She had seated herself in the darkest, hottest corner of <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> piece of old cotton in her hand.|$|E
6000|$|Biddy {{was waiting}} for me at <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> door, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> mug of new milk and a crust of bread. [...] "Biddy," [...] said I, when I gave her my hand at parting, [...] "I am not angry, but I am hurt." ...|$|R
5000|$|Riddings Comprehensive School, Enderby Road, Scunthorpe (1958 with {{extensions}} in 1965-70. Two storey blocks {{with the}} classroom block {{linked to the}} service block by a vestibule and <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> screened <b>with</b> <b>a</b> heavily rusticated or embossed wall. <b>A</b> tall waterpower <b>with</b> glazed provides vertical emphasis.|$|R
6000|$|... "This is {{a pretty}} thing, Belinda!" [...] said Mr. Pocket, {{returning}} <b>with</b> <b>a</b> countenance expressive of grief and despair. [...] "Here's the cook lying insensibly drunk on <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> floor, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> large bundle of fresh butter made up in the cupboard ready to sell for grease!" ...|$|R
60|$|Mary Ogilvie {{was in the}} {{meantime}} getting some of the powder back into the tin, and Janet running in from <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> maid, a soup tureen, and sundry spoons, everyone became busy in rescuing the remains-—in the midst of which there was a smash of glass.|$|E
60|$|It {{was this}} scene that broke upon Jimmy's view as {{he emerged from}} <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> laden tray. He saw Steve Murray seize the girl, and he saw her {{struggling}} to free herself, {{and then there was}} a mighty crash as Jimmy dropped the tray of steaming food upon the floor and ran quickly forward.|$|E
6000|$|... "In this {{difficulty}} I therefore resolved {{to take the}} subject of the horses to bed with me, and to say, 'Here I have you and you shall not escape from me.' But about supper-time Manuel came in to molest me, and sat in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> sad face, like a prisoner under sentence of death.|$|E
60|$|The holiday {{promised to}} be <b>a</b> nominal one <b>with</b> the Finks. Mrs. Fink had the {{stationary}} washtubs in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> filled <b>with</b> <b>a</b> two weeks' wash that had been soaking overnight. Mr. Fink sat in his stockinged feet reading a newspaper. Thus Labor Day presaged to speed.|$|R
50|$|The second museum {{building}} {{is called the}} Wickham House, {{in honor of the}} man who donated the 18th century log home to the museum. The logs were long ago covered by clapboards, although during renovation a porthole was left in the plaster of the interior wall of <b>the</b> original <b>kitchen</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> view of <b>the</b> logs and chinking.|$|R
6000|$|Frank {{approached}} the door cautiously and stopped {{when he reached}} it. The dog crouched {{near the center of}} <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> floor, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> woman's straw hat in front of him from which there trailed a couple of chewed-up feathers. He looked up at Frank <b>with</b> <b>a</b> low, warning growl which said very plainly, [...] "Come no farther!" ...|$|R
60|$|But Sara only walked {{fiercely}} out of <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{sound as}} if she were struggling for breath. In the hall she snatched a scarf from the wall, flung open the front door, and rushed down the lane in the chill, pure air of the autumn twilight. Her heart was throbbing with the pity she always felt for bruised and baited creatures.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{shall have}} my room, a little place over <b>the</b> <b>kitchen,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> ceiling {{that follows the}} slant of the roof down one side, against which you will bump your head times innumerable until you learn to {{remember}} that it is there, and a looking glass which will make one of your eyes {{as small as a}} pea and the other as big as an orange.|$|E
6000|$|... "Down rushed Debby {{to find me}} dancing about <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> great bump on my forehead, a big {{spoon in}} my hand, {{and a pair of}} bright purple feet. The plums were lying all over the hearth, the {{saucepan}} {{in the middle of the}} room, the basin was broken, and the sugar swimming about as if the bowl had turned itself over trying to sweeten our mess for us.|$|E
60|$|I {{thanked him}} and ran home again, and there I found that Joe had already locked {{the front door}} and vacated the state parlor, and was seated by <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> fire <b>with</b> <b>a</b> hand on each knee, gazing intently at the burning coals. I too sat down before the fire and gazed at the coals, and nothing was said for a long time.|$|R
6000|$|They had the Welsh rarebit, with beer, and Carl {{helped to}} make it. Gertie summoned him into <b>the</b> scoured <b>kitchen,</b> saying, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> {{beautiful}} casualness, as she tied an apron about him: ...|$|R
60|$|There {{were two}} or three October days when the sea was blue and silver, sharply and brightly {{outlined}} against the far skyline where the deep blue heavens modulated to a filmy turquoise. Gulls followed the furrows of the breakers. Father and Mother paced {{the edge of the}} cliff or sat sun-refreshed in the beloved arbor. Then a day of iron sea, cruelly steel-bright on one side and sullenly black on the other, with broken rolling clouds, and sand whisking along the dunes in shallow eddies; rain coming and the breakers pounding in <b>with</b> <b>a</b> terrifying roar and the menace of illimitable power. Father gathered piles of pine-knots for the fire, whistling as he hacked at them <b>with</b> <b>a</b> dull hatchet--trimming them, not because it was necessary, but because it gave him something energetic to do. Whenever he came into <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> armful of them he found Mother standing at the window, anxiously watching the flurries of sand and rain.|$|R
