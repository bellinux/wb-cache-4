That same month, Beatty filed a lawsuit in the Los Angeles, California Superior Court seeking $30 million in damages against the Tribune and a declaration over the rights. Bertram Fields, Beatty's lawyer, said the original 1985 agreement with the Tribune was negotiated specifically to allow Beatty a chance to make another Dick Tracy film. [...] "It was very carefully done and they just ignored it," [...] he stated. [...] "The Tribune is a big, powerful company and they think <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>just</b> run roughshod over people. They picked the wrong guy." ...|$|E

[...] Music journalists made other comparisons of the music in context of both electronic and hip hop, with Exclaim! describing this sound as [...] "not exactly what the hip hop world is used to hearing." [...] Fact expanded on the description of the two genres, stating that [...] "the sonic cut-ups that characterize Vocal Studies have often been linked to the IDM scene, but <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>just</b> as well be understood within the context of scratching and turntablism, where snatching small elements of records and re-contextualizing them was key."

On July 13, 1985, he {{appeared at the}} climax at the Live Aid concert at JFK Stadium, Philadelphia. Backed by Keith Richards and Ronnie Wood, he performed a ragged version of [...] "Hollis Brown", his ballad of rural poverty, and then said to the worldwide audience exceeding one billion people: [...] "I hope {{that some of the}} money... maybe <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>just</b> {{take a little bit of}} it, maybe... one or two million, maybe... and use it to pay the mortgages on some of the farms and, the farmers here, owe to the banks."

2500|$|The second segment {{that was}} cut from the film follows Wayne (Anton Yelchin), a shy {{apprentice}} mortician who is secretly a necrophiliac at the hospital he works at. One night, a body he's having sex with is brought back to life from the pressure of his thrusts. His supervisor Bob (Shane Jacobson) suddenly walks in and mistakenly believes that Wayne has performed a life-saving operation of some kind. The staff {{at the hospital and}} the media congratulate him while a news reporter asks what he did to save her. Unable to conjure an answer, one of the cops on scene tells everyone else <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>just</b> watch the security tapes to find out. As they rush to the security room, Wayne is given a personal thanks by the girl (Maria Volk) he revived, upon which he responds with an awkward [...] "Your Welcome".

2500|$|The rise of Netflix has {{affected}} the way audiences watch televised content. Netflix's CPO Neil Hunt believes that Netflix is a model for what television will look like in 2025. He points out that because the Internet allows users the freedom to watch shows at their own pace, an episode does not need cliffhangers to tease the audience to keep tuning in week after week, because <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>just</b> binge straight into the next episode. Netflix has allowed content creators to deviate from traditional formats that force 30 minute or 60 minute timeslots once a week, which it claims gives them an advantage over networks. Their model provides a platform that allows varying run times per episode based on a storyline, {{eliminates the need for}} a week to week recap, and does not have a fixed notion of what constitutes a [...] "season". This flexibility also allows Netflix to nurture a show until it finds its audience, unlike traditional networks which will quickly cancel a show if it is unable to maintain steady ratings.|$|E

But I've been enough at sea in my time to know this much at least--that no coast {{in the world is}} dangerous except by dint of reckless corner-cutting. Captains of great ships behave exactly like two hansom-drivers in the streets of London; they think <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>just</b> shave past without grazing; and they DO shave past nine times out of ten. The tenth time they run on the rocks through sheer recklessness, and lose their vessel; and then, the newspapers always ask the same solemn question--in childish good faith--how did so experienced and able a navigator come to make such a mistake in his reckoning? He made NO mistake; he simply tried to cut it fine, and cut it too fine for once, with the result that he usually loses his own life and his passengers. That's all. We who have been at sea understand that perfectly." ...|$|E

60|$|Worms {{are poorly}} {{provided}} with sense-organs, for they cannot {{be said to}} see, although <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>just</b> distinguish between light and darkness; they are completely deaf, and have only a feeble power of smell; the sense of touch alone is well developed. They can therefore learn but little about the outside world, and {{it is surprising that}} they should exhibit some skill in lining their burrows with their castings and with leaves, {{and in the case of}} some species in piling up their castings into tower-like constructions. But it is far more surprising that they should apparently exhibit some degrees of intelligence instead of a mere blind instinctive impulse, in their manner of plugging up the mouths of their burrows. They act in nearly the same manner as would a man, who had to close a cylindrical tube with different kinds of leaves, petioles, triangles of paper, &c., for they commonly seize such objects by their pointed ends. But with thin objects a certain number are drawn in by their broader ends. They do not act in the same unvarying manner in all cases, as do most of the lower animals; for instance, they do not drag in leaves by their foot-stalks, unless the basal part of the blade is as narrow as the apex, or narrower than it.|$|E

Why, if you consider the legislation of the last seven or eight years, you will see how they have been driven to embrace some sort of socialism. Nothing so detestable and short-sighted as our financial policy has ever been known {{in the history of the}} world. The middle classes, meaning by the middle classes professional men and men of moderate means, bore the chief burden of the war. They submitted to terrible taxation, to many privations, besides the universal gift of their young blood. We won the war and what was the result? The wealth of the country, through ghastly legislation, drifted into the hands of the profiteering classes, the wholesale shopkeepers, the ship owners, the factory owners, the mine owners. The professional man with two thousand a year was able to save a quarter of that before the war. After the war, taxation demanded that quarter and more for income tax, thrust upon him an increased cost of living, cut the ground from beneath his feet. It isn't either of the two extremes--the aristocrat or the labouring man--where you must look for the pulse of a country's prosperity.
