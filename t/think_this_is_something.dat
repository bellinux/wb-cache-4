Cao Pi was so furious that he drew his sword and wanted to execute his servants. Su Ze knelt down and pleaded with him to spare the servants, saying, [...] "Your Majesty, I heard that the sage-rulers of ancient times would not harm people {{for the sake of}} animals. Now, Your Majesty wishes to promote the culture of Yao's time, yet Your Majesty wants to execute so many people just because a hunting excursion went wrong. I don't <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> Your Majesty should do. With my life, I beg Your Majesty to spare these people." [...] Cao Pi replied, [...] "You're a subject who speaks his mind." [...] He then spared all his servants. Since then, Cao Pi became more wary of Su Ze because he knew that Su Ze would not hesitate to speak up and criticise him if he did something wrong.|$|E

[...] Summer becomes suspicious about Natasha's pregnancy as she knows that Natasha likes to play games. Though she knows she does not want to come across as a jealous ex-girlfriend. Summer discovers that Natasha's ultrasound scan photos are fake and she realises Natasha has been lying about being pregnant. Summer then reveals the truth to Andrew. Summer later tells Andrew that they cannot be together and Lucas explained that Summer feels that the situation with Natasha never would have happened if they had not cheated on her. She added [...] "And I guess she feels that the whole situation is way too messy and that Andrew has a whole lot of baggage to sort out, and this is not the right time to start a relationship." [...] Lucas admitted that Summer and Andrew deserve to be together as they have been through a lot and they have a good chemistry. When asked if Summer and Natasha would be friends again, Lucas said [...] "They have both done the wrong thing. Summer cheated with her boyfriend, Tash with the fake pregnancy; they have both been guilty of doing the wrong thing." ...|$|E

5000|$|Beginning in 1984, Huffman and {{his team}} of {{researchers}} began developing cannabinoid compounds to aid in research of multiple sclerosis, HIV/AIDS, and chemotherapy. Over the course of twenty years, Huffman {{and his team}} developed 450 synthetic cannabinoid compounds which were used to test the effect of cannabinoid receptors in the brain and other organs. Ultimately, the cannabinoid research provided understanding of diseases and information for medication development.In the late 2000s, two of Huffman's cannabinoid compounds began being sold in Germany as marijuana alternatives known as K2 and Spice. [...] "I figured once it got started in Germany it was going to spread. I'm concerned that it could hurt people," [...] Huffman said. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>something</b> that <b>was</b> more or less inevitable. It bothers me that people are so stupid as to use this stuff". Huffman may have developed these compounds for scientific research, but now he gets blamed for its abuse. As JWH-018 is more potent and easy to make, Huffman believes it is a more widely used synthetic cannabinoid of the JWH series.|$|R

5000|$|Vlisco fabrics {{are given}} an {{interesting}} form of symbolism, which allows African women to speak out, yet stay silent. Once a fabric {{has been designed}} and shipped, it is given a name which often ties into local sayings by the saleswomen. An example of <b>this</b> <b>is</b> a fabric with a print of open bird-cages and two birds flying out, that goes by the title [...] "Si tu sors, je sors" [...] (You leave, I leave), which means to say [...] "If you <b>think</b> <b>this</b> marriage <b>is</b> <b>something</b> you can take and leave as you please, I will do the same." [...] Other fabrics are known as 'Come to my bedroom wearing your slippers', 'Michelle Obama's handbag', or 'Kofi Annan's brain". What {{is important to consider}} in all <b>this</b> <b>is</b> that <b>this</b> kind of symbolism is only possible both because the messages are open to multiple interpretations and the fabrics are worn as dresses, and no one can divorce or attack a woman for wearing a pretty dress.|$|R

Stress can cause depression and frustration, and it does not help in achieving goals and being successful. Ordinary people have a negative concept of stress, but stress response also helps one to rise to meet challenges. Some level of stress is recommended because it helps people to solve problems. While under stress one can function better and work faster, it sharpens concentration and increases brain efficiency. At the beginning of the third millennium, stress has become the people’s enemy, so they should learn how to cope with it. It is common knowledge that one cannot avoid stress, so it is important to learn how to control and deal with it...|$|R

They listed the [...] "damsel in distress" [...] {{as one of their}} top 25 video game archetypes, using Princess Peach as an example of this due to her frequent kidnappings.

I mean, it's something that I've always been interested in. I think people are born bisexual, and it's just that our parents and society kind of veer us off into this feeling of 'Oh, I can't.' They say it's taboo. It's ingrained in our heads that it's bad, when it's not bad at all. It's a very beautiful thing." [...] In a later interview for Out magazine's April 2010 issue, Armstrong stated: [...] "There {{were a lot of}} people who didn't accept it, who were homophobic." [...] Armstrong continued, saying, [...] "The fact that it's an issue is kind of phobic within itself. At some point, you gotta <b>think,</b> <b>this</b> should <b>be</b> <b>something</b> that's just accepted." [...] Armstrong added: [...] "I don't really classify myself as anything. And when it comes to sex, there are parts of me that are very shy and conservative." [...] In February 2014, Armstrong again discussed his bisexuality in a Rolling Stone article about Dookie, a record which Armstrong described as [...] "touch on bisexuality a lot." [...] Armstrong discussed the song [...] "Coming Clean" [...] stating, [...] "It was a song about questioning myself. There are these other feelings you may have about the same sex, the opposite sex, especially being in Berkeley and San Francisco then. People are acting out what they're feeling: gay, bisexual, transgender, whatever. And that opens up something in society that becomes more acceptable. Now we have gay marriage becoming recognized...

40|$|Several of Edgar Allen Poe 2 ̆ 7 s short tales mislead {{the reader}} into believing perversity to be {{a sort of}} horrifying {{primordial}} impulse, or the self-justification of insane men who have committed atrocities. In The Black Cat and The Tell-Tale Heart, the narrators attempt to vindicate themselves from guilt by invoking the force of an elemental thought and its determinative compulsion to evil. They rationalize their behavior to evade the charge of madness. This philosophical presentation focuses on The Imp of the Perverse, Poe 2 ̆ 7 s boldest drama of a murderer 2 ̆ 7 s rationalization. The narrator directly defends himself, not necessarily from the crime but from the charge of mental illness, and he appeals to phrenology and Enlightenment science to make his case. Poe 2 ̆ 7 s readers, ourselves members of the 2 ̆ 2 you 2 ̆ 2 or the jury, are led on startled and disgusted by a mysterious and dangerously evil force to view perversity as an anomaly in an otherwise judicious moral system. I <b>think,</b> however, that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>something</b> of a trick. I argue that Poe renders the judgment of Enlightenment law - and so the judgment of the reader himself - truly perverse.

40|$|<b>This</b> essay <b>is</b> {{about what}} {{things we can}} count, and what we can’t. Practicalities won’t concern us. It may be very difficult, for example, to {{count the number of}} grains of sand on a beach, or the number of {{molecules}} in our body, or even the number of quantum states of our brain; but, in principle, these things can be done. We’re also not even concern with whether the number of things to be counted is finite or not. Even if we have to go on counting forever, if each element of a set can be given a number, then we are happy to call that set countable. You would think that most everything would be countable; but unexpected things are provably not. For example, it’s impossible to count the number of provable theorems in a mathematical theory. That’s a theorem. Another thing that can’t be counted is the number of degrees of freedom in a field — like the fields that constitute all our most basic theories of physics. This fact causes headaches (which we will discuss soon) but, surprisingly, it doesn’t prevent us from very accurately describing Nature. Indeed, it would appear that our basic understanding of physics and mathematics relies exclusively on things that cannot be counted. But are we right to <b>think</b> <b>this,</b> or <b>is</b> there <b>something</b> incomplete about our current understanding of physics? Are field theories really fundamental or do we need a new framework for making sense of our world? Another way to phrase <b>this</b> <b>is</b> ask whether the degrees of freedom that mak...|$|R
