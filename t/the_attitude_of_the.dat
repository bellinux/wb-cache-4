His main supporters were Abbot Bernard of Clairvaux, Archbishop of Magdeburg Norbert of Xanten and King Lothair III of Germany. The few secular lords who had initially supported Anacletus gradually abandoned his cause as lost; only King Roger II of Sicily, who had received the crown from Anacletus in exchange for support, stood at his side to the very end. Although Anacletus II was able to retain {{the control of the}} city of Rome and the Patrimony of St. Peter until his death in January 1138, his successor quickly made his submission to Innocent II, who is now regarded as true Pope.|$|E
5|$|The Allied powers {{referred}} {{the problem}} of Upper Silesia to the League after they {{had been unable to}} resolve the territorial dispute. After the First World War, Poland laid claim to Upper Silesia, which had been part of Prussia. The Treaty of Versailles had recommended a plebiscite in Upper Silesia to determine whether the territory should become part of Germany or Poland. Complaints about <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> German authorities led to rioting and eventually to the first two Silesian Uprisings (1919 and 1920). A plebiscite took place on 20 March 1921, with 59.6 percent (around 500,000) of the votes cast in favour of joining Germany, but Poland claimed the conditions surrounding it had been unfair. This result led to the Third Silesian Uprising in 1921.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> United States {{was also}} {{influenced}} by the Monroe Doctrine, a philosophy of foreign policy articulated by James Monroe in 1823, and which justified the maintenance of US hegemony in the region. The stated aim of the doctrine was to maintain order and stability and {{to make certain that}} access to resources and markets was not limited. The historian Mark Gilderhus states that the doctrine also contained racially condescending language, which likened Latin American countries to fighting children. The US government did not need to engage in military interventions in Guatemala to enforce this hegemony, given the presence of military rulers friendly to the US; nevertheless, the doctrine was used to justify the coup in 1954.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This study {{explores the}} link between {{employer}} attitudes toward ethnic minorities and the ethnic wage gap in the Swedish labor market. The analysis proceeds in two steps. First we conduct a field experiment on hiring {{in order to establish}} that a randomly selected employer is more likely to discriminate a minority job applicant in regions where the average employer has more negative attitudes. This analysis concludes that ethnic minority workers have an incentive to sort away from the most prejudiced employers in the labor market. If such sorting occurs the relative wage for minority workers will, according to Becker‟s theory of discrimination, be determined by <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marginal employer. Hence, in the second step we contrast <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marginal employer with <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> average employer on the ethnic wage gap. We find evidence for Becker‟s argument in that the regional ethnic wage gap is only affected by <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> marginal employer, but not by <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> average employer in the region. This holds especially for low skilled occupations. JEL classification: J 64, J 71 Key words: field experiments on hiring, employer discrimination, negative attitudes, ethnic wage gaps, regional variation We would like to thank Olof Åslund, Oddbjörn Raaum and Matti Sarvimäki and participants at the 2010 conference on immigration and labor market integration in Uppsala as well as participants at the seminar at School of Business and Economics at Linnaeus University for helpful comments to this first draft. ...|$|R

The students on Facebook platform were examined for about three months and they continued their education interactively in that virtual environment. After the-three-month-education period, observations for the students were reported and <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students towards Facebook were measured by three different measurement tools. As a result, <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students towards educational use of Facebook and their views were heterogeneous. When <b>the</b> average values <b>of</b> <b>the</b> group were examined, it was reported that <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards educational use <b>of</b> Facebook was above a moderate level.

5|$|In September {{questions}} were asked in the House of Commons about the incident, by which time Constantine had decided to take legal action. In June 1944 Constantine v Imperial London Hotels was heard in the High Court. Although there was no law against racial discrimination in Britain at the time, Constantine argued that the hotel had breached its contract with him. Constantine informed the court that <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hotel changed between his booking and arrival, owing {{to the presence of}} white American servicemen. The defence argued that they had met their contract by accommodating Constantine in another hotel and that he had left the Imperial voluntarily. The managing director of the hotel denied that racist language had been used. After two days of evidence, the judge found in Constantine's favour, rejecting the defence's arguments and praising the way Constantine had handled the situation. Although the law limited the award of damages against the hotel to five guineas, Constantine was vindicated. He did not pursue the case any further as he believed he had sufficiently raised the issue of racism in the public eye; the case was widely reported in the press, and Constantine received great support from both the public and the government.|$|E
5|$|Æthelwulf {{was first}} {{recorded}} in 825, when Egbert won the crucial Battle of Ellandun against King Beornwulf of Mercia, ending the long Mercian ascendancy over southern England. Egbert followed {{it up by}} sending Æthelwulf with Eahlstan, Bishop of Sherborne, and Wulfheard, Ealdorman of Hampshire, with a large army into Kent to expel sub-king Baldred. Æthelwulf was descended from kings of Kent, and he was sub-king of Kent, and of Surrey, Sussex and Essex, which were then included in the sub-kingdom, until he inherited the throne of Wessex in 839. His sub-kingship is recorded in charters, in some of which King Egbert acted with his son's permission, such as a grant in 838 to Bishop Beornmod of Rochester, and Æthelwulf himself issued a charter as King of Kent in the same year. Unlike their Mercian predecessors, who alienated the Kentish people by ruling from a distance, Æthelwulf and his father successfully cultivated local support by governing through Kentish ealdormen and promoting their interests. In Abels' view, Egbert and Æthelwulf rewarded their friends and purged Mercian supporters. Historians take differing views on <b>the</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new regime to the Kentish church. At Canterbury in 828 Egbert granted privileges to the bishopric of Rochester, {{and according to the}} historian of Anglo-Saxon England Simon Keynes, Egbert and Æthelwulf took steps to secure the support of Archbishop Wulfred. However, the medievalist Nicholas Brooks argues that Wulfred's Mercian origin and connections proved a liability. Æthelwulf seized an estate in East Malling from the Canterbury church on the ground that it had only been granted by Baldred when he was in flight from the West Saxon forces; the issue of archiepiscopal coinage was suspended for several years; and the only estate Wulfred was granted after 825 he received from King Wiglaf of Mercia.|$|E

Analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> nursing students toward <b>the</b> elderly and the demographic characteristics was made. The demographic characteristics examined were age, level of education, previous social contact with the elderly, previous work or volunteer experience with the elderly, religiosity and location <b>of</b> residence. <b>The</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nursing students upon entry to the nursing program were found to be positive. <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> 181 respondents to the pretest, 98. 3 % had positive <b>attitudes</b> toward <b>the</b> elderly according to the Kogan's Old People Scale. No significant change in <b>the</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nursing students toward the elderly was found following the clinical practice.
