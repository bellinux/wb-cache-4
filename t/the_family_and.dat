5|$|Although ferries (and later bridges) {{had crossed}} the river to the east at Richmond since 1459 and to the west at Eel Pie Island since at least 1652 the lands {{to the south of}} the river at this point had {{historically}} been privately held by the Tollemache family (owners of Ham House) and off limits to the public. Consequently, despite the distance from the nearest crossings there was little demand for cross-river services at this location. Additionally, the Tollemache family had licensing rights for the Twickenham Ferry at Eel Pie Island (sometimes known as Dysart's ferry after <b>the</b> <b>family),</b> <b>and</b> consequently had little interest in promoting a competing service. The Twickenham Ferry is a setting for some action in Little Dorritt by Charles Dickens.|$|E
5|$|Before Stanton {{narrowed her}} {{political}} focus {{almost exclusively to}} women's rights, she was an active abolitionist with her husband Henry Brewster Stanton (co-founder of the Republican Party) and cousin Gerrit Smith.

Her concerns included women's parental and custody rights, property rights, employment and income rights, divorce, the economic health of <b>the</b> <b>family,</b> <b>and</b> birth control. She was also an outspoken supporter of the 19th-century temperance movement.|$|E

5|$|Before her marriage, Louise {{served as}} an {{unofficial}} secretary to her mother, the Queen (1866–1871). The question of Louise's marriage was discussed in the late 1860s. Suitors from the royal houses of Prussia and Denmark were suggested, but Victoria wanted new blood in <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> therefore suggested a high-ranking member of the aristocracy. Despite opposition {{from members of the}} royal family, Louise fell in love with John, Marquess of Lorne, the heir to the Duke of Argyll. Victoria consented to the marriage, which took place on 21 March 1871. Despite a happy beginning, the two drifted apart, possibly because of their childlessness and the Queen's constraints on their activities.|$|E

During a family gathering, Chris meets Tom's American fiancée, Nola Rice, and they are instantly attracted to each other. Tom's mother, Eleanor, does not approve of her son's relationship with Nola, a struggling actress, which {{is a source of}} tension in the family.

5|$|Cox {{has also}} said {{that there is a}} massive irony, both in the film and in real life, that a {{religion}} so focused on <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> its importance is ripping families apart through its teaching on homosexuality.

Nevertheless, a major theme of Latter Days is that there is an underlying spirituality in the world that goes beyond the rituals and dogmas of religion.|$|E
5|$|David Lindsay, the 9th Earl's son, {{was educated}} in Paris and Cambridge, and {{travelled}} in continental Europe. His father had nominated {{the son of}} Alexander, the Wicked Master, as heir to the earldom, returning the title to the senior line of <b>the</b> <b>family,</b> <b>and</b> thus Lindsay did not succeed to the earldom on his father's death. However, he was knighted in 1581, became a Lord of Session (a senior judge), taking the title Lord Edzell, in 1593, and in 1598 {{was appointed to the}} Privy Council. A Renaissance Man, he undertook improvements to his estates, including mining and woodland planting. Two German prospectors from Nuremberg, Bernard Fechtenburg and Hans Ziegler, were invited to search for precious metals around Edzell.|$|E

Shortly before his eleventh birthday, a series of letters addressed to Harry arrive, but Uncle Vernon destroys them before Harry can read them, leading to an influx of more and more letters. To evade the pursuit of these letters, Vernon first takes the family to a hotel, but when the letters arrive there too, he hires a boat out to a hut on a small island.|$|E
5|$|Haynes married Bertha Lanterman in October 1887 after {{a ten-year}} relationship. The {{ceremony}} {{was held at}} her parents' Portland home and the couple honeymooned in Cincinnati. Their first child, Marie, was born on January 28, 1889, but she soon succumbed to illness and died when six months old. Their second child, a son born in 1890, also died in infancy. The deaths saddened <b>the</b> <b>family</b> <b>and</b> caused them to turn more to their religion. Haynes became increasingly active in the Presbyterian church and became an elder. In December 1892, the Haynes' third child, Bernice, was born. A second son, March, was born 1896. The two children were well educated and grew up to assist their father in his enterprises.|$|E
