40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{presents}} a design method of robust PID controller with two {{degrees of freedom}} (2 DOF PID controller) for SISO plants with a time-delay and parametric uncertainty based on the partial knowledge about <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>models.</b> It is assumed that the adjustable parameters of the 2 DOF PID controller are chosen so as to minimize the two performance indices for step reference and disturbance responses which maximized by <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> parameters belonging to a given bounded set.

It is an obligate {{parasite}} and the causal agent of the downy mildew of <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> <b>model</b> organism Arabidopsis thaliana. While H. arabidopsidis has {{for a long time}} been subsumed under Peronospora parasitica (now Hyaloperonospora parasitica), recent studies have shown that H. parasitica is restricted to Capsella bursa-pastoris as a host plant. Like the other Hyaloperonospora species, H. arabidopsidis is highly specialized, and it is so far known with certainty only from Arabidopsis thaliana as a host plant. Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis encodes 10 different noncytotoxic NLPs (HaNLPs) that do not cause necrosis. We discovered that these noncytotoxic NLPs, however, act as potent activators of the plant immune system in Arabidopsis thaliana. Ectopic expression of HaNLP3 in Arabidopsis triggered resistance to H. arabidopsidis, activated the expression of a large set of defense-related genes, and caused a reduction of plant growth that is typically associated with strongly enhanced immunity. N- and C-terminal deletions of HaNLP3, as well as amino acid substitutions, pinpointed to a small central region of the protein that is required to trigger immunity, indicating the protein acts as a microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP).|$|E
