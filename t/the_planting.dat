50|$|Often, {{the ants}} {{will not only}} receive housing from the plant; they will eat extrafloral nectar and food bodies that <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> provides. In return, <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> {{receives}} security from herbivores that may eat <b>the</b> <b>plant,</b> because <b>the</b> ants hunt on <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> and eat many of <b>the</b> <b>plant’s</b> predators. This symbiosis benefits both <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> and ants.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> packing <b>plant</b> in Dubuque {{operated}} under the FDL Foods Inc. name until September 1995 when <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> again closed, this time {{due to the}} loss of the sole contract with Hormel (as reported to workers by management in July 1995). <b>The</b> <b>plant</b> was eventually sold to Farmland Foods, who continued to operate <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> until 2001. Smithfield Foods purchased <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> with <b>the</b> stated intention of refurbishing and reopening <b>the</b> <b>plant.</b> However once Smithfield purchased <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> they decided not to proceed with either remodeling or reopening <b>the</b> <b>plant.</b> This led to the belief that Smithfield only purchased <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> to remove competition from the market.|$|R
50|$|The {{symptoms}} are categorized as systemic, {{due to the}} spread of the disease throughout <b>the</b> <b>plant.</b> Once <b>the</b> virus enters <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> through <b>the</b> root cells via Polymyxa graminis it is able to multiply and spread throughout <b>the</b> <b>plant.</b> <b>The</b> symptoms arise due to the virus's ability to hack into <b>the</b> <b>plant</b> cells' machinery, which disrupts the normal cycle of <b>the</b> <b>plant.</b>|$|R

5|$|Bumblebee {{conservation}} {{is in its}} infancy {{in many parts of}} the world, but with the realization of the important part they play in pollination of crops, efforts are being made to manage farmland better. Enhancing the wild bee population can be done by <b>the</b> <b>planting</b> of wildflower strips, and in New Zealand, bee nesting boxes have achieved some success, perhaps because there are few burrowing mammals to provide potential nesting sites in that country.|$|E
5|$|In May 2000, twenty {{trees were}} planted, {{one for each}} boys who attended. During <b>the</b> <b>planting</b> ceremony, the Scout Chief Commissioner for England, along {{with representatives of the}} Scouts and the Guides, planted the trees on the seaward side of the {{original}} site. The trees were designed to act as a permanent memorial to the camp, as well as providing a series of future windbreaks against coastal winds.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>planting</b> was recreated in the 1930s. No {{original}} {{plan of the}} renaissance garden survives, although records show fruit was grown in the 17th century. The garden has decorative hedges, trimmed into {{the shapes of the}} Scottish thistle, English rose, and French fleur-de-lis. Further planting is clipped into letters, spelling out the two Lindsay family mottoes, Dum Spiro Spero (while I breathe I hope), and Endure Forte (endure firmly).|$|E
5|$|Breeding densities {{have been}} {{recorded}} as between 0.1–6.6pairs/10ha (0.04–2.7pairs/10acres), with the greatest densities in mature forest growing on alluvium. Numbers have increased in Europe due to <b>the</b> <b>planting</b> of forests, which provides breeding habitat, and more available dead wood, and this species has profited from its flexibility with regard to types of woodland {{and its ability to}} thrive in proximity to humans. Harsh winters are a problem, and fragmentation of woodland can cause local difficulties. The Canary Islands populations of D. m. canariensis on Tenerife and D. m. thanneri on Gran Canaria face a potential threat from exploitation of the local pine forests.|$|E

5|$|Flood {{waters in}} Miami-Dade County covered about 40,000acres (160km²) of farmland. The damage was worsened since the {{flooding}} {{occurred at the}} beginning of <b>the</b> <b>planting</b> period for the winter season. Flooded nurseries and fields resulted in about $500million in agricultural damage, including $60million in tropical fruit and $397million in ornamental crops. The U.S. Department of Agriculture declared 16Florida counties, including Miami-Dade, Collier, and Palm Beach, as primary disaster areas due to flooding, making farmers and their families there eligible for USDA emergency farm loans. The same agency made 22 other counties, including Broward, eligible for loans due to their proximity to the disaster areas.|$|E
5|$|However, his {{attitude}} {{could not be}} maintained. Landowners were infuriated by the unwillingness {{of the government to}} use force, while the peasants were annoyed by the unwillingness to redistribute land from the latifundia. Landowners matched the strike with a lockout, and many peasants, probably a majority in the strike centres, were left without tenancies when <b>the</b> <b>planting</b> season ended in mid-December. In December 1893 the failure of the Giolitti government to restore public order gave rise to a general demand that Crispi should return to power. Giolitti had to resign on November 24, 1893, {{as a result of the}} Banca Romana scandal.|$|E
5|$|In a {{case study}} of the Los Angeles Basin, {{simulations}} showed that even when trees are not strategically placed in these urban heat islands, they can still aid in minimization of pollutants and energy reduction. It is estimated that with this wide-scale implementation, the city of Los Angeles can annually save $100M with most of the savings coming from cool roofs, lighter colored pavement, and <b>the</b> <b>planting</b> of trees. With a citywide implementation, added benefits from the lowering smog-level would result in at least one billion dollars of saving per year.|$|E

5|$|Sir Thomas Modyford {{had been}} {{appointed}} the Governor of Jamaica in February 1664 with instructions to limit {{the activities of the}} privateers; he made a proclamation against their activities on 11 June 1664, but economic practicalities led to him reversing the policy {{by the end of the}} month. About 1,500 privateers used Jamaica as a base for their activity and brought significant revenue to the island. As <b>the</b> <b>planting</b> community of 5,000 was still new and developing, the revenue from the privateers was needed to avoid economic collapse. A privateer was granted a letter of marque which gave him a licence to attack and seize vessels, normally of a specific country, or with conditions attached. A portion of all spoils obtained by the privateers was given to the sovereign or the issuing ambassador.|$|E
5|$|The Igu Aro festival (counting of the year) was a royal festival the eze Nri used to {{maintain}} his influence over the communities under his authority.

At the end the Eze Nri would give the representatives a yam medicine and a blessing of fertility for their communities. The festival {{was seen as a}} day of peace and certain activities were prohibited such as <b>the</b> <b>planting</b> of crops before the day of the ceremony, the splitting of wood and unnecessary noise. Igu Aro was a regular event that gave an opportunity for the eze to speak directly to all the communities under him.|$|E
5|$|This {{included}} <b>the</b> <b>planting</b> of Pinot noir grapes in the Willamette Valley, {{a region}} long thought {{too cold to}} be suitable for viticulture.
