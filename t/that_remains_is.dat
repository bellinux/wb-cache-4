5|$|In 1800, Hansen {{was also}} charged with {{rebuilding}} Christiansborg Palace which had burnt down in 1794. Unfortunately, it burnt down {{once again in}} 1884. All <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>is</b> the magnificent chapel which, with its Ionic columns, conveys a sense of antiquity.|$|E
5|$|By the 1920s, {{the number}} of {{municipalities}} in Bergen County had reached 70, where it still stands. After the 1920s, the legislature did not create many new municipalities, but local officials used zoning to affect land use, making annexation less attractive. Because of boroughitis, the township {{as a form of}} government all but disappeared from Bergen County. One <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>is</b> South Hackensack, the remnants of Lodi Township that no seceding borough wanted. Its three pieces are separated from each other by several miles.|$|E
5|$|Dutch {{bricks and}} {{brickwork}} were also imported and utilized in other colonies throughout the Dutch Empire in Asia, Africa, and the Caribbean. Fort Zeelandia {{was built on}} a small island off Tainan in Formosa (Taiwan) between 1624 and 1634 after the Dutch acquired Formosa from China as a trading colony. It was built using bricks from Batavia (Jakarta), where the Dutch East India Company had its headquarters. After a siege in 1662, the Dutch surrendered the fort to Koxinga, a Ming dynasty general. The fort was destroyed by an explosion in 1873 when a shell from a British warship blew up the ammunition storehouse. The masonry was later used for other purposes. All <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>is</b> part of the southern wall.|$|E

5|$|Following the eviction, Killakee House {{was briefly}} {{used as an}} {{operations}} base by the Detective Unit of the Garda Síochána in 1931 while they hunted IRA subversives who were hiding explosives at Killakee. When the bank {{was unable to find}} a buyer for the estate, it was acquired by a builder who stripped the house and then demolished it in 1941. The lands were eventually acquired by the State and opened to the public. In the late 1930s, the Director of Forestry, a German called Otto Reinhard, laid out the area as an urban forest. The trees have reclaimed most of the land once occupied by the formal gardens: all <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>is</b> the brickwork {{at the rear of the}} Turner glasshouses and the system of irrigation canals and ponds for the exotic plants contained within.|$|E
5|$|Diarist John Evelyn {{lived in}} Deptford at Sayes Court from 1652. Evelyn {{inherited}} {{the house when}} he married the daughter of Sir Richard Browne in 1652. On his return to England at the Restoration, Evelyn laid out meticulously planned gardens in the French style, of hedges and parterres. In its grounds was a cottage at one time rented by master woodcarver Grinling Gibbons. After Evelyn had moved to Surrey in 1694, Russian Tsar Peter the Great studied shipbuilding for three months in 1698. He {{and some of his}} fellow Russians stayed at Sayes Court, the manor house of Deptford. Evelyn was angered at the antics of the Tsar, who got drunk with his friends and, using a wheelbarrow with Peter in it, rammed their way through a fine holly hedge. Sayes Court was demolished in 1728-9 and a workhouse built on its site. Part of the estates around Sayes Court were purchased in 1742 for the building of the Navy Victualling Yard, which was renamed the Royal Victoria Victualing Yard in 1858 after a visit by Queen Victoria. This massive facility included warehouses, a bakery, a cattleyard/abattoir and sugar stores, and closed in 1961. All <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>is</b> the name of Sayes Court Park, accessed from Sayes Court Street off Evelyn Street, not far from Deptford High Street. The Pepys Estate, opened on 13 July 1966, is on the former grounds of the Victualing Yard.|$|E
5|$|Situated on {{the border}} with Manchester, Stretford became a fashionable place to live in the mid-19th century. Large {{recreation}} areas were established, such as the Royal Botanical Gardens, opened in 1831. The gardens were sited in Old Trafford on the advice of scientist John Dalton, because the prevailing southwesterly wind kept the area clear of the city's airborne pollution. In 1857, the gardens hosted the Art Treasures Exhibition, the largest art exhibition ever held in the United Kingdom. A purpose-built iron and glass building was constructed at a cost of £38,000 to house the 16,000exhibits. The gardens were also chosen as a site for the Royal Jubilee Exhibition of 1887, celebrating Queen Victoria's 50-year reign. The exhibition ran for more than sixmonths and was attended by more than 4.75million visitors. The gardens were converted into an entertainment resort in 1907, and hosted the first speedway meeting in Greater Manchester on 16 June 1928. There was also greyhound racing from 1930, and an athletics track. The complex was demolished in the late 1980s, and all <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>is</b> the entrance gates, close to what is now the White City Retail Park. The gates were designated a Grade II listed structure in 1987.|$|E

25|$|As of a {{few years}} ago, Reid–Hillview Airport had vending machines, a pilot's lounge and break room. Santa Clara County passed a new law stating the {{terminal}} would no longer allow unhealthy food or drinks to be sold inside. This means coffee and all the vending machines that used to be there would no longer exist in the terminal. Now, all <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>is</b> a water drinking fountain and bathrooms. However, there is still a seating area inside the terminal.|$|E

25|$|The Hacienda de San Antonio Atlacomulco {{is located}} {{south of the}} Cuernavaca and was {{established}} by Hernán Cortés {{as one of the}} first sugar plantations in Mexico. Descendants of the Conquistador held the property until the 19th century, when it became the property of Lucas Alamán, who modernized the facility. The hacienda lost its surrounding properties during the Mexican Revolution and all <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>is</b> the main house. After a long period of restoration and modification, the hacienda today houses an exclusive hotel, which can accommodate conventions and banquets.|$|E
25|$|There are {{suggestions}} of that Naderipour {{might have been}} subjected to torture after being detained by the revolutionary government, therefore the details of his narrative, which was obtained under duress, is questionable by all standards. The circumstance of Bijan Jazani's death will remain a mystery. The only truth <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>is</b> that he was killed by execution shortly before finishing his sentence. All of Jazani's books were written in prison from 1970 to 1974. They discussed the establishment of the independent leftist movement in the two decades of the 1960s and '70s. Jazani is buried in the 33rd block of Behesht-e Zahra cemetery.|$|E
25|$|The {{area around}} Dubmill has been settled {{since before the}} Roman occupation, as a Bronze Age sword {{believed}} to date back to 1100BC was discovered on nearby Salta Moss. Dubmill, and the surrounding coastline from Carlisle as far south-west as Maryport, was fortified by the Romans. A series of milefortlets were placed along the coast beyond {{the western end of}} Hadrian's Wall to guard against coastal raids from across the Solway Firth. Milefortlet 17 was located at Dubmill, and would have been constructed from turf and timber. Its location has been discovered, though all <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>is</b> a slight depression in the ground where one of the fort's ditches would have been.|$|E

25|$|In 2001, Caseros Prison {{was officially}} {{shut down and}} slated for demolition. The 5-million peso no-bid {{contract}} was awarded to the military. The implosion of the building, originally planned for 2003, was delayed for years due to legal issues. The prison {{stood in the middle}} of a residential neighborhood, within blocks of two separate hospitals. The neighbors worried about the impact an implosion of such a building would have on the air. After a drawn out court battle, and environmental impact studies, it was agreed to demolish the prison by hand, floor by floor from the top down. As of 2008, the center buildings have been demolished. All <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>is</b> the perimeter wall of the base, and the older original Caseros prison next door.|$|E
25|$|Compression fossils, such {{as those}} of fossil ferns, are the result of {{chemical}} reduction of the complex organic molecules composing the organism's tissues. In this case the fossil consists of original material, albeit in a geochemically altered state. This chemical change is an expression of diagenesis. Often what remains is a carbonaceous film known as a phytoleim, in which case the fossil is known as a compression. Often, however, the phytoleim is lost and all <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>is</b> an impression of the organism in the rock—an impression fossil. In many cases, however, compressions and impressions occur together. For instance, when the rock is broken open, the phytoleim will often be attached to one part (compression), whereas the counterpart will just be an impression. For this reason, one term covers the two modes of preservation: adpression.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of examples excavated to date, have evidence of either decorative silvering of the iron, or {{are covered by}} costly silver or silver-gilt sheathing; a job entrusted to men called barbaricarii The Berkasovo-I example is decorated with many glass gems on the bowl, cheekpieces, and neckguard. For a number of extant helmets all <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>is</b> the decorative silver or gold sheathing, the iron having corroded away entirely. A single helmet found at Intercisa in Hungary, where a hoard of 15-20 helmets was unearthed, has a tall, integral, iron crest attached to the ridge. A similar helmet found at Augst has three slots in its ridge for the attachment of a separate crest. There have also been finds of unattached crest pieces, or ones attached to only the ridge of the helmet.|$|E

50|$|In 1996, the Burmese {{government}} {{announced that the}} cemetery would <b>be</b> demolished and <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>were</b> to be relocated to Yayway Cemetery.

The Kyauktawgyi Buddha Temple on Mindhamma Hill was built on the site of the former cemetery.|$|R
25|$|Not all <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>is</b> bone. There may be melted metal lumps from missed jewellery; casket furniture; dental fillings; and {{surgical}} implants, such as hip replacements. Breast implants {{do not have}} to be removed before cremation. Large items such as titanium hip replacements (which tarnish but do not melt) or casket hinges are usually removed before processing, as they may damage the processor. (If they are missed at first, they must ultimately be removed before processing is complete, as items such as titanium joint replacements are far too durable to be ground). Implants may be returned to the family, but are more commonly sold as ferrous/non-ferrous scrap metal. After the remains are processed, smaller bits of metal such as tooth fillings, and rings (commonly known as gleanings) are sieved out and may be later interred in common, consecrated ground in a remote area of the cemetery. They may also be sold as precious metal scrap.|$|E
25|$|I {{should be}} bitter, but I am not. Disappointed, yes, because {{after so many}} heartbreaks this was a rather {{ruthless}} end. I was the fall guy, the player who carried the ACB flag all summer against all the odds. I had to cop it sweet then, and I had to cop my dismissal the same way... We were lambs to the slaughter anyway. Besides or own cricketing shortcomings, we were forced o play on wickets that suited the Englishmen and were alien to us; we copped the bad end of umpiring decisions to a damning degree throughout the Ashes series and we were crucified by media in many quarters from beginning to end. All this, combined with the talented opposition which was expected to whitewash us anyway, was just too much. The hurt <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>is</b> that I tried so hard, {{and so did the}} young, raw team that took on so much despite all the ods. My name is now eternally entrenched in the cords books as the man who led this country to that ignominious hiding against England.|$|E
25|$|After her 1886–87 tour, Bernhardt recuperated on Belle-Île, a {{small island}} off the coast of Brittany, 10 miles south of the Quiberon peninsula. She {{purchased}} a ruined 17th-century fortress, located {{at the end of the}} island and approached by a drawbridge, and turned it into her vacation retreat. Between 1886 and 1922, she spent nearly every summer, the season when her theater was closed, on Belle-Île. She built bungalows for her son Maurice and her grandchildren, and bungalows with studios for her close friends, the painters Georges Clairin and Louise Abbéma. She also took with her her large collection of animals, including several dogs, two horses, a donkey, a hawk given to her by the Russian Grand Duke Alexis, an Andean wildcat, and a boa constrictor she had brought back from her tour of South America. She entertained many visitors at Belle-Île, including King Edward VII, who stopped by the island on a cruise aboard the royal yacht. Always wrapped in white scarves, she played tennis (under house rules that required that she be the winner) and cards, read plays, and created sculptures and ornaments in her studio. When the fishermen of the island suffered a bad season, she organized a benefit performance with leading actors to raise funds for them. She gradually enlarged the estate, purchasing a neighboring hotel and all the land with a view of the property, but in 1922, as her health declined, she abruptly sold it and never returned. During the Second World War, the Germans occupied the island, and in October 1944, before leaving the island, they dynamited most of the compound. All <b>that</b> <b>remains</b> <b>is</b> the original old fort, and a seat cut into the rock where Bernhardt awaited the boat that took her to the mainland.|$|E
