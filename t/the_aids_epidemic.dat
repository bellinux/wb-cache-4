5|$|And the Band Played On: Politics, People, and <b>the</b> <b>AIDS</b> <b>Epidemic</b> is a 1987 book by San Francisco Chronicle {{journalist}} Randy Shilts. The book {{chronicles the}} discovery and {{spread of the}} human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) with a special emphasis on government indifference and political infighting—specifically in the United States—to what was then perceived as a specifically gay disease. Shilts' premise is that AIDS was allowed to happen: while the disease {{is caused by a}} biological agent, incompetence and apathy toward those initially affected allowed its spread to become much worse.|$|E

His range is broad, and although he {{is best known for}} his photographs, he is essentially a maker of objects, video and installation. Vázquez art has been focused in exploring ideas related with the construction of knowledge, history, Memory, identity and migration. The intention has been to investigate and reflect on how the state imposes, reproduces and legitimizes acceptable social practices. His book [...] "The Realm of Waiting", published in 1990 and produced by the Humanities of Art and the Ponce Museum of Art in Puerto Rico was awarded best book of art of the year by the Puerto Rico Art Critic Association for been one of the first works of art that has dealt with <b>the</b> <b>Aid</b> <b>Epidemic</b> in <b>the</b> United States.|$|R

5|$|The World Health Organization (WHO), {{which focuses}} on {{international}} health issues and disease eradication, is another of the UN's largest agencies. In 1980, the agency announced that the eradication of smallpox had been completed. In subsequent decades, WHO largely eradicated polio, river blindness, and leprosy. The Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), begun in 1996, co-ordinates the organization's response to <b>the</b> <b>AIDS</b> <b>epidemic.</b> The UN Population Fund, which also dedicates part of its resources to combating HIV, is the world's largest source of funding for reproductive health and family planning services.|$|E
5|$|Since then, {{the hospice}} {{industry}} has rapidly expanded. This growth has accompanied <b>the</b> <b>AIDS</b> <b>epidemic</b> and {{the aging of}} the population, with related illnesses. By 1995, hospices were a $2.8 billion industry, with $1.9 billion from Medicare alone funding patients in 1,857 hospice programs with Medicare certification. In that year, 72% of hospice providers were non-profit. By 1998, there were 3,200 hospices either in operation or under development throughout the United States and Puerto Rico, according to the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization (NHPCO). According to 2007's Last Rights: Rescuing the End of Life from the Medical System, hospice sites are expanding at a national rate of about 3.5% per year. In 2007, 1.4 million people in the United States used hospice, with more than one-third of dying Americans using the service, approximately 39%. In 2008, Medicare alone, which pays for 80% of hospice treatment, paid $10 billion to the 4,000 Medicare-certified providers in the United States.|$|E

40|$|Using {{available}} {{data on the}} distribution of HIV/AIDS prevalence across population groups for four sub-Saharan African countries and transposing this information to household income and expenditure surveys, we simulate the impact of HIV/AIDS on poverty and inequality. We find that the epidemic lowers average income and increases poverty, and that the jump in poverty is larger than expected from the fall in average income. This disproportionate increase in poverty reflects the large share of the population living on the threshold of poverty and the higher HIV prevalence rates in those segments of the population.

40|$|Poverty and {{inequality}} in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) {{should not be}} ascertained only {{on the basis of}} scarce and unreliable income distribution statistics, but should also take into account social conditions. Recent, widely disseminated claims that poverty {{and inequality}} have increased over the past 30 years are based on regional income estimates with falling medians and rising upper variances over that period. Graphically, this translates into pyramid-shaped income distributions that, perversely, shift to the left and widen over time. However, during the same period social indicators improved significantly (if insufficiently), and we argue in this paper that such a trend represents progress with social equity in SSA. This point is illustrated through the configuration of alternative "social pyramids" that move {{for most of the last}} 30 years in the right direction. However, more recently, social indicators are being set back by the HIV/AIDS pandemic, which will generate greater and more dehumanizing poverty in the years ahead even if meaningful economic growth is achieved. As underscored by the multiplicity of "pyramid" representations, poverty and inequality time trends in SSA can thus best be described as disconcerting in that they remain arguably illusive and definitely disturbing.

40|$|An {{introduction}} {{is given}} in the most adequate instrument of research to describe and understand our ever changing world in a quantitative way: computer simulation. The way computer simulation entered {{the domain of the}} social sciences is described in a historical overview. Thereafter system dynamics is presented as a middle of the road approach for social scientist who want to use computer simulation. The methodology of system dynamics is demonstrated with exercises done by the participants on PC’s with <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> of user‐friendly software: STELLA. From a verbal description of a simple social problem, such as how to become rich by doing nothing, or how to prevent a disaster such as <b>aids</b> <b>epidemic,</b> cause and effect diagrams are made. Then those diagrams are translated in simulation models with which one can experiment to search for a solution of the problem. With such exercises the underlying logic of system dynamics models is made clear, especially concerning the simple mathematics of differential equations. Thereby it is explained: 1) what linear differential equations are and what problems they can solve and what problems they can’t solve; 2) why non linear differential equations are most of the time better suited to model social situations and problems. With the later the most intriguing domain of modern simulation research arrives. That is to describe the surprising world of chaos and order. Participants are introduced in advanced computer simulation with fascinating non linear models of growth of a population, the spread of a disease and communication between human beings. A relation with more advanced software such as Matlab, to understand better the logic of non linear differential equations and to look more careful at the fit of a non linear model, is laid with more advanced exercises...|$|R
40|$|Use of inter-loop aiding for {{improving}} tracking performance {{has been widely}} researched in recent years. However, most of <b>the</b> previously proposed <b>aiding</b> schemes rely {{on the assumption that}} <b>the</b> <b>aiding</b> loop remains unaffected by received interference. This paper argues that this may not always be the case. It is likely that the performance of <b>the</b> <b>aiding</b> loop may also degrade in the case where interference is received at <b>the</b> <b>aiding</b> carrier’s frequency resulting in performance degradation of both aiding and aided loops. This paper proposes an aiding scheme that offers performance improvements in case interference corrupts both frequencies. Also, an algorithm is proposed that continuously updates <b>the</b> <b>aided</b> loop bandwidth to keep its jitter at a minimum. A relationship between the quality of <b>the</b> <b>aiding</b> signal and its effects on the performance of <b>the</b> <b>aided</b> loop is analysed. An adaptive Kalman filter-based implementation of <b>the</b> <b>aiding</b> architecture is proposed to improve <b>the</b> quality of <b>aiding</b> estimates.

40|$|We {{examine a}} two country aid model with {{performance}} intensive <b>aid.</b> <b>The</b> <b>aid</b> budget {{is determined by}} a donor country legislature, but allocated by a donor agency {{in terms of a}} performance criterion of its choice. Five sources of slippage in policy delivery are introduced: the donor agency observes the performance of <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> recipient imperfectly; <b>the</b> donor agency and <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> recipient are subject to inefficiency; <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> recipient experiences corruption; and adjustment of aid recipient performance is costly. Incentives between <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> donor and <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> recipient are intentionally aligned - to explore the best-case for the policy intervention. Immediate implications are then that optimal level of effort and governance in <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> recipient increase under performance intensity of aid. Moreover, performance intensity of aid has fundraising effects. While <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> recipient also has an incentive to increase the measurement noise in governance, this incentive is weaker than that to raise true underlying governance, is weakest for <b>the</b> poorest <b>aid</b> recipients and provided that the donor agency is sufficiently efficient, measurement error itself will serve to raise optimal effort in <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> recipient. <b>The</b> importance of <b>aid</b> agency self-monitoring is thereby identified. Three important qualifications on the anticipated success of the policy emerge, however. Despite the elimination of incentive misalignment, aid donors may come to rely on performance intensity precisely where such a reliance is likely to be least successful in aid recipients. Second, performance intensity of aid maximizes its impact under conditions where it is supplemented by technical assistance to improve the effectiveness of own effort by <b>the</b> <b>aid</b> recipient. Finally, under convex adjustment costs the general class of optimal time paths in governance in aid recipients will be non-monotone, such that governance may get worse before they get better - optimally so. Performance intensive policy may thus appear to fail - immediately after imposition. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{study the}} effect of {{external}} infection sources on phase transitions in epidemic processes. In particular, we consider an epidemic spreading on a network via the SIS/SIR dynamics, which in addition is aided by external agents- sources unconstrained by the graph, but possessing a limited infection rate or virulence. Such a model captures many existing models of externally <b>aided</b> <b>epidemics,</b> and finds use in many settings- epidemiology, marketing and advertising, network robustness, etc. We provide a detailed characterization {{of the impact of}} external agents on epidemic thresholds. In particular, for the SIS model, we show that any external infection strategy with constant virulence either fails to significantly affect the lifetime of an epidemic, or at best, sustains the epidemic for a lifetime which is polynomial in the number of nodes. On the other hand, a random external-infection strategy, with rate increasing linearly in the number of infected nodes, succeeds under some conditions to sustain an exponential epidemic lifetime. We obtain similar sharp thresholds for the SIR model, and discuss the relevance of our results in a variety of settings. I...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} {{the impact of}} HIV/AIDS on per capita output and income, with particular emphasis {{on the role of}} labor mobility between the formal and informal sectors, and the impact of the epidemic on investment decisions. The study finds that HIV/AIDS affects both the supply of labor and the demand for labor in the formal sector. Only if there is a significant rise in the capital-labor ratio, will there be an increase in formal sector employment. However, this is associated with a decline in the rate of return to capital. To the extent that companies respond to this by reducing investment, conventional models underestimate the adverse impact on employment, per capita output, and income.
