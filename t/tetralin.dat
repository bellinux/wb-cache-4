The structure-affinity relationships revealed that the aromatic ring of the benzamide moiety of 1 contributes to the high affinities for all three receptor subtypes. Furthermore, 1 may interact with the dopamine D- 2 and D- 3 receptors through hydrogen bond formation with its carbonyl group. Investigation {{of the role of the}} amide hydrogen atom by amide N-alkylation was not conclusive, since conformational aspects may be responsible for the decreased dopaminergic affinities of the N'-alkylated analogues of 1. The effects of the amide modifications on the serotonin 5 -HT 1 A receptor affinity were less pronounced, suggesting that the benzamidoethyl side-chain of 1 as a whole enhances the affinity for this receptor subtype probably through hydrophobic interactions with an accessory binding site. The structural requirements for the substituents at the basic nitrogen atom supported the hypothesis that the 2 -aminotetralin moieties of the 2 -aminotetralin-derived substituted benzamides may share the same binding sites as the 2 -(N, N-di-n-propylamino) <b>tetralins.</b> (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|A new {{chemical}} class of potential atypical antypsychotic agents, {{based on the}} pharmacological concept of mixed dopamine D- 2 receptor antagonism and serotonin S-HT 1 A receptor agonism, was designed by combining the structural features of the 2 -(N,N-di-n-propylamino) <b>tetralins</b> (DPATs) and the 2 -pyrrolidinylmethyl-derived substituted benzamides ina structural hybrid. Thus, a series of 35 differently substituted 2 -aminotetralin-derived substituted benzamides was synthesized and the compounds were evaluated {{for their ability to}} compete for [H- 3]-raclopride binding to cloned human dopamine D- 2 A and D- 3 receptors, and for [H- 3]- 8 -OH-DPAT binding to rat serotonin S-HT 1 A receptors in vitro. The lead compound of the series, 5 -methoxy- 2 -[N-(2 -benzamidoethyl) -N-n-propylamino]tetralin (12 a), displayed high affinities for the dopamine D- 2 A receptor (K-i = 3. 2 nM), the dopamine D- 3 receptor (K-i = 0. 58 nM) as well as the serotonin 5 -HT 1 A receptor (K-i = 0. 82 nM). The structure-affinity relationships of the series suggest that the 2 -amino-tetralin moieties of the compounds occupy the same binding sites as the DPATs in all three receptor subtypes. The benzamidoethyl side chain enhances the affinities of the compounds for an three receptor subtypes, presumably by occupying an accessory binding site. For the dopamine D- 2 and D- 3 receptors, this accessory binding site may be identical to the binding site of the 2 -pyrrolidinylmethyl-derived substituted benzamides. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Ligand binding studies were used to determine dissociation constants for agonist binding to the 5 -HT 1 A receptor: Ki values for agonists were determined in competition versus the binding of the agonist [3 H]- 8 -OH DPAT. Competition data were all fitted best by a one-binding site model. Ki values for agonists were also determined in competition versus the binding of the antagonist [3 H]-NAD- 199. Competition data were all fitted best by a two-binding site model, and agonist affinities for the higher (Kh) and lower affinity (Kl) sites were determined. The ability of the agonists to activate the 5 -HT 1 A receptor was determined using stimulation of [35 S]-GTPγS binding. Maximal effects of agonists (Emax) and their potencies (EC 50) were determined from concentration/response curves for stimulation of [35 S]-GTPγS binding. Kl/Kh determined from ligand binding assays correlated with the relative efficacy (relative Emax) of agonists determined in [35 S]-GTPγS binding assays. There was also a correlation between Kl/Kh and Kl/EC 50 for agonists determined from ligand binding and [35 S]-GTPγS binding assays.

A partial 5 -HT syndrome was also observed for S-(-) - 12, while the corresponding R-(+) - 12 was found to be inactive at the DA and 5 -HT receptors both in vitro and in vivo. Compounds 6 and 12 were found to be major urinary metabolites following oral administration of their dipropyl analogs (2 and 13, respectively).

Similarly, 12 was proposed to be the metabolite responsible for the partial 5 -HT syndrome seen after oral (but not subcutaneous) administration of 13.

The affinity for α 1 - and α 2 -adrenoceptor-like binding sites was obtained from radioligand displacement studies. The 5 - and 7 -OH substituted <b>tetralins</b> as well as DPDA were reasonably potent and about equieffective pressor agents. The 6 -OH congener had almost no vasoconstrictor effects whereas the 8 -OH positional isomer occupied an intermediate position. The 5, 6 - and 6, 7 -di-OH analogs very effectively raised the diastolic pressure of pithed rats. On account of the inhibition exerted by prazosin (0. 1 mg/kg) and yohimbine (1 mg/kg) the 5 - and 7 -OH isomers as well as DPDA can be classified as mixed α 1 /α 2 -adrenoceptor agonists, the α 1 -adrenoceptor-stimulating potency being more pronounced, especially for the 5 -OH congener. In addition, a significant contribution of serotonin receptors to the pressor responses to the 8 -OH compound was detected. Similarly, α 2 -adrenoceptors were mainly responsible for the vasoconstriction caused by the 6, 7 -di-OH isomer, whereas the 5, 6 -di-OH congener very selectively stimulated this α 2 -type receptor in the lower dose range and α 1 -adrenoceptor stimulation predominated at higher doses of this agonist. The 6, 7 -di-OH compound failed to activate vascular postjunctional β 2 -adrenoceptors. The results indicate that the α 1 /α 2 -adrenoceptor agonist activity depends on the position(s) and the number of hydroxy groups present {{as well as on the}} alkyl substitution at the amino function. 2 -N,N-Di-n-propylamino- 6, 7 -dihydroxytetralin may be a more suitable α 2 -adrenoceptor selective agonist than M- 7...|$|R
40|$|Microscale sealed vessel {{pyrolysis}} (MSSVpy) {{with online}} gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used {{with several other}} established and complementary analytical methods to robustly characterize the structure of aquatic natural organic matter (NOM) and to practically assess the analytical value of MSSVpy. The NOM {{used in the study}} was from North Pine (NP) reservoir, {{which is one of the}} major source waters supplying Brisbane, the capital city of the Australian state of Queensland. The reservoir has moderate dissolved organic carbon (DOC; 5 mgL(- 1)) levels and is impacted by algae which periodically occur in bloom proportions. The hydrophobic (HPO; 65 % initial DOC) and transphilic (TPI; 12 %) fractions showed H/C values > 1, low UV(abs) and low aryl-C measured by NMR which are all indicative of low aromaticity. MSSVpy produced distinctly higher product concentrations than traditional flash pyrolysis and the molecular profile of the HPO and TPI fractions revealed by MSSVpy was correlated with the other analytical data to help establish their structural relevance. Prolific distributions of alkyl substituted aromatic (e. g., benzenes, naphthalenes) and hydroaromatic (e. g., <b>tetralins)</b> products detected in the HPO fraction were attributed to the aromatisation of terpanes and other aliphatic compounds from algal, and possibly also plant sources. Alkyl phenols also detected in HPO in high abundance, are probably from algal biopolymers, but may also reflect a contribution from non-methoxylated lignin units of catchment grasses. There was no analytical evidence of the dihydroxy or methoxy aromatic structures typical of wood lignin or tannin. N-organic pyrolysates (e. g., alkyl pyrroles, pyridines, indoles) of diagenetically altered proteins were concentrated in the TPI fraction. The quantitative importance of the N-organic moiety of the TPI fraction was corroborated by a low C/N ratio and distinctive amide and amine signals detected by (13) C NMR and FTIR.

40|$| {{the waste}} waters may reflect {{additional}} anthropogenic sources (e. g. sewerage, industrial chemicals), which may also involve thermally catalysed reaction between H 2 S and humic substances, {{analogous to the}} interaction of inorganic S and functionalised lipids during sedimentary diagenesis. CHAPTER 5 was concerned with the notably high concentrations of N products (3 - 50 %) detected by MSSV Py GC-MS of the NOM samples. These products included a large range of alkyl- pyrroles, pyridines, pyrazines and pyridinamines, as well as amine substituted mono-aromatics and condensed N-heterocyclics. They were consistently detected over {{a broader range of}} MSSV Py conditions. Many of these products, particularly those with increased alkyl substitution were not detected by flash pyrolysis; leading to an historic underestimation of their contribution to NOM. Highest concentrations of N-products were detected in the COL fraction of NOM. Similarly high concentrations and distributions were also detected from the organic material prone to foul ultrafiltration membranes, confirming the colloid rich nature of this material. The distinctive low MW N-heterocyclic products of the COL fractions were correlated with the N-products of the amino sugar standard, {{and to a lesser extent}} the protein standards. The occurrence in high concentrations of low MW heterocyclics also provides potentially rare evidence for the environmental occurrence of Maillard reactions. The interaction of sugars and amino acids via Maillard processes may be an important contributor to humic substances, although there is much doubt about whether this process is supported by ambient or near surface temperatures. As these reactions are more favourable at high temperatures they may be artefacts of the MSSV Py process. However, MSSV Py of mixtures of carbohydrate and amino acid standards showed no evidence for the production of additional low MW heterocyclics. The waste waters showed relatively high concentrations of alkyl carbazoles and β-carbolines, potentially derived from alkaloid precursors of plants, algae and bacteria, which have been implicated in toxic N-DBPs from potable water treatment. To practically assess the analytical benefits of MSSV pyrolysis for NOM characterisation, it was used in combination with other established analytical methods to holistically characterise the NOM of the North Pine (NP) reservoir, a major source of the potable water supplies of Brisbane and SE Queensland. The NP water is of low colour and has moderate dissolved organic carbon (DOC; 5 mg L- 1) levels, but is impacted by algae which periodically occur in bloom proportions. The hydrophobic (HPO; 65 % initial DOC) and transphilic (TPI; 12 %) fractions from XAD resin separation of the DOC both showed high (> 1) H/C values, low UVabs characteristics and low aromatic-C measured by NMR, which are all indicative of a relatively low degree of aromaticity. However, MSSV Py of both fractions, in particular the HPO fraction, yielded prolific distributions of alkyl substituted aromatic hydrocarbon (i. e., benzenes, naphthalenes) and hydroaromatic (e. g. <b>tetralins)</b> products. These were attributed to aromatisation of aliphatic structural precursors, including terpenoids of algae and plants, which are usually difficult to detect by analytical pyrolysis. MSSV Py of both fractions also yielded high concentrations of alkyl phenols, which likely reflect contribution from non-methoxylated lignin units of catchment grasses, consistent with the vast forest cleared grassland regions of the NP catchment, but may also derive from algal biopolymers. None of the analytical methods used showed any significant evidence of dihydroxy or methoxy aromatic structures of wood lignin or tannin inputs. MSSVpy of the TPI fraction showed very high abundances of N-products (e. g., alkyl pyrroles, pyridines, indoles) reflecting the structural significance of diagenetically altered proteins, most likely derived from algal biomass. In contrast, much fewer Nproducts were detected by flash Py. This demonstrates the analytical capacity of MSSV to access the significant N content of this fraction, which was quantitatively indicated by low C/N ratio, measured by elemental analysis, and high amide and amine signals by 13 C NMR and FTIR spectroscopy. Whilst MSSV generated much higher product concentrations than flash Py or TMAH thermochemolysis, the latter methods did include unique product information demonstrating the complementary nature of different pyrolysis methods. Overall, this case study demonstrates the significant contribution MSSV Py has made to characterising the structure and sources of the Brisbane source water, clearly distinguishing it from humic black waters such as the Gartempe, Arroyo Sanchez and Suwannee Rivers studied in preceding chapters. This PhD project represents the first detailed study of the potential of using MSSV Py to assist the organic speciation and molecular characterisation of biochemically rich NOM. Important additional pyrolysis information can be released with this analytical method which represents an obvious complement to conventional flash pyrolysis techniques where chromatographic resolution of polar biochemicals can be limited. The full realization of this approach, however, will need much further development as briefly alluded to in the closing comments of CHAPTER 7. It is hoped that the present project makes a significant early step in the realization of this potential...|$|R
