5|$|While {{the civil}} rights {{movement}} fought against racial segregation, MalcolmX advocated the complete separation of blacks from whites. The Nation of Islam proposed the establishment of a separate country for African Americans in the southern or southwestern United States as an interim measure until African Americans could return to Africa. MalcolmX suggested the United States government owed reparations to black people for the unpaid labor of their ancestors. He also rejected {{the civil rights}} movement's strategy of nonviolence, advocating instead <b>that</b> <b>black</b> <b>people</b> should defend themselves.|$|E
5|$|The Citizenship Clause {{overruled}} the Supreme Court's Dred Scott decision <b>that</b> <b>black</b> <b>people</b> {{were not}} citizens {{and could not}} become citizens, nor enjoy the benefits of citizenship. Some members of Congress voted for the Fourteenth Amendment in order to eliminate doubts about {{the constitutionality of the}} Civil Rights Act of 1866, or to ensure that no subsequent Congress could later repeal or alter the main provisions of that Act. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 had granted citizenship to all persons born in the United States if they were not subject to a foreign power, and this clause of the Fourteenth Amendment constitutionalized this rule.|$|E
5|$|The Wrestlers is an oil {{study from}} life, {{depicting}} {{a black and}} a white wrestler grappling. Although at first glance the white wrestler appears to be dominant, the figures are in fact equally matched; this was unusual for the time, {{as it was a}} common belief in Britain in this period <b>that</b> <b>black</b> <b>people</b> were physically weaker than whites. Showing the subjects under bright light, the painting is a combination of intense juxtapositions between intimacy and violence, dark and light skin, and hard and soft surfaces. The black wrestler is naked; the white wrestler wears a loincloth, although it is possible that this was added after Etty's death. The intense light casts deep shadows, emphasising the curves and musculature of the wrestlers' bodies, as the skin of the two combatants is stretched and distorted under the pressure of the grapple. The figures are set against a dark green curtain and a brown wall, rather than in a wrestling ring.|$|E
50|$|Finally we {{hear the}} story of The Bell Curve, a bestseller <b>that</b> claimed <b>that</b> <b>black</b> <b>people's</b> poor {{performance}} in IQ tests proved their intellectual inferiority. Criticism {{of this has been}} given little attention. The book's research was funded by the Pioneer Fund and underpins racial eugenics. Racial privilege endures, continuing to shape destinies the world over.|$|R

25|$|Black {{nationalism}} {{is a type}} of nationalism or racism which holds the belief <b>that</b> <b>black</b> <b>people</b> are a race and seeks to develop and maintain a black national identity.|$|E
25|$|The Jeffries case led {{to debate}} about tenure, {{academic}} freedom and free speech. He was sometimes compared to Michael Levin, a Jewish CUNY professor who {{outside of the}} classroom claimed <b>that</b> <b>black</b> <b>people</b> are inferior, and had recently won against the school in court.|$|E
5000|$|Joseph Smith opposed interracial marriages. He once {{indicated}} that he felt <b>that</b> <b>black</b> <b>peoples</b> should be [...] "confined by strict law to their own species," [...] which some have said directly opposes Smith's advocacy for all other civil rights. In Nauvoo, it was against the law for black men to marry whites, and Joseph Smith fined two black men for violating his probation of intermarriage between blacks and whites.|$|R
50|$|In 1995, Noam Chomsky {{criticized the}} books {{conclusions}} {{about race and}} the notion <b>that</b> <b>Blacks</b> and <b>people</b> with lower IQs having more children is even a problem.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Black is beautiful" [...] {{cultural}} movement aimed {{to dispel the}} notion <b>that</b> <b>black</b> <b>people's</b> natural features such as skin color, facial features and hair are inherently ugly. John Sweat Rock {{was the first to}} coin the phrase [...] "Black is Beautiful", in the slavery era. The movement asked that men and women stop straightening their hair and attempting to lighten or bleach their skin. The prevailing idea in American culture was <b>that</b> <b>black</b> features are less attractive or desirable than white features. The movement is largely responsible for the popularity of the Afro.|$|R
25|$|Both Joseph Smith and Brigham Young {{referred}} to the curse as a justification for slavery. In addition, Brigham Young used the curse to bar blacks from the priesthood, ban interracial marriages, and oppose black suffrage. He stated that the curse {{would one day be}} lifted and <b>that</b> <b>black</b> <b>people</b> would be able to receive the priesthood post-mortally.|$|E
25|$|During {{the first}} half of the 20th century, a small number of African Americans {{established}} groups based on Islamic and Gnostic teachings. The first of such groups created was the Moorish Science Temple of America, founded by Timothy Drew (Drew Ali) in 1913. Drew taught <b>that</b> <b>black</b> <b>people</b> were of Moorish origin but their Muslim identity was taken away through slavery and racial segregation, advocating the return to Islam of their Moorish ancestry.|$|E
25|$|Theodore Gilmore Bilbo (October 13, 1877August 21, 1947) was an American {{politician}} who twice served {{as governor of}} Mississippi (1916–20, 1928–32) and later was elected a U.S. Senator (1935–47). A master of filibuster and scathing rhetoric, a rough-and-tumble fighter in debate, he made his name a synonym for white supremacy. Like many Southern Democrats of his era, Bilbo believed <b>that</b> <b>black</b> <b>people</b> were inferior; he defended segregation, {{and was a member}} of the Ku Klux Klan.|$|E

50|$|In June 2007 the Home Affairs Select Committee {{published}} {{a report on}} young <b>black</b> <b>people</b> and {{the criminal justice system}} of England and Wales. It said <b>that</b> young <b>black</b> <b>people</b> were over-represented at all stages of the criminal justice system. The Commission for Racial Equality and youth charities welcomed the report.|$|R
25|$|Another black American entrepreneur, J.B. Stradford, {{arrived in}} Tulsa in 1899. He {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>black</b> <b>people</b> {{had a better}} chance of economic progress if they pooled their resources, worked together and supported each other's businesses. He bought large tracts of real estate in the northeastern part of Tulsa, which he had subdivided and sold exclusively to other blacks. Gurley {{and a number of other}} blacks soon followed suit. Stradford later built the Stradford Hotel on Greenwood, where blacks could enjoy the amenities of the downtown hotels who served only whites. It was said to be the largest black-owned hotel in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Garvey {{supported}} {{the idea of}} global racial separatism and rejected the idea <b>that</b> <b>black</b> <b>people</b> of African descent living in the Americas should campaign for their civil rights; instead he believed that they should migrate en masse back to Africa. His ideas were opposed by many blacks in the Americas and he experienced hostility from African-American civil rights activists like W. E. B. Du Bois. He also faced opposition from the government of Liberia, which did not want millions of unskilled migrants arriving on its shores. As a mass movement, Garveyism declined in the Great Depression of the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|Around that time, one of Williams' acquaintances, a {{coloured}} lawyer named Edgar Maresse Smith, {{petitioned the}} Governor to declare 1 August a holiday for {{the celebration of}} Emancipation. Robinson did not support it but Gorrie did. Even at that time, there was in Trinidad a highly educated, articulate and race-conscious group of black men, among them John Jacob Thomas, Maresse Smith, Mzumbo Lazare, C. E. Petioni, the Reverend Phillip Henry Douglin. Thomas particularly was famous for his book Froudacity (1889), in which he refuted and questioned the view espoused by Oxford historian James Anthony Froude <b>that</b> <b>black</b> <b>people</b> could not be entrusted with self-government. Thomas's ideas certainly inspired Williams.|$|E
5000|$|It aims {{to dispel}} the notion in many {{cultures}} <b>that</b> <b>black</b> <b>people's</b> natural features such as skin color, facial features and hair are inherently ugly. John Rock (abolitionist) was long {{thought to be the}} first to coin the phrase [...] "black is beautiful" [...] - during a speech in 1858 - but historical records indicate he never actually used the specific phrase on that day. The movement also encouraged men and women to stop trying to eliminate African-identified traits by straightening their hair and attempting to lighten or bleach their skin.|$|R
2500|$|After Smith's {{death in}} 1844, Brigham Young became {{president}} of {{the main body of the}} church and led the Mormon pioneers to what would become the Utah Territory. Like many Americans at the time, Young, who was also the territorial governor, promoted discriminatory views about <b>black</b> <b>people.</b> On January 16, 1852, Young made a pronouncement to the Utah Territorial Legislature, stating that [...] "any man having one drop of the seed of ... in him [...] hold the priesthood." [...] As recorded in the Journal of Discourses, Young taught <b>that</b> <b>black</b> <b>people's</b> position as [...] "servant of servants" [...] was a law under heaven and it was not the church's place to change God's law.|$|R
5000|$|Clay {{launches}} into a monologue. Clay suggests <b>that</b> whites let <b>black</b> <b>people</b> dance [...] "black" [...] dances and make [...] "black" [...] music. He explains that these segregatory actions assuage black Americans' anger towards whites and distracts them from accessing the [...] "white man's intellectual legacy." [...] Clay states <b>that</b> if <b>black</b> <b>people</b> {{stopped trying to}} heal their pain through dance, music, civic participation, religion, or focusing on moving upwards in American society, and became coldly rational like white <b>people,</b> <b>black</b> <b>people</b> would just kill all the whites {{and be done with}} racism in America. Clay says that if he were to take Lula's words to heart, he should just kill all the white people he meets.|$|R
25|$|That {{last part}} of Sojourner's speech brings in her main focus. Some freed enslaved people were living on {{government}} aid at that time, paid for by taxpayers. Sojourner announces {{that this is not}} any better for those colored people than it is for the members of her audience. She then proposes <b>that</b> <b>black</b> <b>people</b> are given their own land. Because a portion of the South's population contained rebels that were unhappy with the abolishment of slavery, that region of the United States was not well suited for colored people. She goes on to suggest that colored people be given land out west to build homes and prosper on.|$|E
25|$|Contemporary black {{commentators}} {{argued that}} to white audiences, Connelly's The Green Pastures simply reinforced the notion <b>that</b> <b>black</b> <b>people</b> presented {{a danger that}} needed to be contained. Weisenfeld argues that this is also the case with Freleng's parody. To white viewers in the 1930s, the film's implication that blacks care for nothing but gambling, drinking, and dancing only reinforces notions of the dangers posed by urban blacks. According to Goldmark, the choice of performers caricatured is telling; that Armstrong and Calloway are depicted as angels indicates that their crossover appeal was strong enough among whites that white audiences would not have felt threatened by the notion that they were angels in Heaven. Weisenfeld notes that by focusing the narrative on Saint Peter and his Stepin Fetchit underling, the animators ducked the potential offense white audiences might have felt upon seeing a black God.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} 200 years <b>that</b> <b>black</b> <b>people</b> {{were in the}} United States, they {{primarily}} identified themselves by their specific ethnic group (closely allied to language) and not by skin color. Individuals identified themselves, for example, as Ashanti, Igbo, Bakongo, or Wolof. However, when the first captives {{were brought to the}} Americas, they were often combined with other groups from West Africa, and individual ethnic affiliations were not generally acknowledged by English colonists. In areas of the Upper South, different ethnic groups were brought together. This is significant as the captives came from a vast geographic region: the West African coastline stretching from Senegal to Angola and in some cases from the south-east coast such as Mozambique. A new African-American identity and culture was born that incorporated elements of the various ethnic groups and of European cultural heritage, resulting in fusions such as the Black church and Black English. This new identity was based on provenance and slave status rather than membership in any one ethnic group. By contrast, slave records from Louisiana show that the French and Spanish colonists recorded more complete identities of the West Africans, including ethnicities and given tribal names.|$|E
5000|$|In 1954 he read {{a copy of}} Drum, a {{magazine}} known for its reporting of urban blacks {{and the effects of}} apartheid. [...] "They were dealing with social issues <b>that</b> affected <b>black</b> <b>people</b> in South Africa. I {{wanted to be part of}} that magazine." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1955 Irons {{went on to}} the Consultative Committee for {{the welfare}} of <b>black</b> <b>people,</b> which was set up by a Council of Church/Social Services and the Colonial Social and Sports Club. The idea was to discuss {{prejudice}} and local issues. One of the problems lay in the fact <b>that</b> no <b>black</b> <b>people</b> were taking advantage of educational courses, particularly those held by the WEA.|$|R
5000|$|There was {{tension between}} black {{communities}} and the police before and since the Broadwater Farm riot in 1985, in which, according to David Lammy, Labour MP for Tottenham, the [...] "cracks that already existed between {{the police and the}} community became deep fissures". Since 1985 [...] "there had been some progress made in the relationship between the local community and the police", but the shooting [...] "raised tension". Lammy stated that Duggan's death occurred as part of [...] "a history in Tottenham that involves deaths in police custody". [...] Claudia Webbe, the chairperson of Operation Trident, asserted <b>that</b> many <b>black</b> <b>people</b> see Duggan's shooting as [...] "yet another unjust death in custody" [...] and <b>that</b> young <b>black</b> <b>people</b> in Tottenham are [...] "still six, seven, eight {{times more likely to be}} stopped and searched than their white counterparts".|$|R
500|$|Up {{until one}} week before his death, MalcolmX {{continued}} to publicly advocate <b>that</b> <b>black</b> <b>people</b> should achieve advancement [...] "by any means necessary".|$|E
500|$|MalcolmX taught <b>that</b> <b>black</b> <b>people</b> {{were the}} {{original}} {{people of the}} world, and that white people were a race of devils who were created by an evil scientist named Yakub. The Nation of Islam believed <b>that</b> <b>black</b> <b>people</b> were superior to white people, and that {{the demise of the}} white race was imminent. When questioned concerning his statements that white people were devils, MalcolmX said: [...] "history proves the white man is a devil." [...] "Anybody who rapes, and plunders, and enslaves, and steals, and drops hell bombs on people... anybody who does these things is nothing but a devil." ...|$|E
500|$|Although racial {{discrimination}} continued in England, {{this case was}} the first to challenge such practices in court. Critics regard it as a milestone in British racial equality in demonstrating <b>that</b> <b>black</b> <b>people</b> had legal recourse against some forms of racism. According to Mason, it [...] "was one of the key milestones along the road {{to the creation of the}} Race Relations Act of 1965." ...|$|E
5000|$|Black {{pride is}} a {{movement}} in response to dominant white cultures and ideologies <b>that</b> encourages <b>black</b> <b>people</b> to celebrate <b>black</b> culture and embrace their African heritage. In the United States, it was a direct response to white racism especially during the Civil Rights Movement. Related movements include black power, black nationalism, Black Panthers and Afrocentrism.|$|R
2500|$|One of {{the first}} times that anti-miscegenation {{feelings}} were mentioned by church leaders, occurred on February 6, 1835. An assistant president of the church, W. W. Phelps, wrote a letter theorizing that Ham's wife was a descendant of Cain and that Ham himself was cursed for [...] "marrying a black wife". Joseph Smith wrote that he felt <b>that</b> <b>black</b> <b>peoples</b> should be [...] "confined by strict law to their own species," [...] which some have said directly opposes Smith's advocacy for all other civil rights. In Nauvoo, it was against the law for black men to marry whites, and Joseph Smith fined two black men for violating his probation of intermarriage between blacks and whites.|$|R
