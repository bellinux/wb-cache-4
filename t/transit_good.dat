40|$|Purpose – This {{editorial}} {{seeks to}} compare the German Bibliothekartag, the American Library Association Annual Meeting, and the International Federation of Library Associations meeting. Design/methodology/approach – The method relies mainly on anthropological observation. Findings – Conferences in cities with public <b>transit,</b> <b>good</b> restaurants, and decent technology, including wireless internet and projection in the meeting rooms, offer better opportunities for the social bonding that encourages repeat attendance. Practical implications – Conferences at locations without these features risk losing regulars as technology increasingly enables communication without travel. Originality/value – Interaction with the conference environment {{is not the only}} factor in making a conference experience successful but, without positive interactions, the option of doing business electronically becomes far more attractive.

50|$|The rail {{transport}} system in Denmark consists of 2,633 km of railway lines, of which only the Copenhagen S-train {{network and the}} main line Helsingør-Copenhagen-Padborg (at the German border) are electrified. Most traffic is passenger trains, although there is considerable <b>transit</b> <b>goods</b> traffic between Sweden and Germany.|$|R
50|$|The Port of Koper began {{operations}} by {{handling a}} variety of cargo, in particular fruit, timber, wheat and fodder, general cargos and oil. Initially, imports {{accounted for more than}} half of throughput, and a mere ten percent were Slovenian exports. The balance was accounted for by <b>transit</b> <b>goods</b> destined to the countries of Eastern Europe.|$|R

50|$|In July 2012, Afghanistan and Pakistan {{agreed to}} extend APTTA to Tajikistan in {{what will be}} the first step for the {{establishment}} of a North-South trade corridor. The proposed agreement will provide facilities to Tajikistan to use Pakistan's ports and the Wagah Border for its imports and exports while Pakistan would be granted rights to <b>transit</b> <b>goods</b> across Tajik territory to Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan.|$|R

[...] "Goombroon ware" [...] was the original porcelain imported to England from Goombroon in the early 20th century. It was later replaced by china ware imported from China. Kaolin was the mineral from which the porcelain was made.|$|R

50|$|On 3 July 1945 Thuringia was {{occupied}} by Soviet troops and, because the new zonal border, that followed the old state border, crossed the railway line, train services were suspended. Not until 17 June 1947 was goods traffic reinstated between Probstzella and Lehesten, using a pair of scheduled trains {{and a pair of}} request trains for <b>transit</b> <b>goods.</b> On 12 July 1951 the transit services were suspended again and by 28 May 1952 the section in Thuringia was dismantled.|$|R
50|$|Located on the {{outskirts}} of Bordeaux, Lormont has always been a prosperous village, fishing port, and a place for the <b>transit</b> of <b>goods</b> and people.|$|R
50|$|Before the First War of Schleswig, plans {{had been}} made in Schleswig to {{construct}} a railway from Flensburg, via Husum, to Tönning to limit German influence on trade. However, these plans were hampered by the war and the new political system. In 1852, the construction company Peto, Brassey and Betts (represented in Scandinavia by Samuel Morton Peto) was granted concession to build the line, which opened on October 6, 1854. The railway was very successful, carrying English <b>transit</b> <b>goods</b> until 1857, when the Oresund toll was abolished.|$|R
5000|$|Coastal {{states that}} ratify the {{convention}} (known as [...] "transit states") agree {{to make arrangements}} with land-locked states that are party to the treaty that wish to <b>transit</b> <b>goods</b> across {{the territory of the}} transit state to or from a coastal port in the transit state. The transit states agree that they will not discriminate based on place of origin or destination of the goods being transported. The land-locked states agree to be responsible for any expenses that the transit states incur in supervising or protecting the transit of the land-locked state's goods.|$|R

50|$|Afghanistan and Pakistan {{recently}} {{signed into law}} a new Afghanistan-Pakistan Transit Trade Agreement (APTTA), which allows their shipping trucks to <b>transit</b> <b>goods</b> within both nations. This revised US-sponsored APTTA agreement also allows Afghan trucks to transport exports to India via Pakistan up to the Wagah crossing point. Secondary to concerns regarding smuggling, Pakistani officials insisted that while Afghan exports destined for India can be transited across Pakistani territory, Indian goods cannot in turn be exported to Afghanistan across Pakistani territory. Instead, Afghan trucks offloaded at Wagah may return to Afghanistan loaded only with Pakistani, rather than Indian, goods {{in an attempt to}} curb smuggling.|$|R
50|$|Imports {{were destined}} for the Slovenian and Serbian markets; unlike {{neighbouring}} Croatia, Serbia did not have its own access to the sea. During the early 1960s, outgoing maritime cargo, exports from the European continent, amounted to a mere 20 percent of total traffic, while the proportion of <b>transit</b> <b>goods</b> was similarly low. With nearly the same capacities and improved organisation, 1963 witnessed a throughput of 628,456 tonnes of cargo. This rapid growth {{was the result of}} increased imports of wheat, rice, fertiliser and fodder. As a consequence of its solid performance, in conjunction with its geographic and other advantages, Luka Koper gained the trust of its foreign partners, and recorded record growth.|$|R

By the mid 1700s, Kuwait had already established itself as the major trading route from the Persian Gulf to Aleppo.|$|R
5000|$|The {{free port}} zone is crossed by the future {{international}} transportation corridors [...] "Primorie-1" [...] and [...] "Primorie-2".

50|$|The Agreement aims to: 1) Facilitate {{access to}} {{international}} markets by using land, sea, and/or air transportation through Chabahar Port; and 2) Simplify, harmonize, and standardize procedures governing the international transport and <b>transit</b> of <b>goods</b> and passengers, {{in accordance with}} the international agreements and conventions in which the three signatory governments are members.|$|R
50|$|After the First World War, the {{creation}} of several new land-locked states—such as Czechoslovakia, Austria, and Hungary—caused the great powers to reconsider the issue. The Treaty of Versailles had included provisions by which Germany agreed to allow these land-locked states to freely <b>transit</b> <b>goods</b> and personnel through German territory to sea ports, which suggested that such states may also have their own merchant vessels in such ports. The Declaration was created to reflect the new consensus. The Declaration was concluded and signed on 20 April 1921 by 25 states in Barcelona, Spain, at the League of Nations Conference on Communications and Transit as an addendum to the longer Barcelona Convention and Statute on the Regime of Navigable Waterways of International Concern, which was concluded on the same day. The Declaration entered into force on 8 October 1921.|$|R

50|$|The Tax and Customs Administration (Belastingdienst) is the tax {{collection}} and customs (Douane) {{service of the}} government of the Netherlands. Part of the Ministry of Finance, it is responsible for supervising the import, export and <b>transit</b> of <b>goods,</b> detecting fiscal, economic and financial fraud, levying and collecting taxes, and paying out income-related benefits for childcare, rent and health care.|$|R
25|$|Another part of {{the energy}} dispute is the dispute over oil. In 1995, Russia and Belarus agreed that Russia would not impose any customs on oil {{exported}} to Belarus. In exchange, the revenues from this oil processed in Belarus would be shared by 15% for Belarus and 85% for Russia. In 2001, Belarus unilaterally canceled this agreement while Russia continued its duty-free exports. Lukashenko's state kept all the revenues, and many Russian oil companies moved their processing capacities to Belarus. On this arrangement, Russia also lost billions of dollars annually. Belarus imposed a tariff of US$45 per ton of oil flowing through the Druzhba pipeline, prompting Russia {{to claim that the}} move was illegal and to threaten retaliation, since it contradicts bilateral trade agreements and worldwide practice. Only imported or exported goods are being tariffed while <b>transit</b> <b>goods</b> are not objects of tariffing. Russia rejected paying the newly imposed Belarusian tariffs.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to Canadian Confederation, {{duty-free}} status {{had already}} been accorded by New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Canada to one another, each contingent on the other colonies' granting such status. There was also free trade between the colonies of British North America and the United States of America under the 1854 Reciprocity Treaty, but the United States had served notice in December 1864 that it wished to seek changes to the Treaty, including [...] "modifying the rights of <b>transit</b> <b>goods</b> from Canada through the United States." [...] As goods from Canada were previously allowed {{to pass through the}} US in bond to ports in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia for transshipment to Britain, this represented a potentially significant non-tariff barrier that was on the minds of participants during the 18651867 intercolonial conferences that took place in Charlottetown, Quebec and London that {{led to the creation of}} the Dominion of Canada in 1867.|$|R
50|$|Efforts {{were made}} to promote {{education}} {{and the study of}} medicine. To European merchants, on whom he was dependent for the sale of his exports, Muhammad Ali showed much favor, and under his influence the port of Alexandria again rose into importance. It was also under Muhammad Ali's encouragement that the overland <b>transit</b> of <b>goods</b> from Europe to India via Egypt was resumed.|$|R
50|$|Another {{station was}} built in 1926 for <b>goods</b> <b>transit.</b> The first power station, which {{supplied}} electricity to the railway station, portions of the town, and thirteen nearby villages, was constructed in 1929.|$|R
50|$|Mean kinetic {{temperature}} (MKT) is a simplified {{way of expressing}} the overall effect of temperature fluctuations during storage or <b>transit</b> of perishable <b>goods.</b> The MKT is widely used in the pharmaceutical industry.|$|R
50|$|Other {{domestic}} {{efforts were}} made to promote education and the study of medicine. Muhammad Ali showed much favor, to European merchants, on whom he was dependent for the sale of his monopoly exports, and under his influence the port of Alexandria again rose into importance. It was also under Muhammad Ali's encouragement that the overland <b>transit</b> of <b>goods</b> from Europe to India via Egypt was resumed.|$|R
50|$|While the British {{government}} {{was at first}} unconcerned about {{the declaration of independence}} of Goshen and Stellaland, and felt it could not prevent such proclamations of independence, Cecil Rhodes recognised the economic implications of an independent Boer republic blocking the <b>transit</b> of <b>goods</b> between the Cape Colony and British Central Africa and began to agitate the Cape Colony Government to forcibly take control of the area.|$|R
5000|$|Talks are {{underway}} on {{revisions to the}} WTO rules on trade facilitation in the Doha Development Agenda negotiations. The outlines of a possible agreement includes, among others: (1). New obligations to promote electronic distribution and transmission of government trade regulations on imports and exports; (2). Standardization of certain basic fees for imports; (3). Stronger rules to help ensure freedom of <b>transit</b> for <b>goods</b> crossing national borders.|$|R
50|$|Milak is {{situated}} on the Afghanistan-Iran border. It {{is one of the}} major junctions that connects land-locked Afghanistan to international waters through Iran. After the collapse of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan, Milak lost importance in the <b>transit</b> of <b>goods</b> to Afghanistan. In recent years, Afghanistan, Iran and India have agreed to activate the Milak route by building a new international logistics hub in Chabahar, connected to Milak.|$|R
