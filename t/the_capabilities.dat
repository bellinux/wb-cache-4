5|$|As of April 1996, {{the option}} to order the seventh and eighth {{submarines}} was still under consideration, but was looked on unfavourably by the Department of Defence at the time, as the additional cost would require the diversion of funding from the Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force, resulting in an imbalance in <b>the</b> <b>capabilities</b> of the Australian Defence Force.

5|$|Feminist economists Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum {{created the}} human {{capabilities}} approach {{as an alternative}} way to assess economic success rooted in the ideas of welfare economics {{and focused on the}} individual's potential to do and be what he or she may choose to value. Unlike traditional economic measures of success, focused on GDP, utility, income, assets or other monetary measures, <b>the</b> <b>capabilities</b> approach focuses on what individuals are able to do. This approach emphasizes processes as well as outcomes, and draws attention to cultural, social and material dynamics of well-being. Martha Nussbaum, expanded on the model with a more complete list of central capabilities including life, health, bodily integrity, thought, and more. In recent years, <b>the</b> <b>capabilities</b> approach has influenced the creation of new models including the UN's Human Development Index (HDI).|$|E

40|$|This {{paper offers}} a {{critique}} of Martha Nussbaum’s description of <b>the</b> <b>capability</b> approach, and offers an alternative. I will argue that Nussbaum’s characterization of <b>the</b> <b>capability</b> approach is flawed, in two ways.

Second, she argues that there are five essential elements that all capability theories meet; yet upon closer analysis {{three of them are}} not really essential to <b>the</b> <b>capability</b> approach. I also offer an alternative description of <b>the</b> <b>capability</b> approach, which is called the cartwheel view of <b>the</b> <b>capability</b> approach. This view {{is at the same time}} radically multidisciplinary yet also contains a foundationally robust core among its various usages, and is therefore much better able to make the case that <b>the</b> <b>capability</b> approach can be developed in a very wide range of more specific normative theories. Finally, the carthwheel view is used to argue against Nussbaum’s claim that all capabiliarian political theory needs to be politically liberal...|$|R

5|$|The {{project that}} {{eventually}} led to the AV-8B's creation started in the early 1970s as a cooperative effort between the United States and United Kingdom (UK), aimed at addressing the operational inadequacies of the first-generation Harrier.

Due to budgetary constraints, the UK abandoned the project in 1975.|$|E
5|$|Another {{problem with}} the NIF lasers is that the flashtubes create a {{significant}} amount of heat, which warms the laser glass enough to cause it to deform. This requires a lengthy cooling-off period between shots, on the order of 12 hours. In practice, NIF manages a shot rate of less than one shot per day.

5|$|Bristol Aero Engines and Hooker {{had already}} {{been working on a}} project to produce a {{suitable}} VTOL engine; this engine combined major elements of their Olympus and Orpheus jet engines to produce a directable fan jet. The projected fan jet harnessed rotatable cold jets which were positioned {{on either side of the}} compressor along with a 'hot' jet which was directed via a conventional central tailpipe. With a suitable engine already being developed, Camm and his team at HSA proceeded to develop the company's first VTOL aircraft, designated as the Hawker Siddeley P.1127. The P.1127 was envisioned as a subsonic VTOL-capable strike aircraft, while also serving to demonstrate and prove <b>the</b> <b>capabilities</b> of the aircraft's basic configuration and to validate the performance of the Rolls-Royce Pegasus engine that powered it.|$|E
5|$|Feminist {{economics}} {{is the critical}} study of economics including its methodology, epistemology, history and empirical research, attempting to overcome androcentric (male and patriarchal) biases.

Feminist economics ultimately seeks to produce a more gender inclusive economics.|$|E
5|$|In June 1947, the {{military}} requirements were updated and the Model 464-17 met {{all of them}} except for the range. It was becoming obvious to the Air Force that, even with the updated performance, the XB-52 would be obsolete {{by the time it}} entered production and would offer little improvement over the Convair B-36; as a result, the entire project was postponed for six months. During this time, Boeing continued to perfect the design, which resulted in the Model 464-29 with a top speed of 455miles per hour (395kn, 730km/h) and a 5,000-mile range. In September 1947, the Heavy Bombardment Committee was convened to ascertain performance requirements for a nuclear bomber. Formalized on 8 December 1947, these requirements called for a top speed of 500miles per hour (440kn, 800km/h) and an 8,000mile (7,000nmi, 13,000km) range, far beyond <b>the</b> <b>capabilities</b> of 464-29.|$|E

Aircraft on search missions are generally crewed by at least three qualified aircrew members: a Mission Pilot, responsible for the safe flying of the aircraft; a Mission Observer, responsible for navigation, communications and coordination of the mission as well as ground observation; and a Mission Scanner {{who is responsible for}} looking for crash sites and damage clues. Additionally, the mission scanner may double as a satellite digital imaging system (SDIS) operator. Larger aircraft may have additional scanners aboard, providing greater visual coverage.

5|$|In {{line with}} this goal, the ADF was {{restructured}} {{to increase its}} ability to strike at enemy forces from Australian bases and to counter raids on continental Australia. This was achieved by increasing <b>the</b> <b>capabilities</b> of the RAN and RAAF, and relocating regular Army units to Northern Australia. During this time the ADF had no military units on operational deployment outside Australia. However, in 1987 the ADF made its first operational deployment as part of Operation Morris Dance, in which several warships and a rifle company deployed to the waters off Fiji {{in response to the}} 1987 Fijian coups d'état. While broadly successful, this deployment highlighted the need for the ADF to improve its capability to rapidly respond to unforeseen events.|$|E
