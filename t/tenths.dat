5|$|Roaring Brook then {{enters the}} Elmhurst Reservoir, where it briefly enters Roaring Brook Township before {{entering}} Elmhurst Township and receiving the tributary White Oak Run from the right. The stream continues flowing north-northwest, crossing Pennsylvania Route 435 and reentering Roaring Brook Township several <b>tenths</b> {{of a mile}} further downstream. It then crosses Interstate 84 and receives the tributary Rock Bottom Creek from the right as its valley becomes much deeper and narrower. It continues flowing north-northwest {{for more than a}} mile alongside Pennsylvania Route 435 before turning south-southwest and briefly entering Dunmore before reentering Roaring Brook Township. After several <b>tenths</b> of a mile, the stream turns northwest for a few miles, crossing Interstate 84 and reentering Dunmore. It passes through the Scranton Water Company Reservoir and receives the tributary Little Roaring Brook from the right before turning south and then west. It then turns northwest and crosses Interstate 81 before turning southwest and passing through the Nay Aug Gorge. The stream turns northwest for several <b>tenths</b> of a mile before turning west-southwest and crossing US Route 11. After a few <b>tenths</b> of a mile, it reaches its confluence with the Lackawanna River.|$|E
50|$|The two play a cat-and-mouse game, Lusiphur at {{one point}} turning into panther-like {{creature}} to fend off <b>Tenth</b> who had become a hawk. <b>Tenth</b> turns to a fly, so Lusiphur turns to a rattle snake, but he cannot {{figure out how to}} move a rattlesnake. This was when <b>Tenth</b> turns to a Unicorn, causing Lusiphur to panic and he chose a Nightmare (A black batwinged unicorn that bleeds acid and breathes fire.) <b>Tenth</b> becomes a Drake, where as Lusiphur turns to a black Dragon, knocking <b>Tenth</b> into a mountain. After recovering <b>Tenth</b> becomes a gold dragon, the two fight. Lusiphur gets his teeth on <b>Tenth's</b> throat. Up to this point in his existence <b>Tenth</b> has thoroughly beaten any competitor. Lusiphur has made the wizard fear for his life {{for the first time in}} many years. The dragon battle drags on, until Lusiphur disappears. <b>Tenth</b> assumes he is dead and scans the ground for his body. As <b>Tenth</b> searches for Lusiphur's body, he tries to go through the gate as a dragon, but he finds he can't fit. So <b>Tenth</b> becomes a Hell hound and goes through the gate, the moment he crosses it, Lusiphur appears out of nowhere and nearly carves <b>Tenth's</b> heart out. Lusiphur had become a flea and let <b>Tenth</b> carry him through the gate.|$|R

5|$|The {{individual}} apparent magnitudes {{of the two}} component stars {{cannot be}} directly measured, but their relative brightness has been measured at various wavelengths.

A 2016 measurement gives the magnitude difference between the two stars at a wavelength of 700 nm as 0.00 ± 0.1.|$|E
5|$|The {{oldest and}} most precise method of X-ray {{crystallography}} is single-crystal X-ray diffraction, in which a beam of X-rays strikes a single crystal, producing scattered beams. When they land {{on a piece of}} film or other detector, these beams make a diffraction pattern of spots; the strengths and angles of these beams are recorded as the crystal is gradually rotated. Each spot is called a reflection, since it corresponds to the reflection of the X-rays from one set of evenly spaced planes within the crystal. For single crystals of sufficient purity and regularity, X-ray diffraction data can determine the mean chemical bond lengths and angles to within a few thousandths of an angstrom and to within a few <b>tenths</b> of a degree, respectively. The atoms in a crystal are not static, but oscillate about their mean positions, usually by less than a few <b>tenths</b> of an angstrom. X-ray crystallography allows measuring the size of these oscillations.|$|E

5|$|The creek turns {{south and}} enters the John Heinz National Wildlife Refuge 4.5 miles {{upstream}} from its mouth. At this point it passes through the largest freshwater marsh in Pennsylvania before becoming entirely tidal. It turns west-southwest for a few miles, passing by Philadelphia, Folcroft, Norwood, Prospect Park, Tinicum Township, and Ridley Township and receives the tributary Muckinipattis Creek from the right. Darby Creek winds through a large lagoon 30ft deep in places that was dredged in the 1960s. The creek then receives Stony Creek, its last named tributary, from the right and turns south for a few <b>tenths</b> of a mile before reaching its confluence with the Delaware River.|$|E

On the southeastern end of the lake, the creek turns east-northeast for more than a mile, entering a deep valley. It then turns south-southeast for a few miles, entering West Wyoming flowing through a water gap. The creek then turns southeast for some distance before turning southwest and entering Wyoming. It then turns west-southwest for a few miles before turning south and then west. The creek then turns south again, crossing US Route 11.

5|$|In 1901, Duncan MacDougall, a {{physician}} from Haverhill, Massachusetts, {{who wished to}} scientifically determine if a soul had weight, identified six patients in nursing homes whose death was imminent. Four were suffering from tuberculosis, one from diabetes, and one from unspecified causes. MacDougall specifically chose people who were suffering from conditions that caused physical exhaustion, as he needed the patients to remain still when they died to measure them accurately. When the patients {{looked like they were}} close to death, their entire bed was placed on an industrial sized scale that was sensitive within two <b>tenths</b> of an ounce (5.6 grams). On the belief that humans have souls and that animals do not, MacDougall later measured the changes in weight from fifteen dogs after death. MacDougall said he wished to use dogs that were sick or dying for his experiment, though was unable to find any. It is therefore presumed he poisoned healthy dogs.|$|E

40|$|In {{its recent}} {{decision}} in Bond v. United States, the Supreme Court explained {{that because the}} <b>Tenth</b> Amendment 2 ̆ 2 secures {{the freedom of the}} individual, 2 ̆ 2 private parties who otherwise satisfy Article III 2 ̆ 7 s standing requirements and other prudential requirements may challenge federal laws as violating the <b>Tenth</b> Amendment. In so doing, the Court reversed the majority of circuit courts that have addressed the issue and removed a significant categorical bar to individual <b>Tenth</b> Amendment challenges. This Article explains Bond 2 ̆ 7 s holding and explores its implications for future <b>Tenth</b> Amendment challenges by private parties. Although Bond contains some expansive language regarding the role of <b>Tenth</b> Amendment in protecting individual liberties, it should not be read too broadly. Bond clarified that the <b>Tenth</b> Amendment protects individual liberties and thus prudential, third-party standing principles do not prevent individuals from bringing a <b>Tenth</b> Amendment challenge against federal statutes that impair their liberties. But Bond also made clear that individual <b>Tenth</b> Amendment challenges must satisfy traditional Article III standing requirements and that not every violation of the <b>Tenth</b> Amendment automatically entails an impairment of individual liberty that supports standing. As a result, Article III standing requirements will hinder many individual <b>Tenth</b> Amendment challenges, and many individual challenges will not succeed without the support of states. Thus, despite the breadth of the Court 2 ̆ 7 s language in Bond, states may significantly influence whether private parties can successfully assert the states 2 ̆ 7 sovereign interests in a <b>Tenth</b> Amendment challenge. Litigants must understand these limitations as they attempt to use Bond to challenge federal statutes that, until this point, have been protected from individual suits by the bar that most courts of appeals have imposed on private-party <b>Tenth</b> Amendment standing. Put succinctly, while Bond rightly removed the prudential bar to individual <b>Tenth</b> Amendment challenges, it did not confer Article III standing to each and every litigant alleging a <b>Tenth</b> Amendment injury. Litigants will still need to separately satisfy the Article III requirements, blunting the impact of Bond and likely insulating many federal statutes from individual <b>Tenth</b> Amendment challenges...|$|R
