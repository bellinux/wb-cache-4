5|$|In captivity, females become {{sexually mature}} at {{two months of}} age. The ovarian {{follicle}} forms about 16 days prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> of the offspring. After mating, female hamsters typically have larger uteri, ovaries, and adrenal glands compared to females which live alone, with other females or those that have not mated. The females and males may fight each other when getting to know their partner. Also, these females have a shorter gestation period, around four to five days.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>birth</b> rate is {{an issue}} of concern and policy for {{national}} governments. Some (including those of Italy and Malaysia) seek <b>to</b> increase <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> rate with financial incentives or provision of support services to new mothers. Conversely, other countries have policies <b>to</b> reduce <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> rate (for example, China's one-child policy which was in effect from 1978 to 2015). Policies <b>to</b> increase <b>the</b> crude <b>birth</b> rate are known as pro-natalist policies, and policies <b>to</b> reduce <b>the</b> crude <b>birth</b> rate are known as anti-natalist policies. Measures such as improved information on birth control and its availability have achieved similar results in countries such as Iran.|$|R

5|$|A {{prototype}} for the Kinetoscope {{was shown to}} a convention of the National Federation of Women's Clubs on May 20, 1891. The first public demonstration of the Kinetoscope {{was held at the}} Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences on May 9, 1893. Instrumental <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> of American movie culture, the Kinetoscope also had a major impact in Europe; its influence abroad was magnified by Edison's decision not to seek international patents on the device, facilitating numerous imitations of and improvements on the technology. In 1895, Edison introduced the Kinetophone, which joined the Kinetoscope with a cylinder phonograph. Film projection, which Edison initially disdained as financially nonviable, soon superseded the Kinetoscope's individual exhibition model. Many of the projection systems developed by Edison's firm in later years would use the Kinetoscope name.|$|E
5|$|By 1938, over 400 {{contraceptive}} manufacturers were in business, over 600 {{brands of}} female contraceptives were available, and industry revenues exceeded $250million per year. Condoms {{were sold in}} vending machines in some public restrooms, and men spent twice as much on condoms as on shaving.Tone, p. 136. Although condoms had become commonplace in the 1930s, feminists in the movement felt that birth control should be the woman's prerogative, and they continued to push for development of a contraceptive that was under the woman's control, a campaign which ultimately led <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> control pill decades later. To increase the availability of high-quality contraceptives, birth control advocates established the Holland–Rantos company to manufacture contraceptives– primarily diaphragms, which were Sanger's recommended method. By the 1930s, the diaphragm with spermicidal jelly had become the most commonly prescribed form of contraception; in 1938, female contraceptives accounted for 85 percent of annual contraceptive sales.|$|E
5|$|Emergency {{medicine}} {{has been a}} recognized medical specialty in the United States and other developed countries for nearly forty years, although these countries' EMSs did not become fully mature until the early 1990s. At that point, some of its practitioners turned their attention from developing the specialty at home to developing it abroad, leading <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> of international emergency medicine. They began to support the growth of emergency medicine worldwide, doing so through conferences, national and regional emergency medicine organizations, relief and development organizations, international emergency medicine fellowships, physician exchanges, information transfer, and curriculum development.|$|E

After being without a record label, they considered signing to Japanese music group EastWest to strengthen their fan base. However, independent record label Nettwerk offered to fund the album; Ivy signed with both labels and began preparing it for a national release.|$|E

5|$|Murasaki {{began her}} diary after she entered service at Shōshi's court. Much {{of what we}} know about her and her {{experiences}} at court comes from the diary, which covers the period from about 1008 to 1010. The long descriptive passages, some of which may have originated as letters, cover her relationships with the other ladies-in-waiting, Michinaga's temperament, the birth of Shōshi's sons—at Michinaga's mansion rather than at the Imperial Palace—and the process of writing Genji, including descriptions of passing newly written chapters to calligraphers for transcriptions. Typical of contemporary court diaries written to honor patrons, Murasaki devotes half <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>birth</b> of Shōshi's son Emperor Go-Ichijō, an event of enormous importance to Michinaga: he had planned for it with his daughter's marriage which made him grandfather and de facto regent to an emperor.|$|E
