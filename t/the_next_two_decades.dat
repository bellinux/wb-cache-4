5|$|By {{shutting}} down Black Snow and prosecuting Takechi, Eirin {{had intended to}} suppress the new pink film genre, but the trial had the exact opposite outcome. The publicity surrounding the trial brought the pink film genre {{to the attention of}} the general public, and helped inspire the wave of pink films which dominated Japan's domestic cinema for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades.</b>|$|E
5|$|For most of <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades,</b> {{the western}} reaches of Mysore {{remained}} vulnerable to attacks by the Coorg army.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to describe and characterize the behaviour of fish prices in Nigeria. Drawing upon aspects of the data from a nationwide fish survey in 1980 / 81 and on various secondary data, the study analyses the pattern of fish price movement and makes projections of fish prices in Nigeria till 2002 A.

It is concluded that unless efforts are directed at stemming inflation in fish prices, prices paid by fish consumers in Nigeria will be more than doubled within <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>decade...</b>|$|R
25|$|In 1974, {{after years}} of {{centralised}} monopoly on radio and television, the governmental agency ORTF was split into several national institutions, but the three already-existing TV channels and four national radio stations remained under state-control. It was only in 1981 that the government allowed free broadcasting in the territory, ending state monopoly on radio. French television was partly liberalised in <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>decade</b> with <b>the</b> creation of several commercial channels, mainly thanks to cable and satellite television. In 2005 the national service Télévision Numérique Terrestre introduced digital television all over the territory, allowing the creation of other channels.|$|R

5|$|The scuttling {{was carried}} out on 21 June 1919. Intervening British guard ships were able to beach {{a number of the}} ships, but 52 of the 74 interned vessels sank.

5|$|After the {{collapse}} of Imperial Germany in November 1918, the Finns sought new political partners. The United Kingdom had been a significant trading partner since the 18th century, and the Finns worked to improve the relations for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades.</b> In the 1930s Finland purchased Thornycroft torpedo boats from the United Kingdom, and also refrained from buying bomber aircraft from Germany because of British protests, purchasing instead modern Bristol Blenheims, which later served successfully during the Winter War.|$|E

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, {{there have been}} major {{advances}} {{in our understanding of}} the molecular interplay between plants and various classes of microbial pathogens (bacteria, fungi, oomycetes, viruses, and nematodes) and microbial symbionts (rhizobia or mycorrhizal fungi). These fundamental insights, reviewed in a special section in this issue (p. 741), provide a conceptual framework for rational human intervention through the breeding or engineering of crops for durable and broad-spectrum disease resistance. However, such engineered plants will eventually be deployed into soils of varying geochemistry that harbor a staggering diversity of microbes. Many of these microbes can associate intimately with crops or other plants in natural habitats. A deeper understanding of plant-associated microbial communities is likely to offer exciting opportunities for controlling plant growth and pathogen burden in sustainable agricultural settings over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>decade...</b>|$|R

Many new programs and majors were inaugurated, as were important social outreach efforts. New ties were established with the private and industrial sectors, and a growing partnership developed with federal and state governments in creating programs for the economically and educationally disadvantaged.|$|E
5|$|His {{international}} breakthrough {{came at the}} 2001 Wimbledon Championships where a 19 {{year old}} Federer faced the four-time defending champion and all-time Grand Slam leader Pete Sampras. The teenage Swiss stunned the seven time Wimbledon champion and #1 seed in a dramatic five set epic to reach the quarterfinals. In the quarters he faced Englishman Tim Henman, eventually losing in an overtime fourth set tiebreaker. Federer's breakthrough at Wimbledon signaled the record breaking dominance he would display at the All England Club over <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1481 and 1482, {{earthquakes}} {{destroyed the}} Jewish quarter, {{so that only}} 22 families remained in the city.

In <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades,</b> the Hospitallers brought to the island between 2,000 and 3,000 captured Jews who were kept as slaves to work on fortifications.|$|E
40|$|Climate {{change will}} {{influence}} road traffic, maintenance and {{management in the}} near future, including winter road service. Global temperatures have risen by 0, 74 °C during the last century, {{and are expected to}} rise by 1, 1 to 6, 4 °C {{by the end of this}} century. Most likely estimates for <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>decade</b> predict a temperature rise of approximately half decree centigrade. Precipitation will increase and extreme wind speeds are believed to occur more often. Road owners and researchers in Europe are aware of this and research on the matter has been initiated in the different countries and on the European level. Climate change impact on road management in general will vary geographically, and some issues may lead to beneficial outcome for the road management whereas other issues may demand relocation of resources and new thinking, also for the winter services. 1...|$|R

5|$|Shortly after independence, filmmakers such as Jean-Paul Ngassa and Thérèse Sita-Bella {{explored}} similar themes. In the 1960s, Mongo Beti, Ferdinand Léopold Oyono {{and other}} writers explored post-colonialism, problems of African development, and {{the recovery of}} African identity. Meanwhile, in the mid-1970s, filmmakers such as Jean-Pierre Dikongué Pipa and Daniel Kamwa dealt with the conflicts between traditional and post-colonial society. Literature and films during <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> concentrated more on wholly Cameroonian themes.|$|E

5|$|The workhouse {{movement}} {{began at}} the end of the 17th century with the establishment of the Bristol Corporation of the Poor, founded by Act of Parliament in 1696. The corporation established a workhouse which combined housing and care of the poor with a house of correction for petty offenders. Following the example of Bristol, some twelve further towns and cities established similar corporations in <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades.</b> As these corporations required a private Act, they were not suitable for smaller towns and individual parishes.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Harvard and {{serving in the}} Army during World War I, Tunis began his writing career freelancing for American sports {{magazines}} while playing tennis in the Rivera. For <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>two</b> <b>decades</b> he wrote short stories and articles about sports and education for magazines including Reader's Digest, The Saturday Evening Post and Esquire. Tunis' work often protested the increasing professionalization of sports in America. He believed that amateur participation in sports taught values important for good citizenship like perseverance, fair play and equality, and that the emphasis on professional sports was turning America into a country of spectators. His sports books also tackled current social issues such as antisemitism and racial equality.|$|E

The DB9 was available as both a coupe and a convertible. Fisker also designed the Aston Martin V8 Vantage (in production from 2005 to the present), a two-door coupe considered to be the leanest and most agile of all Aston Martin cars. It was named the coolest car of the year and the best sounding car of the year by Top Gear in 2005. The Vantage is the best selling Aston Martin of all time.
