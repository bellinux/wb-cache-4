25|$|Cushing's syndrome, {{also known}} as hyperadrenocorticism, is {{characterized}} {{by an increase in}} glucocorticoids secreted by the adrenal glands. About 85 percent of cases are caused by a tumor in the pituitary gland, while 15 percent are caused by an adrenal tumor. The pituitary gland produces a hormone that signals the adrenal gland to produce cortisol; a tumor can cause it to produce the adrenal-stimulating hormone even when it is not needed. Signs include increased appetite, increased drinking and urination, a pot-bellied appearance, muscle weakness, and lethargy. Cushing's can be caused by overuse of steroid medications; in some cases, stopping the medication is enough to solve the problem. Diagnosis can be difficult as there are no tests with both high sensitivity and specificity.Treatments inclulde mitotane, <b>trilostane,</b> ketoconazole, or selegiline.

There is no previous documentation of any anti-inflammatory effects of <b>trilostane.</b> ObjectiveThe {{aim of this study}} was to elucidate the novel pharmacologic activity of <b>trilostane</b> in a series of inflammation and nociception signal-finding models. MethodsAnti-inflammatory effects of <b>trilostane</b> were evaluated in lipopolysaccharide-induced systemic and lung inflammation models and in a 2, 4 -dinitrofluorobenzene–induced delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) model in the mouse ear. The analgesic activities of <b>trilostane</b> were evaluated in a hot plate nociception model as a function of paw-withdrawal latency and in the formalin-induced nociception model with a behavioral end point.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Glucocorticoids {{influence}} the synthesis and metabolism of catecholamines (epinephrine and norepinephrine) and metanephrines (metanephrine and normetanephrine). The {{aim of this}} study was to measure urinary catecholamines and metanephrines in dogs with hypercortisolism before and during <b>trilostane</b> therapy. Urine samples were collected during initial work up and during therapy with <b>trilostane</b> in 14 dogs with hypercortisolism and in 25 healthy dogs. Epinephrine, norepinephrine, metanephrine and normetanephrine were measured using high-pressure liquid chromatography and expressed as ratios to urinary creatinine concentration. RESULTS: Untreated dogs with hypercortisolism had significantly higher epinephrine, norepinephrine, and normetanephrine:creatinine ratios compared to healthy dogs. During <b>trilostane</b> therapy, urinary catecholamines and their metabolites did not decrease significantly. However, dogs with low post-ACTH cortisol concentrations during <b>trilostane</b> therapy had less increased epinephrine, norepinephrine and normetanephrine:creatinine ratios compared to healthy dogs. There was no correlation of urinary catecholamines and their metabolites with baseline or post-ACTH cortisol or endogenous ACTH concentrations during <b>trilostane</b> therapy. CONCLUSION: Influences between steroid hormones and catecholamines seem to occur, as dogs with hypercortisolism have significantly higher urinary epinephrine, norepinephrine, and normetanephrine:creatinine ratios.

Groups 1. 1 to 1. 4 received ACTH in different doses (60, 40, 20, and 10 μg/d) infused subcutaneously with osmotic minipumps for 16 wk. Group 1. 5 received saline, and group 1. 6 received no therapy. For experiment 2, 24 rats were divided into 3 groups. Group 2. 1 and 2. 2 received 5 and 50 mg/kg trilostane/d orally mixed into chocolate pudding for 16 wk. Eight control rats received pudding alone. At the end of the experiments, adrenal glands were assessed for necrosis by histology and immunohistochemistry; levels of endogenous ACTH and nucleosomes were assessed in the blood.

Background: The {{adrenocorticotropic hormone}} (ACTH) {{stimulation}} test {{is used to}} evaluate <b>trilostane</b> treatment in dogs with hypercortisolism. Hypothesis: The urinary corticoid : creatinine ratio (UCCR) is a good alternative to the ACTH stimulation test to determine optimal <b>trilostane</b> dose. Animals: Eighteen dogs with pituitary-dependent hypercortisolism. Methods: In this prospective study, the dose of <b>trilostane</b> was judged to be optimal {{on the basis of}} resolution of clinical signs of hypercortisolism and results of an ACTH stimulation test. The owners collected urine for determination of UCCR at 2 -week intervals for at least 8 weeks after achieving the optimal <b>trilostane</b> dose. Results: The UCCRs were significantly higher before treatment (11. 5 - 202. 0 x 10 (- 6); median, 42. 0 x 10 (- 6)) than at rechecks 2 months after optimal dosing, but they did not decrease below the upper limit of the reference range in the majority of dogs. The UCCRs of 11 dogs that initially were dosed insufficiently (range, 7. 5 - 79. 0 x 10 (- 6); median, 31. 0 x 10 (- 6)) did not differ significantly from UCCRs when the dosage was optimal (8. 2 - 72. 0 x 10 (- 6); median, 33. 0 x 10 (- 6)).

In this study we investigated the effects of the 3 -HSD inhibitor <b>trilostane</b> on corpus luteum function in non-pregnant bitches. <b>Trilostane</b> was administered orally for seven consecutive days in either the pituitary-independent part of the luteal phase (PIP, start of treatment on D 11 after ovulation, n 6) or the pituitary-dependent part (PDP, start of treatment on D 31 after ovulation, n 6), in an oral dose of about 4. 5 mg/kg bw, twice daily. Results were compared with those obtained in control bitches (n 6). ACTH stimulation tests were performed to assess adrenocortical reserve capacity. <b>Trilostane</b> caused no apparent side effects and ACTH stimulation tests revealed good suppression of cortisol secretion. <b>Trilostane</b> also caused a significant decrease in plasma progesterone concentration. When it was stopped during PIP, progesterone secretion was completely restored and {{there was no difference in}} the length of the luteal phase between those dogs and control dogs (99 days, range 70 – 138 d and 99 d, range 60 – 112 d, respectively). When <b>trilostane</b> was stopped during PDP there was no post-treatment recovery of progesterone secretion and although the luteal phase tended to be shorter (66 d, range 41 – 101 d) the difference was not significant (P 0. 09). Plasma prolactin concentration did not increase after the trilostane-induced decrease in plasma progesterone. The interoestrous interval in dogs treated during PIP (234 d, range 175 – 269 d) or PDP (198 d, range 120 – 287 d) was not significantly shorter than the control interval (247 d, range 176 – 313 d). In conclusion, <b>trilostane</b> treatment was effective in decreasing plasma progesterone concentration in bitches during the luteal phase, but the dose regimen used in this study produced less clear-cut inhibition of ovarian steroidogenesis than have other strategies to decrease plasma progesterone concentration. Further studies are warranted to determine whether <b>trilostane</b> can be used to terminate unwanted pregnancy in the bitch without inducing adrenocortical insufficiency. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|Over {{the last}} 10 years, <b>trilostane,</b> a {{competitive}} inhibitor of steroid synthesis, is being widely {{used for the}} treatment of canine hyperadrenocorticism. <b>Trilostane</b> causes a significant but reversible decrease in cortisol production and a concomitant improvement in clinical signs in most dogs with this common condition. Side effects, though infrequent, can be serious: dogs treated with this drug require regular monitoring. This review summarizes current knowledge of the use of this drug with particular emphasis on its efficacy, safety, adverse reactions, and effects on endocrine parameters.

40|$|Inhibition of {{progesterone}} (P 4) synthesis by cumulus cells during bovine {{in vitro}} oocyte maturation (IVM) causes {{a decrease in}} subsequent embryo development, indicating that P 4 intracellular signaling within the cumulus oocyte complex (COC) is important for oocyte developmental competence. The aim {{of the present study}} was to further elucidate, on a protein level, the downstream signaling pathway involved in P 4 regulation of oocyte developmental competence. COCs were subjected to IVM for 24 h in the presence or absence of <b>trilostane,</b> aglepristone, or promegestone (R 5020). These altered IVM conditions resulted in dynamic changes in protein expression of the progesterone receptors and the cell death-regulated proteins AVEN, BCL-xL, and active caspase 3. In addition, AVEN protein localization, caspase 3 activation, and mitochondrial distribution were studied by immunofluores-cence. Inhibition of progesterone synthesis (<b>trilostane</b> treatment) resulted in changes in AVEN localization within the COC, corresponding to caspase 3 activation and altered mitochondrial distribution. AVEN was also found to bind BCL-xL in COCs, but this interaction was lost following treatment with <b>trilostane.</b> apoptosis, cow, developmental competence, egg quality, in vitro maturation, progesterone receptor...|$|E

40|$|Background: Acute phase {{proteins}} (APPS) include haptoglobin (Hp), C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA). Increased Hp concentrations may {{be induced}} by endogenous or exogenous glucocorticoids in dogs. Objectives: To assess whether control of hyperadrenocorticism (HAC) affects {{the concentrations of}} Hp, CRP, SAA, alkaline phosphatase (ALKP) and cholesterol, to determine whether these analytes {{can be used to}} assess control of HAC following <b>trilostane</b> treatment, and whether a combination of these tests offers a valid method of assessing disease control. Methods: Hp, CRP, SAA, ALKP and cholesterol were assessed in 11 dogs with spontaneous HAC before and after treatment with <b>trilostane.</b> Adequate control of HAC was defined as post-ACTH cortisol less than 150 nmol/l. Results: Significant reductions in Hp, ALKP, cholesterol and SAA (P 0 · 7) of disease control when compared to adrenocorticotropin or corticotropin (ACTH) stimulation test. SAA and CRP were unhelpful (Se & Sp< 0 · 7). The analysis of the combination of the analytes did not improve the correlation with ACTH stimulation test. Clinical Relevance: Relying on these analytes does not provide additional information over ACTH stimulation test results when assessing control of HAC treated with <b>trilostane.</b> Research Papers and Publications.

40|$|The {{effects of}} stress (diethyl ether {{anaesthesia}} for 4 - 8 min, or intravenous injection of 0. 05 ml of a dimethyl sulphoxide/water mixture) {{and of a}} scald injury given under ether anaesthesia on hepatic PEPCK (phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, EC 4. 1. 1. 32) were studied in the post-absorptive rat. Injury raised PEPCK activity by about 70 % in 2 h and by over 100 % in 4 h, over three {{times as fast as}} in animals that had only been handled (controls). The two stresses, both of types commonly imposed in animal experiments, had almost as much effect as injury for the first 2 h, although much less thereafter. The roles of sympathetic stimulation and corticosterone in mediating these rises were studied by using alpha beta-blockers and <b>trilostane</b> respectively as inhibitors. (<b>Trilostane</b> only decreased corticosterone concentrations to a little above control values.) The ether-induced increase was somewhat decreased by alpha beta-blockade, but was only eliminated by combined alpha beta-blockade and <b>trilostane.</b> After injury, however, PEPCK synthesis was unaffected by either alpha beta-blockade or <b>trilostane,</b> although it was decreased by their combined action; and it seems that either corticosterone or sympathetic stimulation was sufficient to stimulate PEPCK synthesis maximally. Stimulation by corticosterone was much greater than reported previously by others, for reasons that are discussed. Sympathetic stimulation may have been mediated by glucagon and cyclic AMP, since injury raised portal glucagon concentrations, and stress and injury raised those of hepatic cyclic AMP. PEPCK synthesis was, however, stimulated despite increases in portal insulin concentration, and was not related to the [insulin]/[glucagon] ratio. Thus stress and injury over-rode normal control mechanisms...|$|E
