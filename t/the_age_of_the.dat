5|$|Astronomers {{calculate}} <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Universe {{by assuming}} that the Lambda-CDM model accurately describes {{the evolution of the}} Universe from a very uniform, hot, dense primordial state to its present state and measuring the cosmological parameters which constitute the model. This model is well understood theoretically and supported by recent high-precision astronomical observations such as WMAP and Planck. Commonly, the set of observations fitted includes the cosmic microwave background anisotropy, the brightness/redshift relation for Type Ia supernovae, and large-scale galaxy clustering including the baryon acoustic oscillation feature. Other observations, such as the Hubble constant, the abundance of galaxy clusters, weak gravitational lensing and globular cluster ages, are generally consistent with these, providing a check of the model, but are less accurately measured at present. With the prior that the Lambda-CDM model is correct, the measurements of the parameters using a variety of techniques by numerous experiments yield a best value of <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Universe as of 2015 of 13.799 ± 0.021 billion years.|$|E

5|$|There {{were serious}} {{scientific}} {{objections to the}} process of natural selection as the key mechanism of evolution, including Karl von Nägeli's insistence that a trivial characteristic with no adaptive advantage could not be developed by selection. Darwin conceded that these could be linked to adaptive characteristics. His estimate that <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth allowed gradual evolution was disputed by William Thomson (later awarded the title Lord Kelvin), who calculated that it had cooled in less than 100 million years. Darwin accepted blending inheritance, but Fleeming Jenkin calculated that as it mixed traits, natural selection could not accumulate useful traits. Darwin tried to meet these objections in the 5th edition. Mivart supported directed evolution, and compiled scientific and religious objections to natural selection. In response, Darwin made considerable changes to the sixth edition. The problems of <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth and heredity were only resolved in the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|A new tyrannosaurid {{specimen}} (OMNH 10131), including skull fragments, {{ribs and}} parts of the hindlimb, was reported from New Mexico in 1990 and assigned to the now-defunct genus Aublysodon. Many later authors have reassigned this specimen, along with a few others from New Mexico, to yet another unnamed species of Daspletosaurus. However, research published in 2010 showed that this species, from the Hunter Wash Member of the Kirtland Formation, is actually a more primitive tyrannosauroid, and was classified in the genus Bistahieversor.

5|$|All banksias have {{developed}} proteoid or cluster roots {{in response to}} the nutrient poor conditions of Australian soils (particularly lacking in phosphorus). The plant develop masses of fine lateral roots that form a mat-like structure underneath the soil surface, and enable it to extract nutrients as efficiently possible out of the soil. A study of three co-occurring species in banksia woodland in southwestern Australia—Banksia menziesii, B. attenuata and B. ilicifolia—found that all three develop fresh roots in September after winter rainfall, and that the bacteria populations associated with the root systems of B. menziesii differ from the other two, and that they also change depending on <b>the</b> <b>age</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> roots.|$|E
40|$|MCXO) {{utilizes}} {{the dual}} c-mode excitation (fundamental mode and 3 rd overtone (OT)) of an SC-cut resonator for self-temperature sensing and compensation. <b>The</b> long-term stability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> MCXO depends primarily on <b>the</b> <b>aging</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dual mode resonator.

In this paper, we report <b>the</b> <b>aging</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dual modes <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 20 MHz 3 rd OT SC-cut MCXO resonators.
