5|$|John Kadlec of Beta Engineering {{originally}} planned {{the use of}} 8-inch HCS, which he specified could withstand 120 pounds per square foot, a load which exceeded specifications on all 8-inch HCS.

However, Kadlec advised the owners that the plans called for 8-inch HCS which could withstand <b>the</b> <b>load</b> without reinforcement from topping. The contract was thus awarded to Coreslab, despite Coreslab's design tables indicating that the specified project loads were 38% higher than the maximum load.

5|$|Tension {{forces can}} be modeled using ideal strings that are massless, frictionless, unbreakable, and unstretchable. They can be {{combined}} with ideal pulleys, which allow ideal strings to switch physical direction. Ideal strings transmit tension forces instantaneously in action-reaction pairs so that if two objects are connected by an ideal string, any force directed along the string by the first object {{is accompanied by a}} force directed along the string in the opposite direction by the second object. By connecting the same string multiple times to the same object {{through the use of a}} set-up that uses movable pulleys, the tension force on a load can be multiplied. For every string that acts on a load, another factor of the tension force in the string acts on <b>the</b> <b>load.</b> However, even though such machines allow for an increase in force, there is a corresponding increase in the length of string that must be displaced in order to move <b>the</b> <b>load.</b> These tandem effects result ultimately in the conservation of mechanical energy since the work done on <b>the</b> <b>load</b> is the same no matter how complicated the machine.|$|E
