5|$|Hermann Göring, {{commander-in-chief}} of the Luftwaffe sanctioned the operation. The Germans {{waited for}} an opportunity to begin <b>the</b> <b>intruder</b> operation and one presented itself {{on the night of the}} 3/4 March 1945 when Bomber Command attacked targets in western Germany. The operation failed to achieve the results hoped for; the successes of the attacking force were not sufficiently commensurate with the losses sustained.|$|E
5|$|In a paper {{published}} in 2009, {{researchers found that}} mockingbirds were able to recall an individual human who, earlier in the study, had approached and threatened the mockingbirds' nest. Researchers had one participant stand near a mockingbird nest and touch it, while others avoided the nest. Later, the mockingbirds recognized <b>the</b> <b>intruder</b> and exhibited defensive behavior, while ignoring the other individuals.|$|E
5|$|Myrmecia {{is one of}} {{the best-known}} genera of ants. Myrmecia ants usually display {{defensive}} behaviour only around their nests, and are more timid while foraging. However, most species are extremely aggressive towards intruders; a few, such as M. tarsata, are timid, and the workers retreat into their nest instead of pursuing <b>the</b> <b>intruder.</b> If a nest is disturbed, a large force of workers rapidly swarms out of their nest to attack and kill <b>the</b> <b>intruder.</b> Some species, particularly those of the M. nigrocincta and M. pilosula species groups, are capable of jumping several inches when they are agitated after their nest has been disturbed; jumper ants propel their jumps by a sudden extension of their middle and hind legs. M. pyriformis is considered the most dangerous ant in the world by the Guinness World Records. M. inquilina is the only species of this genus that is considered vulnerable by the IUCN, although the conservation status needs updating.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Intruders</b> (also {{known as}} Skippy and <b>the</b> <b>Intruders)</b> is a 1969 Australian film {{directed}} by Lee Robinson. It is a spin-off {{of the popular}} Skippy the Bush Kangaroo TV series.|$|R
50|$|This season {{introduced}} a new twist that allows several teams to join in <b>the</b> game as <b>intruders.</b> <b>The</b> <b>intruders</b> will be starting the race {{at the start of}} a given leg. In their invasion leg, <b>the</b> <b>intruders</b> must place in the top two to continue racing - if they fail their invasion, they may be eliminated from the race. If they succeed, the last team to check-in may be eliminated, and <b>the</b> <b>intruders</b> will keep on racing in future legs.|$|R
5|$|The {{different}} ways in which this biparental sex role specialization can be influenced was studied by manipulating the presence and absence of the mate as well as the presence and absence of an intruder. The former variable was considered because the specialization of parental roles only occurs when both parents are present, while the latter variable was considered because it is thought that biparental care in these cichlids was an evolutionary consequence of the protection of offspring from intruders. When both mates are present with no intruder, both parents may stay with the offspring by resembling single parents because each parent is addressing only the offspring and not its mate, or one parent may be concentrated on activities associated with the offspring while the other parent concentrates on patrolling and defending the area. Under these isolated conditions, a more equal sharing of parental behaviors tends to occur. However, when both mates are present and an intruder is introduced, the male spends more time chasing intruders while the female remains with the offspring more. When <b>the</b> <b>intruder</b> is present but a parent is by itself, the widowed male tends to leave the offspring unattended and instead attacks <b>the</b> <b>intruder</b> or predator. Therefore, the conclusive finding is that the male rarely remains with the offspring when the female is absent, and the female rarely confronts <b>the</b> <b>intruder</b> when the male is absent.|$|E

5000|$|On Thursday February 12, 1976 {{about six}} intruders, who {{according}} to police looked like junior high students or younger, entered Murray Wright. According to the police they were searching for a student who had [...] "stolen one of their girlfriends." [...] Two teachers discovered <b>the</b> <b>intruders</b> {{and asked them to}} leave. A security guard escorted <b>the</b> <b>intruders</b> down a hallway as about six Murray-Wright students followed <b>the</b> <b>intruders</b> as they were leaving.

5|$|On 29 December 2000, British Airways Flight 2069 was {{en route}} from London to Nairobi when a mentally-ill {{passenger}} entered the cockpit and grabbed the controls. As the pilots struggled to remove <b>the</b> <b>intruder,</b> the Boeing 747-400 stalled twice and banked to 94 degrees. Several people on board were injured by the violent manoeuvres, which briefly caused the aircraft to descend at 30,000ft per minute.

5|$|Sherlock Holmes Baffled is a {{very short}} American silent film created in 1900 with {{cinematography}} by Arthur Marvin. It is the earliest known film to feature Arthur Conan Doyle's detective character Sherlock Holmes, albeit in a form unlike that of later screen incarnations. The inclusion of the character also makes it the first recorded detective film. In the film, a thief who can appear and disappear at will steals a sack of items from Sherlock Holmes. At each point, Holmes's attempts to thwart <b>the</b> <b>intruder</b> end in failure.|$|E

They often engage in assignments independently of the Wild Pack. Although the team never officially disbands, <b>the</b> <b>Intruders</b> are presumably dissolved by Silver Sable several months later.|$|R

5|$|The birds aggressively {{defend their}} nests and {{surrounding}} areas against other birds and animals. When a predator is persistent, mockingbirds from neighboring territories may be summoned by distinct calls {{to join the}} defense. Other birds may gather to watch as the mockingbirds harass <b>the</b> <b>intruder.</b> In addition to harassing domestic cats and dogs that they consider a threat, mockingbirds will at times target humans. The birds are unafraid and will attack much larger birds, even hawks. One incident in Tulsa, Oklahoma involving a postal carrier resulted {{in the distribution of}} a warning letter to residents.|$|E
5|$|While {{the social}} {{organisation}} of the red-headed myzomela is relatively unknown, {{it is reported}} as being usually solitary or found in pairs, though it {{has been described as}} forming loose associations with brown honeyeaters, and other mangrove-feeding birds such as the northern fantail and yellow white-eye. It is an inquisitive bird and readily responds to pishing, coming close to the caller to investigate the source of the sound and to warn off <b>the</b> <b>intruder.</b> It calls throughout the day when feeding, and males sing from exposed branches in the upper canopy of the food trees.|$|E
5|$|A few {{accounts}} {{exist that}} describe females defending their newborn litters. Wharten (1960, 1966) reported several cases where females found near their young stood their ground and considered these to be examples of guarding behavior. Another case {{was described by}} Walters and Card (1996) in which a female was found {{at the entrance of}} a chamber with seven neonates crawling on or around her. When one of the young was moved a short distance from the chamber, she seemed to be agitated and faced <b>the</b> <b>intruder.</b> Eventually, all of her offspring retreated into the chamber, but the female remained at the entrance, ready to strike.|$|E

5|$|During {{the threat}} display, any sudden {{movement}} by <b>the</b> <b>intruder</b> may provoke the mamba {{into a series}} of rapid strikes leading to severe envenomation. Also, the size of the black mamba, plus its ability to raise its head well off the ground, enable it to launch as much as 40% of its body length upwards, so mamba bites in humans quite often are on the upper body. This behaviour also permits the snake to land a strike at unexpectedly long range. The black mamba's reputed readiness to attack is often much exaggerated and usually is provoked by perceived threats, such as blocking its intended retreat, accidentally or otherwise.|$|E
5|$|The African crake is {{territorial}} on {{both the}} breeding and non-breeding grounds; the male threat display involves the bird standing upright and spreading the feathers of the flanks and belly like a fan to show the barred underparts. He may march towards <b>the</b> <b>intruder,</b> or walk {{side by side with}} another displaying male. The female may accompany the male, but with feathers less widely fanned. Fighting at territorial boundaries involves the male birds jumping at each other and pecking. Paired females will attack other females in the territory, especially if the male has shown an interest in them.|$|E
5|$|The company {{enters the}} black forest of Mirkwood without Gandalf. In Mirkwood, Bilbo first saves the dwarves from giant spiders {{and then from}} the dungeons of the Wood-elves. Nearing the Lonely Mountain, the {{travellers}} are welcomed by the human inhabitants of Lake-town, who hope the dwarves will fulfil prophecies of Smaug's demise. The expedition travels to the Lonely Mountain and finds the secret door; Bilbo scouts the dragon's lair, stealing a great cup and learning of a weakness in Smaug's armour. The enraged dragon, deducing that Lake-town has aided <b>the</b> <b>intruder,</b> sets out to destroy the town. A thrush had overheard Bilbo's report of Smaug's vulnerability and reports it to Lake-town defender Bard. His arrow finds the chink and slays the dragon.|$|E

It is believed he attacked a reconnaissance Dornier Do 17 from Sturzkampfgeschwader 2 ("dive bomber wing 2") which he claimed destroyed, though it appears it made it back to German lines damaged. On 8 April, despite bad weather, Pattle led an attack on Petrich in Yugoslavia and left a number of enemy aircraft destroyed on the ground.|$|E
5|$|This tit-tyrant {{appears to}} be {{territorial}} in defending what it regards as its feeding territory, although it only displays territorial behavior against other tufted tit-tyrants. Birds defending their territory, either alone or in a pair, tend to begin their defense by calling rapidly and displaying displacement behavior, such as bill wiping or wing flaring. They then raise their crest and chase the other tit-tyrant through the shrubs, occasionally physically attacking <b>the</b> <b>intruder.</b> The victorious tit-tyrant then returns to its normal foraging behavior. The southern subspecies, A. p. patagonicus, migrates to northern Argentina after the breeding season; the other populations appear to be non-migratory.|$|E
5|$|After Skinner and Scully {{find and}} {{retrieve}} Praise, Skinner takes {{him to the}} nearest hospital, where his friend Thea visits him, {{closing the door behind}} her. In search for Mulder in the desert, Scully sees a bright light in the sky which she thinks is a spaceship, but which is later revealed to be a helicopter. The helicopter lands and Doggett insists Scully travel with him to the hospital; she reluctantly accepts. At the hospital, two other FBI agents assure the two agents that nothing has happened to Praise; however, they soon discover that he has vanished. Scully leaves to search for Praise, while Doggett stays in an attempt to catch <b>the</b> <b>intruder.</b> He checks the ceiling space, where he finds Skinner badly injured. Meanwhile, Scully finds Praise, along with Skinner, who claims to be protecting the boy. Skinner, who is actually the Alien Bounty Hunter, attempts to kill her but Scully grabs her gun and shoots him in the neck, killing the Bounty Hunter. After Doggett reports the case to Kersh, he is assigned to the X-File division with Scully. The episode ends showing Mulder still held in captivity as six Alien Bounty Hunters look on.|$|E
