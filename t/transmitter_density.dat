The throughput of a mobile ad hoc network powered by energy harvesting is analyzed {{in this paper}} using a stochastic-geometry approach. The transmitters powered by energy harvesting are modeled as a Poisson point process (PPP); each transmits to a receiver at an unit distance using either a random-access protocol or the time-hopping multiple access (THMA) and satisfying an outage-probability constraint. Consider non-EMR energy harvesting where energy packets of random sizes arrive at a transmitter following a stationary random process. By applying Mapping Theorem, the network (spatial) throughput for random access and {{in the limit of}} a long harvesting interval is derived in simple closed-form functions of the energy-arrival rate, <b>transmitter</b> <b>density</b> and coding rate. These results show that the throughput of a sparse network increases logarithmically with the energy-arrival rate and linearly with the <b>transmitter</b> <b>density.</b> Moreover, dense energy arrivals provide marginal throughput gain as the network becomes interference limited but this gain can be enhanced using THMA. Next, EMR energy harvesting is also considered where transmitters harvest energy from transmissions in coexisting networks modeled as independent PPPs. The corresponding expressions of the network throughput can be modified from their non-EMR counterparts such that the harvested EMR power per mobile is equal to a sum of coexisting-network densities weighted by corresponding transmission power and harvesting efficiencies. © 2011 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

In this paper, tractable closed-form expressions for collision probability and MAC layer throughput of mmWave networks, operating under slotted ALOHA and TDMA, are derived.

More specifically, in an urban environment, with high mobility among vehicles, a vehicle’s status from the transmitter can instantly trigger from line of sight to non-line of sight, which may cause loss of real-time communication. In order to overcome this, a deterministic signal propagation model is required, which has less complexity and more feasibility of implementation. Hence, we propose a realistic path loss model which adopts ray tracing technique for VANET in a grid urban environment with less computational complexity. To evaluate the model, it is applied to a vehicular simulation scenario. The results obtained are compared with different path loss models in the same scenario based on path loss value and application layer performance analysis. The proposed path loss model provides higher loss value in dB compared to other models.

Among mmWave bands the 60 -GHz radio technology is specially suited for ultradense small cells and mobile data offloading scenarios. Many challenges remain to be addressed in mmWave communications but among them deafness, or misalignment between transmitter and receivers beams, and interference management lie among the most prominent ones. In the recent years, scenarios considering negligible interference on mmWave resource allocation have been rather common in literature. To this end, interestingly, many open issues still need to be addressed such as the applicability of noise-limited regime for mmWave. Furthermore, in mmWave the beam-steering mechanism imposes a forced silence period, in the course of which no data can be conveyed, that should not be neglected in throughput/delay calculations.

Narrow-beam operation in mmWave networks also reduces multiuser interference, introducing the concept of noise-limited wireless networks as opposed to interference-limited ones. The noise-limited or interference-limited regime heavily reflects on the medium access control (MAC) layer throughput and on proper resource allocation and interference management strategies. Yet, these regimes are ignored in current approaches to mmWave MAC layer design, with the potential disastrous consequences on the communication performance. In this paper, we investigate these regimes in terms of collision probability and throughput. We derive tractable closed-form expressions for the collision probability and MAC layer throughput of mmWave ad hoc networks, operating under slotted ALOHA. The new analysis reveals that mmWave networks may exhibit a non-negligible transitional behavior from a noise-limited regime to an interference-limited one, depending on the <b>density</b> of the <b>transmitters,</b> <b>density</b> and size of obstacles, transmission probability, operating beamwidth, and transmission power. Such transitional behavior necessitates a new framework of adaptive hybrid resource allocation procedure, containing both contention-based and contention-free phases with on-demand realization of the contention-free phase. Moreover, the conventional collision avoidance procedure in the contention-based phase should be revisited, due to the transitional behavior of interference, to maximize throughput/delay performance of mmWave networks.

We examine atypical events when a unexpected large proportion of users are disconnected or connected by proposing a hybrid approach based on ray launching simulation and point process theory. This work is motivated by recent results using large deviations theory applied to the signal-to-interference ratio. This theory provides a tool for the stochastic analysis of atypical but disruptive events, particularly when the density of transmitters is high. For a section of a European city, we introduce a new stochastic model of a single network cell that uses ray launching data generated with the open source RaLaNS package, giving deterministic path loss values.

We start by de&# 64257;ning a bounded version of the well-known physical interference model, in which interference generated by transmitters located beyond a certain distance s from a receiver is ignored when computing the SINR value. We then formally prove that, under the assumption of constant <b>transmitter</b> <b>density</b> per unit area, the aggregate interference generated by far-away interferers converges to 0 {{if and only if}} s is an unbounded, increasing function of the number of nodes.

The concept of the calculation of the MFS within SAMO, considering radio propagation, interferences, receiver and <b>transmitter</b> characteristics, user <b>densities,</b> and protocol aspects are presented. Furthermore, some results of simulation runs are shown in this paper.

INTRODUCTION At the assignment of frequency bands for radio systems the simultaneous, undisturbed service of mobile radio systems which are operating in adjacent frequency bands has to be ensured. Thereby, in respect to frequency economic, the required mi [...] ...|$|R
