50|$|Teaspoons {{with longer}} handles, such as iced <b>tea</b> <b>spoons,</b> are {{commonly}} used also for ice cream desserts or floats. Similar spoons include the tablespoon and the dessert spoon, the latter intermediate in size between a teaspoon and a tablespoon, used in eating dessert and sometimes soup or cereals. Much less common is the coffee spoon, which is a smaller version of the teaspoon, intended for used with the small type of coffee cup. Another teaspoon, called an orange spoon (in American English: grapefruit spoon), tapers to a sharp point or teeth, and is used to separate citrus fruits from their membranes. A bar spoon, equivalent to a teaspoon, is used in measuring ingredients for mixed drinks.|$|R

50|$|Following a short introductional {{treaty on}} the general status of bounty hunters in the Old West, we get {{introduced}} to the titular character, Elliot Belt, a notorious and unscrupulous representative of his trade. His current target is <b>Tea</b> <b>Spoon,</b> the Cheyenne caretaker of the horse ranch of Bronco Fortworth, {{who is accused of}} stealing the rancher's price stallion, Lord Washmouth III; the bounty has been set at a dizzying $100,000. Not caring about whether or not <b>Tea</b> <b>Spoon</b> is innocent, Belt takes up the task of hunting him down, while Lucky Luke tries his best to stop him. Eventually, Elliot Belt himself ends up {{on the wrong side of}} the law as he nearly triggers a war with Tea Spoon's tribe to get his hands on the bounty, and now he is pushed into the role of the hunted.|$|E

40|$|Objects in {{the real}} world do not occur in a random manner. For example <b>tea</b> <b>spoons</b> tend to be near tea cups and there is usually a remote control nearby a TV. A {{cognitive}} system, which is adapted to the environment, would take such co-occurrences into account and use top-down driven expectancies for faster recognition. Although many object recognition theories assume a serial bottom-up processing and disregard top-down feedback from later stages to earlier ones, neuropsychological and imaging studies suggest recurrent feedback during object identication (e. g., Humphreys, Riddoch and Price, 1997, Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London B, 1275 - 1282). We present further evidence for top-down in uences in object recognition using a priming approach. In Experiment 1 participants named objects (e. g., TV) in two dierent views (canonical vs. non-canonical), which were preceded by a contextually consistent (e. g., remote control) or inconsistent (e. g., hammer) priming stimulus. We found clear eects of prime consistency and target viewpoint as well as a signicant interaction. Presenting a consistent prime prior to a target reduced the viewpoint dependency signicantly. These results were replicated in Experiment 2 using a contextual association task. Participants had to judge whether the second of two sequentially presented objects tends to co-occur with the rst one. Consistent priming stimuli reduced the viewpoint-dependency of the reaction times to the target objects. Both experiments provided converging evidence for the view, that the human cognitive system uses knowledge of co-occurrence information for faster recognition...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{eavesdropping}} technique for spying {{at a distance}} on data that is displayed on an arbitrary computer screen, including the currently prevalent LCD monitors. Our technique exploits reflections of the screen’s optical emanations in various objects that one commonly finds {{in close proximity to}} the screen and uses those reflections to recover the original screen content. Such objects include eyeglasses, <b>tea</b> pots, <b>spoons,</b> plastic bottles, and even the eye of the user. We have demonstrated that this attack can be successfully mounted to spy on even small fonts using inexpensive, off-the-shelf equipment (less than 1500 dollars) from a distance of up to 10 meters. Relying on more expensive equipment allowed us to conduct this attack from over 30 meters away, demonstrating that similar attacks are feasible {{from the other side of}} the street or from a close-by building. We additionally establish theoretical limitations of the attack; these limitations may help to estimate the risk that this attack can be successfully mounted in a given environment. 1. ...|$|R

5000|$|A muddling spoon {{is a long}} handled spoon used in bartending. It resembles an iced <b>tea</b> <b>spoon,</b> but {{typically}} has a smaller head. Muddling spoons {{are not the same}} as muddlers, though both are used to make mixed (typically) alcoholic drinks. Also called a [...] "cocktail mixing spoon", the extra-long handle makes it easy to reach the bottom of tall glasses and pitchers to thoroughly stir in and blend cocktails. The twisted handle assists in building visually attractive “stacked” or layered drinks and shots, known as pousse cafe. Gently pouring alcohol and other liquids over the twist eases them into the glass and, with practice, into their own layer.|$|E
60|$|The pawnbroker’s shop is {{situated}} near Drury-Lane, {{at the corner}} of a court, which affords a side entrance for the accommodation of such customers as may be desirous of avoiding the observation of the passers-by, or the chance of recognition in the public street. It is a low, dirty-looking, dusty shop, the door of which stands always doubtfully, a little way open: half inviting, half repelling the hesitating visitor, who, if he be as yet uninitiated, examines one of the old garnet brooches in the window {{for a minute or two}} with affected eagerness, as if he contemplated making a purchase; and then looking cautiously round to ascertain that no one watches him, hastily slinks in: the door closing of itself after him, to just its former width. The shop front and the window-frames bear evident marks of having been once painted; but, what the colour was originally, or at what date it was probably laid on, are at this remote period questions which may be asked, but cannot be answered. Tradition states that the transparency in the front door, which displays at night three red balls on a blue ground, once bore also, inscribed in graceful waves, the words ‘Money advanced on plate, jewels, wearing apparel, and every description of property,’ but a few illegible hieroglyphics are all that now remain to attest the fact. The plate and jewels would seem to have disappeared, together with the announcement, for the articles of stock, which are displayed in some profusion in the window, do not include any very valuable luxuries of either kind. A few old china cups; some modern vases, adorned with paltry paintings of three Spanish cavaliers playing three Spanish guitars; or a party of boors carousing: each boor with one leg painfully elevated in the air, by way of expressing his perfect freedom and gaiety; several sets of chessmen, two or three flutes, a few fiddles, a round-eyed portrait staring in astonishment from a very dark ground; some gaudily-bound prayer-books and testaments, two rows of silver watches quite as clumsy and almost as large as Ferguson’s first; numerous old-fashioned table and <b>tea</b> <b>spoons,</b> displayed, fan-like, in half-dozens; strings of coral with great broad gilt snaps; cards of rings and brooches, fastened and labelled separately, like the insects in the British Museum; cheap silver penholders and snuff-boxes, with a masonic star, complete the jewellery department; while five or six beds in smeary clouded ticks, strings of blankets and sheets, silk and cotton handkerchiefs, and wearing apparel of every description, form the more useful, though even less ornamental, part, of the articles exposed for sale. An extensive collection of planes, chisels, saws, and other carpenters’ tools, which have been pledged, and never redeemed, form the foreground of the picture; while the large frames full of ticketed bundles, which are dimly seen through the dirty casement up-stairs—the squalid neighbourhood—the adjoining houses, straggling, shrunken, and rotten, with one or two filthy, unwholesome-looking heads thrust out of every window, and old red pans and stunted plants exposed on the tottering parapets, to the manifest hazard of the heads of the passers-by—the noisy men loitering under the archway {{at the corner of}} the court, or about the gin-shop next door—and their wives patiently standing on the curb-stone, with large baskets of cheap vegetables slung round them for sale, are its immediate auxiliaries.|$|R
