5|$|Displays are {{classified}} as deimatic or aposematic by <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> of the animals that see them. Where predators are initially startled but learn to eat the displaying prey, the display is classed as deimatic, and the prey is bluffing; where they continue to avoid the prey after tasting it, the display is taken as aposematic, meaning the prey is genuinely distasteful. However, these categories are not entirely mutually exclusive. It is possible for a behaviour to be both deimatic and aposematic, if it both startles a predator and indicates the presence of anti-predator adaptations.|$|E
5|$|In April 2011, the ESRB {{introduced}} a streamlined, automated process for assigning ratings for console downloadable {{games as a}} way to address the rapidly growing volume of digitally-delivered games.

Games rated via this process may be tested post-release to ensure that content was properly disclosed. The survey-based method is also used in the ESRB/CTIA and IARC rating programs for mobile apps.|$|E
5|$|A {{key element}} related to battles is demon negotiation, {{the process by}} which new demons are invited to join the Protagonist and can fight {{alongside}} them. The majority of demons can be talked to in battle by the Protagonist, and some allied demons. After selecting the option to talk, the player selects a demon, which initiates a negotiation. For those demons who can talk, <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> vary by both situation and a demon's temperament: some demons can be bribed with Macca and items, some will ask questions related to subjects like philosophy, while others can be influenced by the Protagonist's skills of flattery or eloquence. A negotiation can fail if the wrong responses are chosen, if the Protagonist's demon roster is full, or if another enemy demon interrupts. When in the party, demons can be summoned or dismissed from battle. The level of assigned Magatama can also affect how negotiation goes.|$|E

5|$|Fenton and Licht {{note that}} the effect of a rattlesnake's {{rattling}} could be deimatic (startle) in inexperienced animals, whether predators or large animals that might injure the snake by stepping on it, but aposematic (a warning signal) in animals that are aware of the rattle's meaning. They refer to the work of Fenton and his colleague David Bates on <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> of the big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus, to the defensive clicks made by moths in the family Arctiidae, which includes the garden tiger moth, Arctia caja. This family includes large, furry, bitter-tasting or poisonous moths. They found that while sounds can startle inexperienced bats, after a few trials the bats ignored the sounds if the prey was edible; but the same sounds can warn experienced bats of bitter-tasting prey (an honest signal).|$|E

Chess identifies three aspects of the Slender Man mythos that tie it to folklore: collectivity (meaning that it is created by a collective, rather than a single individual), variability (meaning that the story changes depending on the teller), and performance (meaning that the storyteller's narrative changes to reflect <b>the</b> <b>responses</b> of his/her audience).|$|E
5|$|The {{architecture}} of the Xgrid system is designed around a job based system; the controller sends agents jobs, and the agents return <b>the</b> <b>responses.</b> The actual computation that the controller executes in an Xgrid system {{is known as a}} job. The job contains all the files required to complete the task successfully, such as the input parameters, data files, directories, executables and/or shell scripts, the files included in an Xgrid job must be able to be executed either simultaneously or asynchronously, or any benefits of running such a job on an Xgrid is lost. Once the job completes, the controller can be set to notify the client of the task's completion or failure, for example by email. The client can leave the network while the tasks are running. It can also monitor the job status on demand by querying the controller, although it cannot track the ongoing progress of individual tasks.|$|E
40|$|An {{intrusion}} response decision-making model {{based on}} hierarchical task network (HTN) planning {{is presented in}} the paper. Compared with other <b>response</b> decision-making models, <b>the</b> <b>response</b> decision-making model consists of not only <b>the</b> <b>response</b> measure decision-making process but also response time decision-making process that is firstly proposed in <b>the</b> paper. <b>The</b> <b>response</b> time decision-making model is able to determine response time for different response HTN subtasks. Owing to the introduction of <b>the</b> <b>response</b> time decision-making, <b>the</b> intrusion <b>response</b> system can apply different response strategies to achieve different response goals set by administrators. <b>The</b> proposed <b>response</b> measure decision-making model can optimize a response plan by balancing <b>the</b> <b>response</b> effectiveness and <b>the</b> <b>response</b> negative impact in both a single response measure and a set of <b>response</b> measures. <b>The</b> <b>response</b> decision-making model is self-adaptive and has the ability of tolerating to false positive IDS alerts.
