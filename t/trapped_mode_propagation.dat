40|$|High-performance {{computers}} today {{allow us}} to approach realistic frequency bands with 3 -D numerical simulations. Methods for regular-grid cartesian sys-tems are well established. Numerical algorithms for more complicated structures like spheres, cylinders, models with complex topography, etc. are less evolved. Here we briefly summarize a recently developed algorithm which allows the nu-merical solution of elastic wave propagation on untructured grids using explicit differential operators. The advantage compared to other techniques for unstruc-tured grids (e. g. finite or spectral elements) {{lies in the fact}} that due to the local character of the operators, no matrix inversion is necessary. We also summarize results from modelling <b>trapped</b> <b>mode</b> wave <b>propagation</b> in fault zones, an area of seismology which- due to the many observations of such waves recently made- is a rapidly expanding field. The question which remains to be resolved is, whether fault zone waves can be used to reliably determine the structure of faults at depth.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of the classical theory of linearised water waves in unbounded domains, <b>trapped</b> <b>modes</b> consist of non-propagating, localised oscillation modes of finite energy occurring at some well-defined frequency and which, in the absence of dissipation, persist in time {{even in the absence of}} external forcing. Jones (1953) proved the existence of <b>trapped</b> <b>modes</b> for problems governed by the Helmholtz equation in semi-infinite domains. <b>Trapped</b> <b>modes</b> have been studied in quantum mechanics, elasticity and acoustics and are known, depending on the context, as bound states, acoustic resonances, Rayleigh-Bloch waves, sloshing <b>modes</b> and motion <b>trapped</b> <b>modes.</b> We consider <b>trapped</b> <b>modes</b> in two dimensional infinite waveguides with either Neumann or Dirichlet boundary conditions. Such problems arise when considering obstacles in acoustic waveguides or bound states in quantum wires for example. The mathematical model is a boundary value problem for the Helmholtz equation. Under the usual assumptions of potential theory, the solution is written in terms of a boundary integral equation. We develop a Boundary Element Method (BEM) program which we use to obtain approximate numerical solutions. We extend existing results by identifying additional <b>trapped</b> <b>modes</b> for geometries already studied and investigate new structures. We also carry out a detailed investigation of <b>trapped</b> <b>modes,</b> using the planewave spectrum representation developed for various characteristic problems from the classical theories of radiation, diffraction and propagation. We use simple planewaves travelling in diverse directions to build a more elaborate solution, which satisfies certain conditions required for a <b>trapped</b> <b>mode.</b> Our approach is fairly flexible so that the general procedure is independent of the shape of the trapping obstacle and could be adapted to other geometries. We apply this method to the case of a disc on the centreline of an infinite Dirichlet acoustic waveguide and obtain a simple mathematical approximation of a <b>trapped</b> <b>mode,</b> which satisfies a set of criteria characteristic of <b>trapped</b> <b>modes.</b> Asymptotically, the solution obtained is similar to a nearly <b>trapped</b> <b>mode,</b> which is a perturbation of a genuine <b>trapped</b> <b>mode.</b> Imperial Users onl...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{radiation}} losses, resonances in open systems are generally complex valued.

40|$|Ultrasonic guided waves {{have been}} used in testing of such an {{elongated}} object as pipe. Its sensitivity and distance resolution, however, have been limited by velocity dispersion and interference of numerous <b>propagation</b> <b>modes</b> of guided waves. <b>Trapped</b> energy <b>mode</b> of vibration of thickness shear waves in a quartz plate has been widely used in frequency control and selection due to its high Q and localization. One of the authors (MO) found similar <b>trapped</b> <b>modes</b> of horizontal shear or torsional waves in a cylinder, which are suitable for inspection of pipes. The resonant frequency and Q of a <b>trapped</b> energy <b>mode</b> can be remotely measured by reflection of a propagating guided wave at its boundary.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} numerically the <b>trapped</b> <b>modes</b> with near zero group velocities supported {{in the ring}} array composed of dielectric nanorods, based on a two-dimensional model. Two sorts of <b>trapped</b> <b>modes</b> in the ring array have been identified: the BCR <b>trapped</b> <b>modes</b> which correspond to the bound modes below the light line {{at the edge of}} the first Brillouin zone in the corresponding planar structure (namely the infinite linear chain); the quasi-BIC <b>trapped</b> <b>modes</b> corresponding to the bound states in the continuum supported in the infinite linear chain. According to the whispering gallery condition, the BCR <b>trapped</b> <b>modes</b> can be supported in the ring array only when the number of dielectric elements N is even, while the quasi-BIC ones always exist no matter whether N is odd or even. For both two kind of <b>trapped</b> <b>modes,</b> the lowest one of each kind possesses the highest Q factor, which are ~ 105 for BCR kind and ~ 1011 for quasi-BIC kind with N= 16 respectively, and the radiation loss increases dramatically as the structural resonance increases. Finally, the behavior of the Q factor with N is explained numerically for the lowest one of each kind of <b>trapped</b> <b>modes.</b> The Q factor scales as Q~exp(0. 662 N) for the quasi-BIC <b>trapped</b> <b>mode</b> and Q~exp(0. 325 N) for the BCR one. Intriguingly, the Q factor of the quasi-BIC <b>trapped</b> <b>mode</b> can be as large as ~ 105 even at N= 8. Compared to the finite linear chain, the structure of ring array exhibits overwhelming advantage in Q factor with the same N because there is no array-edge radiation loss in the ring array.

40|$|Revisiting the {{classical}} acoustics problem of rectangular side-branch cavities in a two-dimensional duct of infinite length {{we use the}} finite element method to numerically compute the acoustic resonances {{as well as the}} sound transmission and reflection for an incoming fundamental duct mode. To satisfy the requirement of outgoing waves in the far field we use two different forms of absorbing boundary conditions, namely the complex scaling method and the Hardy space method. In general the resonances are damped due to radiation losses, but there also exist various types of localized <b>trapped</b> <b>modes</b> with nominally zero radiation loss. The most common type of <b>trapped</b> <b>mode</b> is antisymmetric about the duct axis and becomes quasi-trapped with very low damping if the symmetry about the duct axis is broken. In this case a Fano resonance results with resonance and antiresonance features and drastic changes in the sound transmission and reflection coefficient. Two other types of <b>trapped</b> <b>modes,</b> termed embedded <b>trapped</b> <b>modes,</b> result from the interaction of neighbouring modes or Fabry–P´erot interference in multi-cavity systems. These embedded <b>trapped</b> <b>modes</b> occur only for very particular geometry parameters and frequencies and become highly localized quasi-trapped modes as soon as the geometry is perturbed. We show that all three types of <b>trapped</b> <b>modes</b> are possible in duct-cavity systems and that embedded <b>trapped</b> <b>modes</b> continue to exist when a cavity is moved off centre. If several cavities interact the single-cavity <b>trapped</b> <b>mode</b> splits into several trapped supermodes which might be useful for the design of low-frequency acoustic filters. ...|$|R

A necessary condition for the existence of this potential at the <b>trapped</b> <b>mode</b> frequency is derived and numerical evidence is cited which shows that this condition is not satisfied for an elliptical torus. Calculations of the heave potential for such a torus are made over a range of frequencies, and it is shown that the force coefficients behave in a singular fashion in the vicinity of the <b>trapped</b> <b>mode</b> frequency. An analysis of the time domain problem for a torus which is forced to make small vertical oscillations at the <b>trapped</b> <b>mode</b> frequency shows that the potential contains a term which represents a growing oscillation...|$|R
