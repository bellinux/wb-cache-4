5|$|The world's {{production}} of molybdenum was 250,000 tonnes in 2011, the largest producers being China (94,000t), United States (64,000t), Chile (38,000t), Peru (18,000t) and Mexico (12,000t). The total reserves are estimated at 10 million tonnes, and are mostly concentrated in China (4.3Mt), US (2.7Mt) and Chile (1.2Mt). By continent, 93% of world molybdenum production is about evenly shared between North America, South America (mainly in Chile), and China.

5|$|The main {{production}} company behind Audition was the Japanese company Omega Project. Omega were originally behind {{the production of}} Hideo Nakata's film Ring; {{this was a great}} success in Japan and, subsequently, <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>Asia.</b> Omega had problems setting up the release of Ring in Korea and had the company AFDF Korea work on a Korean re-adaptation of the Ring. The following year, in 1998, Omega partnered again with AFDF Korea and other production companies including Creators Company Connection, Film Face, and Bodysonic to make the adaptation of Ryū Murakami's 1997 novel Audition. Omega wanted to create a film different than supernatural-themed Ring, and chose to adapt Murakami's novel, which lacked this trait. To attempt something different, they hired a screenwriter (Daisuke Tengan) and a director (Takashi Miike) who were not known for working on horror films. Prior to Audition, Tengan was best known as a screenwriter for working with his father (Shohei Imamura) on The Eel, which won the Palme d'Or in 1997.|$|E

5|$|The public {{loved the}} film, with lines {{stretching}} outside of theaters as {{people had to}} wait for the next showing. This, along with box office numbers, led to a reconsideration of the film by critics, and it eventually received a very large amount of praise. It broke box-office records in Japan and <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>Asia,</b> France, Britain, South America, the United States, and Canada, and was a moderate success in Australia for a brief period. It was the most profitable black-and-white sound film ever made, and Hitchcock personally realized well in excess of $15 million. He then swapped his rights to Psycho and his TV anthology for 150,000 shares of MCA, making him the third largest shareholder in MCA Inc., and his own boss at Universal, in theory; however, this did not stop them from interfering with his later films. Psycho was, by a large margin, the most profitable film of Hitchcock's career, earning over $12 million for the studio on release, and $15 million {{by the end of the}} year. Hitchcock's second most profitable was Family Plot ($7,541,000), and third place was a tie between Torn Curtain (1966) and Frenzy (1972), each earning $6,500,000. Around the time of the run's end, the film had grossed $32 million in domestic theaters.|$|E
