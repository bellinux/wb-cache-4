5|$|At {{the end of}} November, Chopin {{returned}} to Paris. He passed the winter in unremitting illness, but gave occasional lessons and was visited by friends, including Delacroix and Franchomme. Occasionally he played, or accompanied <b>the</b> <b>singing</b> <b>of</b> Delfina Potocka, for his friends. During the summer of 1849, his friends found him an apartment in Chaillot, out of {{the centre of the}} city, for which the rent was secretly subsidised by an admirer, Princess Obreskoff. Here in June 1849 he was visited by Jenny Lind.|$|E
5|$|Delayed by {{the late}} arrival of the York garrison, it was late evening before the Royalists were fully deployed. A flurry of rain showers and the discouragement of Newcastle and Eythin persuaded Rupert to delay his attack until the next day. From {{the ranks of the}} allied army he could hear <b>the</b> <b>singing</b> <b>of</b> psalms. As the Royalist troops broke ranks for their supper, Leven noted the lack of {{preparation}} among his opponents and ordered his men to attack at or shortly after 7:30pm, just as a thunderstorm broke out over the moor.|$|E

5|$|Each {{flag of the}} National Olympic Committees {{represented}} {{was brought}} on stage by an athlete representative. Following Olympic tradition, the flag of Greece entered first as the originator of the games, and the flag of Singapore entered last as the host nation. The flag ceremony was followed by <b>the</b> <b>singing</b> <b>of</b> the Games theme song and remarks by Ng Ser Miang, Chairman of the Singapore Youth Olympic Games Organising Committee, and Jacques Rogge, President of the International Olympic Committee. The Singapore Games were then officially declared opened by S.R. Nathan, the President of Singapore. The Olympic flag was brought on stage by eight Olympians—Tan Howe Liang, Yelena Isinbayeva, Yang Yang, Tan Eng Liang, Frankie Fredericks, Patricia Chan, Tao Li and Sergey Bubka—and handed to eight Singaporean youth athletes before it was raised with <b>the</b> <b>singing</b> <b>of</b> the Olympic Hymn in Greek by the Singaporean singers. The Olympic Oath was taken {{on behalf of all}} athletes by Caroline Pei Jia Chew, on behalf of all judges by Syed Abdul Kadir, and on behalf of all coaches by David Lim Fong Jock. Finally, a boat {{in the shape of a}} phoenix carried the Youth Olympic Flame across Marina Bay and was passed between six Singaporean youth athletes in a relay. Sailor Darren Choy was the final torchbearer and lit the cauldron.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} the College Walk festivities {{is one of}} Columbia's older holiday traditions, the lighting of the Yule Log. The Christmas ceremony dates to a period prior to the American Revolutionary War, but lapsed before being revived by University President Nicholas Murray Butler in the early 20th century. A troop of students dressed as Continental Army soldiers carry the eponymous log from the sun-dial to the lounge of John Jay Hall, where it is lit amid <b>the</b> <b>singing</b> <b>of</b> seasonal carols. The Christmas ceremony {{is accompanied by a}} reading of A Visit From St. Nicholas by Clement Clarke Moore and Yes, Virginia, There is a Santa Claus by Francis Pharcellus Church.|$|E
5|$|In Singapore {{primary schools}} at lower levels, lessons {{relating}} to the national anthem and <b>the</b> <b>singing</b> <b>of</b> the national anthem are carried out {{as part of the}} civics and moral education programme. The national anthem is sung in all mainstream schools and armed forces camps at ceremonies held at the beginning and/or the end of each day, during which the national flag is also raised and lowered and the Singapore National Pledge is taken. Both the anthem and the national pledge must not be used for commercial situations.|$|E

5|$|The missionaries {{introduced}} a musical form of chant into Britain, {{similar to that}} used in Rome during the mass. During the 7th and 8th centuries Canterbury was renowned for the excellence of its clergy's chanting, and sent singing masters to instruct others, including two to Wilfrid, who became Bishop of York. Putta, the first Bishop of Rochester, had a reputation for his skill at chanting, which he was said to have learned from the Gregorian missionaries. One of them, James the Deacon, taught chanting in Northumbria after Paulinus returned to Kent; Bede noted that James was accomplished in <b>the</b> <b>singing</b> <b>of</b> the chants.|$|E
5|$|When this {{prayer is}} finished, the choir sings an English {{translation}} of the traditional Latin antiphon Confortare: Be strong and of a good courage; keep the commandments of the Lord thy God, and walk in his ways. During <b>the</b> <b>singing</b> <b>of</b> this antiphon, all stand in their places, and the monarch remains seated in the Coronation Chair still wearing the crown and holding the sceptres. The recitation of this antiphon {{is followed by a}} rite of benediction consisting of several prayers.|$|E
5|$|In Presbyterian {{worship the}} sermon, {{which could be}} several hours long, was seen as central, meaning that {{services}} tended to have a didactic and wordy character. There were also Bible readings and the only participation by the congregation was musical, in <b>the</b> <b>singing</b> <b>of</b> the psalms. From the late seventeenth century the common practice was lining out, by which the precentor sang or read out each line {{and it was then}} repeated by the congregation. From the second quarter of the eighteenth century it was argued that this should be abandoned in favour of the practice of singing stanza by stanza. These innovations became linked to a choir movement that included the setting up of schools to teach new tunes and singing in four parts.|$|E

5|$|On Saint Lucia, wakes {{are held}} on the first and eighth night after a person has died, in {{contrast}} to other Caribbean islands, which hold their wakes on the first and ninth days. Wakes often include music, such as <b>the</b> <b>singing</b> <b>of</b> hymns and drumming. Traditional music for wakes is performed {{both inside and outside}} of the deceased's house. The mourners inside the house sing from a repertoire of songs that are in English and not French Creole, because they are derived from the English-using songs of Lucian churches. The songs include both hymns and sankeys (gospel songs), and are generally responsorial, led by a male singer with the slow, unsyncopated responses of the chorus in unison. The mourners outside the house traditionally perform drumming and a kind of responsorial song performed in Creole and without accompaniment, called kont. These songs often related to the death of the deceased, and may deal with the cause of death, the last words or events surrounding the death. Mourners also dance to both the débòt and bélè, accompanied zo or tibwa and ka.|$|E
5|$|The Kirk had {{considerable}} {{control over the}} lives of the people, with {{a major role in the}} Poor Law and schools and over the morals of the population. Strict Sabbatarianism was vital to Presbyterianism. The sermon was seen as central and the only participation by the congregation <b>the</b> <b>singing</b> <b>of</b> the psalms. Communion was the central occasion of the church, conducted infrequently, at most once a year, often taking a week of festivals as part of a communion season. In the second half of the century there were a series of reforms of church music connected to a choir movement. Episcopalians installed organs and hired musicians, following the practice in English parish churches. Catholic worship was deliberately low key, with musical accompaniment prohibited.|$|E
5|$|The Protocol segment {{followed}} the performances. A tribute {{was made to}} the 20,000 volunteers {{who participated in the}} Games, with Singapore swimmer Rainer Ng making a short speech thanking the volunteers and eight other athletes presenting bouquets to eight representative volunteers. This was then followed by speeches from Ng Ser Miang, Chairman of the Singapore Youth Olympic Games Organising Committee, and Jacques Rogge, IOC President, with Mr. Rogge officially declaring the Games closed in accordance with tradition. The Olympic flag was then lowered with <b>the</b> <b>singing</b> <b>of</b> the Olympic Anthem. In the handover ceremony, the Olympic flag was handed over from Teo Ser Luck, acting as the Mayor of Singapore, through Jacques Rogge, to Ji Jianye, Mayor of Nanjing, China, the host city of the 2014 Summer Youth Olympics. The national anthem of China was then played with the raising of China's flag, and a short video presentation showcasing Nanjing followed. The Youth Olympic Flame was then finally extinguished to the sounds of a flugelhorn. A Celebration Concert marked {{the end of the show}} with songs and performances from local artistes.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} of the 19th century the Anglican {{authorities}} officially disapproved of <b>the</b> <b>singing</b> <b>of</b> hymns in churches, other than metrical psalms, although there was considerable informal hymn-singing in parishes. Heber, according to the poet John Betjeman, was a professed admirer of the hymns of John Newton and William Cowper, {{and was one of the}} first High Church Anglicans to write his own. In all he wrote 57, mainly between 1811 and 1821. Heber wished to publish his hymns in a collection, in which he proposed to include some by other writers. In October 1820 he sought help from the Bishop of London, William Howley, in obtaining official recognition of his collection from the Archbishop of Canterbury. In a noncommittal reply Howley suggested that Heber should publish the hymns, although he proposed to withhold episcopal approval until public reaction could be gauged. Heber began preparing the publication, but was unable to complete arrangements before his departure for India in 1823. The collection was eventually published in 1827, after Heber's death, as Hymns Written and Adapted to the Weekly Church Service of the Year.|$|E
5|$|In {{the decades}} {{following}} the peasant war the city authorities tried {{to suppress the}} memory of this nearly successful revolt. Resistance symbols like the flags or the weapons used by the peasants, in particular their typical clubs with nails on the hitting end (called (Bauern-) Knüttel), were outlawed, confiscated, and destroyed. Documents such as the Bundesbriefe of Huttwil were stashed away in the vaults of the city archives. Any public remembrances or pilgrimages to {{the places where the}} leaders had been executed were forbidden and carried the death penalty, as did <b>the</b> <b>singing</b> <b>of</b> the peasants' war songs. Bern was particularly active in trying to censor the memories of the event and also tried to suppress images of the peasant leaders. Historic texts written during the Ancien Régime of Switzerland generally follow the official diction and mention the peasant war, if they do so at all, only briefly and in negative terms. Works with differing viewpoints were often prohibited. The censorship was not entirely successful; in private, the rural population kept the memories of 1653 alive, and various accounts of the events were printed in Germany.|$|E
