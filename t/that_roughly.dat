Quarrington was in the South Lincolnshire constituency that elected two members to parliament. The franchise was widened by the reforms so <b>that</b> <b>roughly</b> 15% (202) of males in Sleaford and Quarrington could vote in 1868.

5|$|Because of the {{economic}} benefits of good telecommunication infrastructure, there is increasing worry about the inequitable access to telecommunication services amongst various countries of the world—this {{is known as the}} digital divide. A 2003 survey by the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) revealed <b>that</b> <b>roughly</b> a third of countries have fewer than one mobile subscription for every 20 people and one-third of countries have fewer than one land-line telephone subscription for every 20 people. In terms of Internet access, roughly half of all countries have fewer than one out of 20 people with Internet access. From this information, as well as educational data, the ITU was able to compile an index that measures the overall ability of citizens to access and use information and communication technologies. Using this measure, Sweden, Denmark and Iceland received the highest ranking while the African countries Nigeria, Burkina Faso and Mali received the lowest.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} stages of {{mobilisation}} the men of the AIF were selected under some of the toughest criterion of any army in World War I and it is believed <b>that</b> <b>roughly</b> 30 per cent of men that applied were rejected on medical grounds. In order to enlist, men had to be aged between 18 and 35 years of age (although it is believed that men as old as 70 and as young as 14 managed to enlist), and they had to be at least five foot six inches tall (168 centimetres), with a chest measurement of at least 34inches (86 centimetres). Many of these strict requirements were lifted later in the war, however, as the need for replacements grew. Indeed, casualties among the initial volunteers were so high, that of the 32,000 original soldiers of the AIF only 7,000 would survive {{to the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Initial {{reports from}} Nukuʻalofa on December31 {{indicated}} severe agricultural damage but few infrastructural losses.

Surveys by the Red Cross revealed <b>that</b> <b>roughly</b> 200 homes in the city were severely damaged or destroyed and those left standing lost their roofs. Vava'u lost roughly 90% of its crops, including essential food crops such as taro, yams and bananas. In Ha'apai, one person died from cardiac arrest {{brought on by the}} storm. Fallen trees blocked numerous roads; power and water supplies were also interrupted to most residents. Severe damage also took place on Niuatoputapu where coastal homes were impacted by Waka's storm surge and several structures lost their roofs.

Blackburn arrived on September 7 to find <b>that</b> <b>roughly</b> 20 percent of the town's population were ill with yellow fever.

In late September, when it appeared the Hickman epidemic was waning, Blackburn traveled to Chattanooga and Martin, Tennessee, to render aid, but within ten days, he received word that the outbreak in Hickman had resurged and spread to nearby Fulton, Kentucky. Blackburn returned to the area and continued his ministrations until late October, when the outbreak had fully subsided.|$|E
5|$|On either 10 or 11 June 323BC, Alexander died in {{the palace}} of Nebuchadnezzar II, in Babylon, at age 32. There are two {{different}} versions of Alexander's death and details of the death differ slightly in each. Plutarch's account is <b>that</b> <b>roughly</b> 14 days before his death, Alexander entertained admiral Nearchus, and spent the night and next day drinking with Medius of Larissa. He developed a fever, which worsened until {{he was unable to}} speak. The common soldiers, anxious about his health, were granted the right to file past him as he silently waved at them. In the second account, Diodorus recounts that Alexander was struck with pain after downing a large bowl of unmixed wine in honour of Heracles, followed by 11 days of weakness; he did not develop a fever and died after some agony. Arrian also mentioned this as an alternative, but Plutarch specifically denied this claim.|$|E
5|$|The 1931 British Census {{recorded}} {{more than}} 1,000 Cypriot-born people, {{but many of}} these were the children of British military personnel serving in the Mediterranean. However, some Greek Cypriots did migrate to the UK in the 1920s and 1930s, often finding jobs in the catering industry in Soho. By the start of the Second World War, there were around 8,000 Cypriots in London. More Cypriot immigrants arrived during the National Organisation of Cypriot Fighters (EOKA)'s campaign for Cypriot independence from Britain and union with Greece, which started in 1955. In the four years of conflict, an average of 4,000 Cypriots left the island per year for the UK, because of violence on the island and the fear felt by both Greek and Turkish Cypriots in mixed villages where they formed minorities. Migration peaked following independence in 1960, with around 25,000 Cypriots migrating in the year that followed. Many migrants joined family already living in Britain. Further migration accompanied the Turkish invasion of the island in 1974. Home Office figures show <b>that</b> <b>roughly</b> 10,000 Cypriots fled to the UK, the majority of them refugees, but many of them subsequently returned to the island.|$|E

5|$|The {{long-term}} {{future of}} the Jupiter trojans is open to question, because multiple weak resonances with Jupiter and Saturn cause them to behave chaotically over time.

Simulations show that the orbits of up to 17% of Jupiter trojans are unstable {{over the age of}} the Solar System. Levison et al. believe <b>that</b> <b>roughly</b> 200 ejected Jupiter trojans greater than 1km in diameter might be travelling the Solar System, with a few possibly on Earth-crossing orbits.
