5|$|Despite {{the extensiveness}} {{of the ruling}} in Anisminic, it appears {{that there may be}} {{instances}} where the courts will still be bound by the jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional error of law divide. Cane has noted <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>three</b> views. The first is that the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law is still relevant, while the second is that all errors of law go to jurisdiction. The third view takes a middle ground that allows for certain exceptions to the approach in the second view.|$|E

5|$|Some sources, such as Claxton, state <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> only {{a single}} boiler, but others, such as Fletcher and Maginnis, state <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>three</b> side by side. This {{apparent}} discrepancy is {{explained by the fact}} <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>three</b> separate boilers or boiler compartments sharing a common housing.|$|R

5|$|The {{spore print}} is white; spores are {{cylindrical}}, smooth, and measure 7–11 by 2–3μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) have a shape ranging from cylindrical to club-shaped, and dimensions of 20–40 by 3–5μm. The hymenium features numerous hyphidia (modified terminal hyphae), which measure 2–3μm. The hyphal system of Daedaleopsis confragrosa is trimitic, meaning <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>three</b> types of hyphae in the fruit body: skeletal hyphae, which provide structural support, are thick walled, measuring 3–7μm in diameter; generative hyphae, responsible for new growth, {{can be either}} thin- or thick-walled, may contain clamps, and measure 2–6μm; binding hyphae, thick-walled and much branched, are 2–5μm.|$|E
5|$|There are two {{fragments}} of the lists of Hebrew names; one on the recto of the first surviving folio and one on folio 26, which is currently inserted {{at the end of}} the prefatory matter for John. The first list fragment contains the end of the list for the Gospel of Matthew. The missing names from Matthew would require an additional two folios. The second list fragment, on folio 26, contains about a fourth of the list for Luke. The list for Luke would require an additional three folios. The structure of the quire in which folio 26 occurs is such that it is unlikely <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>three</b> folios missing between folios 26 and 27, so that it is almost certain that folio 26 is not now in its original location. There is no trace of the lists for Mark and John.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the title}} of the episode and the {{invocation}} spoken by the character of Sammael refer to four of the nine choirs of angels in Christian mythology. Christian angelology holds <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>three</b> groupings of three choirs each. The Thrones are the third-highest ranking choir, belonging to the group charged with attending to God, and are described as stern incarnations of holy justice. Dominions, the fourth-highest choir, belong to the group appointed to deal with God's creations. Dominions lead the lower orders and impart wisdom to humanity. Powers belong to the same tier as Dominions, and are tasked with countering the threat of temptation by the devil and demons. Principalities are the seventh-highest ranking choir and belong to the lowest grouping of angels, those most likely to appear to mankind. Principalities oversee those humans who rule over others, teaching kings and heads of families the skills needed to lead.|$|E

25|$|A 2013 study {{edited by}} Alan L. Titus and Mark A. Loewen on dinosaurs of {{southern}} Utah suggested {{the separation of}} Teratophoneus, Bistahieversor and Lythronax (UMNH VP 20200 - the Waheap tyrannosaurid). That means <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>three</b> or more tyrannosaurid taxa present in the Western Interior Basin. Their analysis found that the three southern tyrannosaurid form a clade {{to the exclusion of}} other tyrannosaurids from northern Campanian formations.|$|E
25|$|As {{there are}} several {{different}} types of feminism and different beliefs held by feminists, there are different versions of ecofeminism. Charlene Spretnak has argued <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>three</b> main 'paths' to ecofeminism, and that they draw in {{a diverse group of}} people, which strengthens any movement, such as: 1) through the study of political theory as well as history; 2) through the belief and study of nature-based religions; 3) through environmentalism.|$|E

25|$|Data from ESA's Mars Express {{indicates}} <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>three</b> {{main parts}} {{to the ice}} cap. The most reflective part of the ice cap is approximately 85% dry ice and 15% water ice. The second part, where the ice cap forms steep slopes at the boundary with the surrounding plain, is almost exclusively water ice. Finally, the ice cap is surrounded by permafrost fields that extend for tens of kilometres north away from the scarps.|$|E
25|$|The {{theory of}} {{segmented}} assimilation for second-generation immigrants is highly researched in the sociological arena. Segmented assimilation {{focuses on the}} notion that people take different paths in how they adapt to life in the United States. This theory states <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>three</b> main different paths of assimilation for second-generation immigrants. Some immigrants assimilate smoothly into the white middle class of America, others experience downward assimilation, and others experience rapid economic success while preserving the values of their immigrant community.|$|E
25|$|Theories {{have been}} {{proposed}} {{that there is no}} foundation in Norse mythology for the notion that the three main norns should each be associated exclusively with the past, the present, and the future; rather, all three represent destiny as it is twined with the flow of time. Moreoever, theories {{have been proposed}} that the idea <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>three</b> main norns may be due to a late influence from Greek and Roman mythology, where there are also spinning fate goddesses (Moirai and Parcae).|$|E

25|$|This idea of {{a romantic}} {{universal}} poesy can be seen clearly in the romantic triad. This theoretical structure always shows its recipient that the described moment is exactly the moment (kairos) in which the future is decided. These frequently mentioned critical points correspond with the artist’s feeling for the present, which Novalis shares with many other contemporaries of his time. Thus a triadic structure {{can be found in}} most of his works. This means <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>three</b> corresponding structural elements which are written differently concerning the content and the form.|$|E
25|$|Opponents {{of the dam}} {{point out}} <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>three</b> {{different}} kinds of floods on the Yangtze River: floods which originate in the upper reaches, floods which originate in the lower reaches, and floods along {{the entire length of}} the river. They argue that the Three Gorges dam will actually make flooding in the upper reaches worse and have little or no impact on floods which originate in the lower reaches. Twelve hundred years of low water marks on the river were recorded in the inscriptions and the carvings of carp at Baiheliang, now submerged.|$|E
25|$|It {{can also}} be noted <b>that</b> <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>three</b> {{different}} types of eye movements: vergence movements, saccadic movements and pursuit movements. Vergence movements involve the cooperation of both eyes to allow for an image to fall on the same area of both retinas. This results in a single focused image. Saccadic movements {{is the type of}} eye movement that makes jumps from one position to another position and is used to rapidly scan a particular scene/image. Lastly, pursuit movement is smooth eye movement and is used to follow objects in motion.|$|E
