40|$|A {{theoretical}} and widely-quoted {{finding is that}} levels of cooperative R&D exceed noncooperative R&D levels when technological spillovers are relatively large, while the opposite holds for relatively small tech-nological spillovers. We qualify this result by showing that for rela-tively small technological spillovers the comparison is not driven by the extent of <b>technological</b> <b>spillover,</b> but by the increase in technolog-ical spillover due to cooperation in R&D. In particular, an agreement to cooperate in R&D always raises R&D efforts if the post-cooperative <b>technological</b> <b>spillover</b> rate is ‘high enough’...|$|E
30|$|In view of {{possible}} adjustments and coping strategies, one feasible way {{for developing countries}} to improve <b>technological</b> <b>spillover</b> is to choose industrial sectors with large diffusion effects for international trade activities. Developing countries, however, are often forced to be low-locked in the global value chain due to their own resource endowments, division of global value chains and various other reasons (Gereffi, 1999; Cramer, 1999). Another feasible idea is to promote <b>technological</b> <b>spillover</b> by strengthening the diffusion effect of the industrial sectors, in which processes of domestic trade {{can play a role}} by adjusting the matching of production and demand, and also by reducing inter-regional market fragmentation (Zhang Hao, 2014). So far, few studies have analyzed the impact of domestic trade.|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} operational optimization {{models of}} systematic technology adoption commonly assume {{the existence of}} a global social planner and ignore the existence of heterogeneous decision makers who interact with each other. This paper develops a stylized (or conceptual) optimization model of systematic technology adoption with heterogeneous agents (i. e., decision makers) and uncertain technological learning. Each agent attempts to identify optimal solutions to adopting technologies for a portion of the entire system. The agents in the model have different foresight and different risk attitudes and interact with one another in terms of <b>technological</b> <b>spillover.</b> This paper first illustrates that although a well recalibrated representative model can perform well enough when the interest is placed on aggregate variables, it could react to a policy (a carbon tax in this paper) differently from the multi-agent model. Then this paper explores how the agents’ heterogeneities and interactions affect the optimal solutions of systematic technology adoption. The main findings of the study are that (1) the existence of multiple agents implies a slower adoption of advanced technologies in the entire system than assuming {{the existence of a}} global social planner, (2) with homogeneous agents, <b>technological</b> <b>spillover</b> tends to enhance the lock-in effect on previous technologies, and (3) with heterogeneous agents, even a small <b>technological</b> <b>spillover</b> rate can significantly accelerate the adoption of the advanced technology...|$|E

The present paper investigates {{the implications of this}} observation for the investment decisions of a technologically leading and lagging firm, located in different countries. <b>Technological</b> <b>spillovers</b> may induce "technology sourcing" foreign direct investment by the less advanced firm, as it seeks to upgrade its technology.

Following a historical outline and a brief analytical sketch of the R&D based models, the results from fitting three structural models to data are presented.

The mechanism of inter-sectoral adjustments to the long-run growth path are also discussed. Results from selected econometric studies are reviewed.

40|$|The present paper, restricting its {{attention}} to the empirical economics literature, attempts to gauge current thinking {{on the question of}} whether FDI causes economic growth. Since <b>technological</b> <b>spillovers</b> are a key determinant of long run economic growth, the survey begins with the firm level evidence on <b>technological</b> <b>spillovers</b> of FDI on domestic firms. The macro FDI and growth literature is covered next. Finally, we examine the effect of FDI on income inequality and/or employment, skills, or jobs. In many contexts policies that exacerbate income inequality come under special scrutiny even if they are welfare enhancing. Our major finding is that FDI is generally associated with positive <b>technological</b> <b>spillovers,</b> economic growth, and increasing income inequality. For all three of these results, however, there are significant counter examples in the literature which must be respected. ...|$|R

These hypotheses are tested using a battery of institutional proxies (governance, economic freedom, intellectual property rights and ease of doing business) and two channels for <b>technological</b> <b>spillovers</b> (trade and FDI) in a panel of developed and transition economies. The results confirm that good institutions have positive and comparable direct effects on productivity across the board. However, they moderate differently the relationship between foreign <b>technological</b> <b>spillovers</b> and productivity. Thus, governance, IPR and economic freedom exhibit negative moderation {{in the case of}} transition economies, while easiness of doing business moderates positively this relationship for both groups of countries. Further, the moderation effects are larger for transition economies and for trade-related spillovers.
