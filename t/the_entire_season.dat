5|$|Ottawa {{was locked}} in a {{contract}} dispute with then-captain Alexei Yashin during the 1999–2000 season. Yashin held out for <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>season,</b> hoping either to play elsewhere or claim his contract was for 1999–2000, not a year of service. The team responded by suspending him for <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>season</b> and granting the captaincy to Daniel Alfredsson. Yashin tried to sign on with a team in Switzerland, but the International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) banned him from playing internationally until the dispute with the Senators was resolved. An NHL arbitrator rejected Yashin's request {{to make him a}} free agent, instead ruling that he owed the Senators one more season if he ever returned to the NHL. The Senators even took legal action to recover damages suffered {{as a result of the}} dispute.|$|E
5|$|Young pitched six shutout {{innings in}} the second game of the season before being pulled with a right {{shoulder}} strain.

Durant was on the sidelines as starting quarterback Kerry Joseph led Roughriders to a victory over the Winnipeg Blue Bombers in the Grey Cup.|$|E
5|$|During {{training}} camp {{prior to the}} 1952 season, Van Buren tore a knee ligament and required surgery. He missed <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>season</b> and retired as a player in September 1953, but remained on the Eagles payroll in a public relations capacity. He finished his career having carried 1,320 times for 5,860 yards and 69 touchdowns.

5|$|Former All Black Jamie Joseph {{was hired}} as coach for the 2011 Super Rugby season, while Jamie Mackintosh {{replaced}} Cowan as team captain.

They remained in playoff contention for almost <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>season,</b> sitting 8–4 at one juncture, before slumping under an injury cloud {{at the end of the}} year to finish 8th on the table.|$|E

5|$|In 1950, Reynolds won 16 games, {{even though}} he pitched with bone chips in his elbow for <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>season.</b> His {{remarkable}} 1951 season began under very difficult conditions. Floating chips in his elbow prevented him from throwing a single pitch in spring training. He was resigned to having surgery which would have cost him {{at least half of}} the season. Dr. George Bennett of Johns Hopkins University recommended against surgery. Reynolds appeared in his first game one week after the season started.|$|E
5|$|Tennessee {{defeated}} Connecticut {{again in}} the 1997–98 regular season. A mini controversy erupted {{in the days after}} the game when Tennessee's Chamique Holdsclaw was quoted in the papers as saying UConn looked scared during the game; Auriemma denounced that quote. With Shea Ralph and senior Nykesha Sales out for <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>season,</b> freshman Svetlana Abrosimova led a young UConn team to the NCAA Tournament Regional Final where they eventually lost to North Carolina State 60–52.|$|E
5|$|Texas {{had very}} few {{problems}} affecting the roster. Only one defensive starter missed a game due to injury.

5|$|The 1957–58 {{season was}} an unusual one for Manchester City, which became the first and thus far only English team both to score and to concede 100 goals in a season. Trautmann played in 34 matches, and {{though he did not}} play in the 9–2 defeat to West Bromwich Albion, an 8–4 defeat to Leicester City was a record for the most goals conceded by Trautmann in a match in his career, and in <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>season</b> he kept only two clean sheets.|$|E

5|$|The Red Sox's defeat {{disappointed}} Boston fans, who {{had been}} rooting <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>season</b> for an All-Boston World Series.

5|$|The teams {{returned}} to Melbourne {{for the fifth}} Test, where Woodfull scored 102 and 35 {{in front of his}} home crowd as Australia won by five wickets.

5|$|Against Georgia, most critics thought Maryland faced {{its first}} true test. In the first quarter, the Terrapins {{took a quick}} 14–0 lead and held the Bulldogs to six {{offensive}} plays, two of which were punts. In the second quarter, Georgia quarterback Zeke Bratkowski led his team to two consecutive touchdown drives, and the score was 21–13 in favor of Maryland at halftime. Two minutes into the third quarter, Faloney intercepted a Bratkowski pass and returned it for a touchdown. Bratkowski {{was taken out of}} the game after numerous sacks by Stan Jones and Bob Morgan. The 40–13 final result would be the most points the Terrapins allowed during <b>the</b> <b>entire</b> <b>season.</b>|$|E
