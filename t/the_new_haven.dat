5|$|<b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Haven</b> and New London Railroad was {{merged with}} the New London and Stonington in 1857 to form <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Haven,</b> New London and Stonington Railroad. The line was leased by the New York, Providence and Boston Railroad (NYP) in 1859. The NYP bought the section east of Groton {{outright}} in 1864; the section from New London westward was spun off as the Shore Line Railway. In 1870, the Shore Line was leased by the New York and New Haven Railroad, which itself {{became part of the}} New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad in 1872. At some point during this series of events, the 1852-built station was replaced by a larger, two-story structure, which was also used by some through trains from the north.|$|E

5|$|After the {{previous}} depot was destroyed, the Central Vermont Railroad (which then leased the New London Northern) began making {{plans for a}} larger replacement station.

5|$|The Penn Central Railroad {{acquired}} the yard {{along with the}} rest of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Haven</b> in 1968; the property was transferred to Conrail on March 30, 1976, and to Amtrak a day later.

5|$|At {{its peak}} in 1912, the B {{operated}} 12 Boston-Albany round trips, one Boston-Pittsfield round trip, {{and as many as}} 10 Pittsfield-North Adams round trips. Around 1913 <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Haven</b> planned to use the Housatonic as part of a New York-Montreal through route to compete with the NYC, but this never materialized and service levels were never high. After 1926 New Haven operated two daily New York-Pittsfield round trips with additional weekend service plus a Great Barrington-Pittsfield commuter trip operated by a rail bus. After 1935, nonstop New York-Pittsfield weekend trips were added for skiers during the winter.|$|E

The route proceeds northward along Purchase Street as a two-lane street through the Locust Avenue Business District, intersecting a handful of local streets and serving Rye's station on the Metro-North Railroad's New Haven Line. Past the station, the highway passes under <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Haven</b> Line, Amtrak's Northeast Corridor line, and I-95 in quick succession ahead of the Purchase Street Business District. The commercial surroundings give way to residential neighborhoods after three blocks as NY120 winds northward through the northern part of Rye to the adjacent village/town of Harrison.|$|E

While VT116 continues north along Beaver Brook, VT17 remains in the vicinity of Baldwin Creek as it heads northeast through the Green Mountains.|$|E
5|$|The NYC {{merged into}} Penn Central Railroad on February 1, 1968, {{followed}} by <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Haven</b> on December 31.

On May 1, 1971, Amtrak took over most passenger service in the United States.

It was the first culinary college in the United States. With assistance from Yale University, the school purchased the Davies mansion in New Haven's Prospect Hill neighborhood. The first class consisted of sixteen students and the faculty included a dietitian, a baker, and a chef. In 1947 the school was renamed the Restaurant Institute of Connecticut to reflect its growing repute; the school's name was changed again to the Culinary Institute of America in 1951.|$|E
5|$|The {{report also}} called for three {{commuter}} rail modernizations. <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Haven</b> Railroad commuter service would get 144 EMUs, as well as signal improvements, high-level platforms, and renovated cars. The Penn Central Railroad would get 130 EMUs, high-level platforms, and electrified trackage north to the Brewster station. The Erie Lackawanna Railroad in New York State would get new equipment, and a study would be conducted {{to determine whether the}} ELRR could go to Pennsylvania Station. All of these improvements were to extend into Phase II of the project.|$|E
5|$|Union Station is {{the sixth}} {{railroad}} station to serve New London. When the New London, Willimantic, and Palmer Railroad opened in 1848, an existing building on Water Street a block east of Federal Street was {{converted into a}} station.

5|$|Berkshire Division service {{began to}} decline before World War II, when {{increased}} automobile availability reduced the appeal of travel by train. The line had always used the oldest equipment on the railroad, and all trains except one weekly round trip lost their parlor cars in 1940 and 1942. In January 1960, profitable railway post office service was ended due to unsuitable schedules, and starting in March 1960 all trains except two weekend through round trips were run by single Budd RDCs and truncated to Danbury where passengers could change for local trains to New York. In November 1960, <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Haven</b> moved its station services from Union Station to a converted freight house slightly to the east to save money, leaving the B alone in the station. In March 1964, the Interstate Commerce Commission authorized the NYNH to cut all Berkshire Division services except the weekend trips.|$|E
5|$|Railroad {{stations}} have been located in downtown Pittsfield since the Western Railroad opened in 1841. The original station burned in 1854; after its replacement proved inadequate, a union station {{was constructed in}} 1866 to serve the Western plus the Housatonic Railroad and the Pittsfield and North Adams Railroad. A second, larger union station replaced it in 1914. <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Haven</b> Railroad and New York Central Railroad moved to smaller depots in 1960 and 1965, and Union Station was demolished in 1968. Rail service to Pittsfield ended in 1971 but returned in 1975 {{and moved to a}} new shelter downtown in 1981. The Scelsi ITC opened in 2004 to combine local and intercity bus and intercity rail operations into one location.|$|E
5|$|The {{segment of}} the Third Avenue El in the Bronx would be {{demolished}} and replaced with a new subway line under Park Avenue, parallel to <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Haven</b> Line Metro-North tracks. The Park Avenue Subway would connect with the Second Avenue trunk line in the South Bronx, where trains from Park Avenue would merge onto the same tracks as trains from the Dyre Avenue and Pelham spurs. In the same borough, the MCTA would also extend the then now-IND Pelham Line to Co-op City. It would also lengthen the IND Concourse Line to White Plains Road, with {{a connection to the}} IRT White Plains Road Line at either Burke Avenue or Gun Hill Road.|$|E
