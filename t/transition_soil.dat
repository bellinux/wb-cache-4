40|$|Although the {{influence}} of phosphorus loading on the Everglades ecosystem has received {{a great deal of}} attention, most research has targeted macro indicators, such as those based on vegetation or fauna, or chemical and physical parameters involved in biogeochemical cycles. Fewer studies have addressed the role of microorganisms, and these have mainly targeted gross informative parameters such as microbial biomass, enzymatic activities, and microbial enumerations. The objectives of this study were to characterize the dy-namics of sulfate-reducing and methanogenic assemblages using terminal restriction fragment length poly-morphism (T-RFLP) targeting the dissimilatory sulfite reductase (dsrA) and methyl coenzyme M reductase (mcrA) genes, respectively, and assess the impact of nutrient enrichment on microbial assemblages in the northern Everglades. T-RFLP combined with principal component analysis was a powerful technique to discriminate between soils from sites with eutrophic, transitional, and oligotrophic nutrient concentrations. dsrA T-RFLP provided a higher level of discrimination between the three sites. mcrA was a relatively weaker system to distinguish between sites, since it could not categorically discriminate between eutrophic and <b>transition</b> <b>soil</b> samples, but may be useful as an early indicator of phosphorus loading which is altering hydrogenotrophic methanogenic community in the transition zones, making them more similar to eutrophic zones. Clearly, targeting a combination of different microbial communities provides greater insight into th...|$|E

Current methods of {{evaluating the quality of}} wetlands include assessing vegetation, soil type, and period of inundation. With recent advances in molecular and bioinformatic techniques, measurement of the structure and composition of soil bacterial communities have become an alternative to traditional methods of ecological assessment. The objective of the current study was to determine whether soil bacterial community composition and structure changed along a single transect in Macon County, AL. Proteobacteria were the most abundant phyla throughout the soils in the study (ranging from 42. 1 % to 49. 9 % of total sequences). Phyla Acidobacteria (37. 4 %) and Verrucomicrobia (7. 0 %) were highest in wetland soils, Actinobacteria (14. 6 %) was highest in the transition area, and Chloroflexi (1. 6 %) was highest in upland soils. Principle Components Analysis (relative abundance) and Principle Coordinates Analysis (PCoA) (Unifrac weighted metric) plots were generated, showing distinction amongst the ecosystem types through clustering by taxonomic abundance and Unifrac scores at 3 % dissimilarity, respectively. Selected soil properties (soil organic carbon and phosphatase enzyme activity) also differed significantly in <b>transition</b> <b>soil</b> ecosystem types, while showing predominance in the wetland area. This study suggests that with further study the structure and composition of soil bacterial communities may eventually be an important indicator of ecological impact in wetland ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|Colluvial soils {{on natural}} terrains are usually coarse and their grain-size distributionsvary with location. Shallow-seated {{failures}} {{are the main}} failure mode in colluvial soil deposits under rainfall infiltration and the corresponding confining pressures are typically low. So far the compression behaviour, shearing behaviour and instability behaviour of saturated and unsaturated coarse granular soils under low confining pressures have not been fully studied. The main objectives of this thesis are to characterize the microstructures of coarse and widely graded soils to provide a physical explanation of the soil behaviour, investigate the effect of coarse content on the soil-water characteristic curve (SWCC), compressibility and shearing behaviour of saturated and unsaturated coarse granular soils under very low confining pressures, develop a physical model for the bimodal SWCC and a general shear strength model for bimodal coarse soils, and study the critical state characteristics and instability of saturated and unsaturated coarse granular soils. The microstructure, compressibility, SWCC, shearing behaviour and critical state characteristics of coarse granular soils are investigated in an integrated manner. As the coarse content increases, the soil microstructures change from fines-controlled to coarse-controlled. A transition is observed at a critical coarse content of approximately 70 %. The skeletons of the fines-controlled and coarse-controlled soils are formed by clay aggregates and coarse particles, respectively. The high stiffness of the skeletons of the two soils results in the low compressibility and dilative behaviour of these soils. Clay aggregates and coarse particles together form the skeleton of the <b>transition</b> <b>soil,</b> which exhibits high compressibility and strong contractive behaviour as the saturated clay aggregates tend to collapse into the large inter-aggregate pores and contract. With increasing coarse content, the pore structure of soil changes from a unimodal intra-aggregate pore structure to a dual-porosity structure having both intra-aggregate pores and inter-aggregate pores. Accordingly, the SWCC changes from unimodal to bimodal. The effects of the pore water in the two pore series on the critical state parameters during the desaturation process are different. The results are useful {{for the development of}} constitutive models for unsaturated soils, especially bimodal soils. A physical model is developed for the bimodal SWCC. The model is closely related to the dual porosity structure of the soil. The whole drainage process on the bimodal SWCC is divided into four stages based {{on the role of the}} pore water. In stage a, all the pores are filled with water. The bulk water drains from the inter-aggregate pores in stage b, in which the free water forms a continuous phase. The drainage of the meniscus water in the inter-aggregate pores follows in stage c, in which the water in the inter-aggregate pores becomes disconnected while the fines aggregates stay saturated. Further, the water stored in the intra-aggregate pores drains in stage d, and the clay aggregates become unsaturated. The compressibility and shear strength of the soil with a bimodal SWCC also exhibit bimodal features. The overall shear strength behaviour over the entire suction range shows two modes, which is not reported in the literature. A shear strength model is proposed to calculate the shear strength of granular soils with a bimodal SWCC. The proposed equation can be degenerated to predict the shear strength of unimodal sand and Kaolin clay. An equivalent mean effective stress taking into account the suction stress is proposed to describe the instability of an unsaturated soil subject to wetting. An instability line is defined for the unsaturated coarse grained soil. A relationship between the normalized slope of the instability line and state parameter is established for rapid assessment of the instability of both saturated and unsaturated coarse granular soils. The line separates the soil states into stable and unstable states in the stress space. If the stress conditions of a soil element reach this line, instability is to be initiated...|$|E
40|$|Seven {{transitional}} soils {{were selected}} to investigate the transition of Spodosols and Ultisols in the subalpine forests of Taiwan whose elevations range from 1900 m to 2700 m and have udic soil moisture regimes and mesic soil temperature regimes. The selected transitional forest soils include seven Ultic Spodosols based on USDA Soil Taxonomy, or seven Podzols based on the World Reference Base classification system. The soils with gentle landscape with < 10 % of slope are derived from sandstone and shale. The study area experiences a cool and humid climate with very high annual rainfall, ranging from 3000 to 4500 mm. The vegetation is coniferous vegetation dominated by Taiwan red cypress, Taiwan red pine, and peacock pine. The <b>transition</b> <b>soils</b> of Spodosols and Ultisols in Taiwan are specially characterized by loamy or clayey soil texture classes in the B horizon with clay contents ranging from 250 to 400 g/kg. High rainfall promotes the formation of these <b>transition</b> <b>soils</b> associated with strong illuviation of clay, organic carbon, free iron oxides, or organo-metallic complexes.

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 Vegetation as a soil-forming {{factor was}} studied under forest {{transition}} and grass {{while attempting to}} keep other soil forming factors constant {{in the western part}} of the Willamette Valley, Oregon. The physiographic units consist chiefly of the interior foothills and slopes formed from an old basaltic flow with some interspersed sedimentary formations. The soils and vegetation of these physiographic units are developing under a temperate humid climate characterized by dry summers and mild, rainy winters., The foothills and slopes support stands of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and Oregon white oak (Quercus garryana). Scattered through the area are non-forested openings. Many ecologists have looked into the successional relationships of the communities within the Willamette Valley. One school believes that the open conditions became established during a time of warmer and perhaps dried hypsithermal climate that occurred near the middle of the postglacial time. Fire control activities motivated by the settlers are, however, thought to be responsible for the successional change [...] replacement of a prairie by Quercus savanna, then by Quercus /Pseudotsuga, then by Pseudotsuga, etc. The soils under both vegetation types were similar (classified as series) and they ranged from Mollisols to Ultisols. To gain insight into the effects of vegetation on soil development, physical and chemical analyses were carried out and values were obtained for the following: particle sizes, pH, organic matter and organic carbon, total N, exchangeable cations and free Fe oxides. The establishment of two different vegetational assemblages has had a direct impact on the soils. The soil parameters that are affected by the plant cover are directly or indirectly associated with the organic matter with the exception of exchangeable sodium. Generally, there are some differences in both color and structure of the soils under these two vegetation types, but they are not adequately quantified to show statistical differences. The profiles range from very strongly acid in soils derived from sedimentary rock, to neutral in the soils derived from basaltic rock. The pH of soils under grass is significantly higher than that of the forest <b>transition</b> <b>soils.</b> There is subsurface accumulation of silicate clays but there is not much sign of the accumulation of oxides. The exchangeable potassium contents of forest <b>transition</b> <b>soils</b> are significantly higher than those of the grassland soils. This is attributed to greater recycling of potassium by tree species. The percentages of total nitrogen in the A horizons of the grassland soils are significantly higher than those of the A horizons under forest transition. The carbon/nitrogen ratios of forest <b>transition</b> <b>soils</b> are significantly higher than those of grassland soils. All these are attributable to the qualities of the organic matter in the soils of the two vegetation types. The overall exchangeable sodium in the forest <b>transition</b> <b>soils</b> is significantly higher than that of the grassland soils. The reason for this might be that the area under study is very close to the ocean and that the trees are able to trap wind-borne salt spray from the ocean, which is eventually washed down the profile Research is needed to prove this hypothesis. The soils of the study area do not possess features of podzolic soils even though they occur in a latitude and under a forest vegetation where podzolic soils are commonly formed. This can be attributed to the climate of this area and the nature of the parent material of the soils under study...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} were: 1) to quantify the amount of supplemental nitrogen (N) to maximize organic broccoli (Brassica olearcea var. italica) on <b>transition</b> <b>soils,</b> 2) to evaluate the ability of leguminous cover crops lablab (Dolichos lablab L.), soybean (Glycine max L.), sunn hemp (Crotalria juncea L.) and a sunn hemp and cowpea mixture (Vigna sinensis Endl.) to supply N and suppress weeds and, 3) to compare the effect on N availability and broccoli yield potential of incorporating cover crops with conventional tillage (CT) or mulching cover crops with no-tillage (NT) practices. Broccoli was grown during {{the third year of}} organic transition in the spring and fall of 2006 at the Kentland Agricultural Research Farm in Blacksburg, VA. Supplemental N significantly increased broccoli yield up until 112 kg ha- 1 with a quadratic correlation with leaf N. The NT treatment yielded no difference during the spring, but in the fall CT surpassed NT. On the other hand, N uptake, measured by leaf N, under NT conditions increased with supplemental N, which suggests NT has equivalent yield potential as CT when N is not limiting. Yields from leguminous iii residues did not differ, even though quality and quantity of cover crop biomass did. This suggests that N availability from cover crop legumes may be impacted other ecological process such as soil microbial activity. Also, cover crop residues differed in their ability to suppress weeds. The results from this study give organic growers in transition tools to maximize productivity and sustainability. i...|$|R

40|$|The {{continuous}} similarity {{model of}} evaporation is described. In it, evaporation is conceptualized as a two stage process. For an initially moist soil, evaporation is first climate limited, but later it becomes soil limited. During the latter stage, the evaporation rate is termed evaporability, and mathematically it is {{inversely proportional to}} the evaporation deficit. A functional approximation of the moisture distribution within the soil column is {{also included in the}} model. The model was tested using data from four experiments conducted near Phoenix, Arizona; and there was excellent agreement between the simulated and observed evaporation. The model also predicted the time of <b>transition</b> to the <b>soil</b> limited stage reasonably well. For one of the experiments, a third stage of evaporation, when vapor diffusion predominates, was observed. The occurrence of this stage was related to the decrease in moisture at the surface of the soil. The continuous similarity model does not account for vapor flow.

40|$|Accelerated erosion poses several {{problems}} for soil classification. Removal of surface soil {{can result in}} the thinning or removal of a mollic epipedon and can alter the clay distribution, an essential feature, of an argillic horizon. Erosional processes and soil properties vary across the landscape. This study examines the distribution of clay, total phosphorus, organic carbon, pH, clay mineralogy, and soil micromorphology in a small, first-order loess watershed. Twenty pedons from five different hillslope elements were used to study the relationship between soil properties, landscape position, and erosion;Soils on the summit and shoulder positions are similar in their clay, total phosphorus, organic carbon, and pH distributions. Shoulder soils are slightly more eroded than soils on the summit. Clay distributions on both positions are marginal to the argillic requirement. Thin section analysis, however, shows sufficient illuvial clay to meet the argillic criteria. Total phosphorus distributions resemble curves for forest or <b>transition</b> <b>soils.</b> Summit and shoulder soils are best classified as eroded Alfisols;Backslope soils display little profile development. Clay maximums and total phosphorus minimums occur at the surface. Illuvial clay is not evident in thin section. Accelerated erosion has truncated at significant portion of these soils. Evidence suggests that soils on the backslope were Inceptisols prior to cultivation;Footslope soils {{are a result of}} cumulic additions. A well-defined zone of phosphorus depletion exists in these soils. The organic carbon content in the footslope soils varies with aspect within the watershed. These soils are Mollisols;Toeslope soils are composed predominantly of post-cultural erosion sediments and inherit their properties from this material. Lighter colored sediments at the soil surface place these soils in the Entisol order;Clay mineralogy is consistent between landscape positions. Smectite content increases with depth while hydroxy interlayer minerals have a maximum in the surface and decrease with depth.

40|$|Microbial {{activity}} {{is known to}} continue {{during the winter months}} in cold alpine and Arctic soils often resulting in high microbial biomass. Complex soil nutrient dynamics characterize the <b>transition</b> when <b>soil</b> temperatures approach and exceed 0 °C in spring. At the time of this <b>transition</b> in alphine <b>soils</b> microbial biomass declines dramatically together with soil pools of available nutrients. This pattern of change characterizes alpine soils at the winter–spring transition but whether a similar pattern occurs in Arctic soils, which are colder, is unclear. In this study amounts of microbial biomass and the availability of carbon (C), nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) for microbial and plant growth in wet peaty soils of an Arctic sedge meadow have been determined across the winter–spring boundary. The objective was to determine the likely causes of the decline in microbial biomass in relation to temperature change and nutrient availability. The pattern of soil temperature at depths of 5 – 15 cm can be divided into three phases: below 10 °C in late winter, from 7 to 0 °C for 7 weeks during a period of freeze–thaw cycles and above 0 °C in early spring. Peak microbial biomass and nutrient availability occurred early in the freeze–thaw phase. Subsequently, a steady decrease in inorganic N occurred, so that when soil temperatures rose above 0 °C, pools of inorganic nutrients in soils were very low. In contrast, amounts of microbial C and soluble organic C and N remained high {{until the end of the}} period of freeze–thaw cycles, when a sudden collapse occurred in soluble organic C and N and in phosphatase activity, followed by a crash in microbial biomass just prior to soil temperatures rising consistently above 0 °C.

40|$|Abstract:- Constitutive {{models of}} {{partially}} saturated soils {{have been widely}} used in geotechnical engineering. Most of these models depend on complicated parameters; among them, soil suction is the most important one. However, the equipment and level of expertise required for determination of this parameter during a test procedure is beyond the capabilities of most of geotechnical laboratories. Thus, a behaviour model independent of soil suction may be very interested instead of such complicated laboratory measurements. In this research, a new behaviour model of partly saturated soils is presented. This model is constructed based on a series of collected data from different authors and validated with their experimental results. Employing a dramatic and continuous <b>transition</b> of <b>soil</b> strengths from a fully saturated to fully dry condition is the base of this model. Soil parameters which were used in this approach are moisture content, plasticity indices, saturated-drained internal friction angle and unconfined compressive strength of soil in dry and hardened states.

Three knowledge discovery methods are discussed next for extracting knowledge from data sources. The methods were designed to maintain information for modeling the uncertainties associated with class assignments when using the extracted knowledge for classification.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} the activity of dehydrogenases and urease in forest peat soils of different fertility. There were selected 23 experimental plots localised in central and northern Poland. The research was conducted on forest fens, transition bogs and raised bogs. The biggest differences in soil physical and chemical properties were detected between fen and raised bog soils while raised bog <b>soils</b> and <b>transition</b> bog <b>soils</b> differed the least. Statistically significant differences between particular subtypes of peat soils were observed for soil pH-H 2 O, pH-KCl, C/N ratio as well as the content of organic carbon, nitrogen, calcium and potassium. The highest average dehydrogenase activity in the soil surface level was observed in fen soils, and the lowest – in raised bogs soils. The results obtained on urease activity were similar. Differences in urease activity in the studied soil types were shown. Dehydrogenase activity did not reveal statistically significant diversity. The activity of urease was negatively correlated with the content of carbon, C/N ratio, hydrolytic acidity and moisture. Also the increase in enzymatic activity accompanied by the increase in pH has been observed. Przemysław Szmi...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The aircraft-based ESTAR soil {{moisture}} fields from the Southern Great Plains 1997 (SGP 97) Hydrology Experiment are {{compared to the}} simulated ones obtained by Bertoldi et al. [1] with the GEOtop model [2], with a particular focus on their capability in capturing the critical point behaviour in their space-time dynamics (see [3]). The critical point behaviour should denote the <b>transition</b> of <b>soil</b> moisture spatial patterns from an unorganized to organized appearance, as conditions become wetter. The study region is the Little Washita watershed, located in the southwest Oklahoma, in the Southern Great Plains region of the USA. The case study takes place from June 27 to July 16 and encompasses wetting and drying cycles allowing for exploring the behaviour under transient conditions. Results show that the critical probability value is 0. 85 for GEOtop, and 0. 80 for ESTAR. The GEOtop patterns appear more fragmented, being more reluctant to organization, as confirmed by the higher value of critical probability. Such behaviour is probably inherited by the model’s parameterization: land use and soil classes impose additional spatial structures to those related to the meteorological forcings and the hillslope morphology, driving to higher degrees of heterogeneity.

40|$|AbstractUnderstanding {{the soil}} {{freezing}} and thawing processes of temperate desert ecosystem on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, especially considering that soil freezing and thawing is {{very sensitive to}} climate changes. Little changes of soil freezing or thawing may lead to changes in water and heat <b>transition</b> in <b>soils</b> and thus affect the structure and function of ecosystems. SHAW, as a physically based, Land-surface model, provides {{a useful tool for}} understanding and analyzing soil freezing and thawing processes. In this paper, using the measured data of temperate desert ecosystem in Dachaidan assessed the model performance in simulating soil freezing and thawing processes. Comparison of the simulated results by SHAW to the measured data showed that in the initial stage of freezing the simulated frozen depth was thinner than the measured; in the thawing period the simulated thawing rate was higher than the measured due to the overestimated soil temperature below 10 cm; however, for the most cold stage (the stable frozen stage), the simulated matched quite well with the measured. For the maximum frozen depth the simulation only overestimated by as much as 4 %. On the whole, the SHAW model performed satisfactorily. This provides a good base for further application of LSMs to the temperate desert ecosystem on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau...|$|R
40|$|Global {{economic}} change and policy interventions are driving transitions from long-fallow swidden (LFS) systems to alternative land uses in Southeast Asia’s uplands. This study presents a systematic review {{of how these}} transitions impact upon livelihoods and ecosystem services in the region. Over 17 000 studies published between 1950 and 2015 were narrowed, based on relevance and quality, to 93 studies for further analysis. Our analysis of land-use transitions from swidden to intensified cropping systems showed several outcomes: more households had increased overall income, but these benefits came at significant cost such as reductions of customary practice, socio-economic wellbeing, livelihood options, and staple yields. Examining the effects of <b>transitions</b> on <b>soil</b> properties revealed negative impacts on soil organic carbon, cation-exchange capacity, and aboveground carbon. Taken together, the proximate and underlying drivers of the transitions from LFS to alternative land uses, especially intensified perennial and annual cash cropping, led to significant declines in pre-existing livelihood security and the ecosystem services supporting this security. Our results suggest that policies imposing land-use transitions on upland farmers so as to improve livelihoods and environments have been misguided; {{in the context of}} varied land uses, swidden agriculture can support livelihoods and ecosystem services that will help buffer the impacts of climate change in Southeast Asia...|$|R
40|$|Quantifying carbon (C) {{pools in}} subalpine systems is an {{important}} first step to understanding the effects of climatic variability on terrestrial C dynamics in temperate mountainous regions. We quantified C and other soil characteristics for tree islands and the vegetatively distinct meadows surrounding the tree islands at three subalpine sites (Thornton Lakes, Heather Pass, and Harts Pass) in the North Cascade Range, Washington, USA. O-horizon C storage ranged from 0. 6 to 2. 6 kg m- 2 in meadows and from 3. 1 to 5. 8 kg m- 2 in tree islands. Gradual vegetative <b>transitions</b> and similar <b>soil</b> depths result in similar quantities of mineral soil C in meadows and tree islands at Thornton Lakes (8. 1 vs. 8. 3 kg m- 2) and Heather Pass (7. 9 vs. 10. 3 kg m- 2). Abrupt vegetative <b>transitions</b> and deeper <b>soils</b> may allow more mineral-soil C to be stored in meadows than tree islands at Harts Pass (14. 1 vs. 7. 2 kg m- 2), although these mean values are not significantly different due to high variability in soil profile properties. Mean C concentrations in mineral soil horizons have no consistent relationship with vegetation type (tree island vs. meadow). Total ecosystem C storage is higher in tree islands (range, 35. 1 to 98. 5 kg m- 2) than meadows (range, 7. 4 to 18. 0 kg m- 2), primarily due to large amounts of C in the aboveground biomass of trees. Consequently, the effects of future climatic variability on C storage in subalpine ecosystems will largely depend on the degree to which conditions that limit tree island expansion (winter snowpack, summer drought) are affected.

40|$|Soil {{liquefaction}} {{describes a}} loss of strength of saturated sand upon sudden or cyclic loading. A slight disturbance of such a soil’s fabric might lead to severe damage, e. g. the collapse of sea dikes. Accurate modeling of the state <b>transition</b> between saturated <b>soil</b> and a liquefied soil-water mixture, as well as post-liquefaction phenomena, is crucial for the prediction of such damage. However, developing an appropriate numerical model remains a challenging problem, especially when the simulation involves dynamic large deformation processes. In {{order to make a}} first step towards an accurate simulation of soil liquefaction, a two-phase formulation of the finite element method (FEM) in conjunction with the elastoplastic UBC 3 D-PLM model is investigated. The performance of this approach is analyzed based on a shaking table benchmark. Numerical Analysi...|$|R
