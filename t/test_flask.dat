It was observed that the respiration rate was highest in the water discharged from an ecosystem that included symbiotic Tubificidae and microbes and was lowest in distilled water.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Boston UniversityPrien and Walker^ 39 {{have treated}} chronic kidney stone formers with aspirin. They {{obtained}} clinical evidence showing no new stone growth and inhibition {{of the growth}} of existing stones. The rationale behind such therapy is that aspirin is excreted as a glucuronide conjugate in the urine, and the glucuronide increases dissolution of calcium phosphate stones. Previous laboratory studies^ 39, 10 have shown glucuronides (a concentrate of mixed urinary glucuronides, or o-aminophenol glucuronide) to increase the dissolution of tricalcium phosphate. Tricalcium phosphate is neither a major nor even common component of urinary calculi. The purpose of this investigation is to demonstrate the effect of a glucuronide of salicylates on the dissolution of urinary calculi and their major component compounds. The diffuse pharmacological action of salicylates makes critical, in vitro experiments imperative. The ether glucuronide conjugate of salicylic acid, o-carboxyphenyl-β-D-glucopyranosiduronic acid (o-CPG), a known metabolic product of salicylates found in urine^ 40 and stones of known composition or synthetic components of stones should be used in these experiments. In the course of this investigation evidence of increased dissolution warranted further experimentation into the possible cause of such effects. Aspirin therapy as initiated by Prien and Walker derived from the qualitative experiments of Neuberg, Mandl and Grauer^ 33, 29, 30. In these experiments the authors attempted to either dissolve calcium salts or to inhibit their precipitation by addition of naturally occurring organic and inorganic acids. They showed that 1 -menthol-Dglucuronic acid solubilizes both calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate salts, that it functions in this way much better than non conjugated glucuronic acid and that incubation of such a mixture with β-glucuronidase leads to precipitation of the salt. The work of Cessi^ 10 followed in which the solubilizing effect of a glucuronide was observed during the synthesis of the glucuronide by an in vitro biological system. p^ 32 in the supernatant fluid resulting from dissolution of a solid phase of tricalcium phosphate containing p^ 32 (placed in the flask with the liver slices) was measured by counting the activity. The increase of p^ 32 over a control flask was found to vary directly with the glucuronide concentration. Salicylates {{have been shown to be}} excreted as the phenolic glucuronide ^ 40, 25, 2. Smith^ 42 has shown that acetylsalicylic acid is probably hydrolyzed in plasma to form salicylic acid. An increase of urinary glucuronides could then be made to occur by the ingestion of various "glucurongenins" (Teague). Prien and Walker^ 39 have reported an increase of 200 - 400 per cent over the basal level of urinary glucuronides in man during a 2 gm dose of aspirin / day. Glucuronides are manufactured largely by the liver, kidney and mucosa of the alimentary tract^ 15, 23, 24. The biosynthesis requires a coenzyme, uridine diphosphate which is thought to react with glucose to produce uridine diphosphoglucose which then may be oxidized to uridine diphosphoglucuronic acid in the presence of DPN^+ 45. The uridine diphosphoglucuronic acid will then transfer the glucuronic acid to a proper acceptor such as a phenol. The role of ingested glucuronic acid in this metabolic scheme seems to be negligible. Only a small percentage is recovered in the urine^ 20. Douglas and King using labeled glucurone found the glucuronic acid in the urine to be labeled in such a way as to support the theory that the glucurone breaks to three-carbon fragments. These fragments probably form a six-carbon precursor of glucuronic acid. Urinary tract calculi have been shown by Prien^ 37 to contain calcium in 90 per cent of 1000 calculi studied. Thirty-three per cent were pure calcium oxalate, 3. 4 per cent pure hydroxy apatite and 34 per cent were mixtures of calcium oxalate and hydroxy apatite. Hydroxy apatite is considered to be the main inorganic component of animal bone. The chemical structure of a unit cell is Ca 10 (PO 4) 6 (OH) 2 ^ 34, 9, 4. This crystal is the most common phosphate crystal found in urinary calculi. It is this component of urinary calculi with which this investigation is mainly concerned. EXPERIMENTAL The first series of experiments were designed to find the effect of o-CPG on the dissolution of a urinary tract stone composed chiefly of hydroxy apatite. The degree of dissolution was followed with phosphate determinations, using the colorometric procedure of Fiske and Subbarow. ^ 21 Since uric acid, salicylic acid, salicyluric acid and o-CPG are all found in the urine in increased amounts following ingestion of salicylates, these compounds were examined for their dissolutive effect. The <b>test</b> <b>flask</b> contained 100 mg of a powdered urinary stone composed mainly of hydroxy apatite, and 0. 1 mMoles of the test compound. The mixture was placed in a small dialysis bag along with 4 - 5 glass beads and 10 ml of buffer. This bag was placed in a 50 ml Erlenmeyer flask containing 30 ml of the buffer and a few glass beads. Several drops of toluene were added to prevent bacterial contamination. The buffer used was Michaelis universal veronal buffer, pH 7. 8. This pH was chosen because Prien and Walker^ 39 had found it to be optimal for dissolution of calcium phosphate in their early experiments. The o-CPG was synthesized in this laboratory using the method of Lunsford and Murphey. ^ 28 The flasks were placed in a shaking water bath at 38 °C. and aliquots of the external phase in the flasks were analysed at 5 hours and 10 hours. Duplicate flasks were set up for each substance in question and for the control flask which contained hydroxy apatite only. At the end of 5 hours the o-CPG flask showed an increase in the phosphate concentration of 85 per cent over the control. The other substances showed little or no increase. After 10 hours the o-CPG showed an increase of 36 per cent over the control. We conclude that o-CPG increases the dissolution of urinary tract calculi composed mainly of hydroxy apatite. Furthermore, it is suggested from the decreasing per cent of increased dissolution over time that the o-CPG also hastens the equilibrium of dissolution. The experiment was repeated substituting synthetic hydroxy apatite, prepared in this laboratory, for the powdered stone. Estradiol glucuronide was examined as well as o-CPG. After 5. 75 hours both glucuronides increased dissolution; the estradiol glucuronide increased the dissolution by 87 per cent and in this case the o-CPG produced a 555 per cent increase. It can be concluded that o-CPG increases dissolution of hydroxy apatite and that it works better on pure hydroxy apatite than on other forms of calcium and phosphate. Other investigators^ 39, 10 have found an increase of about 40 per cent using calcium phosphate. The first possible explanation for these results, which occurred to us was that o-CPG was complexing calcium ion. In order to determine if complex formation with calcium were taking place, conductometric titrations were performed. The titration curves of sodium hydroxide and of calcium hydroxide with o-CPG, glucuronolactone and salicylic acid, were compared. If the sodium hydroxide titration fits well to the calcium hydroxide titration curve, one concludes that no highly conductive ions are produced and complex formation is absent. The results showed that there is a possibility that a slight amount of complex formation may have occurred with glucuronolactone but certainly not with salicylic acid or o-CPG. Further proof that no complexing of calcium was taking place was obtained by measuring conductivity of separate solutions of calcium lactate and o-CPG at different concentrations. They were then combined, each at one half their original concentration and the resultant conductivity compared with the theoretical conductivity which we calculated. Results show that the combined conductivity is about the same as the theoretical and therefore complex formation is absent. This type of experiment was repeated using calcium chloride instead of calcium lactate and the same results were obtained. The only conclusion we can draw is that o-CPG does not complex calcium. It was thought that perhaps o-CPG complexes calcium and phosphate together. To test this hypothesis another dissolution experiment was designed similar to the first ones reported. However, the o-CPG was incubated in one case with phosphate and in another case with barium and phosphate before being added to the synthetic hydroxy apatite. The only <b>test</b> <b>flask</b> which showed a significant difference from the controls was that one in which o-CPG was incubated first with barium and phosphate. Here, the dissolution effect of o-CPG was decreased by 30 per cent. We conclude that calcium and phosphate may be complexed together by o-CPG. In summary we may state that o-CPG increases the dissolution of urinary tract calculi containing hydroxy apatite; it increases the dissolution of synthetic hydroxy apatite; it does not form a complex with calcium but it may form a complex with calcium and phosphate. The results also suggest that it may increase the dissolution of hydroxy apatite by acting at the surface of the crystal. This question requires further investigation...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Process Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. Surfactants are {{compounds}} that reduce interfacial surface tension, resulting in detergency, emulsifying, foaming and dispersing properties. Surfactants produced via biochemical processes (biosurfactants) form a niche market with their low toxicity, biodegradability and high specificity attributes. Biosurfactants have recently received considerable attention owing to their potential as biomedical molecules. In this study a knowledge base was {{established for the}} development of a process which produces biosurfactants for use as antimicrobial agents. Specifically, rhamnolipid biosurfactants were produced from Pseudomonas aeruginosa and tested for antimicrobial activity against target organisms. Accurate and reproducible analyses for the quantification of rhamnolipids and antimicrobial activity were developed. The amount of rhamnolipid was determined indirectly by measuring the rhamnose concentration. A novel HPLC method as well as an orcinol colorimetric method were developed for rhamnose measurement. In order to obtain accuracy with the orcinol method it was found that samples must be extracted at least three times prior to the analysis. An examination of literature on rhamnolipid production showed that many studies used colorimetric methods without extraction. Antibacterial activity was quantified by zone clearing around wells of supernatant in soft agar containing the target organism Mycobacterium aurum. This target organism is especially important in a South African context, since it is used to indicate possible susceptibility of tuberculosis to antibiotics. This method was developed for antibacterial testing, after a standard disk diffusion method proved to be ineffective. Antifungal activity of rhamnolipids was evaluated against the fungus Botrytis cinerea, by growing a lawn of fungus on a plate and adding rhamnolipid. The factors influencing rhamnolipid production were studied by growing different Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains from the ATCC culture collection, namely ATCC 9027 and ATCC 27853 as well as a locally isolated strain under different media conditions. The initial focus was on production of biosurfactants in media containing glucose as substrate. Alkanes were subsequently investigated as an alternative substrate, since they are readily available in South Africa as byproducts from the petrochemical industry. The rhamnolipids produced from the culture collection strains were evaluated for their antibacterial activity against Mycobacterium aurum. A number of key factors were identified which were important {{for the development of}} a rhamnolipid production process. Of critical importance were the media conditions. Good production was achieved on glucose media containing a phosphate limitation, pH buffering around neutral pH and a high carbon concentration (2 % carbon). When Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027 was cultured on this medium (a minimal salts phosphate limited medium with a Tris buffer), it produced 1. 31 g/l rhamnose, equivalent to 4. 0 g/l rhamnolipid. This rhamnolipid concentration is 2. 7 -fold higher that of 1. 47 g/l reported in the literature with the same strain (cultured on a different phosphate limited medium The particular strain also proved to be a factor which influenced the yield of rhamnolipids. A rhamnose concentration of 0. 43 g/l was obtained with Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 grown on MSM+Tris medium, compared to 1. 31 g/l produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027 on the same medium. The most promising strain and medium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027 and MSM+Tris medium, were evaluated under controlled conditions in an instrumented bioreactor. Nearly double the rate of growth and production were obtained in the bioreactor, indicating that production time can be shortened considerably under controlled conditions. However, when compared to shake flask studies, only a 4 % increase in growth and a 5 % increase in rhamnolipid production were achieved in the bioreactor, indicating that the yield was limited by the media components or process conditions. With media containing hexadecane as sole carbon source, negligible rhamnolipid production was achieved. Slow growth was observed and the stationary phase had not been reached even after 2 weeks of growth. It was shown that in glucose media rhamnolipid production only commenced in the stationary phase. Since the stationary phase was not reached during growth on hexadecane, rhamnolipids, which are known to increase the availability of alkanes through emulsification and solubilisation, could not be produced. A strategy was devised to accelerate growth on alkane media. A dual substrate medium containing both glucose and hexadecane was investigated. It was hypothesised that growth would be promoted by glucose leading to rhamnolipid production, which would then increase the uptake of hexadecane. Rhamnolipid was produced in the dual substrate experiments, but the hexadecane uptake was still poor. This was suggested to be due to the exposure of the cells to glucose in the inoculum or <b>test</b> <b>flask,</b> which hampered the ability of the cells to utilise hexadecane. It was reasoned that the ability to utilise hexadecane was determined by the cell hydrophobicity, which was influenced by the exposure to hydrophilic or hydrophobic substrates. Rhamnolipids from Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027 and ATCC 27853 were shown to have antibacterial activity against Mycobacterium aurum. The largest zone of clearing of 45 mm was obtained with 4 g/l rhamnolipid from Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027. The activity was shown to be directly related to the rhamnolipid concentration, highlighting the importance of maximising the biosurfactant yield when developing a process for the production of rhamnolipids as antimicrobial agents. Antifungal activity tests against Botrytis cinerea were inconclusive. Future studies should expand the antimicrobial application of rhamnolipids by testing their activity against a larger range of target organisms. In order to maximise the rhamnolipid yield in future studies, a fed batch process is proposed which would increase the cell density thereby increasing rhamnolipid production and prolonging the stationary phase, which was found to be the phase associated with rhamnolipid production. Different feeding strategies should be investigated, depending on the kinetics of substrate consumption. It is desirable to feed the smallest volume of substrate that is necessary with a high concentration in order to keep the dilution rate low and maximise the product concentration. A factorial design is recommended for this purpose. Further studies with alkanes as carbon source should be conducted using strains that have been maintained and cultured on media containing alkanes as sole carbon source. Alternative biosurfactant producing strains should also be investigated, which have higher natural cell hydrophobicities...|$|E

In these tests, both of unmodified PES membrane and AgNPs-AAm-PES membrane were exposed to pure culture suspension of Escherichia coli (E. Coli) bacteria with the concentration of 107 CFU/ml. The viable bacteria formed within the membrane surfaces and themembrane circumferences were observed by the halo zone formation, while the percentage of bacteria killing ratio was determined by shaking <b>flask</b> <b>test</b> method. The TEM {{results showed that the}} silver nanoparticles were formed within grafted layers of AAm-PES membrane and the size of silver nanoparticleswere about 10 nm. The AgNPs-AAm-PES membrane were highly effective to prevent the membrane biofouling as shown by the clearly halo zone formation compared with the unmodified PES membrane. The shake <b>flask</b> <b>test</b> were also revealed that almost 99. 9 percent of the E. coli bacteria were killed when theyhaving exposed to the AgNPs-AAm-PES membrane. This was due to the silver ions are allowed to release from its membrane surfac...|$|R
30|$|The {{inoculum}} {{was prepared}} by dispensing 250 mL of Kühl medium in 500 -mL Erlenmeyer flasks and then sterilized in an autoclave at 121 °C and 1.5 atm. for 20 min. After cooling, the Erlenmeyer flasks were inoculated by one loop of 7 -day-old cultures (160 mg/ 100 mL algal suspension for both tested green algae and chlorophyll (a + b) 6.33 and 6.45 μg/mL for C. vulgaris and S. obliquus suspension, respectively). The culture flasks were aerated by air pumps and incubated at 25 ± 1 °C under continuous illumination provided from daylight fluorescent tubes (80 μmol photon·m− 2 ·s− 1). The {{growth of the}} inoculum was assessed at 560 nm to adjust the number of cells to 2 × 105 cell·mL− 1. One-liter flasks were used as growth vessels, in which 600 mL of medium was poured and inoculated with different concentrations of treated soluble product of wheat bran (v/v) or pure glucose with the same concentration of soluble product, and then pH of the medium was adjusted at 6.8. The obtained culture medium was sterilized and then inoculated with 20 % (v/v) of exponentially growing inocula. Growth vessels were bubbled with air pumps and incubated at 25 ± 1 °C for 10 days under continuous illumination for mixotrophic conditions, and another set of <b>test</b> <b>flasks</b> was wrapped with aluminum foil to shade from the light for heterotrophic conditions. In each experiment, the growth curve, total protein, pigment, carbohydrate, and total lipid content were determined.|$|R

One of the goals was to provide sufficient amounts of the polysaccharide polymer to conduct a field test of its usefulness in subterranean permeability modification procedures of enhanced oil recovery. During September and October, 1994, fermentations and recoveries were done by Abbott Laboratories, to develop a process to provide at least 400 lbs of the glucan polymer for field <b>testing.</b> Shake <b>flask</b> runs and four fermentation runs were completed.

40|$|Petroleum {{hydrocarbons}} are a {{major source}} of marine contamination. Biodegradation, which is fundamental for the natural attenuation of these hydrocarbons in nature, involves mineralization or transformation of organic compounds by autochthonous microorganism communities. Various limiting factors characteristic of the petroleum, the external environment, and the microbial community determine the fate of oil (e. g., diesel) in the marine environment. Here, laboratory biodegradation experiments were conducted to investigate the aerobic biodegradation and chemical utilization of petroleum diesel hydrocarbons in seawater at four different temperatures: 15, 8, 4, and 0. 5 °C. Diesel, the sole carbon source, was immobilized on Fluortex adsorbents in closed-­‐bottle microcosms. Biological oxygen demand was monitored via respirometric measurements over a period of 64 days. Designated <b>test</b> <b>flasks</b> were removed from incubation at various times for extraction, bacterial sampling, or total organic carbon analysis. Chemical degradation of the individual diesel hydrocarbons was monitored via liquid-­‐liquid extraction in pentane, evaporation, and gas chromatography analysis. Based on chemical and bacterial analyses of diesel biodegradation, it was determined that incubation temperature affected petroleum diesel biodegradation. Rates of diesel biodegradation were enhanced at 15 °C and retarded at 0. 5 °C. According to calculated half-­‐life values for diesel hydrocarbon constituents, the rates of utilization were directly proportional to temperature and inversely proportional to hydrocarbon chain length. The method for chemical analysis caused significant evaporative losses of volatile hydrocarbon diesel fractions (64 %). For both biodegradation and chemical utilization, the final extent of degradation was not affected by temperature. Future research is recommended to better understand biodegradation in natural systems...|$|R
40|$|Under {{the premise}} of high energy price with {{estimated}} petroleum crisis, biodiesel extracted from plant oil, animal fat and microorganisms is considered as a promising replacement for fossil raw material. However, the increasing price of animal feeding and decreasing tillable land for oil plants have brought great difficulty to achieve biodiesel from feedstock plant oil and animal fat. In this study, four oleaginous yeasts including Lipomyces lipofer, Lipomyces starkeyi, Rhodotorula glutinis and Yarrowia lipolytica were compared for their lipid accumulating productivity in different carbon sources: glucose, xylose and a mixture of both glucose and xylose. According to the experimental results, Rhodotorula glutinis had the highest lipid yield in both glucose sole carbon source and mixed sugar in shake <b>flask</b> <b>test.</b> Lipomyces starkeyi was able to utilize xylose as sole carbon source to accumulate lipid with highest yield in shake <b>flask</b> <b>test.</b> In comparison with Lipomyces lipofer, Lipomyces starkeyi had higher lipid yield in both shake <b>flask</b> <b>test</b> and fermentation bioreactors. Yarrowia lipolytica could not utilize xylose sole carbon source and its lipid yield was the lowest one {{when compared to other}} three oleaginous yeasts. During fermentation in the bioreactor test, lipid content of Lipomyces lipofer showed a maximum, later the lipid content decreased. A similar peak of lipid content was observed in the fermentation test in bioreactor of Lipomyces starkeyi, but after a temporary decrease the lipid content increased again. Lipid content reached its highest amount at early stationary phase and decreased may be due to lipid remobilization...|$|R

40|$|Techniques are {{described}} whereby a culture medium can be conditioned by separation from a dense cell suspension either by a sinter or by a dialysis membrane. The enhanced growth promoting {{activity of the}} conditioned, as compared with new medium, is revealed by its removal from contact with the dense suspension and inoculation with stationary phase cells at or below the minimum effective density needed for cell growth. To obtain a conditioned medium of high activity, {{it is necessary to}} use an appropriate volume ratio of culture medium to conditioning cell suspension and to limit the conditioning period. Conditioning of the culture medium reduces, by comparison with new medium, the minimum effective cell density from approximately 12, 000 cells down to 500 - 1, 000 cells per ml. There thus exists a population dependent requirement which is not met by the conditioned medium as it is now prepared. Experiments indicate that this requirement may be met by volatile factors (possibly carbon dioxide) released by high cell density suspensions and which are lost in the transfer of conditioned medium to the <b>test</b> <b>flasks.</b> The retention of the activity of conditioned medium in various situations was studied as a preliminary to work on the chemical basis of conditioning. Results point to the release of amino acids and gibberellin as accounting for a part of the conditioning effect. Another factor is the rise in medium pH from 5. 2 to 6. 4. Conditioning is not considered to involve reduction of supra-optimal concentrations of medium constituents. An improved new synthetic medium, including these growth factors, lowers the minimum inoculum density from 12, 000 to 1, 000 - 2, 000 cells per ml. Suggestion are made as to how this medium might be further improved, leading to the ability to initiate cell divisions in cells present at very low densities in a medium of known composition...|$|R
40|$|We {{developed}} and evaluated a flask air sampling system for atmospheric trace gas observation on a cargo C- 130 H aircraft, {{as well as}} an automated analysis system for the flask samples, as part of a new operational monitoring program of the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA). Air samples were collected during each flight, between Kanagawa Prefecture (near Tokyo) and Minamitorishima (an island located nearly 2000 km southeast of Tokyo), from the air-conditioning system on the aircraft. The quality assurance <b>test</b> of the <b>flask</b> sampling air was made by specially coordinated flights at a low altitude of 1000 ft over Minamitorishima and comparing the flask values with those obtained at the surface. Based on our storage <b>tests,</b> the <b>flask</b> samples remained stable until analyses. The concentration measuring system for the flask samples has, in addition to the conventional sensors, two laser-based analyzers using wavelength-scanned cavity ring-down spectroscopy (WS-CRDS) and off-axis integrated cavity output spectroscopy (ICOS). Laboratory tests of the measuring system indicated relatively high reproducibility with overall precisions of less than 0. 06 ppm for CO 2 , 0. 68 ppb for CH 4 , 0. 36 ppb for CO, and 0. 03 ppb for N 2 O. Inter-comparison experiments for ambient air measurements showed excellent agreements between the laser-based measurement techniques and the conventional methods currently in use.

40|$|Shake <b>flask</b> <b>tests</b> were {{completed}} of microbial pyrite and HAP precursor removal from Rosebud subbituminous coal. Significant amounts of Ni, F, Mn, Cd, Co and Be {{were removed from}} this coal.

Although Hg was not removed from Pittsburgh coal by microbial attack, there was a correlation between HCl leaching of Hg from this coal {{and the extent of}} depyritization. Since HgS is soluble in HCl, the results suggest HgS is exposed by chemical and microbial dissolution of coal pyrite. Column tests with cleaned Indiana No. 5 coal are in progress and show significant early dissolution of Ni, Mn, Cd, Co and As. A final shake <b>flask</b> <b>test</b> with Kentucky No. 9 coal was begun.
