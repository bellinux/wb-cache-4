5|$|In general, {{winds are}} strongest {{immediately}} under the tropopause (except locally, during tornadoes, tropical cyclones or other anomalous situations). If two air masses of different temperatures or densities meet, the resulting pressure difference {{caused by the}} density difference (which ultimately causes wind) is highest within the <b>transition</b> <b>zone.</b> The wind does not flow directly from the hot to the cold area, but is deflected by the Coriolis effect and flows along the boundary of the two air masses.|$|E

There are at least 98 species of bird in the woodland, including the almost flightless malleefowl (Leipoa ocellata).|$|E
5|$|Folk {{music is}} {{sometimes}} divided into several spheres of geographic influence, a classification system of three regions, southern, central and northern, proposed by Alan Lomax in 1956 and often repeated. Additionally, Curt Sachs proposed {{the existence of}} two quite distinct kinds of folk music in Europe: continental and Mediterranean, and others have placed the <b>transition</b> <b>zone</b> from the former to the latter roughly in north-central Italy, approximately between Pesaro and La Spezia. The central, northern and southern parts of the peninsula each share certain musical characteristics, and are each distinct from the music of Sardinia.|$|E

30|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} {{that most of}} the reservoirs are mixed-wet like carbonate reservoirs, especially for the <b>transition</b> <b>zones</b> where wettability varies through the whole interval (Laroche et al. 1999). In order to implement the properties of mixed wet into reservoir modeling and simulation, sound representatives and validated capillary pressure and relative permeability correlations are required in the study of <b>transition</b> <b>zones</b> of carbonate reservoirs. Therefore, correlations of relative permeability and capillary pressure have been presented to understand the dynamic behaviors of <b>transition</b> <b>zones</b> of carbonate reservoirs in the present work. The correlations of capillary pressure and relative permeability have been studied based on Skjaeveland and Masalmeh models, respectively. The current approach of the work would be able to provide helpful information on capillary pressure and relative permeability correlations which are very important for <b>transition</b> <b>zones</b> of carbonate reservoirs.|$|R

5|$|Murray cod {{continue}} a pattern present in Murray-Darling native fish genera of speciation into lowland and specialist upland species: Murray cod are the primarily lowland species and the endangered trout cod are the specialist upland species. The pattern is slightly blurred in the cod species because, being adaptable and successful fish, Murray cod push significant distances into upland habitats, while the now endangered trout cod stray (or did stray, before their decline) well down the upland/lowland <b>transition</b> <b>zone,</b> {{which can be}} extensive in Murray-Darling Rivers. Nevertheless, the basic pattern of speciation into a primarily lowland species and a specialist upland species is present.|$|E
5|$|Oklahoma is in a humid {{subtropical}} region. Oklahoma {{lies in a}} <b>transition</b> <b>zone</b> between humid {{continental climate}} to the north, semi-arid climate to the west, and humid subtropical climate in the central, south and eastern portions of the state. Most of the state lies in an area known as Tornado Alley characterized by frequent interaction between cold, dry air from Canada, warm to hot, dry air from Mexico and the Southwestern U.S., and warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico. The interactions between these three contrasting air currents produces severe weather (severe thunderstorms, damaging thunderstorm winds, large hail and tornadoes) with a frequency virtually unseen anywhere else on planet Earth. An average 62 tornadoes strike the state per year—one of the highest rates in the world.|$|E

5|$|The {{evergreen}} {{forests in}} Wayanad mark the <b>transition</b> <b>zone</b> between {{the northern and}} southern ecologic regions of the Western Ghats. The southern ecologic regions are generally wetter and more species-rich. At lower elevations are the South Western Ghats moist deciduous forests, with Cullenia the characteristic tree genus, accompanied by teak, dipterocarps, and other trees. The moist forests transition to the drier South Deccan Plateau dry deciduous forests, which lie in its rain shadow to the east. Above 1,000 meters are the South Western Ghats montane rain forests, also cooler and wetter than the surrounding lowland forests, and dominated by evergreen trees, although some montane grasslands and stunted forests {{can be found at the}} highest elevations. The South Western Ghats montane rain forests are the most species-rich ecologic region in peninsular India; eighty percent of the flowering plant species of the entire Western Ghats range are found in this ecologic region.|$|E
5|$|This {{exception}} arises due to competing {{horizontal and}} vertical trends in the nuclear charge. Going along a period, the nuclear charge increases with atomic number as do the number of electrons. The additional pull on outer electrons as nuclear charge increases generally outweighs the screening effect of having more electrons. With some irregularities, atoms therefore become smaller, ionization energy increases, {{and there is a}} gradual change in character, across a period, from strongly metallic, to weakly metallic, to weakly nonmetallic, to strongly nonmetallic elements. Going down a main group, the effect of increasing nuclear charge is generally outweighed by the effect of additional electrons being further away from the nucleus. Atoms generally become larger, ionization energy falls, and metallic character increases. The net effect is that the location of the metal–nonmetal <b>transition</b> <b>zone</b> shifts to the right in going down a group, and analogous diagonal similarities are seen elsewhere in the periodic table, as noted.|$|E
5|$|As {{the first}} of these names indicates, the path was {{partially}} wooded, as its southern reaches crossed the <b>transition</b> <b>zone</b> between the western prairies and eastern woodland. From Fort Garry, southbound cart trains followed {{the eastern edge of the}} Red River's Great Plains, crossing the Roseau River and the international border. In Minnesota, the trail was joined by a route coming from Pembina to the northwest, and continued south on a level prairie in the former lakebed of prehistoric Lake Agassiz. It ascended to and followed a firm gravelly ridge which was once among the higher beaches or strandlines of that ancient lake, forded the Red Lake River at the Old Crossing near modern Huot, and angled south by southeast to the fur post at White Earth. At Otter Tail Lake, the route left the plains and turned east into a forest in the Leaf Mountains on the continental divide. Taking a difficult but scenic path east through the woods, the trail crossed the Mississippi River at Old Crow Wing. It then went south down the east bank of that river on a smooth and open glacial outwash sandplain to Sauk Rapids and East Saint Cloud.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. —This study {{uses the}} {{amphibian}} {{species of the}} Mediterranean basin to develop a consistent procedure based on fuzzy sets with which biogeographic regions and biotic <b>transition</b> <b>zones</b> can be objectively detected and reliably mapped. Biogeographical regionalizations are abstractions of the geographical organization of life on Earth that provide frameworks for cataloguing species and ecosystems, for answering basic questions in biogeography, evolutionary biology, and systematics, and for assessing priorities for conservation. On the other hand, limits between regions may form sharply defined boundaries along some parts of their borders, whereas elsewhere they may consist of broad <b>transition</b> <b>zones.</b> The fuzzy set approach provides a heuristic way to analyse {{the complexity of the}} biota within an area; significantly different regions are detectedwhosemutual limits are sometimes fuzzy, sometimes clearly crisp. Most of the regionalizations described in the literature for the Mediterranean biogeographical area present a certain degree of convergence when they are compared within the context of fuzzy interpretation, as many of the differences found between regionalizations are located in <b>transition</b> <b>zones,</b> according to our case study. Compared with other classification procedures based on fuzzy sets, the novelty of our method is that both fuzzy logic and statistics are used together in a synergy in order to avoid arbitrary decisions in the definition of biogeographic regions and <b>transition</b> <b>zones.</b> [Biodiversity; biological geography...|$|R

Based on analyses of a side-scan sonar mosaic, the 19. 4 -km 2 study area {{was comprised of}} six distinct large-scale (� km 2) benthoscape elements, with varying levels of mesoscale (km 2 –m 2) and small-scale (� m 2) physical and biological habitat heterogeneity. <b>Transition</b> <b>zones</b> among elements varied from � 50 to 200 m in width, comprised � 32 % of the benthoscape, and added to overall benthoscape heterogeneity. Population abundances of nine taxa varied significantly among the large-scale elements. Most species were found at high abundances only in one benthoscape element, but three had several foci of elevated abundances. Analyses of population responses to habitat heterogeneity at different spatial scales indicated that abundances of eight taxa varied significantly among spatial scales, but the significant scales were mixed among these species. Relatively large residual variations suggest significant amounts of mesoscale spatial variation were unaccounted for, varying from � 1 km 2 to several m 2. Responses to <b>transition</b> <b>zones</b> were mixed as well. Abundances of nine taxa varied significantly among <b>transition</b> <b>zones</b> and interiors of benthoscape elements, most with elevated abundances in <b>transition</b> <b>zones.</b> Our results show that infaunal populations exhibit complex and spatially varying patterns of abundance in relation to benthoscape structure and suggest that mesoscale variation may be particularly critical i...|$|R
