40|$|The thesis {{examines}} the claims {{that may be}} brought against express trustees for pecuniary compensation. It contends that a difference of principle divides this conventional category in two. Some compensation claims complain that the trustee has breached one of his duties and seek to charge him with reparation for whatever ensuing loss has been suffered by the beneficial interests. These claims resemble claims for damages founded upon a tort or breach of contract. Other compensation claims overlook whatever breach {{there may have been}} and demand that the <b>trustee</b> <b>account</b> and perform the trusts, in money where this cannot be done in specie. This second type of claim resembles a claim for the specific performance of a contract, bearing in mind that specific performance may be given with compensation where the defendant cannot deliver what he has promised. The claims are cumulative subject to the principle of full satisfaction...|$|E

50|$|In 1912, the Queensland {{government}} ceased giving {{subsidies to}} reserves for special improvements, although they still received the usual endowment of 7/6 in the pound on subscriptions and donations. This {{became a major}} concern to the Trustees of the Queen's Park Gardens and Recreation Reserve. During 1915, the Cooktown Town Council began to pay its grant to Queen's Park in small sums at irregular intervals - perhaps {{a response to the}} contingencies of the First World War, but more likely reflecting the general decline of Cooktown as a service and administrative centre and port. By January 1917, closure of the reserve was seen as unavoidable. Tenders were called for the lease of the cottage and gardens, or recreation reserve, or both, but none being received, action was taken to wind up the affairs of the Trustees. The gardener's cottage, bushhouse, windmill, garden stock and various implements were sold at auction and the <b>Trustees</b> <b>accounts</b> closed in June 1917. Cooktown Town Council retained trusteeship of the whole of the reserve, but the formal gardens and recreation grounds were not used again for public recreation until 1979. The quarrying of granite for street kerbing, from outcrops on the hill near Finch's Bay, probably dates to after 1917.|$|R

The confiscated books were returned to Hishon [...] "in a sack" [...] after the June 1921 truce ended the Anglo-Irish War, and he set about deciphering them.

[...] The provisional government established under the Anglo-Irish Treaty merged {{the institutions of the}} Irish Republic into those of the Dublin Castle administration into the new Irish Free State. On 16 April 1923, the Free State Chancery Division ordered the winding up of the Sinn Féin Bank company, appointing Donal O'Connor as liquidator. In August 1923 the court authorised O'Connor to auction off the Harcourt Street premises, which were [...] "almost derelict". (In March 1966 they were bought by Conradh na Gaeilge.) The court ruled in December 1923 that the 1921 winding-up resolution was invalid, and ordered Hishon to transfer the £815 balance to O'Connor. [...] The bank was dissolved by the High Court in March 1925 and its assets were liquidated. In April 1926, Dublin County Council, presented with a demand for £113 for damage caused by the DMP raids in 1919-21, voted 13-1 not to pay. The liquidation was completed by 1931 after proceedings costing £2,406 8s. 6d. The republican Dáil had deposited money with the bank and the Irish Free State, as its legal successor, received £1,198 10s. 9d. at the standard writedown of 50%, forgoing its preferential claim under the Dáil Éireann Loans and Funds Act, 1924. Other creditors received £2,620 7s. 0d. at the same rate. In 1933, the Free State voted £2,045 in public funds to repay creditors for the shortfall.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the empirical {{question of whether}} systematic equity risk of U. S. firms as measured by beta from the Capital Asset Pricing Model reflects the risk of their pension plans. There {{are a number of}} reasons to suspect that it might not. Chief among them is the opaque set of accounting rules used to report pension assets, liabilities, and expenses. Pension plan assets and liabilities are off-balance sheet, and are often viewed as segregated {{from the rest of the}} firm, with its own <b>trustees.</b> Pension <b>accounting</b> rules are complicated. Furthermore, the role of Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation further clouds the real relation between pension plan risk and firm equity risk. The empirical findings in this paper are consistent with the hypothesis that equity risk does reflect the risk of the firm’s pension plan despite arcane accounting rules for pensions. This finding is consistent with informational efficiency of the capital markets. It also has implications for corporate finance practice in the determination of the cost of capital for capital budgeting. Standard procedure uses de-leveraged equity return betas to infer the cost of capital for operating assets. They do not adjust the estimated beta for the risk of non-operating assets such as pensio...|$|R

Furthermore, the Goode Report on Pension Law Reform in 1993 stated the law to be that trustees [...] "are perfectly entitled to have a policy on ethical investment and to pursue that policy, so long as they treat the interests of the beneficiaries as paramount and the investment policy is consistent with the standards of care and prudence required by law."

We have implemented some different agents, having a set of tasks to delegate (or to perform by themselves); the tasks are performed by the agents in a dynamic environment, that can help or worse their activity. The agent rely upon different strategies in order to choose whom to delegate. We implemented three classes of trustiers: a random trustier (who randomly chooses the trustee whom delegate the task to); a statistical trustier (who builds the trustworthiness of other agents only {{on the basis of}} their previous performances); a cognitive trustier (who builds a sophisticated and cognitively motivated trust model of the <b>trustee,</b> taking into <b>account</b> its specific features, its ability and motivational disposition, and the impact of the environment on its performance).

The security and reliability of today’s backup authentication mechanisms have significant room for improvement. We designed, built, and tested a new authentication system that employs social-authentication. The system employs trustees previously appointed by the account holder to verify the account holder’s identity. We ran three experiments {{to determine whether the}} system could (1) reliably authenticate account holders, (2) resist email attacks that target <b>trustees</b> by impersonating <b>account</b> holders, and (3) resist phone-based attacks from individuals close to account holders. Results were encouraging: seventeen of the nineteen participants who made the effort to call trustees authenticated successfully. However, we also found that users must be reminded of who their trustees are. While email-based attacks were largely unsuccessful, stronger countermeasures will be required to counter highly-personalized phone-based attacks...|$|R

One {{of its first}} changes involved ensuring that all government institutions, which had previously been spread out in various areas throughout the country, were now based in Mogadishu, the nation's capital. The Central Bank of Somalia was also re-established, and a national plan {{as well as an}} effective anti-corruption commission were put into place. In July 2009, Somalia's Transitional Federal Government hired global professional services firm Pricewaterhousecoopers to monitor development funding and serving as a <b>trustee</b> of an <b>account</b> in Mogadishu for the security, healthcare and education sectors.

40|$|While {{physiological}} {{measures are}} increasingly {{used to help}} us understand the workings of interpersonal trust (and related behaviors), we know very little about the effects of such measures on trust. We examined the effects of a classic measure, the measurement of heart rate using a standard protocol, on behavioral trust in dyads of women who did not know each other. Behavioral trust was assessed in the trust game, in which the trustor decides how much money from their subject payment to give to a trustee, while knowing that the experimenter triples that amount before giving it to the trustee, after which the trustee decides how much money to return to the trustor. As predicted, we found greater levels of behavioral trust in the trust game, as well as greater returns by the <b>trustees</b> (which were <b>accounted</b> for by trustor's giving), in the heart rate (HR) than in no heart rate (NHR) measurement condition. Parallel findings were observed for self-reported trust. Findings are discussed in terms of the idea that the elusive effects of a protocol for measuring heart rate can cause pronounced effects on subsequent social interactions via enhanced interpersonal trust. © 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|Ethical {{investing}} in commercial activities {{is a topic}} which has received considerable attention of late. This {{has occurred in the}} areas of company law at all levels, with the concerns of consumers in relation to the production of products, and also in trust law, in particular superannuation trusts. Superannuation Trusts are of particular significance as they have become significant institutional investors in a number of substantial commercial activities. Ethical investment which requires the <b>trustees</b> to take <b>account</b> of issues other than financial when investing is seen to run counter to traditional trust law principles. Relevant issues relating to ethical {{investing in}}clude: human rights and labour concerns, environmental and moral issues such as investing in the alcohol and tobacco industries. This paper focusing upon superannuation law in the Australian and New Zealand jurisdictions considers the investment obligations of trustees in superannuation trusts. Such obligations closely resemble what may be referred to as traditional or core obligations of trustees. It acknowledges that difficulties arise when attempting to include ethical considerations in investment decisions with trust property. Having acknowledged this, the paper in upholding the place of ethical investing in the current environment proceeds to outline a means by which ethical investing can be adopted without compromising the position of trustees in any manner and which still focuses upon the best financial interests of the beneficiaries...|$|R

It has became a big issue {{that we can see}} through newspapers and mass media giving information about millions of ringgit of unclaimed estates and kept at the Department of National <b>Accounts,</b> <b>Trustees,</b> Employees Provident Fund (EPF) and others. Nowadays, the estate or assets that were frozen due to failures of beneficiaries to claim the funds including savings in the EPF, the savings and cooperative banks, vehicles, property such as houses and buildings, unit trusts, insurance and Takaful, investment in shares companies, trusts, intellectual property, royalties and more. At the preliminary stages, the researcher has come out with two objectives, firstly to examine the implications of the undistributed estate to the Estates Distribution Unit and secondly to examine the implications of the undistributed estate to the beneficiaries. The researcher has chosen the South Johor Estates Distribution Unit, Department of Lands and Minerals as the case study because this research is focusing on the small estate management for movable and immovable property with values not exceeding RM 2 million. To achieve these objectives, the researcher had conducted interviews with the officers of South Johor Estates Distribution Unit. This study was also conducted by distributing questionnaires to respondents from beneficiaries, those who deal at the case study and the public and this also includes respondents among the officers and supporting staff in the department. Data was analyzed using SPSS version 17. 0 by using the Likert scaling analysis, frequency analysis and cross tabulation analysis. The results have shown that there was a large implication from the undistributed estate to the South Johor Estates Distribution Unit, Department of Lands and Minerals and the beneficiaries of the estates. It is hoped that these findings can be used as an assessment, reference and a guideline in terms of enforcement of law in addressing this issue. Furthermore, it will also confer benefits to the parties involved. At the end of the study, suggestions have been submitted by the researcher...|$|R
