His unidentified illness has led to his physical deterioration, which makes him unrecognizable, and his aide-de-camp is constantly mistaken for the Liberator.|$|E

The player controls a weapon-equipped speedboat through 25 levels. Objectives include winning races, saving swimmers, and defusing bombs. The game also includes power-ups and is displayed from a 3D isometric perspective with automatic scrolling <b>that</b> <b>follows</b> <b>the</b> player's movement. The Stamper brothers designed {{the game and}} David Wise wrote its soundtrack. Computer and Video Games highly recommended the game and praised its graphics and gameplay. Later reviewers lauded its level diversity and noted its graphical similarities to previous Rare game R.C. Pro-Am. IGN and GamesRadar ranked Cobra Triangle among their top NES games. The latter considered Cobra Triangle emblematic of the NES era's aesthetic. It was also included in Rare's 2015 Xbox One retrospective compilation, Rare Replay.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{north from}} Perry City, NY227 {{straddles}} the SchuylerTompkins county line, with the northbound lane in Tompkins County. After , NY227 turns northeastward, leaving {{the border and}} completely entering Tompkins County {{in the town of}} Ulysses. Here, directional signage along the route switches from east–west to north–south. The backdrop remains rural for another mile to an intersection with Mayo Road, where the land surrounding the highway begins to become more populated. NY227 continues its northeastern progression into the village of Trumansburg, initially passing the local golf course and intersecting with the eastern terminus of CR149 (Searsburg Road). The area around the road becomes primarily residential, a trend <b>that</b> <b>follows</b> <b>the</b> route to its northern end at a junction with NY96 (West Main Street) in downtown Trumansburg.|$|E
5|$|Continuing north, the {{trunkline}} {{passes through}} mixed agricultural and wood lands {{into the community}} of Lawton. M-40 follows Main Street through town and exits on a northwestern track towards the village of Paw Paw. M-40 crosses over I-94 and turns north into town running along Maple Lake. The highway crosses the narrow isthmus between the larger Maple Lake and the smaller Ackley Lake, passing through some small residential subdivisions as it leaves Paw Paw. Small farms dot the landscape as M-40 crosses M-43 {{in a rural area}} of the county on the way to Gobles. It is in this small city that the road crosses the Kal-Haven Trail State Park, a linear park <b>that</b> <b>follows</b> <b>the</b> former Kalamazoo and South Haven Railroad line. The rail line was converted into a rail trail and allows users to bike, hike or snowmobile between Kalamazoo and South Haven.|$|E

5|$|In the {{southern}} {{half of the}} village, the highway follows a zig-zag routing as it leaves Fayette Street at River Road {{before returning to the}} north at Washington Street one block to the east. While on Washington Street, the route passes over the Cayuga–Seneca Canal and enters the village's center, changing names to Virginia Street in the process. Not far to the north, NY96 heads into Waterloo's central business district, built up around the junction of Virginia and Main (US20 and NY5) Streets. Past Routes5 and20, NY96 continues north as a residential street to the village line, where the route turns to the west with a slight trend to the north. At this point, the scenery surrounding NY96 shifts from house-lined streets to rural countryside once again, an appearance <b>that</b> <b>follows</b> <b>the</b> road to the northwest through the town of Waterloo and across the county line.|$|E
5|$|New Brunswick Theological Seminary, {{which has}} its main campus in New Brunswick, New Jersey, was founded in 1784 and is the oldest {{independent}} Protestant seminary extant in the United States. It {{is one of two}} operated by the Reformed Church in America (RCA), a mainline Reformed Protestant denomination in Canada and the United States <b>that</b> <b>follows</b> <b>the</b> theological tradition and Christian practice of John Calvin. First established in New York City under the leadership of the Rev. John Henry Livingston, who instructed aspiring ministers in his home, the seminary established its presence in New Brunswick in 1810. Although a separate institution, the seminary's early development in New Brunswick was closely connected with that of Rutgers University (formerly Queen's College and Rutgers College) before establishing its own campus in the city in 1856. Since 1986, the seminary has offered classes at a satellite campus on the grounds of St. John's University in the Jamaica neighborhood of Queens, New York.|$|E
5|$|Otaku often {{participate}} in self-mocking through the production or interest in humor directed at their subculture. Anime and manga otaku {{are the subject}} of numerous self-critical works, such as Otaku no Video, which contains a live-interview mockumentary that pokes fun at the otaku subculture and includes Gainax's own staff as the interviewees. Other works depict otaku subculture less critically, such as Genshiken and Comic Party. A well-known novel-cum-manga-cum-anime is Welcome to the N.H.K., which focuses on the subcultures popular with otaku and highlights other social outcasts such as the hikikomori and NEETs. Works that focus on an otaku character include WataMote, the story of an unattractive and unsociable otome game otaku who exhibits delusions about her social status. Watamote is a self-mocking insight <b>that</b> <b>follows</b> <b>the</b> heroine's delusion and attempts to reform herself only by facing reality with comedic results on the path to popularity. An American documentary, Otaku Unite!, focuses on the American side of the otaku culture.|$|E

The protagonist is a young Marine, Staff Sergeant Avery Johnson, who also appears in the Halo video games. Upon release, the book was generally well received and became The New York Times bestseller in its first week. Critics pointed to the novel's success as a sign of the increasing importance of story in video games.|$|E
5|$|The freeway starts {{northeast}} of Benton Harbor at exit34 on I-94 in Benton Charter Township in Berrien County. At the trumpet interchange, I-196 runs north from I-94 and passes {{to the west}} of the Point O'Woods Golf & Country Club. US31 joins I-196 from the southwest and runs concurrently with I-196 as the freeway passes through farm fields in southwestern Michigan. The trunkline turns northwesterly near the Lake Michigan Hills Golf Course and crosses the Paw Paw River. Past the river, the freeway turns northeasterly and runs roughly parallel to the Lake Michigan shoreline several miles inland. At the community of Lake Michigan Beach, I-196/US31 meets the northern terminus of M-63 at exit7, and the LMCT joins the freeway for the first time. North of this interchange, the freeway parallels A-2, a county road <b>that</b> <b>follows</b> <b>the</b> Blue Star Highway, the former route of US31.|$|E
5|$|Though seldom life-threatening, the {{electric}} discharge of an Atlantic torpedo is quite severe {{and may be}} enough to knock a person unconscious. However, a greater danger to divers is the disorientation <b>that</b> <b>follows</b> <b>the</b> shock. The Atlantic torpedo is of no commercial value, as its meat is flabby and tasteless. It is caught incidentally by commercial and recreational fisheries in bottom trawls and on hook-and-line. When caught at sea, it is generally discarded or cut up for bait. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) does not yet have enough data to assess the Atlantic torpedo beyond Data Deficient; it could be negatively affected by fishing mortality, though specific data on catch rates and population trends are lacking, {{as well as by}} the degradation of coral reefs that are important to juveniles. Its slow reproductive rate would limit its capacity to recover from population depletion.|$|E
