40|$|The self-sputtering mode in {{high power}} pulsed {{magnetron}} discharges opens {{the possibility of}} generating plasma that contains mainly singly charged metal ions of the <b>target</b> (<b>cathode)</b> material. The main idea of a self-sputtering magnetron ion source is to utilize the dense plasma to extract ions from it and thus to form a beam of accelerated, purely singly charged metal ions. Such kind of metal ion source based on a planar magnetron {{has been reported in}} our previous, recent publication.

40|$|An {{analysis}} of main design parameters that determine {{a level of}} droplet formation intensity at the generating stage of plasma flow has been given in the paper. The paper considers {{the most widely used}} designs of water cooled consumable cathodes. Ti or Ti–Si and Fe–Cr alloys have been taken as a material for cathodes. The following calculated data: average ionic charge Z i for titanium plasma + 1. 6; for «titanium–silicon plasma» + 1. 2, an electronic discharge 1. 6022 ⋅ 10 – 19 C, an ion velocity v i   = 2 ⋅ 10 4 m/s, an effective volt energy equivalent of heat flow diverted in the cathode U к  = 12 V, temperature of erosion cathode surface Т п  = 550 К; temperature of the cooled cathode surface Т о  = 350 К have been accepted in order to determine dependence of a maximum admissible arc discharge current on cathode height. The calculations have been carried out for various values of the cathode heights h к  (from 0. 02 to 0. 05 m). Diameter of a <b>target</b> <b>cathode</b> is equal to 0. 08 m for a majority of technological plasma devices, therefore, the area of the erosion surface is S = 0. 005 m 2. A thickness selection for a consumable <b>target</b> <b>cathode</b> part in the vacuum arc plasma source has been justified in the paper. The thickness ensures formation of minimum drop phase in the plasma flow during arc cathode material evaporation. It has been shown that a maximum admissible current of an arc discharge is practically equal to the minimum current of stable arcing when thickness of the consumable cathode part is equal to 0. 05 m. The admissible discharge current can be rather significant and ensure high productivity during coating process with formation of relatively low amount of droplet phase in the coating at small values of h к. </p...|$|E
40|$|Magnetrons are plasma devices used in {{thin film}} {{processes}} and sputter etching. In a magnetron, crossed E and B fields confine a plasma {{to the surface}} of a <b>target</b> <b>cathode</b> which, through bombardment by unmagnetized ions in the plasma, is the source of sputtering emission. In this paper, a computational model for a circular, planar sputtering magnetron is developed, in which the bulk plasma behavior is modeled via the cloud-in-cell (CIC) method and the energetic ionizing electrons by direct simulation of discrete particles. The confined plasma in a sputtering magnetron allows for the propagation of waves; in particular, the interaction between acoustic waves travelling in the axial direction and energetic electrons is the focus of this study. These waves should transfer enough energy to electrons to allow them to escape confinement, resulting in a lower electron density in the confined plasma than previous models have predicted...|$|E

40|$|The present thesis {{addresses}} two research areas {{related to}} film growth {{in a highly}} ionized magnetron sputtering system: plasma characterization, and thin film growth and analysis. The deposition technique used is called high power pulsed magnetron sputtering (HPPMS). Characteristic for this technique are high energy pulses (a few Joules) of length 50 - 100 µs that are applied to the <b>target</b> (<b>cathode)</b> with a duty time of less than 1 % of the total pulse time. This results in a high electron density in the discharge (> 1 x 1019 m- 3) and leads to an increase of the ionization fraction of the sputtered material reaching up to 70 % for Cu. In this work the spatial and temporal evolution of the plasma parameters, including the electron energy distribution function (EEDF), the electron density and the electron temperature are determined using electrostatic Langmuir probes. Electron temperature measurements reveal a low effective temperature of 2 - 3 eV. The degree of ionization in the HPPMS discharge is explained {{in light of the}} self-sputtering yield of the target material. A simple model is therefore provided in order to compare the sputtering yield in HPPMS and that in dc magnetron sputtering (dcMS) for the same average power. Thin Ta films are grown using HPPMS and dcMS and their properties are studied. It is shown that enhanced microstructure and morphology of the deposited films is achieved by HPPMS. The Ta films are also deposited at a number of substrate inclination angles ranging from 0 o (i. e., facing the target surface) up to 180 o (i. e., facing away from the target). Deposition rate measurements performed at all inclination angles for both techniques, reveal that growth made using HPPMS resulted in an improved film thickness at higher inclination. Furthermore, the high ionization of the Ta atoms in HPPMS discharge is found to allow for phase tailoring of the deposited films at all inclination angles by applying a bias voltage to the substrate. Finally, highly ionized magnetron sputtering of a compound MAX-phase material (Ti 3 SiC 2) is performed, demonstrating that the HPPMS discharge could also be used to tailor the composition of the growing Ti-Si-C films.

40|$|In this work, {{two types}} of nano-structured TiO 2 layers were {{obtained}} by two different methods. First, during an exploratory study, a set of nano-columnar TiO 2 films and niobium doped TiO 2 films was obtained on stainless steel, by a RF reactive sputtering technique. The argon gas is ionized by a high negative voltage applied to the TiO 2 <b>target</b> (<b>cathode),</b> and a plasma is created between the cathode and the substrate (anode). Positively charged ions (Ar+) are accelerated toward the TiO 2 target (a co-target Nb is placed beside the TiO 2 cathode for Nb doping) and their impact sputters atoms off the target. These atoms travel across the chamber and a fraction of them land on stainless steel, resulting in a film TiO 2 and Nb-doped film TiO 2. With adjusting the RF power applied on the co – target, different concentrations of Nb in the TiO 2 film could be controlled. The results of EIS (Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy) mainly showed {{the presence of a}} barrier layer (junction metal/semiconductor or metal/oxide/semiconductor) between the TiO 2 layer and the stainless steel in the absence and presence of niobium. The carrier density is estimated at almost 1018 cm- 3. In the second part of this thesis, {{two types of}} TiO 2 nano-tubular arrays with nanotubes (NT) aligned perpendicular to the titanium substrate were obtained by anodization of a titanium foil, in two different solutions containing fluoride ions. The NT obtained in a tetrabutylammonium / formamide solution (named: TiO 2 -NT(TB)) are rough, while the second solution, ethylene glycol, allows to synthesize smoother and denser tubes (named: TiO 2 -NT(EG)). All the nanotubular arrays were characterized by EIS and showed in the high frequency range a contribution related to the presence of surface states, and a contribution at low frequencies related to the capacity of the space charge layer. In the dark, in the Na 2 SO 4 solution with neutral pH, the EIS study of TiO 2 -NT (TB) anatase showed that these two contributions vary with the applied potential. The capacity of surface states varied exponentially {{in a wide range of}} potential, but in addition the presence of a localized energy state in the gap could be evidenced. This localized state is the signature of the adsorption of molecular water. After UV exposure during 3 h, and back to the dark, the quasi irreversible disappearance of the localized energy states is related to photo-induced adsorbed water dissociation at some sites on the surface of NT. Furthermore, the increase by a factor 112 of the capacity of the space charge layer was observed after UV exposure. This increase can be explained by the photo activation of the surface of NT, which was inactive before UV exposure. This activation is related to the dissociation of adsorbed molecular water and the insertion of hydrogen into the walls of NT. A geometric model considering the variation of the band bending taking place inside the wall of NT is proposed to replace the classical Mott-Schottky relation, which is only valid for a plate condensator. This model allows understanding the variation of the space charge layer as a function of the applied potential. With this new model, a carrier density of about 1018 cm- 3 et 1020 cm- 3 respectively before and after UV illumination were determined, confirming that the photo-induced activation of the wall of NT is linked to the phenomenon of doping due to hydrogen insertion. In the case of TiO 2 –NT(EG), the contribution of adsorption of molecular water was not observed. The spectrum of EIS before and after UV exposure did not show a significant change and the capacities of space charge layer after illumination only increased by a factor 8. The simulation with the model shows that the carrier density is about 1020 cm- 3 before and after illumination. In other words, these tubes of TiO 2 –NT(EG), are already activated before illumination and the photo-induced effects are less important compared to the TiO 2 –NT(TB) array. For a better identification of the chemical nature of the surface state in the case of rough tubes of TiO 2 –NT(TB), EIS measurements were performed in the same manner, but in acidic (pH= 3. 5) and basic (pH= 12. 5) media, in order to compare the behaviour to that observed in the neutral Na 2 SO 4 solution. In the alkaline electrolyte, the band bending varies only slightly with the applied potential, reflecting a shift of band edge and the filling/emptying of the surface states during polarization. Moreover, the exponential distribution of capacities of surface states is more spread out (850 meV) in alkaline solution than in the neutral solution (257 meV), showing clearly the particular role of the OH groups at the surface of the tubes. In the acidic electrolyte, a phenomenon of diffusion –insertion of protons should be taken into account for interpreting the spectra of EIS. H atoms play the role of electron donors able to increase the carrier density in the wall of the tubes. The comparison between the behaviours in the 3 media clearly associates the surface states to hydroxyl groups. In the last part of this thesis, experiments were performed on TiO 2 –NT(TB) in a NaOH electrolyte, using Intensity Modulated Photocurrent Spectroscopy (IMPS), and the results are discussed in comparison with a thin compact film deposed on a titanium foil par PVD...|$|E

50|$|One {{downside}} of the arc evaporation process {{is that if}} the cathode spot stays at an evaporative point for too long it can eject a large amount of macro-particles or droplets. These droplets are detrimental to the performance of the coating as they are poorly adhered and can extend through the coating. Worse still if the <b>cathode</b> <b>target</b> material has a low melting point such as aluminium the cathode spot can evaporate through the target resulting in either the target backing plate material being evaporated or cooling water entering the chamber. Therefore, magnetic fields as mentioned previously are used to control the motion of the arc. If cylindrical cathodes are used the cathodes can also be rotated during deposition. By not allowing the cathode spot to remain in one position too long aluminium targets can be used and the number of droplets is reduced.

A sequence of additional optically transparent dielectric layers and optically transparent metal layers is deposited by the layer thicknesses formed as an interference layer system on the substrate surface. The layers in a layer plane structure is/are separated. An independent claim is included for a substrate with an optically transparent and electrically conductive metal layer...|$|R
30|$|To produce silver {{thin films}} {{magnetron}} sputtering method was used. A vacuum system with base pressure of 10 − 6  m bar was employed (Hind-High-Vacuum, H.H.V., 12 ″MSPT). For magnetron sputtering argon (purity 99.99 %) was used with pressure of 2 [*]×[*] 10 − 2  mbar. Circular glass with diameter of 2  cm and thickness of 1  mm was employed as substrate. Circular silver disc (purity 99.9 %) with thickness of 3  mm and 12.5  cm diameter {{was made and}} used as <b>cathode</b> (<b>target</b> for sputtering) and the substrate-to-target distance was fixed at 12  cm (optimum distance after many runs of discharge to obtain an uniform film and suitable coating rate). The deposition rate of 15  Å/S was obtained when plasma discharge current was 0.6  Amp and voltage was at 350  volts. The coating rate and Ag film thickness were measured using a vibrating quartz crystal thickness monitor. During Ag deposition on glass substrate temperature was checked and kept constant using an exact digital thermocouple (namely 300  k). The glass substrates were washed and cleaned in heated acetone ultrasonic bath for 3  min and were dried before deposition of silver.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{a variety}} of {{previous}} coating methods are reviewed for the film coating on the inner surface of long-straight tubes. A new magnetron sputtering method is introduced for the film coating in the thin and long tubes made by the conductive and non-magnetic material. The coating process of this method is as follow: the long rod <b>target</b> connecting the <b>cathode</b> is penetrated in center of the coated tube connecting the anode; a solenoid coil with DC exciting current is set outside of the tube so the steady axial magnetic field is generated in the ring discharge area between target and the tube; the working gas flows through the tube {{from one end to}} the other, the gas discharge and the magnetron sputtering coating occures in the region corresponding to the solenoid coil; the homogeneous film is obtained on the whole inner surface of the tube when the solenoid coil moves along the tube. The principle and structure of the coating system are analyzed. The distribution of electromagnetic field and electron trajectory in the electromagnetic field are calculated within the discharge region. And distribution of the magnetic field is simulated by COMSOL multiphysicsn software...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In this work, we mainly {{summarize}} {{the influence of}} the ion bombardment <b>cathode</b> (<b>target)</b> and relative factors of magnetron sputtering yield in production thin film. Magnetron sputter deposition permits a much wider selection of film materials, produces films with higher purity and better controlled composition, provides films with greater adhesive strength and homogeneity, and permits better control of deposit thickness. Unlike most other work described about sputtering yield, sputtering for thin-film production is performed using the plasma rather than a focused ion beam. When an ion with the energy hits a surface of the target, {{a small fraction of the}} energy and momentum of the incoming ion will, through lattice collisions, be reversed and may cause ejection of surface atoms (sputtering). The average number of the atoms ejected from the cathode surface per incident ion is called the sputtering yield. The sputtering yield varies with the target material, the kind of impinging ion, and the energy of that ion. At a given ion energy, The sputtering yield increases with increasing angle of incidence up to a maximum at an angle between 55 ° and 85 ° with respect to the surface normal [1, 3]...|$|R
40|$|In {{this work}} {{the results of}} the {{development}} of an electron source, based on the emission of free electrons from laser-induced plasmas. This source is a consequent enhancement of known plasma electron sources for the special application in X-ray tubes. By focusing intense ultra-fast Lasers to a solid target plasma is generated, expanding through a hollow dielectric pipe. Perpendicular to the propagation direction of the plasma, a fine-meshed grid covers an emission hole in the pipe. At this place, the electrons are emitted and accelerated towards an anode. Due to the emission of the electrons perpendicular to the propagation direction of the plasma, no ablated material is present in the space between emission hole and anode, whereby electrical discharges are avoided. Between the Laser <b>target</b> (the <b>cathode)</b> and the grid the plasma acts as a conductor. By applying a high-voltage of several kilovolts a discharge current flows through the plasma between cathode and grid. For suitable values of the mesh size, the voltage, the resistor and the geometry {{the main part of the}} discharge current is emitted through the grid towards the anode. Beside a detailed description of the known plasma-based electron sources (plasma hollow cathode and plasma edge cathode) and the related theory, the development of the laser-driven plasma electron source is described, followed by a characterization of the latter with regard to current rating and density in dependence of the process-determining parameters. Measuring the X-ray characteristics lead to the brightness of the electron beam. For appropriate parameters, stable and reproducible points of operation were attained with currents of free electrons of 1, 75 A. This corresponds to a current density of 2, 73 A/cm^ 2. For smaller emission areas current densities up to 5 A/cm^ 2 were measured at currents up to 1 A. The minor divergence of the electron beam had a brightness of 4, 5 x 10 ^ 8 A/m^ 2 /rad^ 2...|$|R
