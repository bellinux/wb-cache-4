5|$|The Kalika Purana narrates the {{following}} tale about Rati's birth. After {{the creation of}} the 10 Prajapatis, Brahma – the creator-god – creates Kama (Kamadeva), the god of love, from his mind. Kama is ordered to spread love in the world by shooting his flower-arrows and Prajapati Daksha is requested to present a wife to Kama. Kama first uses his arrows against Brahma and the Prajapatis, who are all incestuously attracted to Brahma's daughter Sandhya ("Twilight-dawn/dusk"). Shiva, who was passing by, watches them and laughs. Embarrassed, Brahma and the Prajapatis tremble and perspire. From <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> of Daksha rises a beautiful woman named Rati, who Daksha presents to Kama as his wife. At the same time, the agitated Brahma curses Kama to be burnt to ashes by Shiva in the future. However, on Kama's pleading, Brahma assures him that he would be reborn. The Brahma Vaivarta Purana narrates that Sandhya committed suicide, after Brahma lusts for her. God Vishnu resurrects her and names her Rati, and marries her to Kama. The Shiva Purana mentions that after her suicide Sandhya is reborn from <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> of Daksha as Rati. In some texts, the god Shiva is described as the father of Rati.|$|E
5|$|In 1965, Cade was {{approached}} by Dewayne Douglas, an assistant coach for the Florida Gators football team, about the extreme dehydration faced by Gator football players practicing in the high temperatures and humidity of the Deep South in late summer and early fall. Douglas questioned Cade why his football players did not urinate during practice and games. Cade learned from anecdotal evidence that football players were losing water through perspiration and failing to replace fluid during practice and games. Cade's research team discovered that football players were losing up to 18 pounds (8.2 kilograms) during the three hours of a college football game, and that ninety to ninety-five percent of that loss was water. A player's plasma volume could decrease as much as seven percent and blood volume by five percent, and sodium and chloride were excreted in <b>the</b> <b>sweat.</b>|$|E

5|$|Shirts are {{normally}} {{made of a}} polyester mesh, which does not trap <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> and body heat {{in the same way}} as a shirt made of a natural fibre. Most professional clubs have sponsors' logos on the front of their shirts, which can generate significant levels of income, and some also offer sponsors the chance to place their logos on the back of their shirts. Depending on local rules, there may be restrictions on how large these logos may be or on what logos may be displayed. Competitions such as the Premier League may also require players to wear patches on their sleeves depicting the logo of the competition. A player's number is usually printed on the back of the shirt, although international teams often also place numbers on the front, and professional teams generally print a player's surname above his number. The captain of each team is usually required to wear an elasticated armband around the left sleeve to identify him as the captain to the referee and supporters.|$|E
25|$|The protein spans this {{membrane}} {{and acts}} as a channel connecting the inner part of the cell (cytoplasm) to the surrounding fluid. This channel is primarily responsible for controlling the movement of halogens from inside to outside of the cell; however, in <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> ducts, it facilitates the movement of chloride from <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> duct into the cytoplasm. When the CFTR protein does not resorb ions in sweat ducts, chloride and thiocyanate released from sweat glands are trapped inside the ducts and pumped to the skin. Additionally hypothiocyanite, OSCN, cannot be produced by the immune defense system. Because chloride is negatively charged, this modifies the electrical potential {{inside and outside the}} cell that normally causes cations to cross into the cell. Sodium is the most common cation in the extracellular space. The excess chloride within sweat ducts prevents sodium resorption by epithelial sodium channels and the combination of sodium and chloride creates the salt, which is lost in high amounts in <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> of individuals with CF. This lost salt forms the basis for <b>the</b> <b>sweat</b> test.|$|E
25|$|Urea accumulates, {{leading to}} {{azotemia}} and ultimately uremia (symptoms ranging from lethargy to pericarditis and encephalopathy).

40|$|Sweating {{measurement}} is a {{very useful}} tool for the physiological health state of the human body. A sweating measuring system developed {{in this study was}} composed of several sensors. All sensors were calibrated to ensure the accuracy. Three pretreatment physiological states for test subjects before sweating measurement included sit and rest for 5 min, walking for 5 min, and running for 5 min. <b>The</b> whole <b>sweating</b> value was measured and calculated over 5 -min periods. <b>The</b> results of <b>sweating</b> measurement indicated <b>the</b> usefulness of this device. <b>The</b> <b>sweating</b> quantity of three states did not have a significant relationship with the height, weight and body mass index (BMI) values of subjects. <b>The</b> first <b>sweating</b> index is <b>the</b> difference between active treatment and sitting state. <b>The</b> second <b>sweating</b> index is <b>the</b> ratio between active state and sitting. The relationship between two sweating index and BMI values could be found. This device could serve as a detecting tool to establish <b>the</b> <b>sweating</b> database for normal conditions and to be used for diagnosis.
