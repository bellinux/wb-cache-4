25|$|Initially seen as underused and too costly, {{it is now}} {{considered}} a great success, heading for capacity with the growing uptake of rail commuting. Limitations on further patronage are primarily due to the access tunnel from the east which provides only two rail tracks, {{and the lack of}} a <b>through</b> <b>connection</b> via a rail link to the North Shore or to the Western line via an underground tunnel, which would change it into a through station.|$|E

25|$|Lightning {{protection}} systems {{are designed to}} mitigate the effects of lightning <b>through</b> <b>connection</b> to extensive grounding systems that provide a large surface area connection to earth. The large area is required to dissipate the high current of a lightning strike without damaging the system conductors by excess heat. Since lightning strikes are pulses of energy with very high frequency components, grounding systems for lightning protection tend to use short straight runs of conductors to reduce the self-inductance and skin effect.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{seen as an}} inferior, but {{cheaper and}} more {{politically}} acceptable alternative to the CRL tunnel, the duplicate eastern approach also gained favour as a stop gap implementation due to the comparatively short build time. Even if planning had commenced immediately, the CRL might not have become operational until several years after the maximum capacity of the existing corridor was reached. Moreover, while seen {{as an alternative to}} the CRL <b>through</b> <b>connection</b> tunnel, the duplicate eastern tunnel would not have precluded it from being built.|$|E
25|$|The South Station Expansion Project {{has been}} opposed {{by a number}} of {{transportation}} advocates, community groups, and environmental groups, many of which instead advocate building a North–South Rail Link (NSRL) <b>through</b> <b>connection</b> to North Station and points beyond, rather than expanding the dead-end storage capacity for trains at South Station. Prominent NSRL supporters include former Governor Michael S. Dukakis (Democrat) and former Governor William F. Weld (Republican), who have made joint public appearances regarding this issue.

This was also supplemented by ship building, including {{the opening of a}} facility by Hughes, Bolckow and Co of Middlesbrough. Large scale shipbuilding had begun in 1811, and after passing through various hands, in 1880 the first two iron ships were built at Blyth for the Russian Government. This led to the foundation of the Blyth Shipbuilding Company on 2 March 1883, building cargo liners, tramp steamers and colliers. With a cargo ship under construction, in 1914 she was purchased by the Admiralty and converted into the Navy's first seaplane carrier [...] The company returned to commercial ship building, but collapsed in 1925. It was then revived from 1926, but after merger with other local yards and in light of the Wall Street Crash and resultant global recession, collapsed again in 1930. Reopened under its original name in 1937, it built various ships in preparation for and during WW2, including the former German cargo ship Hannover which was converted into the escort carrier [...] Owned by Mollers (Hong Kong) Ltd post-WW2, it then built cargo-liners for Moller's subsidiary the Lancashire Shipping Company. The construction yard closed in 1967, with only repair work and ship dismantling sustaining business until the yards were demolished in the late 1980s to make room for a paper and timber storage area.|$|E
