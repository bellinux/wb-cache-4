5|$|In {{pursuit of}} these funds he {{traveled}} to the Thracian Chersonese and attacked Selymbria. He plotted with a pro-Athenian party within the city and offered the Selymbrians reasonable terms and imposed strict discipline <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were observed. He did their city no injury whatsoever, but merely took a sum of money from it, set a garrison in it and left. Epigraphical evidence indicates the Selymbrians surrendered hostages until the treaty was ratified in Athens. His performance is judged as skillful by historians, since it saved time, resources, and lives and still fully achieved his goal.|$|E
5|$|A second {{emigrant}} ship—the Kennersley Castle, a merchantman docked at Leith, near Edinburgh—was {{hired by}} MacGregor in October 1822, and left Leith on 22 January 1823 with almost 200 emigrants aboard. MacGregor again saw the settlers off, coming aboard <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were well quartered; to their delight, {{he announced that}} since this was the maiden emigrant voyage from Scotland to Poyais, all {{the women and children}} would sail free of charge. The Cazique was rowed back to shore to rousing cheers from his colonists. The ship's captain Henry Crouch fired a six-gun broadside salute, hoisted the supposed flag of Poyais, then steered the ship out of port.|$|E
5|$|Twenty-five years pass, and Pulikecei is now {{the king}} of Cholapuram Paalayam. As foretold, he is foolish as well as lecherous. He is a puppet {{in the hands of}} Sangilimayan, who collaborates with the British for his own {{personal}} gain, and does not attend {{to the needs of the}} people of his kingdom. Pulikecei also tortures his subjects. He creates an outdoor stadium for different castes to fight against each other and punishes his palace guards even when they make the slightest of mistakes; he also uses his guards as targets for shooting practice. Ukraputhan, now an educated revolutionary, collaborates with his friends to overthrow the British. Ukraputhan falls in love with Vasantha Sundari, who reciprocates his feelings. When Ukraputhan tries to kill Pulikecei, he is shocked <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> look alike.|$|E

Replying to their request of practising their religion and till the land, he showed them a jug full of milk, saying Sanjan like it was full.

25|$|Aboard the TARDIS, the Doctor and Rose reminisce {{about their}} travels {{in front of}} Mickey, who feels left out. Suddenly the TARDIS is jolted and comes to a sudden stop.

The Doctor fears they are trapped in the Void, but Mickey opens the TARDIS doors <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are in London. Heading outside to look, they quickly realise {{that they are in}} London on a {{parallel}} Earth. The Doctor finds a small power cell in the TARDIS that still works, and he energises it with some of his own lifeforce. The cell needs time to recharge, so they decide to explore the alternate world. Rose is shocked to see a billboard with her father's picture on it, and the Doctor warns her not to seek him out because he is not her real father. Mickey decides to head off on his own and try to find his grandmother, who died in his universe. The Doctor and Rose discover that most of the population of London wear EarPod devices that feed information directly into the wearer's brain.|$|E

He also asserted that Gardner later joined another of the Pickingill covens, based in Hertfordshire, through which he received [...] "the Second Rite of the Hereditary Craft". Liddell stressed that this group was separate from Gardner's own Bricket Wood coven. He furthermore claimed that Gardner received the [...] "Third Rite" [...] from an East Anglian coven, with this three-degree system of initiation influencing that in Gardnerian Wicca. As a result, he stated that the structure and rituals of Gardnerian Wicca were based on those devised by Pickingill, and that [...] "no impartial observer could fail <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> formed the nucleus of the rites of Wicca." [...] Liddell believed that while many hereditary witches despised him, Gardner represented [...] "the spiritual heir of Pickingill", because he had similarly reformed and propagated witchcraft for contemporary purposes.|$|E

[...] A long life may give a person more of a chance to have a good death because he {{may be able to get}} himself morally in line during that time period, but it is also possible to die well quickly if you have lived morally. A good death also requires that the death be morally in proportion with the way one lived and was sustained, and occurs in a way that allows those caring for us <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> are sustaining us.|$|E

2500|$|All {{students}} and faculty, regardless of religion, {{are required to}} agree to adhere to an honor code. Early forms of the BYU Honor Code are found {{as far back as}} the days of the Brigham Young Academy and educator Karl G. Maeser. Maeser created the [...] "Domestic Organization", which was a group of teachers who would visit students at their homes <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> were following the school's moral rules prohibiting obscenity, profanity, smoking, and alcohol consumption. The Honor Code itself was created in 1940 at BYU and was used mainly for cases of cheating and academic dishonesty. Ernest L. Wilkinson expanded the Honor Code in 1957 to include other school standards (at the time, Wilkinson, as president of BYU, and the director of what was then the Unified Church School System, had some authority over all of the church's schools). This led to what the Honor Code represents today: rules regarding chastity, dress, grooming, drugs and alcohol in addition to academic honesty. A signed commitment to live the Honor Code is part of the application process for all LDS-affiliated schools, and must be adhered to by all students, faculty, and staff. Students and faculty found in violation of standards are either warned or called to meet with representatives of the Honor Council. In rare cases, {{students and}} faculty can be expelled from the school for excessive misbehavior. In addition to the general Honor Code common at all LDS schools, the BYU–Idaho Honor Code prohibits bib overalls, baseball caps (worn inside classrooms), shorts or capri pants, flip-flops (sandals), and also any worn, faded, or patched clothing on campus.|$|E
