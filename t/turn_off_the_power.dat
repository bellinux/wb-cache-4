Except trouble ensues when the plane suffers mechanical problems and is diverted to Philadelphia. During this time, the show reverts to Jessie (Debby Ryan), and Emma (Peyton List). The latter becomes ecstatic after discovering Austin's newly scheduled performance. Despite Jessie's objections, she agrees to take Emma to Times Square to watch the performance. They quickly come up with a solution and decide to take a cab to New York, but they are kicked off when they cannot afford the fare for going a far distance. As both Emma and Jessie, and the four make their way through the crowd, security won't let Austin through, before the six meet. Jessie flies Austin to the stage in the Ross' helicopter, saving Austin, whose contract with Starr Records would have been terminated. After the performance, Bertram (Kevin Chamberlin), Luke (Cameron Boyce), and Ravi (Karan Brar-Emma siblings) arrive and tell Jessie that Zuri (Skai Jackson) had been separated in the chaos, and stuck on the Times Square Ball. They attempt to save her (despite the time being six minutes to midnight) but when they succeed in it, Luke and Ravi accidentally <b>turn</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> in New York City. Jessie lets the gang stay at their apartment in hopes that Austin will record one of her songs {{and turn it into a}} big hit, and there, they meet the rest of the Ross family. Later on, Jessie and the kids travel to Miami where Austin and Jessie will sing a duet at his next concert. When Ally reads Jessie's lyrics, she thinks they're not good, so Jessie accidentally steals Zuri's poem and takes credit for it. To prevent Zuri from finding out, Jessie cuts the strings from Austin's guitar and ruins it. When eventually Zuri finds out, she ends up giving Jessie credit because she knows how much it means to her, because acting and creative writing didn't work out for her. In the end, when Austin and Jessie give an unforgettable performance, Jessie gives Zuri credit and Dez makes an awesome music video, which has everyone satisfied.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Power gating is an {{effective}} way to reduce leakage power. This technique uses high Vth transistors, called sleep transistors, to <b>turn</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> supply. However, sleep transistors suffer from the bias temperature instability (BTI) effect, resulting in an increased Vth, and reduced reliability. This paper proposes two BTI-aware sleep tran-sistor sizing algorithms to reduce the total width of sleep transistors based on the distributed sleep transistor network structure. The pro-posed algorithms reduce total width by more than 16. 08 %. More area can be reduced if the BTI effect on both sleep and cluster transistors is considered.

This experiment seeks to determine if the indoor air quality of economizer systems is suitable for data center use. The mass concentrations of the particulate matter were measured both inside and outside of the data center, using aerosol instruments. Particles were captured using collection filters, to identify their chemical properties. It is shown that indoor particle concentrations rise when the economizer is operating, due to bringing in outside air. However, the concentrations are well below the ASHRAE standard, which confirms that economizer use does not pose a risk for the servers in a data center...|$|E

40|$|When {{studying}} circuit theory, {{we learn}} that there are threefundamental circuit elements: the resistor, the capacitor,and the inductor. The first element determines the relationbetween current and voltage, the second between charge and voltage, and the third between current and magnetic flux (or the time integral of the voltage). These passive two-terminal devices are basic building blocks of modern electronics and are therefore ubiquitous in circuits. However, we are also taught {{that they do not}} store information. Even if the state of one of the above elements changes, the information about the new state will be lost once we <b>turn</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> source and wait some time. This point may seem irrelevant, but it is instead fundamentally crucial: storing information without the need of a power source would represent a paradigm change in electronics. For instance, we would need many less active elements (like transistors) to perform any type of computation or processing. This state of affairs has changed completely by the introduction in 1971 of the concept of memristor (short for memory-resistor) by Chua [1], [9], who noticed that fundamental circuit theories miss an element determining the relation between magnetic flux and charge. Equivalently, the memris-tor relates the current to the voltage [1], [9] but, unlike its traditional coun-terpart, its resistance, upon turning off the power source, depends on the integral of its entire past current wave-form. In other words, it has memory of past states through which the system has evolved. The concept has re-mained mainly theoretical until last year, when interest has resurfaced due to the realization of such a device by a group at Hewlett-Packard using tita-nium dioxide thin films [2], [10].

40|$|Direct {{electrical}} heating (DEH) {{is a field}} proven {{flow assurance}} technology {{which is based on}} controlling the temperature by electrifying the pipeline and utilizing the pipelines electrical resistance to generate heat. The main safety principle for a DEH system is to detect any faults in the piggyback cable (PBC) and immediately <b>turn</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> <b>power</b> to avoid potential pipeline damages. Break detection using fiber optics (FO) is a qualified fault detection method, patented by Nexans, and is installed in as a base case. Light is continuously going through a looped fiber configuration. In the event of a short circuit, the fiber will instantly burn off and trigger a shutdown of the system. The results from the qualification test concluded that break detection fulfils the safety requirements regardless of the surrounding medium of the pipeline, and fiber location relative to the pipeline and cable fault. Distributed temperature sensing (DTS) is a method to monitor the temperature profile along a continuous FO element. The measuring principles of Raman and Brillouin are commonly used and verified to be accurate and effective mechanisms to measure the temperature profile of the fiber. The DTS system performance is based on a trade-off between accuracy, measurement time and distance range. This thesis reviews the limiting factors and discusses the reliability of DTS measurements for a DEH system. Raman and Brillouin based DTS systems can be applied for distances up to 40 km and 75 km, respectively, and the literature survey shows that both have a localization accuracy better than 1 m and temperature accuracy within ± 1 °C. The possibility of using DTS for fault detection in DEH systems was explored experimentally by conducting Raman and Brillouin based DTS measurements. The correlation of distance, accuracy and measurement time was investigated. The results indicate that the measurement times for DTS are too long to detect a short circuit situation. The measurement time can be decreased by lowering the accuracy, which also will decrease the ability to detect hot-spots. The measuring units will display an alarm message immediately after a fiber break, which theoretically could be used to switch off the electricity. This would however then be a break detection system and a violation of patent...|$|E
