Furthermore, the convention suggested that May 3, {{the anniversary of the}} Constitution of May 3rd 1791, should become a national holiday, as it had always been for the Alliance of Democrats. After martial law was declared in Poland in 1981, a group of MPs representing the Alliance, Hanna Suchocka, Dorota Simonides and Jan Janowski among them, voted against abolishing the Solidarity Trade Union. Some Alliance members became engaged in the activities of the anti-Communist underground opposition.|$|E
50|$|The Polish Parliament has two chambers. The lower chamber (Sejm) has 460 members, elected for a {{four-year}} term by proportional representation in multi-seat constituencies using the d'Hondt method {{similar to that}} used in many parliamentary political systems, with a 5% threshold (8% for coalitions, threshold waived for national minorities). The Senate (Senat) has 100 members elected for {{a four-year}} term under the single member, one-round first-past-the-post voting method. When sitting in joint session, members of the Sejm and Senate form the National Assembly, (Polish Zgromadzenie Narodowe). The National Assembly is formed on three occasions: Taking the oath of office by a new president, bringing an indictment against the President of the Republic to the <b>Tribunal</b> <b>of</b> <b>State,</b> and declaration of a President's permanent incapacity to exercise their duties due to the state of their health. Only the first kind has occurred to date. Since 1991 elections are supervised by the National Electoral Commission (Państwowa Komisja Wyborcza), whose administrative division is called the National Electoral Office (Krajowe Biuro Wyborcze).|$|E

40|$|The {{subject of}} the article are the legal {{regulations}} contained in the Constitution of the Polish People's Republic and in the Constitutional Tribunal Act of 29 April, 1985, and concerned with the two subject ranges {{pointed out in the}} title and, at the same time, with four detailed topics taken from each of the two ranges. When characterising the Tribunal and presenting its form, the author puts forward the following theses: 1) the Tribunal is an organ provided for in the Constitution of the PPR, yet it might act {{solely on the basis of}} an ordinary act, 2) the installment of the resolutions concerning the Tribunal in the 4 th chapter of the Constitution, together with the resolutions about the <b>Tribunal</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> and the Chief Board of Supervision, is not justified, 3) the Tribunal is an organ of the administration of justice, and is therefore a court, but a court of a specific kind, and hence its name should be considered as most appropriate, 4) the Tribunal is an independent organ, and not an inner organ of the Seym, although it is, at the same time, — in spite of the independence of its members — an organ subordinated to the Seym. The author justifies each of the theses mentioned in greater detail. Introducing next the subject-matter of the Tribunal's characteristics, the author 1) points out the several conclusions that can be drawn in this respect from the Polish Constitution, especially from art. 33 a; 2) presents similar conclusions arising from the resolutions in the Constitutional Tribunal Act, regulating the adequacy of the Tribunal in the area of considering motions to investigate the consistence or rather inconsistence of Constitutional acts with the Constitution, as well as that of other normative acts issued by the supreme and central state organs — with the Constitution and other legislative acts, 3) discusses the competences of the Tribunal regarding the answering of legal queries, 4) and also presents certain general principles, the acceptance of which is, in his opinion, a precondition to the Tribunal adequately performing the tasks expected of it.

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the fundamentals}} of civil law liability of the State for the harm resulting from the excercising of public power in both the Austrian constitutional monarchy(1867 - 1918) {{as well as in}} the Second Republic of Poland (1918 - 1939). The paper is designed to demonstrate the extent to which decisions of the Austrian Supreme Tribunal in the area of compensatory liability - were reflected in the decisions of the Polish Supreme Court of the inter-war time. The possibility of survival, in this area, of the Austrian legal thought in the independent Poland was justified both by the binding force of the same Civil Code (which was the ABGB still in force until 1946 in the area of former Austrian partition) as well as by similar constitutional regulations. Both the Austrian Constitution of December 1867 as well as the Polish Constitution of March 1921 accepted the liability of State for harm done to an individual by the agencies of State power, the harm resulting from the activities of the officials who operated contrary to law. Yet the regulations of both Constitutions were deprived of executory provisions. Similiar (and partly even identic) legal state was, to a large extent, decisive of the adopting by the Polish courts of the adjudicating line characteristic of the Austrian courts. The analysis of both the Austrian as well as the Polish court decisions disclosed that in numerous cases in which compensatory claims were raised the courts tended toward the weakening of the principle of the absence of liability of the State for the harm done by its agencies as due to the shortage of the detailed provisions. The first attempt to remedy this absence was made by the Supreme Tribunal (Ober-Gerichtshof) as well as by the <b>Tribunal</b> <b>of</b> <b>State</b> (Reichsgericht) in the monarchical Austria. The arguments resorted to by the two Tribunals facilitated the recognition in 1931 by the Polish Supreme Court of the principle of limited liability of State Treasury for the harm done to somebody as a result of excercising the public power by the State agencies...|$|E

40|$|The {{premise of}} this {{dissertation}} is that Article 79 of the UN Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods-which concerns exemptions for contractual non-performance {{due to an}} ""impediment"" beyond a party's control-should be interpreted autonomously, that is, as an international norm, without reference to domestic legal concepts and principles. To this end, this dissertation considers the application of Article 79 by courts and arbitral tribunals across a number <b>of</b> signatory <b>states.</b> By studying the treatment of Article 79 by the courts and arbitral <b>tribunals</b> <b>of</b> various <b>states,</b> differences in doctrine and case law have been discerned. The extent of conceptual differences towards the doctrine of excuses for nonperformance also helps {{to determine whether the}} CISG's goal of uniformity is achievable. This research concludes {{that there has been a}} convergence in the treatment of Article 79, and this supports the premise that a legal doctrine-in this case, the excuse for non- performance-germinating in various legal systems, ultimately evolved into an autonomous principle, towards a conceptual goal of uniformity in a body of international commercial law, regardless of its unique development in separate and distinct legal jurisdictions. ...|$|R
