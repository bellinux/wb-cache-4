The developers went bankrupt ten years after opening the pools but they were sold had operated privately until they were taken over by the local corporation in the 1890s. They then operated as a public swimming baths until the 1970s. The pool closed in 1984 and was used for a short time as a <b>trout</b> <b>farm</b> before closure and falling into disrepair. In 2005 a trust was formed to raise funds for renovation and reopening of the pools.

2500|$|In 1966, Albert Raney, Sr. {{decided to}} sell his family's Ozark <b>trout</b> <b>farm</b> and listed it with O. J. Snow, a Harrison, Arkansas real estate agent. Snow {{examined}} the property and decided that the Raney farm was ideal for an amusement park based on pioneer themes, which was an idea he had entertained for years. He noted that features of the area resembled those pictured in the Li'l Abner comic strip: he imagined Mill Creek Canyon {{at the base of}} a 55-foot (16.8m) waterfall could be the [...] "bottomless canyon" [...] featured in the comic strip, and the nearby tourist attraction Mystic Caverns (also owned by the Raney family) could become [...] "Dogpatch Cave", where Kickapoo Joy Juice was brewed by a few unsavory Dogpatch characters.|$|E

On December 8, 2014 the park was opened to the public for the first time since it closed 21 years earlier.

2500|$|Snow {{and nine}} or ten Harrison {{businessmen}} formed Recreation Enterprises, Incorporated (REI) to develop the land. Their {{first step was to}} get permission from Al Capp, the creator of Li'l Abner, for a park based on his work. According to an Arkansas Gazette article, Snow sent Capp home movies of the property and descriptions of the attractions. In addition to the <b>trout</b> <b>farm</b> and Mystic Caverns cave, Snow planned a variety of attractions and activities, including horseback riding, paddle boats, train rides, local arts and crafts shops, family-oriented theatrical presentations, a botanical garden, an apiary, and honey and fudge shops. Li'l Abner comic-strip characters who would roam the park and perform skits for the patrons. Snow also assured Capp that the park would be quiet and dignified and would not include roller coasters or thrill rides that would conflict with the rustic Li'l Abner theme. Capp, who had turned down other offers to use his characters in theme parks, accepted this one and became a partner, claiming he had once driven through the Ozarks and had pictured just such an area for the setting of his fictional [...] "Dogpatch" [...] town. On January 4, 1967, an article in the Northwest Arkansas Times stated that Capp's attorneys were finalizing the agreement. Capp approved of the plans for the park and granted REI the rights to use his characters.|$|E

40|$|Analysis of data {{collected}} from rainbow <b>trout</b> <b>farms</b> in the United Kingdom found that mortality levels in triploid rainbow trout were lower than those in diploids.

The model showed that growing triploids could be more profitable than growing diploids, and this was achieved through improvements in productivity (in terms of better survival) and potential for increased product value, and despite the extra costs attributed to purchasing triploid fingerlings...|$|R
5000|$|The {{color and}} {{flavor of the}} flesh depends on the diet and {{freshness}} of the <b>trout.</b> <b>Farmed</b> <b>trout</b> and some populations of wild trout, especially anadromous steelhead, have reddish or orange flesh {{as a result of}} high astaxanthin levels in their diets. Astaxanthin is a powerful antioxidant that may be from a natural source or a synthetic trout feed. Rainbow trout raised to have pinker flesh from a diet high in astaxanthin are sometimes sold in the U.S. with labeling calling them [...] "steelhead". [...] As wild steelhead are in decline in some parts of their range, farmed rainbow are viewed as a preferred alternative. [...] In Chile and Norway, rainbow <b>trout</b> <b>farmed</b> in saltwater sea cages are sold labeled as steelhead.|$|R
40|$|Feeds {{and feeding}} {{practices}} {{have a major}} influence on sustainability of intensive fish farming, in addition they affect many quality attributes of cultured fish species. In the framework of the “I. R. IDEA” project, the composition of feeds, feeding practices and major quality traits of fish produced by the local <b>trout</b> <b>farming</b> industry were investigated with the aim at seeking for possible distinctive features and/or suggesting novel feeding protocols which could add value to the regional trout supply chain. The survey has shown that the locally used trout feeds are quite different in formulation and nutrient characteristics resulting in variable quality attributes of the fish flesh. This actually does not allow acknowledgement of particular features of the local <b>trout</b> <b>farming</b> process/products. An agreement between fish farmers and the feed-mill industry for a sustainable range of raw materials–nutrients specifications to be set in trout feeds, is strongly recommended as an effective way to characterise local trout products and supply chain. Also the feeding practices and protocols currently adopted by the local trout farmers do not possess peculiar features. On this subject we have tested cyclic feeding as a novel protocol being adopted {{for the first time in}} commercial <b>trout</b> <b>farms.</b> The results obtained so far have shown cyclic feeding to be a promising practice, resulting in improved economic and environmental sustainability when compared to conventional feeding protocols. Cyclic feeding should be also recommended as a possible tool to characterise local <b>trout</b> <b>farming</b> management and supply chain...|$|R
