During this process, two crystals bonded to each other containing a weak plane produced by ion implantation are heated to let {{a thin layer of}} one of the material on the other. The level of stress imposed on the film during the heating phase due to the mismatch of thermal expansion coefficients of the substrate and the film is shown to be the dominent factor in determining the quality of the <b>transferred</b> <b>layer.</b> In particular, it is shown that if the film is submitted to a tensile stress, the microcracks produced by ion implantation are not stable and deviate from the plane of implantation making the <b>layer</b> <b>transfer</b> process impossible. However, if the compressive stress exceeds a threshold value, after <b>layer</b> <b>transfer,</b> the film can buckle and delaminate, leading to transverse cracks induced by bending. As a result, we show that the imposed stress σ_m —- or equivalently the heating temperature -— must be within the range −σ_c<σ_m< 0 to produce an intact thin film where σ_c depends on the interfacial fracture energy and the size of defects at the interface between film and substrate...|$|R

40|$|Integration of III-V {{materials}} with Si substrates {{has been studied}} extensively in recent years since it has {{a wide range of}} applications on optoelectronic integrated circuits (OEIC). It enables the combinations of III-V based optoelectronic devices with Si-based microelectronic devices and circuits. The conventional approach for III-V integration with Si is based on wafer bonding and etch- back. Although it provides III-V materials transferred on Si with relatively high crystalline quality, the etch-back process in this approach etches off the initial III-V growth substrate thus it gives low yield and increases the cost. Recently, another III-V <b>layer</b> <b>transfer</b> approach using the ion-cut (smart-cut®) process has been demonstrated, based on hydrogen ion implantation and wafer bonding. This approach has the advantage of saving the initial III-V substrate for reuse, but the transferred structure usually suffers from the hydrogen implantation induced damage. This dissertation demonstrates a new approach that combines ion-cut and selective chemical etch for InP-based III-V <b>layer</b> <b>transfer.</b> This <b>layer</b> <b>transfer</b> scheme takes advantage of conventional ion-cutting process by conserving III-V substrates for reuse, and simultaneously improving the <b>transferred</b> <b>layer</b> quality and surface condition without using chemical and mechanical polishing. The effects of hydrogen ion implantation conditions (temperature, dose rate, and energy) on III-V ion-cut process have been investigated and the physical mechanism behind these effects was examined. Based on these findings, the hydrogen implantation conditions were optimized in our study that led to successful III-V <b>layer</b> <b>transfers.</b> Based on our <b>layer</b> <b>transfer</b> scheme, two approaches have been explored for integrating an III-V based device on Si. One way is to <b>transfer</b> an InP <b>layer</b> onto Si and use this transferred structure as a growth template. Instead of growing complicated III-V device structures which are out of the growth capacity in our laboratory, we focused on the fundamental issues with the transferred structure that must be solved for the growth template purpose. Particularly there is a bubble issue that always shows up when the transferred structures are heated up in the growth chamber. We studied the origin of these bubbles and implemented a simple and effective approach that can constantly solve the bubble problem. Another way is to grow an III-V device on III-V substrate and transfer the whole device structure onto Si.

40|$|Although {{theoretical}} {{investigation has}} demonstrated that fewer strain <b>transfer</b> <b>layers</b> imply a greater strain transfer ratio, as well as increased accuracy, most researchers are still focused on investigating encapsulated Fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs) in surface strain measurements. This is because, in a traditional view, bare FBGs are too fragile to be mounted on the substrate for measuring surface strain. Polyimide FBGs may provide a better balance point between accuracy and protection. A new method to measure surface strain with polyimide fiber Bragg gratings is proposed. Bare polyimide FBGs have a polyimide coating, but like regular non-coated FBGs. This gives polyimide FBGs a higher strain transfer ratio and response frequency.
