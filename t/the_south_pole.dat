5|$|Above the Arctic Circle, {{an extreme}} case is reached {{where there is}} no {{daylight}} at all for part of the year, up to six months at the North Pole itself, a polar night. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is exactly reversed, with <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Pole</b> oriented opposite the direction of the North Pole. Six months later, this pole will experience a midnight sun, a day of 24 hours, again reversing with <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Pole.</b>|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 31 October 1956 that anyone set foot on <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Pole</b> again; on that day a U.S. Navy group led by Rear Admiral George J.

The first women to step onto <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Pole</b> were Pam Young, Jean Pearson, Lois Jones, Eileen McSaveney, Kay Lindsay and Terry Tickhill in 1969.|$|E

5|$|In 1928, Smith was {{selected}} as a pilot for the Byrd Antarctic Expedition of 1928–1930 {{from a list of}} over 25,000 pilots. Byrd selected Smith not only for his all-weather experience, but because of the respect he had for Smith's mother after meeting her. Smith flew a three-engined Ford Trimotor plane named the Floyd Bennett (named in Bennett's honor) and headed for <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Pole</b> on August 25, 1928. He logged 70 hours of Antarctic flying during the time he was at <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Pole</b> with Admiral Richard Byrd.|$|E
5|$|In {{the ensuing}} months of winter {{darkness}} Joyce and Wild printed around 30copies of the expedition's book, Aurora Australis, which were sewn and bound using packaging materials. The most important winter's work, however, {{was preparing for}} the following season's major journeys, which were to include attempts on both <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Pole</b> and the South Magnetic Pole. By making his base in McMurdo Sound, Shackleton {{had been able to}} reinstate the Magnetic Pole as an expedition objective. Shackleton himself would be leading <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Pole</b> journey, which had suffered a serious setback during the winter when four of the remaining ponies died, mainly from eating volcanic sand for its salt content.|$|E
5|$|Scott's plans {{gradually}} came to fruition– {{a large-scale}} scientific and geographical expedition with {{the conquest of}} <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Pole</b> as its principal objective. Scott was anxious to avoid the amateurism that had {{been associated with the}} Discovery Expedition's scientific work. He appointed Edward Wilson as his chief scientist, and Wilson selected an experienced team. The expedition set off in June 1910 in Terra Nova, one of Discovery's relief ships. Its programme was complicated by the simultaneous arrival in the Antarctic of Roald Amundsen's Norwegian expedition. Amundsen's party reached <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Pole</b> on 14 December 1911 and returned safely. Scott and four companions, including Wilson, arrived at the Pole on 17 January 1912; all five perished on the return journey.|$|E
50|$|The Earth's {{geomagnetic}} field can {{be approximated by}} a tilted dipole (like a bar magnet) placed {{at the center of}} <b>the</b> Earth. <b>The</b> <b>South</b> Geomagnetic <b>Pole</b> is <b>the</b> point where the axis of this best-fitting tilted dipole intersects the Earth's surface in the southern hemisphere. As of 2005 it was calculated to be located at , near the Vostok Station. Because the field is not an exact dipole, <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Geomagnetic <b>Pole</b> does not coincide with <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Magnetic <b>Pole.</b> Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Geomagnetic <b>Pole</b> is wandering for the same reason its northern magnetic counterpart wanders.|$|R
50|$|Data {{access to}} <b>the</b> Amundsen-Scott <b>South</b> <b>Pole</b> Station is {{provided}} by access via NASA's TDRS-F1, GOES & Iridium satellite constellation. Marisat F-2 provided data communications until it was retired in 2008. For the 2007-2008 season, the TDRS relay (named <b>South</b> <b>Pole</b> TDRSS Relay or SPTR) was upgraded to support a data return rate of 50 Mbit/s, which comprises over 90% of <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Pole's</b> data capability, which is used primarily for scientific data return.|$|R
25|$|It is more {{difficult}} to find <b>the</b> <b>south</b> celestial <b>pole</b> in <b>the</b> sky at this moment, as that area is a particularly bland portion of the sky, and <b>the</b> nominal <b>south</b> <b>pole</b> star is Sigma Octantis, which with magnitude 5.5 is barely {{visible to the naked eye}} even under ideal conditions. That will change from the 80th to the 90th centuries, however, when <b>the</b> <b>south</b> celestial <b>pole</b> travels through the False Cross.|$|R

5|$|Aang's {{character}} was developed from a drawing by Bryan Konietzko, depicting a bald {{man with an}} arrowlike design on his head, which the artist developed into {{a picture of a}} child with a flying bison. Meanwhile, Michael Dante DiMartino was interested in a documentary about explorers trapped in <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Pole,</b> which he later combined with Konietzko's drawing.|$|E
5|$|At {{the edge}} of the continent, strong {{katabatic}} winds off the polar plateau often blow at storm force. In the interior, wind speeds are typically moderate. During clear days in summer, more solar radiation reaches the surface at <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Pole</b> than at the equator because of the 24 hours of sunlight each day at the Pole.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>South</b> Magnetic <b>Pole</b> is <b>the</b> {{wandering}} {{point on}} the Earth's Southern Hemisphere where the geomagnetic field lines are directed vertically upwards. It {{should not be confused}} with <b>the</b> <b>South</b> Geomagnetic <b>Pole</b> described later.|$|R

5000|$|Unlike {{a typical}} compass, a luopan does not {{point to the}} north {{magnetic}} pole of Earth.

5|$|Clouds {{typically}} cover 1% of Titan's disk, though outburst {{events have}} been observed in which the cloud cover rapidly expands {{to as much as}} 8%. One hypothesis asserts that the southern clouds are formed when heightened levels of sunlight during the southern summer generate uplift in the atmosphere, resulting in convection. This explanation is {{complicated by the fact that}} cloud formation has been observed not only after the southern summer solstice but also during mid-spring. Increased methane humidity at <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>pole</b> possibly contributes to the rapid increases in cloud size. It was summer in Titan's southern hemisphere until 2010, when Saturn's orbit, which governs Titan's motion, moved Titan's northern hemisphere into the sunlight. When the seasons switch, it is expected that ethane will begin to condense over <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>pole.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} {{expedition}} 1907–1909 he and three companions established {{a new record}} Farthest South latitude at 88°S, only 97 geographical miles (112 statute miles, 180km) from <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Pole,</b> the largest advance to the pole in exploration history. Also, members of his team climbed Mount Erebus, the most active Antarctic volcano. For these achievements, Shackleton was knighted by King Edward VII on his return home.|$|E

5|$|As this {{scenario}} continues, by 100 million {{years from the}} present the continental spreading will have reached its maximum extent and the continents will then begin to coalesce. In 250 million years, North America will collide with Africa while South America will wrap around {{the southern tip of}} Africa. The result will be the formation of a new supercontinent (sometimes called Pangaea Ultima), with the Pacific Ocean stretching across half the planet. The continent of Antarctica will reverse direction and return to <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Pole,</b> building up a new ice cap.|$|E
5|$|Farthest South was {{the most}} southerly latitudes reached by explorers before the conquest of <b>the</b> <b>South</b> <b>Pole</b> in 1911. Significant steps {{on the road to}} the pole were the {{discovery}} of lands south of Cape Horn in 1619, Captain James Cook's crossing of the Antarctic Circle in 1773, and the earliest confirmed sightings of the Antarctic mainland in 1820. From the late 19th century onward, the quest for Farthest South latitudes became in effect a race to reach the pole, which culminated in Roald Amundsen's success in December 1911.|$|E
5|$|Further {{sedimentary}} deposits {{were formed}} through the Cambrian period (541–485 Ma), some of which, {{along with the}} earlier Precambrian sediments, metamorphosed into the Dalradian series. This is composed {{of a wide variety}} of materials, including mica schist, biotite gneiss schist, schistose grit, greywacke and quartzite. The area that would become Scotland was at this time close to <b>the</b> <b>south</b> <b>pole</b> and part of Laurentia. Fossils from the north-west Highlands indicate the presence of trilobites and other primitive forms of life.|$|E
