5|$|There is {{evidence}} that epileptic seizures are usually not a random event. Seizures are often brought on by factors such as stress, alcohol abuse, flickering light, {{or a lack of}} sleep, among others. The term seizure threshold is used to indicate the amount of stimulus necessary <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> seizure. Seizure threshold is lowered in epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|In France, the premiership of Aristide Briand, {{a leading}} proponent of {{engaging}} with Constantine <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> reconciliation {{of the two}} Greek administrations, was threatened by the events in Athens, leading to the reorganization of the French government. In Britain, Prime Minister H. H. Asquith and foreign minister Sir Edward Grey resigned and were replaced by Lloyd George and Arthur Balfour. The change in the British leadership proved to be particularly important for Greece, since Lloyd George was a known Hellenophile, an admirer of Venizelos and dedicated to resolving the Eastern Question.|$|E

Ewell, on Oak Hill with Rodes, saw Howard's troops deploying before him, and he interpreted this as the start of an attack and implicit permission to set aside Gen.

5|$|Unable {{to defeat}} Agesilaus' army, Pharnabazus decided to force Agesilaus to {{withdraw}} by stirring up {{trouble on the}} Greek mainland. He dispatched Timocrates of Rhodes, an Asiatic Greek, to distribute ten thousand gold darics in the major cities of the mainland and incite them to act against Sparta. Timocrates visited Athens, Thebes, Corinth, and Argos, and succeeded in persuading powerful factions {{in each of those}} states to pursue an anti-Spartan policy. The Thebans, who had previously demonstrated their antipathy towards Sparta, undertook <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> war.|$|E
5|$|Pitt's {{administration}} {{took the}} guilty verdict in Paine's trial {{as a sign}} that further prosecutions for sedition were possible, and began many. In the 17 months following the trial, 11 publishers of the Rights of Man were prosecuted, receiving prison sentences of up to 4 years. These acted as a prelude to the 1794 Treason Trials, in which a dozen reformers were indicted for allegedly conspiring <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> revolution. Erskine played a prominent role in defending many of them, including Thomas Hardy, John Horne Tooke and John Thelwall, all three of whom were acquitted.|$|E
5|$|Ramanujam Iyengar alias Ambi is an {{orthodox}} Brahmin and a straightforward consumer protection advocate living in Triplicane, Chennai. He expects everyone {{to follow the}} law and prosecutes those who violate it. However, his efforts fail as circumstantial evidence always seems to favour the accused. He also fails to raise civic awareness due to pervasive corruption and {{a general lack of}} seriousness. Frustrated at his inability <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> change in society, his suppressed anger manifests itself in an alter-ego named Anniyan, a grim reaper-themed serial killer who punishes corrupt and indifferent people. Anniyan creates a website, compiles a list of wrongdoers from his site, and kills them using punishments described in the Garuda Puranam, one of the ancient Hindu scriptures.|$|E

5|$|Sex-positive feminist writer Susie Bright {{called the}} Magic Wand {{one of her}} two {{favorite}} vibrators, and called it a miracle that the device was able <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> orgasm in under sixty seconds. Bright wrote about her experience using the Magic Wand to relieve discomfort during childbirth. Author Kathy Shaidle wrote that the massager is able to give females multiple orgasms. Shaidle wrote that its effectiveness was not hampered by its appearance which brought to mind objects featured in the Mütter Museum. Sociologist, sexologist and sex-positive feminist Carol Queen critiqued the carbon footprint of the Magic Wand because it was imported from Japan, and praised its environmentally friendly qualities including its lack of batteries, and durability compared to other vibrators.|$|E
5|$|Silent Hill 3 {{is set in}} {{the fictional}} {{universe}} of the Silent Hill series. Seventeen years before the start of Silent Hill 3, in the year 1983, Harry Mason defeated a god brought forth by the resident cult of Silent Hill and at the ending, was given a baby girl to care for. The protagonist and player character of Silent Hill 3 is Heather, the teenaged adopted daughter of Harry. Claudia Wolf, the cult's priestess who plans <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> paradise on Earth, serves as the game's antagonist. As Heather attempts to unravel the reasons why the cult of Silent Hill is pursuing her, she encounters a private investigator named Douglas Cartland; Vincent, a member of the cult who detests Claudia; and Leonard Wolf, Claudia's abusive father.|$|E
5|$|The {{war between}} France and the Emperor broke out {{once again in}} September 1551. In due course Northumberland {{rejected}} requests for English help from both sides, which {{in the case of}} the Empire consisted of a demand for full-scale war based on an Anglo-Imperial treaty of 1542. The Duke pursued a policy of neutrality, a balancing act that made peace between the two great powers attractive. In late 1552 he undertook <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> European peace by English mediation. These moves were taken seriously by the rival resident ambassadors, but were ended in June 1553 by the belligerents, the continuance of war being more advantageous to them.|$|E

5|$|In 692/693, the Byzantine emperor Justinian II (reigned 685–695 and 705–711) and the Umayyad Caliph Abd al-Malik (r. 685–705) {{broke the}} truce that had existed between Byzantium and the Umayyad Caliphate since 679, {{following}} the failed Muslim {{attack on the}} Byzantine capital, Constantinople. The Byzantines secured great financial and territorial advantages from the truce, which they extended further by exploiting the Umayyad government's involvement in the Second Muslim Civil War (680–692). However, by 692 the Umayyads were clearly emerging as the victors in the conflict, and Abd al-Malik consciously {{began a series of}} provocations <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> resumption of warfare. Justinian, confident in his own strength based on his previous successes, responded in kind. Finally, the Umayyads claimed that the Byzantines had broken the treaty and invaded Byzantine territory, defeating the imperial army at the Battle of Sebastopolis in 693. In its aftermath, the Arabs quickly regained control over Armenia and resumed their attacks into the border zone of eastern Asia Minor, that would culminate in the second attempt to conquer Constantinople in 716–718. Furthermore, Justinian was deposed in 695, beginning a twenty-year period of internal instability that almost brought the Byzantine state to its knees.|$|E
5|$|The British War Office's stated {{policy in}} October 1916 was to {{maintain}} offensive operations on the Western Front, while {{remaining on the}} defensive everywhere else. However, the battle of attrition on the Somme, coupled with a change of Britain's prime minister, with David Lloyd George succeeding H. H. Asquith on 7 December, destabilised the status quo sufficiently <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> policy reversal, making attacks on the Central Powers' weak points away from the Western Front desirable. The commander of the EEF, General Sir Archibald Murray, was encouraged to seek success on his eastern frontier, but without any reinforcements. He thought that an advance to El Arish was possible, and that such an advance would threaten forces in the southern Ottoman Empire and, if not prevent, at least slow the transfer of German and Ottoman units to other theatres of war from the Levant.|$|E
5|$|The series' central {{characters}} are Lightning, a former soldier and the core character {{in all three}} games; Serah Farron, Lightning's sister and the second game's main protagonist; Snow Villiers, an optimistic young man engaged to Serah; Hope Estheim, {{a young man who}} develops a strong bond with Lightning; Sazh Katzroy, a former airship pilot; Oerba Dia Vanille and Oerba Yun Fang, two women who inadvertently set the first game's events in motion. Three further characters appear in XIII-2: Noel Kreiss, a hunter who sets out to change his bleak future; Caius Ballad, a man from Noel's past who wishes <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> predestined apocalypse; and Paddra Nsu-Yeul, a seeress reincarnated through history.

5|$|Whereas Henry VII had not {{involved}} Parliament in his affairs very much, Henry VIII {{had to turn}} to Parliament during his reign for money, in particular for grants of subsidies to fund his wars. The Dissolution of the Monasteries provided a means to replenish the treasury, {{and as a result}} the Crown took possession of monastic lands worth £120,000 (£36million) a year. The Crown had profited a small amount in 1526 when Wolsey had put England onto a gold, rather than silver, standard, and had debased the currency slightly. Cromwell debased the currency more significantly, starting in Ireland in 1540. The English pound halved in value against the Flemish pound between 1540 and 1551 as a result. The nominal profit made was significant, helping to bring income and expenditure together, but it had a catastrophic effect on the overall economy of the country. In part, it helped <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> period of very high inflation from 1544 onwards.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon's {{efforts to}} win over both the Egyptians and the Ottomans proved unsuccessful; the Ottoman Empire {{declared}} war on September 9, 1798, and a revolt against French troops was launched from al-Azhar on October 21, 1798. Egyptians armed with stones, spears, and knives rioted and looted. The following morning the diwan met with Napoleon in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> peaceful conclusion to the hostilities. Napoleon, initially incensed, agreed to attempt a peaceful resolution and asked the sheikhs of the diwan to organize talks with the rebels. The rebels, believing the move indicated weakness among the French, refused. Napoleon then ordered that the city be fired upon from the Cairo Citadel, aiming directly at al-Azhar. During the revolt two to three hundred French soldiers were killed, with 3,000 Egyptian casualties. Six of the ulema of al-Azhar were killed following summary judgments laid against them, with several more condemned. Any Egyptian caught by French troops was imprisoned or, if caught bearing weapons, beheaded. The French troops intentionally desecrated the mosque, walking in with their shoes on and guns displayed. The troops tied their horses to the mihrab and ransacked the student quarters and libraries, throwing copies of the Quran on the floor. The leaders of the revolt then attempted to negotiate a settlement with Napoleon, but were rebuffed.|$|E
5|$|The {{widespread}} Yellow Turban Rebellion {{also occurred}} in 184 CE, its leaders {{claiming that they}} were destined <b>to</b> <b>bring</b> <b>about</b> <b>a</b> utopian era of peace. Like the Five Pecks of Rice society, the Yellow Turbans of the Huai and Yellow River valleys also believed that illness {{was a sign of}} wrongdoing that necessitated confession to church leaders and faith healers. However, the Yellow Turbans typically utilized holy water as a ramification for sickness; if this did not cure the sick, the latter's sins were deemed too great to be exculpated. Since the year 184 CE was the first (and very auspicious) year of a new sexagenary cycle, the Yellow Turban's supreme leader Zhang Jue (d. 184 CE) chose the third month of that year as the time to rebel; when this was leaked to the Han court, Zhang was forced to initiate the rebellion prematurely. Although the Yellow Turbans were able to muster hundreds of thousands of troops, they were overpowered by the combined force of imperial troops and independent generals. By {{the end of the year}} their leadership—including Zhang Jue—had been killed and only scattered groups remained until they were amalgamated into the forces of Cao Cao in 192 CE.|$|E
