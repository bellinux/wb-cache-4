5|$|American {{analysts were}} elated when they {{discovered}} {{that the number of}} trucks ordered by North Vietnam from its communist allies in late 1971 exceeded those of previous years. 6,000 vehicles had been ordered from the Soviet Union alone (as opposed to the usual 3,000) and this seemed to indicate that the enemy was hurting for transportation and that the campaign was working. However, since 80 percent of the vehicles arrived in North Vietnam at least six weeks before <b>the</b> <b>launching</b> <b>of</b> the Nguyen Hue Offensive (known to the U.S. as the Easter Offensive, they probably reflected anticipated losses.|$|E

5|$|One new {{innovation}} {{that took place}} during the campaign was renewed interest in personnel infiltration. This aspect of the PAVN effort had been virtually ignored since the initiation of the Commando Hunt in 1968. An intelligence collection and technical reassessment effort invited the Air Force to make another attempt to force the North Vietnamese pay for their effort in blood instead of in imported supplies and trucks. The result was Island Tree <b>the</b> <b>launching</b> <b>of</b> a personnel anti-infiltration effort during Commando Hunt VII. However, it was too little and far too late.|$|E

Initial public outcry denounced <b>the</b> <b>launching</b> <b>of</b> the operation as the Soviet and Azerbaijani governments went on to defend it, stating that the villagers of Shahumyan were providing aid and harboring the militias in their homes.

5|$|Commando Hunt VII {{came to a}} {{close with}} <b>the</b> <b>launching</b> <b>of</b> the PAVN {{offensive}} mentioned above. This conventional attack, backed by armor, heavy artillery, and anti-aircraft units (including SAMs) rolled over the two northernmost provinces of South Vietnam while two smaller offensives were launched in central and southern parts of the country. All U.S. and South Vietnamese air assets were diverted to first slowing, and then halting the onslaught. They were then utilized in the first sustained bombing of North Vietnam since late 1968 (see Operation Linebacker). Interdiction missions were then diverted to carry out an even heavier aerial offensive against the north (see Operation Linebacker II). The end was nigh for Commando Hunt. With the signing of the Paris Peace Accord in March 1973, the Vietnam War finally came to an end for the U.S.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} was complicated for the Americans by <b>the</b> <b>launching</b> <b>of</b> two smaller attacks by the North Vietnamese: the first aimed to seize Kon Tum in the Central Highlands, {{and threatened to}} cut South Vietnam in two; the second prompted a series of savage battles in and around An Lộc, the capital of Bình Long Province. A total of 14 PAVN divisions were now committed to the offensive. On 13 May 1972, South Vietnam launched a counteroffensive with four divisions backed by massive U.S. air support. By 17 May, Quảng Trị City was retaken, but the South Vietnamese military ran out of steam. The PAVN thrusts against Kon Tum and An Lộc were contained. During these operations, the North Vietnamese suffered approximately 100,000 casualties while the South Vietnamese suffered 30,000 fatalities during the fighting.|$|E
