5000|$|During {{their first}} years (1958-1963), <b>the</b> <b>Ventures</b> played Fender guitars (a Jazzmaster, a Stratocaster and a Precision Bass) for both their live {{performances}} and their recording sessions. These instruments are prominently {{visible on the}} covers of three early albums: <b>The</b> <b>Ventures,</b> Bobby Vee Meets <b>the</b> <b>Ventures,</b> and <b>The</b> Colorful <b>Ventures.</b> Then in early 1963, California guitar manufacturer Mosrite re-branded their uniquely styled, futuristic-looking Mark 1 electric guitar model for <b>the</b> <b>Ventures</b> by applying decals that stated [...] "The Ventures Model" [...] on the headstock. The band adopted these guitars (which included a bass model) and first used them on <b>The</b> <b>Ventures</b> in Space (1963), one of their most influential albums because of the unique, unworldly guitar sounds it contained. From 1963 through 1968, a statement on their album covers announced that <b>the</b> <b>Ventures</b> used Mosrite guitars [...] "exclusively" [...] (<b>the</b> <b>Ventures</b> and designer Semie Moseley were partners in the distribution of these instruments). After the expiration of their contract with Moseley, <b>the</b> <b>Ventures</b> returned to playing mainly Fender guitars. Only rarely have they used Mosrite guitars since that contract ended.|$|R

5|$|However, <b>the</b> <b>venture</b> {{was not as}} {{profitable}} as Méliès had expected; {{the high}} costs of the lavish hand-colored film put it {{out of the reach of}} many fairground exhibitors.
