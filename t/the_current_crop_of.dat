25|$|Even {{excluding}} Sussex and London, South-east England {{has been}} one of the key areas of English folk music and collection. It had retained a strong tradition of wassailing, and seafaring songs were important in the coastal counties of Kent and Hampshire. Arguably the published collection of oral material was made in this area by John Broadwood, as Old English Songs, As Now Sung by the Peasantry of the Weald of Surrey and Sussex (1843). When the first revival was at its height in the first decade of the 20th century, George Gardiner and Alice Gillington both collected songs in Hampshire, Lucy Broadwood in Surrey, Hampshire and Oxfordshire, Alfred Williams in Oxfordshire and Berkshire and Cecil Sharp in Berkshire, Buckinghamshire, and Kent. In the second folk revival the region contributed several figures, with probably the most important being Martin Carthy from Hertfordshire. The most significant British folk rock group from the region were the Oyster Band, formed in Canterbury, while guitarist John Martyn came from Surrey and fiddle player Chris Leslie from Banbury in Oxfordshire. From <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>crop</b> <b>of</b> young folk musicians probably the most prominent are Spiers and Boden from Oxfordshire and Chris Wood, born in Kent. The region is host to numerous folk clubs, and festivals, including the Oxford festival and Fairport’s Cropredy Convention in Oxfordshire and St Albans in Hertfordshire.|$|E

Queensland government is encouraging people for hardwood plantation in inland (low rainfall) area of Southeast Queensland (SEQ). However, the economic viability of the plantation is suspicious. Since the carbon sequestration is payable in the Kyoto context, this study has compared the total soil carbon and its long-term in-/decreasing rate in scrubland, pastureland, cropping land and spotted gum land in Krasnozem soil of Kingaroy, an inland SEQ. We have demonstrated how the timeline of land use transformation could be useful to triangulate the soil carbon trends efficiently and effectively. Isoprime isotope ratio mass spectrometer coupled to a Eurovector elemental analyser was used for soil analysis. The lowest amount of soil carbon was found in cropping land (77. 39 t/ha up to 110 cm), which was even bit lower than the global average of similar land use types (80 t/ha up to 100 cm). The soil carbon under the mature spotted gum (306 tC/ha) was found much higher than the world average soil carbon amount of similar region's forest and was closer to the world richest soil carbon boreal forest. The annual decreasing rate of soil carbon in cropping land was found 2. 6811166 percent which was almost similar to the ROTHC modelled value. The annual increasing rate of soil carbon under the pasture and spotted gum plantation was 0. 575841948 and 0. 926507307 percent respectively.

40|$|There {{is concern}} that food {{insecurity}} will increase in southern Africa due to climate change. We quantified {{the response of}} maize yield to projected climate change and to three key management options – planting date, fertilizer use and cultivar choice – using the crop simulation model, agricultural production systems simulator (APSIM), at two contrasting sites in Zimbabwe. Three climate periods up to 2100 were selected to cover both near- and long-term climates. Future climate data under two radiative forcing scenarios were generated from five global circulation models. The temperature is projected to increase significantly in Zimbabwe by 2100 with no significant change in mean annual total rainfall. When planting before mid-December with a high fertilizer rate, the simulated average grain yield for all three maize cultivars declined by 13 % for the periods 2010 – 2039 and 2040 – 2069 and by 20 % for 2070 – 2099 compared with the baseline climate, under low radiative forcing. Larger declines in yield of up to 32 % were predicted for 2070 – 2099 with high radiative forcing. Despite differences in annual rainfall, similar trends in yield changes were observed for the two sites studied, Hwedza and Makoni. The yield response to delay in planting was nonlinear. Fertilizer increased yield significantly under both baseline and future climates. The response of maize to mineral nitrogen decreased with progressing climate change, implying {{a decrease in the}} optimal fertilizer rate in the future. Our results suggest that in the near future, improved crop and soil fertility management will remain important for enhanced maize yield.

40|$|Abstract Improving crop {{nutrient}} efficiency {{becomes an}} essential consideration for environmentally friendly and sustainable agriculture. Plant {{growth and development}} is dependent on 17 essential nutrient elements, among them, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) {{are the two most}} important mineral nutrients. Hence {{it is not surprising that}} low N and/or low P availability in soils severely constrains crop growth and productivity, and thereby have become high priority targets for improving nutrient efficiency in crops. Root exploration largely determines the ability of plants to acquire mineral nutrients from soils. Therefore, root architecture, the 3 -dimensional configuration of the plant’s root system in the soil, is of great importance for improving crop nutrient efficiency. Furthermore, the symbiotic associations between host plants and arbuscularmycorrhiza fungi/rhizobial bacteria, are additional important strategies to enhance nutrient acquisition. In this review, we summarize the recent advances in <b>the</b> <b>current</b> understanding <b>of</b> <b>crop</b> species control <b>of</b> root architecture alterations in response to nutrient availability and root/microbe symbioses, through gene or QTL regulation, which results in enhanced nutrient acquisition...|$|R
40|$|Pinus patula is {{the main}} species grown for the {{production}} of unbleached kraft pulp on the 60 000 ha Usutu plantation, situated in Swaziland. Trees are harvested on short rotations from sites with low nutrient content and high acidity. In these circumstances sustained production from successive rotations has been an active research focus for nearly fifty years. On part of the Usutu plantation, underlain by gabbro rocks, a 20 % growth decline was reported between first and second rotations. This was found to be caused by developing potassium (K) and phosphorus (P) deficiencies. Results from long-term monitoring plots showed that the application of P and K fertilizer in the past corrected the decline in yield. However, the effect of these fertilizer applications on future rotation yields remained unknown. In 1989 a trial was established in a third rotation crop to determine the residual effects of the operational fertilizer application on growth and fertilizer response in the following rotation. During September 1999 a PK factorial treatment combination was applied to the fourth rotation with the residual PK effect occurring as a split plot treatment. In 2004 and 2005 intensive soil, foliar and forest floor sampling was conducted in the trial to ascertain the influence of the residual fertilizer and re-application of P and K on <b>the</b> growth <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>current</b> <b>crop.</b> Analysis <b>of</b> results indicated that in the presence of residual fertilizer, the re-application of only K fertilizer increased volume by 27 m ha- 1 at age seven years.

From these early results it would seem that enough residual P fertilizer remained available to supply the early nutrient demand <b>of</b> the next <b>crop.</b> Although residual K fertilizer also affected some parameters, it was insufficient to supply the requirements <b>of</b> the next <b>crop.</b> We conclude that fertilizer applications to successive crops can be adjusted to allow for benefit from residual P applied in the previous crop...|$|R
