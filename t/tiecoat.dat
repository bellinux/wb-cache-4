40|$|As applicators seek {{to reduce}} coating cost and achieve bettemoating {{performance}} for plastic substrates, {{there are many}} issues which need to be addressed. The most obvious, will the coating be able {{to adhere to the}} substrate? Specifically, with the increasing demand for TPO substrates, the greatest need for the applicator is finding a cost effective product which promotes adhesion or acts as a <b>tiecoat</b> for the base coat and clear coat to the substrate. After adhering to the substrate, other major issues which exist are does the product meet regulatory standards and can the product be used with the existing plant equipment? One possible approach to answering some of the concems is developing a means for lowering the VOC of solvent-bome adhesion promoters while maintaining sprayability and performance. Initial UNICARBO spray demonstrations and test results have proven satisfactory when tested for interior and exterior TPO automotive coating specifications. While further testing is still necessary, UNICARBm adhesion promoters have thus far proven to be viable products for reducing VOCs as well as a cost effective alternative to achieving coating performance...|$|E
