25|$|After being {{defeated}} by a heavy margin of 223 runs and an innings pasting, India {{still had a}} chance of winning the remaining two tests to avoid a series defeat, but that was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> against the Invincibles, who were the better team in all respects. This test was the debut test of future Australian great, Neil Harvey.The toss was won by the Australians and on a pitch that was perfectly conductive for batting, Bradman chose to bat first.|$|E
25|$|Ryan Sidebottom and Stuart Broad disciplined bowling yielded four early wickets putting Sri Lanka on 38/4 after 14.1 overs. Jayawardene and Tillakaratne Dilshan {{started a}} {{recovery}} but after both their wickets fell within nine deliveries {{of each other}} the game was largely in England’s control. From then on wickets fell at regular intervals and although Dilhara Fernando and Farveez Maharoof added 43 runs for the final wicket it was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> for the final pair to win the match.|$|E
25|$|Both Worcestershire Royals and Glamorgan Dragons were {{knocked out}} before the last round of the Twenty20 Cup group stage, so the match at New Road was fairly academic. It did not stop Worcestershire from {{amassing}} {{one of the highest}} scores in Twenty20 Cup history with 223 for 9 - Ben Smith only taking 45 balls to smack 105 off the Glamorgan bowlers, with twelve fours and six sixes, as he lifted his career Twenty20 average from 15 to 20.62. The partnership of 149 with Graeme Hick was enough to win the match for Worcestershire, as Glamorgan never quite got the hang of Shoaib Akhtar - who bowled two overs for 14 with a no-ball and a wide. Glamorgan ended up only losing five wickets, but 224 was always <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask,</b> and they finished with a total 186 for 5.|$|E

25|$|New Zealand, {{with only}} four front-line bowlers, {{were able to}} contain England's batsmen but {{struggled}} to dismiss them. Centuries by Len Hutton and Denis Compton ensured a large score, but England made only 307 runs on the first day, Cowie taking five wickets, and Burtt mopped up the tail on the Monday morning to claim five also. Trevor Bailey, in his first Test, troubled the early batsmen with his pace, and the fourth wicket was down at 80. But Donnelly and Smith put on 120 and Smith went on to score 96. A last-wicket partnership between Mooney and Cowie put on 57 {{and went into the}} last morning, but Cowie was injured and could not bowl in England's second innings. Fast scoring by Bill Edrich and George Mann, and less fast by an injured Cyril Washbrook, who scored 103, led to a declaration. But 299 to win in 150 minutes was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> and Sutcliffe, Scott and Smith got batting practice as the game petered out.|$|E

[...] As one sports writer argued, [...] "Is it <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> for a system that gets it right every time" [...] instead of getting it right 4 out of 5 times? It {{is interesting to note}} that FBS football is the only sport in which the NCAA has not mandated a specific bracketed playoff system, with even Division I FCS conducting a playoff every year.|$|E
60|$|Both Mr Haredale and the worthy vintner {{were too}} amazed and <b>too</b> <b>much</b> hurried <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> any further questions, so {{followed}} their conductors in silence. It seemed, from a short whispering which presently ensued {{between them and}} the vintner relative to the best way of escape, that they had entered by the back-door, with the connivance of John Grueby, who watched outside with the key in his pocket, and whom they had taken into their confidence. A party of the crowd coming up that way, just as they entered, John had double-locked the door again, and made off for the soldiers, so that means of retreat was cut off from under them.|$|R

60|$|The {{woman was}} at first {{surprised}} and distrustful. But on Miss Halcombe's declaring that she only wanted to put some questions which she was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> agitated <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> at that moment, {{and that she had}} no intention of misleading the nurse into any dereliction of duty, the woman took the money, and proposed three o'clock on the next day as the time for the interview. She might then slip out for half an hour, after the patients had dined, and she would meet the lady in a retired place, outside the high north wall which screened the grounds of the house. Miss Halcombe had only time to assent, and to whisper to her sister that she should hear from her on the next day, when the proprietor of the Asylum joined them. He noticed his visitor's agitation, which Miss Halcombe accounted for by saying that her interview with Anne Catherick had a little startled her at first. She took her leave as soon after as possible--that is to say, as soon as she could summon courage to force herself from the presence of her unfortunate sister.|$|R
40|$|The {{majority}} of economic decisions are forward looking and thus involve expectations of future outcomes. Understanding the expectations that individuals have is thus of crucial importance to designing and evaluating policies in health, education, finance, migration, social protection, {{and many other}} areas. However, the {{majority of}} developing country surveys are static in nature and many do not elicit subjective expectations of individuals. Possible reasons given for not collecting this information include fears that poor, illiterate individuals do not understand probability concepts, that it takes far <b>too</b> <b>much</b> time <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> such questions, or that the answers add little value. This paper provides a critical review and new analysis of subjective expectations data from developing countries and refutes each of these concerns. We find that people in developing countries can generally understand and answer probabilistic questions, such questions are not prohibitive in time <b>to</b> <b>ask,</b> and the expectations are useful predictors of future behavior and economic decisions. The paper discusses the different methods used for eliciting such information, the key methodological issues involved, and the open research questions. The available evidence suggests that collecting expectations data is both feasible and valuable, suggesting {{that it should be}} incorporated into more developing country surveys...|$|R

She was somewhat beyond middle-age, and stoutly, even squarely, built, which gave her a masculine appearance; but she had grown so timid since Miss Kitty's death that when she spoke you felt that either her figure or her manner must have been intended for someone else. In conversation she had a way of ending a sentence in the middle which gave her a reputation of being [...] "thro'ither," [...] though an artificial tooth was the cause. It was slightly loose, and had she not at times shut her mouth suddenly, and then done something with her tongue, an accident might have happened. This tooth fascinated Tommy, and once when she was talking he cried, excitedly, [...] "Quick, it's coming!" [...] whereupon her mouth snapped close, and she turned pink in the blue-and-white room.|$|R
60|$|Now {{the reason}} why our fathers did not make marriage, in the middle-aged and static sense, the subject of their plays was a very simple one; it was that a play is a very bad place for {{discussing}} that topic. You cannot easily make a good drama out of {{the success or failure}} of a marriage, just as you could not make a good drama out of the growth of an oak tree or the decay of an empire. As Polonius very reasonably observed, it is too long. A happy love-affair will make a drama simply because it is dramatic; it depends on an ultimate yes or no. But a happy marriage is not dramatic; perhaps it would be less happy if it were. The essence of a romantic heroine is that she asks herself an intense question; but the essence of a sensible wife is that she is <b>much</b> <b>too</b> sensible <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> herself any questions at all. All the things that make monogamy a success are in their nature undramatic things, the silent growth of an instinctive confidence, the common wounds and victories, the accumulation of customs, the rich maturing of old jokes. Sane marriage is an untheatrical thing; it is therefore not surprising that most modern dramatists have devoted themselves to insane marriage.|$|R

60|$|HOPE. He bid {{me go to}} Him and see. Then I said it was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> for me <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> for. But he said No, for I {{was invited}} to come. Then {{he gave me a}} book of Jesus' own writing to {{encourage}} me the more freely to come; and he said concerning that book, that every word and letter thereof stood firmer than heaven and earth. Then I asked him what I must do when I came; and he told me I must entreat on my knees, with all my heart and soul, the Father to reveal Him to me. Then I asked him further how I must make my prayer to Him; and he said, Go, and thou shalt find Him upon a mercy-seat, where He sits all the year long to give pardon and forgiveness to them that come. I told him that I knew not what to say when I came; and he bid me say to this effect: God be merciful to me a sinner, and make me to know and believe in Jesus Christ; for I see that if His righteousness had not been, or I have not faith in that righteousness, I am utterly cast away. Lord, I have heard that Thou art a merciful God, and hast given that Thy Son Jesus Christ should be the Saviour of the world; and, moreover, that Thou art willing to bestow Him upon such a poor sinner as I am. And I am a sinner indeed. Lord, take therefore this opportunity, and show Thy grace in the salvation of my soul, through Thy Son Jesus Christ. Amen.|$|R
6000|$|Almost {{from the}} first it was {{apparent}} that the people of the city were defeated. I might have thought them even good, only I had the other troop before my eyes to correct my standard, and remind me continually of [...] "the little more, and how much it is." [...] Perceiving themselves worsted, the choir of Butaritari grew confused, blundered, and broke down; amid this hubbub of unfamiliar intervals I should not myself have recognised the slip, but the audience were quick to catch it, and to jeer. To crown all, the Makin company began a dance of truly superlative merit. I know not what it was about, I was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> absorbed <b>to</b> <b>ask.</b> In one act a part of the chorus, squealing in some strange falsetto, produced very much the effect of our orchestra; in another, the dancers, leaping like jumping-jacks, with arms extended, passed through and through each other's ranks with extraordinary speed, neatness, and humour. A more laughable effect I never saw; in any European theatre it would have brought the house down, and the island audience roared with laughter and applause. This filled up the measure for the rival company, and they forgot themselves and decency. After each act or figure of the ballet, the performers pause a moment standing, and the next is introduced by the clapping of hands in triplets. Not {{until the end of the}} whole ballet do they sit down, which is the signal for the rivals to stand up. But now all rules were to be broken. During the interval following on this great applause, the company of Butaritari leaped suddenly to their feet and most unhandsomely began a performance of their own. It was strange to see the men of Makin staring; I have seen a tenor in Europe stare with the same blank dignity into a hissing theatre; but presently, to my surprise, they sobered down, gave up the unsung remainder of their ballet, resumed their seats, and suffered their ungallant adversaries to go on and finish. Nothing would suffice. Again, at the first interval, Butaritari unhandsomely cut in; Makin, irritated in turn, followed the example; and the two companies of dancers remained permanently standing, continuously clapping hands, and regularly cutting across each other at each pause. I expected blows to begin with any moment; and our position in the midst was highly unstrategical. But the Makin people had a better thought; and upon a fresh interruption turned and trooped out of the house. We followed them, first because these were the artists, second because they were guests and had been scurvily ill-used. A large population of our neighbours did the same, so that the causeway was filled from end to end by the procession of deserters; and the Butaritari choir was left to sing for its own pleasure in an empty house, having gained the point and lost the audience. It was surely fortunate that there was no one drunk; but, drunk or sober, where else would a scene so irritating have concluded without blows? ...|$|R
60|$|The {{morning after}} Francie had passed {{with such an}} air from Gaston's sight and left him planted in the salon--he had {{remained}} ten minutes, {{to see if she}} would reappear, and then had marched out of the hotel--she received by the first post a letter from him, written the evening before. It conveyed his deep regret that their meeting that day should have been of so painful, so unnatural a character, and the hope that she didn't consider, as her strange behaviour had seemed to suggest, that SHE had anything to complain of. There was <b>too</b> <b>much</b> he wanted <b>to</b> say, and above all <b>too</b> <b>much</b> he wanted <b>to</b> <b>ask,</b> for him <b>to</b> consent to the indefinite postponement of a necessary interview. There were explanations, assurances, de part et d'autre, with which it was manifestly impossible that either of them should dispense. He would therefore propose that she should see him again, and not be wanting in patience to that end, late on the morrow. He didn't propose an earlier moment because his hands were terribly full at home. Frankly speaking, the state of things there was of the worst. Jane and her husband had just arrived and had made him a violent, an unexpected scene. Two of the French newspapers had got hold of the article and had given the most perfidious extracts. His father hadn't stirred out of the house, hadn't put his foot inside a club, for more than a week. Marguerite and Maxime were immediately to start for England on an indefinite absence. They couldn't face their life in Paris. For himself he was in the breach, fighting hard and making, on her behalf, asseverations it was impossible for him to believe, in spite of the dreadful defiant confession she had appeared to throw at him in the morning, that she wouldn't virtually confirm. He would come in as soon after nine as possible; the day up to that time would be stiff in the Cours la Reine, and he begged her in the meantime not to doubt of his perfect tenderness. So far from her having caused it at all to shrink, he had never yet felt her to have, in his affection, such a treasure of indulgence to draw upon.|$|R
