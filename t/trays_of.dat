5|$|The term iftar has a {{different}} meaning in Ramadan where {{it is used to}} describe the 'breaking of fasting' unlike its common meaning of breakfast in the morning. Iftar begins with soup, either made from lentils, vegetables or freekeh. Shurbat freekeh ("freekeh soup") is made from cracked, green wheat cooked in chicken broth. There is a wide variety of meals served during iftar, ranging from small plates or bowls vegetable-based courses or saniyyehs (large plates or <b>trays)</b> <b>of</b> a particular meat. Common small dishes on the dinner table are bamia—a name for okra in tomato paste, mloukhiyeh—a corchorus stew—or maqali, an array of fried tomatoes, aubergines, potatoes, peppers and zucchini. Pilaf or plain freekeh are normally served alongside the dinner meat. Each household prepares extra food to provide for their neighbors and the less fortunate—who must receive an equal version of the food eaten at home.|$|E

25|$|Also on {{the prairie}} {{is a series of}} candle holders called 'brulières' where pilgrims can place candles of varying sizes.

The brulières are tended by feutiers, attendants whose job is to ensure candles are burnt safely and evenly and to remove the <b>trays</b> <b>of</b> melted wax which collects under each brulière.|$|E

25|$|Prior to Super Bowl XXXVI, Superdome {{officials}} considered installing natural grass for the game. The proposed installation {{method was}} comparable {{to what had}} been used at the Silverdome during the 1994 FIFA World Cup, and at Giants Stadium from 2000 to 2002. The plan called for large <b>trays</b> <b>of</b> grass to be grown and cultivated outdoors, then brought inside the dome and placed on {{the field for the}} game. In the end, cost and quality concerns prompted stadium and league officials to abandon the project.|$|E
25|$|During the 2015 season, a {{permanent}} artificial surface was installed at NRG Stadium. The Texans {{had used a}} natural surface since the stadium opened, using a system of <b>trays</b> <b>of</b> sod similar to one used at Giants Stadium in its experiment with using a grass surface. In recent years, the stadium installed artificial turf to be used during {{high school and college}} games while keeping the grass for Texans games. After the Texans' home opener, complaints about the field conditions finally led to the installation of the artificial surface for Texans games. The surface brand is UBU Speed, which is part of Act Global.|$|E
25|$|By nature Duệ Tông was {{an arrogant}} and hard-headed ruler who ignored the advice from {{mandarins}} {{about the power}} of Champa's army, therefore right after the enthronement he began to prepare a military campaign in the southern border against Chế Bồng Nga's troop. Another factor that reinforced the Emperor's decision was the refusal of Chế Bồng Nga to pay tribute for Đại Việt, afterwards historical books reveal that actually king of Champa did send fifteen <b>trays</b> <b>of</b> gold to Đại Việt but Đỗ Tử Bình kept the gold for himself while reported to royal court that there was not any tribute from Champa. After some skirmishes caused by Champa, Duệ Tông began his decisive campaign in December 1376 in which the Emperor personally commanded with the assistance of Hồ Quý Ly and Đỗ Tử Bình. Eventually, the campaign was ended by a disastrous defeat of Đại Việt's army in Đồ Bàn Battle when the Emperor with many high-ranking madarins and generals of the Trần Dynasty were killed by Champa's force. On the contrary, Hồ Quý Ly and Đỗ Tử Bình survived because Quý Ly, who took charge of logistics, and Tử Bình, who commanded the rearguard, both ran away from the battle instead of trying to rescue the Emperor. Afterwards, Đỗ Tử Bình was only dismissed to the position of plain soldier by the order of Nghệ Tông while Hồ Quý Ly even did not have to face with any charge.|$|E

25|$|Another {{factor that}} {{reinforced}} the Emperor's {{decision for the}} decisive military campaign Champa was the refusal of Chế Bồng Nga to pay tribute for Đại Việt, afterwards historical books reveal that actually king of Champa did send fifteen <b>trays</b> <b>of</b> gold to Đại Việt but Đỗ Tử Bình, official responsible for the southern border, kept the gold for himself while reported to royal court {{that there was not}} any tribute from Champa. In December 1376, Duệ Tông personally commanded an army of 12.000 Đại Việt soldiers operating towards Champa while Hồ Quý Ly took charge of the campaign's logistics and Đỗ Tử Bình conducted the reargoard. On January 23 of Lunar calendar, 1377, Duệ Tông's army arrived at Thị Nại near the capital of Champa Đồ Bàn. In a plot of luring the opponent to his trap in Đồ Bàn, Chế Bồng Nga had a small mandarin pretend to surrender who made Duệ Tông believe that Champa's army had fled from the empty capital. The next day, Duệ Tông led his army directly to the ambush that Chế Bồng Nga prepared for him. As a result, Trần army was heavily defeated in this Battle of Đồ Bàn where the Emperor himself was killed in action with many other high-ranking mandarins, generals and seventy percent of his troops. On the contrary, Hồ Quý Ly and Đỗ Tử Bình survived because they both ran away from the battle instead of trying to rescue the Emperor. Afterwards, Đỗ Tử Bình was only dismissed to the position of plain soldier by the order of Nghệ Tông while Hồ Quý Ly even did not have to face with any charge.|$|E
500|$|Like {{the other}} large and {{successful}} night clubs in Harlem, the Cotton Club and Connie's Inn, Smalls regularly showcased revues which featured the club's permanent staff of entertainers. Ed Smalls commissioned original {{music for the}} stage productions of the night club. Smalls Paradise was the only major Harlem night spot which was owned by an African-American and was racially integrated. [...] The other clubs admitted only white patrons unless the person was an African-American celebrity. [...] Smalls previously had some success in attracting a racially mixed clientele at his Sugar Cane Club with the quality entertainment and waiters who danced while balancing <b>trays</b> <b>of</b> drinks and sang during floor shows. [...] Beginning {{with the opening of}} Smalls Paradise, Smalls had his waiters dance the Charleston while serving guests; patrons were also served drinks by waiters on roller skates.|$|E
500|$|In 1978, Shaw earned acclaim for his {{performance}} as a judge in the stage debut of Whose Life Is It Anyway? at the Mermaid Theatre. The production won Laurence Olivier Awards for Best Play and Best Actor (Tom Conti). Although 73years old, Shaw did not let his age slow down his career. During the run of this production a mugger tried to steal his money, but Shaw chased him down, tackled him and recovered his property. Later that year, he was painted in the nude by his nephew, Brian Ocean. During his later years, Shaw suffered a physical disability that made him tremble, which had {{a negative impact on}} his television roles, particularly when handling cups or <b>trays</b> <b>of</b> drinks. One of his later television appearances was in The Old Curiosity Shop, a 1979 mini-series based on the novel by Charles Dickens. Around this time, he also voiced the part of Squire Beltham in a radio production of The Adventures of Harry Richmond, which the Daily Telegraph said was [...] "remembered with affection". He lent his voice to several radio performances, both Shakespearean and modern, including protagonist John Tanner in the five-hour Man and Superman by George Bernard Shaw.|$|E

2500|$|Prisons {{generally}} {{have to provide}} food for {{a large number of}} individuals, and thus are generally equipped with a large institutional kitchen. There are many security considerations, however, that are unique to the prison dining environment. For instance, cutlery equipment must be very carefully monitored and accounted for at all times, and the layout of prison kitchens must be designed in a way that allows staff to observe activity of the kitchen staff (who are usually prisoners). The quality of kitchen equipment varies from prison to prison, depending on when the prison was constructed, and the level of funding available to procure new equipment. Prisoners are often served food in a large cafeteria with rows of tables and benches that are securely attached to the floor. However, inmates that are locked in control units, or prisons that are on [...] "lockdown" [...] (where prisoners are made to remain in their cells all day) have <b>trays</b> <b>of</b> food brought to their cells. It is said that prison food of many developed countries is adequate to maintain health and dieting.|$|E
