40|$|The worm-face gear family, invented 60 years ago, {{contains}} in {{its structure}} several variants {{which have the}} following defining elements: <b>tapered</b> <b>worm,</b> reverse <b>tapered</b> <b>worm</b> and cylindrical worm. This type of gear can be realized with a single wheel and also in engagement with the second embodiment of the front worm wheels. This paper presents the matrix - vectorial mathematical model of the double worm-face gear with cylindrical worm and a graphical modeling {{which is based on}} the specific geometrical characteristics accomplished by means of the Autodesk Inventor 3 D modeling program. The applicability of the study, considering the solutions which it suggests, aims to create opportunities for the use of modern rapid prototyping and analysis of stress FEM technique...|$|E
5000|$|They are {{sometimes}} preserved within the voids of other organisms, for instance within empty hyolith conchs, within sponges, worm tubes {{and under the}} carapaces of bivalved arthropods, presumably in order to hide from predators or strong storm currents; or maybe whilst scavenging for food. [...] In {{the case of the}} <b>tapering</b> <b>worm</b> tubes Selkirkia, trilobites are always found with their heads directed towards the opening of the tube, suggesting that they reversed in; the absence of any moulted carapaces suggests that moulting was not their primary reason for seeking shelter.|$|R
50|$|The wacky rig is {{considered}} a simple but effective way to fish. Worms between four and six inches are generally used, but some use creature baits resembling crayfish and small fishes. Stick worms, those that have the same diameter throughout the length and a straight tail, are the most used, although <b>tapered</b> <b>worms</b> and tailed worms can be used. Stick worms are heavier, giving a more erratic action on the dive. Almost any hook can be used, as long as it's generally smaller than hooks used for texas rig and carolina rig, as large hooks may scare away potential bites from smaller fish. The hook is inserted {{through the middle of}} the plastic, leaving the end of the hook exposed. A thinner line than usual, from six to ten pound test, is used. Both monofilament fishing line and fluorocarbon may be used. These tackle heighten the chances of a bite. The two kinds of weights used are nail weights and ring weights. Nail weights are inserted through the head of the worm for different action and deeper fishing. With a nail as a weight, the lure will have an irregular action while gliding to the bottom. Ring weights are also used to fish at deeper depths, and they have the advantage of inserting the hook both through the worm and the ring simultaneously. Although fishing companies produce nail weights specifically for wacky rigging, one may use nails commonly found in tool boxes to save money. The weights allow for fishing at deeper depths, from ten up to forty feet. Any rods in general may be used. Longer rods allow for longer casts, but shorter rods give accuracy to the cast. Some anglers even use braid with a fluorocarbon leader.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comparative study done by FEM {{of the state}} of stresses and strains of a worm face gear with reverse <b>tapered</b> pinion, <b>worm</b> wheel which is made of different materials: ERTACETAL C, BRONZE and CAST IRON. The simulation of real physical phenomena engagement of screw-worm wheel is a sensitive issue that raises many problems. One of the methods allowing achievement of precise geometry of the structure would be considered as complete, is FEM. Considering the geometrical complexity of the analyzed structure, proceed to a simplification of the phenomenon of contact between worm-worm wheels. Thus, for a correct interpretation of the studied phenomenon, corresponding geometric data from a section plane of worm-worm wheel gear is an analysis of the action momentary contact between the worm-worm wheels. The theoretical evaluations are confirmed by the results obtained from the analysis and interpretation of experimental tests of the worm face gear with reverse tapered pinion studied...|$|R
50|$|P. maculata is an {{elongated}} slender <b>worm,</b> <b>tapering</b> slightly towards the posterior. The prostomium (head) bears {{a pair of}} antennae, a pair of eyes, two small palps and a large eversible proboscis. The first few body segments bear four pairs of long, tentacular cirri. Other body segments bear parapodia with flattened cirri, the dorsal ones being heart-shaped and conspicuous. The prostomium, the first body segment (which cannot be seen from above) and the second segment are colourless, {{the third and fourth}} segments are dark, and the fifth and remaining segments have dark spots centred on the overlap of the segments, as well as some dark colour {{at the side of the}} segments. The posterior of the prostomium has some yellow colouring, and there are yellow spots between the dark spots on the dorsal surface of the body. This worm can have as many as 250 segments and be up to 100 mm long.|$|R
