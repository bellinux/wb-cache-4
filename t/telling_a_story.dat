5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the last}} episode, Wirt and Greg wake up in a hospital, with Greg <b>telling</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> but being cut off before we can hear what it's about. As the scene ends, Greg's frog begins to glow, due to having eaten a magic bell in The Unknown, {{suggesting}} that there was at least some physical aspect to the story. The series ends with a slow montage of how Wirt and Greg affected the inhabitants of the Unknown.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{took place}} in September and October 2004. Although the story is set in 19th century Cardiff, the {{production}} was actually filmed in Swansea and Monmouth, as there were not enough Victorian-looking buildings left in Cardiff. Cardiff's New Theatre {{was used for the}} theatre in which Dickens is <b>telling</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> {{at the beginning of the}} episode. An empty Victorian children's home in Penarth was used for Sneed's parlour. Based on research of Victorian morgues, the production team selected red and sepia as the main color scheme.|$|E
5|$|While {{working on}} the picture book, Luna {{realized}} he missed <b>telling</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> panel by panel and {{decided to return to}} comics. He and his brother had decided to work on separate projects, so Luna pitched the idea of a young man who {{falls in love with a}} female android to Vaughn over dinner. Vaughn, who began writing and drawing romance comics in her youth, jumped at the opportunity.|$|E

5|$|As {{cinematic}} {{director of}} The Battle for Middle-earth II, Richard Taylor {{was responsible for}} designing the game's opening and closing sequences, as well as campaign and mission introductions and endings. As the first Electronic Arts video game to be given free rein on material from The Lord of the Rings universe, several lands, characters, and creatures from the books appear visually {{for the first time}} in the game's cut scenes. Taylor considered it essential to use good graphical and audio combinations when <b>telling</b> <b>a</b> <b>story,</b> and he was pleased to have Weaving on the project as the primary storyteller.|$|E
5|$|The turn of {{the decade}} brought Scorsese's {{black-and-white}} Raging Bull (cowritten by Schrader); an acknowledged masterpiece—the American Film Institute ranks it as the greatest American film of the 1980s and the fourth greatest of all time—it is also a retreat, <b>telling</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> of a boxer's moral self-destruction that recalls in both theme and visual ambience noir dramas such as Body and Soul (1947) and Champion (1949). From 1981, the popular Body Heat, {{written and directed by}} Lawrence Kasdan, invokes a different set of classic noir elements, this time in a humid, erotically charged Florida setting; its success confirmed the commercial viability of neo-noir, {{at a time when the}} major Hollywood studios were becoming increasingly risk averse. The mainstreaming of neo-noir is evident in such films as Black Widow (1987), Shattered (1991), and Final Analysis (1992). Few neo-noirs have made more money or more wittily updated the tradition of the noir double-entendre than Basic Instinct (1992), directed by Paul Verhoeven and written by Joe Eszterhas. The film also demonstrates how neo-noir's polychrome palette can reproduce many of the expressionistic effects of classic black-and-white noir. Poison Ivy (1992) makes use of similar devices executed in Basic Instinct, including a shady, seductive femme-fatale with ulterior motives.|$|E

25|$|Another {{impressive}} {{feature of}} the church is the collection of marble tombstones in the nave in which were buried important knights.

25|$|Each episode {{follows the}} same pattern: Rodge, the dumber of the two, arrives home. Originally the pair {{would get into}} bed but in recent seasons they sit at the kitchen table. They talk about what Rodge was doing, with Podge usually {{insulting}} him. This leads Podge on to <b>telling</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> (acted out by live actors) about some people (whose names are usually sexual innuendos, e.g. Enda Meshank, Chris Peacock, Ulick McGee) who inevitably come to an unpleasant end. Rodge interrupts the story with stupid comments and/or reference to masturbation. It ends with Podge punishing Rodge for no reason.|$|E
25|$|The Absolute Past has a {{function}} {{distinct from the}} Present Perfect. It is used for events which are distant from the present and no longer directly affect it, for example when <b>telling</b> <b>a</b> <b>story,</b> whereas the Present Perfect is used for more recent events which may have {{a direct impact on}} the present. The Absolute Past may at all times be replaced with the Present Perfect (but not vice versa). In many areas of Southern Italy, it is still used commonly in spoken language, whereas in Northern-Central Italy and Sardinia it is restricted to written language.|$|E
25|$|Writers {{attempted}} {{to respond to}} the new world in the post-World War I era. In the 1920s and 30s writers entirely unconnected with science fiction were exploring new ways of <b>telling</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> and new ways of treating time, space and experience in the narrative form. The posthumously published works of Franz Kafka (who died in 1924) and the works of modernist writers such as James Joyce, T. S. Eliot, Virginia Woolf and others featured stories in which time and individual identity could be expanded, contracted, looped and otherwise distorted. While this work was unconnected to science fiction as a genre, it did deal with the impact of modernity (technology, science, and change) upon people's lives, and decades later, during the New Wave movement, some modernist literary techniques entered science fiction.|$|E

25|$|Dan Sandshrew, {{the head}} of Equal Vision, {{said that there was}} a debate over the artwork for the album. Conley was unsure about what do with the artwork, and went along with Newman and Soloway's ideas. The cover artwork is of a high school party with Saves the Day shown as social outcasts sitting on a couch. The album booklet {{continues}} the outcast theme, <b>telling</b> <b>a</b> <b>story.</b> Sandshrew felt that cover would give the wrong impression, and Newman regretted it after the album was released. Conley said people told the band that they had sold out because the cover art featured their faces. The band, and Luke Hoverman, designed the concept with Frank Davidson providing the layout. The photographs were taken by Hoverman with assistance from Lenny Zimkus. The CD art features Gabe Saporta kissing a girl, while the back cover has actor James Ransone passed out on a couch.|$|E

500|$|... "Coming of Age" [...] {{examines}} {{themes of}} growing into adulthood, {{as well as}} ideas of gender and sexuality. In deliberate contrast to The Left Hand of Darkness, Le Guin's previous work which was set on the same fictional planet, Le Guin uses feminine pronouns for all the Gethenians {{when they are not}} in kemmer, and uses male or female pronouns for individuals in kemmer, depending on what sex they take on. She does the same in [...] "Winter's King", another short story set on Gethen and written many years after [...] "Left Hand". In addition, first-person narration discusses the difficulty of <b>telling</b> <b>a</b> <b>story</b> about people without fixed male or female characteristics, in a language that only has gendered pronouns.|$|E

[...] These [...] "Storytelling" [...] cards represent ingredients of a fairy tale, i.e. words or phrases {{that are likely}} to appear in fairy tales. [...] From a different deck of cards, each player is also dealt a single [...] "Happy Ever After" [...] ending card, to be kept secret from other players until it is used. [...] The object of the game for each player is to use their cards in <b>telling</b> <b>a</b> <b>story,</b> finishing the story by using their Happy Ever After card.|$|E
