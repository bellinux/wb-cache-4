5|$|A {{total of}} 800 {{students}} from both Platte Canyon High School {{and the nearby}} Fitzsimmons Middle School were rapidly evacuated. Morrison's demands were unknown, although police confirmed that his primary concern was a request for the police <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>away.</b> All students, except the hostages, were safely evacuated by 12:10 p.m. and by 3:00 p.m. all had been taken to Deer Creek Elementary School. Parents were able to gain little information from authorities, who remained silent regarding the issue while the crisis continued.|$|E
25|$|The tit-for-tat {{inability}} of either side <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>away</b> from conflict, {{for fear of}} being perceived as weak or as cooperating with the enemy, has been the source of many conflicts throughout history.|$|E
25|$|C. molossus {{is often}} {{considered}} to be one the most docile rattlesnake ever, because of their placid and curious attitude. Bites rarely occur because of this. They rely mostly on camouflage to avoid trouble. C. molossus normally tries <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>away</b> when confronted, but will rattle when cornered and threatened.|$|E
60|$|Hannibal, in wrath, {{crouching}} for a spring, {{had lifted}} his head. The consequent blow {{on his nose}} forced his head down to the floor, and the king of beasts, nose still <b>to</b> floor, <b>backed</b> <b>away</b> with mouth-snarls and throat-and-chest noises.|$|R
60|$|Mike {{felt that}} he was in for it now. He had not {{sufficient}} ease of manner <b>to</b> <b>back</b> gracefully <b>away</b> and disappear, so he said that there was something. In point of fact, he wanted a bed-sitting room.|$|R
60|$|With a low, angry yelp he turned, {{standing}} motionless a few seconds, {{during which}} time Jet continued <b>to</b> <b>back</b> farther <b>away</b> from the house in order {{that there might be}} less chance the noise of the conflict would be overheard.|$|R
25|$|Demosthenes and Eurymedon then {{arrived with}} 73 ships and 5,000 hoplites. On their arrival, 80 Syracusan ships {{attacked}} 75 of the Athenian ships in their harbour. This battle {{went on for}} two days with no result, until the Syracusans pretended <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>away</b> and attacked the Athenians while they were eating. However, only seven Athenian ships were sunk.|$|E
25|$|The {{plane had}} trouble leaving the gate when the ground {{services}} tow motor {{could not get}} traction on the ice. For approximately 30 to 90 seconds, the crew attempted <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>away</b> from the gate using the reverse thrust of the engines, which proved futile. Boeing operations bulletins had warned against using reverse thrust in those kinds of conditions.|$|E
25|$|On stardate 1512.2, the Federation {{starship}} USS Enterprise, {{commanded by}} Captain James T. Kirk, finishes a {{third day of}} star mapping when novice navigator Lt. Dave Bailey (Anthony Call) spots a large spinning colored cube floating in space. First Officer Spock orders Helmsman Sulu to sound an alert. Chief Engineer Scott cannot explain how the cube works. A nervous and inexperienced Bailey advocates attacking it with phasers. Kirk instead orders the ship <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>away</b> from the object. The cube comes even closer and emits harmful radiation and Kirk reluctantly destroys it.|$|E
5000|$|In April 2013 she {{publicly}} confronted Sheikh Sadiq al-Ahmar in {{the conference}} hall of Yemen's National Dialogue Conference: Ahmar seemed <b>to</b> be <b>backing</b> <b>away</b> from appointing feminist Nabila al-Zubair {{as chair of the}} body deciding the future of the disputed city of Sa'dah until Basha gave him this [...] "public flaying".|$|R
60|$|Rollo {{laughed at}} this, {{but in a}} minute Jonas called to him <b>to</b> stand <b>back,</b> <b>away</b> from the bank; and then, after a few strokes more, {{the top of the}} tree began to bend slowly over, and then it fell faster and faster, until it came down with a great crash, {{directly}} across the brook.|$|R
60|$|Just at this time, Beechnut's head {{appeared}} {{coming up}} the ladder. He called upon the boys <b>to</b> come <b>back,</b> <b>away</b> from the hen, while {{he went up to}} see. She was upon a nest there, squatted down very low, and with her wings spread wide as if trying to cover a great nest full of eggs.|$|R
25|$|The growing {{power of}} Wei caused Zhao <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>away</b> from the alliance. In 383 it moved its capital to Handan and {{attacked}} the small state of Wey. Wey appealed to Wei which attacked Zhao {{on the western}} side. Being in danger, Zhao called in Chu. As usual, Chu used this as a pretext to annex territory to its north, but the diversion allowed Zhao to occupy a part of Wei. This conflict {{marked the end of}} the power of the united Jins and the beginning a period of shifting alliances and wars on several fronts.|$|E
25|$|An {{aggressive}} lower order batsman {{who usually}} batted at No. 11, Muralitharan {{was known for}} his tendency <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>away</b> to leg and slog. Sometimes, he could be troublesome for bowlers because of his unorthodox and adventurous ways. Once, in a Test match against England, while playing Alex Tudor, he moved back towards his leg stump trying to hook the ball and ended up lying on the ground sideways after the shot. He was infamously run out in a match against New Zealand when he left his crease to congratulate Kumar Sangakkara, who had just scored a single to reach his century; the New Zealand fielder had not yet returned the ball to the wicketkeeper, so the ball was still in play. His highest Test score of 67 came against India at Kandy in 2001, including three sixes and five fours. He made valuable scores on occasion, including 30 runs against England at the Oval in 1998, including 5 fours, 38 runs (4 fours, 1 six) against England at Galle in 2003, 43 runs (5 fours, 3 sixes) against Australia at Kandy in 2004 36 runs against the West Indies at Colombo in 2005, and his highest-ever ODI score, 33 not out (4 fours and 2 sixes off 16 balls) against Bangladesh in the final of the 2009 Tri-Series in Bangladesh. In the latter match, Muralitharan's effort, which included three fours and a six off one over, {{played a key role in}} Sri Lanka winning the match and series after the first eight overs saw them reduced to 6 for 5, the lowest score ever recorded in an ODI at the fall of the fifth wicket. Muralitharan has a strike rate close to 70 in Test cricket and scored over 55% of his Test runs in fours and sixes.|$|E
500|$|In 2005 The Guardian {{characterized}} {{the game as}} [...] "The last genuine classic to come from LucasArts, the company that helped define adventure games, Tim Schafer's noir-pastiche follows skull-faced Manny Calavera through a bureaucratic parody of the Land of the Dead. With a look that takes from both Mexican mythology and art deco, Grim Fandango is as unique an artistic statement as mainstream gaming has managed to offer. While loved by devotees, its limited sales prompted LucasArts <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>away</b> from original adventures to simply exploit franchises." ...|$|E
60|$|Tarzan, too, had vanished, {{as he had}} a way of doing, to the mystification of the blacks. Then Momaya's eyes lighted upon Rabba Kega. The village witch-doctor saw {{something}} in those eyes of hers which boded no good <b>to</b> him, and <b>backed</b> <b>away.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, of course, but I {{would like}} a sail back in a pilot-boat," [...] said Scott, and Harry Alden agreed with him. Tom Myers and his brother George wanted <b>to</b> go <b>back</b> right <b>away.</b>|$|R
50|$|Sexual {{identity}} {{therapy was}} designed by Warren Throckmorton and Mark Yarhouse, and was endorsed by Robert L. Spitzer, prior <b>to</b> Spitzer's <b>backing</b> <b>away</b> from this belief that he had proven reparative therapy at times successful. Its purpose is to help patients line up their sexual identity with their beliefs and values. Therapy involves four phases: (1) assessment, (2) advanced or expanded informed consent, (3) psychotherapy, and (4) social integration of a valued sexual identity.|$|R
500|$|If disturbed, {{they will}} hiss loudly and continuously, {{adopting}} a tightly coiled defensive posture with the fore {{part of their}} body held in a taut [...] "S" [...] shape. At the same time, they may attempt <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>away</b> from the threat towards cover. They may strike suddenly and fast, to the side as easily as forwards, before returning quickly to the defensive position, ready to strike again. During a strike, {{the force of the}} impact is so strong, and the long fangs penetrate so deeply, that prey items are often killed by the physical trauma alone. The fangs apparently can penetrate soft leather.|$|E
500|$|At {{approximately}} 11 PM, {{the ship}} encountered a heavy fog, and ran aground into Middle Anacapa Island (approximately 400 miles from port). [...] Her speed {{at the time}} of the wreck was estimated at [...] [...] She struck the island bow first, and when Capt. Blunt attempted <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>away</b> the stern was struck, removing the ship's rudder. [...] With the ship taking on massive amounts of water and unable to steer, all aboard, perhaps as many as 500 people, began scrambling for land. The ship was completely evacuated in approximately two hours, and the survivors spent the first night camped on a pinnacle of rock that measured [...] [...] The next day they moved to a larger piece of land on the island.|$|E
500|$|Rohrer later {{transferred}} {{the themes of}} Deception onto a framework around corporate espionage and the blood diamond trade. Though not particularly concerned about blood diamonds, and wary of the game being perceived as a finger-wagging exercise, {{he felt that the}} setting would give an [...] "extra oomph to the game's seedy mechanics". Instead of being an overt protest against the blood diamond trade, the game would explore the psychology of the industry through its game mechanics, causing players to reflect after a game on their decisions made within it. Majesco greenlit this, and in July 2009, a publishing contract was signed. Rohrer began work on Diamond Trust of London as a pen and paper prototype to iron out the design before committing to code. By December, the game was in a fully playable state, lacking only the soundtrack and tutorial. Majesco, however, decided <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>away</b> from a physical cartridge release, and pushed instead for a DSiWare download version. Rohrer disagreed, believing that the smaller DSiWare market would limit the game's audience; Majesco, on the other hand, was not willing to invest in the manufacturing of cartridges without strong pre-order numbers. The company made the game available to GameStop to gauge pre-order interest, stating that 3,000pre-orders would be necessary for a cartridge release. [...] Diamond Trust generated only 23pre-orders, and in 2010, the Majesco agreement was terminated.|$|E

50|$|Desmond left Kit Carson {{and owned}} a {{restaurant}} in Golden, Colorado, then later a saloon in Georgetown, Colorado. He went <b>back</b> <b>to</b> work for the railroad, and by 1872 he had married and settled in Pueblo, Colorado. Not long afterward he began working as a deputy for the Pueblo County, Colorado Sheriffs Office. He quickly developed a dangerous reputation, due mostly to his tendency <b>to</b> never <b>back</b> <b>away</b> from a fight. Those who remembered him often indicated that he almost welcomed a fight. This also led to his having a reputation for police brutality.|$|R
60|$|Kit looked about, {{but could}} not see the launch. The dark mass was a thick belt of trees, but he did not know, and did not think Mayne knew, where they were, and the easy motion {{indicated}} that the tide was carrying the steamer on. Much to his relief, the indistinct wall of forest seemed <b>to</b> bend <b>back,</b> <b>away</b> from the sea. It looked as if they were entering the lagoon; and then he heard the telegraph and the rattle of rudder chains.|$|R
2500|$|The {{historian}} David Brion Davis {{states that}} {{in the years after}} 1785 and Jefferson's return from Paris, the most notable thing about his position on slavery was his [...] "immense silence." [...] Davis and other historians believe that, in addition to having internal conflicts about slavery, Jefferson wanted to keep his personal situation private; for this reason, he chose <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>away</b> from working to end or ameliorate slavery.|$|E
2500|$|In effect, {{the suburbs}} would receive an {{additional}} seat to reflect their rapid population growth. Democratic state chairman, Otis B.

I've never said you have to add a seat here or there. That's been George Bloom." ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 7, 1953, the {{committee}} battled for 90 minutes over the appointment, with McCarthy refusing <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>away</b> from Matthews and {{claiming that he}} was a [...] "non-professional" [...] member of the staff that could be hired or fired at his sole discretion, while the Democratic minority cited the provisions of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, which placed the hiring and firing of committee staff within the purview of the majority of {{the committee}}.|$|E
60|$|Everything had {{happened}} at once--the blow, the counter-blow, the squeal of agony from the porcupine, the big cat's squall of sudden hurt and astonishment. One Eye half arose in his excitement, his ears up, his tail straight out and quivering behind him. The lynx's bad temper {{got the best}} of her. She sprang savagely at the thing that had hurt her. But the porcupine, squealing and grunting, with disrupted anatomy trying feebly to roll up into its ball-protection, flicked out its tail again, and again the big cat squalled with hurt and astonishment. Then she fell <b>to</b> <b>backing</b> <b>away</b> and sneezing, her nose bristling with quills like a monstrous pin-cushion. She brushed her nose with her paws, trying to dislodge the fiery darts, thrust it into the snow, and rubbed it against twigs and branches, and all the time leaping about, ahead, sidewise, up and down, in a frenzy of pain and fright.|$|R
2500|$|Five level sensors in {{the bottom}} of each S-II {{propellant}} tank were armed during S-II flight, allowing any two to trigger S-II cutoff and staging when they were uncovered. One second after the second stage cut off it separated and several seconds later the third stage ignited. Solid fuel retro-rockets mounted on the interstage {{at the top of the}} S-II fired <b>to</b> <b>back</b> it <b>away</b> from the S-IVB. The S-II impacted about [...] from the launch site.|$|R
50|$|Fairfax and the New Model Army, after {{reducing}} Bridgwater, {{had turned}} <b>back</b> <b>to</b> clear <b>away</b> the Dorsetshire Clubmen and to besiege Sherborne Castle. On {{the completion of}} this task, it had been decided to besiege Bristol.|$|R
2500|$|Harold Cardinal and the Indian Chiefs of Alberta {{responded with}} a {{document}} entitled [...] "Citizens Plus" [...] but {{commonly known as the}} [...] "Red Paper". In it, they explained Status Indians' widespread opposition to Chrétien's proposal. Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau and the Liberals began <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>away</b> from the 1969 White Paper, particularly after the Calder case decision in 1973. [...] After the Canadian Supreme Court recognized that indigenous rights and treaty rights were not extinguished, a process was begun to resolve land claims and treaty rights and is ongoing today.|$|E
2500|$|Immediately {{after the}} collision, Texaco Massachusetts began <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>away,</b> {{allowing}} naphtha to spill from Alva Cape and ignite, likely {{from the engine}} of Esso Vermont. [...] A crew member from Texaco Massachusetts later testified that the master of his ship, Captain Richard Pinder, had ordered fire hoses deployed to spray foam, but only one had worked. [...] The following fire burned until about 22:35, when firefighters from fireboats and the Staten Island fire department extinguished it. [...] In addition to fireboats, small craft from the police department and Coast Guard were dispatched to the scene, along with seven tugboats.|$|E
2500|$|The {{infomercial}} for the 80-minute tape included {{footage of}} Falwell interviewing a silhouetted journalist {{who claimed to}} be afraid for his life. The journalist accused Clinton of orchestrating the deaths of several reporters and personal confidants who had gotten too close to his illegalities. The silhouetted journalist was subsequently revealed to be Patrick Matrisciana, the producer of the video and president of Citizens for Honest Government. [...] "Obviously, I'm not an investigative reporter", Matrisciana admitted to investigative journalist Murray Waas. Later, Falwell seemed <b>to</b> <b>back</b> <b>away</b> from personally trusting the video. In an interview for the 2005 documentary The Hunting of the President, Falwell admitted, [...] "to this day I do not know the accuracy of the claims made in The Clinton Chronicles." ...|$|E
60|$|Terror, hot terror, {{began to}} play about Byrne’s heart like a tongue of flame that touches and withdraws before it turns a thing <b>to</b> ashes. He <b>backed</b> <b>away</b> from the body {{as far as he}} could, then came forward stealthily casting fearful glances to steal another look at the bruised forehead. There would perhaps be such a faint bruise on his own forehead—before the morning.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{countries}} developed {{more options}} of value {{for this type}} of instrument than others. However, a 2005 study reported that some of the risks related to longevity are poorly managed [...] "practically everywhere" [...] due <b>to</b> governments <b>backing</b> <b>away</b> from defined benefit promises and insurance companies being reluctant to sell genuine life annuities because of fears that life expectancy will go up. Longevity insurance is now becoming more common in the UK and the U.S. (see Future of annuites, below) while Chile, in comparison to the U.S., has had a very large life annuity market for 20 years.|$|R
5000|$|The {{pendulum}} began <b>to</b> swing <b>back</b> <b>away</b> from consolidation {{toward the}} formation of smaller boutique firms with the downturn {{of the economy in}} late 2008 and early 2009 as recession-proof niche practices began to separate themselves from the struggling behemoths. For example, Washington, D.C.-based Hautsfeld LLP spun out of Cohen Milstein and Birmingham, Alabama-based Frohsin & Barger, LLC spun out of the southern regional firm Baker Donelson. Both Hausfeld and Frohsin & Barger have been cited as examples by the National Law Journal as [...] "somewhat recession-proof" [...] boutiques. [...] Other boutiques, such as Waesche, Sheinbaum & O'Regan, have dissolved.|$|R
