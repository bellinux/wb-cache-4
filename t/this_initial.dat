5|$|A {{total of}} eighty T28E1s were {{produced}} from July to August 1942 by White, {{all of which}} had a mount lacking protection for the gun combination and crew. After <b>this</b> <b>initial</b> run the vehicle gained an armored mount and went into production as the M15 CGMC. Some of the T28E1s still in service had their 37 mm guns removed and were converted into M3A1 Halftracks.|$|E

Several small skirmishes and massacres ensued over the next month in northern Illinois and southern Wisconsin before the militia regained public confidence in battles at Bloody Lake and Waddams Grove.|$|E

5|$|As {{initially}} conceived, MSR was a short-range {{system for}} tracking Sprint missiles before they {{appeared in the}} MAR's view, as well as offering a secondary target and jammer tracking role. In <b>this</b> <b>initial</b> concept, the MSR would have limited processing power, just enough to create tracks to feed back to the MAR. In the anti-jamming role, each MAR and MSR would measure the angle to the jammer.|$|E
5|$|However, since <b>this</b> <b>initial</b> skepticism, {{biologists}} {{have come to}} a consensus that declines in amphibian populations are a real and severe threat to biodiversity. This consensus emerged with {{an increase in the number}} of studies that monitored amphibian populations, direct observation of mass mortality in pristine sites that lacked apparent cause, and an awareness that declines in amphibian populations are truly global in nature.|$|E

5|$|Most enzyme {{kinetics}} studies concentrate on <b>this</b> <b>initial,</b> approximately linear part of enzyme reactions. However, {{it is also}} possible to measure the complete reaction curve and fit this data to a non-linear rate equation. This way of measuring enzyme reactions is called progress-curve analysis. This approach is useful as an alternative to rapid kinetics when the initial rate is too fast to measure accurately.|$|E
5|$|The species also occurs {{outside its}} natural range in Australia, {{where it can}} be found in the warm {{effluent}} of power stations in Victoria, and in tropical Queensland. It has also been captured in Perth, Western Australia, although <b>this</b> <b>initial</b> capture also resulted in its eradication. In addition to Australia, the species has been introduced to Réunion, Japan, Mexico, Colombia, Taiwan, and the USA.|$|E

5|$|After {{handling}} audio engineering for {{the recording}} of Achtung Baby, Robbie Adams was invited by U2 to manage sound mixing on the Zoo TV Tour. Adams also recorded the group's tour soundchecks. In January 1993, the band asked him to compile these recordings and create loops of interesting parts that they could play to in the studio. After Adams spent a few weeks assembling loops, the group entered The Factory in Dublin that February to begin composing rough demos. Bono and The Edge were most involved during <b>this</b> <b>initial</b> demoing process, which lasted six weeks.|$|E

5|$|André conferred with General Clinton, {{who gave}} him broad {{authority}} to pursue Arnold's offer.

Letters were to be passed through the women's circle that Peggy Arnold was a part of, but only Peggy would be aware that some letters contained instructions that were to {{be passed on to}} André, written in both code and invisible ink, using Stansbury as the courier.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to growing}} {{concerns}} in the public, in 2001 the Centers for Disease Control and the National Institutes of Health asked the U.S. National Academy of Science's (NAS) Institute of Medicine to establish an independent expert committee to review hypotheses about existing and emerging immunization safety concerns. <b>This</b> <b>initial</b> report found that based on indirect and incomplete evidence available at the time, there was inadequate evidence to accept or reject a thiomersal-autism link, though it was biologically plausible.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} seven years {{following}} 1988, when the CF-18 was being delivered, the squadron ran six-month full-squadron courses from which the graduating pilots formed new CF-18 squadrons. Following <b>this</b> <b>initial</b> cadre of courses, No.410 Squadron trained CF-18 pilots {{at a rate of}} approximately 50 per year. In 1992, with the closure of three squadrons in Germany, this was reduced to 25. With the recent reduction in size of the remaining operational squadrons, No.410 Squadron now trains approximately 20 fighter pilots annually.|$|E

5|$|Geisel Library's {{collection}} of over 200,000 books originated in {{a sack of}} books brought by Father Hugo Paff, O.S.B. from Saint Mary's Abbey in Newark, New Jersey; these books {{are still in the}} library and date back to the mid- to late-19th century. The college's first library, shaped around <b>this</b> <b>initial</b> collection, was situated {{on the first floor of}} Alumni Hall. During the early years of the college, Benedictines served as librarians on an ad hoc basis, but by 1929, Saint Anselm had its first official librarian, Father Cuthbert Redmond, O.S.B. New books were purchased under Father Edwin Davitt, O.S.B. By 1937, Saint Anselm could boast 8,000 books in several mini-libraries, as well as the main repository, by this time located on the second floor.|$|E
5|$|In 1887, Rae {{travelled}} to France {{and settled}} in Paris with her mother Janet and sister Alison. They lived there for three years, before {{the family moved to}} the artists' colony at the fishing village of Étaples, in northern coastal France. During <b>this</b> <b>initial</b> part of her career, Rae exhibited works in Australia and New Zealand, though she remained in Europe. Exhibitions in which she was hung included the 1889 New Zealand and South Seas Exhibition in Dunedin, and the 1896 Victorian Artists' Society, at which several of her landscapes were shown.|$|E
5|$|In 1957, the Swiss Air Force {{performed}} an extensive evaluation of several aircraft for a prospective purchase; competitors included the North American F-86 Sabre, the Folland Gnat, and the Hawker Hunter; {{a pair of}} Hunters were loaned to the Swiss for further trials and testing. In January 1958, the government of Switzerland chose to terminate their independent fighter aircraft project, the in-development FFA P-16, instead choosing to order 100 Hunters to replace their existing fleet of de Havilland Vampire fighters. Further development of the indigenous P-16 was discontinued. <b>This</b> <b>initial</b> order for 100 single-seat Hunters consisted of 12 refurbished RAF F.6s, and 88 new-built F.58s.|$|E
