5|$|Protests {{inspired}} by the successful uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia erupted in Bahrain on 14 February.

5|$|City {{had only}} {{appeared}} in one previous major final when {{they won the}} 1911 FA Cup Final before Wembley Stadium had been built. Hence, the play-off final was the club's first game at Wembley in their 93-year history. For Notts County, it was the fifth visit to the national stadium since 1990.

In the match itself, Flower scored 39, as Zimbabwe reached 340/2, and Olonga took 0/8 in 3 overs, as Zimbabwe won a rain-affected match by 86 runs (D/L method).|$|E
5|$|Lownds infuriated the Special Forces {{personnel}} {{even further}} when the indigenous survivors of Lang Vei, their families, civilian {{refugees from the}} area, and Laotian survivors from the camp at Ban Houei Sane arrived at the gate of KSCB.

Overnight, they were moved to a temporary position {{a short distance from}} the perimeter and from there some of the Laotians were eventually evacuated, although the majority turned around and walked back down Route 9 toward Laos.|$|E
5|$|Robinson {{fought for}} the final time in 1965. He lost via {{unanimous}} decision to Joey Archer.

5|$|Buddhist discontent erupted {{following}} a ban in early May on flying the Buddhist flag in Huế on Vesak, {{the birthday of}} Gautama Buddha. Just days before, Catholics had been encouraged to fly the Vatican flag at a celebration for Archbishop Ngô Đình Thục of Huế, Diệm's elder brother. A large crowd of Buddhists protested the ban, defying the government by flying Buddhist flags on the Buddhist holy day of Vesak and marching on the government broadcasting station. Government forces fired into <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>of</b> protesters, killing nine people. Diệm's refusal to take responsibility — he blamed the Viet Cong for the deaths — led to further Buddhist protests and calls for religious equality. As Diem remained unwilling to comply with Buddhist demands, the frequency of protests increased.|$|E
5|$|By {{three in}} the afternoon, the British had reached a ravine known as Stockton Hollow, {{about a half a}} mile (0.8km) from Trenton where the Americans were forming another line of defense. Washington wanted to hold the British off until nightfall, when {{darkness}} would prevent the British from attacking his defenses {{on the south side of}} Assunpink Creek. The British, with artillery in position, attacked Hand's new position, and he gave way, slowly falling back into Trenton. Along the way, Hand had his troops fire from behind houses. As Hand's troops came to the creek, the Hessians charged at them with bayonets fixed, causing chaos among the Americans. Washington, seeing the chaos, rode out through <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>of</b> men crossing the bridge, and shouted that Hand's rear guard pull back and regroup under the cover of the American artillery.|$|E

5|$|Manchester City's {{third round}} tie {{was against the}} amateur club Corinthians at Crystal Palace. The third round was the furthest Corinithians had ever progressed, though until 1923 the club never entered the cup due to club rules {{preventing}} them from entering any competition with a prize. Manchester City went behind and only equalised three minutes from time. The Corinthians goalkeeper, Benjamin Howard Baker collided with a teammate, causing him to take more than four steps with the ball. From the resulting free kick, Frank Roberts scored in a goalmouth melee to take the tie to a replay, held the following Wednesday. The rematch proved less even. Manchester City won 4–0 courtesy of goals by Austin (twice), Hicks and Johnson. After his goal, Hicks {{had to leave the}} field as he had sustained an injury while performing a celebratory somersault. In the fourth round, City faced league champions Huddersfield Town and again won 4–0. <b>The</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>of</b> 74,799 was by far the highest of the round, and only 1,200 short of the club record.|$|E
5|$|Paul Warfield Tibbets Jr. {{was born}} in Quincy, Illinois, on 23 February 1915, the son of Paul Warfield Tibbets Sr. and his wife, Enola Gay Tibbets. When he {{was five years old}} the family moved to Davenport, Iowa, and then to Iowa's capital, Des Moines, where he was raised, and where his father became a {{confections}} wholesaler. When he was eight, his family moved to Hialeah, Florida, to escape from harsh midwestern winters. As a boy he was very interested in flying. One day his mother agreed to pay one dollar to get him into an airplane at the local carnival. In 1927, when he was 12 years old, he flew in a plane piloted by barnstormer Doug Davis, dropping candy bars with tiny parachutes to <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>of</b> people attending the races at the Hialeah Park Race Track.|$|E
5|$|Their first match {{took place}} on 16 September 1905 against Devon, who had been runners-up {{in the most recent}} English county championship, and for whom played ten members of Devonport Albion, the top club in England. Because of this, Devon went into the match as favourites, however <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>of</b> 6,000 at the match were soon stunned by the New Zealanders as they scored 12 tries and {{eventually}} won 55–4. Billy Wallace scored 28 points, including three tries, and it would be another 51 years before another All Black would score more points in one match. The score caused a sensation in Britain, and some newspapers even incorrectly reported the score as Devon 55, New Zealand 4. Eventually the reports were corrected, and the New Zealanders returned to Newton Abbot to be greeted by a brass band and cheering crowd.|$|E

5|$|A {{victory over}} San Francisco gave the Browns 10 wins {{in a row}} to start the regular season. The game was eagerly {{anticipated}} by both sides: San Francisco had started the season with 10 victories, while the Browns had won their first nine games. The 49ers relied heavily on their offense, which featured quarterback Frankie Albert and end Alyn Beals. The team came into the matchup with the Browns averaging 35.9 points per game. The Browns, meanwhile, were more proficient than the 49ers on defense and in placekicking: the team ranked first in the AAFC in fewest points allowed, and Groza held the league record for the longest field goal. The game began with a San Francisco fumble of Cleveland's opening kickoff that was recovered by Lou Saban. Several plays later, Graham ran 14 yards for a touchdown, giving the Browns their first points. San Francisco responded later in the period with a rushing touchdown by Joe Perry to tie the score. Cleveland struck back with an Edgar Jones touchdown in the third quarter, however, and held {{on to win the}} game 14–7. Ara Parseghian was a standout on both offense and defense, batting down several of Albert's passes. <b>The</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>of</b> 82,769 set a professional football record. While Cleveland won, several key players suffered injuries. Speedie had a separated shoulder, while linebacker Bill Willis was kicked in the face and Tommy James hurt his ankle. Graham had his hand stepped on, and guard Weldon Humble suffered a chin injury.|$|E
5|$|At {{this stage}} Johnston {{was at the}} peak of his career in terms of bowling average and wickets taken per match. In his 24 Tests to the end of the series, he had taken 111 wickets at 19.22, with Australia winning 19 and losing two. In the Fourth Test in Melbourne, Johnston took match figures of 5/110, {{removing}} Weekes in both innings, before coming to the crease in the second innings to partner Doug Ring. Australia were 9/222 in pursuit of 260 for victory, with the series finely poised 2–1. <b>The</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>of</b> 30,000 and the constabulary were resigned to an Australian defeat, with the police officers moving into position to stop the customary pitch invasion at the end of the match. However, the Richmond teammates had other ideas and put together a last wicket partnership of 38, which sealed an Australian victory by one wicket. Ring thought that playing for a draw was impractical, so he decided to attack, while Johnston attempted to hold up his end with a series of defensive shots. The West Indian captain John Goddard placed his fielders halfway to the boundary, allowing Johnston to easily take singles, while Ring was able to clear the infield easily. The Richmond pair thought that Goddard's captaincy was poor. Johnston eventually brought up the winning run by turning Frank Worrell for a single behind square leg, 35 minutes after he came to the crease.|$|E
5|$|Bradford were {{eliminated}} from the FA Cup with a 3–0 defeat to League One side Tranmere Rovers. They returned to league action with two more draws, away to Mansfield Town and Chesterfield, the latter game of which featured Joe Colbeck, who had returned from Darlington early despite his one-month loan spell being originally extended. The following week City signed Willy Topp for £35,000the first time they had paid a transfer fee for a player since Andy Tod in November 2001nearly three months after he first came on trial. City were given two weeks off before their next game, when their home game against Rotherham United on 15 December was postponed because of a frozen pitch. But they could {{not take advantage of}} the extra rest and despite taking the lead against Peterborough United, two second half goals gave Peterborough a 2–1 win and helped them to second in the league. The highest attendance of the season for a League Two game attended City's next game on Boxing Day against Lincoln City. It {{was the first time the}} two teams had met in the league at Valley Parade since the fire of 1985 and <b>the</b> <b>crowd</b> <b>of</b> 15,510 observed a minute silence and wreath-laying ceremony before the game. Peter Thorne gave City the lead, and despite an equalier from Lincoln, Barry Conlon secured a 2–1 win for Bradford in the last minute. The 2007 calendar year finished with another home game, but this time City lost 3–1 to Hereford United.|$|E
