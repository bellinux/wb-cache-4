5|$|The {{majority}} of his fortune, however, came from moneylending. Up until their expulsion in 1290, the major moneylenders in England were Jews, who were not covered by Christian bans on usury. During the reign of Henry III, however, the Jews were <b>taxed</b> <b>at</b> extortionate rates, and many were forced to sell acquired debts at reduced prices. These debts were lucrative, because the buyers were not bound by the existing contract. They could demand higher rates, or sometimes even take forfeit in land. Stratton {{was one of the}} greater beneficiaries of the opportunities offered by trading in Jewish debts. From at least 1271 he was also associated with the Riccardi, a major Italian financier family.|$|E

25|$|A {{capital gain}} {{should not be}} {{confused}} with a dividend. Generally, a capital gain occurs where a capital asset is sold for an amount greater than the amount of its cost at the time the investment was purchased. A dividend is a parsing out a share of the profits, and is <b>taxed</b> <b>at</b> the dividend tax rate. If there is an increase of value of stock, and a shareholder chooses to sell the stock, the shareholder will pay a tax on capital gains (often <b>taxed</b> <b>at</b> a lower rate than ordinary income). If a holder of the stock chooses to not participate in the buyback, the price of the holder's shares could rise (as well as it could fall), but the tax on these gains is delayed until the sale of the shares.|$|E

25|$|The Tennessee {{income tax}} {{does not apply}} to {{salaries}} and wages, but most income from stock, bonds and notes receivable is taxable. All taxable dividends and interest which exceed the $1,250 single exemption or the $2,500 joint exemption are taxable at the rate of 6%. The state's sales and use tax rate for most items is 7%. Food is <b>taxed</b> <b>at</b> a lower rate of 5.25%, but candy, dietary supplements and prepared food are <b>taxed</b> <b>at</b> the full 7% rate. Local sales taxes are collected in most jurisdictions, at rates varying from 1.5% to 2.75%, bringing the total sales tax to between 8.5% and 9.75%, one of the highest levels in the nation. Intangible property is assessed on the shares of stock of stockholders of any loan company, investment company, insurance company or for-profit cemetery companies. The assessment ratio is 40% of the value multiplied by the tax rate for the jurisdiction. Tennessee imposes an inheritance tax on decedents' estates that exceed maximum single exemption limits ($1,000,000 for deaths in 2006 and thereafter).|$|E
25|$|Taxpayers have {{attempted}} {{to argue that the}} Cordner Doctrine (see above) should not apply where the coins remain in circulation, as the coins in the Cordner case (gold coins) had been withdrawn from circulation. This argument has been rejected. In the Stoecklin case, the court ruled that the taxpayer who receives coins (in this case, silver dollar coins) as compensation for services is <b>taxed</b> <b>at</b> the fair market value of the coins, not the lower face value, {{regardless of whether or not}} the coins have been withdrawn from circulation. Similarly, in the case of United States v. Kahre, the criminal defendants’ arguments – that where gold or silver coins are currently circulating, the taxpayer may report the coins as income at their face value and not at the higher fair market value – were rejected. The Kahre case also made news because although the defendants lost their argument that the receipt of circulating coins could be <b>taxed</b> <b>at</b> the lower face value, the defendants were not convicted of the criminal charges against them, with the main defendant drawing a hung jury.|$|E
25|$|A capped {{flat tax}} {{is one in}} which income is <b>taxed</b> <b>at</b> a flat rate until a {{specified}} cap amount is reached. For example, in 2014, the United States Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax is 6.2% of gross compensation up to a limit of $117,000 of gross compensation (resulting in a maximum Social Security tax of $7,254). This cap has the effect of turning a nominally flat tax into a regressive tax.|$|E
