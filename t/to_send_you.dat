2500|$|The EEF {{had been}} reorganized and {{strengthened}} during the Stalemate in Southern Palestine {{to overcome the}} strongly reinforced and entrenched Ottoman forces holding the Gaza to Beersheba line. Allenby was directed by the War Cabinet to [...] "strike the Turks as hard as possible," [...] and defeat hostile forces wherever they opposed the EEF.

[...] By this time the EEF was competing for finite British resources, which were being restricted by the very successful German submarine attacks which destroyed British ships and supplies, with the Third Battle of Ypres which had commenced on 31 July. However, more artillery was in transit, and the doubling of the railway had been authorised on 21 July.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{his final}} {{departure}} from Rideau Hall as governor general, Massey retired to Batterwood House, {{in the village}} of Canton, near Port Hope, Ontario. For his service to the Crown, he was awarded from the Queen the Royal Victorian Chain, making him the second non-royal or non-head of state, the first Canadian, and one of the only two Canadians to have ever received the honour. Just prior {{to the end of his}} time as governor general, the Queen wrote to Massey: [...] "I wish <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>you</b> my congratulations and my sincere thanks for the manner in which you have discharged [...] duties. I know that as my personal representative you have always sought to maintain the right relationship between the Crown and the people of Canada. I am grateful to you for this because I regard it as the most important function among the many duties of the appointment which you have held with such distinction." [...] The Queen had wanted to appoint Massey as a Knight of the Order of the Garter, but Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, after consulting the rest of Cabinet, advised the Queen against conferring the honour.|$|E

Before he left, Sun Quan told him, [...] "I actually didn't want <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>you</b> on this mission. I did so because I was worried that Zhuge Liang might misinterpret my dealings with the Caos. We should work more closely together with Shu after eliminating {{the threat of the}} Shanyue. As an envoy, you've a mission to complete but you aren't restricted in speech." [...] Zhang Wen replied, [...] "I've never held great responsibilities in the court before, nor do I possess the ability to handle diplomatic affairs well. I'm afraid I can neither spread Wu's fame as well as Zhang Zhao did, nor make decisions as well as Zichan. However, Zhuge Liang is wise, discerning and good in long-term planning, so I believe he will definitely understand your intentions and the reasons behind your dealings with Wei. With the blessing of the imperial court, I believe it won't be difficult to understand what Zhuge Liang is looking out for. There is nothing to worry about." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 1894, Alexander III {{died and}} Nicholas mounted the throne as Emperor. At the time, Nicholas had no children, thus {{according}} {{to the laws of}} succession of the Russian Empire, the Grand Duke George became Tsarevich (formally Tsesarevich, denoting the heir presumptive or heir apparent to the throne as opposed to any son of the Tsar, although the latter title fell into disuse in 1721 and was gradually supplanted by the more specific use of Tsarevich). George's ill-health had forced him to relocate to Likani. It was impossible for him to return to St. Petersburg for the funeral of his father, Alexander III. The doctors had forbidden it. Nicholas wrote to his brother, [...] "... constantly pray to God <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>you</b> a full and speedy recovery, and to comfort you, because it is so much more difficult to be alone after such great sorrow than it is for us who are at least together!" [...] George also missed the christenings of Nicholas' elder daughters, Olga and Tatiana. Shortly after the birth of Nicholas' third daughter, Maria, in June 1899, George wrote to his brother, [...] "I am terribly sad that I have not yet been able to see your daughters and get to know them; but what can I do! It means it's not my fate, and everything is the will of God." ...|$|E
2500|$|Whilst {{discussing}} the record with Rolling Stone she discussed her selection of producers for the record, {{with a goal}} to create [...] "a unique record" [...] becoming the basis of her selection. After being asked whether there was anyone she wished to work with on the record, Roberts declared that she wanted Kate Bush. However, contacting Bush was difficult; after asking and hinting to her record label during the year she was producing the album, she found that nobody could establish communications. Electropop band Dragonette worked on the album, producing the second single from the album, [...] "Lucky Day". The band {{were among the first}} to work on the record. Roberts co-wrote the lyrics, saying: [...] "When I wrote 'Lucky Day' I had short hair and was really into '40s fashion. All of the 'woah woah woah woah' and the 'ah ha' really is a reflection of that." [...] She also stated when it came to the production of the track, early in 2011, that she wanted to produce a [...] "more downbeat dance record" [...] noting it was what she was into at that point". Roberts worked with producer Diplo, who co-produced the track [...] "Beat of My Drum", she explained whilst talking to The Guardian, [...] "I had to ring him [...] and… you know when you ring a boy for the first time? I knew I only had one chance, so I just fired at him. 'I want this, I want that, don't send it back like that. I'm going <b>to</b> <b>send</b> <b>you</b> the session again just so you've got it.' He reassured me a bit, and I put the phone down, thinking, it's not in my hands now". When Roberts received the track back from Diplo, she was too nervous to listen to it, as it meant so much to her. Whilst back in her hometown of Liverpool she put her younger brother and sister in the car with her, and after burning the track to a CD, drove to a deserted field and played it loudly. After positive responses from the pair, Roberts declared [...] "I'm so proud of it. I can't believe it's mine. The man is a genius". Roberts worked with producer Joseph Mount on the album, recording two songs. For years before the pair started work together, Mount had mentioned several times that he wished to work with Girls Aloud (Roberts' former group), and had sent [...] "short beats" [...] to her, including music which he thought the record label would approve of, as well as a wild-card style compilation. When the two started work in the studio, both of the tracks produced by Mount were chosen from the wild-card category, with lyrics written by Roberts, and the melodies in the tracks produced jointly.|$|E
