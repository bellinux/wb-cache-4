5|$|In November 1934, Butler {{told the}} {{committee}} that one Gerald P. MacGuire told him {{that a group of}} businessmen, supposedly backed by a private army of 500,000 ex-soldiers and others, intended to establish a fascist dictatorship. Butler had been asked to lead it, he said, by MacGuire, who was a bond salesman with Grayson M–P Murphy & Co. The New York Times reported that Butler had told friends that General Hugh S. Johnson, former head of the National Recovery Administration, was to be installed as dictator, and that the J.P. Morgan banking firm was behind the plot. Butler <b>told</b> <b>Congress</b> that MacGuire had told him the attempted coup was backed by three million dollars, and that the 500,000 men were probably to be assembled in Washington, D.C. the following year. All the parties alleged to be involved publicly said there was no truth in the story, calling it a joke and a fantasy.|$|E
5|$|Taylor's men {{advanced}} to the Rio Grande in March 1846. Polk's attempts to negotiate with Mexico had failed, and war appeared imminent. Violence broke out several weeks later, when some of Captain Seth B. Thornton's men were attacked by Mexican forces north of the river. Polk, learning of the Thornton Affair, <b>told</b> <b>Congress</b> in May that a war between Mexico and the U.S. had begun. That same month, Taylor commanded American forces at the Battle of Palo Alto and the nearby Battle of Resaca de la Palma. Though greatly outnumbered, he defeated the Mexican force, which consisted of the Army of the North, commanded by General Mariano Arista, and forced the troops back across the Rio Grande. Before accepting a prisoner exchange with General Arista, Taylor was noted for his humane treatment of the wounded Mexican soldiers, giving them the same care as {{was given to the}} American wounded. After tending to the wounded he performed the last rites for the dead of both the American and Mexican soldiers killed during the battle.|$|E
25|$|In February 2015, National Counterterrorism Center {{director}} Nicholas Rasmussen <b>told</b> <b>Congress</b> that Snowden's disclosures had damaged U.S. intelligence capabilities. Rasmussen {{said the}} government knew of specific terrorists who, after learning from Snowden's leaks how the U.S. collected intelligence, had increased their security measures by using new types of encryption, changing email addresses, or abandoning prior methods of communicating.|$|E
50|$|On 20 February 2013, Defense Department Controller Robert Hale {{said that}} rather than {{cancelling}} contracts outright, the DoD would instead use furloughs and simply not exercise contract options for supplies and services. Hale testified the next month and <b>told</b> the <b>Congress</b> that it was their actions that were preventing the Pentagon from making sensible budget reductions and therefore forcing furloughs of defense civilian employees.|$|R
5000|$|During the Congress, {{there was}} {{debate about the}} role of Austria {{in the lives of the}} Slavs. Dr. Josef Frič argued that the “primary goal is the {{preservation}} of Austria”, adding that the Congress “only differs on the means.” This point was disputed by Ľudovít Štúr who <b>told</b> the <b>Congress,</b> “our goal is self-preservation”. [...] Such a disconnect was typical of the environment of this conference.|$|R
2500|$|It is well {{documented}} when the Congress accepted the referendum without consulting the Khudai Khidmatgar, Bacha Khan <b>told</b> the <b>Congress</b> [...] "you have thrown us to the wolves." [...] The spirit of the Khudai Khidmatgar movement took its last breath when it was proclaimed as a political party after the creation of Pakistan. The aims and objectives were changed and gradually people lost their interest in the movement and embraced the idea of pakistan.|$|R
25|$|As a Senator, Dole {{became a}} staunch {{supporter}} of the program, after he worked with George McGovern to produce a bipartisan solution {{to two of the}} main problems associated with food stamps: cumbersome purchase requirements and lax eligibility standards. Dole <b>told</b> <b>Congress</b> regarding the new provisions, “I am confident that this bill eliminates the greedy and feeds the needy.” The law was intended to strengthen the agricultural economy and provide improved levels of nutrition among low-income households; however, the practical purpose was to bring the pilot FSP under congressional control and to enact the regulations into law.|$|E
25|$|Under President Carter, the CIA was {{conducting}} covertly funded pro-American opposition against the Sandinista. In March 1981, Reagan <b>told</b> <b>Congress</b> that the CIA would protect El Salvador by preventing the shipment of Nicaraguan arms {{into the country}} to arm Communist rebels. This was a ruse. The CIA was actually arming and training Nicaraguans Contras in Honduras in hopes that they could depose the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. Through William J. Casey's tenure as DCI little {{of what he said}} in the National Security Planning Group, or to President Reagan was supported by the intelligence branch of the CIA, so Casey formed the Central American Task Force, staffed with yes men from Covert Action. On December 21, 1982, Congress passed a law restricting the CIA to its stated mission, restricting the flow of arms from Nicaragua to El Salvador, prohibiting the use of funds to oust the Sandinistas. Reagan testified before Congress, assuring them that the CIA was not trying to topple the Nicaraguan government.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, {{supporters}} of nurse training programs recommended the doubling of [...] federal aid for basic nursing {{education in the}} fiscal year 1943. Representative Frances P. Bolton of Ohio, an advocate of nursing, supported the proposed increase in federal aid. She <b>told</b> <b>Congress</b> further expansion of nursing schools might be needed the following year.|$|E
50|$|A top U.S. Army psychiatrist, Colonel Charles Hoge, <b>told</b> the U.S. <b>Congress</b> in March 2008 {{that nearly}} 30 percent of troops on their third {{deployment}} suffer from serious mental-health problems, {{and that one}} year was not enough time between combat tours.|$|R
2500|$|In her {{nomination}} acceptance speech, Palin said: [...] "I <b>told</b> the <b>Congress</b> 'thanks, but no thanks,' {{for that}} Bridge to Nowhere." [...] McCain-Palin television advertisements also claim Palin [...] "stopped the Bridge to Nowhere." [...] Ketchikan's Mayor Bob Weinstein has criticized Palin {{for using the}} term 'Bridge to Nowhere' in her vice-presidential nomination acceptance speech because Palin had termed that name for the bridge [...] "insulting" [...] during her 2006 gubernatorial campaign, when she campaigned on her original [...] "build the bridge" [...] platform.|$|R
2500|$|On March 8, the Property Law of the People's Republic of China was {{formally}} introduced at the NPC. Vice-Chairman Wang Zhaoguo <b>told</b> the <b>Congress</b> {{that the law}} will [...] "safeguard the fundamental interests of the people", and the law is an attempt at adapting to new [...] "economic and social realities" [...] in China. [...] The bill {{was first published in}} 2002. It was subsequently deferred, failed again in its reading at the 2006 National People's Congress because of a dispute over its contents, and then went through its eighth reading in 2007.|$|R
500|$|Grant's Peace Policy {{was a sharp}} {{reversal}} of federal policy toward Native Americans. [...] "Wars of extermination ... are demoralizing and wicked.", he <b>told</b> <b>Congress</b> in his second Inaugural Address of 1873. The president lobbied, though not always successfully, to preserve Native American lands from encroachment by the westward advance of pioneers. The economic forces of western expansionism led to conflicts between Native Americans, settlers, and the U.S. military. Native Americans were increasingly forced to live on reservations.|$|E
500|$|In 1956, Keating {{joined a}} priest leading {{a group of}} {{concerned}} Catholics in Cincinnati who {{were concerned about the}} dangers of pornography, and he began giving talks on the subject to parents and other groups. In 1958, Keating testified before the House Judiciary Committee on mail-order pornography, saying that it was [...] "capable of poisoning any mind at any age and of perverting our entire younger generation", and that it was closely tied to juvenile delinquency, while also quoting a Senate Committee report that [...] "part of the Communist conspiracy was to print (obscene materials)". [...] Keating mentioned links between pornography and Communism at other times, but distanced himself from the more fervent anti-Communist groups of the early 1960s. He stated that 90 percent of obscene materials were produced for profit, not ideological reasons, and <b>told</b> <b>Congress</b> in 1960, [...] "I had better say [...] that I am not blaming obscenity in America on the Communists." ...|$|E
500|$|Chaplin denied being a communist, instead {{calling himself}} a [...] "peacemonger", but felt the government's effort to {{suppress}} the ideology was an unacceptable infringement of civil liberties. Unwilling to be quiet about the issue, he openly protested against the trials of Communist Party members and {{the activities of the}} House Un-American Activities Committee. Chaplin received a subpoena to appear before HUAC but was not called to testify. As his activities were widely reported in the press, and Cold War fears grew, questions were raised over his failure to take American citizenship. Calls were made for him to be deported; in one extreme and widely published example, Representative John E. Rankin, who helped establish HUAC, <b>told</b> <b>Congress</b> in June 1947: [...] " [...] very life in Hollywood is detrimental to the moral fabric of America. ... his loathsome pictures can be kept from before the eyes of the American youth. He should be deported and gotten rid of at once." ...|$|E
50|$|The Ninth Five-Year Plan was {{presented}} to the 24th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) in 1971 by Alexei Kosygin, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers. The plan's main focus was to increase the growth of industrial produced consumer goods. It was the first five-year plan to call for a higher increase for industrial consumer goods than in capital goods. Brezhnev <b>told</b> the <b>Congress</b> that increasing the standard of living was more important than economic development. The plan proposed an increase in gross national income (GNP) by 37 to 40 percent.|$|R
50|$|In April 2012, Kicillof <b>told</b> the Argentine <b>Congress</b> {{that the}} country would not pay $10 billion in {{compensation}} for YPF, as demanded by Repsol. An agreement was ultimately reached with Repsol in November 2013, whereby the latter would be compensated for a 51% stake in YPF with approximately US$5 billion in 10-year corporate bonds.|$|R
5000|$|The 1965 reform tried, {{with little}} success, {{to improve the}} quality of goods produced. In the 1979 reform Kosygin tried to {{displace}} gross output from [...] "its commanding place" [...] in the planned economy, and new regulations for rare and high-quality goods were created. Capital investment was seen as a very serious problem by the Soviet authorities by 1979, with General Secretary Leonid Brezhnev and Premier Kosygin claiming that only an increase in labor productivity could help develop the economy of the more technologically advanced Soviet Republics such as the Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic (ESSR). When Kosygin died in 1980, the reform was practically abandoned by his successor, Nikolai Tikhonov. Brezhnev <b>told</b> the 26th <b>Congress</b> that the implementation of the reform had been very slow. Tikhonov, during his speech to the 26th <b>Congress,</b> <b>told</b> the delegates that parts of the reform would be implemented during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (1981-1985).|$|R
500|$|By 1875, Redeemer Democrats {{took control}} of all but three Southern states. As {{violence}} against black Southerners escalated once more, Attorney General Edwards Pierrepont told Governor Adelbert Ames of Mississippi that the people were [...] "tired of the autumnal outbreaks in the South", and declined to intervene directly, instead, sending an emissary to negotiate a peaceful election. Grant later regretted not issuing a proclamation to help Ames, having been told Republicans in Ohio would bolt the party if Grant intervened in Mississippi. Grant <b>told</b> <b>Congress</b> in January 1875 he could not [...] "see with indifference Union men or Republicans ostracized, persecuted, and murdered." [...] Congress refused to strengthen the laws against violence, but instead passed a sweeping law to guarantee blacks access to public facilities. Grant signed it as the Civil Rights Act of 1875, but enforcement was weak and the Supreme Court ruled the law unconstitutional in 1883. In October 1876, Grant dispatched troops to South Carolina to aid Republican Governor Daniel Henry Chamberlain. Grant's successor, Hayes, abandoned the remaining three Republican governments in the South that were supported by the army after the Compromise of 1877, which {{marked the end of}} Reconstruction.|$|E
500|$|Even as Grant drew cheers at {{the opening}} of the Centennial Exposition in May 1876, the {{collected}} scandals of his presidency, the country's weak economy, and the Democratic gains in the House led many in the Republican party to repudiate him in June. Bristow was among the leading candidates to replace him, suggesting that a large faction desired an end to [...] "Grantism" [...] and feared that Grant would run for a third term. Ultimately, Grant declined to run, but Bristow also failed to capture the nomination, as the convention settled on Governor Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio, a reformer. The Democrats nominated Governor Samuel J. Tilden of New York. Voting irregularities in three Southern states caused the election that year to remain undecided for several months. Grant <b>told</b> <b>Congress</b> to settle the matter through legislation and assured both sides that he would not use the army to force a result, except to curb violence. On January 29, 1877, he signed legislation forming an Electoral Commission to decide the matter. The Commission ruled that the disputed votes belonged to Hayes; to forestall Democratic protests, Republicans agreed to the Compromise of 1877, in which the last troops were withdrawn from Southern capitals. The Republicans had won, but Reconstruction was over. According to biographer Jean Edward Smith, [...] "Grant's calm visage in the White House reassured the nation." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{a trip to}} the US, she <b>told</b> <b>Congress</b> that [...] "we do not possess, nor do {{we intend}} to make, a nuclear device". Between January and March 1989, she {{authorised}} cold tests of nuclear weaponry, without fissionable material.|$|E
5000|$|Barillas Bercián {{was able}} to become interim {{president}} of Guatemala {{after the death of}} President Justo Rufino Barrios in the Batalla of Chalchuapa in El Salvador in April 1885, by means of a clever scam: he went to the General Cemetery when Barrios was being laid to rest and <b>told</b> the <b>Congress</b> president: [...] "please prepare room and board for the 5,000 troops that I have waiting for my orders in Mixco". The congress president was scared of this, and declared Barillas interim president on the spot. By the time he realized that it was all a lie, {{it was too late to}} change anything.|$|R
2500|$|General Manuel Lisandro Barillas Bercián {{was able}} to become interim {{president}} of Guatemala {{after the death of}} President Justo Rufino Barrios in the Batalla of Chalchuapa in El Salvador in April 1885 and after the resignation of first designate Alejandro Manuel Sinibaldi Castro, by means of a clever scam: [...] he went to the General Cemetery when Barrios was being laid to rest and <b>told</b> the <b>Congress</b> president: [...] "please prepare room and board for the 5,000 troops that I have waiting for my orders in Mixco".

5000|$|Nikolai Tikhonov, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, <b>told</b> the <b>Congress</b> that {{industrial}} output {{would grow}} by an estimated 26-28 {{percent during the}} five-year plan and capital investment by between 12 - 15 percent over the preceding plan. Tikhonov criticised {{what he saw as}} inefficiencies within the planned economy, placing most of the blame on low labour productivity, which as a result was targeted to grow by 23 - 25 percent, an increase of 6 - 8 percent over the preceding plan. [...] "The basic guidelines for the USSR's economic and social development in 1981-85 and the period up to 1990", an economic plan proposed by Tikhonov, was adopted by the Congress. The five key points of Tikhonov's economic plan were: ...|$|R

2500|$|Lavelle later <b>told</b> <b>Congress</b> that {{he could}} have hit some of the targets within the rules of {{engagement}} by [...] "trolling", or first sending aircraft into hostile areas as bait to provoke enemy fire. The Navy used this practice but Lavelle said that he did not, regarding it as unacceptably dangerous to his aircrews.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2005, Coleman {{voted for}} a budget bill that cut funding {{from a number of}} programs, but kept funding for sugar beet farmers in Minnesota after Rove asked him to support the administration's {{position}} on the issue. Coleman <b>told</b> <b>Congress</b> Daily that he would not vote for a bill that cut sugar beet funding but [...] "Karl Rove called me and asked what I wanted. A few hours later it was out of the bill." ...|$|E

The United States Department of Agriculture library and the Library of <b>Congress</b> <b>told</b> all interested parties that no such movie {{was made by the}} USDA or any branch of the US government. Two VHS copies were recovered and donated to the Library of Congress on 19 May 1989 by Maria Farrow, Carl Packard, and Jack Herer.|$|R
2500|$|During the campaign, some {{pointed out}} alleged {{differences}} between Palin's positions as a gubernatorial candidate and her {{position as a}} vice-presidential candidate. While campaigning for vice-president, Palin touted her stance on [...] "the bridge to nowhere" [...] {{as an example of}} her opposition to pork barrel spending. In her nomination acceptance speech and on the campaign trail, Palin often said, [...] "I <b>told</b> the <b>Congress</b> 'thanks, but no thanks,' on that Bridge to Nowhere." [...] Although Palin was originally a main proponent of the Gravina Island Bridge, McCain-Palin television advertisements asserted that Palin [...] "stopped the Bridge to Nowhere."

50|$|Within {{few months}} of getting re-elected as popular CM, Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy (YSR) died in a {{helicopter}} crash in September 2009. This resulted in a leadership crisis within the Congress party and also created a political vacuum in the state. During this time, TRS president K. Chandrashekar Rao (KCR) raised his pitch for the separate state. On 29 November 2009, he started a fast-unto-death, demanding that the Congress party introduce a Telangana bill in Parliament. He was arrested by the police. Student organisations, employee unions, and various organisations joined the movement. KCR had <b>told</b> a <b>Congress</b> emissary on 6 December that he would break his fast if Congress president Sonia Gandhi made a public appeal to him to do so. General strikes shut down Telangana on 6 and 7 December.|$|R
2500|$|In March 2010, GoDaddy stopped {{registering}} [...]cn domains (China) due to {{the high}} amount of personal information that is required to register in that country. Some called it a public relations campaign, since it closely followed Google's revolt in China. GoDaddy’s top lawyer Christine Jones <b>told</b> <b>Congress,</b> “We were having to contact Chinese users to ask for their personal information and begrudgingly give it to Chinese authorities. We decided we didn’t want to become {{an agent of the}} Chinese government.” ...|$|E
2500|$|A common American {{interpretation}} of the program's role in European recovery was expressed by Paul Hoffman, head of the Economic Cooperation Administration, in 1949, when he <b>told</b> <b>Congress</b> Marshall aid had provided the [...] "critical margin" [...] on which other investment needed for European recovery depended. The Marshall Plan {{was one of the}} first elements of European integration, as it erased trade barriers and set up institutions to coordinate the economy on a continental level—that is, it stimulated the total political reconstruction of western Europe.|$|E

A spokesman for Mr. Renzi dismissed as [...] "a political hatchet job" [...] the suggestion that Mr. Charlton's firing was connected to the probe of Mr. Renzi.
