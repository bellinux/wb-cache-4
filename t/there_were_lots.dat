Researches and development into street art started six months before the work had begun. Then a graffiti wall was painted by the band itself and Paris, formed by nine parts. Tappin Gofton wanted the whole evolution of the wall, so at the end of every day loads of super detailed photos would be taken from it. In the end a picture including three parts of the wall was featured on the front cover, while the whole wall is featured on the center of the CD's booklet.|$|E
500|$|Mercury booked the New York Dolls at The Record Plant in New York City, {{where they}} {{recorded}} their self-titled debut album in April 1973. Rundgren was originally {{concerned that they}} had taken [...] "the worst sounding studio in the city at that time" [...] {{because it was the}} only one available to them with the short time given to record and release the album. He later said that expectations for the band and the festive atmosphere of the recording sessions proved to be more of a problem: [...] "The Dolls were critics' darlings and the press had kind of adopted them. Plus, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>lots</b> of extra people around, socializing, which made it hard to concentrate." [...] New York Dolls was recorded in eight days on a budget of only $17,000. With a short amount of studio time and no concept in mind for the album, the band chose which songs to record based on how well they had been received at their live shows. In Johansen's own words, [...] "we went into a room and just recorded. It wasn't like these people who conceptualize things. It was just a document of what was going on at the time." ...|$|E

[...] "Right now they're using weapons , but it doesn't prove where these weapons came from.|$|E

2500|$|Mark {{became the}} first {{mainstream}} soap character to be diagnosed as HIV-positive. The storyline came after a government request to [...] "spread the word". Mark's story also helped dispel the myth that HIV is an automatic death sentence. He lived with the condition for 13 years before dying of an AIDS related illness. The Terrence Higgins Trust worked with the production team {{for the duration of}} Mark's story. Despite all the public health campaigns concerning HIV transmission, the biggest peak in requests for testing in Britain was seen in January 1991 when Mark Fowler was diagnosed HIV-positive. Carty has commented: [...] "I feel that the storyline educated people at a time when <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>lots</b> of misconceptions about HIV and AIDS…My main concern was that they'd get it right and, overall, I think they did - because it showed someone living with HIV, as opposed to dying of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mudge missed {{much of the}} 2005 season, first recuperating from an {{operation}} to rehabilitate a damaged knee which left her on crutches, and then succumbing to a bout of plantar fasciitis between May and July. Of her surgery, Mudge said: [...] "I'd worn away all my knee cartilage – {{more to do with}} my running style than the sport itself. I was running on the bare bone of my femur, so the surgeon drilled a lot of holes, which stimulates scar tissue, and eventually, I could run again. My knee was more painful afterwards than before. I was prepared for that, but was allowed to run for only ten minutes even months after the operation. I deliberately did not ask about the success or failure rate in order to keep a positive frame of mind. It was only six months later that a physiotherapist told me <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>lots</b> of people for whom the operation did not work." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{debate on}} the nature of [...] "emblem glyphs" [...] {{received}} a new spin with the monograph by David Stuart and Stephen D. Houston. The authors convincingly demonstrated that <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>lots</b> of place names-proper, some real, some mythological, mentioned in the hieroglyphic inscriptions. Some of these place names also appeared in the [...] "emblem glyphs", some were attested in the [...] "titles of origin" [...] (various expressions like [...] "a person from Boston"), but some were not incorporated in personal titles at all. Moreover, the authors also highlighted the cases when the [...] "titles of origin" [...] and the [...] "emblem glyphs" [...] did not overlap, building upon an earlier research by Houston. Houston noticed that the establishment and spread of the Tikal-originated dynasty in the Petexbatun region was accompanied by the proliferation of rulers using the Tikal [...] "emblem glyph" [...] placing political and dynastic ascendancy above the current seats of rulership. Recent investigations also emphasize the use of emblem glyphs as an emic identifier to shape socio-political self-identity.|$|E
2500|$|When Leguizamo {{was four}} years old, his family immigrated to the United States, and lived in various neighborhoods in Queens, New York, {{including}} Jackson Heights. He later credited growing up {{as one of the}} first Latino children in the neighborhood as formative in his acting ability: [...] "It was tough. <b>There</b> <b>were</b> <b>lots</b> of fights. I would walk through a park and be attacked, and I had to defend myself all the time. But this helped me to become funny so that I wouldn’t get hit." [...] Leguizamo attended the Joseph Pulitzer Middle School (I.S.145) and later the Murry Bergtraum High School. As a student at Murry Bergtraum, he wrote comedy material and tested it on his classmates. He was voted [...] "Most Talkative" [...] by his classmates. After graduating from high school, he began his theater career as an undergraduate at NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, from which he eventually dropped out in favor of a career in stand-up comedy. Post-NYU, Leguizamo enrolled at LIU Post, where he took theater classes.|$|E
2500|$|The Big Sister was, {{according}} to animation supervisor Jeff Weir, {{the first thing}} Jordan Thomas talked about to the animators {{when they arrived at}} 2K Marin. The character challenged the team to convey her backstory and personality through the design. Fix started with descriptive words on a page, moving to thumbnails and silhouette concepts. Early inspiration for the character's design included racing dogs, and the idea of a character that carries itself in a restrained way until it explodes in action. [...] " [...] of her as graceful and yet awkward at the same time, and that’s really the hard challenge that we had with her. Actually in terms of design, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>lots</b> of fun things, like at one point she had a sort of 'Fallen Angel' feel to her, like broken wings," [...] Weir recalled. Motion capture sessions were used for inspiration for the alternatingly awkward and fluid motion of the character, though none of it was used in the final product. In developing her visual design, the team tried to balance the design influence of the Big Daddies with a unique look. Soft design elements influenced by the story, like Little Sisters that would ride around in the Big Sister's cage and draw on her armor, were added to complement the harsh metal {{of the rest of the}} character.|$|E

2500|$|During {{his time}} at Liverpool, Voronin heavily criticized the {{standard}} of lifestyle in England and Great Britain in general {{and in particular the}} city of Liverpool. Voronin took no prisoners in his rant which criticized the Scouse way of talking, the high crime rate in the city and attacked the country's health care. In April 2008, he stated in a Russian newspaper; [...] "Compared with Germany, England is far behind in terms of comfort and culture. Five out of the seven houses near us are occupied by footballers. Steven Gerrard was burgled recently so a police patrol car comes into our area fairly often. We hear police sirens all the time. Leverkusen by contrast was so much quieter. The medical services here are poor. When I was in Germany, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>lots</b> of good clinics and doctors. It's nothing like that here. when our child had a skin allergy, we waited hours for the doctor to see him. When we finally got to see a doctor, he said he didn't know how to treat children and to try rubbing in this ointment. That was it. I was stunned!. As a result my wife {{had to go back to}} Odessa with him and took a full set of tests there. I study English twice a week with a teacher and I have made some progress in it. But English isn't the main problem. The main thing is to learn to understand the local players like Gerrard and Carragher. They speak with some peculiar local native accent and sometimes I have absolutely no clue what the guys are saying. Many foreign players have the same problem." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{account of}} {{emerging}} as {{the winners of the}} 2009 season of the Indian Premier League. The team participated in the inaugural edition of the T20 Champions League along with two other Indian teams. They were runners-up of IPL 2009, Royal Challengers Bangalore and Delhi Daredevils, the toppers of the league-stage points table. They were knocked out in the group stages after losing to the Somerset Sabres and Trinidad & Tobago, who they were drawn against in Group A. After winning 2009, <b>there</b> <b>were</b> <b>lots</b> of expectations on Chargers. Team opened with a loss in their inaugural match against KKR but subsequently won next 3 matches. But thereafter Chargers went on to lose the next 5 matches. With a situation where many doubted whether Chargers {{will be able to make}} to next round but it has made it by winning next 5 consecutive matches and qualifying for playoffs. But Chargers lost both games in play offs i.e. Semi-finals and 3rd place. Before the start of auction Chargers decided not to retain any players and have put all the players in auction. The much awaited Auction in January 2011 lived up to the expectation in fact it exceeded in many ways. Team started the campaign by losing first 2 games but team won next match. Thereafter team started losing badly despite winning some games and was therefore eliminated from the competition. But team bounced back by showing pride by winning final 3 matches which didn't allow a chance for other teams for qualifiers. Team disappointing performance was clearly due to inexperience in the squad especially due to lack of Indian international batsmen. Fans of DC have criticized management for not holding back Rohit Sharma during player retention. Chargers got to play IPL matches at Hyderabad after almost 3 years but dismal performance at their home ground continued with a win against RCB being the only exception. However, in the away matches, Chargers did manage to beat Delhi Daredevils, Mumbai Indians, Kolkata Knight Riders, Pune Warriors and Kings XI. They ended on a high with 3 consecutive wins but could not scale above 7th position in the league standings.|$|E
