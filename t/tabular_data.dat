25|$|SQL Native Client is {{the native}} client side data access library for Microsoft SQL Server, version 2005 onwards. It {{natively}} implements {{support for the}} SQL Server features including the <b>Tabular</b> <b>Data</b> Stream implementation, support for mirrored SQL Server databases, full support for all data types supported by SQL Server, asynchronous operations, query notifications, encryption support, as well as receiving multiple result sets in a single database session. SQL Native Client is used under the hood by SQL Server plug-ins for other data access technologies, including ADO or OLE DB. The SQL Native Client can also be directly used, bypassing the generic data access layers.|$|E
25|$|The {{protocol}} layer implements the external interface to SQL Server. All operations {{that can be}} invoked on SQL Server are communicated to it via a Microsoft-defined format, called <b>Tabular</b> <b>Data</b> Stream (TDS). TDS is an application layer protocol, used to transfer data between a database server and a client. Initially designed and developed by Sybase Inc. for their Sybase SQL Server relational database engine in 1984, and later by Microsoft in Microsoft SQL Server, TDS packets can be encased in other physical transport dependent protocols, including TCP/IP, named pipes, and shared memory. Consequently, access to SQL Server is available over these protocols. In addition, the SQL Server API is also exposed over web services.|$|E

25|$|When writing {{code for}} SQL CLR, data stored in SQL Server {{databases}} {{can be accessed}} using the ADO.NET APIs like any other managed application that accesses SQL Server data. However, doing that creates a new database session, {{different from the one}} in which the code is executing. To avoid this, SQL Server provides some enhancements to the ADO.NET provider that allows the connection to be redirected to the same session which already hosts the running code. Such connections are called context connections and are set by setting context connection parameter to true in the connection string. SQL Server also provides several other enhancements to the ADO.NET API, including classes to work with <b>tabular</b> <b>data</b> or a single row of data as well as classes to work with internal metadata about the data stored in the database. It also provides access to the XML features in SQL Server, including XQuery support. These enhancements are also available in T-SQL Procedures in consequence of the introduction of the new XML Datatype (query,value,nodes functions).|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Integrating {{miscellaneous}} data belonging from web sources {{has always}} been a topic of interests. Mediation architecture is mainly devoted to this task, because it enables to query those sources and to federate the results in order to give an answer to another application like a web-service. However the conditions on the network is not always at its best, therefore the results are sometimes stored as materialized views. XML is used in theses architectures to present an uniform answer to the final user. The issue in this context is to maintain consistency of the views when underlying data sources has been updated. Our work is related to the self maintenance of materialized XML views when the data sources are non-cooperative. The first step of our approach is to detect and to identify the sources updates. Our views are computed using the XAlgebra, an algebra based on XQuery requests which handle XML results as <b>tabular</b> <b>datas.</b> We propose an approach for maintaining XML views in this context, mainly based on an extension of this algebra. To that purpose, we had new operators and identifiers. Our process is based upon a partial recovery of underlying sources which is computed over the view itself [...] U Self maintenance of materialized XML views with non-cooperative data source...|$|R
