5|$|Locals have {{estimated}} that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>area</b> still affected by contamination is just offshore from the Alcoa plant.

The stigma attached to the bay due to reports of pollution has discouraged fishing, enabling a healthy population to develop.|$|E
5|$|Fishing, {{including}} ice fishing, is {{a common}} pastime on Lake Chillisquaque. Fishing and boating are permitted on the lake {{at any time of}} day, although boats fuelled by gasoline are forbidden. Boating of any kind is also forbidden annually between March 15 and April 30 and is also forbidden in Goose Cove year-round. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>area</b> for boating access on the lake is on {{the eastern side of the}} lake, at the Heron Cove Boat Access Area. The paddling and running stages of the Chilli Challenge triathlon are on Lake Chillisquaque and the Chillisuagi Trail, respectively.|$|E

5|$|Historically, Skye was {{overwhelmingly}} Gaelic-speaking, {{but this}} changed between 1921 and 2001. In both the 1901 and 1921 censuses, all Skye parishes {{were more than}} 75 per cent Gaelic-speaking. By 1971, only Kilmuir parish had more than three quarters Gaelic speakers {{while the rest of}} Skye ranged between 50 and 74 per cent. At that time, Kilmuir was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>area</b> outside the Western Isles that had such a high proportion of Gaelic speakers. In the 2001 census Kilmuir had just under half Gaelic speakers, and overall, Skye had 31 per cent, distributed unevenly. The strongest Gaelic areas were in the north and south-west of the island, including Staffin at 61 per cent. The weakest areas were in the west and east (e.g. Luib 23 per cent and Kylerhea 19 per cent). Other areas on Skye ranged between 48 per cent and 25 per cent.|$|E
5|$|I-70 {{serves as}} the main {{thoroughfare}} of the valley, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>area</b> traversed by the freeway in the state {{with more than a}} few hundred residents. Richfield is the largest city along I-70 in the state. The highway enters the valley just north of Big Rock Candy Mountain, a mountain named for a song attributed to Harry McClintock. The highway proceeds northeast along {{the western edge of the}} valley, passing to the west of the communities of the valley, including Joseph, Monroe, Elsinore, and Richfield. As I-70 approaches Salina it cuts across the valley passing to the south of that town. The highway avoids the downtown areas of all of these cities. The portion between Richfield and Salina is the busiest, with an annual average daily traffic of 11,535vehicles in 2006. In the Sevier Valley, I-70 was built parallel to U.S. Route 89.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the areas}} of focus on object {{permanence}} has been how physical disabilities (blindness, cerebral palsy and deafness) and intellectual disabilities (Down syndrome, etc.) affect the development of object permanence. In a study that was performed in 1975-76, {{the results showed that}} <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>area</b> where children with intellectual disabilities performed more weakly than children without disabilities was along the lines of social interaction. Other tasks, such as imitation and causality tasks, were performed more weakly by the children without disabilities. However, object permanence was still acquired similarly because it was not related to social interaction.|$|E

5|$|Thallium {{can also}} be {{obtained}} from the smelting of lead and zinc ores. Manganese nodules found on the ocean floor contain some thallium, but the collection of these nodules has been prohibitively expensive. There is also the potential for damaging the oceanic environment. In addition, several other thallium minerals, containing 16% to 60% thallium, occur in nature as complexes of sulfides or selenides that primarily contain antimony, arsenic, copper, lead, and/or silver. These minerals are rare, and they have had no commercial importance as sources of thallium. The Allchar deposit in southern Macedonia was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>area</b> where thallium was actively mined. This deposit still contains an estimated 500tonnes of thallium, and it is a source for several rare thallium minerals, for example lorándite.|$|E
5|$|The Belgo-Congolese force lost 462 men {{during the}} conflict, 80 {{percent of them}} to disease. It was {{estimated}} that the Italians lost about {{three times as many}} men. A total of 6,454 Italian troops were taken prisoner, including Gazzera, eight other generals and 3,500 askari, along with the seizure of 20 artillery pieces, 200 machine guns, 250 trucks and 500 mules. With Gazzera's surrender, Gondar became <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>area</b> in Ethiopia that remained under Italian control. The market in Saïo was reopened three days after hostilities had ceased and Belgian engineers repaired the Saïo-Gambela road.|$|E
5|$|The Northern Quarter of Delos {{contains}} the Jewelry Quarter, where older {{structures such as}} workshops and other archaeological remains dating to the 3rd century BC and early 2nd century BC have been discovered. By {{the second half of}} the 2nd century BC these were replaced by private homes built in the most characteristic fashion for Delos: a narrow, rectangular floor plan with a central courtyard, a vestibule service room in the front, and a larger, main room in the rear. The quarter of the House of the Masks is <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>area</b> of Delos without this archetypal house plan. Some houses of the Northern Quarter feature mosaic decorations with mythological scenes, including Lycurgus of Thrace and Ambrosia in an upper-story mosaic, as well as Athena and Hermes together with a seated woman in a main-room mosaic.|$|E

5|$|Until September 2009, The Isle of Sheppey was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>area</b> in Kent {{to still}} have a middle school system. On the island, primary schools taught pupils from ages 4 to 9, middle schools 9–13 and {{secondary}} schools 13–18. Minster College in the neighbouring town of Minster was the only secondary school on the island. Sheerness had one middle school, Isle of sheppey Academy, with 800 pupils, although Danley Middle School and St George's Middle School were found in Halfway and Minster, respectively. In 2006, the Cheyne Middle School's Key Stage 2 performance ranked 322nd among Kent's 386 primary and middle schools. The town's primary schools are Richmond First School, Rose Street Primary School, St Edward's Roman Catholic Primary School and West Minster Primary School, all of which cover ages 4–11. Sheppey College, in Sheerness, is a branch of Canterbury College that provides a range of further education courses.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>area</b> {{in which}} Keela and Eddie gave alerts was {{apartment}} 5A. Both dogs alerted behind {{the sofa in}} the living room, and on and under the veranda in the bedroom Madeleine's parents had used. The Polícia Judiciária obtained search warrants to search the house the McCanns had rented on Rua das Flores, and the silver Renault Scénic the couple had hired 24 days after Madeleine went missing. The house and grounds were searched on 2 August. The only alert was from Eddie when he encountered Cuddle Cat, which was lying in the living room; Keela did not give an alert. The police left with boxes of the McCanns' clothes, Cuddle Cat, a pair of latex gloves, suitcases, a notepad, two diaries, including one that Kate had started after the disappearance, and a friend's Bible she had borrowed. A passage the Bible's owner had marked from 2 Samuel, {{about the death of}} a child, was copied into the police case file along with a Portuguese translation. The items were taken to another location, where Eddie alerted to one of the boxes of clothes.|$|E
5|$|The season, {{which began}} on June 1 and ended on November 30, was very {{inactive}} because of strong upper-level wind shear. The wind shear was unusually strong throughout the Caribbean and open Atlantic, and disrupted convection {{in areas of}} disturbed weather so they could not develop. Over sixty African systems had formed and made it westward, but {{when they reached the}} Lesser Antilles, they were dissolved easily. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>area</b> where the shear was minimal—a region encompassing the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic north of the Bahamas and east of Florida—was where the four named storms developed. This makes the 1983 season the least active season since the 1930 Atlantic hurricane season which had only two storms. 1983 and the prior season became the first example of two consecutive years to have no storms form in the Caribbean Sea since 1871, when reliable record began. 1983 also proved to be the first season since 1871 that a storm did not form south of 25°N latitude.|$|E
