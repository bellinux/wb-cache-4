Barnard used the telescope in 1892 to discover a fifth moon of Jupiter, Amalthea.

40|$|For the GAUSS-camera, a novel <b>telescope</b> <b>mounting</b> was {{designed}} (linear mounting). This type of mounting has three strongly coupled degrees of freedom. The inertial pointing {{of the camera}} {{had to be done}} with only one star sensor. So the concept of 'reference binaries' was implemented by means of the control software 'Gazelle plus'. The primary mirror of the GAUSS camera was manufactured and the coating of the correctors supervised. A focusing aid was developed to ascertain the sharpness of the images. The camera was tested during two field tests. Pre-launch mission support concentrated mainly on verfication of optical performance, and on punching and framing the films. During the mission, the scientific programm was conducted based on the actual orbital parameters of the Shuttle. (orig.)

40|$|NASA's New Millennium Program funded {{an effort}} to develop a system cooling technology, which is {{applicable}} to all future infrared, sub-millimeter and millimeter cryogenic space telescopes. In particular, this technology {{is necessary for the}} proposed large space telescope Single Aperture Far-Infrared Telescope (SAFIR) mission. This technology will also enhance the performance and lower the risk and cost for other cryogenic missions. The new paradigm for cooling to low temperatures will involve passive cooling using lightweight deployable membranes that serve both as sunshields and V-groove radiators, in combination with active cooling using mechanical coolers operating down to 4 K. The Cooling Technology for Large Space Telescopes (LST) mission planned to develop and demonstrate a multi-layered sunshield, which is actively cooled by a multi-stage mechanical cryocooler, and further the models and analyses critical to scaling to future missions. The outer four layers of the sunshield cool passively by radiation, while the innermost layer is actively cooled to enable the sunshield to decrease the incident solar irradiance by a factor of more than one million. The cryocooler cools the inner layer of the sunshield to 20 K, and provides cooling to 6 K at a <b>telescope</b> <b>mounting</b> plate. The technology readiness level (TRL) of 7 will be achieved by the active cooling technology following the technology validation flight in Low Earth Orbit. In accordance with the New Millennium charter, tests and modeling are tightly integrated to advance the technology and the flight design for "ST-class" missions. Commercial off-the-shelf engineering analysis products are used to develop validated modeling capabilities to allow the techniques and results from LST to apply {{to a wide variety of}} future missions. The LST mission plans to "rewrite the book" on cryo-thermal testing and modeling techniques, and validate modeling techniques to scale to future space telescopes such as SAFIR...|$|E

40|$|Introduction of CCD astronomical imaging {{has had a}} {{tremendous}} impact on the astrophysical community. The greatest advantage to CCD astronomical imaging is the phenomenal increase in efficiency when compared to photographic plate imaging. Images which previously required exposure times in the range of several hours can be captured {{in a matter of seconds}} using a CCD astronomical imaging system. The disadvantage to using a CCD for astronomical imaging is the loss of information capture due to the change in size of the detector area. Originally equipped with a Boller and Chivens 32 ̆ 2 x 52 ̆ 2 photographic plate, the Mees telescope provided a 0. 4 degree full-field angle. The purpose of the research was to design a focal reducer to reduce the focal ratio of the telescope system from f/ 13. 5 to f/ 4. 5 to enable a larger field of view to be imaged onto the smaller CCD detector area with a 9 -um pixel size. Optics Software for Layout and Optimization(OSLO), lens design software was implemented for designing the system. The original goal to design the system using only readily available lens components from the OSLO database eliminates the need for expensive special order optics components. Several focal reducer/wide-field corrector designs were configured using OSLO. None of the designs using only readily available lens database components met the design criterion. Determination has been made to abandon the restriction to the lens database components in favor of a customized focal reducer/wide-field corrector design. Preliminary research suggests two possible design configurations for the customized focal reducer/wide-field corrector. The first design would consist of a 62 ̆ 2 diameter, f/ 2 collimating lens located at the <b>telescope</b> <b>mounting</b> flange followed by a f/ 4. 5 fully corrected camera system. A second design would consist of a symmetrical Biotar focal reducer design. The Biotar design would require extensive optimization using OSLO. Preliminary research suggests the Biotar design might provide a more fully corrected system...|$|E
