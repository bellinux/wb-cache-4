25|$|From monoids {{and groups}} <b>to</b> <b>rings</b> The {{integral}} monoid ring construction gives a functor from monoids <b>to</b> <b>rings.</b> This functor is left adjoint to the functor that associates <b>to</b> a given <b>ring</b> its underlying multiplicative monoid. Similarly, the integral group ring construction yields a functor from groups <b>to</b> <b>rings,</b> left adjoint <b>to</b> the functor that assigns <b>to</b> a given <b>ring</b> its group of units. One can also {{start with a}} field K and consider the category of K-algebras instead of the category of <b>rings,</b> <b>to</b> get the monoid and group rings over K.|$|R

50|$|In mathematics, more {{specifically}} modern algebra and ring theory, a noncommutative ring is a ring whose multiplication is not commutative; that is, {{there exists a}} and b in R with a·b ≠ b·a. Many authors use the term noncommutative <b>ring</b> <b>to</b> refer <b>to</b> <b>rings</b> which are not necessarily commutative, and hence include commutative rings in their definition. Noncommutative algebra {{is the study of}} results applying <b>to</b> <b>rings</b> that are not required to be commutative. Many important results in the field of noncommutative algebra area apply <b>to</b> commutative <b>rings</b> as special cases.|$|R
5|$|When Rich Attonito {{broke his}} hand, his {{spot in the}} quarter-finals became open. Due to the {{controversial}} loss <b>to</b> <b>Ring,</b> White selected McGee to fight in his place. In the quarter-finals, McGee was set to have a rematch with Ring, but Ring {{pulled out of the}} competition due to a knee injury. James Hammortree stepped in as Ring's replacement. Early in the second round, McGee submitted Hammortree with a rare standing guillotine choke.|$|E
5|$|After the match, Hulk Hogan came <b>to</b> <b>ring</b> {{to check}} on Hart's condition. Hogan had stated during an {{interview}} earlier in the broadcast {{that he wanted to}} face the winner of the match, and Fuji challenged Hogan to face Yokozuna immediately in an impromptu bout. Hogan agreed and entered the ring. Fuji tried to throw salt in Hogan's eyes, but he missed and the salt hit Yokozuna. Hogan performed a leg drop and pinned Yokozuna to win the title in 22 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Between 2:00am and 3:00am on Sunday morning, July 22, {{the peace}} was again broken and fire alarms began <b>to</b> <b>ring</b> {{throughout}} the city. To the west, at the Mount Clare Shops of the B, a 37-car train of coal and oil {{had been set}} on fire. Police, firefighters, and thousands of citizens flocked to the scene. A contingent of 50 marines was dispatched to the area to provide assistance. The cars which had not yet caught fire were detached from those burning, {{and by the time}} the flames were extinguished between seven and nine cars had been burned. Between $11,000 and $12,000 in damage was sustained.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} Rhodes left school, aged 16, he had joined Kirkheaton Cricket Club {{and started to}} take cricket seriously: he watched Yorkshire when they played close to his home and began to {{consider}} {{a career as a}} professional cricketer. Around 1893 he took a job working on the railway in the local town of Mirfield. By now playing regularly for Kirkheaton Second XI, Rhodes's keenness to reach one game on time led him <b>to</b> <b>ring</b> the off-duty bell {{before the end of the}} shift and as a result he lost his job. Subsequently, he worked on a local farm, which allowed him more time for cricket. By 1895 he achieved a place in the Kirkheaton first team, and was recommended to Gala Cricket Club, of Galashiels, Scotland, as a professional.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the final}} orchestral crescendo, the song ends {{with one of}} the most famous final chords in music history. Overdubbed in place of the vocal {{experiment}} from 10 February, this chord was added during a session at EMI's Studio Two on 22 February. Lennon, McCartney, Starr and Evans shared three different pianos, with Martin on a harmonium, and all played an E-major chord simultaneously. The chord was made <b>to</b> <b>ring</b> out for over forty seconds by increasing the recording sound level as the vibration faded out. Towards the end of the chord the recording level was so high that listeners can hear the sounds of the studio, including rustling papers and a squeaking chair.|$|E

5|$|Referring to this period, John Martyn (who in 1973 {{wrote the}} title song of his album Solid Air for and about Drake) {{described}} him as the most withdrawn person he had ever met. He would borrow his mother's car and drive for hours without purpose on occasion, until {{he ran out of}} petrol and had <b>to</b> <b>ring</b> his parents to ask to be collected. Friends have recalled the extent to which his appearance had changed. During particularly bleak periods of his illness, he refused to wash his hair or cut his nails. Early in 1972, Drake had a nervous breakdown, and was hospitalized for five weeks.|$|E
5|$|The {{trailing}} {{edge of the}} transmitter pulse was not perfectly sharp and caused the receiver signals <b>to</b> <b>ring</b> {{for a short time}} even if they were turned on after the pulse was ostensibly complete. This leftover signal caused a large permanent blip known as the transmitter break through which appeared at the short-range end of the tubes (left and bottom). A control known as the Oscillator Bias allowed the exact timing of the receiver's activation relative to the transmitter pulse to be adjusted, normally so the remains of the pulse were just visible.|$|E
5|$|The final {{match was}} for the WWE Championship between Champion John Cena and CM Punk. WWE Chairman Vince McMahon had {{threatened}} to have Cena fired if Punk won. During the match, two separate signature Attitude Adjustment moves by Cena failed to score the victory. More than 30 minutes into the match, Punk performed his Go to Sleep maneuver, striking Cena's ribs and causing Cena {{to fall out of}} the ring. As Punk rolled Cena back into the ring, McMahon and John Laurinaitis emerged from backstage and distracted Punk, resulting in Cena placing Punk in the STF submission hold. Punk did not submit, but McMahon signaled the referee to award Cena the match and sent Laurinaitis <b>to</b> <b>ring</b> the bell. This was reminiscent of the Montreal Screwjob in 1997, where a conspiracy orchestrated by McMahon led to Bret Hart losing his WWF Championship to Shawn Michaels by submission despite Hart never submitting.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} {{story about the}} {{cracking}} of the bell is that it happened when the bell was rung upon the 1835 death of the Chief Justice of the United States, John Marshall. This story originated in 1876, when the volunteer curator of Independence Hall, Colonel Frank Etting, {{announced that he had}} ascertained the truth of the story. While there is little evidence to support this view, it has been widely accepted and taught. Other claims regarding the crack in the bell include stories that it was damaged while welcoming Lafayette on his return to the United States in 1824, that it cracked announcing the passing of the British Catholic Relief Act 1829, and that some boys had been invited <b>to</b> <b>ring</b> the bell, and inadvertently damaged it. David Kimball, in his book compiled for the National Park Service, suggests that it most likely cracked sometime between 1841 and 1845, either on the Fourth of July or on Washington's Birthday.|$|E

However, Aoyama is so enthralled by her that he pursues her anyway. She lives in an empty apartment, containing a sack and a phone. For four days after the audition, she sits perfectly still next to the phone waiting for it <b>to</b> <b>ring.</b> When it finally does, she answers pretending that she never expected Aoyama to call. After several dates, she agrees to accompany him to a seaside hotel, where a smitten Aoyama intends to propose marriage. At the hotel, Asami reveals burn scars on her body. Before making love, Asami demands that Aoyama pledge his love to her and no one else. A deeply moved Aoyama agrees. In the morning, Asami is nowhere to be found.|$|E

25|$|Shelley ringing is similar, {{except that}} the clappers are each orientated in the same direction, so that the two bells {{normally}} ring simultaneously with one movement.

25|$|Normal ringing {{technique}} only {{allows a}} ringer <b>to</b> <b>ring</b> two bells at a time, {{one in each}} hand. Depending {{on the number of}} bells needed for a particular piece and the number of ringers, it may be necessary for each ringer <b>to</b> <b>ring</b> more than two bells at a time or in short succession (four-in-hand) There are also many techniques that change the sound of the bell as it is rung.|$|E
