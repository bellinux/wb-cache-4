5|$|A {{dust devil}} is a strong, well-formed, and {{relatively}} long-lived whirlwind, ranging from small (half a metre wide {{and a few}} metres tall) to large (more than 10 metres wide and more than 1000 metres tall). The primary vertical motion is upward. Dust devils are usually harmless, but can on rare occasions grow large enough <b>to</b> <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> threat to both people and property.|$|E
5|$|Smoke-lifting {{devices were}} not a {{priority}} with the normal single-chimney Pacifics. However, with its double chimney and subsequent fitting of a double Kylchap exhaust in 1937, Humorist continued <b>to</b> <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> problem in this regard and always had small wings {{on either side of}} the chimney. Finally, in the 1950s, it acquired the Peppercorn-type of deflector plates.|$|E
5|$|The New York City Subway {{system is}} infested with rats. Rats are {{sometimes}} seen on platforms, and are commonly seen foraging through garbage thrown onto the tracks. They are believed <b>to</b> <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> health hazard, and on rare instances {{have been known}} to bite humans. Subway stations notorious for rat infestation include Chambers Street, Jay Street–MetroTech, West Fourth Street, Spring Street and 145th Street.|$|E

5|$|The {{meat and}} blubber of the {{dolphins}} caught {{has been found}} to have high levels of mercury, cadmium, the pesticide DDT, and organic contaminants like PCBs. The levels are high enough <b>to</b> <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> health risk for those frequently eating the meat and researchers warn that children and pregnant women shouldn't eat the meat at all. Because of the health concerns, the price of dolphin meat has decreased significantly.|$|E
5|$|The {{species has}} a long history of {{association}} with humans, having been extensively hunted as a pest and furbearer for many centuries, as well as being represented in human folklore and mythology. Because of its widespread distribution and large population, the red fox is one of the most important furbearing animals harvested for the fur trade. Too small <b>to</b> <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> threat to humans, it has extensively benefited from the presence of human habitation, and has successfully colonised many suburban and urban areas.|$|E
5|$|When the {{hurricane}} appeared <b>to</b> <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> threat to Bermuda, its government issued a hurricane watch. Around 24hours before Erin made its closest approach, the watch was upgraded to a hurricane warning. Initial forecasts indicated Erin would pass within 15miles (24km) of the island. As a result, ferry and bus transport was suspended. Officials prepared a {{school to be}} used as an emergency shelter, though few people used it.|$|E

5|$|After {{a six-week}} voyage, the team arrived in Plymouth, England on 8 September 1905. After finally {{arriving}} in England, the side opened their tour against Devon. Cunningham {{played in the}} match which was won easily by the New Zealanders 55–4. Devon were expected <b>to</b> <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> serious challenge, but were overwhelmed and only managed to score a drop-kick. A series of large victories followed against domestic opposition throughout England, {{and by the time}} the All Blacks played their first Test match against Scotland, the team had played and won nineteen matches, and scored 612 points while conceding only 15.|$|E
5|$|Ash {{particles}} {{of less than}} 10 µm diameter suspended in the air {{are known to be}} inhalable, and people exposed to ash falls have experienced respiratory discomfort, breathing difficulty, eye and skin irritation, and nose and throat symptoms. Most of these effects are short-term and are not considered <b>to</b> <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> significant health risk to those without pre-existing respiratory conditions. The health effects of volcanic ash depend on the grain size, mineralogical composition and chemical coatings {{on the surface of the}} ash particles. Additional factors related to potential respiratory symptoms are the frequency and duration of exposure, the concentration of ash in the air and the respirable ash fraction; the proportion of ash with less than 10µm diameter, known as PM10. The social context may also be important.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1950, the National Hurricane Center named officially {{recognized}} tropical {{storms and}} hurricanes. The unnamed hurricane {{was reported to}} have met all the criteria for a tropical cyclone, but it was purposefully left unnamed. This was done to avoid confusion among the media and the public, who were focusing on the damage from the initial nor'easter, as the hurricane itself was not expected <b>to</b> <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> major threat to land. It was the eighth nameable storm of the 1991 Atlantic hurricane season. Had the system been named for whatever reason, it would've received the name Henri, which was the next name on the 1991 list after Grace.|$|E

5|$|Chronic wasting disease, {{transmitted}} by a misfolded protein {{known as a}} prion, affects the brain tissue in elk, and has been detected throughout their range in North America. First documented in the late 1960s in mule deer, the disease has affected elk on game farms and in the wild {{in a number of}} regions. Elk that have contracted the disease begin to show weight loss, increased watering needs, disorientation and listlessness, and at an advanced stage the disease leads to death. The disease is similar to but not the same as mad cow disease, and no risks to humans have been documented, nor has the disease been demonstrated <b>to</b> <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> threat to domesticated cattle. In 2002, South Korea banned the importation of elk antler velvet due to concerns about chronic wasting disease.|$|E
5|$|Finally in 520, Vitalian was {{appointed}} ordinary consul for the year, sharing {{the office with}} Rusticius. Nevertheless, the former rebel continued <b>to</b> <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> potential challenge to Justin, and more importantly to his nephew and heir-apparent, Justinian (r. 527–565). Thus, in July {{of the same year}} he was murdered inside the Great Palace along with his secretary Paulus and his domesticus (aide) Celerianus. According to John of Nikiou, he was killed because he was plotting against Justin; most chroniclers, however, put the responsibility for the crime on Justinian's desire to rid himself of a potential rival for his uncle's succession.|$|E
5|$|His successor, Tanutamun, {{also made}} a failed attempt to regain Egypt for Nubia. He {{successfully}} defeated Necho, the native Egyptian puppet ruler installed by Ashurbanipal, taking Thebes in the process. The Assyrians then sent a large army southwards. Tantamani (Tanutamun) was heavily routed and fled back to Nubia. The Assyrian army sacked Thebes {{to such an extent}} it never truly recovered. A native ruler, Psammetichus I was placed on the throne, as a vassal of Ashurbanipal, and the Nubians were never again <b>to</b> <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> threat to either Assyria or Egypt.|$|E

5|$|Lithuania {{was ruled}} {{during the early}} 13th century {{by a number of}} dukes and princes {{presiding}} over various fiefdoms and tribes. They were loosely bonded by commonalities of religion and tradition, trade, kinship, joint military campaigns, and the presence of captured prisoners from neighboring areas. Western merchants and missionaries began seeking control of the area during the 12th century, establishing the city of Riga, Latvia in 1201. Their efforts in Lithuania were temporarily halted by defeat at the Battle of Saule in 1236, but armed Christian orders continued <b>to</b> <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> threat. The country had also undergone incursions by the Mongol Empire.|$|E
5|$|Night {{sharks are}} quick, nocturnally active, {{schooling}} predators that feed mainly on small bony fishes and squid. Reproduction is viviparous {{as with the}} other members of its family; females mate during the summer and give birth to litters of usually 1218 pups after a gestation period of a year. This deepwater species is not known <b>to</b> <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> danger to humans. It is caught incidentally by commercial tuna and swordfish longline fisheries in the western Atlantic, and also by a targeted longline fishery operating off northeastern Brazil. The night shark is highly valued for its fins, and additionally as a source of meat, liver oil, and fishmeal. However, most sharks caught off northeastern Brazil have been found to contain unsafe concentrations of mercury.|$|E
5|$|On September 30, 1977, Amway {{bought the}} network. Soon after the purchase, Mutual began {{developing}} {{what would become}} the first nationwide commercial broadcast satellite network, leading to the end of decades of reliance on telephone lines for the broadcast industry's transmission capacity. In 1979, Amway purchased WCFL from the Chicago Federation of Labor. For the first time, the network that had been founded by radio stations directly controlled a station of its own, and in one of the country's largest markets. Mutual also reached its greatest number of affiliates that year—950. This was fewer than ABC, whose multipronged approach had proven very successful, but far in front of NBC and CBS. It appeared that Amway was ready <b>to</b> <b>pose</b> <b>a</b> major challenge to the industry leaders.|$|E
