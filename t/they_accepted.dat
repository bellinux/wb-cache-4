5|$|Domitian also heavily prosecuted {{corruption}} among public officials, removing jurors if <b>they</b> <b>accepted</b> bribes and rescinding legislation when {{a conflict}} of interest was suspected. He ensured that libellous writings, especially those directed against himself, were punishable by exile or death. Actors were likewise regarded with suspicion, as their performances provided an opportunity for satire {{at the expense of the}} government. Consequently, he forbade mimes from appearing on stage in public.|$|E

5|$|Although Poedjangga Baroe {{writers were}} united by nationalism, they had {{different}} views on traditional culture. Some, such as Armijn and Alisjahbana, considered {{an understanding of}} Western culture and history key to development. Others, such Sanusi, emphasized the need for Eastern values, though <b>they</b> <b>accepted</b> some aspects of Western culture. Writers for Poedjangga Baroe did not share religious views. Main contributors, including the founders, came from religious backgrounds ranging from near-secularism to orthodox Islam. Stemming from these conflicting cultural views, between September 1935 and June 1939, numerous polemics {{were published in the}} magazine, discussing the best course of action for Indonesian cultural development.|$|E
5|$|Cleomenes {{estimated}} that Argos {{would be easier}} to capture while filled with festival-goers and spectators to cause panic. During the night, he seized the rugged area above the city's theatre. The people of the city were too terrified to offer resistance. <b>They</b> <b>accepted</b> a garrison, delivered twenty hostages to Cleomenes and became Spartan allies. The capture of Argos gave Cleomenes' reputation a massive boost, since no Spartan king had ever managed to seize Argos. Even Pyrrhus of Epirus, {{one of the most famous}} generals of the age, had been killed while trying to take the city.|$|E

5|$|Crytek then {{pitched the}} game to {{different}} publishers, and eventually, in 2009, the company pitched the two projects to Microsoft. According to Nick Button-Brown, the general manager at Crytek, the game was not functional at that time, and only served {{to prove to the}} publisher that a first-person melee game was fun for players. The representative from Microsoft, Phil Spencer, admired Crytek's intention to expand, and thought that Microsoft's games line up for the Xbox 360 was lacking a first-person melee-combat game. As a result, <b>they</b> <b>accepted</b> to publish Kingdoms, and rejected Kings. The two companies agreed that the project would be a natural fit for Microsoft's yet-to-be-announced Kinect.|$|E
5|$|Harvey was {{inducted}} into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 2000, in the first annual induction of two players since the inaugural ten members were announced in 1996. In 2009, Harvey was one of the 55 inaugural inductees into the ICC Cricket Hall of Fame. He was also inducted into the Sport Australia Hall of Fame in 1985. Harvey vociferously called for Shane Warne and Mark Waugh to be banned from cricket after it was revealed that <b>they</b> <b>accepted</b> money from bookmakers to give pitch and weather information and the ACB privately fined them. He lamented the decline in player conduct in the modern era, also criticising the modern advent of sledging.|$|E

5|$|In {{seeking to}} {{discipline}} the nuns, the Vatican did not contact {{any one of}} them personally, and did not respond to direct individual communication. Rather, the superiors of the nuns were asked to write letters verifying whether or not the nuns were in line with Catholic teaching on abortion, and a variety of responses were received from the superiors. A few nuns disavowed their position on abortion and the cases were quickly closed. Most nuns held to their earlier conviction, although their superiors sent letters saying that <b>they</b> <b>accepted</b> Church teaching. Once a nun's superior had {{sent a letter to the}} Vatican, the case was closed, without any further attempt to prevent the nun from speaking out on the issues.|$|E
5|$|It {{took the}} Flyers eight weeks {{in order to}} have a game played; <b>they</b> <b>accepted</b> the Gas City Tigers' {{challenge}} to play in Gas City, Indiana, on November 18. The Tigers were 9–0 and outscored their opponents 443–9 this season. Halfback Mickey Hole scored a 45-yard rushing touchdown three minutes into the game. On the next possession, the Flyers scored again; Kenneth Huffine scored the touchdown, and Cooney Checkaye kicked the point after, which made the score 13–0. Near the beginning of the second quarter, Checkaye scored, but the extra point was missed. The Tigers scored their only touchdown in the game in the third quarter. The final score of the game was 19–7.|$|E
