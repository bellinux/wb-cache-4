5|$|Early in {{the second}} half, Jensen made another save, this time from Terry McDermott. Brugge's first {{significant}} chance came a few minutes afterwards, when a cross-field pass by René Vandereycken reached Jan Sørensen on <b>the</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the pitch. Sørensen's subsequent shot was blocked by Liverpool captain Emlyn Hughes. The blocked shot was not cleared, but Ray Clemence reached the ball before Brugge's Lajos Kű could reach it and score. After this Kű was substituted with Dirk Sanders. Liverpool made a substitution minutes later, with Steve Heighway replacing Case. Liverpool's substitution had more effect, as Heighway gave Liverpool more width on <b>the</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the pitch. Two minutes after Heighway's introduction, Kenny Dalglish received {{the ball in the}} Brugge penalty area from a Graeme Souness pass and placed his shot over a diving Jensen to give Liverpool a 1–0 lead.|$|E
5|$|Helvellyn is {{a popular}} area for winter {{climbing}} in the Lake District. The steep headwall above Red Tarn contains several graded routes, clustered around the prow-shaped buttress on <b>the</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the face, known to climbers as Viking Buttress, and {{in a couple of}} gullies which lead to the summit.|$|E

5|$|The owls {{shown are}} recognizable, but not sculpted naturalistically: {{the shape of}} the beak, the length of the legs, and details of plumage deviate from those of the owls that are {{indigenous}} to the region. Their plumage is colored like the deity's wings in red, black and white; it is bilaterally similar but not perfectly symmetrical. Both owls have one more feather on <b>the</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> their plumage than on the left-hand side. The legs, feet and talons are red.|$|E
5|$|Each {{receiver}} antenna {{was sent to}} one of the channels of the displays in turn, causing one of the displays to refresh. For instance, at a given instant the switch might be set to send the signal to {{the left side of the}} azimuth display. The timebase generator was triggered to start sweeping the CRT dot up the screen after the transmission ended. Reflections would cause the dot to be deflected to the left, creating a blip whose vertical location could be measured against a scale to determine range. The switch would then move to the next position and cause <b>the</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the display to be redrawn, but the signal inverted so the dot moved to the right. The switching occurred fast enough that the display looked continuous.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{began to}} get a {{foothold}} in the match after 30 minutes, their best chance came in the 36th minute when a shot by Murphy went over the crossbar. Three minutes later, their approach paid off as they scored. A long-range shot from Steven Gerrard deflected off United midfielder David Beckham and into the United goal to give Liverpool a 1–0 lead. Three minutes after the goal, United had a chance to equalise: A shot by midfielder Juan Sebastián Verón was saved by Dudek, but the ball rebounded to Scholes, but his subsequent shot was blocked by Henchoz. After a free-kick by Beckham just before half-time was saved by Dudek, Liverpool counter-attacked through midfielder El Hadji Diouf down <b>the</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the pitch, though his subsequent cross into the penalty area was intercepted by Keane.|$|E

5|$|Liverpool kicked-off {{the match}} {{and they had}} first chance of the match in the fourth minute, but the free-kick by midfielder Murphy was caught by United goalkeeper Fabien Barthez. Defender Henchoz was shown a yellow card in the 12th minute and United midfielder Giggs had the first shot of the match, which was saved by Liverpool goalkeeper Jerzy Dudek. Twice {{in the next few}} minutes, Liverpool had chances from moves down <b>the</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the pitch. On both occasions, however, the pass into the penalty area was intercepted. United had a chance to score in the 20th minute. Keane passed to Scholes, who found Giggs on the {{left-hand}} side of the pitch. His cross into the penalty area found striker Ruud van Nistelrooy, but his shot went wide of the Liverpool goal.|$|E
5|$|The {{police officer}} who {{discovered}} the wreck initially suspected that only the semi had gone off the road. After further investigation, he found the van and called for emergency services, whose arrival was delayed by freezing rain. The rear wall and {{a large portion of}} <b>the</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the van, including three rows of seats, had been torn away, ejecting several occupants. Seven players and the wife of the team coach were pronounced dead at the scene. The coach, his daughter and the two other players survived the accident and were rushed to Chaleur Regional Hospital in Bathurst. Of the injured, one was listed in critical condition, and two in stable. The fourth was released shortly after the accident. The driver of the truck was not injured.|$|E

More generally, it was shown by Imielinski and Lipski that Codd tables are a weak representation system if the query language is restricted to projections, selections (and renaming of columns). However, as soon as we add either joins or unions to the query language, even this weak property is lost, as evidenced in the next section.|$|E

5|$|Watched by a {{crowd of}} 100,000, the first 90 minutes of the match were goalless as both sides {{struggled}} to create goalscoring chances. Liverpool defender Gerry Byrne broke his collarbone early in the match but carried on as there were no substitutes. He {{was involved in the}} opening goal in extra time. Byrne found striker Roger Hunt in the 93rd minute, with a cross from <b>the</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the pitch, which Hunt headed into the Leeds goal to give Liverpool the lead. Leeds equalised seven minutes later when Billy Bremner scored. However, Liverpool regained the lead in the 113th minute when striker Ian St. John headed in a pass from Ian Callaghan. Liverpool won the match 2–1 to win the FA Cup for the first time.|$|E
5|$|Athletic {{kicked the}} game off, {{and had an}} {{opportunity}} after five minutes, when Mikel Rico crossed for Aduriz, but he was prevented from making contact with the ball by Jordi Alba. Five minutes later, Barcelona launched a counter-attack starting with goalkeeper Marc-André ter Stegen and ending with Neymar volleying {{the ball into the}} goal, but it was ruled out for offside. Soon after, Iago Herrerín saved from Messi. In the 20th minute, Messi scored the first goal of the game, taking possession on <b>the</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the pitch and beating four defenders before finishing with a near-post shot. Barcelona had more chances after this, with Herrerín making saves from Neymar. In the 36th minute, Neymar scored the second goal of the game, finishing from close range when set up by Suárez, after earlier work by Messi and Rakitić. Near {{the end of the first}} half, Andoni Iraola set up Iñaki Williams, whose volley missed the target. Piqué and Iraola received yellow cards at the end of the first half, for fouls on Aduriz and Suárez respectively.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea {{created their}} first chance {{of the match}} after 18 minutes – a shot from Lampard which hit Kolo Touré. They fought back to equalise two minutes later. Ballack {{launched}} the ball to Drogba on <b>the</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> Arsenal’s penalty area. Diverting his markers who attempted to set the offside trap, Drogba took the ball and shot it past Manuel Almunia's goal to score. The equaliser led to Chelsea asserting themselves in the match as the team began to build up possession. Denílson, at the midway point of the half, received the game’s first yellow card for a foul on Essien; the Chelsea midfielder was later booked for a tackle on Baptista. Sticks of celery were thrown at Fàbregas before he took a corner close to stoppage time; targeting opponents with the vegetable was a Chelsea supporter’s ritual going back {{more than two decades}} and originated from song.|$|E

5|$|Even {{though the}} fertile {{crescent}} civilizations {{are considered the}} oldest in history, {{at the time the}} Burney Relief was made other late bronze age civilizations were equally in full bloom. Travel and cultural exchange were not commonplace, but nevertheless possible. To the east, Elam with its capital Susa was in frequent military conflict with Isin, Larsa and later Babylon. Even further, the Indus Valley Civilization was already past its peak, and in China, the Erlitou culture blossomed. To the southwest, Egypt was ruled by the 12th dynasty, further to the west the Minoan civilization, centred on Crete with the Old Palace in Knossos, dominated the Mediterranean. To the north of Mesopotamia, the Anatolian Hittites were establishing their Old Kingdom over the Hattians; they brought an end to Babylon's empire with the sack of the city in 1531BCE. Indeed, Collon mentions this raid as possibly being the reason for the damage to <b>the</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the relief.|$|E
5|$|The {{first leg}} {{was held at}} the Emile Versé Stadium, the home ground of Anderlecht. It was the home side that opened the scoring in the 17th minute. Striker Rob Rensenbrink {{advanced}} down <b>the</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the pitch and passed the ball across the Liverpool penalty area towards midfielder Franky Vercauteren who headed the ball into the Liverpool goal. Five minutes later, Anderlecht came close to extending their lead, but Benny Nielsen's shot was saved by Liverpool goalkeeper Ray Clemence. Liverpool started to exert themselves upon the match following this and equalised in the 27th minute when midfielder Jimmy Case scored {{from the edge of the}} Anderlecht penalty area. Five minutes before half-time Anderlecht extended their lead. Defender François Van der Elst found space in the Liverpool defence and his shot beat Clemence in the Liverpool goal to give Anderlecht a 2–1 lead. Anderlecht defender Jean Thissen was shown a yellow card before the end of the half for a late tackle on Liverpool striker Kenny Dalglish.|$|E
5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race—one on Friday, and two on Saturday. The first session lasted 90 minutes, {{while the second}} session lasted 45 minutes. The third and final session lasted 60 minutes. In the first practice session, Clint Bowyer was fastest, placing ahead of Biffle in second, and Johnson in third. Gordon was fourth fastest, and Edwards placed fifth. Kurt Busch, David Ragan, Jeff Burton, Keselowski and Kevin Harvick rounded out the top ten fastest drivers in the session. Max Papis damaged <b>the</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> his car when he hit the turn two wall; Jamie McMurray, David Reutimann and Mike Bliss also hit the turn two wall. Bliss went to a back-up car because {{the right side of}} his car was heavily damaged. John Andretti's engine failed during the early phase of the session, and Andretti changed engines. Burton switched to a back-up car after he collided with the turn two outside wall.|$|E

5|$|United {{had another}} {{chance in the}} 66th minute when Verón crossed from <b>the</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the pitch to Scholes, but his shot was saved by Dudek. A Liverpool attack in the 72nd minute ended after Baros put the ball out for a goal-kick. From the {{subsequent}} kick, Barthez found Giggs, who ran {{through the middle of}} the pitch, but his pass to Beckham was intercepted by Liverpool. United subsequently replaced Brown with striker Ole Gunnar Solskjær. United had an appeal for a penalty in the 77th minute when Scholes went down near Liverpool midfielder Dietmar Hamann, but Durkin turned down the appeal. Minutes later, Van Nistelrooy had another chance to score, but his shot from inside the Liverpool penalty area was saved by Dudek. Five minutes later, Liverpool scored through Owen. A pass by Silvestre was intercepted by Liverpool, Hamann passed to Owen, who beat Barthez to give Liverpool a 2–0 lead. Four minutes later, Liverpool had a chance to extend their lead, but Šmicer, who had replaced Baroš, missed the target. No further goals were scored and Liverpool won 2–0 to win the League Cup for the seventh time.|$|E
5|$|When <b>the</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the {{equation}} {{is a positive}} real number, the solution corresponds to an epispiral. When the argument θ1 – θ0 equals ±90°×k, the cosine goes to zero and the radius goes to infinity. Thus, when k is less than one, the range of allowed angles becomes small and the force is repulsive (red curve on right in Figure7). On the other hand, when k is greater than one, the range of allowed angles increases, corresponding to an attractive force (green, cyan and blue curves on left in Figure7); the orbit of the particle can even wrap around the center several times. The possible values of the parameter k may range from zero to infinity, which corresponds to values of μ ranging from negative infinity up to the positive upper limit, L12/m. Thus, for all attractive inverse-cube forces (negative μ) there is a corresponding epispiral orbit, as for some repulsive ones (μ < L12/m), as illustrated in Figure 7. Stronger repulsive forces correspond to a faster linear motion.|$|E
5|$|Graves, {{who fell}} to second in class, went into Rivage's gravel trap with a left-front brake failure, {{causing him to}} retire. Toyota retired their No. 6 entry from the race because of an engine failure caused by an {{electrical}} fault. Smoke bellowed from the rear-end of Nakajima's Toyota upon leaving La Source and he {{went back into the}} pit lane where his mechanics worked on rectifying the problem allowing Oliver Jarvis in the No. 8 Audi to inherit the lead. Webber drove straight at the Bus Stop chicane, spun, and drove into the pit lane. Stefan Mücke, who was affected by turbocharger issues, lost control of the No. 66 Ford after one of his rear tyres was punctured, and narrowly avoided going airborne. The vehicle made heavy contact with the left-hand side barriers at Raidillon, heavily damaging the front-end and removing both of its doors, as well as littering debris onto the circuit. His car stopped in the centre of the track, causing the No. 2 Porsche to swerve to avoid hitting the vehicle, and the safety car was deployed to allow marshals to repair the heavily damaged tyre barrier. Drivers were instructed to steer onto <b>the</b> <b>right-hand</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the track at Eau Rouge because the stranded car blocked the turn. Mücke was transported to the track's medical centre and later taken to the local hospital for a precautionary check-up because of bruising.|$|E
