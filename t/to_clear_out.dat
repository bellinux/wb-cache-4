Land in {{neighbouring}} Laos and Cambodia was also sprayed with Agent Orange during the Vietnam War because forests on the border with Vietnam were used by the Vietcong. Some countries, such as Canada, saw testing, while other countries, such as Brazil, used the herbicide <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>out</b> sections of land for agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Hot Potato {{features}} seven {{missions and}} seven score challenges. Mission mode requires the player <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>out</b> a set number {{of an alien}} species. There are multiple alien species in the mode and the mission does not finish until the player gets rid of enough of a certain species chosen by the game from the road. Score challenge mode tasks the player with clearing away {{a certain number of}} aliens in order to reach a pre-determined score. The game contains bonus levels which are longer than normal levels if the player is able to complete missions under a certain time period.|$|E
5|$|Malagasy farmers {{continue}} to use fire <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>out</b> agricultural land and pasture for livestock, promoting grass growth while inhibiting forest regeneration. The fires sometimes burn {{out of control and}} destroy forest edges along with the natural flora, increasing the damage even further than intended. Due to the nature of Madagascar's geology and soil, tavy also depletes the fertility of the soil, accelerating the crop rotation rate and necessitating expansion into primary forests.|$|E

5|$|Beyond {{the ruins}} of old Phlan, the party enters the slum area—one of two quests {{immediately}} available to new parties. This quest requires the clearing of the slum block and allows a new party to quickly gain experience. The second quest is <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>out</b> Sokol Keep, located on Thorn Island. This fortified area is inhabited by the undead, {{which can only be}} defeated with silver weapons and magic. The characters' adventure is later expanded to encompass the outlying areas of the Moonsea region.

The characters fight Tyranthraxus the Flamed One in a climactic final battle.|$|E
5|$|Joining the Battle of Hürtgen Forest, the {{division}} moved into defensive {{positions in the}} vicinity of Wuustwezel, Belgium on 23 October 1944. The Timberwolves were then assigned to British Field Marshal Bernard Montgomery's Anglo-Canadian 21st Army Group under the British I Corps, along with the U.S. 7th Armored Division, in order <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>out</b> the Scheldt Estuary and open the port of Antwerp. While the U.S. 7th Armored Division was assigned static duty holding the right flank of the gains made during the failed Market Garden operation, the 104th Infantry Division was to assist the First Canadian Army in the taking of the Scheldt. The Timberwolves traveled across France by train and debarked near the Belgian-Dutch border and waited for word to attack, taking the place of the experienced British 49th Infantry Division on the left flank and the Polish 1st Armored Division on the right.|$|E

The task force was given the mission <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>out</b> North Korean forces in the mountainous region. At the same time, the 8th Army formed Task Force Bradley, consisting of elements of the U.S. 8th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division under the command of Brigadier General Joseph S. Bradley, the 2nd Division′s assistant commander. Task Force Bradley was tasked with defending P'ohang-dong from the North Korean 766th Independent Regiment which was infiltrating the town.|$|E

5|$|Typhoon Joe, {{known in}} the Philippines as Typhoon Nitang, {{affected}} the Philippines, China, and Vietnam during July1980. An area of disturbed weather formed near the Caroline Islands on July14. Shower activity gradually became better organized, and two days later, the system was upgraded into a tropical depression. On July18, the depression was classified as Tropical Storm Joe. Initially, Joe moved northwest, but began {{to turn to the}} west-northwest, anchored by a subtropical ridge to its north. Joe start to deepen at a faster clip, and attained typhoon intensity on July19. The eye began <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>out,</b> and the next day, Joe reached its highest intensity. Shortly thereafter, Joe moved ashore the Philippines. There, 31people were killed and 300,000others were directly affected. Around 5,000homes were destroyed, resulting in an additional 29,000 homeless. Damage in the nation was estimated at $14.5million (1980USD).|$|E
5|$|During the night, the 113th and 114th Infantry Brigades {{were ordered}} {{out of the}} wood and the 115th Brigade {{assembled}} in their place. The next day, the 115th Brigade prepared an assault <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>out</b> the Germans. The 115th Brigade's commanding officer, Brigadier-General H. J. Evans, wanted to launch a surprise attack but was overruled. The subsequent bombardment to support the attack fell short in places, hitting British troops and provoking German artillery fire. As well as the friendly fire, the barrage also caught German troops in the open as they fled from the wood. The remaining Germans offered determined resistance and the 16th Welsh were held up by machine gun fire {{and the use of}} a flamethrower. Despite this, the brigade was able to clear Mametz Wood {{by the end of the}} day. The German second line position was on higher ground which dominated the edge of the wood and, coupled with artillery fire, resulted in the brigade pulling back to its start line to avoid further casualties.|$|E
5|$|On August 10, the Eighth Army {{organized}} Task Force P'ohang—the ROK 17th, 25th, and 26th Regiments {{as well as}} the ROK 1st Anti-Guerrilla Battalion, Marine Battalion and {{a battery}} from the US 18th Field Artillery Battalion. This task force was given the mission <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>out</b> North Korean forces in the mountainous region. At the same time, Eighth Army formed Task Force Bradley, consisting of elements of the US 8th Infantry Regiment, 2nd Infantry Division. Task Force Bradley was tasked with defending P'ohang-dong. What followed was a complicated series of fights throughout the region around P'ohang-dong and An'gang-ni as South Korean ground forces, aided by US air forces, engaged groups of North Korean forces in the area. The NK 12th Division was operating in the valley west of P'ohang-dong and was able to push back Task Force P'ohang and the ROK Capital Division, which was along the line to the east. At the same time, the NK 766th Infantry Regiment and elements of the NK 5th Division fought Task Force Bradley at and south of P'ohang-dong. US naval fire drove the NK troops from the town, but it became a bitterly contested no man's land as fighting moved to the surrounding hills.|$|E

5|$|Cope and Marsh {{used their}} {{personal}} wealth to fund expeditions each summer, then spent the winter publishing their discoveries. Small armies of fossil hunters in mule-drawn wagons or on trains were soon sending literally tons of fossils back east. The paleontological digs lasted fifteen years, from 1877 to 1892. The workers for both Cope and Marsh suffered hardships {{related to the}} weather, as well as sabotage and obstruction by the other scientist's workers. Reed was locked out of the Como train station by Carlin, {{and was forced to}} haul the bones down the bluff and crate the specimens on the train platform in the bitter cold. Cope directed Carlin to set up his own quarry in Como Bluff, while Marsh sent Reed to spy on his former friend. As Reed's Quarry #4 dried up, Marsh ordered Reed <b>to</b> <b>clear</b> <b>out</b> the bone fragments from the other quarries. Reed reported he had destroyed all the remaining bones to keep them away from Cope. Concerned that strangers were encroaching on Reed's quarries, Marsh sent Lakes to Como to assist in excavations, and in June 1879 visited Como himself. Cope likewise toured his own quarries in August. Although Marsh's men continued to open new quarries and discover more fossils, relations between Lakes and Reed soured, with each offering his resignation in August. Marsh attempted to placate the two by sending each to opposite ends of the quarries, but after being forced to abandon one bone quarry in a freezing blizzard, Lakes submitted his resignation and returned to teaching in 1880. The departure of Lakes did not ease tensions among Marsh's men; Lake's replacement, a railroad man named Kennedy, felt {{he did not have to}} report to Reed, and the fighting between the two caused Marsh's other workers to quit. Marsh tried separating Kennedy and Reed, and sent Williston's brother Frank to Como in an effort to keep the peace. Frank Williston ended up leaving Marsh's employ and taking up residence with Carlin. Cope's own digging in Como began faltering, and Carlin's replacements soon quit work altogether.|$|E
