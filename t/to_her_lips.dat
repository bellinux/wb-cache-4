'The {{construction}} of his painting {{turns on the}} orchestration of these geometrical volumes, which shift their position, develop, interweave following the movements in space of the painter himself. Already we can see, {{as a consequence of}} this movement introduced into an art which, we were told, had no relation to movement, a plurality of perspective points. These architectural combinations of cubes supported the image as it appears to the senses, that of a woman whose torso is naked, holding in her left hand a cup while with the other hand she lifts a spoon <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips.</b> It can be easily understood that Metzinger is trying to master chance, he insists that each of the parts of his work must enter into a logical relationship with all the others. Each should, precisely, justify the other, the composition should be an organism as rigorous as possible and anything that looks accidental should be eliminated, or at least kept under control. None of that prevented either the expression of his temperament or the exercise of his imagination.' (Albert Gleizes) ...|$|E
2500|$|On July 7, 1865, at 1:15 P.M., a {{procession}} led by General Hartranft escorted the four condemned prisoners through {{the courtyard and}} {{up the steps to}} the gallows. Each prisoner's ankles and wrists were bound by manacles. Surratt led the way, wearing a black bombazine dress, black bonnet, and black veil. More than 1,000 people, including government officials, members of the US armed forces, friends and family of the accused, official witnesses, and reporters, watched. General Hancock limited attendance to those who had a ticket, and only those who had a good reason to be present were given a ticket. (Most of those present were military officers and soldiers, as fewer than 200 tickets had been printed.) Alexander Gardner, who had photographed the body of Booth and taken portraits of several of the male conspirators while they were imprisoned aboard naval ships, photographed the execution for the government. Hartranft read the order for their execution. Surratt, either weak from her illness or swooning in fear (perhaps both), had to be supported by two soldiers and her priests. The condemned were seated in chairs, Surratt almost collapsing into hers. She was seated to the right of the others, the traditional [...] "seat of honor" [...] in an execution. White cloth was used to bind their arms to their sides and their ankles and thighs together. The cloths around Surratt's legs were tied around her dress below the knees. Each person was ministered to by a member of the clergy. From the scaffold, Powell said, [...] "Mrs. Surratt is innocent. She doesn't deserve to die with the rest of us." [...] Fathers Jacob and Wiget prayed over her and held a crucifix <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips.</b> About 16 minutes elapsed from the time the prisoners entered the courtyard until they were ready for execution.|$|E

6000|$|Florida noiselessly {{opened the}} door, and met the servant {{with a tray}} of coffee. She put <b>her</b> finger <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip,</b> and motioned <b>her</b> not <b>to</b> enter, asking in a whisper: [...] "What time is it, Nina? I forgot to wind my watch." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{lifted his}} hand <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> and let it go. He was startled.|$|E

50|$|In 1963, she was {{involved}} in a violent automobile accident in France. For six hours, she lay unconscious, unaware that she nearly lost her right eye.

She spent the next two years undergoing plastic surgery, and no damage remained in her face, except for a distinctive curl of <b>her</b> upper <b>lip.</b>|$|R
60|$|She put <b>her</b> finger <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip,</b> {{and smiled}} {{with the air}} of a lady benefactress; then, with a few words of {{official}} sympathy, she encouraged him to get well, and flitted to the next bed, where she bestowed a jacqueminot rosebud on a Chinaman dying of cancer.|$|R
60|$|Armand {{rose from}} his knees. Her eyes were calling <b>to</b> him, <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> were ready <b>to</b> yield.|$|R

6000|$|When Mr. Prince {{returned}} an hour later, he found Carry {{sitting on a}} low stool at Mrs. Starbottle's feet. Her head was in her stepmother's lap, and she had sobbed herself to sleep. Mrs. Starbottle put <b>her</b> finger <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip.</b> [...] "I told you she would come. God bless you, Jack! and good night." ...|$|R
60|$|With {{a muffled}} cry he sprang upon her, {{throwing}} his arms about <b>her</b> and attempting <b>to</b> drag <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> <b>to</b> his.|$|R

60|$|There she {{had passed}} the night and {{a portion of the}} ensuing day, visited only by Cypros, who, when Eva would have inquired the cause of all this mysterious cruelty and startling {{contrast}} to the dispositions which had preceded it, only shook her head and pressed <b>her</b> finger <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip,</b> <b>to</b> signify the impossibility of her conversing with her captive.|$|R
60|$|I had dreamt that <b>to</b> kiss <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> was {{ultimate}} satisfaction. But it {{was indeed}} {{only the beginning of}} desires. I told her my one ambition was <b>to</b> marry <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|Before {{he could}} prevent it {{the girl had}} seized his hand and pressed it <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|E

60|$|Romola {{seized the}} hand that was against her cheek, and put it <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> in silence.|$|E
60|$|The landlady {{answered}} with some appearance of effort--the effort {{of a person}} who was carefully considering her words before she permitted them <b>to</b> pass <b>her</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|R
6000|$|The Second Lady: [...] "I am so {{glad you}} {{happened}} to ask me. It has all been so dreadfully sudden, and I am quite bewildered. Let me think {{if there is anything}} more!" [...] As she stands with <b>her</b> finger <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip,</b> the first lady makes a movement as if about to speak, but does not say anything. [...] "No, there is nothing more, I believe." ...|$|R
