5|$|Cashews (Anacardium occidentale) grow as a drupe that is {{attached}} to the cashew apple, the fruit of the cashew tree. Native to northeastern Brazil, the cashew was introduced to India and East Africa in the sixteenth century, where they remain a major commercial crop. <b>The</b> <b>nut</b> must be roasted to remove the caustic shell oil before being consumed.|$|E
5|$|Frith {{recorded}} the album at David Vorhaus's Kaleidophon Studios in London on 11â€“13 and 15 July 1974, {{where he played}} a modified 1936 Gibson K-11. He added an extra pickup over the strings at <b>the</b> <b>nut,</b> enabling him to amplify sound {{from both sides of}} the fretted note. He then split the fretboard in two with a capo, effectively giving him two guitars, each amplified separately that he could play independently with each hand. To split the sounds further he attached alligator clips at various positions on the strings. The net result was a guitar with multiple sound sources that could be channelled to a mixer and distributed across the stereo soundscape.|$|E
50|$|As {{with many}} Fagaceae, <b>the</b> <b>nuts</b> of many Castanopsis species are edible. The trees may be grown for their nuts, {{but more often}} they are used as {{forestry}} or ornamental trees and <b>the</b> <b>nuts</b> are collected opportunistically. Among many animals, such as tits, corvids, rodents, deer and pigs, <b>the</b> <b>nuts</b> are popular as food too.|$|R
50|$|Crushing: To make <b>the</b> shea <b>nuts</b> into butter, {{they must}} be crushed. Traditionally, this is done with mortars and pestles. It {{requires}} lifting the pestles and grinding <b>the</b> <b>nuts</b> into <b>the</b> mortars to crush <b>the</b> <b>nuts</b> {{so they can be}} roasted.|$|R
5000|$|A jam nut {{is often}} used when a nut needs to be locked in place without {{clamping}} against another object. <b>The</b> jam <b>nut</b> essentially acts as the [...] "other object", as <b>the</b> two <b>nuts</b> are tightened against each other. They {{can also be used}} to secure an item on a fastener without applying force to that object. This is achieved by first tightening one of <b>the</b> <b>nuts</b> onto <b>the</b> item. Then <b>the</b> other <b>nut</b> is screwed down on top of <b>the</b> first <b>nut.</b> <b>The</b> inner <b>nut</b> is then slackened back and tightened against <b>the</b> outer <b>nut.</b>|$|R
5|$|One of {{the chief}} {{measures}} by which Ranavalona maintained order within her realm was through the traditional practice of trial by the ordeal of tangena. A poison was extracted from <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> of the native tangena (Tanghinia venenifera) shrub and ingested, with the outcome determining innocence or guilt. If nobles or freemen were compelled to undergo the ordeal, the poison was typically administered to the accused only after dog and rooster stand-ins had already died from the poison's effects, while {{among members of the}} slave class (andevo), the ordeal required them to immediately ingest the poison themselves. The accused would be fed the poison along with three pieces of chicken skin: if all three pieces of skin were vomited up then innocence was declared, but death or a failure to regurgitate all three pieces of skin indicated guilt. According to 19th-century Malagasy historian Raombana, {{in the eyes of the}} greater populace, the tangena ordeal was believed to represent a sort of celestial justice in which the public placed their unquestioning faith, even to the point of accepting a verdict of guilt in a case of innocence as a just but unknowable divine mystery.|$|E
25|$|The {{greatest}} {{advantage of}} square threads {{is that they}} have a much higher intrinsic efficiency than trapezoidal threads (Acme or metric trapezoidal). Due to the lack of a thread angle there is no radial pressure, or bursting pressure, on <b>the</b> <b>nut.</b> This also increases <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> life.|$|E

5000|$|Jam nuts {{can also}} be used in {{situations}} where a threaded rod must be rotated. Since threaded rods have no bolt heads, it is difficult or impossible to apply torque to a threaded rod. A pair of jam nuts is used to create a point where a wrench may be used. [...] Jam nuts can be unreliable under significant loads. If <b>the</b> inner <b>nut</b> is torqued more than <b>the</b> outer <b>nut,</b> <b>the</b> outer <b>nut</b> may yield. If <b>the</b> outer <b>nut</b> is torqued more than <b>the</b> inner <b>nut,</b> <b>the</b> inner <b>nut</b> may loosen up.|$|R

They were tired and cross and hot and they accused Billy Mink of having hidden <b>the</b> <b>nuts.</b> Billy Mink stoutly insisted {{that he had not}} hidden <b>the</b> <b>nuts,</b> that he had not found <b>the</b> <b>nuts,</b> and when they saw how hard he was hunting they {{believed}} him.|$|R

25|$|It is {{speculated that}} ceramic {{techniques}} were improved so that <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> {{of the oil}} palm could be further cooked.|$|E
25|$|More {{accurate}} {{methods for}} determining the preload rely on defining or measuring the screw extension from <b>the</b> <b>nut.</b> Alternatively, measurement of the angular rotation of <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> can {{serve as the basis}} for defining screw extension based on the fastener's thread pitch. Measuring the screw extension directly allows the clamping force to be very accurately calculated. This can be achieved using a dial test indicator, reading deflection at the fastener tail, using a strain gauge, or ultrasonic length measurement.|$|E
5000|$|Reference to the player's {{observation}} and abilities at this location:FinFin visits {{the forest to}} satisfy his hunger for [...] "Tsubu" [...] nuts. Here one can observe him shaking <b>the</b> <b>nuts</b> from <b>the</b> trees by flying through the treetops. Then he eats <b>the</b> <b>nuts</b> lying on <b>the</b> ground.|$|R
5000|$|The {{center of}} mass of the whole system (containing <b>the</b> mixed <b>nuts)</b> in an {{arbitrary}} state is not optimally low; it has the tendency to be higher due to there being more empty space around <b>the</b> larger Brazil <b>nuts</b> than around smaller <b>nuts.</b> When <b>the</b> <b>nuts</b> are shaken, <b>the</b> system has the tendency {{to move to a}} lower energy state, which means moving the {{center of mass}} down by moving <b>the</b> smaller <b>nuts</b> down and thereby <b>the</b> Brazil <b>nuts</b> up.|$|R

25|$|The {{fruit of}} hickory is pear shaped and {{enclosed}} {{in a thin}} husk developed from the floral involucre. The fruit ripens in September and October, and seeds are dispersed from September through December. Husks are green until maturity; they turn brown to brownish-black as they ripen. The husks become dry at maturity and split away from <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> into four valves along sutures. Husks of pignut hickory split only to the middle or slightly beyond and generally cling to <b>the</b> <b>nut,</b> which is unribbed, with a thick shell.|$|E

50|$|Lithocarpus edulis (Japanese stone oak) is {{a species}} of stone-oak native to Japan. It is an {{evergreen}} tree growing up to 15 metres tall. <b>The</b> <b>nuts</b> are edible for people but taste bitter. <b>The</b> <b>nuts</b> contain tannins, however soaking them in water removes them. It is cultivated as an ornamental plant.|$|R
50|$|The larva feed on Carya illinoensis. It is {{the most}} {{damaging}} insect pest of pecans in Texas. The larvae feed first on buds below the cluster, then attack <b>the</b> <b>nuts.</b> They enter <b>the</b> <b>nuts</b> by cutting a circular hole in the base. As they feed, they push frass out the hole where it accumulates. A single larva may destroy the entire cluster, before pupating in one of <b>the</b> last <b>nuts</b> fed upon.|$|R
25|$|Compared {{to square}} threads, {{disadvantages}} of the Acme thread form are lower efficiency due to higher friction and some radial load on <b>the</b> <b>nut</b> (angular offset from square).|$|E

50|$|Two {{different}} timing {{strategies are}} used for collecting <b>the</b> fallen <b>nuts.</b> <b>The</b> first is to harvest early, when about half of <b>the</b> <b>nuts</b> have fallen. With less material on the ground, the harvester can work faster with less chance of a breakdown. The second option is to wait for all <b>the</b> <b>nuts</b> to fall before harvesting. Although the first option is considered the better of the two, two or three passes do take more time to complete than one. Weather also must be a consideration. Rain inhibits harvest and should a farmer wait for all <b>the</b> <b>nuts</b> to fall after a rainy season, it becomes {{much more difficult to}} harvest. Pickup also varies with how many acres are being farmed as well as the number of sweepers, harvesters, nut carts, and forklifts available.|$|R
50|$|When an oil {{metering}} unit was installed on a cabin pressurisation blower, locking wire {{was used to}} ensure <b>the</b> five securing <b>nuts</b> did not rotate and become loose. In the wreckage of number 2 cabin blower accident investigators found none of <b>the</b> <b>nuts</b> and no locking wire. The investigators believed that when the blower was last overhauled the oil {{metering unit}} may have been re-attached without locking wire securing <b>the</b> <b>nuts.</b> <b>The</b> blower was overhauled and then installed on VH-RMI in April 1966.|$|R
