5000|$|This {{definition}} {{was expanded}} on by Slade J in McGovern v Attorney General, {{where he said}} that: [...] (1) <b>A</b> <b>trust</b> for research will ordinarily qualify as <b>a</b> charitable <b>trust</b> if, but only if (a) {{the subject matter of}} the proposed research is a useful object of study; and (b) if it is contemplated that the knowledge acquired as a result of the research will be disseminated to others; and (c) the trust is for the benefit of the public, or a sufficiently important section of the public. (2) In the absence of such a contrary context, however, the court will be readily inclined to construe <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> for research as importing subsequent dissemination of the results thereof. Furthermore, if <b>a</b> <b>trust</b> for research is <b>to</b> <b>constitute</b> <b>a</b> valid <b>trust</b> for the advancement of education, it is no necessary either (a) that the teacher/pupil relationship should be in contemplation, or (b) that the persons to benefit from the knowledge to be acquired should be persons who are already in the course of receiving an education in the conventional sense.|$|R
