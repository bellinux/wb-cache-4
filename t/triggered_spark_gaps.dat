50|$|The pseudospark switch, {{also known}} as a cold-cathode {{thyratron}} due to the similarities with regular thyratrons, is a gas-filled tube capable of high speed switching. Advantages of pseudospark switches include the ability to carry reverse currents (up to 100%), low pulse, high lifetime, and a high current rise of about 1012 A/sec. In addition, since the cathode is not heated prior to switching, the standby power is approximately one order of magnitude lower than in thyratrons. However, pseudospark switches have undesired plasma phenomena at low peak currents. Issues such as current quenching, chopping, and impedance fluctuations occur at currents less than 2-3 kA while at very high peak currents (20-30 kA) a transition to a metal vapor arc occurs which leads to erosion of the electrodes. Pseudospark switches are functionally similar to <b>triggered</b> <b>spark</b> <b>gaps.</b>|$|E

External injection of a (low energy) electron bunch into a laser wakefield requires acceleration gradients of the order GV/m. In principle DC acceleration can achieve GV/m acceleration gradients.

40|$|Though {{synthetic}} {{test methods}} {{are widely used}} for testing high-power circuit breakers (CBs), synthetic testing has not {{been reported in the}} literature as being extended to the testing of medium-voltage (MV) load break switches (LBS). This paper investigates the possibility of type testing of MV LBS using synthetic test procedures. The transient recovery voltage (TRV) required is calculated from both IEC and IEEE standards and it is shown that the IEC TRV specification results in a more severe TRV. It is found that testing with a basic Weil circuit requires two-part testing. In one test, a low-amplitude TRV with a fast rate of rise stresses the early region associated with thermal failure. In the other test, a higher-amplitude slowly rising TRV stresses the later dielectric region. However, the two-part test using the unmodified Weil circuit is shown to cause significant TRV overstressing. Insertion of a precharged capacitor and additional damping resistors into the Weil circuit at critical times using <b>triggered</b> <b>spark</b> <b>gaps</b> are found to be effective to reduce overstressing.

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{experimental}} investigation of the photoconductively switched gas-filled spark gap. When the laser intensity of a femtosecond laser is high enough (around 1018 Wm- 2), a plasma can be created that spans the complete distance between the electrodes. The gas-filled spark gap is then closed on a femtosecond timescale, similar to photoconductive switching of a semiconductor switch. Stochastic breakdown processes, such as avalanche and streamer formation that cause the breakdown in laser <b>triggered</b> <b>spark</b> <b>gaps,</b> are passed over, which results in faster risetime and less jitter. Measurements of the switched pulses {{as a function of}} laser energy were performed in a 1 mm gap at an applied voltage of 4. 5 kV.

Measurements of the output pulses with the gap filled with nitrogen at 1 atm showed results very similar to measurements in air in the same gap. In the switching regime, the amplitude of the switched pulse did not depend strongly on the laser energy. Measurements at lower applied voltages but with the same gap distance showed {{that it was possible to}} switch voltages as low as 10 % of the self-breakdown voltage. At low applied voltages, a significant difference between the applied voltage and the output voltage is measured.

The effects of the laser beam intensity, the gap length used and the position of the plasma in the gap were found to play important roles in the breakdown process of an orthogonally triggered gap.

40|$|Laser wakefield {{acceleration}} promises {{the production}} of high energy electrons from table-top accelerators. External injection of (low energy) electrons into a laser wakefield puts extreme demands on the shortness and timing, i. e. {{a fraction of a}} plasma period, typically less than 100 fs. In order to meet these requirements, we have revisited the concept of pulsed DC acceleration. Simulations have shown that this concept can be successful if high voltage pulses (of the order MV) can be switched with picosecond precision. As a fust step towards this goal, a IO kV laser triggered pressurized spark gap was designed and built. One of the limitations on risetime and jitter in high voltage laser <b>triggered</b> <b>spark</b> <b>gaps</b> is the initial breakdown process. Since this is a stochastic process it will cause jitter, and the growth rate of the plasma will determine the fastest possible risetime of the pulse. A way to overcome this limitation is to create a line focus between the electrodes, using a high power femtosecond laser. At laser intensities above approximately 102 ̆ 2 W/m 2 near- threshold or tunneling ionization causes near-instantaneous ionization of. a complete plasma channel between the electrodes, much like a photoconductive semi-conductor switch. Because of the instantaneous ionization and the high degree of ionization in the plasma channel, jitter and risetime are reduced considerably.
