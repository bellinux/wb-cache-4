50|$|Because {{electrochemical}} {{activity is}} one of the two triggers that cause polymerization of the <b>threadlocker</b> fluid, care must be taken to avoid contaminating the entire container of <b>threadlocker</b> with <b>threadlocker</b> that has had contact with metal, otherwise the material in the container may polymerize.|$|E
50|$|Thread-locking fluid or <b>threadlocker</b> is a thin, single-component adhesive, {{applied to}} the threads of {{fasteners}} such as screws and bolts to prevent loosening, leakage, and corrosion.|$|E
50|$|Thread-locking fluid is {{typically}} sold in small containers, in amounts from 5 millilitres (about one teaspoon) to 250 mL. <b>Threadlocker</b> is also sold in sticks and in tape form, similar to Teflon tape.|$|E
5000|$|Thread-locking fluid may {{be applied}} {{before or after}} assembly, {{depending}} on the type. <b>Threadlockers</b> are available in [...] "permanent" [...] and [...] "removable" [...] formulas, with heavy-duty permanent <b>threadlockers</b> rated to withstand as much as [...] in shear. Some <b>threadlockers</b> are removable with the application of heat. Many brands use color-coded labeling to indicate each type's strength and whether it is permanent or removable.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the static {{strength}} of mechanically tightened joints augmented with anaerobic adhesives. Tests were performed {{on a variety of}} specimens distinguished by fairly homogeneous (annular butt joint) or realistically inhomogeneous (threaded, cylindrical and double lap joints) working conditions over the bondline. For each geometry, the strength of the dry (unbonded) joint was compared with the strength of the joint bonded with an assortment of anaerobics. The results indicate that the strength of all joints (bonded and unbonded) increases with the contact force. When strong adhesives (retainers) are used, the overall strength approximately equals the sum of friction and adhesive strengths, taken separately. When weak adhesives (<b>threadlockers)</b> are adopted, the superimposition of effects grossly overestimates the measured strength. A micromechanical model is proposed that explains the observed macroscopic behaviour...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} the dependency of loosening parameters on secondary locking features of threaded inserts subjected to dynamic shear loads. Secondary locking is used to assist and/or provide redundancy to the primary locking feature (threads) in preventing preload loss in almost any mechanical applications. Two different secondary locking features are studied: the Locking Heli-Coil insert and the Loctite <b>Threadlocker</b> (R) applied before assembly to a Standard Heli-Coil insert. Five parameters are studied in this thesis: percentage loss of initial preload, initial rate of preload loss, secondary rate of preload loss, steady-state value, and the final preload value. Statistical analysis was used to quantify the dependencies between locking levels. Results show that the loss of initial preload is dependent on secondary locking features, the initial and secondary rate of preload loss are dependent on secondary locking features, the steady-state value and the final preload value are dependent on secondary locking features. Also, due to secondary locking features, 83...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the fatigue {{behaviour}} of threaded connections bonded with anaerobic <b>threadlockers.</b> Fatigue tests are described involving rolled ISO M 10 bolts of property class 10. 9 loaded under constant amplitude at the load levels 11 +/- 10 kN and 8. 8 +/- 8 kN. The number of cycles to failure consequent to treatment with anaerobics is significantly longer than without treatment, the ratio between the corresponding lives being about 3. 5 at the higher load (11 +/- 10 kN) and about 2 at the lower load (8. 8 +/- 8 kN). The reduced effect with the lower load discloses a common endurance limit. The behaviour is attributed to elimination of fretting damage between the contacting threads of the bonded connections. This interpretation suggests an important role of the mean test load and fosters further investigation...|$|R

These adhesives have shown a good performance with threaded components with Cr[VI] coatings. Hexavalent chromium is a carcinogenic material so its use is limited or prohibited by environmental regulations in several countries, such as the United States and the European Union. In order to avoid this problem, non-chromated zinc coatings are used. However, anaerobic adhesives are not very effective with these types of coatings. Silane coupling agents could be an alternative to improve the performance of these coatings with anaerobic adhesives. The aim of this work {{was to investigate the}} effect of a silane treatment on Zn-electrocoated steel. H 1 -NMR (proton nuclear magnetic resonance) studies of ?-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (MPS) hydrolysis provide the optimal conditions for silane application onto substrates. Analysis of silane layers over zinc coatings was performed by means of Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. In addition, single lap shear tests were used to compare the strength of anaerobic adhesive joints on Zn-coated specimens with different surface treatments. NMR shows that maximum hydrolysis of MPS takes place at 150 min. Adhesive joints prepared using MPS coatings after this hydrolysis time give maximum shear strength. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
