2500|$|Beowulf {{and his men}} {{spend the}} night in Heorot. Beowulf refuses to use any weapon because he holds himself to be the equal of Grendel. When Grendel enters the hall, Beowulf, who has been feigning sleep, leaps up <b>to</b> <b>clench</b> Grendel's hand. Grendel and Beowulf battle each other violently. Beowulf's {{retainers}} draw their swords and rush to his aid, but their blades cannot pierce Grendel's skin. Finally, Beowulf tears Grendel's arm from his body at the shoulder and Grendel runs to his home in the marshes where he dies. Beowulf displays [...] "the whole of Grendel's shoulder and arm, his awesome grasp" [...] for all to see at Heorot. This display would fuel Grendel's mother's anger in revenge.|$|E

[...] "Tell him he will die before next morning," [...] said the surgeon. The surgeons worked futilely to close his stomach wound, and Chief American Horse refused morphine preferring <b>to</b> <b>clench</b> a stick between his teeth to hide any sign of pain or emotions and thus he bravely and stolidly died. Chief American Horse lingered until 6:00a.m. and confirmed that the tribes were scattering and were becoming discouraged by war. [...] "He appeared satisfied that {{the lives of his}} squaws and children were spared." [...] Dr. McGillicuddy, who attended the dying chief, said that he was cheerful to the last and manifested the utmost affection for his wives and children.

50|$|Things {{such as an}} accent, height, weight, scars, {{and even}} {{something}} as small as body posture can all contribute to an audience falling victim to pseudo-listening. Being self-conscious {{about some of these}} personal flaws as a speaker may inhibit the listeners experience. This lack of self-confidence could lead to other distractions made by the speaker. While these physical flaws may lead to disinterest in the reader it could also contribute to nervous actions that may also distract the reader. A few examples of these nervous actions may include but are not limited <b>to</b> <b>clenching</b> your hands, adjusting your hair or clothing, and pacing back and forth while speaking. These actions may lead to a disinterest {{in the context of a}} speech and an elevated interest in the person speaking or the environment surrounding them.|$|R

60|$|Rage, anger, and indignation are {{exhibited}} in {{nearly the same}} manner throughout the world; and the following descriptions may be worth giving as evidence of this, and as illustrations {{of some of the}} foregoing remarks. There is, however, an exception with respect <b>to</b> <b>clenching</b> the fists, which seems confined chiefly to the men who fight with their fists. With the Australians only one of my informants has seen the fists clenched. All agree about the body being held erect; and all, with two exceptions, state that the brows are heavily contracted. Some of them allude to the firmly-compressed mouth, the distended nostrils, and flashing eyes. According to the Rev. Mr. Taplin, rage, with the Australians, is expressed by the lips being protruded, the eyes being widely open; {{and in the case of}} the women by their dancing about and casting dust into the air. Another observer speaks of the native men, when enraged, throwing their arms wildly about.|$|R
