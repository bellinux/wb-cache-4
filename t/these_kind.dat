Archie Thompson, who scored a record-setting 13 goals, was delighted with his record, but he also agreed with Farina's comments. FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper agreed with both comments and suggested {{a change in the}} qualification format, with the smaller teams entering a preliminary round. However, Oceania Football Confederation chairman Basil Scarsella, opposed both comments and claimed that the smaller teams have the right to face Australia and New Zealand, similar to Australia having the rights to face stronger opponents such as Brazil and France.|$|E

25|$|An {{important}} {{finding in}} amnesic patients with MTL damage is the impairment of memory in all sensory modalities – sound, touch, smell, taste, and sight. This {{reflects the fact}} that the MTL is a processor for all of the sensory modalities, and helps store <b>these</b> <b>kind</b> of thoughts into memory. In addition, subjects can often remember how to perform relatively simple tasks immediately (on the order of 10 seconds), but when the task becomes more difficult, even on the same time scale, subjects tend to forget. This demonstrates the difficulty of separating procedural memory tasks from declarative memory; some elements of declarative memory may be used in learning procedural tasks.|$|E
25|$|John G. Harries {{considered}} {{a common ground}} in the ideas that underlie developments in 20th-century art such as Serial art, Systems Art, Constructivism and Kinetic art. <b>These</b> <b>kind</b> of arts often do not stem directly from observations of things visible in the external natural environment, but from the observation of depicted shapes and {{of the relationship between}} them. Systems art, according to Harries, represents a deliberate attempt by artists to develop a more flexible frame of reference. A style in which its frame of reference is taken as a model to be emulated rather than as a cognitive systems, that only leads to the institutionalization of the imposed model. But to transfer the meaning of a picture to its location within a systemic structure does not remove the need to define the constitutive elements of the system: if they are not defined, one will not know how to build the system.|$|E

25|$|Capital {{intensive}} companies, {{particularly high}} tech companies, always {{need to raise}} high volumes of capital in their early stages. For this reason, the public market provided by the stock exchanges {{has been one of}} the most important funding sources for many capital intensive startups. After the 1990s and early-2000s hi-tech listed companies' boom and bust in the world's major stock exchanges, it has been much more demanding for the high-tech entrepreneur to take his/her company public, unless either the company already has products in the market and is generating sales and earnings, or the company has completed advanced promising clinical trials, earned potentially profitable patents or conducted market research which demonstrated very positive outcomes. This is quite different from the situation of the 1990s to early-2000s period, when a number of companies (particularly Internet boom and biotechnology companies) went public in the most prominent stock exchanges around the world, in the total absence of sales, earnings and any well-documented promising outcome. Anyway, every year a number of companies, including unknown highly speculative and financially unpredictable hi-tech startups, are listed for the first time in all the major stock exchanges – there are even specialized entry markets for <b>these</b> <b>kind</b> of companies or stock indexes tracking their performance (examples include the Alternext, CAC Small, SDAX, TecDAX, or most of the third market good companies).|$|E
25|$|Although he {{was legally}} {{accepted}} as a legitimate child, his parents did not accept him. The Truffauts had another child who died shortly after birth. This experience saddened them greatly {{and as a result}} they despised François because of the memory of regret that he represented (Knopf 4). He was an outcast from his earliest years, dismissed as an unwanted child. François was sent to live with his grandparents. It wasn't until François's grandmother's death before his parents took him in, much to the dismay of his own mother. The experiences with his mother were harsh. He recalled being treated badly by her but he found comfort in his father's laughter and overall spirit. The relationship with Roland was more comforting than the one with his own mother. François had a very depressing childhood after moving in with his parents. They would leave him alone whenever they would go on vacations. He even recalled memories of being alone during Christmas. Being left alone forced François into a sense of independence, he would often do various tasks around the house in order to improve it such as painting or changing the electric outlets. Sadly, <b>these</b> <b>kind</b> gestures often resulted in a catastrophic event causing him to get scolded by his mother. His father would mostly laugh them off.|$|E

500|$|In Sherrybaby, Gyllenhaal {{played a}} young drug-addicted thief {{trying to put}} her life in order after prison so she can {{reconcile}} with her daughter. During promotion of the film, she noted of her portrayal of the character: [...] "I think she's in such dire straights [...] that all she has are <b>these</b> <b>kind</b> of naive, fierce hope. And while I was playing the part I was looking for pleasure and hope in everything, even in these really bleak things. And {{so it was really}} mostly after I finished the movie that I felt pain." [...] Her performance in the film was well received: David Germain of the Associated Press wrote, [...] "Gyllenhaal humanizes her so deeply and richly... that Sherry elicits sympathy even in her darkest and weakest moments", and Dennis Harvey of Variety called her performance [...] "naturalistic". For her work, Gyllenhaal earned her second Golden Globe Best Actress nomination and won the Best Actress category award at the 2006 Stockholm International Film Festival.|$|E
500|$|By 2009, {{there had}} been four {{versions}} of the album released: a rare London Records promotional disc, a bootleg with cover art by Arik Roper, the Rise Above/Music Cartel Records album, and a release by Tee Pee Records. The Rise Above/Music Cartel release was an unauthorized edited version, released in 1999 under the title Jerusalem. Jerusalem runs at 52 minutes and is a single composition split into six identically named tracks. The version of the album titled Dopesmoker was released on April 22, 2003, by Tee Pee Records on compact disc and vinyl with a 63-minute running time. Cisneros spoke most positively about the 2003 Dopesmoker release, saying [...] "I don't think the Dopesmoker thing is the exact version that we submitted, but that's the closest one that's {{come out of the}} four. If I had to pick a favorite, that would be it." [...] Parts of the song were used in the film Broken Flowers by Jim Jarmusch.

500|$|With the {{intention}} of playing the 2015 season in the forward line alongside Jesse Hogan and Chris Dawes, a groin injury hampered Watts' pre-season training for three months heading into the season. He had a strong start to the season recording seventeen disposals, seven marks and three goals in the club's twenty-six point win against Gold Coast at the MCG in round one and was named in Melbourne's best players by AFL Media. After a buoyant start to the season, he quickly found himself facing negativity from the media after the round three loss to Adelaide at the Adelaide Oval where he dropped two marks in quick succession, with one leading to an Adelaide goal. Multiple media figures called {{for him to be}} dropped with David Schwarz stating he [...] "might have to sit out a week" [...] and Dermott Brereton professing [...] "you have to make a stand as to what your team stands for, and that means you can't bring him back in until you are convinced he will not do that again"; Jason Dunstall supplemented these statements by noting [...] "he can't relapse into <b>these</b> <b>kind</b> of performances", adding [...] "I don't like using the word, but he looked a little soft at times".|$|E

Daniel Ricciardo called for the FIA to clear up the {{regulations}} of the virtual safety car, following him being overtaken easily at the first restart by Nico Rosberg, saying that he had not gotten a warning {{about the end of the}} period. Kimi Räikkönen was equally displeased, complaining about the rules concerning driving standards. Following his on-track battle with Max Verstappen, he demanded clarification on whether Verstappen's aggressive driving style was legal, saying: [...] "I just wanted to ask if it's OK when you are next to another car, at some point on the exit of the corner are you allowed to always push the other car up on the kerbs [...] Apparently it's fine. As long as everybody has the same rules that's OK." [...] Concerning the collision between Nico Hülkenberg and Ricciardo, Force India revealed that damage to Hülkenberg's front wing had caused him to lose downforce and slide into the Red Bull. Following the turn one collision between their two drivers, Sauber's team principal Monisha Kaltenborn announced that she intended to [...] "have a word" [...] with her drivers, saying: [...] "The bottom line of this is that <b>these</b> <b>kind</b> of things simply must not happen. It is OK if you have decent and healthy competition which they do – both drivers are respectful to each other. [...] I'm upset. These mistakes shouldn't happen. We are much better than this." ...|$|E
500|$|Margaret Beale Spencer and Vinay Harpalani (2008) {{argue that}} {{usage of the}} term [...] "acting white" [...] by black {{teenagers}} does not reflect their cultural values; rather, it is a manifestation of their racial identity development, experienced in conjunction with normal adolescent hassles and peer pressure. [...] Spencer and Harpalani employ William E. Cross's (1991) Nigrescence framework and contend that black teenagers' use of [...] "acting white" [...] in relation to academic achievement is similar to white teenagers' {{use of the term}} [...] "nerd": {{the only difference is that}} black teenagers express it in racialized terms, as in addition to normal teenage peer pressure, they are grappling with racial identity and what it means to be [...] "black". [...] Expressions such as [...] "acting white" [...] may or may not reflect black teenagers' cultural values, and their usage is sometimes counterintuitive: for example, Ogbu (2003) himself documented one instance where a black teenage girl with natural hair was accused of [...] "acting white" [...] by her black peers because [...] "like white people, she did not have to process her hair." [...] <b>These</b> <b>kind</b> of examples show that accusations of [...] "acting white" [...] are not fundamentally about black cultural attributes (although such accusations may reflect these attributes). [...] Rather, [...] "acting white" [...] is just a manifestation of racial identity development for black children and teenagers, who are learning and defining for themselves what it means to be [...] "black"—in conjunction with normal adolescent peer pressure and hassles. That is also why such accusations are less common among black adults, who have come to greater resolution regarding racial identity issues.|$|E
