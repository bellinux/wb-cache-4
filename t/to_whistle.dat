5|$|If handled {{correctly}} {{early in}} life, guinea pigs become amenable to {{being picked up}} and carried, and seldom bite or scratch. They are timid explorers and often hesitate to attempt an escape from their cage even when an opportunity presents itself. Still, they show considerable curiosity when allowed to walk freely, especially in familiar and safe terrain. Guinea pigs that become familiar with their owner will whistle on the owner's approach; they will also learn <b>to</b> <b>whistle</b> {{in response to the}} rustling of plastic bags or the opening of refrigerator doors, where their food is most commonly stored. In Switzerland, owning a single guinea pig is considered harmful to its well-being and forbidden by law.|$|E
5|$|If {{conditions}} are normal {{and a green}} light is shown, the athlete's coach – who is situated in a coaches' section lower down the inrun with a flag in hand – gives them the final signal to go; coaches may sometimes have <b>to</b> <b>whistle</b> or give a shouted confirmation in low-visibility conditions. Once given this signal, the athlete must commit to their jump within ten seconds or else risk disqualification: {{they are not allowed}} to exit the gate from whence they came. To begin descending the inrun, they drop down from the gate to a crouching position. Speed is rapidly picked up within seconds via built-in tracks, made from porcelain or ceramic, into which the skis are slotted. The athlete's streamlined crouch minimises air resistance along the inrun, and a further effort is made to reduce friction by not allowing the skis (which have wax applied to them) to bump too much against the sides of the tracks. Speed is measured from the table using a speed gun.|$|E

25|$|Whistles come in {{all shapes}} and sizes, but their {{operation}} can be unified through the concepts of dynamic and geometric similarity. Nature knows nothing of the specific measurement systems we use; it cares only about ratios between the various forces, time scales, and the several dimensions. To compare them we need {{to take into account the}} established ratios that are relevant <b>to</b> <b>whistle</b> operation.|$|E
25|$|The police {{detained}} 37 people, making seven arrests. They {{also found}} six ounces {{of marijuana and}} {{a small amount of}} cocaine. The seven were beaten by the police and at the police station forced <b>to</b> <b>whistle</b> the theme to the Andy Griffith Show. Those who refused to comply were beaten again. Nobody was charged with a crime. The city paid four million dollars to settle the matter.|$|E
25|$|In Argentina, writer Alejandro Dolina, in {{his book}} Crónicas del Ángel Gris ("Chronicles of the Gray Angel"), tells the legend of a massive jacarandá tree planted in Plaza Flores (Flores Square) in Buenos Aires, which was able <b>to</b> <b>whistle</b> tango songs on demand. María Elena Walsh {{dedicated}} her Canción del Jacarandá song to the tree. Also Miguel Brascó's folk song Santafesino de veras mentions the aroma of jacarandá as {{a defining feature of}} the littoral Santa Fe Province (along with the willows growing by the rivers).|$|E

25|$|Esperanto {{has some}} slang {{in the sense}} of in-group talk as well. Some of this is borrowed; for example, fajfi priio (<b>to</b> <b>whistle</b> about something) means not to care about it, as in German. Other {{expressions}} deriving from Esperanto history or dealing with specifically Esperantist concerns have arisen over the years. A volapukaĵo, for example, is something needlessly incomprehensible, derived from the name of the more complex and less immediately readable constructed language Volapük, which preceded Esperanto by a few years and was replaced by it.|$|E
25|$|The Khan also {{employed}} {{tactics that}} made his numbers seem greater than they actually were. During night operations he ordered each soldier to light three torches at dusk to give the illusion of an overwhelming army and deceive and intimidate enemy scouts. He also sometimes had objects tied to the tails of his horses, so that riding on open and dry fields raised {{a cloud of dust}} that gave the enemy the impression of great numbers. His soldiers used arrows specially notched <b>to</b> <b>whistle</b> as they flew through the air, creating a terrifying noise.|$|E
25|$|While the USA had FIFA sanction, {{the foreign}} teams which were rebranded as American {{for the summer}} 1967 season viewed the league {{as little more than}} a {{training}} exercise for their off-season, and most did not field their best players. The NPSL had a two-year national television contract in the U.S. with the CBS television network...referees were instructed <b>to</b> <b>whistle</b> fouls and delay play to allow CBS to insert commercials. The ratings for matches were unacceptable even by weekend daytime standards and the arrangement with CBS was soon terminated. Bill MacPhail, head of CBS Sports, attributed NPSL's lack of TV appeal to empty stadiums with few fans, and to undistinguished foreign players who were unfamiliar to American soccer fans.|$|E
50|$|Local {{names like}} sili and silhahi in India {{are based on}} their wheezy two-note calls. They become very tame in captivity, walking about and {{responding}} <b>to</b> <b>whistles.</b> Individuals in captivity in the USA have lived for up to 9 years.|$|R

25|$|Upon {{entering}} the forest, Maruyama has José whistle {{since he is}} apparently {{the only one who}} can, while Paifu practices his whistling since José will eventually get exhausted. José, instead of getting fatigued from whistling, suddenly falls ill to the Monster Flu as well. Their fear of the monster finding them becomes a reality and they are attacked by the forest monster Baroaba. Maruyama holds his own against the behemoth and tells Paifu to start learning how <b>to</b> <b>whistle</b> immediately before they are killed. Although several attempts had been unsuccessful, Paifu finally prospered in whistling and Baroaba is literally downsized by the sound, proving the weakness true, and is pounded by Maruyama. Before Maruyama finishes him off, he discovers that Baroaba only attacks to protect the forest's rare wildlife; Baroaba apologizes for the misunderstanding and decides to help them get to their destination, the witch's house.|$|E
500|$|Tanner {{became known}} as [...] "Whistler’s Mother’s Boy", [...] "The Whistling Troubador," [...] and [...] "the nation’s best-known whistler". Tanner was noted for {{the ease with which}} he hit high notes and {{performed}} trills. [...] He had the ability <b>to</b> <b>whistle</b> while triple-tonguing, and like Bing Crosby, he was able <b>to</b> <b>whistle</b> from his throat due to the muscles in his larynx. [...] His range was from low G to high B. [...] Professional whistler Joel Brandon has named Tanner as a [...] "top pick". Ted Weems considered Tanner's whistling so important to his band, he insured the musician's throat with Lloyd's of London for $10,000 in 1939. The policy provided payment for any medical expenses related to Tanner's possible inability <b>to</b> <b>whistle</b> and included payment to the holder if Tanner was unable to perform.|$|E

500|$|According to some versions, {{including}} {{comments from}} some of the kids standing outside the store, Till may have wolf-whistled at Bryant. Following his disappearance, a newspaper account stated that Till sometimes whistled to alleviate his stuttering. His speech was sometimes unclear; his mother said he had particular difficulty with pronouncing [...] "b" [...] sounds, and he may have whistled to overcome problems asking for bubble gum. She said that, to help with his articulation, she taught Till how <b>to</b> <b>whistle</b> softly to himself before pronouncing his words.|$|E
500|$|Tanner was {{originally}} hired by Weems as a vocalist; the bandleader discovered Tanner's whistling ability while {{the band was}} traveling to an engagement. Like Bing Crosby, he was able <b>to</b> <b>whistle</b> from his throat due to {{the muscles in his}} larynx. He subsequently became a featured performer as a whistler, earning [...] the nicknames [...] "Whistler’s Mother’s Boy", [...] "The Whistling Troubador," [...] and [...] "the nation’s best-known whistler". He began appearing in films as part of the Ted Weems Orchestra in 1936; his first film role was in The Hatfields and McCoys, and he later appeared in the movie Swing, Sister, Swing (1938) and the musical film short, Swing Frolic (1942). Weems considered Tanner's whistling important enough to his orchestra that in 1939 he insured Tanner's throat for $10,000. Besides musical whistling, he also imitated birds for Disney.|$|E
500|$|Males {{defend their}} group's territory, [...] large; female members may also show some {{aggression}} and drive away intruders. A {{study showed that}} the number of females that visit the male's territory depends on the appearance (particularly the symmetry) of the male's horns. Males mark vegetation and soil in their territories by preorbital gland secretions and excrement; the intensity of marking increases with the number of male neighbours. Dominant males tend to have greater access to females in and around the territory than other males. An important feature of the social behaviour of oribi is the [...] "dung ceremony", in which all animals form temporary dung middens. Oribi at least three months old have been observed giving out one to three alarm whistles on sensing danger. These whistles are more common in adults than in juveniles, and males appear <b>to</b> <b>whistle</b> more. Common predators include carnivorans such as jackals.|$|E

500|$|The first Defence of the Realm Act (DORA) {{was passed}} on [...] 1914, {{during the early}} weeks of the war, though {{in the next few}} months its {{provisions}} were extended. It gave the government wide-ranging powers, such as the ability to requisition buildings or land needed for the war effort. Some of the things the British public were prohibited from doing included loitering under railway bridges, feeding wild animals and discussing naval and military matters. British Summer Time was also introduced. Alcoholic beverages were now to be watered down, pub closing times were brought forward from [...] to , and, from , Londoners were no longer able <b>to</b> <b>whistle</b> for a cab between [...] and [...] It has been criticised for both its strength and its use of the death penalty as a deterrent– although the act itself did not refer to the death penalty, it made provision for civilians breaking these rules to be tried in army courts martial, where the maximum penalty was death.|$|E
500|$|Rutgers {{students}} affectionately {{call the}} statue [...] "Willie the Silent" [...] and [...] "Still Bill." [...] According to student tradition, the statue is expected <b>to</b> <b>whistle</b> should a virgin happen to walk by. [...] However, Rutgers American studies professor and folklorist Angus Kress Gillespie remarked [...] "But {{over the last}} 200 years, he hasn't yet whistled." [...] Nevertheless, the statue has continued {{to be included in}} student life as the Voorhees Mall was used as the site of student and community events, graduation ceremonies (until 2007), pep rallies for the football team and other athletic teams, Dutch-American festivals, as well as protests including anti-war protests and strike rallies in the 1970s. On the afternoon of October 11, 1976, United States Senator Ted Kennedy of Massachusetts held a campaign rally at Rutgers during the presidential election of 1976. Kennedy addressed a crowd of approximately 1,000 students the Voorhees Mall in front of the statue of William the Silent. Before Kennedy began his speech he [...] "had to quell boos and heckling by some students holding anti-Kennedy signs." ...|$|E
500|$|Grainger was {{a musical}} democrat; he {{believed}} that in a performance each player's role should be of equal importance. His elastic scoring technique was developed to enable groups of all sizes and combinations of instruments to give effective performances of his music. Experimentation is evident in Grainger's earliest works; irregular rhythms based on rapid changes of time signature were employed in Love Verses from [...] "The Song of Solomon" [...] (1899), and Train Music (1901), long before [...] Stravinsky adopted this practice. In search of specific sounds Grainger employed unconventional instruments and techniques: solovoxes, theremins, marimbas, musical glasses, harmoniums, banjos, and ukuleles. [...] In one early [...] concert of [...] folk music, Quilter and [...] Scott were conscripted as performers, <b>to</b> <b>whistle</b> various parts. [...] In [...] "Random Round" [...] (1912–14), inspired by the communal music-making [...] he had heard in the Pacific Islands on his second Australasian tour, Grainger introduced an element of chance into performances; [...] individual vocalists and instrumentalists could make random choices from a menu of variations. [...] This experiment in [...] "aleatory" [...] composition presaged by many decades the use of similar procedures by avant-garde composers such as Berio and Stockhausen.|$|E
