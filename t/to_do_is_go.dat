500|$|As a manager, he was {{a strict}} disciplinarian, {{possibly}} {{a result of his}} military background. [...] Carroll [...] "Dink" [...] Mothell maintained that [...] "Rogan wanted to run the ball club like they did it in the army. He liked to give orders too much, even before he was managing. He used to bawl players out for different things. I could take it, but we had ball players, when he'd get on them, they'd go into a shell, resented it, and didn't give him their best." [...] Another Monarchs pitcher, Chet Brewer, said that [...] "Rogan wasn't the best manager because he was such a great ball player himself. [...] He couldn't teach pitchers much, because he'd say, 'All you have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>go</b> out and throw the man what I threw'." [...] According to historian Phil Dixon, [...] "In Rogan's first few years as manager he was reluctant to pinch-hit for many of the veterans on his roster because they were his friends." [...] He didn't trust younger players, often inserting himself to pitch or pinch-hit for them. He sometimes treated rookies harshly. Eventually Rogan [...] "discarded his distant approach" [...] and became increasingly known for teaching and developing less experienced players.|$|E
500|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} immediately after Johnston finished the Britain's Got Talent live tour over a six-week period in London. The track listing, which contained both religious and popular songs, {{was chosen by}} Cowell; Johnston said [...] "I hadn't sung many of the tracks before. But I knew them all and, anyway, I like a challenge." [...] Johnston described recording the album as [...] "great", and said [...] "All I’ve ever wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>go</b> into a studio and record an album and it was everything I’ve ever dreamed of." [...] Johnson recorded [...] "Walking in the Air" [...] as a duet with fellow Britain's Got Talent contestant Faryl Smith, and the song was tipped as a potential Christmas number-one. The recording was finished by September 2008, after which Johnston began to make appearances to publicise the release, including appearances on GMTV, Channel 5 News, BBC Breakfast, This Morning and Radio 2's Friday Night Is Music Night. In preparation for the album's promotion, Johnston received confidence tutoring. He said that [...] "I've got no confidence and sometimes people get on at me for being moody so I've had some help with that." [...] Johnston also received vocal training from Yvie Burnett, who was, at the time, coaching Leona Lewis and Leon Jackson, and with whom Smith trained during Britain's Got Talent. The album was produced by Nigel Wright.|$|E
500|$|The brawl, {{along with}} an {{incident}} between the Vancouver Canucks' Todd Bertuzzi and Steve Moore of the Colorado Avalanche, (in which Bertuzzi hit Moore from behind, breaking his neck, in retaliation for a hit by Moore on one of Bertuzzi's team-mates a month earlier), brought the issue of violence in ice hockey into focus. Particular attention was given to retaliation; when Brashear was interviewed {{on the subject of}} the Bertuzzi incident, he defended such on-ice revenge, and suggested that Bertuzzi should not receive a suspension, because [...] "all they have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>go</b> after him when he comes back." [...] That mindset echoed the comments made by Ken Hitchcock and Mark Recchi about Martin Havlat, and Sam Donnellon of the Philadelphia Daily News suggested that it was prevailing opinion amongst all the players in the League. He suggested that rather than wanting stricter penalties to clamp down on dangerous play, (which he advocated), the players believed that removing the penalty for instigating a fight, and allowing players to therefore get their retribution by that means, would have the same effect. Mike Heika of The Dallas Morning News also believed that the league should be stricter in handing out fines and suspensions, suggesting that Hitchcock should possibly have been penalised for his revenge comments, and that if Havlat had received a lengthier ban for his actions, the brawl between the Flyers and Senators may not have happened.|$|E
2500|$|When {{asked to}} look back on the album, the band {{themselves}} have described Gold Against the Soul as their least favourite album and the period surrounding the album as being the most unfocused of their career.

2500|$|... "Hyperion Heights" [...] was {{directed}} by Ralph Hemecker and written by Edward Kitsis and Adam Horowitz. In January 2017, while season 6 was still in production, ABC president Channing Dungey spoke of a possible [...] "reset" [...] of the show's narrative. After much speculation, executive producers Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis later confirmed that certain characters would have their storylines wrapped up and that the back-end of the sixth season had been written with the season 7 narrative change in mind. Despite the major changes from seasons past, the showrunners {{have said that they}} do not view season 7 as a complete reboot of the show: [...] "We're more thinking about it as a hybrid of a lot of things. We're paying homage to the original premise, but there are certain characters who are returning and some who are not. It's a combination of a lot of things, but what we're trying <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>go</b> in a new direction but stay true to the spirit of what the show has always been." [...] ABC renewed the series for a seventh season on May 11, 2017. The premiere date was revealed in July, along with announcement of the new timeslot, Fridays. The table read for this installment began in July 7, 2017.|$|E
2500|$|The navy's assault {{involved}} 400 {{sailors and}} marines in 25 boats. The operation was a fiasco {{from beginning to}} end. [...] Poor reconnaissance, planning, and communication all characterized the operation. Commander Thomas H. Stevens, Jr., commanding the monitor Patapsco, was placed {{in charge of the}} assault. When Commander Stevens protested that he [...] "knew nothing of [...] organization [...] " [...] and [...] "made some remonstrances on this grounds and others." [...] Dahlgren replied, [...] "There is nothing but a corporal's guard [...] in the fort, and all we have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>go</b> and take possession." [...] This underestimation of the Confederate forces on Dahlgren's part may explain why he was hostile to a joint operation wishing to reserve the credit for the victory to the navy. Less than half of the boats landed. [...] Most of the boats that did land landed on the right flank or right gorge angle, rather than on the gorge where there was a passable breach. The Union sailors and marines who did land could not scale the wall. [...] The Confederates fired upon the landing party and as well as throwing hand grenades and loose bricks. The men in the boats that had not landed fired muskets and revolvers blindly at the fort, endangering the landing party more than the garrison. The landing party took shelter in shell holes in the wall of the fort. In response to a signal rocket fired by the garrison, Fort Johnson and the Confederate warship CSS Chicora opened fire upon the boats and landing party. The boats that could withdraw withdrew and the landing party surrendered. The Union casualties were 8 killed, 19 wounded, and 105 captured (including 15 of the wounded). The Confederates did not suffer any casualties in the assault.|$|E

5000|$|Fitzgerald {{was still}} {{performing}} at Granz's JATP concerts by 1955. She left Decca and Granz, now her manager, created Verve Records around her.
