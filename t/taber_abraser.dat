40|$|Aluminum oxide was plasma sprayed on {{the surface}} of Al- 4 % Cu alloy substrate. The {{morphology}} of the coating was studied thoroughly using optical and scanning electron microscopy. The abrasive wear behaviour of the alumina coating was examined using the disk on disk method (<b>Taber</b> <b>abraser).</b> The wear rate of the coating was higher {{at the beginning of the}} wear tests and depended on the applied load. A linear relationship was observed between the wear rate and the initial surface roughness of the coating. © 1993...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 74 - 76) Bed sheets can {{be purchased}} {{in a variety of}} fiber contents, types of fabrics, and colors. The objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the hypotheses that a) abrasion on the <b>Taber</b> <b>Abraser</b> and the Accelerotor can be used in predicting wear caused by a specified number of home launderings, b) durability of white and colored sheets is similar when measured by breaking strength and tearing strength tests following specified periods of laundering, and c) labeling information on bed sheets provides an adequate and accurate picture of selected performance characteristics. A survey was made and a representative sample of sheets was selected for testing. The sample consisted of white and gold colored cotton and cotton blend sheets in muslin and percale. Physical characteristics were checked. Each sheet was divided and portions subjected to laundry treatment, abrasion on the <b>Taber</b> <b>Abraser,</b> or abrasion in the Accelerator. Tests were made to determine dimensional stability, breaking strength, and tearing strength following selected levels of treatment. Statistical analysis of data showed no correlation between breaking strengths or tearing strengths of laboratory abraded specimens and laundered sheeting. Comparisons showed no significant difference between the strength characteristics of white and colored sheeting. Labeling information was interpreted as frequently inaccurate and inadequate...|$|E
40|$|Tungsten carbide {{reinforced}} coatings play {{an important}} role in the field of surface engineering to protect stressed surfaces against wear. For thermally sprayed coatings, it is already shown that the tribological properties get mainly determined by the carbide grain size fraction. Within the scope of this study, the tribological characteristics of iron based WC-W 2 C reinforced arc sprayed coatings deposited using cored wires consisting of different carbide grain size fractions were examined. Microstructural characteristics of the produced coatings were scrutinized using electron microscopy and x-ray diffraction analyses. Ball-on-disk test as well as <b>Taber</b> <b>Abraser</b> and dry sand rubber wheel test were employed to analyze both the dry sliding and the abrasive wear behavior. It was shown that a reduced carbide grain size fraction as filling leads to an enhanced wear resistance against sliding. In terms of the <b>Taber</b> <b>Abraser</b> test, it is also demonstrated that a fine carbide grain size fraction results in an improved wear resistant against abrasion. As opposed to that, a poorer wear resistance was found within the dry sand rubber wheel tests. The findings show that the operating mechanisms for both abrasion tests affect the stressed surface in a different way, leading either to microcutting or microploughing...|$|E
40|$|The scratch {{resistance}} of coatings used on two highly visible automotive applications (automotive bodies and window glazings) were examined and reviewed. Types of damage (scratch vs. mar), {{the impact on}} customers, and the causes of scratch events were investigated. Different exterior clearcoat technologies, including UV curable and self-healing formulations were reviewed, including results from nano- and macro-scratch tests. Polycarbonate hardcoat glazings were tested vs. annealed glass samples using a <b>Taber</b> <b>abraser,</b> with the resulting damage analyzed using transmitted haze measurements and optical profilometry. A correlation between the damage seen in glass samples (many smooth, shallow mars) and the best hardcoat samples (fewer, deeper scratches) and the haze measurements was discussed. Nano-scratch results showed similar fracture forces, but measurably improved mar resistance for the hardcoats/glass system compared to exterior clearcoats...|$|E
40|$|A new {{preparation}} {{route for}} an dielectric NIR-reflexion filter on glass is described. Coating sols are synthesized from SiO 2 and TiO 2 nanoparticles with photopolymerizable surface ligands. A 5 -layer stack consisting of 2 SiO 2 and 3 TiO 2 layers was deposited on float glass by angle-dependent dip-coating (ADDC) with a fixed angle of 4 ° to the vertical and subsequent UV-curing. Finally, the whole stack was densified at 450 °C without cracking or discolouring. UV-vis-NIR transmittance and reflectance spectra show a steep increase of reflectance at 750 nm. In the range between 800 nm and 1200 nm, the reflectance is > 80 %. The visible transmittance is about 72 % due to single reflexion peaks. The bandwidth of the NIR reflection filter prepared by ADDC is about 200 nm larger and its maximum reflectance is only 5 % smaller compared to vertical dip-coating. The interference layer stack shows excellent stability in <b>Taber</b> <b>Abraser,</b> rubber, saline and UV tests, indicating a high potential for practical application...|$|E
40|$|Epoxy resin {{is one of}} {{the strongest}} commercially exploitable {{thermosetting}} polymers in the polymer family; however its expensive nature in comparison with other thermosetting polymers such as vinylester and polyester limits its applications as a structural material. Inexpensive fillers on the other hand, especially those derived from agro-industrial wastes are very important in reducing the overall cost of polymer composites and furthermore influential in enhancing some of their engineering properties. In the present study, the wear resistance and mechanical behaviour of epoxy polymer matrix filled with < 75 and 75 μm calcined particles of African land snail shells have been comparatively investigated. The wear resistance and the mechanical behaviour of the composites were studied via <b>Taber</b> <b>Abraser</b> and INSTRON universal testing machine. Also, the elemental constituents of the calcined snail shell and the epoxy biocomposites were characterized by X-Ray Fluorescence Spectroscopy and Scanning Electron Microscopy/Energy Dispersion Spectroscopy. From the experimental results, it was observed that, at the highest filler loading, smaller particle size presented a biocomposite with significant enhancement in wear and mechanical properties. However, it was also observed that increase in particle size showed no significant enhancement in the mechanical properties of the biocomposites...|$|E
40|$|A photochemically curable {{transparent}} {{hard coating}} material {{has been developed}} to improve the wear resistance of organic polymers. Methacrylate functionalized silanes and nanoscaled boehmite particles {{were used for the}} preparation of the UV curable hard coatings by the sol-gel technique. The inorganic network is formed {{as a result of the}} controlled hydrolysis and condensation of the methaclyloxysilanes in the presence of nanoparticles (particle size: 15 nm). The hydrolysis and condensation of the methacryloxy silane, for two hours in presence of boehmite nanoparticles (43 wt. %), at 100 °C leads to a degree of condensation of 80 % of the inorganic network, as determined by Si- 29 -NMR spectroscopy. The organic network is formed by photoinitiated polymerisation of the methacrylic-functions in only a few minutes, using UV light from a Hg high pressure lamp. Transparent coatings on plastic substrates (PC, PMMA) were produced by spray coating with good optical quality and thicknesses of several micrometers. The transparent coatings show excellent adhesion on PMMA and PC (GT/TT = 0 / 0, DIN 53151), even without using primers, and also good abrasion resistance after the <b>Taber</b> <b>abraser</b> test with haze values of 10 % after 1000 cycles (CS 10 F rolls, 5, 4 N, DIN 52347). The water exposition test (65 °C, deionized water) and the Suntest, without using filters, did not result in any crack formation, loss of adhesion or yellowing within the test period of two weeks...|$|E
40|$|The {{life cycle}} of commercially printed digital {{documents}} (in particular, marketing and promotional items, direct mailers, business communications, and on-demand color books) was examined to find stress points where potential permanence problems could exist. The stress and life cycle overview covers the stages of processes in printing and finishing, mailing preparation and fulfillment, distribution, usage, and recycling. Stress points found in the different stages of the life cycle, whether physical or chemical, include (but are not limited to) scratching, rubbing, cracking, solvent exposure, light exposure, moisture exposure, heat exposure, and air contamination exposure. Tests for abrasion resistance, folding resistance, solvent resistance, light-fastness, water-fastness, thermostability, and gas/ozone fastness were researched. Based on a survey given to randomly selected printers, printing press vendors, and print buyers, the tests for abrasion resistance, folding resistance, and rub resistance were selected. Using offset lithography as a benchmark, three commercial digital presses as well as high-speed ink jet technology were included in this testing. Using a combination of solid circular test targets and the “Three Musicians” test target (an image for visual comparisons), the <b>Taber</b> <b>Abraser</b> testing method, the Sutherland Rub testing method, and a folding procedure outlined in ASTM document F 1351 were used to examine and to compare the five presses in this study (three commercial digital presses, one offset lithographic press, and one high-speed ink jet press). After testing was performed, visual ranking, changes in density, Delta E, and the abrasion resistance index were used as the criteria to evaluate results. Testing {{results showed that the}} high-speed ink jet held up the best in each test performed during this research; however, the image quality of the high-speed ink jet press was less than the image quality of any other press in this study. The second best performer in the testing was the offset lithographic press. The test performance of these particular presses, as compared with the commercial digital presses, was attributed to the different drying methods in each of the different printing technologies. In the ink jet and lithographic presses, the evaporation, absorption, and oxidation drying methods seemed to hold up better to the testing performed than the drying method of toner-based technology. With oxidation and evaporation, the image (i. e., the ink) actually becomes a part of the paper after drying, whereas, in toner technology, the image (i. e., the toner) is fused to the paper and actually sits on top of it. Within the digital printing industry, coatings have been put in place to alleviate some of these problems, but they have not been tested here. This research shows that offset lithography is the dominant technology in terms of offering abrasion and folding resistance of its printed product...|$|E
