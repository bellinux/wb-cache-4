5|$|In 1960, {{through an}} {{advertisement}} {{in the national}} press, contact was made between former paratroopers in Wiesbaden and four English ex-servicemen in Royal Tunbridge Wells. Through this contact the friendship that now exists between the two towns sprang up, leading to the signing in 1989 of the official <b>Twinning</b> Charter. Also through this the Tunbridge Wells <b>Twinning</b> and Friendship Association (TWTFA) was formed.|$|E

50|$|There are {{two types}} of twins: {{identical}} and fraternal. Identical <b>twins</b> have exactly the same genes; fraternal <b>twins</b> are no more similar than regular siblings.

Studies suggest that identical <b>twins</b> appear to display more <b>twin</b> talk than fraternal <b>twins.</b> At about 3 years of age, <b>twin</b> talk usually ends.|$|R

50|$|A {{parasitic}} <b>twin</b> (also {{known as}} an asymmetrical or unequal conjoined <b>twin)</b> {{is the result of}} the processes that also produce vanishing <b>twins</b> and conjoined <b>twins,</b> and may represent a continuum between the two. Parasitic <b>twins</b> occur when a <b>twin</b> embryo begins developing in utero, but the pair does not fully separate, and one embryo maintains dominant development at the expense of its <b>twin.</b> Unlike conjoined <b>twins,</b> one ceases development during gestation and is vestigial to a mostly fully formed, otherwise healthy individual <b>twin.</b> The undeveloped <b>twin</b> is defined as parasitic, rather than conjoined, because it is incompletely formed or wholly dependent on the body functions of the complete fetus.The independent <b>twin</b> is called the autosite.|$|R
5|$|Radyr is twinned with Saint-Philbert-de-Grand-Lieu, a town {{south-west}} of Nantes (Cardiff's twin city) on {{the southern}} shores of the Lac de Grand Lieu in Loire-Atlantique, France. The first exchange visit took place in May 1986 and <b>Twinning</b> Charters were signed by Chairmen of both community councils.

50|$|The exact {{development}} of craniopagus parasiticus {{is not well}} known. However, {{it is known that}} the underdeveloped <b>twin</b> is a parasitic <b>twin.</b> Parasitic <b>twins</b> are known to occur in utero when monozygotic <b>twins</b> start to develop as an embryo, but the embryo fails to completely split. When this happens, one embryo will dominate development, while the other's development is severely altered. The key difference between a parasitic <b>twin</b> and conjoined <b>twins</b> is that in parasitic <b>twins,</b> one <b>twin,</b> the parasite, stops development during gestation, whereas the other <b>twin,</b> the autosite, develops completely.|$|R

40|$|Twin-Reversed Arterial Perfusion (TRAP sequence) {{is a rare}} {{complication}} of monochorionic <b>twins</b> (MC, <b>twins</b> sharing one placenta). TRAP sequence is known as acardius or chorioangiopagus parasiticus. It occurs in 1 % of monochorionic <b>twin</b> pregnancies and in 1 in 35, 000 pregnancies. The risk of recurrence was estimated 1 : 10, 000. TRAP sequence {{is characterized by a}} structurally normal pump <b>twin</b> perfusing an anomalous <b>twin.</b> In TRAP syndrome, there is mortality and deformities in both <b>twins.</b> The acardiac/acephalic <b>twin</b> is a parasitic <b>twin</b> that fails to develop a head, arms and a heart. The parasitic <b>twin</b> is with or without legs, receives its blood supply from the host <b>twin</b> (Pump <b>twin).</b> In TRAP sequence, one <b>twin</b> is usually developmentally normal (pump <b>twin)</b> and the other <b>twin</b> has a serious condition, either missing a heart (acardiac) or a head (acephalic) or both, that prevents it from surviving on its own. The acardiac/acephalic <b>twin</b> receives all of its blood from the normal or “pump ” <b>twin.</b> The abnormal fetus does not have a heart; all of its blood must come from the normal <b>twin.</b> And it is kept alive by the blood which is pumped from the normal <b>twin</b> through the placenta. The term “reversed perfusion ” is used to describe this scenario because blood enters the acardiac/acephalic <b>twin</b> through reversed flow through its umbilical artery and exits through the umbilical vein, which is opposite to the normal blood supply of the fetus. The acardiac <b>twin</b> loses direct vascular connection with the placental villi and receives its entire blood supply from the pump <b>twin</b> [1, 2, 3, 4]...|$|R

5000|$|Siblicide {{can also}} be seen in humans in the form of <b>twins</b> in the mother's womb. One <b>twin</b> may grow to be an average weight, while the other is underweight. This is a result of one <b>twin</b> taking more {{nutrients}} from the mother than the other <b>twin.</b> In cases of identical <b>twins,</b> they may even have <b>Twin</b> to <b>Twin</b> Transfusion Syndrome (TTTS). This means that the <b>twins</b> share the same placenta and blood and nutrients can then move between <b>twins.</b> The <b>twins</b> may also be suffering from Intrauterine Growth Restriction (IUGR), meaning that there is not enough room for both of the <b>twins</b> to grow. [...] All of these factors can limit the growth of one of the <b>twins</b> while promoting the growth of the other. While one of the <b>twins</b> may not die because of these factors, it is entirely possible that their health will be compromised and lead to complications after their birth.|$|R

50|$|Conjoined <b>twins</b> are at {{high risk}} to being {{stillborn}} or dying shortly after birth. In some cases, a healthy <b>twin</b> and a parasitic <b>twin</b> are born. The parasitic <b>twin</b> has no hope for survival and dies and is then surgically separated from its <b>twin.</b> Depending upon how the <b>twins</b> are attached and what is shared among them, complications can arise from surgically separating the live <b>twin</b> from the dead <b>twin.</b> In Ischiopagus cases, the children share a pelvic region along with the gastrointestinal tract and genital region. Most Ischiopagus <b>twins</b> will need reconstruction surgery of the genitals and the gastrointestinal tract tract so that the <b>twin</b> will be able to perform normal bodily functions.|$|R
