As a transfer function, it employed a threshold, equivalent to using the Heaviside step function. Initially, only a simple model was considered, with binary inputs and outputs, some restrictions on the possible weights, and a more flexible threshold value. Since the beginning it was already noticed that any boolean function could be implemented by networks of such devices, what is easily seen {{from the fact that}} one can implement the AND and OR functions, and use them in the disjunctive or the conjunctive normal form.Researchers also soon realized that cyclic networks, with feedbacks through neurons, could define dynamical systems with memory, but most of the research concentrated (and still does) on strictly feed-forward networks because of the smaller difficulty they present.|$|E

Bersini and Detours (1994) have shown how sensitive Conway's Game of Life is to the updating scheme. Any interesting behaviour disappears in the asynchronous case. Harvey and Bossomaier (1997) pointed out that stochastic updating in random boolean networks results in the expression of point attractors only: there is no repeatable cyclic behaviour, although they introduced the concept of loose cyclic attractors. Kanada (1994) has shown that some one-dimensional CA models that generate non-chaotic patterns when updated synchronously generate edge of chaos patterns when randomised. Orponen (1997) has demonstrated that any synchronously updated network of <b>threshold</b> <b>logic</b> units (see Artificial neuron) can be simulated by a network that has no constraints {{on the order of}} updates. Sipper et al. (1997) investigated the evolution of non-uniform CAs that perform specific computing tasks. These models relax the normal requirement of all nodes having the same update rule. In their models, nodes were organised into blocks. Nodes within a block were updated synchronously, but blocks were updated asynchronously. They experimented with three schemes: (1) at each time step, a block is chosen at random with replacement; (2) at each time step, a block is chosen at random without replacement; (3) at each time step, a block is chosen according to a fixed update order.|$|E

VDDmin consists of a systematic component (VDDmin(SYS)) and a random variation component (VDDmin(RAND)).

Background subtraction is a basic component step for this task: given a frame in the video sequence, a moving object can be detected by spotting {{the parts of the}} frame that do not fit the background model. Therefore, a high performance background modeling and background updating algorithm is crucial for background subtraction. We work with a fixed camera in a stationary scene and a simple non-statistical background model is utilized, therefore we formulate the problem of background subtraction as the problem of background updating.

The thresholding problem involves a tradeoff between false alarms and missed detections. Counter based thresholding can detect smaller faults with higher probability and lower false alarms than is possible using simple constant thresholds. This improvement is achieved by effectively introducing dynamics into the <b>thresholding</b> <b>logic</b> as opposed to decisioning based on a single time step.

Two important synthesis considerations of <b>threshold</b> <b>logic</b> circuits are addressed namely, <b>threshold</b> <b>logic</b> function identification and reducing {{the total number of}} <b>threshold</b> <b>logic</b> gates required to represent the given boolean circuit description. A fast method to identify the given Boolean function as a <b>threshold</b> <b>logic</b> function with weight assignment is introduced. It characterizes the <b>threshold</b> <b>logic</b> function based on the modified chows parameters which results in drastic reduction in time and complexity. Experiment results shown that the proposed method is at least 10 times faster for each input and around 20 times faster for 7 and 8 input, when comparing with the algorithmic based methods. Similarly, it is 100 times faster for 8 input, when comparing with asummable method. Existing <b>threshold</b> <b>logic</b> synthesis methods decompose the larger input functions into smaller input functions and perform synthesis for them. This results in {{increase in the number of}} <b>threshold</b> <b>logic</b> gates required to represent the given circuit description.
