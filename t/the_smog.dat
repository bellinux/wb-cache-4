5|$|In {{the months}} that followed, {{scientists}} and doctors studied the smog's impact. It became clear that <b>the</b> <b>smog</b> had been a major environmental disaster with severe public health effects. One study estimated that 10 percent of the city's population suffered adverse health effects, such as stinging eyes, coughing, and respiratory distress. City health officials initially maintained that <b>the</b> <b>smog</b> had not caused any deaths. Later, a statistical analysis found that 168 people had likely died because of <b>the</b> <b>smog.</b> Another study found that <b>the</b> <b>smog</b> had shortened the lifespans of 366 people.|$|E
5|$|The {{inversion}} prevented {{air pollutants}} from rising and trapped them within the city. <b>The</b> <b>smog</b> event itself started on Wednesday November 23, {{coinciding with the}} beginning of the long Thanksgiving weekend. The material sources of <b>the</b> <b>smog</b> were particulates and chemicals from factories, chimneys, and vehicles. Sulfur dioxide levels rose. Smoke shade, a measure of visibility interference in the atmosphere, was two to three times higher than usual.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>smog</b> catalyzed greater {{national}} {{awareness of}} air pollution as a serious health problem and political issue. New York City updated its local laws on air pollution control. Prompted by <b>the</b> <b>smog,</b> President Lyndon B. Johnson and members of Congress worked to pass federal legislation regulating air pollution in the United States, culminating in the 1967 Air Quality Act and the 1970 Clean Air Act. The 1966 smog is a milestone that has been compared with other pollution events, including {{the health effects of}} pollution from the September 11 attacks and pollution in China.|$|E

500|$|Before <b>the</b> 1966 <b>smog,</b> <b>the</b> city {{government}} had {{been slow to}} act to regulate air pollution. Despite general awareness of the health and environmental impacts of smog, other problems took priority: as The New York Times reported, issues like [...] "housing, crime, education and keeping the city 'cool'" [...] were {{at the forefront of}} {{city government}} concerns. But <b>the</b> 1966 <b>smog</b> impelled a swift response by the city government, who now felt pressure to respond [...] "in the aftermath of disaster." [...] Lindsay, then a liberal Rockefeller Republican, had run as a supporter of stronger air pollution control in his 1965 mayoral campaign, and <b>the</b> 1966 <b>smog</b> reinforced Lindsay's position on the issue.|$|R

5|$|Two {{major medical}} studies have {{analyzed}} {{the extent of}} casualties from <b>the</b> <b>smog.</b> Leonard Greenburg — the same medical researcher who had previously published findings on the death count of the 1953 and 1963 smogs — published a paper in October 1967 showing that the previous year's smog had likely killed 168 people. Greenburg showed that there were 24 deaths in excess of how many would normally be expected {{at that time of}} year every day, over a period of seven days — using a period four days longer than <b>the</b> <b>smog</b> itself had lasted because of the delay between smog exposure and resultant health effects. Greenburg said that his analysis could not account for damage during <b>the</b> <b>smog</b> that would remain latent and continue to cause disease and death for years. The results of Greenburg's paper were reported by the New York Times. A 1978 medical paper published in the Bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine estimated that <b>the</b> <b>smog</b> shortened the lives of 366 people.|$|E
5|$|Nonfatal {{health effects}} were {{difficult}} to measure in the smog's immediate aftermath. Some of the health effects were themselves delayed; for example, most of the serious effects on the elderly population would only manifest days after initial exposure. A study on the smog's nonfatal health effects was published in December 1966. The study, conducted by a nonprofit health research group, found that 10 percent of the city's population suffered some negative health effects from <b>the</b> <b>smog,</b> including symptoms like stinging eyes, coughing, wheezing, the coughing-up of phlegm, or difficulty breathing. The director of the research group said anything serious enough to adversely affect as much as 10 percent of the population, like <b>the</b> <b>smog</b> had, indicated {{the existence of a}} serious public health problem.|$|E
5|$|The {{most widely}} {{recognized}} {{legacy of the}} 1966 smog was the political reaction to it, which galvanized the nascent environmental movement in the United States and prompted demand for sweeping air-pollution control laws. <b>The</b> <b>smog</b> has been remembered for various purposes by scientists, historians, journalists, writers, artists, activists, and political commentators.|$|E
500|$|Other major air pollution, {{particularly}} in China, {{has been compared}} to <b>the</b> 1966 <b>smog.</b> Elizabeth M. Lynch, a New York City legal scholar, said that images of visible air pollution in Beijing from 2012 were [...] "gross" [...] but not [...] "that much different from pictures of New York City in the 1950s and 1960s," [...] specifically referring to the 1952, 1962, and 1966 smog events. Lynch wrote that the Chinese government's increased transparency on the issue was an encouraging sign that pollution in China could be regulated and abated just as it had in the United States. Similar comparisons between <b>the</b> 1966 <b>smog</b> and Chinese pollution in late 2012 appeared in Business Insider and Slate. USA Today cited <b>the</b> 1966 <b>smog</b> after China issued its first [...] "red alert" [...] air quality warning in December 2015; the same month, an article in The Huffington Post used <b>the</b> 1966 <b>smog</b> to argue that China could follow the United State's model to regulate pollution.|$|R

50|$|<b>The</b> 1948 Donora <b>smog</b> was a {{historic}} air inversion {{that resulted in}} a wall of smog that killed 20 people and sickened 7,000 more in Donora, Pennsylvania, a mill town on the Monongahela River, 24 mi southeast of Pittsburgh. The event is commemorated by <b>the</b> Donora <b>Smog</b> Museum.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>smog</b> {{event of}} 1966 {{was preceded by}} two other major smog episodes in New York City: one in November 1953, and one in January–February 1963. Using {{statistical}} analysis that compares {{the number of deaths}} during periods of smog with the number of deaths during the same time in other years, medical scientists led by Leonard Greenburg were able to determine that excess deaths occurred during those smogs, from which it can be inferred that <b>the</b> <b>smog</b> caused or contributed to those deaths. An estimated 220–240 deaths were caused by the six-day 1953 smog, and an estimated 300–405 deaths were caused by the two-week 1963 smog. Other episodes of smog had occurred in the city prior to 1966, but were not accompanied by significant excess deaths.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>smog</b> was {{compared}} to the 1948 smog in Donora, Pennsylvania and the Great Smog of London of 1952, both of which lasted five days. The London smog's death toll of 4,000 was far higher than Donora, but <b>the</b> <b>smog</b> in Donora was far more severe; {{at the time of}} its smog, Donora was a small industrial town with a population of only 13,000, and its population was proportionally hit much harder with 20 deaths and smog-related illnesses among 43 percent of the population. Pollution experts estimated that if a smog as strong as the Donora smog had occurred in the much more populous New York City, the death toll could have been as high as 11,000 with four million ill.|$|E

5|$|Congressional {{interest}} and public pressure for greater air pollution regulation had existed since {{the signing of}} the 1963 Clean Air Act, the first federal legislation on the issue, but further action had been opposed by members of Congress who believed responsibility for air regulation properly lay with the states, not the federal government.

The lumber industry was hit hard by the recession of the early 1980s, and Missoula's economy began to diversify.

Glenn at the Interstate Sanitation Commission sent a message advising the alert to end at 9:40a.m., based on weather and air readings.
