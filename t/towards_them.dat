5|$|Portuguese {{immigrants}} {{had been}} in Hawaii since the whaling days. Many of them were mixed blood Afro-Portuguese sailors who found the brown-skinned Native Hawaiians free of racial bias <b>towards</b> <b>them.</b> The first Portuguese plantation labor emigration to Hawaii came from the Azores and Madeira in 1878, starved out of their homelands by widespread grape vine fungus. They emigrated mostly in family groups, joining an established community of their own culture.|$|E
5|$|When Peter {{returns to}} the group, he discovers that Liz is {{breaking}} up with her boyfriend Flash Thompson after the latter gets jealous that she spent the day so close to Peter. Sally blames Peter for it and runs to comfort Liz. Gwen approaches Peter, and the two agree {{they need to have}} a talk with Harry about his belligerent attitude <b>towards</b> <b>them</b> and constant strange behavior.|$|E
5|$|When tufted males clap, females look <b>towards</b> <b>them</b> {{and display}} {{a greater number}} of tap {{displays}} to them than to the gray morph. Females also respond to tufted morphs' clapping more often by settling than for gray males. However, after the females look towards the males, gray males approach the female more often than the tufted male. Females often tip their abdomens from side to side.|$|E

5|$|Because Kant viewed {{rationality}} as {{the basis}} for being a moral patient—one due moral consideration—he believed that animals have no moral rights. Animals, according to Kant, are not rational, thus one cannot behave immorally <b>towards</b> <b>them.</b> Although he did not believe we have any duties towards animals, Kant did believe being cruel to them was wrong because our behaviour might influence our attitudes toward human beings: if we become accustomed to harming animals, then we are more likely to see harming humans as acceptable.|$|E
5|$|Following their {{experiences}} with the Sitgreaves and Whipple expeditions, and encounters with Mormons and the soldiers at Fort Yuma, the Mohave were aware that whites were immigrating to the region in increasing numbers. It was difficult for the Mohave to predict {{the behavior of the}} arriving whites, some of whom, like Whipple, were amiably disposed <b>towards</b> <b>them,</b> whereas others such as the Mormons were hostile. The kwanami were divided on how the situation should be approached; some advocated an aggressive posture, denying whites all passage through their territory, but others, including Irataba, preferred a peaceful approach, or even an alliance with them that could put the Mohave in a stronger position relative to their traditional enemies the Paiute, Chemehuevi, and Walapai.|$|E
5|$|In public, Alexandra was dignified and charming; in private, affectionate and jolly. She enjoyed {{many social}} activities, {{including}} dancing and ice-skating, {{and was an}} expert horsewoman and tandem driver. She also enjoyed hunting, {{to the dismay of}} Queen Victoria, who asked her to stop, but without success. Even after the birth of her first child, she continued to socialise much as before, which led to some friction between the queen and the young couple, exacerbated by Alexandra's loathing of Prussians and the queen's partiality <b>towards</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

5|$|James {{achieved}} {{more success}} in foreign policy. Never having been {{at war with}} Spain, he devoted his efforts to bringing the long Anglo–Spanish War to an end, and a peace treaty was signed {{between the two countries}} in August 1604, thanks to skilled diplomacy on the part of Robert Cecil and Henry Howard, now Earl of Northampton, which James celebrated by hosting a great banquet. Freedom of worship for Catholics in England, however, continued to be a major objective of Spanish policy, causing constant dilemmas for James, distrusted abroad for repression of Catholics while at home being encouraged by the Privy Council to show even less tolerance <b>towards</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|Just {{over half}} of the French {{infantry}} were regulars of the old Royal Army, as were nearly all of the cavalry and, most importantly, the artillery, which were widely regarded as the best in Europe at the time. These veterans provided a professional core to steady the enthusiastic volunteer battalions. Combined, Dumouriez' Army of the North and Kellermann's Army of the Centre totalled approximately 54,000 troops. Heading <b>towards</b> <b>them</b> was Brunswick's coalition army of about 84,000, all veteran Prussian and Austrian troops augmented by large complements of Hessians and the French royalist Army of Condé.|$|E
5|$|Kom {{gives birth}} to twins and applies for a {{government}} job. However, she refuses {{the position of a}} police constable, feeling that as a world-champion boxer, she deserves better. It devastates her to learn that people no longer recognise her. Onler encourages her to restart her boxing training. She joins the gym again, leaving her husband to look after the twins at home. Her coach is still upset about her decision to marry, but Kom makes a comeback in the National Boxing Championship. Despite performing better than her opponent, she loses the match due to the apparent partiality of the judges. Kom throws a chair in anger <b>towards</b> <b>them,</b> resulting in a ban. She later writes an apology letter, and the official accepts it, but only after insulting her.|$|E

5|$|Lambda is an {{advanced}} lifeform created on Fodra. His mistreatment by humans fueled his hatred <b>towards</b> <b>them.</b> During the party's childhood, he resides inside Richard {{after he was}} injured by Sophie and as a result, saved Richard's life. Seven years later, Lambda is reawakened when Richard receives a fatal wound. Lambda empowers Richard and manipulates him to achieve his goals of destroying humanity. After he is defeated by the party, Lambda is absorbed by Asbel who convinces him to give humans a chance. In Lineage and Legacies, he absorbs Fodra's consciousness to dissuade her hatred as Asbel did for him. He is voiced by Shigeru Nakahara and dubbed by Keith Silverstein.|$|E
5|$|On 3 August Dainty sighted a {{large ship}} heading {{directly}} <b>towards</b> <b>them</b> {{and as it}} drew nearer, its enormous size became apparent. The carrack was far larger than Santa Cruz, fully {{three times the size}} of England's biggest ship. Madre de Deus was attacked by the much smaller Dainty. Around midday Newport's Golden Dragon, followed by Roebuck - bigger than Dainty, but only a fraction of the Madre, joined the fray. These were followed at two-hour intervals by Foresight and Prudence in the evening. The Dainty had her foremast shot away and was out of the battle for five hours.|$|E
5|$|On 7 January 1783, Concorde was {{in company}} with Nymphe. They sighted HMS Raven, which {{initially}} sailed <b>towards</b> <b>them</b> until {{she realized that}} they were not British frigates. An all-day chase ensued until about 9p.m. when one of the frigates got within pistol-shot and fired a broadside that took away Ravens main topgallant-mast. The chase continued until about 10:30p.m. when one of the frigates was again in range, with the other coming up rapidly. At this point, Raven, which was under the command of Commander John Wells, struck. The French Navy took Raven into service under the name Cérès, which she had born when under French colours between 1778 and 1782.|$|E

5|$|Shane arms {{the rest}} of the group and they {{converge}} on the barn just as Hershel, Rick, and the other return with the snared walkers. Shane screams that walkers are not people and shoots one of the captive walkers before breaking the locks off the barn doors. Walkers start to file out, and Shane, Andrea, T-Dog (IronE Singleton), Daryl, and Glenn execute the zombies while the others watch. At the last moment, Sophia (Madison Lintz) emerges from the barn, dead and zombified. The group is paralyzed with shock and sadness, unable to act as Sophia walks <b>towards</b> <b>them.</b> Only Rick is able to step forward and shoot her.|$|E
5|$|Six {{months later}} in Rome, Caecilius {{and his family}} are shown to be successful; he is running a {{profitable}} business, Evelina has a social life in comparison to her seclusion in Pompeii, and his son Quintus is studying to become a doctor. Before Quintus leaves, he pays tribute to the family's household gods (in marked contrast to his disrespectful attitude <b>towards</b> <b>them</b> {{at the start of the}} episode), a bas relief depiction of which are in the form of the Doctor, Donna and the TARDIS.|$|E
5|$|Sultan Hamad died {{suddenly}} at 11:40 EAT (08:40 UTC) on 25 August 1896. His 29-year-old nephew Khalid bin Bargash, who was suspected {{by some of}} his assassination, moved into the palace complex at Zanzibar Town without British approval, in contravention of the treaty agreed with Ali. The British government preferred an alternative candidate, Hamud bin Muhammed, who was more favourably disposed <b>towards</b> <b>them.</b> Khalid was warned by the consul and diplomatic agent to Zanzibar, Basil Cave, and General Mathews to think carefully about his actions. This course of action had proved successful three years earlier when Khalid had tried to claim the sultanate {{after the death of}} Ali, and the British consul-general, Rennell Rodd, had persuaded him of the dangers of such an action.|$|E

5|$|The First Nations in {{the north}} {{typically}} had some prior experience of Europeans, for example through contact with the Hudson's Bay Company, and there was little conflict between the police and these native communities, and few crimes committed. The First Nations typically {{did not like the}} police, however, and often blamed them for wider government policies; for their part, the mounted police often regarded the First Nations with contempt. By comparison, the mounted police got on much better with the Inuit, who had seen far less contact with Europeans. The force generally took a more liberal, paternalistic attitude <b>towards</b> <b>them,</b> often applying informal justice rather than official laws when the occasional Inuit crime was committed. Members of the First Nations and Inuit were employed to drive police dog sleds and cook for their patrols.|$|E
5|$|The global {{definition}} of the Earth's field {{is based on a}} mathematical model. If a line is drawn {{through the center of the}} Earth, parallel to the moment of the best-fitting magnetic dipole, the two positions where it intersects the Earth's surface are called the North and South geomagnetic poles. If the Earth's magnetic field were perfectly dipolar, the geomagnetic poles and magnetic dip poles would coincide and compasses would point <b>towards</b> <b>them.</b> However, the Earth's field has a significant non-dipolar contribution, so the poles do not coincide and compasses do not generally point at either.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Nagarjuna goes to {{a temple}} with Priya in a car which has no brakes and Rao chases them along with Anjali. Both of the couples are nearing the same clock tower where they died in their past lives. A worried Chaitanya is offered a lift by a young biker who follow them. On 10:20 AM when all the four are safe near the clock tower, a lorry driven by a drunk driver is shown rushing <b>towards</b> <b>them.</b> The biker and Chaitanya jump from the bike, which goes on to hit the lorry tyre, distracting the lorry's path.
