5|$|The loss snapped Butler's 25-game winning streak, {{the longest}} in school history. Butler became the {{smallest}} school {{to play for}} a National Championship since Jacksonville in 1970. Stevens became the second-youngest head coach to coach in the NCAA National Championship Game, behind Branch McCracken who led the Indiana Hoosiers to the 1940 National Championship at age 31. Stevens was named as both a Hugh Durham and Jim Phelan Award finalist for the third consecutive year, losing to Mike Young and Jamie Dixon respectively.

5|$|The British {{wheelchair}} curling {{team was}} made up of Frank Duffy <b>the</b> <b>skip,</b> Ken Dickson, Tom Killin, Angie Malone and Michael McCreadie. This was the same team that had won the World Championships in January 2005 in Glasgow, all but Killin had also won the 2004 World Championships, and many considered them strong contenders for a medal. Although {{this was the first time}} wheelchair curling had been included as a Paralympic sport the team did have previous Games experience. Michael McCreadie, who made his first Paralympics appearance in 1972, was competing in his sixth Paralympics and had previously won two bronze medals for Lawn Bowls in the 1976 Summer Paralympics. Tom Killin was a previous silver medallist in wheelchair fencing at the 1980 Summer Games. The team received the same preparation as Great Britain's Olympic Curlers; funding came from the National Lottery as well as the Scottish Institute of Sport. The team's coach, Tom Pendreigh, was also personal coach of the men's Olympic skip David Murdoch.|$|E
5|$|There {{are several}} changes to {{gameplay}} {{and the way}} text is displayed during Bad Boys Love in the original version of the game: saving is disabled except at certain points in the story, the function to skip dialogue and interactions is removed, and plot-important dialogue and narrative are highlighted with colored text; usually yellow, though text of particularly critical importance is highlighted in red. In the 2014 remake however, the option to save is available at all times, <b>the</b> <b>skip</b> function is retained, and text is no longer highlighted.

In tournament play, the most frequent circumstance in which a decision has to be made by someone other than <b>the</b> vice <b>skip</b> is <b>the</b> failure of <b>the</b> vice <b>skips</b> to agree on which stone is closest to the button.

The squad found quick success by winning the 2010 Prince Edward Island Scotties Tournament of Hearts, which earned them the right to represent Prince Edward Island at the 2010 Scotties Tournament of Hearts.

25|$|Once the {{new company}} had been formed in 1923, Murray's Shaft was {{connected}} to the 120Fathom Level, and then <b>the</b> <b>Skip</b> Shaft was abandoned. The 120Fathom Level became a major production level in the mine for the next thirty years. Murray's Shaft was deepened to the 135Fathom Level in 1924 and to the 150Fathom Level in 1928. Production during the early 1930s came from the four new levels below the 90Fathom Level. However, Murray's Shaft had been sunk on the vein in some rich ore-bearing ground which had been stoped away. Although the shaft was supported with steel girders and timbers, and the empty stope had been backfilled with rock, it was prone to collapses, when the supports gave way and waste rock poured into it. This happened (twice) in 1931 and again in 1933, bringing production to a halt while it was repaired.|$|E

In 1988, aged eighteen, Nadeau won his first World Karting Association (WKA) Gold Cup championship. Motorsports Talent Scout, Dicken Wear, had seen Jerry Race {{for a number of}} years in Karting and asked if he would like to drive his SCCA SS/C Toyota Celica at an EMRA open track event at Lime Rock Park. Jerry caught the eye of Skip Barber and a few other driving instructors that day. Afterward, he was introduced to Bruce MacInnes and fellow graduates Walter Bladstrom, Tom Cotter, Bill Fisher, Bob Kullas, Frank Martinelli, and Art Regan who gave Nadeau financial support. He defended his karting title for the next two years. In 1991, he took the WKA Grand National Championship.

500|$|Alavi was {{not aware}} of any {{pushback}} from Activision, the game's publisher, about the level. Similarly, most members of Infinity Ward were supportive of [...] "No Russian", but Alavi did note that there were some members who strongly opposed the content. By contrast, game testers elicited a variety of reactions. Many testers were initially angry and confused at the level's content, but eventually settled down and began shooting at the civilians. One tester, who at the time was enlisted in the United States Armed Forces, refused to play the level at all, but was willing to play the rest of the game. This led to the implementation of <b>the</b> <b>skip</b> feature, as Alavi did not want the player to be punished for not doing what they felt was morally wrong.|$|E

The two men had known each other for years and Ramey had recently been on Kenney's staff when Kenney was commander of the Fourth Air Force. [...] "I had {{a lot of confidence in}} him," [...] Kenney later wrote, [...] "and believed he would do a real job for me. Arnold replied the next day that I could have him."

Writing for The Guardian, Keith Stuart criticized <b>the</b> <b>skip</b> feature, describing it as a [...] "cop-out" [...] for a level that the developer intended players to experience.
