This is in contrast to <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> diarrhea that is typical of gastroenteritis. Infections of the lungs or urinary tract in children may also cause vomiting or diarrhea. Classical diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, but without diarrhea. One study found that 17% of children with DKA were initially diagnosed as having gastroenteritis.|$|E

5|$|Enamel's {{primary mineral}} is hydroxyapatite, {{which is a}} {{crystalline}} calcium phosphate. <b>The</b> <b>large</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> minerals in enamel accounts {{not only for its}} strength but also for its brittleness. Dentin, which is less mineralized and less brittle, compensates for enamel and is necessary as a support. Unlike dentin and bone, enamel does not contain collagen. Proteins of note in the development of enamel are ameloblastins, amelogenins, enamelins and tuftelins. It is believed that they aid in the development of enamel by serving as framework support, among other functions.|$|E

5|$|In {{countries}} where {{women have to}} do paid work in order to feed their family, {{there is a lack}} of regulation and safety standards regarding female workers due to <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> informal work available. In Thailand for example, due to the severe economic crisis in 1997, many women have jobs in the informal industry, and often do home-based work so that they can do their domestic jobs concurrently with their paid jobs. This increases the work intensity by women doing more than one job at a time, and has been shown to have deteriorating effects on women's health.|$|E

5|$|The {{industrial}} {{extraction of}} rhodium is complex because the ores {{are mixed with}} other metals such as palladium, silver, platinum, and gold and {{there are very few}} rhodium-bearing minerals. It is found in platinum ores and extracted as a white inert metal that is difficult to fuse. Principal sources are located in South Africa; in river sands of the Ural Mountains; and in North America, including the copper-nickel sulfide mining area of the Sudbury, Ontario, region. Although the quantity at Sudbury is very small, <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> processed nickel ore makes rhodium recovery cost-effective.|$|E

Oakwood is home to thousands of individual statues and sculptures as well as 24 private mausolea. Because of its popularity as a public park, many memorials included benches to invite visitors to rest while investigating the large, hilly property.|$|E
5|$|Thin {{sectioning}} was {{an early}} procedure used to analyse fossilised material contained in coal balls. The process required cutting a coal ball with a diamond saw, then flattening and polishing the thin section with an abrasive. It would be glued to a slide and placed under a petrographic microscope for examination. Although the process could be done with a machine, <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> time needed and the poor quality of samples produced by thin sectioning {{gave way to a}} more convenient method.|$|E

5|$|Another {{major benefit}} of the tunnel will be the redirecting of <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> {{vehicles}} (nearly 16,000 daily; 2009 estimate), many of them container trucks and cruise buses, that cross Biscayne Boulevard (US 1) at NW 5th Street (Port Boulevard), using level streets, such as Northeast 1st Avenue, which for years were {{the only way to}} access the port. Along with the capacity of the port, the amount of truck traffic could double after the completion of the numerous port projects. Additionally, the Port Boulevard entrance to the port is closed at night, concentrating all truck traffic during the day. This traffic creates congestion and presents a danger to pedestrians and bicyclists. Traffic is also considered to be a harm to Miami's northern central business district, reducing its ability to grow, including the new arts and entertainment (Omni) district, valued at over $12 billion.|$|E
5|$|Comparing {{the driver}} energy input to the fusion energy output {{produces}} a number known as fusion energy gain factor, labelled Q. A Q value {{of at least}} 1 {{is required for the}} system to produce net energy. Since some energy is needed to run the reactor, in order for there to be net electrical output, Q has to be at least 3. For commercial operation, Q values much higher than this are needed. For ICF, Qs on the order of 25 to 50 are needed to recoup both the electrical generation losses and <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> power used to power the driver. In the fall of 1960, theoretical work carried out at LLNL suggested that gains of the required order would be possible with drivers on the order of 1MJ.|$|E
5|$|Construction began before {{completion}} of the design for the gaseous diffusion process. Due to <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> electric power that the K-25 plant was expected to consume, {{it was decided to}} provide it with its own electric power plant. While the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) believed that it could supply the Clinton Engineer Works' needs, there was unease about relying on a single supplier when a power failure could cost the gaseous diffusion plant weeks of work, and the lines to TVA could be sabotaged. A local plant was more secure. The Kellex engineers were also attracted to the idea of being able to generate the variable frequency current required by the gaseous diffusion process without complicated transformers.|$|E

40|$|There is no {{evidence}} in the literature that methemoglobin is accumulative in man from repeated administrations of acetanilide (1) or acetophenetidine in ordinary therapeutic doses. The possibility exists, however, that if <b>the</b> dose is <b>large</b> a progressive rise may occur. The possibility likewise exists that methe-moglobin may be converted to the more stable sulfhemoglobin and that this pigment may accumulate. Smith (2) gave monkeys acetanilide in daily doses of 1 millimol per kg. for 95 days and <b>the</b> <b>largest</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> methemoglobin found was 0. 6 gram. When the daily dose was increased to 4 millimols per kg. and continued for 104 days, <b>the</b> <b>largest</b> <b>amounts</b> <b>of</b> methemoglobin and sulfhemoglobin found were respectively 1. 0 and 0. 4 gram; the amounts fell during the last 30 to 40 days of the experiment.

5|$|Dinheirosaurus {{is one of}} {{relatively}} few sauropods for which gastroliths were found obviously alongside the type specimen. In 2007, an experiment using Dinheirosaurus, Diplodocus (=Seismosaurus), and Cedarosaurus tested if sauropods used their gastroliths in an avian-style gastric mill. The analysis took into account that {{among the hundreds of}} sauropods found, gastroliths are only known from a few associated specimens. Authors chose to use the three sauropods with the most associated gastroliths, Dinheirosaurus, Diplodocus, and Cedarosaurus, because of <b>the</b> <b>large</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> gastroliths found in birds. When birds were typically found to have 1.05% of their body weight gastroliths, the sauropod Diplodocus, which had the highest amount of gastroliths, only amassed to 0.03% body weight. This means that since the other sauropods Dinheirosaurus and Cedarosaurus had less gastroliths to body mass, an avian-style gastric mill is unlikely to have evolved in sauropods, and they instead might have used gastroliths to absorb minerals.|$|E

5|$|In 1802, {{shortly after}} {{discovering}} Pallas, Olbers suggested to Herschel that Ceres and Pallas were fragments {{of a much}} larger planet that once occupied the Mars–Jupiter region, this planet having suffered an internal explosion or a cometary impact many million years before. Over time, however, this hypothesis has fallen from favor. <b>The</b> <b>large</b> <b>amount</b> <b>of</b> energy required to destroy a planet, combined with the belt's low combined mass, which is only about 4% of the mass of the Moon, do not support the hypothesis. Further, the significant chemical differences between the asteroids become difficult to explain if they come from the same planet. Today, most scientists accept that, rather than fragmenting from a progenitor planet, the asteroids never formed a planet at all.|$|E
