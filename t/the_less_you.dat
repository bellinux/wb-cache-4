25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Less</b> <b>You</b> Know, the Better is {{the fourth}} studio album by the American hip hop {{musician}} DJ Shadow, released on October 4, 2011 by Island Records. Like Shadow's previous efforts, the album's music relies extensively on sampling, and the samples used span many genres and time periods. The album sees Shadow exploring many genres and production styles, from fast-paced tracks prominently featuring guitars and scratching to slow tracks featuring pianos.|$|E
25|$|On May 10, 2011, DJ Shadow {{confirmed}} via his Facebook {{page that}} the album {{would be released}} in September. The same day, he also released an EP called I Gotta Rokk, which contained remixes of material from the album. This {{was followed by the}} release of another EP, I'm Excited, on July 29, 2011. However, copyright problems caused the withdrawal of the EP and delays on the release of <b>The</b> <b>Less</b> <b>You</b> Know, the Better.|$|E
500|$|Clemmons {{was arrested}} on July 1, 2009, after he {{appeared}} in a Pierce County court trying to have his bench warrant thrown out. He was charged with second-degree rape of a child, {{as well as being}} a fugitive from Arkansas. At the time of his arrest, Clemmons made religiously themed comments and referred to himself as [...] "the beast". He also told a police officer that President Barack Obama and LeBron James were his brothers, and Oprah Winfrey was his sister. Pierce County prosecutors asserted that Clemmons' recent crimes amounted to a violation of Clemmons' parole in Arkansas, and that he faced years in prison if he was returned to the state. However, the Arkansas Department of Community Correction notified Pierce County on July 22 that they did not intend to ask for his extradition and that he should be adjudicated on his Washington charges. Stephen Penner, a deputy prosecuting attorney in Pierce County, said of the Arkansas decision, [...] "There's a built-in incentive to not following through. In a way, the more violent they are, <b>the</b> <b>less</b> <b>you</b> want them in your community." ...|$|E
2500|$|Some {{also use}} an {{explanation}} of Gresham's Law as [...] "The more efficient <b>you</b> become, <b>the</b> <b>less</b> effective <b>you</b> get"; i.e. [...] "when you try {{to go on the}} cheap, you will stop selling" [...] or [...] "the <b>less</b> <b>you</b> invest in your non-tangible services, the fewer sales you will get." ...|$|R

500|$|... “Grunge...became an anti-consumerist {{movement}} where <b>the</b> <b>less</b> <b>you</b> {{spent on}} clothes, the more ‘coolness’ you had.” The style did not evolve {{out of a}} conscious attempt to create an appealing fashion; music journalist Charles R. Cross said, [...] " [...] Kurt Cobain was just too lazy to shampoo", and Sub Pop's Jonathan Poneman said, [...] "This [...] is cheap, it's durable, and it's kind of timeless. It also runs {{against the grain of}} the whole flashy aesthetic that existed in the 80s." [...] The flannel and [...] "...cracked leatherette coats" [...] in the grunge scene were part [...] "...of the Pacific Northwest's thrift-shop esthetic. [...] Grunge fashion was very much an anti-fashion response and a non-conformist move against the “manufactured image”, often pushing musicians to dress in authentic ways and to not glamorize themselves. At the same time, Sub-Pop utilized the ‘grunge look’ in their marketing of their bands. In an interview with VH1, photographer Charles Peterson commented that members from grunge band Tad “were given blue collar identities that weren’t entirely earned. Bruce (Pavitt) really got him to dress up in flannel and a real chain saw and really play up this image of a mountain man and it worked.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Shadow has {{connected}} many themes {{to various}} aspects of the album. Speaking about the album's title, <b>The</b> <b>Less</b> <b>You</b> Know, the Better, Shadow explained: ...|$|E
2500|$|At Metacritic, which assigns a {{normalised}} rating out of 100 to {{reviews from}} mainstream critics, <b>The</b> <b>Less</b> <b>You</b> Know, the Better received an average score of 62, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews", based on 25 reviews. Andrew Perry of The Daily Telegraph wrote positively of the album, stating that it upholds the [...] "pioneering spirit" [...] of Shadow's debut release Endtroducing..... by [...] "regularly straying from the constrictions of classic hip hop." [...] John Bush of AllMusic cited <b>The</b> <b>Less</b> <b>You</b> Know, the Better as [...] "one {{of the most}} entertaining albums of the year, with countless moments of brilliance" [...] and wrote that it [...] "sounds closer to his classic Endtroducing..... {{than any of his}} others, as though Shadow's finally willing to embrace his career landmark instead of constantly play against type." [...] Writing for Rolling Stone, Will Hermes wrote that while the album [...] "may lack his debut's soul-jazz seamlessness, it compensates with bipolar freakiness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Granting {{all that}} you say is so," [...] she said, [...] "nevertheless {{it does not make}} house-breaking any <b>the</b> <b>less</b> house-breaking. <b>You</b> couldn't make such a defense in a court of law." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{board at}} the bow, Mr. Glover, I will make for her quarter. Now, lay out, lads, {{as hard as you}} can, the sooner <b>you</b> are there <b>the</b> <b>less</b> chance <b>you</b> have of being hit." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{taken my}} fun where I've found it, [...] And now I {{must pay for}} my fun, [...] For the more you 'ave known o' the others, [...] <b>The</b> <b>less</b> will <b>you</b> settle to one----" ...|$|R
2500|$|While criticizing <b>The</b> <b>Less</b> <b>You</b> Know, the Better {{for what}} he felt {{was a lack of}} a {{coherent}} mood, describing it as [...] "a highly schizophrenic collection", J.R. Moores of Drowned in Sound ultimately praised it as an improvement over The Outsider and [...] "a step in the right direction." [...] BBC Music writer Ian Wade acknowledged that while the album [...] "will only ever stand in the vast shadow that its creator has cast since releasing the unprecedented Endtroducing, <b>The</b> <b>Less</b> <b>You</b> Know, the Better isn't a bad album at all, and will likely grow into something far more impressive, something that isn't quite evident on first play. Like The Private Press, it could be one the listener returns to down the line and wonders how it didn't initially click." [...] Sam Richards of NME, however, felt that the album sounded [...] "like the work of a man struggling to recall his motivations for making music in the first place." ...|$|E
2500|$|The second single from <b>The</b> <b>Less</b> <b>You</b> Know, the Better, [...] "I Gotta Rokk", was {{released}} on May 17, 2011 as a digital EP featuring the title track and remixes of tracks from the album. Nate Patrin of Pitchfork wrote that the EP's tracks [...] "suggest a new direction more {{along the lines of}} what people expected from [...] 10 years ago" [...] and graded the release 7.0/10. It was later featured on the Super Bowl XLIX TV spot for the 2015 film Terminator Genisys. [...] "I'm Excited", featuring Afrikan Boy, was premiered on DJ Zane Lowe's BBC Radio 1 program on July 7, 2011 and was intended to be the follow-up single in promotion of the album. However, the release of an accompanying EP was shelved due to issues involving an uncleared sample on its title track, which was ultimately excluded from the final track listing of <b>The</b> <b>Less</b> <b>You</b> Know, the Better. The music video for [...] "I'm Excited", directed by Ian Pons Jewell, {{was released}} on August 24, 2011.|$|E
2500|$|Lastly, Shakespeare {{finishes}} the sonnet (as expected) with a couplet: two consecutive rhyming lines. Each line contains ten syllables, {{and the second}} line is composed only of one-syllable words. Some scholars attribute the monosyllable closing line of the poem {{as a tribute to}} 16th century poet, George Gascoigne. Gascoigne is quoted as saying, [...] "The more monosyllables that you use, the truer Englishman you shall seemed, and <b>the</b> <b>less</b> <b>you</b> shall smell of the Inkhorn".|$|E
40|$|There {{are many}} {{benefits}} to having more natural light in your home. The most obvious {{of these are}} the savings you can achieve with a reduced utility bill. According to the U. S. Department of Energy (2012), about 10 % of household electricity usage comes from lighting. The more natural light {{you have in your}} house, <b>the</b> <b>less</b> lights <b>you</b> have to turn on, and <b>the</b> <b>less</b> electricity <b>you</b> use. Another benefit, also related to energy use, is natural light can help heat homes. One of the best reasons to design your home for natural light involves the health benefits gained through exposure to natural light...|$|R

2500|$|The Guardians Dave Simpson {{described}} the album as [...] "a hit-and-miss affair", while Spins Rob Harvilla similarly characterized it as [...] "equal parts frustrating and admirable", though also [...] "nowhere near as antagonistic as 2006's hyphy-saturated The Outsider". David Amidon of PopMatters wrote that [...] "anyone who picks up <b>The</b> <b>Less</b> <b>You</b> Know {{has a right}} to be disappointed, especially considering the name of the artist on the spine." [...] However, he nonetheless {{described the}} album as a [...] "perfectly enjoyable listen" [...] in spite of its shortcomings and a [...] "return to form for Shadow, his best work since Private Press, and, most importantly, fun to listen to." [...] Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune gave most praise to the album's [...] "dark, shape-shifting mood pieces".|$|E
2500|$|I {{put myself}} in the (Those who fear {{expansion}} of Government control) group, and do not {{hide the fact that}} I have a clear bias on Anthropogenic global warming (AGW). [...] My bias is based on fear of Government expansion and the observation of AGW data presentation fraud – not based on financial or any other personal benefit. [...] I merely have found that the closer you look at the data and alarmists’ [...] presentations, the more fraud you find and <b>the</b> <b>less</b> <b>you</b> think there is an AGW problem... For decades, as a professional experimental test engineer, I have analyzed experimental data and watched others massage and present data. [...] I became a cynic; My conclusion – “if someone is aggressively selling a technical product whose merits are dependent on complex experimental data, he is likely lying”. [...] That is true whether the product is an airplane or a Carbon Credit.|$|E
2500|$|Fitzroy Maclean {{discussed}} Yugoslavia with Churchill in Cairo {{after the}} Tehran Conference. Maclean reported that [...] "…the Partisans, whether we helped them or not, {{would be the}} decisive political factor in Jugoslavia after the war and, secondly that Tito and the other leaders of the movement were openly and avowedly Communist and that the system which they would establish would inevitably be on Soviet lines and, in all probability, strongly oriented towards the Soviet Union." [...] Churchill said that as neither of them intended to live there after the war: [...] "… <b>the</b> <b>less</b> <b>you</b> and I worry about the form of Government they set up, the better. That {{is for them to}} decide. What interests us is, which of them is doing most harm to the Germans." [...] However, Maclean had also noticed Tito's [...] "independence of mind" [...] and wondered whether Tito might evolve into something more than a Soviet puppet.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{is it not}} his especial {{business}} to teach the right use of them to <b>the</b> <b>less</b> educated?-unless <b>you</b> agree with the old Sophists, {{that the purpose of}} education is to enable us to deceive or coerce the uneducated for our own aggrandisement." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Thou art ever prudent," [...] {{said the}} King, [...] "but surely your toil is <b>the</b> <b>less</b> when <b>you</b> have so few men to command?--and {{a time of}} festivity {{requires}} not so severe self denial on your part as a time of danger." ...|$|R

2500|$|In {{one popular}} {{interpretation}} of stage theory, {{each of the}} so-called levels of existence envelops those below it: an ethical person is still capable of aesthetic enjoyment, for example, and a religious person is still capable of aesthetic enjoyment and ethical duty. The difference between these ways of living are internal, not external, and thus there are no external signs one can point to determine at what level a person is living. This inner and outer relationship is commonly determined by an individual by looking to others to gauge one's action, Kierkegaard believed one should look to oneself and in that relationship look to Christ as the example instead of looking at others because the more you look at others <b>the</b> <b>less</b> <b>you</b> see of yourself. This {{makes it easier to}} degrade your neighbor instead of loving your neighbor. But one must love the person one sees not the person one wishes to see. Either love the person you see as that person is the person he is or stop talking about loving everyone.|$|E

[...] "Your {{mathematics}} {{seem to me}} very like a bottle of mixed pickles the more you fish for what <b>you</b> want <b>the</b> <b>less</b> chance <b>you</b> have of getting it. I am certain that if the thing can be accomplished at all, {{it is in a}} very simple manner." ...|$|R
