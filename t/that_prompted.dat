5|$|The {{cattle egret}} {{is a popular}} bird with cattle ranchers for its {{perceived}} role as a biocontrol of cattle parasites such as ticks and flies. A study in Australia found that cattle egrets {{reduced the number of}} flies that bothered cattle by pecking them directly off the skin. It was the benefit to stock <b>that</b> <b>prompted</b> ranchers and the Hawaiian Board of Agriculture and Forestry to release the species in Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|Bianchi was {{transported to}} {{hospital}} with severe head injuries, and {{was moved to}} his native France in November. He remained there until his death more than nine months later on 17 July 2015, when he was mourned by the motor sport community. Bianchi's accident prompted Formula One's governing body, the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), to investigate the incident with a ten-person panel {{in which it was}} determined there was no single cause <b>that</b> <b>prompted</b> the crash. The victory allowed Hamilton to increase his lead in the World Drivers' Championship to ten points over Rosberg, who was 63 points in front of Daniel Ricciardo. Mercedes extended their advantage over Red Bull in the Constructors' Championship, and Williams remained ahead of Ferrari in the battle for third place with four races left in the season.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Forrest, also {{referred}} to as Typhoon Forrest, was a powerful tropical cyclone <b>that</b> <b>prompted</b> the evacuation of 600,000people in Bangladesh in late November1992. Originating from an area of disturbed weather near the Caroline Islands on November9, Forrest was classified as a tropical depression three days later over the South China Sea. Tracking generally west, the system steadily organized into a tropical storm, passing Vietnam to the south, before striking Thailand along the Malay Peninsula on November15. Once over the Bay of Bengal, Forrest turned northward on November17 and significantly intensified. It reached its peak intensity on November20 as a Category4-equivalent cyclone on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale with winds of 230km/h (145mph). Hostile environmental conditions soon affected the cyclone as it turned abruptly east-northeastward. Forrest made landfall in northwestern Myanmar as a weakening system on November21 before dissipating early the next day.|$|E

5|$|During {{the reign}} of the Safavid dynasty in the 15th century, the monasteries were preserved. The monasteries were then deserted during the 16th and 17th centuries {{following}} a period of attacks by the Ottomans <b>that</b> <b>prompted</b> many Armenians to emigrate to central Iran. Once the Safavids reestablished themselves in the area, the monasteries were reoccupied and renovated. However, during the 18th century the area became a cauldron of conflicts for domination among the Russian, Ottoman, and Persian empires. When the Persians finally gained control, the monasteries were damaged. During the Qajar era, Armenians regained control over the monasteries and they were rebuilt. The existing St. Thaddeus Monastery was rebuilt in 1814 and refurbished in the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Dean Hall {{produced}} a massively popular mod for ARMA 2 <b>that</b> <b>prompted</b> {{the studio to}} develop a standalone game. The same year saw the arrest of two employees of Bohemia, who were charged with espionage by Greece and jailed for 129 days. This event had significantly lowered team morale and forced the team to rename the ARMA 3s setting to a fictional one. The company is now working on several new projects, including preparing DayZ for an eventual full release and developing Ylands, a sandbox game {{which was part of}} Bohemia Incubator, a platform for Bohemia Interactive to release small, experimental projects.|$|E
5|$|It {{was partly}} {{down to the}} legend of the witch <b>that</b> <b>prompted</b> TV's Most Haunted team to visit Wookey Hole Caves and Mill to explore the {{location}} in depth, searching for evidence of paranormal activity. The show, which aired on 10 March 2009, was the last episode transmitted in series 11 of the show's run on the satellite and cable TV channel Living. In 2009 a new actor to play the 'witch' was chosen by Wookey Hole Ltd amid much media interest. Carole Bohanan in the role of Carla Calamity was selected ahead of over 3,000 other applicants.|$|E
40|$|The instabilities {{that are}} {{believed}} {{to play an important}} role in the supernova mechanism are reviewed. We then investigate the dynamics of two of these instabilities, prompt convection and neutron fingers, and its consequences for the supernova outcome. We find <b>that</b> <b>prompt</b> convection occurs immediately after shock propagation and is primarily entropy driven. A number of detailed one-dimensional spherically symmetric simulations of prompt convection are performed using a mixing length algorithm in a code coupling the core hydrodynamics with multigroup flux-limited diffusion of neutrinos of all types. We find <b>that</b> <b>prompt</b> convection does not have a significant effect on the neutrino luminosities or spectra and, furthermore, that the core is not amenable to shock revival at this time. Consequently, we do not find <b>that</b> <b>prompt</b> convection is important for the supernova mechanism.

5|$|Long epic poetry was not {{a popular}} genre in North Korea before Mt. Paektu, {{but it was in}} the Soviet Union where Cho had immigrated from. Poema and Mayakovsky's prosody and poetry were also among Cho's {{influences}} that can be seen in Mt. Paektu. These Russian stylistic influences gave Mt. Paektu its peculiar characteristics <b>that</b> <b>prompted</b> mixed reactions from the North Korean public. For instance, some in the literature circles were unfamiliar with the concept of a lyrical epic and thought of it as an improbable amalgam of genres, criticizing the work for being indistinguishable from ordinary prose. According to North Korean studies scholar Alzo David-West, the relatively favorable reaction to Mt. Paektu compared to some other literature testifies to North Korean readership being capable at being both a receptive and a dismissive audience.|$|E
5|$|Severe hurricanes in 1926 and 1928 caused catastrophic {{damage and}} {{flooding}} from Lake Okeechobee <b>that</b> <b>prompted</b> the Army Corps of Engineers {{to build a}} dike around the lake. Further floods in 1947 prompted an unprecedented construction of canals throughout southern Florida. Following another population boom after World War II, {{and the creation of}} the Central and Southern Florida Flood Control Project, the Everglades was divided into sections separated by canals and water control devices that delivered water to agricultural and newly developed urban areas. However, in the late 1960s, following a proposal to construct a massive airport next to Everglades National Park, national attention turned from developing the land to restoring the Everglades.|$|E
5|$|Starting in the mid-1940s, Carson {{had become}} {{concerned}} {{about the use of}} synthetic pesticides, many of which had been developed through the military funding of science since World War II. It was the US federal government's 1957 gypsy moth eradication program, however, <b>that</b> <b>prompted</b> Carson to devote her research, and her next book, to pesticides and environmental poisons. The gypsy moth program involved aerial spraying of DDT and other pesticides (mixed with fuel oil), including the spraying of private land. Landowners on Long Island filed a suit to have the spraying stopped, and many in affected regions followed the case closely. Though the suit was lost, the Supreme Court granted petitioners the right to gain injunctions against potential environmental damage in the future; this laid the basis for later successful environmental actions.|$|E

5|$|The NTSB report {{showed that}} the plane had several {{instances}} of maintenance work related to cabin pressure {{in the months leading}} up to the accident. The NTSB was unable to determine whether they stemmed from a common problem – replacements and repairs were documented, but not the pilot discrepancy reports <b>that</b> <b>prompted</b> them or the frequency of such reports. The report criticised Sunjet Aviation for the possibility that this would have made the problem harder to identify, track, and resolve; as well as the fact that in at least one instance the plane was flown with an unauthorized maintenance deferral for cabin pressure problems.|$|E
5|$|The third (and final) {{practice}} session {{started with a}} morning sleet shower and Anthony Davidson in Toyota's No. 5 entry drove off the circuit at Luffield turn. Davidson later aquaplaned backwards off the track and into the Chapel corner gravel trap. The session was stopped to allow the stricken Toyota to be extracted from the gravel trap and and {{it was able to}} return to the pit lane with assistance from a recovery crane, allowing on-track action to recommence. Sleet later turned to snow necessitating track officials to stop the session for the second time. Driver adviser Yannick Dalmas was asked to assess the track's condition during the stoppage and gave feedback <b>that</b> <b>prompted</b> the session's premature end with half an hour remaining. Eleven cars took to the track but nobody recorded a timed lap. Tincknell completed the most out-laps of any driver in the session with three.|$|E
5|$|The {{tropical}} wave {{from which}} Alex developed produced rainfall across the Greater Antilles {{in the central}} Caribbean Sea. In the Dominican Republic, the rainfall triggered flooding <b>that</b> <b>prompted</b> the evacuations of over 3,000people, mostly due to swollen rivers. In {{the capital city of}} Santo Domingo, 160houses were flooded, and one person was killed by the storm; one additional person was reported missing. In nearby San Juan de la Maguana, more than 500homes were inundated. In neighboring Haiti, minor flooding was reported in Gonaïves. The Jamaica Meteorological Service issued a flash flood warning for its entire island in response to the tropical wave producing thunderstorms across the nation.|$|E

40|$|Narratives <b>that</b> <b>prompt</b> inferences {{can be more}} {{interesting}} in that they provide the reader {{with the opportunity to}} reason about the narrative world, participating in its construction. These narratives can also be more concise and direct, as details can be filled in by the reader. On the other hand, narratives that leave out important information without the opportunity to infer this information may be incoherent. To generate narratives <b>that</b> <b>prompt</b> inferences a system must 1) employ a theory of how inferences are prompted and 2) provide a capacity for creating narratives that satisfy inference goals. This paper presents is a novel algorithm for generating discourse plans <b>that</b> <b>prompt</b> inferences according to a theory of online inferencing in narrative discourse. Though other approaches have generated narrative and discourse structures to influence the reader’s perception of the narrative, this is the first approach to present an empirically based cognitive model of online inference generation.

5|$|Washbrook {{reached his}} century with the score on 189/1; he reached triple figures {{half an hour}} after tea, having batted for 230 minutes and 16 boundaries. Washbrook avoided cross-batted shots and solidly defended shorter balls from the back foot, and profited from many over-pitched balls, which he drove away for boundaries. It was a welcome return to form for the opener from Lancashire. He had scored six, one, eight, 37 and 11 in his first five innings of the series, and was dropped on 21 in the second innings of the Third Test before {{proceeding}} to an unbeaten 85. After reaching his century, Washbrook began to play more expansively, driving in a manner <b>that</b> <b>prompted</b> Arlott to compare him to Frank Woolley.|$|E
5|$|When the Five Nations resumed {{with the}} re-admission of France in 1947 after the Second World War, England shared the {{championship}} with Wales. The early Five Nations competitions of the 1950s were unsuccessful for England, winning one match in the 1950 and 1951 championships. England won the 1953 Five Nations, and followed this {{up with a}} Grand Slam in 1957, and win in 1958. England broke France's four-championship streak by winning the 1963 Championship. After this victory, England played three Tests in the Southern Hemisphere and lost all three: 21–11 and 9–6 against the All Blacks, and 18–9 against Australia. England did not win a single match in 1966, and managed only a draw with Ireland. They did not win another Championship that decade; a fact <b>that</b> <b>prompted</b> amateur historian F. W. P. Syms to declare this period 'the sorriest in English Rugby Union History'.|$|E
5|$|Two {{pursuing}} royalist armies harried MacGregor constantly as {{he retreated}} across country, {{but failed to}} break his rearguard. With no carts and {{only a handful of}} horses, the Scotsman was forced to leave his wounded where they fell. Late on 27 July MacGregor's way east was obstructed by a royalist force at Chaguaramas, south of Caracas and {{about a third of the}} distance to Barcelona. MacGregor led his men in a furious charge <b>that</b> <b>prompted</b> a Spanish retreat back into Chaguaramas, then continued towards Barcelona. The Spanish remained in the town until 30 July, giving MacGregor two days' head start, and caught up with him only on 10 August. The Scotsman deployed his 1,200 men, mostly native archers, behind a marsh and a stream—the Spanish cavalry were bogged down in the marsh, while the archers repelled the infantry with volleys of arrows. After three hours MacGregor charged and routed the royalists. MacGregor's party was helped the rest of the way east to Barcelona by elements of the main revolutionary army. They arrived on 20 August 1816, after 34 days' march.|$|E
