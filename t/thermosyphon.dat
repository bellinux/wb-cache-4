25|$|It {{was already}} {{recognised}} that a water-tube boiler {{relied on a}} continuous flow through the water-tubes, and that this must be by a <b>thermosyphon</b> effect rather than requiring an impractical pump. Forced-circulation boilers with pumps, such as the Velox, would not appear for another thirty years and even then they would be initially unreliable. The assumption was that flow through the water-tubes would be upwards, owing to their heating by the furnace, and that the counterbalancing downward flow would require external unheated downcomers.|$|E
2500|$|The new {{generation}} of [...] "small-tube" [...] water-tube boilers used water-tubes of around [...] diameter, compared to older designs of 3 or 4inches. This gave a greater ratio of tube surface heating area to the tube volume, thus more rapid steaming. These small-tube boilers also became known as [...] "express" [...] boilers. Although {{not all of these}} were three-drum designs (notably the Thornycroft), most were some variation of this. As the tubes of the three-drum are close to vertical (compared to the Babcock & Wilcox), this encourages strong circulation by the <b>thermosyphon</b> effect, further encouraging steaming.|$|E

2500|$|To {{provide a}} lighter boiler for smaller vessels, the [...] 'Express' [...] types were developed. These used smaller water-tubes of around 2" [...] diameter, giving a greater ratio of heating area to volume (and weight). Most {{of these were}} of the three-drum pattern, {{particularly}} of the Du Temple and Normand designs. This gave a more vertical arrangement of the water-tubes, thus encouraging <b>thermosyphon</b> circulation in these narrow tubes. The previous problems of tube expansion were still a theoretical concern and so the tubes were either curved, or even convoluted into hairpins and S shapes, so as to increase heating area. In practice these shapes gave rise to two more practical problems: difficulty in cleaning the tubes and also difficulty in forming a reliable joint into the water drums, particularly where tubes entered the drum {{at a variety of}} angles.|$|E
50|$|Depending on {{application}} {{there are several}} <b>thermosyphon</b> designs: thermoprobe, thermopile, depth <b>thermosyphon,</b> sloped-thermosyphon foundation, flat loop <b>thermosyphon</b> foundation, hybrid flat loop <b>thermosyphon</b> foundation.|$|E

50|$|Heat traps {{are very}} simple and inexpensive. They are an {{effective}} way to prevent cooling of hot water in water heaters by <b>thermosyphoning</b> the hot water to a higher elevated portion of the piping system. <b>Thermosyphoning</b> is based on natural convection.

Significant change of vapor flow regimes was shown based on theoretical investigation of vapor flow hydraulic characteristics in miniature heat pipes at commensurate capillary structure thickness and vapor space diameter. It was shown that transition from laminar to turbulent flow regime occurs at reduced Reynolds number. Influence of layer displacement thickness, vapor space diameter and capillary structure thickness on heat transfer in heating zone of miniature heat pipes was determined. New data on hydraulic characteristics of processes which take place at period of heat transfer between heating and condensation zones were obtained as a result of visualization investigations of <b>thermosyphons</b> and pulsating heat pipes with different heat carriers (common heat carriers and nanofluids). Provided life tests of miniature <b>thermosyphons</b> and heat pipes were shown the ability of these devices to work in difficult temperature conditions. New dependencies between heat transfer coefficients in heat transfer zones and heat flux were obtained as a result of heat transfer characteristics of miniature heat pipes, <b>thermosyphons</b> and pulsating heat pipes researches. Criterial relations for evaluation of heat transfer intensity in heating zones of miniature heat pipes and <b>thermosyphons</b> were determined.

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 The low {{temperature}} geothermal resource at Klamath Falls, Oregon {{is widely used}} for heating buildings. A common technique for using this resource consists of a heat exchanger down in the well inside a casing which extends {{the full length of}} the well. Slots are cut in the casing to allow circulation of the geothermal water into the casing and past the downhole heat exchanger. This results in <b>thermosyphoning</b> between the inside and outside of the casing. Mathematical models of <b>thermosyphoning</b> through the well casing were developed for both with and without downhole heat exchanger present. Results of the model without heat exchanger present showed that <b>thermosyphoning</b> is sufficient to account for observed flow rates through the casing. Model results with heat exchanger included show the substantial influence of <b>thermosyphoning</b> on heat transfer rates and indicate several promising approaches to maximizing output. Because of the importance of scaling and corrosion on the success of a downhole heat exchanger installation, a study of available literature on scaling and corrosion relevant to downhole heat exchangers in {{low temperature}} geothermal systems was made and recommendations for corrosion control were developed. Scaling was not deemed severe enough to justify available control measures...|$|R

50|$|The {{significant}} {{feature of}} a <b>thermosyphon</b> {{is that it}} is passive and does not require any external power to operate.

The liquid ammonia {{at the bottom of the}} <b>thermosyphon</b> is vaporized by heat absorbed from the ground, cooling the surrounding permafrost and lowering its temperature. During the summer, the thermosyphons stop operating, since there is no liquid ammonia available at the top of the heat pipe, but the extreme cooling during the winter allows the ground to remain frozen.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims at {{assessing}} {{the performance of}} a waste heat-to-power plant by means of an ORC (Organic Rankine Cycle) system coupled with two-phase closed <b>thermosyphons</b> (or gravity-assisted heat pipes or wickless heat pipes). The heat exchanger, made up of two-phase closed <b>thermosyphons,</b> is used for conveying heat from exhaust stream to ORC working fluid. In reality, a hot oil loop or a pressurized hot water loop or a saturated ste am loop or even a direct evaporator is often used to transfer heat from the heat source to the ORC system. However, installing a heat exchanger directly in the hot gas paths of ORC system evokes the concerns for the flammability and/or toxicity of organic working fluids especially when the heat source has a relatively high temperature. Also the use of an intermediate heat carrier loop such as thermal oil or saturated steam or pressurized water loop is costly and involves installation of comparatively heavy components. In principle, the use of two-phase closed <b>thermosyphons</b> for capturing and transporting heat from a waste heat source to organic working fluid is less expensive than utilizing an intermediate heat transfer loop and eliminates safety issues {{as in the case of}} direct installation of an ORC evaporator in the hot gas paths.

40|$|The {{heat pipe}} is an {{engineering}} device capable of transporting {{large amounts of}} heat energy. Because a heat pipe is a closed system, contains no moving mechanical components and transports heat over very small temperature gradients, it presents an attractive alternative to conventional forced-convection cooling techniques. Over the past 4 decades, the principles of heat pipe operation have been thoroughly investigated. Heat pipes have been implemented {{in a wide variety}} of engineering applications. Despite this, heat pipes have not been used on a large scale in metallurgical applications. In this regard, an enormous potential for improved efficiency and productivity remains unexploited. Heat pipe research at the McGill Metals Processing Centre has aimed to correct this. Various metallurgical applications for heat pipe technology have been explored by Mucciardi, Botos, Choi, Jin and Meratian. The research effort has concentrated on gas-loaded annular <b>thermosyphons,</b> a subclass of heat pipes. The work presented in this volume represents the author's contribution to this larger research effort. A series of experiments has been performed in order to investigate important aspects of the operation of gas-loaded <b>thermosyphons.</b> Results from these experiments were subsequently incorporated into a PC-based computer model for the design and analysis of annular <b>thermosyphons...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The T engine's {{cooling system}} {{reflected}} the T's simplicity design theme. The first few hundred Model Ts had a water pump, {{but it was}} eliminated early in production. Instead, Ford opted for a cheaper and more reliable <b>thermosyphon</b> system. <b>Thermosyphon</b> was a common engine-cooling method of the era. Hot water, being less dense, would {{rise to the top}} of the engine and up in{{to the top of the}} radiator, descending to the bottom as it cooled, and back into the engine. (This was the direction of water flow in most cars which did have water pumps, until the introduction of crossflow radiator designs.) The thermosiphon system was susceptible to overheating if worked heavily, but served well for most Model T usage.|$|E
40|$|Limited energy {{resources}} require innovative technologies to save, transfer, and store thermal energy. Nanofluids – suspensions with nanoparticles of size 20 nm to 200 nm – {{might be one}} such technology.

30|$|Of {{the various}} {{applications}} proposed, {{the use of}} nanofluids in closed circulation loops for sensible heat removal {{is found to be}} the most attractive, and these can become part of steady-state heat exchange systems.

50|$|Large engines {{would use}} <b>thermosyphon</b> cooling. The hopper {{on the engine}} would be {{supplemented}} by a large drum of water above the engine. This would give some circulation between the two, but as there was no large surface area for heat transfer to the air, as with a radiator, the eventual cooling would still largely be by evaporation.|$|E
50|$|Heat {{can still}} be {{transferred}} in this system by the evaporation and condensation of vapor; however, the system is properly classified as a heat pipe <b>thermosyphon.</b> If the system also contains other fluids, such as air, then the heat flux density will be less than in a real heat pipe, which only contains a single fluid.|$|E

A comparison of the experimental results quoted in the open literature is made. It is observed how the various results are very different and in many cases the experimental data disagree with the conventional theory but they also appear to be inconsistent with one another. Various reasons can be identified to account for these differences but by comparing the available experimental data on closed loop two phase <b>thermosyphons,</b> it is evident that further systematic studies are required to generate a meaningful body of knowledge of the heat and mass transport mechanism in such a kind of devices for practical applications...|$|R

Analysis of hydrodynamic and heat transfer processes in miniature evaporation condensation systems was provided and empirical relations for evaluation of the main heat transfer characteristics at cramped conditions were obtained. New constructions of heat transfer devices based on evaporation-condensation cycle for heat rejection from powerful elements of electronics for terrestrial and space applications were proposed. ??????????? ????????? ??????? ?????? ??????-??????????? ???????? ?????????????? ??????????? ? ??????????? ????????????-??????????????? ???????? ?????????? ? ????? ????????? ?? ??????????????? ??????? ? ???????? ??????????? ????????? ??? ???????? ???????: ??????????? ???????? ????, ???????????? ? ??????????? ????????????? ???????? ????. ????????? ??????????? ????????????????? ???????????? ????????? ??????????????? ?? ???????????? ?????? ??????? ? ? ?????????? ????????. ? ????????? ????????? ?????????? ???????? ??????? ???????? ?????????? ????????????? ??????????? ??? ??????? ? ?????????? ???????? ?? ???????????? ?????? ??????? ?? ????????? ? ??????? ???????. ? ??????? ???????????? ???????? ??????? ??????????? ???????? ???????. ????????? ???????? ????????? ?? ??????????? ?????? ??????? ??????????????? ??????? ???????????. ???????? ?????? ??? ????????? ??????? ???????? ???????? ??? ??? ????? ? ???????? ??? ???? ??????????? ?????????? ?? ????????? ??????????? ????????? ? ???????? ??????. ???????? ?????????????? ??????????? ???????? ?????????-???????????????? ????????????? ??????????? ? ??????????? ??????????????? ????????????????. ???????????? ????????? ??????????? ? ??????????? ???????? ??????, ???????????? ? ??????????? ????????????? ???????? ?????? ????????? ?????????? ???????? ???????, ???????? ?? ????????????? ??????????? ??? ??????? ? ??????????? ? ?? ???????????? ???????? ??????. ???????? ???????????? ??????? ?????????? ??????? ?? ??????????????? ??????????? ????? ?????????. ????????? ??????????? ???????????? ????????????? ??????? ? ??????????? ?????????? ???????????? ? ???????? ??????????? ??? ??????? ????????? ? ??????? ????????? ??????????? ? ???? ??????? ? ??????? ????????? ???????? ????????. ??????????? ????????????? ??????????? ?????????? ???????????? ? ???????? ??????? ?? ??????????? ????????, ???????????? ?????????? ? ??????????????? ??????? ??????????????. ???????????? ??????????? ??? ??????? ??????????? ????????????? ??????????? ???????????? ? ??????? ????????? ???????? ????????. ???????????? ??????????? ??? ??????? ????????????? ??????????? ? ????? ??????????? ??????????? ????????????. ????????? ??????????? ??? ??????? ????????????? ???????????????? ???????????? ? ??????????? ?? ???????????? ???????? ???????. ??????? ???????? ???????????????? ? ??????????? ????????????-??????????????? ??????????? ? ??????????? ????????????? ??????? ???? ? ??????? ??????. ???????? ???????? ??????? ???????? ???????? ?????? ? ??????? ??????????? ????????? ? ??????????? ???????? ?????? ?? ??????????? ????? ?????????? ??? ???????? ?? ??????????? ?????? ??????? ? ????????????. ???????? ?????????? ???????????? ???????????? ????????????? ? ??????????? ???????? ???????? ???????????? ? ??????????? ???????? ??????. ???????????? ???????? ?????? ??? ???? ??????????? ?????????. ?? ?????? ??????? ????????????????? ? ????????????? ?????????, ??????????? ? ??????????? ????????????-??????????????? ????????, ???????? ???????????? ??????????? ??? ??????? ???????? ??????????????? ????????????? ? ?????????? ????????. ????????, ??? ????????????? ??????????? ??? ??????? ? ???? ??????? ??????????? ???????? ???? ??????? ?? ???????? ???????? ????????????, ????? ??? ??????? ? ???????????, ?? ??????? ??????????? ?????????, ??????????, ?????????? ? ???????????? ? ??????????????? ??????? ?????????????. ???????? ???????????, ??????????? ?????????? ???????????? ???????? ????? ??????????? ???????? ???? ? ?????? ????????? ??????????????? ????????????? ? ??????? ?????? ??? ????? ??????? ??????? ????. ??????????? ?????? ????????????????? ?????? ???????? ??????? ????? ??????????? ??????????????? ????????? ?? ?????? ????????????-???????????????? ????? ??? ?????? ??????? ?? ?????? ????????? ??????????? ??????? ??? ?????????, ??? ? ???????????? ?????????????...|$|R
