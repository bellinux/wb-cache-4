40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the experimental precision of different methods of statistical analysis for trials with large numbers of soybean genotypes, and their relationship with the number of replicates. Soybean yield data (nine trials; 324 genotypes; 46 cultivars; 278 lines; agricultural harvest of 2014 / 15) were used. Two of these trials were performed at the same location, side by side, forming a trial with six replicates. Each trial was analyzed by the randomized complete block, <b>triple</b> <b>lattice</b> design, and use of the Papadakis method. The selective accuracy, least significant difference, and Fasoulas differentiation index were estimated, and model assumptions were tested. The resampling method was used to study the influence of the number of replicates, by varying the number of blocks and estimating the precision measurements. The experimental precision indicators of the Papadakis method are more favorable as compared to the randomized complete block design and <b>triple</b> <b>lattice.</b> To obtain selective accuracy above the high experimental precision range in trials with 324 soybean genotypes, two repetitions can be used, and data can be analyzed using the randomized complete block design or Papadakis method...|$|E

For the <b>triple</b> <b>lattice</b> designs at Iowa State College, three replications were on the average somewhat more accurate than five replications of the type of randomized blocks design previously used. Since part of this increase in accuracy was presumably due to the long and narrow shape of replication in the randomized blocks designs, somewhat smaller increases would be expected over a randomized blocks design with a more compact replication.

Half of the collected barely landraces were six-row type that dominated in Ajlun area (favorable environments) and the remaining landraces were two-row type that dominated in Muwaqqar area (dry environment).

The phenotypic variation exhibited by the landraces for 13 quantitative traits indicated that these landraces are heterogeneous populations to various degrees for most desirable agronomic traits, except for growth habit and early growth vigor that were monomorphic. Considering all traits, the average diversity index (H’) for the collected landraces was 0. 71 ± 0. 05.

The progeny test was installed in June 1986, following a 10 × 10, <b>triple</b> square <b>lattice</b> design, containing ten trees in linear plots in 3. 0 × 3. 0 m spacing. Twelve years after the planting, a selective thinning based on Multi-effect index (selection for DBH) was performed, leaving six trees per plot.

The following traits were analyzed: total height (H), diameter at breast height (DBH), volume (VOL), stem form (FOR), foxtail (FT), wood density at 1. 3 m (WD 1) and wood density at the half height (WD 2). The thinning led to increase in the estimates of variability among progenies for VOL and decrease for ALT and DBH.

Tuber yield per plant, percentage of large tubers, mean weight of large tubers, mean medium-sized tuber weight and tuber specific gravity were measured.

The coefficients of experimental variation (CVe), the coefficients of genetic variation (CVg), heritabilities for family mean and the CVg/CVe ratio were estimated. Genetic parameters were stabilized with family sizes as small as six clones, depending on the trait. This indicates that the families can be adequately represented by {{a small sample of}} clones. Using the maximum curvature method it is possible to conclude that approximately 30 clones would be sufficient to represent each family, even for traits with the highest CVe. The genetic variance within family was greater than the genetic variance among families for all traits, indicating a favorable potential for within family selection.

These numbers have first {{appeared}} in the enumeration of so-called Baxter permutations; B_n is the number of Baxter permutations of size n, and Θ_k,l is the number of Baxter permutations with k descents and l rises. With a series of bijections we identify several families of combinatorial objects counted by the numbers Θ_k,l. Apart from Baxter permutations, these include plane bipolar orientations with k+ 2 vertices and l+ 2 faces, 2 -orientations of planar quadrangulations with k+ 2 white and l+ 2 black vertices, certain pairs of binary trees with k+ 1 left and l+ 1 right leaves, and a family of <b>triples</b> of non-intersecting <b>lattice</b> paths. This last family allows us to determine the value of Θ_k,l as an application of the lemma of Gessel and Viennot. The approach also allows us to count certain other subfamilies, e. g., alternating Baxter permutations, objects with symmetries and, via a bijection with a class of plan bipolar orientations also Schnyder woods of triangulations, which are known to be in bijection with 3 -orientation...|$|R

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this work}} were to determine the genetic correlation and define the strategies for obtain maize cultivars for traditional production system. For that, the white maize landrace population was rescued in Barbacena, MG and two experiments were installed with 100 half sib progenies using <b>lattice</b> <b>triple</b> in Barbacena and Campos dos Goytacazes, RJ. The estimates of correlations were different for each local requiring different strategy for trait selection due to contrast edaphoclimatic condition. The additive genetic correlationswere significant among primary production components and the productivity. On the other hand, the additive genetic correlations among primary and secondary production components were non significant. The traits related with flowering showed genetic correlation with productivity and primary production components, but not for secondary production components. Concluded that the increasing of productivity can be reached with direct or indirect selection for all environments; the indirect selection for number of plants/ area and number of plants with ears with kernels can be viability strategy in experiments in the small producers or by themselves instead of to select directly the productivity; the selection for increasing productivity without change the plant architecture is possible and adequate for traditional production system...|$|R
