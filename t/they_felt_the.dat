5|$|Reviewers complimented the book's {{balanced}} {{presentation of}} Armstrong, grounded {{use of the}} period's thought, and contribution to the historiography of industrial education. <b>They</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> book lacked community and state historical context, as well as recent scholarship on Native Americans at Hampton.|$|E
5|$|Following Kahaanis success, Kolkata {{became a}} {{preferred}} destination for Bollywood filmmakers. <b>They</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> landscapes of Mumbai and Delhi were overused for several decades, while Kolkata retained its unique visuals such as metro trains, rickety trams, hand-pulled rickshaws, dingy bylanes, palatial mansions, dilapidated houses of North Kolkata, roadside eateries, ghats of river Ganga, British-era buildings, restaurants and iconic structures and areas including Howrah Bridge, Kalighat Temple, Nakhoda Mosque, Kumortuli idol-making district and Victoria Memorial.|$|E
5|$|In January 1643, {{during the}} English Civil War, Leeds fell to {{parliamentary}} forces. Royalist {{members of the}} corporation were replaced with those loyal to the Commonwealth. With {{the restoration of the}} monarchy in 1660, moves were made to reform the borough's government. The leading merchants of the town submitted a petition to Charles II requesting a new charter as <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> constitution and operation of the governing body was inadequate {{to the needs of the}} town.|$|E

50|$|The {{dogmatism}} of the Puritan divines, {{with their}} anti-rationalist demands, was, <b>they</b> <b>felt,</b> incorrect. <b>They</b> also <b>felt</b> that <b>the</b> Calvinist insistence on individual revelation left God uninvolved {{with the majority}} of mankind. At the same time, they were reacting against the reductive materialist writings of Thomas Hobbes. <b>They</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>the</b> latter, while rationalist, were denying the idealistic part of the universe.|$|R
50|$|Reasons for loss: Even {{though the}} {{executives}} did like their commercial, <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>the</b> direction was poor and their storyline was predictable. <b>They</b> also <b>felt</b> that <b>the</b> app was not shown as effectively throughout the commercial as Unanimous had done. Trump {{also felt that}} their commercial could have used more star power.|$|R
5|$|Many of the {{producers}} were against the move, as The Simpsons {{had been in the}} top ten while airing on Sunday, and <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> move would destroy its ratings. Ratings wise, new episodes of The Cosby Show beat The Simpsons every time during the second season and The Simpsons eventually fell out of the top ten. At {{the end of the season}} Cosby averaged as the fifth highest rated show on television, while The Simpsons was thirty eighth.|$|E
5|$|Some {{historians have}} argued that the Ford {{administration}} felt the need to respond forcefully to the incident because it was construed as a Soviet plot. But work by Andrew Gawthorpe, published in 2009, based on an analysis of the administration's internal discussions, shows that Ford's national security team understood that the seizure of the vessel was a local, and perhaps even accidental, provocation by an immature Khmer government. Nevertheless, <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> need to respond forcefully to discourage further provocations by other Communist countries in Asia.|$|E
5|$|Carmella's {{relationship}} with Connor was originally scripted for Nina Tucker, but {{was transferred to}} Carmella by the producers on Goodrem's departure. Upon Carmella's introduction, her only family member was her mobster father Rocco, who {{had been sent to}} prison. In 2006, Carmella was given a sister, when Natalie Saleeba was cast in the role of Rosetta Cammeniti. Blair opined that Rosie's inclusion brought out different sides to Carmella's character. Many viewers told Blair <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> casting was good because they look alike. One of the significant changes to Carmella was that she started having fun again—Blair felt this meant they worked well together. Later, Erin McNaught was cast as her cousin Sienna Cammeniti. McNaught commented {{that there had been a}} rivalry between the cousins in their youth, so it would be interesting to see what unfolded between them.|$|E
50|$|Sent to {{boardroom}}: No final boardroom - when Trump {{asked the}} men who should be fired they were divided between Michael Johnson, who <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> was <b>the</b> most directly at fault for the loss, and Rod Blagojevich, who <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> was <b>the</b> team's weakest member overall. However, the discussion was rendered irrelevant when Darryl Strawberry suddenly announced that he didn't really want to continue on the show, and was willing to be fired.|$|R
50|$|The Village Voice {{was more}} critical, as <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>the</b> plot was too thin, a {{criticism}} shared by Exeunt Magazine.|$|R

5|$|In September, the {{ownership}} of Color Air was rearranged. Sunde reallocated his ownership and created Color Group, that would wholly own both Color Line, Scandi Line, Larvik Line and Color Air. Sunde retained a 77% ownership in the corporation through Larvik Scandi Line. The group was subsequently listed on the Oslo Stock Exchange. In the general meeting held in December, two of the largest owners of Color Line, Vital Forsikring and the Government Pension Fund of Norway, both were opposed to the merger, as <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> purchased companies were overvalued. Color Air {{was at the time}} valuated at NOK157 million. After a long process between the miniority shareholders and Color Group, the valuation was adjusted to NOK108 million. In May, Olav Nils Sunde bought the entire Color Group, and delisted it from the stock exchange following the conflict with the other shareholders.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers felt {{part of the}} failings laid {{with the}} {{underdeveloped}} characters despite them being slightly different from usual anime stock characters. The story neither properly introduces them nor explains their backgrounds and motivations, making them hard to identify with. Eko's menace only came by force and not by his personality or schemes, making him a weak villain. DVD Talk {{found it hard to}} piece together the relationship between the main characters, but acknowledged the later half addressed some of these issues by revealing the background of some characters. <b>They</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> revelations fleshed out Otoha's personality and motivation, helping viewers to sympathize and identify with the protagonist.|$|E
5|$|Space was {{a popular}} setting for video games at the time, and Jarvis felt the {{abstract}} setting would help obscure simple graphics that lacked realism. Initially, Jarvis spent 3–4months developing color variations of Taito's Space Invaders and Atari's Asteroids. First inspired by Space Invaders, he created a similar game with new gameplay mechanics. After spending a few weeks on the design, however, the team abandoned the idea, believing it lacked enjoyment. Development then shifted to emulating Atari's Asteroids, but hardware differences between Asteroids and Defenders proposed specifications were problematic. Asteroids displays vector graphics on a special monitor, while the staff planned to use pixel graphics on a conventional monitor. The team experimented with recreating the game with pixel graphics, but also abandoned it because <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> gameplay lacked enjoyment and visual appeal.|$|E
50|$|The RSL {{originated}} in the Revolutionary Tendency within the International Socialists (U.S.) (IS) led by Sy Landy and Ron Tabor. They had three principal differences with the IS: {{they believed that the}} IS had abandoned strict adherence to Trotskyism; <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>the</b> emphasis on the day-to-day work within the trade unions diminished propagating the revolutionary objectives outlined in the transitional program; and <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>the</b> USSR and the other Communist states were state capitalist, rather than bureaucratic collectivist.|$|R

5|$|The Simpsons {{first season}} was the Fox network's first TV series to rank among a season's top 30 highest-rated shows. Due to its success, the Fox network decided to switch The Simpsons {{timeslots}} {{in hopes that}} it would result in higher ratings for the lead out shows. It would move from 8:00 PM on Sunday night to the same time on Thursday where it would compete with The Cosby Show, the number one show at the time. Many of the producers were against the move, as The Simpsons {{had been in the}} top 10 while airing on Sunday and <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> move would destroy its ratings.|$|E
5|$|When the United Nations {{intervened in}} Kuwait in 1990, the 24th Infantry Division, which {{was part of}} the Rapid Deployment Force, {{was one of the first}} units {{deployed}} to Southwest Asia. It arrived in 10 large cargo ships of the US Navy Sealift Command. Advance elements of the 24th Division began arriving in Saudi Arabia on 17 August. Some controversy erupted when the division's round-out unit, the 48th Infantry Brigade (Mechanized), of the Georgia National Guard, was not called up for service. Army leaders decided that the use of National Guard forces was unnecessary, as <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> active-duty force had sufficient troops. The 48th Brigade was replaced once the 24th Division was in Saudi Arabia with the regular Army's 197th Infantry Brigade (Mechanized). The 24th Division was then assigned to XVIII Airborne Corps as the corps' heavy-armored division.|$|E
5|$|Following the court-martial of {{the five}} ringleaders, there was debate among the public, in the media, and within {{government}} over the sentences; while most agreed that a mutiny had occurred, there were differences in opinion on the leniency or severity of the punishments imposed. Public sympathy was with the sailors, and several politicians pressured {{the government and the}} Admiralty to pardon the men. The Admiralty thought the sentences were fair, but on 10 September announced that they would be halved on consideration of the sailors' youth. Despite this, controversy continued until 21 November: after the Australian government appealed directly to the Admiralty, it was agreed that the sailors would be released on 20 December. However, the government had angered the Naval Board in appealing to the Admiralty without consulting the Board first. The First Naval Member, Rear Admiral Percy Grant and Commander of the Fleet, Commodore John Dumaresq, submitted their resignations in protest, as <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> show of clemency would lead to a breakdown in discipline, and that if the government continued to communicate with the Admiralty without consulting the Board, it would undermine the Board's authority. The two officers were later convinced to withdraw their resignations after receiving assurances that Board would be consulted before all future government communications to Britain regarding the RAN, and that notices would be posted in all ships explaining that the sentences were correct, but the onset of peace had led to clemency in this particular case.|$|E

5|$|Jarvis {{planned to}} produce sequels, but the North American video game crash of 1983 halted most video game {{production}} {{for a few}} years. Prior to the full effects of the crash, Vid Kidz developed an official sequel, Blaster in 1983. The game {{is set in the}} same universe and takes place in 2085 in a world overrun by Robotrons. Williams considered creating a proper sequel in the mid-1980s as well as a movie adaptation. The company released a sequel with 3D graphics titled Robotron X in 1996 for the Sony PlayStation and personal computers. It was ported two years later to the Nintendo 64 as Robotron 64. In addition to the graphical update, the game includes new audio and multiple camera angles. Though the game features similar gameplay as the original, it was not as well received. Authors Andrew Rollings and Ernest Adams considered the moving camera in the 3D environment a negative update. <b>They</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> original format—an overhead perspective of a single screen—presented the player with all the necessary information and relied on the player's skill. The moving camera angle, however, obscured areas of the playing field and could result in the player being shot by an enemy that suddenly appeared. Vince echoed similar statements, stating that the gameplay suffered from the loss of important aspects from the original. Rollings and Adams, however, attribute the fad of classic video game remakes in the late 1990s in part to Robotron Xs release.|$|E
5|$|Opposition {{initially}} {{came from}} Pennsylvania's House of Representatives protesting the tax. William Maclay had noted {{that not even}} the Pennsylvanian legislators {{had been able to}} enforce excise taxes in the western regions of the state. Hamilton was aware of the potential difficulties and proposed inspectors the ability to search buildings that distillers were designated to store their spirits, and would be able to search suspected illegal storage facilities to confiscate contraband with a warrant. Although the inspectors were not allowed to search houses and warehouses, they were to visit twice a day and file weekly reports in extensive detail. Hamilton cautioned against expedited judicial means, and favored a jury trial with potential offenders. As soon as 1791 locals began to shun or threaten inspectors, as <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> inspection methods were intrusive. Inspectors were also tarred and feathered, blindfolded, and whipped. Hamilton had attempted to appease the opposition with lowered tax rates, but it did not suffice.|$|E
5|$|The {{developers}} {{tried to}} redefine Lara Croft's actions by questioning what <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> character was capable of. While previous games used hand-animated movement for the character, Underworld introduced motion capture-based animation to display more fluid, realistic movement and facial expressions. Stuntwoman and Olympic Gold medalist Heidi Moneymaker was the motion capture actress, and advised the designers on practical movements. Animators adjusted and blended the recorded animation to create seamless transitions between the separate moves and their simultaneous combinations. The blends and additional animations give the character more flexible movement. Actions were overlapped {{to allow for}} multitasking, such as aiming at two separate targets and shooting {{with one hand while}} the other holds an object collected from the environment. Other additions include more melee attacks, as well as contextual offensive and climbing manoeuvres. Crystal Dynamics sought to make the visual appearance of the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions identical, although the systems use different techniques to achieve this. In response to Underworlds lackluster sales figures, Eidos reportedly considered altering the character's appearance to appeal more to female fans.|$|E

5|$|Tracy Hickman and Laura Curtis {{married in}} 1977. Soon after, {{while living in}} Provo, Utah, they wrote the adventures Pharaoh and Ravenloft. When they began work on Ravenloft, <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>the</b> vampire {{archetype}} had become overused, trite, and mundane, and decided to create a frightening version of the creature for the module. They play-tested it {{with a group of}} players every Halloween for five years before it was published in 1983 by TSR. The plot combined elements of the horror genre with Dungeons & Dragons conventions for the first time. At the time of Ravenlofts release, each Dungeons & Dragons module was marked with an alphanumeric code indicating the series to which it belonged. Ravenloft was labeled I6: the sixth in a series of intermediate-level modules for the first edition of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons (AD). It consisted of a 32-page book, with separate maps that detailed locations in the adventure scenario.|$|E
