She became involved in student politics. Relations between China and Japan were tense at this time, and students were urging the government to take a stronger line with Japan. Wu was elected {{as one of the}} student leaders by her colleagues because they felt that since {{she was one of the}} top students at the university, her involvement would be forgiven, or at least overlooked, by the authorities. <b>That</b> <b>being</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> she was careful not to neglect her studies. She led protests that included a sit-in at the Presidential Palace in Nanjing, where the students were met by Chiang Kai-shek.|$|E
5|$|In {{patients}} developing liver failure, a {{liver transplant}} is often the only option to prevent death. Liver transplants have become a well-established option in amatoxin poisoning. This is a complicated issue, however, as transplants themselves may have significant complications and mortality; patients require long-term immunosuppression to maintain the transplant. <b>That</b> <b>being</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> the criteria have been reassessed, such as onset of symptoms, prothrombin time (PTT), serum bilirubin, and presence of encephalopathy, for determining at what point a transplant becomes necessary for survival.

25|$|Unlike the Vice President of the United States, {{the deputy}} prime {{minister}} does not automatically assume the office of prime minister if the incumbent of the latter office dies or resigns. Although {{he or she would}} become the acting prime minister on a temporary caretaker basis to ensure continuity of government function during the immediate period of transition, the {{deputy prime minister}} does not automatically become the new permanent prime minister: constitutional convention actually requires the governor general to consult the governing party regarding the permanent succession, and to call on a member of that party's caucus to assume the prime ministership. No policy or convention precludes the deputy prime minister from being chosen as the new prime minister in such a scenario, but none assures it, either—the party caucus would be free to recommend any new leader of its choice to the governor general. Barring extraordinary circumstances, the governor general is expected to follow the wishes of the party, although officially he or she retains the authority to make the final decision. <b>That</b> <b>being</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> no Prime Minister has died in office or resigned suddenly (except following his or her party's electoral defeat) since the 1890s, many decades before the office of Deputy Prime Minister was created.|$|E

500|$|Intention {{to make a}} gain was {{probably}} necessary in Justinian's time. It is {{thought that this was}} the case during classical Rome, as well: an example of Gaius is quoted in the Digest, and implies so; Sabinus is quoted by Gellius as including such a condition. It is not entirely clear, however. This rule complements the existence of damnum iniuria datum. In a notable example, a man, acting dishonestly, calls a mule-driver to court frivolously, which caused the mules to be lost. Although this was classed as theft, there is no obvious intention to make a gain. This may have been because if the mules were lost, they had necessarily been stolen by someone. <b>That</b> <b>being</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> the perpetrator could be held as an accomplice. Damnum iniuria datum focussed on wrongful damage to property. [...] It is then, in form, more appropriate an action than furtum in cases where a loss has been caused, although the penalty nature of furtum did mean it could result in a higher payment.|$|E

A National Security Council paper endorsed the legality of action north of the 38th parallel. The paper recommended that only South Korean troops be employed in the border regions with China and Russia. Should the Soviet Union intervene, MacArthur was to immediately retreat to the 38th parallel; {{but in the case of}} Chinese intervention, he was to keep fighting [...] "as long as action by UN military forces offers a reasonable chance of successful resistance." [...] Truman endorsed the report on 11 September, but MacArthur remained in the dark because of the changeover of Secretaries of Defense, and was not informed until 22 September.

The California Assembly Committee on Resources, Land Use, and Energy, which proposed a package of bills including 25524.2, reported that the waste disposal problem was [...] "largely economic or the result of poor planning, not safety related." [...] Reassessment of Nuclear Energy in California: A Policy Analysis of Proposition 15 and its Alternatives, p.18 (1976) (Reassessment Report) (emphasis in original). The Committee explained that the lack of a federally approved method of waste disposal created a [...] "clog" [...] in the nuclear fuel cycle. Storage space was limited while more nuclear wastes were continuously produced. Without a permanent means of disposal, the nuclear waste problem could become critical, [...] leading to unpredictably high costs to contain the problem or, worse, shutdowns in reactors.

40|$|Brown (The {{laboratory}} of the mind. Thought {{experiments in the}} natural science, 1991 a, 1991 b; Contemporary debates in philosophy of science, 2004; Thought experiments, 2008) argues that thought experiments (TE) in science cannot be arguments and cannot even be represented by arguments. He rest his case on examples of TEs which proceed through a contradiction to reach a positive resolution (Brown calls such TEs "platonic"). This, supposedly, {{makes it impossible to}} represent them as arguments for logical reasons: there is no logic that can adequately model such phenomena. (Brown further argues <b>that</b> this <b>being</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> "platonic" TEs provide us with irreducible insight into the abstract realm of laws of nature). I argue against this approach by describing how "platonic" TEs can be modeled within the logical framework of adaptive proofs for prioritized consequence operations. To show how this mundane apparatus works, I use it to reconstruct one of the key examples used by Brown, Galileo's TE involving falling bodies...|$|R

The Leader of the House of Commons told MPs that there was no statutory power to cancel a by-election when a general election was in progress, but that there was a precedent from 1923 when a by-election writ was regarded as having been superseded. His expectation was that the Acting Returning Officer would regard <b>that</b> as <b>being</b> <b>the</b> <b>case.</b> There was doubt as to whether the by-election would or would not go ahead, however, with the Acting Returning Officer saying that she had no legal power to cancel the poll.

40|$|This paper takes {{a radical}} view for the {{application}} of a reflexive approach to the analysis of interview data. It suggests that, if adopted, such an approach allows us to see in our data the use of an ongoing reflexivity of the researcher in the interview. As such, this permits us to observe analysis <b>being</b> undertaken during <b>the</b> interview process—not, as is reported in the literature, as a separate stage. Importantly, {{if we look at the}} work of the interviewees, we can also appreciate that they are themselves applying a reflexive approach to their interaction with the interviewer. Indeed, they also undertake a reflexive analysis of the emergent interview and collaboratively contribute to the analytic aspects of the co-produced data which is the research interview. What we suggest is <b>that</b> this <b>being</b> <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> we need to reappraise our view of where analysis of interviews begins, recognize the reflexive nature of interview data production and the contributions of both the interviewer and interviewee to this process in order to recognize and understand the interactional and collaborative practices involved. With respect to photo elicitation we need to recognize that the photograph is not simply a source of information, of details that can be read by the informant. Rather, it is part of a collaborative interaction between the interviewer and interviewee in the production of analysis and data. URN: urn:nbn:de: 0114 -fqs 080330...|$|R
40|$|The {{present report}} {{is the result}} of an {{interest}} in the effect conspiracy theories can have on the development of lay historical knowledge. Should conspiracy theories a priori be dismissed? Or do they have aspects that historians can exploit in order to get their message to a larger circle of lay readers? The mysterious and brutal murder of a seemingly ordinary, middle-class couple in February 1948 serves to gain a practical - not only a theoretical - insight into the issue. After an introductory presentation and discussion of theory on conspiracy theory, <b>the</b> <b>case</b> is examined for the purpose of identifying whether or not it fulfils <b>the</b> requirements for <b>being</b> considered a conspiracy theory. <b>That</b> <b>being</b> found <b>the</b> <b>case,</b> <b>the</b> focus turns to the communication of conspiracy theories; in this case, communication via newspaper and magazine articles, a documentary {{in the form of a}} book, two novels and a television series. These sources are examined in their form and content and found to share a number of common features. The presentation of conspiracy theory to the public is found to borrow successful communication methods from fiction. The report concludes that while historians must not relax the high standards of academic historical method, they might be able to increase the reach of their research results by borrowing from literature’s technique and method for communicating messages that whet the interest of its readers...|$|R

Nevertheless, every breeze strains the bridge a little, every tide does something to weaken its foundations; every change of temperature alters the adjustment of its parts, produces friction and consequent wear and tear. From time to time, the bridge must be repaired, just as the ironclad must go into dock; simply because nature is always tending to reclaim that which her child, man, has borrowed from her and has arranged in combinations which are not those favoured by the general cosmic process.|$|R
