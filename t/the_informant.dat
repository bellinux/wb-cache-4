5|$|Although {{there have}} been {{persistent}} claims of betrayal by an informant, {{the source of the}} information that led the authorities to raid the Achterhuis has never been identified. Night watchman Martin Sleegers and an unidentified police officer investigated a burglary at the premises in April 1944 and came across the bookcase concealing the secret door. Tonny Ahlers, a member of the National Socialist Movement in the Netherlands (NSB), was suspected of being <b>the</b> <b>informant</b> by Carol Ann Lee, biographer of Otto Frank. Another suspect is stockroom manager Willem van Maaren. The Annex occupants did not trust him, as he seemed inquisitive regarding people entering the stockroom after hours. He once unexpectedly asked the employees whether there had previously been a Mr. Frank at the office. Lena Hartog was suspected of being <b>the</b> <b>informant</b> by Anne Frank's biographer Melissa Müller. Several of these suspects knew one another and might have worked in collaboration. While virtually everyone connected with the betrayal was interrogated after the war, no one was definitively identified as being <b>the</b> <b>informant.</b>|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{contribute}} to knowledge about how flute teachers construct gender in relation to their choices of teaching content for students between 15 to 18 years old. The theoretical framework consists of gender theories which are derived from social constructionism. These gender theories accentuates that gender and sex are socially constructed. Four flute teachers were interviewed at two different times each.

The result of how <b>the</b> <b>informants</b> speak shows that <b>the</b> <b>informants</b> are reproducing traditional gender patterns through the language by addressing women and men with different characteristics. The result of what <b>the</b> <b>informants</b> speak about shows that most of <b>the</b> <b>informants</b> are of <b>the</b> opinion that the most important thing with teaching is non musical values. <b>The</b> <b>informants</b> are reproducing a teaching canon consisting mostly of classical music written by male composers.

40|$|Courts treat self-incriminating {{statements}} by criminal informants {{as a significant}} factor favoring the reliability of <b>the</b> <b>informant’s</b> information when making probable cause determinations for the issuance of search warrants. Courts do so even though admissions of criminal activity usually undercut, rather than support, credibility. In using self-incriminating statements to support <b>the</b> <b>informant’s</b> reliability, courts tend {{to rely on a}} theory with significant theoretical flaws. Furthermore, recent United States Supreme Court jurisprudence in other contexts undercuts the reliability of using self-incriminating statements to support the veracity of other information. If courts adequately scrutinize <b>the</b> <b>informant’s</b> self-incriminating statements and the circumstances surrounding the making of those statements, however, these statements can be used to support <b>the</b> <b>informant’s</b> veracity in limited circumstances.

40|$|Due to an {{increase}} in numbers of asylum seeker arrivals to Europe and Norway under the «refugee crisis» in 2015, about 250 reception centres for asylum seekers were established in Norway. This master thesis is based on 10 qualitative interviews to examine expectations and experiences of local residents about “the refugee crisis” and the establishment of a reception centre in their neighbourhood. Different perspectives on symbolic boundaries inform the theoretical framework applied to analyse the interviews across social sciences and sociology. Among others, Lamont and Molnár’s (2002) understanding of symbolic boundaries and Lamont and Aksartovas’ (2002) understanding of ordinary cosmopolitanisms and multiple cosmopolitanisms have been particularly influential to this thesis’ analytical framework. This study is situated within the broader field of investigations into the majority population’s expectations towards, and experience of, immigration, integration and ethnical, cultural and religious diversity in Norway (see for example Bygnes 2012 a; Hagelund 2003 b; Gullestad 2002; Vassenden 2007). Based on the analysis of the interview material and my choices of theoretical perspectives, I argue that the processes of symbolic boundary making and orientation towards cosmopolitism are to be found both between <b>the</b> <b>informants</b> and <b>the</b> inhabitants of the reception centre and between the members of the local community. <b>The</b> <b>informants</b> recounted that many {{of the members of the}} local community were uncertain about a new reception centre because they did not know who was coming and how this might influence their local community. Inspired by Blumer’s (1954) «sensitizing concept», I identify <b>the</b> <b>informant’s</b> different narratives of «uncertainty». I examine how «uncertainty» is given meaning by <b>the</b> <b>informants</b> and is used as both a symbolic marker, as well as a bridge, between <b>the</b> <b>informants</b> and <b>the</b> inhabitants of the reception centre, as well between <b>the</b> <b>informants</b> and other members of the local community. I find Hagelund’s (2003 b) concept of «decency» as a useful tool in the analysis of topics of immigration, integration and increase in diversity. I argue that the meaning of «uncertainty» vary among <b>the</b> <b>informants,</b> such that defining the limits of what constitutes decent uncertainty varies between <b>the</b> <b>informants...</b>|$|R

40|$|This master thesis investigates a {{case study}} of the {{experiences}} of eighteen Statoil project workers in terms of working in a large scale project as a unit in relation {{to other parts of the}} organization. Moreover, contextual conditions influence the experiences of <b>the</b> <b>informants,</b> such as <b>the</b> Statoil and Hydro merger of 2007. <b>The</b> <b>informants</b> are of both ex-Hydro and ex-Statoil background. The data is collected by qualitative interviews of each of <b>the</b> <b>informants</b> in collaboration with two other students of organizational psychology. The interviews were conducted by an open interview guide. The research questions emerged as a result of the analysis of the collected data from the interviews. Relevant theoretical background for the analysis of the data is first of all Mintzberg's (1983) structures in five of organization. Mintzberg's theory is used to describe the various agents of the case, such as the various forms of structuring in the organization that <b>the</b> project <b>informants</b> have to relate to in their work. Hernes' (1975) model of power is further described and used to discuss what characterizes these various relations in terms of interests, dependency and control. Finally, Martins' (2002) perspectives on organizational culture and other perspectives on the merger of organizations are elaborated. The theory on organizational culture and mergers is relevant in order to discuss the various perceptions and experiences of <b>the</b> <b>informants,</b> which are also characterized by conflicting interest. The introduction and chapter four elaborates on some of the organizational differences of the former Hydro and Statoil organizations which were investigated in a previous study on the merger. The analysis investigates three main research questions evolved around <b>the</b> <b>informants.</b> experiences of <b>the</b> project work. The first research question investigates if <b>the</b> <b>informants</b> still are concerned about the merger. Furthermore, the analysis seeks to disclose if there are any direct or indirect influences of the merger expressed by <b>the</b> <b>informants.</b> Finally, <b>the</b> analysis investigates given the tensions, what are the effects of <b>the</b> <b>informant's</b> organizational background. <b>The</b> merger as a concern emerged out the interviews of <b>the</b> <b>informants.</b> First of all they expressed different views on the structure of the organization and the project in relation to their previous organizational background. Mostly <b>the</b> ex-Hydro <b>informants</b> present concern on the organizational structure and system, which appears to be related to the fact the much of the present organizational system are parts kept from ex-Statoil. In relation to this, there appears to be some indirect and direct influences of the merger, such as collegiums and networks. Those informants of an ex-Statoil background express to have more of a network to relate to in other parts of the organization, something which seems also related to how the present system is in many ways parts from the former Statoil organization. The project is an organizational unit dependent and related to many other organizational parts, such as the operative organization, support units, governing documents and the organizational values and strategies. Hence, these relations are characterized by interests, control and dependency. However, how these relations are experienced do also differ between <b>the</b> <b>informants,</b> and particularly between ex-Hydro and ex-Statoil <b>informants.</b> Nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>informants</b> do not present these conflicts of interests as social identities or in "us versus "them" like manners, which is more typical in merged organizations. The conflicts of interests are rather aspects which emerge when <b>the</b> <b>informants</b> express their concerns on the way of doing things in the project and in terms of what they express as most appropriate. The conflicts of interests or diverging perspectives on the organizational system, such as the governing documents and values seem rooted in a cultural difference of perceptions, expectations and habits. Especially, there appears to be a conflict in terms of the focuses and values, such as safety versus efficiency and cost. Thus, some of the diverging perspectives on the organizational culture seem also to reinforce each other as they are perceived as contradictory...|$|R

The study explores why they had a desire to volunteer for the IDF, and analyzes their motivations in a contextual relation to Israel and the Scandinavian Jewish diaspora. The study identifies three central motivations among <b>the</b> <b>informants</b> to volunteer for the IDF. These are Zionist motivations, motivations connected with the Jewish faith and motivations connected {{with a desire to}} be integrated into Israeli society. <b>The</b> <b>informants</b> express a strong conviction in the Zionist credo. The desire to support the state through military service is related to their identification with the Jewish people. By volunteering for <b>the</b> IDF, <b>the</b> <b>informants</b> express that they contribute to the preservation of Jewish existence and Jewish self-determination. Motivations connected with the Jewish faith are also present among <b>the</b> <b>informants.</b> However, these motivations vary according to the individual informants’ observance of Jewish law. The study suggests that <b>the</b> observant <b>informants</b> regard service in the IDF as a secular, but necessary undertaking in order to reach the religious goal of building an exemplary Jewish society that can fulfill the covenant with God. <b>The</b> non-observant <b>informants</b> express that their service in the IDF allowed them to give up traditional Jewish lifestyles brought from Scandinavia, because the IDF provided them with a more modern and secular Jewish universe of meaning. The study identifies a desire to be integrated into Israeli society as a central motivation for why <b>the</b> <b>informants</b> have volunteered for the IDF.
