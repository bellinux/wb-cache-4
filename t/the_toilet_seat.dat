25|$|The toilet itself—that is, {{the bowl}} or in-floor receptacle, the water tank, et cetera—is called benki (便器). <b>The</b> <b>toilet</b> <b>seat</b> is benza (便座). A potty, either for small {{children}} {{or for the}} elderly or infirm, is called omaru (sometimes written 御虎子).|$|E
25|$|The {{most basic}} {{feature is the}} {{integrated}} bidet, a nozzle {{the size of a}} pencil that comes out from underneath <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> <b>seat</b> and squirts water. It has two settings: one for washing the anus and one for the bidet. The former is called posterior wash, general use, or family cleaning, and the latter is known as feminine cleaning, feminine wash or simply bidet. At no point does the nozzle actually touch the body of the user. The nozzle is also self-cleaning and cleans itself before and after operation. The user can select to wash the anus or vulva by pressing the corresponding button on the control panel. Usually the same nozzle is used for both operations, but at a different position of the nozzle head, and using different openings in the nozzle to squirt water at a different angle to aim for the correct spot. Occasionally, two nozzles are used, each dedicated for one area. The control logic is also attached to a pressure switch or a proximity sensor in <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> <b>seat,</b> and operates only when the seat is occupied. The very first models did not include this automatic switch-off. A number of curious users pressed the button while watching the toilet to see its mode of operation, and promptly received a jet of warm water in their faces.|$|E
25|$|In some {{circumstances}} and {{for reasons of}} simplicity, it can be sufficient to not use cover materials at all or to use toilet paper itself as cover material. One example is the case where the UDDT has a mechanized ventilation system and a view guard, like the UDDT manufactured by Separett which has a removable bucket, built-in fan and blue plastic view guard which closes when weight is removed from <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> <b>seat</b> after use. Also {{in the case of}} public toilets, it can be easier to let the caretaker perform the task of adding cover material, rather than the user. An example of this are the public single vault UDDTs operated by the not-for-profit company Sanergy in low-income urban areas in Kenya.|$|E

500|$|There {{were two}} space toilets (ASUs) on Mir, {{located in the}} core module and Kvant-2. They used a fan-driven suction system similar to the Space Shuttle Waste Collection System. The user is first {{fastened}} to <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> <b>seat,</b> which was equipped with spring-loaded restraining bars to ensure a good seal. A lever operated a powerful fan and a suction hole slid open: the air stream carried the waste away. Solid waste was collected in individual bags which were stored in an aluminium container. Full containers were transferred to Progress spacecraft for disposal. Liquid waste was evacuated by a hose connected {{to the front of}} the toilet, with anatomically appropriate [...] "urine funnel adapters" [...] attached to the tube so both men and women could use the same toilet. Waste was collected and transferred to the Water Recovery System, where it was recycled back into drinking water, although this was usually used to produce oxygen via the Elektron system.|$|E
500|$|Indigenous Australians in New South Wales mixed {{the venom}} {{with that of}} snakes and pine tree gum to form a broth used to coat spear tips. Slim Newton drew popular {{attention}} to redbacks with his song [...] "The Redback on the Toilet Seat", which won the Golden Guitar at the first Country Music Awards of Australia in 1973. Newton recalled an occasion when a friend used his outside toilet where the light globe had blown and reported he was lucky {{there was not a}} redback spider on <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> <b>seat.</b> The phrase inspired him to write the song. [...] A sculpture of an impossibly large redback, one of Australia's big things, was built in 1996 at Eight Mile Plains, Queensland. The Angels 1991 album Red Back Fever takes its name from the spider. Matilda Bay Brewing Company produces a wheat beer called Redback, with the distinctive red stripe as the logo. The redback appears in the name and emblem of the South Australia cricket team. The Airborne Redback, an Australian ultralight trike, was also named after the spider. Redback Boots is an Australian workboot manufacturing company, which uses the spider in its name and logo. In 2006 a redback spider stamp was designed as part of a [...] "Dangerous Australians" [...] stamp series, but was withheld from general circulation by Australia Post due to concerns that the realistic depiction would scare people opening their letter boxes.|$|E

50|$|Basically the kettuvallam was {{designed}} to transport cargo and as such many design changes {{had to be made}} to make it a tourist vehicle. The height of the roof was increased to get sufficient headroom. A plank was laid all through the length for ease of walking and comfortable seating, to reduce the disadvantages of the curved shape of the hull. Windows and other openings were provided for light, airflow and view. The entrance is provided in the centre of the linear axis with a top hung panel.Most of the latest designs have incorporated three bedrooms with toilets, a living space and kitchen. Of course, there are variations. Some have a lesser number of bedrooms but with a large living space and maybe a deck balcony at the roof level. Normally, the platforms that cantilever from the hull are used as balconies. Innovative changes have been made to accommodate modern fittings. For fixing <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> <b>seats,</b> shower tray and ceramic floor finish a concrete slab is laid at the floor level. These toilettes are made of steel cabinets with a network of steel meshes on which beneficial bacteria are grown {{with the help of a}} catalyst named actizyme. These bacteria feed upon human excreta and produce a harmless germ free colourless byproduct. The soil outlets of <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> <b>seats</b> are taken through the hull and let out to the flowing water beneath. The use of bio-toilette is common nowadays. Thus the backwater canals are not polluted. The water for use is stored in a plastic tank kept at the top portion of the main body connecting to <b>the</b> kitchen and <b>toilets.</b> <b>The</b> pipes, tank and other synthetic materials are covered with coir or panambu to maintain the aesthetic quality of the eco-friendly materials.|$|R
5000|$|Washlet (Woshuretto) is a {{registered}} trademark of <b>the</b> Japanese <b>toilet</b> company Toto, referring to electric <b>toilet</b> <b>seats</b> with water spray feature for genital and anal cleansing. It {{falls into the category}} of [...] "electronic bidets" [...] and is commonplace on toilets in Japan. Released in June 1980, a total of more than 30 million washlets have been sold by January 2011. Washlets have a large share in <b>the</b> cleansing <b>toilet</b> <b>seats</b> market and are so well-known that similar products from other toilet manufacturers like LIXIL (“shower toilet”) are also colloquially referred to as washlets, even though “washlet” is {{a registered}} trademark of Toto.|$|R
500|$|Meanwhile, at the Simpson family's home, Patty {{comes out}} of the closet as a lesbian, saying that she is in love with a pro golfer named Veronica and asking Homer to perform the ceremony. This makes Marge {{extremely}} uncomfortable, even though the evidence was always there. While Homer accepts Patty's sexuality, a furious Marge reveals that she doesn't want her with Veronica and still insists she marries a man. Patty gets angry and points out that Marge acts very [...] "liberal" [...] about the issue but cannot accept her sister's sexuality, and says she hopes to see Marge at her wedding. Before the wedding, Marge accidentally discovers Veronica is actually a man, ironically while Veronica is singing Aerosmith's [...] "Dude (Looks Like a Lady)" [...] while shaving, and because Veronica left <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> <b>seat</b> up after leaving. Happily she decides to keep quiet about it knowing that Patty will be marrying a man. But Marge is so moved by Patty's heartfelt declaration of love for Veronica during the ceremony that she reveals Veronica's Adam's apple. [...] "Veronica" [...] explains that as the straight Leslie Robin Swisher, he posed as a woman to get onto the LPGA golf tour. He then asks Patty if she'll still marry him, but she declines. Afterwards, Marge reconciles with Patty after telling her that she's learned a lesson and has accepted the fact that Patty's a lesbian; they hug after reconciling. Patty and her other sister, Selma, then go to leave a bag at the airport unattended, as a way to meet security personnel they can date.|$|E
2500|$|A partial {{squatting}} position (or [...] "hovering") by females while urinating {{is often}} done to avoid {{sitting on a}} potentially contaminated toilet seat, although it may leave urine behind in the bladder.

50|$|In {{the final}} evaluation, Johnnie is tasked for his {{incomplete}} challenges, while Brian is tasked for <b>the</b> improper <b>toilet</b> <b>seat,</b> which broke as he showed {{it off to}} the experts. Eric, meanwhile, continues to show a defensive attitude and anger toward Michelle. Despite her challenge failures, Angie is named the most improved, as she found the time to fix the taps on her vanity, and the experts feel that her positive attitude and approach to learning deserves rewarding. As for the worst, Geoff nominates Johnnie for creating <b>the</b> worst <b>toilet</b> <b>seat,</b> and for taking so long to install a pre-assembled vanity. Gail, however, is so disgusted by Eric's behaviour in the Handyman Race and his awful attitude toward Michelle, that she nominates him as the worst; she also adds that this is their last chance to teach him a lesson, as she {{does not believe that}} Eric will be Canada's Worst Handyman. Andrew agrees with her, and Eric is named the episode's worst. For his extra challenge, Eric must own up to Michelle all the tasks that he had abandoned at home.|$|R
50|$|A <b>toilet</b> <b>seat</b> is a hinged unit {{consisting}} of a round or oval open seat, and usually a lid, which is bolted onto {{the bowl of a}} toilet used in a sitting position (as opposed to a squat <b>toilet).</b> <b>The</b> <b>seat</b> can be either for a flush toilet or a dry <b>toilet.</b> A <b>toilet</b> <b>seat</b> consists of <b>the</b> seat itself, which may be contoured for the user to sit on, and the lid, which covers <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> when it is not in use - the lid may be absent in some cases, particularly in public restrooms.

2500|$|In {{suburban}} areas {{not connected to}} the sewerage, outhouses were not always built over pits. Instead, these areas utilized a pail closet, where waste was collected into large cans positioned under <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> <b>seat,</b> to be collected by contractors (or night soil collectors) hired by property owners or the local council. The used cans were replaced with empty, cleaned cans. Brisbane relied on [...] "dunny carts" [...] until the 1950s (one source says until the 1970s); because the population was so dispersed, {{it was difficult to}} install sewerage. Tar, creosote, and disinfectant kept the smell down. Academic George Seddon claimed that [...] "the typical Australian back yard in the cities and country towns" [...] had, throughout {{the first half of the}} twentieth century, [...] "a dunny against the back fence, so that the pan could be collected from the dunny lane through a trap-door" [...] The person who appeared weekly to empty the buckets beneath the seats was known as the [...] "dunnyman", see gong farmer.|$|E

50|$|Water-heated {{seats were}} {{in use in}} royal homes in Britain in the twentieth century. <b>The</b> first electrically-heated <b>toilet</b> <b>seat</b> was {{manufactured}} by Cyril Reginald Clayton at St Leonard's on Sea in Sussex. A UK patent was applied for on 5 January 1959, filing on 4 January 1960 and granted in August 1963 (UK patent no. 934209). The first model, the 'Deluxete', was made of fiberglass with a heating element in the lid triggered by a mercury switch that warmed the seat when the lid was down. Subsequent improvements were made and another UK patent applied for, this time for a deodorizing model with integral fan on 20 May 1970. It was granted on 17 May 1972 (UK patent no. 1260402). At first marketed as the 'Deodar', this model was later sold as the 'Readywarm'. Among the early users of the 'Deluxete' was racing driver Stirling Moss. With the permission of Reginald Clayton, the electrically-heated seat was further developed by the Japanese firm Matsushita. In 1993, Matt DiRoberto of Worcester, Massachusetts invented <b>the</b> padded <b>toilet</b> <b>seat,</b> an early 1990s fad.|$|R
50|$|At CES 2016 in Las Vegas, TOTO {{demonstrated}} {{a prototype of}} a toilet that cleans and sanitizes itself with electrolyzed water.

50|$|Despite the unknowns, {{much has}} been learned about medieval life from the Plan.

2500|$|There are two space toilets on the ISS, both of Russian design, {{located in}} Zvezda and Tranquility.

2500|$|Other {{features}} {{may include}} a heated seat, {{which may be}} adjustable from 30°C to 40°C; an automatic lid equipped with a proximity sensor, which opens and closes based on {{the location of the}} user. Some play music to relax the user's sphincter [...] (some Inax toilets, for example, play the first few phrases of Op. 62 Nr. 6 Frühlingslied by Felix Mendelssohn). Other features are automatic flushing, automatic air deodorizing, and a germ-resistant surface. Some models specially designed for the elderly may include armrests and devices that help the user to stand back up after use. A soft close feature slows the toilet lid down while closing so the lid does not slam onto the seat, or in some models, the toilet lid will close automatically a certain time after flushing. The most recent introduction is the ozone deodorant system that can quickly eliminate smells. Also, the latest models store the times when the toilet is used and have a power-saving mode that warms <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> <b>seat</b> only during times when the toilet is likely to be used based on historic usage patterns. Some toilets also glow in the dark or may even have air conditioning below the rim for hot summer days. Another recent innovation is intelligent sensors that detect someone {{standing in front of the}} toilet and initiate an automatic raising of the lid (if the person is facing away from the toilet) or the lid and seat together (if someone is facing the toilet).|$|E
50|$|An {{alternative}} mechanism {{which is}} in development by the Asian Institute of Technolog, Auto Cleaning Toilet Seat, L.L.C., and others {{involves the use of}} a toilet seat lid that after each use is closing and covering <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> <b>seat.</b> At that point began the process of washing, disinfecting and drying <b>the</b> <b>toilet</b> <b>seat.</b>|$|E
