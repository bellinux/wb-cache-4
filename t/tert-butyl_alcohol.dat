This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Abstract Lipases form Candida rugosa and Candida antarctica were tested for their appli-cation in the enzymatic kinetic resolution of (R,S) -flurbiprofen by enantioselective esterifica-tion. Successful chromatographic separation with well-resolved peaks of (R) - and (S) -flurbiprofen and their esters was achieved in one run on chiral stationary phases by {{high-performance liquid chromatography}} (HPLC). In this study screening of enzymes was per-formed, and Novozym 435 was selected as an optimal catalyst for obtaining products with high enantiopurity. Additionally, the influence of organic solvents (dichloromethane, dichloroethane, dichloropropane, and methyl <b>tert-butyl</b> ether), primary <b>alcohols</b> (methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, and n-butanol), reaction time, and temperature on the enantiomeric ratio and conversion was tested. The high values of enantiomeric ratio (E {{in the range of}} 51. 3 – 90. 5) of the esterification of (R,S) -flurbiprofen were obtained for all tested alcohols using Novozym 435, which have a great significance in the field of biotechnological synthesis of drugs. The optimal temperature range for the performed reactions was from 37 to 45 °C. As a result of the optimization, (R) -flurbiprofen methyl ester was obtained with a high optical purity, eep= 96. 3 %, after 96 h o...|$|R
40|$|Bacterial {{degradation}} pathways of fuel oxygenates such as methyl tert-butyl and tert-amyl {{methyl ether}} (MTBE and TAME, respectively) have already been studied in some detail. However, many of the involved enzymes are still unknown, and possible side reactions {{have not yet been}} considered. In Aquincola tertiaricarbonis L 108, Methylibium petroleiphilum PM 1, and Methylibium sp. strain R 8, we have now detected volatile hydrocarbons as by-products of the degradation of the tert-alkyl ether metabolites <b>tert-butyl</b> and tert-amyl <b>alcohol</b> (TBA and TAA, respectively). The alkene isobutene was formed only during TBA catabolism, while the beta and gamma isomers of isoamylene were produced only during TAA conversion. Both tert-alkyl alcohol degradation and alkene production were strictly oxygen dependent. However, the relative contribution of the dehydration reaction to total alcohol conversion increased with decreasing oxygen concentrations. In resting-cell experiments where the headspace oxygen content was adjusted to less than 2 %, more than 50 % of the TAA was converted to isoamylene. Isobutene formation from TBA was about 20 -fold lower, reaching up to 4 % alcohol turnover at low oxygen concentrations. It is likely that the putative tert-alkyl alcohol monooxygenase MdpJ, belonging to the Rieske nonheme mononuclear iron enzymes and found in all three strains tested, or an associated enzymatic step catalyzed the unusual elimination reaction. This was also supported by the detection of mdpJK genes in MTBE-degrading and isobutene-emitting enrichment cultures obtained from two treatment ponds operating at Leuna, Germany. The possible use of alkene formation as an easy-to-measure indicator of aerobic fuel oxygenate biodegradation in contaminated aquifers is discussed...|$|R
