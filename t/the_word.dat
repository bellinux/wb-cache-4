However, the inscription of Vaballathus is clearer as <b>the</b> <b>word</b> PNRTTʿ is not a Palmyrene word but a direct Palmyrene translation of the Greek term Epanorthotes which is usually an equivalent to corrector.|$|E

5|$|In the 19th {{century the}} French word kilo, a {{shortening}} of kilogramme, was imported into the English language {{where it has}} been used to mean both kilogram and kilometre. While kilo is acceptable in many generalist texts, for example The Economist, its use is typically considered inappropriate in certain applications including scientific, technical and legal writing, where authors should adhere strictly to SI nomenclature. When the United States Congress gave the metric system legal status in 1866, it permitted the use of <b>the</b> <b>word</b> kilo as an alternative to <b>the</b> <b>word</b> kilogram, but in 1990 revoked the status of <b>the</b> <b>word</b> kilo.|$|E

5|$|The Great Vowel Shift {{affected}} the stressed long vowels of Middle English. It was a chain shift, meaning that each shift triggered a subsequent {{shift in the}} vowel system. Mid and open vowels were raised, and close vowels were broken into diphthongs. For example, <b>the</b> <b>word</b> bite was originally pronounced as <b>the</b> <b>word</b> beet is today, and the second vowel in <b>the</b> <b>word</b> about was pronounced as <b>the</b> <b>word</b> boot is today. The Great Vowel Shift explains many irregularities in spelling, since English retains many spellings from Middle English, and it also explains why English vowel letters have very different pronunciations from the same letters in other languages.|$|E
