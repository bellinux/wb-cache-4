50|$|When the {{probate court}} determines that the {{doctrine}} applies to a lifetime gift {{made to a}} will <b>beneficiary,</b> <b>the</b> amount <b>beneficiary's</b> gift under <b>the</b> will is reduced by <b>the</b> amount <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> has already received. For example, if the will bequeaths $5,000 to a <b>beneficiary,</b> but <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> received a lifetime gift of $4,000 from testator that was intended to partially satisfy the gift under <b>the</b> will, <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> will receive only $1,000 under the will. If the will provides that <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> receives {{a percentage of the}} testator's estate, the court may engage in a hotchpot calculation to determine the amount, if any, that <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> should receive under the will. If the value of the lifetime gift received is greater than <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary's</b> calculated share under <b>the</b> will, <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> receives nothing under the will, but does not return any of the lifetime gifts.|$|R

5|$|Such trusts will be invalid {{in several}} circumstances; {{charitable}} trusts {{are not allowed}} to be run for profit, nor can they have purposes that are not charitable (unless these are ancillary to the charitable purpose). In addition, it is considered unacceptable for charitable trusts to campaign for political or legal change, although discussing political issues in a neutral manner is acceptable. Charitable trusts, as with other trusts, are administered by trustees, but there is no relationship between the trustees and <b>the</b> <b>beneficiaries.</b> This results in two things; firstly, the trustees of a charitable trust are far freer to act than other trustees and secondly, beneficiaries cannot bring a court case against the trustees. Rather, <b>the</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> are represented by the Attorney General for England and Wales as a parens patriae, who appears on the part of The Crown.|$|E

5|$|In {{his later}} years Edouard Ravel {{declared}} his intention to leave {{the bulk of the}} composer's estate to the city of Paris for the endowment of a Nobel Prize in music, but evidently changed his mind. After his death in 1960 the estate passed through several hands. Despite the substantial royalties paid for performing Ravel's music, the news magazine Le Point reported in 2000 that it was unclear who <b>the</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> were.

5|$|Oppressive efforts, {{often led}} by Poles, {{including}} Crown tenants or their Jewish plenipotents, Ruthenian nobles of the Commonwealth and even upper-rank Cossack officers, to subjugate and exploit economically the Cossack territories and population in Zaporizhia region, {{resulted in a}} series of Cossack uprisings, of which the early ones could have served as a warning for szlachta legislators.

Other changes made in 1993 included the opening of a new garage in Grays to replace the previous building, and a totally new garage at Ware which replaced that at Hoddesdon. Two more operators were taken over in 1994, namely coach operators Airport Coaches of Stansted Airport and Biss Bros of Bishops Stortford.|$|E
5|$|In 1840, Britain intervened and {{returned}} {{control of the}} Levant to the Ottomans in return for further capitulations. The death of Aqil Agha marked the last local challenge to Ottoman centralization in Palestine, and beginning in the 1860s, Palestine underwent an acceleration in its socio-economic development, due to its incorporation into the global, and particularly European, economic pattern of growth. <b>The</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> of this process were Arabic-speaking Muslims and Christians who emerged as a new layer within the Arab elite. The end of the 19th century saw the beginning of Zionist immigration and {{the revival of the}} Hebrew language and culture.

50|$|Generally, a {{properly}} drafted third-party, discretionary trust is not countable {{as an asset}} available to <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> receiving Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and/or Medicaid benefits.

In exchange, <b>the</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> of these programs must agree to assist in protecting their local mangrove habitats. The training is designed in part to give low-income women in these communities alternatives to harvesting mangroves, a subsistence activity that {{has contributed to the}} forests' degradation. The project also established three large nursery facilities to grow several species of mangroves, to be replanted in areas previously cleared for aquaculture and other unsustainable development, as well as several areas destroyed during the Sri Lankan Civil War.|$|E
5|$|In his will, Sylvester had {{declared}} that royalties {{from the future}} sale of this music be devoted to two HIV/AIDS charities, Project Open Hand and the AIDS Emergency Fund. Although Sylvester died deeply in debt {{as a result of}} taking advances on his royalties, by the early 1990s this debt had been paid off, and a balance had begun to build up. Roger Gross, the attorney to Sylvester's manager and the openly gay lawyer who helped him draw up his will, petitioned the probate court to designate the charities as <b>the</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> of Sylvester's will. The proceeds of $140,000 in accrued royalties were split between the two groups, and they will continue to be paid the royalties in the future.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of express trusts in English law must involve four elements for the trust to be valid: capacity, certainty, constitution and formality. Capacity {{refers to the}} settlor's ability to create a trust in the first place; generally speaking, anyone capable of holding property can create a trust. There are exceptions for statutory bodies and corporations, and minors who usually cannot hold property can, in some circumstances, create trusts. Certainty refers to the three certainties required for a trust to be valid. The trust instrument must show certainty of intention to create a trust, certainty of what {{the subject matter of}} the trust is, and certainty of who <b>the</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> (or objects) are. Where there is uncertainty for whatever reason, the trust will fail, although the courts have developed ways around this. Constitution means that for the trust to be valid, the property must have been transferred from the settlor to the trustees.|$|E

However, using insurance proceeds to pay the insured's estate taxes effectively increases <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary's</b> estate since <b>the</b> <b>beneficiary</b> will not have to sell inherited assets to pay such taxes.|$|R

5|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{advantages}} to charity status. Within English trusts law, a standard express trust has a relationship between the trustees and the beneficiaries; this does not apply to charitable trusts, partially because of the special definition of trustee used and partially because there are no individual beneficiaries identified in a charitable trust. Instead, the Attorney General of England and Wales sues on behalf of beneficiaries to enforce a charitable trust. Because of this lack of a relationship, the trustees' powers are far wider-ranging, only being regulated by the Charity Commission and actions brought by the Attorney General; <b>the</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> have no direct control. Charitable trusts are also exempt from many formalities when being created, including the rule against perpetuities. The trustees are also not required to act unanimously, only with a majority.|$|E
5|$|As Liberal leader, Thorpe {{provided}} a clear {{contrast with the}} pedestrian images of Wilson and Edward Heath, the Conservative leader since March 1965. He was considerably younger, and much more telegenic. His first years of leadership were problematic; he found himself {{at odds with the}} Young Liberals, who were advocating policies far {{to the left of the}} Liberal mainstream. Their demands for workers' control in nationalised industries, British withdrawal from NATO, and massive cuts in the defence budget, caused bitter disputes within the party and damaged its public image. At this time the political climate was not conducive to radical policies; the Wilson government's rapid descent into unpopularity brought a sharp swing to the right among voters. <b>The</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> were the Conservatives, who made spectacular by-election gains at Labour's expense while the Liberals failed to make any real impact. Discontent against Thorpe's leadership was being voiced within a year of his election, culminating in June 1968 when disaffected senior party members combined with Young Liberals in an attempt to depose him. Thorpe had just married Caroline Allpass, and was abroad on honeymoon when the plotters struck. The timing of their attempted coup, widely seen in and out of the party as treachery, ensured that on Thorpe's return the party executive backed him by 48 votes to 2.|$|E
5|$|In {{what was}} seen to have {{promoted}} anti-incumbency, a scandal regarding campaign finance followed allegation that the Centre Party's Timo Kalli's, who was also {{the head of the}} party's parliamentary group, admission in early May 2009 that he violated the law on reporting electoral campaign financing by not disclosing financial contributions he received for his election campaign during the previous election in 2007. When the media then delved further into the issue, stories started to emerge of common practice with a multitude of MPs not disclosing their financial benefactors, a practice which was not punishable under Finnish law. The media investigations focused on a group of entrepreneurs called Kehittyvien Maakuntien Suomi (Finland of Developing Provinces) who financed the electoral campaigns of numerous high-profile government and opposition candidates. Further investigations revealed that many recipients of their financial support did not register or even mention the amounts they received from the group. Then Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen was {{at the core of the}} accusations after the investigations showed he had also been among <b>the</b> <b>beneficiaries</b> of the groups' financing; this was despite one of the members of the group who had planned to build the biggest shopping mall in the country received Vanhanen's support for the plans against the grain of public opinion, thus eliciting accusations that he could have been influenced by the individual. Blame was also put on the Centre Party's secretary Jarmo Korhonen. This was said to have helped the True Finns.|$|E
