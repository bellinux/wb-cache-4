25|$|Finally, {{though not}} an {{approach}} investigating {{some kind of}} rules, there is a criticism by James M. Buchanan, Charles Plott, and others. It argues that it is silly <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> might be social preferences that are analogous to individual preferences. Arrow (1963, Chapter 8) answers this sort of criticism seen in the early period, which come at least partly from misunderstanding.|$|E
25|$|When {{scientists}} use {{the idea}} of parsimony, it has meaning only in a very specific context of inquiry. Several background assumptions are required for parsimony to connect with plausibility in a particular research problem. The reasonableness of parsimony in one research context may {{have nothing to do}} with its reasonableness in another. It is a mistake <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is a single global principle that spans diverse subject matter.|$|E
500|$|Kenyatta and his {{government}} were anti-communist, and in June 1965 he warned that [...] "it is naive <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is no danger of imperialism from the East. In world power politics the East has as much designs upon us as the West {{and would like to}} serve their own interests." [...] His governance was often criticised by communists and other leftists, some of whom accused him of being a fascist. When Chinese Communist official Zhou Enlai visited Dar es Salaam, his statement that [...] "Africa is ripe for revolution" [...] was clearly aimed largely at Kenya. In 1964, Kenyatta impounded a secret shipment of Chinese armaments that passed through Kenyan territory on its way to Uganda. Obote personally visited Kenyatta to apologise. In June 1967, Kenyatta declared the Chinese Chargé d'Affairs persona non grata in Kenya and recalled the Kenyan ambassador from Peking. Relations with the Soviet Union were also strained; Kenyatta shut down the Lumumba Institute—an organisation named after the Congolese independence leader Patrice Lumumba—on the basis that it was a front for Soviet influence in Kenya.|$|E

500|$|A {{focus of}} Tang's {{art is the}} theme of {{national}} and cultural identities, I Was Born Japanese (1995) being an example. Tang notes that he has had four nationalities. He was issued with a Japanese birth certificate as he was born during the Japanese Occupation of Singapore. He became a British national after World War II, a Malaysian citizen when Singapore joined the Federation of Malaysia in 1963, and a Singaporean citizen when Singapore gained full independence in 1965. While living in the UK he was conscious of his Chinese identity, but later on he took the view that he might not be fully Chinese since China had been occupied by the Mongols and Manchurians: [...] "I'm not sure if I'm 100% Chinese blood. I'm sure my ancestor has got mixture of Mongolian and even Thai and Miao people [...] We are all mixed, and this is true. But I always like <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is only one race in the world. We are all one human race." [...] Another of Tang's performances, Jantung Pisang – Heart of a Tree, Heart of a People, centres around the banana tree. He was inspired {{by the fact that the}} banana is used widely in Southeast Asia as an offering to bring blessings, but is also feared as it is associated with ghosts and spirits. He also sees banana trees as a reminder of the lack of democracy in certain parts of the world: [...] "Democracy in many Asian countries and Third World countries is as shallow as the roots of a banana tree. We need to deepen [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|While the Plan is far-fetched, {{the editors}} become {{increasingly}} {{involved in their}} game.

2500|$|The Spectator in 1869 concurred with Stott's opinion, writing [...] "Mr Dickens {{has brought}} people <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> {{is a sort}} of piety in being gushing and maudlin," [...] and that his works are heavily imbued with the [...] "most mawkish and unreal sentimentalism", but the {{unsigned}} critic still maintained that Dickens {{was one of the great}} authors of his time.|$|E

5000|$|Oh, I don’t think so.

It’s somewhat fashionable <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there’s</b> no scientific basic for this at all, and that is certainly, I think, an incorrect position to take.|$|R

2500|$|At the zoo on 28 March he had {{his first}} sight of an ape, and was {{impressed}} at the orang-utan's antics [...] "just like a naughty child" [...] when the keeper held back an apple. In his notes he wrote [...] "Let man visit Ourang-outang in domestication, hear expressive whine, see its intelligence.... let him look at savage...naked, artless, not improving yet improvable & let him dare to boast of his proud preeminence." [...] Here Darwin was drawing on his experience of the natives of Tierra del Fuego and daring <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> was little gulf between man and animals despite the theological doctrine that only humanity possessed a soul.|$|E
2500|$|Swami Vivekananda warned it is {{completely}} unfair to discriminate between sexes, as there is not any sex distinction in atman (soul), the soul has neither sex, nor caste nor imperfection. He suggested not <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are men and women, but only that there are human beings. Swami Vivekananda felt, The best thermometer to the progress of a nation is its treatment of its women and {{it is impossible to}} get back India's lost pride and honor unless they try to better the condition of women. [...] Vivekananda considered men and women as two wings of a bird, and it is not possible for a bird to fly on only one wing. So, according to him, there is no chance for welfare of the world unless the condition of woman is improved.|$|E

I want you to know... that the sound of the conga nourishes me, the sound of the frying pans gives me life and the sound of the bocú drives me crazy. [...] Several days prior to the beginning of rehearsals, I went to see a doctor; I felt overwhelmed, sad, pensive. He prescribed and gave me some injections, and I felt absolutely no different, but as soon as I heard the sound of the first bocú, I was completely cured, I felt strong and ready for anything. And I advise those who are unhappy and listless to get an invigorating injection of bocú, conga and frying pans and you’ll be OK in 24 hours.” (Pérez II 1988:22-3) ...|$|E

2500|$|Lynsey {{decides to}} {{temporarily}} leave the village. Hassan revealed Cheryl's brother, Brendan Brady (Emmett J. Scanlan), would {{become involved with}} the storyline and would begin <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> is something odd about Silas, although Brendan does not think Silas is a murderer. The actress said that this leaves Lynsey to fight her own battles, teasing that the situation gets [...] "even worse before it gets better". Lynsey discovers Texas has been speaking to a girl online. Hassan explained that when Texas is telling Lynsey about the girl she realise that the correspondent is actually Silas who is planning to hurt Texas. Lynsey arranges to meet the correspondent in the woods, planning to take journalist Nancy Hayton (Jessica Fox) with her. However, Nancy does not plan to turn up following Silas' intervention. Hassan explained that Lynsey is unaware Nancy is not coming until [...] "the penny drops that she's all alone {{in the woods with}} Silas, she's absolutely terrified". Lynsey goes missing, with the actress explaining that nobody knows where her character is. Hassan explained that Brendan finds a note which he believes is from Lynsey telling him to meet her in the woods and because he is already suspicious of Silas he come to rescue Lynsey. Brendan arrives at the woods and discovers the body of Rae Wilson (Alice Barlow) in his car before the police arrive and arrest Brendan. Lynsey soon after returns home.|$|E
2500|$|Sovereigntists {{have also}} been against the {{presence}} {{of members of the}} Canadian Royal Family in Quebec. At the height of the Quiet Revolution, the Quebec press reported that extreme separatists were plotting to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II during her upcoming 1964 tour of the province, as well as to kidnap Premier Jean Lesage's son, should the Queen come to Quebec. Despite fears for the monarch's safety and talk of cancelling the trip, the Queen arrived as planned and, in a speech delivered to the Legislative Assembly on 10 October, in both French and English, spoke of Canada's two [...] "complementary cultures" [...] and the strength of Canada's two founding peoples; she stated: [...] "I am pleased <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> exists in our Commonwealth a country where I can express myself officially in French... Whenever you sing [...] 'O Canada' you are reminded that you come of a proud race." [...] Still, as her motorcade passed through Quebec City, the route was lined with Quebecers showing their backs to the monarch; others booed her and shouted separatist slogans. Though the protesters were the minority in the crowds gathered to see the Queen (the Montreal Gazette reporting that those who opposed the visit were students numbering in the hundreds) the provincial police violently dispersed those demonstrators who took to marching through the streets, arresting 36, including some who had been there to show loyalty to the Queen.|$|E

Deacon's photography polarizes popular Anglo culture against Indigenous existence creating satirical images, using Aboriginal imagery, found items, family members, and friends in very strange scenarios. Where's Mickey? (2003) shows the large difference between how Indigenous people are perceived by the white Australian population {{and the reality of}} her family and friends lives.

Sue later starts working as a personal trainer, and Blaine tries {{to get her back}} on McKinley's faculty, but she denies his offer by saying that getting fired {{was the best thing that}} could have ever happened to her, because now, as a trainer, people respect her, and also admits that does not miss the Cheerios at all.|$|R
