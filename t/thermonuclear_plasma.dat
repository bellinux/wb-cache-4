These early laser fluorescence methods evolved under his leadership into a highly sensitive new surface science technique called SARISA: Surface Analysis by Resonance Ionization of Sputtered Atoms. Recent measurements using an advanced form of this apparatus have been made by his colleague Michael J. Pellin (B.S., Northwestern University; Ph.D., University of Illinois).

IN A FULLY IGNITED <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>plasma</b> the fusion energy production balances the various energy losses and the fusion reaction is self-sustaining. The product ions (alpha particles {{in the case of}} a deuterium-tritium plasma) carry a considerable amount of free energy and can therefore drive new plasma instabilities. JACKSON (1986) considered as a preliminary example the propagation of a sound wave through a self-sustaining unmagnetized fusion plasma and showed that such a wave would be thermally unstable. At the peaks of the pressure wave the fusion energy production is enhanced due to the increased density and temperature (the converse being true at the pressure troughs), and this leads to amplification of the wave. A corresponding dispersion relation was derived from a simple fluid model. However, although increased alpha production occurs at the peaks of the wave, the very high energy of the alphas means they have very low collisionality. The increased pressure of th...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{magnetic}} fusion {{research is to}} extract the power released by fusion reactions and carried by the product of these reactions, liberated at energies {{of the order of}} a few MeV. The feasibility of fusion energy production relies on our ability to confine these energetic particles, while keeping the <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>plasma</b> in safe operating conditions. For that purpose, it is necessary to understand and find ways to control the interaction between energetic particles and the <b>thermonuclear</b> <b>plasma.</b> Reaching these two goals is the general motivation for the work conducted during the PhD. More specifically, our focus is on one type of instability, the Beta Alfven Eigenmode (BAE), which can be driven by energetic particles and impact on the confinement of both energetic and thermal particles. In this work, we study the characteristics of BAEs analytically and derive its dispersion relation and structure. Next, we analyze the linear stability of the mode in the presence of energetic particles. First, a purely linear description is used, which makes possible to get an analytical linear criterion for BAE destabilization in the presence of energetic particles. This criterion is compared with experiments conducted in the Tore-Supra tokamak during the PhD. Secondly, because the linear analysis reveals some features of the BAE stability which are subject to a strong nonlinear modification, the question is raised of the possibility of a sub-critical activity of the mode. We propose a simple scenario which makes possible the existence of meta-stable modes, verified analytically and numerically. Such a scenario is found to be relevant to the physics and scales characterizing BAEs.

40|$|In {{the last}} year of active funding, {{progress}} in the investigation of the low-Z pellet-plasma interaction was made in two areas: 1) the calculations to determine a self-consistent solution to the region inside the sonic surface were extended to include boron and tritium tritide pellets as well as lithium and carbon, 2) a slab model for power losses due to line radiation has been included in the overall energy balance for lithium clouds. This has led to the identification of four candidate processes, which could account for the differences between the results from our calculations and the lengths of the Li{sup + 1 } clouds observed during pellet penetration experiments on TFTR: 1) line-radiation from the cloud holding down its temperature, 2) the charging up of the cloud reducing the incident hot electron flux from the plasma, 3) the cooling of the plasma in contact with the cloud, and 4) the reduction of the heat flux of the incident electrons to the cloud due to the backscatter of these electrons from the cloud (i. e., albedo). However, while each of these was explored individually, all could not be incorporated into a single computer code during active funding.
