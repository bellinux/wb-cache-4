50|$|The first {{bicycles}} {{were introduced}} into {{the armed forces of}} several nations in the late 19th century; by the time the start of World War I, all combatants were using them. The German Army had 36 independent companies of bicycle infantry, a battalion of cyclists attached to every cavalry division, and an additional 10 reserve bicycle companies and 17 replacement crews. The Italian Army's Bersaglieri mountain troops were the first to use folding bikes. During World War II bicycles were introduced to paratroopers as a means to provide them with transportation following the landing. The U.S. also used as general light <b>transport,</b> <b>and</b> for <b>messenger</b> duties. Separate units of bicycle infantry existed in armies of many nations until the end of 20th century, it was not until 2003 that the Swiss Army reformed its last three Bicycle Infantry Regiments. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, there was a resurgence in the testing of all terrain and folding bikes, for use by infantry in battle and patroling cities.|$|R
40|$|Adenovirus-specific {{nuclear and}} polysomal RNA, both {{early and late}} in the {{infectious}} cycle, contain a covalently linked region of polyadenylic acid 150 - 250 nucleotides long. A {{large proportion of the}} adenovirus-specific messenger RNA contains poly(A). As revealed by hybridization experiments, the poly(A) is not transcribed from adenovirus DNA. Furthermore, an adenosine analogue, cordycepin, blocks the synthesis of poly(A) and also inhibits the accumulation of adenovirus messenger RNA on polysomes. Addition of poly(A) to viral RNA may involve a host-controlled mechanism that regulates the processing <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> of <b>messenger</b> RNA...|$|R
6000|$|At last an evil rumour arose {{that the}} Ma'ázah had {{determined}} to supply us with <b>transport,</b> <b>and</b> had sent <b>messengers</b> {{in all directions}} to collect the animals. This step looked uncommonly like a gathering of war-men. I was sorely disappointed, for more reasons than one. The state of affairs rendered a distant march to the east highly unadvisable. The principal object of this journey had been to investigate the inland depth of the metalliferous deposits; in fact, their extent from west to east. Their north-south length would be easily ascertained, but the width would still remain unknown. The [...] "Land of Midian," [...] through which we have been travelling, has evidently been worked, and in places well worked; thus the only chance of finding a virgin California {{would be in the}} unknown tracts lying to the east of the [...] "Harrahs." [...] Too bad to be thwarted in such a project by the exorbitant demands of a handful of thieves! ...|$|R
5000|$|On {{the upper}} {{slopes of the}} Ore Mountains the climate may quite clearly be {{described}} as harsh. For that reason, the Upper Ore Mountains was also {{referred to in the}} past as Saxon Siberia. The annual rainfall on the high ridges is up to over 1,100 millimetres, with the majority falling as snow. The annual average temperatures reach values of only 3 to 5 °C. At Oberwiesenthal, located 922 m above sea level, there are on average only about 140 frost-free days a year. These winter temperatures and snowfalls during the winter months, especially on the mountain passes, lead to traffic problems, congestion and closures, even today. According to reports by historians in the past, winters in previous centuries in the upper Ore Mountain regions must have been even harder than today. Prolonged periods of frost and continuous snow cover, metre-high snowdrifts and snow storms often made roads and passes impassable for weeks. Reports by the State Post Office {{on the road to the}} mining town of Sayda on the Deutscheinsiedler Saddle dated February 1855, state that [...] "... because of the immense masses of snow, progress is almost impossible, just as impossible are the conditions during snowfalls". Post had to be <b>transported</b> by sledge <b>and</b> <b>messengers,</b> because [...] "two horses side by side cannot not wade through the piles of snow".|$|R

40|$|Ribonucleoprotein (RNP) {{containing}} structural constituents in hepatocyte nuclei of adult, old and adult, vitamin E-deficient rats {{were investigated}} {{to assess the}} effect of aging and increased oxidative stress on nuclear functions. Fibrillar centres (FCs), dense fibrillar (DFC) and granular (GC) components of nucleoli as well as perichromatin granules (PGs) in the nucleoplasm were preferentially evidenced by the ethylenediaminetetracetic acid (EDTA) method and measured by computer-assisted morphometric procedures. FCs size {{and the percentage of}} nucleolar surface occupied by FCs significantly decreased during aging and vitamin E-deficiency. The percentage of nucleolar surface occupied by GC and DFC remained unchanged in adult and old rats, but in vitamin E-deficient animals GC increased and DFC decreased significantly. PG density significantly changed in aging and vitamin E-deficiency. Functionally, FCs, DFC and GC constitute sites of transcription and processing of ribosomal RNA while PGs are involved in intranuclear storage <b>and</b> <b>transport</b> of <b>messenger</b> RNA. Thus, the present structural changes during aging and vitamin E-deficiency correlate with a decay of nuclear responsiveness to cellular metabolic needs. Considering the antioxidant action of alpha-tocopherol, our data lend further support to the importance of free radical production and control in the aging process...|$|R
