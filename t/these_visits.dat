5|$|In 1922, Hunter {{began to}} make a series of trips to {{mainland}} Europe, where he visited Paris, Venice, Florence and the Riviera. Fergusson accompanied him {{on a number of}} <b>these</b> <b>visits.</b> Hunter's visits abroad produced a large number of paintings and his style changed noticeably in this period of European travel as he began using dabs of colour placed instinctively to portray underlying form.|$|E
5|$|After {{finishing}} his schooling Kagame made two visits to Rwanda, in 1977 and 1978. He was initially hosted {{by family members}} of his former classmates, but upon arrival in Kigali he made contact with {{members of his own}} family. He kept a low profile on <b>these</b> <b>visits,</b> believing that his status as a well-connected Tutsi exile could lead to arrest; on his second visit he entered the country through Zaire rather than Uganda to avoid suspicion. Kagame used his time in Rwanda to explore the country, familiarise himself with the political and social situation, and make connections that would prove useful to him in his later activities.|$|E
5|$|Chrono Resurrection was {{originally}} {{set for a}} Christmas 2004 release. However, Square Enix issued a cease-and-desist letter to Resurrection Games before the release for trademark and copyright infringement. Faced with a threat of legal action, the project was publicly closed on September 6, 2004. According to the development team, the website of the project had received significant hits from Square Enix Japanese IP addresses {{for a period of}} three months before the letter issuing. They assumed <b>these</b> <b>visits</b> were mostly from employees rather than top executives, and hoped the company would see the demo as how the team sees it, a tribute to Chrono Trigger rather than a replacement.|$|E

5|$|Despite her {{elevated}} {{rank among}} the royal wives, Ramavo was not the preferred wife of Radama and did not bear him any children. Upon Andrianampoinimerina's death in 1810, Radama succeeded his father as king and followed royal custom by executing a number of potential opponents among Ramavo's relatives, an act that may have strained their relationship. Unable to find satisfaction in her loveless marriage, the neglected Ramavo and other court ladies spent most days socializing and drinking rum with David Griffiths and his fellow missionaries in Griffiths' home. <b>These</b> <b>visits</b> established a deep friendship between Ramavo and Griffiths that would endure for three decades.|$|E
5|$|In {{her first}} year of service, Australia visited as many major Australian ports as {{possible}}, to expose the new navy to the widest possible audience and induce feelings of nationhood: naval historian David Stevens claims that <b>these</b> <b>visits</b> did more to break down state rivalries and promote the unity of Australia as a federated commonwealth than any other event. During late 1913, footage for the film Sea Dogs of Australia was filmed aboard the battlecruiser; the film was withdrawn almost immediately after first screening in August 1914 because of security concerns.|$|E
5|$|Julia's suspicions {{regarding}} Macrinus' {{involvement in}} the death of Caracalla led to her championing the case of her grandson, Elagabalus, as the rightful emperor. At the time Elagabalus was the chief priest of the Phoenician god Elagabal in Emesa. The soldiers nearby frequently visited the temple where Elagabalus was chief priest, to watch him perform his rituals and ceremonies. At one of <b>these</b> <b>visits,</b> Julia Maesa took the opportunity to inform the soldiers, it is not known whether truthfully, that Elagabalus was Caracalla's son. Simultaneously, she may have seen the opportunity to use her family's wealth and prestige to set in motion her plot.|$|E

50|$|A major {{revelation of}} the visits has been this show of {{solidarity}} and “the affirmation of the homogeneity of Anioma Nation in cultural matters and linguistic affinity”.

5|$|A {{supporter}} of American {{intervention in the}} Middle East, Lynch has made twelve trips to Iraq {{and a total of}} ten trips to Afghanistan and Pakistan. Part of the purpose of <b>these</b> <b>visits</b> was to ensure accountability in reconstruction projects. He voted for the Iraq War authorization in 2002, against the Democratic House leadership, and later voted to continue funding the war. He has since supported Obama's drawdown of troops in Iraq throughout 2010 and 2011. He also supports Obama's renewal of the War in Afghanistan, and was the only Massachusetts representative to vote for funding for Obama's Afghanistan initiative. Lynch voted for increased foreign aid to Pakistan in 2009, but along with Oversight Chairman John F. Tierney, he pushed for strict oversight of the aid's distribution.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Carr Gomm's letters to The Times, Merrick's case {{attracted}} the notice of London's high society. One person who took a keen interest was actress Madge Kendal. Although she probably never met him in person, she was responsible for raising funds and public sympathy for Merrick. She sent him photographs of herself and employed a basket weaver {{to go to his}} rooms and teach him the craft. Other ladies and gentlemen of high society did visit him however, bringing gifts of photographs and books. He reciprocated with letters and hand made gifts of card models and baskets. Merrick enjoyed <b>these</b> <b>visits</b> and became confident enough to converse with people who passed his windows. A young man, Charles Taylor, the son of the engineer responsible for modifying Merrick's rooms, spent time with him, sometimes playing the violin. Occasionally, he grew bold enough to leave his small living quarters and would explore the hospital. When he was discovered, he was always hurried back to his quarters by the nurses, who feared that he might frighten the patients.|$|E

5|$|Sophia and Ann Gardiner Peacock's father, Anthony Taylor Peacock of South Kyme, was {{a wealthy}} banker and his father, Anthony Peacock, was a land-owner, {{who had worked}} closely with Benjamin Handley as a sponsor of the Sleaford Navigation and {{commissioner}} of enclosures in the 1790s. Among the younger Peacock's other daughters was Louisa, who married Rev. Francis William Rhodes in 1844. Louisa and Francis Rhodes's nine children included Cecil Rhodes and Frank Rhodes; they spent their childhood summers with their aunt Sophia at the Manor House in Sleaford and in the Channel Islands. Frank and Cecil learnt to ride at the Manor and it was during <b>these</b> <b>visits</b> to Sleaford that Cecil began his long friendship with Robert Yerburgh, a son of the town's vicar. On Sophia Peacock's death in 1892, Frank Rhodes inherited the Manor House. He was still living there in 1897.|$|E
5|$|After {{the events}} of October 2000, the IDF {{prohibited}} Israeli access to the tomb. As a result of Operation Defensive Shield, Nablus was reoccupied by the IDF in April 2002, with severe damage to the historic core of the city, where 64 heritage buildings suffered serious damage or were destroyed. Some Breslov hasidim and others began {{to take advantage of}} the new circumstances to visit the site clandestinely under the cover of darkness, evading army and police checkpoints. Eventually Joseph’s tomb was once more open to visits. In May 2002, Israeli soldiers mistakenly opened fire on a convoy of settlers taking advantage of an ongoing incursion in Nablus to visit the tomb. Seven settlers were arrested by the army for illegally entering a combat zone. As a result of Operation Defensive Shield, the tomb was retaken by the IDF and shortly afterwards, in response to numerous requests, they renewed guarded tours of the tomb. One day every month at midnight as many as 800 visitors were allowed to pray at the gravesite. <b>These</b> <b>visits</b> were designed to prevent unauthorized and unprotected clandestine visits, mainly by Breslav Hassidim. However, in October, citing security reasons, Israel re-imposed a ban on Jewish pilgrims obtaining special permits and travelling to the tomb.|$|E
5|$|Following the cyclone's passage, the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society began {{dispatching}} relief teams, food, {{and other}} supplies to impacted areas. The Bangladesh Army and non-governmental organizations participated in both air- and water-borne relief operations, though inclement weather initially forced the suspension of several planned helicopter flights. Both the Bangladesh Navy and Indian Navy convened in the northern littoral of the Bay of Bengal {{to search for the}} thousands of fishermen and islanders that went missing during the tropical cyclone's landfall. Due to the wide scope of the disaster, the Bangladeshi government appealed for international aid, particularly from Japan and Canada as those countries had played large roles in the relief efforts of past Bangladeshi disasters. The Government of the Netherlands donated US$370,000for use in the relief efforts following the storm. Lord Glenarthur, then British Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, toured effected areas in Bangladesh for three days before announcing a ₤200,000grant (US$370,000) to voluntary relief agencies assisting in cyclone relief operations. Then-Bangladeshi President Hussain Muhammad Ershad also visited the worst impacted districts, including Khulna and Bagerhat. Following <b>these</b> <b>visits,</b> Ershad's administration established a national disaster committee composed of relief specialists to coordinate relief and rehabilitation efforts.|$|E
