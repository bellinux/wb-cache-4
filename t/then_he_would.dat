5|$|If Sheshi {{is to be}} {{identified}} with Salitis, the founder of the 15th Dynasty after Manetho, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have lived around 1650 BC, the date agreed upon by most Egyptologists, including Ryholt, for the arrival of the Hyksos in Egypt. If Sheshi lived {{during the second half of}} the 15th Dynasty between the reigns of Khyan and Apophis as Ben-Tor and Ward favor then Sheshi would have reigned c. 1600 BC.|$|E
5|$|David Bell, the Home Office negotiator, kept contradicting himself, {{as if in}} a bid {{to prolong}} the negotiations. He would agree to our terms, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> try and tell us it was out of his hands, and go back on his word. If it was out of the Home Officer's hands—then whose hands was it in? I think the final stages were messed around by the Home Office so that our protest could help to divert the public's {{attention}} from the Poll Tax revolt that was going on throughout the country. As Alan Lord was snatched after being asked to negotiate on behalf of us all, this made us all more defiant about ending the protest.|$|E
5|$|Following No Surrender, Raven {{went on to}} {{feud with}} Jeff Jarrett and Rhino. Jarrett and Rhino {{attacked}} Raven on the July 22 episode of Impact!, claiming he had no allies to help him. On the July 29 episode of Impact!, Jarrett and Rhino attacked Cassidy Riley as well, until Raven announced he had chosen a partner to team {{with him in a}} Tag Team match to face Jarrett and Rhino at TNA's next PPV event Sacrifice on August 14. Sabu then appeared attacking Jarrett and Rhino with Raven. At Sacrifice, NWA Championship Committee member Larry Zbyszko added a stipulation to the encounter, in which if Jarrett pinned Raven he would earn a future NWA World Heavyweight Championship match, however, if Raven pinned Jarrett <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not garner one for an entire year. The team of Jarrett and Rhino won the contest at the event, with Rhino gaining the pinfall victory.|$|E
60|$|The {{stranger}} <b>then</b> said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{go to his}} bedroom. Morgan said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{show him}} the way.|$|R

5|$|In October 1956, Sunderland manager Bill Murray bought Revie for a £22,000 fee. Poor results {{left the}} Black Cats facing relegation {{towards the end}} of the 1956–57 campaign, but a late seven-game unbeaten run lifted them to safety, just one place above relegated Cardiff City. A {{financial}} scandal over illegal payments to players resulted in harsh sanctions at Roker Park from The Football Association and forced Murray's resignation. His replacement, Alan Brown, preferred a more physical style of play that did not suit Revie. Sunderland suffered relegation from the First Division for the first time in the club's history in the 1957–58 season, and Revie was dropped for the 1958–59 Second Division campaign in favour of a youth policy. In September 1958, he rejected the opportunity to sign for hometown club Middlesbrough – had he joined the club <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have played alongside captain Brian Clough and goalkeeper Peter Taylor.|$|E
5|$|John's first {{marriage}} probably dates to {{after his arrival}} in Serbia, though the identity of his first wife, if any, is unknown. If the next ruler of Valona, Alexander Komnenos Asen, was his son, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have been born circa 1346–1348, as he was already an adult in 1363–1366. This would place John's potential {{first marriage}} {{a few years before}} Alexander's estimated birth. Around 1350–1355, John married Anna Palaiologina, a granddaughter of Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos and a widow of John II Orsini, the despot of Epirus. This marriage to an Epirote noblewoman consolidated and legitimised John's position in the region. Besides Alexander, another very likely child of John Komnenos Asen was a certain Komnena, the wife of Balša II who had succeeded Alexander as ruler of Valona in early 1372.|$|E
5|$|Newly crowned TNA X Division Champion, A.J. Styles, went on {{to defend}} his {{championship}} against Christopher Daniels in a 30-minute Iron Man match at Against All Odds. Styles had to defend the championship against Daniels at the event as per a pre-match stipulation to their bout on the January 21 episode of Impact!, in which if Styles failed to defeat Daniels in under 10 minutes, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have to give Daniels a title shot. Styles failed to win the contest in under ten minutes, which granted Daniels a title match. Dusty Rhodes then made the match a 30-minute Iron Man match. Styles {{went on to}} defeat Daniels at Against All Odds 2 to 1 in falls during over-time.|$|E
60|$|And <b>then,</b> finally, <b>he</b> <b>would</b> appear once more, {{after two}} hundred years had passed. Two centuries later.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mater, my dear--" [...] he began, {{with the}} whole force of his soul. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> stopped. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> not say it. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> not admit {{that he wanted to}} die, to have done. <b>He</b> <b>would</b> not own that life had beaten him, or that death had beaten him. Going {{straight}} to bed, he slept at once, abandoning himself to the sleep.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{can make}} no other." [...] He still stood before her,--with gloomy and almost angry brow, {{could she have}} seen him; and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> thought <b>he</b> <b>would</b> ask her whether there was any other love which had brought about her scorn for him. It did not occur to him, at the first moment, that in doing so <b>he</b> <b>would</b> insult and injure her.|$|R
5|$|The {{predominant}} bout on {{the card}} was for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship between then-champion Raven and the challenger Rhino. At Sacrifice, Raven teamed with Sabu to face the team of Jeff Jarrett and Rhino. On the pre-show of the gathering, Zbyszko announced if Jarrett pinned Raven during the contest <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> earn a future NWA World Heavyweight Championship match. However, he added that if Raven pinned Jarrett during the contest then Jarrett would not have another title match for an entire year. Rhino ended up pinning Raven at the event, with TNA declaring him number-one contender on their website after the show. Tenay promoted Raven versus Rhino for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship at Unbreakable on the August19 episode of Impact!.|$|E
5|$|Hitler did {{not seem}} overly bothered with {{the outcome of the}} air battle. For him, Sea Lion had also been a huge risk, even with air superiority, and he had been {{convinced}} since the end of August the Luftwaffe would not achieve it anyway. The war with Britain would have to go on. He would maintain the threat of invasion until 1941 through the use of strategic bombing. <b>Then,</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> turn against the Soviet Union and eliminate Britain's last possible ally in Europe. With the Soviets defeated, he believed the British would negotiate. On 17 September, he sent out a directive to the three armed services informing them of Sea Lion delay. On this date, the date for S-Day had been 21 September. It was now postponed until further notice. It is likely that Hitler did not want to gamble his new-found military prestige by launching a hazardous venture across the Channel unless the Luftwaffe had crushed all opposition. At the beginning of December 1940, Hitler told the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW) that they could forget Sea Lion, although he did not formally cancel the operation until 3 March 1942.|$|E
25|$|Even {{the flag}} officer's share {{was not quite}} straightforward; he would only get the full one-eighth if he had no junior flag officer beneath him. If {{this was the case}} <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> get a third share. If he had more than one <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> take one half while the rest was shared out equally.|$|E
6000|$|... "The Mulgar should live, like me, in the water, <b>then</b> <b>he,</b> too, <b>would</b> {{never know}} of cold. Whither {{do you and}} your {{brothers}} wander, O Mulgar?" ...|$|R
60|$|The Secret Service agent, {{who gave}} {{his name as}} William Pollock, {{questioned}} them still further, and <b>then</b> said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> get into immediate communication with his superiors.|$|R
50|$|For this {{election}} {{the two candidates}} with the fewest votes on the first ballot were dropped. This applied to Linklater and Powderface. Riley <b>then</b> announced <b>he</b> <b>would</b> withdraw.|$|R
25|$|A {{possible}} proximate {{benefit for}} females {{is that sometimes}} after a male mates with a female, he becomes her mate. <b>Then,</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> defend and protect her. This is seen in many primate species.|$|E
25|$|Anyone, {{from any}} caste, who {{lived a life}} of disciplined deeds, speeches, thoughts, who had trained and {{developed}} himself in the seven factors of Enlightenment, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> attain the eradication from the (stains/dust/dirt/filth) of mind in this current life.|$|E
25|$|When the {{traveling}} entertainers performed {{at a local}} feast in the nearby hills, John watched and studied the jugglers' tricks and the acrobats' secrets. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> put on shows of his skills as a juggler, magician and acrobat with prayers {{before and after the}} performance.|$|E

60|$|Jonas smiled, {{and said}} he could not go <b>then,</b> but <b>he</b> <b>would</b> look through the spy-glass again towards noon. <b>He</b> <b>then</b> gave the glass to Rollo, and it was carried back safely into the house.|$|R
60|$|I {{waited to}} see her take her draught, and lay her head down once more on the pillow. <b>Then,</b> hoping <b>he</b> <b>would</b> get a sleep, I rose to go.|$|R
25|$|The biggest two {{challenges}} for Munro to overcome while modifying his bike were {{his lack of}} money and that he worked full-time as a motorcycle salesman. He would often work overnight on his bikes (he had a 1936 Velocette MSS as well), <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> {{go to work in}} the morning, having had no sleep the night before.|$|E
25|$|Spicer {{noted that}} if Wyatt and Holliday had {{not backed up}} Marshal Earp, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have faced even more {{overwhelming}} odds than he had, and {{could not possibly have}} survived. He invited the grand jury to confirm his findings, and two weeks later, it agreed with Spicer's finding and also refused to indict the men.|$|E
25|$|Colombo did not {{consider}} any turn to starboard practical. If he made a slight turn to starboard, and the ferry responded according to practice (to yield to the larger vessel), <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> have turned toward the ferry and a collision. If he made a radical turn to starboard, {{he would have been}} in jeopardy of collision with the ship moored at the grain elevator.|$|E
60|$|Steadfast <b>then</b> said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> milk the cow if Jeph {{would run}} to the next cottage and get help. People would come when they knew the {{soldiers}} were gone.|$|R
60|$|When {{they came}} to the trap, they found it shut. Jonas took it up, and tipped it one way and the other, and listened. He heard {{something}} moving in it, but did not know whether it was anything more than the corn cob. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> said <b>he</b> <b>would</b> open the trap a very little, and let Rollo peep in.|$|R
50|$|Hallman <b>then</b> {{announced}} that <b>he</b> <b>would</b> try and move down to lightweight.|$|R
25|$|From around 1849 Darwin stopped {{attending}} church, but Emma and {{the children}} continued to attend services. On Sundays Darwin sometimes went with them {{as far as the}} lych gate to the churchyard, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> go for a walk. During the service, Emma continued to face forward when the congregation turned to face the altar for the Creed, sticking to her Unitarian faith.|$|E
25|$|The Talmud {{argues that}} a husband is {{responsible}} for the protection of his wife's body. If his wife became ill, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be compelled, by the Talmud, to defray any medical expense which might be incurred in relation to this; the Talmud requires him to ensure that the wife receives care. Although he technically had the right to divorce his wife, enabling him to avoid paying for her medical costs, several prominent rabbis throughout history condemned such a course of action as inhuman behaviour, even if the wife was suffering from a prolonged illness.|$|E
25|$|Darwin was on {{good terms}} with the local curate. He contributed to the church, helped with parish {{assistance}} and proposed a benefit society which became the Down Friendly Society with Darwin as guardian and treasurer. On Sundays Emma took the children to church. Darwin sometimes went with them {{as far as the}} lychgate to the churchyard, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> go for a walk. During the service, Emma continued to face forward when the congregation turned to face the altar for the Creed, sticking to her Unitarian faith.|$|E
