5|$|A grave found a short {{distance}} away also contained jewellery, including a gold pendant, silver brooch, and glass beads. It is thought that <b>the</b> <b>occupant</b> may have had a close connection with the woman in the bed burial– perhaps a relative or a lady-in-waiting who was buried with her mistress.|$|E
5|$|After the rosters were announced, {{a second}} round of fan voting, the Monster All-Star Final Vote, was {{commenced}} to determine <b>the</b> <b>occupant</b> of the final roster spot for each team. This round lasted until July 5. Chris Young and Hideki Okajima were elected to represent the National League and American League, respectively, in the All-Star Game as first time All-Stars. All ten players included in the balloting were pitchers, a first for the event.|$|E
5|$|The {{disaster}} {{caused the}} deaths of 33 people: 32 tourists (17 of them were Swedes) and <b>the</b> <b>occupant</b> of the apartment above the book store. Eighteen charred bodies were recovered from the debris. Thirteen people, who had jumped from windows, either died or were severely injured. Among the dead was the celebrated German concert musician and composer Walter Kraft, longtime organist of St. Mary's Church, Lübeck. Of the 57 people who were injured, 21 had severe injuries. Two guests from the United States escaped without injury.|$|E

5|$|At Sutton Hoo (near Woodbridge, in Suffolk) is {{the site}} of two 6th-7th century Anglo-Saxon cemeteries, where it is {{believed}} that members of the Eorpwald's dynasty were entombed under large earth mounds. Several East Anglian kings, including Eorpwald, have been suggested as possible candidates for <b>the</b> <b>occupant</b> of the burial site under Mound 1, discovered in 1939. Martin Carver has speculated that historians could use regal lists and other sources of information to identify the occupants, whilst acknowledging that no material evidence exists to support the theory that Eorpwald or other members of his family are buried there. He has used Eorpwald's relationship as the son of Rædwald to place him in either Mound 1 or 2.|$|E
5|$|On stardate 3141.9, the Federation {{starship}} USS Enterprise {{finds the}} derelict SS Botany Bay floating in space. Botany Bay was launched from Earth in the 1990s. A landing party comprising Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner), Doctor Leonard McCoy (DeForest Kelley), Chief Engineer Montgomery Scott (James Doohan), and historian Lieutenant Marla McGivers (Madlyn Rhue) beams {{over to the}} freighter. The landing party finds a cargo of 84 humans, 72 of whom are alive in suspended animation after nearly 200years. McGivers identifies the group's leader. <b>The</b> <b>occupant</b> begins to revive, but Kirk brings him to Enterprise for a medical examination when his chamber fails.|$|E
5|$|From around 616, Rædwald was {{the most}} {{powerful}} of the English kings south of the River Humber. According to Bede he was the fourth ruler to hold imperium over other southern Anglo-Saxon kingdoms: he was referred to in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, written centuries after his death, as a bretwalda (an Old English term meaning 'Britain-ruler' or 'wide-ruler'). He was the first king of the East Angles to become a Christian, converting at Æthelberht's court some time before 605, whilst at the same time maintaining a pagan temple. In receiving the faith he helped to ensure the survival of Christianity in East Anglia during the apostasy of the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms of Essex and Kent. He is generally considered by historians to be the most favoured candidate for <b>the</b> <b>occupant</b> of the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, although other theories have been advanced.|$|E

50|$|Building {{a shelter}} can aid {{survival}} {{where there is}} danger of death from exposure. Shelters can be of many different types, metal can conduct heat away from <b>the</b> <b>occupants</b> and is sometimes best avoided. The shelter should not be too big so body warmth stays near <b>the</b> <b>occupants.</b> Good ventilation is essential especially if a fire will be lit in the shelter. Fires should be put out before <b>the</b> <b>occupants</b> sleep to prevent carbon monoxide poisoning. People caught in very cold, snowy conditions can build an igloo or snow cave to shelter.|$|R
5|$|Rents {{were set}} {{based on the}} income of <b>the</b> <b>occupant.</b> Transient {{visitors}} to Los Alamos were accommodated in the Fuller Lodge, the Guest Cottage or the Big House, which had once {{been part of the}} Los Alamos Ranch School. A school was established in 1943, catering for both grade school and high school, and 140 children were enrolled; 350 by 1946. Education was free, as was a nursery school for working mothers. With 18 grade-school teachers, 13 high-school teachers, and a superintendent, it enjoyed an excellent teacher:pupil ratio. Numerous technical buildings were constructed. Most were of a semi-permanent type, using gypsum board. They were heated from a central heating plant. Initially this was Boiler House No. 1, which had two coal-fired boilers. This was replaced by Boiler House No. 2, which had six oil-fired boilers. In addition to the main site at Los Alamos, some 25 outlying sites were developed for experimental work.|$|E
5|$|The {{governmental}} {{structure of}} the newly formed Confederate States of America was very much {{like that of the}} parent United States. The executive branch was partitioned into several departments, each headed by a secretary or equivalent who would advise the president. The constitution provided for a navy that would be directed by its own department, and President Jefferson Davis nominated Mallory to be Confederate States Secretary of the Navy. He was chosen for two principal reasons: first, he had extensive experience with nautical affairs, both in his boyhood home of Key West and later in Washington; and second, he was from Florida. In a bow to the principle of States' Rights, Davis had to spread representation in his cabinet around among the seceding states. Although the requirement of geographical representation sometimes meant that <b>the</b> <b>occupant</b> would not be the best person available, the selection process worked well in Mallory's case.|$|E
5|$|The bones show {{a variety}} of {{diseases}} and degenerative processes. Six skeletons showed evidence of Paget's disease of bone (osteitis deformans). The most severe case of Paget's disease was in a body buried in the nave in a stone coffin. The lid was carved with two shields, indicating that <b>the</b> <b>occupant</b> had been a knight. One skeleton showed signs of leprosy affecting bones in the face, hands and feet. No definite cases of tuberculosis directly affecting bones were found but in two individuals there were changes in the ribs consistent with their having suffered from tuberculosis of the lungs. The only major congenital abnormality found consisted of bony changes resulting from a possible case of Down's syndrome. Relatively minor congenital abnormalities of the spine were found in 19skeletons, ten of which were cases of spina bifida occulta. Other spinal abnormalities included fused vertebrae, spondylolysis and transitional vertebrae. Definite evidence of fractured bones was found in ten skeletons, and evidence of possible fractures was found in three other cases. One cranium contained a large circular lesion {{which may have been}} the consequence of trepanning. Other diseases specific to bones and joints were osteoarthritis, diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), and possible cases of spondyloarthropathy. Three skeletons showed possible evidence of rickets, two had changes of osteoporosis, and three crania had features of hyperostosis frontalis interna, a metabolic condition affecting post-menopausal women. Osteomata (benign tumours of bone) were found in three cases.|$|E

40|$|The Victorian {{government}} implemented {{legislation for}} all new houses {{to achieve a}} 6 star rating since May 2011.

25|$|The {{ejection}} seat was the Raketstol 37 (literally; Rocket chair 37) {{and was the}} last Saab designed seat in service. A derivative of the Saab 105 trainer seat, the seat was optimized for low altitude, high speed ejections. Once activated by the pilot via triggers built into the armrests (on twin-seat models, <b>the</b> <b>occupant</b> of the forward cockpit position is able to initiate the ejection of both seats), the ejection sequence is automated, including {{the removal of the}} canopy; {{in the event of a}} malfunction, a reserve trigger can be activated. A combined parachute and seat harness is used, which features a barometric interlock to appropriately release <b>the</b> <b>occupant</b> and harness from the seat during the ejection sequence, a manual override handle is also provided for this function.|$|E
