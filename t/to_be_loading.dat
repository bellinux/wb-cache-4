40|$|The present {{experimental}} investigation {{deals with}} the mechanical behaviour of glass/epoxy composites at cryogenic temperature. Woven and chopped E-glass fibres of 50 weight percentage were reinforced with epoxy matrix to prepare the laminated composites. 3 -point bend tests were carried out to assess interlaminar fracture behaviour at cryogenic and at ambient conditions. The specimens were tested at a range of 2 mm/min to 500 mm/min crosshead speed to evaluate the sensitivity of mechanical response during loading at these conditions. The mechanical performances of the laminated specimens at cryogenic conditions were compared with room temperature property by using SEM photographs. DSC was carried out to study whether there is any change in glass transition temperature. Glass/epoxy composites were found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>loading</b> rate sensitive. DSC analysis shows increase in glass transition temperature after cryogenic conditioning which {{may be due to}} irreversibility of the chain mobility. Phenomenological behaviour of these composite materials may be attributed by polymer relaxation at low temperature, cryogenic hardening, matrix cracking, and misfit strain due to differential thermal coefficient of the fibre and the matrix and also by enhanced mechanical keying factor by compressive residual stresses generated at cryogenic temperatures...|$|E
40|$|The basic {{purpose of}} this inquiry was to {{consider}} women 2 ̆ 7 s issues (specifically women 2 ̆ 7 s education) in two cultural contexts, Iranian and American. The differences and similarities of American and Iranian attitudes toward women 2 ̆ 7 s education was investigated by conducting research on 80 Iranian and 83 American females and males, married and single, attending universities in the midwestern United States. The semantic differential technique was used to construct an instrument with 16 2 ̆ 2 situations 2 ̆ 2 related to women 2 ̆ 7 s education as concepts. The Iranian questionnaire was in Farsi; American subjects had an English version;Factor analysis showed six 2 ̆ 2 qualifiers 2 ̆ 2 <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>loading</b> high (. 77 -. 85) in both language/culture groups (reasonable/unreasonable; good/bad, fair/unfair, right/wrong, acceptable/unacceptable, appropriate/inappropriate). Responses to the situations were compared by a three factor analysis of variance with repeated measures on the third factor. Married and single {{men and women in}} the two national groups did not respond the same way to all situations.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study is to {{investigate}} the interest in Sami reindeer herders to use the Low Stress Stockhandling (LSS) method for handling reindeer. Also to find out which reindeer handling situations they think works the best and the worst, and which might need improvement. The purpose of LSS is to reduce the stress animals are subjected to during handling by creating consistent and calm responses from the animals. This is done by handling the animals through the animals’ point of view and using natural herd behavior to accomplish this. Data was collected through a ten question questionnaire distributed to reindeer herders. The questions intended to gain information on the background information about the participant, the aids used when managing reindeer, what handling situation the participants thought worked the best and worst the handling situation they believed is the most and least stressful for the reindeer, and if they thought that the stress reindeers are subjected to needs to be decreased. Other information collected included their thoughts about LSS and if they thought they would benefit from it during reindeer handling. Data received was complied together to get the total sum of all participants answers. 31 people answered the survey, 17 men and 14 {{women between the ages of}} 18 and 52, with a mean age of 30. The aids used most were snowmobile and herding dog, and lasso was mostly used when capturing reindeer. When agreeing or disagreeing to the statement “There is a need to reduce the stress that reindeers are exposed to” on a seven point scale, where one was that they totally agreed and seven was that they totally disagreed; the mean value became 2, 74. The handling situation that the participants thought worked the best was moving reindeer and the one that worked the worst was loading. The most stressful handling situation was also believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>loading</b> and the least stressful was gathering on bare ground. A majority of the participants (68 %) thought that the LSS method could benefit them during reindeer handling. Loading and transportation was the handling situation participants found to be the most difficult, making loading a possible handling situation where LSS could be demonstrated and used by reindeer herders. Due to many managers involved in a reindeer herding district there can be difficulties in convincing everyone to participate in the new handling method. Reindeer are susceptible to handling stress. Therefore a reduction of the stress reindeers are exposed to during handling with LSS could benefit not only the reindeer, but also the reindeer herders and consumers of reindeer meat...|$|E

40|$|Global warming {{has become}} one of the world’s most {{important}} challenges over the last decades and carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions are determined to be a major contributor. Various carbon dioxide capture and storage (CCS) technologies are available worldwide but post combustion CO 2 capture with chemical absorbents is considered today to be the most advanced and mature technology for mitigating CO 2 emissions from burning fossil fuels. Implementing CCS has the potential of reducing and reversing the effects of CO 2 on global warming and climate change. In reactive absorption, carbon dioxide chemically reacts to form chemical bond and is thereby moved from a gas to a liquid phase. The chemical reaction is reversible and CO 2 is released from the solvent during regeneration by raising the temperature. Thereby almost pure CO 2 is collected, compressed and sent to storage and the regenerated solvent is sent for re-use. Amines are usually employed as absorbents for CO 2 capture and monoethanolamine (MEA), diisopropanolamine (DIPA), N-methyldiethanolamine (MDEA) and 2 -amino- 2 - methyl- 1 -propanol (AMP) are commonly used. However, due to problems associated with alkanolamines, such as their degradation in oxygen rich atmospheres, considerable energy need for solvent regeneration, environmental issues and recycling efficiency, the quest to find alternative candidates is very important. In this work spectroscopic methods, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR), are used, to both qualitatively and quantitatively characterize a range of absorbents for CO 2 capture including primary, secondary, tertiary or blended amine systems in addition to amine-amino acid absorbents. Liquid phase speciation is one of the most important experimental data for thermodynamic and kinetic modeling of absorption systems. First a comprehensive standard method for liquid phase speciation in amine and amino acid-CO 2 -H 2 O systems by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy is presented and validated against measurements on monoamine, diamine and amine-amino acid systems. This method was then used for all our measurements presented in the current work. These measurements provide valuable information about the parameters that should be considered when studying different amine, amine-amino acid-CO 2 -H 2 O system by NMR spectroscopy. Carbamate stability is a very important parameter for determining the absorption capacity and regeneration energy requirement. Therefore, 13 C-NMR was employed to study the carbamate formation and to estimate the apparent carbamate stability constant in aqueous solutions of CO 2 and sterically hindered amine, 2 -amion- 2 -methyl-propan-ol, (AMP) at different temperatures. In order to determine the apparent carbamate stability constant of AMP, a method for separating amine/protonated amine and bicarbonate/carbonate was developed and presented in our work. The apparent carbamate stability constant was reported <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>loading</b> and temperature dependency. Phase change solvents for CO 2 capture was another important topic where our research was also focused. Liquid phase speciation of blended aqueous solutions of DEEA/MAPA/CO 2 /H 2 O as well as unblended MAPA/CO 2 /H 2 O and DEEA/CO 2 /H 2 O system is presented here. One of the most important information we can gain from 13 CNMR spectroscopy is the ability to distinguish between primary, secondary, di-carbamate and carbonate/bicarbonate species. Blended system of DEEA/MAPA can form two liquid phases after being loaded with CO 2 and both phases were analyzed quantitatively by NMR spectroscopy. Qualitative and quantitative NMR experiments to investigate the liquid phase speciation in amino acids (Glycine, L-Alanine, Taurine, L-Serine and L-Proline) neutralized by equimolar quantities of monoethanolamine amine (MEA) and 2 -amino- 2 -methyl- 1 - propanol (AMP) were performed at 25 °C for different CO 2 loadings. AMP was found to have better performance in neutralizing the amino acids and enhancing the bicarbonate/carbonate formation. Further, studies were performed to develop calibration models for prediction of various systems using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Multivariate data analyses were performed to develop the models. Online analysis of monoethanolamine solvent in a pilot plant was demonstrated by application of the developed model using a mobile setup for extractive sampling to an FTIR analyzer. These results showed the possibility of developing a comprehensive multivariate calibrated model such as Partial Least Square (PLS) for on-line prediction and is well suited for analysis of amine solvents, both in the lab and for online process monitoring.
