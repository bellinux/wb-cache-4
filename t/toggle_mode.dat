40|$|To {{create a}} {{wireless}} neural recording {{system that can}} benefit from the continuous advancements being made in embedded microcontroller and communications technologies, an embedded-system-based architecture for wireless neural recording has been designed, fabricated, and tested.

40|$|Spinal pathologies or {{injuries}} can severely {{compromise the}} quality of life for the patients. The surgical intervention is often performed using internal fixation devices. Fixation with pedicle screws is a well-established method providing spinal stability and deformity correction. However, reported rates of fixation failure because of screw loosening have become a major concern, especially with the appearance of new and more powerful surgical techniques. Numerous experimental studies have been devoted to pedicle screw fixation strength evaluation. The evaluation methods are commonly including preoperative measurements of bone mineral density, screw insertional torque measurement and pullout tests. Bone mineral density measurement gives only to some extent an estimation of the pedicle screw fixation strength. Several studies indicated that the screw insertional torque measurement can provide predictive information on the fixation strength. However, the latter was not confirmed by other studies. This controversy illustrates the need for improving the understanding of factors related to pedicle screw fixation strength. In addition, there is a need for better understanding the mechanisms of pedicle screw loosening leading to failure and their effects on the fixation strength. The main objective of this doctoral thesis was to improve the understanding on the mechanisms of pedicle screw loosening and the factors related to pedicle screw fixation strength. This objective is related to two hypotheses: 1) the indentation force measured while performing the pilot hole and the torque observed during screw insertion are related to the screw pullout force and stiffness; 2) cyclic bending load (toggling) on pedicle screw in craniocaudal (CC) and mediolateral (ML) directions loosens the screw and affects the pullout force and stiffness. Three specific objectives were defined to verify the hypotheses using two experimental protocols. The first specific objective was to develop and validate tools measuring the indentation force while performing the pilot hole and the insertional torque during pedicle screw insertion. The second objective was to compare the screw loosening mechanisms through <b>toggling</b> in different <b>modes</b> and evaluate their effects on pedicle screw pullout force and stiffness. Finally, the third objective was to establish the relationships between the indentation force, the insertional torque and the screw pullout force and stiffness. The first protocol was performed on synthetic bone surrogates mainly to explore the first specific objective. Furthermore, to account for the effect of various bone densities and <b>toggling</b> <b>modes</b> on pullout force and stiffness, pedicle screw were pulled out with and without toggling from synthetic bone surrogates of three different densities. With five repetitions, a total of 36 trials have been completed. Finally, potential relationships between the indentation force and the insertional torque with the pullout force and stiffness were explored. The second protocol was performed on porcine vertebrae to investigate the second and the third specific objectives. As the second specific objective, three <b>toggling</b> <b>modes</b> (CC, ML and no toggling (NT)) were performed on porcine lumbar vertebrae ranging from L 1 to L 3. The screws were then submitted to axial pullout test. A complete design of experiment with two factors and three levels (32 = 9 trials) was used to investigate on the main effect of <b>toggling</b> <b>mode</b> and vertebral level on screw pullout force and stiffness, as well as their quadratic interactions. With five repetitions, a total of 54 trials were performed on 27 isolated vertebrae, using both pedicles. Finally, potential relationships were investigated between the indentation force while performing a pilot hole, the insertional torque during screw insertion, and the pullout force and stiffness with and without toggling. The results of the first protocol suggest that screw toggling significantly affects the pullout force (P = 0. 01) and stiffness (P < 0. 0001). A higher pullout force and stiffness was demonstrated for higher density without toggling. The effect of density was higher than the effect of toggling on pullout force. The indentation force while performing the pilot hole was significantly correlated to pullout force and stiffness (r = 0. 99, P < 0. 0001 and r = 0. 92, P < 0. 0001 respectively). Strong correlations were also shown between the insertional torque during screw insertion and the pedicle screw pullout force and stiffness (r = 0. 98, P < 0. 0001 and r = 0. 91, P < 0. 0001 respectively). The study on porcine vertebrae showed that screw toggling significantly affects the pullout force (P = 0. 0004) and stiffness (P 0. 85, P < 0. 0001). For pullout force without toggling BMD and pedicle area were the main contributing factors to the regression model. For the stiffness with and without toggling, the indentation force was the single best factor with highest contribution to the regression model. In conclusion, pedicle screw toggling significantly affects the pedicle screw pullout force and stiffness. Screw toggling, in particular CC toggling, should be considered in the biomechanical evaluation of pedicle screw fixation strength. Furthermore, the contribution of toggling was more important on the stiffness than the pullout force. The effect of vertebral level should be considered in determining the fixation strength. The developed instruments and methods for indentation force measurement during pilot hole creation and insertional torque measurement during screw insertion were reproducible, and provide valuable data to estimate pedicle screw pullout force and stiffness. The relationship between the pilot hole indentation force and screw insertional torque, and the screw pullout force and stiffness are a affected by the <b>toggling</b> <b>mode.</b> Indentation force and insertional torque measurements, together with BMD measurement, are recommended for a better estimation of pedicle screw fixation strength after CC toggling...|$|R

40|$|Two-channel SAR-GMTI {{systems are}} {{suboptimal}} for moving target motion parameter estimation. Indeed, the ATI phase {{estimate of the}} across-track velocity component for a moving target is biased to lower values depending on the target signal to clutter ratio and the target across-track velocity. Additional antenna diversity can introduce additional degrees of freedom that can eliminate the bias problem. Aperture switching is an accepted method to virtually {{increase the number of}} channels without adding new hardware. One such mode is the RADARSAT- 2 <b>Toggle</b> <b>mode</b> citeChiu_ 2006. This paper proposes a new processing method to create a similar effective phase center configuration as the RADARSAT- 2 <b>Toggle</b> <b>mode</b> from already recorded two-channel SAR data. This is achieved by delaying and combining the recorded two-channel measurements. The combination operation manifests not only a third phase center halfway between the phase centers of the two-channel system, but also a different antenna length of the virtual third antenna which requires a modification of the DPCA-ATI processing algorithm. The DPCA-ATI performance of the new mode is assessed and compared to ATI from the original two-channel mode...|$|E

40|$|In Drosophila, {{negatively}} reinforcing dopaminergic neurons {{also provide}} the inhibitory control of satiety over appetitive memory expression. Here {{we show that}} aversive learning causes a persistent depression of the conditioned odor drive to two downstream feed-forward inhibitory GABAergic interneurons of the mushroom body, called MVP 2, or mushroom body output neuron (MBON) -γ 1 pedc>α/β. However, MVP 2 neuron output is only essential for expression of short-term aversive memory. Stimulating MVP 2 neurons preferentially inhibits the odor-evoked activity of avoidance-directing MBONs and odor-driven avoidance behavior, whereas their inhibition enhances odor avoidance. In contrast, odor-evoked activity of MVP 2 neurons is elevated in hungry flies, and their feed-forward inhibition is required for expression of appetitive memory at all times. Moreover, imposing MVP 2 activity promotes inappropriate appetitive memory expression in food-satiated flies. Aversive learning and appetitive motivation therefore <b>toggle</b> alternate <b>modes</b> of a common feed-forward inhibitory MVP 2 pathway to promote conditioned odor avoidance or approach...|$|R

The twin modes of minimalist learning (snap) and slow drift towards the input pattern are applied alternately. Each neuron of the Snap-Drift Neural Network (SDNN) swaps between snap and drift modes when declining performance is indicated on that particular node, so that each node has its learning <b>mode</b> <b>toggled</b> independently of the other nodes. Learning on each node is also reinforced by enabling learning with a probability that decreases with increasing performance.
