25|$|Many {{contracts}} {{and other forms}} of legally binding agreement include a jurisdiction or arbitration clause specifying the parties' choice of venue for any litigation (called a forum selection clause). Then, choice of law clauses may specify which laws the court or tribunal should apply to each aspect of the dispute. <b>This</b> <b>matches</b> the substantive policy of freedom of contract. Judges have accepted that the principle of party autonomy allows the parties to select the law most appropriate to their transaction. This judicial acceptance of subjective intent excludes the traditional reliance on objective connecting factors; it also harms consumers as vendors often impose one-sided contractual terms selecting a venue far from the buyer's home or workplace.|$|E

500|$|The cup first {{appears in}} {{the records of the}} new Tudor dynasty under HenryVIII in 1521.

2500|$|Several {{models have}} shown how {{relatively}} simple peer-to-peer vocal interactions, such as imitation, can spontaneously self-organize {{a system of}} sounds shared by the whole population, and different in different populations. For example, models elaborated by Berrah et al., as well as de Boer, and recently reformulated using Bayesian theory, showed how a group of individuals playing imitation games can self-organize repertoires of vowel sounds which share substantial properties with human vowel systems. For example, in de Boer's model, initially vowels are generated randomly, but agents {{learn from each other}} as they interact repeatedly over time. Agent A chooses a vowel from its repertoire and produces it, inevitably with some noise. Agent B hears this vowel and chooses the closest equivalent from its own repertoire. To check whether this truly matches the original, B produces the vowel it thinks it has heard, whereupon A refers once again to its own repertoire to find the closest equivalent. If <b>this</b> <b>matches</b> the one it initially selected, the game is successful, otherwise it has failed.

2500|$|Students who are {{introduced}} to factoring as a primary method of solving quadratic equations might be surprised to know {{it is one of}} the newest methods of solving them. Vera Sanford points out in her A Short History of Mathematics (1930) that “In view of the present emphasis given to the solution of quadratic equations by factoring, it is interesting to note that this method was not used until Harriot’s work of 1631. Even in this case, however, the author ignores the factors that give rise to negative roots.” Harriot died in 1621, and like all his books, this one, Artis Analyticae Praxis ad Aequationes Algebraicas Resolvendas, was published after his death. An article on Harriot at the Univ of Saint Andrews math history web site says that in his personal writing on solving equations Harriot did use both positive and negative solutions, but his editor, Walter Warner, did not present this in his book. Harriot’s method of factoring may look different than what modern students expect. [...] In the first section (Sectio Prima) Harriot draws tables to illustrate the addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of monomial, binomial, and trinomial terms. [...] Then in the second section he shows a more direct multiplication that provides the foundation to his factoring method. He sets up the equation , and shows that <b>this</b> <b>matches</b> the form of multiplication he has previously provided as, ...|$|E

[...] He also described homosexuality as a choice, saying that children now have [...] "got {{to decide which}} gender to date"; <b>this</b> <b>matches</b> his previously expressed views that the gay lifestyle is a [...] "destructive lifestyle" [...] {{and that it is}} a [...] "behavior, it's not genetic."

[...] Philpot has also stated that [...] "half the adoptions I do are for gay people. And they're not bad people," [...] and that he loves homosexuals.

2500|$|The battle {{occurred}} after the Persian Revolt, {{which is known}} to have taken place in the summer of 553 BC. Based on scant sources the battle (which was in Hyrba) is believed to have taken place at least half a year after the revolt had already begun, probably in the beginning of winter in 552 BC. Astyages, the king of Medes, who is thought to have also been Cyrus's grandfather, had earlier turned down the request of Cyrus to leave his court and visit his parents again, as he had done several times earlier. Though his request to Astyages was not unusual, Cyrus had made the mistake of asking him right after the revolt that had happened, but through the pleading of the Persian servant, Oebares, Astyages let him visit his parents again. In Herodotus' version, in one of the first times Cyrus had gone to his parents, the Median general Harpagus had secretly sent a letter stuffed in a hare to Cyrus to plot a revolt, and Cyrus passed the letter on to his father. <b>This</b> <b>matches</b> the account of Nicolaus in which he says that Cambyses I had already assembled many troops well before the battle had started, and that he later despatched a small number to Cyrus's aid. Cyrus sent a message to his father saying [...] "... send at once 1000 cavalry and 5000 foot-soldiers to the city of Hyrba which lay on the way, and to arm the rest of the Persians as quickly as possible {{in such a way that}} it should seem to be done by command of the king. His true aims he did not communicate to him." [...] This also confirms the notion that the battle took place months, not days, after the revolt. Astyages' decision to let Cyrus return to his parents is considered by some to have changed history by eventually enabling the Persis province to become the most powerful state in the ancient world.|$|E
