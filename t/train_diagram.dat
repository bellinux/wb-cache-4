The post-war resumption (from 1952) was a joint operation by the French and Italian national rail operators (who provided the locomotives and the <b>train</b> <b>diagram)</b> and the Compagnie Internationale des Wagons-Lits who provided the carriages and staff. The name was changed from Rome Express to Palatino Express in 1969. In 1971 the Wagons-Lit Company gave up operating its own coaches, although it continued to provide the staff and ancillary services (such as laundry) for sleeper coaches operated by the national rail companies. The various European rail operators formed a joint operation known as TEN (Trans Euro Night, or the equivalent translation in other languages, such as Trans Euro Nuit (French), Trans Euro Notte (Italian), Trans Euro Nacht (German), and so on). The Palatino Express was marketed as a TEN service from the 1970s through to 1995. On {{the formation of the}} Artesia railway company in 1995, the Palatino Express became one of the new venture's key routes. Artesia was a joint venture by SNCF and Trenitalia. Artesia broke up in November 2011 owing to realignment of shared operating procedures between European rail companies. The Palatino Express became a victim of these changing circumstances, and was discontinued on 10 December 2011.

40|$|AbstractCalculating train {{timetable}} parameters correctly is {{a critical}} work in assessing the transport capacity of existing lines accurately. It provides important data to plan more feasible and stable train timetables. Most prior methods of determining <b>train</b> <b>diagram</b> parameters are a combination of computation of train traction and real tests, thus the parameters won’t change once determined. Obviously, there are several major weaknesses in these conventional methods: single fixed data, low accuracy, and in adaptation to dynamic changes in line conditions. Therefore, this paper proposes a new method of checking and correcting train timetable parameters based on locomotive running records. It makes the best of measured data from the Railway Information System. By statistically processing the measured data and synthetically comparing <b>train</b> <b>diagram</b> parameters in each stage, it provides important theories and data supporting for parameter corrections.
