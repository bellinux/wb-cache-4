5|$|Americium {{was first}} {{produced}} in 1944 {{by the group}} of Glenn T. Seaborg from Berkeley, California, at the Metallurgical Laboratory of the University of Chicago, {{a part of the}} Manhattan Project. Although it is the third element in the transuranic series, it was discovered fourth, after the heavier curium. The discovery was kept secret and only released to the public in November 1945. Most americium is produced by uranium or plutonium being bombarded with neutrons in nuclear reactors – one tonne of spent nuclear fuel contains about 100grams of americium. It is widely used in commercial ionization chamber smoke detectors, as well as in neutron sources and industrial gauges. Several unusual applications, such as nuclear batteries or fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion, have been proposed for the isotope 242mAm, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>as</b> yet hindered by the scarcity and high price of this nuclear isomer.|$|E
5|$|Features {{necessary}} for defending a territory {{such as the}} horns and broad-based skull of the modern black wildebeest, {{have been found in}} their fossil ancestors. The earliest known fossil remains are in sedimentary rock in Cornelia in the Orange Free State and date back about eight hundred thousand years. Fossils have also been reported from the Vaal River deposits, though it is unclear whether or not <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>as</b> ancient as those found in Cornelia. Horns of the black wildebeest have been found in sand dunes near Hermanus in South Africa. This is far beyond the recorded range of the species and {{it has been suggested that}} these animals may have migrated to that region from the Karoo.|$|E

5|$|This is {{the manner}} in which they are made; two (parallel) walls of very thick wooden (planking) are raised, and across the space between them are placed very thick planks (the bulkheads) secured {{longitudinally}} and transversely by means of large nails, each three ells in length. When these walls have thus been built, the lower deck is fitted in, and the ship is launched before the upper works are finished. The pieces of wood, and those parts of the hull, near the water(-line) serve for the crew to wash and to accomplish their natural necessities. On the sides of these pieces of wood also the oars are found; <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>as</b> big as masts, and are worked by 10 or 15 men (each), who row standing up.|$|E

25|$|Controversies {{concerning}} {{gifted education}} are varied and often highly politicized. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>as</b> basic as agreeing upon {{the appropriateness of}} the term 'gifted' or the definition of 'giftedness'.

25|$|Cape Chignecto defines Chignecto Bay whereas Cape Split {{defines the}} Minas Channel, {{leading to the}} Minas Basin.

25|$|The Extended Signal Peptide Region (ESPR) {{is found}} in the N-terminus of the signal {{peptides}} of proteins belonging to the Type V secretion systems. The function of the ESPR is to aid inner membrane translocation by acting as a temporary tether. This prevents the accumulation of misfolded proteins. The ESPR can be divided into individual regions, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>as</b> follows: N1 (charged), H1 (hydrophobic), N2, H2 and C (cleavage site) domains. N1 and H1 form the ESPR and have strong conservation.|$|E

25|$|Now {{this seems}} to be so {{explained}} in the writings called the Scriptures, that we might gain a great deal of profitable instruction, if we would read them under the regulating influence of the spirit of God. But they can afford no instruction to those who read them in their own ability; for, if they depend on their own interpretation, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>as</b> a dead letter, in so much, that those who profess to consider them the proper rule of faith and practice, will kill one another for the Scriptures' sake.|$|E
25|$|The {{evolutionary}} {{history of the}} passerine families and the relationships among them remained rather mysterious until the late 20th century. In many cases, passerine families were grouped together {{on the basis of}} morphological similarities that, it is now believed, are the result of convergent evolution, not a close genetic relationship. For example, the wrens of the Americas and Eurasia; those of Australia; and those of New Zealand look superficially similar and behave in similar ways, and yet belong to three far-flung branches of the passerine family tree; <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>as</b> unrelated as it is possible to be while remaining Passeriformes.|$|E

25|$|Sufism also notices angels as {{messengers}} {{between the}} divine {{and the human}} realms. But additionally, angels are viewed as the original state of a soul, before it touches the earthly plane. Those who stay in heaven, remain as angels. Angels rank lower than humans, because <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> <b>as</b> already flawless and desireless beings, not capable to love God like humans do. Then humans die, they can return to the heavenly spheres with all deeds, experiences and thoughts accomplished on the earthen plane. Furthermore, angels can inspire the Sufi. These angelic inspirations are also related to Khidr encounters.|$|E
25|$|The academy {{has eight}} halls of residence. The first {{four of these}} halls were inaugurated {{as part of the}} school's 1967 Annual Speech and Prize Giving Day activities.

The remaining four halls were inaugurated as part of the school's 83rd Founders' Day Celebration in 2014. They are named after the following prominent alumni; Nana Akuako Sarpong, Rt. Hon. Peter Ala Adjetey (a.k.a. Nana Otoafom Bekoe), Nana Wereko Ampem II, Nana Awuah Darko Ampem.|$|E
25|$|The Africanis needs neither pampering nor special food. One view {{holds that}} it is {{consistently}} healthy and has over the years developed a natural resistance against internal and external parasites, although they do appear to be very susceptible to introduced diseases such as distemper and parvo virus, and to tick-borne biliary. Others suffer from cancer. Rabies is very prevalent among the indigenous dog populations of southern Africa. It is therefore essential to ensure that any indigenous African dog, including the Europeanised Africanis, be inoculated annually for all the usual contagious diseases, and understood that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>as</b> susceptible to other diseases as any other domesticated dog.|$|E
