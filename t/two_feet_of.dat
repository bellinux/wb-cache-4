5|$|On April 13, 2008, {{rumors of}} a {{construction}} worker burying a Red Sox jersey in the concrete of the new Yankee Stadium were verified after anonymous tips led {{to the location of}} the jersey. The worker, identified as Gino Castignoli, had buried a David Ortiz jersey in what would become a service corridor in the hopes of cursing the new stadium. After extracting the jersey from underneath <b>two</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> concrete, Yankees' President Randy Levine indicated that the shirt would be donated to the Jimmy Fund to be auctioned for the charity long associated with the Red Sox. Whatever curse was intended failed to bear fruit with the Yankees winning the World Series in their first year at the new stadium.|$|E
5|$|Rainfall {{and storm}} surge flooded 20 homes in Terrebonne Parish. In addition, several homes in Lafouche Parish {{experienced}} flooding, including two with over <b>two</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> water. Numerous homes in Golden Meadow experienced flooding, as well. The flooding also forced the temporary closing of numerous roads across the state, including portions of U.S. Route 11 and Interstate 10. Flood waters {{from the storm}} cracked a water line in LaPlace, leaving nearly 30,000 residents and many businesses without tap water. The problem was expected to take little time to fix, though residents were advised to boil the water before drinking it. Matthew also left 2,500people without power {{for a short period}} of time. The storm's impact also closed several schools, forcing school administrators to reschedule plans for making up school closings caused by Hurricane Ivan one month earlier. In all, Matthew caused no deaths and $255,000 in damage (2004USD).|$|E

The French privateer Dart, of 14 guns and 100 men, had captured Nostra Senora del Carmen, Seleido, master, on the 19th as she was sailing from London to Lisbon. Foxhound sent her into Plymouth, where she ran ashore with <b>two</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> water in her hold.|$|E
25|$|On 12 August 1948, 6.25 inches (160mm) of {{rain fell}} in the area, the total for the week being 10.5 inches (265mm). Rain falling on the Lammermuir Hills surged into the Eye Water towards Reston, and the channel could not {{accommodate}} all of the water. The flood water then backed up the tunnel and flowed to sea in the opposite direction, towards Cockburnspath. The tunnel was flooded to within <b>two</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> the crown of the portal.|$|E

It cost the company as much to build Shoshone as it took to build three boats elsewhere. Although she was a large boat and expensive, Shoshone drew less than <b>two</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> water and had no difficulty navigating the river to Old's Ferry, Idaho.|$|E

25|$|Beginning on October 26 a Nor'easter {{struck the}} area and the storm lasted for three days, {{bringing}} with it high winds and torrential rain. With <b>two</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> water over most of Mud Island and similar conditions on Province and Carpenter's Islands, the mutual cannon fire stopped as both sides {{tried to find a}} dry place. By November 1, the Americans had the British army in Philadelphia effectively under blockade. Howe's troops were short of food, rum, clothing, and money. Montresor complained that he lacked adequate artillery and ammunition. The British were compelled to send supplies into Philadelphia via convoys of flatboats. To avoid being sunk by the guns of Fort Mifflin and the Pennsylvania Navy, the boats had to make the attempt in the night and maintain total silence. Hessian Captain Johann von Ewald noted that in order to hold the sailors to their dangerous work, they were made completely drunk.|$|E
25|$|In the Battle of Germantown on 4 October 1777, Proctor's {{guns were}} {{commanded}} by Captain-Lieutenant Brewer and Lieutenants Barker and Ritter. During the fighting, British {{soldiers of the}} 40th Foot took refuge in the Chew House. Two of Proctor's guns and two captured 6-pound guns began firing at the house. They quickly blasted open the front doors, but unknown to the gunners, {{the front of the}} house was buttressed by <b>two</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> stonework that resisted their round shot. The gunners also fired grapeshot at the second floor in an attempt to suppress the return fire. The 1st and 3rd New Jersey Regiments repeatedly tried to storm the building but they were driven off with heavy losses. During the action, four cannons from Brigadier General William Woodford's Virginia Brigade opened fire on the other side of the house, blowing open the back door and causing much damage. Some cannonballs passed entirely through the house by the windows, causing the Americans to believe that the defenders had their own artillery. The British successfully defended the Chew House and were rescued when the American army retreated.|$|E
25|$|In 1945 the Royal Netherlands Army got {{permission}} from the Canadian government to take free possession of all Ram tanks in army dumps on Dutch territory. Those not already converted into Kangaroos were used to equip the 1st and 2nd Tank Battalion (1e en 2e Bataljon Vechtwagens), the very first Dutch tank units. These had a nominal organic strength of 53 each. However {{it proved to be}} impossible to ready enough tanks to attain this strength because the vehicles were in a very poor state of maintenance. In 1947 the UK provided 44 Ram tanks from its stocks, that were in a better condition. Forty of these had been rebuilt with the British 75mm gun; four were OP/Command vehicles with a dummy gun. This brought the operational total for that year to just 73, including two Mark Is. In 1950 only fifty of these were listed as present. The Ram tanks (together with the Sherman tanks of the three other tank battalions, in part simply taken without permission) were replaced by Centurion tanks leased by the U.S. Government in 1952. Some Ram tanks were used in the 1950s as static pillboxes in the IJssel Line, their hulls dug in and embedded within <b>two</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> concrete.|$|E

500|$|Now {{clear of}} the {{immediate}} danger of the ice, Riou {{found himself in a}} desperate situation. There was <b>two</b> <b>feet</b> <b>of</b> water in the hold and more was rushing in, while the sea was rising and a gale had sprung up. The pumps were manned, but could not keep up with the influx of water, and by midnight there was 6 feet of water in the hold. At dawn on Christmas Day, an attempt was made to fother the hull, which involved lowering an oakum-packed studding sail over the side to cover the gash in the hull and slow the flooding. This was temporarily successful and by 11 o'clock the pumps had been able to reduce the water to a level of 19inches. The respite was short-lived, as the sail split under the pressure of the water and the water level began to rise again. [...] A number of seaman requested permission to take to the ship's boats. Riou convinced them to stay, but another attempt to fother the hull with another sail failed when the sail immediately ripped. By nightfall on 25 December, the water in the hold had risen to 7 feet, and the ship was rolling violently, allowing water to pour over the ship's side. Riou ordered the stores, guns and livestock to be thrown overboard in an attempt to lighten the ship, but was injured when his hand was crushed by a falling cask while trying to clear the bread-room. By morning the next day, the ship was settling by the stern, while the sails had been torn away in the gale. Again the seamen, this time joined by the convicts, requested to be allowed to take to the boats. Riou at last agreed to this, well aware that there were not enough boats for everyone, and announced 'As for me, I have determined to remain in the ship, and shall endeavour to make my presence useful {{as long as there is}} any occasion for it.' ...|$|E

An autopsy revealed that Kim had died because of hypothermia and that his body had suffered no incapacitating physical injuries. The medical examiner who performed the autopsy guessed that Kim had died roughly two days after leaving the vehicle.|$|E
