40|$|<b>The</b> mobile <b>telecommunications</b> <b>industry</b> {{contributes}} substantially to the Australian economy. In {{addition to}} its direct contributions, it drives productivity gains throughout the economy according to this 2007 Access Economics report. <b>The</b> mobile <b>telecommunications</b> <b>industry</b> contributes substantially to the Australian economy. In {{addition to its}} direct contributions, it drives productivity gains throughout the economy. This characteristic of <b>the</b> mobile <b>telecommunications</b> <b>industry</b> contrasts with other key sectors such as mining, which makes a significant direct contribution to the economy but much smaller indirect contributions. The report says the direct contribution of <b>the</b> mobile <b>telecommunications</b> <b>industry</b> to <b>the</b> Australian economy in 2005 - 06 was $ 5. 8 billion, with its share of value added to the whole communications industry found to be 24. 9 %. Access Economics says the indirect or spill-over effects of mobile <b>telecommunications</b> on <b>the</b> broader Gross Domestic Product {{is estimated to be}} $ 6. 4 billion – greater than the direct economic impact. The ubiquity of mobiles has transformed the way businesses operate and their employees work in almost every industry and sector of the Australian economy. This means the economic impact of <b>the</b> mobile <b>telecommunications</b> <b>industry</b> encompasses its flow-on impacts on all other industries. The report has also produced a forward estimate of the economy-wide benefits arising from mobile data use made possible by 3 G networks. Given the current adoption trend, the report suggests the increasing uptake of 3 G technology and increase in mobile data traffic could add an additional $ 1 billion to GDP by 2010...|$|R
25|$|A T-coil {{consists}} of a metal core (or rod) around which ultra-fine wire is coiled. T-coils are also called induction coils because when the coil is placed in a magnetic field, an alternating electric current is induced in the wire (Ross, 2002b; Ross, 2004). The T-coil detects magnetic energy and transduces (converts) it to electrical energy. In the United States, <b>the</b> <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>Industry</b> Association's TIA-1083 standard, specifies how analog handsets can interact with telecoil devices, to ensure the optimal performance.|$|E

25|$|Although A-weighting {{with a slow}} rms detector, as {{commonly}} used in sound level meters is frequently used when measuring noise in audio circuits, a different weighting curve, ITU-R 468 weighting uses a psophometric weighting curve and a quasi-peak detector.

Mobile telephony has the advantage of reaching all areas at a lower cost, and the total number of mobile lines is almost two times that of landlines, with an estimation of 63 million lines.
