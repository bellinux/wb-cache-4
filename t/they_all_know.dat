25|$|There {{is common}} {{knowledge}} that all players meet these conditions, including this one. So, not only must each player know the other players meet the conditions, but also they must know that <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> that they meet them, and know that {{they know that they}} know that they meet them, and so on.|$|E
500|$|Various {{historians have}} given Adams {{recognition}} {{as an important}} figure from {{the early years of}} baseball. Thorn has written that he [...] "may be counted as first among the Fathers of Baseball." [...] O'Maxfield said of Adams: [...] "Without , we wouldn't have the game we know and love as baseball today." [...] The [...] "father" [...] label was rejected by Ryczek; he wrote that Adams did not conceive the sport, but called him a [...] "collaborator" [...] in its development. On July 31, 2014, the Society for American Baseball Research announced that it had chosen Adams as its 2014 [...] "Overlooked 19th Century Baseball Legend". Eric Miklich has called him worthy of induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame for his role as a pioneer. He says of Adams, [...] "Should he be in the Hall of Fame? Absolutely. You ask anyone who knows about 19th century baseball. They'll laugh at Cartwright; Abner Doubleday, they won't even talk about; but <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> Doc Adams. He was the glue that held things together {{in the early part of}} baseball." [...] Adams did not appear on a Baseball Hall of Fame ballot until 2016, when he was up for consideration on the Hall's Pre-Integration Era Committee ballot. Ten of the 16 committee members supported him, two fewer than the number needed for induction.|$|E
6000|$|Then I {{went back}} to the fireplace, and did some more thinking. There was no sense in supposing that they had made a mistake. <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> this restaurant, and <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> the time. In a moment, I said to myself: ...|$|R
60|$|Carl {{selected}} Rose, as <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> he would. <b>They</b> {{stood together}} now, holding hands.|$|R
60|$|Of course <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> why it {{was that}} the conduct of the Squire was so like the conduct of a madman.|$|R
2500|$|The airport {{designator}} [...] "SUX" [...] {{has been}} contentious. [...] Sioux City Mayor Craig Berenstein in 2002 described SUX as an [...] "embarrassment" [...] to the city. [...] After petitioning the FAA for a changed airport identifier in 1998 and 2002, authorities found the alternatives offered - GWU, GYO, GYT, SGV, and GAY - to be unappealing, and elected {{to stay with}} SUX. In October 2007, airport board member Dave Bernstein proposed embracing the identifier, saying [...] "Let's {{make the best of}} it. [...] I think we have the opportunity {{to turn it into a}} positive," [...] and noting [...] "I've got buddies that I went to college with in different cities that can't even remember their own birthdays, but <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> the Sioux City designator — SUX." [...] The airport now sells merchandise with the words [...] "Fly SUX".|$|E

6000|$|... "Faix, <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> {{well enough}} by this time," [...] and the witness {{looked up to}} the jury, [...] "--or else they oughtn't to be there, any way." ...|$|E
60|$|Though {{there was}} no {{apparent}} sense in his words, <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> that {{he was referring to}} June. His eyes searched his son's face.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I?' cried Lady Kelsey. 'I've been {{suffering}} agonies.' <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> {{to what she}} referred, and the remark gave Boulger an opportunity to speak to Dick Lomas.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, they know," [...] said Adam. [...] "It {{was only}} {{for the sake of}} show that they caught the people. Assuredly <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> it was bunao [make-up]." ...|$|R
6000|$|He looked puzzled, and said, [...] "Sir, <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> it. Molly Owens, {{that was}} his foster-mother, saw the fairies bear him off on a broomstick up the chimney." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Which shows my wisdom. The men in our {{garrison}} are mercenaries, all {{attached to}} us {{only because we}} pay them. <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> who she is and what her wealth." ...|$|E
60|$|KNOX. I don't {{know why}} you bothered about him. There are such a lot of fellows who want his job and <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> {{they could do it}} much better than he can.|$|E
60|$|The chief stared haughtily {{while the}} other Indians sauntered nearer. <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> how the Shawnee had got the animals, and now awaited {{the outcome of the}} white man's challenge.|$|R
60|$|The {{business}} was opened by {{the announcement of}} what <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> before, that the proceeds of the fancy fair amounted to one hundred and forty-nine pounds fifteen shillings and tenpence.|$|R
6000|$|... "What's {{the odds}} of that? <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>knows</b> that. Bearside! Why should I be ashamed of Bearside? I'll do a deal better with Bearside than I would with that old woman, Masters." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not a thing," [...] was the {{confident}} reply. [...] "We are two English newspaper correspondents, and there isn't {{a thing to}} be found anywhere that's not in keeping, except my rather large make-up outfit and my somewhat mixed wardrobe. I am not the only newspaper correspondent who goes in for that, though. Then there's Felicia. <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> who she is and <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> that she's my sister. Anyhow, even if I do get into trouble up at the Villa Mimosa, I can't see that I shall be looked upon as {{anything more than a}} prying newspaper correspondent. They can't hang me for that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All the same, sir. <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> {{their work}} well, {{and of course}} if there is {{anything}} to be done aloft, our own men go up. I don't think any of them will beat us in smartness." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} that will end fishing and {{swimming}} for a while," [...] said Biggs. [...] "The soldiers never go near the falls, for <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> the danger, but Colonel Fairfield is too strict to run any chances." ...|$|E
60|$|Lucy put {{her hand}} on his arm to quieten him. It seemed that Alec could not find words. There was a horrible silence, but <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> what he had to tell them.|$|R
60|$|KNOX. [wandering to {{the window}} arm in arm with her] Just {{look at the people}} in the street, going up and down as if nothing had happened. It seems unnatural, as if <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> and didnt care.|$|R
5000|$|According to Standish, [...] "Anyone who is {{acquainted with}} the facts and has any amount of logical {{reasoning}} can not avoid the conclusion that neither Cook, nor Peary, nor Byrd reached the North Pole; and <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{know some}} men of this tribe," [...] he said, [...] "but {{not all of}} them--though <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> me by report. You may at least depend on my {{influence}} being used to the utmost in behalf of your friends. Come, we will descend." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I know 'em all and <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> me," [...] {{answered}} the hunter. [...] "I've watched over many a trail waitin' {{for one of}} 'em. If I can ever get a shot at any of 'em I'll give up Injuns and go farmin'. Good night, Betty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{hardly a}} man in that place that wouldn't have been. <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> me by sight--and some of 'em better. You didn't see 'em {{grinning}} when I came up to you, but I did. My God--it's awful--it's awful I...." [...] She burst into violent weeping, long deferred.|$|E
60|$|Every one {{had thought}} this the best joke ever, for, of course, <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> that Reddy Fox and Shadow the Weasel {{could not get}} out past the {{thousand}} little spears hidden in the long coat of Prickly Porky.|$|R
6000|$|... "Fine!" [...] {{came back}} the answer, and then the senator's son {{commenced}} a song <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> well, which was sung {{to the tune of}} [...] "Auld Lang Syne." [...] The girls knew the song, too, and readily joined in.|$|R
60|$|The last {{appointed}} footstep sounded now {{upon the}} stairs. <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> it. It was Mr Pecksniff's; and Mr Pecksniff {{was in a}} hurry too, for he came bounding up with such uncommon expedition that he stumbled twice or thrice.|$|R
6000|$|... “Oh, Miguel!” she cried. “I {{tell you}} a secret. Of course {{it is no secret}} any more, for now <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> it, up there at the house. Meeldred Travers, the girl from New York, is not Meeldred Travers. She is the child of Leighton the smuggler—she is Meeldred Leighton!” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here comes Sir Charles, at any rate!" [...] the Duchess exclaimed. [...] "Really, I {{think we}} shall have to go in. We can leave a message for Dicky; <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> him at this place. I am afraid {{he is one of}} those {{shocking}} young men who entertain the theatrical profession here to supper." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Somers, radiantly reappearing: [...] "Say what?" [...] She has hidden {{the traces}} of her tears from every one but the ladies by a light {{application}} of powder, and she knows that <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>know</b> she has been crying, and this makes her a little more smiling. [...] "Say what?" [...] She addresses the company in general rather than Campbell.|$|E
60|$|<b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> that a {{pleasure}} yacht like the Lotus was well supplied with small arms, {{and that at}} the first intimation of danger there would be plenty of men aboard to repel assault, and, in all probability, with entire success.|$|R
60|$|They had striven {{to prove}} the {{prisoner}} bad-tempered. She {{did not need to}} prove anything of the sort concerning John Borg. <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> his terrible fits of anger; <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> that his temper was proverbial in the community; that it had prevented him having friends and had made him many enemies. Was it not very probable, therefore, that the masked men were two such enemies? As to what particular motive actuated these two men, she could not say; but it rested with them, the judges, to <b>know</b> whether in <b>all</b> Alaska there were or were not two men whom John Borg could have given cause sufficient for them to take his life.|$|R
60|$|I think <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>knew</b> and dreaded {{what was}} coming. I looked round at their strange faces. When I saw their wincing attitudes and the furtive dread in their bright eyes, I {{wondered}} that I had ever believed {{them to be}} men.|$|R
