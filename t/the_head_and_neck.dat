5|$|On June 11, 2013, Greinke {{was hit in}} <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> area by Arizona Diamondbacks pitcher Ian Kennedy, {{leading to}} a bench-clearing brawl. Because Greinke did not {{participate}} in the brawl, he was unaffected.|$|E
5|$|The adult plumage is {{a uniform}} black, with the {{exception}} of a frill of white feathers nearly surrounding the base of the neck and, especially in the male, large patches or bands of white on the wings which do not appear until the completion of the bird's first moulting. <b>The</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> are red to blackish-red and have few feathers. <b>The</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> are meticulously kept clean by the bird, and their baldness is an adaptation for hygiene, allowing the skin to be exposed to the sterilizing effects of dehydration and ultraviolet light at high altitudes. The crown of the head is flattened. In the male, the head is crowned with a dark red caruncle or comb, while the skin of his neck lies in folds, forming a wattle. The skin of <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> is capable of flushing noticeably in response to emotional state, which serves to communicate between individuals. Juveniles have a grayish-brown general coloration, blackish head and neck skin, and a brown ruff.|$|E
5|$|If it is {{necessary}} to walk near the nest, wearing a broad-brimmed or legionnaire's hat or using an umbrella will deter attacking birds, but beanies and bicycle helmets are of little value as birds attack the sides of <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} support the robust head, the neck of Hatzegopteryx was likely {{strongly}} muscled. On the occipital bones, the nuchal lines, which serve as muscular attachments, are very well-developed and bear prominent scars. These conceivably supported the transversospinalis muscles, which aid in extension and flexion of <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck.</b> Likewise, the opisthotic process, neural spines, and zygapophyses all {{appeared to have been}} large and robust (with the latter bearing many pits and edges that likely represent muscle scars), and the basioccipital tuberosities were long; these all serve as points of attachment for various muscles of <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck.</b> Although not entirely unmuscled, the neck of Arambourgiania probably would not have been as extensively muscled as that of Hatzegopteryx.|$|E
5|$|Originally, Borsuk-Białynicka {{assumed that}} in {{standard}} position the neck was horizontal or slanted slightly downward. This {{was based on}} the reconstruction of the nuchal ligament, which runs atop of the cervical and dorsal vertebrae and serves to support the weight of <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck.</b> Although an S-curved, swan-like ascending neck was envisaged in several subsequent reconstructions following similar depictions of better known sauropods, recent studies argue that sauropod necks were relatively straight and were carried more horizontally.|$|E
5|$|Strength {{testing of}} these muscles can be {{measured}} during a neurological examination to assess function of the spinal accessory nerve. Poor strength or limited movement are suggestive of damage, which can result {{from a variety of}} causes. Injury to the spinal accessory nerve is most commonly caused by medical procedures that involve <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck.</b> Injury can cause wasting of the shoulder muscles, winging of the scapula, and weakness of shoulder abduction and external rotation.|$|E

5|$|The condor's {{head and}} neck have few feathers, and the skin of <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> is capable of {{flushing}} noticeably in response to emotional state, a capability that can serve as communication between individuals. The skin color varies from yellowish to a glowing reddish-orange. The birds do not have true syringeal vocalizations. They can make a few hissing or grunting sounds only heard when very close.|$|E
5|$|The next bout {{was between}} the team of Diamond Dallas Page (DDP) and Monty Brown and Team Canada (Bobby Roode and Eric Young), who were {{accompanied}} by Coach D'Amore and Johnny Devine. DDP and Brown were {{the winners of the}} contest after DDP grabbed Young around <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck,</b> jumped forward and landed on his back to force Young's face into the mat and his shoulder. DDP followed by covering Young for the pinfall and the win.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} related genus Barosaurus, the very long neck of Diplodocus {{is the source}} of much {{controversy}} among scientists. A 1992 Columbia University study of diplodocid neck structure indicated that the longest necks would have required a 1.6-ton heart — a tenth of the animal's body weight. The study proposed that animals like these would have had rudimentary auxiliary 'hearts' in their necks, whose only purpose was to pump blood up to the next 'heart'. Some argue that the near-horizontal posture of <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> would have eliminated the problem of supplying blood to the brain, as it would not be elevated.|$|E

5|$|It is a {{large black}} vulture with a ruff of white {{feathers}} surrounding {{the base of the}} neck and, especially in the male, large white patches on the wings. <b>The</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> are nearly featherless, and are a dull red color, which may flush and therefore change color in response to the bird's emotional state. In the male, there is a wattle on the neck and a large, dark red comb or caruncle on the crown of the head. Unlike most birds of prey, the male is larger than the female.|$|E
5|$|James Spotila et al. (1991) {{concludes that}} the large body size of sauropods would have made them unable to {{maintain}} high metabolic rates because {{they would not have}} been able to release enough heat. They assumed sauropods had a reptilian respiratory system. Wedel says that an avian system would have allowed it to dump more heat. Some scientists state that the heart would have had trouble sustaining sufficient blood pressure to oxygenate the brain. Others suggest that the near-horizontal posture of <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> would have eliminated the problem of supplying blood to the brain because it would not have been elevated.|$|E
5|$|Large and {{predominantly}} white, {{the king}} vulture has gray to black ruff, flight, and tail feathers. <b>The</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> are bald, with the skin color varying, including yellow, orange, blue, purple, and red. The king vulture {{has a very}} noticeable orange fleshy caruncle on its beak. This vulture is a scavenger and it often makes the initial cut into a fresh carcass. It also displaces smaller New World vulture species from a carcass. King vultures {{have been known to}} live for up to 30 years in captivity.|$|E

5|$|Primary Secretory Otitis Media (PSOM), {{also known}} as glue ear, {{consists}} of a highly viscous mucus plug which fills the dog's middle ear and may cause the tympanic membrane to bulge. PSOM has been reported almost exclusively in Cavaliers, and it may affect over half of them. Because the pain and other sensations in <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> areas, resulting from PSOM, are similar to some symptoms caused by syringomyelia (SM), some examining veterinarians have mis-diagnosed SM in Cavaliers which actually have PSOM and not SM.|$|E
5|$|Raath (1972) {{noted the}} {{discovery}} of nine fragmentary carnivorous teeth near the pelvic region of the skeleton. He argued that the Vulcanodon carcass might have been embedded with <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> bended backwards above the pelvis, a posture called death pose that is frequently seen in dinosaur skeletons. The teeth {{would have been the}} only preserved elements of the skull. However, as shown by Cooper (1984), these teeth do not pertain to Vulcanodon but to a theropod dinosaur that may have scavenged on the Vulcanodon carcass.|$|E
5|$|The {{base coat}} of the jaguar is {{generally}} a tawny yellow, but can range to reddish-brown and black, {{for most of}} the body. However, the ventral areas are white. The cat is covered in rosettes for camouflage in the dappled light of its forest habitat. The spots vary over individual coats and between individual jaguars: rosettes may include one or several dots, and the shapes of the dots vary. The spots on <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> are generally solid, as are those on the tail, where they may merge to form a band.|$|E

5|$|A 2004 review {{reported}} 46% of bites occurring on distal extremities of the limbs, 25% on proximal {{areas of}} limbs (upper arms and thighs), 21% on the trunk, and 7% {{on the head}} or neck. In some cases the same spider bites a victim multiple times. Historically, victims were often bitten on the genitalia, though this phenomenon disappeared as outhouses were superseded by plumbed indoor toilets. Conversely, bites on <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> have increased with use of safety helmets and ear muffs. Precautions to avoid being bitten include wearing gloves and shoes while gardening, not leaving clothes on the floor, and shaking out gloves or shoes before putting them on. Also, children can be educated not to touch spiders.|$|E
5|$|At {{medium to}} close range, an adult red-throated loon in either {{breeding}} or non-breeding plumage is usually easily recognised. However, in certain light conditions, {{at certain times}} in its moulting cycle, or at greater distances, it may be mistaken for another species—most commonly the black-throated loon, but also occasionally the great crested grebe. It shows more white on <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck</b> than does the black-throated loon, and—provided it is not sitting low in the water—tends to show more white on the flanks as well. If it is sitting lower in the water, so that the white on the flanks is reduced to a patch on the rear flank (thus resembling {{the pattern of the}} black-throated loon), that patch tends to be less clearly defined than the comparative patch on the black-throated.|$|E
5|$|Greg Paul (1988) {{proposed}} that the horns were butting weapons and that the small orbita would have minimized the possibility of hurting the eyes while fighting. Gerardo Mazzetta and colleagues (1998) suggested that Carnotaurus used its horns in a way similar to rams. They calculated that the neck musculature {{was strong enough to}} absorb the force of two individuals colliding with their heads frontally at a speed of 5.7m/s each. Fernando Novas (2009) interpreted several skeletal features as adaptations for delivering blows with the head. He suggested that the shortness of the skull might have made head movements quicker by reducing the moment of inertia, while the muscular neck would have allowed strong head blows. He also noted an enhanced rigidity and strength of the spinal column that may have evolved to withstand shocks conducted by <b>the</b> <b>head</b> <b>and</b> <b>neck.</b>|$|E
