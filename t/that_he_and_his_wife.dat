5|$|In his {{writings}} Henson {{referred to his}} two regrets in life. The first {{was that he had}} not been at a public school, a fact to which he ascribed his lifelong feeling of being an outsider. The second regret was <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> had been unable to have children. They unofficially adopted a succession of poor boys and paid for their education. At least one of them became a priest and was ordained by Henson.|$|E
5|$|As {{the senator}} {{discussed}} their finances, the telecast again showed Pat Nixon, fixedly watching her husband. Pat Nixon later stated that her rapt gaze {{was because she}} did not know exactly what he would say, and wanted to hear. Nixon detailed their assets and liabilities: the mortgaged home in Washington; the similarly mortgaged home in California, then occupied by his parents. The loans from his parents and from Riggs Bank. The borrowed-against life insurance policy on the senator; no insurance on his wife or children. The two-year-old Oldsmobile and the family furniture, and <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> owned no stocks or bonds.|$|E
5|$|Grimsby's ageing {{team made}} a bright start in 1952–53 with five {{straight}} wins but eventually slipped and finished in fifth place. In 1953–54, Shankly became disillusioned when the board {{could not give}} him money to buy new players. He was reluctant to promote some promising reserves because of loyalty to the older players (a fault that was to resurface at Liverpool years later) and he finally resigned in January 1954, citing the board's lack of ambition as his main reason. In his autobiography, he said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> were feeling homesick in Grimsby and, when an opportunity came to manage Workington, he was attracted to the challenge partly because they would be closer to Scotland.|$|E

5|$|In early 2012, the party's Central Commission for Discipline Inspection bolstered its {{presence}} within Chongqing as the city's leaders came under investigation. Much {{of the attention}} focused on Bo's police chief, Wang Lijun, {{who may have been}} under investigation for his role in a corruption case in Liaoning. Growing scrutiny over the city's wiretapping operation against senior leaders also likely fell mainly on Wang. Although details are scarce, several sources have suggested that Wang's resentment against Bo grew amidst the investigations—resentment that was compounded when Wang realized <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> had also been targets of wiretapping under Bo's orders.|$|E
5|$|The loss of Icke's {{position}} with Hereford meant <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> {{had to sell}} their home, and for several weeks they lived apart, each moving in with their parents. In 1973 Icke found {{a job as a}} reporter with the weekly Leicester Advertiser, through a contact who was a sports editor at the Daily Mail. He moved on to the Leicester News Agency, and through them did some work for BBC Radio Leicester as their football reporter, then worked his way up through the Loughborough Monitor, the Leicester Mercury, and BRMB Radio in Birmingham.|$|E
5|$|The {{two policemen}} {{question}} five {{people in and}} around Rajan's house, {{most of whom are}} his family members or friends. The first to be questioned is Rajan's wife Usha, who is unable to speak because of her grief. Sivanandam and Naidu feel embarrassed and are reluctant to question her further. They begin interrogating Chinnaiah, who reported the gunshot. Chinnaiah proposes that the killer is probably Pattabi, Rajan's younger brother, and recalls a confrontation between them: Pattabi asked for his share of the family property but Rajan refused his request, feeling <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> would squander it. Chinnaiah concludes that this may have prompted Pattabi to kill Rajan.|$|E

5|$|Boyce was a multi-millionaire by {{the early}} 1900s and by 1909 became more {{interested}} in civic affairs and less in finance. He also began to travel, often as part of hunting expeditions. He leased hunting lodges at Fort Sisseton, South Dakota, where he had hunted as a young man. He often hosted friends and relatives, especially his son, for activities such as hunting, fishing, dinner, poker, and plentiful liquor. These changes {{may have been in}} part caused by the destruction of his Ottawa mansion by fire in early 1908, which was soon rebuilt, followed three months later by the sale of his Marseilles paper mill due to a new law that prevented railroads from negotiating with shippers, and his September 1908 announcement <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife,</b> Mary Jane, were separating.|$|E
5|$|By {{the start}} of 1973, John Lennon began {{distancing}} himself from {{the political and social}} issues he had embraced in the previous 18 months. It was also around this time <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife,</b> Yoko Ono, were going through marital problems. As Ono was completing her fourth album, Feeling the Space, Lennon decided he also wanted to record a new album, and liked the studio musicians that their assistant and production coordinator May Pang had assembled for Ono's album. Shortly thereafter, he asked Pang to book them for his sessions. Wanting to produce an album that would be more accepted than his previous politically charged commercial flop Some Time in New York City, Lennon began writing and demoing a few songs for Mind Games in his Greenwich Village apartment. He began composing after a period of almost a year of not writing any material.|$|E
5|$|In February1968, he lectured at the University of Southern California {{and worked}} for a law firm in Los Angeles. After <b>that,</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> Virginia Lee Jowell and their eight {{children}} traveled the Pacific in a homemade boat, living in Hawaii, the Marshall Islands, the Federated States of Micronesia, and finally in Guam. He met his wife in 1944 in Orlando, Florida, where she was a P-47 Thunderbolt ferry pilot {{and member of the}} Women Airforce Service Pilots. In Pohnpei, Hagerstrom practiced law, while his wife taught at a college. They eventually returned to the United States and settled in Mansfield, Louisiana, and after living there for a few years, James Hagerstrom died of stomach cancer on June 25, 1994, in nearby Shreveport. He was survived by his wife, as well as six of his children: Mitchell Anne, Eric, Kristen, Tereza, Mark, and Anastasia. On July 26, he was buried with full military honors at Arlington National Cemetery.|$|E

5|$|Larry Vaughn {{arrives at}} the Brody house before Brody returns home, and informs Ellen <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>wife</b> are leaving Amity. Before he leaves, he tells Ellen that he always thought they {{would have made a}} great couple. When Brody and Quint return to sea the {{following}} day, the shark starts ramming the boat, but Quint is able to harpoon it several times. The shark leaps {{out of the water and}} onto the stern of the Orca, ripping a huge hole in the aft section and causing the boat to begin to sink. Quint plunges another harpoon into the shark, but as it falls back into the water, his foot gets entangled in the rope, and he is dragged underwater to his death as he drowns. Brody, now floating on a seat cushion, spots the shark swimming towards him and prepares for his death. However, just as the shark gets within a few feet of him, it succumbs to its many wounds, rolls over in the water, and dies before it can kill Brody. The great fish sinks down out of sight, dragging Quint's still entangled body behind it. Brody manages to paddle back to shore on his makeshift float, the lone survivor of the ordeal.|$|E
