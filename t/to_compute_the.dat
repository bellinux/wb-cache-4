5|$|Einstein's {{equations}} are {{the centerpiece}} of general relativity. They provide a precise formulation {{of the relationship between}} spacetime geometry and the properties of matter, using the language of mathematics. More concretely, they are formulated using the concepts of Riemannian geometry, in which the geometric properties of a space (or a spacetime) are described by a quantity called a metric. The metric encodes the information needed <b>to</b> <b>compute</b> <b>the</b> fundamental geometric notions of distance and angle in a curved space (or spacetime).|$|E
5|$|Even some nonhuman animals show {{a limited}} ability to add, {{particularly}} primates.

5|$|From {{the point}} of view of sheaf cohomology, the Mayer–Vietoris {{sequence}} is related to Čech cohomology. Specifically, it arises from the degeneration of the spectral sequence that relates Čech cohomology to sheaf cohomology (sometimes called the Mayer–Vietoris spectral sequence) in the case where the open cover used <b>to</b> <b>compute</b> <b>the</b> Čech cohomology consists of two open sets. This spectral sequence exists in arbitrary topoi.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of the distance and proper motion of this system can be used <b>to</b> <b>compute</b> <b>the</b> transverse velocity of IK Pegasi as 16.9 km/s. The third component, the heliocentric radial velocity, can be measured by the average red-shift (or blue-shift) of the stellar spectrum. The General Catalogue of Stellar Radial Velocities lists a radial velocity of -11.4 km/s for this system. The {{combination of}} these two motions gives a space velocity of 20.4 km/s relative to the Sun.|$|E
