25|$|Sexual {{harassment}} is defined as, when any verbal, non-verbal or physical action {{is used to}} change a victim's sexual status against {{the will of the}} victim and resulting in the victim feeling inferior or hurting the victim's dignity. Man and woman are looked upon as equal, and any action <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> balance in status with the differences in sex as a tool, is also sexual harassment. In the workplace, jokes, remarks, etc., are only deemed discriminatory if the employer has stated so in their written policy. Law number 1385 of December 21, 2005 regulates this area.|$|E
25|$|The book The Dance of Change states {{there are}} many reasons why an {{organization}} may have trouble in transforming itself into a learning organization. The first is that an organization does not have enough time. Employees and management may have other issues that take priority over <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> culture of their organization. The team {{may not be able to}} commit the time if an institution does not have the appropriate help or training. For an organization to be able to change, it needs to know the steps necessary to solve the problems it faces. As a solution, a mentor or coach who is well versed in the learning organization concept may be necessary.|$|E

He said that current income tax laws assume that people are guilty and they must then prove they are innocent, and he believes this aspect of tax law is unfair. However, he said that he prefers to work for improved tax laws by getting elected to Congress and <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> laws themselves rather than simply not paying the tax.|$|E

Jeremy Strick, director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, described the feminist art movement as [...] "the most influential international movement of any during the postwar period", and Peggy Phelan says that it [...] "brought about the most far-reaching transformations in both artmaking and art writing {{over the past four}} decades". Feminist artist Judy Chicago, who created The Dinner Party, a set of vulva-themed ceramic plates in the 1970s, said in 2009 to ARTnews, [...] "There is still an institutional lag and an insistence on a male Eurocentric narrative. We are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> future: to get girls and boys to realize that women's art is not an exception—it's a normal part of art history."

500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 2009, {{a change}} {{occurred}} in Susan's personality. During the surrogacy storyline, viewers saw Susan become the [...] "mother-in-law from hell". Woodbune {{said that it was}} challenging <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> character of Susan. During clashes with her son-in-law Daniel Fitzgerald (Brett Tucker), Susan was seen becoming controlling and bossy. Woodburne said [...] "As the story progressed it became apparent {{that we were going to}} have to go to the extremes of the less attractive qualities of our characters. We talked about it and decided to go for it – he would be the overbearing husband and Susan the mother-in-law from hell". Woodburne added that Susan is acting out of love for her daughter and for Libby's desire to have a child. In July 2011, Woodburne told a writer for Channel 5 that she still found the role of Susan challenging. She explained that she likes Susan because she adapts well and takes all the things that happen to her in her stride. Woodburne said Karl and Susan are now less naive and exuberant due to the things they have gone through. When asked what the future holds for her character, Woodburne stated [...] "You know, I'm kind of with Susan. I like the Kennedy house when it's full of noisy kids, being naughty and creating havoc. I like it loud and messy. So that would be my hope, that we get a bit of that happening again." ...|$|E
500|$|I'm Going to Tell You a Secret {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. O'Brien noted how the film revealed a [...] "strange isolation {{at the cost}} of stardom" [...] from Madonna. She complimented the scenes featuring her father, and the scenes where Madonna was not self-conscious, like when she interacts with her children, talks about her [...] "fat Italian thighs" [...] and also the performance in rain at Dublin. O'Brien criticized other portions of the film, which she said was [...] "affected" [...] by conscious behavior in front of the camera, like backstage parties, poem and piano recitals. Author J. Randy Taraborrelli wrote in his book [...] that the film allowed a much closer look at the singer's family. He was particularly impressed by the scenes featuring Lourdes, believing that she [...] "revealed herself to be sophisticated beyond her years". Kathryn Flett from The Observer newspaper described it as [...] "Fascinating, [...] tiny flashes of insight into her relationship with , which occasionally involve her being just as girlie and ever so slightly insecure as the rest of us." [...] Rupert Smith from The Guardian reported that the director [...] "squeezed every last drop of spectacle from a highly stage-managed performance", but commented that [...] "she gave away far more in 1991's In Bed with Madonna; this time she gave only the illusion of candour". However, he complimented saying [...] "Even the easy-to-mock pre-show prayers brought a tear to the eye.

2500|$|The West {{must also}} {{understand}} that Western institutions cannot be transplanted into a social context {{for which they were}} not defined. Western observers also must understand that even fair elections, if the elected government cannot close gaps, are moot. The elites, therefore, need to envision the form of legitimacy that works in their culture. Many Asian societies, for example, are more concerned with common social goals than Western individualism. When the problem is radical Islam, the West must reinforce local reform efforts and avoid being seen as meddling in countries’ internal affairs by supporting secular over religious Islamists, driving reform from the outside, or <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> Islamic character of Islamic countries." ...|$|E

[...] It was during this period that Ozu directed two films widely regarded as among his least typical: Record of a Tenement Gentleman (Nagaya no Shinshiroku, 1947), which portrays the plight of homeless children, and A Hen in the Wind (Kaze no Naka no Mendori, 1948), which deals with the problems of repatriated soldiers. These two works received, in Japan, much less popular and critical acceptance than his two wartime films.|$|E

2500|$|Sebastian {{said in an}} {{interview}} in late 2009 that the songs for the album originally had a much more organic old school sound, as his US record company had wanted the album to have a similar sound to The Memphis Album.

I ended up going back and reproducing everything which was quite a nightmare.

Sebastian said he felt he was exactly where he wanted to be creatively with this album: [...] "I'm in a really happy place musically, because this is exactly the style of music I want to do and that I've wanted to do for so long.

Lucky's relationship with his mother becomes further strained in December 1998 when he and Nikolas are told that Stefan Cassadine (Nichols) is Nikolas's father, not the presumed-dead Stavros Cassadine, and Laura had kept the secret. Lucky and Nikolas begin to bond over the betrayal of their respective families. Lucky's estrangement with his parents adds to his newfound open-mindedness about Nikolas, as Jackson told Soap Opera Magazine: [...] "Lucky's been <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> way he looks at things, to not become Luke. That's {{part of the process}} – not having the same relationship with Nikolas that Luke has with Stefan. (...) He's trying to find his own Spencer."

(It's) something that really seemed impossible, but Lucky surprises [...] with his big heart and his maturity." [...] In the same interview, Guza described the acceptance Lucky had come to have about his parents, recounting scenes where Lucky bonds with each.

2500|$|Antoine Lavoisier is {{commonly}} {{cited as a}} central contributor to the chemical revolution. His precise measurements and meticulous keeping of balance sheets throughout his experiment were vital to the wide spread acceptance {{of the law of}} conservation of mass. His introduction of new terminology, a binomial system modeled after that of Linnaeus, also helps to mark the dramatic changes in the field which are referred to generally as the chemical revolution. However, Lavoisier encountered much opposition in <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>the</b> field, especially from British phlogistic scientists. Joseph Priestley, Richard Kirwan, James Keir, and William Nicholson, among others, argued that quantification of substances did not imply conservation of mass. Rather than reporting factual evidence, opposition claimed Lavoisier was misinterpreting the implications of his research. One of Lavoisier's allies, Jean Baptiste Biot, wrote of Lavoisier's methodology, [...] "one felt the necessity of linking accuracy in experiments to rigor of reasoning." [...] His opposition, however, that a precision in experimentation did not imply precision in inferences and reasonings. Despite opposition, Lavoisier continued to use precise instrumentation to convince other chemists of his conclusions, often results to five to eight decimal places. Nicholson, who estimated that only three of these decimal places were meaningful, stated: If it be denied that these results are pretended to be true in the last figures, I must beg leave to observe, that these long rows of figures, which in some instances extend to a thousand times the nicety of experiment, serve only to exhibit a parade which true science has no need of: and, more than this, that when the real degree of accuracy in experiments is thus hidden from our contemplation, we are somewhat disposed to doubt whether the exactitude scrupuleuse of the experiments be indeed such as to render the proofs de l'ordre demonstratif.|$|E
