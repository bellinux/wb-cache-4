It {{was developed in}} common with ITU-T (then CCITT) for <b>telematic</b> <b>services</b> {{under the name of}} T.51, and first became an ISO standard in 1983. Certain byte codes are used as lead bytes for letters with diacritics (accents). The value of the lead byte often indicates which diacritic that the letter has, and the follow byte then has the ASCII-value for the letter that the diacritic is on. Only certain combinations of lead byte and follow byte are allowed, and there are some exceptions to the lead byte interpretation for some follow bytes. However, that no combining characters at all are encoded in ISO/IEC 6937. But one can represent some free-standing diacritics, often by letting the follow byte have the code for ASCII space.|$|E

The aim of the application is to offer high quality care to users of health services over inexpensive communication pathways, using Internet-based, interactive communication tools, like remote access to medical records and transmission of multimedia information. The XML technology was employed to achieve customised views on patient data, according to the access rights of different user profiles. Strict security and access control policy were implemented to ensure secure transmission of medical data through the Internet. The system was designed to collaborate with existing clinical patient record systems and to be adjustable to different medical applications. Current implementations include the fields of Oncology, Lupus Erythrematosis, Obstetrics and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary disease.

The algorithm is compared to more classical approach Random Midpoint Displacement showing at traffic generated is similar but can be generated continuously with no fixed block size. Second work presents two novel cloning schemes for video delivery in OBS networks that dramatically improve user perceived content quality. These schemes take into account the special characteristics of compressed video traffic. Analytical and simulation results show up to 40 % QoE improvement without a substantial increase in the overall network traffic and without increasing the number of bursts in the network.

This paper {{describes}} a cost {{analysis of a}} home-based support service for frail older people and their family carers in two municipalities in West Sweden and using information and communication technology. Background. A key challenge facing nurse managers across Europe is an increasingly aged population, combined with reduced numbers of young adults of working age. New solutions are needed to provide quality, cost-effective community care services to frail older people and their family carers. Methods. A case study methodology involving five families was used, and included a detailed cost description of the technology-based service compared with usual services. Cost data were collected in June 2002. This work formed {{part of a larger}} project exploring the impact of a technology-based service known as, Assisting Carers using Telematics Interventions to meet Older Persons’ Needs (ACTION). In addition to cost data, information was gathered on {{the quality of life of}} frail older people and their family carers, and the job satisfaction and work methods of nurses and other practitioners based in the community. The cost analysis comprised a description of the family and their caring situation, the perceived benefits of the <b>telematic</b> based support <b>service</b> and an assessment of its impact on the use of other care services. These analyses were carried out with the help of needs assessors who were known to the families, and nurses working in the ACTION call centre. All results were validated by the five participating families. Results. Cost savings were achieved in all cases, and the benefits to older people and their carers were also considerable. As a result of the cost analysis and overall evaluation data, ACTION has been implemented as a mainstream service in the municipalities involved. Conclusion. Researchers, nurses, other practitioners and community care managers can work together with frail older people and their family carers to develop quality, cost-effective support services that reduce demands on staff whilst providing benefits to users...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this thesis is the {{assessment}} of telematic systems for road freight transport from a planning perspective. The aim is to support strategic decisions related to architectural choices for such systems, with the possibility to achieve synergies by supporting multiple <b>telematic</b> <b>services.</b> The past decade has witnessed enormous growth in cargo volumes resulting in increasing demand for transport capacity. To match this increasing demand only with expansion of infrastructure, e. g. road and vehicles, {{does not seem to}} be a sustainable strategy. One of the few approaches with the potential to improve the use of current transport capacity is the integrated use of modern information and communication technology, otherwise known as telematic systems for road transport, an important component within Intelligent Transport Systems (ITS). This type of systems can deliver multiple services that can be used to improve the efficiency and safety of road freight transport. However, attempts to unleash the potential of telematic systems and make maximum possible use of the available transport capacity have been hindered by several challenges ranging from planning and design to development and deployment. Considering the large scope of possible <b>telematic</b> <b>services</b> that can potentially be deployed in road freight transport, this thesis suggests a framework in order to enable structured assessment of telematic systems. Based on the suggested framework, a set of potential transport <b>telematic</b> <b>services</b> are identified and a method for quantifying the value of the services to society is developed. The suggested method takes into account the expected impact on different transportation challenges, such as accidents, fuel consumption, and infrastructure maintenance. Quantitative methods are provided for studying the value of services sharing a common infrastructure. Using quantified benefits of services and costs of various functionalities required by <b>telematic</b> <b>services,</b> the concept of a multi-service architecture is investigated using optimization methods, which handles the multi-dimensional relations between different services that are otherwise difficult to analyze with traditional cost-benefit analysis. The analyses show which <b>telematic</b> <b>services</b> can be achieved with different approaches, such as vehicle-to-vehicle communication, vehicle-to-infrastructure communication, etc. Although multi-service architectures are promising, several challenges need to be overcome, including security, service quality, privacy, and business models. The knowledge gained from the work presented in this thesis can be valuable for different stakeholders, such as governments, service providers, and transport service users, in fostering the planning, design, development, and deployment of telematic systems in transport...|$|E
40|$|Intelligent Truck Parking (ITP) {{involves}} {{efficient management}} of information {{as a tool}} for addressing some of the problems related to truck parking, such as, the inability to navigate to, or reserve a parking space. Different <b>telematic</b> <b>services</b> (ITP core services) may be required to address different stakeholder needs, e. g., a navigation service for finding the way to a truck parking area, and a reservation service for assuring the availability of a parking space when in the parking area. In addition to ITP core services, there are several other <b>telematic</b> <b>services</b> that address transport problems in general. If the synergies of different services are taken into account during design and deployment of <b>telematic</b> <b>services,</b> cost reduction may be achieved through functionality sharing. In this article, we have identified services that are relevant for sharing functionalities with ITP core services, estimate functionality costs and perform a synergy analysis to assess the marginal cost savings as a result. Overall results indicates that Traffic Information Broadcasting (TIB), Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) for goods, and Geo-fencing (GEO) can form clusters with ITP core services that could lead to better cost savings compared {{to the rest of the}} services studied. This article has been submitted, reviewed, re-submitted, presented and discussed at the 9 th ITS European Congress in Dublin, Ireland, June 2013 </p...|$|E
