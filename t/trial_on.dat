40|$|Objectives: To {{systematically}} {{identify and}} compare the concepts contained in outcome measures of clinical <b>trials</b> <b>on</b> low back pain, chronic widespread pain, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis and rheumatoid arthritis using the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) as a reference. Methods: Randomized controlled trials carried out between 1991 and 2000 were identified using MEDLINE and selected according predefined criteria. The outcome measures were extracted and the concepts contained in the outcome measures were linked to the ICF. Results: One hundred and twenty-nine <b>trials</b> <b>on</b> low back pain, 42 <b>trials</b> <b>on</b> chronic widespread pain, 176 <b>trials</b> <b>on</b> osteoarthritis, 107 <b>trials</b> <b>on</b> osteoporosis and 382 <b>trials</b> <b>on</b> rheumatoid arthritis were included. Fifty-nine different health status questionnaires were extracted in low back pain, 29 in chronic widespread pain, 29 in osteoarthritis, 3 in osteoporosis and 48 in rheumatoid arthritis. Across conditions at least 77 % (range 77 - 88 %) of the extracted concepts could {{be linked to the}} ICF. In low back pain, chronic widespread pain and osteoarthritis the most used ICF-categories were sensation of pain (b 280), in osteoporosis structure of trunk (s 760) and in rheumatoid arthritis additional musculoskeletal structures related to movement (s 770). The most used category across conditions was sensation of pain (b 280) except for osteoporosis. Conclusion: The ICF provides a useful reference to identify and quantify the concepts contained in outcome assessment used in clinical trials...|$|R

5|$|The 2015 Vuelta {{included}} nine summit finishes, none {{of which}} had previously {{been used in the}} race. Unusually, the principal difficulties of the race came in the first two weeks, including all nine summit finishes. It was therefore expected that the climbers would need to attack early in the race, in order to build up a significant lead ahead of the lengthy time <b>trial</b> <b>on</b> Stage 17. The race organisers also hoped to encourage sprinters to take part by including seven fairly flat stages.|$|E
5|$|The 2015 event had a {{very similar}} format to the {{previous}} year's race. It consisted of six stages, of which five were flat stages and one was an individual time trial.
