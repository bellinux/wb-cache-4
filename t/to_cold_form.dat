In the present study different combinations of tool steels/stainless steels/lubricants has been evaluated with respect to their galling resistance using pin-on-disc testing. The results show that a high galling resistance is favored by a high stainless steel sheet hardness and a blasted stainless steel sheet surface topography. The effect of type of lubricant was found to be more complex. For example, the chlorinated lubricants failed to prevent metal-to-metal contact on a brushed sheet surface but succeeded on a blasted sheet surface of the same stainless steel material. This is believed to be due to a protective tribofilm which is able to form on the blasted surface, but not on the brushed surface...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Here-in, a {{numerical}} analysis {{based on the}} Finite Element Method (FEM) is proposed in order to investigate cold-formed steel back-to-back double angle structural behavior under compression. Considering non-linear analysis, an investigation was performed to analyze the influence of some aspects, such as the loading condition (concentric and eccentric axial compression), the boundary conditions, the global slenderness, the global and local geometric imperfections, the angle thickness {{and the number of}} packing plates. The numerical results signalize that the compression strength obtained in accordance with the standards ABNT NBR 14762 : 2010 and ANSI/AISI S 100 (2012) may be quite conservative, mainly in the lower global slenderness cases. Additionally, the connection spacing (bolted connection with stitch plates in-between the angles) and the presence of a connection at mid-length change the buckling mode, as well as cause a significantly increase in the axial compression strength of the member. The numerical analysis also indicates that the design proposed by ABNT NBR 8800 : 2008 for the case involving angles under compression connected by one flap can also be applied <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> <b>formed</b> steel angles...|$|R

40|$|Presented in {{this thesis}} is an {{investigation}} on the response of hot-finished and <b>cold</b> <b>formed,</b> hollow and concrete-filled circular hollow section braces in earthquake resisting concentrically braced frames. The role of these braces is to act as structural ‘fuses’ in the frame, dissipating the seismic energy by undergoing plastic deformations. Circular hollow sections offer aesthetic and structural advantages over conventional rectangular hollow sections owing to the uniformity of the section geometry. Distinct behaviour is observed between <b>cold</b> <b>formed</b> and hot-finished tubes, since the <b>cold</b> <b>formed</b> sections retain {{a higher degree of}} residual stresses from manufacturing. Braces subjected to cyclic loading fail after the occurrences of global and local buckling, but the performance can be enhanced by employing concrete infill. The concrete-filled steel tube is an optimum combination of the two materials, resulting in an efficient, economic and practical structural member. Experiments were performed in which cyclic axial loading was applied to hollow and composite braces of each section type. Hot-finished specimens exhibited superior ductility <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> <b>formed</b> members. Concrete infill enhanced the tensile resistance for members of all lengths, the compressive resistance of shorter members and the number of cycles to failure. Finite element models were subsequently developed with ABAQUS® software, using the inbuilt nonlinear isotropic/kinematic hardening model and the damaged plasticity model to define the steel and concrete characteristics. Reliable simulations were achieved for the hollow braces but further work is required for the composite braces. Both local and global slenderness values influenced the specimen response. Expressions were proposed to predict the displacement ductility and energy dissipation capability of hollow braces in terms of these parameters. The findings suggest that distinct guidelines could be developed for introduction into Eurocode 8 for each steel section type, and that the benefits of concrete infill could be taken into account in dissipative design...|$|R

The {{continuous}} miniaturization {{of products}} needed e. g. in the automotive or the microelectronics sector requires process chains, which allow the manufacturing of microscopically small components in high quantities. The {{development of the}} required processes and technologies is {{the aim of the}} Collaborative Research Centre 747 “Micro <b>Cold</b> <b>Forming</b> ” of the German Research Foundation. As a necessary step in the manufacturing process chain heat treatment enables the adjustment of the semi-finished micro components <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> <b>forming.</b> Finally, the in-service characteristics of the aluminium components have to be adjusted by precipitation hardening that increases the strength values beyond those which can be achieved by strain hardening. To provide high strength aluminium alloys with an improved thermal stability new alloy concepts and advanced production processes have been developed within the Collaborative Research Centre (CRC). Besides the scandium containing foils made of alloy Al- 2 Sc, foils of a novel alloy Al- 4 Zr with approximately 4 mass- % Zirconium has been produced by means of physical vapour deposition (PVD). In contrast to conventional strip casting techniques the PVD process operates with low temperatures, which should suppress premature precipitation during the foil production and ensure the supersaturated solid solution that is a prerequisite for precipitation hardening. Samples of this material were subsequently artificially aged and characterized by ultra micro hardness measurements (UMH), transmission electron microscopical (TEM) analysis and differential power scanning calorimetry (DPSC) to evaluate the applied aging parameters...|$|R

The theoretical computation of web crippling strength is quite complex as it involves a large number of factors such as initial imperfections, local yielding at load application and instability of web. The existing design provision in North American specification for cold-formed steel C-sections (AISI S 100, 2007) to calculate the web-crippling strength is based on the experimental investigation.

Compared to timber roof structures, cold-formed steel roof structures may require less or even no maintenance programs as they are absolutely durable against termite and wood-decay fungus attacks. However, lesson learned from recent building failures due to earthquakes indicated that cold-formed steel structures are susceptible to buckling failure. This study attempts to improve buckling performance of cold-formed steel members by combining them with timber laminas <b>to</b> obtain <b>cold</b> <b>formed</b> steel – timber composite. This composite member is obtained by attaching 15 -mm thick timber laminas (Swietenia mahagoni) to the web part of cold-formed steel Z-, C-, and double C-sections using screws at regular spacing of 100 mm. Compression tests were conducted for five different effective lengths, {{and the increase in}} compressive load capacities of the composite members was validated by the results of compression test of <b>cold</b> <b>formed</b> steel (without timber laminas). The test results showed that the failure of composite members was progressive and it was initiated by flange local buckling followed by flexural buckling at the final stage. This failure mode is different from the observed common failure mode of the <b>cold</b> <b>formed</b> steel member which is instantaneous and is a combination of local buckling and flexural-torsional buckling.

40|$|Forging {{tools are}} often showing short lifetimes {{compared}} <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> <b>forming</b> tools e. g. for sheet metal forming. This {{is based on}} the process conditions where high local surface temperatures are alternating with chilling conditions due to the spray cooling with water based cooling lubricants. The resulting thermal shock is provoking fatigue of the tool material in the near surface regions. Crack initiation and crack growth due to thermal shock exposure then causes chipping of the tool steel material in the surface regions. These are starting points for extensive wear. Hardness and wear resistance of tool surfaces at elevated temperatures can be dramatically enhanced with nitriding pretreatments. This has become state-of-the-art for hot forming tool steels in many forging applications. With inappropriate adjustments of the nitriding parameters a decrease of the ductility can occur and will reduce the crack resistance of the tool surface especially under thermal shock conditions. The hot working steel DIN- 1. 2367 (X 38 CrMoV 5) is currently one of the most often used chromium-molybdenum tool steels in the field of forging. Exemplary for this material is the influence of the nitriding parameters like temperature, nitrogen supply and plasma parameters on the nitriding depth, the maximum hardness and the crack sensitivity will be discussed. Nitrided samples will be investigated with methods developed for the adhesion measurement of hard coatings. It could be shown that this is also appropriate for a qualification of the crack sensitivity of tools.

40|$|Lightweight {{construction}} {{is an effective}} method of reducing fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions in the automotive industry. At the same time, crash safety specifications are constantly being tightened. High-strength steels meet both requirements. However, these steels {{are more difficult to}} form than deep drawing steels since their higher strength compromises formability, especially when using tensile strength above 1000 MPa. The cold formability of high-strength steel blanks can be improved by locally changing the microstructure in critical areas with laser radiation prior <b>to</b> <b>cold</b> <b>forming.</b> The laser heat treated areas exhibit up to five times increased elongation in a tensile test. Thanks to the locally modified mechanical properties of the blanks, parts can be formed without necking or cracks in critical areas. Another way to combine high strength with a good formability is hot-stamping. In the case of the widely used Manganese Boron Steel 22 MnB 5, the tensile strength is 1600 MPa after hot stamping. But such high strength is not desired in the whole part. Deformation zones for better crash performance and zones for joining require a more ductile material, what can be achieved by local heat treating these zones with laser radiation. In this work, material and process characteristics of laser heat treatment of four different high strength steels are investigated: CP-W® 800, Docol® 1200 and MS-W® 1200 are used for <b>cold</b> <b>forming,</b> 22 MnB 5 for hot-stamping. A fiber-coupled 10 kW high-power diode laser and optics with rectangular, homogeneous intensity distribution of up to 90 mm width are used.

Corrosion and tool friction are investigated for different coatings, to ensure automotive applicability. The laser heat treatment process is demonstrated for different parts.

Indeed, accurate modelling of the continuous <b>cold</b> roll <b>forming</b> process using finite elements requires a huge number of elements leading to excessive CPU times. Therefore, modellers usually reduce the geometry of the formed sheet or increase the size of the finite elements, inducing a loss of accuracy in the results. In this work, the finite element software METAFOR is used <b>to</b> model <b>cold</b> roll <b>forming</b> of channel profiles made of high-strength and stainless steels. The numerical results, expressed in terms of corner strength enhancement versus radius–to–thickness ratio, are compared against an existing predictive model. Peer reviewe...|$|R

After the demise of that group, Ferrari appeared in both Wayne's World movies (as the guitarist for Tia Carrere's band [...] "Crucial Taunt") and formed the band Medicine Wheel, which released three CDs. In addition, he released two solo CDs and started a music publishing company called MasterSource, employing Ron Keel to write material for the library. Ferrari also recently wrote a book titled Rock Star 101.|$|R
