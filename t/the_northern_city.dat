5|$|After a {{temporary}} closure between October 1951 and January 1952, British Railways (the {{successor to the}} LNER) ended passenger services between Finsbury Park and Alexandra Palace permanently on 3 July 1954.

After freight traffic ceased, the line continued to be used for occasional London Underground rolling stock transfers between Highgate depot and <b>the</b> <b>Northern</b> <b>City</b> line, with the stock being pulled over the unelectrified lines by battery locomotives. This ceased in 1970 because of the poor condition of some of the intermediate bridges, and the track was lifted through the surface platforms in 1972.|$|E

5|$|From 1863, part of King's Cross was an {{intermediate}} station. On the extreme {{east of the}} site, King's Cross York Road station was served by suburban trains from Finsbury before they followed the sharply curved and steeply graded York Road Tunnel to join the City Widened Lines to Farringdon, Barbican and Moorgate. In the other direction, trains from Moorgate came off the Widened Lines via the Hotel Curve, to platform 16 (latterly renumbered 14) which rose to the main line level. Services to and from Moorgate were diverted via <b>the</b> <b>Northern</b> <b>City</b> Line from November 1976. The station remained in occasional use until it was completely closed on 5 March 1977.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, the London Passenger Transport Board (LPTB) {{announced}} a proposal, which {{became known as}} the Northern Heights project, to take over the LNER lines from Finsbury Park to Edgware, High Barnet and Alexandra Palace, and link them to both the Northern line at East Finchley and to <b>the</b> <b>Northern</b> <b>City</b> line at Finsbury Park. The construction of the first phase of this project involved extending tube train services from the Northern line's existing terminus at Archway station (then also called Highgate), through a new section of paired tunnels under Highgate station to emerge south of East Finchley station, where track connections to the LNER line were made.|$|E

In May 1147, the first contingents of crusaders left from Dartmouth in England for the Holy Land.

5|$|Proposals {{for rapid}} transit service through the Roosevelt {{neighborhood}} {{date back to}} the early 20th century, when the area was near <b>the</b> <b>northern</b> <b>city</b> limits of Seattle. In 1911, Virgil Bogue proposed an extensive rapid transit system, including an underground subway following 10th Avenue Northeast from Northeast 85th Street south towards Latona (the present-day University District) and Downtown Seattle. The proposal was rejected by voters the following year, but an un-adopted 1926 plan from the Planning Commission included rapid transit service to Ravenna Park and the University District.|$|E
5|$|After {{three months}} of {{inactivity}} and regrouping, Kagame decided in January 1991 that the RPF was ready to begin fighting again. The target chosen for the first attack was <b>the</b> <b>northern</b> <b>city</b> of Ruhengeri, which lies immediately south of the Virunga mountains. The city was the best choice from a practical point of view, being the only provincial capital that could be attacked quickly from the Virungas while maintaining an element of surprise. Kagame also favoured an attack on Ruhengeri for cultural reasons. President Habyarimana, {{as well as his}} wife and her powerful family, came from the north west of Rwanda and most Rwandans regarded the region was as the heartland of the regime. An attack there guaranteed that the population would become aware of the RPF's presence, and Kagame hoped the attack would destabilise the government.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, the Spanish government, which ruled over Puerto Rico, {{attempted}} to banish Betances {{for a second}} time, but he and Segundo Ruiz Belvis (a lawyer and city administrator who became his closest friend and political companion) fled the island before they were apprehended. Both fled to <b>the</b> <b>northern</b> <b>city</b> of Puerto Plata in the Dominican Republic in 1861, where Betances established a close personal friendship with Gen. Gregorio Luperón, the military leader of the northern pro-independence faction who led the efforts to restore Dominican sovereignty over their country. Betances was also a collaborator of Dominican priest (and later Archbishop of Santo Domingo and one-time president of the country), Fernando Arturo de Meriño, who was the revolt's ideological leader (as well as its delegate in Puerto Rico when he was himself exiled by the restored republican government). These two friendships {{would prove to be}} key to Betances' own efforts to achieve Puerto Rican independence later on.|$|E

5|$|Delaware Route 202 (DE 202), {{also known}} as Concord Avenue, is a short state highway in Wilmington, Delaware. It runs from U.S. Route 13 Business (US 13 Bus., Market Street) north to a {{modified}} cloverleaf interchange with Interstate 95 (I-95) and US 202 at <b>the</b> <b>northern</b> <b>city</b> limits. North of the interchange, the route becomes US 202 northbound, {{also known as}} the Concord Pike. The road is two lanes and undivided for most of its length except for the part just south of the I-95 interchange, which is four lanes and divided. DE 202 was a part of US 202 until that highway was truncated to the I-95 interchange in 1970. DE 202 was designated by 1981.|$|E
5|$|Just {{behind the}} Greyfriars turret is the islet of Helgeandsholmen, where <b>the</b> <b>northern</b> <b>city</b> gate and {{defensive}} wall were located.

King Gustav Vasa had all the charitable institutions in the city merged into a single one housed in the former Greyfriars monastery on Riddarholmen, so the monasteries in the painting were all the possession of the crown when the painting was produced.|$|E
5|$|Lucas Rafael Bennazar Ortíz {{participated in}} the Beijing Olympics as Puerto Rico's only sharpshooter. Born in <b>the</b> <b>northern</b> <b>city</b> of Guaynabo, Bennazar first {{participated in the}} Olympics as a 35-year-old in Athens that competed in the men's trap {{shooting}} and double trap. He again participated in the double trap {{when he returned to}} the Olympics as a 39-year-old. Bennazar took part in the preliminary round of the event, which took place on August 11. During this time, Bennazar earned 45 points in the first round; 39 points in the second round; and 39 points again in the third round. His overall score during preliminaries was 123 points, placing 17th out of 19 athletes. He defeated New Zealand's Graeme Ede (113 points) and fell behind Russia's Vitaly Fokeev (130 points), falling behind heat leader Walton Eller of the United States who set an Olympic record with his score (145 points). His score remained the same in the final round on August 12, and he remained in 17th place.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the several}} major vowel shifts that is {{currently}} underway in the US is <b>the</b> <b>Northern</b> <b>Cities</b> Vowel Shift.

This vowel rotation, for example, is noticeable as the vowel sound in “coffee” is moving toward the vowel in “father.” While there are undoubtedly several other change patterns that define the shift in <b>the</b> <b>Northern</b> <b>Cities,</b> they are diffusing throughout the North in a unique manner, and are inherently different from dialect shifts taking place in other regions.|$|R

5|$|While {{development}} is now tightly controlled {{in the vicinity}} of the Forbidden City, throughout the past century uncontrolled and sometimes politically motivated demolition and reconstruction has changed the character of the areas surrounding the Forbidden City. Since 2000, the Beijing municipal government has worked to evict governmental and military institutions occupying some historical buildings, and has established a park around the remaining parts of the Imperial City wall. In 2004, an ordinance relating to building height and planning restriction was renewed to establish the Imperial City area and <b>the</b> <b>northern</b> <b>city</b> area as a buffer zone for the Forbidden City. In 2005, the Imperial City and Beihai (as an extension item to the Summer Palace) were included in the shortlist for the next World Heritage Site in Beijing.|$|E
5|$|Soon after, on 19 February 1942, the Japanese {{launched}} {{air raids}} on Australian soil, targeting <b>the</b> <b>northern</b> <b>city</b> of Darwin. Miller trained at flying schools at Cunderdin, Western Australia and Mallala, South Australia, {{just north of}} Adelaide and gained his wings in late 1942. He played only one match during the football season, playing in a combined West Adelaide and Glenelg Football Club team while posted in South Australia. His team lost. On 17 December he returned to Melbourne and was promoted {{to the rank of}} flight sergeant. On 15 January 1943, he embarked on the USS West Point at Port Melbourne, which was to take him to Europe in readiness for war combat. The journey included a stopover in February at a training camp in Boston in the United States. It was there that Miller met Peg Wagner, his future wife. They were engaged before Miller left for the United Kingdom. He arrived in Scotland on 18 March 1943 and was deployed to the southern English coastal town of Bournemouth. The once-popular tourist resort had been turned into a military centre and was the target of frequent German air raids.|$|E
