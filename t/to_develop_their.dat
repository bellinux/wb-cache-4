5|$|In 1898, Bresslau met {{her future}} husband, Albert Schweitzer at a wedding. Shortly thereafter, they {{developed}} a relationship that included separation, independence, and non-exclusive behaviors. This allowed both <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>their</b> lives while enjoying each other's companionship, conversation, and virtues. The one thing that united the pair was their shared ideology: {{to take care of}} others.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees sought <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>their</b> own players, {{rather than}} buying them from other teams, {{especially}} after the investment of $100,000 ($ in current dollar terms) in Lyn Lary and Jimmie Reese in 1927. However, Weiss and Bill Essick convinced Barrow to approve the purchase of Joe DiMaggio from the Pacific Coast League.|$|E

5|$|The {{constitution}} of the AFM blends {{at the national level}} the elements of a presbyterian polity with an episcopal polity. Decentralization is a major feature of its constitution, which allows local churches <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>their</b> own policies. The Apostolic Faith Mission displays a variety of identities and ministry philosophies, including seeker-sensitive, Word of Faith, Presbyterian, and classical Pentecostal.|$|E
5|$|Utica's neighborhoods have {{historically}} been defined by their residents, allowing them <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>their</b> own individuality.

5|$|Even {{though their}} most recent single was doing poorly, Deep Purple {{maintained}} {{a reputation as a}} fine live act in the US. The band had now begun <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>their</b> stage presence into something grander, going in a louder and heavier direction and focusing more and more on the instrumental interplay between Blackmore and Lord. In particular the latter had found a way to short-circuit the original Leslie speakers of his Hammond organ C-3 and connect the instrument directly into the stacks of Marshall amps, obtaining a roaring sound and matching the guitar in loudness.|$|E

5|$|From the Order of Canada grew a Canadian honours system, thereby {{reducing}} the use of British honours (i.e. those administered by the Queen in her British privy council). Among the civilian awards of the Canadian honours system, the Order of Canada comes third, after the Cross of Valour and membership in the Order of Merit, which is within the personal gift of Canada's monarch. By the 1980s, Canada's provinces began <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>their</b> own distinct honours and decorations.|$|E
5|$|Maeser {{returned}} to Salt Lake City in 1870 {{and became a}} professor of German. However, he resigned from this position {{to return to the}} Twentieth Ward Seminary. In 1870, he also taught at the University of Deseret, helping <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>their</b> teacher training program. Maeser wrote articles in the Beehive Series of the Juvenile Instructor during 1870. In 1871, he was elected the president of the Salt Lake Teacher's Association. For {{a short period of time}} he was also an assistant organist for the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.|$|E
5|$|Reich– who {{had known}} Hoyle since the late 1990s– was in the audience, and enjoyed the {{chemistry}} between the two actors, suggesting that they appear in a feature film together. Over {{the course of a}} day, he filmed three shorts starring Hoyle and Ryder, in which they explored some of the scenarios and themes that made it into Uncle David. In these shorts Hoyle wore a wig and makeup, which were omitted from the later feature. The two actors continued <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>their</b> characters through a series of text messages and phone conversations.|$|E

5|$|Such {{approval}} {{was increasingly}} granted starting in 1982. In May, Venezuela, {{who had long}} examined the FX project, agreed to buy 18 F-16As and six F-16Bs, replacing a fleet of Mirage III interceptors and Mirage 5 ground-attack aircraft. Sweden decided <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>their</b> own design, the JAS 39 Gripen. In September 1983, Turkey announced plans to buy 132 F-16Cs and 28 F-16Ds to replace their Lockheed F-104G/S Starfighter and Northrop F-5A/B. Greece, stung by its long-time rival receiving the F-16, purchased 34 F-16C and six F-16Ds in November 1984, giving a firm pledge of secrecy.|$|E
5|$|The Beatles' five residencies in Hamburg during 1960 to 1962 {{allowed the}} Liverpool band <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>their</b> {{performance}} skills and widen their reputation. Drummer Pete Best {{was added to}} the band in August 1960 to secure their first Hamburg booking, where they played for 48 nights at the Indra Club and then 58 nights at the Kaiserkeller. The Beatles returned to Hamburg in April 1961 to play at the Top Ten Club for three months.|$|E
5|$|The {{architectural}} {{designs of}} these projects have reflected not only the style currents of their time, but the societal debate over the purpose they were intended to serve. Nationalistic ambitions early on gave way to austere designs based on functionalism, and then to designs that emphasized human and ecological needs. To a great extent, Norwegian architects have found the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>their</b> signature styles through these projects, and thereby also a Norwegian architectural dialect.|$|E

5|$|Within {{the living}} quarters, the {{atmosphere}} resembled {{that of a}} college dormitory. Housekeeping and laundry services were provided, but the quarters were small and little entertainment was available. Television broadcasts were delayed two days {{because of the need}} to fly tapes from California, and most workers had <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>their</b> own forms of entertainment. In the winter, some took to skiing or sightseeing; in the summer, some went hiking. In general, however, little time was available for recreation because of the long hours worked by most people.|$|E
5|$|Bahá'í teachings {{state that}} God {{is too great}} for humans to fully comprehend, or to create a {{complete}} and accurate image of, by themselves. Therefore, human understanding of God is achieved through his revelations via his Manifestations. In the Bahá'í religion, God {{is often referred to}} by titles and attributes (for example, the All-Powerful, or the All-Loving), and there is a substantial emphasis on monotheism; such doctrines as the Trinity are seen as compromising, if not contradicting, the Bahá'í view that God is single and has no equal. The Bahá'í teachings state that the attributes which are applied to God are used to translate Godliness into human terms and also to help individuals concentrate on their own attributes in worshipping God <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>their</b> potentialities on their spiritual path. According to the Bahá'í teachings the human purpose is to learn to know and love God through such methods as prayer, reflection, and being of service to others.|$|E
5|$|By the 1st century BC, {{during the}} Hellenistic period, the Greeks had begun <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>their</b> own {{mathematical}} schemes for predicting {{the positions of}} the planets. These schemes, which were based on geometry rather than the arithmetic of the Babylonians, would eventually eclipse the Babylonians' theories in complexity and comprehensiveness, and account for most of the astronomical movements observed from Earth with the naked eye. These theories would reach their fullest expression in the Almagest written by Ptolemy in the 2nd century CE. So complete was the domination of Ptolemy's model that it superseded all previous works on astronomy and remained the definitive astronomical text in the Western world for 13 centuries. To the Greeks and Romans there were seven known planets, each presumed to be circling Earth according to the complex laws laid out by Ptolemy. They were, in increasing order from Earth (in Ptolemy's order): the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn.|$|E

5|$|Enthusiasm {{for game}} {{distribution}} ebbed, and CD Projekt's founders {{wondered if the}} company should continue as a distributor or a game developer after Dark Alliances cancellation. With the game cancelled and its code owned by CD Projekt, the company planned to use them <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>their</b> first original game. They intended to develop a game series based on Andrzej Sapkowski's Wiedźmin books (which were popular in Poland) and the author accepted the company's development proposal. The franchise rights had been sold to a Polish mobile game studio, but the studio had not worked on anything related to the franchise and CD Projekt acquired {{the rights to the}} Wiedźmin franchise. According to Iwiński, he and Kiciński {{had no idea how to}} develop a video game at that time.|$|E
5|$|F.C. United {{were formed}} in 2005 {{by a group}} of Manchester United {{supporters}} following the club's controversial takeover by Malcolm Glazer which led to hundreds of supporters defecting from the club. Without a stadium of their own they agreed to use Bury's Gigg Lane stadium, but the agreement continued at the cost of approximately £5,000 per match. Within a year, the fan-owned club set aspirations to build its own 7,000 to 10,000 capacity stadium as close to Manchester city centre as possible by 2012 and consequently entered into negotiations with New East Manchester and Manchester City Council <b>to</b> <b>develop</b> <b>their</b> plans. Despite attendances averaging over 2,000 in their first few seasons, the fact that the club did not have access to a stadium of its own on its match days was a contributory factor in the club's financial loss for three years (£42,267 in 2007, £40,669 in 2008 and £9,663 in 2009).|$|E
5|$|Kerry Conran {{grew up on}} {{films and}} comic books of the 1930s and 1940s.

Kerry studied at a feeder program for Disney animators at CalArts, and became interested in 2-D computer animation. While there, he {{realized that it was}} possible to apply some of the techniques associated with animation to live-action. Conran had been out of film school for two years and was trying to figure out how to make a movie. He figured that Hollywood would never take a chance on an inexperienced, first-time filmmaker, so he decided to make the movie himself.|$|E
