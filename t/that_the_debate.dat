25|$|Some {{scholars}} {{contend that}} {{debates over the}} precise meaning of bethulah ("בתולה"-virgin) and almah (young woman) are misguided because no Hebrew word encapsulates the idea of certain virginity.

Cameron suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> televised <b>debates</b> should take place before the campaign itself, as he felt <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 2010 <b>debates</b> overshadowed <b>the</b> rest of the campaign; he was, however, still positive towards them taking place.|$|R

25|$|After {{the first}} debate some {{political}} commentators, media outlets, and polls indicated that Calderón {{was seen as the}} winner of the debate, Mercado as the pleasant surprise of the night. and a nervous Madrazo as the worst performer of the night. However, political analysts also said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> was unnecessarily full of promises and personal attacks. Analysts considered that López Obrador was negatively affected by his absence and polls later confirmed Calderón having replaced López Obrador as the leading candidate.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, it was settled, and Ghulam Ahmad {{travelled}} to the Jama Masjid Delhi (main mosque) of Delhi {{accompanied by}} twelve of his followers, where some 5,000people were gathered. Before the debate started, {{there was a}} discussion on the conditions, {{which led to the}} conclusion <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> should not be upon the death of Jesus, but upon the claims of Mirza Ghulam Ahmad. He explained that his claim could only be discussed after the death of Jesus was proven, for Jesus was {{considered by many to be}} living and the one who will descend to Earth himself. Only when this belief was refuted could his claim to be the Messiah be discussed.|$|E
25|$|It {{was around}} the same time that a {{discussion}} on the matter of Australia becoming a republic began to emerge, later culminating in the 1999 Australian republic referendum, which was defeated by 54.4% of the populace, despite polls showing that the majority supported becoming a republic. It is believed the proposed model of the republic (not having a directly elected president) was unsatisfactory to most Australians. The referendum followed the recommendation of a 1998 Constitutional Convention called to discuss the issue of Australia becoming a republic. Still, nearly another ten years later, Kevin Rudd was appointed as Prime Minister, whereafter he affirmed that a republic was still a part of his party's platform, and stated his belief <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> on constitutional change should continue.|$|E
50|$|Perhaps one of {{the most}} {{interesting}} and radical themes of <b>the</b> <b>debating</b> societies was <b>the</b> continued and varied debate on men and women and their interactions.

25|$|Ghulam Ahmad went to Delhi, {{which was}} at the time {{considered}} a centre of religious learning and home to many prominent religious leaders, in 1891, with the intention of distinguishing what he believed to be the truth from falsehood. He published an advertisement in which he invited the scholars to accept his claim and to engage in a public debate with him regarding {{the life and death of}} Isa (Jesus), particularly Maulana Syed Nazeer Husain (1805–1901), who was a leading religious scholar. He also proposed three conditions that were essential for such a debate: that there should be a police presence to maintain peace, the debate should be in written form (for the purpose of recording what was said), and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> should be on the subject of the death of Jesus.|$|E
25|$|After {{the figures}} for the budget {{limitations}} were revised, Patrick Jenkin introduced the first order to limit budgets on the four precepting authorities (the GLC, ILEA, Merseyside and South Yorkshire) in the House of Commons on 6 February 1985. After a short debate the order was approved by 255 to 193 votes. The second order, covering the remaining 13 rate-making authorities, was set down for debate on 20 February, but on the previous day Jenkin had to agree to reconsider the limit for Haringey after receiving a letter from its district auditor saying {{it would have a}} deficit if the original limit had been imposed. At 10.15pm on the night before the order would have been debated, Jenkin announced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> was being delayed. After the figures for six councils were altered, revised {{figures for the}} caps were approved by a vote of 267 to 184 in the House of Commons on 25 February.|$|E

500|$|Some {{members of}} the Tories' {{campaign}} committee had urged Diefenbaker not to build his campaign around the Pipeline Debate, contending that the episode was now {{a year in the}} past and forgotten by the voters, who did not particularly care what went on in Parliament anyway. Diefenbaker replied, [...] "That's the issue, and I'm making it." [...] Diefenbaker referred to the conduct of the government in the Pipeline Debate more frequently than he did any other issue during the campaign. St. Laurent initially dealt with the question flippantly, suggesting in his opening campaign address <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> had been [...] "nearly as long as the pipeline itself and quite as full of another kind of natural gas". As the issue gained resonance with the voters, the Liberals devoted more time to it, and St. Laurent devoted a major part of his final English television address to the question. The Liberals defended their conduct, and contended that a minority {{should not be allowed to}} impose its will on an elected majority. St. Laurent suggested that the Tories had performed badly as an opposition in the debate, and suggested that the public give them more practice at being an opposition.|$|E

500|$|For Georgian England, {{the story}} of Elizabeth Canning was fascinating. [...] Little {{attention}} was paid in the trial to Squires's request for Canning to [...] "go their way"; according to Moore (1994), overtly the saga questioned Canning's chastity, while covertly it questioned whether someone of her social standing had any right to be taken notice of (in view of the immense interest taken in the case, this last seems unlikely). [...] The author Kristina Straub compares {{the case with the}} more general debate over the sexuality of female servants; Canning may have been either a [...] "childlike innocent, victimized by brutally criminal outlaws", or [...] "a wily manipulator of the justice system who uses innocent bystanders to escape the consequences of her own sexual misdeeds". [...] The Case of Elizabeth Canning Fairly Stated posited that Canning either suffered imprisonment to protect her virtue, or lied to conceal [...] "her own criminal Transactions in the Dark". [...] Straub opines <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> was not merely about Canning's guilt or innocence, but rather [...] "the kinds of sexual identity that were attributable to women of her position in the social order." [...] In the end, however, such modern theorizing is only a distraction from the main question – innocent or guilty? ...|$|E

The center also received support in the U.S., as former President Gerald Ford spoke for the center, as well the United Jewish Council of Utah, who wrote a letter stating that [...] "For over one hundred years, the Jewish and LDS communities have coexisted in the Salt Lake Valley {{in a spirit of}} true friendship and harmony. It has been our experience that when the leaders of the LDS Church make a commitment of policy, it is a commitment which can be relied upon. The stated commitment of Brigham Young University not to violate the laws of the state of Israel, or its own commitment regarding proselytizing in the state of Israel through the Jerusalem-based Brigham Young facility, is a commitment which we sincerely believe will be honored." [...] The U.S. government also became an intermediary for BYU as 154 members of Congress issued a letter to the Knesset in support of the BYU Jerusalem Center. In 1986, the Knesset approved the completion of the center.|$|E
500|$|Sociobiology {{attracted}} {{a large number}} of critical reviews, not only by biologists, but by social scientists who objected especially to Wilson's application of Darwinian thinking to humans, asserting that Wilson was implying a form of biological determinism. It was, unusually, reviewed {{on the front page of}} the New York Times in May 1975, and again in November that year as the controversy grew. The paper described the effect as [...] "a period of ferment", naming the [...] "monumental" [...] book as the [...] "yeast" [...] The Times noted <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> was an updated version of the nature or nurture argument that had simmered ever since Darwin's time: [...] "The assertion that man's body is a biological machine, subject to biological rules, has never completely shaken the conviction that the human intellect and human behavior are unique, the subject of free will." [...] The paper reported that Wilson's colleague at Harvard, Richard Lewontin, had issued a 5,000 word attack on the book, and that the [...] "meticulous" [...] Wilson had said [...] "I've tried to be extremely cautious in all this". The paper noted that Wilson had nowhere actually said that human behaviour was totally determined by genes, and reported him as saying that a rough figure was 10 percent genetic.|$|E

[...] Joshua Yehl of IGN gave the issue a 7.0 out of 10, saying [...] "While the art and characters are done well, the overall plot of Trinity War leaves much to be desired." [...] However, he praised Jeff Lemire's character work, and felt that Mikel Janin's art was the [...] "cleanest and most consistent looking chapter of [...] "Trinity War" [...] thus far." [...] Comic Book Resources' Kelly Thompson gave the issue 2.5 stars out of 5, saying the issue [...] "gets devoured by the massive [...] "Trinity War" [...] and buckles under the weight" [...] adding <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> seems more plot driven than character driven.

500|$|The use of {{the vaccine}} has been controversial. In 1998, Andrew Wakefield and his colleagues {{published}} a fraudulent research paper and he claimed to link the MMR vaccine with autism. The study was widely reported and fed concern {{about the safety of}} vaccinations. Wakefield's research was identified as fraudulent and in 2010, he was struck off the UK medical register and can no longer practise medicine in the UK. [...] In the wake of the controversy, the MMR vaccination rate in the UK fell from 92 per cent in 1995, to less than 80 per cent in 2003. Cases of measles rose from 56 in 1998 [...] to 1370 in 2008, and similar increases occurred throughout Europe. In April 2013, an epidemic of measles in Wales in the UK broke out, which mainly affected teenagers who had not been vaccinated. [...] Despite this controversy, measles has been eliminated from Finland, Sweden and Cuba. Japan abolished mandatory vaccination in 1992, and in 1995–1997 more than 200,000cases were reported in the country. Measles remains a public health problem in Japan, where it is now endemic; [...] a National Measles Elimination Plan was established in December 2007, with a view to eliminating the disease from the country.

Owen Jones, who also participated in the programme, described it as [...] "a rowdy, chaotic show, based on the formula of [...] "who shouts loudest"." [...] This view was echoed by Neil Midgley of The Telegraph, who felt that both follow-up programmes [...] "didn't live up to [...] standards" [...] of the series, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>debate</b> had [...] "sparked a lot of shouting and tumult, but very little new wisdom". The Independents Daisy Wyatt said the programme had [...] "proved as rambling and unfocused as the documentary that sparked the hour-long studio show, with 'neutral' host Richard Bacon veering across topics and adding his own opinions Jeremy Kyle-style." [...] Zoe Williams of The Guardian found the debate [...] "unsatisfactory", feeling the topics discussed were too broad, and that [...] Bacon was not an effective chair. However, Roz Laws of the Birmingham Mail described the debate as [...] "articulate" [...] and felt that [...] "interesting points were made, such {{as the fact that}} most people on benefits are pensioners yet we didn't see any of them on Benefits Street."
