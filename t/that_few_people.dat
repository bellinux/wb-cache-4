5|$|According to Mihardja, {{religious}} thinkers {{blasted the}} novel for depicting Hasan, whom they interpreted {{as representative of}} religion and religious people, as unable to overcome temptation; they also disliked the novel's lack of in-depth discussion of religion, necessary for {{a better understanding of}} theism. Marxists and anarchists also felt that their ideologies were not well explained. They considered Rusli and Anwar not truly representative of the thoughts of Karl Marx and Friedrich Nietzsche. In response, Mihardja wrote that the characters were meant to be realistic, and <b>that</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> have as much knowledge about an ideology as demanded by the critics.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} a mixed reception from critics. Author John Sellers listed {{it among the}} weirder arcade games released. Clare Edgeley of Computer and Video Games echoed similar statements. She criticized the game, stating that the constant blue background was dull and the game lacked longevity. Retro Gamers Darran Jones described the game as engrossing and obscure. He also expressed disappointment <b>that</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> remember it. Brett Alan Weiss of AllGame called Bubbles a slightly underrated game. He stated that while it lacked excitement, its gameplay was enjoyable. Weiss further commented that the control scheme was unique for its time, and {{that the number of}} on-screen objects moving smoothly was impressive.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, a Massey University {{study in}} New Zealand {{concluded}} that sailors from the Royal Navy, Royal New Zealand Navy and Fijian Navy who observed the tests from nearby ships later suffered {{adverse health effects}} from exposure to radioactive fallout, including cancer and genetic abnormalities in the veterans' children. Various veterans' organisations filed a class action lawsuit against the UK Ministry of Defence following {{the publication of the}} study. The effects of radioactive fallout from the Grapple tests were researched by a 2010 British Government study that concluded the fallout did not reach concentrations that could affect the surrounding nature. The Ministry of Defence maintained <b>that</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> were exposed to any radiation or contamination at all, and that studies had shown little or no health effects. An analysis of illnesses in veterans of Grapple and other weapons tests produced statistics that are hard to interpret. The veterans showed rates of illness that were slightly higher than the control group, but the control group had lower rates of illness than the population as a whole while the veterans had rates that were about the same. Neither of these results has a clear explanation.|$|E

25|$|In mid-2002 Air New Zealand {{announced}} it would reconfigure its domestic operations as a lower-cost airline, doing away with business class and meals on most domestic flights, the longest of which was 1 hour 50 minutes. The airline justified this new style of service (known as Express Class) on the basis <b>that</b> <b>few</b> <b>people</b> traveled business class and that travellers would rather save the money on airline ticket costs than pay extra for a meal. Although the company had online bookings for several years, it made internet sales its primary sales medium, abolished travel agents' commissions and added fees for agent, telephone and counter sales. The approach was an outstanding success, with a huge increase in internet bookings being recorded once the new fare structure was introduced, and domestic bookings eventually increasing by 23% on average. During July 2002, the airline announced an order for 15 Airbus A320-200 aircraft, to replace Boeing 737-300 and Boeing 767-200 aircraft then in use on the Tasman. Five of these would be purchased by the airline, whilst the other ten were to be leased.|$|E

Skilling constantly focused on meeting Wall Street expectations, advocated the use of mark-to-market accounting (accounting based on market value, which was then inflated) and pressured Enron executives {{to find new ways to}} hide its debt.
