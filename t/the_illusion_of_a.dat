5|$|Immediately {{after hearing}} the rumours about the Qurayza, Muhammad had sent 100 men to the inner city for its protection. Later he sent 300 {{horsemen}} (cavalry was not needed at the trench) as well to protect the city. The loud voices, in which the troops prayed every night, created <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large force.|$|E
5|$|Glimmer and Taxable {{were very}} similar operations. They were {{executed}} {{in the early hours}} of 6 June 1944 whilst the invasion fleet was approaching Normandy. Taxable simulated an invasion force approaching Cap d'Antifer and Glimmer threatened Pas-de-Calais. By dropping chaff in progressive patterns, Royal Air Force (RAF) bombers were able to create <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large fleet on coastal radar screens. Beneath the chaff, small boats towed radar reflector balloons and simulated the radio traffic expected of a large fleet. Once German forces were drawn to the coast, it was planned that the RAF would attempt to contain them in this region, and away from Normandy, by bombing bridges and roads.|$|E
5|$|The game {{is played}} from a third person {{perspective}} with the camera at a variable height and capable of rotating 360°, enabling the player to quickly move across the planet's terrain. While the terrain's topology is a torus, the map is locally projected onto a sphere to give <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> planet. On maps {{where there is no}} fog of war, players can see what opponents are doing at any time. Extensive support for 3D acceleration enables the player to view the game in 16-bit or 32-bit colour. The landscape and real-time structure building and follower movement are also shown.|$|E
50|$|Entrelac {{fabric is}} often felted to create <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> {{intarsia}} argyle pattern; the felting flattens the entrelac texture but leaves the different-colored squares, {{as if the}} object were knitted in different colors.|$|R
2500|$|Roebuck {{was built}} with {{two rows of}} windows in the stern, giving <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> extra deck but behind was a single-level cabin. This design was {{eventually}} phased out, {{with most of the}} Roebuck-class, after , featuring a traditional frigate-style stern.|$|R
50|$|A {{jump cut}} {{can be used}} to denote time. If a {{character}} leaves the frame on the left side and enters the frame on the left in a different location, it can give <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> extended amount <b>of</b> time passing.|$|R
5|$|The song {{featured}} two music videos. The {{first and}} most commonly seen video was filmed at Brooklyn Academy of Music performing arts center. The video features both singers, and begins with Houston and Carey performing in a large auditorium, giving <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> concert. Towards {{the end of the}} video, clips of the film are projected onto a large screen at the concert, while they belt out the final verse. The alternate video was only released on NBC's special, When You Believe: Music Inspired by the Prince of Egypt, broadcast on December 13, 1998. It features a similar synopsis, with both singers performing on a large stage of an old Egyptian pyramid.|$|E
5|$|Literary scholar M. Keith Booker {{argues that}} Vargas Llosa perfects the {{technique}} of interlacing dialogues in his novel The Green House. By combining two conversations that occur at different times, he creates <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> flashback. Vargas Llosa also sometimes uses this technique {{as a means of}} shifting location by weaving together two concurrent conversations happening in different places. This technique is a staple of his repertoire, which he began using {{near the end of his}} first novel, The Time of the Hero. However, he does not use interlacing dialogues in the same way in all of his novels. For example, in The Green House the technique is used in a serious fashion to achieve a sober tone and to focus on the interrelatedness of important events separated in time or space. In contrast, Captain Pantoja and the Special Service employs this strategy for comic effects and uses simpler spatial shifts. This device is similar to both Virginia Woolf's mixing of different characters' soliloquies and Gustave Flaubert's counterpoint technique in which he blends together conversation with other events, such as speeches.|$|E
5|$|McCrane had {{to spend}} hours in makeup {{in order to get}} the right effect and his eyes were colored with {{specially}} made contact lenses. Many of the scenes were physically exerting. The autopsy scene involved McCrane positioning himself through a hole in the table and sitting perfectly still, giving <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> disembodied head. The scene in the bathtub required McCrane to spend several minutes motionless underwater. The shot in which a new Betts emerges from the old one's mouth was created by Toby Lindala. Lindala used shots of McCrane intercut with shots of a puppet with full-functioning mouth and eyes. Laverne Basham and Lindala were later both nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Makeup in a Series. In addition, the machine that created a slice of Betts' head was designed by Ken Hawryliew.|$|E
50|$|In theatre, a box set is a {{set with}} a {{proscenium}} arch stage and three walls. The proscenium opening is the fourth wall. Box sets create <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> interior room on the stage, and are contrasted with earlier forms of sets in which sliding flats with gaps between them created <b>an</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> perspective.|$|R

50|$|Another common {{sales pitch}} leading to {{slamming}} involves misrepresentation of the slammers as account {{agents of the}} victim's current carrier, offering better rates or a free upgrade to existing service. Slammers using this pitch may even operate by sending bills attached to the victim's existing carrier's bills, further perpetrating <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> upgrade to existing service rather than an unauthorized service switch.|$|R
5|$|Production of {{components}} would be split between Breguet and BAC, and the aircraft themselves would be assembled on two production lines; {{one in the}} UK and one in France, To avoid any duplication of work, each aircraft component had only one source. The British light strike/tactical support versions were the most demanding design, requiring supersonic performance, superior avionics, a cutting edge nav/attack system of more accuracy and complexity than the French version, moving map display, laser range-finder and marked-target seeker (LRMTS). As a result, the initial Br.121 design needed a thinner wing, redesigned fuselage, a higher rear cockpit, and after-burning engines. While putting on smiling faces for the public, maintaining <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> shared design, the British design de facto departed from the French sub-sonic Breguet 121 {{to such a degree}} that it was for all intents and purposes a new design.|$|E
25|$|Maskelyne {{joined the}} Royal Engineers when the Second World War broke out, {{thinking}} that his skills {{could be used}} in camouflage. A story runs that he convinced skeptical officers by creating <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> German warship on the Thames using mirrors and a model.|$|E
25|$|Mercury(II) {{chloride}} {{was used}} as a photographic intensifier to produce positive pictures in the collodion process of the 1800s. When applied to a negative, the mercury(II) chloride whitens and thickens the image, thereby increasing the opacity of the shadows and creating <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> positive image.|$|E

50|$|Bloom (sometimes {{referred}} to as light bloom or glow) is a computer graphics effect used in video games, demos, and high dynamic range rendering (HDRR) to reproduce <b>an</b> imaging artifact <b>of</b> real-world cameras. The effect produces fringes (or feathers) of light extending from the borders of bright areas in an image, contributing to <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> extremely bright light overwhelming the camera or eye capturing the scene.|$|R

25|$|This 1959 artwork in the Tecelares series, {{takes the}} same woodblock carving {{technique}} and is incised by thin parallel lines which are disrupted by the non-orthogonal lines that {{cut across the}} print.

25|$|The {{lower jaw}} is {{straight}} and elongated. The jaw bone is rather low: the specimen creates <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> strong jaw because the left jaw is visible below the right one. It bears ten teeth. In the 1998 description {{a part of}} the splenial was mistaken for a supradentarium and the angular was misidentified as the surangular because in the fossil it had been displaced upwards, creating the false impression an external mandibular fenestra, an opening in the outer side of the jaw, would be present.|$|E

25|$|In 1900 Cornell anatomy {{professor}} G.S. Moler made {{an early}} movie using frame-by-frame technology. For The Skeleton Dance, he took single-frame photos {{of a human}} skeleton in varying positions, giving <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dancing skeleton. During the early 20th century, Ithaca was an important center in the silent film industry. These films often featured the local natural scenery. Many of these films were the work of Leopold Wharton and his brother Theodore; their studio was {{on the site of}} what is now Stewart Park.|$|E
25|$|The Titans fared {{a little}} better on the field but had their own {{financial}} troubles. Attendance was so low for home games that team owner Harry Wismer had fans move to seats closer to the field to give <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fuller stadium on television. Eventually Wismer {{could no longer afford}} to meet his payroll, and on November 8, 1962 the AFL took over operations of the team. The Titans were sold to a five-person ownership group headed by Sonny Werblin on March 28, 1963, and in April the new owners changed the team's name to the New York Jets.|$|E
25|$|A {{wraparound}} dentil cornice and a recessed peaked {{hipped roof}} creates <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> flat roof, {{just like a}} palazzo. On {{either side of the}} main entrance, a blind arch with an ornamental keystone contains a set of three steel-framed doors, along with a large arched window. Decorative friezes separate the arched window from the doors. When these entryway elements are combined, they create a processional experience through the entryway into the grand interior space. The flat-roof illusion, together with the axial symmetry, classical detailing in both structural and decorative elements, heavy ornamentation, and formal setting is typical of the Beaux-Arts style.|$|E
40|$|<b>The</b> Anne Boleyn <b>Illusion</b> {{exploits}} <b>the</b> somatotopic {{representation of}} touch to create <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> extra digit and demonstrates the instantaneous remapping of relative touch location into body-based coordinates through visuo-tactile integration. Performed successfully on thousands, {{it is also}} <b>a</b> simple demonstration <b>of</b> the flexibility of body representations for use at public events, in schools or {{in the home and}} can be implemented anywhere by anyone with a mirror and some degree of bimanual coordination...|$|R

40|$|We {{review the}} idea, due to Einstein, Eddington, Hoyle and Ballard, {{that time is}} a {{subjective}} label, whose primary purpose is to order events, perhaps in a higher-dimensional universe. In this approach, all moments in time exist simultaneously, but they are ordered to create <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> unfolding experience by some physical mechanism. This, {{in the language of}} relativity, may be connected to a hypersurface in a world that extends beyond spacetime. Death in such a scenario may be merely a phase change...|$|R
25|$|Over {{the next}} two days, {{settlers}} in the fort prepared for the siege. Based on faulty intelligence received from Hamilton in Detroit, Blackfish believed that {{there were at least}} 200 militiamen in the fort, when in fact there were only about 40 effective gunmen inside. The Kentuckians reinforced <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> greater number of men by having some {{of the women in the}} fort carry weapons while dressed in men's clothing. On the evening of September 8, Blackfish and Boone met again. Boone told a surprised Blackfish that the fort would not surrender. Blackfish proposed that a formal treaty conference with all of the leaders be held on the next day.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in 1975, the ABC {{soap opera}} General Hospital began using the {{facility}} for its exterior shots, appearing {{primarily in the}} show's opening sequence, where it still remains. The lower 'floors' of the show's Los Angeles studio (as with most television series, the show's one-floor set with several smaller floor sets features a dummy elevator to maintain <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> several-floor set) are modeled after the actual hospital's emergency room entrance, allowing for the show to shoot outdoor scenes in their own parking lot. On their spin-off, , the upper floors were edited in digitally to fit {{on top of the}} show's studio, creating a CGI look, modeled after the real hospital's original exterior. An animated version of the exterior is used in the current opening.|$|E
25|$|But {{in spite}} of such {{examples}} and of the positive conditions produced by the economic upturn and {{the high degree of}} technical innovation in the 3rd and 2nd centuries BC, Hellenistic religious architecture is mostly represented by a multitude of small temples in antis and prostyle temples, as well as tiny shrines (naiskoi). The latter had been erected in important places, on market squares, near springs and by roads, since the Archaic period, but reached their main flourish now. This limitation to smaller structures {{led to the development of}} a special form, the pseudoperipteros, which uses engaged columns along the cella walls to produce <b>the</b> <b>illusion</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> peripteral temple. An early case of this is temple L at Epidauros, followed by many prominent Roman examples, such as the Maison Carrée at Nîmes.|$|E
50|$|Gateways is a luxurious, {{experimental}} {{series of}} digital photo-sculptural work, deconstructing iconic Paris landscapes on large-scale mirrors.

By re-arranging, inverting, and folding in upon themselves iconic Paris landmarks, {{such as the}} Champs-Élysées and Pont Neuf, {{the city and its}} myth are dissected into its molecular building blocks. Printed on door-sized mirrors using an experimental process, Valentine challenges the viewer to reflect on their own complicity, and desires, in creating the Paris myth.|$|R
