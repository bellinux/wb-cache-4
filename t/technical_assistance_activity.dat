40|$|IntroductionThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has {{administered}} the Prevention Research Centers Program since 1986. We quantified {{the number and}} reach of training programs across all centers, determined whether the centers' outcomes varied by characteristics of the academic institution, and explored potential benefits of training and <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> for academic researchers and community partners. We characterized how these activities enhanced capacity building within Prevention Research Centers and the community. MethodsThe program office collected quantitative information on training across all 33 centers via its Internet-based system from April through December 2007. Qualitative {{data were collected from}} April through May 2007. We selected 9 centers each for 2 separate, semistructured, telephone interviews, 1 on training and 1 on <b>technical</b> <b>assistance.</b> ResultsAcross 24 centers, 4, 777 people were trained in 99 training programs in fiscal year 2007 (October 1, 2006 -September 30, 2007). Nearly 30 % of people trained were community members or agency representatives. Training and <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>activities</b> provided opportunities to enhance community partners' capacity in areas such as conducting needs assessments and writing grants and to improve the centers' capacity for cultural competency. ConclusionBoth qualitative and quantitative data demonstrated that training and <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>activities</b> can foster capacity building and provide a reciprocal venue to support researchers' and the community's research interests.

Taken at face value, and supposing that maximizing the positive effect on recipient authority performance is the sole objective of a <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> programme in competition law and enforcement, these findings have implications for the mix of <b>technical</b> <b>assistance</b> <b>activities</b> that should be offered to competition authorities.

40|$|This note {{begins by}} briefly {{addressing}} why competition policy {{is important for}} developing and transitioning economies. It then discusses some of the critical components of building a competition culture. Ideally, this process should begin by conducting a "needs assessment" {{in a number of}} areas. This assessment likely will lead to the identification of a list of steps that should be prioritised and undertaken. The priorities often can be grouped into three broad areas, namely, helping key constituencies to "buy in" to a competition culture, minimizing {{the extent to which a}} broad range of institutional mechanisms distort competition, and building an effective competition law enforcement regime to address private anticompetitive conduct. The note then summarizes the valuable perspectives of countries that have been providers or recipients of capacity building and <b>technical</b> <b>assistance.</b> It is based upon the responses to a questionnaire circulated in 2001 to delegates of the OECD’s Competition Committee and non-members who had been invited to participate in the second Global Forum on Competition, held in February 2002.
