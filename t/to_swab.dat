The two processes are mutually incompatible, as fingerprint developers destroy material that could potentially be used for DNA analysis, and swabbing is likely to make fingerprint identification impossible.|$|E
2500|$|Du Pont did {{not share}} the enthusiasm of the Navy Department for the armored vessels. Although they could {{withstand}} whatever punishment the coastal artillery of the day could mete out, their offensive capabilities were severely restricted. New Ironsides carried 16 guns (broadside, so only 8 could {{be brought to bear}} at one time), but each of the others carried only two guns. Each Passaic had one [...] and one [...] gun, while Keokuk carried two [...] guns. Although they were larger than the typical 32-pounder weapons that would be used against them, their rate of fire was much less. Seven minutes was needed <b>to</b> <b>swab,</b> reload, and aim between shots.|$|E

40|$|Detection of {{meningococcal}} carriers is key {{to understanding}} the epidemiology of Neisseria meningitidis, yet no gold standard has been established. Here, we directly compare two methods for collecting pharyngeal <b>swabs</b> <b>to</b> identify meningococcal carriers. We conducted cross-sectional surveys of schoolchildren at multiple sites in Africa <b>to</b> compare <b>swabbing</b> the posterior pharynx behind the uvula (U) <b>to</b> <b>swabbing</b> the posterior pharynx behind the uvula plus one tonsil (T). Swabs were cultured immediately and analyzed using molecular methods. One thousand and six paired swab samples collected from schoolchildren in four countries were analyzed. Prevalence of meningococcal carriage was 6. 9 % (95 % CI: 5. 4 - 8. 6 %) {{based on the results}} from both swabs, but the observed prevalence was lower based on one swab type alone. Prevalence based on the T swab or the U swab alone was similar (5. 2 % (95 % CI: 3. 8 - 6. 7 %) versus 4. 9 % (95 % CI: 3. 6 - 6. 4 %) respectively (p= 0. 6)). The concordance between the two methods was 96. 3 % and the kappa was 0. 61 (95 % CI: 0. 50 - 0. 73), indicating good agreement. These two commonly used methods for collecting pharyngeal swabs provide consistent estimates of the prevalence of carriage, but both methods misclassified carriers to some degree, leading to underestimates of the prevalence...|$|R

Mycoplasmas were detected by routine culture techniques and by the Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) technique, using 16 SrRNA generic primers of conserved region and Mycoplasma penetrans specific primers.

60|$|By {{this time}} the Paladin, who had gone {{away for a moment}} {{with the opening of the}} poem, was back again, and had stepped within the door. He stood there now, resting his great frame against the wall and gazing toward the reciter like one entranced. When Noel got to the second part, and that heart-breaking refrain began to melt and move all listeners, the Paladin began to wipe away tears with the back of first one hand and then the other. The next time the refrain was {{repeated}} he got to snuffling, and sort of half sobbing, and went to wiping his eyes with the sleeves of his doublet. He was so conspicuous that he embarrassed Noel a little, and also had an ill effect upon the audience. With the next repetition he broke quite down and began to cry like a calf, which ruined all the effect and started many to the audience to laughing. Then he went on from bad to worse, until I never saw such a spectacle; for he fetched out a towel from under his doublet and began <b>to</b> <b>swab</b> his eyes with it and let go the most infernal bellowings mixed up with sobbings and groanings and retchings and barkings and coughings and snortings and screamings and howlingsand he twisted himself about on his heels and squirmed this way and that, still pouring out that brutal clamor and flourishing his towel in the air and swabbing again and wringing it out. Hear? You couldn't hear yourself think. Noel was wholly drowned out and silenced, and those people were laughing the very lungs out of themselves. It was the most degrading sight that ever was. Now I heard the clankety-clank that plate-armor makes when the man that is in it is running, and then alongside my head there burst out the most inhuman explosion of laughter that ever rent the drum of a person's ear, and I looked, and it was La Hire; and the stood there with his gauntlets on his hips and his head tilted back and his jaws spread to that degree to let out his hurricanes and his thunders that it amounted to indecent exposure, for you could see everything that was in him. Only one thing more and worse could happen, and it happened: at the other door I saw the flurry and bustle and bowings and scrapings of officials and flunkeys which means that some great personage is comingthen Joan of Arc stepped in, and the house rose! Yes, and tried to shut its indecorous mouth and make itself grave and proper; but when it saw the Maid herself go to laughing, it thanked God for this mercy and the earthquake that followed.|$|E

40|$|A rapid {{method for}} the {{detection}} of Neisseria gonorrhoeae, making use of the ability of deoxyribonucleic acid samples from clinically isolated strains of this organism to transform nutritional mutants of a particular strain of N. gonorrhoeae, has been described. In addition to using isolated cultures, transforming deoxyribonucleic acid can be obtained directly from the material that adheres <b>to</b> <b>swabs</b> of the cervix or the urethra. The time interval for transfer of <b>swabs</b> <b>to</b> the diagnostic laboratory is not a significant factor. It is not necessary to use pure cultures on primary isolation plates to obtain definitive results. Nongonorrhoeae neisserias, as well as a large variety of commonly encountered unrelated bacteria, do not react or interfere in the transformation assay when using one of the mutant strains under a standardized set of conditions. The entire assay can be completed in less than 24 h. It has also been shown that type T 4 cells of the strain of N. gonorrhoeae employed in the present study are competent for genetic transformation, although type T 4 cells are transformed at a significantly lower frequency than are type T 2 cells of the same strain...|$|R
6000|$|... "No one answered. Still {{holding the}} pistol {{in his hand}} he gave me several more cuts, and then told me <b>to</b> <b>swab</b> the deck. I did it, pretending all the time I was scarce strong enough to keep my feet. Then I made my way forward and sat down against the bulwark, as if nigh done up, till night came. That night as I lay in my bunk I heard the men talking in whispers together. I judged from what {{they said that they}} {{intended}} to wait for another week, when they expected to enter Magellan Straits, and then to attack and throw the officers overboard. Nothing seemed settled as to what they would do afterwards. Some were in favor of continuing the voyage to port, and there giving out that the captain and officers had been washed overboard in a storm; when, if all stood true to each other, the truth could never be known, although suspicions might arise. The others, however, insisted that you never could be sure of every one, and that some one would be sure to peach. They argued in favor of sailing west and beaching the ship on one of the Pacific islands, where they could live comfortably and take wives among the native women. If they were ever found they could then say that the ship was blown out of her course and wrecked there, and that the captain and officers had been drowned or killed by the natives. It seemed to me that this party were the strongest. For the next week I was thrashed and kicked every day and had I been as weak as I pretended to be, I'm sure they would have killed me. However, thanks to the food Jans brought me, for I was put on bread and water, I held on. At last we entered the straits. The men were very quiet that day, and the captain in a worse temper than usual. I did not go to sleep, and turned out at the midnight watch, for I was made to keep watch although I was on duty all day. As the watch came in I heard them say to the others, 'In ten minutes' time.' Presently I saw them come out, and joining the watch on deck they went aft quietly in a body. They had all got handspikes in their hands. Then there was a rush. Two pistol shots were fired, {{and then there was a}} splash, and I knew that the officer on watch was done for. Then they burst into the aft cabins. There were pistol shots and shouts, and for three or four minutes the fight went on. Then all was quiet. Then they came up on deck again and I heard three splashes, that accounted for the captain and the two other mates. I thought it safe now to go aft. I found that six of the men had been killed. These were thrown overboard, and then the crew got at the spirit stores and began to drink. I looked about for Jans, and found him presently sitting on the deck by the bulwark.|$|E
