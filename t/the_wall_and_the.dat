5|$|Nearly all {{the action}} of the episode happens during travel: Eddard Stark and his daughters {{accompany}} the king's entourage to King's Landing to occupy the post of Hand of the King, Tyrion Lannister joins Jon in his travel to <b>the</b> <b>Wall,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> newly wed Daenerys goes with her husband's khalasar to the city of Vaes Dothrak. Meanwhile, in Winterfell a grieving Catelyn Stark watches over her unconscious son Bran.|$|E
5|$|The largest Maya sculptures {{consisted}} of architectural façades crafted from stucco. The rough form {{was laid out}} on a plain plaster base coating on <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> three-dimensional form was built up using small stones. Finally, this was coated with stucco and moulded into the finished form; human body forms were first modelled in stucco, with their costumes added afterwards. The final stucco sculpture was then brightly painted. Giant stucco masks were used to adorn temple façades by the Late Preclassic, and such decoration continued into the Classic period.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} and western {{parts of the}} walls were originally faced with a local ashlar sandstone with a core of basalt rubble; the sandstone was mostly quarried at Howick. The sandstone has since been stripped from the western parts of <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sandstone along {{the eastern end of}} the walls gives way to small limestone blocks, originally only laid 11-foot (3.3 m) high with a 4-foot 11 inches (1.5 m) parapet, but later raised in height with additional basalt boulders, probably during the Wars of the Roses. It is uncertain if the curtain wall originally extended above the cliffs along the northern edge of the castle.|$|E

5|$|The video {{opens with}} a shot {{of a little girl}} {{sleeping}} in her bed. As the music starts, rays of light emanate from the bedside radio with cartoon violins playing the music. The sun rises inside a picture on <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> girl wakes and starts playing with her doll. A fairy goes around tapping all her toys on the floor and a large, golden teapot comes alive and shoots a rainbow from its spout. A cartoon version of the girl then slides along the rainbow and, interpreting the lyrics of the song, catches a falling star and rides over the moon.|$|E

The Chiayi Station is colored silver, gray, and green to {{represent}} its well-preserved surroundings. The Tainan Station is colored reddish brown to represent its rich historical heritage. Art projects for the Chiayi Station will respond to the natural landscape or the high-tech images of the medical science park that will be constructed close by in the near future.

5|$|Upon {{finding the}} girl, the bishop summoned his council and it {{decided that the}} girl should be immured in {{the wall of the}} chapel and the canon was to be put in prison where he was starved to death. The {{builders}} left a cavity into <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> poor girl with a piece of bread and a mug of water was walled in. For some time her cries for help were heard. Yet her soul could not find the peace and, as a result, she appears on the Baptistery’s window to grieve for her beloved man already for centuries, and also to prove the immortality of love.|$|E

5|$|When the Romans {{set up a}} {{temporary}} castra, two maniples (without their velites) were selected to pitch the tents of the headquarters and officers, and details were made for fatigue duty, to get wood and water, and to give food and water to the animals accompanying them. The rest of the men, excepting velites and officers, set up the tents of the soldiers. During this time the velites would guard the outside of <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> wall itself, {{while the rest of}} the troops would guard the interior. The watch, which was composed of eight men led by a decurion, ran from 6 am to 6 pm, and was divided into four shifts, each of three hours.|$|E
5|$|In July 1978, amid a {{financial}} crisis caused by negligent investments, Waters presented the group with two original ideas for their next album. The first was a 90-minute demo with the working title Bricks in <b>the</b> <b>Wall,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> other would later become Waters' first solo album, The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking. Although both Mason and Gilmour were initially cautious, they chose the former to be their next album. Bob Ezrin co-produced, and he wrote a forty-page script for the new album. Ezrin based {{the story on the}} central figure of Pink—a gestalt character inspired by Waters' childhood experiences, the most notable of which was {{the death of his father}} in World War II. This first metaphorical brick led to more problems; Pink would become drug-addled and depressed by the music industry, eventually transforming into a megalomaniac, a development inspired partly by the decline of Syd Barrett. At the end of the album, the increasingly fascist audience would watch as Pink tore down the wall, once again becoming a regular and caring person.|$|E
5|$|The {{start of}} the game was {{postponed}} 80 minutes due to a rain delay, pushing the start time to 9:17p.m. The cast of the television series Glee (with Amber Riley singing lead) performed the national anthem prior to the game {{as part of a}} ceremony featuring a large American flag and several members of the armed services. The Phillies scored first with Jayson Werth's lead-off solo home run, which was followed by a bases-loaded walk and a sacrifice fly to make the score 3–0 {{in the bottom of the}} second inning. Following Mark Teixeira's walk in the top of the fourth inning, Alex Rodriguez hit a deep ball down the right field line. It was originally ruled a double and Teixeira held at third base. The play was reviewed using MLB instant replay, which revealed that the ball had struck a camera sticking over the top of <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ball was ruled a two-run home run, giving Rodriguez his first World Series hit. This was the first home run reviewed by instant replay in postseason play. Specifically, the ball hit a camera owned by Fox and MLB which extended slightly over the right field wall. The camera was moved back for Game4 such that its lens was in line with the wall. Coincidentally, Alex Rodriguez also had the first regular season home run reviewed by replay.|$|E

5|$|The {{cases that}} were known in West Berlin {{provoked}} demonstrations among the population. Members of the Senate inspected the crime scenes {{and spoke to}} the press as well as public audiences. Various groups, and also individuals, launched protest campaigns against <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> shootings. The fact that Peter Fechter bled to death in plain view of the public without anybody being able to help him lead to spontaneous mass demonstrations, which in turn resulted in riots in the following night. West Berlin policemen and US soldiers prevented a storming of the Wall. Buses bringing Soviet soldiers to the Tiergarten where they were to guard the Soviet War Memorial were pelted with stones by protesters. The incident also lead to anti-American protests, which were condemned by Willy Brandt. In the ensuing time, loudspeaker cars were sporadically set up at the Wall, urging the GDR border guards not to shoot at refugees and warning them of possible consequences. As a result of the shootings, West German groups lodged complaints with the UN Commission on Human Rights. The non-partisan Kuratorium Unteilbares Deutschland (Committee for an Indivisible Germany) sold protest placards and lapel pins in all of West Germany against the border regime and its consequences. Initially, West Berlin's regulatory authorities gave fugitives covering fire if they were being fired at by GDR border guards. This resulted in at least one lethal incident on 23 May 1962, when the border guard Peter Göring was shot dead by a West Berlin policeman while firing 44 times at a fleeing boy.|$|E
25|$|Between the {{two main}} faces, the Southwest (on the left when looking {{directly}} at <b>the</b> <b>wall)</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Southeast, is a prow. While today there are numerous established routes on both faces, {{the most popular and}} historically famous route is The Nose, which follows the south buttress.|$|E
25|$|The priory was {{originally}} known as The Parsonage. This building was situated on Ford Road, was constructed before 1850, {{and was used}} as the vicarage until 1911. The building was quite large, with seven bedrooms. The building no longer stands, having been demolished in the 1950s. However, <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> walled-in gateway still remain, on Ford Road.|$|E

25|$|After 1890, {{apart from}} continual {{improvements}} to the Fort's guns and their emplacements {{and the construction of}} search-light apertures, little development took place within the Fort until World War I from 1914-18. Around 1915, substantial development occurred along the northern boundary of the parade ground which involved the removal of an old shrapnel mound from behind <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> erection of a number of timber barracks and mess buildings.|$|E
25|$|Stars {{from both}} {{promotions}} made appearances for PCW such as TNA's Alexis Laree, Frankie Kazarian, Amazing Red and The S.A.T.

From the World Wrestling Federation included former and then current superstars such as Jimmy Snuka, Gillberg, Gangrel, Eddie Guerrero and Three Minute Warning (Rosey and Jamal). A number of WWE developmental wrestlers from Ohio Valley Wrestling spent time in the promotion including Kara Drew, Charlie Haas, Mike Kruel, Tank Toland and The Basham Brothers (Doug and Danny Basham).|$|E
25|$|Neutral monists {{adhere to}} the {{position}} that perceived {{things in the world}} can be regarded as either physical or mental depending on whether one is interested in their relationship to other things in the world or their relationship to the perceiver. For example, a red spot on a wall is physical in its dependence on <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> pigment of which it is made, but it is mental in so far as its perceived redness depends on the workings of the visual system. Unlike dual-aspect theory, neutral monism does not posit a more fundamental substance of which mind and body are aspects.|$|E
50|$|The Senate chamber {{is located}} in a wing added to the {{original}} structure between 1902 <b>and</b> 1905. <b>The</b> room is illuminated by a Tiffany-style skylight above.

25|$|The smaller {{diameter}} of the tube train {{in relation to the}} tunnel allowed the first car to ride up over the hydraulic buffers, with the second coach driving under the first, leading to significant damage at this end. The leading driving car buckled at three points into a V shape and was crushed to less than half its length between <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> weight of the train piling up behind it. The third car was damaged at both ends, more significantly at the leading end as it rode over the second car. Forty-two passengers and the driver died and 74 passengers were treated in hospital for their injuries.|$|E

He made a sudden leap for it but struck <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> ball caromed back onto the field. He landed on his feet, clapped his head with his arm, sank slowly to his knees and fell flat on the ground. He was removed on a stretcher and taken to a hospital.|$|E
