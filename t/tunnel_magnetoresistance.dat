The MTJ's usual two device resistance states, {{characterized by a}} parallel or antiparallel alignment of electrode magnetization, are altered by applying an electric field.

Since a fully spin-polarized current flows from the half-metallic LSMO electrode, within the Julliere model, this sign change suggests a sign change in the effective spin polarization of the STO/CoCr interface. The origin to this multistate effect lies with the observed migration of Cr into the barrier and its state of oxidation. The sign change of TMR can originate from modifications to the STO/CoCr interface density of states, as well as from changes to the tunneling landscape at the STO/CoCr interface induced by CrOx redox reactions.|$|E

40|$|For several years, {{thin films}} of {{ferromagnetic}} materials with metallic spacer layers showing giant magnetoresistance (GMR) were the technological basis {{used in the}} read-heads of hard disk drives. Similarly, <b>tunnelling</b> <b>magnetoresistance</b> (TMR), which is an effect typically larger than giant magnetoresistance, occurs when the metallic spacer layers are substituted by an insulating layer. Read-heads based on <b>tunnelling</b> <b>magnetoresistance</b> have been available to the consumer market {{for the last couple}} of years. Furthermore, nonvolatile random access memories, also known as magnetic random access memory (MRAM) have also been possible thanks to the use of the <b>tunnelling</b> <b>magnetoresistance</b> effect and have recently been introduced to the consumer market. These technological advances have been possible thanks to years of extensive study and optimization devoted to such effects. Following this logic, we arrive at the conclusion that an effect that produces higher magnetoresistance ratios but uses lower magnetic fields or even only electric currents is highly desired and could be useful for the design and fabrication of spintronic devices of tomorrow. In this thesis, the use of electron beam lithography (EBL) and a bilayer liftoff process to fabricate magnetic Ni nanostructures with constrictions in the range of 12 to 60 nm is reported. These structures were fabricated based upon the constricted nanowire (CNW) and nanobridge (NB) geometries. High control and reproducibility in the fabrication of such geometries have been achieved with the introduced bilayer liftoff process. This is important because it provides the opportunity to study the statistics of the domain wall magnetoresistance (DWMR) effect and assess its reproducibility. Additionally, micromagnetic simulations of the fabricated structures were carried out and it was found that domain walls (DWs) with reduced widths down to 48 and 42. 5 nm, can be achieved using the CNW and NB geometries, respectively. The magnetoresistance effect due to the presence of a DW has been estimated using dimensions achieved experimentally. Furthermore, the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) effect was obtained numerically and it was found to be smaller than DWMR. This opens the possibility of using the fabricated structures for more systematic studies of DWMR. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

The MTJ's usual two device resistance states, {{characterized by a}} parallel or antiparallel alignment of electrode magnetization, are altered by applying an electric field.

Since a fully spin-polarized current flows from the half-metallic LSMO electrode, within the Julliere model, this sign change suggests a sign change in the effective spin polarization of the STO/CoCr interface. The origin to this multistate effect lies with the observed migration of Cr into the barrier and its state of oxidation. The sign change of TMR can originate from modifications to the STO/CoCr interface density of states, as well as from changes to the tunneling landscape at the STO/CoCr interface induced by CrOx redox reactions. Reports on MgO-based memristive switching within MgO-based MTJs appeared starting in 2008and 2009. While the drift of oxygen vacancies within the insulating MgO layer has been proposed to describe the observed memristive effects, another explanation could be charge trapping/detrapping on the localized states of oxygen vacanciesand its impact on spintronics. This highlights the importance of understanding what role oxygen vacancies play in the memristive operation of devices that deploy complex oxides with an intrinsic property such as ferroelectricity or multiferroicity.|$|E
