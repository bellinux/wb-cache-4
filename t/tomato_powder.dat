Little is known concerning the effect on plant growth of hydrolysates obtained by alkaline treatment of non-composted vegetal residues. The {{aim of this study}} was to prepare, characterize, and apply in horticulture the soluble and the insoluble fractions obtained by alkaline hydrolysis of exhausted tomato plants. The hydrolysates were prepared in a pilot plant from the tomato plants residue in powder form and characterized by solid state 13 C NMR spectrometry, elemental analysis and potentiometric titration. The characterization of the soluble hydrolysate gave evidence of lignin and hemicellulose moieties, together with protein, peptide or amino acids while most of the cellulose was found in the insoluble fraction. Plant beans were grown on a peat and sand substrate fertilized with low application rate of the <b>tomato</b> plant <b>powder</b> and of the corresponding hydrolysates. The effect on bean plants was assessed by determination of plant growth, chlorophyll content, nitrate reductase, glutamine synthetase, glutamate synthase activities and soluble proteins. The <b>tomato</b> plant <b>powder</b> had no effect on all parameters measured on the grown bean plants. On the contrary, the insoluble and soluble substances sourced by alkaline hydrolysis of the <b>tomato</b> plant <b>powder</b> exhibit strong effects, mainly the increase of nitrogen assimilation typical of biostimulants.

To identify which vegetable additive is the best to use to improve the functional and sensory characteristics of minced meat preparations. 7. To evaluate the loss of carotenoids in the minced meat after heat treatment. It was found that for the fermentation of the <b>tomato</b> <b>powder,</b> it is better to use starting micro-organisms instead of fermenting with natural self-starters, or to use non-fermented vegetable products; because this fermentation technology enables ones to sharpen the brightness, redness, yellowness, purity and other colors tone products. For the fermentation of the <b>tomato</b> <b>powder,</b> using Lactobacillus sacei starting products is the best way, because in the longer timescale a microbial breakdown – mold – of a product is unnoticed and the substrate of <b>tomato</b> <b>powder</b> is the most favorable environment for these micro-organisms in comparison to spontaneous leaven and Pediococcus pentosaceus (1. 4 x 108 CFU / g). Fermentation is the right way to extract more carotenoids from <b>tomato</b> <b>powder</b> and for this fermentation, Lactobacillus sacei micro-organisms are especially suitable (carotenoids obtained 98. 96 mg/ 100 g). Thermal minced meat preparations processing and the usage of various vegetables additives affect the firmness, consistency, homogeneity and viscosity index of the product. In order to ensure the red color of heat-treated minced meat preparations, they should be produced with 30 % <b>tomato</b> <b>powder,</b> fermented Pediococcus pentosaceus (redness increased 1. 82 NAF), and with 30 % <b>tomato</b> <b>powder,</b> fermented Lactobacillus sacei (redness increased 1. 19 NAF). Pediococcus pentosaceus and Lactobacillus sacei fermentation bacteria added to the semi-makes up till 30 % improve the minced meat functional characteristics (total carotenoids, respectively 12. 08 and 11. 61 mg/ 100 g).

40|$|Several {{studies have}} linked the high intake of {{lycopene}} or tomatoes products with lower risk for metabolic diseases. The {{aim of the}} present study was to evaluate and to compare the effect of lycopene and <b>tomato</b> <b>powder</b> on obesity-associated disorders. METHODS AND RESULTS: Male C 57 BL/J 6 mice were assigned into four groups to receive: control diet (CD), high fat diet (HFD), high fat diet supplemented with lycopene or with <b>tomato</b> <b>powder</b> (TP) for 12 weeks. In HFD condition, lycopene and TP supplementation significantly reduced adiposity index, organ, and relative organ weights, serum triglycerides, free fatty acids, 8 -iso-prostaglandin GF 2 α and improved glucose homeostasis, but did not affect total body weight. Lycopene and TP supplementation prevented HFD-induced hepatosteatosis and hypertrophy of adipocytes. Lycopene and TP decreased HFD-induced proinflammatory cytokine mRNA expression in the liver and in the epididymal adipose tissue. The anti-inflammatory effect of lycopene and TP was related to a reduction in the phosphorylation levels of IκB, and p 65, and resulted in a decrease of inflammatory proteins in adipose tissue. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that lycopene or TP supplementation display similar beneficial health effects that could be particularly relevant in the context of nutritional approaches to fight obesity-associated pathologies...|$|E

40|$|<b>Powdered</b> <b>tomato</b> was {{produced}} by spray drying the tomato pulp. A full 2 ³ factorial design with the central point was used, varying the feed flow rate (127 - 276 g/min), air inlet temperature (200 - 220 ºC) and the atomisation speed (25, 000 - 35, 000 rpm). The responses analysed were: moisture content, solubility, wettability consistency and colour, but the factors only significantly affected the colour parameter. All the samples became significantly darker and less red with an increase of the variables under study. A low atomisation speed (25, 000 rpm) and lower inlet air temperature (220 ºC) produced the powders with a higher colour index (a/b) and less darkening...|$|R

Delay {{and prevention of}} aging {{is a major concern}} for a great number of people. Thepurpose of this research was to develop and evaluate the efficacy of an anti-wrinkle tomato lotion,consisting of 5 % w/w <b>tomato</b> <b>powder</b> in an oil-in-water (O/W) emulsion. Methods: Different O/W emulsions were prepared and stability tests were done on them. Theformulation that successfully passed the stability tests, was chosen and the Solanum lycopersicumpowder was added to the oily phase of this O/W emulsion. The prepared lotion was evaluated forpharmaceutical tests. In vitro permeation studies were performed to measure permeation throughcellulose acetate membrane by diffusion cell at sink condition. In vivo trial for examination of theanti-wrinkle efficacy of lotion was done on 10 healthy women as case group compared with 10 volunteers using the placebo lotion (lotion base without Solanum lycopersicum powder) as controlgroup. Results: According to the experimented results on the formulated lotion, the efficient time durationfor lotion effectiveness was 42 days. <b>Tomato</b> <b>powder</b> formulated in base of lotion significantlydecreased wrinkles.

40|$|Cherry {{tomatoes}} {{are rich in}} antioxidants, which may protect against neurodegeneration and consequent memory loss. This {{study was conducted to}} investigate the effect of cherry tomatoes on scopolamine-induced amnesia in mice. Male ICR mice (4 weeks old) were maintained for 4 weeks on a diet containing 10 or 20 % <b>tomato</b> <b>powder</b> (TP), and then administered scopolamine (1 mg/kg body weight, i. p.) 45 min before memory testing. Passive avoidance and Morris water maze testing revealed that scopolamine-induced amnesia was significantly reduced in the TP groups compared to the non TP-received (control) group. Accordingly, acetylcholinesterase activities in the serum and brain of TP groups were lower than those in the control group. These findings suggest that cherry tomatoes may be useful for the prevention of neurodegenerative diseases such as amnesia and Alzheimer’s disease...|$|E

Therefore, the development of cognitive enhancement is required. Recent findings showed that oxidative stress played the important role {{on the development of}} cognitive impairment in various conditions. Therefore the development of cognitive enhancer from vegetable possessing antioxidant is focused. The present study is carried out to determine the effect of dried <b>tomato</b> pomace <b>powder</b> on learning and memory both in normal and cognitive impairment conditions. Adult male Wistar rats, weighing 180 - 200 g, were orally given dried tomato pomace at various doses ranging from 2, 10 and 50 mg kg - 1 BW at a period of 14 days. The animals were determined the cognitive enhancing effect of tomato pomace after single dose, 7 and 14 days after administration. The results showed that tomato pomace significantly decreased escape latency but increased retention time. In addition, we also determined the cognitive enhancing effect of this substance in cognitive deficit condition. In this part, all animals were induced cognitive deficit using scopolamine injection via intraperitoneal route after 14 days of treatment. Again, tomato pomace also improved cognitive impairment. Tomato pomace is the potential cognitive enhancer. However, the precise underlying mechanism is still required further investigation...|$|R
40|$|The {{brain is}} highly {{sensitive}} to lead intoxication. Plant-derived products with antioxidant activity have been useful in reducing lead-induced neurotoxicity. The present {{study investigated the}} possible protective effect of <b>tomato</b> pomace <b>powder</b> (TPP) on brain damage induced by lead acetate (LAc) in rats. Thirty rats were divided equally into five groups: control; propylene glycol; TPP (50 mg/kg), LAc (50 mg/kg), and LAc+ TPP. All treatments were administered orally by gavage for 42 days. Rats were euthanized on day 43 of experiment. Behavioural tests, oxidative and blood parameters were done and brain tissue was examined with regard to histological parameters. Results indicated that LAc significantly (p< 0. 05) induced increased levels of lipid peroxidation and activity of SOD, but reduced GSH level. Similarly LAc caused alteration in the haematological and behavioural parameters, and microscopic anatomy of the cerebellum, dentate gyrus, and Cornu Ammonis 3 of rats. These alterations were significantly (p< 0. 05) reversed by 50 mg/kg co-treatment of TPP with LAc {{when compared with the}} LAc group. In conclusion, co-treatment with TPP offered relative protection from LAc-induced neuropathy, motor abnormality and oxidative impairment.
