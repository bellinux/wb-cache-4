5|$|In 1996, Copeland {{initially}} made $210 {{per week}} {{while working for}} WWF without an official contract. The company also paid for his outstanding college debt, which was around $40,000. After a Grand Prix Wrestling tour {{in the summer of}} 1997, De Marco urged Copeland to go to Calgary, where Hart was informally training wrestlers while recovering from knee surgery. He spent his tour earnings on a plane ticket and landed with no money or place to stay. He called Johnny Smith, whom he would met twice, and Smith agreed to give him food and shelter. Smith also drove Copeland to and from <b>the</b> <b>gym</b> <b>and</b> Hart's house, where he trained alongside Ken Shamrock, Test, Mark Henry and Kurrgan. Copeland returned to the Maritimes for another Grand Prix tour before going back to Hart's house, bringing Christian with him. After this camp, Hart was impressed enough to put in a good word for both men at the WWF.|$|E
5|$|His brother {{claims that}} Stauskas scored about 50 {{points a game}} in middle school. For much of his youth, he and future Gonzaga point guard Kevin Pangos {{attended}} basketball camps together, regularly playing one-on-one while other campers took breaks from basketball for other activities. Until 2009, Stauskas played for Loyola Catholic Secondary School. He averaged 15 points, 5 rebounds and 5 assists in 2007–08 and 32 points, 14 rebounds and 7.5 assists in 2008–09. Its basketball team nearly disbanded before Stauskas's grade 10 season in 2008–09, when Loyola {{was in danger of}} not fielding a team because school policy required the presence of a teacher. Although his father, a computer consultant, was willing to volunteer as a coach, no teacher was willing to serve. Stauskas's father finally found a French teacher who sat in <b>the</b> <b>gym</b> <b>and</b> graded papers while his father coached. In the meantime, Stauskas joined the premier Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) team in Toronto, run by Ro Russell. Some of Russell's prior players, such as Tristan Thompson and Cory Joseph had gone to the United States to complete their scholastic years. Stauskas, not wishing to risk not having a team to play on after the crisis of 2008–2009, spent the 2009–10 academic year at South Kent School, but the forested rural campus made him homesick and he transferred to St. Mark's School the following year. He missed the 2009–10 basketball season {{as a result of a}} hip injury. Michigan Wolverines men's basketball head coach John Beilein became familiar with Stauskas during the Summer 2010 NBA camp prior to Stauskas's junior year. Stauskas visited Michigan that summer and was also being recruited by Villanova, Iowa State, Georgetown, Notre Dame, Florida and Providence. By the time he arrived at St. Mark's, he was expected to be an All-State performer. In the 2011 NEPSAC Class AA Championship game, Stauskas led St. Mark's in scoring with 17 points against Nerlens Noel and the Tilton School, but St. Marks lost 72–56. On March 26, 2011, Stauskas made a verbal commitment to Michigan. This commitment made him the second member of Michigan's recruiting class of 2012. That summer he scored 27 points in an exhibition of Canadian high school all-stars against the Baylor Bears men's basketball team.|$|E

25|$|In 1947, Coach Wood {{followed}} Roscoe's superintendent {{to become}} Seminole, Texas High School's head coach. Seminole offered better pay, a larger high school, and a less stressful job. Coach Wood {{was no longer}} a principal, had no math courses to teach, and was helped by three assistants. It was at Seminole that Coach Wood first hired Morris Southall to be his assistant coach. The two became lifelong friends and coached together for thirty-one years. In 1947, Seminole won the district championship with nine wins and one loss but lost {{the first game of the}} state playoffs. The next season the football team went 6-3-1, followed by a 4-4-2 season in 1949. After the 1949 season, Coach Wood resigned as head coach, leaving Seminole with nineteen wins, nine losses, and three ties. Coach Southall took over as head coach at Seminole, while Coach Wood moved on to Winters High School. At Winters, Coach Wood's football team went 6-4 in 1950, but the poor condition of <b>the</b> <b>gym</b> <b>and</b> neglect from the school board caused him to resign after only one season.|$|E

25|$|The College {{steadily}} grew {{during its}} first 35 years, and by 1904, the campus had expanded to include Engle Hall, home of the music department, and a partially completed library funded by Andrew Carnegie. On Christmas Eve 1904, North College (not {{to be confused with}} the residence hall with the same name), which stood in the current footprint of the Administration/Humanities building, burned down. The next year, the College raised funds to rebuild and also began expanding the campus further, building not only a new Administration Building (the current Humanities Building), but also North Hall (a women's dorm, currently the site of Miller Chapel), Kreider Hall (a men's residence hall where the current Neidig-Garber Science Center is located), the central heating plant (still in existence), a science building, and a gymnasium. However, funding ran out, debt rose, and building halted on <b>the</b> <b>gym</b> <b>and</b> science buildings. President Hervin U. Roop resigned in disgrace on New Year's Day, 1906. It was not until President Lawrence W. Keister took office on June 12, 1907 that the debt situation was solved. Thanks to his fundraising efforts, the debt was eliminated by 1911. The college landscape remained relatively unchanged for the next four decades, though the cultural changes paralleled that of the rest of the country as it moved through World War I, the Roaring Twenties, the Great Depression, and the New Deal.|$|E
