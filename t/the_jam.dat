30|$|In {{the above}} network models, {{in order to}} {{maximize}} their profits, each cooperative jamming node needs not only to compete with other jamming nodes, but also to compete with the source node. For the source node, it will optimize the power allocation between the source node and <b>the</b> various <b>jamming</b> nodes based on the power price provided by <b>the</b> cooperative <b>jamming</b> node. For each of <b>the</b> <b>jamming</b> nodes, they must provide the optimal power price to maximize the utility. Between all <b>the</b> <b>jamming</b> nodes, they compete with each other by constantly adjusting their power prices. As a result, the source node can be regarded as the main party of the game, and <b>the</b> <b>jamming</b> node is regarded as a slave. Therefore, there is a Stackelberg game between the source node and <b>the</b> <b>jamming</b> nodes, while all <b>the</b> <b>jamming</b> nodes are non-cooperative games [21].|$|R

5|$|A {{handful of}} pub rock acts managed to achieve {{mainstream}} success after {{the advent of}} punk rock, often being re-categorised as new wave music, including Graham Parker and the Rumour, Nick Lowe, Squeeze and Elvis Costello. London-based R pub rock bands received a major boost when <b>The</b> <b>Jam</b> kicked off the mod revival in 1977 with their debut album In the City, which mixed R standards with originals modelled on The Who's early singles. They confirmed their status as the leading mod revival band with their third album All Mod Cons (1978), on which Paul Weller's song-writing drew heavily on the British-focused narratives of the Kinks. Pub rock bands like Red Beans and Rice, The Little Roosters, The Inmates, Nine Below Zero and Eddie and the Hot Rods, became major acts in the growing mod revival scene in London. Other bands grew up to feed the desire for mod music, often combining the music of 60s mod groups with elements of punk music, including The Lambrettas, The Merton Parkas, Squire, and Purple Hearts. These acts managed to develop cult followings and some had pop hits, before the revival petered out in the early 80s. Weller broke up <b>The</b> <b>Jam</b> in 1982 and formed The Style Council, who abandoned most {{of the elements of}} punk to adopt music much more based in R and early soul. Some major figures of the movement, including Robert Palmer and Steve Winwood, re-emerged as solo artists in the early 1980s, being as defined as blue-eyed soul singers.|$|E
5|$|After {{a longer}} hiatus, Rodman {{returned}} {{to play basketball}} for the Long Beach Jam of the newly formed American Basketball Association during the 2003–04 season, with hopes of being called up to the NBA midseason. While {{he did not get}} that wish that season, he did help <b>the</b> <b>Jam</b> win the ABA championship in their inaugural season. He also played in Mexico, with Fuerza Regia in 2004. In the following 2004–05 season, he signed with the ABA's Orange County Crush and the following season with the league's Tijuana Dragons. In November 2005, he played one match for Torpan Pojat of the Finland's basketball league, Korisliiga.|$|E
5|$|Some new bands, such as London's Alternative TV, Edinburgh's Rezillos, and Leamington's the Shapes, {{identified}} with the scene even as they pursued more experimental music. Others of a comparatively traditional rock 'n' roll bent were also swept up by the movement: the Vibrators, formed as a pub rock–style act in February 1976, soon adopted a punk look and sound. A few even longer-active bands including Surrey neo-mods <b>the</b> <b>Jam</b> and pub rockers the Stranglers and Cock Sparrer also became associated with the punk rock scene. Alongside the musical roots shared with their American counterparts and the calculated confrontationalism of the early Who, the British punks also reflected the influence of glam rock and related bands such as Slade, T.Rex, and Roxy Music. One of the groups openly acknowledging that influence were the Undertones, from Derry in Northern Ireland.|$|E

5|$|The Quadrophenia {{film was}} {{released}} that year. It {{was directed by}} Franc Roddam in his feature-directing début, and had straightforward acting rather than musical numbers as in Tommy. John Lydon was considered for Jimmy, but the role went to Phil Daniels. Sting played Jimmy's friend and fellow mod, the Ace Face. The soundtrack was Jones' first appearance on a Who record, performing on newly written material not on the original album. The film was a critical and box office success in the UK and appealed to the growing mod revival movement. <b>The</b> <b>Jam</b> were influenced by the Who, and critics noticed a similarity between Townshend and the group's leader, Paul Weller.|$|E
5|$|The loud {{volume of}} the band's live show {{influenced}} the approach of hard rock and heavy metal. Proto punk and punk rock bands such as the MC5, the Stooges, the Ramones the Sex Pistols, the Clash and Green Day cite the Who as an influence. The Who inspired mod revival bands, particularly <b>the</b> <b>Jam,</b> which helped other groups influenced by the Who become popular. The Who influenced hard rock bands such as Guns N' Roses. In the mid-1990s, Britpop bands such as Blur and Oasis were influenced by the Who. The Who have also influenced pop punk band Panic! at the Disco.|$|E
5|$|It’s straightforward, heartfelt and classy. Mariah pleads {{with her}} {{departed}} lover – 'When you left I lost {{a part of}} me / It’s still so hard to believe' – and the song’s gentle R roll is perfectly understated, built from a few piano chords and a slowed-down So So Def rhythm. It has a homebody quality, almost like an autumn song would – you can imagine a split-up couple singing it quietly, separately, as the world goes on around them. She’s on a porch with tea; he’s stuck in traffic when he finds Mariah on the radio. It even cleverly references that feel, with Mariah finding the Bobby Womack and Babyface songs on her radio just too tough to hear. There’s no tired 'I tried to 2-way you' retorts, no trash-technology love affair 'I was at the grocery store and this guy had the same ring tone as you, and I cried.' No, there’s a classic sensibility to the lyrics and sound of 'We Belong Together' that makes for perfect – and perfectly universal – pop/R songwriting. In other words, it’s <b>the</b> <b>jam.</b> And there’s probably a happy ending, too: Mariah’s triumphant octave shift finale makes the song’s title an emphatic.|$|E

By flexible controlling the parameters of interrupted-sampling pulse and pseudo-random sequence, different covering distances and jamming effects will be achieved. When <b>the</b> <b>jamming</b> power is equivalent, this jamming obtains higher process gain compared with non-coherent <b>jamming.</b> <b>The</b> <b>jamming</b> signal enhances <b>the</b> detection threshold and the real target avoids being detected.

40|$|Abstract—For {{coherent}} jammers to wideband linear {{frequency modulation}} (LFM) radar, <b>the</b> ratio between <b>jamming</b> energy and signal energy is always constant.
