5|$|Beecham {{took the}} {{orchestra}} on a controversial tour of Germany in 1936. Throughout the tour, the orchestra ignored <b>the</b> <b>custom</b> <b>of</b> playing the Nazi anthem before concerts, but Beecham yielded {{to pressure from}} Hitler's government not to play the Italian Symphony by Mendelssohn, taboo to Nazi anti-Semites. There was disquiet {{among some of the}} players that their presence in Germany gave the Nazi regime a propaganda coup.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Alexander adopted some {{elements}} of Persian dress and customs at his court, notably <b>the</b> <b>custom</b> <b>of</b> proskynesis, either a symbolic kissing of the hand, or prostration on the ground, that Persians showed to their social superiors. The Greeks regarded the gesture as the province of deities and believed that Alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it. This cost him the sympathies {{of many of his}} countrymen, and he eventually abandoned it.|$|E

5|$|Jersey milk {{being very}} rich, cream and butter {{have played a}} large part in insular cooking. (See Channel Island milk) However, there is no {{indigenous}} tradition of cheese making, contrary to <b>the</b> <b>custom</b> <b>of</b> mainland Normandy, but some cheese is produced commercially. Jersey fudge, mostly imported and made with milk from overseas Jersey cattle herds, is a popular food product with tourists.|$|E
5|$|On 8 December 1864, {{the bridge}} was lit by {{magnesium}} flares for its ceremonial opening parade, but they were blown out by the wind. <b>The</b> <b>custom</b> <b>of</b> lighting the bridge has continued with more recent events, although later thousands of electric light bulbs were attached to the bridge instead of flares.|$|E

5|$|Richard III was {{followed}} by another adaptation, the comedy, Love Makes a Man, which was constructed by splicing together two plays by John Fletcher: The Elder Brother and <b>The</b> <b>Custom</b> <b>of</b> the Country.

Although Cruze was credited with a dual role, Harry Benham (who played the father of Jekyll's fiancée), said in 1963 that he had played Hyde in some scenes.|$|E

5|$|Washington {{frequently}} accompanied {{his wife}} to church services. Third-hand reports say that he took communion, although he is usually characterized as never or rarely participating in the rite. He would regularly leave services before communion with the other non-communicants (as was <b>the</b> <b>custom</b> <b>of</b> the day). He ceased attending at all on communion Sundays after being admonished by a rector.|$|E
5|$|As time passes, {{with no sign}} of land {{or other}} ships, Parker {{suggests}} that one of them should be killed as food for the others. They draw straws, following <b>the</b> <b>Custom</b> <b>of</b> the Sea and Parker is sacrificed. This gives the others a reprieve, but Augustus soon dies from wounds received when they reclaimed the Grampus, and several more storms batter the already badly damaged ship. Pym and Peters float on the upturned hull and are close to death when they are rescued by the Jane Guy, a ship out of Liverpool.|$|E

5|$|Dealing with sanitation, Espejo {{observed}} that the hospital (Hospital de la Misericordia) of the city, the monasteries and the places of worship were filthy and that this would certainly contribute to future epidemics. He disapproved of <b>the</b> <b>custom</b> <b>of</b> burying the dead inside churches; instead, he suggested burying the dead outside the city limits in a graveyard chosen by the Church and owned by the town council. Finally, he condemned {{the management of the}} hospital by the Bethlehemites. He said their methods were outdated and that they provided poor service. The staff of the hospital reacted badly to this, and Espejo lost the friendship of his mentor, José del Rosario.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{construction}} by Col. Parsons in 1861, the ballroom {{in the upper}} story of Wappocomo's stone addition served as the scene of many events and parties. According to tradition, as many as 100 couples have danced on the ballroom's wooden floor since {{its construction}} in 1861. It was <b>the</b> <b>custom</b> <b>of</b> the Parsons family to allow guests who were visiting the mansion {{for the first time}} to write their names and the date of their visit on the mortar between the addition's stone blocks; many of these signatures are still legible.|$|E
5|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>custom</b> <b>of</b> the times—that {{candidates}} {{not appear}} to seek the office—Tyler stayed home throughout the campaign, and made no speeches. Tyler received only 47 electoral votes, from Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee, in the November 1836 election, trailing both Granger and the Democratic candidate, Richard Mentor Johnson of Kentucky. Harrison was the leading Whig candidate for president, but he lost to Van Buren. The presidential election was settled by the Electoral College, but for {{the only time in}} American history, the vice presidential election was decided by the Senate, which selected Johnson over Granger on the first ballot.|$|E

5|$|In 1931, Howe began {{raising money}} for the {{campaign}} from Democrats like Henry Morgenthau, Sr. and Joseph P. Kennedy as well as recruiting delegates for the 1932 national convention.

Howe suffered from severe asthma attacks throughout the convention, but remained in telephone contact with Rooseveltwho was not present, per <b>the</b> <b>custom</b> <b>of</b> the dayand continued to meet with delegates who were brought to visit him. Roosevelt was nominated by the convention after agreeing to make another rival, John Nance Garner, his vice presidential candidate, and after some of Smith's Tammany Hall supporters, led by William Gibbs McAdoo, began to defect.|$|E
5|$|The Terrace of the Presidents: Robert Gannon, {{president}} of Fordham from 1936 to 1949, initiated <b>the</b> <b>custom</b> <b>of</b> engraving the granite steps {{leading up to}} Keating Hall {{with the names of}} heads of state who visit the university. Among the names engraved are George Washington, who visited the Rose Hill Manor before it was succeeded by St. John's College in 1841; Franklin Delano Roosevelt; Harry S. Truman; Richard Nixon; and the names of various other heads of state from around the world.|$|E
5|$|Anselm stuck {{firmly to}} {{the letter of the}} papal decree, despite Henry's {{attempts}} to persuade him to give way in return for a vague assurance of a future royal compromise. Matters escalated, with Anselm going back into exile and Henry confiscating the revenues of his estates. Anselm threatened excommunication, and in July 1105 the two men finally negotiated a solution. A distinction was drawn between the secular and ecclesiastical powers of the prelates, under which Henry gave up his right to invest his clergy, but retained <b>the</b> <b>custom</b> <b>of</b> requiring them to come and do homage for the temporalities, the landed properties they held in England. Despite this argument, the pair worked closely together, combining to deal with Duke Robert's invasion of 1101, for example, and holding major reforming councils in 1102 and 1108.|$|E
