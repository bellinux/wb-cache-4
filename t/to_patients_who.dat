25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{potential}} physiological mechanisms linking loneliness to poor health outcomes. In 2005, results from the American Framingham Heart Study demonstrated that lonely men had raised levels of Interleukin 6 (IL-6), a blood chemical linked to heart disease. A 2006 study conducted by the Center for Cognitive and Social Neuroscience at the University of Chicago found loneliness can add thirty points to a blood pressure reading for adults over the age of fifty. Another finding, from a survey conducted by John Cacioppo from the University of Chicago, is that doctors report providing better medical care <b>to</b> <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> have a strong network of family and friends than they do <b>to</b> <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> are alone. Cacioppo states that loneliness impairs cognition and willpower, alters DNA transcription in immune cells, and leads over time to high blood pressure. Lonelier {{people are more likely to}} show evidence of viral reactivation than less lonely people. Lonelier people also have stronger inflammatory responses to acute stress compared with less lonely people; inflammation is a well known risk factor for age-related diseases.|$|E

25|$|Conversion {{disorder}} (CD) is {{a diagnostic}} category {{used in some}} psychiatric classification systems.

It is thought that these symptoms arise in response to stressful situations affecting a patient's mental health or an ongoing mental health condition such as depression. Conversion disorder was retained in DSM-5, but given the subtitle functional neurological symptom disorder. The new criteria cover the same range of symptoms, but remove the requirements for a psychological stressor to be present and for feigning to be disproved.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} {{numerous}} claims that electroconvulsive therapy and prefrontal lobotomies and similar psychiatric treatments have sometimes been performed not in the patient's best interests, but rather as punishment for misbehaviour or to otherwise make the patient easier to manage. A classic {{example of this is}} the Lake Alice, New Zealand atrocity which occurred in the early 1970s. Children admitted to the Lake Alice Hospital's open child and adolescent unit were routinely punished with unmodified ECT (that is, ECT without anesthesia).

25|$|The Lunacy Act 1845 was an {{important}} landmark {{in the treatment of}} the mentally ill, as it explicitly changed the status of mentally ill people <b>to</b> <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> required treatment. The Act created the Lunacy Commission, headed by Lord Shaftesbury, to focus on lunacy legislation reform. The Commission was made up of eleven Metropolitan Commissioners who were required to carry out the provisions of the Act; the compulsory construction of asylums in every county, with regular inspections on behalf of the Home Secretary. All asylums were required to have written regulations and to have a resident qualified physician. A national body for asylum superintendents - the Medico-Psychological Association - was established in 1866 under the Presidency of William A. F. Browne, although the body appeared in an earlier form in 1841.|$|E

25|$|Autologous hematopoietic {{stem cell}} {{transplantation}} (HSCT) {{is based on the}} assumption that autoimmune diseases like systemic sclerosis occur when the white blood cells of the immune system attack the body. In this treatment, stem cells from the patient's blood are extracted and stored to preserve them. The patient's white blood cells are destroyed with cyclophosphamide and rabbit antibodies against the white blood cells. Then the stored blood is returned to the patient's bloodstream to reconstitute a healthy blood and immune system which will not attack the body. The results of a phase 3 trial, the Autologous Stem Cell Transplantation International Scleroderma (ASTIS) trial, with 156 patients were published in 2014. HSCT itself has a high treatment mortality, so in the first year, the survival of patients in the treatment group was lower than the placebo group, but at the end of 10 years, the survival in the treatment group was significantly higher. The authors concluded that HSCT could be effective, if limited <b>to</b> <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> were healthy enough to survive HSCT itself. Therefore, HSCT should be given early in the progression of the disease, before it does damage. Patients with heart disease, and patients who smoked cigarettes, were less likely to survive. Another trial, the Stem Cell Transplant vs. Cyclophosphamide (SCOT) trial, is ongoing.|$|E
25|$|In {{a review}} article by Pierce & Buxbaum (2002), they {{concluded}} that the evidence for Hemispheric Activation Approaches, which focuses on moving the limb {{on the side of}} the neglect, has conflicting evidence in the literature. The authors note that a possible limitation in this approach is the requirement for the patients to actively move the neglected limb, which may not be possible for many patients. Constraint-Induced Therapy (CIT), appears to be an effective, long-term treatment for improving neglect in various studies. However, the use of CIT is limited <b>to</b> <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> have active control of wrist and hand extension. Prism Glasses, Hemispatial Glasses, and Eye-Patching have all appear to be effective in improving performance on neglect tests. Caloric Stimulation treatment appears to be effective in improving neglect; however, the effects are generally short-term. The review also suggests that Optokinetic Stimulation is effective in improving position sense, motor skills, body orientation, and perceptual neglect on a short-term basis. As with Caloric Stimulation treatment, long-term studies will be necessary to show its effectiveness. A few Trunk Rotation Therapy studies suggest its effectiveness in improving performance on neglect tests as well as the Functional Independence Measure (FIM). Some less studied treatment possibilities include treatments that target Dorsal Stream of visual processing, Mental Imagery Training, and Neck Vibration Therapy. Trunk rotation therapies aimed at improving postural disorders and balance deficits in patients with unilateral neglect, have demonstrated optimistic results in regaining voluntary trunk control when using specific postural rehabilitative devices. One such device is the Bon Saint Côme apparatus, which uses spatial exploratory tasks in combination with auditory and visual feedback mechanisms to develop trunk control. The Bon Saint Côme device has been shown to be effective with hemiplegic subjects due to the combination of trunk stability exercises, along with the cognitive requirements needed to perform the postural tasks.|$|E

40|$|Background: Identification of {{patients}} with {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) who develop dynamic hyperinflation (DH) during activities in daily life (ADL) is important, because of the association between DH and dyspnea and exercise limitation. Objective: We aimed to answer the question whether measurements of DH during metronome-paced tachypnea (MPT) or cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) can be used <b>to</b> identify <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> develop DH during ADL. Methods: DH was measured by tracking changes in inspiratory capacity during CPET, MPT and ADL. Bland-Altman plots were used to evaluate agreement in DH between methods. With a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the overall accuracy of MPT and CPET <b>to</b> identify <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> hyperinflate during ADL was assessed. Results: There are broad limits of agreement in DH between methods. ROC curve analyses showed good overall accuracy of both CPET and MPT <b>to</b> identify <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> hyperinflate during ADL. For CPET, area under the curve (AUC) = 0. 956 (95 % CI 0. 903 - 1. 009). For MPT, AUC = 0. 840 (95 % CI 0. 699 - 0. 981). Sensitivity and specificity <b>to</b> identify <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> hyperinflate during ADL with CPET were 96 and 83 %, respectively, and with MPT, they were 89 and 77 %, respectively. Conclusion: Both CPET and MPT can serve as screening tools <b>to</b> identify <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> are susceptible <b>to</b> developing DH during ADL. In practice, MPT is the most simple and inexpensive surrogate. However, the sensitivity of MPT is not optimal. When DH does not occur during CPET, it is unlikely to occur during ADL...|$|R
