40|$|Impaired {{control over}} {{drug use is}} a {{defining}} characteristic of addiction in the major diagnostic systems. However there is significant debate {{about the extent of}} this impairment. This qualitative study examines the extent to which leading Australian addiction neuroscientists and clinicians believe that addicted individuals have control over <b>their</b> <b>drug</b> use and are responsible for their behaviour. One hour semi-structured interviews were conducted during 2009 and 2010 with 31 Australian addiction neuroscientists and clinicians (10 females and 21 males; 16 with clinical experience and 15 with no clinical experience). Although many addiction neuroscientists and clinicians described uncontrolled or compulsive drug use as characteristic of addiction, most were ambivalent about whether or not addicted people could be said to have no control of <b>their</b> <b>drug</b> use. Most believed that addicted individuals have fluctuating levels of impaired control over <b>their</b> <b>drug</b> use but they nonetheless believed that addicted persons were responsible for their behaviour, including criminal behaviour engaged in to fund <b>their</b> <b>drug</b> use. Addiction was not seen as exculpating criminal behaviour but as a mitigating factor...|$|R
25|$|The {{thalidomide}} tragedy resurrected Kefauver's bill {{to enhance}} drug regulation that had stalled in Congress, and the Kefauver-Harris Amendment became law on 10 October 1962. Manufacturers henceforth {{had to prove}} to FDA that <b>their</b> <b>drugs</b> were effective as well as safe before they could go on the US market. The FDA received authority to regulate advertising of prescription drugs and to establish good manufacturing practices. The law required that all drugs introduced between 1938 and 1962 had to be effective. An FDA - National Academy of Sciences collaborative study showed that nearly 40 percent of these products were not effective. A similarly comprehensive study of over-the-counter products began ten years later.|$|E
25|$|The Supreme Court {{ruled that}} law {{enforcement}} officers may enter a house without knocking if they have “a reasonable suspicion” that announcing their presence would be dangerous or allow a suspect to destroy evidence (for example, by flushing drugs down the toilet). In addition, rules on civil asset forfeiture allow law enforcement officers to seize anything which they can plausibly claim was the proceeds of a crime. The property-owner need not be convicted of that crime; if officers find drugs in a house, they can take cash {{from the house and}} possibly the house itself. Commentators have said these rules provide an incentive for law enforcement officers to focus on drug-related crimes rather than rape and murder investigations. They also provide an incentive to arrest suspected drug-dealers inside their houses, which can be seized, and to raid stash houses after most of <b>their</b> <b>drugs</b> have been sold, when officers can seize the cash.|$|E
500|$|Alphonse Gangitano, the self-styled [...] "Black Prince of Lygon Street", kills {{a man at}} a party over a small debt and, with Jason's assistance, injures 13 {{innocent}} people. During his trial, Gangitano is {{murdered by}} Jason, although the killing goes unsolved. The Moran brothers buy a pill press and employ Carl Williams to produce <b>their</b> <b>drugs.</b> Carl secretly begins making his own supply and forms an alliance with Moran rival Tony Mokbel (Robert Mammone). When Carl is busted by the police, Jason discovers his double-cross and shoots him in the stomach, before Jason is arrested. Mark Moran takes over the drug business, selling Tony Mokbel out to a corrupt officer from the drug squad. Carl kills Mark {{with the assistance of}} drug dealer Dino Dibra (Daniel Amalm) and L (Ian Bliss), who establish an alibi. Lewis Moran hires Andrew [...] "Benji" [...] Veniamin (Damian Walshe-Howling) to avenge his stepson, believing the killer to be Dibra. Benji kills Dibra then offers his services to Carl and becomes his bodyguard, although Carl is eventually jailed. Carl's wife, Roberta (Kat Stewart), is forced to run the business and she begins an affair with Benji.|$|E

500|$|As the province's fiscal {{situation}} worsened in late 2008, {{the government}} adapted its health policy. In December, Liepert {{announced a new}} seniors drug plan that made drugs free for seniors making less than $21,325 but required those making more to {{pay as much as}} $7,500 for <b>their</b> <b>drugs.</b> In response to protests from seniors, he amended the plan in April 2009 to reduce both the income level at which seniors would have to start paying and the amount which those seniors would have to pay. Liepert said that the plan, $10 million more expensive than the one he had announced in December, would see 60% of seniors pay less than they did under the status quo. The same month, Stelmach's government's budget revealed changes to which medical services it would cover: those de-listed included chiropractic services, at an annual savings of $53 million, and sex change operations, at an annual savings of $700,000. While the Canada Health Act requires the federal government to financially penalize provinces that do not support all [...] "medically necessary" [...] procedures, Liepert maintained that the de-listed services were not [...] "medically necessary" [...] {{from the perspective of the}} Act, and said that he anticipated no trouble from the federal government.|$|E

40|$|Background Among {{a cohort}} of drug-using street-involved youth, we sought to {{identify}} the prevalence of reporting increases and decreases in illicit drug use due to their current housing status and to identify factors associated with reporting these changes. Findings This longitudinal study was based on data collected between June 2008 and May 2012 from a prospective cohort of street-involved youth aged 14 – 26 in Vancouver, Canada. At semi-annual study follow-up visits, youth were asked if <b>their</b> <b>drug</b> use was affected by their housing status. Using generalized estimating equations, we identified factors associated with perceived increases and decreases in drug use attributed to housing status. Among our sample of 536 participants at baseline, 164 (31 %) youth reported increasing <b>their</b> <b>drug</b> use due to their housing situation and 71 (13 %) reported decreasing <b>their</b> <b>drug</b> use. In multivariate analysis, factors that were positively associated with perceived increases in drug use attributed to housing status included the following: being homeless, engaging in sex work and drug dealing. Regular employment was negatively associated with increasing drug use due to housing status. Among those who reported decreasing <b>their</b> <b>drug</b> use, only homelessness was significant in bivariate analysis. Conclusion Perceived changes in drug use due to housing status were relatively common in this setting and were associated with being homeless and, among those who increased <b>their</b> <b>drug</b> use, engaging in risky income generation activities. These findings suggest that structural factors, particularly housing and economic opportunities, may be crucial interventions for reducing or limiting drug use among street-involved youth...|$|R
2500|$|Health {{insurance}} company Blue Cross Blue Shield (BCBS) {{filed a lawsuit}} against Pfizer for reportedly illegally marketing <b>their</b> <b>drugs</b> Bextra, Geodon and Lyrica.

FiercePharma reported that [...] "According to the suit, the drugmaker not only handed out those [...] "misleading" [...] materials on off-label uses, but sent doctors on Caribbean junkets and paid them $2,000 honoraria in return for their listening to lectures about Bextra.

2500|$|Critics have {{disputed the}} claim that the Prescription Drug User Fee Amendment has {{improved}} the speed of drug approvals. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act allows the FDA to augment its budget by charging fees to pharmaceutical firms. [...] Over $800 million was collected from 1993 to 2001 and rising each year. [...] It also has been shown that oftentimes, the FDA expert advisory panels had direct financial interests in the drugs or products being evaluated. [...] Former Editor of The New England Journal of Medicine, Marcia Angell, [...] has stated that [...] "It's time to take the Food and Drug Administration back from the drug companies.... In effect, the user fee act put the FDA on the payroll of the industry it regulates. Last year, the fees came to about $300 million, which the companies recoup many times over by getting <b>their</b> <b>drugs</b> to market faster." ...|$|E
2500|$|After his resignation, {{from his}} post as Commissioner of the Food and Drugs Administration in December 1969, Dr. Herbert L. Ley, Jr. [...] In an {{interview}} to the New York Times, warned {{the public about the}} FDA’s inability to safeguard consumers. People were being misled, he believed “The thing [...] that bugs me is that the people think the FDA is protecting them - it isn’t. What the FDA is doing and what the public thinks it’s doing are as different as night and day,” he said. The agency, in his opinion, did not have the motivation to protect consumers, faced budget shortfalls, and lacked support from the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare. Dr. Ley was critical of Congress, the Administration and the drug industry, he stated that he had [...] "constant, tremendous, sometimes unmerciful pressure" [...] from the drug industry and that the drug company lobbyists, combined with the politicians who worked on behalf of their patrons, could bring “tremendous pressure” to bear on him and his staff, to try preventing FDA restrictions on <b>their</b> <b>drugs.</b> The interview concluded with Ley stating that the entire issue was about money, “pure and simple”. On December 15, 1999, interviewed for the oral history program of the FDA History Office, Dr. Ley shared that from the first controversy in his tenure as FDA Commissioner he had a [...] "gut feeling" [...] that his life expectancy at the FDA was probably limited. He said he had done everything by the book, both in the FDA and the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, and he thinks that what the Administration was really wishing, was that he would stonewall the whole Academy report, because it was goring too many pharmaceutical companies.|$|E
