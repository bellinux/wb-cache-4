[...] He also compared the film's structure to Citizen Kane (which also contained an interrogator and a subject who is telling a story) and the criminal caper The Anderson Tapes.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{were divided}} on the game's control scheme. Donlan wrote that Grow Home is the best rock-climbing game he has ever played, stating that the [...] "initially bewildering" [...] {{controls}} allow the player {{to move through the}} world [...] "with real skill". Davis called it the most entertaining aspect of the game, but also stated that the walking controls were awkward at times. Webber said that the climbing controls caused her wrist strain, and that the walking controls were [...] "cute until <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> overshoot or go skidding off the edge".|$|E

Moa said that [...] "I've chosen to record an acoustic version of the album because I believe in the vulnerable, simplistic side of music and writing. The way you connect the songs <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> hear it, no drums, no effects, no funky bass lines, just your voice and a guitar... it feels like magic." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{designers}} {{attempted to}} recreate the films' characters and events in a [...] "cute" [...] way. Assistant producer Jeff Gullet said that, in the game's recreation of a Return of the Jedi scene where Luke Skywalker [...] "jumps off the plank ... and somersaults onto the skiff", Skywalker [...] "performs an all-out acrobatic routine {{with all sorts of}} jumps from the plank. It's hilarious". LucasArts producer David Perkinson said, [...] "unless you've got the heart of the Emperor, you are going to chuckle at many of [...] <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> see them – you just have to.

Technology, [...] "the mechanism", is the agent of memory, which transforms subjective experience into allegedly objective records (photography). It is also the agent of life and death, one moment dispensing lethal bullets, but also likened to the life-giving qualities of sex. Shooting the gun is [...] "ike <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> put your mouth / on a woman".|$|E

500|$|The lyrics on Ready to Die tend to {{deal with}} violence, drug dealing, women, alcohol and {{marijuana}} use, and other elements of Notorious B.I.G.'s environment. He rapped about these topics in [...] "clear, sparse terms, allowing the lyrics to hit <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> hear them". The album contains a loose concept starting out with an intro that details his birth, his early childhood, his adolescence and his life {{at the point of}} the album's release. Songs on the album range from homicide narratives ("Warning") to braggadocios battle raps ("The What," [...] "Unbelievable"). The final song was [...] "Suicidal Thoughts", a song where The Notorious B.I.G. contemplates and finally commits suicide.|$|E

500|$|After {{the success}} of the single, in an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Allen said, [...] "It took a while, but it’s done really incredible. It exceeded all my expectations anyway. To be honest, I was a little worried when it first came out and it wasn’t doing great. But I think it’s just about working hard and getting people to hear the song, and then everyone started believing in it a little bit more. I remember getting a text from Keith Urban saying 'I’m not gonna lie: The first time I heard that song I wasn’t crazy about it. But after a couple listens, I really, really like it.' And I mean, I think that’s how everybody felt about the song. And I think that’s a testament to a good song. You don’t have to love ‘em <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> hear ‘em.

500|$|The {{end of the}} storyline was criticised by gay advocates after Charlie {{was seen}} having sex with Hugo Austin (Bernard Curry) and Joey left Summer Bay alone. Anderson also {{suggested}} that Hugo may {{have been enough to}} [...] "sway" [...] Charlie towards men. Some sceptics had suggested that Home and Away would not allow Charlie and Joey to remain in a same-sex relationship. Anderson later acknowledged she had feared that the story would see her typecast as [...] "the lesbian cop." [...] Anderson reflected on the storyline during an interview with The Daily Telegraph, saying [...] "The Charlie/Joey (lesbian) storyline was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> got to see Charlie's vulnerable side.

500|$|Lifehouse {{lead singer}} Jason Wade had many inspirations when writing songs for Who We Are. When {{asked about the}} {{background}} of lead single [...] "First Time", Wade said, [...] "It just felt urgent, like a first kiss, a first love. [...] Like <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> realize there's more to that relationship than you thought. I had to dig a little for that one, but I find myself {{at a place where}} I can write stuff that's a little deeper than your average love song in terms of emotion." [...] Wade was inspired to write [...] "The Joke" [...] after he read a newspaper article that detailed the story of a British boy who hung himself as a result of being bullied by his fellow schoolmates. The song [...] "Broken" [...] was written by Wade after he visited a friend in Nashville that needed a kidney transplant.|$|E
500|$|Popke {{noted that}} {{although}} he saw little connection between {{the music and the}} film, Moore [...] "expresses the mood of each scene brilliantly." [...] He found that watching Age 13 with Graveyard Mountain Home as the soundtrack enhanced the film: [...] "Age 13 is not necessarily an enjoyable film to watch... but viewing it with the Chroma Key soundtrack makes an odd experience even odder yet wholly compelling, with a mysterious filmstrip allure that freezes a bygone era." [...] Conversely, Jablonski considered Age 13 as an enhancement to the music. [...] "Listening to the album stand alone for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> may not be much impressed," [...] she said. [...] "The music is solemn and somewhat confusing as the tracks run from one to another without much build and in seemingly senseless patterns... Having previously seen or simultaneously watching Age 13 most definitely would help the listener along." ...|$|E

500|$|Music {{critics were}} divided on [...] "Alive". Chuck Taylor of Billboard stated that: [...] "Remember that 'Oh, my' feeling <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> heard Madonna sing her first ballad, 'Crazy for You'? It's déjà vu with 'Alive'." [...] According to Taylor, Lopez instills a [...] "vulnerable spirit of romanticism" [...] in the track. He wrote that Lopez [...] "does her best" [...] with the song, a [...] "regal ballad". He called [...] "Alive" [...] a [...] "bold new terrain" [...] for Lopez, [...] "an artist who is heralded more for her videogenics than her voice." [...] Taylor wrote that [...] "it's {{nice to have}} top 40's leading staple artist diversify her {{portfolio}} with a musical summer fling that will maintain programmers' and fans' love affair with Lopez". He stated that the radio remix of [...] "Alive" [...] is [...] "made more luxurious" [...] {{with the addition of}} a [...] "cascade of fluttering strings".|$|E
500|$|Most reviewers {{felt that}} though the {{gameplay}} and storyline {{had not changed}} much since the first games, Diamond and Pearl were still engaging. Ryan Davis of GameSpot said, [...] "t's a little surprising how well the formula holds up in Diamond and Pearl, which {{is a testament to}} the strong fundamentals of the series as well as the quality of the execution." [...] The games' Wi-Fi connectivity also earned largely positive reviews. 1UP.com called the addition of wireless connectivity the games' [...] "biggest improvements". GameSpot and GameSpy both listed the addition of online play as one of the positive points of the games and called the system [...] "robust" [...] and [...] "probably the most significant new feature." [...] ComputerAndVideoGames.com said of the Global Trade Center, [...] "Suddenly, Pokémon feels properly alive for the first time since playgrounds were abuzz with monsters in the late '90s – and you'll instantly forgive Game Freak their technical stubbornness <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> switch on your DS and find the level 100 Munchlax you craved is on your cart." ...|$|E

Despite his wounds, Hemingway assisted Italian soldiers to safety, for which he received the Italian Silver Medal of Bravery. Still only 18, Hemingway said of the incident: [...] "When you go to war as a boy you have a great illusion of immortality. Other people get killed; not you... Then when you are badly wounded <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> lose that illusion and you know it can happen to you." [...] He sustained severe shrapnel wounds to both legs, underwent an immediate operation at a distribution center, and spent five days at a field hospital before he was transferred for recuperation to the Red Cross hospital in Milan.

500|$|The album {{received}} {{some of its}} most negative reviews from the British and Irish press. A review for NME was critical of the album's personal lyrics, and claimed that Manson had emasculated himself by opening up. In a one-star review, The Guardian called the album unconvincing, and criticized it for a lack of experimentation; whilst Entertainment.ie writer Lauren Murphy chastised several songs for sounding too experimental and [...] "completely misplaced", summarizing: [...] "If he'd stuck to what he was good at – ear-piercing yelps, liberal dashes of real controversy and big, brawny metal songs with tough beats – he may have [...] a 'comeback' on his hands." [...] Conversely, Mayer Nissim from Digital Spy commended the album for its diversity, but was critical of its length and [...] "ill-advised attempts at stadium anthems." [...] He awarded the album three stars out of five and said: [...] "It's far from awful, but not for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time,</b> <b>you</b> can't help but feel that Manson could do so much better." ...|$|E
500|$|After Lollapalooza, {{the band}} {{embarked}} on a worldwide tour, which was supported by Moby. Tensions continued to increase and {{when asked if the}} band hated touring, Cornell said, [...] "We really enjoy it to a point and then it gets tedious, because it becomes repetitious. You feel like fans have paid their money and they expect you to come out and play them your songs like <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> ever played them. That's the point where we hate touring." [...] The band was criticized for its lack of energy while performing. Cornell said that [...] "after a number of years, you start to feel like you're acting. All those people who criticize us for not jumping around should shut the fuck up, and when they come to our shows they should jump around and entertain us for a while." [...] Thayil had an issue with how the band's audience had changed, stating that [...] "nowadays, you also have the kids and the housewives, the casual fans. With your casual fans, you say, 'Thanks for the money.' And they say, 'Thanks for the song.'" [...] The band's concerts in December 1996 were postponed for a week due to Cornell's throat problems.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Brian Lowry of Variety said: [...] "Despite a pedigree that includes Arrested Development creator Mitch Hurwitz {{and many of}} that program's stars, Sit Down seldom rises above sniggering double entendre." [...] Genevieve Koski of The A.V. Club graded the episode B, saying: [...] "I'm staying optimistic that the characters {{are going to get}} fleshed out in upcoming episodes, because this is obviously going to be a character-based ensemble comedy." [...] Jonah Krakow of IGN was more positive about the episode, noting the [...] "familiar aspects" [...] of [...] Arrested Development, such as the [...] "deft wordplay, biting sarcasm and inappropriate humor". He concluded, saying: [...] "As long as the talented cast can continue to play to their strengths and the scripts can humorously tackle dicey subject matter, this should continue to be a very entertaining show." [...] Kona Gallagher [...] of TV Squad watched the episode twice, and said that it [...] "definitely grows on you." [...] She concluded, saying: [...] "In all, I think <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>you</b> watch Sit Down, Shut Up, it's really easy to blow it off as another animated show that's trying too hard. However, it's actually worth sticking around and watching a couple of episodes." ...|$|E
