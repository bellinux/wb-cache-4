5|$|Multiple {{versions}} of the game were created for the FOCAL and FOCAL-69 languages, but in 1973 David H. Ahl released BASIC Computer Games, a book of games written in the BASIC programming language and the first million-selling computer book, which included his version of The Sumer Game. This expanded version of the game, titled Hamurabi, quickly became the more prominent version due to the popularity of both <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> programming language. Hamurabi influenced many later strategy and simulation games and is also an antecedent to the city-building genre.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> {{subject matter of}} the poem within it share a metaphorical connection in the decay of memory. In this light, critic Peter Schwenger asserts that Agrippa can be understood as organized by two ideas: the death of Gibson's father, and the disappearance or absence of the book itself. In this sense, it instantiates the ephemeral nature of all text.|$|E

5|$|What Happened to Burger's Daughter has two {{essays by}} Gordimer {{and one by}} University of the Witwatersrand law {{professor}} John Dugard. Gordimer's essays document the publication history and fate of Burger's Daughter, {{and respond to the}} Publications Control Board's reasons for banning the book. Dugard's essay examines censorship in South Africa within the country's legal framework. Also included in the book is the Director of Publications's communiqué stating its reasons for banning <b>the</b> <b>book,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> reasons for lifting the ban three months later by the Publications Appeal Board.|$|E
5|$|A made-for-television movie, Farewell to Manzanar, {{directed}} by John Korty, aired on March 11, 1976, on NBC. It {{was based on}} the 1973 memoir of the same name, written by Jeanne Wakatsuki Houston, who was incarcerated at Manzanar as a child, and her husband James D. Houston. <b>The</b> <b>book</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> movie {{tell the story of the}} Wakatsuki family and their experiences behind the barbed wire through young Jeanne's eyes. On October 7, 2011, the Japanese American National Museum (JANM) announced that they had negotiated the rights to the movie, and that they would make it available for purchase on DVD.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Tapps in 1835, his son Sir George William Tapps-Gervis {{inherited}} his father's estate. He hired the young local architect Benjamin Ferrey to develop the coastal area {{on the east side}} of the stream. Bournemouth's first hotel, later to become part of the Royal Bath Hotel, opened in 1838 and is one of the few buildings designed by Ferrey still standing. Bournemouth started to grow at a faster rate as Tapps-Gervis began developing the area similarly to the south coast resorts of Weymouth and Brighton. Despite enormous investment, the town's share of the market remained modest. In 1841 Tapps-Gervis invited the physician and writer Augustus Granville to stay. Granville was the author of The Spas of England, which described health resorts around the country, and as a result of his visit he included a chapter on Bournemouth in the second edition of his book. The publication of <b>the</b> <b>book,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> increase in visitors seeking the medicinal use of seawater and the pine-scented air, helped the town to grow and establish itself as an early tourist destination.|$|E
50|$|This {{series was}} {{originally}} called Jim Reno Westerns Series, <b>and</b> when <b>the</b> first four <b>books</b> were republished in 1992, they renamed <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> series.|$|R
50|$|Additional {{books were}} placed outside on shelves on the Leary’s {{side of the}} {{alleyway}} separating it from Gimbels. Some provision was made to shelter <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> readers in the alley way, but, most of <b>the</b> time, <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>and</b> browsers, suffered <b>the</b> inclemency of the outdoor Philadelphia weather.|$|R
50|$|In the Johnny Weissmuller Tarzan films, Korak was {{replaced}} by an adopted son called Boy (played by Johnny Sheffield). Tarzan and Jane never married in these films (they do in <b>the</b> <b>books),</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> substitution was made to avoid censorship. In <b>the</b> Dell comic <b>books</b> of <b>the</b> fifties, which combine material from <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> films, Tarzan's son was also called Boy. When the Tarzan comics returned to a more faithful portrayal of Burroughs' characters in the early 1960s, Boy disappeared and Tarzan's son was called Korak, {{who went on to}} be featured in his own comic book.|$|R
5|$|In 1987, Studio Ghibli {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} create a film adaptation of Eiko Kadono's novel Kiki's Delivery Service. Miyazaki's work on My Neighbor Totoro prevented him from directing the adaptation; Sunao Katabuchi was chosen as director, and Nobuyuki Isshiki was hired as script writer. Miyazaki's dissatisfaction of Isshiki's first draft led him to make changes to the project, ultimately taking the role of director. Kadono was unhappy with the differences between <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> screenplay. Miyazaki and Suzuki visited Kadono and invited her to the studio; she allowed the project to continue. The film was originally {{intended to be a}} 60-minute special, but expanded into a feature film after Miyazaki completed the storyboards and screenplay. Kiki's Delivery Service premiered on July 29, 1989. It earned ¥2.15 billion at the box office, and was the highest-grossing film in Japan in 1989.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} Fleming's other Bond stories, {{he used the}} names of people he knew, or knew of, {{throughout}} his story, including the book's eponymous villain, who was named after British architect Ernő Goldfinger. Upon learning {{of the use of}} his name, Goldfinger threatened to sue over the use of the name, before the matter was settled out of court. Fleming had based the actual character on American gold tycoon Charles W. Engelhard, Jr. Fleming also used a number of his own experiences within <b>the</b> <b>book,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> round of golf played with Goldfinger was based upon a tournament in 1957 at the Berkshire Golf Club in which Fleming partnered the Open winner Peter Thomson.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> lectures, Lewis {{argues that}} {{significant}} changes {{are required to}} meet the Millennium Development Goals in Africa by their 2015 deadline. Lewis explains the historical context of Africa since the 1980s, citing a succession of disastrous economic policies by international financial institutions that contributed to, rather than reduced, poverty. He connects the structural adjustment loans, with conditions of limited public spending on health and education infrastructure, to the uncontrolled spread of AIDS and subsequent food shortages as the disease infected much of the working-age population. Lewis also addresses such issues as discrimination against women and primary education for children. To help alleviate problems, he ends with potential solutions which mainly require increased funding by G8 countries to levels beyond what they promise.|$|E
40|$|In the United States, sociological legal {{scholars}} have long admonished {{that it is}} necessary to understand the distinction between <b>the</b> law on <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> law in action. Any discussion of dismissal in the United States must be particularly mindful of this distinction. In employment, there is a wide disjunction between the law as it is written and articulated by judges, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> actual practice of labor relations. Further, in the area of dismissal from employment, both <b>the</b> law on <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> law in action are in flux at the present time, both in flux and moving in opposite directions...|$|R

50|$|The {{cartoons}} {{are also}} notable {{for their use}} of children rather than adult voice actors, a technique pioneered by the Peanuts television specials. Both <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> cartoon also follow a technique of never showing adults.|$|R
5|$|Three years later, Jordan Chandler's alleged {{account of}} the {{relationship}} was detailed in a book by journalist Victor M. Gutierrez. The book {{was said to be}} based on a diary the boy had kept at the time and included details of alleged sexual encounters between Jackson and him. In 1995, Jackson filed a civil suit against Gutierrez for slander; the jury found in Jackson's favor, awarding him $2.7 million in damages. However, that suit was unrelated to <b>the</b> <b>book</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> judgement does not serve to refute the allegations contained within. In 1996, Evan Chandler sued Jackson for around $60 million, claiming Jackson had breached an agreement never to discuss the case. In 1999, a court ruled in Jackson's favor and threw out the lawsuit.|$|E

25|$|L. Frank Baum {{revisited}} {{this story}} for the plot of his 1913 musical The Tik-Tok Man of Oz, starring James C. Morton and Fred Woodward.

50|$|On {{the ninth}} day of Navaratri (Mahanavami), {{especially}} Sharad Navaratri, <b>books</b> <b>and</b> musical instruments are ceremoniously placed before {{the image of}} Saraswathi early at dawn and she is worshipped with special prayers. No studies or any performance of arts is carried out, as it is considered that the Goddess herself is blessing <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> instruments. The festival is concluded on the tenth day of Navaratri (Vijaya Dashami) <b>and</b> <b>the</b> goddess is worshipped again before <b>the</b> <b>books</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> musical instruments are removed. It is customary to study on this day, which is called Vidyarambham (literally, Commencement of Knowledge): students are traditionally required to revise {{much of what they}} have learnt up to that day, and also to start the study of something new. Gurus (preceptors) are worshipped on this day as embodiments of Saraswathi.|$|R
