25|$|Clapton {{received}} an acoustic Hoyer guitar, made in Germany, for his thirteenth birthday, but the inexpensive steel-stringed instrument {{was difficult to}} play and he briefly lost interest. Two years later Clapton picked it up again and started playing consistently. Clapton {{was influenced by the}} blues from an early age, and practised long hours to learn the chords of blues music by playing along to the records. He preserved his practice sessions using his portable Grundig reel-to-reel tape recorder, listening to <b>them</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> until he felt he'd got it right.|$|E
2500|$|.....When the Seventh-day Adventists first started, {{a number}} of us felt they were doomed to defeat. I told <b>them</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again {{not to make a}} start. But today I confess that their faith has triumphed over my unbelief. Some years ago Dr. Magan took me over the place which their {{hospital}} plant now covers. It was then a mass of weeds and cockleburs, and there were two or three sorry-looking animals feeding upon it. Dr. Magan remarked to me that someday they would have a great medical institution there.

I got a problem with that, I got a problem with the American media, and I've told <b>them</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> and over again that this man is a document-able fraud, a fake, and yet they allow him to go on CNN, MSNBC, CNBC, and testify as if he actually knows what he is talking about.|$|E

"'Pon my word, sir," [...] {{said the}} stranger,--looking <b>them</b> both <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over,</b> through <b>and</b> through, {{as if to}} settle how much of all this he was to believe,--"I am deeply indebted to you for your gallantry.

2500|$|According to PC Gamer, [...] "Though his {{games are}} {{frequently}} about violent times and places, {{there is never}} any blood or gore shown. He designs and creates his games by playing <b>them,</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over,</b> until they are fun." [...] Meier worked with a team on a dinosaur-themed game starting in early 2000, but announced in an online development diary in 2001 that the game had been shelved. Despite trying various approaches, including turn-based and real-time gameplay, he said he found no {{way to make the}} concept fun enough. In 2005, he said, [...] "We've been nonstop busy making other games over the past several years, so the dinosaur game remains on the shelf. However, I do love the idea of a dinosaur game and would like to revisit it when I have some time." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Pollard 'Dimboola Jim' Phillips was [...] "a fearless umpire who {{was largely}} {{responsible}} for stamping out throwing {{around the turn of}} the [...] century … establishing an international reputation for acumen and honesty." [...] Amongst the bowlers called for throwing by Phillips were Australian Test players Ernie Jones and Tom McKibbin. [...] Jones was first no-balled in a match between South Australia and the visiting English side in 1897/98. [...] Phillips again no-balled him once in the 2nd Test of that series, Jones thus becoming the first bowler to be called for throwing in a Test match. [...] The selectors omitted Jack Saunders from the 1905 team to tour England because it was feared that Phillips would no-ball him for throwing. [...] Wisden blamed English umpires for the problem, claiming that [...] "Australian bowlers never threw in England until we had shown <b>them</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again that [...] could be broken with impunity." [...] Phillips' actions, including the no-balling of the English amateur champion C. B. Fry, led to a meeting of County captains in 1900, which recommended that nine regular bowlers not be used in the following season.|$|E

6000|$|A large {{empty room}} was allotted to them and, {{as they sat}} {{down on the floor and}} munched the bread that they had brought with them, they felt quite {{enthusiastic}} over their work. It was a high honour, indeed, to have been praised by Monsieur Cathelineau, and been taught by one of his generals. They even felt the advantage that the drill had given them, contrasting the quickness with which they had finally formed into line, with their trouble in arranging themselves before Monsieur Cathelineau. The fact, too, that they were next morning to be furnished with pistols was a great gratification to <b>them</b> <b>and,</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again, they said to each other: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{mattresses}} and feather-beds were softer and higher, and the supports (fulcra) of them {{lower in}} proportion, than in older triclinium couches. The cloths <b>and</b> pillows spread <b>over</b> <b>them,</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> beds, were called accubitalia.|$|R

60|$|This {{a little}} amazed him, {{and he wrote}} down the words distinctly, but read <b>them</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> before he signed them, hesitating at them several times, and repeating them: 'My mother's prejudice! and your prejudice!

6000|$|The Welshman's grasp {{instantly}} relaxed; but, as Oswald {{tried to}} rise, a blow fell upon his helmet, and four Welshmen threw themselves upon him.

5000|$|Aguirre-Sacasa grew up liking comic books, recalling in 2003, [...] "My {{mom would}} take us out to the 7-Eleven on River Road during the summer, and we would get Slurpees and buy comics off the {{spinning}} rack.

60|$|In {{the first}} days, while {{the child had}} {{strength}} to hold a pencil, she wrote fond little love-notes to her mother, in which she concealed her illness; and these the mother read and reread through happy eyes wet with thankful tears, and kissed <b>them</b> <b>over</b> <b>and</b> <b>over</b> again, and treasured them as precious things under her pillow.|$|E

5000|$|Cynthia Lord’s life as {{a writer}} began at age four with a song {{collaboration}} with her sister.

5000|$|... "Green, Green Grass of Home" [...] was {{released}} {{as a single}} in the UK, where it went Top 30, and also received US airplay. Presley first heard the song in 1967 while driving his bus back to Memphis after making another movie, and heard Tom Jones' new single [...] "Green Green Grass of Home" [...] {{for the first time}} and loved it.

60|$|I remembered {{having seen}} tricksters writhe and squirm out of ropes {{with which they}} were bound, but though I writhed and squirmed like a good fellow, the knots {{remained}} as hard as ever, and there was no appreciable slack. In the course of my squirming, however, I rolled over upon a heap of clam-shells--the remains, evidently, of some yachting party's clam-bake. This gave me an idea.
