5|$|Even some nonhuman animals show {{a limited}} ability to add, {{particularly}} primates. In a 1995 experiment imitating Wynn's 1992 result (but using eggplants instead of dolls), rhesus macaque and cottontop <b>tamarin</b> monkeys performed similarly to human infants. More dramatically, after being taught {{the meanings of}} the Arabic numerals 0 through 4, one chimpanzee was able to compute the sum of two numerals without further training. More recently, Asian elephants have demonstrated an ability to perform basic arithmetic.|$|E
5|$|The {{preferred}} {{habitat of}} the dodo is unknown, but old descriptions {{suggest that it}} inhabited the woods on the drier coastal areas of south and west Mauritius. This view {{is supported by the}} fact that the Mare aux Songes swamp, where most dodo remains have been excavated, is close to the sea in south-eastern Mauritius. Such a limited distribution across the island could well have contributed to its extinction. A 1601 map from the Gelderland journal shows a small island off the coast of Mauritius where dodos were caught. Julian Hume has suggested this island was l’île aux Benitiers in <b>Tamarin</b> Bay, on the west coast of Mauritius. Subfossil bones have also been found inside caves in highland areas, indicating that it once occurred on mountains. Work at the Mare aux Songes swamp has shown that its habitat was dominated by tambalacoque and Pandanus trees and endemic palms. The near-coastal placement and wetness of the Mare aux Songes led to a high diversity of plant species, whereas the surrounding areas were drier.|$|E

5000|$|Emperor <b>tamarins</b> occur {{mostly in}} Amazonian lowland and lower montane rain forests, {{as well as}} remnant, primary, and {{secondary}} forests. [...] Amazonian lowland holds an abundance of water during high sea level due the flooding by nearby water sources. This contributes to a very humid, tropical climate to occur year-round. The lower montane forests Emperor <b>tamarins</b> are primarily found in are considered tropical and moist {{with an abundance of}} vegetation. During the dry season, flowering peaks and in the wet season, flowering decreases, affecting the diets of the Emperor <b>tamarins.</b> [...] Many Emperor <b>tamarins</b> are found in Amazonian secondary forests, which account for 40% of the forest area. Secondary forests appear to accumulate woody plant species at a relatively rapid rate but the mechanisms involved are complex and no clear pattern emerged. This process helped grow the trees in which Emperor <b>tamarins</b> primarily reside in when found in secondary forests. [...] The average size of the group <b>tamarins</b> live in is two to eight individuals, but it can range from four to eighteen. They reside {{in the form of an}} extended family group, usually with only one breeding female. The groups they live in usually only consist of Emperor <b>tamarins,</b> but occasionally can also include Saddle-back <b>tamarins</b> considering their food scavenging groups often join together. This is due to the fact Emperor <b>tamarins</b> stick to staying higher in the canopy above 10 meters, and Saddle-back <b>tamarins</b> usually stay below 10 meters.|$|R
25|$|The {{forests that}} golden lion <b>tamarins</b> {{need in order}} to survive are cut down for timber and to make room for cattle ranches, farms and urbanization. Sometimes very small areas or 'pockets' of forest are left but these are too small for the <b>tamarins</b> to survive in. In the past, <b>tamarins</b> were {{collected}} for sale to the pet trade or for use in research laboratories. The golden lion <b>tamarins</b> are located in the South American house.|$|R
50|$|Emperor <b>tamarins</b> {{are listed}} by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) {{as a species}} of Least Concern, {{and there are no}} {{conservation}} efforts aimed directly towards this species of primates. Emperor <b>tamarins</b> populations have been in decline due to threats of deforestation and human encroachment. Forest fragmentation has become a huge problem for arboreal primate species in the neotropics: fragmentation causes the <b>tamarins</b> range to be restricted, causing populations to be isolated. Emperor <b>tamarins</b> are located in protected areas in Peru at Manú National Park and Bolivia at Manuripi-Heath Amazonian Wildlife National Reserve. There are no protected areas that overlap with the Brazilian populations of emperor <b>tamarins.</b>|$|R
25|$|Since {{tamarins}} can {{discriminate between}} predatory threats using varying vocalizations, recipients of an AC {{are thought to}} extract various complex signals from this form of communication. Primarily, cotton-tops are able to glean {{the identity of the}} cooperating <b>tamarin</b> through differences in individuals' alarm calls. Further, adults are able to discriminate the gender of callers from their ACs and determine the range of calls within a related tamarin's alarm calling repertoire. Alarm call-based identification is postulated to play a number of functional roles in the cotton-top <b>tamarin.</b> Firstly, an AC recipient is able to identify a cooperating <b>tamarin,</b> and by recognizing which in their group it is, be able to judge the reliability of the AC from past experience. This may arise from a selective pressure for being able to statistically determine the amount of risk present, and how endangered an individual and its group are.|$|E
25|$|The {{cotton-top}} <b>tamarin</b> is diurnal and {{sleeps with}} its social group in trees with foliage cover. The group leaves the sleeping tree together {{an hour after}} dawn and spends the day foraging, resting, travelling, and grooming. The species is thought to rise late and increases the speed of its foraging and travelling before dusk to avoid crepuscular and nocturnal predators. Its main predators include raptors, mustelids, felids, and snakes. The cotton-top <b>tamarin</b> is extremely vigilant, always looking for potential predators. When the group is resting, one individual moves apart and acts as a lookout to alert the group if it sees a threat.|$|E
25|$|The {{cotton-top}} <b>tamarin</b> makes selective, specialized vocalizations in {{the presence}} of food. These include the C-call, produced when a cotton-top approaches and sorts through food, and the D-call, which is associated with food retrieval and is exhibited while eating.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Disseminated encephalitozoonosis was {{diagnosed}} in 2 sibling, juvenile, cotton-top <b>tamarins</b> (Saguinus oedipus) and 3 sibling, neonatal, emperor <b>tamarins</b> (S. imperator) {{by use of}} histologic examination, histochemical analysis, electron microscopy, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis with nucleotide sequencing. All <b>tamarins</b> were captive born at zoos in North America and died with no premonitory signs of disease. The main pathologic findings were myocarditis (4 / 5), hepatitis (3 / 5), interstitial pneumonia (3 / 5), skeletal myositis (3 / 5), meningoencephalitis (2 / 5), adrenalitis (2 / 5), tubulointerstitial nephritis (1 / 5), myelitis (1 / 5), sympathetic ganglioneuritis (1 / 5), and retinitis (1 / 5). Central nervous system lesions were the most prominent findings in cotton-top <b>tamarins.</b> The inflammation was predominantly lymphocytic and suppurative in cotton-top <b>tamarins,</b> whereas emperor <b>tamarins</b> had granulomatous or lymphoplasmacytic lesions. Intralesional periodic acid–Schiff-, gram-, or acid–fast (or all 3) -positive, oval-to-elliptical shaped organisms were found in 1 cotton-top and the 3 emperor <b>tamarins.</b> By electron microscopy, these organisms were consistent with microsporidia of the genus Encephalitozoon. E. cuniculi genotype III was detected by PCR analysis and sequencing in paraffin-embedded brain, lung, and bone marrow specimens from the cotton-top <b>tamarins.</b> Although PCR results were negative {{for one of the}} emperor <b>tamarins,</b> their dam was seropositive for E. cuniculi by ELISA an...|$|R
40|$|We examine {{vigilance}} {{within a}} mixed-species troop of saddleback (Saguinus fuscicollis) and moustached (S. mystax) <b>tamarins</b> over a complete year. Saddleback <b>tamarins</b> were consistently more vigilant than moustached <b>tamarins.</b> This {{may be linked}} to their preference for lower strata. In accordance with previous studies of other primates, vigilant <b>tamarins</b> of both species were significantly further away from their nearest neighbours, and were also at lower heights in the forest than non-vigilant individuals. There was no observed sex difference in {{the amount of time spent}} vigilant. In terms of modes of scanning, the saddleback <b>tamarins</b> looked up significantly more frequently than the moustached <b>tamarins,</b> whereas there was no difference between the species in the frequency of side sweeps. There were no differences between the sexes in the frequencies of either type of vigilant behaviour. The proportion of time spent vigilant was higher than average immediately prior to entering a sleeping site for saddleback <b>tamarins,</b> but not for moustached <b>tamarins.</b> Both species were more vigilant immediately after exiting a sleeping site than at other times of the day. There was significant variation in the amount of time devoted to vigilance over the course of the year. These findings are discussed with respect to the social structure, ecology and main predator threats facing these species...|$|R
50|$|The <b>tamarins</b> are squirrel-sized New World monkeys {{from the}} family Callitrichidae in the genus Saguinus. They {{are closely related to}} the lion <b>tamarins</b> in the genus Leontopithecus.|$|R
25|$|Among {{the typical}} {{cotton-top}} <b>tamarin</b> communicative vocalizations, the combination long call (CLC) and the alarm call (AC) {{are the most}} heavily represented in the literature. CLCs encompass a range of contact calls that are produced by isolated individuals using chirps and whistles. This type of call is also used for seemingly altruistic alarm calls, thus adding to its range of cooperative behaviors. It is issued {{in the presence of}} kin when a threatening llamas predator is seen. Predators of the cotton-top <b>tamarin</b> include snakes, ocelots, tayras, and most notably, hawks. Early observations by Patricia Neyman even showed that cotton-tops produce diverse sets of alarm calls that can discriminate the presence of birds of prey versus ground-based predators.|$|E
25|$|The zoo {{is highly}} {{proactive}} in species preservation and conservation efforts and participates in over 40 Species Survival Plans (SSP) with the Association of Zoos and Aquariums.

50|$|Secondly, in {{an effort}} to save the golden lion <b>tamarins</b> from extinction, some of the golden lion <b>tamarins</b> have been removed from small, {{isolated}} unsafe forests and placed into a larger, protected forest; specifically they were moved to União Biological Reserve and Poço das Antas reserve. This effort to move the golden lion <b>tamarins</b> into União Biological Reserve in Brazil began in 1991. The golden lion <b>tamarins</b> faced the potential of getting new diseases that they had not been previously exposed to. Many were exposed to callitrichid hepatitis, and contracted the disease.|$|R
40|$|Understanding how species use {{the matrix}} of habitat that {{surrounds}} forest fragments {{can contribute to}} conservation strategies in fragmented landscapes. In this dissertation, I evaluate the effects of habitat structure and resource availability on group characteristics, use of space, and predation risk for the endangered golden-headed-lion <b>tamarins</b> in shaded cocoa plantations locally known as cabruca agroforest. In the first chapter I present a list of tree species that provide key foods and sleeping sites used by lion <b>tamarins.</b> Families Myrtaceae and Sapotaceae are {{the most commonly used}} by lion <b>tamarins</b> for both food and sleeping sites. Fifty-five tree species were ranked as extremely valuable for the <b>tamarins.</b> Cabruca management that retains the species listed in this study may improve the long-term survival of lion <b>tamarins.</b> In the second chapter, I compare ecological and demographic data of lion <b>tamarins</b> in cabruca and other vegetation types. In contrast with my prediction that food resources would be scarce in cabruca, the exotic and invasive jackfruit (Artocarpus heterophyllus) was an abundant food resource for <b>tamarins</b> in cabruca while bromeliads were the favorite substrate for animal prey foraging.

25|$|Some researchers, such as Thorington (1976), posit that S. oedipus is {{more closely}} related to the white-footed <b>tamarin</b> (S. leucopus) than to S. geoffroyi.

50|$|The {{first step}} of {{reintroduction}} begins with zoo free ranging programs, where <b>tamarins</b> have access to explore the entire zoo.

When the <b>tamarins</b> are reintroduced in Poço das Antas Biological Reserve, they require a large amount of post-release training and veterinary care. For the first 6-18 months the reintroduced groups are monitored. Additionally, 1-2 <b>tamarins</b> from each group are radio collared to allow careful monitoring, and all reintroduced <b>tamarins</b> are tattooed and dye marked for easy identification.|$|R
25|$|The illegal pet {{trade and}} {{scientific}} research {{have also been}} cited as factors by the IUCN.
