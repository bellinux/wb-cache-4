500|$|For {{the naked}} scenes, Spears cleared the set, leaving only Kahn, Blackburn and Rushing {{with her to}} shoot the sequence. Spears also shot scenes {{in which she had}} to dance through a hallway of {{imaginary}} lasers in front of a green screen, something that Kahn deemed as [...] "incredible to watch". The last few scenes of the video in which Spears murders her boyfriend, concerned Kahn, who thought they would be censored. He explained [...] "the trick was to make it look pop at the same time" [...] and told Henderson [...] "'Would you like to be kissed by Britney Spears?'". According to Kahn, <b>the</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> smile that appears on Henderson's face before Spears pours the poison into his mouth was what managed to get the shot past censors. Although Spears was at first going {{to be involved in the}} editing process with Blackburn, she did not contact Kahn after the media scandal over her wedding in Las Vegas. [...] "Toxic" [...] is Spears's most expensive music video to date, at a cost of $1 million.|$|E
2500|$|Murrow's reports, {{especially}} during the Blitz, began with what became his signature opening, [...] "This is London," [...] delivered with his vocal emphasis on the word this, followed by <b>the</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pause {{before the rest of}} the phrase. His former speech teacher, Ida Lou Anderson, suggested the opening as a more concise alternative to the one he had inherited from his predecessor at CBS Europe, Cesar Saerchinger: [...] "Hello America. This is London calling." [...] Murrow's phrase became synonymous with the newscaster and his network.|$|E
2500|$|Flyer was {{designed}} to be the fastest propeller-driven vessel in the Pacific Northwest, and was very fine-lined, that is, tall and narrow. [...] Captain Scott was so proud of his new ship that he rode on her as she was launched into the Willamette River. This proved to be a mistake. [...] Neither boilers nor engines had been installed in Flyer before launch, and without their weight deep in her hull to act as ballast, she simply flopped over in the water, and Captain Scott had to exit by climbing out a window. After that, another hull was built around her with the hope of making her a little less top–heavy, but this was imperfectly sealed, so water sloshed around in between the hulls {{for the rest of the}} vessel's operational life. Surprisingly, this did not affect the Flyers speed, although she did acquire a permanent list to port, or at least <b>the</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> list. Once finally completed, the company sent Flyer to Puget Sound and brought Bailey Gatzert around to the Columbia River to run with the Telephone.|$|E
50|$|The {{new series}} has more complex romantic subplots, with both Captain Scarlet {{in the present}} and Captain Black in the past dating Destiny Angel, and <b>the</b> <b>hints</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{potential}} relationship between Captain Blue and Lieutenant Green, as well as flirtations between several other characters. Examples include Captain Ochre and an off-Skybase motorcycle gang member called Colt, and Captain Magenta's all round womaniser image. The original series had hinted at a one-time relationship between Scarlet and Destiny Angel, and an ongoing approach between Blue and Symphony Angel.|$|R

50|$|In 1975, the Fédération Internationale de Gymnastique (FIG) {{sporadically}} {{decided to}} organise an original competition, {{reserved for the}} current best gymnasts.

50|$|Early Buddhism did not {{portray the}} Buddha himself instead using an empty throne and the Bodhi tree to {{represent}} the Buddha and thus may have leaned towards aniconism. <b>The</b> first <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> human representation in Buddhist symbolism appear with the Buddha footprint and full representations were influenced by Greco-Buddhist art.|$|R

50|$|Scientists' {{consensus}} is that <b>a</b> layer <b>of</b> liquid water exists beneath Europa's surface, and that heat energy from tidal flexing allows the subsurface ocean to remain liquid. <b>The</b> first <b>hints</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> subsurface ocean came from theoretical considerations <b>of</b> tidal heating (<b>a</b> consequence <b>of</b> Europa's slightly eccentric orbit and orbital resonance with the other Galilean moons).|$|R

2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>hints</b> <b>of</b> having <b>an</b> LGBTQ {{character}} in the series had been teased by the producers for a while. [...] "True love's kiss has been <b>a</b> staple <b>of</b> this show since the beginning," [...] executive producers Adam Horowitz and Edward Kitsis say. [...] "This past Sunday's episode was just another example <b>of</b> how in <b>a</b> fairy tale, as in life, love is love." ...|$|R
5000|$|DI Susan Alembic is {{possibly}} {{one of the}} more talented DIs in her department, and she partners with the arguably less experienced Luke Stone. Alembic is shown in a very professional respect, with very few references to her personal life. In [...] "Happy Families", it is revealed that Alembic is married with a child, while in [...] "Mr. Right", Alembic chastises Stone for his inability to balance his personal and work lives. Although by the book, Alembic frequently solves the cases she encounters. During the second series, Alembic's character shifted slightly externally from the professional business-suited exterior of the first series, to a more business casual attire constituting jeans and T-shirts. Additionally, despite <b>the</b> <b>hints</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> solid marriage and congenial parent-child relationship in the first series, it is hinted during [...] "Wives and Lovers" [...] the possibility of her husband's infidelity.|$|R

6000|$|... "What do {{you mean}} by nonsense?" [...] Hodder asked. He did not make the {{question}} abrupt, and there was even <b>the</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> smile in his eyes, which Mr. Plimpton found the more disquieting.|$|E
60|$|These {{words came}} with a slight petulance, <b>the</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> loved woman's capricious will, which is capricious only because it feels itself to to be a law, {{embarrassing}} sometimes and always difficult to elude.|$|E

50|$|The {{arrival of}} the Great Southern Railway in July 1889 {{initiated}} <b>the</b> first <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> town. <b>The</b> railway company was in search of good reliable watering points along the route from Perth to Albany.

50|$|Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works {{division}} has revealed a conceptual next-generation fighter design that offers <b>the</b> first <b>hints</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ambitious, long-term technology {{strategy for the}} new class of tactical aircraft that will emerge after 2030. The concept was published in a 2012 calendar, which was distributed to journalists. Lockheed Martin has called for greater speed, range, stealth and self-healing structures.|$|R
6000|$|<b>The</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{confidence}} {{or understanding}} between them which the man's tone conveyed irritated the girl, {{but she saw}} that her father did not resent it.

60|$|I recall him {{tilted back}} in his chair in a debonnair manner beside his {{polished}} desk, <b>the</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> smile on his lips; and leaning close to him was a yellow, owl-like person whose eyes, as they turned to me, gave the impression of having stared for years into hard, artificial lights. Mr. Watling rose briskly.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} him very keenly, through narrowed lids {{scanning}} his face and trying to read his intent. But there was obviously no look of sarcasm in his eyes, nor <b>the</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> sneer in the even placidity of his voice. Once more that unaccountable feeling of irritation seemed to overmaster her, {{the same sense of}} wrath and of injustice which had assailed her when she first spoke to him.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} non-universal 'minimal' Z' models, whose additional U(1) {{charge is}} a non-anomalous linear {{combination of the}} weak hypercharge Y, the baryon number B and the partial lepton numbers (L(e), L(mu), L(T)), with no exotic fermions beyond three standard families with right-handed neutrinos. We show that the observed pattern of neutrino masses and mixing can be fully reproduced by a gauge-invariant renormalizable Lagrangian, and flavor-changing neutral currents in the charged lepton sector are suppressed by a GIM mechanism. We then discuss the phenomenology of some benchmark models. The electrophilic B - 3 L(e) model is significantly constrained by electroweak precision tests, but still allows to fit <b>the</b> <b>hint</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> excess observed by CDF in dielectrons but not in dimuons. The muonphilic B - 3 L(mu) model is very mildly constrained by electroweak precision tests, so that even the very early phase of the LHC can explore significant areas of parameter space. We also discuss the hadrophobic L(mu) - L(T) model, which has recently attracted interest in connection with some puzzling features of cosmic ray spectra...|$|R
