5|$|The Baltimore County Planning Commission first {{conceived}} the Baltimore Beltway as a county-level roadway project in 1949; by 1953 <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>was</b> {{taken over by}} the state due to slow progress at the county level. <b>The</b> <b>project</b> <b>was</b> included as part of the Interstate Highway System by 1956, increasing the speed of construction due to federal funds available.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>project</b> <b>was</b> {{criticized as}} an elitist forum for wealthy right-wing Haitians {{to promote their}} own agendas for Haiti's future. Funding was provided, in {{material}} part, by controversial Haitian businessman Rodolphe Boulos {{who was involved in}} a pharmaceutical poisoning controversy in 1996. <b>The</b> <b>project</b> <b>was</b> seen as a platform for giving opponents of the Aristede administration a hearing in Washington.|$|E

5|$|A {{second phase}} {{to convert the}} {{remaining}} section of freeway of Tower Bridge Gateway to a city street began in 2010. The 3rd Street underpass and subsequent interchange was removed and signalized intersections at 5th and 3rd streets were created. <b>The</b> <b>project</b> <b>was</b> completed in November 2011.|$|E
5|$|A {{video game}} {{set in the}} Mad Max {{universe}} was mentioned by franchise creator George Miller in a 2008 interview. Miller joined God of War II director Cory Barlog to develop the game after Barlog left Sony Computer Entertainment. <b>The</b> <b>project</b> <b>was</b> originally intended as a tie-in with a Mad Max animated film which would be released simultaneously. The film's production was suspended to allow adequate production time for the game. After Barlog announced in 2008 that a publisher for the game was being sought, no further information about <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>was</b> forthcoming. In 2010, Barlog was a consultant for Avalanche Studios, leaving in 2012 for Crystal Dynamics. A Fury Road tie-in video game was in development by Interplay Entertainment, but was scrapped when Electronic Arts acquired the franchise's video-game rights for $20 million.|$|E

5|$|After a first {{interruption}} in development, <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>was</b> redefined as a short interactive demo for Windows-based personal computers. New team members, including professional {{artists and}} designers, were recruited for the demo, which would feature ten scenes from Chrono Trigger {{and most of}} its playable characters. In 2004, <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>was</b> publicly closed after Square Enix issued a cease-and-desist letter to Resurrection Games for trademark and copyright infringement. Despite its closure, the project has received critical and popular praise.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>was</b> accepted, Hinoue {{consulted}} Key's former main {{scenario writer}} Jun Maeda on various game scenario writers to employ for Rewrite. However, the one writer Hinoue wanted on <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>was</b> Romeo Tanaka, who {{she had become}} a fan of after she played FlyingShine's 2003 visual novel Cross Channel, written by Tanaka. While he did not initially accept the offer, Tanaka decided to take the project when he was given the time he needed to do the job. When he accepted it, Tanaka was still unaware that Maeda had stepped down as Key's main scenario writer, and he became more interested when he was told that he would write Rewrites overall story.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>was</b> {{stopped in}} 2001, the {{contract}} {{for the construction of}} {{the second phase of the}} building used a fixed-price design and build contract, which meant that the National Assembly had a much tighter control of costs than they had in the first phase.|$|E
50|$|Hosting for <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>is</b> {{provided}} {{primarily by}} Columbia University, and Western Washington University. Mirrors for <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>are</b> spread around <b>the</b> world and provided by volunteers {{and supporters of}} <b>the</b> <b>project.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>project</b> <b>is</b> {{currently}} {{under construction in}} the Seyrantepe area of Istanbul on the European side. NurolLife is being built on a 9.500m2 plot and will <b>be</b> a <b>project</b> consisting of 502 residences, 50 offices and 2 floors of retail units. <b>The</b> <b>project</b> <b>is</b> designed by <b>the</b> architect Hakan Kıran. <b>The</b> <b>project</b> <b>is</b> due for completion in April 2017.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Immunity <b>Project</b> <b>is</b> a {{scientific}} research nonprofit corporation working {{to develop a}} synthetic HIV/AIDS vaccine. <b>The</b> <b>project</b> <b>is</b> a partnership between biotech firm Flow Pharma and digital agency SparkArt. The nonprofit portion of <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>is</b> fiscally sponsored by the HIV/AIDS charity Until There's a Cure. The vaccine is being developed by Flow Pharma. <b>The</b> <b>project</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> second nonprofit startup organization supported by the venture capital investment firm, Y Combinator. Financial support is also being raised through crowdfunding using Crowdhoster.|$|R
5|$|Another {{opponent}} to <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>was</b> the Action Committee Against a Hasty Construction of the Triangle Link, {{who wanted}} to delay the decision until after the 1991 municipal elections {{to ensure that the}} municipal councils had backing in the public. Gisle Tjong was another opponent, who stated that the risk in <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>was</b> large and that it was uncertain how long the tolls would last: they could just as well last 60 as 15 years. Instead, he wanted to use advanced tolls and fuel fees, place the income in the bank and then pay the whole fixed link with the accumulated funds. Most of the opposition against <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>was</b> from Stord, while in Bømlo there was overwhelming support. However, in southern Bømlo there were concerns that they would lose their ferry, as they would have a much longer rout to Haugesund via the Triangle Link. Some also stated that it was necessary to keep a ferry for people with fear of tunnels.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the company}} was {{shuttered}} after producing Halo Wars, Ensemble Studios {{had been working on}} a Halo-themed massively multiplayer online game, often referred to as Titan Project, or just Titan. <b>The</b> <b>project</b> <b>was</b> cancelled internally in 2007–2008, without a formal announcement from Microsoft.|$|E
5|$|Before <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>was</b> discontinued, several {{newcomers}} {{were planned}} for addition, including Knuckles the Echidna from Sonic the Hedgehog, Lyn from Fire Emblem, and Isaac from Golden Sun.

50|$|<b>The</b> Antelope Valley <b>Project</b> <b>is</b> a flood control, {{economic}} development, {{transportation and}} community revitalization project in Lincoln, Nebraska. Centered on the flood control channel provided for Lincoln's Antelope Creek, <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>is</b> planned {{to run from}} just beyond J Street in the South to Salt Creek to the North, with the creek fully contained within the channel. The total cost of <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>is</b> $238,000,000. <b>The</b> <b>project</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> largest public works <b>project</b> in <b>the</b> history of the city.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>project</b> <b>is</b> {{located in}} Makkah city at a {{location}} on Aziziah street next to the Holy Mosque and the Jamarat (stoning area.) <b>The</b> <b>project</b> area <b>is</b> 64,621 square meters containing seven towers; each tower consisting of a 14 storey building.

30|$|Subsequently, (developmental phase) <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>is</b> {{developed}} and <b>the</b> processing {{and the development}} of the gathered information are carried out. Through this step, the first version of <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>is</b> achieved.|$|R
5|$|Development of {{the film}} began in 1993 before the novel was published. Mike Nichols {{purchased}} the film rights, and <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>was</b> picked up by Savoy Pictures. After Nichols stepped down, the film adaptation became mired in development hell; during the troubled pre-production, Ben Stiller and John Dahl turned down opportunities to direct the film. After Savoy closed in November 1995, <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>was</b> sold to Paramount Pictures, and financed by Mutual Film Company, which provided a budget of $17 million. John Boorman was hired to direct, but scheduling conflicts led to his replacement by Raimi. Principal photography began in January 1998 and concluded in March after 55 days; filming took place in Wisconsin and Minnesota. The score was produced and composed by Danny Elfman.|$|E
5|$|Development of <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>was</b> {{closely tied}} to the other two games, and Sneak Kings {{development}} was directly led by Burger King. The game started as a tile-based puzzle game, but quickly became a Spy vs Spy-style caper until Burger King made design choices that removed conventional hazards and competition elements in favor of a stealth game with no human opponents. Sneak King did not win critical acclaim and its reviews often reflected its unusual design elements, but <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>was</b> a financial success and resulted in millions of units being sold. Collectively, the games ranked amongst the top 10 best selling games of 2006. Burger King's Russell Klein would attribute the three game project as being {{the driving force behind the}} company's 40% quarterly sales increase.|$|E
5|$|Even though <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>was</b> {{initially}} {{built for}} hydroelectric power generation {{to meet the}} mining requirements, it has over the years evolved into a multipurpose reservoir with benefits of power generation, drinking water and fisheries.|$|E

50|$|Once <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>is</b> completed, {{vehicles}} carrying {{three or}} more passengers will {{still be able to}} use the former HOV lanes for free. <b>The</b> <b>project</b> <b>is</b> expected to be completed in 2019.|$|R
5|$|Exit6 on the Adirondack Northway was {{originally}} a diamond interchange. Construction {{to convert the}} junction into a single-point urban interchange began in mid-2008 and was completed on September 12, 2010. The total cost of <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>was</b> $41.9million.|$|E
5|$|For a {{long period}} of time <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>was</b> {{entitled}} Trolley Blues; Cristian Nemescu gave up this title, worrying that there might be a large discrepancy between the equivocal name and the actual, very direct content of the movie.|$|E
5|$|However, due to soil {{conditions}} and utility relocation issues, <b>the</b> <b>project</b> <b>was</b> delayed by nearly two years. The C$99million extension opened on 17 September 2014.|$|E
