5|$|The Christians {{responded to}} these {{actions of the}} central {{government}} with a fresh wave of fury against the Jews so that in late May violence was in the air. The Jews described many cases in which they were assaulted or beaten by the Greeks, and the sons of the British and the Greek consuls were among those who beat up a number of Jews. When the Jews complained to the governor, he ordered <b>the</b> <b>complainants</b> subjected to four to five hundred blows of the bastinado. The qadi disassociated himself from the actions of the governor, who declared that he had acted upon the demands of the consuls. On top of that, the governor ordered five other Jews arrested.|$|E
25|$|The {{loans from}} Chiang {{were to be}} repaid with the {{proceeds}} {{from the sale of}} the flat. Following this, Mislia asked for two more loans from Chiang, which Shankar helped to arrange. In total, she signed three agreements to borrow a sum of $88,500, consisting of $45,000, $30,000 and $13,500 on three separate occasions. However, Mislia claimed she only received $40,000, consisting of $25,000, $10,000 and $5,000 on each of the occasions. Four years later, <b>the</b> <b>complainants</b> lodged a complaint against Shankar with the Law Society of Singapore. Following an investigation, Shankar was tried by the Disciplinary Committee of the Law Society and convicted of three counts of grossly improper conduct contrary to section 83(2)(b) of the Legal Profession Act. The charges were based on allegations that Shankar had acted for both <b>the</b> <b>complainants</b> and Chiang without advising <b>the</b> <b>complainants</b> of the consequences of this conflict of interest, that he had not taken full instructions from <b>the</b> <b>complainants,</b> that he had asked <b>the</b> <b>complainants</b> to sign documents without properly explaining their effect, and that he had not ascertained whether the sums of money that Chiang paid to Mislia were in line with the loan agreements.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>complainants,</b> Abdul Malik bin Sukor, an undischarged bankrupt, and his wife, Mislia binte Yusof, {{wished to}} sell their Housing and Development Board flat in Woodlands. They sought {{the help of a}} real estate agent named Rudolph Khoo, who {{informed}} them that Malik would have to be discharged from his bankruptcy before they could sell their flat. Khoo offered to help <b>the</b> <b>complainants</b> obtain a loan of S$25,000, to be repaid upon the sale of the flat. To facilitate these procedures, Khoo introduced a lawyer, Alan Shankar s/o (son of) Anant Kulkarni, to <b>the</b> <b>complainants,</b> who was to assist them in applying for a discharge from bankruptcy on Malik's behalf, acting for them in the sale of their flat, and documenting several loans that they had procured from one Chiang Bin Kwang.|$|E

5000|$|The appellant, John Sansregret and <b>the</b> <b>complainant</b> lived together. Their {{relationship}} {{had been one}} of contention and discord with violence {{on the part of the}} appellant: [...] "slappings" [...] or [...] "roughing up" [...] in his description, [...] "blows" [...] in hers. On September 23, 1982, <b>the</b> <b>complainant</b> decided to end their relationship. A few days later the appellant became furious and attacked <b>the</b> <b>complainant</b> with a file-like object. <b>The</b> <b>complainant</b> managed to calm him down by holding out hope of some sort of reconciliation and engaging in intercourse with <b>the</b> appellant. <b>The</b> <b>complainant</b> reported <b>the</b> incident to the police, but no charges were laid. On October 15, 1982, the appellant again broke into <b>the</b> <b>complainant's</b> house. <b>The</b> appellant picked up a butcher knife and entered <b>the</b> <b>complainant's</b> bedroom. <b>The</b> <b>complainant,</b> fearful for her life, again tried to calm down the appellant by pretending that there was some hope of reconciliation. They engaged in intercourse shortly later, but <b>the</b> <b>complainant</b> stated that she engaged in intercourse only to prevent further violence by the appellant. She later filed charges against the appellant for rape.|$|R

25|$|The band's {{dangerous}} reputation culminated at a gig at the RPM club in Toronto in November 1987, when {{after being}} heckled throughout the gig {{by a group}} in the audience, Jim Reid thrust his microphone stand towards them, hitting one {{on the head and}} slashing another on the arm. Jim was arrested and spent a night in jail, before being bailed to return the following February. He was subsequently given an absolute discharge after agreeing to give around £500 to a Salvation Army charity and apologise to <b>the</b> <b>complainants.</b>|$|E
25|$|During the Disciplinary Committee hearing, Mislia had {{testified that}} Chiang had issued her cheques {{for the first}} two loans, but that they had gone to Chiang's bank where he had cashed the cheques and then given her only part of the face value of the cheques. To counter this evidence, Shankar had called two bank {{employees}} as witnesses. He claimed that the Disciplinary Committee had questioned the bank witnesses more aggressively than <b>the</b> <b>complainants</b> or Shankar himself, and had essentially cross-examined the witnesses to induce them to make certain factual concessions which weakened Shankar's case.|$|E
50|$|The ASA {{needs the}} full name and address of <b>the</b> <b>complainant</b> {{in order to ensure}} that the {{complaint}} is legitimate. These details are never disclosed without <b>the</b> <b>complainant's</b> permission, in accordance with the Data Protection Act 1998. The only cases where the ASA might ask <b>the</b> <b>complainant</b> for their permission to be named relate to complaints that a consumer has not yet received goods or wishes to be removed from a marketer's database.

25|$|Notably, while every {{witness to}} the Commission gave {{evidence}} of frequent corporal punishment, applied contrary to the regulations and therefore criminally, no Church witness came forward to certify a single such case. Difficulties arose where complainants or the accused were involved in parallel criminal or civil cases, such as the vaccine trials performed on inmate children. With such divergent views the CICA's task has been difficult and contentious, but it has agreed with the evidence given by <b>the</b> <b>complainants.</b> Given Mr. Ahern's general apology in 1999, {{it would be hard}} to conclude otherwise.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the first}} {{measures}} of the Long Parliament was to reform the clergy; with this view, a committee was appointed to receive complaints against them. Among <b>the</b> <b>complainants</b> were the inhabitants of Kidderminster. The vicar George Dance agreed that he would give £60 a year, out of his income of £200, to a preacher who should be chosen by certain trustees. Baxter was invited to deliver a sermon before the people, and was unanimously elected as the minister of St Mary and All Saints' Church, Kidderminster. This happened in April 1641, when he was twenty-six.|$|E
25|$|In January 2013, a {{joint report}} by the NSPCC and Metropolitan Police, Giving Victims a Voice, stated that 450 people had made {{complaints}} against Savile, with the period of alleged abuse stretching from 1955 to 2009 and the ages of <b>the</b> <b>complainants</b> {{at the time of}} the assaults ranging from 8 to 47. The suspected victims included 28 children aged under 10, including 10 boys aged as young as 8. A further 63 were girls aged between 13 and 16 and nearly three-quarters of his alleged victims were under 18. Some 214 criminal offences were recorded, with 34 rapes having been reported across 28 police forces.|$|E

25|$|School of the Art Institute of Chicago student David Nelson created Mirth & Girth, a {{painting}} that depicted Washington wearing women's lingerie and holding a pencil, which was briefly displayed in a hallway at the school on May 11, 1988. City aldermen {{and members of the}} Chicago Police Department soon seized the painting then later returned it with a five-inch gash on the canvas. Nelson, assisted by the ACLU, subsequently filed a federal lawsuit against the city, claiming that the painting's confiscation and subsequent damaging violated his First Amendment rights. <b>The</b> <b>complainants</b> eventually split a US$95,000 (1994, US$138,000 in 2008) settlement from the city.|$|E
25|$|Several of the {{deported}} citizens brought civil {{actions against}} Wheeler, Douglas and the others. But in State v. Wootton, Crim. No. 2685 (Cochise County, Ariz. September 13, 1919), a jury refused {{to find in}} favor of <b>the</b> <b>complainants</b> and give them relief. Defendant Wootton argued that the IWW members were such a threat to public safety that necessity demanded their removal. The jury agreed, making {{this one of the}} rare times in American law in which the necessity defense was successfully used. After this failure at law, nearly all the remaining civil suits were dropped (although a handful were settled for small sums of money).|$|E
25|$|Having {{held that}} the test of {{reasonable}} suspicion of bias was the applicable test in Singapore, Judicial Commissioner Menon proceeded to apply it to the factual matrix of Shankar. After examining the facts and evidence, particularly the transcript of the Disciplinary Committee's questioning of the bank employees involved in the loan transaction, he was satisfied that there was indeed the presence of apparent bias {{on the part of}} Committee. The Committee had treated <b>the</b> <b>complainants</b> and the witnesses for the bank that had handled the money unequally. Furthermore, in questioning the witnesses about procedures and evidence, the Committee seemed to direct their line of inquisition towards attempting to coerce a response desirable to the Disciplinary Committee.|$|E

500|$|Also in 2005, a local Knights of Columbus {{council in}} Canada was fined $2,000 by the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal. The council's Hall Manager signed a {{contract}} {{for the use of}} their facilities with Tracey Smith and Deborah Chymyshyn, but canceled it and returned their money after they became aware that it was for the lesbian couple's wedding reception. [...] The tribunal found that the local council did not have to rent the hall if in so doing they would violate their religious beliefs. But they said the Council [...] "could have taken additional steps that would have recognized the inherent dignity of <b>the</b> <b>complainants</b> and their right to be free from discrimination". Instead of simply canceling the appointment, the court said, the council could have directed <b>the</b> <b>complainants</b> to other halls and assisted them in finding another place to hold their event.|$|E
500|$|The Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women has {{considered}} eleven complaints against seven countries since the Optional Protocol came into force, on {{subjects such as}} domestic violence, division of property, forced sterilization and parental leave.

500|$|Although some {{perceive}} the settlement as {{an admission of}} guilt, the settlement agreement specifically stated that Jackson admitted no wrongdoing and no liability and legally, a settlement cannot be used as evidence of guilt in future civil and criminal cases. The settlement payment was [...] "for alleged personal injuries arising out of claims of negligence and not for claims of intentional or wrong acts of sexual molestation." [...] In the settlement, both parties agreed they would not speak about the case details in public {{but it did not}} prevent the Chandlers from testifying in a criminal trial or sharing information with authorities in a criminal investigation. The settlement document adamantly states there is no admission of wrongdoing on Jackson's part and no admission of molestation or immodesty and that under no circumstances shall any payment be withheld from <b>the</b> <b>complainants,</b> even if they were to testify against Jackson.|$|E

In the end, and notwithstanding that impression of <b>the</b> <b>complainant,</b> bearing in mind the forensic difficulties of the defence occasioned by the very long delay, some valid criticism of <b>the</b> <b>complainant's</b> credibility, <b>the</b> lack of corroborative evidence and the sworn denial of the respondent, I find I am not 'satisfied that the complaint has been established', to quote the words of the principal term of reference." ...|$|R
