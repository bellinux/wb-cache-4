40|$|The {{strategies}} for developing rotavirus (RV) vaccines {{have always been}} controversial. At present, both <b>the</b> monovalent <b>RV</b> vaccine and <b>the</b> multivalent <b>RV</b> vaccine have displayed excellent safety and efficacy against RV infection and shown cross-reactive immunity, which laid the question whether <b>the</b> multivalent <b>RV</b> vaccine could be replaced by <b>the</b> monovalent <b>RV</b> vaccine. In this study, we focused on comparing the immunogenicity (serum neutralization activity and protection against homotypic and heterotypic RVs' challenge) of individual standard RV strains (monovalent RV immunogens) and different combinations of them (multivalent RV immunogens). In result, RV immunogens showed general immunogenicity and heterotypic reaction but <b>the</b> multivalent <b>RV</b> immunogens exhibited greater serum neutralization activity and stronger heterotypic reaction than <b>the</b> monovalent <b>RV</b> immunogens (P< 0. 05). As to the protection, <b>the</b> multivalent <b>RV</b> immunogens also revealed more rapid and stronger protection against homotypic and heterotypic RVs' challenge than <b>the</b> monovalent <b>RV</b> immunogens. <b>The</b> results demonstrated that both the monovalent and multivalent RV immunogens exhibited high immunogenicity, but <b>the</b> monovalent <b>RV</b> immunogens could not provide enough neutralization antibodies to protect MA 104 cells against the infection with heterotypic RV strains and timely protection against homotypic and heterotypic <b>RVs,</b> so <b>the</b> multivalent <b>RV</b> vaccine could not be replaced by <b>the</b> monovalent <b>RV</b> vaccine...|$|R

50|$|At {{least some}} anti-ballistic {{missiles}} (ABMs) use shrapnel-like warhead {{instead of the}} more common blast/fragmentation (blast/frag) type. As with a blast/frag warhead, {{the use of this}} type of warhead does not require a direct body-on-body impact, so greatly reducing tracking and steering accuracy requirements. At a predetermined distance from the incoming re-entry vehicle (<b>RV)</b> <b>the</b> warhead releases, {{in the case of the}} ABM warhead by an explosive expulsion charge, an array of mainly rod-like sub-projectiles into <b>the</b> <b>RV's</b> flight path. Unlike a blast/frag warhead, the expulsion charge is only needed to release the sub-projectiles from the main warhead, not to accelerate them to high velocity. The velocity required to penetrate <b>the</b> <b>RV's</b> casing comes from the high terminal velocity of the warhead, similar to the shrapnel shell's principle. The reason for the use of this type of warhead and not a blast/frag is that the fragments produced by a blast/frag warhead cannot guarantee penetration of <b>the</b> <b>RV's</b> casing. By using rod like sub-projectiles, a much greater thickness of material can be penetrated, greatly increasing the potential for disruption of <b>the</b> incoming <b>RV.</b>|$|R
40|$|In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the actin {{cytoskeleton}} is depolarized by NaCl stress. In this study, {{the response}} was maximal after 30 min, and then actin patches repolarized. Rvs 161 p was required for actin repolarization because <b>the</b> <b>rvs</b> 161 Delta mutant did not repolarize actin patches after growth in a salt medium. Mutations suppressing <b>the</b> <b>rvs</b> 161 Delta- related salt sensitivity all occurred in genes required for sphingolipid biosynthesis: FEN 1, SUR 4, SUR 2, SUR 1, and IPT 1. These suppressors also suppressed act 1 - 1 -related salt sensitivity and the defect in actin repolarization of <b>the</b> <b>rvs</b> 161 Delta mutant, providing a link between sphingolipids and actin polarization. Indeed, deletion of the suppressor genes suppressed <b>the</b> <b>rvs</b> 161 Delta defect in actin repolarization in two ways: either actin was not depolarized at the wild-type level {{in a set of}} suppressor mutants, or actin was repolarized in <b>the</b> absence of <b>Rvs</b> 161 p in the other suppressor mutants. Rvs 161 p was localized as cortical patches that concentrated at polarization sites, i. e., bud emergence and septa, and was found to be associated with lipid rafts. An important link between sphingolipids and actin polarization is that Rvs 161 p was required for actin repolarization and was found to be located in lipid rafts...|$|R

25|$|As designed, <b>the</b> <b>R.V</b> {{was a large}} three-bay biplane with unstaggered {{wings of}} unequal span and a fully {{enclosed}} cabin. Three 180-kW (240-hp) Maybach HS engines were mounted internally in the fuselage, and transmitted their power via driveshafts to two propellers mounted tractor-fashion on the interplane struts nearest the fuselage. The main undercarriage consisted of divided units, each of which carried dual wheels, and the tail {{was supported by a}} pair of tailwheels. The fuselage was forked into an upper and lower section, which allowed a clear field of fire {{to the rear of the}} aircraft. The Maybach engines had been a never-ending source of trouble on the R.II, R.III, and R.IV, and by June 1916, Siemens-Schuckert had obtained permission from the Idflieg to substitute Benz Bz.IV engines on the R.III The firm made the same change on <b>the</b> <b>R.V,</b> which was almost complete by then. The substitution required an almost complete rebuild of the aircraft, and included adding an extra bay to the wings, increasing their span.

40|$|The Candida albicans plasma {{membrane}} plays critical roles in growth and virulence {{and as a}} target for antifungal drugs. Three C. albicans genes that encode Bin-Amphiphysin-Rvs homology domain proteins were mutated to define their roles in {{plasma membrane}} function. The deletion of RVS 161 and RVS 167, but not RVS 162, caused strong defects. <b>The</b> <b>rvs</b> 161 mutant was more defective in endocytosis and morphogenesis than rvs 167, but both were strongly defective in polarizing actin patches. Other plasma membrane constituents were still properly localized, including a filipin-stained domain at the hyphal tips. An analysis of growth under different in vitro conditions showed that <b>the</b> <b>rvs</b> 161 and rvs 167 mutants grew less invasively in agar and also suggested that they have defects in cell wall synthesis and Rim 101 pathway signaling. These mutants were also more resistant to the antimicrobial peptide histatin 5 but showed essentially normal responses to the drugs caspofungin and amphotericin. Surprisingly, <b>the</b> <b>rvs</b> 161 mutant was more sensitive to fluconazole, whereas <b>the</b> <b>rvs</b> 167 mutant was more resistant, indicating that these mutations cause overlapping but distinct effects on cells. <b>The</b> <b>rvs</b> 161 and rvs 167 mutants both showed greatly reduced virulence in mice.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an algorithm for finding faces within an image. The {{basis of the}} algorithm is to run an observation window at all possible positions, scales and orientation within the image. A non-linear support vector machine is used {{to determine whether or}} not a face is contained within the observation window. The non-linear support vector machine operates by comparing the input patch to a set of support vectors (which can be thought of as face and anti-face templates). Each support vector is scored by some nonlinear function against the observation window and if the resulting sum is over some threshold a face is indicated. Because of the huge search space that is considered, it is imperative to investigate ways to speed up the support vector machine. Within this paper we suggest a method of speeding up the non-linear support vector machine. A set of reduced set vectors (RV’s) are calculated from the support vectors. By considering <b>the</b> <b>RV’s</b> sequentially, and if at any point a face is deemed too unlikely to cease the sequential evaluation, obviating the need to evaluate <b>the</b> remaining <b>RV’s.</b> <b>The</b> idea being that we only need to apply a subset of <b>the</b> <b>RV’s</b> to eliminate things that are obviously not a face (thus reducing the computation).
