5|$|Age, {{cognitive}} growth, {{and continued}} social experience advance {{the development and}} complexity of the internal working model. Attachment-related behaviours lose some characteristics typical of the infant-toddler period and take on age-related tendencies. <b>The</b> <b>preschool</b> period involves the use of negotiation and bargaining. For example, four-year-olds are not distressed by separation if they and their caregiver have already negotiated a shared plan for the separation and reunion.|$|E

5|$|Throughout the 1970s, the CTW's main non-television efforts {{changed from}} {{promotion}} {{to the development}} of educational materials for preschool settings. Early efforts included mobile viewing units that broadcast the show in the inner cities, in Appalachia, in Native American communities, and in migrant worker camps. During the early 1980s, the CTW created <b>the</b> <b>Preschool</b> Education Program (PEP), whose goal was to assist preschools, by combining television viewing, books, hands-on activities, and other media, in using the series as an educational resource. The Workshop also provided materials to non-English speaking children and adults. Starting during 2006, the Workshop expanded its programs by creating a series of PBS specials and DVDs largely concerning how military deployment affects the families of soldiers. Other efforts by the Workshop concerned families of prisoners, health and wellness, and safety.|$|E

40|$|With {{this study}} we intend to {{investigate}} and analyse three different preschool’s holdings of toys and discuss the result {{in relation to the}} creation of subject. The investigation in this study consists of an inventory of the holdings of toys at three different preschools. We have used an already existing system for classification which is composed by Nilsson and Nelson (2002). The results give a detailed survey of collected material in the form of tables in which we indicate the comparisons which are relevant to our purpose. In the analysis we have compared <b>the</b> <b>preschool’s</b> holdings of toys and, among other findings, concluded that the class of Household appliance/food is dominating at all <b>the</b> <b>preschools</b> we have visited. Furthermore we have found that <b>the</b> different <b>preschools</b> create a limited conception of the world through their toys. In the study we can confirm that toys give children a perception of what the world looks like and, in that way, contribute to the children’s subject creation. The different toys at <b>the</b> <b>preschools</b> convey a message which not always is in line with the society in general and its views on what values should be embraced by its citizens...|$|R

40|$|The {{study which}} has been made is a {{qualitative}} observational study where play forms and participation of adults were observed in two <b>preschools.</b> <b>The</b> word play is defined in the study with an “as-if” –nature based on Knutsdotters definition which differs play and activities from each other. The observed play form has been analyzed according {{to the concept of}} imitation and imagination play. To get a complete base of the study a few children on some occasions drew what they played or would like to play. Through photographs of these drawings and how the children described and explained what they drew a connection could be made with the children’s play forms. The children take in what adults and other children do and use it in their play forms, which this study clearly shows. Through the social cultural perspective that has been used in this study we can see that learning often occurs through interaction with communication. That children who interact with adults through communication learns how the surrounding world functions, how thinking patterns and actions works. It would appear, however, to be a series of complex problems around the adults’ participation in play. In one of <b>the</b> <b>preschools</b> <b>the</b> adults’ were playing with the children but in <b>the</b> second <b>preschool</b> <b>the</b> adults ‘were too busy with activities so the children would play on their own without adult interruption between them. Through this study it has also been revealed that there are different kinds of distractions that interferes with children’s play and that there generally is a lack of respect for children’s play, an example of this is the continued interference from <b>the</b> <b>preschools</b> staff. Examples of interferences that interrupt children’s play at <b>the</b> <b>preschools</b> are diaper changes, gatherings, lunch, snack breaks and other daily activities and routines...|$|R

40|$|Scheduled {{time for}} {{reflective}} work is common at many Swedish preschools. Reflection {{is a complex}} concept {{that is being used}} with many different purposes in <b>preschools.</b> <b>The</b> reflective work in Swedish preschools today {{has its roots in the}} theories from Vygotskij about how children learn by watching and cooperating with others. Also, many Swedish preschools have taken inspiration from <b>the</b> <b>preschools</b> in Reggio Emilia in Italy, who see the reflective work as something necessary in their work around children’s learning processes. “The learning group” is a way of seeing children and adults as members of groups who capture knowledge by social interaction, taken from <b>the</b> <b>preschools</b> in Reggio Emilia. In 1998, Swedish preschools got their first curriculum, which also took inspiration from Vygotskij and his visions of children’s learning. The aim of this study is to find out how reflective work can be done at some Swedish preschools, and also to investigate a group of teacher’s thoughts on reflective work. The issues in my study are: What meaning can lie in the concept of reflection in preschools? In what situations can teachers and children in preschools use reflection? What can be the purpose of this reflection? To answer these questions, I did interviews with teachers and observations of meetings and of the work that was being done with the children. The result shows that the term of reflection is ambiguous and is being used with different interpretations in <b>the</b> <b>preschools</b> I have studied. Reflection is for instance retelling events, solving problems, cooperating and curiosity. Teachers and children use reflection in various situations everyday, both at planned and spontaneous activities. The purpose of the reflection at <b>the</b> <b>preschools</b> I have visited was for instance to find a focus in working with the children, to know how to move on and to get deeper into what you do...|$|R
40|$|Under the 1990 s {{restructuring}} of the Swedish education system, ‘the fundamentaldemocratic values’ have stipulated clearly both in the Education Act and all of thenational curricula {{as one of the}} educational goals.

Through a qualitative case study focused on apreschool in Forest municipality, Stockholm, the findings show the principal and thepedagogue in <b>the</b> chosen <b>preschool</b> are conscious {{of the importance of the}} fundamentaldemocratic values within the individual perspectives. This study also illustrates that thepedagogue have developed their understanding for the fundamental values continuously,through the several types of meetings, and have applied it to their daily activities.

25|$|The {{relationship}} between parental attitudes and a child’s self-concept is crucial during <b>the</b> <b>preschool</b> years. It {{has been reported}} that elevated stress levels in mothers correlated with reduced social skills in their children. Strong parent support networks may help to prevent the development of negative self-concept in children with cleft palate. In the later preschool and early elementary years, the development of social skills is no longer only impacted by parental attitudes but is beginning to be shaped by their peers. A cleft lip or cleft palate may affect the behavior of preschoolers. Experts suggest that parents discuss with their children ways to handle negative social situations related to their cleft lip or cleft palate. A child who is entering school should learn the proper (and age-appropriate) terms related to the cleft. The ability to confidently explain the condition to others may limit feelings of awkwardness and embarrassment and reduce negative social experiences.|$|E
