6000|$|... "Not for worlds. Besides we can't. We're paralysed. We {{exchange}} a long scared look, we publicly tremble. The <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> <b>you</b> see, we 'realise.' He has struck for freedom." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Never mind {{whether she}} did or not. The main <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> <b>you</b> did that contemptible thing. And you felt ashamed of it afterward. Aha! you feel ashamed of it now!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'For God's sake, my dear B.,' said W----at last, 'what <b>are</b> <b>you</b> [...] {{thinking}} of? Are {{you about}} to commit murder? or what other dreadful [...] <b>thing</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> meditating?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean {{something}} like that. Now <b>you</b> know how <b>things</b> <b>are,</b> <b>you</b> must choose your line. I can't judge how far your duty {{to your parents}} binds you; you can." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The <b>thing</b> <b>was,</b> <b>you</b> see, she {{happened}} to trickle in rather quietly when I happened {{to be looking at}} something, and I didn't know she was there till she suddenly grabbed it..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{we should}} drift out to sea, {{and the first}} heavy wave that caught us {{broadside}} would probably swamp us. The great <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> <b>you</b> see, to keep our head to the waves. Are you cold, love?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Out {{of sight}} out of mind!" [...] his {{companion}} laughed. Then more bravely: [...] "Wouldn't distance lessen the torment?" [...] But before Strether could reply, [...] "The <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> <b>you</b> see, Chad ought to marry!" [...] he wound up.|$|E
6000|$|... "No; there ain't; {{at least}} perhaps there ain't. Though {{as far as}} I can see, {{brothers}} and sisters {{out in the world}} are mostly as hard to each other where money is concerned as other people. But the <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> <b>you</b> didn't mean to lend it without security." ...|$|E
60|$|Such <b>things</b> <b>are,</b> <b>you</b> know. No {{amount of}} {{so-called}} realistic literature, {{no amount of}} sneers at what is dubbed melodrama, will prevent this fact occurring--and occurring very frequently {{in the streets of}} a mighty city.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Martha, Miss Tippet {{gives you}} a very good character--which is well, because I intend <b>you</b> to <b>be</b> servant to my child--her maid; but Miss Tippet qualifies her remarks by saying that <b>you</b> <b>are</b> a little {{careless}} in some <b>things.</b> What <b>things</b> <b>are</b> <b>you</b> careless in?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shut {{the shutter}} behind you. Then {{no one can}} see the light. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> quite safe. The {{servants}} all sleep in the other wing. I can show you where all the most valuable <b>things</b> <b>are.</b> <b>You</b> cannot carry them all, so we must pick the best." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes," [...] Thorn agreed. [...] "But the {{important}} <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>you</b> saw this and didn't lose your nerve. Anyhow, {{if you had}} lost it, I couldn't have blamed you; I blame myself for my confounded thoughtlessness that let you run the risk. In fact, I'm dreadfully sorry and don't mind owning that I got a fright." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Think it over--quite at your leisure--and {{some day}} you'll understand. There's no hurry," [...] he continued--"no hurry. And {{when you do}} understand, it needn't make your {{existence}} a burden to you to fancy you must tell me." [...] Oh he was so kind--kinder than ever now. [...] "The <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> <b>you</b> see, that I haven't a conscience. I only want my fun." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, you mustn't do that! That {{would be}} cruel!" [...] cried a soft voice. [...] "You must take {{him down to}} the Green Forest and let him go." [...] A gentle face with pitying eyes was bent above the trap. [...] "Just see how frightened the poor little <b>thing</b> <b>is!</b> <b>You</b> must take him {{straight}} down to the Green Forest right after breakfast." ...|$|E
5000|$|Buffy tells Giles, [...] "Ok, you're {{not having}} one of those mid-life <b>things,</b> <b>are</b> <b>you?</b> 'Cause I'm still going 'ick' from {{the last time you}} tried to {{recapture}} your youth." [...] This is a reference to [...] "Teenage Giles" [...] in Season Three's [...] "Band Candy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She is {{following}} {{me to this}} place," [...] Mrs. Crayford replied. [...] "I have been speaking to her this morning. She is just as resolute as ever to insist on your telling her of {{the circumstances under which}} Frank <b>is</b> missing. As <b>things</b> <b>are,</b> <b>you</b> have no alternative but to answer her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Lady fiddlesticks!" [...] she interrupted. [...] "What {{a stupid}} old <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>are,</b> Julien! <b>You</b> never found out, I suppose, that at heart I am a Bohemian?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Another <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> <b>you</b> may get {{involved}} in affairs of honour. I consider duelling to be a foolish practice, {{but it is no}} use one person standing up against a crowd. It is the fashion, in our days, to fight duels and, therefore, it is almost a necessity for a gentleman to be able to shoot straight; besides, although {{you might be able to}} avoid fighting a duel with any of your countrymen, there is no possibility of getting out of it, if you become involved in a quarrel with a foreigner. In that case, an Englishman who showed the white feather would be a disgrace to his country.|$|E
6000|$|... "Next term!" [...] he said. [...] "Well, you see, miss, it's this way. It's all there, in {{a manner}} of speaking, with Master Mike. He's got as much style as Mr. Joe's got, every bit. The whole <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> <b>you</b> see, miss, you get these young gentlemen of eighteen, and {{nineteen}} perhaps, and it stands to reason they're stronger. There's a young gentleman, perhaps, doesn't know as much about what I call real playing as Master Mike's forgotten; but then he can hit 'em harder when he does hit 'em, and that's where the runs come in. They aren't going to play Master Mike because he'll be in the England team when he leaves school. They'll give the cap to somebody that can make a few then and there." ...|$|E
6000|$|This futile remark made Nick laugh afresh, and {{not only}} laugh, but kiss her, which was always an intenser form of mystification for poor Lady Agnes and {{apparently}} the one he liked best to inflict; after which he said: [...] "The odd <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> <b>you</b> know, that Harsh has no wants. At least it's not sharply, not articulately conscious of them. We all pretended to talk them over together, and I promised to carry them in my heart of hearts. But upon my honour I can't remember one of them. Julia says the wants of Harsh are simply the national wants--rather a pretty phrase for Julia. She means she does everything for the place; she's really their member and this house in which we stand their legislative chamber. Therefore the lacunae I've undertaken to fill out are the national wants. It will be rather a job to rectify some of them, won't it? I don't represent the appetites of Harsh--Harsh is gorged. I represent the ideas of my party. That's what Julia says." ...|$|E
60|$|BLAYNE. Supposing <b>things</b> <b>are</b> as <b>you</b> say, he'll <b>be</b> {{a fool to}} face her. He'll {{sit tight}} at Simla.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{care where}} she is going, but one <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> certain: <b>you</b> <b>are</b> not going to her this afternoon. <b>You</b> <b>are</b> not fit for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Good!' {{interrupted}} Mr. Bounderby. 'This is good, Gradgrind! A man {{so fond of}} his daughter, that he {{runs away}} from her! This is devilish good! Ha! ha! Now, I'll tell you what, young man. I haven't always occupied my present station of life. I know what these <b>things</b> <b>are.</b> <b>You</b> may <b>be</b> astonished to hear it, but my mother - ran away from me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} have had the escape of your life, young fellah my lad. It was catchin' those Indians that put you clean out of their heads, else {{they would have been}} back to the camp for you as sure as fate and {{gathered}} you in. Of course, as you said, they have been watchin' us from the beginnin' out of that tree, and they knew perfectly well that we were one short. However, they could think only of this new haul; so it was I, and not a bunch of apes, that dropped in on you in the morning. Well, we had a horrid business afterwards. My God! what a nightmare the whole <b>thing</b> <b>is!</b> <b>You</b> remember the great bristle of sharp canes down below where we found the skeleton of the American? Well, that is just under ape-town, and that's the jumpin'-off place of their prisoners. I expect there's heaps of skeletons there, if we looked for 'em. They have a sort of clear parade-ground on the top, and they make a proper ceremony about it. One by one the poor devils have to jump, and the game is to see whether they are merely dashed to pieces or whether they get skewered on the canes. They took us out to see it, and the whole tribe lined up on the edge. Four of the Indians jumped, and the canes went through 'em like knittin' needles through a pat of butter. No wonder we found that poor Yankee's skeleton with the canes growin' between his ribs. It was horrible--but it was doocedly interestin' too. We were all fascinated to see them take the dive, even when {{we thought it would be}} our turn next on the spring-board.|$|E
6000|$|When {{they sat}} in the sun in her formal garden he quite knew how little even the tenderest {{consideration}} failed to disguise his treating her as the most exquisite of curiosities. The term of comparison most present to him was that of some obsolete musical instrument. The old-time order of her mind and her air had the stillness of a painted spinnet that was duly dusted, gently rubbed, but never tuned nor played on. Her opinions were like dried rose-leaves; her attitudes like British sculpture; her voice what he imagined of the possible tone of the old gilded silver-stringed harp in one of the corners of the drawing-room. The lonely little decencies and modest dignities of her life, the fine grain of its conservatism, the innocence of its ignorance, all its monotony of stupidity and salubrity, its cold dulness and dim brightness, were there before him. Meanwhile within him strange things took place. It was literally true that his impression began again, after a lull, to make him nervous and anxious, and for reasons peculiarly confused, almost grotesquely mingled, or at least comically sharp. He was distinctly an agitation and a new taste--that he could see; and he saw quite as much therefore the excitement she already drew from the vision of Addie, an image intensified by the sense of closer kinship and presented to her, clearly, with various erratic enhancements, by her friend the doctor's daughter. At the end of a few days he said to her: [...] "Do you know she wants to come without waiting any longer? She wants to come while I'm here. I received this morning her letter proposing it, but I've been thinking it over and have waited to speak to you. The <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> <b>you</b> see, that if she writes to YOU proposing it--" ...|$|E

50|$|Alpher told Joseph D'Agnese in his {{interview}} for Discover Magazine, There {{are two reasons}} you do science. One is the altruistic feeling that maybe you can contribute to mankind's store {{of knowledge about the}} world. The other and more personal <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>you</b> want the approbation of your peers. Pure and simple.|$|E
50|$|One Whitehall source commented: 'The energy noose {{tightened}} around Tripoli's neck. It {{was much}} more effective and easier to repair than bombs. It is like taking the key of the car away. You can't move. The great <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>you</b> can switch it all back on again if Gaddafi goes. It {{is not the same}} as if you have bombed the whole city to bits.|$|E
5000|$|Commodore {{was also}} {{critical}} of {{the leadership of the}} NHLPA: [...] I don't think it's being handled well at all. The <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> <b>you</b> look at the PA and who's in charge ... it's all the guys that have made $30 million playing this game. If there's never another game of hockey ... and they don't make another cent playing in the NHL, they're gonna be all right.|$|E
6000|$|... "Is that so?" [...] he said. [...] "Well, young man, you're {{learning}} {{now what}} happens to those who put their faith in fashionable folk {{and not in the}} Lord. Rats can't scuttle from a sinking ship faster than fashionable folk from a friend in trouble. You come along and have a bit of supper with me and my missis. We're humble trades-folk, but, perhaps as <b>things</b> <b>are,</b> <b>you</b> won't mind that." ...|$|R
