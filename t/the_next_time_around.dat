500|$|The Liber Regalis was {{translated}} into English {{for the first time}} for the coronation of JamesI in 1601, {{partly as a result of}} the reformation in England requiring services to be understood by the people, but also an attempt by antiquarians to recover a lost English identity from before the Norman Conquest. In 1685, James II, who was a Catholic, ordered a truncated version of the service omitting the Eucharist, but this was restored for later monarchs. Only four years later, the service was again revised by Henry Compton for the coronation of William III and Mary II. The Latin text was resurrected for the 1714 coronation of the German-speaking George I, since it was the only common language between the king and the clergy.

2500|$|The Indians were {{organized}} into kinship and clan networks, and marrying {{a woman from}} one of these kinship networks would make a fur trader into a member of these networks, thereby ensuring that Indians belonging to whatever clan the trader had married into {{were more likely to}} deal only with him. Furthermore, the fur traders discovered that the Indians were more likely to share food, especially during the hard months of winter, to those fur traders who were regarded as part of their communities. One fur trader who married a 18-year old Ojibwa girl described in his diary his [...] "secret satisfaction at being compelled to marry for my safety". The converse of such marriages was that a fur trader was expected to favor whatever clan/kinship network that he had married into with European goods, and a fur trader who did not would ruin his reputation. For the Ojibwa, like the other Indians, saw all life in this world being based upon reciprocal relationships, with Ojibwa women leaving behind [...] "gifts" [...] of tobacco when harvesting plants to thank nature for providing the plants while when a bear was killed, a ceremony was held to thank the bear for [...] "giving" [...] up its life to them. The Ojibwa believed if the plants and animals were not thanked for [...] "giving" [...] themselves to them, then the plants and animals would be less [...] "giving" [...] the next year, and the same principle applied to their relations with other peoples such as the fur traders. The Ojibwa, like other First Nations, always believed that animals willingly allowed themselves to be killed, and that if a hunter failed to give thanks to the animal world, then the animals would be less [...] "giving" [...] <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>time</b> <b>around.</b> As the fur traders were predominately male and heterosexual while there were few white women beyond the frontier, the Indians were well aware of the sexual attraction felt by the fur traders towards their women, who were seen as having a special power over white men. From the Ojibwa viewpoint, if one of their women gave herself to a fur trader, it created the reciprocal obligation for the fur trader to give back. Fur-trading companies encouraged their employees to take Indian wives, not only to built long-term relationships that were good for business, but also because an employee with a wife would have to buy more supplies from his employer, with the money for the purchases usually subtracted from his wages. White decried the tendency of many historians to see these women as simply [...] "passive" [...] objects that were bartered for by fur traders and Indian tribal elders, writing that these women had [...] "exert influence and be active communicators of information" [...] to effective as the wife of a fur trader, and that many of the women who married fur traders [...] "embraced" [...] these marriages to achieve [...] "useful purposes for themselves and for the communities that they lived in". One study of the Ojibwa women who married French fur traders maintained {{that the majority of the}} brides were [...] "exceptional" [...] women with [...] "unusual ambitions, influenced by dreams and visions-like the women who become hunters, traders, healers and warriors in Ruth Landes's account of Ojibwa women". Out of these relationships emerged the Métis people whose culture was a fusion of French and Indian elements.|$|E

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{immersed}} boundary method {{is applied to}} simulate incompressible turbulent flows around stationary and moving objects. The goal is {{to demonstrate that the}} immersed boundary technique along with a large eddy simulation approach is capable of simulating the effect of the so-called leading edge vortex (LEV), which can be found in flapping wing aerodynamics. A Lagrangian method is used to approximatethe solutions in the freshly cleared cells that lay within solid objects at one time step and emerge into fluid domain at <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>time</b> step. Flow <b>around</b> a stationary cylinder at ReD D 20, 40, and 3900 (based oncylinder diameter D) is first studied to validate the immersed boundary solver based on the finite volume scheme using a staggered grid. Then, a harmonically oscillating cylinder at ReD D 10 000 is considered to test the solver after the Lagrangian method is implemented to interpolate the solution in the freshly cleared cells. Finally, this approach is used to study flows around a stationary flat-plate at several angles of attack and fast pitching flat-plate. The rapidly pitching plate creates a dynamic LEV {{that can be used to}} improve the efficiency of flapping wings of micro air vehicle and to determine the optimum flapping frequency...|$|R
