5|$|In the Carnian {{stage of}} the Late Triassic (228.0 - 216.5 Mya), capitosauroids were joined by the superficially very similar Metoposauridae. Metoposaurids are {{distinguished}} from capitosauroids by the positioning of their eye sockets {{near the front of}} their skulls. Another group of stereospondyls, the plagiosaurs, had wide heads with external gills, and adapted to life at the bottom of lakes and rivers. By this time, temnospondyls had become a common and widespread component of semiaquatic ecosystems. Some temnospondyls, such as Cryobatrachus and Kryostega, even inhabited Antarctica, which was covered in <b>temperate</b> <b>forests</b> at the time.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} plant {{partners are}} reflected in the wide variety of habitats worldwide. Ectomycorrhizal Russulaceae have been observed in arctic and alpine tundra, boreal and alpine forest, north temperate forest, mires, mediterranean forests and scrub (maquis), miombo woodland, tropical lowland rainforest, tropical cloud forest, tropical dry forest, Australian eucalypt woodlands, and south <b>temperate</b> <b>forests.</b> Where they are introduced, they typically grow in plantations of their native host species, e.g. with pine in South Africa, Eucalyptus in Thailand, or birch in New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Strandzha Nature Park {{falls within}} two {{terrestrial}} ecoregions of the Palearctic temperate broadleaf and mixed forest— the Balkan mixed forests and the Euxine-Colchic deciduous forests. Forests cover 80% of the park's area, with old-growth forest forming 30% of them. These woods {{are the last}} remaining <b>temperate</b> <b>forests</b> with evergreen laurel undergrowth in Europe. The park has {{the highest number of}} vertebrate species of all protected areas in Bulgaria, including 66 species of mammals, 269 species of birds, 24 species of reptiles, 10 species of amphibia and 41 species of freshwater fish, as well as 70 species of marine fish in the waters of the Black Sea. The invertebrate fauna is poorly researched and includes 84 Bulgarian endemic species, of which 4 are local, and 34 relict species.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} part of the <b>temperate</b> <b>forest</b> is in between a north limit of central <b>temperate</b> <b>forest</b> and boundary line(38th parallel north). There are Betula platyphylla, Pinus koraiensis, Acer komarovii, Ligularia fischeri, Rhododendron aureum, Epimedium koreanum, rhubarb, Viola mandshurica, Lithospermum erythrorhizon and others.|$|R

5|$|The {{red panda}} is endemic to the <b>temperate</b> <b>forests</b> of the Himalayas, and ranges from {{the foothills of}} western Nepal to China in the east. Its easternmost limit is the Qinling Mountains of the Shaanxi Province in China. Its range {{includes}} southern Tibet, Sikkim and Assam in India, Bhutan, the northern mountains of Burma, and in south-western China, in the Hengduan Mountains of Sichuan and the Gongshan Mountains in Yunnan. It may also live in south-west Tibet and northern Arunachal Pradesh, but {{this has not been}} documented. Locations with the highest density of red pandas include an area in the Himalayas that has been proposed as having been a refuge for a variety of endemic species in the Pleistocene. The distribution range of the red panda should be considered disjunct, rather than continuous. A disjunct population inhabits the Meghalaya Plateau of north-eastern India.|$|E
25|$|Limacodidae larvae in <b>temperate</b> <b>forests</b> {{of eastern}} North America prefer glabrous leaves, presumably because the trichomes of {{pubescent}} leaves {{interfere with their}} movement.|$|E
25|$|Actinorhizal {{plants are}} the major {{contributors}} to nitrogen fixation in broad areas of the world, and are particularly important in <b>temperate</b> <b>forests.</b> The nitrogen fixation rate measured for some alder species {{is as high as}} 300kg of N2/ha/year, close to the highest rate reported in legumes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Temperate</b> rain <b>forests</b> {{occur in}} regions around the world: the Pacific <b>temperate</b> rain <b>forests</b> of the Pacific Northwest, the Valdivian <b>temperate</b> rain <b>forests</b> of southwestern South America, {{the rain forests}} of New Zealand and Tasmania, {{northwest}} Europe (small pockets in Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Iceland and a somewhat larger area in Norway), southern Japan, and the eastern Black Sea-Caspian Sea region of Turkey and Georgia to northern Iran. The moist conditions of <b>temperate</b> rain <b>forests</b> generally support an understory of mosses, ferns and some shrubs. <b>Temperate</b> rain <b>forests</b> can be <b>temperate</b> coniferous <b>forests</b> or <b>temperate</b> broadleaf and mixed forests.|$|R

It hosts 4 biodiversity hotspots: the Western Ghats, the Himalayas, the Indo-Burma region and the Sundaland. These hotspots have numerous endemic species.|$|E
25|$|Investigations of Upper Cretaceous and Early Tertiary sediments of Antarctica yield a rich {{assemblage}} of well-preserved fossil dicotyledonous angiosperm wood which provides {{evidence for the}} existence, since the Late Cretaceous, of <b>temperate</b> <b>forests</b> similar in composition {{to those found in}} present-day southern South America, New Zealand, Australia and Tasmania.

25|$|New Zealand {{comprises}} {{two separate}} islands {{located in the}} Southern Hemisphere, {{commonly referred to as}} the North Island and the South Island. The Westland rainforests are located along the central west coast portion of the South Island. South of these forests lay the Fiordland <b>temperate</b> <b>forests.</b> Many glaciers are located in the Westland area. The Southern Alps run along the coast causing orographic lifting and high precipitation.|$|E
25|$|The eastern whipbird {{is found}} in wet <b>temperate</b> <b>forests</b> {{including}} both rainforests and wet sclerophyll forests, generally near water. It occurs from eastern Victoria north through to central Queensland. A northern race, sometimes known as the northern whipbird (Psophodes olivaceus lateralis) {{is found in}} the wet tropics of North Queensland from Cooktown to Townsville. At least one study has found it to be a specialist species in terms of habitat and threatened by urbanisation.|$|E
25|$|The Westland <b>temperate</b> <b>forests</b> {{are located}} along the central {{west coast of}} New Zealand’s South Island, also known as Te Waipounamou.

25|$|The {{global climate}} of the Eocene was {{probably}} the most homogeneous of the Cenozoic; the temperature gradient from the equator to the poles was half that of today's, and the deep ocean currents were exceptionally warm. The polar regions were much warmer than today, possibly as warm as the present-day Pacific Northwest of North America. <b>Temperate</b> <b>forests</b> reached the poles themselves, while rainy tropical climates reached 45°N. The greatest difference was in temperate latitudes; nevertheless, the climate at the tropics was probably similar to today's.|$|E
25|$|Denmark {{belongs to}} the Boreal Kingdom and can be {{subdivided}} into two ecoregions: the Atlantic mixed forests and Baltic mixed forests. Almost all of Denmark's primeval <b>temperate</b> <b>forests</b> have been destroyed or fragmented, chiefly for agricultural purposes during the last millennia. The deforestation has created large swaths of heathland and devastating sand drifts. In spite of this, there are several larger second growth woodlands in the country and, in total, 12.9% {{of the land is}} now forested. Norway spruce is the most widespread tree (2017), being important in the production of Christmas trees.|$|E
25|$|The {{northern}} two-lined salamander (Eurycea bislineata) is {{a species}} of salamander in the family Plethodontidae found in Canada and the United States. Its natural habitats are <b>temperate</b> <b>forests,</b> temperate shrubland, rivers, intermittent rivers, freshwater marshes, freshwater springs, arable land, and urban areas. It is more water-oriented than the related northern redback salamander, and can often be found in and around water such as rain puddles, streams, swamps, and damp stream beds, whereas the northern redback tends {{to be found in}} damp ground, but usually not near open water.|$|E
