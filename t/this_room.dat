5|$|At {{the head}} of the {{principal}} staircase an Anteroom divides the former Great Chamber from what would have been the main bedroom. During the 19th century, <b>this</b> <b>room</b> was furnished as an armoury. The adjoining bedroom, the Garden Chamber, was used as a bedroom by Lord Curzon during the early 20th century, and as such was equipped with a plumbed bath hidden in a wardrobe, one of the few in the house.|$|E
5|$|From 1793, seven small {{houses at}} {{the east side of}} the theatre {{fronting}} on the Haymarket were demolished and replaced by a large concert room. It was in <b>this</b> <b>room</b> that Joseph Haydn gave a series of concerts, under the sponsorship of Johann Peter Salomon, on his second visit to London in 1794–95. He presented his own symphonies, some of them premieres, conducted by himself, and was paid £50 each for 20 concerts. He was feted in London and returned to Vienna in May 1795 with 12,000florins.|$|E

5|$|In the Truman Study is a {{fireplace}} mantel that was originally {{installed in the}} White House. It was removed to Blair House during Truman's occupancy, when he used <b>this</b> <b>room</b> as his personal office. In 1987, the mantel was refinished in white enamel with gold-leaf accents. In 2004, before the state funeral of Ronald Reagan, Nancy Reagan used the Truman Study to receive visitors.|$|E
5|$|Located {{near the}} retablo {{is a large}} room called the ante-sacristy, a storage room for church {{utensils}} and decorations. <b>This</b> <b>room</b> is connected to either the convent or the main sacristy which stores the church's liturgical vestments. Several wooden chests inside the sacristy carries the flaming heart, {{a symbol of the}} Augustinian order and okir motifs. The doors leading to both the ante-sacristy and sacristy is similar to the doors of another Jesuit church, the Maragondon Church. The sacristy was also built at that same time with the baptistry in 1852.|$|E
5|$|Other {{rooms in}} the state suite include the Red Room— so called because its walls are covered in red brocade— a large drawing room {{containing}} paintings by Jan Brueghel and Charles Le Brun. Like much of the palace the room contains ornate 18th-century French-style furniture. From the Red Room leads the York Room. Furnished as a state bedchamber, <b>this</b> <b>room</b> is frescoed with illustrations of the four seasons by Gregorio de Ferrari. The following room, known as the Yellow Room (or sometimes as the Louis XV Bedchamber), is another state bedroom.|$|E

One of the rooms has panels decorated with intersecting triangles.|$|E
5|$|The wolf head crest {{also appears}} in the late 16th-century stained glass of the Withdrawing Room. The chimneypiece in <b>this</b> <b>room</b> is {{decorated}} with female caryatids and bears the arms of Elizabeth I; its plaster would originally have been painted and gilded, and traces of this still remain.|$|E
5|$|This smaller room {{may have}} been used by Henry and Thomas Lyte for their studies. It too has later {{paneling}} and an alcove in which are displayed a collection of early glassware.

5|$|A {{laboratory}} {{is built}} into the rear wall, on the forts southern side. <b>This</b> <b>room</b> is set into the end of the rampart and was used to prepare gunpowder charges. A guardhouse was built at the manning parade's southern end in 1885. It is now used as a duty room for the drill squad during recreation demonstrations but originally was a guard's room and separate cells connected by telephone to Fort Largs. Up to three men appear to have been accommodated in the guard's room. When the fort was converted to use as a caravan park the guard house was converted to an ablution block. A store and ablution block were also built in 1885 between the stockade and rear defence wall.|$|E
5|$|Charles Edward Evans {{purchased}} Nailsea Court in 1906. He {{then started}} a restoration programme which took seven years. He employed Arthur James Stratton, {{an expert on}} Tudor architecture to reconstruct the west wing. The restoration included the use of materials from Over Langford Manor. The panelling was installed in his new withdrawing room. Consequently <b>this</b> <b>room</b> was called the Langford Parlour but {{is now known as}} the Langford Room. The Latch porch from Langford was at Nailsea Court for nearly twenty years, before being returned by Charles Evans to Upper Langford in 1923. The rebuilding included the erection of a tower. The first version looked similar to a lighthouse and was changed to one of Tudor appearance which was incorporated into the south wing. During World War I, in an effort to conserve coal, brick insets were built into the fireplaces to reduce their size.|$|E
5|$|Exhibits include cannons {{at the gun}} ports with shot, {{ropes and}} firing equipment, and old muskets and matchlocks. There are maps and other {{illustrations}} of historical times, including a plaque that depicts the winds and the currents in Muscat bay. One room, with a ceiling made from palm-logs, is filled with cultural relics of Oman. The square central tower holds the main museum exhibits including rugs, pottery, jewelry, weapons, household utensils and incense holders. A dining hall overlooks the courtyard {{for use by the}} distinguished visitors. An old breeze-maker has been preserved in <b>this</b> <b>room,</b> once manually operated but now mechanized.|$|E

5|$|Manager Malcolm McLaren asked {{architect}} Ben Kelly {{to refurbish}} a basement rehearsal room {{he had bought}} from Badfinger. The Sex Pistols rehearsed in <b>this</b> <b>room,</b> lived above No. 6, and recorded their first demos there. Johnny Rotten drew cartoons of the members as graffiti which was later revealed in an archaeological survey of the site. Scott Gorham bought his first guitar with Thin Lizzy on Denmark Street. He had turned up at the audition with a Japanese Les Paul Copy—when he got the job, Phil Lynott took him shopping on Denmark Street. After being told several guitars were too expensive, he settled on a Sunburst Gibson Les Paul Deluxe. Andy's Guitars was established in 1978 at No. 27 and survived for many years before closing in 2007 because of increased shop rates.|$|E
5|$|Players must guide a {{boy scout}} through a 43-room mansion {{in order to}} obtain 16 keys and a {{combination}} before running out of time. These unlock a safe containing the pills needed to save the mansion owner's life. It is necessary to jump onto platforms and evade enemies in order to progress. At the start of the game the player has three lives; a life is lost should the boy scout fall too far or come into contact with one of the mansion's servants or traps. Rooms contain doors that can be entered to move around the mansion, as well as push buttons and hazards. Pressing buttons can result in lifts being activated, platforms appearing or in an enemy appearing. One of the mansion's rooms is a corridor of eight doors with a large pair of eyes above them; <b>this</b> <b>room</b> acts as a maze. A tune is played continuously during play, but can be toggled on or off.|$|E
5|$|The main {{family living}} {{quarters}} {{are located in}} the 1752 addition. The staircase hall is the only room in the 1752 house to have kept its original, Georgian interior. The rococo plaster ceiling is attributed to Shrewsbury-born architect, Thomas Farnolls Pritchard, who also designed interiors at Tatton Hall, Powis Castle and Croft Castle. Facing the gardens, {{on the north side of}} the house, is the library. Remodelled in the early 1800s, <b>this</b> <b>room</b> was previously used by the family as a dining room. It features fitted 19th-century mahogany bookcases, decorated with small acanthus friezes. The white marble fireplace is flanked on either side by family coats of arms. Connecting the library to the staircase hall and the drawing room is the ante-room, which is furnished with pieces commissioned by the family in the late 18th century. Originally, an entrance into the hall was located in this octagonal room, until Randle Wilbraham III relocated it. The room features copies of works by Raphael, attributed to Michelangelo Maestri.|$|E
