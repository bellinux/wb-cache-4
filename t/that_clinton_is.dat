After the Saxbe fix was passed, Judicial Watch said it might seek to halt Clinton's appointment via litigation. On January 29, 2009, {{a week after}} Clinton had been sworn into the position, Judicial Watch filed the lawsuit Rodearmel v.

The suit claims <b>that</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>is</b> [...] "constitutionally ineligible" [...] to serve as Secretary of State due to the Ineligibility Clause and that Rodearmel cannot be forced to serve under her, as it would violate the oath he took as a Foreign Service Officer in 1991 to [...] "support and defend" [...] and [...] "bear true faith and allegiance" [...] to the U.S. Constitution. On February 6, a panel of three judges was appointed to hear the case.

40|$|What I wish to {{consider}} {{here is how}} understanding something {{is related to the}} justification of beliefs about what it means. Suppose, for instance, that S understands the name “Clinton ” and has a justified belief that it names Clinton. How is S’s understanding related to that belief’s justification? Or suppose that S understands the sentence “Clinton is President”, or Jones ’ assertive utterance of it, and has a justified belief that that sentence expresses the proposition <b>that</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>is</b> President, or that Jones said <b>that</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>is</b> President. How is S’s understanding related to the justifications of these beliefs? My aim is to explore the following claim. (T) Understanding is an a priori source of immediate prima facie justification for beliefs about what things mean. If knowledge is justified true belief, then, according to (T), true beliefs so justified constitute a priori knowledge. I believe this claim promises to throw interesting new light on the epistemic character and potential of Mind. In order to assess whether (T) is even remotely plausible, several preliminary clarifications are in order. I will begin with some observations about understanding, and then proceed to a discussion of justification. I will conclude with a discussion of a priori justification. 1. The objects of understanding are things that have or express meaning or content, such things as sentences, words, and speech acts. 1 One can, for instance, understand the sentence “Clinton is President”, or the words “is President”, or Jones ’ assertive utterance of tha...|$|E

2500|$|During the 2016 presidential election, Hannity {{periodically}} promoted {{conspiracy theories}} regarding Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party. Hannity promoted conspiracy theories <b>that</b> <b>Clinton</b> had serious medical problems {{and that the}} media was covering them up.

He also shared a photo from the fringe news site Gateway Pundit and falsely claimed that it showed her Secret Service agent holding a diazepam pen intended to treat seizures, when he in fact was holding a small flashlight. Furthermore, he booked medical pundits on his show to discuss these baseless theories; these pundits, despite never having personally examined Clinton, made alarmist statements about her state of health.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} {{questions}} of knowledge and belief {{in terms of public}} assumptions about President Clinton. Data from a national survey reveal the widespread assumption <b>that</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>is</b> more liberal than his record would indicate. The data suggest that while people may not structure their own beliefs along conventional ideological lines, many interpret contemporary politics in terms of broad ideological frameworks, even if those frameworks lead to misleading conclusions. Thus while Clinton 2 ̆ 7 s liberal side is well‐known (or correctly assumed), his conservative side is not: indeed, most respondents associate him with liberal indicators in nearly every area. This point is explored {{in the context of the}} relation between traditional indicators of political knowledge and ideological assumptions. The authors conclude by speculating how the notion of a uniformly “liberal” Clinton may have its origins in media coverage...|$|E
40|$|Americans {{have been}} taught to expect their presidents to be exalted figures. But the postwar figures, from JFK to LBJ, Nixon, Carter, Reagan, Bush, and Clinton, have {{presented}} a sorry roll call. Each figure possessed deep personality flaws. This article argues that Nixon was the last truly auratic president, that is, a leader who presented himself as being an exalted representative {{of the people in}} terms of his insight, courage, and convictions. However, the disastrous circumstances of his departure from the White House have punctured the auratic ideal. In contrast, Clinton’s foibles bring him closer to public life. The sympathy that exists for his plight among large numbers of the public signifies the recognition that his weaknesses are common. This article argues <b>that</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>is</b> the first post-auratic president, a fitting, depthless leader for an American polity in an age of media-based celebrities as leaders. Imagine a belated public project to commemorate the millennium: a new, dystopic Mount Rushmore, chisel-carved from a peak in the Rockies. A Mount Rashmore for the 21 st century, if you will. What four presidents from our mor-ally confused and overheated era would serve as talismans of these fin de siecle times for Americans in eras to come? I suggest John F. Kennedy for his glamor...|$|E
40|$|In just a week, Hilary Clinton {{will be in}} China for {{her first}} visit as U. S. Secretary of State. What will inform the visit? Here are a few {{readings}} that discuss it… 1. Surprise! Many China watchers were caught short by the news <b>that</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>is</b> headed to China for a visit. The tour has been put together at the last moment, with an as-yet unclear agenda, as discussed by Ian Johnson at WSJ… 2. For an updated analysis of Clinton’s likely goals during her Asia stops, see FEER’s report. One highlight from their analysis of the China visit: The final stop in China will combine personal and policy tests for Secretary Clinton. Personal, because she has long been critical of China for human rights abuses and trade issues, and Beijing {{has been trying to}} puzzle her out. Policy, because President Obama has set high goals for additional cooperation with China, beyond what President Bush achieved. 3. On Friday, Clinton gave a speech at the Asia Society that indicated the direction her visit might take: Secretary Clinton also said she will “press the case” for greater energy efficiency and clean energy, stating that climate change also has implications on global health care and economy...|$|E

40|$|This project {{seeks to}} {{investigate}} how gender {{plays a role in}} the framing of US-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton in The New York Times, The Washington Post and USA Today. Through an analysis of a selection of articles from the week of Clinton’s announcement of her candidacy in 2007 and 2015, the aim of this paper is, with an inductive approach, to discover whether a gender stereotypical framing of Clinton is apparent and how it is displayed. By combining Robert Entman’s (1993) theory on framing with gender theory by Karen Ross (2004), Sandra Bem (1974), and Susan Golombok and Robyn Fivush (1993), this project further seeks to explore the consequences of gendered framing for Clinton herself and for the general view of women in society. The analysis shows that the chosen articles consistently frame Clinton by how she fits in or deviates from stereotypical expectations of women and women behaviour. Our finding is <b>that</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>is</b> framed significantly more positive when described by traditional womanly characteristics, than when described by traditional male characteristics. The consequences of this gendered framing of Clinton are firstly, that it acts as a hindrance towards her run for the presidency, as it limits her own performance to two options: to act upon the stereotypical framing of her as a woman or to try to live up to stereotypical expectations of a president acting masculine. Ultimately, the gendered framing of Clinton can act to reproduce and uphold gender stereotypical views on women in society...|$|E
40|$|The {{topic of}} this Master’s thesis is ”Unilateralism and Multilateralism in U. S. Foreign Policy with Regard to NATO Between 1993 and 2004. ” The {{purpose of the}} study is to find out how and why has U. S. foreign policy oscillated between unilateralism and {{multilateralism}} with regard to NATO. The theoretical framework of the thesis is built around neorealism and neoliberal institutionalism. These two theories, however, are not used to explain U. S. foreign policy. Instead they are used as worldviews according to which the Clinton and Bush administrations practice foreign policy with regard to NATO. In practice these two worldviews result in unilateral and multilateral strategies. Unilateralism is coupled with neorealism and multilateralism with neoliberal institutionalism to form two models. The realist-unilateral model is centered on military power and capabilities. States behave rationally according to their national interests and seek relative gains. Thus, cooperation is not a viable course of action. The liberal-multilateral model, on the other hand, uses Robert Keohane’s concept of “complex interdependence” to explain relations among states. The core elements of this notion are: 1. multiple channels connect societies, 2. absence of hierarchy among issues (thus the boudary between domestic and foreign becomes blurred) and 3. military power is not used against other governments to resolve issues. Moreover, this model is organized around international organizations that are used to further foreign policy objectives. According to both models, the U. S is perceived as a leader or a hegemon in the world. The hypothesis presented {{at the beginning of the}} thesis is <b>that</b> <b>Clinton</b> <b>is</b> more multilateral than Bush in his foreign policy with regard to NATO. The unilateral and multilateral strategies of Presidents Clinton and Bush are tested through three indicators: U. S. foreign affairs (Function 150) and military budgets, Clinton and Bush’s national security strategies and finally military operations. The hypothesis is verified, for Clinton practices a more multilateral foreign policy than Bush. However, the differences between Clinton and Bush tend to be overemphasized. Both presidents have used unilateral and multilateral strategies to different degrees. The departure from either the neoliberal-multilateral or neorealist-unilateral model can partly be explained in terms of domestic power politics and the strategic situation of the U. S. Therefore, a worldview alone does not suffice to explain multilateral or unilateral strategies. It has to be coupled with other explanations. The primary sources of the study are Clinton and Bush’s national security strategy document and budget data between 1993 and 2004. Congressional web pages, presidents’ speeches and NATO’s documents have also served as important sources for the study. The theoretical framework builds on Kenneth Waltz’s, Robert Keohane’s and G. John Ikenberry’s research. Endast sammandrag.
