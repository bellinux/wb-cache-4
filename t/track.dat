5|$|Of {{the four}} shuttle tracks, only three are in use, {{with the former}} {{southbound}} express <b>track</b> space being used for platform space at each terminal. The former southbound local <b>track</b> is now Shuttle <b>Track</b> 1. <b>Track</b> 2 no longer exists, but the trackbed of <b>Track</b> 2 can be seen inside the tunnel from passing trains on Tracks 1 and 3. At the two terminals, the trackway for <b>Track</b> 2 is occupied by platforms that provide access to <b>Track</b> 3, which was the former northbound express <b>track.</b> The former northbound local <b>track</b> is <b>Track</b> 4. <b>Track</b> 2 was removed between the two stations in 1975.|$|E

5|$|A notable {{feature of}} Bolliger & Mabillard roller {{coasters}} is the box-section <b>track.</b> The running rails {{are connected to}} a box-section spine, instead of the circular spine used by other manufacturers. When a train travels around a box-section <b>track,</b> it creates a distinctive roaring sound, which is unique to this style of <b>track.</b> However, on some Bolliger & Mabillard roller coasters, such as Talon at Dorney Park & Wildwater Kingdom, and Gatekeeper at Cedar Point the <b>track</b> is filled with sand to reduce this noise.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the planned extension, the two tracks {{continue}} east of this station for about 700 feet along 205th Street to Webster Avenue, ending at a concrete wall, and this station does not have any crew quarters. Crews are changed at Bedford Park Boulevard, the next station south. Additionally, there is no diamond crossover between the tracks west of this station; here, a center <b>track</b> forms leading west to the Concourse Yard. Because of this, terminating trains arrive on the southern (railroad northbound) <b>track</b> and discharge their passengers before continuing east {{to the end of the}} <b>track.</b> They then use the diamond crossover there to return to this station on the northern (railroad southbound) <b>track</b> and begin service to Manhattan and Brooklyn. Due to the <b>track</b> configuration, trains may reverse into the yard from the southern <b>track,</b> and trains from the yard may start service on the northern <b>track.</b>|$|E
5|$|At Ditmas Avenue, the Culver Ramp {{ends and}} the {{underground}} line becomes elevated. This is a three-track Dual Contracts elevated on the former BMT line over McDonald (formerly Gravesend) Avenue. Just before the station, the southbound local <b>track</b> merges into the southbound express <b>track,</b> while the northbound express <b>track</b> becomes the El's bidirectional center express <b>track.</b> During the 1990s and 2000s, the center express <b>track</b> in this section was occasionally used for non-revenue testing. After Avenue X station, a ramp diverges to the surface {{for access to the}} Culver Yard of the Coney Island Yards complex. At this point the Culver Line narrows to a two-track structure bearing one more station–Neptune Avenue–before curving into West Eighth Street–New York Aquarium station on Coney Island.|$|E
