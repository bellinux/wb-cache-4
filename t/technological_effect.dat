North American Association of Fisheries Economists (NAAFE), Corvallis, 2017. Influence of the Skipper Effect in fishing efficiency {{of a mixed}} fishing fleet, looking at a Mexican case study. Understanding the factors that define technical efficiency in a fleet is a requirement to define strategies to regulate the fishing pressure. In industrial and semi-industrial fleets more weight {{has been given to}} the <b>technological</b> <b>effect,</b> while in small-scale fisheries the skipper effect has been more widely discussed. This study aimed to understand the human and technological factors that define the fishing efficiency of a semi-industrial fleet operating at the Campeche Bank, Mexico. A stochastic ray frontier was used to evaluate such efficiency. Nine variables were included: days at sea, crew size, vessel length, power-engine, skippers’ experience, skippers’ education, year-season, fishing area and fishing gear. The data from two fishing seasons (2012 and 2014) used in the analysis comes from logbooks of skippers and interviews undertaken in the Yucatan coast. A total of 1, 095 fishing trips were analyzed, the efficiency of the fleet for both year was medium (0. 72 and 0. 62). Fishing gear, days at sea, crew size, fishing zone and skipper experience were significant variables. The skipper experience (given their background), associated to other variables seemed more relevant for fishing efficiency than the <b>technological</b> <b>effect.</b> Catch composition associated to the type of gear used and fishing zone were also significant factors, which becomes relevant when one analyze the performance of a mixed fishery. ...|$|E

(2007 a), the geographical dimension of innovation deserves further attention by analysing such phenomena as R&D collaborations. In this study we focus on cross-region R&D collaborations in Europe. The European coverage is achieved by using data on collaborative R&D projects funded by the EU Framework Programmes (FPs) between organisation that are located in 255 NUTS- 2 regions of the 25 pre- 2007 EU member-states, as well as Norway and Switzerland. The objective is to identify separation effects - such as geographical or <b>technological</b> <b>effects</b> - on the constitution of cross-region collaborative R&D activities. We specify a Poisson spatial interaction model to analyse these questions. The dependent variable is the intensity of cross-region R&D collaborations, the independent variables include origin, destination and separation characteristics of interaction. The results provide striking evidence that geographical effects {{play an important role}} in determining R&D collaborations across Europe. Geographical proximity and co-localisation of organisations in neighbouring regions are important determinants of cross-region collaboration intensities. The <b>effect</b> of <b>technological</b> proximity is stronger than spatial effects.

Oil affects the demand for each profession through a <b>technological</b> <b>effect,</b> indicating complementarity between oil and engineering, manufacturing and construction; however, it also increases the ‘size of the cake’.

Therefore, the main approaches to reducing energy intensity in Hebei province are to increase in R&D investment for promoting technology progress, accelerate the structure adjustment, attach great importance to the structural shift towards less energy-intensive subsectors, and enhance the supervision over important prefectures including such areas as Tangshan, Handan...|$|E

These studies are from a macro perspective that emphasizes the role of infrastructure investment, {{as well as from the}} firm level analysis, which is mainly related to cost efficiency. In addition, recent studies of the European countries indicate that the region is now facing a weakening effect regarding the contribution of the knowledge economy, which slows economic growth. This study aims at investigating the contribution of the ICT sectors in driving economic performance in the European economies with a sectoral approach using the Input-Output (IO) methodology. The method measures the contribution of ICT sectors based on the OECD’s definition (2009) and decomposing it into several variables.
