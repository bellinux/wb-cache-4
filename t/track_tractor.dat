In this context in 1914 contacts were made with engineer Eugène Brillié of Schneider & Co. to adapt the Castéran Flexible <b>Track</b> <b>Tractor.</b> When that year war broke out, Jacques Quellennec was drafted as an infantry sergeant, witnessed most men of his unit being slaughtered during the First Battle of the Marne and was then severely wounded {{at the end of}} October. While recovering, he devised plans for an armoured tractor armed with a machine-gun and capable of destroying German machine-gun nests. Many in this period had comparable ideas but contrary to most, Quellennec had excellent contacts. Fouché had become a second lieutenant with the Grand Parc Automobile de Réserve of the Service Automobile, the Army branch responsible for motorisation, and Brillié was chief designer with one of France's main arms manufacturers. Early December, Quellennec met Fouché in Paris and both then went to Brillié to present drawings of a tracked armoured fighting vehicle. During a second visit Quellennec urged Brillié to bring over two Holt Model 75 tractors, at that time present in Tunisia, to France in order to perform the first trials. Brillié showed himself less than enthusiastic about the idea, objecting there would be not enough room on a tractor for both crew and armament. In February 1915, Quellennec was sent to an air force training base and tasked Fouché with trying to convince Brillié, without much apparent success.|$|E

50|$|All modern roller {{coasters}} have up-stop wheels that hug {{the bottom of}} the rail. As their name implies, they prevent the train from coming up off the track. Side friction wheels hug the sides of the rail, either the outside or inside, depending on the track manufacturer. These wheels help the train stay {{in the center of the}} two rails to keep the train from derailing. The last wheel set are called tractor wheels, or running wheels. Tractor wheels have a simple but important purpose. These wheels bear the weight of the train on the track, keeping the train running on the <b>track.</b> <b>Tractor</b> wheels may lift off the track in when the vertical g-force is zero or negative, but the up-stop wheels keep the train from coming completely off the rails.|$|E

40|$|Wheel {{traffic is}} {{considered}} {{a major cause of}} soil compaction in production agriculture. Soil compaction depends on initial conditions, load, contact area and tire type and shape at the soil surface. The use of tractors equipped with tracks instead of tires has the potential of reducing soil compaction because of reduced surface contact pressure and difference in load distribution over a relatively long-narrow track. The introduction of a new agricultural tractor equipped with a rubber belt track permits a crawler tractor to compete with a large four-wheel drive tractor in both speed and mobility. Soil bulk density was measured as an indication of compaction which results from trafficking with a rubber belt <b>track</b> <b>tractor</b> and a four-wheel drive tractor. The measurements were taken on three tillage treatments at three soil water contents. Most of the comparative differences in bulk density resulting from trafficking with the two tractors were non-significant at the 0. 10 level. Bulk densities at the deeper depths were significantly higher for the tire than the rubber belt track for some tillage treatments. However, in all comparisons, bulk density resulting from the rubber belt track was numerically less than from the tire...|$|E

40|$|Compaction is a {{big problem}} in {{agriculture}} today since it has negative effects on both yield and environment. The change in the environment caused by compaction will mean decreased quality of atmosphere, surface- and ground water and soil resources. It is therefore very important to know how different agricultural practices and technical solutions of machinery affect the soil and its functions in order to be ab 1 e to decrease the negative effects from farming. Three field experiments were carried out during the autumn 200 l. Vertical soil displacement and vertical soil stress was measured at 15, 30 and 50 cm depth in three different tractor comparisons; wheel- and <b>tracked</b> <b>tractor,</b> single and dual wheel and pulling and non pulling tractor. For the pull and the track experiments macroporosity, saturated hydraulic conductivity and bulk density were also measured. Calculations of the vertical soil stress were also made. For the single- dual wheel experiment a John Deere 4640 with single wheel and a wheel load of 2500 kg and a Steiger with dual wheels and a wheel load of 2200 kg were used. Both tractors had 60 kPa tyre inflation pressure. The John Deere was also used, together with a cultivator, for the pull experiment. These two experiments were carried out at Staby Säteri, Uppland. The experiment with a tracked vehicle was carried out at Krenkerup Gods, Lolland, Danmark with a rubber <b>tracked</b> <b>tractor</b> weighing 18, 5 tons and a wheel tractor weighing 9, 7 tons. The <b>tracked</b> <b>tractor</b> was balanced before comparing it to the wheeled tractor to get the weight distribution as even as possible. Vertical soil stress and vertical soil displacement right under the wheels of the single and dual wheels did not differ significantly. The soil stress was lowest between the dual wheel at 15 cm depth but ii was evenly distributed under the wheels at 50 cm depth. No {{significant differences were found between}} a non pulling and a pulling tractor regarding vertical soil stress and soil displacement. There was however a tendency that the saturated hydraulic conductivity was lowest after the pass of a pulling tractor. It is possible that a higher pull would have affected the soil more. The soil stress was higher at 15 and 30 cm depth for the wheeled compared to the <b>tracked</b> <b>tractor.</b> There were no significant differences in soil displacement, saturated hydraulic conductivity and bulk density but there was a tendency that the bulk density was higher for the tracked than for the wheeled tractor. The most important conclusions were: (1) The two tyres in a dual wheel arrangement acted as two separate wheels which makes it more relevant to talk about wheelload than axle 1 oad regarding the risk for subsoil compaction. This is a very important result because the recommendation today is to avoid an axle load over 6 tons. (2) Even for a well balanced <b>tracked</b> <b>tractor</b> the maximum soil stress will be considerably higher than the theoretically calculated. In spite of these problems and a higher total weight, a <b>tracked</b> <b>tractor</b> can have a smaller impact on the soil than a wheeled tractor. (3) The model calculations correlated well with the measured values in the subsoil but not in the topsoil!. A better approximation for the ground pressure than the tyre inflation pressure is however' needed since the ground pressure of ten was as much as twice as high as the tyre inflation pressure...|$|R
50|$|Tractors can be {{generally}} classified by {{number of axles}} or wheels, with main categories of two-wheel tractors (single-axle tractors) and four-wheel tractors (two-axle tractors); more axles are possible but uncommon. Among four-wheel tractors (two-axle tractors), most are two-wheel drive (usually at the rear); but many are two-wheel drive with front wheel assist, four-wheel drive (often with articulated steering), or <b>track</b> <b>tractors</b> (with steel or rubber tracks).|$|R
