But in designing a pulse <b>telemetering</b> <b>receiver</b> the frequency shift problem is often encountered, the shift often greatly wider than the signal bandwidth is very unfavorable for improving receiver working sensitivity. Either to limit transmitter frequency stability strictly or to adapt AFC system in receiver for tracking carrier wave can solve the problem above, the AFC system method could improve the receiver’s performance, but the equipment is complicated. To what extent the receiver working sensitivity will be effected and how to judge the effection in case of adapting VF matched filter and RF being wideband in receiver are this paper’s emphasis. In this paper the power density spectrum distribution of the white noise which has passed through the non-linear system-the linear detector is analysed theoretically, and the improved working sensitivity of the receiver with video matched filter and its difference sensitivity value to that of the optimal receiver are derived. The tested working sensitivity data of two kind pulse receivers with different RF bands are given and the theoretical calculation results conform well with these data, thus it is proven that adapting video matched filter in pulse receiver is a effective approach for compensating the receiver working sensitivity dropping from RF bandwidth increase...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A {{miniature}} telemetry {{system for}} recording neural action potential in freely behaving rats is described. Together with the using of surface-mounted devices (SMDs) and radio telemetric technology, the telemetric device {{is suitable for}} recording neural potential in freely behaving rats. The device includes a headstage (including a microelectrode and a high impedance preamplifier), a backstage (including a main amplifier, RC-filters, a FM <b>telemeter),</b> a FM <b>receiver,</b> an oscillograph which can store {{the wave of the}} signals and a computer which is used to analyse the wave of the signals. A detailed printed-circuit layout will allow the system to be easily duplicated. So it can be easily generalized in other neuroscientists who are not familiar with wireless-transmission technologies...|$|R
40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 10 - 12, 1972 / International Hotel, Los Angeles, CaliforniaElectrically-powered arm braces {{have reached}} a stage of {{development}} sufficient to permit the restoration of arm motion to a severely paralyzed person. Although many functional tasks can be performed with these powered braces, the degree of function attained is still limited by {{the capabilities of the}} control system. Most functional orthotic controls presently in use are of a switch type which provide sequential off/on control of the orthesis. Extra-oral tongue operated switch controls are now used routinely, and, although they are easily fitted, inexpensive and reliable, still they do not provide the degree of control which is desirable. This paper describes the developmental work being done at Rancho Los Amigos Hospital on intra-oral telemetry control systems. The design of a tongue-actuated intra-oral telemetry control system to control the “Rancho Electric Arm” (a seven-degree-of-freedom electrically-powered arm brace) is described in detail. The system consists of 15 specially designed solid state strain gauge pressure transducers and an eight-channel digital transmitter mounted in a metal dental appliance. The control signals which are generated are <b>telemetered</b> to a <b>receiver</b> mounted on the patient’s wheelchair and are used to control the velocity of the respective arm brace joints. Patient tests with the system have shown that the telemetered signal is of sufficient quality to effectively control the “Rancho Electric Arm. ” Although a patient has been fitted with a prototype intra-oral control unit, it must be clearly understood that the system has not yet been perfected {{to the point that it}} is a functional control system for patient use...|$|R
