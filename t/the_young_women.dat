5|$|Harold is escorted {{back to the}} {{psychiatric}} center where he is tormented by Nurse Innes (Nancy Fish). Later, Mulder finds Innes lying on the floor, half-conscious. Innes claims Harold went berserk and attacked her. One of the other patients, Chuck Forsch, tells Scully that Nurse Innes was trying to poison Harold. Scully slowly realizes that Innes, not Harold, {{was responsible for the}} murders. When Innes attacks Scully with a scalpel, Scully draws her weapon and fires, striking her in the shoulder. While summarizing the case with Mulder, Scully explains that Innes had been taking Harold's unused medication, triggering violent and unpredictable behavior. Scully hypothesizes that Innes committed the murders in order to destroy the love Harold felt towards <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>women.</b> Later, Harold's body is discovered in a nearby alley, the apparent victim of respiratory failure. Scully, however, suspects that Harold died from what Innes took away from him. Scully admits to Mulder that she saw the ghost of the fourth victim shortly after she was murdered. Later, Scully sees Harold's spirit sitting {{in the back seat of}} her car.|$|E

50|$|The {{older woman}} discovers that, after getting wet in the rain, the mask is {{impossible}} to remove. She reveals her scheming to <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> and pleads with her to help take off <b>the</b> mask. <b>The</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> agrees to remove the mask after the older woman promises not to interfere with her relationship with Hachi. <b>The</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> breaks off <b>the</b> mask with a hammer. Under the mask, the older woman's face is covered with sores. <b>The</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> thinks <b>the</b> older woman {{has turned into a}} demon, and runs from her; the older woman runs after her, crying out that she is a human being, not a demon. <b>The</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> leaps over <b>the</b> pit, and as the older woman leaps after her the film ends.|$|R
50|$|In {{the next}} scene, <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> {{was shown to}} be repenting and after her release from the prison, she started to try {{establish}} {{a relationship with the}} older woman. Although her first try of introducing herself was rejected, she was shown to repeatedly try to help the blind older woman several times including hanging a take-out on the older woman's door grill and sneaking into the older woman's house to help her out. In one of the last scenes, <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>woman</b> was showing to be attending to the older woman when the latter fell sick. The older women, realizing how much <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>woman</b> was trying to help her was shown to be hugging <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> out of forgiveness and appreciation. In the last scene, <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>woman</b> was showing to be helping the older woman to eat while on their right, two framed pictures were shown. The first one with the older woman and her husband and her son, while in the second, the older <b>woman</b> with <b>the</b> <b>younger</b> <b>woman.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{population}} was highly {{supportive of the}} war efforts. The political left supported the war (unlike World War I, which Socialists opposed.) The churches showed much less pacifism than in 1914. The Church of God, based in Anderson, had a strong pacifist element, reaching a high point in the late 1930s. The Church regarded World War II as a just war because America was attacked. Anti-Communist sentiment has since kept strong pacifism from developing in the Church of God. Likewise the Quakers, with a strong base near Richmond, generally regarded World War II as a just war and about 90% served, although there were some conscientious objectors. The Mennonites and Brethren continued their pacifism, but {{the federal government was}} much less hostile than before. The churches helped their young men to both become conscientious objectors and to provide valuable service to the nation. Goshen College set up a training program for unpaid Civilian Public Service jobs. Although <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>women</b> pacifists were not liable to the draft, they volunteered for unpaid Civilian Public Service jobs to demonstrate their patriotism; many worked in mental hospitals.|$|E

50|$|A game {{is usually}} {{conducted}} as follows. A young man on horseback waits at a starting line.

If <b>the</b> <b>young</b> man {{is able to}} catch up to <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> before they reach the finish line, he may reach out to her and steal a kiss, which constitutes victory. However, if <b>the</b> <b>young</b> man has not caught up to <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> by <b>the</b> time they reach the finish line, <b>the</b> <b>young</b> <b>woman</b> turns around and chases <b>the</b> <b>young</b> man back to the starting line.
