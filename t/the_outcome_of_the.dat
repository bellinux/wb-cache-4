30|$|For <b>the</b> second aim <b>of</b> this paper, {{we assume}} a network {{consists}} of several complete components {{and a complete}} network. Firstly, <b>the</b> stability <b>of</b> components does not generate a stable overall network. When comparing <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stable components <b>of</b> a network with <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complete network consisted <b>of</b> <b>the</b> same size <b>of</b> each component, we find that <b>the</b> individual <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complete components are smaller than <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complete network. Secondly, comparing <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> complete giant component with <b>the</b> <b>outcomes</b> <b>of</b> other components of a network shows that <b>the</b> individual <b>outcomes</b> are higher in the giant component.|$|R

5|$|Herodotus {{tells us}} that, on seeing <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battle {{hung in the}} balance, the {{disarmed}} Samians had joined in {{on the side of}} the allies, doing what they could. This inspired the other Ionian contingents to turn on the Persians as well. At which stage in the battle this happened is not clear; the Samians were presumably not in the main battle line (being disarmed), so it may have been after the Persians retreated to the camp. Meanwhile, the Milesians who were guarding the passes of Mycale also turned on the Persians. At first they misdirected the fleeing Persian contingents so that they ended up back amongst the Allied troops; then, perhaps seeing <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> battle was certain, they began killing the fleeing Persians.|$|E

5|$|The Court has no {{original}} {{jurisdiction in}} most cases, {{meaning that it}} can only hear cases appealed to the Court after having been previously heard in lower courts.

The circuit court decision can be appealed to the Indiana Court of Appeals or the Indiana Tax Court, who can hear the case or enforce the lower court's decision. If the parties still disagree with <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> case, they can appeal the decision to the Indiana Supreme Court. The Court can choose {{to hear the case}} and possibly overturn the previous judgment, or it can decline to accept the case and uphold the decision of the lower courts.|$|E

The situation remained explosive, and so Dalrymple agreed to remove both regiments to Castle William. Adams wanted the soldiers to have a fair trial, because this would show that Boston was not controlled by a lawless mob, but was instead the victim of an unjust occupation. He convinced his cousins John Adams and Josiah Quincy to defend the soldiers, knowing that those Whigs would not slander Boston to gain an acquittal. However, Adams wrote essays condemning <b>the</b> <b>outcome</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trials; he thought that the soldiers should have been convicted of murder.|$|E
