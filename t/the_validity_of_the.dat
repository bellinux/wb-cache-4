5|$|After Burke's first {{campaign}} for alderman, {{he has been}} unopposed in most of his re-election campaigns. In 2007, Burke faced his first opponent since 1971, a school teacher who had never run for office. A Burke supporter unsuccessfully challenged <b>the</b> <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> opponent's ballot application, but the case was tied up in court {{for most of the}} campaign, and Burke went on to win with nearly 90 percent of the vote.|$|E
5|$|Coffee Stain Studios {{released}} Goat Simulator worldwide on 1 April 2014, {{aware that}} tying the date with April Fools' Day may raise doubts on <b>the</b> <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> game. Those that pre-ordered the game through Coffee Stain's website received early {{access to the}} title three days ahead of release. The official release trailer for Goat Simulator is a loose parody of the highly praised teaser trailer released for Dead Island, showing, among shots of the game, reversed slow-motion footage of the goat crashing through a building after being launched from an exploding gas station.|$|E
5|$|However, other taxonomists {{challenged}} <b>the</b> <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{species as}} early as 1939, noting that the Lānai hookbill was only known from one specimen and arguing that it was merely an aberrant and partially albino female ōū. The hookbill's validity was not confirmed until 1989 when the specimen's skull was removed and examined. The bird's cranial osteology, myology, plumage, and bill morphology confirmed the distinctness of the species.|$|E

5|$|The {{third and}} final Part lists some of Kennedy's reservations. He would not say that the {{defendant}} must be present at all stages of the trial.

Kennedy writes that he feels {{it was not necessary}} to delve into <b>the</b> <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> conspiracy charge, and he expresses no view on the merits of the other limitations of the commission noted in Part V of the Decision.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Euclidean {{algorithm}} can {{be proven}} by a two-step argument.

In the second step, it is shown that any common divisor of a and b, including g, must divide r'N−1; therefore, g must be less than or equal to r'N−1. These two conclusions are inconsistent unless r'N−1 = g.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{publication}} of the experiment in American Medicine, physician Augustus P. Clarke criticized the experiment's validity. Clarke noted {{that at the time of}} death there is a sudden rise in body temperature as the lungs are no longer cooling blood, causing a subsequent rise in sweating which could easily account for MacDougall’s missing 21 grams. Clarke also pointed out that, as dogs do not have sweat glands, they would not lose weight in this manner after death. Clarke's criticism was published in the May issue of American Medicine. Arguments between MacDougall and Clarke debating <b>the</b> <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> experiment continued to be published in the journal until at least December that year.|$|E

5|$|The Court of Chancery could grant three {{possible}} remedies– specific performance, injunctions and damages. The remedy of specific performance is, in contractual matters, an order {{by the court}} which requires the party in breach of contract to perform his obligations. <b>The</b> <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> contract {{as a whole was}} not normally considered, only whether there was adequate consideration and if expecting the party that breached the contract to carry out his obligations was viable. Injunctions, on the other hand, are remedies which prevent a party from doing something (unlike specific performance, which requires them to do something). Until the Common Law Procedure Act 1854, the Court of Chancery was the only body qualified to grant injunctions and specific performance.|$|E
5|$|The barons {{anticipated}} that the King would act in accordance with these charters, subject to the law and moderated by {{the advice of the}} nobility. Uncertainty continued, and in 1227, when he was declared of age and able to rule independently, Henry announced that future charters had to be issued under his own seal. This brought into question <b>the</b> <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous charters issued during his minority, and Henry actively threatened to overturn the Charter of the Forest unless the taxes promised in return for it were actually paid. In 1253, Henry confirmed the charters once again in exchange for taxation.|$|E
5|$|Townsend was arraigned on 20 August, but {{strongly}} {{questioned the}} view that his writings were subversive {{as well as the}} legal foundations of the charges. Along with the other defendants, Townsend was as before strongly defended by senators with anti-interventionist sympathies, including Gerald Nye who said the defendants were no more guilty of sedition than he had been for speaking out against intervening in the war. In fact there were from the beginning many concerns even within the US government about <b>the</b> <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> proceedings and their constitutionality as no clear evidence had yet been uncovered to demonstrate that the defendants were in collusion with Nazi Germany or with each other.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} <b>the</b> predictive <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Washington State Juvenile Pre-Screen Assessment (WSJCA pre-screen) in the Netherlands.

The present study showed <b>the</b> predictive <b>validity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> WSJCA pre-screen in the Netherlands to be modest too, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) <b>of.</b> 625. Modifying <b>the</b> scoring procedure by means of chi-squared automatic interaction detector analyses significantly improved <b>the</b> predictive <b>validity</b> to an AUC <b>of.</b> 702. <b>The</b> modified scoring procedure is time-saving because only variables that uniquely contribute to <b>the</b> prediction <b>of</b> recidivism are included, which at the same time leads to a more accurate prediction of recidivism...|$|R
