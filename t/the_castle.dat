5|$|In 1518, in {{the absence}} of Adam Gordon, <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> was {{captured}} by Alexander Sutherland, the legitimate heir to the Earldom of Sutherland. The Gordons quickly retook <b>the</b> <b>castle,</b> captured Alexander and placed his head on a spear on top of <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> tower. Alexander's son John made an attempt on <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> in 1550, but was killed in <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> garden. During the more peaceful 17th century, the keep was extended {{with the addition of a}} large house, built around a courtyard to the south-west.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unclear}} if <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> and town played any {{part in the}} English Civil War between 1642–45, {{although}} cannonballs from the period have been discovered within <b>the</b> <b>castle.</b> Local oral tradition states that <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> was slighted, or deliberately destroyed, during the war. Stones from <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> were used for local building work by the 17th century onwards, and by the 18th century a house and shop had been constructed in the eastern bailey of <b>the</b> <b>castle,</b> along with a yard and garden. A gallows operated at <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> until 1790. Buildings continued to encroach on <b>the</b> <b>castle.</b> By {{the end of the}} 19th century a school and a house, Castle Lodge, had been built in <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> grounds. Other buildings were built as lean-to's against <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> walls.|$|E

5|$|King Philip VI of France (1293–1350) {{stayed at}} <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> in 1332. Due to the Anglo-French {{hostilities}} <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> was playing {{an increasingly important}} role. During the Hundred Years' War the English were given <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> from 1360 to 1385 by the Treaty of Brétigny. <b>The</b> <b>castle</b> was yielded reluctantly to Edward III of England's regent in France, John Chandos, on 25 October 1361. He had brought {{the brother of the}} keeper to <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> and threatened to behead him unless there was an immediate capitulation. French troops commanded by the Duke of Bouillon and Geoffroy III of Rochefoucauld laid siege to <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> in 1380, but it did not yield until five years later. The English later regained <b>the</b> <b>castle,</b> but in 1442 Charles VII of France (1403–61) finally captured it from the English.|$|E
5|$|A large deer park, {{owned by}} the Crown, was {{established}} around <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> to provide hunting grounds. <b>The</b> <b>castle</b> was carefully positioned next to the park, which was overlooked by the motte. A vineyard was also maintained alongside <b>the</b> <b>castle.</b> The old Anglo-Saxon manorial centre {{was moved to the}} site, and as a result the Anglo-Saxon settlement of Berkhamsted also shifted from the area now called Northchurch to the castle; several mills, essential for grinding flour, were present there in 1086.|$|E

5|$|A small deer {{park was}} {{established}} to the south-west of <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> during this period, incorporating <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> mill within its boundaries, and it was occasionally supplied with deer from Kerrybullock, another park belonging to the earldom.

5|$|According to Turkish {{traveller}} Evliya Çelebi, {{who visited}} the city in 1670, at that time there were 200 houses within <b>the</b> <b>castle,</b> 200 in the Christian eastern neighborhood of Kyçyk Varosh (meaning small neighborhood outside <b>the</b> <b>castle),</b> 150 houses in the Byjyk Varosh (meaning big neighborhood outside <b>the</b> <b>castle),</b> and six additional neighborhoods: Palorto, Vutosh, Dunavat, Manalat, Haxhi Bey, and Memi Bey, extending on eight hills around <b>the</b> <b>castle.</b> According to the traveller, the city had at that time around 2000 houses, eight mosques, three churches, 280 shops, five fountains, and five inns. From the 16th century until the early 19th century Gjirokastër {{went from being a}} predominantly Christian city to one with a Muslim majority due to much of the urban population converting to Islam alongside an influx of Muslim converts from the surrounding countryside.|$|E
5|$|After 1544 {{the estate}} {{began to be}} broken up; first the parks were sold and then <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> itself, bought by Lord Richard Rich from Edward VI for £700 in 1551.

5|$|After Colonel Brigg's {{death in}} 1900, <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> {{passed into the}} hands of the Wearmouth Coal Company about 1908, and from there to the National Coal Board. Due to the {{expansion}} of Sunderland in the 1940s, <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> became surrounded by housing estates including those of Castletown and Hylton Castle. <b>The</b> <b>castle</b> was vandalised and had the lead from its roof stolen. In 1950, due to local pressure and the threat of demolition, <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> and chapel were taken into the care of the Ministry of Works. Due to the advanced decay of the 19th-century alterations, the ministry removed all internal partitions and consolidated the shell to reveal the remaining medieval masonry. The ministry also appointed a full-time custodian and replaced the missing lead roof with roofing felt to make the site waterproof.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> New <b>Castle</b> of Ansembourg (Grand Château d'Ansembourg), {{in central}} Luxembourg {{is one of}} <b>the</b> <b>castles</b> {{belonging}} to <b>the</b> Valley of <b>the</b> Seven <b>Castles.</b> Located about one kilometre or just over half a mile below <b>the</b> Old <b>Castle</b> of Ansembourg, it was built by the industrialist Thomas Bidart in 1639.|$|R
5|$|After Margaret's death, <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> {{continued}} to be owned by the Dacre family until the death of Randal Dacre in 1634, when it passed briefly to the Crown. By 1675 <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> had become derelict and was restored by the then Lord Dacre, Thomas Lennard. A new entrance to <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> was constructed and square, 17th-century windows installed. After Thomas's death in 1715 <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> was sold to Edward Hassell. The condition of <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> deteriorated again in the 18th century, becoming overgrown and dilapidated, and by the 19th century the Hassell family were {{using it as a}} farmhouse.|$|E
5|$|After a {{long period}} of {{remaining}} empty, <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> slowly began to decay, until in 1812, when Simon Temple, a local businessman, leased <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> from the Strathmores and made it habitable. He re-roofed the chapel (allowing it to be used for public worship again), added battlements to the wings and cultivated the gardens. However, his failed business ventures prevented him from completing his work, and in 1819 <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> was lived in by a Mr. Thomas Wade.|$|E
5|$|After {{being held}} by the de Clare and Despenser {{families}} for several centuries <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> was acquired by Richard de Beauchamp in 1423. Richard conducted extensive work on <b>the</b> <b>castle,</b> founding the main range {{on the west side}} of <b>the</b> <b>castle,</b> dominated by a tall octagonal tower. Following the Wars of the Roses, the status of <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> as a Marcher territory was revoked and its military significance began to decline. The Herbert family took over the property in 1550, remodelling parts of the main range and carrying out construction work in the outer bailey, then occupied by Cardiff's Shire Hall and other buildings. During the English Civil War Cardiff Castle was initially taken by a Parliamentary force, but was regained by Royalist supporters in 1645. When fighting broke out again in 1648, a Royalist army attacked Cardiff in a bid to regain <b>the</b> <b>castle,</b> leading to the Battle of St Fagans just outside the city. Cardiff Castle escaped potential destruction by Parliament after the war and was instead garrisoned, probably to protect against a possible Scottish invasion.|$|E

5|$|After {{civil war}} broke out in England in 1135, the third earl, also called William, set about {{improving}} the defences of <b>the</b> <b>castle.</b> He began to build a tall keep {{on top of the}} motte, reinforcing the surrounding earthworks with stone walls. A planned settlement was established alongside <b>the</b> <b>castle,</b> surrounded by its own earthworks and walls, and the Peddars Way was redirected to pass by <b>the</b> <b>castle,</b> town and priory, all important symbols of the de Warennes' power in the region. Hamelin de Warenne acquired <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> through marriage and curtailed the building work on the keep around 1165, but completed the construction of three large stone gatehouses in <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> and town. One of these, the town's bailey gate, still survives intact.|$|E
5|$|After the {{restoration}} of Charles II to the throne in 1660, a survey of <b>the</b> <b>castle</b> was carried out, which recommended repairs to the site.
