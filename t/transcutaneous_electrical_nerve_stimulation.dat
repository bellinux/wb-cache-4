Materials and methods: A pilot study was conducted in 14 patients (age 30. 9 ± 7. 5 years) with second- and third-degree burns of different types. The burn types included electrical, fire/flame, and chemical. All patients received continuous and intermittent <b>electrical</b> <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>stimulation</b> sessions three times per week for 4 weeks. Each session had a duration of 30 minutes. A pair of electrodes were placed around the burn. The primary efficacy endpoint was the perception of pain assessed by a visual analog scale at baseline and at the 30 th day. Results: A significant reduction of pain perception was reported (8. 0 ± 1. 7 vs 1. 0 ± 0. 5; P= 0. 027) by all patients after electrical stimulation therapy.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND: <b>Transcutaneous</b> <b>electrical</b> tibial <b>nerve</b> <b>stimulation</b> (TENS) is {{of growing}} {{interest}} {{for the treatment of}} fecal incontinence (FI), but its mechanism of action remains uninvestigated. We aimed to further assess the anorectal response to TENS in a dynamic model. METHODS: We performed a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blinded crossover study in 19 patients suffering from FI to assess the effects of TENS on anorectal function. Anorectal physiology and perception were recorded through two sequences of rectal isobaric distension using an electronic barostat device to measure anal and rectal pressures, rectal volumes, and perception scores. KEY RESULTS: Maximal rectal pressure and volume variation were affected by TENS, with higher mean maximal rectal pressure (5. 33 and 4. 06  mmHg in the active and sham TENS respectively, p <  0. 0001) and lower volume variation (11. 45 and 14. 7  mL in the active and sham stimulation respectively, p <  0. 05). Rectal compliance was not modified by active TENS. Pressure of the upper anal canal was significantly lower with raised isobaric distension in sequences assigned to active TENS. CONCLUSIONS & INFERENCES: Acute TENS modified anorectal physiology by strengthening the myogenic response to distension rather than increasing muscle relaxation and related rectal compliance in patients with FI...|$|R
25|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} {{can also}} {{be applied to the}} anal sphincters and pelvic floor muscles, inducing muscle contraction without traditional exercises (similar to <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>stimulation,</b> TENS). The evidence supporting its use is limited, and any benefit is tentative. In light of the above, intra-anal electrical stimulation (using an anal probe as electrode) appears to be more efficacious than intra-vaginal (using a vaginal probe as electrode). Rarely, skin reactions may occur where the electrodes are placed, but these issues typically resolve when the stimulation is stopped. Surgically implanted sacral nerve stimulation may be more effective than exercises, and electrical stimulation and biofeedback may be more effective than exercises or electrical stimulation by themselves. TENS is also sometimes used to treat FI by transcutaneous tibial nerve stimulation.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectives. To {{assess whether}} {{electrical}} stimulation of ischaemic calf muscles in claudicants causes a systemic inflammatory response and to evaluate effects of its chronic application on muscle function and walking ability. Design. Prospective {{randomised controlled trial}} of calf muscle stimulation. Materials and methods. Stable claudicants were randomised to receive either active chronic low frequency (6 Hz) motor stimulation (n= 15) or, as a control treatment, submotor <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>nerve</b> (TENS) <b>stimulation</b> (n= 15) of calf muscles in one leg, 3 × 20 min per day for four weeks. Leucocyte activation was quantified by changes in cell morphology, vascular permeability by urinary albumin:creatinine ratio (ACR), calf muscle function by isometric twitch contractions and walking ability by treadmill performance pre- and post-intervention. Results. Acute active muscle stimulation activated leucocytes less (28 % increase) than a standard treadmill test (81 % increase) and did not increase ACR. Chronic calf muscle stimulation significantly increased pain-free walking distance by 35 m (95 % CI 17, 52, P< 0. 001) and maximum walking distance by 39 m (95 % CI 7, 70, P< 0. 05) while control treatment had no effect. Active stimulation prevented fatigue of calf muscles during isometric electrically evoked contractions by abolishing the slowing of relaxation that was responsible for loss of force. Conclusions. Chronic electrical muscle stimulation is an effective treatment for alleviating intermittent claudication which, by targeted activation of a small muscle mass, does not engender a significant systemic inflammatory response...|$|R
40|$|A growing {{literature}} has reported {{a significant reduction}} in pain sensitivity among hypertensioe animals and humans. One of the key questions about this finding is whether a reduced sensitivity to pain can be observed in normotensive individuals who go on to develop high blood pressure. Blood pressure was re-assessed in one hundred and fifteen 19 year-old boys initially tested at age 14, when they were also presented with a pain stimulus (mechanical finger pressure). Analyses indicated that information regarding pain sensitivity improved prediction of changes in blood pressure beyond that afforded by differences in blood pressure at age 14, parental history of hypertension, and body mass index. Similar results were found in comparable analyses predicting 24 -hour blood pressure recorded in one hundred and seventeen of the young men at age 22. Significant associations were also observed between pain sensitivity in 14 year-olds and 24 -hour heart rate variability in various frequency bands at age 22, suggesting increased sympathetic and reduced parasympathetic tone among individuals less sensitive to pain. In order to further assess the relationship between autonomic function and pain sensitivity, one hundred and sixteen adolescent boys were assessed for pain sensitivity and autonomic responses to orthostatic challenge. Analyses indicated that exaggerated autonomic responses to postural change were associated with reduced pain sensitivity. Finally, to examine the potential role of endogenous opioids in blood pressure-related hypoalgesia, a group of young normotensive men were administered low-frequency <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>nerve</b> 5 <b>stimulation</b> (TENS), which has been demonstrated to elicit endogenous opioid release, prior to being presented with two painful stimuli (electric shock and arm ischemia).

40|$|PurposePostural {{control of}} {{undisturbed}} standing {{is known to}} be centrally regulated. There are also evidences that postural control is impaired with muscle fatigue, i. e. a reduction in stability is usually observed after prolonged or repeated exercise. However, there is little information available about the origin of impaired postural control with muscle fatigue. The aim {{of the present study was}} to determine the extent and origin of postural control impairment after a fatiguing exercise performed with the plantar flexors (PF). MethodsTen healthy men (26 ± 3 years) reported to the laboratory for two experimental sessions, performed on separate days in a randomized order. Both sessions consisted in a fatiguing exercise at the PF level (6 series of concentric-eccentric upright PF contractions, 30 s each, 90 s recovery). Neuromuscular fatigue (respectively postural stability) was quantified before and immediately after exercise in one session, whereas postural stability was assessed during quiet standing on a force plate at similar time points in the other experimental session. Neuromuscular alterations were assessed via techniques combining voluntary contractions, <b>transcutaneous</b> tibial <b>nerve</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>stimulations</b> and surface EMG activity recordings from soleus, gastrocnemius lateralis and gastrocnemius medialis muscles. ResultsA progressive reduction in PF maximal voluntary force (MVC: – 25 ± 18 %, P< 0. 05) was measured, together with a reduced maximal voluntary activation level (VAL: – 14 ± 18 %, P< 0. 05). A reduction in the doublet force at 10 Hz/doublet force at 100 Hz ratio (P 10 /P 100 ratio: – 13 ± 6 %, P< 0. 05) was also observed, whereas M-wave properties were well preserved. Various indexes of postural control were altered, such as an increased stabilogram surface (+ 141 ± 136 %, P< 0. 05). A linear relationship was found between the extent of MVC force loss and the reduction in VAL (r= 0. 87, P< 0. 05), but no correlation was found between the loss in VAL and the change in postural control measurements. ConclusionAlthough muscle fatigue, as reflected by PF MVC force loss, appears to be of central origin, it seems that other mechanisms, presumably peripheral, explain the alteration of posture in quiet upright stance after exercise...|$|R
2500|$|Immediate though {{temporary}} {{relief of}} piriformis syndrome {{can usually be}} brought about by injection of a local anaesthetic into the piriformis muscle. [...] Symptomatic relief of muscle and nerve pain can also sometimes be obtained by non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and/or muscle relaxants, though {{the use of such}} medication or even more powerful prescription medication for relief of sciatica is often assessed by patients to be largely ineffective at relieving pain. Conservative treatment usually begins with stretching exercises, myofascial release, massage, and avoidance of contributory activities such as running, bicycling, rowing, heavy lifting, etc. Some clinicians recommend formal physical therapy, including soft tissue mobilization, hip joint mobilization, teaching stretching techniques, and strengthening of the gluteus maximus, gluteus medius, and biceps femoris to reduce strain on the piriformis. More advanced physical therapy treatment can include pelvic-trochanter isometric stretching, hip abductor, external rotator and extensor strengthening exercises, [...] <b>transcutaneous</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>stimulation</b> (TENS), and massage physiotherapy of the piriformis muscle region. One study of 14 people with what appeared to be piriformis syndrome indicated that rehabilitation programs that included physical therapy, low doses of muscle relaxants and pain relief medication were effective at alleviating most muscle and nerve pain caused by what the research subjects had been told was piriformis syndrome. [...] However, as this study included very few individuals and did not have a control group not receiving treatment (both serious methodological flaws), it provides no insight as to whether the pain in the piriformis would have simply dissipated on its own without any treatment at all and is therefore not only uninformative, it may actually be misleading. The injury is considered largely self-limiting and spontaneous recovery is usually on the order of a few days or a week to six weeks or longer if left untreated.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} the nitric oxide synthase {{inhibitor}} NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME) on vasoconstrictor responses to transmural <b>electrical</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>stimulation</b> and noradrenaline were examined in the rabbit isolated renal artery with and without an intact endothelium. In addition, the effect of removing the endothelium from the renal artery on vasoconstrictor responses to transmural <b>electrical</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>stimulation</b> and noradrenaline was also investigated. Immunohistofluorescence techniques were carried out {{to determine if there}} were any nitrergic nerves supplying the renal artery. The vasoconstriction produced in response to transmural <b>electrical</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>stimulation</b> (2 – 64 [*]Hz) was significantly enhanced in the presence of L-NAME (3 × 10 − 6, 10 − 5, 3 × 10 − 5 and 10 − 4 M). L-NAME (3 × 10 − 6, 10 − 5, 3 × 10 − 5 and 10 − 4 M) did not significantly affect the maximum vasoconstriction produced in response to noradrenaline. However, the noradrenaline dose-response curve was significantly shifted to the left by the addition of L-NAME (3 × 10 − 6, 10 − 5, 3 × 10 − 5 and 10 − 4 M). The increase in the amplitude of the vasoconstriction, produced in response to transmural <b>electrical</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>stimulation</b> (16 [*]Hz) and noradrenaline (10 − 5 [*]M) in the presence of L-NAME (10 − 5 [*]M) was not observed when L-arginine (10 − 3 [*]M) was added in addition to L-NAME (10 − 5 [*]M). Removing the endothelium did not significantly affect the response to transmural <b>electrical</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>stimulation</b> (1 – 64 [*]Hz). The maximum vasoconstriction in response to noradrenaline was also unaffected by the removal of the endothelium. The pD 2 value for noradrenaline obtained from vessels with no endothelium was significantly greater than the pD 2 value obtained from vessels with an intact endothelium (5. 90 ± 0. 11 and 5. 16 ± 0. 03, respectively). On renal artery segments with no endothelium L-NAME (3 × 10 − 5 [*]M) significantly enhanced the response to transmural <b>electrical</b> <b>nerve</b> <b>stimulation</b> (2 – 64 [*]Hz). L-NAME did not affect the maximum response to noradrenaline. However, there was a significant shift {{to the right of the}} noradrenaline dose-response curve in the presence of L-NAME (3 × 10 − 5 [*]M). Both nitric oxide synthase-containing and NADPH-diaphorase stained nerves were located on the adventitial-medial border of the rabbit renal artery. The present study has suggested a presynaptic inhibitory action for nitric oxide (probably derived from identified perivascular nitrergic nerves), on perivascular sympathetic vasoconstrictor nerve mediated responses of the rabbit renal artery. In contrast, the enhancement of the response to noradrenaline by L-NAME can be attributed to inhibition of the synthesis of endothelium-derived nitric oxide...|$|R
