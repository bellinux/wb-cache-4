500|$|The {{results of}} Gay's first 2004 US Olympic Trials {{confirmed}} {{his status as}} a rising contender in the 100m and 200m events. Although he did not reach the final of either event, he reached the semis of the highly competitive 100m and posted a 200m personal best of 20.07s in the qualifying stages. A hamstring injury due to dehydration prevented Gay from competing in the 200m final, but he did not see the trials as a missed opportunity, rather a springboard for future events: [...] "I was really focused upon the team, had a great shot, but it was a learning experience—how to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> body." [...] The end of year Track and Field News rankings for United States sprinters showed him to be the eighth fastest 100m runner and the fourth fastest sprinter over 200m that year—indicative of his potential, he was younger than all those ranked ahead of him.|$|E

[...] Her mother stayed with Poe until {{his own death}} in 1849. As Virginia was dying, the family {{received}} many visitors, including an old friend named Mary Starr. At one point Virginia put Starr's hand in Poe's {{and asked her to}} [...] "be a friend to Eddy, and don't forsake him". Virginia was tended to by 25-year-old Marie Louise Shew. Shew, who served as a nurse, knew medical care from her father and her husband, both doctors. She provided Virginia with a comforter as her only other cover was Poe's old military cloak, as well as bottles of wine, which the invalid drank [...] "smiling, even when difficult to get it down". Virginia also showed Poe a letter from Louisa Patterson, second wife of Poe's foster-father John Allan, which she had kept for years and which suggested that Patterson had purposely caused the break between Allan and Poe.|$|E

In October 2001, Rashad stated: [...] "It really boggles everyone [...] from Day One, every single video she ever shot there's always been myself or my mother or my father there. The circumstances surrounding this last video were really strange because my mother had eye surgery and couldn't fly. That really bothered her because she always traveled. My dad had to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mom at that time. And I went to Australia to visit some friends. We really couldn't understand why we weren't there. You ask yourself maybe we could have stopped it. But you can't really answer the question. There's always gonna be that question of why." [...] Her friend Kidada Jones said {{in the last year of}} her life her parents had given her more freedom and she had talked about wanting a family. [...] "She wanted to have a family, and we talked about how we couldn't wait to kick back with our babies." ...|$|E
500|$|Over {{the next}} several months, the ship was {{upgraded}} with the most advanced weaponry available; among the new weapons systems installed were four Mk 141 quad cell launchers for 16 RGM-84 Harpoon anti-ship missiles, eight Mk 143 Armored Box Launcher mounts for 32 BGM-109 Tomahawk cruise missiles, and a quartet of Phalanx Close In Weapon System Gatling guns for defense against enemy anti-ship missiles and enemy aircraft. Also included in her modernization were upgrades to radar and fire control systems for her guns and missiles, and improved electronic warfare capabilities. During the modernization Missouris [...] bell, which {{had been removed from}} the battleship and sent to Jefferson City, Missouri for sesquicentennial celebrations in the state, was formally returned to the battleship in advance of her recommissioning. Missouri was formally recommissioned in San Francisco on 10 May 1986. [...] "This is a day to celebrate the rebirth of American sea power," [...] Secretary of Defense Caspar Weinberger told an audience of 10,000 at the recommissioning ceremony, instructing the crew to [...] "listen for the footsteps of those who have gone before you. They speak to you of honor and the importance of duty. They remind you of your own traditions." [...] Also present at the recommissioning ceremony was Missouri governor John Ashcroft, U.S. Senator Pete Wilson, Secretary of the Navy John Lehman, San Francisco mayor Dianne Feinstein, and Margaret Truman, (who christened the ship in 1943) gave a short speech especially aimed at the ship's crew, which ended with [...] "now <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> baby". [...] Her remarks were met with rounds of sincere applause from the crew.|$|E
500|$|The action resumed the {{following}} morning, with Howe closing on the French and then cutting through their line. Bellerophon followed Howe's flagship, the 100-gun , and sustained some damage from French fire. Howe isolated several French {{ships in the}} rear and pounded them with broadsides, but Villaret de Joyeuse {{was able to bring}} his van about to rescue them, and the two fleets parted again at night to reform their battle lines and repair damage. Poor weather on 30 May and 31 May prevented the fleets from making contact, but {{the following}} day, 1 June, Howe was able to bring about a decisive action, later known as the Glorious First of June. The British approached in line abreast, with Bellerophon {{at the end of the}} line. As they approached, the ships were heavily cannonaded by the French. Pasley was hit in the leg by a cannonball as he stood on the quarterdeck, with Midshipman Matthew Flinders reporting that [...] "our brave admiral lost his leg by an 18-pounder shot which came in through the barricadoes of the quarter-deck– it was in the heat of the action." [...] When two seamen expressed their sorrow, Pasley replied [...] "Thank you, but never mind my leg: <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> flag." [...] He was taken below where the shattered leg was amputated. Captain Hope kept the ship in the engagement, pounding the 74-gun Éole until the French ship was forced out of the line. Bellerophon had by then lost all three topmasts, and her mainsail and lower shrouds had been cut to pieces. Hope then signalled the frigate [...] to tow the Bellerophon clear of the action. Despite being under heavy fire during the battle, Bellerophons casualties were comparatively light, amounting to four men killed and between twenty-seven and thirty wounded.|$|E

[...] His father says he knows how much pain his incarceration caused his son, but insists he did the best he could. [...] "I sent him {{to live with his}} grandmother," [...] he says. [...] "It wasn't like I left him with strangers." [...] In the absence of his father, boxing became an outlet for Mayweather. As the elder Mayweather served his time, his son put all of his energy into boxing and dropped out of high school. [...] "I knew that I {{was going to have to}} try to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> mom and I made the decision that school wasn't that important at the time and I was going to have to box to earn a living," [...] he said.|$|E
2500|$|Faut {{had mixed}} results in 1948, {{because she was}} forced to set aside from her teammates. Recently married, with a baby to care for, she began {{handling}} baseball like a professional job and could not socialize after games. As she recalled in an interview, [...] "I had to go home, <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> family, cook and clean, and all of those things". Nevertheless, in 1949 she recorded her best career season so far, considered by many historians to be the best individual season for any pitcher in AAGPBL history. Faut posted a 24–8 record with a 1.10 ERA in 34 games, allowing 47 runs (36 earned) on 136 hits and 118 walks, while striking out 120 in 261 innings of work. She led the league in wins and shutouts (12), finished second in innings and third in complete games (20). Only two pitchers gave up fewer earned runs, both of Rockford: Lois Florreich, who finished 22–7 with a 0.67 ERA in 269 innings, and Helen Nicol, who was 13–8 with a 0.98 ERA in 212 innings.|$|E

2500|$|Although Joe Budden and Raekwon {{reportedly}} were {{sat down}} and forced to settle things {{on the final day}} of the tour, Budden released a video on his website challenging Raekwon to a one-on-one fight, and called on all his fans to help persuade Raekwon to accept, despite the fact that it wasn't Raekwon who threw the punch. Raekwon however did not accept, and explained that he is a grown man with a family, and that fighting would be childish. He also stated [...] "This has never ever been a Wu-Tang versus Slaughterhouse thing, this is about a kid who gets off on doing blogs.

2500|$|Ould Taya, on his {{way back}} from Fahd's funeral, landed in Niamey, the capital of Niger. He met Niger's {{president}} Mamadou Tandja before going to a villa in Niamey. Speaking to Radio France Internationale on August 5, Ould Taya condemned the coup, saying that there had [...] "never been a more senseless coup in Africa" [...] and that it reminded him of the adage [...] "God save me from my friends, I'll <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> enemies". On August 8, he unsuccessfully attempted to order the armed forces to restore him to power. Broad support for the coup appeared to exist across the country; Ould Taya's own PRDS party abandoned him {{a few days after the}} coup by endorsing the new regime's transitional plan. International reaction to Ould Taya's overthrow was initially strongly hostile, including the suspension of Mauritania from the African Union, but after several days the new rulers were apparently diplomatically successful in winning tacit international acceptance of their transitional regime. The United States in particular at first called for Ould Taya to be restored to power but subsequently backed away from this.|$|E
2500|$|West {{was charged}} with violating Articles 128 (assault) and 134 (general article) of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. During a hearing held {{as part of an}} Article 32 {{investigation}} in November 2003, West stated, [...] "I know the method I used was not right, but I wanted to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> soldiers." [...] The charges were ultimately referred to an Article 15 proceeding rather than court-martial, at which West was fined $5,000. West accepted the judgment and retired with full benefits as a lieutenant colonel in the summer of 2004. Asked if he would act differently under similar circumstances, West testified, [...] "If it's about the lives of my soldiers at stake, I'd go through hell with a gasoline can." [...] At his hearing, West said that there were no ambushes against American forces in Taji until he was relieved of his leadership post a month later. After West's retirement he received more than 2,000 letters and e-mails offering him moral support. A letter supporting West was signed by 95 members of the U.S. Congress and sent to the Secretary of the Army.|$|E

2500|$|As {{had been}} the case with his {{teammate}} Ron Rightnowar, there was some bitterness toward Givens by the major-leaguers because of his role as a replacement player.

[...] "I had to pay my bills, and I couldn't see quitting not after what I've been through." [...] However, Givens also said given the chance to do it again, he would not have been a replacement player. [...] "Now that I'm here and I see how everything works, I regret what I did", Givens said in July 1995. [...] "I was really undecided and didn't want to do it, then I said I would. [...] One thing about this team, there's a bunch of really good guys here. [...] Maybe they're not all going to be our best friends off the field, but when we're on the field they're going to support us like we support them." [...] In a different interview, Givens went one step further, dismissing the talent level of some of his fellow replacement players. [...] "At the time, it's what I had to do", he told the Seattle Times in July 1995. [...] "I told everyone on the team that. [...] Of course, I regretted the decision. But I had to <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> family. [...] Those games were a joke. [...] The talent level was horrible.

2500|$|On December 16, 2013, Newsted {{expanded}} upon previous statements {{regarding his}} departure from Metallica and cited that his project with Echobrain was being discouraged by James Hetfield because Metallica's management at Q Prime {{wanted to go}} ahead with promoting Echobrain but was forced to drop it by Hetfield's demands with the quote [...] "other arrangements can be made". Jason was sure that Echobrain would not affect Metallica as it was the pedigree that it already needed. Newsted continues, “And so they had told me, pretty convincingly, ‘This is a great record, we’ve been playing it around the office, that’s all I’ve been hearing, it’s fantastic, this kid has a great voice. Let’s do something with this.’ That’s what they told me, and then James Hetfield heard about it and was not happy. He was, I think, pretty much out to put the kibosh on the whole thing because it would somehow affect Metallica in his eyes, because now the managers were interested in something I was doing {{that had nothing to do}} with him. ”The bassist sums up the situation as follows: “I have no idea what [...] was thinking, other than just protecting what he valued, just like he does; that's his thing. He protects what he loves, squeezes it too hard, like he said himself. Squeeze it too hard, protecting it too much. That's where I was coming from. The people that I had counted on for 15 years to help me with my career, help Metallica, <b>take</b> <b>care</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> money, do all of those things, told me, 'Your new project is fantastic, we'd like to help you with it.'
