In previous years, the bootblacks were allowed to shine boots and collect tickets at all times during the weekend.

This agreement was conceived to give the contestants the freedom to take time to enjoy the weekend without feeling the pressure to always be bootblacking.|$|E

NBC president Julian Goodman told his executives before <b>the</b> <b>weekend</b> <b>that</b> the well-sponsored, well-promoted film must start on time. NBC Sports executive producer Don [...] "Scotty" [...] Connal took care to tell the game producer, Don Ellis, that Heidi must start at 7:00 in the East, over Ellis' objection that he had been trained never to leave a game in progress. Connal told Ellis that NBC had sold the time, and was obligated to switch to the film.|$|E
