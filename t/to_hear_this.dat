I don't even know if this message is going to get to you because I don't know if they want you <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>this.</b> I'm getting a lot of negative feedback from certain corporate people. But I am not willing to give up.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{have often}} {{referred}} to Conroy as someone with strong ambition, {{with varying degrees of}} positive or negative opinion. Rumours circulated during and after his lifetime that he was perhaps the Duchess of Kent's lover. Queen Victoria was shocked <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>this,</b> stating that her mother's piety would have prevented it.|$|E
5|$|Gov. Schwarzenegger again {{appealed to}} the Supreme Court, looking to {{overturn}} the Ninth Circuit's ruling, filing a writ of certiorari to the Court in May 2009. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, at this point filed as Schwarzenegger v. Entertainment Merchants Ass'n. The fact that the Court accepted this case was considered surprising, based on the previous case record for such violent video game laws that were unanimously overturned in other states. Analysts believe that because the Court agreed <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>this</b> case, there are unanswered questions between the protection of free speech from the First Amendment, and the legal enforcement of protecting minors from unprotected free speech such as through restrictions on the sales of pornography to minors. Just a week prior to {{the acceptance of the}} certiorari, in United States v. Stevens the Court overturned another law that sought restrictions on depictions of animal cruelty, which some analysts felt would reflect the Court's position to likely overturn the violent video game law.|$|E

5|$|While Elaine is {{depressed}} {{about the}} low quality of her apartment, Jerry overhears Harold (Glenn Shadix) and Manny (Tony Plana), {{the managers of}} his apartment building, discussing a death that makes an apartment available. Shocked by the low rent, Jerry immediately tells Elaine {{that he will be}} able to get her the apartment above his. She is extremely excited <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>this,</b> as s{{he will be able to}} live near Jerry. Though excited at first, Jerry later realizes how intrusive Elaine might become, and that living with her might get annoying. He discusses his problem with George, but the topic of their conversation changes and they eventually talk about wearing a wedding ring to a party, to see how women will react. George dislikes the idea at first, but eventually borrows one from Jerry's neighbor Kramer (Michael Richards) to experiment.|$|E
25|$|The main {{character}} of the novel, Moorthy, is a young Brahmin who leaves {{for the city to}} study, where he becomes familiar with Gandhian philosophy. He begins living a Gandhian lifestyle, wearing home-spun khaddar and discarded foreign clothes and speaking out against the caste system. This causes the village priest to turn against Moorthy and excommunicate him. Heartbroken <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>this,</b> Moorthy's mother Narasamma dies. After this, Moorthy starts living with an educated widow, Rangamma, who is active in India’s independence movement.|$|E
25|$|Upon {{arrival in}} Storybrooke, Dr. Jekyll finds the town more {{beautiful}} than they described it to him; David and Mary Margaret take him to Granny's for a meal. Emma tells Hook she loves him, with both ready to take their relationship further. Henry prepares {{to say good-bye to}} Violet, believing she and her father, Sir Morgan, will return to Camelot. However, Violet reveals that while she was born in Camelot, her father is from Connecticut, but fell into a portal to Camelot at one point; thus they will remain in the Real World. Happy <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>this,</b> Henry shares a kiss with Violet.|$|E

25|$|Jochanaan {{emerges from}} the cistern and shouts prophecies {{regarding}} Herod and Herodias that no one understands, except Salome when the Prophet refers to her mother. Upon seeing Jochanaan, Salome is filled with an overwhelming desire for him, praising his white skin and asking to touch it, but he rejects her. She then praises his black hair, again asking to touch it, but is rejected once more. She finally begs for a kiss from Jochanaan's lips, and Narraboth, who cannot bear <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>this,</b> kills himself. As Jochanaan is returned to the well, he preaches salvation through the Messiah.|$|E
25|$|In March 2010, Kendall {{finds out}} Greenlee is alive when she {{shows up in}} Spain, where she and Zach are staying. Greenlee accuses Kendall of trying to kill her to get Ryan to herself. Kendall denies this, but Greenlee refuses <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>this</b> and leaves, not {{forgiving}} Kendall. In August 2010, Kendall comes back when Ryan is admitted to the hospital. She finds out Ryan is faking his prognosis because Greenlee, who is now married to David Hayward, is in trouble. Kendall initially doesn't want to get involved, but eventually decides to help Greenlee. Zach is close on her trail, and lets Kendall know he just wants her to be happy.|$|E
25|$|The {{ruling was}} {{appealed to the}} U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Denver, Colorado. On August 17, 2006, the Appeals Court upheld the FDA's ban of ephedra alkaloids, finding that the 133,000 page {{administrative}} record compiled by the FDA supported the agency's finding that ephedra alkaloids posed an unreasonable risk to consumers. Nutraceutical Corp. filed a petition for a writ of certiorari seeking a rehearing on the ban of ephedra alkaloids; however, on May 14, 2007 the United States Supreme Court declined <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>this</b> petition. The sale of ephedra alkaloids containing dietary supplements remains illegal in the United States. Sales of products containing ephedra extract not containing ephedrine remain legal.|$|E

25|$|During the trial, Taylor {{received}} {{a series of}} anonymous letters from a person claiming to be an officer who worked with Burge. The anonymous letters asserted that what happened to Wilson {{was part of a}} decades-old pattern of police torture, led by Burge, that victimized African-American detainees. These letters led Taylor and his colleagues to other alleged torture victims, but federal court trial Judge Brian Barnett Duff did not permit the jury <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>this</b> evidence; he held Taylor and Haas in contempt of court. After eight weeks of trial, the jury was unable to reach a verdict. The case was retried later in the year. After a second trial that lasted eight weeks, an all-white jury found Burge not guilty, but the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the verdict, based on ?. Eventually Wilson was awarded more than $1 million in attorney's fees and $100,000 in damages; the $100,000 went to the estate of the officers who were killed in 1982.|$|E
25|$|Governor Paterson's {{directive}} {{was challenged}} as both premature and unconstitutional in an Article 78 proceeding filed on June 3, 2008, against Governor Paterson by the Alliance Defense Fund {{on behalf of}} several state legislators and conservative leaders; this lawsuit failed at all levels. On September 2, 2008, Justice Lucy A. Billings, of the State Supreme Court in Bronx, New York, issued a decision that Governor Paterson acted within his powers when he required state agencies to recognize same-sex marriages from outside the state. Justice Billings found that the governor's order was consistent with state laws on the recognition of marriages from other jurisdictions. The Court of Appeals agreed <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>this</b> and another case on same-sex marriage recognition in 2009. The Court decided these cases on narrow grounds, finding that the state acted within its authority without reaching the issue of marriage recognition; however, a three-justice minority would have ruled more broadly in support of marriage recognition.|$|E

500|$|James Keates {{claimed the}} reward, but his conduct was widely criticised. The Perth Gazette {{referred}} to Yagan's killing as [...] "a wild and treacherous act... it is revolting <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>this</b> lauded as a meritorious deed." [...] However, Daisy Bates understood that [...] "he {{was killed in}} self-defence by the young lad." [...] Keates left the colony the following month; {{it is possible that}} he left from fear of being murdered in tribal retaliation.|$|E
500|$|The {{recording}} sessions {{served as}} the first production credit for Scott-Heron, Jackson, and Jose Williams. As the third unofficial collaboration between Scott-Heron and Jackson, the album's recording featured more of Jackson's input than before. Jackson recounted the experience in an interview for All About Jazz, stating [...] "He had this way with words and I thought to myself, 'People have <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>this</b> stuff'. What I had to offer was the music and I figured if we can take his words and make this tribal knowledge rhythmic and musical, we can draw people to hear it." ...|$|E
500|$|Parliamentary {{sovereignty}} is no longer, {{if it ever}} was, absolute ... It is no longer {{right to say that}} its freedom to legislate admits of no qualification whatever. Step by step, gradually but surely, the English principle of the absolute legislative sovereignty of Parliament ... is being qualified ... The rule of law enforced by the courts is the ultimate controlling factor on which our constitution is based. The fact that your Lordships have been willing <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>this</b> appeal and to give judgment upon it is another indication that the courts have a part to play in defining the limits of Parliament's legislative sovereignty.|$|E

500|$|When Burge {{took the}} stand on March 13, 1989, he denied that he injured Andrew Wilson during {{questioning}} and denied any knowledge of any such activity by other officers. Wilson's legal team, led by G. Flint Taylor of the People's Law Office, received anonymous letters during the trial from a person claiming to be an officer who worked with Burge. This person alleged that the Wilson case {{was part of a}} larger pattern of police torture of African-American suspects, which was sanctioned by Burge. U.S. District Judge Brian Barnett Duff did not permit the jury <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>this</b> anonymous evidence.|$|E
500|$|The {{criminal}} case, to {{be heard}} in the Queen's Bench, was listed as Regina v. Castro, the name Castro being the last uncontested alias of the Claimant. Because of its expected length, the case was scheduled as a [...] "trial at bar", a device that allowed a panel rather than a single judge to hear it. The president of the panel was Sir Alexander Cockburn, the Lord Chief Justice. His decision <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>this</b> case was controversial, since during the civil case he had publicly denounced the Claimant as a perjurer and a slanderer. Cockburn's co-judges were Sir John Mellor and Sir Robert Lush, both experienced Queen's Bench justices.|$|E
500|$|Mark Edwards of Stylus Magazine {{opined that}} [...] "The Holy Bible is easily {{one of the}} best albums of the 90s—ignored by many, but loved {{intensely}} by the few who've lived with it over the years [...] It puts everything the Manics have done since to shame, not to mention nearly everything else [...] ". Nick Butler of Sputnikmusic dubbed it a [...] "classic" [...] and concluded: [...] "Punk, hard rock, indie, and even metal fans owe it to themselves <b>to</b> <b>hear</b> <b>this.</b> Anyone else may be scared off, but may just find they never look at life the same way again.
