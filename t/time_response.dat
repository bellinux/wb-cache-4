25|$|Thermal {{magnetic}} circuit breakers, {{which are the}} type found in most distribution boards, incorporate both techniques with the electromagnet responding instantaneously to large surges in current (short circuits) and the bimetallic strip responding to less extreme but longer-term over-current conditions. The thermal portion of the circuit breaker provides a <b>time</b> <b>response</b> feature, that trips the circuit breaker sooner for larger overcurrents but allows smaller overloads to persist for a longer time. This allows short current spikes such as are produced when a motor or other non-resistive load is switched on. With very large over-currents during a short-circuit, the magnetic element trips the circuit breaker with no intentional additional delay.|$|E

25|$|Viscoelastic creep {{data can}} be {{presented}} {{in one of two}} ways. Total strain can be plotted as a function of time for a given temperature or temperatures. Below a critical value of applied stress, a material may exhibit linear viscoelasticity. Above this critical stress, the creep rate grows disproportionately faster. The second way of graphically presenting viscoelastic creep in a material is by plotting the creep modulus (constant applied stress divided by total strain at a particular time) as a function of time. Below its critical stress, the viscoelastic creep modulus is independent of stress applied. A family of curves describing strain versus <b>time</b> <b>response</b> to various applied stress may be represented by a single viscoelastic creep modulus versus time curve if the applied stresses are below the material's critical stress value.|$|E

It was predicted that increase in <b>response</b> <b>time</b> would affect total transaction volume and total errors adversely, that is, total transaction volume would decrease with longer <b>response</b> <b>times</b> and total errors would increase. Total productive transactions, the difference between total transactions and total errors, was expected to decrease as <b>response</b> <b>time</b> increased.
