The main characters are seven young Americans from different social and ethnic backgrounds, all living in Los Angeles. The story {{takes place in}} the aftermath of the earthquake in Los Angeles in 1994.|$|E
500|$|Watkins {{remembers the}} first time they saw the group: [...] "I saw Mark Fox. And <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> these little girls {{skipping}} and running around. And they looked about thirteen. This can't be them. No way!". Nevertheless, the Spice Girls managed to impress them. They played a few of their tracks, but neither Watkins nor Wilson particularly like them, except for a song the group wrote with Richard Stannard and Matt Rowe, called [...] "Feed Your Love", which the duo thought was [...] "dark and cool". A songwriting session was booked within the next days.|$|E
500|$|For {{causing the}} {{collision}} with Will Stevens, Romain Grosjean was given two penalty points on his FIA Super Licence and {{said after the}} race: [...] "I thought I was past the Manor, but it was soon clear that I wasn't. It was my fault entirely and I apologise for it. You never stop learning as a driver." [...] Meanwhile, Sebastian Vettel insisted that [...] "it was fairly clear [...] When I got close enough I went around the outside, braking later and still managing to get the corner. I was clearly ahead and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him opening the brakes into {{the last part of}} the chicane, so I reacted and jumped the second part because if I started on the track, we would have crashed." [...] Nico Hülkenberg in turn declared that Vettel [...] "didn't leave me anywhere to go so to avoid contact I kept braking, lost the rear and spun". He did however voice satisfaction with his result, finishing eighth and taking four championship points.|$|E
6000|$|... "And shamefully you behaved there," [...] said Mrs. Proudie; [...] "most shamefully. I {{was wrong}} {{to allow you to}} remain in the house a day after what <b>I</b> <b>then</b> <b>saw.</b> <b>I</b> should have insisted on your instant dismissal." ...|$|R

500|$|After a minute, Sirhan {{wrestled}} {{free and}} grabbed the revolver again, but he had already fired all the bullets and was subdued. [...] Barry went to Kennedy and laid his jacket under the candidate's head, later recalling: [...] "I knew immediately it was a [...]22, a small caliber, so I hoped it wouldn't be so bad, but <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> {{the hole in the}} Senator's head, and I knew". Reporters and photographers rushed into the area from both directions, contributing to the confusion and chaos. As Kennedy lay wounded, Juan Romero cradled the senator's head and placed a rosary in his hand. Kennedy asked Romero, [...] "Is everybody OK?" [...] and Romero responded, [...] "Yes, everybody's OK." [...] Kennedy then turned away from Romero and said, [...] "Everything's going to be OK." [...] Captured by Life photographer Bill Eppridge and Boris Yaro of the Los Angeles Times, this moment became the iconic image of the assassination. There was some initial confusion in who was shot, one witness believing that the primary victim was Kennedy's campaign manager, Stephen Edward Smith. This was quickly realized to be untrue.|$|E
500|$|I saw the boy getting {{injured in}} his leg, {{and the father}} asking for help. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him getting injured in his arm, the father. The father was asking the {{ambulances}} to help him, because {{he could see the}} ambulances. I cannot see the ambulance... I wasn't far away, maybe from them [...] face to face about 15 meters, 17 meters. But the father didn't succeed to get the ambulance by waving to them. He looked at me and he said, [...] "Help me." [...] I said, [...] "I cannot, I can't help you." [...] The shooting till then was really heavy... It was really raining bullets, for more than for 45minutes. Then... I hear something, [...] "boom!" [...] Really is coming with a lot of dust. I looked at the boy, I filmed the boy lying down in the father's lap, and the father really, getting really injured, and he was really dizzy. I said, [...] "Oh my god, the boy's got killed, the boy's got killed," [...] I was screaming, I was losing my mind. While I was filming, the boy got killed... I was very afraid, I was very upset, I was crying, and I was remembering my children.... This was the most terrible thing that has happened to me as a journalist.|$|E
500|$|Henning Solberg, meanwhile, {{went off}} the road and into a ditch as he entered one of the corners on the stage, and his brother Petter had a similar problem in the same corner, but his quick {{reactions}} were able to control the car so he just drove into the scrub and got back on track. Henning finished in seventeenth place, and Petter finished joint-fifth with Cuoq on [...] Loeb ran his slowest time on this stage after he reduced speed and his tyres went cold. [...] "I was a bit faster than Dani [...] on the start of the stage, and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> my splits [...] and then I tried to slow down," [...] he explained. [...] "We had hard tyres and when you slow down the tyres [...] and then you lose the grip more and more, and at the end it was really tricky and I had cold tyres, so I just tried to slow down. The end [...] was really tricky so I didn't want to take any risks." [...] was won by Hirvonen with a time of [...] Loeb was 1.2s slower and finished second. Atkinson lost all the time he made up in [...] by finishing in eighth place, [...] slower than Hirvonen. This reduced the gap between the two in the overall classifications to just [...] Sordo, meanwhile, had his worst stage and finished in [...]|$|E
60|$|Just <b>then</b> Sam pointed. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> a {{sailfish}} break water {{a hundred}} yards away.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> {{for once}} <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Bes grow afraid, for his great jaw dropped and he trembled.|$|R
60|$|He moved a {{few steps}} towards them, and <b>then</b> paused. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> {{that my father was}} leaning forward, and in his shaking hand was a tiny gleaming revolver. A certain desperate courage seemed to have come to him.|$|R
500|$|Villeneuve {{was joined}} by Jody Scheckter in 1979 after Carlos Reutemann moved to Lotus. Villeneuve won three races during the year and even briefly led the {{championship}} after winning back to back races in USA and South Africa. However, the season is mostly remembered for Villeneuve's wheel-banging duel with René Arnoux in the last laps of the 1979 French Grand Prix. Arnoux passed Villeneuve for second place with three laps to go, but Villeneuve re-passed him on the next lap. On the final lap Arnoux attempted to pass Villeneuve again, and the pair ran side-by-side through the first few corners of the lap, making contact several times. Arnoux took the position but Villeneuve attempted an outside pass one corner later. The cars bumped hard, Villeneuve slid wide but then passed Arnoux on the inside at a hairpin turn and held him off for {{the last half of}} the lap to secure second place. Villeneuve commented afterwards, [...] "I tell you, that was really fun! I thought for sure we were going to get on our heads, you know, because when you start interlocking wheels it's very easy for one car to climb over another." [...] At the Dutch Grand Prix a slow puncture collapsed Villeneuve's left rear tyre and put him off the track. He returned to the circuit and limped back to the pits on three wheels, losing the damaged wheel on the way. On his return to the pits Villeneuve insisted that the team replace the missing wheel, and had to be persuaded that the car was beyond repair. Villeneuve might have won the World Championship by ignoring team orders to beat Scheckter at the Italian Grand Prix, but chose to finish behind him, ending his own championship challenge. The pair finished first and second in the championship, with Scheckter beating Villeneuve by just four points. During the extremely wet Friday practice session for the season-ending United States Grand Prix, Villeneuve set a time variously reported to be either 9 or 11 seconds faster than any other driver. His teammate Jody Scheckter, who was second fastest, recalled that [...] "I scared myself rigid that day. I thought I had to be quickest. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> Gilles's time and — I still don't really understand how it was possible. Eleven seconds!" ...|$|E

2500|$|All I {{can tell}} you is that it {{completely}} and utterly changed my life. I was a white hippie boy and <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> exit wounds from M1 rifles out of the backs of two people I knew.|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{was making}} for Chesterfield Walk,” Mrs Verloc heard her husband’s voice, “when I heard the bang. <b>I</b> started running <b>then.</b> Fog. <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> no one till I was past {{the end of}} George Street. Don’t think I met anyone till then.” ...|$|R
60|$|And <b>then,</b> as <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> {{some of the}} old {{soldiers}} laughing, I {{began to}} understand that this man was trying to frighten us; so I began to laugh also, and the others as well, {{but it was not a}} very hearty laugh either.|$|R
6000|$|... "Upon my word <b>then,</b> <b>I</b> never <b>saw</b> {{a fellow}} so changed in my life. He and I were like brothers, {{but he would}} hardly speak to me. Perhaps I ought to have written to him. But he says it's not settled." ...|$|R
2500|$|<b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> another angel {{flying in}} midair, {{and he had}} the eternal gospel to {{proclaim}} to those who live on the earth—to every nation, tribe, language and people.

2500|$|... …I was {{standing}} upstairs when I heard {{some sort of}} growing noise, <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the corrugated turbine cover rise and stand on end. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> the rotor rising from underneath it. It was spinning. I could not believe my eyes. It rose about three meters. Rocks and pieces of metal went flying, we started to dodge them… At that point the corrugated cover was nearly at roof level, and the roof itself had been destroyed… I made a mental calculation: the water is rising, 380 cubic meters per second, so I took to my heels {{and ran for the}} № 10 turbine. I thought that I wouldn't make it, I climbed higher, stopped, looked down, and saw everything getting destroyed, water coming in, people trying to swim… I thought: someone must urgently shut the gates to stop the water, manually… Manually, because there was no power, none of the protection systems had worked… ...|$|E
2500|$|Then Australian coach Bob Dwyer's first {{exposure}} to Campese {{was at an}} Australian under 21s game against [...] Dwyer wrote in his autobiography The Winning Way that, [...] "A few months earlier Campese had played for the Australian under-21s against the Fijian under-21s in a curtain-raiser to the first Test against Scotland in Brisbane, and he had cut the Fijian defence to shreds. I asked at once {{who he was and}} was told he was a rising star in the Canberra competition. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him play a second time in the curtain-raiser to the second Test, and again he was brilliant in attack." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So was I," [...] he said, [...] "for a bit. <b>Then,</b> when <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> {{that it was}} all a rag, I {{began to}} look about for ways of doing the thing really well. I emptied about six jugs of water on a gang of kids under my window." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{had been}} furious. She showed passion--hate. Then {{all in a}} second {{something}} wonderful, beautiful broke through. Pity, fear, agonized thought of your death!

60|$|I {{came out}} again into Fleet Street at night, {{and by a}} dim lamp <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> pasted up some tawdry {{nonsense}} about Wastrels and how London was rising against something that London had hardly heard of. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> suddenly <b>saw,</b> as in one obvious picture, that the modern world is an immense and tumultuous ocean, full of monstrous and living things. And <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> that {{across the top of}} it is spread a thin, a very thin, sheet of ice, of wicked wealth and of lying journalism.|$|R
2500|$|... "We {{picked up}} the girls {{and went to the}} beach. I had a shot behind the shed. While the girls were {{drinking}} I was trying to OD. We drove around with them. I was asleep most the time. Beckett told me he dropped them off at home. I remember waking up and seeing the girls and then later I asked Beckett where we were and he said Victoria, on the main road somewhere. And I went off my head. I told him to go home, {{get the fuck out of}} here. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him walking out of the bush. He had blood all over him. Told me he cut his finger." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{saw that}} he had short hair, cut short, I thought; and I {{suddenly}} realized that his neck was oddly leathery and extremely filthy. [...] "That chap's got a very dirty and wrinkled neck!" [...] I said to myself. His body was as large as a medium-sized native's and he had thick square shoulders, not sloping at all... he seemed to be quite as tall as I. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> {{that it was not a}} man. It was not an orang-utan. I had seen one of these large apes a short time before. It was more like a monstrously large siamang, but a siamang has long hair, and there was no doubt that it had short hair.|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, they {{released}} an EP titled 5 Tracks Deep. It {{sold more than}} 1,000 copies in its first month of release. In 1999, they produced another EP, which would end up being their last independent release, titled Let 'Em Know. Its success {{caught the attention of}} Warner Music Group, who as part of a development deal provided a small amount of money for the production of a five-track promo-demo CD. The band decided they wanted influential rock producer Jay Baumgardner on board to produce the record. In an interview with HitQuarters, Baumgardner said, “At first I wasn’t really convinced it would work out, but <b>then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> a video of them performing at a club - I saw all these kids going wild, knowing the songs by heart - and that’s when I realized that they definitely had potential.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Love {{makes us}} hypocrites, I fear, my Ferdinand; for, a moment before, I was so wearied that I {{was lying on}} my sofa quite wretched.

6000|$|... "I couldn't," [...] he said gently. [...] "It {{was perhaps}} worth very little; {{but it was}} all I had, and--since that day by the river--I never asked for {{anything}} in return.

60|$|Then {{all at once}} {{a strange}} thing happened. The scowl went right off his face and the anger out of his eyes.

2500|$|Influenced {{by their}} mother's own dreams of stardom, {{he and his}} brothers, Kenneth and Glenn, were child actors on {{television}} in the 1950s. [...] At age 15, when a girlfriend showed him a [...] magazine photo of Elvis, Walken said, [...] "This guy looked like a Greek god. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him on television. I loved everything about him." [...] He changed his hairstyle to imitate Elvis and hasn't changed it since (Robert Schnakenberg (2008). [...] "Christopher Walken A to Z".). As a teenager, {{he worked as a}} lion tamer in a circus. Walken went to Hofstra University, but dropped out after one year, having gotten the role of Clayton Dutch Miller in an Off-Broadway revival of Best Foot Forward, co-starring with Liza Minnelli, who played Ethel Hofflinger. Walken initially trained as a dancer in music theatre at the Washington Dance Studio before moving on to dramatic roles in theatre and then film.|$|E
2500|$|Jack Seely was {{featured}} in the HBO film Into the Storm in 2009. [...] At {{the end of the}} film Churchill reads a sympathetic post-election note from his old friend Jack Seely: [...] "I feel our world slipping away." [...] Churchill thinks back: [...] "I met him in South Africa, riding across the veldt. He was Col. Seely <b>then.</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> him at the head of a column of British cavalry, riding twenty yards in front, on a black horse. I thought of him as the very symbol of British Imperial power." [...] The Testimony Films 2012 documentary War Horse: The Real Story contained extensive discussion of the First World War service of Seely and his widely revered horse, Warrior. Warrior was adopted as his formation's mascot and had a reputation for bravery under fire. Warrior survived the war, dying in 1941 at the age of 33. In September 2014, the horse was posthumously awarded an honorary PDSA Dickin Medal for bravery.|$|E
2500|$|Wong {{descended from}} the rooftop to the street, where he got {{into his car and}} drove quickly toward the ruined railway station. When he arrived, he noted carnage and confusion: [...] "It was a horrible sight. People were still trying to get up. Dead and injured lay strewn across the tracks and platform. Limbs lay all over the place. Only my work helped me forget what I was seeing. I stopped to reload my camera. I noticed that my shoes were soaked with blood. I walked across the railway tracks, and made many long scenes with the burning {{overhead}} bridge in the background. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> a man pick up a baby from the tracks and carry him to the platform. He went back to get another badly injured child. The mother lay dead on the tracks. As I filmed this tragedy, I heard the sound of planes returning. Quickly, I shot my remaining few feet [...] on the baby. I ran toward the child, intending to carry him to safety, but the father returned. The bombers passed overhead. No bombs were dropped." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'The game, pardie, {{was full}} in sight, [...] That <b>then</b> did, if <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> aright, [...] 165 [...] The fair dame's eyes engage; [...] For turning, as I took my ways, [...] <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> them fix'd with steadfast gaze [...] Full on her wanton page.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was about}} sixteen <b>then,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>I</b> {{had to make}} out differently," [...] he said. [...] "Well, somehow I've done it--looked on this life as a battle where the hurt man gets no mercy, and I've cleared quite a little money on my royalties--but now and then the memory of those old days on the ranch comes back to me. <b>Then</b> <b>I</b> feel that if ever it's {{necessary}} {{for me to get}} my knife into any kind of mortgage man, it will be red right to the hilt when it comes out again." ...|$|R
