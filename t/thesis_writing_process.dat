40|$|Advanced {{academic}} literacy often {{underscores the}} role of faculty as supervisors and examiners in research and <b>thesis</b> <b>writing</b> <b>processes.</b> Academic editors are unfortunately often not mentioned in these socialization processes. The aim {{of this paper is}} to underscore {{the role of}} this group of professionals in advanced academic literacy, as it particularly pertains to graduate research writing. I draw on my experiences in offering editorial services to graduate research students in English-medium universities. In doing this, I am guided mainly by my experiences and observation, rather than the theoretical perspectives that inform advanced academic literacy. In this paper I touch briefly on the requirements of research writing and present my brief profile and that of my clients (graduate students). This is followed by a description of my modus operandi in editing the research writing of students. The difficulties graduate students encounter in writing their research are then discussed. The paper concludes with the implications of my findings for the role of academic editors, advanced academic literacy, and graduate research supervision.

40|$|December 2008 ". Thesis (DAppLing) [...] Macquarie University, Division of Linguistics and Psychology, Dept. of Linguistics, 2009. Bibliography: p. 299 - 327. Introduction [...] Literature review [...] Study 1 [...] Study 2 [...] Conclusions. The aim of {{this case}} study was to {{identify}} the beliefs of eight pre-service teachers about <b>thesis</b> <b>writing</b> and professional development while and after <b>writing</b> their BA <b>thesis</b> through diary and survey inquiry. This research was conducted in the teaching area of the major in Modern Languages (LEMO) from the Autonomous University of Puebla (BUAP). The methodology used to identify trainee beliefs was applied in two periods: during the process to include reflection in action, and after the process obtaining reflection on action as suggested by Schön (1983, p. 26). Thus, the participants wrote their electronic dialogue diaries while taking the two Research Seminars and <b>writing</b> their <b>thesis.</b> In this diaries they expressed their thoughts and feelings, sent them to the teacher and the teacher answered them also via e-mail. Then, when the Research Seminars had finished, they answered the questionnaire called Thesis and Professional Development Questionnaire (TAPDQ), which was especially designed for this research taking insights from Eraut (1995), Fullan(1995), Burns et al (1999), Schmekes (2004) and Viaggio (1992). This questionnaire contains Likert scales and some open questions. The findings of these studies reveal that participants were aware of their lack of expertise in <b>thesis</b> <b>writing</b> and they looked for strategies to overcome this problem. Also, the findings suggest that the participants were benefited from the constructivist methodology employed in the Research Seminars. Most of the participants reported having acquired skills, knowledge, having improved their attitude and having become better students after <b>writing</b> their <b>thesis.</b> This doctoral thesis begins exploring an area that has not been explored on ELT teacher cognition at least as reported in the research reviews done by Borg (2003, 2006) and Reyes & Rodríguez (2007). It aims to contribute to get a better understanding the <b>thesis</b> <b>writing</b> <b>processes</b> in teacher education programmes in public universities in Mexico.

40|$|A thesis {{submitted}} to the University of Bedfordshire in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Masters of Arts by ResearchThis Masters of Arts thesis comprises a novel, Slated, and contextualizing thesis. Slated, a young adult dystopian novel, is Kyla’s story: a sixteen-year-old girl who has been Slated, her memory wiped as punishment for crimes she cannot remember. It {{is set in a}} future England, a society where underage criminals and terrorists are given a so-called second chance with Slating, a new life and family. The <b>thesis</b> considers the <b>writing</b> <b>process</b> of Slated in the context of terrorism and cultural trauma, and the use of creative writing in translating trauma. The definition of terrorism and whether it includes freedom fighters is considered, both in international law and its treatment in dystopian young adult fiction, and the conclusion reached that whether terrorists are considered to be freedom fighters is largely a matter of perspective. The genre of recent dystopian young adult fiction is examined, and how Slated fits within it and within dystopian fiction more generally considered. Finally, the impact of the analysis of terrorism and young adult dystopian fiction on the <b>writing</b> <b>process</b> of Slated is examined...|$|R

40|$|The {{writer of}} this <b>thesis</b> <b>writes</b> about Mowgli's <b>process</b> of searching his own {{identity}} in Rudyard Kipling's The jungle Books. Rudyard Kipling's The Tungle Books contains several {{stories about the}} jungle inhabitants in the Wainganga's riverbank, {{but most of the}} stories relate to an Indian's boy, Mowgli. Mowgli is a boy who is raised by the jungle's beast in the Wainganga's riverbank. He grows up among the jungle's beasts and fights to survive against the harsh of jungle nature and his enemy Shere-Khan. This character also must pass through conflicts against himself and his own kinds until he finally learns to accept his true identity as a human being. In analyzing Mowgli's story the thesis writer uses theory of character and conflict, which are applied as literary approach, he also uses theory of self-identity and theory of relation between self-identity with social-group as supporting data in order to support his analysis. Besides that, the purpose of <b>writing</b> this <b>thesis</b> is to reveal the main character's development in finding his own identity and also to reveal his obstacles and his supports in finding his own identity...|$|R

40|$|Basically, <b>thesis</b> <b>writing</b> {{as a final}} {{project is}} a great task and very complex <b>process.</b> <b>Writing</b> a <b>thesis</b> needs {{preparation}} of developing skills, reading extensively, and paying attention to language. In fact, many students have difficulties in <b>writing</b> a <b>thesis.</b> Thus, the students need more appropriate strategies {{to help them understand}} and succeed in learning it. Learning strategies is the specific actions, behaviors, steps or techniques that students used to comprehend, learn, retain new information and regulate their efforts to make the learning easier, faster, more enjoyable, more self directed, more effective and more transferable to new situations. The {{purpose of this study is}} to know the kinds of learning strategies used by high achiever students in <b>thesis</b> <b>writing</b> subject and the dominant strategies used in <b>thesis</b> <b>writing</b> subject. The design used was descriptive qualitative research design because the writer wanted to describe the strategies employed by the high achiever students in <b>thesis</b> <b>writing</b> subject. The respondent who were investigated were the eight semester students of English Department of University of Muhammadiyah Malang in academic year 20072008 who achieved grade A in <b>thesis</b> <b>writing</b> subject. They were selected because the eight semester students had finished taking a <b>thesis</b> <b>writing</b> subject. The total number of students was 26. Afterward, they were given the questionnaire on learning strategies. After collecting and analyzing the data, the writer found that the high achiever students employed all the strategies. Rarely the mean score of metacognitive was 77. The second strategy was memory strategy, with the mean score of 75. Meanwhile, cognitive strategy was the third strategy with the mean score of 74. 75. The fourth strategy was affective strategy with score 72, followed by social strategy with score 70. 7. The lowest strategy used by the students was compensation strategy with score 49.
