5|$|The Two Swords {{peaked at}} #4 on the New York Times Best Seller list in 2004. It reached the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> Street Journals {{hardcover}} bestseller list after only two weeks, {{a record for}} its publisher Wizards of the Coast. It also debuted at #4 on The New York Times's bestseller list and #2 on Publisher's Weekly bestseller list.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{the temple}} {{building}} proper was the temple enclosure, {{surrounded by a}} rectangular brick wall that symbolically protected the sacred space from outside disorder. On occasion this function was more than symbolic, especially during the last native dynasties {{in the fourth century}} BC, when the walls were fully fortified in case of Persian invasion. In late temples these walls frequently had alternating concave and convex courses of bricks, so that the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> undulated vertically. This pattern may have been meant to evoke the mythological waters of chaos.|$|E
5|$|To {{film the}} scenes at the Wall the {{production}} built a {{set on the}} abandoned quarry of Magheramorne, a few minutes north of Belfast. The composite set (with both exteriors and interiors) consisted of a large section of Castle Black including the courtyard, the ravenry, the mess hall and the barracks, and used the stone wall of the quarry {{as the basis for}} the ice wall that protects Westeros from the dangers that dwell beyond. They also made a real elevator to lift the rangers to the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall.</b>|$|E
25|$|At its simplest, a {{defensive}} wall {{consists of a}} wall enclosure and its gates. For the most part, <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> were accessible, with <b>the</b> outside <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> having tall parapets with embrasures or merlons. North <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Alps, this passageway at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> occasionally had a roof.|$|R

5|$|The {{start of}} the game was {{postponed}} 80 minutes due to a rain delay, pushing the start time to 9:17p.m. The cast of the television series Glee (with Amber Riley singing lead) performed the national anthem prior to the game {{as part of a}} ceremony featuring a large American flag and several members of the armed services. The Phillies scored first with Jayson Werth's lead-off solo home run, which was followed by a bases-loaded walk and a sacrifice fly to make the score 3–0 {{in the bottom of the}} second inning. Following Mark Teixeira's walk in the top of the fourth inning, Alex Rodriguez hit a deep ball down the right field line. It was originally ruled a double and Teixeira held at third base. The play was reviewed using MLB instant replay, which revealed that the ball had struck a camera sticking over the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> and the ball was ruled a two-run home run, giving Rodriguez his first World Series hit. This was the first home run reviewed by instant replay in postseason play. Specifically, the ball hit a camera owned by Fox and MLB which extended slightly over the right field wall. The camera was moved back for Game4 such that its lens was in line with the wall. Coincidentally, Alex Rodriguez also had the first regular season home run reviewed by replay.|$|E

25|$|The {{upper section}} of Charles V Wall, {{somewhat}} further south, {{runs from the}} top of a cliff up to the crest of The Rock. It zigzags up the slope of The Rock in four stages in a configuration that lets the defenders give flanking fire to each face. The Hacho (later the Signal Station) at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> was once equipped with a small tower.|$|E

25|$|On June 19, Instant replay {{was used}} {{twice in the}} Tigers' 10-4 victory over the Milwaukee Brewers at Comerica Park, the first time that's {{happened}} in league history. Miguel Cabrera's third-inning single off the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> is called a home run after instant replay review shows that it had actually cleared the wall. Contrarily, Dusty Ryan's fourth-inning home run was overturned to a ground rule double. Later that weekend, the Tigers won the series with a sweep.|$|E
25|$|Lateral earth {{pressures}} are zero at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> and – in homogenous ground – increase proportionally {{to a maximum}} value at the lowest depth. Earth pressures will push the wall forward or overturn it if not properly addressed. Also, any groundwater behind the wall that is not dissipated by a drainage system causes hydrostatic pressure on the wall. The total pressure or thrust may be assumed to act at one-third from the lowest depth for lengthwise stretches of uniform height.|$|E
25|$|Eventually, Union {{soldiers}} {{found the}} uncompleted short trench {{in back of}} the fort which allowed them an easier opportunity to climb onto the fort's parapet. The mass of men in the ditch had to move or be killed so they started to scale the walls or rushed around the moat to find the unfinished trench or sally port in the rear. Attackers were able to gain entry to the fort from the rear {{at the same time that}} a large number of Union troops finally managed to gain the top of the parapet. Soldiers of the 12th West Virginia Infantry Regiment were reported to be the first to cross into the fort after their flag had been planted at the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b> After several bayonet charges, the Union attackers finally carried the works by sheer force of numbers and, after desperate hand-to-hand combat, forced the surviving defenders to surrender.|$|E

25|$|The tower {{has been}} subject {{to a series of}} {{modifications}} over the centuries. The lower two floors were completed by 1302 while the third floor was added in around 1350. The watchtower was added in the 15th or 16th century, and in the 18th century some of the openings were blocked up. In addition, there have been changes as result of the restoration work in the 20th century. Areas of protruding stonework on the north and east sides the tower appear to be the remains of the bonding of a defensive curtain wall. On the east side there is a doorway that may have provided access to a walkway along the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall,</b> while on the north side a similar doorway has been blocked up, presumably at an early date, and fitted with an arrowslit. There is no evidence that a curtain wall at these positions was ever actually constructed and {{it is possible that the}} wall formed part of an original plan that was never realized. On the west wall of the tower there are two blocked doorways connecting to the spiral staircase. These are likely to have been used to access garderobes (latrines).|$|E
25|$|After Ryan {{was sentenced}} to Pentridge Prison, he was placed in B Division where he met fellow {{prisoner}} Peter John Walker (who was serving a 12-year sentence for bank robbery). When Ryan was informed {{that his wife was}} seeking a divorce, he made a plan to escape from prison. Walker decided to go along with him. Ryan planned to take himself and his family and flee to Brazil, which did not have an extradition treaty with Australia. At around 2:07pm on Sunday, 19 December 1965, Ryan and Walker put the escape plan into effect. As prison officers were taking turns attending a staff Christmas party in the officers' mess hall, Ryan and Walker scaled a five-metre prison wall with the aid of two wooden benches, a hook and blankets. Running along the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> to a prison watch tower, they overpowered prison warder Helmut Lange and took his M1 carbine rifle. Ryan threatened Lange and demanded he pull the lever to open the prison tower gate. Lange, however, deliberately pulled the wrong lever. Ryan, Walker and Lange then proceeded down the steps to the tower gate, but it would not open. At {{the bottom of the stairs}} was the night officers' lodge. Warder Fred Brown was returning from lunch to relieve Lange when he was confronted by the escapees. Brown did not resist. When Ryan realised Lange had tricked him, he jabbed the rifle into Lange's back and marched him back up the stairs so Lange could pull the correct lever to open the tower gate. The two escapees then exited through the gate into the prison car park. To the escapees' dismay there were only two cars in the car park and one had a flat tyre.|$|E
500|$|The {{curtain wall}} is [...] thick, and [...] high. A walkway along the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> is {{protected}} by parapets on both sides, and is carried over the pitched roofs of the hall and gatehouse by steep steps. Open, round turrets are located at each corner, with semicircular projections at the midpoint of each wall. A square turret with machicolations is located above the postern gate in the west wall.|$|E
5000|$|In 1905-06, <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> were secured and {{partially}} rebuilt. After <b>the</b> <b>tops</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> were secured in 1961/63, further restoration finally began in 1986; this has continued sporadically since.|$|R
50|$|The curtain between Montagu and the Chatham Counterguard was {{breached}} {{to allow}} access for new apartments. A relatively modern commercial building now sits on <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> counterguard.|$|R

500|$|The walls {{themselves}} are around [...] thick. However, {{because they are}} dry-laid stone, the removal of a few stones would be sufficient to bring the entire wall collapsing down. To prevent access to the walls themselves, {{the inhabitants of the}} fort raised large breastworks {{around the base of the}} walls by piling up rock rubble against the bases. These rubble barriers are over [...] high, and in places they are over [...] thick. Attackers would have had to clear away the rubble before being able to attack the wall, and all the while they would be under direct fire from defenders on the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall.</b>|$|E
500|$|The Phra Thinang Chai Chumpol (พระที่นั่งไชยชุมพล; [...] ) {{is located}} on the north of the eastern wall, {{opposite}} the Temple of the Emerald Buddha. The small rectangular pavilion was built on the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> of the palace. The pavilion has a roof of two tiers and is covered with tiles. The exterior is decorated with black lacquer and glass mosaic. The pavilion was built by King Rama IV as a viewing platform, where he could observe royal and religious processions going by along the Sanamchai Road. The pavilion was also used for a time as the main shrine of the Phra Siam Thevathiraj figure, before it was moved to its current shrine in the Phaisan Thaksin Hall.|$|E
500|$|The tower has {{external}} buttresses and {{the door}} on the west side is set in a pointed arch frame with a hood mould. The buttresses and door were added to the tower after it was built; the 1937 Royal Commission survey described them as [...] "modern". There are two stages (levels) to the tower; the tall upper stage is slightly narrower than the base, which measures 8feet 6inches by 8feet 9inches (26 by 2.7m). [...] The tower has simple rectangular openings in the north, east and south walls. There is a 17th-century bell in the west wall of the tower in a plain arch opening; the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> is crenellated. Behind the parapet {{at the top of the}} tower, there is a short spire in the shape of a pyramid, made from wood and covered in slates.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> church <b>of</b> Saint Peter and Saint Paul {{is one of}} only a few {{churches that}} have angels carved in wood instead <b>of</b> stone around <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls.</b> <b>The</b> current building, dating from 1454, is built on <b>the</b> {{foundation}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original church.A wood carving <b>of</b> <b>the</b> “Pedlar <b>of</b> Swaffham” is also in the church.|$|R
25|$|The site is {{protected}} by modern levees, but the Mississippi River is still an occasional menace. <b>The</b> flood <b>of</b> 1993 breached <b>the</b> levee and sent waters fifteen feet deep to lap at <b>the</b> <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|R

500|$|Tyrion tells Jon that he isn't [...] "better" [...] {{than any}} of his new [...] "brothers," [...] but only more fortunate, as he was trained by a master-at-arms, while the others are all orphan boys or criminals who have likely never held a sword before today. To make amends, Jon decides to give his fellow {{recruits}} proper sword training. Later, Tyrion is beseeched by Lord Commander Jeor Mormont and the elderly, blind Maester Aemon to ask his sister and brother-in-law for more men for the Night's Watch, as the wildlings are massing in numbers greater than the Watch is able to deal with, and rumours that the White Walkers have returned are becoming more widespread. Tyrion is skeptical, but agrees to do so. Before leaving the Wall, Tyrion fulfills his ambition to urinate off the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>Wall</b> and says goodbye to Jon, who finally accepts Tyrion as a friend.|$|E
500|$|After riders have boarded and {{the station}} floor is retracted, Superman: Krypton Coaster departs with {{a left turn}} out of the station. This leads {{directly}} to the [...] chain lift hill. At the top, the train crests the lift hill and follows a fairly level 180 degree turn to the right above the quarry wall. This leads into a [...] drop off the quarry wall directly into the [...] vertical loop. With the quarry wall on the track's right, the train inclines to the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> where it performs a helix to the right. After dropping from the quarry wall again, the train enters the zero-g roll where riders experience a feeling of weightlessness. This {{is followed by the}} [...] cobra roll and a mid-course brake run. The exit from the mid-course brake run banks down to the right into the two interlocking corkscrews. This leads to a final turn before the final brake run and return to the station.|$|E

Along the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>wall</b> is a walkway, which would typically take four hours to cover. It is built in the Chinese architecture style. As a defense fortification, it was constructed with a moat, drawbridges, watch towers, corner towers, parapet walls and gate towers.
