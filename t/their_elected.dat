5|$|Although the British were victorious {{over the}} French in the war, King George III's {{government}} {{felt that the}} North American colonies were not paying their way, since little direct tax revenue from the colonies was received. The Sugar Act of 1764 had its greatest effect in New England and did not cause widespread objection. The Stamp Act the following year affected all 13 colonies, as it required revenue stamps to be used on papers required in trade and in the law. When word of passage of the Stamp Act reached Williamsburg, the House of Burgesses passed the Virginia Resolves, asserting that Virginians had {{the same rights as}} if they resided in Britain, and that they could only be taxed by themselves or <b>their</b> <b>elected</b> representatives. The Resolves were mostly written by a fiery-spoken new member for Louisa County, Patrick Henry.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, Arafat {{moved to}} Gaza City, which was {{controlled}} by the Palestinian National Authority (PNA)—the provisional entity created by the Oslo Accords. Arafat became the President and Prime Minister of the PNA, the Commander of the PLA and the Speaker of the PLC. In July, after the PNA was declared the official government of the Palestinians, the Basic Laws of the Palestinian National Authority was published, in three different versions by the PLO. Arafat proceeded with creating a structure for the PNA. He established an executive committee or cabinet composed of twenty members. Arafat also replaced and assigned mayors and city councils for major cities such as Gaza and Nablus. He began subordinating non-governmental organizations that worked in education, health, and social affairs under his authority by replacing <b>their</b> <b>elected</b> leaders and directors with PNA officials loyal to him. He then appointed himself chairman of the Palestinian financial organization that {{was created by the}} World Bank to control most aid money towards helping the new Palestinian entity.|$|E
5|$|Tech {{graduates}} {{have been}} deeply influential in politics, military service, and activism. Atlanta mayor Ivan Allen, Jr. and former United States Senator Sam Nunn have both made significant changes from within <b>their</b> <b>elected</b> offices. Former Georgia Tech president G.

Ball was the 67th Secretary of the Navy, John M.

25|$|A four-year-long {{study of}} {{relations}} between America and China was conducted by the Council between 1964 and 1968. One study published in 1966 concluded that American citizens were more open to talks with China than <b>their</b> <b>elected</b> leaders. Henry Kissinger had continued to publish in Foreign Affairs and was appointed by President Nixon to serve as National Security Adviser in 1969. In 1971, he embarked on a secret trip to Beijing to broach talks with Chinese leaders. Richard Nixon went to China in 1972, and diplomatic relations were completely normalized by President Carter's Secretary of State, another Council member, Cyrus Vance.|$|E
25|$|With the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union in 1991, the Kolkhoz collectives were abandoned. The Nivkh were dependent on the state-funded collectives, and with their dissolution, rapid economic hardship ensued for the already poor populace. At present, the Nivkh living in the north of Sakhalin see their future threatened by the giant offshore oil extraction projects known as Sakhalin-I and Sakhalin-II, operated by foreign Western firms. Since January 2005, the Nivkh, led by <b>their</b> <b>elected</b> leader Alexey Limanzo, have engaged in non-violent protest actions, demanding an independent ethnological assessment of Shell's and Exxon's plans. Solidarity actions have been staged in Moscow, New York City and later in Berlin.

25|$|The {{beginning}} of the 14th century was characterized by the civil unrest in the cities of the kingdom, most notably in Lugo, Tui, Ourense and Compostela, originated in the aspiration of their city councils to become reguengas, that is, to become a direct dependency of the king, and as such virtually autonomous republics {{under the direction of}} <b>their</b> <b>elected</b> councils, whilst their bishops aspired to maintain them under their jurisdictional control, as part of their fiefs. This unrest was not new, as Compostela had known bloody conflicts of the bourgeois and the bishops since {{the first years of the}} 12th century, in times of Gelmirez, when the bishop himself was chased inside the city. In these conflicts, Don Felipe and the local nobility usually supported the councils' pretensions in opposition to the mighty and rich bishops, although most of the time the military and economic relevance of the archbishop of Santiago proved determinant in the maintenance of the status quo.|$|E
25|$|The {{result of}} a local {{election}} may only be overturned {{as a result of}} findings following an election petition presented by one of the candidates or at least four eligible voters. The time limit for presenting a petition is generally 21 days after the election. Alternatively, anyone convicted in a criminal court of corrupt or illegal electoral practice is required to vacate <b>their</b> <b>elected</b> office. A successful challenge through an election petition voids the election itself, such that the otherwise successful candidate is not considered ever lawfully elected. In contrast, a criminal conviction causes a vacancy to arise, but the original election is considered valid. In either case, a person convicted or reported by an election court personally guilty of corrupt practices is additionally barred from holding any elective office or being registered as a voter for a period of five years. For illegal practices, the period of disqualification is three years.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} Roman Republic contributed {{significantly}} to many aspects of democracy, {{only a minority of}} Romans were citizens with votes in elections for representatives. The votes of the powerful were given more weight through a system of gerrymandering, so most high officials, including members of the Senate, came from a few wealthy and noble families. In addition, the Roman Republic was the first government in the western world to have a Republic as a nation-state, although it didn't have much of a democracy. The Romans invented the concept of classics and many works from Ancient Greece were preserved. Additionally, the Roman model of governance inspired many political thinkers over the centuries, and today's modern representative democracies imitate more the Roman than the Greek models because it was a state in which supreme power was held by the people and <b>their</b> <b>elected</b> representatives, and which had an elected or nominated leader. Other cultures, such as the Iroquois Nation in the Americas between around 1450 and 1600 AD also developed a form of democratic society before they came in contact with the Europeans. This indicates that forms of democracy may have been invented in other societies around the world.|$|E
