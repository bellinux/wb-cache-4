5000|$|In its {{simplest}} {{form the}} carriage holds the tool bit and moves it longitudinally (turning) or perpendicularly (facing) {{under the control}} of the operator. The operator moves the carriage manually via the handwheel (5a) or automatically by engaging the feed shaft with the carriage feed mechanism (5c). This provides some relief for the operator as the movement of the carriage becomes power assisted. The handwheels (2a, 3b, 5a) on the carriage and its related slides are usually calibrated, both for ease of use and to assist in making reproducible cuts. Calibration marks will measure either the distance from center (radius), or the work piece's diameter, so for example, on a diameter machine where calibration marks are in thousandths of an inch, the radial handwheel dial will read [...]0005 inches of radius per division, or [...]001 inches of diameter. The carriage typically comprises a <b>top</b> <b>casting,</b> known as the saddle (4), and a side casting, known as the apron (5).|$|E
40|$|In {{the modern}} process of {{continuous}} Direct Chill (DC) hot <b>top</b> <b>casting</b> of aluminium extrusion ingot with gas slip, poor surface {{quality of the}} cast ingot can still be a problem. In the worst cases pronounced surface wrinkling may occur coupled with periodic zones of reduced grain size, macrosegregation and exudation at the surface. The observed surface irregularities {{are believed to be}} linked to periodic oscillations or folding of the free molten aluminium surface in the mould, the meniscus, resulting in varying solidification conditions. The focus of this work is {{to gain a better understanding}} of the dynamics of the meniscus and the effect it has on ingot surface formation. dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E

The aim of the experimental campaign is to design laboratory tests leading to a measurement of the dynamic transfer stiffness comprehensive of some interaction effects due to the coupling between engine foot and resilient element. The research is explained by the need of better understanding how the boundary conditions at the <b>top</b> <b>casting</b> of the resilient mounting influence the dynamic transmissibility to the foundation.

40|$|The direct chill (DC) casting {{technique}} to produce billets for extrusion and ingots for rollingwas {{developed in the}} 1930 s. The principle, which is still valid, is a two-stage cooling with a primary cooling at a mould surface followed by water spraying directly on the surface. Improvements of this technique have mainly focused on changes to the primary cooling, where a water-cooled metal mould {{has been replaced by}} different techniques to minimize cooling at this stage. The drive for development comes from the extrusion industry, which can increase the productivity and quality of extruded profiles by improving the billet surface appearance and structure. Hot <b>top</b> <b>casting</b> supported by airflow against the casting surface during the primary cooling is currently the standard procedure to achieve acceptable billet surfaces. The goal is to minimize the depth of the surface segregation zone, which is the governing factor for the appearance of different phases in the surface region. Billet surface quality is evaluated by quantifying surface appearance, segregation zone thickness, and  occurrence of large Mg 2 Si and β-particles near the surface. The β-Al 5 FeSi intermetallic phase and coarse Mg 2 Si particles have negative effects on extrudability and workability of 6 xxx Al alloys billets. To achieve extruded products with a high surface quality the as-cast billets are  heat-treated before extrusion. During heat treatment the undesired intermetallic particles, i. e., β-AlFeSi platelets are transformed to rounded α-Al(FeMn) Si intermetallic phases. In this  research the formation of the surface segregation for smooth defect-free surfaces in both as-cast and homogenized billets was studied. In addition, the surfaces with defects such as wavy, spot and vertical drag defects were investigated and possible mechanisms for initiation of those defects were explained. Moreover, for {{a better understanding of the}} homogenization process in-situ studies of the heat treatment of 6082, 6005, 6060 and 6063 Al alloys were carried out by using a transmission electron microscope (TEM). Based on the observations, an explanation of the probable mechanisms taking place during transformation from β-to α-phase was presented.
