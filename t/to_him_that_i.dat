25|$|When I {{became a}} member of the law firm of Steger, Thurmond and Rayburn, Messrs. Thurmond and Steger were {{representing}} the Santa Fe Railroad Company, receiving pay monthly. When the first check came after I entered the firm, Mr. Thurmond brought to my desk one-third of the amount of the check, explaining what it was for. I said <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was a member of the Legislature, representing the people of Fannin County, and that my experience had taught me that men who represent the people should be as far removed as possible from concerns whose interests he was liable to be called on to legislate concerning, and that on that ground I would not accept a dollar of the railroad's money, though I was legally entitled to it. I never did take a dollar of it. I have been guided by the principle in all my dealings.|$|E
25|$|You have no {{idea what}} sending on those checks to me at this time. After {{fighting}} for an idea all your life I realize that your backing has saved it for me and meant to thank you with all my heart and soul for what you have done. It has been marvelous. So many letters have been written and not mailed and owing to having been in bed {{a great deal of time}} this summer, the paintings were about all I could muster up enough energy to do what I considered the best of my ability. Just before Stieglitz’s death I took some paintings <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> considered as having something new in the. He immediately walked right up to them and spoke of the new ideas. His intuition in that way was remarkable and I am so glad to have been allowed to live during his and your lifetimes. It has been a great privilege for which I am truly thankful.|$|E
500|$|Cassandra Peterson, later television's Elvira, met Presley {{during this}} period in Las Vegas, where she {{was working as a}} showgirl. She recalls of their encounter, [...] "He was so anti-drug when I met him. I {{mentioned}} <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> smoked marijuana, and he was just appalled. He said, 'Don't ever do that again.'" [...] Presley was not only deeply opposed to recreational drugs, he also rarely drank. Several of his family members had been alcoholics, a fate he intended to avoid.|$|E

500|$|Lennon gave Mimi an {{allowance}} of £30 per week, {{but when she}} found out that his wife's mother was being given the same amount, she phoned the Lennons' house and said, [...] "What has she [...] done to deserve anything? Tell John, when you speak <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am very, very annoyed", before slamming down the phone. Lennon moved to New York in 1971, and never returned to England again. Despite losing touch with several family members, he kept in close contact with her and telephoned her every week. On 5 December 1980, three days before Lennon was murdered, he called her to say he was homesick and was planning a trip back to England. After Lennon's death, Mimi was furious to find out that he had never transferred the ownership of the house over to her, which meant that Ono owned the house, and could sell it at any time.|$|E
500|$|The American Broadcasting Company (ABC) {{characterized}} Hunt as [...] "confident", [...] "innovative", [...] "intelligent", {{while he}} {{also can be}} [...] "aggressive", [...] "brazen", [...] "presumptuous", [...] "hasty and rash". McKidd said of his character: [...] " [...] He's not an easy character to connect to, I think. There's some darkness to him and there's some danger <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> think is really interesting and exciting to play. [...] " [...] Additionally, McKidd describes Hunt as [...] "very instinctive, and follows his gut, and he's very impulsive, and very immediate. He immediately assesses a situation. And he's very honest, sometimes painfully honest, with himself and with others. He wants to make himself better. He wants to improve himself as a person. He's a decent guy, {{a sort of a}} guy I'd like to go out and have a beer with." [...] Hunt's unorthodox teaching methods {{have been the subject of}} controversy. McKidd said of this: [...] The look of Owen has been described as hardcore and the antithesis of the other males on the show. McKidd says it's not just the look of Owen, but the fact that in his profession, he is dealing with life and death everyday. The one distinction he finds between his character and the others is that Owen does not care what other people think of him. When McKidd returned from his first appearance, his character appeared to have been changed. McKidd told TV Guide: [...] "Yes, that was who he really is in the premiere, but now we're seeing what can happen to a good man, a good soldier and good surgeon [...]" ...|$|E
2500|$|After I {{had been}} {{studying}} with him for two years, Schoenberg said, [...] "In order to write music, {{you must have a}} feeling for harmony." [...] I explained <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> had no feeling for harmony. He then said that I would always encounter an obstacle, that it would be as though I came to a wall through which I could not pass. I said, 'In that case I will devote my life to beating my head against that wall.' [...] " ...|$|E

2500|$|Kierkegaard {{then turned}} his {{attention}} to his examinations. On 13 May 1839, he wrote, [...] "I have no alternative than to suppose that it is God's will that I prepare for my examination and that it is more pleasing <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> do this than actually coming to some clearer perception by immersing myself in one or another sort of research, for obedience is more precious to him than the fat of rams." [...] The death of his father and the death of Poul Møller also played a part in his decision.|$|E
2500|$|While at a {{cocktail}} party, Dziubinska met the actor Sir John Mills. She is quoted as saying, 'I adored Hayley, so I went over {{to talk to him}} about my favourite film of all time, Whistle Down The Wind, which I've seen four million times. I said <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was an actress and that I'd been acting since I was at school and then I asked him if he had any advice, and he said, 'do everything you're offered, because everything you do will give you some experience!' The first thing I was offered the next day was Vampyres!' ...|$|E
2500|$|Matthews had {{recently}} applied {{to go on}} the dole but was ruled out on a technicality when it was discovered that he was playing in a McDonald's Cup match that week. [...] "I don't care what money I get, man", Matthews said. [...] "It's the buzz of playing for Australia that's got me. I'm not worried about how much they pay ... I'd do it all for nothing just to wear that green cap." [...] However, there was some sad news for Matthews. [...] "My old coach from the Rydalmere junior days, Gordon Nolan, is dead and I owe so much <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> wish I could have contacted him this morning as both our dreams came true." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{told him}} I was very glad, as indeed I was, {{to have been}} no {{hindrance}} <b>to</b> <b>him,</b> and <b>that</b> <b>I</b> hoped I should be none now.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, easy," [...] {{said the}} tactful Mr. Mills. [...] "You can’t think what a {{difference}} it’s made <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> <b>That’s</b> why <b>I</b> came <b>to</b> see you—so you shouldn’t be startled." ...|$|R

2500|$|After his mother's funerals, young Habib {{left his}} brother's house in Tunis {{to settle in}} the Sadiki dormitories. Prestigious {{teachers}} from Ez-Zitouna mosque like Mohamed Abdelaziz Djaït taught him. [...] "He taught us all the [...] "moulakat" [...] that I still know by heart and that I recite without needing to remind myself of them", he stated in 1973. He also learned Arabic grammar thanks to the cheikh Mohamed Belkadhi. Nevertheless, also French teachers marked him such as Mr. Collières who taught him French. [...] "I {{can assure you that}} neither in Lycée Carnot nor, years later in university, did I have to acquire new skills to perfect this language [...] He had taught us the art of french writing. His teaching methods were remarkable. And if I learned to write articles in the admired perfect articulation and harmonious balance, it is <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> owe that".|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} 1904, KR became {{somewhat}} {{attached to}} an attractive young {{man by the name}} of Yatsko. [...] "I sent for Yatsko and he came this morning. I easily persuaded him to be candid. It was strange for me to hear him describe the familiar characteristics: he has never felt drawn to a woman, and has been infatuated with men several times. I did not confess <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> knew these feelings from my own personal experience. Yatsko and I talked for a long time. Before leaving he kissed my face and hands; I should not have allowed this, and should have pushed him away, however I was punished afterwards by vague feelings of shame and remorse. He told me that, ever since the first time we met, his soul has been filled with rapturous feelings towards me, which grow all the time. How this reminds me of my own youth." [...] A few days later, KR and Yatsko met again, and a relationship developed between the two.|$|E

6000|$|... "Still economical, <b>I</b> see. Well, <b>that's</b> all the {{information}} I require. You have given your word of honor not <b>to</b> notify <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have discovered his whereabouts. Is it not so?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Very likely, {{but what}} is my manner to his? Besides, I have said {{everything}} <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> <b>That</b> is <b>I</b> have said the great thing, that he is making her immensely talked about.' ...|$|R
60|$|DAISY. [Amused.] He came {{to make me}} {{an offer}} of marriage. I pointed out <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was married already.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{was half}} {{inclined}} <b>to</b> tell <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was Jean's brother-in-law, but I thought it {{better not to}} until we had been to sea {{for a day or}} two, and had learned a little more about him." ...|$|R

60|$|As I stood {{upon the}} beach the next morning, while my {{portmanteau}} was being handed into the boat, I gave the Boots five zwanzigers. I was determined <b>to</b> show <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> did not condescend to feel anger against him.|$|R
60|$|It {{was only}} possible, while {{the book was}} in his possession, <b>to</b> remind <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> could hear, {{and that he could}} speak, by using the {{language}} of signs. I touched my lips, and pointed to him; I touched my ear, and pointed to myself.|$|R
