5|$|The Gulf of Aqaba {{lies between}} the Sinai Peninsula and the Arabian Peninsula, both mostly desert regions {{with very few}} {{permanent}} settlements. The seismologists who work with historical events gather macroseismic data from written records from cities <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been anywhere near the epicentral area. This can result in the mislocation of events when significant damage was reported in a particular location which were not actually where the earthquake occurred. The records of these events {{have been influenced by}} the distribution of the population (where the people were) and this has caused difficulty in creating a complete and accurate index of historical events. Several studies in the 80s and 90s indicate that there were two or possibly three large earthquakes in the region in the last 2000 years with magnitudes estimated to be 6.5–7.0 based on macroseismic data.|$|E

25|$|Another {{approach}} to humanistic counseling and therapy is Gestalt therapy, which puts {{a focus on}} the here and now, especially as an opportunity to look past any preconceived notions and focus on how the present is affected by the past. Role playing also plays a large role in Gestalt therapy and allows for a true expression of feelings <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been shared in other circumstances. In Gestalt therapy, non-verbal cues are an important indicator of how the client may actually be feeling, despite the feelings expressed.|$|E
25|$|After a {{decision}} process ends, leaders should {{reflect on the}} process and try to derive lessons learned regarding how to manage conflict constructively. Since reflections can lead to new insight, individuals must take time to critically assess the experience. They also must address and repair any hurt feelings and damaged relationships <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been apparent during the process itself. If these relationships are not repaired, trust could be lost which could negatively affect the effort of the next collaboration. Additionally, leaders should celebrate constructive conflict management and help others to remember {{the success of the}} process (Roberto, 2005).|$|E

25|$|ADTs provide {{classroom}} instruction and teachings to Afghans {{about how to}} improve their farming practices during non-seasonal growing months, which allows the farmers to use skills in the winter to prepare for farming {{in the summer and}} fall. This enhances agricultural production and the Afghan economy as a whole. Agricultural education also improves lines of communication and builds trust between the people, the US government, and the Host Nation. Additionally, through word of mouth in the provinces ideas are spread that inform others about these farming techniques, <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> had direct interaction with the ADTs. The National Guard ADTs also introduce their US civilian colleagues to the Afghan University personnel, which further strengthens relations and trust in the US efforts in Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|The Near East has, since Roman times, been {{recognized}} as a center of quality glassware and crystal. 9th century finds from Samarra show styles similar to Sassanian forms. The types of objects made were bottles, flasks, vases, and cups utilized for domestic use. Decorations on these domestic items include molded flutes, honeycomb patters, and inscriptions. Other styles seen <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> come from the Sassanians were stamped items. These were typically round stamps, such as medallions or disks with animals, birds, or Kufic inscriptions. Colored lead glass, typically blue or green, {{have been found in}} Nishapur, along with prismatic perfume bottles. Finally, cut glass may have been the high point of Abbasid glass-working, decorated with floral and animal designs.|$|E
25|$|Following the Korean Air 801 crash, it {{was brought}} to the NTSB's {{attention}} that foreign carriers flying {{in and out of the}} US were not covered by the Aviation Disaster Family Assistance Act of 1996 and Korean Air did not have a plan to deal with the situation they encountered. As a result, US Congress passed the Foreign Air Carrier Family Support Act of 1997 to require those carriers to file family assistance plans and fulfill the same family support requirements as domestic airlines. Not only does the Act ensure that all victims and family members will be treated equitably, regardless of the carrier they use, it also impels many carriers <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> thought about family assistance issues to give them due consideration in their emergency response plans.|$|E

25|$|There {{are also}} many {{tangible}} benefits for biologists. For example, a researcher investigating a certain {{form of cancer}} may have narrowed down their search to a particular gene. By visiting the human genome database on the World Wide Web, this researcher can examine what other scientists have written about this gene, including (potentially) the three-dimensional structure of its product, its function(s), its evolutionary relationships to other human genes, or to genes in mice or yeast or fruit flies, possible detrimental mutations, interactions with other genes, body tissues in which this gene is activated, and diseases associated with this gene or other datatypes. Further, {{deeper understanding of the}} disease processes at the level of molecular biology may determine new therapeutic procedures. Given the established importance of DNA in molecular biology and its central role in determining the fundamental operation of cellular processes, it is likely that expanded knowledge in this area will facilitate medical advances in numerous areas of clinical interest <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been possible without them.|$|E
500|$|As of 2008 {{only two}} {{in-depth}} {{studies of the}} mix of fossils {{in any part of}} the Burgess Shale had been published, by Simon Conway Morris in 1986 and by Caron and Jackson in 2008. Caron and Jackson commented that Conway Morris had to rely on a set of specimens <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> been representative, since their excavators discarded specimens they found uninteresting; and for which the exact level in the rock sequence had not been recorded, making chronological analyses impossible. Both studies noted that the set of species in Walcott's Phyllopod Bed (Conway Morris, 1986) and its expanded version the Greater Phyllopod Bed (Caron and Jackson, 2008) was different from those found {{in other parts of the}} Burgess Shale; and Conway Morris commented that faunas at most other Burgess Shale sites resembled those of the Raymond Quarry, which is above and therefore more recent than the Greater Phyllopod Bed (abbreviated [...] "GPB").|$|E
500|$|On December 2, 2003, Spears {{announced}} {{through her}} official website US concerts {{to support her}} fourth studio album, In the Zone (2003). The tour would kick off on March 2 in San Diego, California, at iPayOne Center. However, Spears released a statement saying, [...] "I'm especially looking forward to bringing my tour to new markets and performing in front of fans <b>that</b> <b>may</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> {{had the opportunity to}} see any of my previous tours." [...] On January 12, 2004, four dates were announced in Glasgow, Manchester, London and Birmingham, her first UK dates in four years. After the beginning of the North American leg, Spears announced a summer leg in the United States in June as well as a European leg starting on April 27 in London and ending on June 5 at Rock in Rio Lisboa. It was also rumored to visit Latin America and Asia later in the year. The Onyx Hotel Tour was originally going to be called In the Zone Tour. On February 17, 2004, a San Diego clothing manufacturer of the same name sued Spears for $10 million and banned her from using the trademark. On May 17, 2004, a hotel named Onyx Hotel opened in Boston, Massachusetts. Kimpton Hotels & Restaurant Group had come up with the name two years before the tour was developed. Spears and the Kimpton group decided to promote the hotel by featuring a room named The Britney Spears Foundation Room. It was designed by Spears's mother, Lynne, reflecting Spears's personality and taste. The room opened six weeks later and a portion of the fee was destined to the Britney Spears Foundation.|$|E
