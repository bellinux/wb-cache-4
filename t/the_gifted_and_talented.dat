Data gathered {{from a variety of}} stakeholders indicate that, in its recent history, the school’s provision varied considerably – from applying a structured, whole-school approach to lacking official policies and practices, to re-establishing school-wide provision. Provision was dependent on management priorities that often echoed national priorities that took the focus off of <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> <b>talented</b> learners. These findings suggest that if national priorities do not explicitly include <b>gifted</b> <b>and</b> <b>talented</b> learners along with learners with special educational needs, then these students may be left vulnerable as schools shift their focus elsewhere.
