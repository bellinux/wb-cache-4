The film's producer was Michael Finnell, who had also worked on <b>The</b> <b>Howling</b> with Dante. Spielberg took the project to Warner Bros. and co-produced it through his own company, Amblin Entertainment.|$|E

25|$|Baronas {{analyzed}} the legend looking for religious symbolism. He identified some parallels between Saint Peter and Petras Goštautas, the Seven Deacons and the fourteen martyrs. Other allusions {{could be the}} Fourteen Holy Helpers or the seven martyrs in 2 Maccabees 7:1-42. An interesting parallel was drawn by Antoni Grzybowski in 1740: he compared seven priests who destroyed the walls of Jericho with trumpets of ram's horn in Joshua 6: 1-21 with the Franciscan priests who silenced <b>the</b> <b>howling</b> devil (i.e. the Iron Wolf) with the Good News of God.|$|E
25|$|New {{performers}} included Robert Picardo, who {{had previously}} worked with Dante and producer Michael Finnell in films such as <b>The</b> <b>Howling</b> (1981).

Joe Dante has a brief cameo {{as the director of}} Grandpa Fred's show. John Glover played Clamp (character based upon Donald Trump and Ted Turner) and brought to the role an enthusiastic innocence that overrode the fact that his character had been written as a villain, which Dante thought lightened the film in general.|$|E
25|$|In 1944, as he attacks a Hydra {{base in the}} Nazi-occupied Danish Straits, Steve Rogers recalls {{parts of}} his life that got him to this point: his mother's blessing to become a soldier; {{his first meeting with}} Bucky Barnes, who {{protected}} him from bullies as a boy; the day after Pearl Harbor was bombed, when Bucky and Steve decided to enlist; Bucky training Steve to pass the physical; and the point when Bucky passed the physical but Steve failed. Johann Schmidt watches Rogers fight, and recalls how he got to this point: meeting Adolf Hitler; capturing Arnim Zola to research creating super soldiers; and finding Abraham Erskine and blackmailing him into continuing his super soldier research under the employ of the Nazis. Howard Stark, via radio, assists Rogers, remembering when he was recruited by Colonel Phillips to join the Strategic Scientific Reserve, and when he helped Peggy Carter rescue Erskine from Schmidt. Dum Dum Dugan and <b>the</b> <b>Howling</b> Commandos arrive to assist Rogers, and they remember their formation—thrust together in a Hydra work camp, forming close friendships after a failed escape attempt. After they defeat the Hydra soldiers, Rogers destroys Schmidt's main weapon at the base, an Asgardian artifact.|$|E

40|$|The {{gray wolf}} {{population}} in Idaho has substantially increased since wolves were reintroduced into central Idaho and Yellowstone National Park in 1995 - 96. Although Idaho wolves were recently {{removed from the}} Endangered Species list, accurate monitoring of wolf population status and presence levels remains a critical task for natural resource managers. A number of monitoring systems and techniques are available but each has its limitations (e. g., cost, reliability, personnel safety). <b>The</b> <b>Howl</b> Box is a new, autonomous monitoring system recently prototyped by researchers at Montana Cooperative Wildlife Research Unit in Missoula. This electronic system periodically broadcasts a wolf howl recording and automatically records audio responses (e. g, howls from nearby wolves) to <b>the</b> <b>howl</b> stimulus. Early results indicated this system was effective for detecting wolf presence and, via audio spectral analysis, useful in identifying wolf individuals for detailed monitoring of population status. <b>The</b> <b>Howl</b> Box prototype, however, was composed of a netbook computer, external speaker and microphones, battery, and solar charging system and thus was relatively heavy, bulky, power-hungry, and expensive to construct and remotely deploy. Our project goal {{was to develop a}} wolf monitoring system based on <b>the</b> <b>Howl</b> box concept but lighter, smaller, more power-efficient, and less expensive. We used low-power, embedded electronic components including microcontrollers, MP 3 encoder/decorders, and microSD card data storage to develop our system, <b>the</b> <b>Howl</b> Box 2. 0 design was intended to allow one person, in one outing, to easily carry and deploy several of these monitoring units into rugged, remote monitoring sites where they would operate autonomously for 3 - 6 months or more without servicing. By reducing costs and increasing efficiencies, <b>the</b> <b>Howl</b> Box 2. 0 should allow increased wolf monitoring intensity while reducing the need for airborne radio-tracking flights and other wolf monitoring techniques with associated personnel safety issues...|$|R

500|$|Sea Mither is {{a spirit}} of summer days that quells the {{turbulent}} sea waters around the northern isles of Scotland. Shetland islanders, particularly fishermen, seek her protection from the Devil. Control of the seas is maintained by Teran, the spirit of winter, until Sea Mither arrives {{around the time of}} the vernal equinox in mid-March. Both spirits are invisible to humans. Teran is her arch-enemy and the pair fight bitterly, often for weeks as she tries to gain control. Their arguments cause gale force winds and heavy tumultuous seas as she tries to wrest control from him. Teran's screeches are carried by <b>the</b> <b>howling</b> gales as the two spirits try to oust each other. The period of the spring combat between the pair is termed the Vore tullye or the [...] "spring struggle". Eventually Sea Mither overcomes Teran, relegating him to the depths of the ocean; inclement summer weather is caused by Teran's attempts to escape.|$|E
500|$|In December 2009, {{director}} Joe Johnston {{indicated that}} he planned to start filming in April 2010. In a separate interview that month, he described the film's pre-production: [...] "Rick Heinrichs is production-designing and we're set up down in Manhattan Beach, California.... We have eight or ten really talented artists, and we all just sit around all day and draw pictures and say, 'Hey, wouldn't it be cool if we could do this?' It's that phase of the production where money doesn't matter: 'Let's put all the greatest stuff up on the wall and [...] see what we can afford. The film, he said, will begin [...] "in 1942, 1943" [...] during World War II. [...] "The stuff in the '60s and '70s [...] we're sort of avoiding. We're going back to the '40s, and then forward to what they're doing with Captain America now." [...] In February 2010, Johnston stated that the Invaders will appear in [...] "the entire second half" [...] of the film, leading fans to speculate this was the World War II-era Marvel superhero team of that name, and in November Johnston refuted speculation that the Sub-Mariner, an Invaders team-member in the comics, would be included. Johnston later explained that [...] "the Invaders" [...] had been discussed simply as a possible name for the squad of commandos Captain America leads in the film. Christopher Markus, one of the screenwriters, said the unnamed group was [...] "called <b>the</b> <b>Howling</b> Commandos in the script, but no one says that out loud." ...|$|E
