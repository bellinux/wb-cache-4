5|$|Net-casting spiders weave {{only small}} webs, but then {{manipulate}} them to trap prey. Those {{of the genus}} Hyptiotes and the family Theridiosomatidae stretch their webs and then release them when prey strike them, but do not actively move their webs. Those of the family Deinopidae weave even smaller webs, hold them outstretched between their first two pairs of legs, and lunge and push the webs as much as twice their own body length to trap prey, and this move may increase the webs' area {{by a factor of}} up to ten. Experiments have shown that Deinopis spinosus has two different techniques for trapping prey: backwards strikes to catch flying insects, whose vibrations it detects; and forward strikes to catch ground-walking prey that it sees. These <b>two</b> <b>techniques</b> have also been observed in other deinopids. Walking insects form most of the prey of most deinopids, but one population of Deinopis subrufa appears to live mainly on tipulid flies that they catch with the backwards strike.|$|E

5|$|For the live-action {{portion of}} the production, Bakshi and his cast and crew went to Spain, where the {{rotoscope}} models acted out their parts in costume. During {{the middle of a}} large shoot, union bosses called for a lunch break, and Bakshi secretly shot footage of actors in Orc costumes moving toward the craft service table, and used the footage in the film. Many of the actors who contributed voices to this production also acted out their parts for rotoscoped scenes. The actions of Bilbo Baggins and Samwise Gamgee were performed by Billy Barty, while Sharon Baird served as the performance model for Frodo Baggins. Other performers used on the rotoscoping session included John A. Neris as Gandalf, Walt Robles as Aragorn, Felix Silla as Gollum, Jeri Lea Ray as Galadriel and Aesop Aquarian as Gimli. Although some cel animation was produced and shot for the film, very little of it appears in the final film. Most of the film's crowd and battle scenes use a different technique, in which live-action footage is solarized (per an interview with the film's cinematographer, Timothy Galfas, in the documentary Forging Through the Darkness: the Ralph Bakshi Vision for The Lord of the Rings) to produce a more three-dimensional look. In a few shots the <b>two</b> <b>techniques</b> are combined.|$|E
5|$|The axiomatization of mathematics, on {{the model}} of Euclid's Elements, had reached new levels of rigour and breadth {{at the end of the}} 19th century, {{particularly}} in arithmetic, thanks to the axiom schema of Richard Dedekind and Charles Sanders Peirce, and in geometry, thanks to Hilbert's axioms. But at the beginning of the 20th century, efforts to base mathematics on naive set theory suffered a setback due to Russell's paradox (on the set of all sets that do not belong to themselves). The problem of an adequate axiomatization of set theory was resolved implicitly about twenty years later by Ernst Zermelo and Abraham Fraenkel. Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory provided a series of principles that allowed for the construction of the sets used in the everyday practice of mathematics, but they did not explicitly exclude the possibility of the existence of a set that belongs to itself. In his doctoral thesis of 1925, von Neumann demonstrated <b>two</b> <b>techniques</b> to exclude such sets—the axiom of foundation and the notion of class.|$|E
5|$|The {{technique}} of flight among procellariids depends on foraging methods. Compared {{to an average}} bird, all procellariids have a high aspect ratio (meaning their wings are long and narrow) and a heavy wing loading. Therefore, they must maintain a high speed {{in order to remain}} in the air. Most procellariids use <b>two</b> <b>techniques</b> to do this, namely, dynamic soaring and slope soaring. Dynamic soaring involves gliding across wave fronts, thus taking advantage of the vertical wind gradient and minimising the effort required to stay in the air. Slope soaring is more straightforward: the procellariid turns to the wind, gaining height, from where it can then glide back down to the sea. Most procellariids aid their flight by means of flap-glides, where bursts of flapping are followed by a period of gliding; the amount of flapping dependent on the strength of the wind and the choppiness of the water. Shearwaters and other larger petrels, which have lower aspect ratio, must make more use of flapping to remain airborne than gadfly petrels. Because of the high speeds required for flight, procellariids need to either run or face into a strong wind in order to take off.|$|E

We develop a simple Markov process model to analyze data block behavior {{and its impact}} on application performance, while the snapshot operation is underway at the block-level storage. We have implemented the <b>two</b> snapshots <b>techniques</b> on both Windows and Linux operating systems. Based on our analytical model and our implementation, we carry out quantitative performance evaluations and comparisons of the <b>two</b> snapshot <b>techniques</b> using IoMeter, PostMark, TPC-C, and TPC-W benchmarks. Our measurements reveal many interesting observations regarding the performance characteristics of the <b>two</b> snapshot <b>techniques.</b> Depending on the applications and different I/O workloads, the <b>two</b> snapshot <b>techniques</b> perform quite differently. In general, copy-on-write performs well on read-intensive applications, while redirect-on-write performs well on writeintensive applications...|$|R

His most common winning kimarite was yori-kiri (force out), closely followed by oshi-dashi (push out). Together these <b>two</b> <b>techniques</b> accounted for half his victories at sekitori level.

Continuous auditing, on the other hand, involves advanced analytical tools that automate a majority of the auditing plan. Where auditors manually extract data and run their own analyses in computer-aided auditing during the course of their traditional audit, high-powered servers automatically extract and analyze data at specified intervals as a part of continuous auditing.|$|E

25|$|Because CT and MRI are {{sensitive}} to different tissue properties, {{the appearance of the}} images obtained with the <b>two</b> <b>techniques</b> differ markedly. In CT, X-rays must be blocked by some form of dense tissue to create an image, so the image quality when looking at soft tissues will be poor. In MRI, while any nucleus with a net nuclear spin can be used, the proton of the hydrogen atom remains the most widely used, especially in the clinical setting, because it is so ubiquitous and returns a large signal. This nucleus, present in water molecules, allows the excellent soft-tissue contrast achievable with MRI.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally, nuclear {{magnetic}} resonance spectroscopy has been limited to relatively small proteins or protein domains. This is in part caused by problems resolving overlapping peaks in larger proteins, but this has been alleviated {{by the introduction of}} isotope labelling and multidimensional experiments. Another more serious problem is the fact that in large proteins the magnetization relaxes faster, which means there is less time to detect the signal. This in turn causes the peaks to become broader and weaker, and eventually disappear. <b>Two</b> <b>techniques</b> have been introduced to attenuate the relaxation: transverse relaxation optimized spectroscopy (TROSY) and deuteration of proteins. By using these techniques it has been possible to study proteins in complex with the 900 kDa chaperone GroES-GroEL.|$|E
