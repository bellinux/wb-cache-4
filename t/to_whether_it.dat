5|$|As of December 2007, the TTB lists both Zinfandel and Primitivo as {{approved}} grape varieties for American wines, {{but they are}} not listed as synonyms. U.S. producers, therefore, must label a wine according <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> is Zinfandel or Primitivo. The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) proposed in 2002 that they be recognised as synonyms, but no decision on this proposal (RIN 1513–AA32, formerly RIN 1512-AC65) has been made.|$|E
5|$|Divine command theory (also {{known as}} {{theological}} voluntarism) is a meta-ethical theory which proposes that an action's status as morally good is equivalent <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> is commanded by God. The theory asserts {{that what is}} moral is determined by what God commands, and that {{for a person to}} be moral is to follow his commands. Followers of both monotheistic and polytheistic religions in ancient and modern times have often accepted the importance of God's commands in establishing morality.|$|E

5|$|Deal Castle was {{increasingly}} resembling a private house, rather than purely a fortification, and {{this led to}} arguments in 1829 as <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> {{should be subject to}} local taxation as a private dwelling, or continue to be exempt as a military site. The captaincy had long since become an honorary position, given out as a reward by the Crown. In 1898, the War Office agreed that the Office of Works should be consulted over any external alterations to the historic castle, and that the Office of Works would be responsible for paying for any resulting work. The War Office finally concluded in 1904 that the castle no longer had any value either as a defence or as a barracks, and transferred it entirely to the Office of Works. When the captain was not in residence it was opened to visitors.|$|E
5|$|Diplodocus had an {{extremely}} long tail, composed of about 80 caudal vertebrae, which are {{almost double the}} number some of the earlier sauropods had in their tails (such as Shunosaurus with 43), and far more than contemporaneous macronarians had (such as Camarasaurus with 53). Some speculation exists as <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> {{may have had a}} defensive or noisemaking (by cracking it like a coachwhip) function. The tail may have served as a counterbalance for the neck. The middle part of the tail had 'double beams' (oddly shaped chevron bones on the underside, which gave Diplodocus its name). They may have provided support for the vertebrae, or perhaps prevented the blood vessels from being crushed if the animal's heavy tail pressed against the ground. These 'double beams' are also seen in some related dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Enraged by this, and by {{accusations of}} fraudulently passing off foreign moths as British, Cribb gave up {{collecting}} {{and left the}} rest of the specimens with his landlady as security for a debt. Here the stories from Manchester University and The Australian Museum, Victoria differ as <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> was Cribb's pub landlady or the landlady of his lodgings, but either way the result was the same. The debt was not paid on time and when Cribb went back for the moths, which he had already sold to another collector, his landlady had burnt them. Subsequent efforts by other collectors to find more of the moths were unsuccessful, and the three specimens left in existence are thought to be the only representatives of an extinct species.|$|E

5|$|In September 2012, the Swiss {{government}} gave banks like Credit Suisse {{permission to}} provide information to the US Justice Department for tax evasion probes. In February 2014 it agreed to pay a fine of $197 million after one of its businesses served 8,500 US clients without registering its activities, leading to suspicion as <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> was helping Americans evade taxes. It was one of 14 Swiss banks under investigation. Separately, in 2013, German authorities began to probe Credit Suisse, its private bank subsidiary Clariden Leu, and its regional subsidiary Neue Aargauer Bank for helping German citizens evade taxes. The bank eventually entered into a €150 million settlement with the government.|$|E
5|$|The 1975–76 {{season was}} Orr's final {{season with the}} Bruins and it was tumultuous. Orr's {{contract}} was ending after the season, potentially making him a free agent. The Bruins were sold by Storer Broadcasting in August 1975 and the new Jacobs ownership group had to promise to keep Orr {{as a condition of}} the purchase. The Bruins and Orr reached a verbal agreement with the Jacobs during the summer of 1975, including a controversial agreement for Orr to take an 18.5% share of the Bruins after his playing days were over. The agreement was to be checked out as <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> would be legal for tax reasons and whether or not the league would approve it.|$|E
5|$|The {{capture of}} the JNA barracks in Bjelovar also {{affected}} the ceasefire agreement reached between the JNA and Croatia in Igalo, specifically a provision regarding {{the lifting of the}} blockade of the JNA barracks there. Initially there was a dispute between Tuđman and JNA General Veljko Kadijević as <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> meant achieving normal living conditions in the barracks or complete freedom of movement for the JNA in Croatia. A compromise interpretation was negotiated, only to be dropped by Kadijević specifically because of the events in Bjelovar. On 1 October, Kadijević issued an ultimatum to Croatia threatening destruction of one civilian facility vital to the Croatian population for each military post captured by the ZNG. The ultimatum demonstrated that the JNA considered Croatia enemy territory, rather than part of the country it had a responsibility to protect.|$|E

5|$|Those {{with more}} serious {{injuries}} {{had to be}} carried down the track. The usual decision as <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> was safe to move someone was simplified by the Japanese, who killed all the wounded they encountered. Only those near death were abandoned. Casualties were held at the aid posts and dressing stations until they could walk, or the Japanese threatened. It took eight or ten Papuan carriers to move each man. Army stretchers rotted and fell apart; the Papuans improvised stretchers from blankets, copra bags and timber cut along the Track. The pace of the withdrawal was dictated by {{the rate at which}} casualties could be evacuated.|$|E
5|$|While {{stopped on}} the Biggerstaff land, the rebels convicted 36 Loyalist prisoners. Some were testified against by Patriots who had {{previously}} fought alongside them and later changed sides. Nine of the prisoners were hanged before Isaac Shelby brought {{an end to the}} proceedings. His decision to halt the executions came after an impassioned plea for mercy from one of the Biggerstaff women, although accounts vary as <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> was Martha Biggerstaff, Aaron's wife, or Mary Van Zant Biggerstaff, Benjamin's wife. Many of the Patriots dispersed over the next few days, while all but 130 of the Loyalist prisoners escaped while being led in single file through woodlands. The column finally made camp at Salem, North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|With this {{contribution}} of von Neumann, the axiomatic {{system of the}} theory of sets avoided the contradictions of earlier systems, and became usable as a foundation for mathematics, despite the lack of a proof of its consistency. The next question was whether it provided definitive answers to all mathematical questions that could be posed in it, or whether it might be improved by adding stronger axioms {{that could be used to}} prove a broader class of theorems. A strongly negative answer <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> was definitive arrived in September 1930 at the historic mathematical Congress of Königsberg, in which Kurt Gödel announced his first theorem of incompleteness: the usual axiomatic systems are incomplete, in the sense that they cannot prove every truth which is expressible in their language. Moreover, every consistent extension of these systems would necessarily remain incomplete.|$|E

5|$|The filmmakers sought {{inspiration}} from novels such as Prime Directive, Spock's World and Best Destiny {{to fill in}} gaps unexplained by canon; Best Destiny particularly explores Kirk's childhood and names his parents. One idea that was justified through information from the novels was having Enterprise built on Earth, which {{was inspired by a}} piece of fan art of Enterprise being built in a shipyard. Orci had sent the fan art to Abrams to show how realistic the film could be. Orci explained parts of the ship would have to be constructed on Earth because of the artificial gravity employed on the ship and its requirement for sustaining warp speed, and therefore the calibration of the ship's machinery would be best done in the exact gravity well which is to be simulated. They felt free to have the ship built in Iowa because canon is ambiguous as <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> was built in San Francisco, but this {{is a result of the}} time travel rather than something intended to overlap with the original timeline. Abrams noted the continuity of the original series itself was inconsistent at times.|$|E
5|$|When {{speaking}} about why an online game {{was chosen as}} {{the next step in the}} series, Fujisawa cited the intuitive character AI in Dragon Quest IV and party member communication in Dragon Quest VII. Solid ideas for an online game set within the Dragon Quest series were first suggested in 2005, when development was wrapping up on Dragon Quest VIII. It was initially worked on by a very small team, who worked together on the groundwork for some time. A core part of the initial plan was that the game would have a pre-planned ten-year lifespan with continual content updates. Once work had finished on Dragon Quest IX, Dragon Quest X took full priority. During these earlier phases, it was still undecided whether to make the game a mainline title, and there was even doubt as <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> could be an MMORPG rather than just an online multiplayer game. These doubts, held by Saito, were assuaged by Fujisawa's confidence in the project. Despite this, Fujisawa was a novice at both developing and playing MMORPGs, putting him in stark contrast with other staff members such as Saito, Yoshida and second chief planner Takashi Anzai.|$|E
5|$|Pierce {{was sent}} back to Buffalo for the 1946 season, now with Gabby Hartnett as his manager (Harris having moved to the team's front office), but missed most of the year with a back injury which was {{attributed}} to overwork. After the 1947 season in Buffalo, where Richards was now his manager, he returned to Detroit in 1948, spending most of the season in the bullpen but making five starts and posting a 3–0 record; he had yet added very little weight since his high school days, being still at 148 pounds. He made his first start, and earned his first major league victory, on August 8 against the Washington Senators, pitching 7⅔ innings and striking out six in a 6–5 victory in which he also drove in a run with a triple and scored. However, Pierce also issued 51 walks in 55⅓ innings that year, and concerns about his pitching control led the Tigers to trade him to the White Sox on November 10 for catcher Aaron Robinson and $10,000, in what most baseball historians consider {{to be one of the}} most one-sided trades in baseball history. Talks had initially centered on Chicago acquiring Pierce's high school teammate Ted Gray, although sources differ as <b>to</b> <b>whether</b> <b>it</b> was White Sox general manager Frank Lane or his Detroit counterpart Billy Evans who switched the focus to Pierce; the Tigers tried to call off the deal one day after it was completed upon fully realizing what they had given up, even offering $50,000 to get Pierce back, but Lane had no intention of giving up the steal he had accomplished in his first trade as general manager.|$|E
