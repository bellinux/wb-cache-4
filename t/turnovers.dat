40|$|Patterns {{of species}} <b>turnover</b> {{are central to}} the {{geography}} of biodiversity and resulting challenges for conservation, but at broad scales remain relatively little understood. Here, we take a first spatially-explicitly and global perspective to link the spatial <b>turnover</b> of species and environments. We compare how major groups of vertebrate ectotherms (amphibians) and endotherms (birds) respond to spatial environmental gradients. We find that high levels of species <b>turnover</b> occur regardless of environmental <b>turnover</b> rates, but environmental <b>turnover</b> provides a lower bound for species <b>turnover.</b> This lower bound increases more steeply with environmental <b>turnover</b> in tropical realms. While bird and amphibian <b>turnover</b> rates are correlated, the rate of amphibian <b>turnover</b> is four times steeper than bird rates. This is the same factor by which average geographic ranges of birds are larger than those of amphibians. Narrow-ranged birds exhibit rapid rates of species <b>turnover</b> similar to those for amphibians, while wide-ranged birds largely drive the aggregate patterns of avian <b>turnover.</b> We confirm a strong influence of the environment on species <b>turnover</b> that is mediated by range sizes and regional history. In contrast to geographic patterns of species richness, we find that the <b>turnover</b> in one group (amphibians) is a much better predictor for the <b>turnover</b> in another (birds) than is environment. This result confirms the role of amphibian sensitivity to environmental conditions for patterns of <b>turnover</b> and supports their value as a surrogate group.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the factors leading to <b>turnover</b> among sell-side {{financial}} analysts and the consequences of <b>turnover.</b> Design/methodology/approach – The paper identifies two types of <b>turnover,</b> voluntary and involuntary, and defines voluntary (involuntary) as when analysts leave their employment at one brokerage firm and find (do not find) employment at another brokerage firm. Logistic models are estimated relating the probability of <b>turnover</b> to factors that explain <b>turnover</b> for both voluntary and involuntary <b>turnover.</b> Findings – The paper finds that job performance is positively (negatively) related to voluntary (involuntary) <b>turnover.</b> This finding is consistent with Jackofsky's theory predicting U-shaped relationship between performance and <b>turnover.</b> For voluntary <b>turnover,</b> analysts' performance and job conditions at the new brokerage firm are examined and related to the factors leading to <b>turnover.</b> It was found that <b>turnover</b> analysts move to smaller brokerage firms and become more accurate.

40|$|This study builds from context-emergent <b>turnover</b> {{theory to}} examine the dynamic {{properties}} of <b>turnover</b> rates, including: (a) the changing {{quality and quantity of}} the human capital resources that depart, (b) the changing <b>turnover</b> dispersion (i. e., how distributed <b>turnover</b> events are over time), and (c) the changing quality and quantity of replacement hires. We examine these properties using data drawn from a sample of retail employees nested within stores of a prominent U.
