25|$|Egyptian {{president}} Hosni Mubarak's {{national security}} advisor, Osama El-Baz, {{sent a message}} to the U.S. State Department <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> wanted to discuss the accusations that the country {{had weapons of mass destruction}} and ties with Al-Qaeda. Iraq also attempted to reach the U.S. through the Syrian, French, German, and Russian intelligence services.|$|E
25|$|Later on, {{following}} {{the visit of}} several Palestinian dignitaries in Amman, and despite the opposition of Syria and the Mufti, Haj Amin al-Husseini, Azzam Pasha accepted Abdullah's proposition and sent Ismail Safwat to Amman to organize a coordination between the Arab Liberation Army and Jordan's Arab Legion. It was decided that command over the operations would be reserved for King Abdullah, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> would deploy a brigade in Transjordan to prepare for intervention on 15 May.|$|E
25|$|Gulf War I {{was fought}} without the Iraqi Army unleashing {{chemical}} or biological munitions; Eric R. Taylor, of the CATO Institute, maintained that the effective, U.S. threat of nuclear retaliation halted Hussein from employing his chemical weapons. The locations of many of Iraq's chemical stockpiles were never uncovered and there is widespread speculation that U.S. troops were exposed to chemical munitions while destroying weapons caches, particularly near the Khamisiyah storage site. After the war, analysis suggested the chemical defense capabilities of U.S. forces were woefully inadequate {{during and after the}} conflict. In addition, some experts, such as Jonathan B. Tucker, suggest <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> did indeed employ chemical weapons during the war.|$|E
50|$|Today, {{the figure}} mostly {{referred}} to by Kurdish groups, alongside some Western scholars, is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Turkmen make up 2-3% of <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> population, or approximately 500,000-800,000; however, not all Western scholars accept this view, for example, Scott Taylor has suggested <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Turkmen population accounted for 2,080,000 of Iraq's 25 million inhabitants in 2004 whilst Patrick Clawson has stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Turkmen make up about 9% of the total population. Furthermore, international {{organizations such as the}} Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization has stated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Turkmen community is 3 million or 9-13% of <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> population. Iraqi Turkmen claim that their total population is over 3 million. They mainly live in an area called Turkmeneli, which stretches from the northwest to the east at the middle of Iraq. They consider their capital city to be Kirkuk.|$|R
50|$|This shows <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Government under Maliki, and by {{extension}} the US, {{was aware of the}} weaknesses in <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Army, including <b>the</b> fact <b>that</b> many Sunnis had sympathy with the Islamic State, and that many Shia were only there for money. Thus <b>the</b> prevailing narrative <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> government and <b>the</b> international community were shocked, surprised and unprepared for the events of 2014 {{and the rise of the}} Islamic State in Iraq is flawed.|$|R
50|$|On 17 June 2017, <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> {{military}} announced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> {{army and}} Sunni tribal fighters, supported by U.S.-led coalition aircraft, had dislodged ISIL from the al-Waleed border crossing.|$|R
25|$|Trita Parsi, in {{the book}} Treacherous Alliance: The Secret Dealings of Israel, Iran, and the United States, writes that a senior Israeli {{official}} met with {{a representative of the}} Ayatollah Khomeini in France one month prior to the Israeli attack. The source of the assertion is Ari Ben-Menashe, a former Israeli government employee. At the alleged meeting, the Iranians explained details of their 1980 attack on the site, and agreed to let Israeli planes land at an Iranian airfield in Tabriz {{in the case of an}} emergency. While the new Iranian government was officially hostile to Israel, due to both nations having a common enemy (Iraq), and Iranian fears <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> would create an atomic bomb to use on them, they clandestinely worked with Israel to forestall such a development.|$|E
25|$|The initial Arab plans {{called for}} Syrian and Lebanese forces to invade from north while Jordanian and Iraqi forces were to invade from east {{in order to}} meet at Nazareth and then to push forward {{together}} to Haifa. In the south, the Egyptians were to advance and take Tel Aviv. At the Arab League meeting in Damascus on 11–13 May, Abdullah rejected the plan, which served Syrian interests, using the fact his allies were afraid to go to war without his army. He proposed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> attack the Jezreel valley and the Arab Legion enter Ramallah and Nablus and link with the Egyptian army at Hebron, which was more in compliance with his political objective to occupy the territory allocated to the Arab State by the partition plan and promises not to invade the territory allocated to the Jewish State by the partition plan. In addition, Lebanon decided not {{to take part in the}} war at the last minute due to the still influential Christians' opposition and to Jewish bribes.|$|E
500|$|In January 2005, free, {{democratic}} elections {{were held in}} Iraq {{for the first time}} in 50 years. According to Iraqi National Security Advisor Mowaffak al-Rubaie, [...] "This is the greatest day in the history of this country." [...] Bush praised the event as well, saying <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> [...] "have taken rightful control of their country's destiny". This led to the election of Jalal Talabani as President and Nouri al-Maliki as Prime Minister of Iraq. A referendum to approve a constitution in Iraq was held in October 2005, supported by most Shiites and many Kurds.|$|E
50|$|On November 14, it was {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> Army had taken full control of the city, forcing ISIL forces to withdraw.|$|R
50|$|Finally, {{the third}} phase {{would have seen the}} Americans engage <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> in direct combat. Weakened by the initial stages, it was {{predicted}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> military {{would not be able to}} muster much resistance.|$|R

500|$|In 2008 Robert Fisk {{obtained}} a report written in September 2002, for Saddam Hussein's [...] "presidency intelligence office," [...] by Iraq's [...] "Special Intelligence Unit M4." [...] The report said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> had been interrogating Abu Nidal {{in his home}} as a suspected spy for Kuwait and Egypt, and indirectly for the United States. It {{said he had been}} asked by the Kuwaitis to find links between Iraq and Al-Qaeda. Just before being moved to a more secure location, Abu Nidal asked to be allowed to change his clothing, went into his bedroom and shot himself, the report said. He was buried on 29 August 2002 in al-Karakh's Islamic cemetery in Baghdad, in a grave marked M7.|$|E
500|$|On 29 June 2014, it was {{reported}} that Iraq claimed to have received the first batch of second hand Su-25s ordered from Russia in order to fight Sunni rebels of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant. An Iraqi defense ministry source claimed the aircraft would be in service [...] "within three to four days", despite the fact <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> require technical help and parts to make them operational, {{and the fact that the}} Russian made aircraft are incompatible with the Iraqi Air force's inventory of American made Hellfire missiles. [...] The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps Air Force delivered seven Su-25s on 1 July 2014, the majority of which were ex-Iraqi aircraft from the Gulf War.|$|E
500|$|It was {{not until}} 720 <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> rebelled once again, under Yazid ibn al-Muhallab, [...] "the last of the old-style Iraqi champions" [...] (Hugh Kennedy), and even then, support was ambivalent, and the revolt was defeated. Two of Ibn al-Ash'ath's nephews, Muhammad ibn Ishaq and Uthman ibn Ishaq, {{supported}} the rebellion, but most remained quiescent and content with their role as local dignitaries. A few held posts in Kufa under the early Abbasids. Perhaps {{the most famous of}} the family's later members is the philosopher al-Kindi. Another uprising, that of Zayd ibn Ali, broke out in 740, again promising to right injustices (restoration of the ʿaṭāʾ, distribution of the revenue from the Sawad, an end to distant campaigns) and to restore rule according to the Quran and the Sunna. Once more, however, the Kufans deserted it at the critical moment, and it was defeated by the Umayyads. Discontent with the Umayyad government continued to simmer, and during the Abbasid Revolution, Iraq rose up in support of the rebellion. Kufa overthrew Umayyad rule and welcomed the Abbasid army in October 749, followed immediately by the proclamation of as-Saffah as the first Abbasid caliph there.|$|E

500|$|As {{chief of}} staff, Abu Nuwar embraced {{many of the}} pan-Arabist and anti-imperialist ideas of Nasser, who became {{president}} of Egypt in 1956. Abu Nuwar communicated his support for Nasser and the Arab nationalist Ba'ath Party, which was active in Syria and Jordan, during a meeting with Lebanese president and Nasser opponent, Camille Chamoun, in 1956. An American embassy official in Jordan remarked that during a discussion with Abu Nuwar, the latter [...] "out-Nassered Nasser". He was regarded as an [...] "ultranationalist" [...] by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). According to historian Ivan Pearson, American diplomatic and intelligence views were colored by the negative perceptions of Abu Nuwar in Israel and Abu Nuwar's role in the dismissal of Prime Minister Samir al-Rifai in May; Rifai was seen by the Israelis as a counterbalance to Hussein's Arab nationalist advisers, and Abu Nuwar maneuvered to sideline Rifai soon after Glubb's dismissal. Abu Nuwar was a major opponent of Iraq's Hashemite rulers (relatives of Hussein) and that country's pro-British prime minister, Nuri al-Said. Abu Nuwar's opposition was driven by suspicions <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> sought to oust him from his military post, while King Abd al-Ilah and al-Said mutually regarded Abu Nuwar with suspicion. Abu Nuwar's influence with Hussein was likely a major reason Jordan resisted Iraqi attempts to merge the two Hashemite-ruled countries.|$|E

2500|$|In January 2007, Voinovich {{expressed}} concern to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice that the President's plan to increase troop levels in Iraq {{would not be}} effective. Voinovich did not share President George W. Bush's optimism. [...] "At {{this stage of the}} game, I don't think it's going to happen." [...] As a moderate Republican, Voinovich was viewed as one of few that could potentially influence the President. Five months later, Voinovich requested to Bush in a five-page letter that the U.S. begin pulling troops from Iraq and asking <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> start taking care of their own territory, calling for a [...] "comprehensive plan for our country's gradual military disengagement from Iraq".|$|E
2500|$|Public {{perception}} is <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> were confrontational and blocking {{the work of}} the inspectors. In 98% of the inspections, the Iraqis did everything we asked them to because it dealt with disarmament. However when we got into issues of sensitivity, such as coming close to presidential security installations, Iraqis raised a flag and said, [...] "Time out. We got a C.I.A. out there that's trying to kill our president and we're not very happy about giving you access to the most sensitive installations and the most sensitive personalities in Iraq." [...] So we had these modalities, where we agreed that if we came to a site and the Iraqis called it 'sensitive,' we go in with four people.|$|E

2500|$|On the {{execution}} day, Hussein said, [...] "I spent {{my whole life}} fighting the infidels and the intruders, [...] I destroyed the invaders and the Persians." [...] He also stressed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> should fight the Americans and the Persians. Mowaffak al Rubiae, Iraq's National Security adviser, who was a witness to Hussein's execution described him as repeatedly shouting [...] "down with Persians." [...] Hussein built an anti-Iranian monument called Hands of Victory in Baghdad in 1989 to commemorate [...] his declaration of victory over Iran in the Iran-Iraq war (though the war is generally considered a stalemate, if not an Iraqi defeat). After his fall, {{it was reported that}} the new Iraqi government had organized the Committee for Removing Symbols of the Saddam Era and that the Hands of Victory monument had begun to be dismantled. However, the demolition was later halted.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the second}} truce of the war, only three villages remained, located about 20km south of Haifa—Ayn Ghazal, Ijzim and Jaba', dubbed [...] "The Little Triangle". These villages {{had refused to}} let in the Arab Liberation Army during the civil war, but did not ally {{themselves}} with the Jewish forces. During the ten days {{between the first and}} second truce, this triangle enjoyed calm, as the Alexandroni Brigade, responsible for the area, was participating in operations Danny and Betek. Sniper fire from village militiamen effectively closed this road, but by the beginning of the truce they were completely cut off from other Arab forces. The village residents also set up roadblocks and mines, and dug trenches and foxholes along the road. The commander of the triangle was in contact with the Iraqi Army nearby, and there was an Israeli fear <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> would attempt to connect with his forces. The coastal road was the main traffic artery between the central and northern parts of Israel; not having access to it meant that all traffic and supplies had to go east through Wadi Milk, a dangerous route which also passed close to Arab villages.|$|E
2500|$|During the inquiry, British {{ambassador}} David Broucher {{reported a}} conversation with Kelly at a Geneva meeting in February 2003. Broucher related that Kelly said he had assured his Iraqi sources {{that there would be}} no war if they cooperated, and that a war would put him in an [...] "ambiguous" [...] moral position. Broucher had asked Kelly what would happen if Iraq were invaded, and Kelly had replied, [...] "I will probably be found dead in the woods." [...] Broucher then quoted from an email he had sent just after Kelly's death: [...] "I did not think much of this at the time, taking it to be a hint <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> might try to take revenge against him, something that did not seem at all fanciful then. I now see that he may have been thinking on rather different lines." [...] According to an entry in one of Kelly's diaries, discovered afterwards by his daughter Rachel at his home, this meeting did not take place in February 2003, but in February 2002. According to Kelly's half-sister, Sarah Pape, the day after his daughter Ellen's wedding on Saturday 22 February 2003, he flew to New York.
