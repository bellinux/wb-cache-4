5|$|Steven Spielberg, {{one of the}} film's {{executive}} producers, {{visited the}} director and the writers during pre-production <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> the script and the artwork. He provided Favreau {{with a collection of}} classic Western films. Spielberg also invited the director and the writers to a private screening of several Western films and provided live commentary on how to make one properly. The films included Stagecoach, My Darling Clementine, and Destry Rides Again. Spielberg made several other suggestions: a main enemy alien, Jake's final use of the gauntlet being to decapitate an alien, and that Jake and Ella's first kiss should occur in the climax of the film.|$|E
5|$|The local legend {{suggests}} that the Cailleach and her family were given shelter in the glen by the locals and while they stayed there the glen was always fertile and prosperous. When they left they gave the stones to the locals with the promise {{that as long as}} the stones were put out <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> the glen at Bealltainn and put back into the shelter and made secure for the winter at Samhainn then the glen would continue to be fertile.|$|E
5|$|Hard Target was Woo's first American {{film and}} {{was also the first}} major Hollywood film made by a Chinese {{director}}. Universal Pictures was nervous about having Woo direct a feature, and sent in director Sam Raimi <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> the film's production and to take Woo's place as director if he were to fail. Woo went through several scripts finding mostly martial arts films with which he was not interested. After deciding on Chuck Pfarrer's script for Hard Target, Woo wanted to have actor Kurt Russell in the lead role, but found Russell too busy with other projects. Woo then went with Universal's initial choice of having Jean-Claude Van Damme star. Woo got along with Van Damme during filming and raised the amount of action in the film as he knew that Van Damme was up for it.|$|E

Timothy Abernethie, his wife Maude, and Miss Gilchrist, who is now assisting them, come to Enderby. Poirot briefly poses as Monsieur Pontarlier but Rosamund uncovers his guise the first evening. Helen Abernethie telephones Entwhistle {{early the next morning}} with the news that she has realised what struck her odd the day of the funeral. Before she can say more, she is savagely struck on the head.|$|E
25|$|JDRF's role in {{quickening}} {{the development}} and availability of the Artificial Pancreas consists of funding research in order <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> the outcomes of patients using the Artificial Pancreas, keeping close contact with the Food and Drug Administration so that {{the standards of the}} patient are met, advocating for health care coverage of technologies such as the Artificial Pancreas and working to ensure clinical acceptance of technologies such as the Artificial Pancreas. In 2011, JDRF strongly urged the FDA before Congress and in a petition to issue clear and reasonable guidance for an artificial pancreas by December 2011.|$|E

25|$|The video {{begins with}} a shot of a road in Paris and Adele is seen walking on it alone. She {{continues}} to walk and starts singing the song with a sad look as the camera makes circles and shots more locations in Paris including the Eiffel Tower. During the second chorus, Adele stops singing and pauses on the Pont Alexandre III <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> the Seine. She continues walking through the deserted streets during the bridge before finally entering a building in which she sees her ex-lover. After seeing her, he starts to walk away and several shots of Adele looking at him follow.|$|E
25|$|Purcell and Elmslie set {{the house}} thirty feet {{behind the front}} {{property}} line, conserving a sense of privacy for its inhabitants and allowing them <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> their neighbors’ gardens to their north and south, rather than through their windows. Likewise, the Purcells and the neighbors could enjoy the home’s front garden, created in collaboration with landscape architect Harry Franklin Baker, including a reflecting pool with water plants and small fountain, and native plants and trees. The back porch overlooked the Lake of the Isles, where the Purcells could enjoy a secluded natural haven {{in the center of}} Minneapolis, in concordance with Prairie School ideals.|$|E
25|$|The Case Study Final Report is {{the main}} focus so that ideal {{preparation}} may take place.; this report does, after all, contain all the entomological findings and conclusions relevant to the case. The report should be detailed thoroughly, but should still allow room for speculation, because forensic entomology is still a relatively new science, {{and it would be}} a bit overzealous for the forensic entomologist to announce full certainty on the subject; said speculation should not exist when it comes to the evidence. Disclosure of this report to the opposing side before the trial is recommended so that the defense and/or prosecution have time to consult another expert witness <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> the original findings.|$|E

25|$|Shamshi-Adad I (c. 1754 BC – c. 1721 BC), son of Ila-kabkabu, {{inherited}} the throne in Terqa {{from his father}} c. 1785 BC. Shamshi-Adad I was forced to flee to Babylon while Naram-Suen of Eshnunna attacked Ekallatum c. 1761 BC. Shamshi-Adad I conquered Assur, took over the long-abandoned town of Shekhna in north-eastern Syria, converted it into {{the capital city of}} his Upper Mesopotamian Empire, renamed it to Shubat-Enlil, and emerged as the first Amorite king of Assyria c. 1754 BC. Shamshi-Adad I placed his sons in key geographical locations and gave them responsibility <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> those areas. While he remained in Šubat-Enlil, his eldest son, Ishme-Dagan I was put on the throne of Ekallatum.|$|E
25|$|Though {{aware of}} the {{weakness}} of his defense lines, Moreaux {{did not want to}} retreat, possibly because he was masking Jourdan's transfer of troops to the north. Kaiserslautern was held by the division of Jean-Jacques Ambert with eight battalions, a cavalry regiment and two squadrons of chasseurs à cheval. Many of the soldiers were raw recruits and some were not even armed. One of the few veteran battalions was commanded by Nicolas Oudinot. Anxious about the position, Moreaux sent Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr, an adjutant general whose advice he trusted, <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> the ground. Saint-Cyr advised Ambert to retreat but that general had orders to hold his ground though he had only 5,000 troops. Meanwhile, Möllendorf chose to make his main effort against Kaiserslautern.|$|E
25|$|Soon after {{appearing}} in Kingdom Hearts II at Hollow Bastion {{with the other}} Organization XIII members, he is assigned <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> Sora's progress in the Organization's plan, much to his chagrin. Demyx confronts Sora in the Underworld of Olympus Coliseum, stealing a medallion called the Olympus Stone {{to protect him from}} the Underworld's energy-reducing curse. After attempting to talk to Roxas through Sora, Demyx pits him against his water copies, and leaves after losing. Demyx later crosses paths with the protagonists again at Hollow Bastion, and battles them after they enrage him by mocking his nature as a Nobody, but is defeated and fades into darkness. In his first chronological appearance in 358/2 Days, Demyx reluctantly participates in the missions Saix assigns to him out of fear of what Xemnas could do to him.|$|E

25|$|Another {{important}} aspect of street grids {{and the use of}} rectilinear blocks is that traffic flows of either pedestrians, cars, or both, only cross at right angles. This is an important traffic safety feature, since no one entering the intersection needs <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> their shoulder to see oncoming traffic. Any time traffic flows meet at an acute angle, someone cannot see traffic approaching them. The grid is thus a geometric response to our human physiology. It is very likely the original purpose of grid layouts comes from the Athenian Agora. Before the grid organization, markets were laid out randomly in a field with traffic approaches at odd angles. This caused carts and wagons to turn over due to frequent collisions. Laying out the market stalls into regularized rows at right angles solved this problem and was later built into the Athenian Agora and copied ever since.|$|E
25|$|The {{arrest and}} {{extradition}} of Osiel, however, caused for several top lieutenants {{from both the}} Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas to fight over important drug corridors to the United States, especially the cities of Matamoros, Nuevo Laredo, Reynosa, and Tampico—all situated {{in the state of}} Tamaulipas. They also fought for coastal cities Acapulco, Guerrero and Cancún, Quintana Roo; the state capital of Monterrey, Nuevo León, and the states of Veracruz and San Luis Potosí. Through his violence and intimidation, Heriberto Lazcano took control of both Los Zetas and the Gulf Cartel after Cardenas’ extradition. Lieutenants that were once loyal to Cárdenas began following the commands of Lazcano, who tried to reorganize the cartel by appointing several lieutenants to control specific territories. Morales Treviño was appointed <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> Nuevo León; Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez in Matamoros; Héctor Manuel Sauceda Gamboa, nicknamed El Karis, took control of Nuevo Laredo; Gregorio Sauceda Gamboa, known as El Goyo, along with his brother Arturo, took control of the Reynosa plaza; Arturo Basurto Peña, alias El Grande, and Iván Velázquez-Caballero alias El Talibán took control of Quintana Roo and Guerrero; Alberto Sánchez Hinojosa, alias Comandante Castillo, took over Tabasco. However, continual disagreement was leading the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas into an inevitable rupture.|$|E

It {{was the second}} Office episode to be directed by Randall Einhorn, {{a former director of}} Survivor who also worked as the series' director of photography. In early 2007, series co-creator Greg Daniels explained to an audience at Paleyfest that Einhorn's direction had become [...] "a character in the show because [...] has an enormous amount of judgment/leeway about where he's looking. And often [...] adds a tremendous amount of comedy is the choosing <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> there and see what that person thinks and back and forth. He's definitely a hidden character on the show." ...|$|E
500|$|These skills, {{as well as}} his {{tastes and}} talents as a causeur, {{consolidated}} his reputation as an erudite in spite of his lack of formal studies. The cultivation of aesthetic goals had seemingly guided the writer throughout his life—the poet and mathematician Ion Barbu, who was one of Caragiale's greatest admirers, recounted with amazement that the writer would periodically visit the Romanian Academy's just <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> a certain page in a manual of arithmetics outlining the rule of three (he reportedly said to Barbu: [...] "Remembering its splendor provides me with a ceaseless drive to reread it"). At the same time, he was attracted by esotericism, alchemy and mystical subjects such as numerology, all of which form background elements in his prose.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the {{vacation}} season, the Phanceys entrust Viv with looking after the motel for the night before the owner, Mr. Sanguinetti, can arrive to take inventory and close it up for the winter. Two mobsters, [...] "Sluggsy" [...] Morant and Sol [...] "Horror" [...] Horowitz, both of whom work for Sanguinetti, arrive and say they are there <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>over</b> the motel for insurance purposes. The two have been hired by Sanguinetti to burn down the motel so that Sanguinetti can make a profit on the insurance. The blame for the fire would fall on Viv, who was to perish in the incident. The mobsters are cruel to Viv and, when she says she does not want to dance with them, they attack her, holding her down and starting to remove her top. They are about to continue the attack with her rape when the door buzzer interrupts them.|$|E
