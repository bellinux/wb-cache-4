Clayman praised the unique take on the survival horror franchise and the omnipresence of Jigsaw, but criticized the repetitive puzzles and the flawed combat system. Clayman even called the combat the Achilles' heel of the game. He went on to say: Overall, Saw is a welcome entry in the horror genre that provides a good dosage of thrills.

500|$|From the Ages charted at #25 on the Billboard Heatseekers {{chart for}} a week. Critical {{reaction}} to the album was largely positive, though the album's length was commonly cited as a minor flaw. Metacritic reported a score of 84 based on five reviews, indicating [...] "Universal acclaim". [...] "Though the silence may have been deafening for their small but devoted cadre of fans, the wait was worth every moment," [...] wrote Erik Highter for PopMatters, who described the chemistry between the band members as [...] "near telepathic connections between the players" [...] and the roles of Eginton and Rubalcaba as [...] "pulling" [...] Mitchell back from potential unrestrained solos. He rated the album 8 out of 10, his only complaint being that listeners may consider the title track too long. Conversely, Grayson Currin of Pitchfork Media said that the rhythm section did not serve to restrain Mitchell at times, but to [...] "instead follow his ecstatic lead everywhere, fellow travelers on his odyssey of enthusiasms". He echoed Highter's opinion {{with respect to the}} title track's length, calling it [...] "the one moment [...] where the band's patience might <b>test</b> <b>your</b> own" [...] and asked, regarding the length and repetitive nature of the album as a whole, [...] "is there a need for an hour of three dudes tracing and retracing a melody?" [...] The length of [...] "From the Ages" [...] was also criticized by Exclaim! reviewer Trystan MacDonald who cited it as the record's [...] "only flaw" [...] and rated the album overall 8 out of 10.|$|E

[...] When Langdell developed the original law school curriculum, Harvard University President Charles Eliot told him to make it [...] "hard and long." [...] The school's competitive culture gave rise to the urban legend of a dean at the school telling incoming students, [...] "Look to your left, look to your right, because one of you won't be here {{by the end of the}} year."

2500|$|Brain {{replacement}} scenario:In this, we {{are asked}} to imagine that engineers have invented a tiny computer that simulates the action of an individual neuron. What would happen if we replaced one neuron at a time? Replacing one would clearly do nothing to change conscious awareness. Replacing all of them would create a digital computer that simulates a brain. If Searle is right, then conscious awareness must disappear during the procedure (either gradually or all at once). Searle's critics argue {{that there would be}} no point during the procedure when he can claim that conscious awareness ends and mindless simulation begins. Searle predicts that, while going through the brain prosthesis, [...] "you find, to your total amazement, that you are indeed losing control of you external behavior. You find, for example, that when doctors <b>test</b> <b>your</b> vision, you hear them say 'We are holding up a red object in front of you; please tell us what you see.' You want to cry out 'I can't see anything. I'm going totally blind.' But you hear your voice saying in a way that is completely out your control, 'I see a red object in front of me.' [...] our conscious experience slowly shrinks to nothing, while your externally observable behavior remains the same." [...] This response, however, is impossible, as identical signals would be sent to the remaining organic regions of the brain as would be sent under normal circumstances, by the definition of the behavior of the hypothetical computers.

2500|$|While the bus {{was leaving}} San Fernando, the bus driver saw at a {{distance}} that there were several trucks blocking the highway up ahead, {{and that there were}} several men wearing ski-masks and holding AR-15s. The gunmen ordered the bus to stop, and the bus driver obeyed. The cartel members approached the bus pointing their guns and yelling, [...] "Open the door, asshole! Move, you son of a bitch, unless you want me to shoot you dead." [...] The chauffeur, trembling, opened the door for the gunmen, who quickly stormed the bus as soon as the door was opened. [...] "You are all fucked," [...] yelled one of the gunmen to the people on board; the passengers were frightened, and some of them cried, thinking it was simply a regular armed robbery. But {{that was not the case}} this time. The cartel members then ordered the bus driver to drive the bus deep into a dirt road for about ten kilometers before reaching a plain area, [...] "in the middle of nowhere." [...] In the area there were about twenty luxurious trucks and three passenger buses, some of them with bullet holes, flat tires, and broken windows. The driver was then ordered to stop the bus, and all the men were then told to descend from the vehicle. They were asked to form a line, and the cartel members began to organize them from youngest to oldest and from strongest to weakest. Those who looked old or weak were separated from the group, tied from their feet, and then taken elsewhere. Those who were left were ordered to take off their shirts and remain where they were. A man wearing black military uniform, a bulletproof vest, and a kit belt was called from the trucks that were parked nearby. All of the triggermen referred to him as Commander 40, better known as Miguel Treviño Morales, one of the top leaders of Los Zetas. The man approached the passengers that were lined up in front of him, and said in an energetic voice: [...] "Let's see, assholes. Who wants to live?" [...] But no one answered. One teenager accidentally wet himself out of nervousness, and Commander 40 killed him with a shot to the head. Treviño Morales then yelled: [...] "I will ask all of you one more time. Who the fuck wants to live?" [...] All of the men raised their hands. [...] "Good. We will <b>test</b> <b>your</b> abilities to see how capable you are. If you make it, you'll survive; if you do not, you're fucked." [...] Commander 40 then asked his henchmen to bring the bats and clubs, and each of the passengers was given one. He then said, [...] "Look, each of you will get in pairs and beat the shit out of each other. Those who survive will work for Los Zetas, those who don't, well, they're fucked." [...] All of the passengers were shocked at the order the individual in front of them gave them. Everyone got their bats and clubs, joined up as a pair, and stared at their partners nervously. Treviño Morales then said: [...] "Now beat the shit out of each other." ...|$|E
