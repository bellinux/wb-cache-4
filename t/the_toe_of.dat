5|$|A {{parasitic}} fly, Lucilia bufonivora, attacks adult common toads. It lays its eggs on the toad's {{skin and}} when these hatch, the larvae crawl into the toad's nostrils and eat its flesh internally with lethal consequences. The European fingernail clam (Sphaerium corneum) {{is unusual in}} that it can climb up water plants and move around on its muscular foot. It sometimes clings to <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> a common toad and this {{is believed to be}} one of the means by which it disperses to new locations.|$|E
5|$|Kohala had two active rift zones, a {{characteristic}} common to Hawaiian volcanoes. The double ridge, shaped axially, {{was active in}} both the shield and postshield stages. The southeast rift zone passes under the nearby Mauna Kea and reappears further southeast in the Hilo Ridge, {{as indicated by the}} relationship between collected lava samples. In addition, the two features align to one another more closely then does the ridge to Mauna Kea, of which it was once thought to constitute a part. The bulk of the ridge is built of volcanic rock with reverse magnetic polarity, evidence that the volcano is at least 780,000years old. Older lava dated from <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> the ridge was estimated to be roughly between 1.1 and 1.2million years old.|$|E

25|$|The indoor cricket pull shot is an attacking stroke {{played to}} {{deliveries}} pitched short and on or outside leg/middle stump.

The pull shot is usually played off the front foot, with the bat horizontal to pitch and <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> the bat facing towards the bowler. The bat is swung in a downward motion, hitting the ball in front of the body.|$|E
50|$|The Kickback is {{a really}} old {{freestyle}} trick, involving a half flip backwards and then a {{one and a half}} flips forwards. It is done by placing your front foot on the front bolts and <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> back foot along the heelside edge in the middle of your board. You start pushing down on <b>the</b> <b>toes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> back foot and when the board catches your toes, you jump, kick the board forwards, and catch it on the grip tape.|$|R

25|$|Some soldiers, {{including}} later Imperial {{portraits in}} military dress, show boots nearly reaching the knee - red for the Emperor. In the Imperial Regalia of the Holy Roman Emperors there are shoes or slippers in Byzantine style made in Palermo before 1220.

They are lavishly decorated with pearls and jewels and gold scrollwork on the sides and over <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> the shoe. More practical footwear was no doubt worn on less formal occasions.|$|E
25|$|Sangiovese {{was already}} well {{known by the}} 16th century. Recent DNA {{profiling}} by José Vouillamoz of the Istituto Agrario di San Michele all’Adige suggests that Sangiovese's ancestors are Ciliegiolo and Calabrese Montenuovo. The former is well known as an ancient variety in Tuscany, the latter is an almost-extinct relic from the Calabria, <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> Italy. At least fourteen Sangiovese clones exist, of which Brunello {{is one of the}} best regarded. An attempt to classify the clones into Sangiovese grosso (including Brunello) and Sangiovese piccolo families has gained little evidential support.|$|E

25|$|The first score {{came on a}} punt off <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> Flournoy. Vanderbilt drove {{all the way to}} Tulane's 7-yard line before four {{unsuccessful}} runs at Tulane's line by Rountree {{gave the}} Greenbacks the ball back deep in their territory. On the ensuing punt, Tulane's line was broken by Tom Ryan, Bob Rives, Bo Rowland, and Lynn Bomar. Bomar blocked the kick. In the ensuing scramble, Alf Sharpe dove to recover the football in the end zone. The second came when Lynn Bomar helped Vanderbilt run to the 33-yard line, where Wakefield drop kicked a field goal. After this Tulane drove right down to Vanderbilt's 5-yard line when the whistle sounded to end the half.|$|E
25|$|In coxless pairs, quadruple sculls and coxless fours, {{one of the}} rowers will be {{designated}} to steers. They will control the rudder using lines attached to <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> one shoe, which pivots around the ball of the foot. The rower who steers is chosen according to experience {{and the nature of}} the course on which the boat is rowing: bow has a clear view ahead when looking over one's shoulder, whereas stroke may be able to steer well on a straight course by pointing the stern at a reference point. A rower steering in the middle of a four or quad is not uncommon, since bow and stroke have other duties already.|$|E
25|$|In a gravity dam, {{the force}} that holds the dam in place against the push from the water is Earth's gravity pulling down on {{the mass of the}} dam. The water presses {{laterally}} (downstream) on the dam, tending to overturn the dam by rotating about its toe (a point at the bottom downstream side of the dam). The dam's weight counteracts that force, tending to rotate the dam the other way about its toe. The designer ensures that the dam is heavy enough that the dam's weight wins that contest. In engineering terms, that is true whenever the resultant of the forces of gravity acting on the dam and water pressure on the dam acts in a line that passes upstream of <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> the dam.|$|E

25|$|The Allied {{invasion}} of Italy started when the British Eighth Army landed in <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> Italy on 3 September 1943, in Operation Baytown. The Italian government signed the surrender the same day, believing {{they would be}} given time to make preparations against the anticipated German intervention. The Allies announced the Armistice of Cassibile on 8 September and German forces implemented plans to occupy the Italian peninsula. On 9 September, American and British forces of the US Fifth Army landed at Salerno in Operation Avalanche and more British airborne troops landed at Taranto in Operation Slapstick. German forces which had escaped from Sicily were concentrated against Avalanche, while additional forces were brought in to occupy Rome and disarm the Italian Army in central and northern Italy.|$|E
25|$|A back march may be {{used when}} the band wishes {{to move in the}} {{opposite}} direction from where it is projecting its sound. There are several ways to back march, one of which is to walk backwards, putting each foot down and rolling from the toe to the heel (the exact reverse of the roll step). Another variation involves marching on the platforms of the feet, dragging <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> the moving foot on the ground. Backwards marching usually employs the same preference for leg straightness as forward marching (if the band marches with legs completely straight while marching forwards, they also do so while marching backwards, to preserve uniformity of style). Using peripheral vision to align oneself to formations or field markings is even more important during backward marching.|$|E
25|$|The name Clayoquot (pronounced “Clah-quot”) is an anglicized {{version of}} Tla-o-qui-aht, the largest {{nation in the}} Nuu-chah-nulth (Nootka) First Nations, whose people have resided in the Clayoquot Sound region near Tofino and Ucluelet {{for at least the}} last 2000 years. The Clayoquot Slope site lies about 1250 m below sea level and {{approximately}} 20km landward of <b>the</b> <b>toe</b> <b>of</b> the Cascadia subduction zone. The Cascadia subduction zone is the area at which the Juan de Fuca plate is subducting (descending) beneath the North American plate. This is a zone where much of the thick layer of sediments deposited on the eastern flank of the Juan de Fuca Ridge are scraped off and accreted as the tectonic plates converge (move together). As sediments thicken and compact from accretion, pore waters are expelled from the sediment, and gases — primarily biogenic methane — contribute to the formation of gas hydrates in the upper few hundred metres of the sediment. At this site, a cold vent, known as Bullseye Vent, has formed along with significant concentrations of gas hydrates.|$|E
