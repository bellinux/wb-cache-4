5|$|It is a hardy breed, {{and can be}} stubborn, {{leading to}} issues with {{training}}. A Westie may need to have its training refreshed on occasion during its lifetime. Having a typical terrier prey drive, {{it tends to be}} highly interested in toys, especially chasing balls. It does retain the instincts of an earth-dog, including inquisitive and investigative traits, as well as natural instincts to both bark and dig holes. It is ranked 47th in Stanley Coren's <b>The</b> <b>Intelligence</b> <b>of</b> Dogs.|$|E
5|$|Like many working dogs, the Australian Cattle Dog {{has high}} energy levels, an active mind, and {{a level of}} independence. The breed ranks 10th in Stanley Coren's <b>The</b> <b>Intelligence</b> <b>of</b> Dogs, rated {{as one of the}} most {{intelligent}} dogs ranked by obedience command trainability. The Cattle Dog needs plenty of exercise, companionship and a job to do, so a non-working dog might participate in dog sports, learning tricks, or other activities that engage its body and mind.|$|E
5|$|More {{contentious}} {{than the}} lower house was {{the question of the}} upper house. Few agreed with Madison that its members should be elected by {{the lower house}}. James Wilson suggested election by popular vote versus election by state legislature, but his proposal was shot down 10–1 by the delegates. Most delegates didn't question <b>the</b> <b>intelligence</b> <b>of</b> the voters, rather what concerned them was the slowness by which information spread in the late 18th century.|$|E

5|$|The steady {{temperament}} of Labradors {{and their}} ability to learn make them an ideal breed for search and rescue, detection, and therapy work. They are a very intelligent breed. They are ranked No. 7 in Stanley Coren's <b>The</b> <b>Intelligence</b> <b>of</b> Dogs. The AKC describes the breed as an ideal family and sporting dog. Their primary working role in the field continues to be that of a hunting retriever.|$|E
5|$|Beagles are {{intelligent}} but, as {{a result}} of being bred for the long chase, are single-minded and determined, which can make them hard to train. They can be difficult to recall once they have picked up a scent, and are easily distracted by smells around them. They do not generally feature in obedience trials; while they are alert, respond well to food-reward training, and are eager to please, they are easily bored or distracted. They are ranked 72nd in Stanley Coren's <b>The</b> <b>Intelligence</b> <b>of</b> Dogs, as Coren places them among the group with the lowest degree of working/obedience intelligence. Coren's scale, however, does not assess understanding, independence, or creativity.|$|E
5|$|The Field Spaniel {{can be a}} {{good family}} dog while it has a job to do. They are {{suitable}} for dog agility and hunting. Without some sort of purpose, the dog can often try to amuse itself and cause mischief. However, they are patient with children and like to stay close to their family. When socialised, they are good with other dogs. They are generally docile and independent, and are not as excitable as Cocker Spaniels. Stanley Coren's <b>The</b> <b>Intelligence</b> <b>of</b> Dogs lists the breed as being above average in working intelligence.|$|E

5|$|Compared {{to other}} hyenas, the spotted hyena shows a greater {{relative}} amount of frontal cortex which {{is involved in}} the mediation of social behavior. Studies strongly suggest convergent evolution in spotted hyena and primate intelligence. A study done by evolutionary anthropologists demonstrated that spotted hyenas outperform chimpanzees on cooperative problem-solving tests; captive pairs of spotted hyenas were challenged to tug two ropes in unison to earn a food reward, successfully cooperating and learning the maneuvers quickly without prior training. Experienced hyenas even helped inexperienced clan-mates to solve the problem. In contrast, chimps and other primates often require extensive training, and cooperation between individuals is not always as easy for them. <b>The</b> <b>intelligence</b> <b>of</b> the spotted hyena was attested to by Dutch colonists in 19th-century South Africa, who noted that hyenas were exceedingly cunning and suspicious, particularly after successfully escaping from traps. Spotted hyenas seem to plan on hunting specific species in advance; hyenas have been observed to indulge in activities such as scent marking before setting off to hunt zebras, a behaviour which does not occur when they target other prey species. Also, spotted hyenas have been recorded to utilise deceptive behaviour, including giving alarm calls during feeding when no enemies are present, thus frightening off other hyenas and allowing them to temporarily eat in peace. Similarly, mothers will emit alarm calls in attempting to interrupt attacks on their cubs by other hyenas.|$|E
