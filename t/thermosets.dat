25|$|<b>Thermosets,</b> or {{thermosetting}} polymers, can melt {{and take}} shape only once: {{after they have}} solidified, they stay solid. In the thermosetting process, a chemical reaction occurs that is irreversible. The vulcanization of rubber {{is an example of}} a thermosetting process: before heating with sulfur, the polyisoprene is a tacky, slightly runny material; after vulcanization, the product is rigid and non-tacky.|$|E
25|$|Red {{phosphorus}} {{can be used}} as a {{very effective}} flame retardant, especially in thermoplastics (e.g. polyamide) and <b>thermosets</b> (e.g. epoxy resins or polyurethanes). The flame retarding effect is based on the formation of polyphosphoric acid. Together with the organic polymer material, this acid creates a char which prevents the propagation of the flames. The safety risks associated with phosphine generation and friction sensitivity of red phosphorus can be effectively reduced by stabilization and micro-encapsulation. For easier handling, red phosphorus is often used in form of dispersions or masterbatches in various carrier systems.|$|E

500|$|Plastics are {{generally}} {{divided into two}} categories, which are [...] "thermosets" [...] and [...] "thermoplastics." [...] A thermoset is a plastic in which a chemical reaction sets the molecular bonds after first forming the plastic, and then the bonds cannot be broken again without degrading the plastic. <b>Thermosets</b> cannot be melted, therefore, once a thermoset has set {{it is impossible to}} weld it. Examples of <b>thermosets</b> include epoxies, silicone, vulcanized rubber, polyester, and polyurethane.|$|E
500|$|Most polymers, {{sometimes}} referred to as resins, may be used, including all thermoplastics, some <b>thermosets,</b> and some elastomers. Since 1995, the total number of available materials for injection moulding has increased at a rate of 750 per year; there were approximately 18,000 materials available when that trend began. [...] Available materials include alloys or blends of previously developed materials, so product designers can choose the material with the best set of properties from a vast selection. [...] Major criteria for selection of a material are the strength and function required for the final part, as well as the cost, but also each [...] material has different parameters for moulding that must be taken into account. Common polymers like epoxy and phenolic are examples of thermosetting plastics while nylon, polyethylene, and polystyrene are thermoplastic. Until comparatively recently, plastic springs were not possible, but advances in polymer properties make them now quite practical. Applications include buckles for anchoring and disconnecting the outdoor-equipment webbing.|$|E
500|$|For <b>thermosets,</b> {{typically}} {{two different}} chemical components are {{injected into the}} barrel. These components immediately begin irreversible chemical reactions which eventually crosslinks the material into a single connected network of molecules. As the chemical reaction occurs, the two fluid components permanently transform into a viscoelastic solid. [...] Solidification in the injection barrel and screw can be problematic and have financial repercussions; therefore, minimising the thermoset curing within the barrel is vital. This typically means that the residence time and temperature of the chemical precursors are minimised in the injection unit. The residence time can be reduced by minimising the barrel's volume capacity and by maximising the cycle times. These factors {{have led to the}} use of a thermally isolated, cold injection unit that injects the reacting chemicals into a thermally isolated hot mould, which increases the rate of chemical reactions and results in shorter time required to achieve a solidified thermoset component. After the part has solidified, valves close to isolate the injection system and chemical precursors, and the mould opens to eject the moulded parts. Then, the mould closes and the process repeats.|$|E

50|$|The {{research}} {{group led by}} Ludwik Leibler demonstrated the operating principle of vitrimers at the example of epoxy <b>thermosets.</b> Epoxy <b>thermosets</b> can be represented as vitrimers, when transesterification reactions can be introduced and controlled. In the studied system as hardeners must be used carboxylic acids or carboxylic acid anhydrides. A topology change is possible by transesterification reactions. These transesterification reactions do not affect the number of links or the (average) functionality of the polymer. By that the polymer can flow like a viscoelastic liquid at high temperatures. When the temperature is lowered, the transesterification reactions are slowed down, until they finally freeze (be immeasurably slow). Below this point vitrimers behave like normal, classical <b>thermosets.</b> The shown case-study polymers did offered a elastic modulus of 1 MPa to 100 MPa, depending on the bonding network density.|$|E
