50|$|In {{addition}} to the added radar capability, the Ticonderoga-class ships built after USS Thomas S. Gates included two Mark 41 Vertical Launching Systems (VLS). The two VLS allow the ship to have 122 missile storage and launching tubes that can carry {{a wide variety of}} missiles, including the Tomahawk cruise missile, Standard surface-to-air missile, Evolved Sea Sparrow surface-to-air missile, and ASROC antisubmarine warfare (ASW) guided rockets. More importantly, the VLS enables all missiles to be on full stand-by at any given time, shortening the warship's response time before firing. The original five ships (Ticonderoga, Yorktown, Vincennes, Valley Forge, and Thomas S. Gates) had Mark 26 twin-arm launchers that limited their missile capacity to a total of 88 missiles, and that could not fire the Tomahawk missile. After the end of the Cold War, the lower capabilities of the original five warships limited them to duties close to the home waters of the United States. These ships' superstructures were a modification of that on the Spruance-class destroyers, and were required to support two deck-houses (one forward for antennas forward and starboard), and the aft deck-house housed the aft and port antenna arrays. All Aegis cruisers are almost identical, {{with the exception of the}} Mk 26 GMLS, replaced by the Mk 41 VLS systems. The later Arleigh Burke-class Aegis destroyers are designed from-the-keel-up to carry the SPY-1D radars, and have them all clustered together on the forward deck-house, saving space and weight and simplifying cooling requirements. Radar support equipment is closer together, minimizing cable runs and concentrating support equipment. Standard missile loadout for a <b>Ticonderoga</b> <b>cruiser</b> is 80 SM-2 SAMs, 16 ASROC anti-submarine rockets, and 26 Tomahawk cruise missiles.|$|E

With the Mark 26, two missiles could be on the rails and it could sustain a 9-second firing rate with a one-second salvo delay.

The scope of the {{analysis}} focused on the <b>Ticonderoga</b> Class <b>Cruisers</b> - the surface combatants with {{the least amount of}} configuration differences among the class. This project was conducted with the sponsorship and assistance of Commander Naval Surface Forces (CNSF). The goal of this project is to provide CNSF with underlying causes which explain lower expenditures for LANTFLT than PACFLT in the sub accounts of Other Consumable (SO), Repair (SR), and Administrative (SX). Due to levels of data available and the proportion of total expenditures that each sub-account represented, the emphasis of the analysis was concentrated on the Other Consumable and the Repair Parts Sub-accounts. The project developed a methodology to analyze expenditures within the cruiser class by three different levels; the sub-account level, the expense element level, and the system level.

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} the financial feasibility of implementing a recycling program onboard U. S. Naval Combatants. Numerous laws and international agreements provide {{the impetus for}} the Navy to make drastic changes in its solid waste management practices. This study focuses primarily on revenues generated from the sale of aluminum and tin, as they compose the most significant portions of a ship's recyclable waste stream. Specific factors investigated include storage limitations, sanitation concerns, manpower issues, cost constraints, lack of training, lack of incentives, tangible benefits, and perceived benefits. Research was conducted onboard four classes of U. S. Naval Combatants: Arleigh Burke Class Destroyers, Oliver Hazard Perry Class Frigates, Spruance Class Destroyers, and <b>Ticonderoga</b> Class <b>Cruisers.</b> Usage data for both tin and aluminum were gathered from each ship type to determine required storage volumes and potential revenues from the sale of the recyclables. A thorough space inspection was conducted of each ship type to ascertain potential storage spaces and their suitability for temporary storage while underway. Specific findings are that there is adequate storage room aboard these ships, that crews' quality of life will not be sacrificed, and that there exists potential for significant revenues by selling the recyclable cans, all of which are retained by the ship. More generally, it is shown that it is cost-effective to implement an aluminum and tin recycling program onboard U. S. Naval Combatants. NANAU. S. Navy (U. S. N.) author...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThis project {{was conducted with}} the sponsorship and assistance of Commander Naval Surface Forces (COMNAVSURFOR). The purpose of this project was to analyze the Continuous Monitoring Program (CMP) and the data reported therein {{as compared to the}} Budget Operating Target Report (BOR). The analysis focused on the <b>Ticonderoga</b> Class <b>Cruisers</b> and Oliver Hazard Perry Class Frigates. The analysis was designed to provide COMNAVSURFOR with the possible reasons for differences in financial reporting between the CMP and BOR and provide COMNAVSURFOR the opportunity to increase financial reporting timeliness, accuracy, and completeness of the surface fleet. A methodology was developed to analyze financial reporting within the cruiser and frigate classes at five different levels: timeliness of BOR submissions, timeliness of and CMP submissions, grant accuracy, balance accuracy, and fund code use and accuracy. The cruisers and frigates were classified into groups based on their hull type, fleet, and homeport to see if there were relationships within the different groupings. A Beta Test was run on six ships for two months, which tested the recommended alternatives to financial reporting and evaluated the effectiveness of these changes. The results were that the Beta Test ships experienced a 42. 78 percent increase in reporting accuracy by using these alternatives. The potential benefits of implementing these alternatives to COMNAVSURFOR should provide the opportunity to increase financial reporting timeliness, accuracy, and completeness by the surface fleet, thereby creating the opportunity to redistribute financial resources to lessen shortfalls.

50|$|The SAMPSON uses two planar arrays {{to provide}} {{coverage}} over {{only part of}} the sky; complete coverage is provided by rotating the arrays, essentially similar to the way conventional radar systems operate. This is in contrast to the US AN/SPY-1 system (as used on the <b>Ticonderoga</b> class <b>cruiser</b> and Arleigh Burke class destroyer) or the Dutch/German/Canadian APAR system (as used on the Royal Dutch Navy's De Zeven Provinciën class frigates, the German Navy's Sachsen class frigates, and the Royal Danish Navy's Ivar Huitfeldt class frigates), which use multiple arrays fixed in place to provide continuous coverage of the entire sky. Whilst this may seem to be a disadvantage, the SAMPSON radar rotates at 30 revolutions per minute, with two back-to-back arrays, meaning no part of the sky lacks coverage for more than one half second on average - the precise time varies as the beams can also be swept back and forth electronically. In addition, the use of a smaller number of arrays allows the system to be much lighter, allowing placement of the arrays {{at the top of a}} prominent mast rather than on the side of the superstructure as in the US ships. Placing any radar emitter at higher altitude extends the horizon distance, improving performance against low level targets (see Sea skimming); SAMPSON is at approximately double the height above the waterline than the arrays of its US equivalents. Although precise details of the SAMPSON's performance in this regard are unlikely to enter the public domain, such factors may mitigate the disadvantages of fewer arrays.Some tasks are difficult to combine, for example (long range) volume search takes a lot of radar resources, leaving little room for other tasks such as targeting. Combining volume search with other tasks also results either in slow search rates or in low overall quality per task. Driving parameters in radar performance is time-on-target or observation time per beam. This is perhaps a the sic key reason why the Royal Navy selected the S1850M Long Range Radar to complement Sampson on the Type 45 destroyers. It is also a reason why NATO in its NATO Anti-Air Warfare System study (NAAWS) defined the preferred AAW system as consisting of a complementary Volume Search Radar and MFR. This - as NATO points out - gives the added advantage that the two systems can use two different radar frequencies; one being a good choice for long range search, the other a good choice for an MFR (which is especially nice as physics makes both tasks difficult to combine).|$|R
