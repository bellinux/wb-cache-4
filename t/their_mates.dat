5|$|This species' call is a distinctive, plaintive cooOOoo-woo-woo-woooo, {{uttered by}} males to attract females, {{and may be}} mistaken for the call of an owl at first. (Close up, a grating or throat-rattling sound may be heard {{preceding}} the first coo.) Other sounds include a nest call (cooOOoo) by paired males to attract <b>their</b> <b>mates</b> to the nest sites, a greeting call (a soft ork) by males upon rejoining <b>their</b> <b>mates,</b> and an alarm call (a short roo-oo) by either male or female when threatened. In flight, the wings make a fluttery whistling sound {{that is hard to}} hear. The wing whistle is much louder and more noticeable upon take-off and landing.|$|E
5|$|Clutches contain {{between two}} and six eggs, {{typically}} three or four. Variation in clutch size depends {{on the amount of}} food available for young birds. Presumably owing to the greater availability of food, clutches are larger during the peak of the breeding season, and in more southern latitudes of the Cape sparrow's range. Both birds of a pair incubate the eggs during the day, switching every ten or fifteen minutes. At night, only the female incubates the eggs, while the male roosts outside or in the nest. In pairs breeding outside of colonies, birds leave the nest to make room for <b>their</b> <b>mates</b> upon hearing <b>their</b> <b>mates</b> approaching. Among colonial pairs, the incubating bird waits until its partner arrives in the nest, to prevent other birds from entering the nest. Incubation seems to begin before the clutch is complete, and lasts 12–24days.|$|E
5|$|Female rodents play {{an active}} role in {{choosing}} <b>their</b> <b>mates.</b> Factors that contribute to female preference may include the size, dominance and spatial ability of the male. In the eusocial naked mole rats, a single female monopolizes mating from at least three males.|$|E

5|$|Female {{birds have}} sperm storage {{mechanisms}} that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species. Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism. For females, possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against {{the possibility of}} infertility in her mate. Males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard <b>their</b> <b>mates</b> to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise.|$|E
5|$|Females of P. labiata and P. schultzi try to {{kill and}} eat <b>their</b> <b>mates</b> during or after copulation, by {{twisting}} and lunging. The males wait until the females have hunched their legs, making this attack less likely. Males also try to abseil from a silk thread to approach from above, but females may manoeuvre to get the higher position. If the female moves at all, the male leaps and runs away.|$|E
5|$|As {{the years}} pass, the rural area {{gives way to}} a more {{urbanized}} setting. New buildings and highways spring up, more housing developments are built, and the farmers are pushed out. Though much of the wildlife has left and hunting grows increasingly difficult, Tod stays because it is his home range. The other foxes that remain become unhealthy scavengers, and their natures changelife-bonds with <b>their</b> <b>mates</b> are replaced by promiscuity, couples going their separate ways once the mating act is over. The Master has lost most of his own land, and the only dog he owns now is Copper. Each winter they still hunt Tod, and {{in an odd way}} he looks forward to it as the only aspect of his old life that remains.|$|E

5|$|The closest {{relatives}} of mantises are the termites and cockroaches (Blattodea), {{which are all}} within the superorder Dictyoptera. Mantises are sometimes confused with stick insects (Phasmatodea), other elongated insects such as grasshoppers (Orthoptera), or other insects with raptorial forelegs such as mantisflies (Mantispidae). Mantises are mostly ambush predators, but a few ground-dwelling species are found actively pursuing their prey. They normally live for about a year. In cooler climates, the adults lay eggs in autumn, then die. The eggs are protected by their hard capsules and hatch in the spring. Females sometimes practice sexual cannibalism, eating <b>their</b> <b>mates</b> after copulation.|$|E
5|$|They harass smaller raptors such as swamp harriers, {{whistling}} kites, brahminy kites and ospreys, {{forcing them}} to drop any food that they are carrying. Other birds victimised include silver and Pacific gulls, cormorants and Australasian gannets. There is one record of a white-bellied sea eagle seizing a gannet when unsuccessful in obtaining its prey. They may even steal food from their own species, including <b>their</b> <b>mates.</b> The white-bellied sea eagle attacks these birds by striking them with outstretched talons from above or by flying upside down underneath the smaller predator and snatching the prey, all the while screeching shrilly. Southern fur seals have also been targeted for their fish.|$|E
5|$|Drumming {{is a form}} of non-vocal {{communication}} used by {{most species}} of woodpecker and involves the bill being repeatedly struck on a hard surface with great rapidity. After a pause, the drum roll is repeated, each species having a pattern which is unique in the number of beats in the roll, the length of the roll, the length of the gap between rolls and the cadence. The drumming is mainly a territorial call, equivalent to the song of a passerine, with male birds drumming more frequently than females. Woodpeckers choose a surface that resonates, such as a hollow tree, and may use man-made structures such as gutters and downpipes. Drumming serves for the mutual recognition of conspecifics and plays a part in courtship rituals. Individual birds are thought to be able to distinguish the drumming of <b>their</b> <b>mates</b> and that of their neighbours.|$|E

40|$|Religion {{teaching}} {{is connected with}} the forms of such as the freedom of choosing, deciding, and doing or not doing something in positive way. Unfortunately, the freedom often causes the problem in implementation, such as the freedom of choosing or deciding the mate that often ends {{in the practice of}} force marriage. It is a relational problem between parents and their children in deciding <b>their</b> children’s <b>mate</b> because both of them keep their wish stubbornly that claim as their rights. Their parents think that they has authority in deciding <b>their</b> <b>mate</b> to <b>their</b> children because they think ijbar right is theirs.

5|$|Female loggerheads first {{reproduce}} {{between the}} ages of 17 and 33, and their mating period may last more than six weeks. They court <b>their</b> <b>mates,</b> but these behaviors have not been thoroughly examined. Male forms of courtship behavior include nuzzling, biting, and head and flipper movements. Studies suggest females produce cloacal pheromones to indicate reproductive ability. Before mating, the male approaches a female and attempts to mount her, while she resists. Next, the male and female begin to circle each other. If the male has competitors, the female may let the males struggle with each other. The winner then mounts the female; the male's curved claws usually damage the shoulders of the female's shell during this process. Other courting males bite the male while he is attempting to copulate, damaging his flippers and tail, possibly exposing bones. Such damage can cause the male to dismount and may require weeks to heal.|$|E
5|$|If a P. schultzi female is mature, a male P. schultzi {{will try}} to copulate with her, or cohabit with a subadult female and copulate while she is moulting. They usually mate on a web or on a {{dragline}} made by the female, and P. schultzi typically copulates for about 100seconds, while others in the genus can take several minutes or even several hours. Females try to kill and eat <b>their</b> <b>mates</b> during or after copulation, and subadult females mimic adult females to attract males as prey. Contests between Portia females are violent, and embraces in P. schultzi typically take 20 to 60seconds. Sometimes, one female knocks the other {{on her back and}} the other may be killed and eaten if she does not right herself quickly and run way. When hunting, P. schultzi mature females emit olfactory signals that reduce the risk that any other females, males, or juveniles of the same species may contend for the same prey.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, the Newton {{brothers}} {{suggested that}} the carpal knobs may have been formed through continuous injuries, as they resemble diseased bone. It has also been claimed that the carpal knobs were instead formed due to a hereditary disease caused by inbreeding. This was dismissed in a 2013 study, since such lesions would likely not occur only in a specific part of the skeleton, but would appear in any growing bone tissue. If such a disease was due to inbreeding, {{it would also be}} present in other isolated island bird populations, but it is not. The authors instead {{suggested that the}} wing bones contained metaplastic tissue able to form the knob. This development was either in response to continuous impacts during combat, or to hormones released when individuals paired up and acquired territories. It appears a male which had long held a territory would possess especially large carpal knobs, and that <b>their</b> <b>mates</b> would have such developments as well, only smaller.|$|E

5000|$|Toadfish {{make up a}} {{large portion}} of the dolphin's diet. More {{specifically}} 13%. Scientific experiments have shown that the mating call of the toadfish alerts dolphin predators to the fish's location. Similarly, the sounds caused by the dolphin when it is hunting its prey alert toadfish to the location of the predators and cause the fish to silence <b>their</b> <b>mating</b> call. Male toadfish will reduce <b>their</b> <b>mating</b> calls by up to 50% when they hear the low sound of a dolphin's [...] "pop".|$|R
5|$|Northern mockingbirds are {{socially}} monogamous. The two sexes look alike except that males {{are a little}} larger in size than females. Mutual mate choice is exhibited in northern mockingbirds. Both males and females prefer mates that are more aggressive towards intruders, and so exhibit greater parental investment. However, males are more defensive of their nests than females. In a population where male breeding adults outnumber female breeding adults, females have more freedom in choosing <b>their</b> <b>mates.</b> In these cases, these female breeders {{have the option of}} changing mates within a breeding season if the first male does not provide a high level of parental care, which includes feeding and nest defense. High nesting success is associated with highly aggressive males attacking intruders in the territory, and so these males are preferred by females.|$|E
5|$|The {{house sparrow}} is monogamous, and {{typically}} mates for life. Birds from pairs often engage in extra-pair copulations, so about 15% of house sparrow fledglings are unrelated to their mother's mate. Male house sparrows guard <b>their</b> <b>mates</b> carefully {{to avoid being}} cuckolded, and most extra-pair copulation occurs away from nest sites. Males may sometimes have multiple mates, and bigamy is mostly limited by aggression between females. Many birds do not find a nest and a mate, and instead may serve as helpers around the nest for mated pairs, a role which increases the chances of being chosen to replace a lost mate. Lost mates of both sexes can be replaced quickly during the breeding season. The formation of a pair and the bond between the two birds {{is tied to the}} holding of a nest site, though paired house sparrows can recognise each other away from the nest.|$|E
5|$|Waxwings are {{not highly}} territorial, and, {{although}} normally solitary breeders, several pairs may nest close together {{where there are}} a number of good nest sites. Males may sometimes deter rivals from approaching <b>their</b> <b>mates,</b> and females may squabble over nest sites. Aggression is shown by sleeking down the feathers and crest, showing the black throat, and opening the bill. The breeding display is almost the opposite of this; the male erects his body and crest feathers, and turns his head away from the female. The male may repeatedly present a gift of a small item, often food, to his partner, placing it in her open bill. In about 90% of cases, this display does not lead to copulation. Older males have more red tips to the wings and are preferred by females.|$|E
50|$|It is a {{well-known}} fact that men assign as far greater salience to the attractiveness of a potential <b>mate</b> when considering <b>their</b> <b>mating</b> preference than women do.|$|R

50|$|The {{females are}} {{much larger than}} males, for example in N. malabariensis 20 mm versus 4 mm. Adult males do not build their own webs, but live with females, with {{sometimes}} several males found in the web of an adult or immature female. They accordingly lack silk glands producing sticky silk. Males often mate with a freshly moulted female, which cannot resist due to the softness of its cuticula. They often sever <b>their</b> <b>mating</b> organs, which are then found stuck in the female genital opening. Severed males may live on in <b>their</b> <b>mate's</b> web.|$|R
5|$|When meeting {{another of}} the same species, P. fimbriata does not use cryptic {{stalking}} but displays by moving quickly and smoothly. In P. fimbriata from Queensland, contests between males usually are very brief and do no damage. Contests between Portia females are usually long and violent, and the victor may evict a loser and then eat the loser's eggs – but victorious females of P. fimbriata from Queensland do not kill and eat the losing female. If a P. fimbriata male from Queensland displays to a female, she may run away or she may charge at him. If the pair reach agreement after this, they will copulate if she is mature, and if she is sub-adult he will cohabit in her nest until she finishes moulting, and then they copulate. P. fimbriata typically copulates much quicker than other jumping spiders. Unlike in other Portia species, females of P. fimbriata do not eat <b>their</b> <b>mates</b> during courting, nor during or after copulation.|$|E
5|$|In the spring, mature birds {{return to}} land, usually to the colony {{at which they}} were hatched. Birds that were removed as chicks and {{released}} elsewhere were found to show fidelity to their point of liberation. They congregate {{for a few days}} on the sea in small groups offshore before returning to the cliff top nesting sites. Each large puffin colony is subdivided into sub-colonies by physical boundaries such as stands of bracken or gorse. Early arrivals take control of the best locations, the most desirable nesting sites being the densely packed burrows on grassy slopes just above the cliff edge where take-off is most easily accomplished. The birds are usually monogamous, but this is the result of their fidelity to their nesting sites rather than to <b>their</b> <b>mates</b> and they often return to the same burrows year after year. Later arrivals at the colony may find that all the best nesting sites have already been taken and be pushed towards the periphery where they are in greater danger of predation. Younger birds may come ashore a month or more after the mature birds and find no remaining nesting sites. They will not breed till the following year although it has been found that if the ground cover surrounding the colony is cut back before these sub-adults arrive, the number of successfully nesting pairs may be increased.|$|E
5|$|Lions are {{the most}} {{socially}} inclined of all wild felids, most of which remain quite solitary in nature, and have two types of social organisation. Some lions are residents, living in groups of related lionesses, <b>their</b> <b>mates,</b> and offspring. Such a group is called a pride. Females form the stable social unit in a pride and do not tolerate outside females. Membership only changes with the births and deaths of lionesses, although some females do leave and become nomadic. Although extremely large prides, consisting of up over 30 individuals, have been observed, the average pride consists of around fifteen lions; including several adult females, up to four males (known as a coalition if more than one) and their cubs of both sexes. The sole exception to this pattern is the Tsavo lion pride which always has just one adult male. Male cubs are excluded from their maternal pride when they reach maturity at around 2–3 years of age. The second organisational behaviour is labeled nomads, who range widely and move about sporadically, either singularly or in pairs. Pairs are more frequent among related males who have been excluded from their birth pride. Note that a lion may switch lifestyles; nomads may become residents and vice versa. Interactions between prides and nomads tend to be hostile, although pride females in estrous may allow nomad males to approach them.|$|E
50|$|Mate {{guarding}} is a co-evolution strategy {{designed to}} defend against poaching. Jealousy and guesstimation are identified indicators of this guarding strategy. In analysis' those who failed to successfully guard among men expressed sexual infidelity of <b>their</b> <b>mate</b> was the most damaging while women expressed emotional infidelity as the most damaging. Men perceived borderline paternity issues. In contrast, women were always 100% certain that their offspring are <b>their</b> own. <b>Mate</b> retention tactics among men mainly involved vigilance and violence while among women it mainly involved with enhancing their physical appearance and intentionally provoking <b>their</b> <b>mate’s</b> jealousy with suggestibility an object/stimulus {{is a threat to}} their valued relationship and challenge status hierarchy with changes in attachment.

40|$|In red-bellied lemurs (Eulemur rubriventer), a pair-bonded, monogamous {{species with}} {{paternal}} care, male fecal cortisol levels fluctuate over the reproductive season. The Challenge Hypothesis suggests {{a relationship between}} mating and infant care systems and hormone levels. During mating, fecal cortisol levels should be low due to little male-male mate competition. During gestation, males and females should have correlated hormonal responses if males prepare for infant care during <b>their</b> <b>mate's</b> pregnancy. Throughout infant growth, male fecal cortisol levels should elevate because paternal care is present. Red-bellied lemur male fecal cortisol levels were compared across reproductive seasons, and with <b>their</b> <b>mate's</b> fecal cortisol levels. Fecal cortisol levels were low during the mating season, higher during gestation, and highest around birth. During gestation, fecal cortisol levels were lower in males than females, and male fecal cortisol levels elevated about one to two weeks after <b>their</b> <b>mate's.</b> These results support predictions based on the Challenge Hypothesis, and suggest a paternal hormonal profile in this species...|$|R
