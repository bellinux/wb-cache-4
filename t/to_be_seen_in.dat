By 1979, Nicky has returned to more mainstream politics and stands for the Labour Party in the general election, but is defeated by the Conservative Party candidate (Saskia Wickham) after a smear campaign.

5|$|In 1146 Manuel {{assembled}} {{his army}} {{at the military}} base Lopadion and {{set out on a}} punitive expedition against Masud the Sultan of Rûm, who had been repeatedly violating the frontiers of the Empire in western Anatolia and Cilicia. There was no attempt at a systematic conquest of territory, but Manuel's army defeated the Turks at Acroënus, before capturing and destroying the fortified town of Philomelion, removing its remaining Christian population. The Byzantine forces reached Masud's capital, Konya, and ravaged the area around the city, but could not assault its walls. Among Manuel's motives for mounting this razzia there included a wish <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the West as actively espousing the crusading ideal; Kinnamos also attributed to Manuel a desire to show off his martial prowess to his new bride.* P.

5|$|To {{the naked}} eye, Venus {{appears as a}} white point of light {{brighter}} than any other planet or star (apart from the Sun). Its brightest apparent magnitude, −4.9, occurs during crescent phase, only 36 days before or after inferior conjunction. Venus will be brightest on 30 April 2017, then grow dimmer for nearly a year. Venus fades to about magnitude −3 when it is backlit by the Sun. The planet is bright enough <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> a clear midday sky and is more easily visible when the Sun is low on the horizon or setting. As an inferior planet, it always lies within about 47° of the Sun.|$|E
5|$|A {{young boy}} named Cooper and his girlfriend, Amber, are seen searching frantically for {{civilisation}} after {{they take a}} wrong turn. They are caught in a storm and head to a nearby mansion to seek shelter. Once outside, Cooper checks his map, but is unaware that someone is watching. Baron von Ghoul, the game's main antagonist, looks down from his window and orders two gargoyles to retrieve Cooper and Amber. Amber is kidnapped by the gargoyles and is taken into the Ghouly Mansion, with Cooper in pursuit. Once inside the mansion, Cooper realises that Amber is nowhere <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the Grand Hallway. Crivens, the mansion's butler, tells {{him to go to}} the archives where Amber is held. On the way, a huge group of boxing skeletons challenge Cooper to a boxing match, with Cooper emerging victorious. Upon reaching the archives, Cooper finds Amber being held hostage by a mad scientist named Dr. Krackpot. Krackpot then shoots Amber with his laser rifle and she transforms into a horrible creature.|$|E
5|$|From {{the twelfth}} century there are sources that allow the {{stratification}} in society <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> detail, with layers including the king and a small elite of mormaers above lesser ranks of freemen and what was probably {{a large group of}} serfs, particularly in central Scotland. In this period the feudalism introduced under David I meant that baronial lordships began to overlay this system, the English terms earl and thane became widespread. Below the noble ranks were husbandmen with small farms and growing numbers of cottars and gresemen (grazing tenants) with more modest landholdings. The combination of agnatic kinship and feudal obligations has been seen as creating the system of clans in the Highlands in this era. Scottish society adopted theories of the three estates to describe its society and English terminology to differentiate ranks. Serfdom disappeared from the records in the fourteenth century and new social groups of labourers, craftsmen and merchants, became important in the developing burghs. This led to increasing social tensions in urban society, but, in contrast to England and France, {{there was a lack of}} major unrest in Scottish rural society, where there was relatively little economic change.|$|E

5|$|The first {{recorded}} reference in England to {{the legend of}} the pig-faced woman is the fable of Tannakin Skinker, a 17th-century variation on the traditional loathly lady story, in particular on The Wife of Bath's Tale and The Marriage of Sir Gawain. The Skinker story is generally considered the basis for later English stories of pig-faced women. Between 4 and 11 December 1639, five ballads about Skinker were published in London, all of which are now lost. (A 1640 ballad, A Monstrous Shape: or, A Shapelesse Monster, a Description of a female creature born in Holland compleat in every part, save only a head like a swine, who hath travelled in many parts and is now <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> London, shees loving, courteous and effeminate and nere as yet could find a loving mate, is preserved in Samuel Pepys's extensive collection of ballads.) The earliest surviving record of the Tannakin Skinker story is that given in A Certaine Relation of the Hog-faced Gentlewoman called Mistris Tannakin Skinker, a 1640 chapbook.|$|E

40|$|Exercise is {{associated}} with physical, psychological, and cognitive health. The {{purpose of this study}} <b>is</b> <b>to</b> examine the effect of a single bout of exercise performed in the morning on cognitive function in adolescent athletes. Participants (N= 14) were competitive swimmers aged 12 - 17 years. CogState Research software <b>was</b> used <b>to</b> assess various aspects of cognitive function. The Two Back (TB) Task measures attention and working memory; the Groton Maze Learning (GML) Test measures executive function and spatial problem solving; and the Continuous Paired Associate Learning (CPAL) Task measures visual learning and memory. All tests were administered before and after two experimental conditions on separate days within the same week. The exercise condition consisted of a vigorous swim practice for 60 minutes. The sedentary comparison condition consisted of watching an instructional swimming video for 60 minutes. TB results indicated a borderline significant time x condition interaction (p=. 06). No change from pre- <b>to</b> posttest <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the swim condition (ES= 0. 05); a medium improvement from pre- <b>to</b> posttest <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the sedentary condition (ES= 0. 49). GML results indicated a borderline significant interaction (p=. 07). A small decrease from pre- <b>to</b> posttest <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the swim condition (ES=- 0. 16), while a small <b>to</b> medium improvement <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the sedentary condition (ES= 0. 39). CPAL results indicated no significant interaction (p =. 30). A small decrease from pre- <b>to</b> posttest <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the swim condition (ES=- 0. 22), while a small <b>to</b> medium improvement <b>was</b> <b>seen</b> <b>in</b> the sedentary condition (ES= 0. 34). Watching an instructional video for 60 minutes resulted in small to medium improvements in several aspects of cognitive function, while no changes <b>in</b> cognitive function <b>were</b> <b>seen</b> after 60 minutes of swim practice. The cognitive demands of swim practice may fatigue participants so that no improvements in cognitive function result consequent to physical activity...|$|R
