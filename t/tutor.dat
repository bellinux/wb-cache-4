He enjoyed Adams as a <b>tutor,</b> but by December, Johnson was already a quarter behind in his student fees, and he was forced to return home. He left behind many books that he had borrowed from his father because he could not afford to transport them, and also because he hoped to return to Oxford soon.|$|E

40|$|<b>Tutors</b> {{often have}} {{difficulty}} in accurately assessing their tutees ‟ understanding. However, {{it is unclear}} how tutors‟ professional experience influences their assessment accuracy. Therefore, we conducted a study with N = 46 tutor-tutee dyads and compared the accuracy with which teacher <b>tutors</b> and student <b>tutors</b> assessed a tutee‟s understanding of the human circulatory system at the level of mental models. Results showed that both groups of <b>tutors</b> faced similar difficulties in assessing a tutee‟s understanding. However, whereas teacher <b>tutors</b> ‟ assessment accuracy remained constant in the course of <b>tutoring,</b> student <b>tutors</b> ‟ assessment accuracy decreased. Moreover, teacher <b>tutors</b> more accurately self-assessed their assessment accuracy than student <b>tutors.</b> Although teacher <b>tutors</b> process diagnostic information more accurately than student <b>tutors,</b> both groups of <b>tutors</b> seem to be overwhelmed by processing all information making up a tutee‟s mental model. Hence, regardless of their professional experience, <b>tutors</b> need to be supported in assessing a tutee‟s understanding...|$|R

5|$|When a Liu-family {{relative}} of an emperor—usually a princely son—was designated as his heir apparent, he was provided living quarters within the palace {{and a personal}} staff which was not disbanded until he became the next emperor. During Western Han, the staff had two divisions: one was led by educators of the heir apparent, known as the Grand <b>Tutor</b> of the Heir Apparent (ranked 2000–dan) and Junior <b>Tutor</b> of the Heir Apparent (ranked 2000–dan), the other led by a Supervisor of the Household (ranked 2,000-dan). During Eastern Han, the Grand <b>Tutor</b> of the Heir Apparent lost his administrative role but remained the chief educator and was promoted in rank to Fully 2,000-dan; the Junior <b>Tutor</b> remained an administrator with a salary-rank of 2,000-dan. The post of Supervisor of the Household was abolished. Other Western Han staff offices of the heir apparent were abolished during Eastern Han, such as the Chief of the Kitchen and the Household Prison of the Heir Apparent. If he reached adulthood, the heir apparent could be married to a principal wife who led a harem of his concubines.|$|E

40|$|We {{assess the}} causal effect of private <b>tutoring</b> on the {{probability}} of university placement in Turkey.

However, we find evidence of positive selection into <b>tutoring,</b> but negative selection into greater expenditures among those receiving <b>tutoring.</b> Accounting for this pattern of non-random selection, we conclude that private <b>tutoring</b> has a negative causal effect on university placement overall, but conditional on receiving any <b>tutoring,</b> spending more on <b>tutoring</b> has a positive causal effect on university placement. <b>tutoring,</b> Turkey, tertiary education, program evaluation...|$|R

40|$|Peer <b>tutoring</b> is {{students}} {{helping other}} students. A peer <b>tutoring</b> {{system is designed}} to benefit both the <b>tutors</b> and junior students (tutees). The problems with a peer <b>tutoring</b> system are that students generally lack the physical space to pass messages, exchange and share information, and expand communications. It should be easy to obtain feedback from students and information about their problems. To further benefit both <b>tutors</b> and tutees, an effective and user-friendly system needs to be established to enhance communication and share and exchange information. This paper reports a Web-based system, which has been developed to assist face-to-face peer <b>tutoring</b> by extending tutorial discussions using technological advances. The functions of the system include: the posting of learning resources by <b>tutors</b> for tutees; question-and-answer sessions for <b>tutors</b> and tutees; open-forum discussions on a subject among <b>tutors</b> only, tutees only, and among <b>tutors</b> and tutees; easy e-mail communications with <b>tutors</b> and tutees; frequently asked questions; video-conferencing facilities; monitoring of the various peer <b>tutoring</b> activities; and the administrative function.
