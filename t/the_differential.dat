5|$|Starting in 1927, Bush {{constructed}} a differential analyzer, an analog computer that could solve differential equations {{with as many}} as 18 independent variables. This invention arose from previous work performed by Herbert R. Stewart, one of Bush's masters students, who at Bush's suggestion created the integraph, a device for solving first-order differential equations, in 1925. Another student, Harold Hazen, proposed extending the device to handle second-order differential equations. Bush immediately realized the potential of such an invention, for these were much more difficult to solve, but also quite common in physics. Under Bush's supervision, Hazen was able to construct <b>the</b> <b>differential</b> analyzer, a table-like array of shafts and pens that mechanically simulated and plotted the desired equation. Unlike earlier designs that were purely mechanical, <b>the</b> <b>differential</b> analyzer had both electrical and mechanical components. Among the engineers who made use of <b>the</b> <b>differential</b> analyzer was General Electric's Edith Clarke, who used it to solve problems relating to electric power transmission. For developing <b>the</b> <b>differential</b> analyzer, Bush was awarded the Franklin Institute's Louis E. Levy Medal in 1928.|$|E

5|$|Natural selection, {{introduced}} in 1859 {{as the central}} mechanism of evolution by Charles Darwin, is <b>the</b> <b>differential</b> survival and reproduction of individuals {{due to differences in}} phenotype.

50|$|The All-Trac {{system had}} five main parts: <b>the</b> front <b>differential,</b> rear <b>differential,</b> center <b>differential,</b> <b>the</b> transmission, and the {{transfer}} case. <b>The</b> transmission, front <b>differential,</b> center differential and transfer case are all one large assembly and {{are connected to}} the transversely mounted engine. The transmission bell housing, front differential and center differential can be separated from the transfer case sub assembly. The transmission output shaft feeds power into <b>the</b> front/center <b>differential</b> assembly (<b>the</b> center <b>differential</b> is contained within <b>the</b> front <b>differential).</b> <b>The</b> front <b>differential</b> distributes <b>the</b> power to the front wheels, while <b>the</b> center <b>differential</b> distributes power to the transfer case that will send power to <b>the</b> rear <b>differential.</b> In most of the models, when the transfer case is not locked the majority of the power is routed to the front wheels as would be in a Toyota FWD automobile.|$|R
5|$|Such vast cargoes {{would be}} carried by boat {{as far as}} possible, by sea and/or river, and only the {{shortest}} possible distance overland.

5|$|Acute {{beryllium}} {{disease in the}} form of chemical pneumonitis was first reported in Europe in 1933 and in the United States in 1943. A survey found that about 5% of workers in plants manufacturing fluorescent lamps in 1949 in the United States had beryllium-related lung diseases. Chronic berylliosis resembles sarcoidosis in many respects, and <b>the</b> <b>differential</b> diagnosis is often difficult. It killed some early workers in nuclear weapons design, such as Herbert L. Anderson.|$|E
5|$|An enquiry {{into the}} crash was hastily set up. The commission's report (Aktenzeichen 52, Br.B.Nr. 270/42) {{concluded}} that the crash was caused by damage to <b>the</b> <b>differential</b> gear, which caused an oil leak. Then a number of teeth broke off the spur wheel and ignited the oil. Sabotage or human error was ruled out. The aircraft, W. Nr. 14256, was ferried to the unit via Bari, Italy.

5|$|The heavy {{proportion}} of elderly {{persons in the}} district {{may be attributed to}} the settled way of life of those residents who arrived during the building boom of the 1960s: the children of these residents moved elsewhere to live, leaving their parents in the old dwelling.
