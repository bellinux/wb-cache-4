He {{strongly}} opposed the 1999 NATO intervention in Kosovo {{and called it}} {{an attempt by the}} world's powerful nations to police the entire world. In 2003, he spoke out against the plans for the US and UK to launch a war in Iraq, describing it as [...] "a tragedy" [...] and lambasting US President George W. Bush and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair for undermining the UN, saying, [...] "All <b>that</b> (<b>Mr.</b> <b>Bush)</b> wants is Iraqi oil". He attacked the US more generally, asserting that it had committed more [...] "unspeakable atrocities" [...] across the world than any other nation, citing the atomic bombing of Japan; this attracted international controversy, although he later improved his relationship with Blair. Retaining an interest in Libyan-UK relations, he visited Megrahi in Barlinnie prison and spoke out against the conditions of his treatment, referring to them as [...] "psychological persecution".|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is to design a {{semi-active}} magnetorheological (<b>MR)</b> hydraulic <b>bushing.</b> The semi-active bushing {{is intended to be}} used to isolate a cylinder deactivating engine. Cylinder deactivation causes high transient torsional loading in addition to changing the magnitude and mode of engine vibrations requiring an adaptive or controllable isolator. Practical and simple semi-active control strategies are inspired by investigating the optimization of linear and slightly cubic nonlinear single degree of freedom isolators. Experimental verification of the optimization technique, which minimizes the root mean square (RMS) of engine acceleration frequency response and RMS of the force transmitted frequency response, shows that this method can be implemented on real linear systems to isolate the engine from harmonic inputs. This optimization technique is also applied to tune selected model parameters of existing two degree of freedom hydraulic bushings.

Meanwhile, anti-war groups across the world organised public protests. According to French academic Dominique Reynié, between 3 January and 12 April 2003, 36 million people across the globe took part in almost 3,000 protests against war in Iraq, with demonstrations on 15 February 2003, being the largest and most prolific.

Those convictions turned out to be delusions. This denouement does great harm to Mr Bush's credibility and to that of the United States; it has got us into a ghastly mess in Iraq; and it has diverted attention, resources and military might from the war that should have commanded the Bush administration's highest priority - the Afghan war against al-Qa'ida and international terrorism. Meanwhile Afghanistan is a mess too. Mr Bush chose the wrong war in the wrong place at the wrong time.|$|E

5000|$|In 1981 George H. W. Bush became Vice President of the United States {{and sold}} his Tanglewood house, making a $596,101 ($ in today's money) profit. This started {{a dispute with}} the Internal Revenue Service. To resolve the IRS dispute, in April 1985 Bush signed an {{affidavit}} that served as an agreement for him to build his retirement home on the lot at 9 West Oak Lane South, a house along West Oak Lane South, a horseshoe-shaped street that leads to South Post Oak Boulevard. The lot is within the West Oaks Addition subdivision, outside of the Tanglewood subdivision limits, but within the Tanglewood area. The lot had 5280 sq ft of space and was 33 ft wide, making it the size of two tennis courts. In 1992 the Harris County Appraisal District valued the lot at $79,200 ($ in today's money).

5000|$|... ==Reform {{within the}} {{framework}} of Iranian constitution== ===Criticism=== Khatamis desire to not make reforms out of the framework of Islamic Republic constitution, caused many people to question the outcome of his programs in areas such as implementation of a democratic society or womens rights. He has received criticism inside and outside the Islamic Republic. During a speech at Tehran University, a group of his former supporters who had grown disillusioned with him chanted, [...] " [...] No more lies! [...] ". Many of them had gotten physically beaten by police and other security forces before the meeting and were frustrated with Khatamis lack of action. According to Khatami,"The reforms should come from within the regime. I consider the Islamic Republic to be a great achievement of the most popular revolution in my lifetime." [...] Many of his supporter misunderstood this idea. With regard to those that were disillusioned with the epic of 23 May 1997, Khatami denounced a group that caused violence in the Iran student riots, July 1999 because of [...] "their envy" [...] and that they [...] "created obstacles to implementation of the will of the people" [...] referring to his opponents within the political establishment of the country. [...] Additionally, he asserted, [...] Rest assured that beyond the Islamic Republic {{there will not be a}} democratic regime in the true sense of the word.

It seems that Khatami had commitment to reforming the systems. He tries to change the political currents of the country. At the same time he wants to add new controversial dimensions to the public discussions. Of course his administrations could not provide the wide range of social and political reforms promised[...] The movement of 2nd khordad showed the last thread of ideology of Islamic republic in politics.
