5|$|Michael (turned {{back into}} a zombie) and his fellow corpses then back the frightened girl {{into the corner of}} a nearby {{abandoned}} house. Michael then reaches for his date's <b>throat</b> <b>as</b> she lets out a bloodcurdling scream, only to awake and realize it was all a dream. Michael then offers to take her home, and she happily obliges. As they walk out of the house, Michael turns around and looks at the camera, thus revealing his yellow werewolf eyes and fangs {{from the beginning of the}} video, as we hear Vincent Price's haunting laugh, while Michael grins.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme of}} self-decapitation and the severed head is {{recurring}} in Indian mythology. Legends from the Simhasana Dvatrimsika and the Kathasaritsagara speak {{of how the}} hero offers blood from his <b>throat</b> <b>as</b> an offering to a goddess. Rajasthani folk tales and songs tell about of warrior-heroes (jhumjharji or bhomiya) who cuts off his head before the war or is decapitated in action, but battles on – without his head – slaying foes until he avenges his beheading and dies. The decapitated body and head motif {{is not unique to}} Hinduism and Buddhism and appears across the world, including the Cephalophore saints of Christianity and in Celtic culture.|$|E
5|$|Kris Fowles (Katie Cassidy) {{goes to the}} Springwood Diner to {{meet with}} her ex-boyfriend, Dean Russell (Kellan Lutz), who falls asleep {{at the table and}} meets a man covered in burn scars, wearing a clawed glove on his hand. The burned man cuts Dean's throat in the dream, but in reality it appears that Dean is cutting his own <b>throat</b> <b>as</b> his friend, {{waitress}} Nancy Holbrook (Rooney Mara), looks on with Kris. At Dean's funeral, Kris sees a photograph of her and Dean as children, but cannot recall ever knowing Dean before high school. Kris begins to dream about the burned man herself and refuses to go to sleep for fear that she will die in her dreams. Jesse Braun (Thomas Dekker), Kris's ex-boyfriend, shows up to keep her company while she sleeps, but Kris meets the burned man in her dreams and is murdered. Covered in her blood, Jesse runs to Nancy's house and learns that Nancy has been having dreams about the same man: Freddy Krueger (Jackie Earle Haley).|$|E

25|$|Sometimes, modern beatboxers {{will use}} their hand or {{another part of}} their body to extend the {{spectrum}} of sound effects and rhythm. Some have developed a technique that involves blowing and sucking air around their fingers to produce a very realistic record scratching noise, which {{is commonly known as}} the 'crab scratch'. Another hand technique includes the 'throat tap' which involves the beatboxer tapping their fingers against their <b>throat</b> <b>as</b> they throat sing or hum.|$|E

25|$|Infants under 6 {{months of}} age have lower levels of a key methemoglobin {{reduction}} enzyme (NADH-cytochrome b5 reductase) in their red blood cells. This results in a major risk of methemoglobinemia caused by nitrates ingested in drinking water, dehydration (usually caused by gastroenteritis with diarrhea), sepsis, or topical anesthetics containing benzocaine or prilocaine. Nitrates used in agricultural fertilizers may leak {{into the ground and}} may contaminate well water. The current EPA standard of 10 ppm nitrate-nitrogen for drinking water is specifically set to protect infants. Benzocaine applied to the gums or <b>throat</b> (<b>as</b> commonly used in baby teething gels, or sore throat lozenges) can cause methemoglobinemia.|$|E
25|$|Butcher {{was born}} in Independence, Missouri, in 1971. He is the {{youngest}} of three children, having two older sisters. While he was sick with strep <b>throat</b> <b>as</b> a child, Butcher's sisters introduced him to The Lord of the Rings and The Han Solo Adventures novels to pass the time, thus beginning his fascination with fantasy and science fiction. As a teenager, he completed his first novel {{and set out to}} become a writer. After many unsuccessful attempts to enter the traditional fantasy genre (he cites J. R. R. Tolkien, Lloyd Alexander, and C. S. Lewis, among others, as major influences), he wrote the first book in The Dresden Files—about a professional wizard, named Harry Dresden, in modern-day Chicago—as an exercise for a writing course in 1996 at the age of 25.|$|E

25|$|Methyl {{isocyanate}} (MIC) {{is extremely}} toxic. The {{threshold limit value}} set by the American Conference on Government Industrial Hygienists is 0.02 ppm. MIC is toxic by inhalation, ingestion and contact in quantities as low as 0.4 ppm. Exposure symptoms includes coughing, chest pain, dyspnea, asthma, irritation of the eyes, nose and <b>throat,</b> <b>as</b> well as skin damage. Higher levels of exposure, over 21 ppm, can result in pulmonary or lung edema, emphysema and hemorrhages, bronchial pneumonia and death. Although the odor of methyl isocyanate cannot be detected at 5 ppm by most people, its potent lachrymal properties provide an excellent warning of its presence (at a concentration of 2–4 parts per million (ppm) subject's eyes are irritated, while at 21 ppm, subjects could not tolerate the presence of methyl isocyanate in air).|$|E
25|$|The first {{match was}} between Psychosis and Rey Misterio, Jr. After {{starting}} {{back and forth}} with both applying and countering holds, Psychosis performed a spinning heel kick, followed by a suicide dive to the outside. Psychosis dominated after, performing a diving leg drop across Misterio's <b>throat.</b> <b>As</b> Psychosis ran at Misterio on the apron, Misterio performed a monkey flip, sending Psychosis' head into the ringpost. Misterio gained the advantage, performing a headscissors takedown on the outside. Psychosis came back after a drop toe-hold, performing a senton from the top rope to the outside. Psychosis then applied the hammerlock, which Misterio countered with a snapmare, and kept the advantage by performing several aerial moves. Psychosis countered a headscissors takedown attempt into a powerbomb, and attempted a Splash Mountain. Misterio countered the attempt into a headscissors takedown from the top rope and pinned Psychosis for the victory.|$|E
500|$|In 1980, Linda Boreman (who had {{appeared}} in the pornographic film Deep <b>Throat</b> <b>as</b> [...] "Linda Lovelace") made public statements that her ex-husband Chuck Traynor had beaten and raped her, and violently coerced her into making that and other pornographic films. Boreman made her charges public for the press corps at a press conference, with Dworkin, feminist lawyer Catharine MacKinnon, and members of Women Against Pornography. After the press conference, Dworkin, MacKinnon, Gloria Steinem, and Boreman began discussing the possibility of using federal civil rights law to seek damages from Traynor and the makers of Deep Throat. Boreman was interested, but backed off after Steinem discovered that the statute of limitations for a possible suit had passed.|$|E

500|$|The season {{introduced}} the character X, played by Steven Williams, who replaced Deep <b>Throat</b> <b>as</b> Mulder's informant, following Deep Throat's assassination in the first-season finale, [...] "The Erlenmeyer Flask". X was {{originally intended to}} be a woman with Natalija Nogulich already cast in the role, but was replaced by Williams as the writers did not believe she had the [...] "right chemistry" [...] with her co-stars. X was written to be different than Deep Throat; Deep Throat had been selfless, while X was intended to be selfish and scared. Nicholas Lea, who had previously appeared in a small part in the season one's [...] "Gender Bender", was cast as Alex Krycek. Krycek was originally intended as a temporary replacement for Scully when she was abducted, but grew into a character who would last seven seasons on the show.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Darryl Weaver {{attempts}} to browbeat Skinner, threatening to light {{one of the}} toxic cigarettes. As Weaver {{attempts to}} leave the building, Skinner shoots Weaver's shoulder and the pane of glass behind him, leaving him injured and covered in glass. He drops his cigarette {{to the floor and}} Skinner dramatically snuffs it out with his shoe. Back at the hospital, Scully realizes that nicotine might save Mulder’s life. She is correct in her solution, noting that Weaver’s nicotine tolerance didn’t allow the tobacco beetles to develop in his lungs. Scully administers nicotine to Mulder, who in turn recovers, albeit with a sore <b>throat,</b> <b>as</b> well as a minor addiction to nicotine, which drives him to buy a pack of Morley cigarettes for himself. [...] Chided by Scully, he throws them out, but then stares at them pensively after she leaves.|$|E
500|$|This episode marked Hardin's first {{appearance}} as Deep Throat. Series creator Chris Carter {{stated that the}} character {{was inspired by the}} historical Deep Throat, an informant who leaked information about the FBI's investigation of the Watergate scandal to journalists Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward. This Deep Throat was later revealed to be FBI Associate Director Mark Felt. Also cited as an influence was X, the character portrayed by Donald Sutherland in the 1991 Oliver Stone film JFK. Carter created the character {{to bridge the gap between}} Mulder and Scully and the shadowy conspirators working against them; describing Deep <b>Throat</b> <b>as</b> a man [...] "who works in some level of government that we have no idea exists". Carter was drawn to Hardin after seeing him in The Firm, and described the casting as an [...] "easy choice". Hardin flew to Vancouver every few weeks to film his scenes. Carter called Hardin's portrayal [...] "very, very good".|$|E
