5|$|Authentic {{gardens of}} the yeoman cottager would have {{included}} a beehive and livestock, and frequently a pig and sty, {{along with a}} well. The peasant cottager of medieval times {{was more interested in}} meat than flowers, with herbs grown for medicinal use and cooking, rather than for <b>their</b> <b>beauty.</b> By Elizabethan times there was more prosperity, and thus more room to grow flowers. Even the early cottage garden flowers typically had their practical useâ€”violets were spread on the floor (for their pleasant scent and keeping out vermin); calendulas and primroses were both attractive and used in cooking. Others, such as sweet william and hollyhocks were grown entirely for <b>their</b> <b>beauty.</b>|$|E

5|$|The word herbal {{is derived}} from the mediaeval Latin liber herbalis ("book of herbs"): it is {{sometimes}} used in contrast to the word florilegium, which is a treatise on flowers with emphasis on <b>their</b> <b>beauty</b> and enjoyment rather than the herbal emphasis on their utility. Much of the information found in printed herbals arose out of traditional medicine and herbal knowledge that predated the invention of writing.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the local}} Canton {{officials}} watched the Portuguese and their ships closely, once the provincial authorities arrived at Canton they greeted the Portuguese {{with a warm}} reception, providing them comfortable lodgings and had their trade goods brought ashore. The Chinese became suspicious once again of Andrade, this time for being a spy, when he sent a ship along the Fujian coast to look for further trade prospects, but he left a good impression when he gave the order that any locals who might be harmed by a Portuguese should seek him for redress. Besides exploring Fujian, Andrade sent one of his captains named Jorge de Mascarenhas to explore the Ryukyu Islands after he heard of <b>their</b> <b>beauty</b> while stationed in Malacca.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, {{there was}} little {{interest}} in the cultivation of Australian plants until the mid-20th century, despite a long-standing appreciation of <b>their</b> <b>beauty</b> as wildflowers. For example, in 1933 and 1934 The Western Mail published a series of Edgar Dell paintings of Western Australian wildflowers, including a painting of B.sessilis. These were subsequently republished in Charles Gardner's 1935 West Australian Wild Flowers. One of the first published colour photographs of the species appeared in William Blackall's 1954 How to know Western Australian wildflowers, but this publication was restricted to plant identification. The species was discussed and illustrated in the 1959 Wildflowers of Western Australia, and in the 1973 Flowers and plants of Western Australia, but these books did not provide cultivation advice either.|$|E
5|$|The sexual {{freedoms of}} Liao also stood in stark {{contrast}} {{from those of the}} Han Chinese. Women from the upper Liao classes, like those of the Han Chinese upper classes, had arranged marriages, in some cases for political purposes. However women from the lower classes of the Liao did not have arranged marriages, and would attract suitors by singing and dancing in the streets. The songs served as self-advertisements, with the women telling of <b>their</b> <b>beauty,</b> familial status, and domestic skills. Virginity was not a requirement for marriage among the Liao, and many Liao women were sexually promiscuous before marriage, which stood in sharp contrast from the beliefs of the Han Chinese. Khitan women had the right to divorce their husbands and were able to remarry after being divorced.|$|E

5|$|The Bahamanis {{introduced}} the large-scale use {{of paper in}} administration and began the Indo-Sarasenic architectural style, designed and constructed by Persian architects and artisans, (also known as Deccani architecture) with its local influences in Karnataka. The Sultanate monuments of Bidar and Gulbarga are testimony to their interest in architecture. The Bande Nawaz tombs and a Jama Masjid in Gulbarga which exhibits a Spanish influence are well known. In Bidar, their buildings have Persian, Turkish, Arabic and Roman influences (the Solah Khamba mosque being an example). Rangin Mahal, Gangan Mahal, Tarkash Mahal, Chini Mahal, Nagina Mahal and the Taqk Mahal {{are some of the}} palaces built by them that have retained <b>their</b> <b>beauty.</b> The Ahmad Shah Wali tombs are noted for their decor, and the school of learning (madrasa) built by Gavan in Bidar (1472), with its lecture halls, library, mosque and residential houses are also famous. In the later part of the 15th century, with a growing rift between the local Deccani Muslims and the Pardeshi Muslims (foreign) who occupied influential positions in the kingdom, the execution of Gavan under dubious circumstances in 1481, and constant wars with the Vijayanagara kings weakened the Bahamani Kingdom eventually bringing about its end in 1527.|$|E

Gold's scarcity, its unique density {{and the way it}} could be easily melted, shaped, and measured made it a natural trading asset.|$|E
