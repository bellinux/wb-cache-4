500|$|Ike's {{accounts}} {{of his relationship}} with Tina, including the incidents of abuse, differed. In a 1985 interview with Spin magazine, Ike admitted, [...] "Yeah, I hit her, but I didn't hit her more than the average guy beats his wife.... If she says I abused her, maybe I did." [...] He worded this slightly differently in his memoirs, Taking Back My Name (1999), writing: [...] "Sure, I've slapped Tina.... There have been <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> punched her to the ground without thinking. But I have never beat her." ...|$|E
500|$|When you win a race {{like this}} {{the feeling is}} very, very good. There have been <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> have been {{flat-out}} to finish sixth, but you can't see that from the outside. In [...] I finished {{three or four times}} in seventh place. I pushed like mad, yet everyone was gathered around the winner and they were thinking that I was just trundling around. But that's motor racing. So in fact {{the only thing you can}} judge in this sport is the long term. You can judge a career or a season, but not one race.|$|E

500|$|While some {{commentators}} claimed Mercury hid his sexual orientation from the public, others {{claimed he was}} [...] "openly gay". In December 1974, when asked directly, [...] "So how about being bent?" [...] by the New Musical Express, Mercury replied, [...] "You're a crafty cow. Let's put it this way: there were <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was young and green. It's a thing schoolboys go through. I've had my share of schoolboy pranks. I'm not going to elaborate further." [...] Homosexual acts between adult males {{over the age of}} 21 had been decriminalised in the United Kingdom in 1967, only seven years earlier. In the 1980s, he would often distance himself from his partner, Jim Hutton, during public events. In October 1986, The Sun claimed Mercury had [...] "confessed to a string of one-night gay sex affairs".|$|E
500|$|In a 1988 {{interview}} with Barbara Walters, Fonda expressed regret {{for some of}} her comments and actions, stating:I {{would like to say}} something, not just to Vietnam veterans in New England, but to men who were in Vietnam, who I hurt, or whose pain I caused to deepen because of things that I said or did. I was trying to help end the killing and the war, but there were <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was thoughtless and careless about it and I'm very sorry that I hurt them. And I want to apologize to them and their families. [...] I will go to my grave regretting the photograph of me in an anti-aircraft gun, which looks like I was trying to shoot at American planes. It hurt so many soldiers. It galvanized such hostility. It was the most horrible thing I could possibly have done. It was just thoughtless.|$|E
500|$|At times Kiedis {{has also}} resented singing the song, {{especially}} during instances {{when he felt}} distanced from the song's lyrics. In the past few years, however, Kiedis has experienced a revival in interest: [...] "Although there have been <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was over , I've rediscovered it and now I feel close to it and it still has power, and life, and purpose as a song." [...] Frusciante believed that the flexibility of [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] has contributed to its success: [...] "A {{lot of the time}} {{that is one of the}} ingredients of a hit; you can hear it over and over and it will still always mean new things, but you do go through cycles." [...] Flea believes that the reason [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] had a recent revival in relevancy was due to Frusciante's return to the band from 1998 to 2009 after quitting in 1992. Flea believed that it was vital to have the four members who wrote the track together.|$|E

Not long after I had come to myself I heard a church clock strike the hour.

500|$|The series {{features}} numerous song covers sung onscreen by the characters. Ryan Murphy {{was responsible}} for selecting all of the songs used, and {{has said that he}} strove to maintain a balance between chart hits and show tunes: [...] "I want there to be something for everybody in every episode. That's a tricky mix, but that's very important—the balancing of that." [...] According to Murphy, the song choices are integral to script development, [...] "Each episode has a theme at its core. After I write the script, I will choose songs that help to move the story along." [...] In a 2010 interview with Allison Kugel, Chris Colfer noted that [...] "there have been a couple of <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> have gone to Ryan Murphy (Glee creator) and told him {{a couple of things that}} have happened to me, and then he writes it into the show. Or he'll ask me what song I would want to sing, in this situation or in that situation. I don’t think any of us directly try to give input on the character or on the storyline, but they definitely steal things from us." [...] For the second season, a shift toward using more Top 40 songs was seen, in an effort to appeal more to the 18–49 demographic.|$|E
500|$|Other {{times on}} the set were not as smooth. The shoot was an arduous {{experience}} that [...] "cemented Cameron's formidable reputation as 'the scariest man in Hollywood'. He became known as an uncompromising, hard-charging perfectionist" [...] and a [...] "300-decibel screamer, a modern-day Captain Bligh with a megaphone and walkie-talkie, swooping down into people's faces on a 162ft crane". Winslet chipped a bone in her elbow during filming and had been worried that she would drown in the 17m-gallon water tank the ship was to be sunk in. [...] "There were <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was genuinely frightened of him. Jim has a temper like you wouldn't believe," [...] she said. [...] "'God damn it!' he would yell at some poor crew member, 'that's exactly what I didn't want!'" [...] Her co-star, Bill Paxton, was familiar with Cameron's work ethic from his earlier experience with him. [...] "There {{were a lot of}} people on the set. Jim is not one of those guys who has the time to win hearts and minds," [...] he said. The crew felt Cameron had an evil alter ego and so nicknamed him [...] "Mij" [...] (Jim spelt backwards). In response to the criticism, Cameron stated, [...] "Film-making is war. A great battle between business and aesthetics." ...|$|E

2500|$|Shatskaya {{said she}} never cared for being pigeon-holed. [...] "People do not come to my concerts for genre-picking. It is not {{to me that they}} listen, but to their own selves," [...] she remarked. [...] "My aim is not to shake my {{listener}} up, but just to tell a story and then hope that this story helps a person to evoke something intimate and important in their own memory", she said in another interview. According to the singer, one is not supposed to sing romance seriously, though: irony here is essential. [...] "Not sarcasm, but irony. Like – 'those were the cruel <b>times,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> lost my heart, but those were good times, too'. The audience should not suffer in the theater. Neither drama nor tragedy, but pleasantly sweet melancholy is what they should carry away with them," [...] she argued.|$|E
2500|$|The {{sudden death}} of her partner Julius Robertson {{of a heart attack}} in November 1961 marked a turning point for Dovey Roundtree, who as an African American woman found herself a sole {{practitioner}} in a legal community still dominated by men. [...] "At a time when a female lawyer of any race was regarded skeptically, I'd derived a significant measure of credibility from my association with Julius," [...] she later wrote, adding that in the wake of Robertson's death, [...] "there were <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> felt truly vulnerable." [...] Sustained by her ordination into the ministry of the African Methodist Episcopal Church on November 30, 1961, Dovey Roundtree went on to build a thriving law practice, working as a sole practitioner for nine years before founding a second law firm, Roundtree Knox Hunter and Parker, in 1970.|$|E
2500|$|Hanks {{followed}} Philadelphia {{with the}} 1994 hit Forrest Gump which grossed a worldwide total of over $600 {{million at the}} box office.

I got that from the movies a hundred million <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was a kid. I still do." [...] Hanks won his second Best Actor Academy Award for his role in Forrest Gump, becoming only the second actor to have accomplished the feat of winning consecutive Best Actor Oscars. (Spencer Tracy was the first, winning in 1937–38. Hanks and Tracy were the same age at the time they received their Academy Awards: 37 for the first and 38 for the second.) ...|$|E

2500|$|During her Janet World Tour, Jackson {{experienced}} an emotional breakdown, stemming from self-hatred, childhood humiliation, self-harm, and distorted body image. She stated, [...] "I was very, very sad. Very down. I couldn't get up sometimes. There were <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> felt very hopeless and helpless, and I felt like walls {{were kind of}} closing in on me...like you can't escape". She questioned her career path, feeling pressured by {{the demands of the}} entertainment industry, saying, [...] "People look at you differently, as if you're not human." [...] Abbie Kearse of MTV responded, [...] "You're creating a person who might not really be you, but you've created this fantasy woman, so when it's time to get back to business, it's like 'I've {{got to go back to}} that world'". Jackson expressed concern for how she could portray an object of fantasy, feeling as if she could no longer fulfill her own desires.|$|E

2500|$|Carson {{opposed the}} Vietnam War, and capital punishment, favored racial equality, and was against criminalizing extramarital sex and pornography.

[...] As he explained in 1970, [...] "In my living room I would argue for liberalization of abortion laws, divorce laws, and there are <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> would like to express a view on the air. I {{would love to have}} taken on Billy Graham. But I'm on TV five nights a week; I have nothing to gain by it and everything to lose." [...] He also seldom invited political figures onto the Tonight Show because he [...] "didn't want it to become a political forum" [...] and did not want the show used, by himself or others, to influence the opinions of the viewers.|$|E
