The resulting set of experimental TG data was used to determine the apparent activation energy (Ea) of degradation through two isothermal literature methods, as well as through a very simple method we set up, based on the direct regression of the experimental mass loss data, in order to verify the general applicability of our method to various polymers. The results from different methods were in good agreement. Degradation experiments in dynamic heating conditions, which were also performed, gave Ea values in good agreement with those in isothermal heating conditions for PS, PC and PMMA, while for PE a large discrepancy was observed, which was discussed and interpreted. The results suggested the general applicability of our method to all polymers, independently on their structure and degradation mechanism. A long-term (about 13 months) isothermal degradation experiment was also carried out with the same polymers at relatively low temperature (423 K). Only PE and PS evidenced appreciable mass loss in the investigated period, but the experimental data were not in agreement with those from the short-term degradations at higher temperatures, thus suggesting different degradation kinetics, and a low reliability of the lifetime predictions for polymers in service based on experiments at higher temperatures.

40|$|Biomass {{combustion}} is {{an interesting}} alternative to fossil fuel. Modeling and simulation is used for design optimization of biomass boilers and furnace. It is difficult to develop a sufficiently accurate and computationally efficient model because the combustion system is highly complicated multi-scale, multi-phase and multi-physics problem. The study of biomass combustion in different scales allows engineers to understand the combustion process and tochoose necessary simplification to develop a computationally efficient model. The chemical and physical properties of fuels are altered during different fuel preparation methods (i. e. pretreatment and pelletization), {{and as a result}} the fuel conversion is also affected. The aim of this thesis is to understand thermal conversion of those chemically or physically altered fuels. Both experimental and modeling techniques were chosen to addressthe aim. Experiments were performed in <b>thermogravimetric</b> <b>analysers,</b> isothermal macro thermogravimeters (iTG), and a pot furnace to account fuel conversion in micro-, meso- and macro scale. In addition, three different types of mathematical model were developed. They are (i) a simplified particle pyrolysis model, (ii) two detailed numerical models that simulate particle pyrolysis and char oxidation and (iii) finally a computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model of combustion of biomass particles in a bed. The results indicate that both the intrinsic and the apparent conversion of the fuel wasinfluenced by the process conditions of fuel preparation methods. Intrinsic pyrolysis reactivitywas reduced due to mild pretreatment; however, it was increased with further increase in pretreatment severity. In contrary, severity of pelletization tends to reduce the apparent reactivity of pellets combustion. It was also investigated that how each physical and chemical parameter should be modelledfor a untreated biomass (i. e. wood logs) and a densified biomass (i. e. pellets) through parametric studies with a detailed particle simulation. The result shows that a model for wood logs should exclude convective heat transfer by volatiles if the fibers align to longitude direction while it is important part in the models for pellets. Devolatilization of wood logs was expressed as endothermic reactions while the model results showed best agreement withexperimental data of wood pellets when the heat of reaction was assumed to be zero, possibly due to the secondary reactions. Then, it was demonstrated that a constitutive equation, i. e. analytical solution of the shrinking core model, is sufficient to express devolatilization rate of thermally-thick particles at the temperature of 1173 K. While studying apparent oxidation of wood pellet char, it was found that change in intrinsic char oxidation reactivity due to different pyrolysis conditions does not influences the model prediction at high temperature. In addition, at high temperature, the reaction front became thin and reaction rate was hardly affected by temperature. It was also found by the simulation of pellet bed combustion that the apparent density of the particle significantly affected the flame velocity.

Besides, the surface area of treated sample was decreased by 41. 17 % as compared to the control. The TGA analysis revealed that onset temperature as well as Tmax (maximum thermal decomposition temperature) was increased in the treated sample.

The objective {{of the study was to}} use an alternate strategy i. e. biofield energy treatment and analyse its impact on physicochemical properties of aromatic amine derivatives viz. p-phenylenediamine (PPD) and p-toluidine. For this study, both the samples were taken and divided into two parts. One part was considered as control and another part was subjected to Mr. Trivedi’s biofield treatment. After treatment, both samples were analysed for their physical, thermal and spectral properties as compared to their respective control samples. The analysis was done by using X-ray diffraction (XRD), surface area <b>analyser,</b> <b>thermogravimetric</b> analysis (TGA), Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR), and ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis) spectroscopy. The XRD studies and surface area analysis of PPD sample revealed that the crystallite size and surface area of the treated sample was increased by 11. 12 % and 8. 49 %, respectively as compared to the control sample. In case of p-toluidine, the crystallite size and surface area of treated sample were decreased by 4. 8 % and 8. 43 %, respectively as compared to control. The treated PPD sample also showed an alteration in thermal degradation properties as it exhibited two-steps thermal decomposition as compared to single step decomposition in the control sample. In case of p-toluidine, the treated sample showed decreased onset temperature of degradation (112 °C→ 100 °C) and Tmax (temperature at which maximum weight loss occur) (136 °C→ 125 °C) as compared to control sample. Moreover, the FT-IR analysis revealed that C-C aromatic stretching peak in treated PPD sample was shifted to the lower frequency (1456 → 1444 cm- 1) as compared to the control sample. Besides, in p-toluidine, the treated sample showed the alteration in frequencies of C-N-H bending, C-H bending, C-H stretching, and C-C aromatic stretching and bending peaks as compared to the control sample. However, no alteration was found in UV-Vis spectroscopic analysis of treated PPD and p-toluidine samples as compared to their respective control samples.

The DSC {{results show that the}} Cu micro- and nano-particles influence the crystallization behaviour of the polyethylenes in different ways. The extent to which the copper particles influence the crystallization behaviour of the polyethylenes also depends on the respective morphologies of the different polyethylenes. The TGA results show an observable influence of both the presence of copper and the sizes of the copper particles on the thermal stabilities of the polymers. Thermal conductivities increased with increasing Cu content, but there was little difference between the thermal conductivities of the samples containing Cu micro- and nano-particles...|$|E
40|$|CO₂ {{gasification}} of Victorian (Morwell) {{brown coal}} char was studied using a <b>thermogravimetric</b> <b>analyser</b> (TG). Gasification kinetics of demineralised, Ca-loaded, and Fe-loaded Morwell char were also studied. The grain model and random pore model {{were used to}} fit the gasification data. The random pore model fitted the experimental data better than the grain model. The activation energy was 189. 05 kJ mol - 1 for the CO₂ gasification of Morwell coal char. With 2 % Ca loading, the activation energy increased to 204. 53 kJ mol - 1 due to lowering of the surface area. However, {{an order of magnitude}} increase in the pre-exponential factor indicated an increase in active reaction sites for the 2 % Ca-loaded sample, resulting in a net increase in gasification rate. 5 % Ca loading and 2 % Fe loading proved to be less effective in increasing the gasification rate. Analysis of the TG outlet gas also proved the effectiveness of 2 % Ca loading as a gasification catalyst...|$|E
