40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{describe}} the rate of motor development in infants with Down syndrome in the age range of 3 - 12 months and identify the difficulties both in performance and acquiring motor skills in prone, supine, sitting and standing positions. Nineteen infants with Down syndrome and 25 healthy full <b>term</b> <b>typical</b> infants were assessed using the Alberta Infant Motor Scale (AIMS) monthly from 3 to 12 months of age. The infants with Down syndrome achieved significant later the level of motor performance of the typical infants. In the supine posture, the performance was significantly lesser for the Down syndrome infants in comparison to the typical infants from the 3 rd to 6 th month and in the 8 th month. In the prone, sitting and standing postures this difference is found for all the months. In conclusion, the sequence of motor development of the Down syndrome is the same as the typical infants. However infants with Down syndrome need more time to acquire skills, mainly antigravitational ones, among them the standing position. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|We outline {{some general}} {{features}} of possible {{extensions of the}} Standard Model that include anomalous U(1) gauge symmetries, {{a certain number of}} axions and their mixings with the CP-odd Higgs sector. As previously shown, after the mixing one of the axions becomes a physical pseudoscalar (the axi-Higgs) that can take the role of a modified QCD axion. It can be driven to be very light by the same non-perturbative effects that are held responsible for the solution of the strong CPproblem. At the same time the axi-Higgs has a sizeable gauge interaction, which is not allowed to the Peccei-Quinn axion, possibly explaining the PVLAS results. We point out that the Wess-Zumino <b>term,</b> <b>typical</b> of these models, can be both interpreted as an anomaly inflow from higher dimensional theories (second window) but also as a result of partial decoupling of an extra Higgs sector (and of a fermion) that leaves behind an effective anomalous abelian theory (first window) in a broken Stückelberg phase.

In {{this work}} we develop a {{high-resolution}} mapped-grid finite volume method code to model wave propagation in two dimensions in systems of multiple orthotropic poroelastic media and/or fluids, with curved interfaces between different media.

We verify our code against analytical solutions for reflection and transmission of waves at a material interface, and for scattering of an acoustic wave train around an isotropic poroelastic cylinder.

Velocity measurements at 24 m water depth are taken as representative of the inner shelf, and the cross-shelf variability is explored with additional measurements at 50 m water depth. At 24 m, as the storm-related wind stress accelerated the flow, velocity increased throughout the water column, resulting in bottom stress starting to become important. The sea level also responded, with the pressure gradient force opposing the wind stress. In particular, during the second wind pulse, there were rapid oscillations in the acceleration and advective terms, apparently reflecting the incapacity of the bottom stress to dissipate the high kinetic energy of the system. The Coriolis and wave induced terms (via radiation stresses) were less important in the momentum balance. The frictional adjustment time scale was around 10 h, consistent with the e-folding time obtained from bottom drag parameterizations.

40|$|In a short essay {{dealing with}} the {{repetitive}} homogeneity of the Manhattan’s office layouts, Rem Koolhaas defined the <b>term</b> <b>Typical</b> Plan {{as one of the}} purest American architectural archetypes. A plan stripped of all its qualities and reduced to a calculated relation between discreet standardised elements: an empty surface able to host whatever program and on which life could be simply performed. Nevertheless, more than a technical achievement in electric lighting, air-conditioning and fire-safety protocols, the alleged “specific indeterminacy” of the typical plan was the outcome of violent political and economical passages, epitomised by that historical convergence between the modern industrial revolution, the scientific management of production and the financial imperialism which marked the first three decades of the 20 th-century. Through the analysis of coeval case-studies in United States, Germany, Soviet Union and Italy, this thesis conjectures the typical plan as the creation of the working-class, whose struggle always forced capitalism to constantly extend its infrastructural apparatus and to further improve its architecture of production in order to ultimately reduce the genericness of labor-power as lymph for progress. Only by reconstructing its spatial genealogy through the instruments of political economy and the dialectic of class conflict, the typical plan could be eventually reconsidered in its twofold framing character, both as managerial dispositive – to maximise exploitation and profit – but also as a platform of organisation – to articulate the workers’ opposition and resistance against any form of slavery, within and beyond the factory walls.

Depending on the specific orientations considered, we have observed coherent rotation of linear stripes together with transitions from stripes to labyrinth domain patterns or saw-tooth zig-zag periodic patterns.
