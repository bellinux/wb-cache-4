500|$|TouchArcade Eli Hodapp called Ridiculous Fishing so well {{packaged}} as to {{make his}} recommendation [...] "effortless" [...] for both short few-minute play sessions as well as longer ones. Rob Hearn of Pocket Gamer lauded its [...] "blossoming" [...] progression and became more interested as he unlocked upgrades. But when <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> upgrade, Hearn wrote that [...] "it's a shame that the innovation is confined to the first few hours". While Ridiculous Fishing offered many hours of secrets and unlocks, IGN's Davis noted that the game was at its core a [...] "simple arcade experience ... ultimately a polished arcade time-killer".|$|E
500|$|Not until news of {{the victory}} at San Jacinto spread did the {{refugees}} return to their homesteads and businesses, or whatever was left after the destruction caused by both armies. Throughout Texas, possessions had been abandoned and later looted. Businesses, homes and farms were wiped out by the devastation of war. Often <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> go back to, but those who went home began {{to pick up their}} lives and move forward. San Felipe de Austin never really recovered from its total destruction. The few people who returned there moved elsewhere, sooner or later. Secretary of War Rusk would later commend the women of Texas who held their families together during the flight, while their men volunteered to fight: [...] "The men of Texas deserve much credit, but more was due the women. Armed men facing a foe could not but be brave; but the women, with their little children around them, without means of defense or power to resist, faced danger and death with unflinching courage." ...|$|E
500|$|During the 1880s, {{sections}} of the American press popularized {{the notion that the}} West had been won and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> conquer in the United States. The time when great scouts like Kit Carson, Daniel Boone, and Davy Crockett could explore and master the wild and uncharted Western territories was coming to a close. Contemporary scouts such as Buffalo Bill, Wild Bill Hickok, and Texas Jack Omohundro, were leaving the old West to become entertainers, and they battled great Native American chiefs like Sitting Bull, Chief Joseph, and Geronimo only in Wild West Shows. In 1890 the United States Census Bureau formally closed the American frontier, ending the system under which land in the Western territories had been sold cheaply to pioneers. [...] As a [...] "soldier of fortune", as Richard Harding Davis later called him, Burnham began to look elsewhere for the next undeveloped frontier, feeling that the American West was becoming tame and unchallenging. When he heard of the work of Cecil Rhodes and his pioneers in southern Africa, who were working to build a railway across Africa from Cape to Cairo, Burnham sold what little he owned. In 1893 with his wife and young son, he set sail for Durban in South Africa, intending to join Rhodes's pioneers in Matabeleland and Mashonaland.|$|E

500|$|Collins {{decided to}} record {{it in the}} late 1960s amid an {{atmosphere}} of counterculture introspection; {{she was part of}} an encounter group that ended a contentious meeting by singing [...] "Amazing Grace" [...] as it was the only song to which all the members knew the words. Her producer was present and suggested she include a version of it on her 1970 album Whales & Nightingales. Collins, who had a history of alcohol abuse, claimed that the song was able to [...] "pull her through" [...] to recovery. It was recorded in St. Paul's, the chapel at Columbia University, chosen for the acoustics. She chose an a cappella arrangement that was close to Edwin Othello Excell's, accompanied by a chorus of amateur singers who were friends of hers. Collins connected it to the Vietnam War, to which she objected: [...] "I didn't {{know what else to do}} about the war in Vietnam. I had marched, I had voted, I had gone to jail on political actions and worked for the candidates I believed in. The war was still raging. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> do, I thought... but sing 'Amazing Grace'." [...] Gradually and unexpectedly, the song began to be played on the radio, and then be requested. It rose to number 15 on the Billboard Hot 100, remaining on the charts for 15 weeks, as if, she wrote, her fans had been [...] "waiting to embrace it". In the UK, it charted 8 times between 1970 and 1972, peaking at number 5 and spending a total of 75 weeks on popular music charts. [...] Her rendition also reached number 5 in New Zealand and number 12 in Ireland in 1971.|$|E

He stated that it was what was caused the Great Fire of New York, that burned Manhattan during the American Revolutionary War. Weapons that generate Greek fire are discovered in George Washington's tomb when Ichabod Crane and Abbie Mills find their way there with aid from Agent Seeley Booth and Doctor Temperance [...] "Bones" [...] Brennan. A later episode, [...] "Blood from a Stone", had canisters of Greek fire.|$|E
2500|$|The Bf 110 also {{supported}} the German defence during Big Week in February 1944, as Lt. Gen.

2500|$|Early on {{the morning}} of Saturday 23 March, German troops broke through the line in the 14th Division sector on the canal at Jussy. The 54th Brigade were holding the line {{directly}} to their south and were initially unaware of their predicament, as they were unknowingly being outflanked and surrounded. The 54th Brigade History records [...] "the weather still favoured the Germans. Fog was thick over the rivers, canals and little valleys, so that he could bring up fresh masses of troops unseen". In the confusion, Brigade HQ tried to establish what was happening around Jussy and by late morning the British were retreating in front of German troops who had crossed the Crozat Canal at many points. All lines of defence had been overrun and <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> stop the German advance; during the day Aubigny, Brouchy, Cugny and Eaucourt fell.|$|E

In January 2017, HIM were also announced as the headliner of Miljoona Rock, held in Tuuri, Finland, on 18 July 2017. On 5 March 2017, HIM announced the band would be disbanding following a farewell tour that same year. In the announcement, Valo stated: [...] "After quarter of a century [...] of love and metal intertwined we sincerely feel HIM has run its unnatural course and adieus must be said in order to make way for sights, scents and sounds yet unexplored. We completed the pattern, solved the puzzle and turned the key. Thank you." [...] Valo further elaborated on the band's decision to call it quits later, stating: [...] "We got together and started playing some songs and thinking whats next [...] We felt like the new material wasn't taking flight. We got along well together, but something was lacking. The stars weren't in alignment." [...] He also went on to say that: [...] "We felt like <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>left</b> <b>to</b> give collectively. It was fun playing the old songs, everybody got along well together, but that spark was missing." [...] Valo didn't rule-out the possibility of the band reuniting in the future, stating: [...] "The good thing about this is that there's no drama [...] So it doesn't hurt the chances." ...|$|E
