5|$|<b>Things</b> <b>changed</b> when Ivan Basso's team {{came forward}} on the third climb {{of the day to}} set a much faster pace in the peloton, and Basso himself {{attacked}} and came free, with only Stefano Garzelli holding his wheel. They caught some members of the morning breakaway, as that group also splintered, but were eventually themselves caught. Danilo Di Luca launched an attack on the fourth climb of the day, and for a time he and Menchov were clear of the other GC contenders, but they were also caught — the top seven in the GC were unchanged after this stage.|$|E
5|$|The nose cone, which {{contained}} the ordnance that would impact the target, would {{separate from the}} rocket booster. This made the rocket lighter as only the nose cone and its ordnance {{had to be able}} to survive re-entry, rather than the rocket. The unique innovations of the Hiroc missiles, such as the gimballed engines, and the internally supported frame, would go on to inspire the Atlas rockets. Several <b>things</b> <b>changed</b> however, such as the aluminum used for the missiles skin of the Hiroc, was switched out for stainless steel in the Atlas, because stainless steel had a higher melting point. The engines of the Atlas missiles were also much stronger, generating a total of 150,000 pounds-force (667,000 Newtons), compared to the Hiroc's total of 8,000 pounds-force (35,585 Newtons).|$|E
5|$|The {{process was}} not without obstacles, however. The Neapolitan nobles distrusted Skanderbeg since the Kastrioti family had {{previously}} been allied with Venice. Alfonso himself had been offended when he asked Skanderbeg to attack Venice along with Đurađ Branković and the Albanian refused. Alfonso was also a devout Christian and found it uneasy to ally with Skanderbeg who had previously practiced Islam in the Ottoman court. On the other hand, Skanderbeg had been disillusioned when Alfonso failed to send any troops to Krujë when they were most needed. But <b>things</b> <b>changed</b> once Skanderbeg had thwarted the Ottoman Army. Both Venice and Alfonso grew an interest in expanding their powers in the Adriatic and the Ionian. On 26 March 1451, the Treaty of Gaeta was signed, creating an Albanian-Aragonese alliance.|$|E

5|$|<b>Things</b> <b>changed</b> in {{the early}} 1960s when McNamara placed limits on the Air Force fleet of 1,000 Minuteman {{missiles}} and 54 Titan IIs. This meant that the Air Force could not respond to new Soviet missiles simply by building more of their own. An even greater existential threat to Minuteman than Soviet missiles was the US Navy's Polaris missile fleet, whose invulnerability led to questions {{about the need for}} any ground-based ICBM. The Air Force responded by changing missions; the increasingly accurate Minuteman was now tasked with attacking Soviet missile silos, which the less accurate Navy missiles could not do. If the force was going to carry out this mission there had to be the expectation that enough missiles could survive a Soviet attack for a successful counterstrike. An ABM might provide that assurance.|$|E

25|$|The {{access to}} fresh water is {{excellent}} in Stockholm today, {{in contrast to}} the historically horrible state of things, when lakes and watercourses were used as refuse dumps and latrines, causing epidemic cholera and many other diseases. By the 1860s <b>things</b> <b>changed,</b> as water fetched from Årstaviken, the waters south of Södermalm, was treated in the first water-purifying plant at Skanstull and from there distributed through water mains.|$|E
25|$|Since the 15th century Joseon, however, <b>things</b> <b>changed</b> {{with the}} {{adoption}} of Neo-Confucianism as state ideology. Non-Confucian religions were suppressed and Muism was disregarded as backwards. In the late 19th and 20th century, a series of factors have concurred {{to the destruction of}} Muism, leading to the dismemberment of the fabric of Korean society, which has ultimately {{paved the way for the}} growth of Christianity and Buddhism in Korea.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} {{evolution}} for Kfarsghab was the massive {{attraction of the}} monastic orders especially that of the Lebanese Maronite Order solidly installed in the neighbouring Monastery of Qozhaya.

Between 1850 and 1875, <b>things</b> <b>changed</b> dramatically. In this period, more than 23 monks from Kfarsghab took their vows.|$|E

25|$|Most {{observers}} expected Chiang's {{government to}} eventually fall {{in response to}} a Communist invasion of Taiwan, and the United States initially showed no interest in supporting Chiang's government in its final stand. <b>Things</b> <b>changed</b> radically with the onset of the Korean War in June 1950. At this point, allowing a total Communist victory over Chiang became politically impossible in the United States, and President Harry S. Truman ordered the United States Seventh Fleet into the Taiwan Strait to prevent the ROC and PRC from attacking each other.|$|E
25|$|<b>Things</b> <b>changed</b> {{in early}} 2007, with new National leader John Key {{improving}} on Brash's preferred Prime Minister rating by ten points, and overtaking Clark as preferred Prime Minister in May; {{at the same}} time National jumped out to a sizeable lead over Labour ranging from between eight and eighteen points, spending most of 2007 and 2008 with support from around fifty percent of the electorate. Labour's popularity slumped, hitting its lowest point in the winter of 2008, before beginning a slow climb into the high thirties in August and September.|$|E
25|$|<b>Things</b> <b>changed,</b> however, in 1934 when {{miners and}} smeltermen revitalized the union.

There were also union locals in non-ferrous smelters in New Jersey – in Perth Amboy at the American Smelting and Refining Company (ASARCO), and in Carteret at the U.S. Metals Company. The union was one of the original members of the Committee for Industrial Organizing, which later transformed itself into the Congress of Industrial Organizations.|$|E

25|$|Young Anastasiya Vertinskaya was {{thinking}} of a career in linguistics, but <b>things</b> <b>changed</b> overnight in 1961 when the then sixteen-year-old was approached personally by the film director Aleksandr Ptushko {{for the role of}} Assol in Scarlet Sails. The romantic teenage drama based on Alexander Grin's novel became an instant success, making Anastasiya a national celebrity. Many of the future stars of Soviet cinema, including Vasily Lanovoy, Ivan Pereverzev, Sergey Martinson, and Oleg Anofriev, were in the cast, but, as critics noted, it was Vertinskaya's passionate performance that gave Scarlet Sails its flavour. 23 million people viewed the film during its first year.|$|E

Both claimed criminal violations and demanded that the company cease operations. In response, the company, among other <b>things,</b> <b>changed</b> its name from UberCab to Uber. In the fall of 2012, the CPUC issued a cease-and-desist letter to Uber, Lyft, and SideCar) and fined each $20,000. However, an interim agreement was reached in 2013 reversing those actions.|$|E

25|$|<b>Things</b> <b>changed</b> {{dramatically}} {{with the}} development of Hercules. By the early 1950s the Air Force was still struggling with their own long-range weapon systems, originally started in the 1940s in the GAPA project. The project had moved several times, and was now in late development as the BOMARC. BOMARC proved extremely expensive, difficult to maintain in operation readiness, had questionable performance and was displaying a continued inability to reach operational status. Instead of de-emphasizing BOMARC in favor of Hercules, inter-service rivalry became rampant, and the Air Force began a policy of denigrating Hercules and the Army using policy by press release.|$|E
25|$|The Bloc {{continued}} to slide {{in most of}} the 2003 opinion polls following the 2003 Quebec election which was won by the federalist Quebec Liberal Party led by Jean Charest. However, <b>things</b> <b>changed</b> during the winter of 2003. The federalist Charest government lost popularity. Then, in February 2004, the Auditor General of Canada uncovered the sponsorship scandal, suggesting illegality in the spending of federal monies in Quebec in support of Canadian unity. As well, the Liberal government of Jean Chrétien passed party financing legislation that resulted in the Bloc receiving millions of dollars in subsidies that helped to stabilize its organization.|$|E
25|$|Initially, the {{conflict}} with Zionism helped to make Palestinian Arab society more conservative in cultural, social, religious and political affairs because people were highly motivated to preserve their distinct heritage and identity against the dual impact of British colonialism and Jewish innovation. Traditionally, the Arabs had an elite, but not a real leadership. Both of these <b>things</b> <b>changed</b> {{over the course of}} the 1930s. During this period new political organizations and new types of activist began to appear, marking the involvement of a far broader cross-section of the population; in particular, nationalism, which had been long-rooted in rural society began to take hold in urban society.|$|E
