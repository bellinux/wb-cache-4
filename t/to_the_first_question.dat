25|$|The main {{interest}} of the questionnaire was {{to see if a}} participant answered yes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>question,</b> implying that they believed in the hot-hand fallacy. The results showed that participants over 70 years of age were twice as likely to believe the fallacy than adults 40–49, confirming that the older individuals relied more on heuristic-based processes. Older adults are more likely to remember positive information, making them more sensitive to gains and less to losses than younger adults.|$|E
25|$|The answer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>question</b> is {{provided}} by introducing the Zariski topology, a topology on An whose closed sets are the algebraic sets, and which directly reflects the algebraic structure of k. Then U = V(I(U)) {{if and only if}} U is an algebraic set or equivalently a Zariski-closed set. The answer to the second question is given by Hilbert's Nullstellensatz. In one of its forms, it says that I(V(S)) is the radical of the ideal generated by S. In more abstract language, there is a Galois connection, giving rise to two closure operators; they can be identified, and naturally play a basic role in the theory; the example is elaborated at Galois connection.|$|E

500|$|Gordon-Cumming was {{replaced}} in the witness box by the prince. Examined by Clarke, {{he stated that}} he had not seen any cheating, and was ignorant of the accusations until he was told by Coventry and Williams. After 20 minutes of questions from both Clarke and Russell, the prince was free to depart. As the prince was leaving the witness box, a member of the jury put two questions to Edward: whether the heir had seen [...] "nothing of the alleged malpractices of the plaintiff?", and [...] "what was your Royal Highness's opinion at the time as to the charges made against Sir William Gordon-Cumming?" [...] <b>To</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>question</b> the prince replied {{that he had not}}, although he explained that [...] "it is not usual for a banker to see anything in dealing cards"; to the second, he stated that [...] "the charges appeared to be so unanimous that it was the proper course—no other course was open to me—than to believe them". In comparison with Gordon-Cumming's performance in the witness box, Edward did not make a strong impression; the reporter for The New York Times noticed [...] "that the heir apparent was decidedly fidgety, that he kept changing his position, and that he did not seem able to keep his hands still... Except to those near him, only two or three of his answers were fairly audible throughout the courtroom". The Daily News agreed, and stated that the impression gained from the prince's performance was unfavourable.|$|E

2500|$|Stevens {{returned}} to the United States in March 1908 to visit his family in Washington, D.C. and vacation with his sisters at a cottage they owned in Atlantic City, New Jersey. Upon his arrival, he gave {{an interview with a}} San Francisco newspaper in which he stated that the common people of Korea were benefiting from the increasing Japanese presence and protection in their country, and that, in the state that Korea was in, Korea was not fit to be a liberated country. These statements provoked the ire of two local associations of Koreans, the Daedong Bogukhoe and the Independence Club, who held a joint meeting in which they agreed that {{something had to be done}} about Stevens. On March 22, 1908, four Korean men chosen by the associations accosted Stevens at the Fairmont Hotel, where he was staying. Their leader, a man by the name of Earl Lee who was described as fluent in English, asked him if he had indeed made the statements attributed to him in the newspaper, and whether [...] "Japanese were not killing off the Koreans". He answered yes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>question</b> and no to the second, then proceeded to tell Lee that he had [...] "probably been too long away from his country to know the exact condition of the Government." [...] Upon this, the four men began to strike Stevens with chairs, knocking him down and causing him to strike his head against the marble flooring; Stevens backed up against the wall until help arrived. After the assault, Lee was quoted as saying, [...] "We are all very sorry that we did not do more to him." ...|$|E
