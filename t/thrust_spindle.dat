40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the application of}} optimization method developed by Hashimoto to design oil lubricated thrust bearings for 2. 5 inch form factor hard disk drives (HDD). The designing involves optimization of groove geometry and dimensions. Calculations are carried out to maximize the dynamic stiffness of the <b>thrust</b> bearing <b>spindle</b> motor. Static and dynamic characteristics of the modeled thrust bearing are calculated using the divergence formulation method. Results show that, by using the proposed optimization method, dynamic stiffness values can be well improved with the bearing geometries not being fixed to conventional grooves...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Drilling is an {{important}} and final operation in the assembly of structural components of aircraft and automobiles. This paper determines the influence of cutting forces in the drilling of GF/PC composites. An assembly, {{the quality of the}} drilled holes highly affects the joint of two or more structural components. Drilling of glass fiber composite materials is a vital task for manufacturers. The best methodology for achieving good quality holes during the drilling of glass fiber reinforced plastics is by identify of the cutting forces. Improper cutting forces lead to the damage of composite materials. This paper studies the influence of various feed rate on <b>thrust</b> force, <b>spindle</b> speed and drill bit geometry using Brad and spur drills. This experimental result shows that delamination fully depends on the feed rate. The experimental results have been clearly explained with the help of 3 D response graph and Scanning Electron Microscopic (SEM) images...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{influence}} of process cutting parameters such as feed rate, drill diameter, type of drill bit and <b>spindle</b> speed on <b>thrust</b> force produced on drilling of Glass Fiber Reinforced Thermoplastic polymer (GFRTP) Composite material is being studied. Thrust force {{is an important}} and un-avoidable parameter in hole making operation. Drilling is final and important operation in assembly of components. Drilling of thermoplastic composite materials should have good interlaminer quality and dimensional stability. Drilling is not properly done then it affects the mating of two components, assembly tolerance, reduces the performance and decreases the number of cycle per components. Experiment is conducted with help of Vertical Machining Center (VMC). Input parameter is taken in account of Solid Carbide material Brad and spur drill bit with three different drill diameters like 6, 9 and 12 mm. The experimental result indicate that feed rate and drill diameter is the important factor for {{the increase in the}} <b>thrust</b> force and <b>spindle</b> speed is the man factor for change in torque by using Design of Experiments (DOE). The optimization of cutting parameters during drill is carried out using Box-Behnken Design and analysis of variance (ANOVA) ...|$|R
