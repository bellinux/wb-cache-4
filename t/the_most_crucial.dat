5|$|By the 11th century {{mainland}} southern Longobard and Byzantine {{powers were}} hiring Norman mercenaries, who were {{descendants of the}} Vikings; it was the Normans under Roger I who conquered Sicily, taking {{it away from the}} Arab Muslims. After taking Apulia and Calabria, Roger occupied Messina with an army of 700 knights. In 1068, Roger I of Sicily and his men defeated the Muslims at Misilmeri but <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>crucial</b> battle was the siege of Palermo, which led to Sicily being completely under Norman control by 1091.|$|E
5|$|The Komnenian {{period was}} {{followed}} by the dynasty of the Angeloi, who oversaw perhaps <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>crucial</b> period in the Decline of the Byzantine Empire. The next quarter of a century would see Constantinople fall to an invading force {{for the first time in}} its history, and the final loss of the empire's 'great power' status. However, with the death of Andronikos, the Komnenian dynasty, having lasted 104 years, had finally come to an end.|$|E
5|$|The main plant foods {{gathered}} were walnuts, saguaro fruits, juniper berries, acorns, sunflower seeds, manzanita {{berries and}} apples, hackberries, the bulbs of the Quamash, and the greens of the Lamb's quarters, Scrophularia, and Lupinus plants. Agave was <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>crucial</b> harvest, {{as it was}} the only plant food available from late fall through early spring. The hearts of the plant were roasted in stone-lined pits, and could be stored for later use. Primary animals hunted were deer, rabbit, jackrabbit, quail, and woodrat. Fish and water-borne birds were eschewed by most Yavapai groups. Some groups of Tolkepaya began eating fish after contact with their Quechan neighbors.|$|E

5|$|The stunt {{simulating}} Lange's {{fall into}} the subway train was filmed on August 27, the second production day, and Yoshimura {{said that it was}} the most challenging part of the shoot. D'Onofrio and MacVittie had to arrive at the platform just as the subway train was approaching, and their scene had to be reshot several times because the train did not pass the actors on time. The crew also filmed shots of a dummy dressed as Lange being dragged by the train inside the dummy wall, but most of those scenes were not used in the final cut. The remaining five filming days focused primarily on the scenes between Braugher and D'Onofrio, which Yoshimura and Fleder felt were <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>crucial</b> element of the episode. During the filming of the climactic scene with Pembleton and Lange which ends with Lange's death, several members of the crew reacted emotionally, something Yoshimura said is extremely rare because the crew members typically look at their work as a job and do not become emotionally invested in the story that they are filming.|$|E

25|$|Although {{most studies}} {{arrive at the}} {{conclusion}} of negative long-term outcomes e.g. increased pocketing & attachment loss after surgery, it is clear that early removal (before 25 years old), good post-operative hygiene & plaque control, and lack of pre-existing periodontal pathology before surgery are <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>crucial</b> factors that minimise the probability of adverse post-surgical outcomes.|$|E
25|$|As CIGS, Brooke had {{a strong}} {{influence}} on the grand strategy of the Western Allies. The war in the west unfolded more or less according to his plans, at least until 1943 when the American forces still were relatively small {{in comparison to the}} British.

40|$|This {{working paper}} reports the {{findings}} of a research investigation which aimed to identify the factors/strategic capabilities which lead to management consulting success. The study also aimed to find out what management consultants consider to be the actual performance indicators of consulting success and whether these were related to the factors/strategic capabilities. The research design for this study was a modified Generative Strategy. Several data collection methods, namely, interviews, content analysis and questionnaires, were used to generate both qualitative and quantitative data. Twenty-one factors were identified. These were subsumed under the two broad categories of (1) Functions and (2) Skills and Values. <b>The</b> three <b>most</b> critical functions identified, in descending order, were quality of service, setting objectives and solving problems. <b>The</b> three <b>most</b> <b>crucial</b> skills/ values were, integrity and honesty, client-consultant commimication and credibility. Ten performance indicators were identified. Of these, <b>the</b> three <b>most</b> <b>crucial,</b> as identified by the respondents, were, customer satisfaction, profitability and repeat business.

It is therefore {{very important that we}} learn how to be successful advocacy journalists. For many, this will require a different way of identifying and pursuing goals.|$|R
25|$|Old Faroese (miðaldarføroyskt, ca. mid-14th to mid-16th centuries) {{is a form}} of Old Norse {{spoken in}} medieval times in the Faroe Islands. The {{language}} shares many features with both Old Icelandic and Old Norwegian; Old Norwegian appears closer to Old Faroese, whereas Old Icelandic remained rather archaic compared to other medieval varieties of Old West Norse. <b>The</b> <b>most</b> <b>crucial</b> aspects of the development of Faroese are diphthongisation and palatalisation.|$|E
25|$|In November 1956, Dulles {{strongly}} opposed the Anglo-French {{invasion of the}} Suez Canal zone {{in response to the}} Suez Crisis. During <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>crucial</b> days he was hospitalized after surgery and did not participate in Washington's decision-making. However, by 1958 Dulles had become an outspoken opponent of President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt and prevented him from receiving arms from the United States. This policy allowed the Soviet Union to gain influence in Egypt.|$|E
25|$|As in any {{infrastructure}} asset, railways {{must keep}} up with periodic inspection and maintenance {{in order to minimize}} effect of infrastructure failures that can disrupt freight revenue operations and passenger services. Because passengers are considered <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>crucial</b> cargo and usually operate at higher speeds, steeper grades, and higher capacity/frequency, their lines are especially important. Inspection practices include track geometry cars or walking inspection. Curve maintenance especially for transit services includes gauging, fastener tightening, and rail replacement.|$|E
50|$|The WWF has {{identified}} 867 terrestrial ecoregions across the Earth's land surface, {{as well as}} freshwater and marine ecoregions.

The once-optimistic picture for the Chiefs went {{from bad to worse}} the following week when backup QB Jacky Lee went down with a broken ankle in a 24-19 loss at Cincinnati (9/28). That injury left <b>the</b> team's <b>most</b> <b>crucial</b> position in <b>the</b> hands of second-year QB Mike Livingston, who took just five snaps as a rookie in ‘68.|$|R
25|$|Sessions in July 1942 {{produced}} nine prime sides, allowing Decca {{to stockpile}} Jordan's recordings {{as a hedge}} against the recording ban declared by the American Federation of Musicians in the same month. The ban—imposed {{in order to secure}} royalty payments for union musicians for each record sold—led to Jordan's enforced absence from the studio for the next year, and it also prevented many seminal bebop performers from recording during one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>crucial</b> years of the genre's history.|$|E
25|$|By the 11th century, {{mainland}} southern Italian {{powers were}} hiring ferocious Norman mercenaries, who were Christian {{descendants of the}} Vikings; it was the Normans under Roger I who conquered Sicily from the Muslims. After taking Apulia and Calabria, he occupied Messina with an army of 700 knights. In 1068, Robert Guiscard and his men defeated the Muslims at Misilmeri; but <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>crucial</b> battle was the siege of Palermo, which led to Sicily being completely in Norman control by 1091.|$|E
25|$|Newman {{outlined}} {{his claims}} about {{there being a}} fundamental electromagnetic interaction in all matter ultimately derived from only one type of force particle propagating {{at the speed of}} light. Newman claims that the motor derives its power by converting some of the mass of the copper in the coils into usable energy, in application of Einstein's Mass–energy equivalence. According to proponents of the Energy Machine, <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>crucial</b> part of the design concerns what happens as a result of mechanical commutation.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the combat}} photographers {{were able to}} shoot images of the trek {{to and from the}} camp, they were unable to use their cameras during the night-time raid, as the flashes would {{indicate}} their positions to the Japanese. One of the photographers reflected on the nighttime hindrance: [...] "We felt like an eager soldier who had carried his rifle for long distances into one of <b>the</b> war's <b>most</b> <b>crucial</b> battles, then {{never got a chance to}} fire it." [...] The Signal Corps photographers instead assisted with escorting the POWs out of the camp.|$|R
5000|$|Kant's {{theory of}} {{aesthetic}} judgments remains a highly debated aesthetic theory until today. It {{is important to}} note that Kant uses the term [...] "aesthetics" [...] ("Ästhetik") to refer to any sensual experience. <b>The</b> work <b>most</b> <b>crucial</b> to aesthetics as a strand of philosophy is the first half of his Critique of the Power of Judgment, the Critique of the Aesthetic Power of Judgment. It is subdivided in two main parts - the Analytic of the Beautiful and the Analytic of the Sublime, but also deals with the experience of fine art.|$|R
50|$|Although the Jazāyerchi were an {{infantry}} corps {{they usually}} campaigned on mounts and occasionally fought as mounted troops also, (as some units did at Karnal).

25|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>crucial</b> {{developments}} of trans-hemispheric relations for Canada during Mulroney’s time in office came in Canada’s official {{enrollment in the}} OAS in 1990. Until this point Canada’s position on the institution was that it existed {{as a tool of}} American political and economic preponderance in Latin America. However, with the erosion of Cold War tensions, waning American hegemonic interests in the region, and the proliferation of democracy throughout Latin America Canada saw the increasing importance of the OAS as a unifying institution.|$|E
25|$|In viticulture, {{ripeness}} is {{the completion}} of the ripening process of wine grapes on the vine which signals the beginning of harvest. What exactly constitutes ripeness will vary depending on what style of wine is being produced (sparkling, still, fortified, rosé, dessert wine, etc.) and what the winemaker and viticulturist personally believe constitutes ripeness. Once the grapes are harvested, the physical and chemical components of the grape which will influence a wine's quality are essentially set so determining the optimal moment of ripeness may be considered <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>crucial</b> decision in winemaking.|$|E
