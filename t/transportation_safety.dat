5|$|An {{estimated}} 2 million {{pieces of}} debris were recovered and brought ashore for inspection at a secure handling facility in a marine industrial park at Sheet Harbour, where small material was hand inspected by teams of RCMP officers looking for human remains, personal effects, and valuables from the aircraft's cargo hold. The material was then transported to CFB Shearwater, {{where it was}} assembled and inspected by over 350investigators from multiple organizations, such as the <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> Board of Canada, U.S. National <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> Board, U.S. Federal Aviation Authority (FAA), Air Accidents Investigation Branch, Boeing, Pratt & Whitney, and Swissair.|$|E
5|$|The National <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> Board (NTSB) {{concluded}} that the crash {{was caused by the}} captain's improper execution of an instrument approach, combined with a severe downdraft at a low altitude, which resulted in the aircraft descending uncontrollably into terrain.|$|E
5|$|The National <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> Board {{determines that}} the {{probable}} {{cause of this}} accident was the flight crew's operation of the airplane below the minimum descent altitude without an appropriate visual reference for the runway.|$|E

5|$|According to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), the Cirrus SR20 aircraft, tail number N929CD, {{was owned}} by Lidle. On May 1, 2007, the National <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> Board (NTSB) stated that the {{probable}} cause of the crash was pilot error.

5|$|Although not {{the pilot}} in command, {{according}} to the cockpit voice recorder transcript, the first officer was the pilot flying {{at the time of}} the accident.

5|$|June 20, 1998: A Greyhound bus on a {{scheduled}} trip from New York City to Pittsburgh ran off a road near Burnt Cabins, Pennsylvania, {{and hit a}} truck parked in an emergency parking area. Six passengers and the driver died. The National <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> Board determined that the probable cause of the accident was the driver's use of a sedating antihistamine and driver fatigue, due to an irregular work-rest schedule.|$|E
5|$|National <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> Board (NTSB) and Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) {{investigations}} {{determined that}} evasive maneuvers undertaken by Flight 663 {{to avoid an}} oncoming Pan Am Boeing 707 caused the pilot to suffer spatial disorientation and lose control of the aircraft. The accident is the third-worst accident involving a DC-7.|$|E
5|$|The National <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> Board {{investigated}} {{the accident and}} published a detailed final report eleven months later on March 11, 1997. From the official point of view, the pilot in command was flight instructor Reid, who {{was the only one}} on board rated to fly the aircraft. The investigation focused on his decision-making prior to takeoff and his actions once airborne.|$|E

5|$|The {{accident}} was {{investigated by the}} Brazilian Air Force Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Center (CENIPA) and the U.S. National <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> Board (NTSB). The NTSB, {{in accordance with the}} provisions of ICAO Annex 13, participated in the investigation representing the state of manufacture of the Boeing, state of registry and operator of the Embraer, and state of manufacture of the Honeywell avionics equipment installed in both planes.|$|E
5|$|The {{recovery}} operation {{was guided by}} the <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> Board of Canada (TSB) with resources from the Canadian Forces, Canadian Coast Guard, RCMP, and other agencies. The area was surveyed using route survey sonar, laser line scanners, and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) to locate items. After being located, the debris was then recovered (initially by divers and ROVs, later by dredging and trawling).|$|E
5|$|A {{subsequent}} {{investigation by}} the National <b>Transportation</b> <b>Safety</b> Board (NTSB) confirmed the aircraft had impacted birds during take-off. Due to loss {{of power in the}} left engine, the flight crew were unable to control their aircraft before it struck the roof of the apartment building. The investigation further determined the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and officials at DeKalb–Peachtree Airport were aware of the danger of birds at the airport after a landfill site had opened {{in the vicinity of the}} airport ten years before the accident.|$|E
