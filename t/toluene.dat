5|$|TiCl4 is soluble in <b>toluene</b> and chlorocarbons, as {{are other}} {{non-polar}} species. Evidence exists that certain arenes form complexes {{of the type}} +. TiCl4 reacts exothermically with donor solvents such as THF to give hexacoordinated adducts. Bulkier ligands (L) give pentacoordinated adducts TiCl4L.|$|E
5|$|A stereospecific form of (S)-mephedrone {{could be}} {{prepared}} via Friedel–Crafts acylation. The {{first step in}} the synthesis would be to react <b>toluene</b> and (S)-N-trifluoroacetylalanoyl chloride in the presence of aluminium chloride, then deprotect the intermediate with hydrochloric acid-propyl alcohol. This would produce (S)-4-methylcathinone, which could then be methylated to produce mephedrone.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{procedure}} {{described in the}} 1975 Aron patent, and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Encyclopedia, equimolar amounts of dimethylamine and 2-cyanoguanidine are dissolved in <b>toluene</b> with cooling to make a concentrated solution, and an equimolar amount of hydrogen chloride is slowly added. The mixture begins to boil on its own, and after cooling, metformin hydrochloride precipitates with a 96% yield.|$|E
5|$|The DMT {{group is}} removed with a {{solution}} of an acid, such as 2% trichloroacetic acid (TCA) or 3% dichloroacetic acid (DCA), in an inert solvent (dichloromethane or <b>toluene).</b> The orange-colored DMT cation formed is washed out; the step results in the solid support-bound oligonucleotide precursor bearing a free 5'-terminal hydroxyl group.|$|E
5|$|A {{man from}} Northern Ireland was {{discussed}} in the media {{in connection with the}} disappearance. After being released from prison for the sexual assault of his four daughters, he had moved to Carvoeiro, Portugal, not far from Praia da Luz, and was there when Madeleine went missing. He died in 2013. Another focus of Operation Grange was Urs Hans von Aesch, a deceased Swiss man implicated in the 2007 murder, in Switzerland, of five-year-old Ylenia Lenhard. Ylenia disappeared on 31 July 2007, nearly three months after Madeleine, and was found dead in September as a result of <b>toluene</b> poisoning. Von Aesch was living in Spain when Madeleine disappeared.|$|E
5|$|Neptunocene, Np(C8H8)2, was {{synthesized}} in 1970 by reacting neptunium(IV) chloride with K2(C8H8). It is isomorphous to uranocene and plutonocene, {{and they}} behave chemically identically: all three compounds are insensitive to water or dilute bases but {{are sensitive to}} air, reacting quickly to form oxides, and are only slightly soluble in benzene and <b>toluene.</b> Other known neptunium cyclooctatetraenyl derivatives include Np(RC8H7)2 (R = ethanol, butanol) and KNp(C8H8)·2THF, which is isostructural to the corresponding plutonium compound. In addition, neptunium hydrocarbyls have been prepared, and solvated triiodide complexes of neptunium are a precursor to many organoneptunium and inorganic neptunium compounds.|$|E
5|$|The 18-valence {{electron}} rhodium(III) pentadienediyl species {{generated by}} this reaction demonstrates again {{the instability of}} the rhodocene moiety, in {{that it can be}} refluxed in <b>toluene</b> for months without 1,2,3-tri-tert-butylrhodocene forming but in oxidising conditions the 1,2,3-tri-tert-butylrhodocenium cation forms rapidly. Cyclic voltammetry has been used to investigate this and similar processes in detail. The mechanism of the reaction has been shown to involve a loss of one electron from the pentadienediyl ligand followed by a fast rearrangement (with loss of a hydrogen atom) to form the 1,2,3-tri-tert-butylrhodocenium cation. Both the tetrafluoroborate and hexafluorophosphate salts of this cation have been structurally characterised by X-ray crystallography.|$|E
25|$|Where a {{chemical}} complex has similar demands for both benzene and xylene, then <b>toluene</b> disproportionation (TDP) {{may be an}} attractive alternative to the <b>toluene</b> hydrodealkylation. In the broad sense, 2 <b>toluene</b> molecules are reacted and the methyl groups rearranged from one <b>toluene</b> molecule to the other, yielding one benzene molecule and one xylene molecule.|$|E
25|$|<b>Toluene</b> is now {{often used}} as a {{substitute}} for benzene, for instance as a fuel additive. The solvent-properties of the two are similar, but <b>toluene</b> is less toxic and has a wider liquid range. <b>Toluene</b> is also processed into benzene.|$|E
25|$|Four {{chemical}} processes contribute to industrial benzene production: catalytic reforming, <b>toluene</b> hydrodealkylation, <b>toluene</b> disproportionation, and steam cracking. According to the ATSDR Toxicological Profile for benzene, between 1978 and 1981, catalytic reformats accounted for approximately 44–50% {{of the total}} U.S benzene production.|$|E
25|$|In the Lummus Process, the {{oxidation}} of <b>toluene</b> to {{benzoic acid}} is conducted separately.|$|E
25|$|A typical {{reaction}} yield exceeds 95%. Sometimes, xylenes {{and heavier}} aromatics {{are used in}} place of <b>toluene,</b> with similar efficiency.|$|E
25|$|The {{reaction}} is conducted in THF. Workup sometimes washing with hydrochloric acid to convert hydrolysis derivatives to the dichloride. Recrystallization from <b>toluene</b> forms acicular crystals.|$|E
25|$|This {{reaction}} is conducted under a nitrogen atmosphere and by using THF as solvent. The product is purified by soxhlet extraction using <b>toluene</b> as solvent.|$|E
25|$|The {{compound}} Fe(COT)2, when refluxed in <b>toluene</b> with {{dimethyl sulfoxide}} and dimethoxyethane for 5 days, {{is found to}} form magnetite and crystalline carbon also containing carbon nanotubes.|$|E
25|$|A site in Burlington, Massachusetts which RCA {{used from}} 1958 to 1994 {{to make and}} test {{military}} electronics equipment, generated hazardous waste (VOCs, TCE, <b>toluene,</b> ethylbenzene, and xylenes).|$|E
25|$|The great {{majority}} of phosgene {{is used in the}} production of isocyanates, the most important being <b>toluene</b> diisocyanate (TDI) and methylene diphenyl diisocyanate (MDI). These two isocyanates are precursors to polyurethanes.|$|E
25|$|Benzoic acid is {{produced}} commercially by partial oxidation of <b>toluene</b> with oxygen. The process is catalyzed by cobalt or manganese naphthenates. The process uses abundant materials, and proceeds in high yield.|$|E
25|$|As the solvent in {{some types}} of paint thinner, contact cement and model {{airplane}} glue, <b>toluene</b> is sometimes used as a recreational inhalant and {{has the potential of}} causing severe neurological harm.|$|E
25|$|Boc {{anhydride}} is {{also available}} as a 70% solution in <b>toluene</b> or THF. As boc anhydride may melt at ambient temperatures, its storage and handling is sometimes simplified by using a solution.|$|E
25|$|An organic Rankine cycle (ORC) {{waste heat}} {{recovery}} unit can be more efficient at low temperature range using refrigerants that boil at lower temperatures than water. Typical organic refrigerants are ammonia, pentafluoropropane (R-245fa and R-245ca), and <b>toluene.</b>|$|E
25|$|DCC {{has also}} been {{prepared}} from dicyclohexylurea using a phase transfer catalyst by Jaszay et al. The disubstituted urea, arenesulfonyl chloride, and potassium carbonate react in <b>toluene</b> {{in the presence of}} benzyl triethylammonium chloride to give DCC in 50% yield.|$|E
25|$|Diethylzinc (C2H5)2Zn, or DEZ, is {{a highly}} {{pyrophoric}} organozinc compound consisting of a zinc center bound to two ethyl groups. This colourless liquid is an important reagent in organic chemistry and available commercially as a solution in hexanes, heptane, or <b>toluene.</b>|$|E
25|$|If, for {{environmental}} or other reasons, a solvent or solvent blend {{is required to}} replace another of equivalent solvency, the substitution can {{be made on the}} basis of the Hansen solubility parameters of each. The values for mixtures are taken as the weighted averages of the values for the neat solvents. This can be calculated by trial-and-error, a spreadsheet of values, or HSP software. A 1:1 mixture of <b>toluene</b> and 1,4 dioxane has δD, δP and δH values of 17.8, 1.6 and 5.5, comparable to those of chloroform at 17.8, 3.1 and 5.7 respectively. Because of the health hazards associated with <b>toluene</b> itself, other mixtures of solvents may be found using a full HSP dataset.|$|E
25|$|The flowing {{movement}} of flammable liquids like gasoline inside a pipe can build up static electricity. Non-polar liquids such as gasoline, <b>toluene,</b> xylene, diesel, kerosene and light crude oils exhibit significant ability for charge accumulation and charge retention during high velocity flow. Electrostatic discharges can ignite the fuel vapor.|$|E
25|$|Certain toxins, such as lead, mercury, <b>toluene,</b> and PCB are {{well-known}} {{causes of}} neuro-developmental disorders. Recognition of these risks {{has led to}} evidence-based programmes of prevention, such as elimination of lead additives in petrol. Although these prevention campaigns are highly successful, most were initiated only after substantial delays.|$|E
25|$|The Arrhenius {{definitions}} of acidity and alkalinity {{are restricted to}} aqueous solutions, and refer to the concentration of the solvent ions. Under this definition, pure H2SO4 and HCl dissolved in <b>toluene</b> are not acidic, and molten NaOH and solutions of calcium amide in liquid ammonia are not alkaline.|$|E
25|$|Process by Mitsubishi Gas Chemicals (not commercialized): Here, {{a complex}} between <b>toluene</b> and {{hydrogen}} fluoride/boron trifluoride is formed and carbonylated with carbon monoxide {{to form a}} p-tolualdehyde complex. After decomposition of complex p-tolualdehyde can be oxidized in water with a manganese–bromine catalyst system to terephthalic acid.|$|E
25|$|As of 1999, 7000 tonnes of {{synthetic}} and 100 tonnes of natural benzaldehyde were produced annually. Liquid phase chlorination and oxidation of <b>toluene</b> {{are the main}} routes. Numerous other methods have been developed, such as the partial oxidation of benzyl alcohol, alkali hydrolysis of benzal chloride, and the carbonylation of benzene.|$|E
25|$|Benzoic acid {{is present}} {{as part of}} hippuric acid (N-benzoylglycine) in urine of mammals, {{especially}} herbivores (Gr. hippos = horse; ouron = urine). Humans produce about 0.44 g/L hippuric acid in their urine, and {{if the person is}} exposed to <b>toluene</b> or benzoic acid, it can rise above that level.|$|E
25|$|Organic {{solutions}} such anthracene or stilbene, {{dissolved in}} benzene or <b>toluene,</b> fluoresce with ultraviolet or gamma ray irradiation. The decay times of this fluorescence {{are of the}} order of nanoseconds, since the duration of the light depends on the lifetime of the excited states of the fluorescent material, in this case anthracene or stilbene.|$|E
25|$|Ethanol is a {{versatile}} solvent, miscible {{with water and}} with many organic solvents, including acetic acid, acetone, benzene, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, diethyl ether, ethylene glycol, glycerol, nitromethane, pyridine, and <b>toluene.</b> It is also miscible with light aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as pentane and hexane, and with aliphatic chlorides such as trichloroethane and tetrachloroethylene.|$|E
25|$|In the 19th {{and early}} 20th centuries, benzene {{was used as}} an after-shave lotion because of its {{pleasant}} smell. Prior to the 1920s, benzene was frequently used as an industrial solvent, especially for degreasing metal. As its toxicity became obvious, benzene was supplanted by other solvents, especially <b>toluene</b> (methylbenzene), which has similar physical properties but is not as carcinogenic.|$|E
25|$|As many {{as eight}} {{immiscible}} liquid phases have been observed. Mutually immiscible liquid phases are formed from water (aqueous phase), hydrophobic organic solvents, perfluorocarbons (fluorous phase), silicones, several different metals, and also from molten phosphorus. Not all organic solvents are completely miscible, e.g. a mixture of ethylene glycol and <b>toluene</b> may separate into two distinct organic phases.|$|E
25|$|Steam {{cracking}} is {{the process}} for producing ethylene and other alkenes from aliphatic hydrocarbons. Depending on the feedstock used to produce the olefins, steam cracking can produce a benzene-rich liquid by-product called pyrolysis gasoline. Pyrolysis gasoline can be blended with other hydrocarbons as a gasoline additive, or routed through an extraction process to recover BTX aromatics (benzene, <b>toluene</b> and xylenes).|$|E
25|$|The {{groundwater}} {{contains lead}} and {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) like benzene, xylene, and <b>toluene.</b> Several areas of underground petroleum-contaminated soil and floating petroleum product are the sources of continuing groundwater contamination. Ingesting or coming into direct contact with contaminated groundwater or soil can pose a potential health threat. Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-contaminated fish were {{also found in the}} area. Construction of the superfund site was complete in 1998.|$|E
