5|$|Although {{fewer than}} 10 {{percent of the}} 1846–68 Latter-day Saint emigrants made the journey west using {{handcart}}s, the handcart pioneers have become an important symbol in LDS culture, representing the faithfulness and sacrifice of the pioneer generation. <b>They</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> be recognized and honored in events such as Pioneer Day, Church pageants, and similar commemorations.|$|E
5|$|Although practised in Basse Casamance for centuries, rice {{cultivation}} has been threatened {{since the late}} 1960s. Productivity has declined because many workers have opted for life in the city, even though <b>they</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> support their community. The drought of the 1970s and 1980s further aggravated the situation.|$|E
5|$|Even if Mayors are {{required}} to vacate their seats in Parliament because Parliament has been dissolved or otherwise, <b>they</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> hold office until their terms of office expire or they are directed to vacate their office by the PA's board of management. As of January 2012, the Mayors are paid an annual salary of S$660,000 (US$486,500).|$|E

Episode One follows scientist Gordon Freeman and his companion Alyx Vance as <b>they</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> cope with the events chronicled in Half-Life 2 and humanity's continuing struggle against the Combine. The game was originally released in 2006 for Windows as a standalone game and was generally well received.|$|E

5|$|Making an {{exception}} for zero {{in the definition of}} evenness forces one to make such exceptions in the rules for even numbers. From another perspective, taking the rules obeyed by positive even numbers and requiring that <b>they</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> hold for integers forces the usual definition and the evenness of zero.|$|E

5|$|The {{opening of}} the fatwa {{displayed}} sympathy to the Muslims of Spain, who kept their religious faith despite the suffering and risk that this posed them. The mufti (author of the fatwa) exhorted that <b>they</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> adhere to the religion of Islam and instruct it to their children when the latter reached maturity.|$|E
5|$|After {{the opening}} on Downtown Line, Transport Minister Khaw Boon Wan {{announced}} that public transport fare rules will be reviewed {{to allow for}} transfers across MRT lines at different stations as the rail network is getting denser. Currently, commuters are charged a second time when they make such transfers. He added that the Public Transport Council (PTC) will review distance-based fare transfer rules to ensure <b>they</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> facilitate “fast, seamless” public transport journeys. The review of distance-based fare rules on MRT lines {{is expected to be}} completed in the first quarter in 2018.|$|E

5|$|Displays are {{classified}} as deimatic or aposematic by {{the responses of the}} animals that see them. Where predators are initially startled but learn to eat the displaying prey, the display is classed as deimatic, and the prey is bluffing; where <b>they</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> avoid the prey after tasting it, the display is taken as aposematic, meaning the prey is genuinely distasteful. However, these categories are not entirely mutually exclusive. It is possible for a behaviour to be both deimatic and aposematic, if it both startles a predator and indicates the presence of anti-predator adaptations.|$|E
5|$|During the 20th {{century and}} {{following}} the wide-scale adoption of the scientific method, astrology has been challenged successfully on both theoretical and experimental grounds, and {{has been shown to}} have no scientific validity or explanatory power. Astrology thus lost its academic and theoretical standing, and common belief in it has largely declined. While polling studies have demonstrated that approximately 25% of Americans, Canadians, and Britons say <b>they</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> believe that star and planet positions affect their lives, astrology is now recognized as pseudoscience.|$|E
5|$|Impacts {{are thought}} to be a regular (if {{currently}} infrequent) part of the evolution of the Solar System. That <b>they</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> happen is evidenced by the collision of Comet Shoemaker–Levy 9 with Jupiter in 1994, the 2009 Jupiter impact event, the Tunguska event, the Chelyabinsk meteor and the impact feature Meteor Crater in Arizona. The process of accretion, therefore, is not complete, and may still pose a threat to life on Earth.|$|E

In this installment, Veronica and Keith (Enrico Colantoni) search for Tom's missing son Josh (Jonathan Chase) while investigating a variety of alternate suspects. In addition, <b>they</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> question Mindy O'Dell (Jaime Ray Newman) and Hank Landry (Patrick Fabian) with regards to the death of Dean Cyrus O'Dell. Meanwhile, Logan (Jason Dohring), Parker (Julie Gonzalo), Mac (Tina Majorino), and Bronson (Michael Mitchell) attend a scavenger hunt for Valentine's Day.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} has established an Integration Office under the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Department of Economic Affairs. To minimise {{the negative consequences}} of Switzerland's isolation from the rest of Europe, Bern and Brussels signed seven bilateral agreements to further liberalise trade ties. These agreements were signed in 1999 and took effect in 2001. This first series of bilateral agreements included the free movement of persons. A second series covering nine areas was signed in 2004 and has since been ratified, which includes the Schengen Treaty and the Dublin Convention besides others. <b>They</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> discuss further areas for cooperation.|$|E
5|$|Working horses all but {{disappeared}} from Britain's streets by the 21st century; among few exceptions are heavy horses pulling brewers' wagons, or drays. However, when Young's Brewery ceased brewing in Wandsworth, London, in 2006, it ended more than 300years' use of dray horses by the brewery: its team of Shire horses was retired from delivery work and given a new career with the head horsekeeper, offering heavy horse team driving as a recreational event, although <b>they</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> appear at opening ceremonies for new Young's pubs and other publicity events.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time mercury was found in local fish at such high levels that {{consumption}} warnings were posted for fishermen. A Florida panther was found dead with levels of mercury high enough to kill a human. Scientists found that power plants and incinerators using fossil fuels were expelling mercury into the atmosphere, and it fell as rain or dust during droughts. The naturally occurring bacteria that reduce sulfur in the Everglades ecosystem were transforming the mercury into methylmercury, and it was bioaccumulating through the food chain. Stricter emissions standards helped lower mercury coming from power plants and incinerators, which in turn lowered mercury levels found in animals, though <b>they</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> be a concern.|$|E
5|$|Father Octavian orders them to set {{out through}} a cave system to reach the Byzantium, using a gravity globe to {{illuminate}} the cave. The Doctor and River comment on the various statues they pass, believing they are made by the planet's natives, until they recall the natives are two-headed beings and the statues are only single-headed. They conclude they must be weakened Weeping Angels, and that the Angel on the Byzantium purposely crashed the ship here to rescue its kind. The Angels start to pursue the group. Amy finds that she cannot move, and the Doctor realises {{that the image of}} the Angel still exists in her eye and is making her believe this; he bites her wrist to prove she is still mobile, and <b>they</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> flee.|$|E
5|$|Jagger {{was born}} {{and grew up in}} Dartford, Kent. He studied at the London School of Economics before abandoning his {{academic}} career to join the Rolling Stones. Jagger has written most of the Rolling Stones' songs together with Richards, and <b>they</b> <b>continue</b> <b>to</b> collaborate musically. In the late 1960s, Jagger began acting in films (starting with Performance and Ned Kelly), to a mixed reception. He began a solo career in 1985, releasing his first album, She's the Boss, and joined the electric supergroup SuperHeavy in 2009. Relationships with the Stones' members, particularly Richards, deteriorated during the 1980s, but Jagger has always found more success with the band than with his solo and side projects.|$|E
