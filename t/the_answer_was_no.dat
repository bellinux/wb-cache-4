60|$|He {{perceived}} too {{in these}} still hours how little he had understood her hitherto. He had been blinded,--obsessed. He {{had been seeing}} her and himself {{and the whole world}} far too much as a display of the eternal dualism of sex, the incessant pursuit. Now with his sexual imaginings newly humbled and hopeless, with a realization of her own tremendous minimization of that fundamental of romance, he began to see all that there was in her personality and their possible relations outside that. He saw how gravely and deeply serious was her fine philanthropy, how honest and simple and impersonal her desire for knowledge and understandings. There is the brain of her at least, he thought, far out of Sir Isaac's reach. She wasn't abased by her surrenders, their simplicity exalted her, showed her innocent and himself a flushed and congested soul. He perceived now with the astonishment of a man newly awakened just how the great obsession of sex had dominated him--for how many years? Since his early undergraduate days. Had he anything to put beside her own fine detachment? Had he ever since his manhood touched philosophy, touched a social question, thought of anything human, thought of art, or literature or belief, without a glancing reference of the whole question to the uses of this eternal hunt? During that time had he ever talked to a girl or woman with an unembarrassed sincerity? He stripped his pretences bare; <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>no.</b> His very refinements had been no more than indicative fig-leaves. His conservatism and morality had been a mere dalliance with interests that too brutal a simplicity might have exhausted prematurely. And indeed hadn't the whole period of literature that had produced him been, in its straining purity and refinement, as it were one glowing, one illuminated fig-leaf, a vast conspiracy to keep certain matters always in mind by conspicuously covering them away? But this wonderful woman--it seemed--she hadn't them in mind! She shamed him if only by her trustful unsuspiciousness of the ancient selfish game of Him and Her that he had been so ardently playing.... He idealized and worshipped this clean blindness. He abased himself before it.|$|E

In late 2002, producer Humbert Balsan authorized the US distributor of the film to release a statement which stated that Balsan had asked the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences if the film could run for best foreign language picture. According to Balsan, <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>no,</b> because [...] "Palestine is not a state we recognize in our rules."

5000|$|Based {{upon the}} Holmes standard, the Court held {{that in this}} case, Ideal could not {{maintain}} its section 1962(c) claim. The direct victim of National's mail and wire fraud was the State of New York, not Ideal. While the Court recognized Ideal may have been harmed by National's lower prices, this harm was caused by actions entirely distinct from the alleged actions constituting the RICO violation (the fraudulent tax reports). The Court also noted that although the attenuation between Ideal's harms and the claimed RICO violation arose from a different source than in Holmes (where the alleged violations were linked to the plaintiff's alleged harm only through a third party), the absence of proximate causation was equally clear in both cases. The Court explained that the proximate cause requirement could not be avoided by claiming the defendant intended to and did harm the plaintiff. [...] "When a court evaluates a RICO claim for proximate causation, the centralquestion it must ask is whether the alleged violation led directly to the plaintiff's injuries." [...] The Supreme Court held that, here, <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>no.</b>|$|E
50|$|Dr. James Rodman and Dr. Joseph Falk were {{appointed}} as faculty advisors. The FCC was contacted {{to see if}} there were any low power AM broadcast frequencies available for the school to use. <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>no.</b> Because of a limited budget FM broadcasting was not explored. Another possibility, not requiring FCC approval, was to superimpose a low power AM radio signal on the AC power lines running in the dormitories. By using any AM radio plugged into a dorm power outlet students could receive the signal. WKSU at Kent State University was known to have used this type of system at one time on their campus. Personnel at WKSU were contacted and most helpful including providing schematics and drawings for the design of the carrier current transmitters they had used. Parts for the transmitters were purchased and Dee Grapentine (a licensed amateur radio operator) built the first operational unit. School electrician Jim Hayes wired it into the King Hall dormitory power system and it worked like a charm. Subsequently more transmitters were built by Jim Corner and Ken Simpson, both amateur radio operators. Many other students and faculty pitched in to make WRMU a reality. The school had a broadcast studio built to professional standards and bore the cost of installing telephone lines to each of the dormitories so the broadcast signal could be fed there.|$|E

50|$|Among several anecdotes {{from the}} trip Europe, is one {{directly}} involving Ras Hailu Tekle Haymanot. At the time, {{he was the}} governor of an important province {{and one of the}} wealthiest men in the Ethiopian Empire. As a rich man and as the son of a king, Hailu Tekle Haymanot carried himself as such. The Crown Prince, Ras Tafari Makonnen, and his entourage were being received by King George V and Queen Mary at Buckingham Palace. Ras Hailu Tekle Haymanot, along with the other princes and nobles, was introduced to the British king. In meeting Ras Hailu, King George asked if His Highness could speak English. The interpreter said no. The king then asked if he could speak French or German, again <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>no.</b> King George, rather irritated, told the interpreter to tell His Highness that he was an ignorant man. Ras Hailu Tekle Haymanot listened quietly. He then asked the interpreter if His Majesty could speak Amharic. When he was told no, Hailu Tekle Haymanot asked him if His Majesty could speak Tigrigna or Guragigna and again was told no. Hailu Tekle Haymanot then haughtily told the interpreter to tell the king that His Majesty was equally ignorant. King George burst out laughing and took a great liking to Ras Hailu Tekle Haymanot, Leul of Gojjam. Ethiopia was said to be opening up to the world.|$|E
5000|$|On Election Day 1990, when Whitney Houston was {{announced}} as the performer of [...] "The Star-Spangled Banner" [...] at Super Bowl XXV, Houston knew instantly how {{she wanted to}} interpret the tune there—with jazz chords and soulful gospel rhythms. So, her longtime musical director Rickey Minor suggested changing the song from standard, waltz tempo— time signature—to , with the extra beat per measure allowing Houston to open up her lungs and 'breathe'. Two weeks before the Super Bowl, Houston heard the arrangement, played by The Florida Orchestra and recorded at Tampa Bay Performing Arts Center earlier in January, for the first time. And about ten days later, she recorded a breathtaking game-day master at a California studio. Minor recalled that she truly embraced the song. But not everybody agreed. Some National Football League (NFL) officials feared the rendition was too flamboyant for wartime. Minor told USA Today that [...] "They thought the harmonies were too different, that it was sacrilegious." [...] Bob Best, the Super Bowl's pregame show producer since the early 1980s, added that [...] "Their hang-up was that it wasn't easy to sing to. I disagreed wholeheartedly." [...] Four days before the game, NFL officials ordered Best to phone Houston's father, John, and ask if she would record another version. <b>The</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>no.</b> Best said that [...] "I held that phone {{so far away from}} my ear." [...] Yet, when Houston stepped onto the field, Minor was filled with anxiety: [...] "I thought, 'What if everybody boos?'" [...] Two weeks later, the single was a big hit on the Billboard charts.|$|E
5000|$|The boycott was {{announced}} by ANB Grand Camp president Richard Stitt, made public July 14, 1997, in the Juneau Empire, {{little over a}} month before the scheduled derby date. Stitt said TSI had opposed them on the issues of subsistence and Native corporation creation in aggressive ways that pointed at racism. At the Southeast Native Subsistence Summit of July 18 and 19 it was unanimously voted to back the ANB's boycott. Territorial Sportsmen Inc. responded to the call for a boycott with a six-page letter to the ANB asking them to rethink the boycott and for a chance to meet to communicate; in the letter the TSI's stances were reaffirmed, but it was stressed that TSI had a [...] "racially blind policy" [...] for membership and scholarship recipients from derby proceeds. Ron Somerville, TSI's president, called the ANB's claim that TSI was racist [...] "absurd" [...] and claimed the boycott would hurt Natives who otherwise could have benefited from scholarship money provided through the competition. In a Juneau Chamber of Commerce luncheon on July 18 Somerville asked Stitt if his resignation would end the boycott, to which <b>the</b> <b>answer</b> <b>was</b> <b>no.</b> Several businesses informed both groups of their intent to drop sponsorship of the derby. On July 21 Mayor Dennis Egan, along with the Juneau assembly, offered for the city to pay for a professional mediator because of concerns that the disagreement would cause community conflict. A list of potential mediators was given to both groups. The offer of mediation was accepted August 8, with Catholic Bishop Michael Warfel acting as mediator. Also on August 8, a protest against the boycott was held by the United Native Shareholders, citing as reasons that they were upset at the ANB's control over where they were allowed to fish and that the ANB's time would be better spent writing to Congress about their inequities rather than targeting an organization that had its own political agenda; the protest only had an eight-person turn out, three of whom were kids. The mediated talks started on the 15th of August. The ANB said they would suspend the boycott if TSI pledged to spend all derby proceeds on scholarships (with none going to political lobbying) and if TSI pledged to talk about the issues of subsistence and Native corporation creation. TSI claimed that already the net income of the derby went into the scholarship funds, but refused to accept the ANB's requests unless the ANB apologized for calling them 'racist'. The ANB agreed to apologize for calling TSI racist, if TSI would apologize for an undisclosed statement made in correspondence. August 21, a day {{before the start of the}} derby, an accord was signed by both groups calling off the boycott under certain stipulations.|$|E
