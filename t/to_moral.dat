5|$|Bewick {{was also}} noted {{as having a}} strong moral sense and was an early campaigner for fair {{treatment}} of animals. He objected to the docking of horses' tails, the mistreatment of performing animals such as bears, and cruelty to dogs. Above all, he thought war utterly pointless. All these themes recur in his engravings, which echo Hogarth's attention <b>to</b> <b>moral</b> themes. For example, he shows wounded soldiers with wooden legs, back from the wars, and animals with a gallows in the background.|$|E
5|$|By the 11th century, the I Ching {{was being}} {{read as a}} work of {{intricate}} philosophy, as a jumping-off point for examining great metaphysical questions and ethical issues. Cheng Yi, patriarch of the Neo-Confucian Cheng–Zhu school, read the I Ching as a guide <b>to</b> <b>moral</b> perfection. He described the text as a way to for ministers to form honest political factions, root out corruption, and solve problems in government.|$|E
5|$|Other {{psychologists have}} {{questioned}} the assumption that moral action is primarily a result of formal reasoning. Social intuitionists such as Jonathan Haidt, for example, argue that individuals often make moral judgments without weighing concerns such as fairness, law, human rights, or abstract ethical values. Thus the arguments analyzed by Kohlberg and other rationalist psychologists could be considered post hoc rationalizations of intuitive decisions; moral reasoning may be less relevant <b>to</b> <b>moral</b> action than Kohlberg's theory suggests.|$|E

40|$|This essay {{looks at}} whether the law {{can help us}} <b>to</b> be <b>moral.</b> First, it assesses the law’s {{credentials}} to be an instrument or tool that can help us <b>to</b> be <b>moral</b> in a consequentialist, deontological, or virtue-ethical sense. As a tool, the law’s potential uses are 1) <b>to</b> be a <b>moral</b> advisor, 2) <b>to</b> set a <b>moral</b> example, and 3) <b>to</b> be a <b>moral</b> motivator. The law’s moral usefulness {{in each of these}} three ways is mixed. Second, the essay considers whether the law itself has intrinsic moral value.

5|$|As the {{industrialisation}} of {{the valleys}} began {{there was little}} shift {{in the use of}} Welsh as a first language. Initial immigrants were Welsh and {{it was not until the}} 1900s that English workers began settling in any great numbers, but it wasn't these new workers who changed the language; the erosion of Welsh had already begun in the 1860s in the school classrooms. The educational philosophy accepted by schoolmasters and governmental administrators was that English was the language of scholars, and that Welsh was a barrier <b>to</b> <b>moral</b> and commercial prosperity. In 1901 35.4% of Rhondda workers spoke only English but by 1911 this had risen to 43.1%, while Welsh speaking monoglots had dropped from 11.4% to 4.4% in the same period.|$|E
5|$|Because {{evolutionary}} naturalism proposes {{an empirical}} account of morality, {{it does not}} require morality to exist objectively; Linville considers the view that this will lead <b>to</b> <b>moral</b> scepticism or antirealism. C. S. Lewis argued that, if evolutionary naturalism is accepted, human morality cannot be described as absolute and objective because moral statements cannot be right or wrong. Despite this, Lewis argued, those who accept evolutionary naturalism still act as if objective moral truths exist, leading Lewis to reject naturalism as incoherent. As an alternative ethical theory, Lewis offered a form of divine command theory which equated God with goodness and treated goodness as an essential part of reality, thus asserting God's existence.|$|E

5|$|Michael Shermer {{argued in}} Scientific American in October 2006 that {{evolution}} supports concepts like family values, avoiding lies, fidelity, moral codes {{and the rule}} of law. He goes on to suggest that evolution gives more support to the notion of an omnipotent creator, rather than a tinkerer with limitations based on a human model, the more common image subscribed to by creationists. Careful analysis of the creationist charges that evolution has led <b>to</b> <b>moral</b> relativism and the Holocaust yields the conclusion that these charges appear to be highly suspect. Such analyses conclude that the origins of the Holocaust {{are more likely to be}} found in historical Christian anti-Semitism than in evolution.|$|E
5|$|Political Animals and Animal Politics is a 2014 edited {{collection}} {{published by}} Palgrave Macmillan and edited by the green political theorists Marcel Wissenburg and David Schlosberg.

As well as a substantial introduction by the editors, it features ten sole-authored chapters split over three parts, with contributions from Wissenburg, Schlosberg, Manuel Arias-Maldonado, Chad Flanders, Christie Smith, Clemens Driessen, Simon Otjes, Kurtis Boyer, Per-Anders Svärd and Mihnea Tanasescu.|$|E

5|$|Writing in the Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Michael Tooley {{rejected}} the Irenaean theodicy as unsatisfactory. He {{argued that the}} magnitude of suffering experienced by some people is excessive, supporting Eleanor Stump's view that the suffering endured by those with terminal illnesses cannot be for moral development, and that such illnesses do not fall more often upon those seemingly immoral or in need of development. He also challenged the suffering both of animals and of young children. Neither of these instances of suffering serve any useful purpose, as they cannot lead <b>to</b> <b>moral</b> development. Finally, he questioned whether the current universe is the best possible world for the moral development of humans. Citing the examples of those who die young and those who experience too great a pain to learn from it, {{as well as people}} who suffer too little to learn anything, he suggested that this world is not ideally suited to human development.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of process theology has challenged the Irenaean tradition by teaching that God's power is limited {{and that he}} cannot be responsible for evil. Twentieth century philosopher Alvin Plantinga supported {{the idea that this}} world is the best possible world, arguing that the good in the world (including God's infinite goodness) outweighs the evil and proposing that the ultimate good of God's sacrifice when Jesus was crucified necessitated the existence of evil. His free will defence was not a theodicy because he was trying to show the logical compatibility of evil and the existence of God, rather than the probability of God. D. Z. Phillips and Fyodor Dostoyevsky challenged the instrumental use of suffering, suggesting that love cannot be expressed through suffering. However, Dostoyevsky also states that the beauty of love is evident, in that love can continue to grow, withstand and overcome even the most evil acts. Michael Tooley argued that the magnitude of suffering is excessive and that, in some cases, cannot lead <b>to</b> <b>moral</b> development. French theologian Henri Blocher criticised Hick's universalism, arguing that such a view negates free will, which was similarly important to the theodicy.|$|E

40|$|ExtractIn {{developing}} moral theories, philosophers seek {{to fulfill}} {{at least two}} tasks: <b>to</b> guide <b>moral</b> judgment and <b>to</b> guide <b>moral</b> deliberation. In moral judgment, moral agents assess moral status. In moral deliberation, moral agents decide how to act. It is important to work out how these two things are related. One suggestion is to posit a direct connection between them according <b>to</b> which <b>moral</b> agents are required to deliberate in terms of correct moral judgment. There are various ways of spelling out this requirement. For example, moral agents might be required to rank prospective actions according <b>to</b> a correct <b>moral</b> judgment of them and choose the highest ranked action. Moral agents would thus be required to choose the morally best action available <b>to</b> them. Alternatively, <b>moral</b> agents might be required to separate prospective actions into those that are permissible actions {{and those that are}} impermissible and choose, perhaps on non-moral grounds, from the class of morally permissible actions...|$|R
