The mid-nineties witnessed the increased popularity of defensive schemes like the neutral zone trap which slowed the game, limiting scoring and offensive chances. The emphasis on defensive has been blamed for diminishing fan interest. When Naslund was traded to Vancouver in 1996 the Canucks often played in a half empty arena and there were rumors about <b>the</b> <b>franchise</b> moving. The line's offense first style helped to popularize <b>the</b> <b>franchise.</b> They began to sell out home games on a regular basis and started to have a following on the road.
