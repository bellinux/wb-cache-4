Leading up to the First World War he argued that Britain should adopt a more sympathetic approach towards Germany, including naval disarmament. When war did break out, Brunner was resolute in the opinion {{that it should be}} fought and won. In addition to the production of alkali, his factories were making other chemicals for use as explosives. He also built a new factory to purify <b>trinitrotoluene.</b>|$|E
5|$|Historically, two {{paths of}} the native {{indigenous}} peoples ran along parts of White Deer Hole Creek. Settlers arrived by 1770, but fled in 1778 during the American Revolutionary War. They returned and the creek served as the southern boundary of Lycoming County when it was formed on April 13, 1795. A logging railroad ran along the creek from 1901 to 1904 for timber clearcutting, and small-scale lumbering continues. During World War II a <b>Trinitrotoluene</b> (TNT) plant, which became a federal prison in 1952, {{was built in the}} watershed. Most development is in the eastern end of the valley, with two unincorporated villages, a hamlet, and most of the farms (many Amish).|$|E
25|$|Being a {{powerful}} oxidizing acid, nitric acid reacts violently with many organic {{materials and the}} reactions may be explosive. The hydroxyl group will typically strip a hydrogen from the organic molecule to form water, and the remaining nitro group takes the hydrogen's place. Nitration of organic compounds with nitric acid is the primary method of synthesis of many common explosives, such as nitroglycerin and <b>trinitrotoluene</b> (TNT). As very many less stable byproducts are possible, these reactions must be carefully thermally controlled, and the byproducts removed to isolate the desired product.|$|E
25|$|TNT {{is prone}} to {{exudation}} of dinitrotoluenes and other isomers of <b>trinitrotoluene.</b> Even small quantities of such impurities can cause such effect. The effect shows especially in projectiles containing TNT and stored at higher temperatures, e.g. during summer. Exudation of impurities leads to formation of pores and cracks (which in turn cause increased shock sensitivity). Migration of the exudated liquid into the fuze screw thread can form fire channels, increasing the risk of accidental detonations; fuze malfunction can result from the liquids migrating into its mechanism. Calcium silicate is mixed with TNT to mitigate the tendency towards exudation.|$|E
25|$|German armour-piercing shells {{were far}} more {{effective}} than the British ones, which often failed to penetrate heavy armour. The issue particularly concerned shells striking at oblique angles, which became increasingly the case at long range. Germany had adopted <b>trinitrotoluene</b> (TNT) as the explosive filler for artillery shells in 1902, while the United Kingdom was still using a picric acid mixture (Lyddite). The shock of impact of a shell against armour often prematurely detonated Lyddite in advance of fuze function while TNT detonation could be delayed until after the shell had penetrated and the fuze had functioned in the vulnerable area behind the armour plate.|$|E
25|$|ROF Sellafield was {{constructed}} by John Laing & Son in 1942 at Low Sellafield as a Second World War Royal Ordnance Factory. The nearby sister factory, ROF Drigg which produced TNT (<b>trinitrotoluene)</b> had been constructed in 1940, 5km to the south-east and {{adjacent to the}} village of Drigg. ROF Drigg and ROF Sellafield were built in these isolated and remote coastal sites because of the hazardous nature of the process and to minimise the risk of enemy air attack. They were both classed as Explosive ROF specialising in high-explosive TNT (ROF Drigg) and propellant (ROF Sellafield), and production ceased at both factories immediately following the defeat of Japan.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1940s, the major US explosive manufacturers, E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company and Hercules, had several decades of experience of manufacturing <b>trinitrotoluene</b> (TNT) and had no wish to experiment with new explosives. US Army Ordnance held the same viewpoint and wanted to continue using TNT. RDX had been tested by Picatinny Arsenal in 1929 and it was regarded as too expensive and too sensitive. The Navy proposed to continue using ammonium picrate. In contrast, the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC), who had visited The Royal Arsenal, Woolwich, did not share the view that new explosives were unnecessary. James B. Conant, chairman of Division B, wished to involve academic research into this area. Conant therefore set up an Experimental Explosives Research Laboratory at the Bureau of Mines, Bruceton, Pennsylvania, using Office of Scientific Research and Development (OSRD) funding.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{explosion}} {{occurred on}} the Red Arrowâ€“ 75 years train at the Lubyanka station at approximately 7:56am local time (03:56UTC). The train started from Yugo-Zapadnaya, and stopped at Lubyanka station. Once the train doors opened, explosives worn by a woman standing at the second carriage's second exit detonated. The explosive had a force of up to 1.5kg of <b>trinitrotoluene</b> (TNT). Fifteen people on board the train, and eleven people on the platform, were killed.

2500|$|In the laboratory, 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene is {{produced}} by a two-step process. [...] A nitrating mixture of concentrated nitric and sulfuric acids is used to nitrate toluene to a mixture of mono- and di-nitrotoluene isomers, with careful cooling to maintain temperature. [...] The nitrated toluenes are then separated, washed with dilute sodium bicarbonate to remove oxides of nitrogen, and then carefully nitrated {{with a mixture of}} fuming nitric acid and sulfuric acid. [...] Towards the end of the nitration, the mixture is heated on a steam bath. [...] The <b>trinitrotoluene</b> is separated, washed with a dilute solution of sodium sulfite and then recrystallized from alcohol.|$|E
2500|$|The Silvertown {{explosion}} {{occurred in}} Silvertown in West Ham, Essex (now {{part of the}} London Borough of Newham, in Greater London) on Friday, 19 January 1917 at 6.52pm. The blast occurred at a munitions factory that was manufacturing explosives for Britain's World War I military effort. Approximately [...] of <b>trinitrotoluene</b> (TNT) exploded, killing 73people and injuring 400 more, as well as causing substantial damage in the local area. This was not the first, last, largest, or the most deadly explosion at a munitions facility in Britain during the war: an explosion at Faversham involving [...] of TNT killed 105 in 1916, and the National Shell Filling Factory, Chilwell exploded in 1918, killing 137.|$|E
2500|$|In industry, TNT is {{produced}} in a three-step process. First, toluene is nitrated {{with a mixture of}} sulfuric and nitric acid to produce mononitrotoluene (MNT). The MNT is separated and then renitrated to dinitrotoluene (DNT). In the final step, the DNT is nitrated to <b>trinitrotoluene</b> (TNT) using an anhydrous mixture of nitric acid and oleum. Nitric acid is consumed by the manufacturing process, but the diluted sulfuric acid can be reconcentrated and reused. [...] After nitration, TNT is stabilized by a process called sulfitation, where the crude TNT is treated with aqueous sodium sulfite solution to remove less stable isomers of TNT and other undesired reaction products. [...] The rinse water from sulphitation is known as red water and is a significant pollutant and waste product of TNT manufacture.|$|E

The world will one day do justice to the Inca as the man who kept the peace with nothing but his tongue and his moustache.

6000|$|It was {{not often}} that Ann found {{occasion}} to rejoice at the presence in her uncle's {{house of the}} six geniuses whom Mrs. Pett had installed therein. As a rule, she disliked them individually and collectively. But to-day their company was extraordinarily welcome to her. They might have their faults, but at least their presence tended to keep the conversation general and prevent it becoming a duologue between Lord Wisbeach and Jimmy {{on the subject of}} old times. She was still feeling weak from the reaction consequent upon the slackening of the tension of her emotions on seeing Lord Wisbeach greet Jimmy as an old acquaintance. She had never hoped that that barrier would be surmounted. She had pictured Lord Wisbeach drawing back with a puzzled frown on his face and an astonished [...] "But this is not Jimmy Crocker." [...] The strain had left her relieved, but in no mood for conversation, and she replied absently to the remarks of Howard Bemis, the poet, who sat on her left. She looked round the table. Willie Partridge was talking to Mrs. Pett about the difference between picric acid and <b>trinitrotoluene,</b> than which a pleasanter topic for the luncheon table could hardly be selected, and the voice of Clarence Renshaw rose above all other competing noises, as he spoke of the functions of the trochaic spondee. There was nothing outwardly to distinguish this meal from any other which she had shared of late in that house.|$|E
6000|$|And {{though there}} may be better things to reveal, it may not, and indeed cannot, be militarily {{expedient}} to reveal them whilst the issue {{is still in the}} balance. Truth telling is not compatible with the defence of the realm. We are just now reading the revelations of our generals and admirals, unmuzzled at last by the armistice. During the war, General A, in his moving despatches from the field, told how General B had covered himself with deathless glory in such and such a battle. He now tells us that General B came within an ace of losing us the war by disobeying his orders on that occasion, and fighting instead of running away as he ought to have done. An excellent subject for comedy now that the war is over, no doubt; but if General A had let this out at the time, what would have been the effect on General B's soldiers? And had the stage made known what the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for War who overruled General A thought of him, and what he thought of them, as now revealed in raging controversy, what would have been the effect on the nation? That is why comedy, though sorely tempted, had to be loyally silent; for the art of the dramatic poet knows no patriotism; recognizes no obligation but truth to natural history; cares not whether Germany or England perish; is ready to cry with Brynhild, [...] "Lass'uns verderben, lachend zu grunde geh'n" [...] sooner than deceive or be deceived; and thus becomes in time of war a greater military danger than poison, steel, or <b>trinitrotoluene.</b> That is why I had to withhold Heartbreak House from the footlights during the war; for the Germans might on any night have turned the last act from play into earnest, and even then might not have waited for their cues.|$|E
