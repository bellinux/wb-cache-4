5|$|In the League Cup, {{the clubs}} {{met in the}} quarter-final stage at Old Trafford in December and even though both sides fielded {{weakened}} teams, the match was not short of drama. David Bellion gave Manchester United the lead in just 19 seconds {{but it was not}} until the start of the second half that tempers began <b>to</b> <b>flare.</b> A fracas between Robin van Persie and Kieran Richardson, following a late tackle on Richardson by Van Persie, resulted in clashes from both sets of players, which concluded with both protagonists getting booked by match official Mark Halsey.

5|$|Controversy {{continued}} <b>to</b> <b>flare</b> in Britain {{and other}} countries regarding sporting links with South Africa. The South Africa rugby team's 1969–70 tour of Britain and Ireland was accompanied by mass demonstrations against apartheid, including an attempt by a protester in London to hijack the South African team bus, and a demonstration in Dublin where people {{tried to stop the}} South Africans from reaching the match venue by lying {{down in the middle of}} the street. The South Africa cricket team was due to tour England shortly afterwards, and the MCC remained keen for the series to go ahead. They cancelled the tour a week before the South Africans were due to arrive, following public protests and pressure from the UK government. Virulent anti-apartheid demonstrations in Australia during the South Africa rugby team's 1971 tour led to soaring police costs, matches played behind fences and barbed wire, and a state of emergency in Queensland, all of which prompted the Australian Cricket Board to cancel the tour by the South Africa cricket team that had been scheduled to follow.|$|E
5|$|Okehampton Castle {{was built}} between 1068 and 1086 {{following}} the Norman conquest of England by Baldwin FitzGilbert. William the Conqueror defeated the Anglo-Saxon forces {{at the battle}} of Hastings in 1066, but violence continued <b>to</b> <b>flare</b> up periodically for several years after the invasion. Baldwin FitzGilbert, a Norman lord, was responsible for putting down a rebellion in Devon in 1068. He was probably given extensive lands in the county at this time, and by the time of Domesday Book in 1086 he was noted as the owner of the Honour of Okehampton and well as the Sheriff of Devon and Constable of Exeter Castle. The Honour of Okehampton was a grouping of around 200 estates across Devon, guarded by several castles, including Baldwin's main castle - or caput - at Okehampton, and those owned by his tenants, including Neroche and Montacute.|$|E

5|$|The arcs {{are quite}} stable structures. They were {{detected}} by ground-based stellar occultations in the 1980s, by Voyager 2 in 1989 and by Hubble Space Telescope and ground-based telescopes in 1997–2005 and remained at {{approximately the same}} orbital longitudes. However some changes have been noticed. The overall brightness of arcs decreased since 1986. The Courage arc jumped forward by 8° to 294° (it probably jumped over to the next stable co-rotation resonance position) while the Liberté arc had almost disappeared by 2003. The Fraternité and Égalité (1 and 2) arcs have demonstrated irregular variations in their relative brightness. Their observed dynamics is probably related to the exchange of dust between them. Courage, a very faint arc found during the Voyager flyby, was seen <b>to</b> <b>flare</b> in brightness in 1998; {{it was back to}} its usual dimness by June 2005. Visible light observations show that the total amount of material in the arcs has remained approximately constant, but they are dimmer in the infrared light wavelengths where previous observations were taken.|$|E
5|$|The Board {{determined}} that the probable cause of this accident was the inadequate consideration given to human factors limitations in the inspection and quality control procedures used by United Airlines' engine overhaul facility. These resulted in the failure to detect a fatigue crack originating from a previously undetected metallurgical defect located in a critical area of the titanium-alloy stage 1 fan disk that was manufactured by General Electric Aircraft Engines. The uncontained {{manner in which the}} engine failed resulted in high-speed metal fragments being hurled from the engine; these fragments penetrated the hydraulic lines of all three independent hydraulic systems on board the aircraft, which rapidly lost their hydraulic fluid. The subsequent catastrophic disintegration of the disk resulted in the liberation of debris in a pattern of distribution and with energy levels that exceeded the level of protection provided by design features of the hydraulic systems that operate the DC-10's flight controls; the flight crew lost its ability to operate nearly all of them. Despite these losses, the crew was able to attain and then maintain limited control by using the throttles to adjust thrust to the remaining wing-mounted engines. By using each engine independently, the crew made rough steering adjustments, and by using the engines together they were able to roughly adjust altitude. The crew guided the crippled jet to Sioux Gateway Airport and lined it up for landing on one of the runways. Without the use of flaps and slats, they were unable to slow down for landing, and were forced to attempt landing at a very high ground speed. The aircraft also landed at an extremely high rate of descent due to the inability <b>to</b> <b>flare</b> (reduce the rate of descent before touchdown by increasing pitch). As a result, upon touchdown the aircraft broke apart, rolled over and caught fire. The largest section came to rest in a cornfield next to the runway. Despite the ferocity of the accident, 185 (62.5%) passengers and crew survived owing to a variety of factors including the relatively controlled manner of the crash and the early notification of emergency services.|$|E

40|$|The gas flare {{process is}} the most common process used to dispose of waste gas {{generated}} in oil and gas operations.

Reactions involving oxidation products, light hydrocarbons, complex sulphur species, aromatic hydrocarbons, and poly-aromatic hydrocarbons were studied. In addition, the effects of varying inlet oxygen, flow rate, and temperature on species formation in the combustion chamber and incinerator stack were also determined.

25|$|Despite {{moving back}} over water on 5February and {{environmental}} conditions favoring redevelopment, convection failed to form around the low and instead, continued <b>to</b> <b>flare</b> along the convergence zone to the north. The remnant system then became nearly stationary just offshore {{for two days}} before adopting a slow north-northeasterly track. Early on 8February, Fletcher brushed the Queensland coast {{just north of the}} mouth of the Gilbert River before accelerating southwestward. After completing two loops in its track, the system subsequently made its final landfall to the east of Burketown, Queensland on 9February. As the storm passed close to the town, a pressure of 997hPa (29.44inHg) was observed along with wind gusts of up to 65km/h (40mph). Maintaining a general westward track, the remnants of Fletcher gradually weakened and were last noted on 12February over the Alice Springs District in the Northern Territory.|$|E

25|$|Although a kabya himself, Ne Win banned Chinese-language {{education}} and created other measures {{to compel the}} Chinese to leave. Ne Win's government stoked up racial animosity and ethnic conflicts against the Chinese, who were terrorized by Burmese citizens, the most violent riots taking place {{at the time of}} the Cultural Revolution in China in 1967.

Beginning in 1967 and continuing throughout the 1970s, anti-Chinese riots continued <b>to</b> <b>flare</b> up and many believed they were covertly supported by the government. Similarly, Chinese shops were looted and set on fire. Public attention was successfully diverted by Ne Win from the uncontrollable inflation, scarcity of consumer items and rising prices of rice. The 1982 Citizenship Law further restricted Burmese citizenship for Burmese Chinese (as it stratified citizenship into three categories: full, associate, and naturalized) and severely limited Burmese Chinese, especially those without full citizenship and those holding FRCs, from attending professional tertiary schools, including medical, engineering, agricultural and economics institutions. During this period, the country's failing economy and widespread discrimination accelerated an emigration of Burmese Chinese out of Burma.|$|E
25|$|The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, {{signed on}} February 2, 1848, by American diplomat Nicholas Trist and Mexican {{plenipotentiary}} representatives Luis G.

As news of peace negotiations reached the state, new call to arms began <b>to</b> <b>flare</b> among {{the people of the}} state. But as the Mexican officials in Chihuahua heard that General Price was heading back to Mexico with a large force comprising several companies of infantry and three companies of cavalry and one division of light artillery from Santa Fe on February 8, 1848, Ángel Trías sent a message to Sacramento Pass to ask for succession of the area as they understood the war had concluded. General Price, misunderstanding this as a deception by the Mexican forces, continued to advance towards the state capital. On March 16, 1848 Price began negotiations with Ángel Trías, but the Mexican leader responded with an ultimatum to General Price. The American forces engaged with the Mexican forces near Santa Cruz de los Rosales on March 16, 1848. The Battle of Santa Cruz de los Rosales was the last battle of the Mexican–American War and it occurred after the peace treaty was signed. The American forces maintained control over the state capital for three months after the confirmation of the peace treaty. The American presence served to delay the possible succession of the state which had been discussed at the end of 1847, and the state remained under United States occupation until May 22, 1848.|$|E

40|$|The {{solar corona}} is a {{template}} {{to study and}} understand stellar activity. However the solar corona {{differs from that of}} active stars: the Sun has lower X-ray luminosity, and on average cooler plasma temperatures. Active stellar coronae have a hot peak in their emission measure distribution, EM(T), at 8 - 20 MK, while the non-flaring solar corona has a peak at 1 - 2 MK. In the solar corona significant amounts of plasma at temperature 10 MK are observed only during <b>flares.</b> <b>To</b> investigate what is the time-averaged effect of solar flares we measure the disk-integrated time-averaged emission measure, EMF(T), of an unbiased sample of solar <b>flares.</b> <b>To</b> this aim we analyze uninterrupted GOES/XRS light curves over time intervals of one month. We also obtain the EMQ(T) of the quiescent corona for the same time intervals from Yohkoh/SXT data. To investigate variations due to the solar cycle we evaluate EMF(T) and EMQ(T) at different phases of the cycle between December 1991 and April 1998. Irrespective of the solar cycle phase, EMF(T) appears as a peak in the distribution, and it is significantly larger than the values of EMQ(T) for T 5 - 10 MK. Adding EMF(T) and EMQ(T) we obtain {{for the first time a}} time average EM(T) of the entire solar corona: it is double-peaked, with the hot peak, due <b>to</b> time-averaged <b>flares,</b> being located at temperatures similar to those of active stars, but less enhanced. In the assumption that the heating of the corona is entirely due <b>to</b> <b>flares,</b> from nano- <b>to</b> macro-flares, a two peak EM(T) distribution suggests that then either the flare distribution or the confined plasma response <b>to</b> <b>flares,</b> or both, are bimodal. Moreover the EMF(T) shape supports the hypothesis that the hot EM(T) peak of active coronae is due <b>to</b> unresolved solar-like <b>flares.</b> If this is the case, quiescent and flare components should follow different scaling laws for increasing stellar activity...|$|R
