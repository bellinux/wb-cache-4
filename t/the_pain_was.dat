5|$|At the palace, Charming {{struggles with}} his {{feelings}} for Snow. The King (Alan Dale) commands him to forget her because the marriage to Abigail is worth great wealth to the kingdom. Charming sends a letter by carrier pigeon to Snow begging {{her to come}} and see him so they can be together. The letter reaches her just before she can take the potion. Snow makes it to the palace but she is seized by the guards and thrown into the dungeon. There she meets a dwarf named Grumpy (Lee Arenberg), who was falsely imprisoned for stealing a diamond that he wanted to give to his girlfriend. Another dwarf, Stealthy (Geoff Gustafson), shows up to rescue Grumpy, who asks Stealthy to free Snow as well. The guards kill Stealthy as they try to escape and try to recapture Grumpy. Snow threatens to burn down the palace unless they let Grumpy go and take her in his place. The King tells Snow he will not let her interfere with the wedding. She must tell Charming she does not love him, or the King will kill him. Snow obeys because she loves Charming too much to let him die, but both are left heartbroken. Snow leaves and is soon joined by Grumpy and six other dwarfs, who offer her a place to stay. She considers the potion but Grumpy warns her that those feelings however painful, are part of her. Charming calls off the wedding to look for Snow and the dwarves hear about it from Red Riding Hood. Grumpy joyfully tells Snow the good news, but she has forgotten about Charming. <b>The</b> <b>pain</b> <b>was</b> too great to bear and she drank the potion.|$|E
5|$|Months went {{by without}} any {{scheduled}} concerts {{due to the}} album's poor sales. Following another relapse and a stint in rehab, Kiedis {{and the rest of}} the band prepared for a summer tour, their first in almost seven months. Before the tour could begin, Kiedis had an accident on his motorcycle and was rushed to the hospital after severely injuring his hand. Due to his drug addiction, it took seven doses of morphine before <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>was</b> assuaged. Following discharge from the hospital, he was forced to wear a full-arm cast for several months, resulting in the cancellation of all remaining scheduled concerts. Halfway through Kiedis's recovery, the band was asked to play the Fuji Rock Festival in July 1997. By that time, Kiedis's cast had receded down to the elbow and he felt well enough to play. A large typhoon had been forecast to hit the festival several hours before the show. The concert took place anyway, and when the Chili Peppers got on stage to play, the audience was being soaked in torrential rains, and the band found it virtually impossible to play their instruments. After eight songs, the lighting and sound equipment was torn from the stage and the band was obliged to an impromptu finish.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{severity}} of the pain in erythromelalgia, and the lack of good pain medication then, there have been reports dating back to 1903 of amputation of the affected limb. In 1903 H.

25|$|Then {{last night}} {{something}} happened which I can neither explain nor understand.

25|$|A {{number of}} {{high-profile}} baby rapes appeared since 2001 (including {{the fact that}} they required extensive reconstructive surgery to rebuild urinary, genital, abdominal, or tracheal systems). In 2001, a 9-month-old was raped and likely lost consciousness as <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>was</b> too much to bear. In February 2002, an 8-month-old infant was reportedly gang raped by four men.

25|$|In the 2006–07 season, the {{nightmare}} grew even bigger. The supporters saw their two star players leave to Chelsea (Salomon Kalou) and Liverpool (Dirk Kuyt). At the same time, {{it became clear}} Feyenoord were in an appalling financial state despite earlier comments made by chairman Jorien van den Herik, who claimed that the club was financially healthy. Supporters' unrest grew into anger when Feyenoord bought Angelos Charisteas, a back-up striker of arch-rivals Ajax, with a poor track record, {{as a replacement for}} Dirk Kuyt. After continuous protests, Van den Herik resigned and the club began managerial reforms. However, the worst was not over. Feyenoord were banned from European competition following hooliganism prior to and during a match against Nancy, despite an appeal by the club. The season ended in bitter disappointment with a seventh-place finish, causing Feyenoord to miss European football {{for the first time in}} 16years. While desperate supporters started preparing for a dark age, the club surprised friend and foe in the 2007 summer transfer window. A brilliant performance of young Dutch left back Royston Drenthe at the 2007 UEFA European Under-21 Championship had investors flocking to the new investment schemes Feyenoord had established. The club appointed former manager Bert van Marwijk and was able to make a number of high-profile signings, including Giovanni van Bronckhorst and Roy Makaay. Despite the efforts, Feyenoord underperformed once again in the Eredivisie, finishing in a disappointing sixth place. <b>The</b> <b>pain</b> <b>was</b> relieved by claiming the first prize in six years: 100years after the foundation of the club, Feyenoord managed to win the KNVB Cup after defeating Roda JC 2–0. As Van Marwijk accepted a job as manager of the national team, Feyenoord appointed Gertjan Verbeek as their manager for the 2008–09 season.|$|E

He chose to work on the project as he wanted make his next film in the United States, and signed on as its director in February 1979. Parker met with De Silva in Manhattan, New York, where it was decided that he would draft his own script with Gore receiving sole screenwriting credit and Parker's colleague Alan Marshall being enlisted as a producer. Gore travelled to London, England, where he and Parker began work on a second draft script. Their new script became significantly darker than what De Silva had originally intended. De Silva said, [...] "I was really motivated and interested in the joy of what the school represented for these kids, and [...] was really much more interested in where <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>was</b> in going to the school, and so we had our little conflicts based on that area." ...|$|E
500|$|The song is {{introduced}} with a narrative by Minaj, speaking in an English accent, {{that serves as}} a retelling of writer Roald Dahl's poetic rework of [...] "Cinderella". West begins his verse with the refrain [...] "I fantasized ’bout this back in Chicago". It introduces themes referenced on the majority of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, including comments on decadence and hedonism, with West musing how [...] "the plan was to drink until <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>was</b> over / but what’s worse, the pain or the hangover?". His lyrics on the track contain numerous musical and cultural references, including those to the song [...] "Mercy Mercy Me (The Ecology)", the Lamborghini Murciélago sports car, rapper Nas, fashion designer Phoebe Philo, short story [...] "The Legend of Sleepy Hollow", the band the Kings Of Leon and their song [...] "Sex on Fire", singers Celine Dion and Leona Lewis, and television character Steve Urkel. The song contains the line [...] "too many Urkels on your team / that's why your wins low", a double entendre. The [...] "Winslows" [...] were the family Urkel lived with on the show Family Matters, with the alternative meaning touching upon how his opponents' [...] "wins are low". The chorus contains the line [...] "can we get much higher?", another inquiry that is brought up during much of the proceeding album.

500|$|In October 2001, Bowie {{opened the}} Concert for New York City, a charity event {{to benefit the}} victims of the September 11 attacks, with a minimalist {{performance}} of Simon & Garfunkel's [...] "America", followed by a full band performance of [...] "Heroes". 2002 saw the release of Heathen, and, {{during the second half of}} the year, the Heathen Tour. Taking place in Europe and North America, the tour opened at London's annual Meltdown festival, for which Bowie was that year appointed artistic director. Among the acts he selected for the festival were Philip Glass, Television and the Dandy Warhols. As well as songs from the new album, the tour featured material from Bowie's Low era. Reality (2003) followed, and its accompanying world tour, the A Reality Tour, with an estimated attendance of 722,000, grossed more than any other in 2004. Onstage in Oslo, Norway, on 18 June, Bowie was hit in the eye with a lollipop thrown by a fan; a week later he suffered chest pain while performing at the Hurricane Festival in Scheeßel, Germany. Originally thought to be a pinched nerve in his shoulder, <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>was</b> later diagnosed as an acutely blocked coronary artery, requiring an emergency angioplasty in Hamburg. The remaining 14 dates of the tour were cancelled. That same year, his interest in Buddhism led him to support the Tibetan cause by performing at a concert to support the New York Tibet House.|$|E

500|$|The album's opening track, [...] "Dark Fantasy", is {{introduced}} with a narrative by Nicki Minaj, attempting an English accent, {{that serves as}} a retelling of writer Roald Dahl's poetic rework of [...] "Cinderella". It introduces My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy themes of decadence and hedonism, with West musing how [...] "the plan was to drink until <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>was</b> over / But what’s worse, the pain or the hangover?".

[...] "All of the Lights" [...] incorporates drum 'n' bass breaks and brass fanfare. West's lyrics contain a reference to the death of Michael Jackson in the opening lines and present a narrative of a character who abuses his lover, does prison time, scuffles with her new boyfriend, and subsequently mourns his absence from his child's life. For the song, West enlisted 11 guest vocalists, including Alicia Keys, John Legend, Elton John, Tony Williams, Elly Jackson, and Rihanna, who sings the song's hook. In an interview for MTV, Jackson said of the song's vocal layering, [...] "He got me to layer up all these vocals with other people, and he just basically wanted to use his favorite vocalists {{from around the world to}} create this really unique vocal texture on his record, but it's not the kind of thing where you can pick it out".|$|E

Klauber (1997) includes an account {{of a man who had}} been bitten on the first joint of the index finger of the right hand, with only a single fang penetrating.

Caldough transported him to the residence of a doctor, Grant Gould, who noted that Flynn had considerable difficulty negotiating the building's stairway. Gould, assuming that <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>was</b> due to degenerative disc disease and spinal osteoarthritis, administered 50 milligrams of demerol intravenously.

Crayfish which experienced an electric shock displayed enhanced fearfulness or anxiety as demonstrated by their preference for the dark arms more than the light. Furthermore, shocked crayfish had relatively higher brain serotonin concentrations coupled with elevated blood glucose, which suggests a stress response. [...] A follow-up study using the same species showed {{the intensity of the}} anxiety-like behaviour, presumably resulting from <b>the</b> <b>pain,</b> <b>was</b> dependent on the intensity of the electric shock until reaching a plateau.
