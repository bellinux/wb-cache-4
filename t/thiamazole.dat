40|$|Abstract Background <b>Thiamazole</b> is {{a widely}} used antithyroid agent that has been {{approved}} {{for the treatment of}} hyperthyroidism. Although thiamazole-induced hepatotoxicity is a main side effect, it may progress to liver failure in a very few cases. Case Presentation We described a 24 -year-old patient with hyperthyroidism and trilogy of Fallot, who developed liver failure due to <b>thiamazole.</b> Liver biopsy showed intrahepatic cholestasis, mild inflammatory infiltrates, as well as significant fibrosis, indicating both acute and chronic liver injuries. Although a series of potent therapies were given, the patient deceased due to severe liver decompensation. Conclusions This case suggests that thiamazole-induced hepatotoxicity in the setting of advanced fibrosis increases the risk of poor outcome. Regular liver function monitoring during <b>thiamazole</b> therapy is therefore important. </p...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Sclerostin, {{a product}} of a SOST gene, is a protein {{expressed}} by osteocytes that inhibits osteoblastic bone formation. Several hormones, including PTH and glucocorticosteroids, have been suggested to be possible regulators of sclerostin production. The influence of thyroid hormones on sclerostin synthesis has not been investigated, so far. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate sclerostin concentrations in patients before and after treatment of thyrotoxicosis. Patients and methods The study involved 15 patients (4 men), mean age 51. 8 ± 15. 3 years, mean BMI value - 24. 7 ± 3. 5, with thyrotoxicosis due to Graves’ disease or toxic multinodular goitre. Serum sclerostin was measured by immunoassay at diagnosis of thyrotoxicosis and after 6 – 10 weeks of treatment with <b>thiamazole.</b> The data were analysed by means of simple descriptive statistics of location and dispersion and Mann–Whitney U test for pairs of results, before and after <b>thiamazole</b> therapy. Association between variables was evaluated with use of Spearman`s correlation coefficient. Results There was a significant decrease in free T 3 (FT 3) and free T 4 (FT 4) concentrations (from 8. 74 ± 4. 79 pg/ml to 3. 54 ± 2. 40 pg/ml, and from 4. 48 ± 2. 21 ng/ml to 1. 02 ± 1. 07 ng/ml, respectively, p 3 or FT 4 concentrations. Conclusions Restoration of a euthyroid state in patients with thyrotoxicosis results in a significant decrease in serum sclerostin concentrations. The above mentioned phenomenon may reflect lowering of bone metabolism, but a possible direct influence of thyroid hormones on SOST gene needs to be investigated. </p...|$|E

Her body weight was normal (BMI 20. 5 kg/m 2) {{and there was}} no significant family history of cardiac disease. She smoked, however, about 15 cigarettes a day and she had been taking combined oral contraceptive pill (Cilest ®) for about three years. On admission she appeared sweaty and in pain, blood pressure 130 / 70 mmHg, heart rate about 110 /min, mild lid-lag sign. Heart sounds were normal and chest was clear. ECG revealed 2 - 3 mm ST segment elevations in II, III, aVF as well as V 2 to V 5. Troponin I was raised and she was qualified to an emergency coronary angiography. This revealed a massive spasm of left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery that responded to intracoronary glyceryl trinitrite administration, however, with the presence of critical narrowing of the LAD apical segment with possible superimposed thrombus. Cardiac ultrasound revealed akinesis of 1 / 2 of apical area consistent with myocardial infarction Treatment and progress She was started on Aspirin, Simvastatin, and Diltiazem, but continued to have persistent tachycardia and tremor. Thyroid function tests were ordered and showed thyrotoxicosis [free T 4 - 46. 9 pmol/l (ref. range 9 - 25), free T 3 - 11. 9 pmol/l (2 - 5), TSH - 0. 02 mIU/l (0. 27 - 4. 2) ].

However, their identification and adequate management of the use of drug combinations hampers a number of obstacles. The aim of this thesis was to summary information about the drug {{interactions of}} drugs used in thyroid diseases (levothyroxine, propylthiouracil, <b>thiamazole)</b> and to formulate articles describing the management of interactions in a clinical practice including information for the dispensation of these drugs. To compare the information presented in each database and to determine the degree of conformity between these sources. Methodology: Based on the use of numerous information sources (Micromedex, UpToDate, SPC, Stockley's Drug Interactions) lists of drug interactions of drugs used in thyroid disaeses were established. Information about these interactions were completed by findings from other sources (PubMed®, scientific reports, Google Scholar). The information presented in each of these [...] ...|$|E

We investigated retrospectively the frequency of adverse events after initial ATD administration to previously untreated Graves’ disease (GD) patients during pregnancy. We reviewed the charts of cases of 91 untreated pregnant women who came to our hospital {{for the first time and}} were newly diagnosed with GD during the period between January 1, 1999, and December 31, 2011. <b>Thiamazole</b> (MMI) was used to treat 40 patients and 51 patients were treated with propylthiouracil (PTU). Adverse events occurred in 5 patients (5 / 40; 12. 5 %) treated with MMI, and they consisted of cutaneous reactions in 5 patients. Adverse events occurred in five patients (5 / 51; 9. 8 %) treated with PTU, and they consisted of hepatotoxicity in two patients and cutaneous reactions in three patients. No patients experienced agranulocytosis or ANCA-related vasculitis. Comparison with the expected rate of adverse events in nonpregnant individuals showed that the frequency of adverse events in pregnant individuals was low...|$|E

It is not known whether dipeptidyl peptidase IV and aminopeptidase N activities, which are overexpressed in human thyroid cancer, are, as in human, also absent in normal thyrocytes of other species, making them suitable models for studies on the regulation of these proteases. Methods To assess the role of these proteases, activity was measured in thyroid tissue of human, mouse, rat, porcine, bovine and ovine origin. The lysosomal protease, dipeptidyl peptidase II, was used for comparison. Results Murine, rat, ovine, bovine and human thyrocytes all lacked dipeptidyl peptidase IV and aminopeptidase N activity, but porcine thyrocytes were found to possess both. In contrast, lysosomal dipeptidyl peptidase II was strongly expressed in all species. These activity patterns were maintained in cultured cells. Cultured porcine thyrocytes formed follicles with typical morphology upon stimulation with TSH but differed from human thyrocytes in their response to <b>thiamazole.</b> Conclusions These species differences in the expression of dipeptidyl peptidase IV and aminopeptidase N, indicate that porcine thyrocytes cannot be considered appropriate {{for the study of}} proteases in human cancer development. </p...|$|E
