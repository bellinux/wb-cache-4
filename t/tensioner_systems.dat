40|$|The {{service life}} of {{offshore}} stainless steel cylinders used for riser <b>tensioner</b> <b>systems</b> {{is lower than}} expected. This {{is due to the}} complex degradation mechanisms, like corrosion, wear and fatigue, that take place under the harsh environmental conditions encountered in the North Sea. After extensive research focused on increasing the service life of the riser <b>tensioner</b> <b>systems,</b> a viable solution using uncoated, super-duplex stainless steel has showed promising results. The disadvantage of using this system is that the low hardness, super-duplex stainless steel piston, is found to wear of at the mid-stroke area. This indicates that there are some tribological conditions that are promoting wear. Several lubricants and seals have been tested to improve the wear resistance of the system, however this thesis is focused on improving the water-glycol, fire-resistant lubricants used for offshore hydraulic cylinders. By testing different commercially available polymer thickeners under both hydrodynamic and boundary lubrication conditions, the lubricating behaviour of the fluids that are used in piston cylinder applications have been evaluated. The studies show clear indications that high-molecular weight, non-Newtonian polymers are performing poor in hydraulic applications. A low molecular weight thickener with Newtonian behaviour is preferable. The most promising thickener for improving the water-glycol lubricant was found to be Thickener C. This is a low molecular weight polymer that provided near-Newtonian shear stability, low degree of temperature-viscosity dependency, low COF at hydrodynamic lubrication and lower wear in boundary lubrication than the reference lubricant in use today. Thickener C may improve the service life of the direct riser tensioner system by reducing the wear at boundary lubrication and COF at hydrodynamic lubrication...|$|E

The riser is modeled using the multi-body {{dynamics}} program MSC Adams, and the <b>tensioner</b> <b>system</b> using the powerful controls and systems simulation tool, MSC Easy 5. The hydrodynamic forces on the marine riser are calculated according to linear wave theory, and implemented in the model using a custom made subroutine. The riser is modeled using flexible beam elements according to Timoshenko beam theory. The <b>tensioner</b> <b>system</b> is modeled using moments of fluid system and body mechanics. The system is solved using equations of equilibrium of fluid momentum, mass and energy. For the unfamiliar reader, an introduction to deep sea oil exploration and production is given. Each subsystem included in the model is explained. The mode of working of the more complex subsystems is presented, followed by {{a discussion of the}} simplifications made to include them in the model. The hydrodynamic force module is based on linear potential theory of long waves, and Morison’s equation for oscillating structure in oscillating flow. An introduction to wave theories with derivation of the necessary equations is given, together with a thorough discussion of hydrodynamic coefficients. An introduction to the mechanics of fluid systems is presented, to give the reader the knowledge to understand the underlying principles of the Easy 5 tensioner model. A rough guide to MSC Adams and MSC Easy 5 explaining normal usage of the programs, alterations made to them and use of the 4 subsea interface, is presented. Theory regarding computational methods of solving ordinary differential equations is also offered. Finally all results are verified by analyzing similar models in the widely used and highly acknowledged global analysis program for slender marine structures RIFLEX. Excellent compliancy is found for the hydrodynamic force module and the forced vessel motion subroutine.

40|$|Top Tensioned Riser (TTR) and Steel Catenary Riser (SCR) {{are often}} used in a {{floating}} oil/gas production system deployed in deep water for oil transport. This study focuses on the improvements to the existing numerical code, known as CABLE 3 D, to allow for static and dynamic simulation of a TTR connected to a floating structure through a <b>tensioner</b> <b>system</b> or buoyancy can, and a SCR connected to a floating structure through a flex joint. A <b>tensioner</b> <b>system</b> usually consists of three to four cylindrical tensioners. Although the stiffness of individual tensioner {{is assumed to be}} linear, the resultant stiffness of a <b>tensioner</b> <b>system</b> may be nonlinear. The vertical friction at a riser guide is neglected assuming a roller is installed there. Near the water surface, a TTR is forced to move due to the motion of the upper deck of a floating structure as well as related riser guides. Using the up-dated CABLE 3 D, the dynamic simulation of TTRs will be made to reveal their motion, tension, and bending moment, which is important for the design. A flex joint is approximated by a rotational spring with linear stiffness, which is used as a connection between a SCR and a floating structure or a connection between a TTR and the sea floor. The improved CABLE 3 D will be integrated into a numerical code, known as COUPLE, for the simulation of the dynamic interaction among the hull of a floating structure, such as SPAR or TLP, its mooring system and riser system under the impact of wind, current and waves. To demonstrate the application of the improved CABLE 3 D and its integration with COUPLE, the related simulation is made for ?Constitution? SPAR under the met-ocean conditions of hurricane ?Ike?.

40|$|This {{doctoral}} thesis presents new research {{results on the}} control of top tensioned risers in deep waters. The main motivation for this work {{is the development of}} a riser control system which control the top tension of the individual risers in an array, such that collisions between adjacent risers are prevented. The risk of collision increases with increasing water depth, and as {{the oil and gas industry}} is moving to ever deeper waters, riser interaction has become an issue of considerable concern. The two main design parameters to avoid collision are riser spacing and top tension, which both are expensive alternatives. Hence, new solutions are needed and dynamic control of the top tension is the solution proposed here. A mathematical model of the riser system is developed. It includes two risers in a tandem arrangement which are connected to a tension leg platform (TLP) through their top nodes, forcing the risers to follow the prescribed motions of the TLP in the horizontal direction. In the vertical direction the riser motion is decided by the actuator which is a <b>tensioner</b> <b>system.</b> The risers are also exposed to current forces which are found by considering hydrodynamic interaction.

40|$|During S-lay {{pipeline}} installation, tension {{fluctuations in}} the suspended pipeline are compensated by the <b>tensioner</b> <b>system</b> on the vessel. The goal of this thesis is to answer the questions: to what extent does the active tension compensation (ATC) influence the pipeline integrity during offshore installation. Secondly, which tensioner model {{should be used for}} pipelay analyses that can give accurate results? And lastly, what is the implication on the existing tensioner models (deadband and linear damping with velocity cap) that are currently used in pipelay analyses? The pipelay operation is modelled in OrcaFlex with 7 case studies from shallow to deep water based on full-scale measurement data measured during offshore installation. For each case study, three types of measurement data are available: vessel motions, tensioner pay-out motion and pipeline top tension. Vessel motions and tensioner motion signals are used as inputs to the OrcaFlex model, whereas the measured tension signal is used for comparison with the output pipeline top tension for model validation. It is observed that the ATC becomes more important in deeper water as the reduction in maximum von Mises strain in the sagbend and accumulated fatigue damage become more significant with increasing water depth. The maximum von Mises strain is found to be in between 0 % and 2. 2 % lower from the model with uncompensated tension. Moreover, the reduction in accumulated fatigue damage is more significant as the allowable standby time increases between 3. 2 % and 19. 5 %. Subsequently, different tensioner models are included in the simulation. The tensioner model computes the pay-out motion based on the pipeline top tension deviation from a set tension at each time step. The initial model with specified tensioner motion is then used as a benchmark for the other tensioner models. It is found that the existing tensioner models are not conservative as the maximum von Mises strain and accumulated fatigue damage are underestimated, {{with the exception of the}} accumulated fatigue damage in shallow water cases. As an alternative to the existing tensioner model, a tensioner model with a PI controller is introduced to represent the PI controller of the <b>tensioners</b> <b>systems</b> on the vessel. This PI controller model scripted in Python is implemented as an external function to the OrcaFlex model. The controller gains are tuned proportional to the logged controller gains from the vessel so that the tensioner model produces the pay-out signal similar to the measured pay-out. Based on the pipeline integrity check, the tensioner model with PI controller is valid and can be used for a more accurate investigation of the pipeline integrity in all cases. <br/...|$|R

40|$|The {{emergency}} disconnection {{system and}} recoil analysis {{is required for}} every offshore drilling unit. Situations can occur where the vessel needs to disconnect from the well, {{it can be to}} large forces that are being transferred to the wellhead or that the vessel is unable to maintain its position over the well. When the tensioned riser is released between the BOP and LMRP it will accelerate upwards due to released tension and unbalanced force from the tensioners, this is referred to as riser recoil. The riser <b>tensioner</b> <b>system</b> is essential for understanding the recoil and it is presented in this thesis. This system gives the force variation when the riser retracts and contains the shut-off valves used in the anti recoil system for slowing down the riser. This thesis has focused on the use of SIMA RIFLEX as the tool for making a complete recoil analysis. Modelling issues are discussed on how well the physical phenomena of the recoil can be implemented in RIFLEX. Special attention have been given to force variation and damping in the riser <b>tensioner</b> <b>system.</b> Mass loss and friction forces when the high density mud inside the riser discharges. Slowing down the riser with the anti recoil system. None of these issues can be modelled directly in RIFLEX, and requires pre processing and simplifications. Two models were developed for the use in RILFEX, one for 500 meters water depth and one for 1500 meters water depth simulating a drift-off scenario. Impact between the BOP and LMRP is an issue if the riser does not achieve enough lift off after disconnection. A worst-case scenario was set up for the 500 m model in irregular waves. No impact occurred for different disconnection timings in the selected wave. However it was found that an impact could be plausible in larger waves. In the drift-off simulation resulting bending moments on the BOP and wellhead is of focus. The built in slug model in RIFLEX was attempted used for modelling of the mass loss. It was found that the slug model does not work for a complex riser, and an alternative model was developed. By specifying dynamical nodal forces in the global system, forces can be saved to the nodes of the riser. Then both the mass and the force representing the mass loss will be saved to the same nodes, but in different matrices. The alternative model provided a good lift off from the BOP, but does not change the actual mass of the system. Compression will be another problem induced by the forces lifting the riser. SIMA RIFLEX proved to lack some modelling options to serve well for a recoil analysis. </p...|$|R

40|$|In {{the pursuit}} of more oil and gas to meet the growing demand and replace the declining production, the {{offshore}} industry is pushed to invest, explore and drill new wells in deeper waters with harsh environments and with a possibility of HPHT wells and sour well flows. Drilling risers with strength and corrosion resistance capable of handling these extreme conditions are accordingly required. As the water depth increases, the length and weight of the riser might lead to problems in terms of; increased loadings on the handling equipment and <b>tensioner</b> <b>system,</b> as well as storage and transportation limitations. Today, the conventional riser material is steel. Steel is a strong and relatively cheap material. However, it is heavy and not very corrosion resistant. Hence, the industry has turned its focus to lighter alternative materials. Aluminum and titanium risers with their light weight, high strength-to-weight ratio and good corrosion resistance are potential candidates to substitute the heavy steel risers. In order to assess aluminum and titanium as alternative materials in riser design and determine if they are suitable for operations in the harsh environment in the Norwegian Sea, simulation studies in OrcaFlex has been conducted. The environmental data used in the simulations are from the Aasta Hansteen gas field, {{in an area of}} the Norwegian Sea where the water depth is about 1200 m. The output from the simulation software are compared with the ISO standard 13624 to find the maximum flex joint angles and von Mises stress. The results from the dynamic simulations show that wave height and drilling fluid density influences the effective tension, flex joint angles and the von Mises stress. The applied top tension proves to have the biggest impact on the results, and should be closely considered during the design phase. Aluminum and titanium both proves to fulfill the given design parameters, and can potentially be an alternative to the conventional steel riser in drilling operations in the Norwegian Sea. However, long term properties such as fatigue and corrosion should be investigated to get the full understanding...|$|R

40|$|The main {{concerns}} during drilling {{operations are}} riser integrity and maintaining well control. This thesis has mainly been {{focusing on the}} problems and challenges faced with the marine riser system to illuminate high risk areas related to riser integrity. A marine riser system consists generally of four main elements; the upper marine riser package, riser joints, lower marine riser package, and the blowout preventer, each playing {{an important part in}} the marine riser system. The marine riser function is to supports and guide the auxiliary lines used to control the well, and connect and provide for fluid communication between the drilling vessel and the wellhead. Failure to the marine riser is related to technical problems associated with old design and lack of correct operating procedure and maintenance method. Elements like the telescopic joint haven’t change the design since the 1960 ’s and are exposed to problems like unplanned discharge caused of premature war to the packer element. Problems with the telescopic joint are not unique there are also experienced failure with <b>tensioner</b> <b>system,</b> flex joint and blowout preventer. Studies show that blowout preventer failure cases the longest downtime and most expensive repairs. Over 50 % of blowout preventer failures are related to the control system and are caused by failure to the hydraulic components. Exploration activity forces the drilling contractor further out and into deeper water depths, like the Gulf of Mexico or outside the Coast of Brazil. Greater water depths challenge the riser system on many places. Deepwater operations means harsher environment and problems in the forms of large waves, strong currents and increased pressure from the water column, all affecting the operations and riser pipe in several ways. The environmental issues causes the riser to fail due to increased tensile load, vortex induced vibrations, environmentally induced cracks and increased corrosion attacks. The increased tensile load on the riser pipe place importance on the top tension capacity of the rig and the riser pipe wall thickness. Moving into deeper ground, many rigs reach their tension capacity and must use buoyancy modules to provide sufficient tension to the riser. Many of the problems could be addressed using simple solution, like implementing correct maintenance program or address the issues in the design phase. But economical impetus holds the development back. Solutions like redesign of the telescopic joint and blowout preventer is advised by operators, but some of the solution are proven to be economical unprofitable...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} modelling aspects {{related to}} dynamic analysis of deep water drilling risers. These risers {{must have a}} heave compensator that maintains a near constant tension independent of platform motions. Traditional riser analysis will apply constant top tension or a simple spring-damper model that may give approximate tension variation. The present thesis describes an alternative improved analysis procedure that consists of the following steps: Global riser analysis including the calculation of the dynamic stroke of the heave compensator from platform motions and riser dynamics. A "pipe-in-pipe" approach is used to represent the hydraulic cylinders. Calculation of dynamic tension variation from {{an analysis of the}} hydraulic <b>tensioner</b> <b>system.</b> The dynamic stroke found from the first analysis is applied as known piston motions in this analysis. Identification of parameters in a simple model for dynamic tension variation from the results from the second analysis. Use of the simple model in a second global riser analysis. The difference between the two riser analyses can hence be found. An integrated model of the hydraulic system and marine riser could preferably have been developed. This type of model can be based on the two computer programs applied in this study, but a real time communication between the programs must be established. This approach has not been attempted in the present study. A case study with data from a real situation is reported. The data shows that the constant tension model is only valid for small heave motions, while a spring-damper tensioner model can give almost correct results for tension variation. However, a parametric model must be tuned for each case. All data used in this study have been taken from the platform Aker Spitsbergen. The heave compensator on the platform was instrumented for recording of response data. It is primarily the acceleration measurement system on the Direct Acting Tensioner (DAT) that has been of interest. The main conclusion based on these measurements is that the accelerations are higher than 1. 5 ms - 2 The design criteria for the cylinders in the heave compensating system have been that {{they should be able to}} withstand a lateral acceleration of 1. 5 ms - 2 evenly distributed along the cylinder. The measurements confirm that there is a significant response component that is very likely to be caused by slamming loads.   As a result of inadequate design criteria all cylinders in corresponding applications are modified and replaced with cylinders that are designed to withstand higher accelerations. Tension variations from the DAT system are also higher than previously assumed. These tension variations should be taken into account in riser design analyses for existing and future platforms.

The main motivation for this work {{is the development of}} a riser control system which control the top tension of the individual risers in an array, such that collisions between adjacent risers are prevented. The risk of collision increases with increasing water depth, and as {{the oil and gas industry}} is moving to ever deeper waters, riser interaction has become an issue of considerable concern. The two main design parameters to avoid collision are riser spacing and top tension, which both are expensive alternatives. Hence, new solutions are needed and dynamic control of the top tension is the solution proposed here. A mathematical model of the riser system is developed. It includes two risers in a tandem arrangement which are connected to a tension leg platform (TLP) through their top nodes, forcing the risers to follow the prescribed motions of the TLP in the horizontal direction. In the vertical direction the riser motion is decided by the actuator which is a <b>tensioner</b> <b>system.</b> The risers are also exposed to current forces which are found by considering hydrodynamic interaction. The risers are modeled using the finite element method (FEM). This model is verified by the commercial software RIFLEX. For the purpose of control applications, the model needs to be computationally fast, but still be able to describe the main physics of the real system. The number of elements needed to keep a desired level of accuracy is therefore investigated. Different means to measure the performance of the model are considered, and among these, payout measurements reflected the displacement of the riser in the best manner. In addition measurements at the wellhead, like payout and tension, are both accurate and available at most installations today. Hence, the proposed control objectives are mainly based on keeping the top tension, payout or total riser length equal for the risers of concern. A simulation study showed that the dynamic variation of the riser elongation needed to be taken into account in the control algorithm for deep water risers. The reason was that the large difference between tension in the two risers resulted in a significant length difference that had to be compensated for by different payout. In shallow waters the difference between the riser elongations is smaller, and equal payout is shown to be appropriate. Equal tension, which is used by the industry today, could be applied for small current velocities. A second control objective principle was to measure the relative horizontal distance between the risers keeping it at a desired distance. This method showed promising results, but is dependent on measurements that are not easily available today. The best control objective used in the controller design was found to be equal effective length, meaning that the sum of the payout and the actual riser length should be equal for all risers. Introducing this method may reduce the needed spacing between the risers and thereby reduce the wellbay area on the TLP. A simulation study with model based supervisory switched control showed how the different controller structures and parameters could be included in the feedback loop depending on the operational conditions and riser behavior. The main contributions in this work are the mathematical modeling of the riser/TLP system, the model analysis, and the proposed controller architecture, including the control objectives and the supervisory switched control concept.
