5|$|At independence, a King George V 5 pence {{registered}} {{envelope and}} 1 shilling <b>telegram</b> form were printed in green {{for use in}} Ireland until domestic products became available. Irish <b>telegram</b> forms were only produced in 1/- and 1/6 values. Registered envelopes have appeared in many values and sizes. The printed (but non-stamped) registered envelopes were produced by private firms and stored by the Irish post office until needed, so envelopes from former periods, showing out-dated fees in the text, often received an impressed stamp for the current postal rate, creating many subtypes for collectors. Other products have carried post-paid imprint, such as commemorative and special issue postcards, including a series of St. Patrick's Day cards issued annually since 1984.|$|E

5|$|Both Eisenhower's {{speech to}} the excited crowd and <b>telegram</b> to his running mate were noncommittal.

While Eisenhower affirmed that the RNC {{had the power to}} elect a replacement candidate, Eisenhower indicated that the committee would, most likely, be guided by his wishes. Eisenhower asked Nixon to meet with him in person in Wheeling, West Virginia, where the general's campaign was next scheduled to go. Eisenhower's <b>telegram</b> was delayed in transmission and lost among the flood being sent to Nixon's suite, and the latter learned of his running mate's position from a wire service report.|$|E

Black tried to delay the execution with this <b>telegram</b> but Governor Oglesby refused. It was later learned that Schuetz was the primary witness against Mayhoff at his trial for insurance fraud, so Mayhoff's affidavit has never been regarded as credible by historians.|$|E

50|$|Keep in {{mind that}} since the Ethernet {{destination}} field in all Sercos III <b>telegrams</b> is the broadcast address of 0xFFFF FFFF FFFF (all 1s), all <b>telegrams</b> issued from this open port will be seen by other devices as broadcast <b>telegrams.</b> This behavior is by design, and cannot be disabled. To avoid taxing networks attached to an open Sercos port, an IP-Switch can be used, or alternately a managed Ethernet switch programmed to block broadcast <b>telegrams</b> received from the Sercos port can be used. Starting with Sercos III specification version 1.3.1 the connection of industrial Ethernet devices is supported where devices work with 20 ms cycle time in communication phase 0 (CP 0).|$|R
