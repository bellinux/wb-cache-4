5|$|Designed by Burges for himself, the Zodiac settle was {{originally}} placed in his rooms at 15 Buckingham Street on The Strand in London, and later moved to The Tower House in Holland Park around 1878, when Burges first occupied the house. The Tower House {{was designed by}} Burges by himself. Burges continued to work on Tower House {{until his death in}} 1881, and the Zodiac settle was placed opposite <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>room</b> windows in Tower House. The decoration of <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>room</b> remained unfinished upon Burges's death. The Tower House was subsequently owned by Burges's brother-in-law, Pullan, and then by Colonel T.H. Minshall in the 1920s. Minshall offered the Zodiac settle and other items from Tower House for sale in 1933, but the settle remained unsold.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{off from}} the Great Hall are the family's private Drawing Room and Parlour. In the 16th and early 17th centuries, in a house such as Montacute, the Parlour was where the family would dine, {{possibly}} with some of their upper servants. It allowed them not only privacy from dining publicly in the hall, but also less state and pomp than if dining in the Great Chamber above. Like its grander cousin above, the Parlour also had an adjoining principal bed chamber, now <b>the</b> <b>Drawing</b> <b>Room,</b> originally known as the White Chamber and later as the Round Parlour. As fashions and uses changed, and privacy from servants became desirable, like the later Baroque state apartments, these ground-floor rooms lost their original purpose and became a series of seemingly meaningless drawing rooms. The National Trust installed an incongruous 18th-century fireplace from Coleshill House in <b>the</b> <b>Drawing</b> <b>Room</b> in the mid-20th century. It is now furnished in 18th-century style.|$|E

5|$|Under his ownership, <b>the</b> <b>Drawing</b> <b>Room</b> was redecorated in a Renaissance Venetian style, In the process, Crace's {{stencilling}} {{was over}} painted and then covered by damasked silk, the Norton fireplace was removed, the furniture replaced with Edwardian pieces, and the carpet dyed by Sketchleys. In 1917, {{to assist the}} war effort, the ironwork conservatory was razed, and its ironwork melted down for ammunition.|$|E
5|$|When Beswick's family home, Cheetwood Old Hall was {{demolished}} in 1890 to {{make way}} for a brickyard, contractors discovered a double coffin buried underneath <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>room,</b> the mystery of the burial was never solved but at the time it was thought to be connected to the Beswick family and Dr White who had resided at the hall after Hannah Beswick removed to Oldham.|$|E
5|$|Nash's {{designs for}} the house {{included}} a three-storey octagonal tower, with two wings coming off it and a second square tower above a porte-cochère. Inside <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>room</b> occupied {{the ground floor of}} the tower, with a sitting room above. The dining room was designed to hold views across the valley, and the asymmetric rooms allowed for a panorama of views. To allow easy access to the gardens, the servant's quarters were moved to a separate wing, but made to be less prominent. A chapel was added in approximately 1862, and the house's loggia was converted into a conservatory.|$|E

5|$|Starting in January 2005, {{the mansion}} closed {{for almost three}} years as it {{underwent}} the major restoration project. As part of the 2005–07 renovations, <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>room</b> and two bedchambers were completely refurbished. The drawing room's furnishings were extensively researched to reflect accurately the Mansion in the 1830–60 period. The ornate cupola atop the mansion was restored, including the spherical ornament above the cupola, which was refinished in gold leaf. The Hampton Mansion re-opened to the public on November 30, 2007.|$|E
5|$|The Windlass Room, or Winch Room, {{is in the}} Gatehouse, entered from <b>the</b> <b>Drawing</b> <b>Room.</b> It {{contains}} a working mechanism for operating the drawbridge and the portcullis. The equipment was originally intended for the second floor, which Burges considered the most historically authentic location. When later design modifications led him to move Lord Bute's Bedroom into that space, the equipment was simplified and placed on the first floor. The Windlass Room includes murder holes, which Burges thought would have enabled medieval inhabitants of the castle to pour boiling water and oil on attackers.|$|E
5|$|Two of {{the rooms}} have large {{tapestries}} on their walls depicting historical figures and scenes. Those in <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>room</b> contain scenes from Roman history and were based on designs by Peter Paul Rubens, who supervised the work in Brussels. These tapestries were initially made for Dudley Carleton, 1st Viscount Dorchester, Zouche's brother-diplomat, {{but in the end}} he rejected them for another set; how the first set came to Bramshill is not known. Rubens' sketches for the first and last tapestries in the series are in the Munich gallery, Alte Pinakothek.|$|E

The trio of reception rooms here is completed by <b>the</b> blue <b>drawing</b> <b>room,</b> which is below the State Music Room. This was created in the 18th century by knocking together the 1st Duke's bedroom and dressing room, and has a door to his private gallery at the upper level of the chapel. It has also served as a billiard room and as a school room. Charity events are sometimes held in this part of <b>the</b> house.

5|$|In 1826 {{an ornate}} range was erected by St Mary Hall in the Gothic Revival style, {{incorporating}} the old gate of St Mary Hall, {{on the west}} side of the quad. Designed by Daniel Robertson, it contains two quite ornate oriels placed asymmetrically, one is of six lights, the other four. They are the best example of the pre-archaeological Gothic in Oxford. The large oriel on the first floor at the north end was once <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>room</b> window of the Principal of the Hall. Parts of the street wall incorporated into this range show traces of blocked windows dating from the same period of rebuilding in the 15th century as the present-day staircase ten.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} to other rooms within the castle, Lord Bute's Bedroom, sited above the Winch Room, {{is relatively small}} and simple. The original plan had Bute's personal accommodation in the Keep but the expansion of <b>the</b> <b>Drawing</b> <b>Room</b> to a double-height room in 1879 required a late change of plan. The bedroom contains an ornately carved fireplace. Doors lead off the room to an internal balcony overlooking the courtyard and to the bretache over the gate arch. The furniture is mainly by Chapple and post-dates Burges, although the washstand and dressing table are pared-down versions of two pieces – the Narcissus Washstand and the Crocker Dressing Table – that Burges made for his own home in London, The Tower House.|$|E
5|$|The long gallery, {{along the}} north side, has a chimneypiece in {{coloured}} marbles with busts by Henry Weekes depicting Sir Randolph Crewe and Nathaniel Crew, 3rd Baron Crew, Bishop of Durham. The library, above the carved parlour, contains statuettes of book lovers by Philip and a frieze of scenes from literature by J. Mabey. <b>The</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>room</b> has a facsimile of the Jacobean ceiling, which had been recorded by architect William Burn. Identical in pattern to one at the Reindeer Inn in Banbury, of which the Victoria and Albert Museum has a plaster cast, it was presumably originally {{the work of the}} same craftsman. One of the state bedrooms has another survivor of the fire, a Jacobean stone fireplace with a plaster overmantel relief depicting Cain and Abel.|$|E

Douglas Dillon, who donated its unique wallpaper, a Chinese print from 1770. Dillon's wife Phyllis purchased the wallpaper {{on the recommendation of}} interior designer Eleanor Brown in 1964. The wallpaper was removed and refurbished between 1982 and 1988. The room is furnished with 18th century English pieces, along with Chinese vases from the Ming and Qing (Kangxi reign) dynasties. <b>The</b> Dillon <b>Drawing</b> <b>Room</b> is used by resident heads of state and chiefs of government to formally receive visitors.|$|R
5|$|The first {{room from}} the {{corridor}} was the living room, with a wainscot, pilasters, cornice, and door and window frames all of Spanish cedar, and a mantelpiece imported from an Italian chateau. Walls are paneled in green silk, mirroring the rug and furnishings. In its early history, the walls were inlaid with embossed Italian leather. <b>The</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>room,</b> {{sometimes referred to as}} the music room, salon, or parlor was at the center, with paneled walls in ivory white and gold, with gilded moldings and ornaments. There are richly interlaced panels above the doorways with paintings inserted in them. The mantle dates to around 1700, and is of mottled purple and white marble, and has a built-in mirror above it. The room has richly gilt chandeliers hanging from ornamental reliefs in the otherwise plain ceiling. Furniture was of tapestry and gold, with a light rug and yellow and gold curtains at the windows and doors.|$|E
5|$|The main {{family living}} {{quarters}} {{are located in}} the 1752 addition. The staircase hall is the only room in the 1752 house to have kept its original, Georgian interior. The rococo plaster ceiling is attributed to Shrewsbury-born architect, Thomas Farnolls Pritchard, who also designed interiors at Tatton Hall, Powis Castle and Croft Castle. Facing the gardens, {{on the north side of}} the house, is the library. Remodelled in the early 1800s, this room was previously used by the family as a dining room. It features fitted 19th-century mahogany bookcases, decorated with small acanthus friezes. The white marble fireplace is flanked on either side by family coats of arms. Connecting the library to the staircase hall and <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>room</b> is the ante-room, which is furnished with pieces commissioned by the family in the late 18th century. Originally, an entrance into the hall was located in this octagonal room, until Randle Wilbraham III relocated it. The room features copies of works by Raphael, attributed to Michelangelo Maestri.|$|E
5|$|The {{politician}} Lord Granville {{was offered}} the post of Lord Warden by the new Prime Minister, John Russell in 1865. Russell noted that the role would be expensive for Granville to perform — the salary had been abolished in 1828 — but that it would provide him with a property by the sea, which Granville had been seeking to acquire for a while. Granville took over Walmer in 1865. He expanded the gardens, built new kennels for a hunting pack and spent many years reassembling the furniture and other objects that Pitt and Wellington had used at the castle. He received large numbers of visitors, many of whom stopped off while travelling to or from France. The diplomat Baron de Malortie visited Granville and his family at Walmer, and later praised the homely atmosphere in the castle. He described how, after breakfast, the family and guests would all gather in <b>the</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>room,</b> which was the only large room in the house, and Granville would answer government correspondence amid the daily life {{of the rest of}} the household.|$|E

On the fifth floor of the circular tower is a room designed for playing rackets, which is approached by a stone spiral staircase.|$|E
5|$|Deeply in debt, William made {{multiple}} {{attempts at}} marrying a wealthy heiress such as Catherine Tylney-Long, but his suits were unsuccessful. Following {{the death of}} William's niece Princess Charlotte of Wales, then second-in-line to the British throne, in 1817, the king was left with twelve children, but no legitimate grandchildren. The race was on among the royal dukes to marry and produce an heir. William had great advantages in this race—his two older brothers were both childless and estranged from their wives, who were both beyond childbearing age anyway, and William was the healthiest of the three. If he lived long enough, he would almost certainly ascend the British and Hanoverian thrones, and {{have the opportunity to}} sire the next monarch. William's initial choices of potential wives either met with the disapproval of his eldest brother, the Prince of Wales, or turned him down. William's younger brother Adolphus, the Duke of Cambridge, was sent to Germany to scout out the available Protestant princesses; he came up with Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel, but her father Frederick declined the match. Two months later, the Duke of Cambridge married Augusta himself. Eventually, a princess was found who was amiable, home-loving, and was willing to accept, even enthusiastically welcoming William's nine surviving children, several of whom had not yet reached adulthood. In <b>the</b> <b>Drawing</b> <b>Room</b> at Kew Palace on 11 July 1818, William married Princess Adelaide of Saxe-Meiningen, the daughter of George I, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen. At 25, Adelaide was half William's age.|$|E
5|$|When John Spencer died in 1522, {{he passed}} the estate to his {{youngest}} son, Sir William Spencer, High Sheriff of Northamptonshire, who held it {{until his death in}} 1532. Only a boy at the time of William's death, his son John Spencer inherited Althorp and held it until his death in 1586, when he passed it to his son, also John, who died in 1600. John's son, Robert, was created the 1st Baron Spencer of Wormleighton on 21 July 1603. King Charles I is documented to have visited Althorp during his reign. <b>The</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>room</b> was built and the main hall enlarged for the occasion, with £1,300 spent on the banquet, an exorbitant sum for the period. Upon Robert Spencer's death in 1627 Althorp devolved to William Spencer, 2nd Baron Spencer of Wormleighton who held it until his death in 1636. William's eldest son, Henry Spencer, 1st Earl of Sunderland, known as The Lord Spencer between 1636 and June 1643, fought in the Battle of Edgehill in 1642 and was rewarded for his services on 8 June 1643 when the title of Earl of Sunderland was bestowed upon him, although the title cost him £3,000. He then fought in the Siege of Gloucester in August 1643 and the First Battle of Newbury on 20 September 1643, where he was killed, aged 23, by a cannonball.|$|E
