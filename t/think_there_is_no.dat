25|$|Berkeley's biographer, J. D. Davies, wrote after {{examining}} his letters that Berkeley {{appears as a}} 'lively, friendly young man, fully aware of his dependence on the patronage of others, supportive of and loving towards his family, and genuinely enthusiastic to make a success of his chosen career', quoting a letter from William to Charles Berkeley in June 1663: I must assure you I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> so beggarly a trade as this if people serve truly and honestly, as I am resolved I will do, although I am never worth six pence. All my hope is on my dearest brother's kindness.|$|E
500|$|Calvert {{dispatched}} Captain Edward Wynne and a {{group of}} Welsh colonists to Ferryland, where they landed in August 1621, and set about constructing a settlement. Wynne sent positive reports concerning the potential for local fisheries and for the production of salt, hemp, flax, tar, iron, timber and hops. Wynne also praised the climate, declaring, [...] "It is better and not so cold as England," [...] and predicted that the colony would become self-sufficient after one year. Others corroborated Wynne's reports: for example, Captain Daniel Powell, who delivered a further party of settlers to Ferryland, wrote: [...] "The land on which our Governor [...] planted is so good and commodious, that for the quantity, I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> better in many parts of England"; but he added ominously that Ferryland was [...] "the coldest harbour in the land". Wynne and his men began work on various building projects, including a substantial house and the shoring up of the harbour. To protect them against marauding French warships, a recent hazard in the area, since the recent founding of New France in the interior (modern Lower Canada of the 18th and 19th centuries, Province of Quebec and Dominion of Canada) along the St. Lawrence River, Calvert employed the pirate John Nutt.|$|E
2500|$|I {{think the}} {{decision}} {{will have no}} impact on people's right to privacy, because I don't regard truthful information in court records published by court order in a newspaper to be private information. If anything, the decision is likely to simply muddle the interesting philosophical questions {{and make it more}} difficult to make real progress on privacy issues. In the case of truthful, non-defamatory information obtained legally, I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> possibility of any defensible [...] "right" [...] to censor what other people are saying. It is important to avoid language like [...] "data" [...] because we aren't talking about [...] "data"—we are talking about the suppression of knowledge.|$|E

2500|$|Regarding his {{religious}} beliefs, Carolla has stated, [...] "I am not agnostic. I am atheist. I don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> God; I know there's no God. I know there's no God {{the same way}} I know many other laws in our universe. I know there's no God and I know {{most of the world}} knows that as well. They just won't admit it because there's another thing they know: they know they're going to die, and it freaks them out. So most people don't have the courage to admit there's no God and they know it. They feel it. They try to suppress it. And if you bring it up they get angry because it freaks them out." ...|$|E

"I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> better {{example of}} my naivete and {{insensitivity}} than the swastika comments [...] [...] [...] my comments derive from my long interest in Indian culture, {{from which the}} swastika has its origins [...] [...] [...] I apologise {{to those who have}} been offended by my comment and humbly ask that they accept that I am completely against the Nazis, their crimes and any other latter-day form of totalitarianism. For the record I have never been an anti-semite especially as my dear grandmother was Jewish [...] [...] [...] I loathe totalitarianism, far right thinking, oppression of all forms, denial of human rights and all things that would limit the free spirit of humankind. I stand for peace, love, generosity and learning." ...|$|E
2500|$|Haddon added, in the {{conversation}} with Terry Gross, [...] "I have to say honestly that I did more research about the London Underground and the inside of Swindon Railway Station, {{where some of the}} novel takes place, than I did about Asperger's syndrome. I gave him kind of nine or 10 rules that he would live his life by, and then I didn't read any more about Asperger's because I <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> typical person who has Asperger's syndrome, and they're as large and diverse a group of people as any other group in society. And {{the important thing is that}} I did a lot of imagining, that I did a lot of putting myself into his shoes in trying to make him come alive as a human being rather than getting him right, whatever that might mean." ...|$|E

6000|$|The {{thoughts}} come in as {{a witness}} for God against the sinner upon the account of that unsteadiness and variety that were in them, both touching God, and their own selves.
