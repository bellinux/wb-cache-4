5000|$|The novel's {{historical}} backdrop is the North African/Italian Campaigns of World War II. The {{story is}} told out of sequence, {{moving back and forth}} between the severely burned [...] "English" [...] patient's memories from before his accident and current events at the bomb-damaged Villa San Girolamo, an Italian monastery, where he is being cared for by Hana, a troubled young Canadian Army nurse. <b>The</b> <b>English</b> <b>patient's</b> only possession is a well-worn, and heavily annotated copy of Herodotus's The Histories that has survived the fiery parachute drop. Hearing the book constantly being read aloud to him brings about detailed recollections of his desert explorations, yet he is unable to recall his own name. Instead, he chooses to believe the assumption by others that he is an Englishman based on the sound of his voice. The patient is in fact László de Almásy, a Hungarian Count and desert explorer, one of many members of a British cartography group.|$|R

5|$|Canadian {{literature}} is often divided into French- and English-language literatures, which {{are rooted in}} the literary traditions of France and Britain, respectively. There are four major themes that can be found within historical Canadian literature; nature, frontier life, Canada's position within the world, all three of which tie into the garrison mentality. By the 1990s, Canadian literature was viewed as some of the world's best. Canada's ethnic and cultural diversity are reflected in its literature, with many of its most prominent modern writers focusing on ethnic life. Arguably, the best-known living Canadian writer internationally (especially since the deaths of Robertson Davies and Mordecai Richler) is Margaret Atwood, a prolific novelist, poet, and literary critic. Numerous other Canadian authors have accumulated international literary awards; including Nobel Laureate Alice Munro, who has been called the best living writer of short stories in English; and Booker Prize recipient Michael Ondaatje, who is perhaps best known for the novel <b>The</b> <b>English</b> <b>Patient,</b> which was adapted as a film of the same name that won the Academy Award for Best Picture.|$|E

40|$|AbstractBackgroundSurveys of the {{experience}} of cancer patients are increasingly being introduced in different countries and used in cancer epidemiology research. Sampling processes, post-sampling mortality and survey non-response can influence the representativeness of cancer patient surveys. MethodsWe examined predictors of post-sampling mortality and non-response among patients initially included in the sampling frame of <b>the</b> <b>English</b> Cancer <b>Patient</b> Experience Survey. We also compared the respondents’ diagnostic case-mix to other relevant populations of cancer patients, including incident and prevalent cases. ResultsOf 109, 477 initially sampled cancer patients, 6273 (5. 7 %) died between sampling and survey mail-out. Older age and diagnosis of brain, lung and pancreatic cancer were associated with higher risk of post-sampling mortality. The overall response rate was 67 % (67, 713 respondents), being > 70 % for the most affluent patients and those diagnosed with colon or breast cancer and < 50 % for Asian or Black patients, those under 35 and those diagnosed with brain cancer. The diagnostic case-mix of respondents varied substantially from incident or prevalent cancer cases. ConclusionsRespondents to <b>the</b> <b>English</b> Cancer <b>Patient</b> Experience Survey represent a population of recently treated cancer survivors. Although patient survey data can provide unique insights for improving cancer care quality, features of survey populations need to be acknowledged when analysing and interpreting findings from studies using such data...|$|R

The Hungarian táncház movement, started in the 1970s, involves strong cooperation between musicology experts and enthusiastic amateurs. However, traditional Hungarian folk music and folk culture barely survived in some rural areas of Hungary, and it has also begun to disappear among the ethnic Hungarians in Transylvania.

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>English</b> noun compassion, {{meaning to}} love {{together}} with, comes from Latin.

40|$|Objective. To examine {{differences}} in the characteristics of adverse events between <b>English</b> speaking <b>patients</b> and <b>patients</b> with limited <b>English</b> proficiency in US hospitals. Setting. Six Joint Commission accredited hospitals in the USA. Method. Adverse event data on <b>English</b> speaking <b>patients</b> and <b>patients</b> with limited <b>English</b> proficiency were collected from six hospitals over 7 months in 2005 and classified using the National Quality Forum endorsed Patient Safety Event Taxonomy. Results. About 49. 1 % of limited <b>English</b> proficient <b>patient</b> adverse events involved some physical harm whereas only 29. 5 % of adverse events for <b>patients</b> who speak <b>English</b> resulted in physical harm. Of those adverse events resulting in physical harm, 46. 8 % of <b>the</b> limited <b>English</b> proficient <b>patient</b> adverse events had a level of harm ranging from moderate temporary harm to death, compared with 24. 4 % of <b>English</b> speaking <b>patient</b> adverse events.

Conclusions. Language barriers appear to increase the risks to patient safety. It is important for patients with language bar-riers to have ready access to competent language services. Providers need to collect reliable language data at the patient point of entry and document the language services provided during the patient–provider encounter...|$|R

500|$|Leslie {{indicates}} {{she had a}} dream involving American actress Gina Gershon. For her mural, Donna {{proposes a}} recreation of Leonardo da Vinci's painting The Last Supper with Indiana natives {{in place of the}} apostles. Actor Greg Kinnear was chosen to replace Jesus, with the Apostles replaced by John Mellencamp, Larry Bird, Michael Jackson, David Letterman and a NASCAR race car, among others. Jerry presents for his mural a work of pointillism, a style of painting in which small distinct dots of color create the impression of a wider image. When proposing her somber mural, Leslie claims tragedy often succeeds in awards, and specifically cites the Academy Awards which honor the film industry. As an example, Leslie uses <b>The</b> <b>English</b> <b>Patient,</b> the 1996 Best Picture winner during the 69th Academy Awards. Upon first receiving his painting, Tom says, [...] "It looks like a lizard puking up Skittles", a reference to the multi-colored candies. Leslie, upon the idea of putting the best parts of each design into a new mural, says it is like having Michelangelo, Andy Warhol, Jackson Pollock and Jim Davis do one painting. When Mark tries to get out of helping with the mural, he uses the excuse, [...] "I was gonna go to Arby's and watch Frontline", a reference to a fast food restaurant chain and a Public Broadcasting Service public affairs program.
