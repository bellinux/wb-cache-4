5|$|On May 25, 1948, during <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Old City, {{commander}} of the Jordanian Arab Legion, Major Abdullah el-Tell, wrote to Otto Lehner of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement to warn that unless the Haganah abandoned its positions in the synagogue and its adjoining courtyard, he {{would be forced to}} attack it. Moshe Russnak, {{commander of}} the Haganah in the Old City, ignored his request, knowing that if the Hurva fell, <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Jewish Quarter would soon be lost. On May 26, 1948, the Jordanian Arab Legion delivered an ultimatum to the Jews to surrender within 12 hours; otherwise the Hurva would be bombarded.|$|E

5|$|The Suvla landing was {{reinforced}} {{by the arrival of}} the British 53rd and 54th Divisions along with the British 10th Division from Kitchener's New Army divisions plus the dismounted yeomanry of the 2nd Mounted Division. The unfortunate 29th Division was also shifted from Helles to Suvla for one more push. The final British attempt to resuscitate the offensive came on 21 August with attacks at Scimitar Hill and Hill 60. Control of these hills would have united the Anzac and Suvla fronts, but neither battle achieved success. When fighting at Hill 60 ceased on 29 August, <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Sari Bair heights, and indeed <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> peninsula, was effectively over.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the Japanese air attacks on the task force, one U.S. heavy cruiser was sunk, a {{destroyer}} was heavily damaged, {{and the rest of the}} U.S. task force was forced to retreat from the southern Solomons area. Partly because they turned back the U.S. task force in this battle, the Japanese successfully evacuated their remaining troops from Guadalcanal by 7 February 1943, leaving it in the hands of the Allies and ending <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> island.|$|E
5|$|By 6:30a.m. <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Alamo was over. Mexican {{soldiers}} inspected each corpse, bayoneting any {{body that}} moved. Even {{with all of}} the Texians dead, Mexican soldiers continued to shoot, some killing each other in the confusion. Mexican generals were unable to stop the bloodlust and appealed to Santa Anna for help. Although the general showed himself, the violence continued and the buglers were finally ordered to sound a retreat. For 15minutes after that, soldiers continued to fire into dead bodies.|$|E

5|$|After the {{conclusion}} of <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Donets, as the spring rasputitsa (mud) season {{came to an end}} in 1943, both the German and Soviet commands considered their plans for future operations. The Soviet premier Joseph Stalin and some senior Soviet officers wanted to seize the initiative first and attack the German forces inside the Soviet Union, but they were convinced by a number of key commanders, including the Deputy Supreme Commander Georgiy Zhukov, to assume a defensive posture instead. This would allow the German side to weaken themselves in attacking prepared positions, after which the Soviet forces would be able to respond with a counter-offensive.|$|E

5|$|Khrushchev {{reached the}} Stalingrad Front in August 1942, {{soon after the}} start of <b>the</b> <b>battle</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> city. His role in the Stalingrad defense was not major—General Vasily Chuikov, who led the city's defense, {{mentions}} Khrushchev only briefly in a memoir published while Khrushchev was premier—but {{to the end of his}} life, he was proud of his role. Though he visited Stalin in Moscow on occasion, he remained in Stalingrad for much of the battle, and was nearly killed at least once. He proposed a counterattack, only to find that Zhukov and other generals had already planned Operation Uranus, a plan to break out from Soviet positions and encircle and destroy the Germans; it was being kept secret. Before Uranus was launched, Khrushchev spent much time checking on troop readiness and morale, interrogating Nazi prisoners, and recruiting some for propaganda purposes.|$|E

MacLachlan saw the Italian fleet at a distance and witnessed enemy shells splashing around the ship.

The pilots had not run the Hurricanes at economic speeds for fuel consumption.|$|E
5|$|Nash's {{football}} career {{continued to}} soar as several Victorian Football League clubs sought to recruit Laurie and Robert Junior.
