But with the help from my friends and my family, they all kept <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> believe in myself and keep on doing it and I did and now I'm here and thank you so much to them.|$|E
500|$|Several of {{the scenes}} {{were based on the}} actor's real-life talents as well as improvised. When Michael tells Pam to [...] "write this down", Jenna Fischer's {{response}} to the camera was improvised. [...] "I thought it was funny that I didn't have a pad of paper but Michael was <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> take notes," [...] she explained in her MySpace blog, [...] "so I just looked to the camera and showed my lack of pen and paper." [...] Jim's impression of Stanley in this episode was inspired by John Krasinski's actual talent of doing impressions on the set.|$|E

500|$|After {{his victory}} Maguire {{acknowledged}} {{the influence of}} Terry Griffiths {{who had been working}} with him on the mental side of the game: [...] "He's been on the phone just <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> keep calm and that I can do it if I believe in myself". Maguire said he always knew he was good enough to win a tournament and that he would aim for a top-16 finish for the season.

I'm pleased for him because he's a nice lad but I'm disappointed because I didn't compete".|$|E
500|$|Azalea found [...] "Bounce" [...] to be {{different}} from her previous releases and the most commercial song on The New Classic. She initially felt that it was a risky choice for a single, and consulted Nas regarding the decision; [...] "With 'Bounce,' I was like, 'It's a pop record. I don't know.' [...] was like, 'Just fucking do it. It's something different. It's one song, what's the big deal?' I couldn't believe Nas was <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do a hip-pop record." [...] Azalea also did not intend to include the song on The New Classic, believing that it strayed too far from the album's musical and lyrical themes, but her record label convinced her otherwise and it was included as one of the album's three bonus tracks. The song was later included in the main track listing of the album's reissue, Reclassified.|$|E
500|$|The direct {{impetus for}} the lyrics was an {{encounter}} with IRA supporters in New York City. As a promotional gimmick, U2 manager Paul McGuinness had made arrangements for the band {{to appear in the}} 1982 St. Patrick's Day parade. However, he later found that there was a possibility that Bobby Sands, an IRA hunger striker who had starved to death the previous year, would be the parade's honorary marshal. As they felt that the IRA's tactics were prolonging the fighting in Northern Ireland, McGuinness and the band members mutually decided they should withdraw from the parade. McGuinness met with one of the parade's organizers in a New York bar to arrange the cancellation, and ended up in a heated debate about the IRA. McGuinness recalled, [...] "He kept <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> keep my voice down. The place was full of New York policemen - Irish cops - and he thought I was going to get us killed." ...|$|E

500|$|Solti {{described}} {{his father as}} [...] "a kind, sweet man who trusted everyone. He shouldn't have, but he did. Jews in Hungary were tremendously patriotic. In 1914, when war broke out, my father invested most of his money in a war loan to help the country. By the time the bonds matured, they were worthless." [...] Mor Stern was a religious man, but his son was less so. Late in life Solti recalled, [...] "I often upset him because I never stayed in the synagogue for longer than ten minutes." [...] Teréz Stern was from a musical family, and encouraged her daughter Lilly, eight years the elder of the children, to sing, and György to accompany her at the piano. Solti remembered, [...] "I made so many mistakes, but it was invaluable experience for an opera conductor. I learnt to swim with her." [...] He was not a diligent student of the piano: [...] "My mother kept <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> practise, but what ten-year-old wants {{to play the piano}} when he could be out playing football?" ...|$|E

[...] A classmate recalled her singing the refrain [...] "Can't help lovin' that man of mine" [...] from Show Boat with such feeling that she made their teacher uncomfortable. After leaving Splott Secondary Modern School {{at the age of}} 14, Bassey found employment at the Curran Steels factory while singing in public houses and clubs in the evenings and on weekends.|$|E

Just play the game." [...] Prince commented, [...] "He was trying to teach me and I had my head down so he raised my chin up.

During {{the course of the}} film, Johnson reflects on his somewhat difficult relationship with his often-absent father as well as his own battle with alcoholism. Said Johnson of the journey, [...] "I started to get this idea that some people thought was crazy, but something was <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> do it… to recreate my father’s airplane and retrace his journey.

2500|$|In his 2009 book [...] "Parkour", David Belle {{stressed}} {{that the most important}} aspect of parkour is not the physical movements, but rather the practitioner's mentality and understanding of its principles. [...] "When young trainees come to see me and give me videos <b>telling</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> check out what they are doing, I just take the tape and throw it away. What I'm interested in is what the guy's got in his head, if he has self-confidence, if he masters the technique, if he has understood the principles of parkour. I just can't deal with guys who do Parkour because they saw videos on the Internet and thought it was kinda cool and want to do even better." [...] Further, he states the importance of traceurs being aware of their abilities and limitations, and developing in their own way. [...] "When a young person asks me: 'Can you show me how to do this?' I simply answer: [...] "No, I am going to show you how I do it. Then, you'll have to learn with your own technique, your own way of moving, your style, your abilities and your limitations. You are going to learn to be yourself, not someone else." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Egypt Independent {{reported}} that police forces dragged a protester, stripped him naked, {{beat him up}} with batons, {{and took him to}} a security truck.

[...] State television {{reported that}} the 48-year-old beaten man, from a police hospital and without a lawyer present, said that the police had in fact saved him from thieving protesters. The man's daughter, who says she was present {{at the scene of the}} attack, said that her father is simply [...] "afraid to talk", while his nephew said [...] "he is lying because there is a lot of pressure on him." [...] In new twist, Hamada Saber finally retracted his earlier testimony: [...] "I told [...] today that [...] shot me in the leg, beat me and dragged me," [...] he said. [...] "When I resisted, they tore off my shirt. After I resisted some more, they tore off my pants and underpants.
