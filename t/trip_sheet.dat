40|$|AbstractTransformation induced {{plasticity}} (TRIP) steels, {{which were}} initially developed for automotive applications, have attracted a growing interest {{due to the}} fact that they exhibit a combination of high strength and ductility through their multi-phase microstructure that includes ferrite, bainite and retained austenite. This one transforms to martensite under the external tensile stress. The characterization of microstructure is necessary for understanding its relationship with steel properties. Electron Back Scatter Diffraction (EBSD) technique could be used successfully for determining the texture and fiber-texture components in body centered cubic (BCC) and face centered cubic (FCC) phases and try to establish the role of deformation in microstructure transformation.

40|$|A {{new process}} concept, "quenching and partitioning" (Q&P) has been {{proposed}} recently for creating steel microstructures with retained austenite. The process involves quenching austenite below the martensite-start temperature, followed by a partitioning treatment to enrich the remaining austenite with carbon, thereby stabilizing it to room temperature. The process concept is reviewed here, along with the thermodynamic basis for the partitioning treatment, and a model for designing some of the relevant processing temperatures. These concepts are applied to silicon-containing steels that are currently being examined for low-carbon <b>TRIP</b> <b>sheet</b> steel applications, and medium-carbon bar steel applications, along with a silicon-containing ductile cast iron.

40|$|Abstract. Recent {{decades have}} {{witnessed}} some remarkable advances in engineering steels {{driven by the}} need to respond to challenges posed, for example, by recovery and transmission of oil and gas, or enhanced vehicle safety and fuel economy. Foremost amongst these must surely be the extended application of carbon steels, achieved principally through ferrite grain refinement by the practice of microalloying coupled with controlled thermomechanical processing. Limitations to strengthening ferrite/pearlite structures further by grain refinement or precipitation, however, has focused attention back to acicular forms of microstructure. One of the most interesting advances in this area has been the development of bainitic steels, which have been almost dormant since the mid- 20 th century. This resurgence may partly be attributed to a better appreciation of the bainite transformation mechanism, and the experimental work for this which unexpectedly spawned some interesting bainitic microstructures which have seen further development and application. These are the so-called ‘carbide-free ’ bainites, which employ alloying to replace carbides, principally cementite, with carbon-stabilized retained austenite. Particularly noteworthy has been the emergence of the transformation induced plasticity (<b>TRIP)</b> <b>sheet</b> steels with enhanced properties principally targeted for automotive use.

In the present study, transformation behaviour of blocky and lath-shaped retained austenite during straining was investigated to clarify {{its effect on}} mechanical properties. Two types of TRIP steels containing almost the same amount but the different morphology of retained austenite were used. A steel containing large amount of lath-shaped retained austenite exhibits superior ductility, and sustains high work-hardenability in a high strain region. On the contrast, a steel containing large amount of blocky retained austenite exhibits low ductility. The work-hardenability increased steeply to the maximum at a low strain region, and then reduced in a high strain region. The stability of the blocky austenite {{has been found to}} be poor with respected to martensite transformation. The lath-shaped retained austenite remains until a high strain region whereas the blocky retained austenite transformed into martensite in a low strain region. Carbon content was higher in the lath-shaped retained austenite than in the blocky retained austenite. Stability of retained austenite is, however, inexplicable only by the carbon content, and would be affected by the different morphology and the resulting restraint conditions...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} work focuses on characterization of CO 2 {{laser beam welding}} (LBW) of dual phase (DP) and transformation induced plasticity (<b>TRIP)</b> steel <b>sheets</b> based on experimental, numerical simulation and statistical modeling approaches. The experimental work aimed to investigate the welding induced-microstructures, hardness, tensile properties and formability limit of laser welding butt joints of DP/DP, TRIP/TRIP and DP/TRIP steel sheets under different welding speeds. The effects of shielding gas types and flow rates on the weldability of DP/TRIP steel sheets were also studied. The simulation of laser welding of DP/TRIP steel sheets through welding induced-temperature field, thermal cycles, residual stresses and distortions using Sysweld 2010 software v 12. 0 was the second goal of this research. Also stretch formability (Erichsen test) was simulated in this step using Abaqus/CAE software v 6. 9 - 1. The aim of statistical modeling was to predict and optimize laser welding of DP/TRIP steel sheets in industry through applying a three-factor-three-level Box-Behnken statistical design with full replication as a design of experiment (DoE) approach to design the experiments, develop mathematical models and optimize the welding operation. This was achieved by controlling selected welding parameters: laser power, welding speed and focus position. The experimental {{results showed that the}} CO 2 LBW is a successfully welding process for butt joining of DP and <b>TRIP</b> steels <b>sheets.</b> The LBW of DP/TRIP steel sheets is successfully numerically simulated using the finite element (FE) code SYSWELD when using a 3 D Gaussian distribution heat source model with a conical shape. There are good agreements between the experimental- and FE- results during simulation of stretch formability of DP/TRIP steel weldments when using von Mises yielding model as yielding criterion.

40|$|In {{metropolitan}} cities, {{public transportation}} service plays {{a vital role}} in mobility of people, and it has to introduce new routes more frequently due to the fast development of the city in terms of population growth and city size. Whenever there is introduction of new route or increase in frequency of buses, the nonrevenue kilometers covered by the buses increases as depot and route starting/ending points are at different places. This non-revenue kilometers or dead kilometers depends on the distance between depot and route starting point/ending point. The dead kilometers not only results in revenue loss but also results in an increase in the operating cost because of the extra kilometers covered by buses. Reduction of dead kilometers is necessary for the economic growth of the public transportation system. Therefore, in this study, the attention is focused on minimizing dead kilometers by optimizing allocation of buses to depots depending upon the shortest distance between depot and route starting/ending points. We consider also depot capacity and time period of operation during allocation of buses to ensure parking safety and proper maintenance of buses. Mathematical model is developed considering the aforementioned parameters, which is a mixed integer program, and applied to Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation (BMTC) routes operating presently in order to obtain optimal bus allocation to depots.

Along the interface between the inhibition layer and the steel substrate Mn/Mn-P oxides were frequently observed. Although these oxides at the steel surface reduce the adhesion between the zinc coating and the TRIP steel, they do not cause any bare spots during galvanizing. Upon tensile deformation of the galvanized steel sheet, cracking along the α-zinc grain boundaries preceded fracture of the interface between the α-Zn layer and the inhibition layer.

This alloy has particular relevance since it is widely used in the aeronautical industry for building aircraft structures. The deformation behaviour of this material has been characterised in tension under wide ranges of strain rate and temperature. Among the aluminium alloys, the AA 2024 -T 3 highlights due to its high flow stress and strain hardening. Moreover, the material temperature sensitivity has been found dependent on plastic strain. The Modified Rusinek-Klepaczko constitutive description [Rusinek A, Rodriguez-Martinez JA, Arias A. A thermo-viscoplastic constitutive model for FCC metals with application to OFHC copper. Int. J. Mech.

40|$|International audienceIt is now {{commonly}} {{accepted that}} the so-called Baushinger effect {{has to be taken}} into account for accurate springback predictions during sheet metal forming simulations. Baushinger effect can be modelled through the introduction of a kinematic hardening law in the material model. The identification of such a behaviour requires to perform tests such that the material is subjected to reversal loadings. In the case of thin sheets, tension-compression tests are impossible because of buckling. Two alternative solutions can be found in the literature: shear tests and bending tests. Since bending tests are more representative of the behaviour of the material during many industrial metal forming processes, several authors have recently proposed bending machines for such applications. This paper is devoted to the presentation of an original pure bending machine developed at LMT-Cachan (patent pending 2002). The machine architecture and kinematics is presented. It enables to bend specimens up to 90 ° (i. e. 13 % strain at the surface of a 1 mm thick and 6 mm long specimen). The bending moment is simultaneously applied to two identical specimens so that no spurious "normal" and "shear" loads are applied to the specimens as experimentally verified through the measurement of moments in different points of the machine. Strain fields can be obtained directly from strain gauges glued on the specimens or from the motors angle and the compliance of the machine.

In addition, equi-biaxial punch tests are performed. The surface strain fields are measured using two- and three-dimensional digital image correlation. Due to the localization of plastic deformation during the testing of the tensile specimens, finite element simulations are performed of each test to obtain the stress and strain histories at the material point where fracture initiates. Error estimates are made based on {{the differences between the}} predicted and measured local strains. The results from the testing of tensile specimens with a central hole as well as from punch tests show that equivalent strains of more than 0. 8 can be achieved at approximately constant stress triaxialities to fracture of about 0. 3 and 0. 66, respectively. The error analysis demonstrates that both the equivalent plastic strain and the stress triaxiality are very sensitive to uncertainties in the experimental measurements and the numerical model assumptions.

40|$|The {{development}} of ductile fracture models of metals requires reliable {{measurements of the}} stress and strain histories up to the onset of fracture in multi-axial experiments. In the present work, a hybrid experimental-numerical approach is taken to determine the loading path in various fracture experiments on <b>TRIP</b> 780 steel <b>sheets.</b> In most mechanical experiments on sheet metal, the localization of plastic deformation precedes the onset of fracture. After the beginning of necking, the stress fields within the specimen gage section become non-uniform and of three dimensional nature. Consequently, the stress history prior to fracture {{can no longer be}} estimated based on the force history measurements using simple analytical formulas. A detailed finite element analysis of each experiment is required to identify the local stress and strain fields. The results of the hybrid experimental-numerical analysis of a fracture experiment depend strongly on the chosen constitutive model. Here, an extensive bi-axial experimental program comprising more than 20 distinct loading conditions is performed to characterize the monotonic large deformation behavior of the TRIP 780 steel. It is found that an anisotropic quadratic yield function along with a non-associated flow rule can accurately describe the inelastic behavior of the TRIP material. (cont.) A first series of fracture experiments is carried out on three types of full-thickness fracture specimens. This experimental program characterizes the onset of fracture for stress states between uniaxial tension and equi-biaxial tension. An effort is made to quantify and minimize the errors affecting the hybrid experimental-numerical analysis of those experiments. Inaccuracies affecting the stress triaxiality and plastic strain histories to fracture are evaluated by comparing surface strains measured by Digital Image Correlation (DIC) and computed by Finite Element Analysis (FEA). A second series of fracture experiments is carried out on a newly designed butterfly-shaped specimen, which allows for multi-axial testing under combinations of normal and tangential loads. Experiments for four different loading conditions are performed and used to analyze the onset of fracture for stress states ranging from pure shear to transverse plane strain tension. by Matthieu DunandThesis (S.

40|$|The goal of {{the study}} {{consolidated}} in this thesis is to understand the mechanics in steels using microscopy. In particular, the mechanical response of Transformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) steels is correlated with their microstructures. Chapter 1 introduces {{the current state of}} the art of TRIP steels, highlighting the importance of microstructure - mechanical properties - applications relationships. In Chapter 2 the material properties and material processing are described into more detail, and an overview is presented of the characterization techniques used in this thesis. For the purpose of understanding the structure-property relationships, two TRIP steels (Al alloyed TRIP 700 and Si alloyed TRIP 800) and one TRIP assisted Multi Phase or TAMP (Nb microalloyed TAMP 800) steel were investigated in this study. The numbers (700, 800) designate the ultimate tensile strength of the materials. Despite the fact that steels are amongst the most extensively investigated materials, many features of the austenite-martensite transformation process during deformation remain unclarified to date. Deformation induced transformation behavior of retained austenite grains is assessed in Chapter 3 with the help of Electron Back Scattered Diffraction (EBSD) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) techniques. The transformation tendency of retained austenite grains at the surface and inside the bulk as a result of uni-axial tension was investigated on <b>TRIP</b> 800 steel <b>sheets.</b> The experiments showed that the retained austenite grains at the surface have a stronger tendency to transform than the retained austenite grains in the bulk of the material. Local defects, such as twins, lower the stability of austenite grains and thus transform at the earlier stages of the deformation process. Austenite grains positioned at grain boundaries between multiple ferrite grains were amongst the first to transform, whereas austenite grains that are completely embedded in larger ferrite grains were often found to undergo rotations. These differences in strain-induced behavior are likely associated with different stress states and grain rotation capabilities of the austenite grains upon deformation. The rotation angles of embedded austenite grains were found to depend on the crystallographic orientation of the grains with respect to the straining direction. A lowering of Schmid factors of embedded austenite grains is seen to be the reason for the delayed transformation of these grains during the deformation process. The current findings suggest that grain rotation is an additional mechanism contributing to the high ductility of these steels and may be as important as the contribution of the austenite–martensite transformation. Furthermore, EBSD experiments were carried out on TRIP 700 steels which confirmed that the grain rotation behavior is consistent in both TRIP steels. In addition to the austenite-to-martensite phase transformation, the role of alloying elements such as C, Mn, Si, and Al, and their effect on transformations during deformation, are poorly understood and there is an increasing need to gain fundamental insight into this topic. Consequently, in Chapter 4, a combination of Electron Back Scattered Diffraction (EBSD) and high-sensitivity Electron Probe Microanalysis (EPMA) was used to correlate the changes in microstructural features of metastable austenite grains upon deformation along with their respective local chemical compositions in TRIP 700 and TRIP 800 steels. In contrast to current metallurgical beliefs, we found direct evidence that austenite grains with higher Mn content transformed earlier than the grains with lower Mn contents. Various microstructural factors such as the local carbon concentrations, grain size, morphology, crystal lattice orientation in relation to strain direction, location of the grain in relation to its surrounding grains, and the presence of local defects (twins) were investigated. Analysis performed on several twinned austenite grains showed higher enrichment of Mn contents and an early transformation during deformation. At a very local scale, the austenite grains with high Mn contents have an inhomogeneous Mn distribution which can result in local strain acting as a trigger for early transformation. The local variation in manganese content therefore allows for an overall gradual transformation of the retained austenite grains, providing another tunable parameter for deformation induced austenite-to-martensite transformation. Multiphase steels designed with composite strengthening may be further strengthened by grain refinement or precipitation by the addition of microalloying elements. In Chapter 5 we have therefore investigated microstructures and precipitates in a Nb microalloyed TRIP assissted multiphase (TAMP) steel containing ferrite, bainite, martensite and retained austenite. Precipitates were observed in the ferrite, martensite and bainite phases, but not in the austenite phase. Two kinds of precipitates were found in this steel: NbC and novel (Nb,Ti) N phases. The (Nb,Ti) N precipitates were found in different sizes, ranging from 10 - 150 nm, whereby the larger precipitates have a Ti/Nb atomic ratio of approximately 2. 83 - 0. 81 and were faceted in shape. Smaller NbC precipitates were found in a size range of 5 - 20 nm. The (Nb,Ti) N precipitates have a well-defined Nishiyama Wasserman (N-W) orientation relationship with the ferrite matrix, while the NbC precipitates have random orientations. Both NbC and (Nb,Ti) N carbide precipitates are expected to take part in strengthening of these steels. The comparison of calculated lattice parameters and experimental lattice parameters indicates that both precipitates are deficient in carbon and nitrogen contents. In Chapter 6 the investigations on nano-sized precipitates in Al alloyed TRIP 700 steel with Ti micro additions are described. Two types of Ti(N) precipitates were observed with cubic and faceted morphologies. The faceted precipitates were found in a size range of 40 - 70 nm and the cubic precipitates in a size range of 70 - 120 nm. The cubic precipitates had higher nitrogen concentrations and exhibited slightly larger lattice parameters than the faceted TiN precipitates. Additionally, spherical shaped Ti 2 CS precipitates were found with sizes ranging from 20 to 100 nm. Both the cubic and faceted Ti(N) precipitates and Ti 2 CS precipitates were found in random orientations with respect to the ferrite matrix. A novel iron carbide precipitate was observed in all ferrite grains. These Fe(C) precipitates have sizes ranging from 2 to 5 nm and exhibited disc-shaped morphologies. All the Fe(C) precipitates showed a well-defined Pitsch Schrader (P-S) orientation relationship with the ferrite matrix. From the precipitate size, inter-particle spacing, and lattice misfit calculations, the newly observed Fe(C) precipitates are considered to possess significant potential in enhancing the strength of these steels. Electron microscopy experiments were also carried out on Si alloyed TRIP 800 steels which confirmed that ultrafine Fe(C) precipitates exist in both TRIP counterparts. The elements Chromium (Cr) and Manganese (Mn) are well known in technologically important iron and steel alloys. In Chapter 7 it is revealed for the first time that Cr and Mn have combined to form two novel ternary carbides. These novel ternary carbide phases were identified in TRIP-assisted multi phase (TAMP) steel. The carbides were characterized using transmission electron microscopy (TEM), electron diffraction and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Electron diffraction analysis revealed that the Orthorhombic carbide has lattice parameters a = 5. 09 Å, b = 6. 98 Å, and c = 4. 55 Å, with a Pnma space group, while the Monoclinic carbide has lattice parameters a = 6. 83 Å, b = 4. 54 Å, c = 5. 00 Å, and ? = 92. 2 ° with a P 21 /c space group. Excellent agreement was found between calculation and experiment on the lattice parameters and relative atomic positions. Remarkable Mn-Cr alloying leads to these ternary phases having high thermodynamic stabilities. The calculations have shown that introduction of carbon atoms strongly induce magnetism within these structures and that these carbides are stable also at higher pressures.
