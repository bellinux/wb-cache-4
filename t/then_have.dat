5|$|Aspects of Scouting {{practice}} {{have been}} criticized as too militaristic. Military-style uniforms, badges of rank, flag ceremonies, and brass bands were commonly accepted {{in the early years}} because they were a part of normal society, but since <b>then</b> <b>have</b> diminished or been abandoned in both Scouting and society.|$|E
5|$|At {{the western}} end of Highway3, two major traffic {{concerns}} have been the focus of controversy since the mid-1990s and early 2000s: the Essex Bypass and the approach to the Ambassador Bridge. Numerous attempts by local and provincial politicians since <b>then</b> <b>have</b> led the MTO to begin remedying the situation by upgrading the bypass to a divided four lane road and constructing the Windsor–Essex Parkway to a new international crossing.|$|E
5|$|Finally, two special transformations {{are used}} to invert the {{coordinate}} system in space, space inversion, and in time, time reversal. In the first case, the space coordinate axes are reversed. The latter is reversal of the time direction. This is thought of, in the passive view, as having the observer set their clock at minus what it shows and <b>then</b> <b>have</b> the clock's hands move counterclockwise. Physical time progresses forward.|$|E

5|$|In 1586 Robert {{was educated}} at Gloucester Hall in Oxford, a college {{noted for its}} Catholic intake. Those either {{studying}} at university or wishing to take public office could not do so without first swearing the Oath of Supremacy, an act which would have compromised Catesby's Catholic faith. Presumably to avoid this consequence, he left without taking his degree, and may <b>then</b> <b>have</b> attended the seminary college of Douai.|$|E
5|$|In July 2004 the ACC began {{deliberations}} {{about which}} bid to accept. On August 19, 2004, league officials announced that Jacksonville would host {{the game in}} 2005 and 2006. The league would <b>then</b> <b>have</b> the option to re-select Jacksonville for an additional one or two-year contract. Charlotte was the first runner-up in the competition.|$|E
5|$|Insects {{are mostly}} soft bodied, fragile and almost defenseless {{compared}} to other, larger lifeforms. The immature stages are small, move slowly or are immobile, {{and so all}} stages are exposed to predation and parasitism. Insects <b>then</b> <b>have</b> a variety of defense strategies to avoid being attacked by predators or parasitoids. These include camouflage, mimicry, toxicity and active defense.|$|E
50|$|At Copacabana Beach, {{teams would}} vote for the U-Turn. They <b>then</b> <b>had</b> {{to look for a}} sand {{sculpture}} of sunbathers with an arrow pointing them towards their next clue.

5|$|Internationally, the People’s Republic of China was {{identified}} as a possible export customer. Russia's state weapons exporter, Rosoboronexport, was previously negotiating an order of 50 aircraft totalling US$2.5 billion. China would have initially acquired two aircraft worth $100million for testing and <b>then</b> <b>have</b> further options to acquire an additional 12–48 aircraft. The fighters were intended to be used with the fledgling Chinese aircraft carrier programme, with the former Soviet carrier Varyag as the centrepiece.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Leonard, Raj, and Howard {{attempt to}} solve their Comic-Con problem by {{illegally}} buying scalped tickets.

When the scalper is heard arriving, they quickly turn off the lights and stay silent.|$|E
5|$|Models of how Siletzia formed are of {{two general}} types: (1) Formation well {{offshore}} (possibly as seamounts, like the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain, or a hotspot at a spreading ridge, like Iceland) and then accretion to the continent; (2) formation inshore, {{on or near}} the continental margin (perhaps as a result of transcurrent extension, or of a slab window). All current models <b>then</b> <b>have</b> Siletzia rifting away from the continental edge about a northern pivot.|$|E

5|$|Some coins from Offa's reign {{bear the}} names of the archbishops of Canterbury, Jaenberht and, after 792, Æthelheard. Jaenberht's coins all belong to the light coinage, rather than the later medium coinage. There is also {{evidence}} that coins were issued by Eadberht, who was Bishop of London in the 780s and possibly before. Offa's dispute with Jaenberht may have led him to allow Eadberht coining rights, which may <b>then</b> <b>have</b> been revoked when the see of Lichfield was elevated to an archbishopric.|$|E
5|$|The Gemini {{spacecraft}} {{would have}} rendezvoused with stacked Centaur and Agena upper stages in low Earth orbit. The Centaur would have placed the Gemini and Agena onto a circumlunar trajectory, along {{which they would}} coast {{until they reached the}} Moon. The Agena would <b>then</b> <b>have</b> been used to perform Lunar orbit insertion. Following the completion of activities in Lunar orbit, the Agena would have been fired again for trans-Earth injection.|$|E

5|$|The {{method of}} {{embalming}} used by White is unrecorded, but in 1748 {{he had studied}} under the anatomist William Hunter, who had developed an early system of arterial embalming, therefore {{it is likely that}} White used the same method. The veins and arteries would have been injected with a mixture of turpentine and vermilion, after which the organs would have been removed from the chest and abdomen and placed in water, to clean them and to reduce their bulk. As much blood as possible would <b>then</b> <b>have</b> been squeezed out of the corpse, and the whole body washed with alcohol. The next stage would have been to replace the organs and to repeat the injection of turpentine and vermilion. The body cavities would <b>then</b> <b>have</b> been filled with a mixture of camphor, nitre and resin, before the body was sewn up and all openings filled with camphor. After a final washing, the body would have been packed into a box containing plaster of Paris, to absorb any moisture, and then probably coated with tar, to preserve it.|$|E
5|$|The plan works, in a way—Dallas can't resist {{insulting}} Hunsecker's methods, and, {{forced to}} choose between them, the timid Susan breaks up with Dallas in order to protect him from her brother. Hunsecker, however, is enraged by Dallas's insults to him after a brief confrontation. He decides to ruin the boy after all (against Falco's advice) and wants to have marijuana planted on the musician, <b>then</b> <b>have</b> him arrested and roughed up by corrupt police Lt.

5|$|With {{the advent}} of phylogenetic {{taxonomy}} in vertebrate paleontology, Tyrannosauridae has been given several explicit definitions. The original was produced by Paul Sereno in 1998, and included all tyrannosauroids closer to Tyrannosaurus than to either Alectrosaurus, Aublysodon or Nanotyrannus. However, Nanotyrannus is often {{considered to be a}} juvenile Tyrannosaurus rex, while Aublysodon is usually regarded as a nomen dubium unsuitable for use in the definition of a clade. Definitions since <b>then</b> <b>have</b> been based on more well-established genera.|$|E
5|$|A One Day International (ODI) is an {{international}} cricket match between two teams, each having ODI status, {{as determined by the}} International Cricket Council. The women's variant of the game is similar to the men's version, with minor modifications to umpiring and pitch requirements. The first women's ODI was played in 1973, between England and Australia. Due to the sporting boycott placed upon their country, South Africa women did not contest their first ODI until August 1997, playing Ireland in Belfast. Later that year, South Africa entered the Women's Cricket World Cup for the first time, and were eliminated in the quarter-finals. They went one better in 2000, reaching the semi-finals, but since <b>then</b> <b>have</b> finished seventh twice (2005 and 2009) and sixth (2013), before reaching the semi-finals once more in 2017. They were required to compete in a qualifying series to confirm their place in the 2009 (World Cup 2009 qualifier) and 2013 (World Cup 2013 qualifier) tournaments.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the tally}} of Cardinal Charles de Lorraine-Guise {{in his letter}} to Henry II, once the twelve {{participating}} French cardinals reached Rome, twenty-three cardinals were aligned in the French faction, twenty-two in the Imperial faction, and four neutral; thus Guise judged it impossible for either faction to garner the necessary two-thirds simply by persuading neutral cardinals. In addition, eleven Italian cardinals whom Guise counted among the French faction were only likely to vote for a fellow Italian, making the three favorites of Henry IILouis de Bourbon de Vendôme, Jean de Lorraine, and Georges d'Amboiseunfeasible. The non-French cardinal protector of France, d'Este, would <b>then</b> <b>have</b> been the choice of Henry II; Catherine de' Medici preferred her cousin Giovanni Salviati, who was extremely unacceptable to the Imperial faction and the Farnese.|$|E
