We assimilate the protectionist policy to the import ban of the rival products of the protected sector. We demonstrate while if the economy of the country of the South possesses two sectors (a protected sector and a not protected sector), the liberalization of the not protected sector will entail rates <b>of</b> <b>salary</b> more raised in this sector. It goes, at first, entail a migration interns of the sector protected towards the not protected sector. As consequence, the cost of international migration falls. if the rate <b>of</b> internal <b>salary</b> is weaker than the rate <b>of</b> <b>salary</b> expected from the international migration, the population, the rate <b>of</b> <b>salary</b> <b>of</b> which is weak, will be incited to emigrate. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{explores the}} role <b>of</b> <b>salary</b> raises and the {{perception}} of employees <b>of</b> these <b>salary</b> raises on employees' intended retention and turnover. By using a unique survey data set from an American university, this study investigates a novel hypothesis that faculty perceptions <b>of</b> <b>salary</b> raises, relative to their perceptions of other faculty members' assessments of the raises, influences their labor supply. Using both Ordered Probit and OLS modelling frameworks, we focus on the impact <b>of</b> <b>salary</b> raises and the relative perception of these raises on intended labor supply behavior. We explore a hypothesis that a mismatch between one's ranking <b>of</b> the <b>salary</b> raise {{and the perception}} of others' rankings causes dissatisfaction. Our results provide evidence that salary raises themselves are effective monetary tools to reduce turnover; however, our results also suggest that relative deprivation as a comparison of one's own perceptions <b>of</b> a <b>salary</b> raise with others affects employee retention. We find that employees who have less favorable perceptions <b>of</b> <b>salary</b> adjustments, compared to what they believe their colleagues think, are more likely to seek another employer, holding their own perception of raises constant. Conversely, more favorable views <b>of</b> <b>salary</b> raises, compared to how faculty members think other's perceived the salary raises, does not have a statistically significant impact on retention. Our results indicate that monetary rewards in the form <b>of</b> <b>salary</b> raises do impact employee retention; however, perception of fairness <b>of</b> these <b>salary</b> raises is also as important as the actual raises. Given the high cost of job turnover, these findings suggest that employers would benefit from devoting resources toward ensuring that salary- and raise-determining procedures are generally perceived by the vast majority of employees as being fair. This is the first study that explores the employee satisfaction with salary raises relative to perceptions of other employees' satisfaction with salary raises, and intended labor supply in an American university...|$|R
