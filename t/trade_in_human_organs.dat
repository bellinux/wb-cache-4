The study examines dignity through an analysis of the term and how it is defined in four selected historical periods and its significance {{in the context of a}} regulated market <b>in</b> <b>human</b> <b>organs.</b> It is hereby concluded that it is somewhat impossible to provide a precise definition of dignity in modern society; hence it cannot be used in the discussion of whether a regulated market <b>in</b> <b>human</b> <b>organs</b> is morally permissible. Through an analysis and discussion of the aforementioned philosophers’ arguments, it is concluded that Taylor argues that a regulated market <b>in</b> <b>human</b> <b>organs</b> ought to be legalized. It is noted that Sandel does not explicitly discuss this particular subject, but instead focuses on the immoral factors of market transactions in general. It is therefore concluded that he would also find a regulated market <b>in</b> <b>human</b> <b>organs</b> to be immoral. The study finally concludes that the arguments given by Sandel are not reasonable and thus cannot be accepted in the review of whether or not a regulated market <b>in</b> <b>human</b> <b>organs</b> should be legalized. In contrast to this it is found that the arguments given by Taylor have defeated the challenges thrown at them.

40|$|The in situ {{control of}} redox insult <b>in</b> <b>human</b> <b>organs</b> is of major {{clinical}} relevance, yet remains incompletely understood.

We have therefore explored the role of Nrf 2 in a uniquely accessible <b>human</b> (mini-) <b>organ,</b> <b>human</b> scalp hair follicles (HFs).

Nrf 2 pre-activation reduced oxidative stress-stimulated (H 2 O 2 or menadione) premature catagen and hair growth inhibition, significantly ameliorated the H 2 O 2 -dependent increase in matrix keratinocyte apoptosis and reversed the ROS-induced reduction in proliferation.
