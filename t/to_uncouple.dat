When an obstruction is encountered the spring release mechanism in the hitch permits the plow <b>to</b> <b>uncouple</b> from the tractor.

A {{comprehensive}} 'origin of sex as vaccination' theory proposes that eukaryan sex-as-syngamy (fusion sex) arose from prokaryan unilateral sex-as-infection when infected hosts began swapping nuclearised genomes containing coevolved, vertically transmitted symbionts that provided protection against horizontal superinfection by more virulent symbionts. Sex-as-meiosis (fission sex) then evolved as a host strategy <b>to</b> <b>uncouple</b> (and thereby emasculate) the acquired symbiont genomes.|$|E

40|$|The time-course for the {{induction}} of the uncoupling pathway {{in the inner}} membrane of brown-fat mitochondria from cold-adapting guinea pigs was studied. The amount of the protein was quantified from the capacity for high-affinity binding of GDP to the intact mitochondria, and was compared with the functional parameters diagnostic of the protein, namely the nucleotide-sensitive proton conductance and the sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>uncoupling</b> by low concentrations of fatty acids. A monophasic increase in nucleotide titre was observed, with no evidence of an early 'unmasking' of preexisting nucleotide-binding sites. The nucleotide-sensitive conductance increased in precise synchrony with the nucleotide-binding capacity. Mitochondria from newborn animals, and those from acutely cold-adapted animals, showed anomalously low sensitivities <b>to</b> <b>uncoupling</b> by fatty acids...|$|R
40|$|AbstractP-type ATPases couple scalar and {{vectorial}} events under optimized states. A {{number of}} procedures and conditions lead <b>to</b> <b>uncoupling</b> or slippage. A key branching {{point in the}} catalytic cycle is at the cation-bound form of E 1 -P, where isomerization to E 2 -P leads to coupled transport, and hydrolysis leads <b>to</b> <b>uncoupled</b> release of cations to the cis membrane surface. The phenomenon of slippage supports a channel model for active transport. Ability to occlude cations within the channel is essential for coupling. Uncoupling and slippage appear to be inherent properties of P-type cation pumps, and are significant contributors to standard metabolic rate. Heat production is favored in the uncoupled state. A number of disease conditions, include ageing, ischemia and cardiac failure, result in uncoupling of either the Ca 2 +-ATPase or Na+/K+-ATPase...|$|R

40|$|To {{demonstrate}} {{the relationship between}} Amazonian vegetation and surface water dynamics, specifically, the recycling of water via evapotranspiration (ET), we compare two general circulation model experiments; one that couples the IS 92 a scenario of future CO 2 emissions to a land-surface scheme with dynamic vegetation (coupled) and the other <b>to</b> fixed vegetation (<b>uncoupled).</b> Because {{the only difference between}} simulations involves vegetation coupling, any alterations to surface energy and water balance must be due to vegetation feedbacks. The proportion of water recycled back to the atmosphere is relatively conserved through time for both experiments. Absolute value of recycled water is lower in our coupled relative <b>to</b> our <b>uncoupled</b> simulation as a result of increasing atmospheric CO 2 that in turn promotes lowering of stomatal conductance and increase in water-use efficiency. Bowen ratio increases with decreasing per cent broadleaf cover, with the greatest rate of change occurring at high vegetation cover (above 70 % broadleaf cover). Over the duration of the climate change simulation, precipitation is reduced by an extra 30 % in the coupled relative <b>to</b> the <b>uncoupled</b> simulations.
