40|$|Part I {{proposes a}} numeraire-invariant option pricing framework. It defines an option, its price process, and such notions as option indistinguishability and equivalence, domination, payoff process, <b>trigger</b> <b>option,</b> and semipositive option. It {{develops}} {{some of their}} basic properties, including price transitivity law, indistinguishability results, convergence results, and, in relation to nonnegative arbitrage, characterizations of semipositivity and consequences thereof. These are applied in Part II to study the Snell envelop and american options. The measurability and right-continuity of the former is established in general. The american option is then defined, and its pricing formula (for all times) is presented. Applying a concept of a domineering numeraire for superclaims derived from (the additive) Doob-Meyer decomposition, minimax duality formulae are given which resemble though differ from those in [R] and [H-K]. Multiplicative Doob-Meyer decomposition is discussed last. A part III is also envisaged. Option, Snell envelope, stooping time, martingale, Doob-Meyer Decomposition, price process...|$|E

40|$|The {{geometric}} average <b>trigger</b> reset <b>option</b> resets the strike price {{based on the}} {{geometric average}} of the underlying asset's prices over a monitoring window. Similar contracts have been traded on exchanges in Asia. This paper derives an analytic formula for pricing this option with multiple monitoring windows. The analytic formula in fact is a corollary of a general formula that holds for a large class of path-dependent options: It prices any option whose value can be written as a linear combination of �[image omitted], where X is a multinormal random vector and b is some constant vector. Numerical experiments suggest that the pricing formula approximates the values of arithmetic average <b>trigger</b> reset <b>options</b> accurately. Thus pricing the arithmetic average <b>trigger</b> reset <b>option</b> can benefit from using this formula as the control variate in Monte Carlo simulation. Numerical results also suggest that the geometric average <b>trigger</b> reset <b>option</b> does not have significant delta jump as the standard reset option, and this useful property reduces the hedging risk dramatically. ...|$|R

50|$|Lower Receiver: When the SPR {{program was}} still just an upper {{receiver}} assembly (and {{not a complete}} rifle), Crane assembled all of its prototypes using either M16A1 or M4A1 lower receivers, because the full auto trigger group in these lower receivers provided a consistent pull while the more common 3-round burst trigger groups didn't. It is unknown whether this pattern continued as the rifle evolved. There is also some issue about whether, when the Navy type-classified the weapon, Precision Reflex Incorporated (PRI) began assembling the rifles themselves.

To explain such choices, this paper introduces the MOTIVATOR (Matching Objects To Internal VAlues <b>Triggers</b> <b>Option</b> Revaluations) neural model. MOTIVATOR describes cognitiveemotional interactions between higher-order sensory cortices and an evaluative neuraxis composed of the hypothalamus, amygdala, and orbitofrontal cortex. Given a conditioned stimulus (CS), the model amygdala and lateral hypothalamus interact to calculate the expected current value of the subjective outcome that the CS predicts, constrained by {{the current state of}} deprivation or satiation. The amygdala relays the expected value information to orbitofrontal cells that receive inputs from anterior inferotemporal cells, and medial orbitofrontal cells that receive inputs from rhinal cortex. The activations of these orbitofrontal cells code the subjective values of objects. These values guide behavioral choices.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a 32 -channel digital output module, {{and the development}} of the hardware and software design. The microprocessor-based design allows versatility in output control in response to CAMAC commands. The unit may be tailored to different specific applications by modification of the internal applications software. CAMAC commands, which may be stacked for serial micro-processing, allow outputs to be selectively DC or pulse controlled, and to control other outputs at the start or end of a pulsed output. output pulse width may be pre-defined, or set within a range of values. Various outputs may be responding to any of the above commands concurrently. outputs to be pulsed (on or off) may be preset with width and <b>trigger</b> <b>options,</b> with execution deferred. Action may be later initiated on a set of channels using a selective pulse command to initiate execution of the preset sequences. The unit is a single width CAMAC module. Intended for general use as an equipment controller, each output is rated for switching loads of up to 75 volts and 100 milliamperes. DEVELOPMENT The Isolated Digital Output Module (IDOM) is a microprocessor-based CAMAC module. The IDOM was designed for use by the Stanford Linear Collider project (SLC) at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). The ability to preload and then initiate the execution of a sequence of variable width output pulses, makes this module useful as a process control sequencer. The outputs are arranged in two groups of sixteen, each group being brought out from the module through a 36 -pin front panel connector (see Figure 1) ...|$|R

40|$|The Antarctic Ross Ice shelf ANtenna Neutrino Array (ARIANNA) {{particle}} physics experiment aims to detect ultra-high energy neutrinos originating outside our solar system. A second generation detector prototype for the experiment {{has been developed}} and successfully deployed in Antarctica. The second generation detector {{is based on the}} Synchronous Sampling and Triggering (SST) integrated circuit. This dissertation focuses on the design and performance of the SST chip. Fabricated in a 0. 25 um CMOS process, the SST is a low power data acquisition circuit that monitors for potential neutrino signals and preserves candidate signals. The waveform capture is performed with a 256 -cell time-interleaved sampling array. Continuous sampling operation is achieved through circular cycling across the array. The synchronous sampling clock generation allows for sampling rates that span six orders of magnitude (i. e. ranging between 2. 0 KHz and 2. 0 GHz). The analog bandwidth (- 3 dB frequency) of the SST reaches 1. 5 GHz, allowing for the capture of frequency components up to the Nyquist frequency. The SST integrates four channels of waveform capture functionality into a single chip. Each SST channel includes event triggering to initiate the signal capture of neutrino events, and to reject random noise signals. Events are triggered based on outputs from a pair of high speed comparators that monitor for bipolar threshold crossings. Multiple <b>triggering</b> <b>options</b> are available on the SST, including direct output of the comparator signals and triggering on dual threshold crossings occurring within a programmable time window. The SST chip utilizes an external low jitter LVDS oscillator to synchronously generate an internal sampling clock with low timing jitter. The fixed pattern timing noise was characterized through two different approaches: a stochastic zero crossing method and a Monte Carlo based simulated annealing method. After calibrating for fixed pattern timing noise, the SST achieves inter channel timing resolutions between 1. 15 ps (RMS) and 2. 36 ps (RMS) ...|$|R
