50|$|<b>Tar</b> <b>paper</b> is a {{heavy-duty}} paper used in construction. <b>Tar</b> <b>paper</b> {{is made by}} impregnating paper or fiberglass mat with tar, producing a waterproof material useful for roof construction. <b>Tar</b> <b>paper</b> is distinguished from roofing felt which is impregnated with asphalt instead of tar; but these two products are used the same way, and their names sometimes are used informally as synonyms.|$|R

5000|$|A Toynbee-tile enthusiast website {{reported}} a tile found in Pittsburgh that included deployment instructions, which the reader transcribed as [...] "linoleum, asphalt glue (?) in several layers, then placing <b>tar</b> <b>paper</b> over {{it so that}} car wheels won't mess it up, and apparently {{the heat of the}} sun on the <b>tar</b> <b>paper</b> will bake it into the street". This tile was located near the Pittsburgh Hilton, and has since been paved over.|$|R

This new tile was wrapped in <b>tar</b> <b>paper</b> and placed on a busy street early in the morning. From this find and other evidence, Duerr believes that the pressure exerted by automobiles driving over the tile for weeks on end pushes the tile into the road surface. Eventually, the <b>tar</b> <b>paper</b> wears away, exposing the message.|$|R

However, {{in the course of}} {{measures}} taken by the Cathedral chapter {{for the protection of the}} precious artefacts of the Cathedral and its treasury against the bombing and fire-fighting water in the Second World War, it was covered with <b>tar</b> <b>paper</b> and buried in sand. Today there are dirty yellow stains on the throne from the <b>tar</b> <b>paper,</b> which have not been removed for fear of damaging the ancient graffiti on the throne.|$|R

5000|$|Older {{construction}} {{sometimes used}} a lighter-weight <b>tar</b> <b>paper,</b> stapled {{up with some}} overlap, as a water- and wind-proofing material on walls, but modern carpenters more often uses 8 or 10 ft widths of [...] "housewrap".|$|R
50|$|Building {{papers and}} {{membranes}} {{are used for}} many reasons in construction. One of the oldest building papers is red rosin paper which {{was known to be}} in use before 1850 and was used as an underlayment in exterior walls, roofs, and floors and for protecting a jobsite during construction. <b>Tar</b> <b>paper</b> was invented late in the 19th century and was used for similar purposes as rosin paper and for gravel roofs. <b>Tar</b> <b>paper</b> has largely fallen out of use supplanted by asphalt felt paper. Felt paper has been supplanted in some uses by synthetic underlayments, particularly in roofing by synthetic underlayments and siding by housewraps.|$|R
5000|$|The Jim Scott Fishhouse {{stands on}} the {{waterfront}} of Grand Marais Harber. It is a rectangular, wood-frame building with a footprint of about 30 by 25 ft. A wood-frame shed addition measuring 10 by 25 ft {{is attached to the}} north wall. The south wall is pierced by a wooden door. The main section has a gable roof covered in <b>tar</b> <b>paper,</b> while the shed has <b>tar</b> <b>paper</b> walls and a metal roof. [...] The building was comparable in size to other fishhouses in the region, but the wood shingled exterior walls of the main section add a decorative flair lacking in similar structures, which were usually sided with plain boards.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Tar</b> <b>paper</b> is {{far less}} common than asphalt felt paper and is used, among other things, for {{waterproofing}} roofs to prevent ingress of moisture. It is used in {{a small percentage of}} built-up roofs (BUR), as underlayment with asphalt, wood, shake, and other shingles, or even gravel, since <b>tar</b> <b>paper</b> itself isn't particularly wind- or sun-resistant. It is sold in rolls of various widths, lengths, and thicknesses - 3 ft rolls, 50 or 100 ft long and [...] "15 lb" [...] (15 lb) and [...] "30 lb" [...] (30 lb) weights are common in the U.S. - often marked with chalk lines at certain intervals to aid in laying it out straight on roofs with the proper overlap (more overlap for flatter roofs).|$|R

50|$|A worm shoe is a {{strip of}} wood such as oak or pine which is fixed to the keel of a wooden boat {{to protect it from}} shipworms.

50|$|For bitumen-based roof {{coverings}} maintenance {{also includes}} keeping the <b>tar</b> <b>paper</b> covered with gravel, an older method, currently being replaced with bituminous roofing membranes and the like, {{which must be}} 'glued' in place so wind and waves do not move it causing scouring and more bare spots. The glue can be any exterior grade glue like driveway coating.|$|R
50|$|Underlay is {{also the}} term for the {{material}} under roofing tiles; this roofing membrane is often made of rubber and is used to seal the roof and prevent leakage. Underlayment used with roofing shingles provides a second layer of water proofing to prevent leaks and is called <b>tar</b> <b>paper,</b> roofing felt, or since the 1990s synthetic underlayment.|$|R

Carefully manipulating oil paint with his fingers and tools, like sticks, leaves, combs, cardboard, burlap, <b>tar</b> <b>paper,</b> and crumpled paper, Von Bruenchenhein established his own distinct process.|$|R
