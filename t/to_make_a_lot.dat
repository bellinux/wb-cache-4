The writers also praised Lowe, who they felt was able <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of a comparatively small part.

500|$|The costume {{designer}} for Sense and Sensibility was Michele Clapton. She and assistant {{costume designer}} Alex Fordham undertook {{a large amount}} of research looking for inspiration. They spent hours looking at paintings and books from the time period, while also visiting art galleries and the Victoria and Albert Museum. During an interview for the drama's BBC Online website, Fordham revealed that they tried to find references from every area, including eighteenth-century cartoons. Clapton stated that the team wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of the costumes, rather than re-use what was already available from other productions. To get the sense of colour that they wanted, they had to dye and create a lot of the pieces. The wardrobe team worked closely with the make-up department and the production designer. After their first meeting, they came up with a colour palette for the whole show. Clapton chose to give Elinor and Marianne contrasting wardrobes. The [...] "flighty" [...] and [...] "artistic" [...] Marianne wears strong colours compared to Elinor, who has a different personality and complexion. Fordham revealed that with Marianne being younger and a [...] "wild child", her wardrobe contains a lot of Buttercup yellows, which suited Wakefield's complexion and her character's freshness.|$|E
500|$|Ghost of Sparta was {{announced}} on May 4, 2010, on PlayStation.Blog. According to Sony, Ready at Dawn utilized [...] "state-of-the-art visual technologies" [...] that allowed [...] "higher quality environments and characters." [...] Ghost of Sparta offers [...] "over 25% more gameplay" [...] than Chains of Olympus, while adding more enemies on screen and more boss encounters. Development of Ghost of Sparta took 23 months to complete. Due to Weerasuriya's schedule at Ready at Dawn, {{he could not}} return to direct; Dana Jan, the lead level designer for Chains of Olympus, became director for Ghost of Sparta. At Comic-Con 2010, Jan noted that when development began in 2008, {{the goal was to}} make the game bigger than Chains of Olympus, which had apparently pushed the PSP to its functional limits. Jan stated that Ghost of Sparta has taken the PSP to its [...] "absolute capacity", with another feature being more on-screen foes. The game concept was originally used as a teaser for players who obtained the platinum trophy from God of War III. The trophy revealed a site called spartansstandtall.com, which became the official site for Ghost of Sparta on May 4. Jan stated the reason they chose to have the game take place between God of War and God of War II was because [...] "It seemed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of sense to fill in that void." ...|$|E
500|$|Dana Jan {{stated the}} reason they chose to have the game take place between God of War and God of War II was because [...] "It seemed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of sense to fill in that void." [...] Jan said with some scenes, [...] "the team wasn't sure how gamers would react" [...] because [...] "God of War usually doesn't slow...down" [...] and the team [...] "worried if these scenes would be {{captivating}} enough to keep player interested and still feel like God of War." [...] For puzzles, Jan stated that they {{tried to make the}} outcomes unexpected because players assume that they will have to [...] "push something, carry a body or smash something with [...] blades." [...] Hinting at a possible future installment from Ready at Dawn, Jan stated that he is [...] "intrigued" [...] by the flashbacks in God of War and God of War II and that [...] "There's definitely a back story to Kratos that nobody's touched on." [...] For the character Deimos, Jan stated that the first reference was actually in the Chains of Olympus finale. In the game, Helios states [...] "Do you think that they'll survive?" [...] and Athena says [...] "They must." [...] Jan said that this line was [...] "purposefully put" [...] in that game and that there are also references to Deimos in God of War III. He confirmed that Kratos and Deimos are not twins and that while Kratos' father is Zeus, [...] "Deimos' father is more of a mystery." [...] He confirmed that a character named Dominus appears in the game (Kratos' original name) and [...] "the scene featuring a soldier named Dominus was a nod to that." [...] He also stated that he does not know where God of War: Betrayal fits chronologically in the series.|$|E
