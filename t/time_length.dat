5|$|Other {{rationales}} {{for the failure}} of the forward rate unbiasedness hypothesis include considering the conditional bias to be an exogenous variable explained by a policy aimed at smoothing interest rates and stabilizing exchange rates, or considering that an economy allowing for discrete changes could facilitate excess returns in the forward market. Some researchers have contested empirical failures of the hypothesis and have sought to explain conflicting evidence as resulting from contaminated data and even inappropriate selections of the <b>time</b> <b>length</b> of forward contracts. Economists demonstrated that the forward rate could serve as a useful proxy for future spot exchange rates between currencies with liquidity premia that average out to zero during the onset of floating exchange rate regimes in the 1970s. Research examining the introduction of endogenous breaks to test the structural stability of cointegrated spot and forward exchange rate time series have found some evidence to support forward rate unbiasedness in both the short and long term.|$|E

The timestep must be chosen small enough to avoid discretization errors (i.e., smaller than the fastest vibrational frequency in the system). Typical timesteps for classical MD are in the order of 1femtosecond (10−15 s). This value may be extended by using algorithms such as the SHAKE constraint algorithm, which fix the vibrations of the fastest atoms (e.g., hydrogens) into place. Multiple time scale methods have also been developed, which allow extended times between updates of slower long-range forces.|$|E

25|$|Often {{in social}} life, animals {{fight for the}} right to reproduce, as well as social supremacy. A common example of {{fighting}} for social and sexual supremacy is the so-called pecking order among poultry. Every time a group of poultry cohabitate for a certain <b>time</b> <b>length,</b> they establish a pecking order. In these groups, one chicken dominates the others and can peck without being pecked. A second chicken can peck all the others except the first, and so on. Higher level chickens are easily distinguished by their well-cured aspect, as opposed to lower level chickens. While the pecking order is establishing, frequent and violent fights can happen, but once established, it is broken only when other individuals enter the group, in which case the pecking order re-establishes from scratch.|$|E

At the University, the philosopher, poet, and professor of classics Norman O. Brown befriended Cage, an association that proved fruitful to both. In 1960 the composer was appointed a Fellow on the faculty of the Center for Advanced Studies (now the Center for Humanities) in the Liberal Arts and Sciences at Wesleyan, where he started teaching classes in experimental music. In October 1961, Wesleyan University Press published Silence, a collection of Cage's lectures and writings {{on a wide variety of}} subjects, including the famous Lecture on Nothing that was composed using a complex <b>time</b> <b>length</b> scheme, much like some of Cage's music. Silence was Cage's first book. He went on to publish five more. Silence remained his most widely read and influential book. In the early 1960s Cage began his lifelong association with C.F. Peters Corporation. Walter Hinrichsen, the president of the corporation, offered Cage an exclusive contract and instigated the publication of a catalog of Cage's works, which appeared in 1962.|$|E

Comedy Central executives did {{not object to}} most of the content of the episode, but said the scene in which Kyle farted while talking to Stan should have been removed because nothing happened after the fart, and they said it was not funny. Parker and Stone, however, insisted it stay in the episode, and they said the lack of any reaction whatsoever to the fart was what made it funny. During close-ups of Cartman's face while telling the story of Scuzzlebutt around the campfire, the flames from the fire stop moving. Parker and Stone noticed the consistency error after the episode was filmed, but they did not have enough time to go back and fix it before the broadcast date, so it was left in.

40|$|With {{increasing}} computer power, process-based {{models that}} use grids to discretize space {{have become increasingly}} popular. For such models, the simulation results might depend on both grid cell size and, {{in the case of}} dynamic models, on the <b>time</b> step <b>length</b> used in the model. In this study, the dynamic Limburg soil erosion model (LISEM) was applied to a small catchment on the Chinese Loess Plateau. To study the effect of grid cell size and <b>time</b> step <b>length,</b> simulations were performed for grid cell sizes ranging from 5 to 100 m for a single <b>time</b> step <b>length,</b> and for <b>time</b> step <b>lengths</b> ranging from 2 to 120 s for a single grid cell size. The results show that the LISEM results vary considerably as a function of both grid cell size and <b>time</b> step <b>length.</b> For both increase in cell size and increasing <b>time</b> step <b>length,</b> the trend was a decrease in predicted discharge and predicted soil loss. For discharge, the most important causes are likely to be a decrease in slope with increasing grid cell size, rainfall averaging for longer <b>time</b> step <b>lengths,</b> and numerical dispersion of the kinematic wave solution. For soil loss, the cause is less clear, reflecting the complexity of soil loss prediction, which depends on available water, transport capacity and sediment redistribution, all of which change in time and space. These results show that a choice for a certain grid cell size and a certain <b>time</b> step <b>length</b> should be made before calibration of the model. Similar erosion models are likely to have similar dependencies on grid size and <b>time</b> step <b>length.</b> Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

30|$|In this approach, {{we have to}} {{consider}} the differences in <b>time</b> <b>lengths.</b> In the proposed method, new kernel functions of human motions and music pieces are introduced into the CCA-based correlation calculation. Specifically, we newly adopt two types of kernel functions, which can represent similarities by effectively using human motions or music pieces having various <b>time</b> <b>lengths,</b> for the kernel CCA-based correlation calculation. First, we define a longest common subsequence (LCSS) kernel for using data having different <b>time</b> <b>lengths.</b> Since the LCSS [14] is commonly used for motion comparison, the LCSS kernel should be suitable for our purpose. It should be noted that kernel functions must satisfy Mercer's theorem [15], but our newly defined kernel function does not necessarily satisfy this theorem. Therefore, we also adopt another type of kernel function, spectrum intersection kernel, that satisfies Mercer's theorem. This function introduces the p-spectrum [16] and is based on the histogram intersection kernel [17]. Since the histogram intersection kernel is known as a function that satisfies Mercer's theorem, the spectrum intersection kernel also satisfies this theorem.|$|R
