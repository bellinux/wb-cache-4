In October, ten of thirteen trams {{were taken out}} of service due <b>to</b> <b>radial</b> run-out. The problem was large enough that some trams got a new radial run-out the day after they were fixed. From 6 January 2001, SL95 could be used on the Grünerløkka–Torshov Line, and from 6 February, on the Ekeberg Line. However, the latter still had too short platforms.|$|E
5|$|The {{source of}} the long {{secondary}} periods is unknown, but they certainly aren't due <b>to</b> <b>radial</b> pulsations. Interferometric observations of Betelgeuse have shown hotspots that {{are thought to be}} created by massive convection cells, a significant fraction of the diameter of the star and each emitting 5–10% of the total light of the star. One theory to explain long secondary periods is that they are caused by the evolution of such cells combined with the rotation of the star. Other theories include close binary interactions, chromospheric magnetic activity influencing mass loss, or non-radial pulsations such as g-modes.|$|E

They are amyloid, meaning they will absorb iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are 35–60 by 7–13.5µm, club-shaped, four-spored, with clamps at their bases. The cheilocystidia (cystidia {{found on the}} edge of the gill) are 15–45 by 10–30µm, ellipsoid to club-shaped, and abundant. The cap cuticle is up to 165µm thick, and is made of interwoven <b>to</b> <b>radial</b> hyphae, 2.5–8µm diameter, which is slightly to strongly gelatinized. The universal veil on the cap consists of mainly roughly spherical to ellipsoid but also club-shaped and elongated cells, up to 75 by 40µm, arranged in short, terminal chains and relatively sparse hyphae, measuring 3–7.5µm in diameter. At the base of the stem the universal veil tissue is very similar to that on the cap. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae.|$|E

500|$|Due <b>to</b> <b>radial</b> outflow, low {{vertical}} wind shear, {{and water}} temperatures above 30°C, Noul started rapid deepening on May9 while approaching the Philippine island of Luzon, forming a sharply well-defined 35km (20mi) eye {{embedded in a}} deepening symmetric core; therefore, the JTWC upgraded it to a super typhoon late on the same day. At 00:00UTC on May10, the JMA estimated peak 10minute sustained winds of 205km/h (125mph). At the same time, the JTWC estimated peak 1minute sustained winds of 260km/h (160mph), equivalent to Category 5 on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. As the typhoon neared the northeast tip of Luzon, satellite imagery showed rapid deterioration of the storm's core structure and warming of the cloud tops. According to PAGASA, at around 08:45UTC on May10, Noul made landfall in the Philippines at Pananapan Point in Santa Ana, Cagayan. However, the JMA and JTWC tracks do not show landfall, but instead show the center staying offshore. After its closest approach to Luzon, the storm's structure continued to deteriorate, becoming elongated and less organized due to increasing wind shear and land interaction. By late on May10, the eye largely disappeared from satellite imagery as Noul turned northward over water, steered around the subtropical ridge. A large residual eye persisted {{in the center of}} the waning convection, although stronger wind shear increasingly disrupted the storm's structure. An approaching trough steered Noul to the northeast, bringing it east of Taiwan on May11. By early on May12, the storm had become increasingly elongated as dry air became entrained in the center, with the structure resembling a [...] "comma"-shape, according to the JTWC. The agency downgraded it to a tropical storm at 00:00UTC that day as the storm accelerated through Amami Ōshima. Six hours later, the storm became extratropical off the southern coast of Japan.|$|E

2500|$|The Subaru Rex {{represented}} {{a fresh start}} designwise, sharing little of its appearance with the Subaru 360, although they were mechanically the same and shared a rear-engine layout. The Rex also retained the 360/R-2's rear swing axle. The appearance of the new Rex {{was similar to the}} new larger platform, the Subaru Leone. The Rex originally featured the same water-cooled 356cc EK34 two-stroke engine as used in the R-2, and was available only as a two-door sedan. In February 1973 a four-door sedan was added, and a three-door [...] "Van" [...] was added in February 1974. The Van was registerable as a commercial vehicle, allowing for considerable savings in taxes and fees. The EK34 engine came with a [...] single carburetor on the Custom L, Super L, and other trim levels down to Standard, or a [...] double carburetor for the sporty GSR. The TS (Touring Sport) received a [...] iteration. The GSR was also somewhat lower than its counterparts, due <b>to</b> <b>radial</b> tires being fitted.|$|E
2500|$|The line of General Purpose (GP) Acme threads (ASME/ANSI B1.5-1997) are not {{designed}} to sustain external radial loads and both the nut and bolt are, ideally, independently supported, the nut by a linear guide and the screw by shaft bearings. This {{is due to the}} need to avoid [...] "wedging" [...] of the thread flanks when subjected <b>to</b> <b>radial</b> loads, which would contribute substantially to friction forces and thread wear. However, there is a centralizing Acme-thread standard (also specified in ASME/ANSI B1.5-1997) which caters to applications where the threads are not radially supported, where the roots and crests of opposing threads are designed to come into contact before the flanks do, under radial loads. This adds the requirement that the sum of the allowances and tolerances on the major diameters of nut and bolt be less than the sum of the allowances on the pitch diameters (PD); the drawback is that, for a given amount of end play (axial clearance, due solely to PD deviations), closer tolerances and cleaner work environment are necessitated in the application of a centralizing Acme thread.|$|E

2500|$|The {{origin of}} supermassive black holes {{remains an open}} field of research. Astrophysicists agree that once a black hole is {{in place in the}} center of a galaxy, it can grow by {{accretion}} of matter and by merging with other black holes. There are, however, several hypotheses for the formation mechanisms and initial masses of the progenitors, or [...] "seeds", of supermassive black holes. The most obvious hypothesis is that the seeds are black holes of tens or perhaps hundreds of solar masses that are left behind by the explosions of massive stars and grow by accretion of matter. Another model involves a large gas cloud in the period before the first stars formed collapsing into a [...] "quasi-star" [...] and then a black hole of initially only around , and then rapidly accreting to become relatively quickly an intermediate-mass black hole, and possibly a SMBH if the accretion-rate is not quenched at higher masses. [...] The initial [...] "quasi-star" [...] would become unstable <b>to</b> <b>radial</b> perturbations because of electron-positron pair production in its core, and may collapse directly into a black hole without a supernova explosion which would eject most of its mass and prevent it from leaving a black hole as a remnant.|$|E
