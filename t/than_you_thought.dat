When {{asked about the}} {{background}} of lead single [...] "First Time", Wade said, [...] "It just felt urgent, like a first kiss, a first love. [...] Like {{the first time you}} realize there's more to that relationship <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought.</b> I had to dig a little for that one, but I find myself at a place where I can write stuff that's a little deeper than your average love song in terms of emotion." [...] Wade was inspired to write [...] "The Joke" [...] after he read a newspaper article that detailed the story of a British boy who hung himself as a result of being bullied by his fellow schoolmates. The song [...] "Broken" [...] was written by Wade after he visited a friend in Nashville that needed a kidney transplant.|$|E

40|$|The Simulation Argument and the Doomsday Argument share certain {{structural}} similarities, {{and hence}} are often discussed together (Bostrom 2003, Aranyosi 2004, Richmond 2008, Bostrom and Kulczycki 2011). Both are cases where reflecting on one’s location among {{a set of}} possibilities yields a counter-intuitive conclusion—in one case {{that the end of}} humankind is closer <b>than</b> <b>you</b> initially <b>thought,</b> and in the second case that it is more likely <b>than</b> <b>you</b> initially <b>thought</b> that <b>you</b> are living in a computer simulation. Indeed, the two arguments do share strong structural similarities. But there are also some disanalogies between the two arguments, and I argue that these disanalogies mean that the Simulation Argument succeeds and the Doomsday Argument fails...|$|R

So unformed, vague, and without substance, as she had come to us, it seemed as if we could see Nature shaping out a woman before our very eyes, and yet had only a more reverential sense of the mystery of a woman's soul and frame. Yesterday, her cheek was pale, to-day, it had a bloom. Priscilla's smile, like a baby's first one, was a wondrous novelty. Her imperfections and shortcomings affected me with a kind of playful pathos, which was as absolutely bewitching a sensation as ever I experienced. After she had been a month or two at Blithedale, her animal spirits waxed high, and kept her pretty constantly in a state of bubble and ferment, impelling her to far more bodily activity than she had yet strength to endure. She was very fond of playing with the other girls out of doors. There is hardly another sight in the world so pretty as that of a company of young girls, almost women grown, at play, and so giving themselves up to their airy impulse that their tiptoes barely touch the ground.|$|E
6000|$|Burke {{declined}} most wisely {{to suggest}} any {{plan for the}} National Assembly. [...] "Permit me to say,"--this is in the letter of January 1791, {{to a member of}} the Assembly,--"that if I were as confident as I ought to be diffident in my own loose general ideas, I never should venture to broach them, if but at twenty leagues' distance from the centre of your affairs. I must see with my own eyes; I must in a manner touch with my own hands, not only the fixed, but momentary circumstances, before I could venture to suggest any political project whatsoever. I must know the power and disposition to accept, to execute, to persevere. I must see all the aids and all the obstacles. I must see the means of correcting the plan, where correctives would be wanted. I must see the things: I must see the men. Without a concurrence and adaptation of these to the design, the very best speculative projects might become not only useless but mischievous. Plans must be made for men. People at a distance must judge ill of men. They do not always answer to their reputation when you approach them. Nay, the perspective varies, and shows them quite other <b>than</b> <b>you</b> <b>thought</b> them. At a distance, if we judge uncertainly of men, we must judge worse of opportunities, which continually vary their shapes and colours, and pass away like clouds." [...] Our admiration at such words is quickly stifled when we recall the confident, unsparing, immoderate criticism which both preceded and followed this truly rational exposition of the danger of advising, in cases where we know neither the men nor the opportunities. Why was savage and unfaltering denunciation any less unbecoming than, as he admits, crude prescriptions would have been unbecoming? ...|$|E

The Eastern politicians never do anything without {{the opinion of the}} astrologers on the fortunate moment.
