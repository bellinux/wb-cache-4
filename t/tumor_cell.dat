The primary pigment is haematopodinB, which is so chemically sensitive (breaking down upon exposure to air and light) that its more stable breakdown product, haematopodin, was known before its eventual discovery and characterization in 2008. A chemical synthesis for haematopodin was reported in 1996. Haematopodins are the first pyrroloquinoline alkaloids discovered in fungi; pyrroloquinolines combine the structures of pyrrole and quinoline, both heterocyclic aromatic organic compounds. Compounds of this type also occur in marine sponges and are attracting research interest due to various biological properties, such as cytotoxicity against <b>tumor</b> <b>cell</b> lines, and both antifungal and antimicrobial activities.

40|$|Brain {{metastasis}} is {{resistant to}} chemotherapy while the leaky blood-brain-barrier in brain metastasis {{can not be}} the underlying reason. Metastatic <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> (“seed”) exploit the host microenvironment (“soil”) for survival advantages. Astrocytes which maintain the homeostasis of the brain microenvironment become reactive subsequent to brain damages and protect neurons from various injuries. We observed reactive astrocytes surrounding and infiltrating into brain metastasis in both clinical specimen and experimental animal model, thus raising a possibility that reactive astrocytes may protect <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> from cytotoxic chemotherapeutic drugs. ^ To test this hypothesis, we first generated an immortalized astrocyte cell line from H- 2 Kb-tsA 58 mice. The immortal mouse astrocytes expressed specific markers including GFAP. Scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that astrocytes formed direct physical contact with <b>tumor</b> <b>cells.</b> Moreover, the expression of GFAP by astrocytes was up-regulated subsequent to co-culture with <b>tumor</b> <b>cells,</b> indicating that the co-culture of astrocytes and <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> may serve as a model to recapitulate the pathophysiological situation of brain metastasis. ^ In co-culture, astrocytes dramatically reduced apoptosis of <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> produced by various chemotherapeutic drugs. This protection effect was not because of culturing cells from different species since mouse fibroblasts did not protect <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> from chemotherapy. Furthermore, the protection by astrocytes was completely dependent on a physical contact. ^ Gap junctional communication (GJC) served as this physical contact. <b>Tumor</b> <b>cells</b> and astrocytes both expressed the major component of gap junctional channel—connexin 43 and formed functional GJC as evidenced by the “dye transfer” assay. The blockage of GJC between <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> and astrocytes by either specific chemical blocker carbenoxolone (CBX) or by genetically knocking down connexin 43 on astrocytes reversed the chemo-protection. ^ Calcium was the signal molecule transmitted through GJC that rescued <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> from chemotherapy. Accumulation of cytoplasmic calcium preceded the progress of apoptosis in <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> treated with chemotherapeutic drugs. Furthermore, chelation of accumulated cytoplasmic calcium inhibited the apoptosis of <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> treated with chemotherapeutic drugs. Most importantly, astrocytes could “shunt” the accumulated cytoplasmic calcium from <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> (treated with chemotherapeutic drug) through GJC. We also used gene expression micro-array to investigate global molecular consequence of <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> forming GJC with astrocytes. The data demonstrated that astrocytes (but not fibroblasts), through GJC, up-regulated the expressions of several well known survival genes in <b>tumor</b> <b>cells.</b> ^ In summary, this dissertation provides a novel mechanism underlying the resistance of brain metastasis to chemotherapy, which is due to protection by astrocytes through GJC. Interference with the GJC between astrocytes and <b>tumor</b> <b>cells</b> holds great promise in sensitizing brain metastasis to chemotherapy and improving the prognosis for patients with brain metastasis. ...|$|R
