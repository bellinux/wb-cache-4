5|$|A Physics Nobel Prize laureate earns a gold medal, {{a diploma}} bearing a citation, and a sum of money. The {{amount of money}} awarded depends on the income of the Nobel Foundation that year. If a prize is awarded {{to more than one}} laureate, <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>is</b> either split evenly among them or, for three laureates, it may be divided into a half and two quarters.|$|E
5|$|As Secretary of Administration and Finance, Baker was a main {{architect}} of the Big Dig financing plan. In 1997 {{the federal government was}} planning to cut funding for the Big Dig by $300 million per year. The state set up a trust and sold Grant Anticipation Notes (GANs) to investors. The notes were secured by promising future federal highway funds. As federal highway dollars are awarded to Massachusetts, <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>is</b> used to pay off the GANs.|$|E
5|$|Bond recovers {{money for}} Sir Robert King, a British oil tycoon {{and friend of}} M, but <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>is</b> booby-trapped and kills King shortly afterwards. Bond traces the money to Renard, a KGB agent-turned-terrorist, who had {{previously}} kidnapped King's daughter Elektra. MI6 believes that Renard is targeting Elektra King a second time and Bond is assigned to protect her: the pair are subsequently attacked.|$|E
50|$|The {{budget for}} 2006 was $428,612.51. Town taxes {{accounted}} for over 65% of this <b>money.</b> <b>The</b> budget <b>was</b> all fulfilled by the state. Almost 32% of <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>was</b> spent on courthouse personnel. Over 22% of <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>was</b> spent on <b>the</b> Sheriff Department's expenses.|$|R
60|$|If <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>was</b> not received, {{it would}} have been absurd to ask on what account it was given. Both the {{question}} and the answer relate to some established usage, the appeal to which might possibly be used to justify the acceptance of <b>the</b> <b>money,</b> if it <b>was</b> accepted, but would be superfluous, and no way applicable to the charge, if <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>was</b> never given.|$|R

5|$|The {{expansion}} of the aviation industry was accompanied by the disruption of road transport; many roads are frequently blocked by militia checkpoints which demand payment (between $3 and $300, depending on goods carried) {{in order to allow}} the cars to continue their journey. A BBC report claimed there were seven such checkpoints in the 50km between an airstrip and the capital, Mogadishu. Most of <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>is</b> used to buy khat, a drug used by the militiamen.|$|E
5|$|Deciding to work together, Bart, Lisa, and Bob {{escape and}} try to save the dam. While Lisa and Bob set about {{defusing}} Cecil's dynamite, Bart jumps at Cecil before he can press the plunger. Cecil attempts to swat him off with the briefcase of money, but the case bursts open and <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>is</b> lost. Cecil manages to throw Bart off the cliff, declaring he will kill Bart as Bob never could; ironically, Bob grabs the cord of the dynamite and dives down {{in an effort to}} save him. As the two dangle {{down the side of the}} dam, Bob decides to cut the cord on the dynamite in an act of self-sacrifice to prevent Cecil from destroying the town, but his and Bart's perilous fall is broken by a conveniently placed pipe.|$|E
5|$|Later at the tavern, {{a police}} {{inspector}} from London named Morrison (István Lénárt) discusses with Brown {{the matter of}} the stolen money. Morrison claims to be working on behalf of a theater owner named Mitchell, a theatre owner from whose office safe the £55,000 was stolen. Morrison proposes that Brown, being intimately familiar with Mitchell's office, is the only man he knows who was capable of making away with the money without raising alarm. Morrison indicates that Mitchell cares only that <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>is</b> returned swiftly, and is even prepared to offer a two nights' theater takings in exchange. When Morrison mentions having visited Brown's wife and asks what he should tell Mitchell, Brown leaves the room under a pretense and slips out a side door. Nearby playing chess with the barkeep, Maloin has overheard the conversation.|$|E
50|$|None of <b>the</b> stolen <b>money</b> <b>is</b> ever {{recovered}} by the authorities. As {{the novel}} unfolds we learn {{the reason for}} the theft and the transformative use to which <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>was</b> put.|$|R
50|$|Dextra drew a cheque for $2,999,000 {{from its}} bankers to lend to the Bank of Jamaica. Its agents told Dextra <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>was</b> for a loan. The Bank of Jamaica <b>was</b> told <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>was</b> for foreign {{currency}} purchased by its agents. They gave <b>the</b> <b>money</b> to <b>the</b> agents, but the agents were fraudsters. Dextra wanted restitution.|$|R
50|$|It has <b>been</b> {{alleged that}} <b>the</b> <b>money,</b> meant to <b>be</b> {{used in the}} {{struggle}} for democracy, was misused. BP Koirala himself suspected that <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>was</b> misused.|$|R
5|$|On October 29, 2013, Dunderdale held a {{major news}} conference {{regarding}} the fishery at The Rooms in St. John's. Along with cabinet ministers and industry officials, Dunderdale {{announced that the}} federal and provincial governments would be investing $400 million, over three years, into the fishery. The federal government portion of the money totalled $280 million while the provincial portion was $120 million. <b>The</b> <b>money</b> <b>is</b> compensation for the province eliminating minimum processing requirements for the European Union. Although the premier said that her government plans to work with industry officials on how {{the money would be}} spent, she said it would be invested into such things as research and development, new marketing initiatives and infrastructure.|$|E
5|$|Sue's cheer squad loses at Regionals for {{the first}} time in seven years, and she is named Loser of the Year in a {{televised}} interview with Katie Couric. Furthering her ire, the cheerleading budget is slashed due to the cannon being seen as endangering the lives of children. <b>The</b> <b>money</b> <b>is</b> then handed over to the glee club so they can pay to go to regionals. Karofsky dismisses Finn's suggestion that he join the glee club permanently. Finally, Quinn kisses Finn, telling him that his actions have reminded her of why she loved him.|$|E
5|$|The Premier League sells its {{television}} {{rights on}} a collective basis. This {{is in contrast}} to some other European Leagues, including La Liga, in which each club sells its rights individually, leading to a much higher share of the total income going to the top few clubs. <b>The</b> <b>money</b> <b>is</b> divided into three parts: half is divided equally between the clubs; one quarter is awarded on a merit basis based on final league position, the top club getting twenty times as much as the bottom club, and equal steps {{all the way down the}} table; the final quarter is paid out as facilities fees for games that are shown on television, with the top clubs generally receiving the largest shares of this. The income from overseas rights is divided equally between the twenty clubs.|$|E

5|$|The {{player can}} protect their vault {{in a number}} of ways, such as {{building}} walls, keeping guard dogs, setting up traps such as electrified floors and bottomless pits, and giving guns to the player's family members so that they can defend the vault as well. The game does not punish the player for family members—by default, a wife and two children—being murdered by intruders; the player can even view footage of the incident afterwards. Rather, protecting <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>is</b> the goal the game emphasizes. The player starts off with $2,000 in cash and steals more from others' vaults; {{it can be used to}} purchase more objects to defend one's own vault. Additionally, a house is not accessible by thieves when its owner is retooling it for defense.|$|E
5|$|The series follows Shawn Spencer (James Roday) and his {{colleague}} and best friend Gus (Dulé Hill), who claim to operate a psychic detective agency. It is actually based on Shawn's hyperobservant ability. In the episode, {{the wife of a}} dead bank robber is brought to the police station to be warned that her husband's partners are being released from prison. She hires Shawn and Gus to help her find the money that was stolen and never found. Shawn and Gus search for the money, and find that the husband was not actually dead. Shawn realizes where <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>is,</b> and tells the woman, who he later discovers is actually the criminal mastermind. Detective Carlton Lassiter (Timothy Omundson) arrests the woman, and Shawn finds the money.|$|E
5|$|The vault at Pinchbeck's work is emptied and <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>is</b> found above Alvarez' bar. Later Mulder and Scully confront LaBonge and Maleeni as {{they are}} {{released}} on bail, where Mulder explains that he figured out their plan - LaBonge and Pinchbeck were not, in fact, enemies, {{and that they had}} been working together to put Alvarez in prison for making LaBonge's life miserable in prison 8 years prior, and that, as masters of sleight of hand and escape tricks, the two of them easily escaped, performed the robbery, and returned to their cells before being noticed.|$|E
50|$|In 1994, {{her initial}} romantic adventure, One for <b>the</b> <b>Money,</b> <b>was</b> {{published}} to good reviews. This {{was the first}} of a light-hearted series of mysteries starring barely competent bounty hunter Stephanie Plum.

5|$|Chrissie {{plans to}} sell the pub to Johnny Allen (Billy Murray) and a mystery second buyer, and flee the country, {{although}} Phil and Grant Mitchell try to taunt her. Chrissie though, is unfazed, as Sharon still supports her – however, Grant finally convinces Sharon to visit Sam in prison. Sharon still believes Chrissie is innocent, but finally learns the truth when Chrissie makes an innocuous, but telling, comment. Realising that Sharon knows, Chrissie becomes distraught as she felt that so long as Sharon, Den's daughter, thought well of her, she could think well of herself. Panicking, she begins to make mistakes, arguing with Jake outside of Johnny's club. Chrissie had confessed her role in Den's death to Jake, and lets information regarding her guilt slip as they argue. This is caught on CCTV by Johnny, who delights in telling Jake {{that he has a}} recording. Chrissie asks to get the money for The Queen Victoria right away, and Johnny takes advantage, saying the only way she will get <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>is</b> if she sleeps with him. Chrissie resists, saying that she will not hurt Jake. Johnny tells her that she will not receive the money, and tells Phil and Grant about the tape.|$|E
5|$|Lord Wilberforce, in Quistclose, {{stated that}} the {{contract}} gives the moneylender an equitable interest in the loan. Under Wilberforce's two-stage trust, the interest in the money first goes from the lender to the borrower (the primary trust) and then, when the trust's purpose fails, reverses (the secondary trust). In Twinsectra Lord Millett also explained that a Quistclose trust is a resulting trust, but held that the lender retains the interest throughout the transaction, with no need for this interest to reverse if {{the purpose of the}} loan fails. The problem with Wilberforce's analysis, as explained by Alastair Hudson, Professor of Equity and Finance Law at the University of Exeter, is that because the resulting trust only comes into existence after the misuse of the loan, it may come too late; if <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>is</b> not available when the claim is brought, there is no remedy. The borrower may already have spent the money, or already be insolvent and the subject of claims by creditors.|$|E
5|$|Veronica {{talks to}} the {{fraternity}} boys, {{and one of them}} tells her information that leads to her suspecting a boy named Chip. Keith and Harmony flirt, and Harmony shows a good amount of true romantic interest in Keith. Logan’s family has been donating $10,000 a month to “Aaron’s Kids”, which Veronica learns is not actually a charity. Veronica talks to Chip, who says that he was with another girl, who admits it while saying that she’ll never say so openly. Veronica turns her suspicion on Dick. After doing more digging, Veronica says that <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>is</b> going to Logan’s illegitimate brother, Charlie Stone. Parker insults Veronica for supposedly working with the fraternity. Keith catches Harmony’s husband kissing another woman. After talking to one of the other rape victims, Veronica discusses Claire with a slightly offbeat clerk, who says that Claire went in with a guy. Logan meets Charlie (Matt Czuchry), and they connect over surfing. However, Veronica notices some inconsistencies at Charlie’s private school job.|$|E

5|$|When a {{representative}} of the Society of Silent Flower Observers of Southern California comes to the shop to evaluate the plant, she announces that Seymour will receive a trophy from them, and that she will return when the plant's buds open. While Seymour is on a date with Audrey, Mushnick stays at the shop to see that Audrey Jr. does not hurt anyone else. After trading barbs with the plant when Audrey awakens and demands to be fed, Mushnick finds himself at the mercy of Kloy Haddock, a robber who pretended to be a customer of the previous day, and believes that the huge crowd he had observed attending the shop indicated the presence of a large amount of money. To save his own life, Mushnick tricks Haddock into thinking that <b>the</b> <b>money</b> <b>is</b> with the plant, which crushes and eats him. Not only does the monstrous plant's growth increase with this latest meal, but its intelligence and abilities do as well. It intimidates Mr. Mushnick, who is now more terrified than ever, but not so much that he will forgo the money the plant is bringing in as an attraction. After he is forced to damage his relationship with Audrey to keep her from discovering the plant's nature, an angry Seymour confronts the plant asserting he will no longer do its bidding just because it orders him to. The plant then employs hypnosis on the feckless lad and commands him to bring it more food. He wanders the night streets aimlessly until pursued by a rather aggressively persistent street walker Leonora Clyde, intent on making a score. Believing him harmless, she flirts with him to no avail until he inadvertently knocks her out with a rock and carries her back to feed Audrey Jr.|$|E
