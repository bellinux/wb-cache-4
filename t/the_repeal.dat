5|$|Finally in 1909, Stanley {{attached}} {{his proposed}} {{repeal of the}} tobacco tax as a rider to the Payne-Aldrich Tariff Act. The bill passed the House, but the Senate stripped Stanley's provision. Kentucky Senator Ollie M. James reintroduced <b>the</b> <b>repeal</b> into the Senate version of the bill, and it survived when the bill was passed into law. <b>The</b> <b>repeal</b> resulted in higher tobacco prices, and although Stanley had not been alone in getting <b>the</b> <b>repeal</b> passed, he received much of the credit. In 1911, Stanley's fight against the American Tobacco Company bore fruit, as the Supreme Court ruled the company to be in violation of antitrust laws and broke it into separate companies. Both the tax repeal and the breakup of American Tobacco helped quell the violence perpetrated by the Night Riders.|$|E
5|$|Once Birmingham Dissenters {{started to}} agitate for <b>the</b> <b>repeal</b> of the Test and Corporation Acts, which {{restricted}} Dissenters' civil rights (preventing them, for instance, from attending the Universities of Oxford or Cambridge, or from holding public office), the semblance of unity among the town's elite disappeared. Unitarians such as Priestley {{were at the}} forefront of <b>the</b> <b>repeal</b> campaign, and orthodox Anglicans grew nervous and angry. After 1787, the emergence of Dissenting groups formed {{for the sole purpose of}} overturning these laws began to divide the community; however, <b>the</b> <b>repeal</b> efforts failed in 1787, 1789, and 1790. Priestley's support of <b>the</b> <b>repeal</b> and his heterodox religious views, which were widely published, inflamed the populace. In February 1790, a group of activists came together not only to oppose the interests of the Dissenters but also to counteract what they saw as the undesirable importation of French Revolutionary ideals. Dissenters by and large supported the French Revolution and its efforts to question the role monarchy should play in government.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after his}} inauguration, Jefferson {{instructed}} his Secretary of State, James Madison, to stop delivery on all outstanding commissions. Further, {{an act of}} March 8, 1802 the abolished the circuit court judgeships created by the Midnight Judges Act (15 of which had already been filled), restoring the system created under the 1789 and 1793 acts. Federalists viewed this as unconstitutional and looked to the then-pending case of Marbury v. Madisonconcerning a confirmed D.C. {{justice of the peace}} who had not received his commissionas a test case for the constitutionality of <b>the</b> <b>repeal.</b> The next session of the Supreme Court was in June, one month before <b>the</b> <b>repeal</b> would take effect. But, the Judiciary Act of 1802 delayed the Court's next session until February 1803, and made other changes to the structure of the judicial system.|$|E

Benjamin More, a justice of the peace in the District of Columbia, argued that <b>the</b> <b>repeal</b> of statutory provisions authorizing compensation for his office violated the salary-protection guarantees for federal judges in Article Three of the United States Constitution. Below, a divided panel of the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia had sided with More, interpreted <b>the</b> <b>repeal</b> act prospectively, and sustained his demurrer to the criminal indictment for the common law crime of exacting illegal fees under color of office.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Cleveland's {{second term}} began, the Panic of 1893 struck the stock market, and he soon faced an acute {{economic}} depression. The panic was worsened by the acute shortage of gold {{that resulted from}} the increased coinage of silver, and Cleveland called Congress into special session {{to deal with the}} problem. The debate over the coinage was as heated as ever, and the effects of the panic had driven more moderates to support repealing the coinage provisions of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act. Even so, the silverites rallied their following at a convention in Chicago, and the House of Representatives debated for fifteen weeks before passing <b>the</b> <b>repeal</b> by a considerable margin. In the Senate, <b>the</b> <b>repeal</b> of silver coinage was equally contentious. Cleveland, forced against his better judgment to lobby the Congress for repeal, convinced enough Democrats – and along with eastern Republicans, they formed a 48–37 majority for repeal. Depletion of the Treasury's gold reserves continued, at a lesser rate, and subsequent bond issues replenished supplies of gold. At the time <b>the</b> <b>repeal</b> seemed a minor setback to silverites, but it {{marked the beginning of the}} end of silver as a basis for American currency.|$|E

5|$|Although the {{resolution}} {{was not as}} strong as Mason had liked—he wanted Virginia to threaten to cut off tobacco—Mason worked in the following years for non-importation. <b>The</b> <b>repeal</b> of most of the Townshend duties (excepting that on tea) made his task more difficult. In March 1773, his wife Ann died of illness contracted after another pregnancy. Mason was the sole parent to nine children, and his commitments made him even more reluctant to accept political office that would take him from Gunston Hall.|$|E

5|$|In Ex parte Tom Tong (1883), the Court held that—under 1872 {{amendments}} to the certification procedure, which went into effect during the Chase Court era—because habeas corpus was a civil proceeding, questions arising in habeas cases could not be certified to the Supreme Court until a final judgment had been entered. In Ex parte Milligan (1866), after <b>the</b> <b>repeal</b> of those amendments, the Court held that habeas petitions in the circuit courts could {{be a source of}} certified questions to the Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|Many of Priestley's {{political}} writings supported <b>the</b> <b>repeal</b> of the Test and Corporation Acts, which {{restricted the}} rights of Dissenters.
