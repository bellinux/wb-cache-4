It's not an actual event, but one <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> to be real. I would say that it's {{probably}} something that the kid made up, {{but at the time}} I believed him." ...|$|E
500|$|In a media {{statement}} {{published on}} the band's MySpace web page, lead singer Bernard Fanning, who originally wrote the song, said the inspiration came to him after [...] "a trip <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> last year to Uluru". He said it discussed the issue of people climbing the rock, which is sacred in Aboriginal folklore, despite [...] "the prevalence of literature and signage" [...] asking people not to. Fanning compared climbing Uluru to climbing the Vatican, which he noted would be highly offensive to Catholics.|$|E
500|$|One {{month later}} he {{enrolled}} in a differential equations course ("mostly full of seniors") as well. When Einar Hille temporarily replaced the regular instructor, Gleason found Hille's style [...] "unbelievably different... He had a view of mathematics that was just vastly different... That {{was a very important}} experience for me. So after <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> a lot of courses from Hille" [...] including, in his sophomore year, graduate-level real analysis. [...] "Starting with that course with Hille, I began to have some sense of what mathematics is about." ...|$|E

500|$|Cameron Thor had {{previously}} worked with Spielberg on Hook, and initially auditioned {{for the role}} of Malcolm, before trying out {{for the role of}} Dodgson. Thor said about casting, [...] "It just said 'shaving-cream can' in the script, so I spent endless time in a drug store to find the most photogenic. I went with Barbasol, which ended up in the movie. I was so broke <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> the can home after the audition to use it." [...] Laura Dern was Spielberg's first choice for the role of Ellie Sattler. Spielberg chose to cast Wayne Knight after seeing his acting performance in Basic Instinct, saying, [...] "I waited for the credits to roll and wrote his name down".|$|E
500|$|Henson {{received}} help editing {{the film}} from executive producer George Lucas. According to Henson, [...] "When {{we hit the}} editing, I did the first cut, and then George was heavily involved on bringing it to the final cut. After <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> it over again and did {{the next few months}} of post-production and audio." [...] Henson went on to explain, [...] "When you edit a film with somebody else you have to compromise. I always want to go one way, and George goes another way, but we each took turns trading off, giving and taking. George tends to be very action-oriented and he cuts dialogue quite tight; I tend to cut looser, and go for more lyrical pauses, which can slow the story. So, I loosen up his tightness, and he tightens my looseness." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1994 Keating led a {{group of}} liberals in a failed coup to remove state Senate President William Bulger, a fellow Democrat, from his position. Keating, a staunch liberal {{relative}} to the more socially conservative Bulger, sought to reform the Senate rules to greatly reduce the president's power. Bulger, who had held the Senate gavel for 15 years, exerted strict control over the body's operations, but was gradually losing his power base with new crops of Democratic freshmen replacing his longtime allies. Keating's campaign failed, but he said during his 2010 election campaign: [...] "The thought <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> on the most powerful person in Massachusetts, risking my whole career, a member of my own party, {{is something that is}} resonating in this campaign, that helps define me as independent." ...|$|E

500|$|While {{vacationing in}} the Bahamas and Costa Rica in 2008, Saadiq {{observed}} people there listening to classic soul music and {{was inspired to}} pursue it as a musical direction for his next album. He recounted the experience in an interview for Blues & Soul, saying that [...] "I was like 'Wow, maybe I should tap into this vibe, because it’s actually what I LOVE!' ... I realised that, though {{you can hear it}} in many of the records I've done throughout my career, I'd never paid 100% attention to going in that direction before. So the difference this time is <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> a more focused route." [...] As a part of Tony! Toni! Toné! during the late 1980s and 1990s, Saadiq had incorporated influences from the music of Motown in his songwriting for the group. Before recording The Way I See It, Saadiq signed to Columbia Records. Label executive Rick Rubin visited Saadiq's home studio and was impressed by his material there. He said of Rubin's visit and advice to him as a solo artist, [...] "He told me to never box myself in. I just have to be myself. You've got to follow your own path. I've always gone down the road less traveled, but now I do it even more aggressively." ...|$|E

Billy Corgan was making me sick!!!" [...] In an October 2008 interview, Osbourne revealed that she and Corgan had recently made up: [...] "I saw him at the Scream Awards. We hadn't seen each other since that whole thing in Germany. The first time we ran into each other and we hugged and kissed and laughed." ...|$|E
2500|$|With the {{ubiquity of}} the {{internet}} and piracy, Rettig, Lindsay and LeFevre all cite the album's staggered release as a blunder to its performance in succeeding territories, with Japan taking priority by a full two months. In speaking to Rettig, Jepsen stated that more of her attention was focused on the artistic side of the album rather than its marketing aspects: [...] "Not that I wasn’t aware and involved and actively debating all of these things—singles and strategy—but at the time I probably trusted other people before myself, and I think that’s something <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> from this. I will learn to value my own opinion on things just as much as I give that power away." ...|$|E

He had the best clothes and I gave him money. He didn't want for anything. Anybody in Grand Rapids can tell you <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> care of my kids". Floyd Sr. says he did all of his hustling at night and spent his days with his son, taking him to the gym and {{training}} him to be a boxer. [...] "If it wasn't for me he wouldn't be where he is today," [...] he maintains.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{incidents}} in the Genesis narrative demonstrate that adultery was understood to be a natural phenomenon. [...] These occur in the times of the Patriarchs over a span of about 200 years, the last one occurring more than 400 years before the giving of the law through Moses. In Genesis 12, Abram’s wife Sarai is taken into the Egyptian Pharaoh’s palace after Abram does not disclose her marital status. God inflicts “serious diseases on Pharaoh and his whole household.” Pharaoh realizes it is because Sarai is actually Abram’s wife and tells him, [...] "What is this you have done to me? Why did you not tell {{me that she was}} your wife? Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> her for my wife? Now then, here is your wife; take her, and go." ...|$|E
2500|$|Former {{stand-up}} comic John Ridley {{had originally}} written the screenplay, then titled Spoils of War, {{as an experiment}} to see how fast he could write and sell a film. The writing took him seven days, and Warner Bros. bought the script 18 days later. When the studio showed a list of their purchased scripts to Russell, the one-sentence description of Spoils of War, [...] "heist set in the Gulf War", appealed to him. Although Russell claimed he never read Ridley's script, so as not [...] "to pollute my own idea", he admits that [...] "John gets credit where it's due. The germ of the idea <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> was his." [...] Ridley maintains that Russell shut {{him out of the}} process, saying [...] "I never heard a word while he was shooting the movie. Never saw any of the script changes. And then finally, a year later, I get a copy of the script, and my name isn't even on it." [...] Although Warner Bros. worked out a deal to give Ridley a [...] "story by" [...] credit, Ridley remains unhappy with the experience, and has blocked Russell's efforts to publish the Three Kings screenplay in book form.|$|E

At 9 o'clock that evening, three white men came into camp and {{reported}} {{to me that a}} large band of Sioux warriors [...] camped 25 miles [...] northwest, waiting for an opportunity to attack the Pawnees for several days, anticipating that we would move up the river where buffaloes were feeding. Previous to this, white men visited us and warned us to be on our guard against Sioux attacks, and I was a trifle skeptical as to the truth of the story told by our white visitors. But one of the men, a young man about my age at the time, appeared to be so sincere in his efforts to impress upon me that the warning should be heeded, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>took</b> him to Sky Chief who was in command that day, for a conference. Sky Chief said the men were liars; that they wanted to scare the Pawnees away from the hunting grounds so that white men could kill buffaloes for hides. He told me I was squaw and a coward. I took exception to his remarks, and retorted: 'I will go as far as you dare go. Don't forget that.' ...|$|E
