5|$|Queen {{played a}} free concert {{organised}} by Richard Branson in <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>on</b> 18 September 1976, partway through recording the album A Day at the Races.

5|$|The {{abandoned}} structure suffered {{two separate}} fires that damaged <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> <b>on</b> December 24, 1970, and July 17, 1971. Eleven {{days after the}} second fire, demolition began, and the site was cleared {{for use by the}} University of Pittsburgh.|$|E
5|$|While at Geauga Lake, {{the ride}} was notable for {{interacting}} with the lake numerous times throughout the course.

5|$|Among {{the first}} {{industries}} to arrive was the Manchester Patent Fuel Company, in 1898. The Trafford Brick Company arrived soon after, followed by J.W. Southern & Co. (timber merchants), James Gresham (engineers), and W. T. Glovers & Co. (electric cable manufacturers). Glovers also built a power station in <b>the</b> <b>park,</b> <b>on</b> {{the banks of}} the Bridgewater Canal. Most of these early developments were built on {{the eastern side of the}} park, while the rest of it remained largely undeveloped.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{animals in}} zoos were {{typically}} held in poor conditions in small, cramped cages, and the Zoological Gardens presented no exception. As a result, its animals were frequently afflicted by disease, and also {{suffered from the}} harsh easterly winds of the Edinburgh climate. Despite these setbacks, the menagerie attempted to maintain its popularity by putting on concerts, acrobatics shows and displays of fireworks and Montgolfier balloons. Children were carried around <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>on</b> {{the back of the}} zoo's elephant, giving it a rare opportunity for exercise. Even with these entertainments, the Zoological Gardens were eventually forced to admit defeat. The park was closed and the site sold to a property developer in 1857. Nothing now remains of the house or its gardens.|$|E
5|$|Having {{obtained}} the Saltwellgate estate, the council contacted local ornithologist and landscaper John Hancock {{and asked him}} to submit designs for the new park. When Hancock refused, citing the pressure of his existing work, the park committee retained Edward Kemp at four guineas a day until his plans were submitted and approved in February 1876. Kemp's plans were implemented {{over a period of years}} by borough surveyor James Bowyer at a cost of around £11,000. Original plans to officially open <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>on</b> Whit Monday 1876 were not realised, and the park was never officially opened, but nonetheless, public usage began in late 1876.|$|E

5|$|On Town Street, {{a row of}} brick-built cottages {{with stone}} slate roofs, known as Top of the town {{was built in the}} mid 18th century. The 19th-century St Mary's Church, with its {{contemporary}} lych gate and flanking walls are all Grade II listed buildings. In the churchyard is a war memorial erected in 1920. To the west of the war memorial is a gatehouse which stood at an old entrance to the hall grounds. The distinctive white concrete water tower at the high point of the hill is at the south west corner of <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>on</b> Town Street.|$|E
5|$|Outcrops of this {{brightly colored}} red, brown, and pink banded {{formation}} {{can be seen}} in the Kolob Canyons section of the park and in buttes on either side of State Route9 between Rockville, Utah to the south and Virgin, Utah to the southwest of the park borders. Progressively higher beds are exposed until the top of the formation is reached at the mouth of Parunweap Canyon (when traveling to <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>on</b> Route9).|$|E
5|$|Paintings of {{the canyon}} by Frederick S. Dellenbaugh were {{exhibited}} at the Saint Louis World's Fair in 1904, followed by a glowing article in Scribner's Magazine the next year. That, along with previously created photographs, paintings, and reports, led to President William Howard Taft's proclamation on July 31, 1909 that created Mukuntuweap National Monument. In 1917, the {{acting director of the}} newly created National Park Service visited the canyon and proposed changing its name from the locally unpopular Mukuntuweap to Zion, a name used by the local Mormon community. The United States Congress added more land and established Zion National Park on November 19, 1919. A separate Zion National Monument, the Kolob Canyons area, was proclaimed on January 22, 1937, and was incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>on</b> July 11, 1956.|$|E
50|$|Construction {{began in}} 1911. The house was {{originally}} meant {{as the main}} restaurant of <b>the</b> Luna <b>Park.</b> <b>On</b> 5 May 1914 the new house was completed.

5|$|Somewhat later, andesitic lavas {{poured out}} {{from what is}} now Reading Peak and mainly flowed {{to the south and}} east, {{reaching}} the head of Warner Valley. By this time, the park's eastern portion had been transformed into a relatively flat plain. The activity was followed by an eruption of the Eastern basalts from volcanoes east of the park. These thick flows have subsequently eroded to produce rugged hills that limit <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>on</b> the east. Taken together, these various flows built the lava plateau that the Lassen volcanic area is located on.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian Pacific Railway was {{instrumental}} in Banff's early years, building the Banff Springs Hotel and Chateau Lake Louise, and attracting tourists through extensive advertising. In the early 20th century, roads were built in Banff, at times by war internees from World War I, and through Great Depression-era public works projects. Since the 1960s, park accommodations have been open all year, with annual tourism visits to Banff increasing to over 5million in the 1990s. Millions more pass through <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>on</b> the Trans-Canada Highway. As Banff has over three million visitors annually, the health of its ecosystem has been threatened. In the mid-1990s, Parks Canada responded by initiating a two-year study, which resulted in management recommendations, and new policies that aim to preserve ecological integrity.|$|E
5|$|The Stretford Pageant is {{an annual}} Rose Queen festival {{held on the}} last Saturday of June; the inaugural pageant was staged in 1919. There is a {{procession}} of decorated floats through the streets, collecting money for local charities and ending at Longford Park, where the Rose Queen is crowned. The tradition of the Rose Queen derives from an earlier event organised by St Peter's Church from 1909 until the pageant began in 1919. Various other entertainments are provided in <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>on</b> {{the day of the}} pageant, such as a fun fair and a car boot sale. Stretford Pageant, along with similar events in other parts of Trafford, is under threat because of the council's proposals to reduce funding and support for such events in the future.|$|E

The tower, built from red sandstone, is believed to date to the late 18th century. The northern side is considerably more eroded by the weather than the southern side. The tower is marginally wider at the base and has no internal floor structure, but contains holes for floor joists and stair treads. There are four windows on the ground floors and narrower windows higher up.|$|E
5|$|Tom died of {{pancreatic}} cancer in July 1995—three years before {{construction of the}} park began. During a Chinatown Chamber of Commerce meeting held in March 1998, the Riverside Park Advisory Council suggested renaming the park in honor of Ping Tom, {{the driving force behind}} the its creation. The request was approved on August 3, 1998, and the park was renamed Ping Tom Memorial Park. The park was dedicated and officially opened by Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley during a ceremony on October 2, 1999. In 2005, the CADC and friends of the Tom family commissioned sculptor Liao Huilana to create a bronze bust of Ping Tom. The bust was dedicated and installed at <b>the</b> <b>park</b> <b>on</b> October 22, 2005.|$|E
5|$|Henry Henniger, the {{president}} of Kennywood Entertainment Company, wanted a large steel coaster in the late 1980s. The park had only built wooden roller coasters in the past. The park also had a very tight layout {{and they were not}} sure how to fit it into <b>the</b> <b>park.</b> <b>On</b> July 27, 1990, Kennywood announced the name of their new roller coaster would be Steel Phantom and it would use the same station as Laser Loop, which it replaced. The ride opened on May 10, 1991 as the fastest and steepest steel roller coaster in the world. The inversions were a vertical loop, a Boomerang, and a corkscrew. As a result of the inversions, riders experienced more-than-usual head banging. Shortly after its debut, a trim brake was added because the coaster was going faster than it should through the inversions and riders were experiencing pain in their necks.|$|E
