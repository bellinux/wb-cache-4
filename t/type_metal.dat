Such alloys {{are not used}} in foodservice applications for public health reasons. <b>Type</b> <b>metal,</b> an alloy of lead, tin and antimony (with sometimes traces of copper) is used for casting hand-set type in letterpress printing and hot foil blocking. Traditionally cast in hand jerk moulds now predominantly die cast after the industrialisation of the type foundries. Around 1900 the slug casting machines came onto the market and added further automation, with sometimes dozens of casting machines at one newspaper office.|$|E
5|$|The heavier {{metalloids}} {{continue the}} theme. Arsenic can form alloys with metals, including platinum and copper; {{it is also}} added to copper and its alloys to improve corrosion resistance and appears to confer the same benefit when added to magnesium. Antimony is well known as an alloy-former, including with the coinage metals. Its alloys include pewter (a tin alloy with up to 20% antimony) and <b>type</b> <b>metal</b> (a lead alloy with up to 25% antimony). Tellurium readily alloys with iron, as ferrotellurium (50–58% tellurium), and with copper, {{in the form of}} copper tellurium (40–50% tellurium). Ferrotellurium is used as a stabilizer for carbon in steel casting. Of the non-metallic elements less often recognised as metalloids, selenium—in the form of ferroselenium (50–58% selenium)—is used to improve the machinability of stainless steels.|$|E
25|$|Behind {{the mold}} disk is the <b>type</b> <b>metal</b> pot, which {{contains}} molten <b>type</b> <b>metal.</b> A piston {{in the pot}} pushes the molten metal down into the pot, which forces the metal through the pot throat and into the mold, forcing it against {{the faces of the}} matrices. These have character shapes cut into them, so the result is a cast slug with the character shapes of the line on its front face. The mold disk is sometimes water-cooled, and often air-cooled with a blower, to carry away the heat of the molten <b>type</b> <b>metal</b> and allow the cast slugs to solidify quickly.|$|E

The vise has two jaws (1 and 2 in the illustration) which are set to the desired line width. The spacebands are now expanded to justify the line. When the line is justified, the matrices fit tightly between the vise jaws, forming a tight seal which will prevent the molten <b>type</b> <b>metal</b> from escaping when the line is cast.|$|E
25|$|The {{linotype}} machine operator enters text on a 90-character keyboard. The machine assembles matrices, which are molds for the letter forms, in a line. The assembled line is then {{cast as a}} single piece, called a slug, of <b>type</b> <b>metal</b> in {{a process known as}} hot metal typesetting. The matrices are then returned to the type magazine from which they came, to be reused later. This allows much faster typesetting and composition than original hand composition in which operators place down one pre-cast glyph (metal letter, punctuation mark or space) at a time.|$|E

25|$|Gutenberg is also {{credited}} {{with the introduction of}} an oil-based ink which was more durable than previously used water-based inks. Having worked as a professional goldsmith, Gutenberg made skillful use of his knowledge of metals. He also the first to make his type from an alloy of lead, tin, and antimony, known as <b>type</b> <b>metal,</b> printer's lead, or printer's metal, which was critical for producing durable type that produced high-quality printed books, and proved to be more suitable for printing than the clay, wooden or bronze types used in East Asia. To create these lead types, Gutenberg used what some considered his most ingenious invention: a special matrix which enabled the moulding of new movable types with an unprecedented precision at short notice. Within a year of printing the Gutenberg Bible, Gutenberg also published the first coloured prints.|$|E
25|$|The {{first part}} of the Gutenberg idea was using a single, hand-carved {{character}} to create identical copies of itself. Cutting a single letter could take a craftsman a day of work. A single page taking 2500 letters made this way was impractical. A less labour-intensive method of reproduction was needed. Copies were produced by stamping the original into an iron plate, called a matrix. A rectangular tube was then connected to the matrix, creating a container in which molten <b>type</b> <b>metal</b> could be poured. Once cooled, the solid metal form was released from the tube. The fundamental innovation is that this matrix can be used to produce many duplicates of the same letter. The result of each molding was a rectangular block of metal with the form of the desired character protruding from the end. This piece of type could be put in a line, facing up, with other pieces of type. These lines were arranged to form blocks of text, which could be inked and pressed against paper, transferring the desired text to the paper.|$|E
2500|$|If the {{operator}} did not assemble enough characters, the line will not justify correctly: {{even with the}} spacebands expanded all the way, the matrices are not tight. A safety mechanism in the justification vise detects this and blocks the casting operation. Without such a mechanism, {{the result would be}} a squirt of molten <b>type</b> <b>metal</b> spraying out through the gaps between the matrices, creating a time consuming mess and a possible hazard to {{the operator}}. If a squirt did occur, it was generally up to the operator to grab the hell bucket and catch the flowing lead. It was so called because the bucket would often [...] "go to hell", or melt, while holding the molten lead that was still extremely hot. Also, in conjunction with possible hazards facing an operator, toxic lead fumes were possible, as they were the result of melting the lead ingots for casting.|$|E

2500|$|Electrotyping {{was also}} used to produce entire {{printing}} plates directly from the formes composed from movable type and illustrations. In this application, electrotyping was a higher quality but more costly alternative to stereotyping, which involved casting of <b>type</b> <b>metal</b> into a mold prepared from the forme. Stereotyping had been invented around 1725, and was already well-established when electrotyping was invented in 1838. Both methods yielded plates that could be preserved in case of future needs, for example in the printing of novels and other books of unpredictable popularity. The movable type used to compose the original forme could then be re-used. Both methods {{could be used to}} prepared curved plates for rotary presses, which were used for the longest print runs. The widespread adoption of electrotyping for this use occurred after mechanical electrical generators (dynamos) became commonly available around 1872. These generators supplanted the whole rooms of chemical batteries (Smee cells) that were previously used to provide electricity for electrotyping. Batteries did not have the electrical capacity needed to rapidly deposit the electrotype (or [...] "electro"). The advent of plating dynamos sped up electrotyping twenty times or more, so that an electrotype printing plate could be deposited in less than two hours. In addition, the chemical batteries gave off toxic fumes that had required their isolation in separate rooms.|$|E
2500|$|Older {{machines}} typically had a 1/3hp 850 or 1140 revolution {{per minute}} motor geared to the main clutch wheel, the inner shaft engaging this wheel while the casting cycle was in operation. [...] An external leather belt on this wheel ran a second jack-shaft, which powered the distributor and keyboard matrix conveyor and escapements through additional belting off this shaft. [...] Gas fired pots, {{such as in the}} illustration below, were most common in the earlier years, with the pot being thermostatically controlled (high flame when under temperature and low flame when up to temperature), and then a second smaller burner for the mouth and throat heating, or else, with the more modern installations running on 1500 watt electric pots with an initially rheostat controlled mouth and throat heaters (several hundred watts on the electric models)(to keep the lead and tin <b>type</b> <b>metal</b> liquified just prior to being cast) to precisely adjust temperature. [...] Newer machines, and the larger machines above 36 EM Matrix size typically used the more standardized 1/2 horsepower motor after v-belts came into common use in the 1930s. [...] The large machines also had the so-called 'double pot', with either larger gas burners, or else 2250 watt pot heaters and larger mouth and throat heaters. [...] The most modern Linotypes had the mouth and throat heaters thermostatically controlled, an improvement over the manual rheostat adjustment, or gas flame adjustment.|$|E
